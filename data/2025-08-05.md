### [1] [Rethinking Graph-Based Document Classification: Learning Data-Driven Structures Beyond Heuristic Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00864)
*Margarita Bugueño,Gerard de Melo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种数据驱动的图结构学习方法，用于文档分类，优于传统启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图文档表示多依赖启发式或领域知识，缺乏通用性。

Method: 构建同质加权图，节点为句子，边通过自注意力模型学习，并采用统计过滤保留强相关句子。

Result: 在三个数据集上表现优于启发式方法，准确率和F1分数更高，统计过滤提升分类鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 自动图生成方法潜力大，为NLP应用开辟新方向。

Abstract: In document classification, graph-based models effectively capture document
structure, overcoming sequence length limitations and enhancing contextual
understanding. However, most existing graph document representations rely on
heuristics, domain-specific rules, or expert knowledge. Unlike previous
approaches, we propose a method to learn data-driven graph structures,
eliminating the need for manual design and reducing domain dependence. Our
approach constructs homogeneous weighted graphs with sentences as nodes, while
edges are learned via a self-attention model that identifies dependencies
between sentence pairs. A statistical filtering strategy aims to retain only
strongly correlated sentences, improving graph quality while reducing the graph
size. Experiments on three document classification datasets demonstrate that
learned graphs consistently outperform heuristic-based graphs, achieving higher
accuracy and $F_1$ score. Furthermore, our study demonstrates the effectiveness
of the statistical filtering in improving classification robustness. These
results highlight the potential of automatic graph generation over traditional
heuristic approaches and open new directions for broader applications in NLP.

### [2] [FECT: Factuality Evaluation of Interpretive AI-Generated Claims in Contact Center Conversation Transcripts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00889)
*Hagyeong Shin,Binoy Robin Dalal,Iwona Bialynicka-Birula,Navjot Matharu,Ryan Muir,Xingwei Yang,Samuel W. K. Wong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为3D（分解、解耦、脱离）的范式，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在联系中心对话分析中的事实性，并引入了FECT基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业应用中，LLMs的幻觉问题可能导致错误的业务决策，而联系中心对话的分析缺乏事实性评估标准。

Method: 提出了3D范式（分解、解耦、脱离）和FECT数据集，用于评估LLMs生成的事实性。

Result: 研究发现3D范式能有效评估LLMs在联系中心对话分析中的事实性。

Conclusion: 论文为AI系统生成联系中心对话分析的事实性评估提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to hallucinate, producing natural
language outputs that are not grounded in the input, reference materials, or
real-world knowledge. In enterprise applications where AI features support
business decisions, such hallucinations can be particularly detrimental. LLMs
that analyze and summarize contact center conversations introduce a unique set
of challenges for factuality evaluation, because ground-truth labels often do
not exist for analytical interpretations about sentiments captured in the
conversation and root causes of the business problems. To remedy this, we first
introduce a \textbf{3D} -- \textbf{Decompose, Decouple, Detach} -- paradigm in
the human annotation guideline and the LLM-judges' prompt to ground the
factuality labels in linguistically-informed evaluation criteria. We then
introduce \textbf{FECT}, a novel benchmark dataset for \textbf{F}actuality
\textbf{E}valuation of Interpretive AI-Generated \textbf{C}laims in Contact
Center Conversation \textbf{T}ranscripts, labeled under our 3D paradigm.
Lastly, we report our findings from aligning LLM-judges on the 3D paradigm.
Overall, our findings contribute a new approach for automatically evaluating
the factuality of outputs generated by an AI system for analyzing contact
center conversations.

### [3] [XAutoLM: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Language Models via Meta-Learning and AutoML](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00924)
*Ernesto L. Estevanell-Valladares,Suilan Estevez-Velarde,Yoan Gutiérrez,Andrés Montoyo,Ruslan Mitkov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XAutoLM是一个基于元学习的AutoML框架，旨在高效优化语言模型的微调流程，减少计算资源和环境影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化框架未能同时解决模型选择和超参数优化问题，导致资源浪费。XAutoLM通过复用历史经验，提升效率。

Method: 利用任务和系统级元特征，从存储的成功和失败中学习，优化配置采样。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，XAutoLM表现优于零样本优化器，显著减少评估时间和错误率。

Conclusion: XAutoLM为资源高效的NLP模型微调提供了新方向，推动了绿色AI的发展。

Abstract: Experts in machine learning leverage domain knowledge to navigate decisions
in model selection, hyperparameter optimisation, and resource allocation. This
is particularly critical for fine-tuning language models (LMs), where repeated
trials incur substantial computational overhead and environmental impact.
However, no existing automated framework simultaneously tackles the entire
model selection and HPO task for resource-efficient LM fine-tuning. We
introduce XAutoLM, a meta-learning-augmented AutoML framework that reuses past
experiences to optimise discriminative and generative LM fine-tuning pipelines
efficiently. XAutoLM learns from stored successes and failures by extracting
task- and system-level meta-features to bias its sampling toward fruitful
configurations and away from costly dead ends. On four text classification and
two question-answering benchmarks, XAutoLM surpasses zero-shot optimiser's peak
F1 on five of six tasks, cuts mean evaluation time by up to 4.5x, reduces error
ratios by up to sevenfold, and uncovers up to 50% more pipelines above the
zero-shot Pareto front. In contrast, simpler memory-based baselines suffer
negative transfer. We release XAutoLM and our experience store to catalyse
resource-efficient, Green AI fine-tuning in the NLP community.

### [4] [MAO-ARAG: Multi-Agent Orchestration for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01005)
*Yiqun Chen,Erhan Zhang,Lingyong Yan,Shuaiqiang Wang,Jizhou Huang,Dawei Yin,Jiaxin Mao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应RAG框架MAO-ARAG，通过多智能体协同动态规划工作流，以平衡问答系统的性能和成本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定RAG管道难以应对不同复杂度的查询，导致性能和成本效率不平衡。

Method: 采用多智能体协同框架，包括执行器智能体（如查询重构、文档选择和生成）和规划智能体，通过强化学习动态选择工作流。

Result: 在多个QA数据集上验证，MAO-ARAG能提供高质量答案，同时控制成本和延迟。

Conclusion: MAO-ARAG通过动态规划工作流，显著提升了问答系统的适应性和效率。

Abstract: In question-answering (QA) systems, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
become pivotal in enhancing response accuracy and reducing hallucination
issues. The architecture of RAG systems varies significantly, encompassing
single-round RAG, iterative RAG, and reasoning RAG, each tailored to address
different types of queries. Due to the varying complexity of real-world
queries, a fixed RAG pipeline often struggles to balance performance and cost
efficiency across different queries. To address this challenge, we propose an
adaptive RAG framework called MAO-ARAG, which leverages multi-agent
orchestration. Our adaptive RAG is conceived as a multi-turn framework.
Specifically, we define multiple executor agents, representing typical RAG
modules such as query reformulation agents, document selection agent, and
generation agents. A planner agent intelligently selects and integrates the
appropriate agents from these executors into a suitable workflow tailored for
each query, striving for high-quality answers while maintaining reasonable
costs. During each turn, the planner agent is trained using reinforcement
learning, guided by an outcome-based reward (F1 score) and a cost-based
penalty, continuously improving answer quality while keeping costs within a
reasonable range. Experiments conducted on multiple QA datasets demonstrate
that our approach, which dynamically plans workflows for each query, not only
achieves high answer quality but also maintains both cost and latency within
acceptable limits.The code of MAO-ARAG is on

### [5] [UrBLiMP: A Benchmark for Evaluating the Linguistic Competence of Large Language Models in Urdu](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01006)
*Farah Adeeba,Brian Dillon,Hassan Sajjad,Rajesh Bhatt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了UrBLiMP基准，用于评估多语言大模型在低资源语言乌尔都语中的语法知识，发现模型表现差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估多语言大模型在低资源语言（如乌尔都语）中的语法知识，填补现有研究的不足。

Method: 构建UrBLiMP数据集，包含5,696对最小差异句子，覆盖十种核心语法现象，并进行人类标注验证。

Result: LLaMA-3-70B表现最佳（94.73%），但与Gemma-3-27B-PT等模型无显著差异。

Conclusion: 当前多语言大模型在低资源语言的细粒度语法知识捕捉上既有潜力也有局限。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance
across various languages; however, they often include significantly less data
for low-resource languages such as Urdu compared to high-resource languages
like English. To assess the linguistic knowledge of LLMs in Urdu, we present
the Urdu Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs (UrBLiMP) i.e. pairs of
minimally different sentences that contrast in grammatical acceptability.
UrBLiMP comprises 5,696 minimal pairs targeting ten core syntactic phenomena,
carefully curated using the Urdu Treebank and diverse Urdu text corpora. A
human evaluation of UrBLiMP annotations yielded a 96.10% inter-annotator
agreement, confirming the reliability of the dataset. We evaluate twenty
multilingual LLMs on UrBLiMP, revealing significant variation in performance
across linguistic phenomena. While LLaMA-3-70B achieves the highest average
accuracy (94.73%), its performance is statistically comparable to other top
models such as Gemma-3-27B-PT. These findings highlight both the potential and
the limitations of current multilingual LLMs in capturing fine-grained
syntactic knowledge in low-resource languages.

### [6] [Cross-Domain Web Information Extraction at Pinterest](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01096)
*Michael Farag,Patrick Halina,Andrey Zaytsev,Alekhya Munagala,Imtihan Ahmed,Junhao Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pinterest提出了一种结合结构、视觉和文本模态的网页表示方法，用于高效提取电商网站的产品属性，其简单模型（如XGBoost）在准确性和成本效益上优于复杂的大型语言模型（如GPT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网上存在大量非结构化信息，将其转换为结构化数据是重要挑战。Pinterest需要从电商网站准确提取产品属性以提升用户体验和内容分发效率。

Method: 采用新颖的网页表示方法，将HTML节点的结构、视觉和文本信息整合为紧凑形式，并优化用于小型模型（如XGBoost）学习。

Result: 系统处理速度超过每秒1000个URL，准确性优于GPT等复杂模型，且成本效益高出1000倍。

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性和可扩展性上表现优异，同时显著降低了成本，为结构化数据提取提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The internet offers a massive repository of unstructured information, but
it's a significant challenge to convert this into a structured format. At
Pinterest, the ability to accurately extract structured product data from
e-commerce websites is essential to enhance user experiences and improve
content distribution. In this paper, we present Pinterest's system for
attribute extraction, which achieves remarkable accuracy and scalability at a
manageable cost. Our approach leverages a novel webpage representation that
combines structural, visual, and text modalities into a compact form,
optimizing it for small model learning. This representation captures each
visible HTML node with its text, style and layout information. We show how this
allows simple models such as eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to extract
attributes more accurately than much more complex Large Language Models (LLMs)
such as Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT). Our results demonstrate a
system that is highly scalable, processing over 1,000 URLs per second, while
being 1000 times more cost-effective than the cheapest GPT alternatives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）生成结构化临床咨询模板的能力，发现模型虽能全面生成内容，但存在过长和优先级问题，尤其在叙事驱动领域表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在电子咨询中生成结构化临床模板的潜力，以提升医生间的信息交流效率。

Method: 使用145个专家模板，通过多代理流程（提示优化、语义自动评分和优先级分析）测试多个前沿模型。

Result: 模型如o3在全面性上表现优异（达92.2%），但模板过长且优先级错误，尤其在精神病学和疼痛医学领域表现下降。

Conclusion: LLMs可提升临床信息交换，但需更鲁棒的评估方法以优化优先级和时间约束下的表现。

Abstract: This study evaluates the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to generate
structured clinical consultation templates for electronic consultation. Using
145 expert-crafted templates developed and routinely used by Stanford's
eConsult team, we assess frontier models -- including o3, GPT-4o, Kimi K2,
Claude 4 Sonnet, Llama 3 70B, and Gemini 2.5 Pro -- for their ability to
produce clinically coherent, concise, and prioritized clinical question
schemas. Through a multi-agent pipeline combining prompt optimization, semantic
autograding, and prioritization analysis, we show that while models like o3
achieve high comprehensiveness (up to 92.2\%), they consistently generate
excessively long templates and fail to correctly prioritize the most clinically
important questions under length constraints. Performance varies across
specialties, with significant degradation in narrative-driven fields such as
psychiatry and pain medicine. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can enhance
structured clinical information exchange between physicians, while highlighting
the need for more robust evaluation methods that capture a model's ability to
prioritize clinically salient information within the time constraints of
real-world physician communication.

### [8] [CSIRO-LT at SemEval-2025 Task 11: Adapting LLMs for Emotion Recognition for Multiple Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01161)
*Jiyu Chen,Necva Bölücü,Sarvnaz Karimi,Diego Mollá,Cécile L. Paris*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了跨语言情感检测的挑战，提出通过微调多语言LLM并结合LoRA设置的方法，显著提升了情感识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于情感表达具有文化和语言多样性，跨语言情感检测极具挑战性。Semeval 2025 Task 11旨在探索跨语言情感识别方法。

Method: 采用任务适应策略，对预训练的多语言LLM进行微调，并结合LoRA设置，针对每种语言单独优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在跨语言情感识别任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 通过语言特定的微调和LoRA设置，可以有效提升跨语言情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Detecting emotions across different languages is challenging due to the
varied and culturally nuanced ways of emotional expressions. The
\textit{Semeval 2025 Task 11: Bridging the Gap in Text-Based emotion} shared
task was organised to investigate emotion recognition across different
languages. The goal of the task is to implement an emotion recogniser that can
identify the basic emotional states that general third-party observers would
attribute to an author based on their written text snippet, along with the
intensity of those emotions. We report our investigation of various
task-adaptation strategies for LLMs in emotion recognition. We show that the
most effective method for this task is to fine-tune a pre-trained multilingual
LLM with LoRA setting separately for each language.

### [9] [Adaptive Content Restriction for Large Language Models via Suffix Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01198)
*Yige Li,Peihai Jiang,Jun Sun,Peng Shu,Tianming Liu,Zhen Xiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级方法Suffix Optimization (SOP)，用于动态限制大语言模型生成特定受限内容，无需微调模型，并在多个模型上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如监督微调）难以应对不同用户群体和快速变化的限制需求，因此需要一种轻量级且灵活的内容限制策略。

Method: 提出Suffix Optimization (SOP)，通过在提示后附加优化的短后缀，阻止模型生成受限词汇，同时保持输出质量。

Result: 在多个模型（如Gemma2-2B、Mistral-7B等）上，SOP比基线方法平均限制率提升6%-17%。

Conclusion: SOP是一种实用且高效的内容限制方法，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success across
diverse applications. However, enforcing content restrictions remains a
significant challenge due to their expansive output space. One aspect of
content restriction is preventing LLMs from generating harmful content via
model alignment approaches such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Yet, the need
for content restriction may vary significantly across user groups, change
rapidly over time, and not always align with general definitions of
harmfulness. Applying SFT to each of these specific use cases is impractical
due to the high computational, data, and storage demands. Motivated by this
need, we propose a new task called \textit{Adaptive Content Restriction}
(AdaCoRe), which focuses on lightweight strategies -- methods without model
fine-tuning -- to prevent deployed LLMs from generating restricted terms for
specific use cases. We propose the first method for AdaCoRe, named
\textit{Suffix Optimization (SOP)}, which appends a short, optimized suffix to
any prompt to a) prevent a target LLM from generating a set of restricted
terms, while b) preserving the output quality. To evaluate AdaCoRe approaches,
including our SOP, we create a new \textit{Content Restriction Benchmark}
(CoReBench), which contains 400 prompts for 80 restricted terms across 8
carefully selected categories. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SOP on
CoReBench, which outperforms the system-level baselines such as system suffix
by 15\%, 17\%, 10\%, 9\%, and 6\% on average restriction rates for Gemma2-2B,
Mistral-7B, Vicuna-7B, Llama3-8B, and Llama3.1-8B, respectively. We also
demonstrate that SOP is effective on POE, an online platform hosting various
commercial LLMs, highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

### [10] [Show or Tell? Modeling the evolution of request-making in Human-LLM conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01213)
*Shengqi Zhu,Jeffrey M. Rzeszotarski,David Mimno*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务，将聊天查询分割为请求内容、角色、查询特定上下文和附加表达，并分析了LLM查询中用户行为的特点及其演变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 聊天日志是了解LLM用户行为的重要资源，但查询的多样性掩盖了行为模式。研究旨在揭示这些模式及其变化。

Method: 提出分割聊天查询的任务，并利用数据资源进行历时分析，研究用户表达的变化。

Result: 发现LLM查询中的请求行为与人际互动不同，用户早期查询强调请求，但随着经验增加趋于收敛。模型能力变化也影响用户行为。

Conclusion: 研究为理解LLM用户行为提供了新视角，揭示了查询模式的演变和模型能力对行为的影响。

Abstract: Chat logs provide a rich source of information about LLM users, but patterns
of user behavior are often masked by the variability of queries. We present a
new task, segmenting chat queries into contents of requests, roles,
query-specific context, and additional expressions. We find that, despite the
familiarity of chat-based interaction, request-making in LLM queries remains
significantly different from comparable human-human interactions. With the data
resource, we introduce an important perspective of diachronic analyses with
user expressions. We find that query patterns vary between early ones
emphasizing requests, and individual users explore patterns but tend to
converge with experience. Finally, we show that model capabilities affect user
behavior, particularly with the introduction of new models, which are traceable
at the community level.

TL;DR: WebDS是首个端到端的基于网络的数据科学基准测试，包含870个任务，覆盖29个网站，旨在评估复杂、多步骤的数据科学操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络基准测试过于简单，传统数据科学基准测试则局限于静态数据集，无法反映实际数据科学任务的多模态和工具使用需求。

Method: 引入WebDS基准测试，涵盖多样化的网站和任务，评估代理在复杂操作中的表现。

Result: 当前SOTA LLM代理在WebDS上的表现显著低于其他基准测试（如Web Voyager），暴露出信息基础薄弱、重复行为和走捷径等问题。

Conclusion: WebDS为开发实用LLM数据科学工具提供了更真实的测试环境，推动技术进步。

Abstract: A large portion of real-world data science tasks are complex and require
multi-hop web-based interactions: finding appropriate data available on the
internet, synthesizing real-time data of various modalities from different
locations, and producing summarized analyses. Existing web benchmarks often
focus on simplistic interactions, such as form submissions or e-commerce
transactions, and often do not require diverse tool-using capabilities required
for web based data science. Conversely, traditional data science benchmarks
typically concentrate on static, often textually bound datasets and do not
assess end-to-end workflows that encompass data acquisition, cleaning,
analysis, and insight generation. In response, we introduce WebDS, the first
end-to-end web-based data science benchmark. It comprises 870 web-based data
science tasks across 29 diverse websites from structured government data
portals to unstructured news media, challenging agents to perform complex,
multi-step operations requiring the use of tools and heterogeneous data formats
that better reflect the realities of modern data analytics. Evaluations of
current SOTA LLM agents indicate significant performance gaps in accomplishing
these tasks. For instance, Browser Use, which accomplishes 80% of tasks on Web
Voyager, successfully completes only 15% of tasks in WebDS, which our analysis
suggests is due to new failure modes like poor information grounding,
repetitive behavior and shortcut-taking that agents performing WebDS' tasks
display. By providing a more robust and realistic testing ground, WebDS sets
the stage for significant advances in the development of practically useful
LLM-based data science.

TL;DR: WarriorMath是一种缺陷感知的数学问题解决框架，通过针对性数据合成和渐进训练提升LLM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视LLM的特定失败模式，生成的问题对性能提升有限。

Method: 结合多专家LLM协作生成、批评和优化问题，并采用渐进学习框架。

Result: 在六个数学基准测试中平均提升12.57%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 缺陷感知的多专家框架能有效提升LLM的数学能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in solving mathematical problems, yet
their performance is often limited by the availability of high-quality, diverse
training data. Existing methods focus on augmenting datasets through rephrasing
or difficulty progression but overlook the specific failure modes of LLMs. This
results in synthetic questions that the model can already solve, providing
minimal performance gains. To address this, we propose WarriorMath, a
defect-aware framework for mathematical problem solving that integrates both
targeted data synthesis and progressive training. In the synthesis stage, we
employ multiple expert LLMs in a collaborative process to generate, critique,
and refine problems. Questions that base LLMs fail to solve are identified and
iteratively improved through expert-level feedback, producing high-quality,
defect-aware training data. In the training stage, we introduce a progressive
learning framework that iteratively fine-tunes the model using increasingly
challenging data tailored to its weaknesses. Experiments on six mathematical
benchmarks show that WarriorMath outperforms strong baselines by 12.57% on
average, setting a new state-of-the-art. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of a defect-aware, multi-expert framework for improving
mathematical ability.

TL;DR: 论文分析了2025年XAI挑战赛，探讨了在教育中结合轻量级LLM和符号推理以实现可解释AI的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在教育中的普及，透明性和可解释性需求增加，但现有hackathon很少直接解决教育场景中的XAI问题。

Method: 通过hackathon形式，要求参与者构建能回答学生问题并提供逻辑解释的QA系统，使用轻量级LLM或混合系统，并基于高质量数据集。

Result: 挑战赛成功结合了LLM与符号推理，为未来教育中的XAI系统提供了实用见解。

Conclusion: 该挑战赛为教育领域的可解释AI研究提供了新思路，并推动了透明性和信任度的提升。

Abstract: The growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into education has
intensified the need for transparency and interpretability. While hackathons
have long served as agile environments for rapid AI prototyping, few have
directly addressed eXplainable AI (XAI) in real-world educational contexts.
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the XAI Challenge 2025, a
hackathon-style competition jointly organized by Ho Chi Minh City University of
Technology (HCMUT) and the International Workshop on Trustworthiness and
Reliability in Neurosymbolic AI (TRNS-AI), held as part of the International
Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN 2025). The challenge tasked
participants with building Question-Answering (QA) systems capable of answering
student queries about university policies while generating clear, logic-based
natural language explanations. To promote transparency and trustworthiness,
solutions were required to use lightweight Large Language Models (LLMs) or
hybrid LLM-symbolic systems. A high-quality dataset was provided, constructed
via logic-based templates with Z3 validation and refined through expert student
review to ensure alignment with real-world academic scenarios. We describe the
challenge's motivation, structure, dataset construction, and evaluation
protocol. Situating the competition within the broader evolution of AI
hackathons, we argue that it represents a novel effort to bridge LLMs and
symbolic reasoning in service of explainability. Our findings offer actionable
insights for future XAI-centered educational systems and competitive research
initiatives.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新视角：通过部分相关知识唤醒LLMs的能力，解决了RAG系统中部分相关知识利用的挑战，并在KGQA任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统在利用部分相关知识时存在挑战，尤其是在知识库不完整的情况下。论文探索了LLMs通过部分相关知识自我唤醒的可能性。

Method: 使用黄金推理路径中的三元组及其变体构建部分相关知识，并通过理论分析和实验验证唤醒效应。

Result: 在KGQA数据集上的实验表明，基于唤醒的方法优于传统嵌入相似性方法，尤其是在实体链接失败的情况下。

Conclusion: 部分相关知识可以唤醒LLMs的能力，为RAG系统提供了新的解决方案，尤其在知识库不完整时表现更优。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows impressive performance by
supplementing and substituting parametric knowledge in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Retrieved knowledge can be divided into three types: explicit answer
evidence, implicit answer clue, and insufficient answer context which can be
further categorized into totally irrelevant and partially relevant information.
Effectively utilizing partially relevant knowledge remains a key challenge for
RAG systems, especially in incomplete knowledge base retrieval. Contrary to the
conventional view, we propose a new perspective: LLMs can be awakened via
partially relevant knowledge already embedded in LLMs. To comprehensively
investigate this phenomenon, the triplets located in the gold reasoning path
and their variants are used to construct partially relevant knowledge by
removing the path that contains the answer. We provide theoretical analysis of
the awakening effect in LLMs and support our hypothesis with experiments on two
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) Question Answering (QA) datasets. Furthermore, we
present a new task, Unseen Entity KGQA, simulating real-world challenges where
entity linking fails due to KG incompleteness. Our awakening-based approach
demonstrates greater efficacy in practical applications, outperforms
traditional methods that rely on embedding-based similarity which are prone to
returning noisy information.

*Chenming Tang,Yutong Yang,Yunfang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KEDAS提出了一种知识编辑对齐方法，通过多样增强和自适应推理提升大语言模型的知识编辑能力，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识编辑方法依赖参数级编辑或检索方法，效果有限，需更高效的方法。

Method: KEDAS结合低秩适应、多样编辑增强和自适应推理机制，动态选择推理路径。

Result: 在36个案例中35个表现最佳，编辑成功率和通用任务性能均显著提升。

Conclusion: KEDAS为知识编辑对齐提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to modify outdated knowledge in large language models
(LLMs) efficiently while retaining their powerful capabilities. Most existing
methods rely on either parameter-level editing or retrieval-based approaches.
In this work, we propose Knowledge Editing alignment with Diverse Augmentation
and Self-adaptive inference (KEDAS) to better align LLMs with knowledge
editing. In the alignment phase, LLMs learn to apply in-context edited
knowledge via low-rank adaptation. During editing, we design a diverse edit
augmentation technique to improve the recall of edits. After that, a
self-adaptive post-alignment inference mechanism is proposed, in which a
filter-based smart retriever is employed to perform a dynamic selection of
inference routing. Specifically, irrelevant queries will go through the
original pre-alignment model directly, while relevant ones, together with their
related edits, go through the model with aligned adapters activated. In
experiments, KEDAS secures the highest overall performance scores in 35 out of
36 cases across four datasets with three LLMs on three settings, surpassing its
strong knowledge editing alignment counterpart by about 19.8 harmonic mean
scores of edit success, locality and portability and outperforming both
parameter editing and retrieval-based baselines significantly. Analysis of
computational cost and performance on general tasks further validates the
robustness and efficiency of KEDAS, indicating that it presents an ideal
paradigm of knowledge editing alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量QA数据集稀缺且昂贵的问题，为领域特定LLM提供高效数据生成方法。

Method: 结合文档处理、分段、CoT推理和结构化导出，生成QA-COT数据集，并通过多维控制机制提升多样性和相关性。

Result: D-SCoRE生成的QA数据集在多个领域测试中表现优于人工标注数据集，且生成速度快。

Conclusion: D-SCoRE为领域特定LLM提供了一种高效、可扩展的QA数据集生成方法。

Abstract: The scarcity and high cost of high-quality question-answering (QA) datasets
hinder supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for domain-specific large language models
(LLMs). To address this, we introduce D-SCoRE, a training-free pipeline that
utilizes LLMs and prompt engineering to produce diverse, high-quality QA
datasets from arbitrary textual sources. D-SCoRE integrates
$\textbf{D}$ocument-centric processing, $\textbf{S}$egmentation, $\textbf{Co}$T
$\textbf{R}$easoning, and structured $\textbf{E}$xport to generate QA-COT
datasets tailored for domain-aware SFT. Multi-dimensional control mechanisms,
such as semantic role transformation, question type balancing, and
counterfactual materials, enhance diversity and relevance, overcoming
limitations of existing QA generation. LLMs fine-tuned on D-SCoRE-generated QA
datasets, and human-annotated QA datasets (SQuAD, Covid-QA) are evaluated on
SQuADShifts and Covid-QA test sets, with D-SCoRE outperforming across most
domains. D-SCoRE generates six QA-CoT pairs with four-option counterfactual
materials per 100-200-word text in 90 seconds using an 8B LLM on consumer-grade
hardware. Its simplicity and scalability enable efficient QA generation and
high-performance fine-tuning across domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型训练数据稀缺且多样性不足的问题。

Method: 通过构建知识图谱（KP graph），结合路径采样和扩散合成技术，生成多样化的QA数据。

Result: 合成的LinkQA数据集（50B tokens）显著提升了模型性能（MMLU和CMMLU平均提升11.51%）。

Conclusion: LinkSyn和LinkQA有效解决了数据稀缺问题，为大语言模型训练提供了新方法。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) struggles with the scarcity
of high-quality, diverse training data. To address this limitation, we propose
LinkSyn, a novel knowledge point (KP) graph-based synthesis framework that
enables flexible control over discipline and difficulty distributions while
balancing KP coverage and popularity. LinkSyn extracts KPs from
question-answering (QA) seed data and constructs a KP graph to synthesize
diverse QA data from multiple seeds strongly linked by KPs and sampled from
graph walks. Specifically, LinkSyn incorporates (1) a knowledge distribution
value function to guide the adjustment of path sampling probability and balance
KP coverage and popularity during graph walks; (2) diffusion-based synthesis
via DeepSeek-R1 by leveraging multiple seeds with dense logical associations
along each path; and (3) high-difficulty QA enhancement within given
disciplines by flexible difficulty adjustments. By executing LinkSyn, we
synthesize LinkQA, a diverse multi-disciplinary QA dataset with 50B tokens.
Extensive experiments on Llama-3 8B demonstrate that continual pre-training
with LinkQA yields an average improvement of $\mathbf{11.51\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU, establishing new SOTA results. LinkQA consistently enhances performance
across model size and initial FLOPs scales.

Motivation: 高质量知识密集型训练数据的稀缺限制了大型语言模型的发展，传统语料库提供的信息有限，且现有方法在QA数据扩展性和知识多样性方面存在挑战。

Method: 提出了一种多样化合成管道，包括从异构来源筛选种子数据、利用DeepSeek-R1进行STEM领域多级合成和高难度合成、通过DeepSeek-V3优化答案质量，并在预训练和微调之间的中间阶段使用BoostQA。

Result: 实验表明，使用BoostQA训练的Llama-3 8B模型在MMLU和CMMLU上平均提升了12.74%，并在12个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: BoostQA不仅显著提升了模型性能，还展示了良好的可扩展性，为知识密集型数据合成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality, knowledge-intensive training data hinders the
development of large language models (LLMs), as traditional corpora provide
limited information. Previous studies have synthesized and integrated
corpora-dependent question-answering (QA) data to improve model performance but
face challenges in QA data scalability and knowledge diversity, particularly in
cross-domain contexts. Furthermore, leveraging our designed discipline and
difficulty annotation system, we probe model deficiencies in STEM disciplines
and high-difficulty data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel
diversified pipeline to synthesize BoostQA, a 100B-token large-scale QA
dataset. Our synthesis framework: (1) curates seed data from heterogeneous
sources; (2) utilizes DeepSeek-R1 to implement STEM-focused multi-grade
synthesis to boost data diversity and high-difficulty synthesis to mitigate
difficulty degradation; (3) refines answers via DeepSeek-V3 to improve output
quality. We utilize BoostQA in mid-training, a mid-stage between pre-training
and post-training, to optimize domain-specific knowledge acquisition and
enhance data quality. Our method enables Llama-3 8B, mid-trained on a 40B-token
dataset, to achieve an average improvement of $\mathbf{12.74\%}$ on MMLU and
CMMLU and establish SOTA average performance across 12 benchmarks. BoostQA also
demonstrates robust scalability, with performance consistently improving as
model size, data volume, and initial FLOPs scale.

At its core, the system employs specialized agents - Researcher, Reviewer,
Writer, and Retriever - that collaborate to analyze data and produce
comprehensive reports. These agents learn from real professional consultants'
presentation materials at Amazon through in-context learning to replicate
professional analytical methodologies. The framework executes a multi-step
process: querying databases, analyzing data, generating insights, creating
visualizations, and composing market reports. We also introduce a novel
LLM-based evaluation system for assessing report quality, which shows alignment
with expert human evaluations. Building on these evaluations, we implement an
iterative improvement mechanism that optimizes report quality through automated
review cycles. Experimental results show that report quality can be improved by
both automated review cycles and consultants' unstructured knowledge. In
experimental validation, our framework generates detailed 6-page reports in 7
minutes at a cost of approximately \$1. Our work could be an important step to
automatically create affordable market insights.

Result: BADF能够全面映射和分析偏见关联，为LLM中的偏见研究提供了可扩展工具。

Conclusion: BADF提升了开放式生成中偏见的理解，并为识别和分析LLM偏见提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Social biases embedded in Large Language Models (LLMs) raise critical
concerns, resulting in representational harms -- unfair or distorted portrayals
of demographic groups -- that may be expressed in subtle ways through generated
language. Existing evaluation methods often depend on predefined
identity-concept associations, limiting their ability to surface new or
unexpected forms of bias. In this work, we present the Bias Association
Discovery Framework (BADF), a systematic approach for extracting both known and
previously unrecognized associations between demographic identities and
descriptive concepts from open-ended LLM outputs. Through comprehensive
experiments spanning multiple models and diverse real-world contexts, BADF
enables robust mapping and analysis of the varied concepts that characterize
demographic identities. Our findings advance the understanding of biases in
open-ended generation and provide a scalable tool for identifying and analyzing
bias associations in LLMs. Data, code, and results are available at

Motivation: LLMs在多跳问答任务中表现不足，因无法捕捉深层实体关系。

Result: 在标准MQA基准测试中表现优异，媲美DeepSeek-R1。

Conclusion: ORACLE生成更逻辑且可解释的推理链，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success in question answering,
exhibit limitations in complex multi-hop question answering (MQA) tasks that
necessitate non-linear, structured reasoning. This limitation stems from their
inability to adequately capture deep conceptual relationships between entities.
To overcome this challenge, we present **ORACLE** (**O**ntology-driven
**R**easoning **A**nd **C**hain for **L**ogical **E**ucidation), a
training-free framework that combines LLMs' generative capabilities with the
structural benefits of knowledge graphs. Our approach operates through three
stages: (1) dynamic construction of question-specific knowledge ontologies
using LLMs, (2) transformation of these ontologies into First-Order Logic
reasoning chains, and (3) systematic decomposition of the original query into
logically coherent sub-questions. Experimental results on several standard MQA
benchmarks show that our framework achieves highly competitive performance,
rivaling current state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-R1. Detailed analyses
further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while demonstrating that
our method generates more logical and interpretable reasoning chains than
existing approaches.

Motivation: 现有SFT方法依赖未过滤的数据集，导致计算成本高且性能不佳。传统方法仅基于样本难度或梯度影响选择数据，未能平衡复杂推理与优化效果。

Method: 提出Difficulty-Influence Quadrant (DIQ)策略，优先选择高难度-高梯度影响的样本，以平衡复杂推理与优化效果。

Result: 实验表明，DIQ仅需1%的数据即可匹配全数据集性能，使用10%数据时优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DIQ通过平衡样本难度与梯度影响，显著提升了医学推理任务的效率和质量。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) plays a pivotal role in adapting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to specialized domains such as medical reasoning. However,
existing SFT practices often rely on unfiltered datasets that contain redundant
and low-quality samples, leading to substantial computational costs and
suboptimal performance. Although existing methods attempt to alleviate this
problem by selecting data based on sample difficulty, defined by knowledge and
reasoning complexity, they overlook each sample's optimization utility
reflected in its gradient. Interestingly, we find that gradient-based influence
alone favors easy-to-optimize samples that cause large parameter shifts but
lack deep reasoning chains, while difficulty alone selects noisy or overly
complex cases that fail to guide stable optimization. Based on this
observation, we propose a data selection strategy, Difficulty-Influence
Quadrant (DIQ), which prioritizes samples in the high-difficulty-high-influence
quadrant to balance complex clinical reasoning with substantial gradient
influence, enabling efficient medical reasoning with minimal fine-tuning data.
Furthermore, Human and LLM-as-a-judge evaluations show that DIQ-selected
subsets demonstrate higher data quality and generate clinical reasoning that is
more aligned with expert practices in differential diagnosis, safety check, and
evidence citation, as DIQ emphasizes samples that foster expert-like reasoning
patterns. Extensive experiments on medical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate
that DIQ enables models fine-tuned on only 1% of selected data to match
full-dataset performance, while using 10% consistently outperforms the
baseline, highlighting the superiority of principled data selection over
brute-force scaling. The code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在自然语言生成中表现出色，但在结构化领域（如源代码）中应用仍具挑战性，因为编程语言需要遵循严格的语法和语义规则。

Method: 提出语法感知的扩散框架，通过选择性破坏AST子树中的代码片段，而非随机掩码单个标记，以保留语法结构和长程依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，语法感知的破坏显著提高了语法正确性、重构准确性和对未见代码模式的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将结构信息融入扩散模型训练具有潜力，语法引导的去噪是改进代码生成任务中扩散模型的有效方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based language models have opened new
possibilities for controllable and bidirectional sequence generation. These
models provide an alternative to traditional autoregressive approaches by
framing text generation as an iterative denoising process. However, applying
diffusion models to structured domains such as source code remains a
significant challenge. Programming languages differ from natural language in
that they follow strict syntactic and semantic rules, with hierarchical
organization that must be preserved for correctness. Standard token-level
corruption techniques used during training often ignore this structure, which
may hinder the model's ability to learn meaningful representations of code. To
address this limitation, we propose a syntax-aware diffusion framework that
incorporates structural priors from Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) into the
denoising process. Instead of masking individual tokens at random, we
selectively corrupt syntactically meaningful code spans derived from AST
subtrees. This enables the model to reconstruct programs in a way that respects
grammatical boundaries and captures long-range dependencies. Experimental
results demonstrate that syntax-aware corruption significantly improves
syntactic correctness, reconstruction accuracy, and generalization to unseen
code patterns. These findings highlight the potential of incorporating
structural information into diffusion-based training and suggest that
syntax-guided denoising is a promising direction for advancing diffusion-based
language models in code generation tasks.

biomedical literature. In this work, we present our participation in the 13th
edition of the BioASQ challenge, which involves biomedical semantic
question-answering for Task 13b and biomedical question-answering for
developing topics for the Synergy task. We deploy a selection of open-source

majority voting system combines their output to determine the final answer for
Yes/No questions, while for list and factoid type questions, the union of their
answers in used. We evaluated 13 state-of-the-art open source LLMs, exploring
all possible model combinations to contribute to the final answer, resulting in
tailored LLM pipelines for each question type. Our findings provide valuable

Abstract: In the Indian subcontinent, Telugu, one of India's six classical languages,
is the most widely spoken Dravidian Language. Despite its 96 million speaker
base worldwide, Telugu remains underrepresented in the global NLP and Machine
Learning landscape, mainly due to lack of high-quality annotated resources.
This work introduces TeSent, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for sentiment
classification, a key text classification problem, in Telugu. TeSent not only
provides ground truth labels for the sentences, but also supplements with
provisions for evaluating explainability and fairness, two critical
requirements in modern-day machine learning tasks. We scraped Telugu texts
covering multiple domains from various social media platforms, news websites
and web-blogs to preprocess and generate 26,150 sentences, and developed a
custom-built annotation platform and a carefully crafted annotation protocol
for collecting the ground truth labels along with their human-annotated
rationales. We then fine-tuned several SOTA pre-trained models in two ways:
with rationales, and without rationales. Further, we provide a detailed
plausibility and faithfulness evaluation suite, which exploits the rationales,
for six widely used post-hoc explainers applied on the trained models. Lastly,
we curate TeEEC, Equity Evaluation Corpus in Telugu, a corpus to evaluate
fairness of Telugu sentiment and emotion related NLP tasks, and provide a
fairness evaluation suite for the trained classifier models. Our experimental
results suggest that training with rationales may improve model accuracy,
reduce bias in models, and make the explainers' output more aligned to human
reasoning.

Conclusion: 结论指出，若不加以控制，这种同质化可能削弱集体智慧和适应能力的认知基础。

Abstract: Cognitive diversity, reflected in variations of language, perspective, and
reasoning, is essential to creativity and collective intelligence. This
diversity is rich and grounded in culture, history, and individual experience.
Yet as large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in people's lives,
they risk standardizing language and reasoning. This Review synthesizes
evidence across linguistics, cognitive, and computer science to show how LLMs
reflect and reinforce dominant styles while marginalizing alternative voices
and reasoning strategies. We examine how their design and widespread use
contribute to this effect by mirroring patterns in their training data and
amplifying convergence as all people increasingly rely on the same models
across contexts. Unchecked, this homogenization risks flattening the cognitive
landscapes that drive collective intelligence and adaptability.

Conclusion: 研究表明理论驱动的LLM集成在教育中具有潜力，能够提供自适应且基于原则的教学支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present new opportunities for creating
pedagogical agents that engage in meaningful dialogue to support student
learning. However, the current use of LLM systems like ChatGPT in classrooms
often lacks the solid theoretical foundation found in earlier intelligent
tutoring systems. To bridge this gap, we propose a framework that combines
Evidence-Centered Design with Social Cognitive Theory for adaptive scaffolding
in LLM-based agents focused on STEM+C learning. We illustrate this framework
with Inquizzitor, an LLM-based formative assessment agent that integrates
human-AI hybrid intelligence and provides feedback grounded in cognitive
science principles. Our findings show that Inquizzitor delivers high-quality
assessment and interaction aligned with core learning theories, offering
teachers effective guidance that students value. This research underscores the
potential for theory-driven LLM integration in education, highlighting the
ability of these systems to provide adaptive and principled instruction.

TL;DR: MOPrompt是一种多目标进化优化框架，旨在同时优化提示的准确性和上下文大小，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动设计提示复杂且耗时，自动提示优化需平衡任务性能和上下文大小，现有方法多关注单一目标。

Method: 采用多目标进化优化（EMO）框架，映射提示解决方案的帕累托前沿，权衡上下文大小与性能。

Result: 在葡萄牙语情感分析任务中，MOPrompt显著优于基线，Sabiazinho模型下实现相同峰值准确率（0.97）但减少31%令牌长度。

Conclusion: MOPrompt为实际应用中部署大型语言模型提供了关键工具，有效平衡效率与效果。

Abstract: Prompt engineering is crucial for unlocking the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs). Still, since manual prompt design is often complex,
non-intuitive, and time-consuming, automatic prompt optimization has emerged as
a research area. However, a significant challenge in prompt optimization is
managing the inherent trade-off between task performance, such as accuracy, and
context size. Most existing automated methods focus on a single objective,
typically performance, thereby failing to explore the critical spectrum of
efficiency and effectiveness. This paper introduces the MOPrompt, a novel
Multi-objective Evolutionary Optimization (EMO) framework designed to optimize
prompts for both accuracy and context size (measured in tokens) simultaneously.
Our framework maps the Pareto front of prompt solutions, presenting
practitioners with a set of trade-offs between context size and performance, a
crucial tool for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in real-world
applications. We evaluate MOPrompt on a sentiment analysis task in Portuguese,
using Gemma-2B and Sabiazinho-3 as evaluation models. Our findings show that
MOPrompt substantially outperforms the baseline framework. For the Sabiazinho
model, MOPrompt identifies a prompt that achieves the same peak accuracy (0.97)
as the best baseline solution, but with a 31% reduction in token length.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法忽视提示的结构异质性，PromptAnatomy旨在填补这一空白，提供更可靠的对抗鲁棒性评估。

Method: 提出PromptAnatomy框架，将提示分解为功能组件，使用ComPerturb方法选择性扰动，并引入PPL过滤机制。

Result: 在多个数据集和LLMs上，ComPerturb实现了最先进的攻击成功率，验证了提示结构感知的重要性。

Conclusion: 提示结构感知和受控扰动对LLMs的对抗鲁棒性评估至关重要，PromptAnatomy为此提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Prompt-based adversarial attacks have become an effective means to assess the
robustness of large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often
treat prompts as monolithic text, overlooking their structural
heterogeneity-different prompt components contribute unequally to adversarial
robustness. Prior works like PromptRobust assume prompts are value-neutral, but
our analysis reveals that complex, domain-specific prompts with rich structures
have components with differing vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we
introduce PromptAnatomy, an automated framework that dissects prompts into
functional components and generates diverse, interpretable adversarial examples
by selectively perturbing each component using our proposed method, ComPerturb.
To ensure linguistic plausibility and mitigate distribution shifts, we further
incorporate a perplexity (PPL)-based filtering mechanism. As a complementary
resource, we annotate four public instruction-tuning datasets using the
PromptAnatomy framework, verified through human review. Extensive experiments
across these datasets and five advanced LLMs demonstrate that ComPerturb
achieves state-of-the-art attack success rates. Ablation studies validate the
complementary benefits of prompt dissection and PPL filtering. Our results
underscore the importance of prompt structure awareness and controlled
perturbation for reliable adversarial robustness evaluation in LLMs. Code and
data are available at https://github.com/Yujiaaaaa/PACP.

*Maziyar Panahi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OpenMed NER 是一种开源、领域适应的转换器模型，通过轻量级领域自适应预训练（DAPT）和参数高效的LoRA技术，在多个生物医学NER基准测试中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生物医学领域命名实体识别（NER）中高性能与计算效率的平衡问题，同时满足数据保护和AI法规要求。

Method: 结合DAPT和LoRA技术，在公开的生物医学数据集上进行预训练和微调，仅更新少量参数。

Result: 在12个生物医学NER基准测试中，10个达到新的最佳性能，尤其在疾病和化学实体识别上表现突出。

Conclusion: OpenMed NER 展示了开源模型在性能和效率上的优势，同时符合数据保护和法规要求。

Abstract: Named-entity recognition (NER) is fundamental to extracting structured
information from the >80% of healthcare data that resides in unstructured
clinical notes and biomedical literature. Despite recent advances with large
language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity
types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant
challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted
transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT)
with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs
cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced,
publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes
(PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA
backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which
updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12
established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and
species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of
these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our
models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical
benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger
improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and
clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted
open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is
achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a
single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively
licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate
compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI
Act.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多语言作者归属问题，旨在区分人类与多种大语言模型（LLM）生成的文本，并研究了18种语言和8种生成器的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）生成文本的逼真度提升，区分机器生成文本（MGT）与人类文本变得困难，而现有研究多局限于单语言（英语）场景，忽视了多语言的实际需求。

Method: 研究聚焦18种语言和8种生成器（7种LLM和人类作者），评估单语言作者归属方法在多语言环境中的适用性、跨语言迁移能力及生成器对归属性能的影响。

Result: 结果显示，部分单语言方法可适应多语言场景，但在跨语言家族迁移时存在显著局限性，突显多语言作者归属的复杂性。

Conclusion: 多语言作者归属仍需更鲁棒的方法以匹配现实场景，当前方法在跨语言多样性上表现不足。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) have reached human-like fluency and
coherence, distinguishing machine-generated text (MGT) from human-written
content becomes increasingly difficult. While early efforts in MGT detection
have focused on binary classification, the growing landscape and diversity of
LLMs require a more fine-grained yet challenging authorship attribution (AA),
i.e., being able to identify the precise generator (LLM or human) behind a
text. However, AA remains nowadays confined to a monolingual setting, with
English being the most investigated one, overlooking the multilingual nature
and usage of modern LLMs. In this work, we introduce the problem of
Multilingual Authorship Attribution, which involves attributing texts to human
or multiple LLM generators across diverse languages. Focusing on 18 languages
-- covering multiple families and writing scripts -- and 8 generators (7 LLMs
and the human-authored class), we investigate the multilingual suitability of
monolingual AA methods, their cross-lingual transferability, and the impact of
generators on attribution performance. Our results reveal that while certain
monolingual AA methods can be adapted to multilingual settings, significant
limitations and challenges remain, particularly in transferring across diverse
language families, underscoring the complexity of multilingual AA and the need
for more robust approaches to better match real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出CUPID基准，评估LLMs在动态偏好下的个性化能力，发现现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类偏好是动态且上下文相关的，但现有LLMs假设偏好是静态的，需改进以实现更个性化的交互。

Method: 引入CUPID基准，包含756个人类与LLM交互会话，评估LLMs从多轮反馈中推断偏好的能力。

Result: 评估10种LLMs，发现其在偏好推断和相关上下文识别上表现差（精度<50%，召回率<65%）。

Conclusion: 需提升LLMs的上下文个性化能力，CUPID可作为改进资源。

Abstract: Personalization of Large Language Models (LLMs) often assumes users hold
static preferences that reflect globally in all tasks. In reality, humans hold
dynamic preferences that change depending on the context. As users interact
with an LLM in various contexts, they naturally reveal their contextual
preferences, which a model must infer and apply in future contexts to ensure
alignment. To assess this, we introduce CUPID, a benchmark of 756 human-curated
interaction session histories between users and LLM-based chat assistants. In
each interaction session, the user provides a request in a specific context and
expresses their preference through multi-turn feedback. Given a new user
request and prior interaction sessions, our benchmark assesses whether LLMs can
infer the preference relevant to this request and generate a response that
satisfies this preference. With CUPID, we evaluated 10 open and proprietary
LLMs, revealing that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to infer preferences from
multi-turn interactions and fail to discern what previous context is relevant
to a new request -- under 50% precision and 65% recall. Our work highlights the
need to advance LLM capabilities for more contextually personalized
interactions and proposes CUPID as a resource to drive these improvements.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BiPRM提出了一种双向评估范式，通过结合右到左（R2L）评估流，提升过程奖励模型（PRM）的推理质量，显著优于单向基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM采用单向左到右（L2R）评估，无法利用全局上下文验证早期步骤的合理性，BiPRM旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BiPRM通过反向推理轨迹的提示修改实现R2L评估，无需额外参数或延迟，保持高效和兼容性。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，BiPRM在三种骨干模型和PRM目标下均优于单向基线，最高提升31.9%。

Conclusion: BiPRM展示了高效性、鲁棒性和广泛适用性，为过程奖励建模提供了新方向。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) by assigning fine-grained
scores to intermediate reasoning steps within a solution trajectory. However,
existing PRMs predominantly adopt a unidirectional left-to-right (L2R)
evaluation paradigm, which limits their ability to leverage global context,
making it challenging to verify the consistency of earlier steps based on later
ones. In light of these challenges, we propose a novel bidirectional evaluation
paradigm, named Bidirectional Process Reward Model (BiPRM). BiPRM seamlessly
incorporates a parallel right-to-left (R2L) evaluation stream alongside the
conventional L2R flow, enabling later reasoning steps to help assess earlier
ones in real time. Notably, the built-in R2L evaluation is implemented solely
through prompt modifications that reverse the original reasoning trajectory,
without any additional parameters or inference latency introduced. This ensures
BiPRM remains both efficient and broadly compatible with existing PRM studies.
We conduct extensive experiments on two mathematical reasoning benchmarks using
samples generated by three different policy models. Our method, BiPRM, is
evaluated across three backbones and three distinct PRM objectives. Across all
settings, BiPRM consistently outperforms unidirectional baselines, achieving up
to a 31.9% improvement in stepwise reward evaluation. Generally, our results
highlight BiPRM's effectiveness, robustness, and general applicability,
offering a promising new direction for process-based reward modeling.

Motivation: 当前RAG方法在生成过程中未能充分利用知识，参数化知识与检索知识的协同作用有限，甚至可能误导生成。

Method: 提出CoCoA-zero（多代理RAG框架）进行条件知识归纳和答案推理，并基于此开发CoCoA（长链训练策略）以微调LLM，增强知识整合能力。

Result: 实验显示CoCoA-zero和CoCoA在开放领域和多跳QA任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: CoCoA框架显著提升了RAG中知识协同利用的效果，为知识密集型任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising framework for
enhancing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in
knowledge-intensive tasks. Despite its advantages, current RAG methods often
struggle to *fully exploit knowledge during generation*. In particular, the
synergy between the model's internal parametric knowledge and external
retrieved knowledge remains limited. Retrieved contents may sometimes mislead
generation, while certain generated content can guide the model toward more
accurate outputs. In this work, we propose Collaborative Chain-of-Agents, a
framework designed to enhance explicitly synergy over both parametric and
retrieved knowledge. Specifically, we first introduce CoCoA-zero, a multi-agent
RAG framework that first performs conditional knowledge induction and then
reasons answers. Building on this, we develop CoCoA, a long-chain training
strategy that synthesizes extended multi-agent reasoning trajectories from
CoCoA-zero to fine-tune the LLM. This strategy enhances the model's capability
to explicitly integrate and jointly leverage parametric and retrieved
knowledge. Experiments results show that CoCoA-zero and CoCoA achieve superior
performance on open-domain and multi-hop QA tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言处理中表现出色，但易受无关信息影响。此前研究关注语义泄漏，本文首次提出表达泄漏现象，即模型生成与输入无关的情感化表达，填补了研究空白。

Method: 构建了基准数据集和自动生成方案，提出与人类判断一致的自动评估流程，加速模型分析。实验分析了不同参数规模的LLM家族，并测试了提示对表达泄漏的影响。

Result: 模型规模扩大可减少表达泄漏，但需在模型构建中特别处理；提示无法缓解表达泄漏；负向情感提示比正向情感更易引发表达泄漏。

Conclusion: 表达泄漏是LLM中需特别关注的问题，模型规模扩大和构建优化可缓解，但提示无效。负向情感提示的干扰更强，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced natural language processing (NLP)
skills such as through next-token prediction and self-attention, but their
ability to integrate broad context also makes them prone to incorporating
irrelevant information. Prior work has focused on semantic leakage, bias
introduced by semantically irrelevant context. In this paper, we introduce
expression leakage, a novel phenomenon where LLMs systematically generate
sentimentally charged expressions that are semantically unrelated to the input
context. To analyse the expression leakage, we collect a benchmark dataset
along with a scheme to automatically generate a dataset from free-form text
from common-crawl. In addition, we propose an automatic evaluation pipeline
that correlates well with human judgment, which accelerates the benchmarking by
decoupling from the need of annotation for each analysed model. Our experiments
show that, as the model scales in the parameter space, the expression leakage
reduces within the same LLM family. On the other hand, we demonstrate that
expression leakage mitigation requires specific care during the model building
process, and cannot be mitigated by prompting. In addition, our experiments
indicate that, when negative sentiment is injected in the prompt, it disrupts
the generation process more than the positive sentiment, causing a higher
expression leakage rate.

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications
highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in
English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to
the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present
CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality
safety datasets across multiple languages. Our approach introduces a four-stage
synthetic data generation and filtering pipeline: cultural data segregation,
cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This
pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the
Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct
languages: Arabic, German, Spanish, French, Hindi, Japanese, Thai, and Chinese.
The resulting dataset, Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-Multilingual-v1,
comprises 386,661 samples in 9 languages and facilitates the training of
Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-Multilingual-8B-v1 via LoRA-based fine-tuning.
The final model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multilingual
content safety benchmarks. We also benchmark the latest open LLMs on
multilingual safety and observe that these LLMs are more prone to give unsafe
responses when prompted in non-English languages. This work represents a
significant step toward closing the safety gap in multilingual LLMs by enabling
the development of culturally aware safety guard models.

Motivation: 多轮对话中用户偏好的准确提取面临标注困难和模型训练复杂的问题，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 构建新数据格式，将对话分为历史偏好和单轮对话，利用GPT4预定义偏好槽并随机采样生成高质量数据集。

Conclusion: IterChat框架有效解决了多轮偏好提取的标注和训练难题，提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Identifying user preferences in dialogue systems is a pivotal aspect of
providing satisfying services. Current research shows that using large language
models (LLMs) to fine-tune a task-specific preference extractor yields
excellent results in terms of accuracy and generalization. However, the primary
challenge stems from the inherent difficulty in obtaining high-quality labeled
multi-turn dialogue data. Accurately tracking user preference transitions
across turns not only demands intensive domain expertise and contextual
consistency maintenance for annotators (termed \textbf{``Annotating
Disaster''}) but also complicates model training due to error propagation in
sequential dependency learning. Inspired by the observation that multi-turn
preference extraction can be decomposed into iterative executions of one-turn
extraction processes. We propose a novel dialogue data generation framework
named \textbf{IterChat}. First, we construct a new data format that categorizes
the dialogue data into attributed historical preferences and one-turn
dialogues. This reduces the probability of annotation errors and improves
annotation efficiency. Then, to generate a high-quality and diverse dialogue
dataset, we adopt GPT4 to pre-define the preference slots in the target
preference extractor task and then randomly sample the subset of the slots and
their corresponding schema values to create the dialogue datasets. Experimental
results indicate that fine-tuning or only few-shot prompting with the new
dialogue format yields superior performance compared to the original multi-turn
dialogues. Additionally, the new data format improves annotator efficiency with
a win rate of 28.4\% higher than the original multi-turn dialogues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将标记级测量聚合为标量分数，忽略了异常的位置信息，导致对局部对抗性扰动的检测失败。

Method: 提出TDT方法，将标记级差异视为时间序列信号，应用连续小波变换生成二维时间-尺度表示，捕捉统计异常的位置和语言尺度。

Result: 在RAID基准测试中，TDT的AUROC达到0.855（比最佳基线提高7.1%），在对抗性任务中表现稳健（HART Level 2攻击下AUROC提高14.1%）。

Conclusion: TDT确立了AI生成文本的非平稳性特征，并证明保留时间动态对稳健检测至关重要。

Abstract: The field of AI-generated text detection has evolved from supervised
classification to zero-shot statistical analysis. However, current approaches
share a fundamental limitation: they aggregate token-level measurements into
scalar scores, discarding positional information about where anomalies occur.
Our empirical analysis reveals that AI-generated text exhibits significant
non-stationarity, statistical properties vary by 73.8\% more between text
segments compared to human writing. This discovery explains why existing
detectors fail against localized adversarial perturbations that exploit this
overlooked characteristic. We introduce Temporal Discrepancy Tomography (TDT),
a novel detection paradigm that preserves positional information by
reformulating detection as a signal processing task. TDT treats token-level
discrepancies as a time-series signal and applies Continuous Wavelet Transform
to generate a two-dimensional time-scale representation, capturing both the
location and linguistic scale of statistical anomalies. On the RAID benchmark,
TDT achieves 0.855 AUROC (7.1\% improvement over the best baseline). More
importantly, TDT demonstrates robust performance on adversarial tasks, with
14.1\% AUROC improvement on HART Level 2 paraphrasing attacks. Despite its
sophisticated analysis, TDT maintains practical efficiency with only 13\%
computational overhead. Our work establishes non-stationarity as a fundamental
characteristic of AI-generated text and demonstrates that preserving temporal
dynamics is essential for robust detection.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
yet their propensity for hallucination, generating plausible but factually
incorrect or fabricated content, remains a critical challenge. This report
provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM hallucinations, beginning with a
formal definition and a theoretical framework that posits its inherent
inevitability in computable LLMs, irrespective of architecture or training. It
explores core distinctions, differentiating between intrinsic (contradicting
input context) and extrinsic (inconsistent with training data or reality), as
well as factuality (absolute correctness) and faithfulness (adherence to
input). The report then details specific manifestations, including factual
errors, contextual and logical inconsistencies, temporal disorientation,
ethical violations, and task-specific hallucinations across domains like code
generation and multimodal applications. It analyzes the underlying causes,
categorizing them into data-related issues, model-related factors, and
prompt-related influences. Furthermore, the report examines cognitive and human
factors influencing hallucination perception, surveys evaluation benchmarks and
metrics for detection, and outlines architectural and systemic mitigation
strategies. Finally, it introduces web-based resources for monitoring LLM
releases and performance. This report underscores the complex, multifaceted
nature of LLM hallucinations and emphasizes that, given their theoretical
inevitability, future efforts must focus on robust detection, mitigation, and
continuous human oversight for responsible and reliable deployment in critical
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有希伯来语NLP基准主要关注形态句法任务，缺乏语义理解维度，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 设计了新的标注指南、众包协议和评估指标，构建了包含30,147个问答对的HeQ数据集。

Result: 发现标准评估指标（如F1和EM）不适用于希伯来语，提出了改进方法，并显示形态句法任务与MRC任务表现相关性低。

Conclusion: HeQ的开发揭示了形态丰富语言在NLU中的挑战，推动了希伯来语及其他类似语言的NLU模型发展。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for Hebrew Natural Language Processing (NLP) focus mainly
on morpho-syntactic tasks, neglecting the semantic dimension of language
understanding. To bridge this gap, we set out to deliver a Hebrew Machine
Reading Comprehension (MRC) dataset, where MRC is to be realized as extractive
Question Answering. The morphologically rich nature of Hebrew poses a challenge
to this endeavor: the indeterminacy and non-transparency of span boundaries in
morphologically complex forms lead to annotation inconsistencies,
disagreements, and flaws in standard evaluation metrics.
  To remedy this, we devise a novel set of guidelines, a controlled
crowdsourcing protocol, and revised evaluation metrics that are suitable for
the morphologically rich nature of the language. Our resulting benchmark, HeQ
(Hebrew QA), features 30,147 diverse question-answer pairs derived from both
Hebrew Wikipedia articles and Israeli tech news. Our empirical investigation
reveals that standard evaluation metrics such as F1 scores and Exact Match (EM)
are not appropriate for Hebrew (and other MRLs), and we propose a relevant
enhancement.
  In addition, our experiments show low correlation between models' performance
on morpho-syntactic tasks and on MRC, which suggests that models designed for
the former might underperform on semantics-heavy tasks. The development and
exploration of HeQ illustrate some of the challenges MRLs pose in natural
language understanding (NLU), fostering progression towards more and better NLU
models for Hebrew and other MRLs.

*Yang Zhao,Chengxiao Dai,Wei Zhuo,Tan Chuan Fu,Yue Xiu,Dusit Niyato,Jonathan Z. Low,Eugene Ho Hong Zhuang,Daren Zong Loong Tan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AgenticT$^2$S是一个模块化框架，通过分解任务和使用多代理系统提升异构知识图谱问答（KGQA）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到SPARQL方法在低资源领域和多图谱查询中的局限性，特别是在循环经济等分布信息领域。

Method: 采用模块化框架，分解KGQA为子任务，由专门代理管理检索、查询生成和验证，并通过调度器和两阶段验证器优化流程。

Result: 在真实循环经济知识图谱上，执行准确率提升17.3%，三元组F$_1$提升25.4%，同时减少提示长度46.4%。

Conclusion: AgenticT$^2$S展示了基于代理的模式感知推理对可扩展KGQA的优势，支持可持续性领域的跨图谱决策。

Abstract: Question answering over heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGQA) involves
reasoning across diverse schemas, incomplete alignments, and distributed data
sources. Existing text-to-SPARQL approaches rely on large-scale domain-specific
fine-tuning or operate within single-graph settings, limiting their
generalizability in low-resource domains and their ability to handle queries
spanning multiple graphs. These challenges are particularly relevant in domains
such as the circular economy, where information about classifications,
processes, and emissions is distributed across independently curated knowledge
graphs (KGs). We present AgenticT$^2$S, a modular framework that decomposes
KGQA into subtasks managed by specialized agents responsible for retrieval,
query generation, and verification. A scheduler assigns subgoals to different
graphs using weak-to-strong alignment strategies. A two-stage verifier detects
structurally invalid and semantically underspecified queries through symbolic
validation and counterfactual consistency checks. Experiments on real-world
circular economy KGs demonstrate that AgenticT$^2$S improves execution accuracy
by 17.3% and triple level F$_1$ by 25.4% over the best baseline, while reducing
the average prompt length by 46.4%. These results demonstrate the benefits of
agent-based schema-aware reasoning for scalable KGQA and support
decision-making in sustainability domains through robust cross-graph reasoning.

*Rubin Wei,Jiaqi Cao,Jiarui Wang,Jushi Kai,Qipeng Guo,Bowen Zhou,Zhouhan Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过预训练可微分外部记忆模块（MLP）来解耦LLM的记忆功能的方法，以减少幻觉问题，并在多个任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代仅解码器LLM在知识密集型任务中因幻觉问题表现受限，而检索增强生成（RAG）的非参数特性限制了其与LLM的深度交互。

Method: 使用预训练的MLP作为外部记忆模块，模仿检索器行为，并与Transformer解码器结合。

Result: 在WikiText-103和Web数据集上分别提升17.5%和24.1%，推理速度更快，且在幻觉基准和记忆密集型任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少幻觉，提升性能，并具有更好的扩展性和推理效率。

Abstract: While modern decoder-only LLMs achieve superior performance across various
domains, hallucinations have risen to be a common problem in their generated
text, hindering their application in knowledge-intensive tasks.
Retriever-augmented generation (RAG) offers a solution, but the non-parametric
nature of the retriever hinders its deep interaction with LLM. In this work, we
propose to decouple memorization from the LLM decoder using a pretrained,
differentiable external memory. The external memory is an MLP pretrained by
imitating the behavior of a retriever on the entire pretraining dataset. Our
resulting architecture, which comprises a transformer decoder and an external
MLP memory pretrained on language modeling and retriever imitation
respectively, demonstrates strong perplexity and performance on downstream
tasks. Experiments show our architecture exhibits steeper power-law scaling
with model size, achieving 17.5% and 24.1% improvement on WikiText-103 and Web
datasets compared to decoder-only models while benefiting from added training
without overfitting. We demonstrate superior performance on three hallucination
benchmarks and nine memory-intensive tasks. Additionally, our approach delivers
$80\times$ speedup over $k$NN-LM (500M tokens) and $1.3\times$ faster inference
than decoder-only models. Unlike $k$NN-LM, which impairs reasoning, our MLP
memory improves StrategyQA performance. We will open-source our code and models
in the future.

Motivation: 网页代理需具备足够知识以进行认知推理，因此需分解其能力并系统化知识获取。

Method: 提出Web-CogKnowledge框架，分类知识为事实、概念和程序性知识，构建Web-CogDataset，并开发知识驱动的CoT推理框架Web-CogReasoner。

Result: 实验显示Web-CogReasoner在未见任务中表现显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 通过系统化知识获取和推理框架，网页代理的认知能力得到显著提升。

Abstract: Multimodal large-scale models have significantly advanced the development of
web agents, enabling perception and interaction with digital environments akin
to human cognition. In this paper, we argue that web agents must first acquire
sufficient knowledge to effectively engage in cognitive reasoning. Therefore,
we decompose a web agent's capabilities into two essential stages: knowledge
content learning and cognitive processes. To formalize this, we propose
Web-CogKnowledge Framework, categorizing knowledge as Factual, Conceptual, and
Procedural. In this framework, knowledge content learning corresponds to the
agent's processes of Memorizing and Understanding, which rely on the first two
knowledge types, representing the "what" of learning. Conversely, cognitive
processes correspond to Exploring, grounded in Procedural knowledge, defining
the "how" of reasoning and action. To facilitate knowledge acquisition, we
construct the Web-CogDataset, a structured resource curated from 14 real-world
websites, designed to systematically instill core knowledge necessary for web
agent. This dataset serves as the agent's conceptual grounding-the "nouns" upon
which comprehension is built-as well as the basis for learning how to reason
and act. Building on this foundation, we operationalize these processes through
a novel knowledge-driven Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning framework, developing
and training our proposed agent, the Web-CogReasoner. Extensive experimentation
reveals its significant superiority over existing models, especially in
generalizing to unseen tasks where structured knowledge is decisive. To enable
rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Web-CogBench, a comprehensive evaluation
suite designed to assess and compare agent performance across the delineated
knowledge domains and cognitive capabilities. Our code and data is open sourced

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多种任务中表现出色，但常生成流畅但事实错误或缺乏支持的幻觉输出，需要一种无需重新训练的方法来检测和缓解这一问题。

Method: 动态生成看似合理但包含细微错误的对比事实语句，评估模型对这些变化的敏感性，区分真实知识与幻觉内容。

Result: 在TruthfulQA、事实陈述数据集和幻觉示例上的评估显示，该方法在检测性能上优于基线方法，并能平均减少24.5%的幻觉分数。

Conclusion: Counterfactual Probing是一种无需重新训练的方法，可集成到现有大语言模型流程中，作为实时验证机制，有效检测和减少幻觉输出。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse tasks, yet they frequently generate hallucinations outputs that are
fluent but factually incorrect or unsupported. We propose Counterfactual
Probing, a novel approach for detecting and mitigating hallucinations in LLM
outputs. Our method dynamically generates counterfactual statements that appear
plausible but contain subtle factual errors, then evaluates the model's
sensitivity to these perturbations. We hypothesize that genuine knowledge
exhibits robustness to counterfactual variations, while hallucinated content
shows inconsistent confidence patterns when confronted with plausible
alternatives. Our comprehensive evaluation on TruthfulQA, factual statement
datasets, and curated hallucination examples demonstrates that counterfactual
probing achieves superior detection performance compared to baseline methods,
while our adaptive mitigation strategies reduce hallucination scores by an
average of 24.5%. The approach requires no model retraining and can be
integrated into existing LLM pipelines as a realtime verification mechanism.

TL;DR: PunGPT2是首个完全开源的旁遮普语大语言模型套件，通过优化的分词器和预训练目标捕捉旁遮普语的独特特征，并结合检索增强生成框架Pun-RAG和指令调优变体Pun-Instruct。创新性地提出Quantum-RAG，融合稀疏和密集检索方法，首次在低资源语言生成中应用量子表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源语言在NLP领域长期被忽视，PunGPT2旨在填补旁遮普语的语言模型空白，并提供可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 1. 训练PunGPT2模型，使用优化的分词器和预训练目标；2. 开发Pun-RAG框架结合FAISS检索器；3. 提出Quantum-RAG，融合稀疏和密集检索方法；4. 指令调优变体Pun-Instruct。

Result: PunGPT2在困惑度、事实性和流畅性上显著优于多语言基线模型（如mBERT、mT5、MuRIL）。

Conclusion: 该研究为低资源语言扩展LLM能力提供了可扩展、可复现的蓝图，并首次在低资源NLP中引入量子感知检索。

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), low-resource
languages remain largely excluded from the NLP landscape. We present PunGPT2,
the first fully open-source suite of Punjabi large language models, trained
from scratch on a 35GB domain-diverse corpus encompassing literature, religious
texts, news, and social discourse. Unlike prior multilingual approaches,
PunGPT2 captures rich syntactic and morphological features unique to Punjabi
through a tokenizer optimised with byte pair encoding and linguistically
aligned pretraining objectives. To improve factual grounding and domain recall,
we introduce Pun-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation framework combining
PunGPT2 with a dense FAISS retriever over a curated Punjabi knowledge base. We
further develop Pun-Instruct, a parameter-efficient, instruction-tuned variant
using QLoRA, enabling robust zero-shot and instruction-following performance
with significantly reduced compute needs.
  As a key innovation, we propose Quantum-RAG, a novel hybrid retrieval system
that fuses sparse (BM25) and dense methods with quantum-inspired semantic
matching. By encoding queries using amplitude-based embeddings and retrieving
via quantum kernel similarity, Quantum-RAG achieves improved contextual
relevance with minimal memory overhead marking the first practical integration
of quantum representations in low-resource language generation. Our models
significantly outperform strong multilingual baselines (mBERT, mT5, MuRIL) in
perplexity, factuality, and fluency. This work provides a scalable,
reproducible blueprint for extending LLM capabilities to underrepresented
languages and pioneers quantum-aware retrieval in low-resource NLP

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）过度使用特定词汇（如“delve”和“intricate”）的原因，发现人类反馈学习（LHF）是主要因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在生成文本时过度使用某些词汇，但其原因尚不明确，研究旨在揭示LHF对词汇选择的影响。

Method: 使用Meta的Llama模型，设计实验模拟LHF过程，检测词汇偏好，并验证参与者对特定词汇的偏好。

Result: 实验表明LHF导致词汇过度使用，且不同人群（LHF工作者与LLM用户）的词汇期望存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究强调了数据和过程透明度在AI对齐中的重要性，为可解释AI研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to overuse certain terms like "delve"
and "intricate." The exact reasons for these lexical choices, however, have
been unclear. Using Meta's Llama model, this study investigates the
contribution of Learning from Human Feedback (LHF), under which we subsume
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback and Direct Preference Optimization.
We present a straightforward procedure for detecting the lexical preferences of
LLMs that are potentially LHF-induced. Next, we more conclusively link LHF to
lexical overuse by experimentally emulating the LHF procedure and demonstrating
that participants systematically prefer text variants that include certain
words. This lexical overuse can be seen as a sort of misalignment, though our
study highlights the potential divergence between the lexical expectations of
different populations -- namely LHF workers versus LLM users. Our work
contributes to the growing body of research on explainable artificial
intelligence and emphasizes the importance of both data and procedural
transparency in alignment research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ROVER框架通过递归分解长视频轨迹为短子任务段，提升视觉语言模型在视频推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在需要推理长视频帧序列时表现不佳，限制了其在需要连续视觉输入的具身任务中的应用。

Method: 提出ROVER框架，递归分解长视频轨迹为短子任务段，结合上下文学习实现局部推理。

Result: ROVER在任务进度估计、帧级自然语言推理和视频问答任务中优于基线，减少幻觉现象，时间复杂度线性增长。

Conclusion: ROVER通过局部化推理提升长视频推理能力，适用于具身任务。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across
diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require
reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits
their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame
sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task
attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo
Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose
long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks
within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate
reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global
context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach,
on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa
that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert
trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong
baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation,
frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We
observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each
timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or
non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the
implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time
complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over
baselines. Demos, code, and data available at: https://rover-vlm.github.io

Motivation: 传统方法在处理长文档时，由于上下文依赖和嵌入模型容量限制，检索性能提升有限。

Method: 开发了情境嵌入模型（SitEmb），通过新的训练范式将短文本块的情境信息编码到嵌入中。

Result: SitEmb模型在书情节检索数据集上表现优异，1B参数的SitEmb-v1已优于7-8B参数的现有模型，8B参数的SitEmb-v1.5性能进一步提升10%。

Conclusion: SitEmb方法有效解决了长文档检索中的上下文依赖问题，显著提升了检索性能，并展示了在多语言和下游任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over long documents typically involves
splitting the text into smaller chunks, which serve as the basic units for
retrieval. However, due to dependencies across the original document,
contextual information is often essential for accurately interpreting each
chunk. To address this, prior work has explored encoding longer context windows
to produce embeddings for longer chunks. Despite these efforts, gains in
retrieval and downstream tasks remain limited. This is because (1) longer
chunks strain the capacity of embedding models due to the increased amount of
information they must encode, and (2) many real-world applications still
require returning localized evidence due to constraints on model or human
bandwidth.
  We propose an alternative approach to this challenge by representing short
chunks in a way that is conditioned on a broader context window to enhance
retrieval performance -- i.e., situating a chunk's meaning within its context.
We further show that existing embedding models are not well-equipped to encode
such situated context effectively, and thus introduce a new training paradigm
and develop the situated embedding models (SitEmb). To evaluate our method, we
curate a book-plot retrieval dataset specifically designed to assess situated
retrieval capabilities. On this benchmark, our SitEmb-v1 model based on BGE-M3
substantially outperforms state-of-the-art embedding models, including several
with up to 7-8B parameters, with only 1B parameters. Our 8B SitEmb-v1.5 model
further improves performance by over 10% and shows strong results across
different languages and several downstream applications.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了电商PQA系统的性能，支持持续内容优化。

Abstract: E-commerce product pages contain a mix of structured specifications,
unstructured reviews, and contextual elements like personalized offers or
regional variants. Although informative, this volume can lead to cognitive
overload, making it difficult for users to quickly and accurately find the
information they need. Existing Product Question Answering (PQA) systems often
fail to utilize rich user context and diverse product information effectively.
We propose a scalable, end-to-end framework for e-commerce PQA using Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG) that deeply integrates contextual understanding. Our
system leverages conversational history, user profiles, and product attributes
to deliver relevant and personalized answers. It adeptly handles objective,
subjective, and multi-intent queries across heterogeneous sources, while also
identifying information gaps in the catalog to support ongoing content
improvement. We also introduce novel metrics to measure the framework's
performance which are broadly applicable for RAG system evaluations.

Abstract: Social media, such as Twitter, provides opportunities for caregivers of
dementia patients to share their experiences and seek support for a variety of
reasons. Availability of this information online also paves the way for the
development of internet-based interventions in their support. However, for this
purpose, tweets written by caregivers of dementia patients must first be
identified. This paper demonstrates our system for the SMM4H 2025 shared task
3, which focuses on detecting tweets posted by individuals who have a family
member with dementia. The task is outlined as a binary classification problem,
differentiating between tweets that mention dementia in the context of a family
member and those that do not. Our solution to this problem explores large
language models (LLMs) with various prompting methods. Our results show that a
simple zero-shot prompt on a fine-tuned model yielded the best results. Our
final system achieved a macro F1-score of 0.95 on the validation set and the
test set. Our full code is available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 论文为语音驱动的多模态角色扮演研究提供了数据和评估基础，推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Recently, role-playing agents have emerged as a promising paradigm for
achieving personalized interaction and emotional resonance. Existing research
primarily focuses on the textual modality, neglecting the critical dimension of
speech in realistic interactive scenarios. In particular, there is a lack of
systematic evaluation for Speech Role-Playing Agents (SRPAs). To address this
gap, we construct SpeechRole-Data, a large-scale, high-quality dataset that
comprises 98 diverse roles and 112k speech-based single-turn and multi-turn
conversations. Each role demonstrates distinct vocal characteristics, including
timbre and prosody, thereby enabling more sophisticated speech role-playing.
Furthermore, we propose SpeechRole-Eval, a multidimensional evaluation
benchmark that systematically assesses SRPAs performance in key aspects such as
fundamental interaction ability, speech expressiveness, and role-playing
fidelity. Experimental results reveal the advantages and challenges of both
cascaded and end-to-end speech role-playing agents in maintaining vocal style
consistency and role coherence. We release all data, code, and baseline models
to provide a solid foundation for speech-driven multimodal role-playing
research and to foster further developments in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注表面感知，而忽略了模型在语音场景中的上下文和推理能力，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: SpeechR通过三个关键维度（事实检索、程序推理和规范性判断）和三种评估格式（选择题、生成式和声学特征版）来评估模型。

Result: 评估11个先进模型发现，高转录准确率并不等同于强推理能力。

Conclusion: SpeechR为语音推理提供了结构化基准，有助于更精准地分析模型在多样化对话任务中的能力。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) have achieved near-human performance in
sentence-level transcription and emotion recognition. However, existing
evaluations focus mainly on surface-level perception, leaving the capacity of
models for contextual and inference-driven reasoning in speech-based scenarios
insufficiently examined. To address this gap, we introduce SpeechR, a unified
benchmark for evaluating reasoning over speech in large audio-language models.
SpeechR evaluates models along three key dimensions: factual retrieval,
procedural inference, and normative judgment. It includes three distinct
evaluation formats. The multiple-choice version measures answer selection
accuracy. The generative version assesses the coherence and logical consistency
of reasoning chains. The acoustic-feature version investigates whether
variations in stress and emotion affect reasoning performance. Evaluations on
eleven state-of-the-art LALMs reveal that high transcription accuracy does not
translate into strong reasoning capabilities. SpeechR establishes a structured
benchmark for evaluating reasoning in spoken language, enabling more targeted
analysis of model capabilities across diverse dialogue-based tasks.

TL;DR: STIM框架通过标记级分析识别LLMs中的记忆依赖，揭示错误主要由局部记忆驱动，并提出预测错误标记的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理任务中表现良好，但输入微小变化时易失败，怀疑其成功依赖记忆而非真正推理。

Method: 提出STIM框架，基于预训练语料统计共现，将推理链中的标记分类为局部、中程或远程记忆来源。

Result: 模型在复杂或长尾情况下更依赖记忆，局部记忆是错误的主要驱动（占错误标记的67%）。

Conclusion: STIM能有效诊断和改进模型推理，并可推广至其他结构化逐步生成任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well on reasoning benchmarks but often
fail when inputs alter slightly, raising concerns about the extent to which
their success relies on memorization. This issue is especially acute in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, where spurious memorized patterns can trigger
intermediate errors that cascade into incorrect final answers. We introduce
STIM, a novel framework for Source-aware Token-level Identification of
Memorization, which attributes each token in a reasoning chain to one of
multiple memorization sources - local, mid-range, or long-range - based on
their statistical co-occurrence with the token in the pretraining corpus. Our
token-level analysis across tasks and distributional settings reveals that
models rely more on memorization in complex or long-tail cases, and that local
memorization is often the dominant driver of errors, leading to up to 67% of
wrong tokens. We also show that memorization scores from STIM can be effective
in predicting the wrong tokens in the wrong reasoning step. STIM offers a

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音合成中表达性、可控性和自然性不足的问题，同时保持说话人身份在不同语言和情感上下文中的一致性。

Method: 采用说话人-情感解耦机制和批内对比学习，结合旋转情感嵌入方法，构建高质量情感语音数据集CSEMOTIONS。

Result: Marco-Voice在客观和主观指标上均有显著提升，语音清晰度和情感丰富度表现优异。

Conclusion: Marco-Voice在表达性神经语音合成领域取得了重要进展。

Abstract: This paper presents a multifunctional speech synthesis system that integrates
voice cloning and emotion control speech synthesis within a unified framework.
The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly
expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully
preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts.
Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism
with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of
speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional
embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support
comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality
emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six
professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in
both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis
were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance
in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial
advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis.

TL;DR: TDBench是一个新的基准测试，通过利用时间数据库和数据库技术（如时间SQL和功能依赖）系统构建时间敏感问答对，以解决现有基准测试依赖人工或固定模板的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事实随时间变化，需要大型语言模型（LLM）准确处理时间敏感的事实知识。现有基准测试依赖人工或固定模板，限制了评估的扩展性和全面性。

Method: 利用时间数据库和数据库技术（如时间SQL和功能依赖）构建TSQA对，并引入时间准确性指标评估模型解释中时间引用的有效性。

Result: TDBench能够实现可扩展和全面的TSQA评估，减少对人工的依赖，并支持应用特定数据和多跳问题生成。

Conclusion: TDBench为时间敏感问答评估提供了更可靠和全面的方法，补充了现有的基于维基百科/Wikidata的评估方法。

Abstract: Facts evolve over time, making it essential for Large Language Models (LLMs)
to handle time-sensitive factual knowledge accurately and reliably. While
factual Time-Sensitive Question-Answering (TSQA) tasks have been widely
studied, existing benchmarks often rely on manual curation or a small, fixed
set of predefined templates, which restricts scalable and comprehensive TSQA
evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose TDBench, a new benchmark
that systematically constructs TSQA pairs by harnessing temporal databases and
database techniques such as temporal SQL and functional dependencies. We also
introduce a fine-grained evaluation metric called time accuracy, which assesses
the validity of time references in model explanations alongside traditional
answer accuracy to enable a more reliable TSQA evaluation. Extensive
experiments on contemporary LLMs show how \ours{} enables scalable and
comprehensive TSQA evaluation while reducing the reliance on human labor,
complementing existing Wikipedia/Wikidata-based TSQA evaluation approaches by
enabling LLM evaluation on application-specific data and seamless multi-hop
question generation. Code and data are publicly available at:

*Zhentao Xu,Fengyi Li,Albert Chen,Xiaofeng Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProCut是一种无需训练的提示压缩框架，通过归因分析减少提示模板的冗余，显著降低令牌数量并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模工业LLM系统中，提示模板膨胀导致维护困难、推理延迟和成本增加。

Method: ProCut将提示模板分段为语义单元，量化其对任务性能的影响，并修剪低效部分。

Result: 在公共基准和工业提示上，ProCut减少78%令牌，性能保持或提升，优于其他方法62%。

Conclusion: ProCut高效压缩提示，兼容现有优化框架，显著降低延迟和成本。

Abstract: In large-scale industrial LLM systems, prompt templates often expand to
thousands of tokens as teams iteratively incorporate sections such as task
instructions, few-shot examples, and heuristic rules to enhance robustness and
coverage. This expansion leads to bloated prompts that are difficult to
maintain and incur significant inference latency and serving costs. To address
this, we introduce Prompt Compression via Attribution Estimation (ProCut), a
flexible, LLM-agnostic, training-free framework that compresses prompts through
attribution analysis. ProCut segments prompt templates into semantically
meaningful units, quantifies their impact on task performance, and prunes
low-utility components. Through extensive experiments on five public benchmark
datasets and real-world industrial prompts, we show that ProCut achieves
substantial prompt size reductions (78% fewer tokens in production) while
maintaining or even slightly improving task performance (up to 62% better than
alternative methods). We further introduce an LLM-driven attribution estimator
that reduces compression latency by over 50%, and demonstrate that ProCut
integrates seamlessly with existing prompt-optimization frameworks to produce
concise, high-performing prompts.

TL;DR: 论文提出了SMeL测试，评估语言模型过滤不可信信息的能力，发现即使先进模型也存在高幻觉率，且模型大小与表现无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网上存在大量不可信内容，但语言模型是否具备人类研究者使用的简单启发式方法来应对这一问题尚不明确。

Method: 引入SMeL测试作为基准，评估多种指令调优语言模型（包括推理模型）在过滤不可信信息时的表现。

Result: 发现没有模型能一致信任可靠来源，推理能力虽与高分相关，但最佳API模型的幻觉率仍高达70%，且模型大小与表现无必然联系。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了语言模型在过滤不可信信息时的重要幻觉问题，为未来方法开发提供了指导。

Abstract: The internet is rife with unattributed, deliberately misleading, or otherwise
untrustworthy content. Though large language models (LLMs) are often tasked
with autonomous web browsing, the extent to which they have learned the simple
heuristics human researchers use to navigate this noisy environment is not
currently known. In this paper, we introduce the Synthetic Media Literacy Test
(SMeL Test), a minimal benchmark that tests the ability of language models to
actively filter out untrustworthy information in context. We benchmark a
variety of commonly used instruction-tuned LLMs, including reasoning models,
and find that no model consistently trusts more reliable sources; while
reasoning in particular is associated with higher scores, even the best API
model we test hallucinates up to 70% of the time. Remarkably, larger and more
capable models do not necessarily outperform their smaller counterparts. We
hope our work sheds more light on this important form of hallucination and
guides the development of new methods to combat it.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）中谄媚行为的内部机制，发现用户简单观点即可诱导谄媚，而权威性影响微弱。通过分析，揭示了谄媚行为的两个阶段：后期层输出偏好转变和深层表征分歧。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解LLMs中谄媚行为的内部机制，以改进模型对齐和真实性。

Method: 系统研究用户观点对谄媚行为的影响，采用logit-lens分析和因果激活修补技术。

Result: 用户权威性对行为无影响，第一人称提示比第三人称更易诱导谄媚，深层表征扰动是关键。

Conclusion: 谄媚行为源于深层知识的结构性覆盖，对AI对齐和真实性设计有重要启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behavior, agreeing
with user-stated opinions even when those contradict factual knowledge. While
prior work has documented this tendency, the internal mechanisms that enable
such behavior remain poorly understood. In this paper, we provide a mechanistic
account of how sycophancy arises within LLMs. We first systematically study how
user opinions induce sycophancy across different model families. We find that
simple opinion statements reliably induce sycophancy, whereas user expertise
framing has a negligible impact. Through logit-lens analysis and causal
activation patching, we identify a two-stage emergence of sycophancy: (1) a
late-layer output preference shift and (2) deeper representational divergence.
We also verify that user authority fails to influence behavior because models
do not encode it internally. In addition, we examine how grammatical
perspective affects sycophantic behavior, finding that first-person prompts
(``I believe...'') consistently induce higher sycophancy rates than
third-person framings (``They believe...'') by creating stronger
representational perturbations in deeper layers. These findings highlight that
sycophancy is not a surface-level artifact but emerges from a structural
override of learned knowledge in deeper layers, with implications for alignment
and truthful AI systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了青少年对毒性内容的独特感知，即成人认为无害但青少年认为有毒的语言。

Method: 以中国青少年为研究对象，构建首个中文‘青少年毒性’数据集，并进行广泛分析。

Result: 青少年对毒性语言的感知与上下文因素相关，结合这些信息能显著提升现有检测方法的准确性。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注青少年为中心的毒性检测，结合更多元信息提升模型性能。

Abstract: Risk perception is subjective, and youth's understanding of toxic content
differs from that of adults. Although previous research has conducted extensive
studies on toxicity detection in social media, the investigation of youth's
unique toxicity, i.e., languages perceived as nontoxic by adults but toxic as
youth, is ignored. To address this gap, we aim to explore: 1) What are the
features of ``youth-toxicity'' languages in social media (RQ1); 2) Can existing
toxicity detection techniques accurately detect these languages (RQ2). For
these questions, we took Chinese youth as the research target, constructed the
first Chinese ``youth-toxicity'' dataset, and then conducted extensive
analysis. Our results suggest that youth's perception of these is associated
with several contextual factors, like the source of an utterance and
text-related features. Incorporating these meta information into current
toxicity detection methods significantly improves accuracy overall. Finally, we
propose several insights into future research on youth-centered toxicity
detection.

Motivation: 大型语言模型成本高，探索元学习是否能提升小型模型的预训练效果和可解释性。

Method: 结合一阶MAML和子集掩码LM预训练，构建四个LLama风格解码器模型（11M-570M参数），并在基础NLP任务中评估。

Result: 相比普通训练，模型损失收敛快1.6倍，多语言NER任务F1提升，训练动态显示表征先分散后压缩。

Conclusion: 元学习为小型语言模型提供高效、可解释的预训练方法，训练动态特征可用于分析模型行为。

Abstract: Large language models are powerful but costly. We ask whether meta-learning
can make the pretraining of small language models not only better but also more
interpretable. We integrate first-order MAML with subset-masked LM pretraining,
producing four LLama-style decoder-only models (11M-570M params), and evaluate
it on a fundamental NLP task with many settings and real-world applications.
Compared with vanilla training, our model (i) reaches the same loss up to 1.6x
sooner, (ii) improves F1 on multilingual Universal NER under equal compute, and
(iii) makes the training dynamics easy to read: first the network's
representations fan out ("diversify") and later they collapse into a smaller,
shared subspace ("compress"). This two-stage shift shows up as a rise-and-fall
in both effective-rank curves and attention-head entropy. The same curves
pinpoint which layers specialise earliest and which later reconverge, giving a
compact, interpretable signature of meta-adaptation. Code, checkpoints and
WandB logs are released.

Abstract: We present Seed Diffusion Preview, a large-scale language model based on
discrete-state diffusion, offering remarkably fast inference speed. Thanks to
non-sequential, parallel generation, discrete diffusion models provide a

demonstrated recently (e.g., Mercury Coder, Gemini Diffusion). Seed Diffusion
Preview achieves an inference speed of 2,146 token/s over H20 GPUs while
maintaining competitive performance across a sweep of standard code evaluation
benchmarks, significantly faster than contemporary Mercury and Gemini
Diffusion, establishing new state of the art on the speed-quality Pareto

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试无法全面评估LLMs的数学能力，尤其是证明类问题，手动创建成本高且不可扩展。

Method: 提出Proof2X路线图，将数学证明转化为易于验证的问题，并设计了一种新型混合格式问题（m-out-of-n多判问题），以抵抗猜测和表面模式匹配。

Result: 通过AlgGeoTest基准测试（456个代数几何问题）评估，发现当前LLMs在代数几何理解上存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: Proof2Hybrid框架和AlgGeoTest为深入研究AI系统的数学智能提供了新方向。

Abstract: Evaluating the mathematical capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a
critical yet challenging frontier. Existing benchmarks fall short, particularly
for proof-centric problems, as manual creation is unscalable and costly,
leaving the true mathematical abilities of LLMs largely unassessed. To overcome
these barriers, we propose Proof2Hybrid, the first fully automated framework
that synthesizes high-quality, proof-centric benchmarks from natural language
mathematical corpora. The key novelty of our solution is Proof2X, a roadmap of
converting mathematical proofs into various kinds of questions that are easy to
verify. Instructed by this roadmap, we propose a new type of hybrid-formatted
questions, named ``$m$-out-of-$n$ multiple judge questions'', specifically
designed to enable robust, automatic evaluation while being resilient to
guessing and superficial pattern matching inherent in traditional formats. As a
demonstration of our framework, we introduce AlgGeoTest, a benchmark for
algebraic geometry--a frontier domain of modern mathematics--comprising 456
challenging items. Our extensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs using
AlgGeoTest reveal profound deficits in their comprehension of algebraic
geometry, providing a more precise measure of their true mathematical
capabilities. Our framework and benchmark pave the way for a new wave of
in-depth research into the mathematical intelligence of AI systems.

Motivation: 探索多语言大语言模型中文化信息的编码方式及其与语言神经元的交互关系，以促进模型的公平性和包容性。

Method: 扩展语言神经元定位方法，引入MUREL数据集（8520万标记，覆盖六种文化），通过定位和干预实验分离文化神经元。

Result: 发现文化信息编码于模型上层神经元，且可独立于语言或其他文化神经元调控。

Conclusion: 文化知识在多语言模型中可选择性编辑，有助于提升公平性和包容性。

Abstract: Language and culture are deeply intertwined, yet it is so far unclear how and
where multilingual large language models encode culture. Here, we extend upon
an established methodology for identifying language-specific neurons and extend
it to localize and isolate culture-specific neurons, carefully disentangling
their overlap and interaction with language-specific neurons. To facilitate our
experiments, we introduce MUREL, a curated dataset of 85.2 million tokens
spanning six different cultures. Our localization and intervention experiments
show that LLMs encode different cultures in distinct neuron populations,
predominantly in upper layers, and that these culture neurons can be modulated
independently from language-specific neurons or those specific to other
cultures. These findings suggest that cultural knowledge and propensities in
multilingual language models can be selectively isolated and edited - promoting
fairness, inclusivity, and alignment. Code and data is available at

Conclusion: 干扰矩阵可作为优化多语言模型设计的工具。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of language interference in
encoder-only Transformer models across 83 languages. We construct an
interference matrix by training and evaluating small BERT-like models on all
possible language pairs, providing a large-scale quantification of
cross-lingual interference. Our analysis reveals that interference between
languages is asymmetrical and that its patterns do not align with traditional
linguistic characteristics, such as language family, nor with proxies like
embedding similarity, but instead better relate to script. Finally, we
demonstrate that the interference matrix effectively predicts performance on
downstream tasks, serving as a tool to better design multilingual models to
obtain optimal performance.

Result: 熵下降促进有效推理模式学习，高熵词与学习效率相关，新方法在多种LLMs上优于基线。

Conclusion: 动态调整奖励信号可聚焦高学习潜力词，提升RLVR效果。

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been
widely used for enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models
(LLMs). A core challenge in RLVR involves managing the exchange between entropy
and performance of policies. Despite the importance of this exchange, a
fine-grained understanding of when and how this exchange operates most
effectively remains limited. To bridge this gap, we conduct a systematic
empirical analysis of the entropy-performance exchange mechanism of RLVR across
different levels of granularity. Specifically, we first divide the training
process into two distinct stages based on entropy dynamics, i.e., rising stage
and plateau stage, and then systematically investigate how this mechanism
varies across stage-level, instance-level, and token-level granularitiess. Our
analysis reveals that, in the rising stage, entropy reduction in negative
samples facilitates the learning of effective reasoning patterns, which in turn
drives rapid performance gains. Moreover, in the plateau stage, learning
efficiency strongly correlates with high-entropy tokens present in
low-perplexity samples and those located at the end of sequences. Motivated by
these findings, we propose two methods that dynamically adjust the reward
signal using perplexity and positional information to focus RL updates on
tokens that exhibit high learning potential, achieving improvements compared to
the baseline methods on various LLMs.

Motivation: 阿拉伯世界的语言多样性导致MSA与方言之间存在显著差异，这对自然语言处理（尤其是机器翻译）提出了巨大挑战。

Method: 开发了两个专门模型（MSA-to-Shami和Shami-to-MSA），基于AraT5v2架构，使用Nabra数据集微调，并在MADAR语料库上进行评估。

Conclusion: SHAMI-MT为方言阿拉伯语翻译提供了高保真工具，适用于内容本地化、文化遗产和跨文化交流。

Abstract: The rich linguistic landscape of the Arab world is characterized by a
significant gap between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the language of formal
communication, and the diverse regional dialects used in everyday life. This
diglossia presents a formidable challenge for natural language processing,
particularly machine translation. This paper introduces \textbf{SHAMI-MT}, a
bidirectional machine translation system specifically engineered to bridge the
communication gap between MSA and the Syrian dialect. We present two
specialized models, one for MSA-to-Shami and another for Shami-to-MSA
translation, both built upon the state-of-the-art AraT5v2-base-1024
architecture. The models were fine-tuned on the comprehensive Nabra dataset and
rigorously evaluated on unseen data from the MADAR corpus. Our MSA-to-Shami
model achieved an outstanding average quality score of \textbf{4.01 out of 5.0}
when judged by OPENAI model GPT-4.1, demonstrating its ability to produce
translations that are not only accurate but also dialectally authentic. This
work provides a crucial, high-fidelity tool for a previously underserved

Conclusion: Dynaword框架为数据集提供了可持续的社区协作和质量保障机制。

Abstract: Large-scale datasets are foundational for research and development in natural
language processing. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1)
reliance on ambiguously licensed sources restricting use, sharing, and
derivative works; (2) static dataset releases that prevent community
contributions and diminish longevity; and (3) quality assurance processes
restricted to publishing teams rather than leveraging community expertise.
  To address these limitations, we introduce two contributions: the Dynaword
approach and Danish Dynaword. The Dynaword approach is a framework for creating
large-scale, open datasets that can be continuously updated through community
collaboration. Danish Dynaword is a concrete implementation that validates this
approach and demonstrates its potential. Danish Dynaword contains over four
times as many tokens as comparable releases, is exclusively openly licensed,
and has received multiple contributions across industry and research. The
repository includes light-weight tests to ensure data formatting, quality, and
documentation, establishing a sustainable framework for ongoing community
contributions and dataset evolution.

Result: 在标准数据集和实际应用中验证了方法的有效性，确认外部OOD检测器对保持响应相关性至关重要。

Conclusion: 外部OOD检测器是确保RAG系统仅响应领域内查询的关键工具。

Abstract: Ensuring safety and in-domain responses for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) systems is paramount in safety-critical applications, yet remains a
significant challenge. To address this, we evaluate four methodologies for
Out-Of-Domain (OOD) query detection: GPT-4o, regression-based, Principal
Component Analysis (PCA)-based, and Neural Collapse (NC), to ensure the RAG
system only responds to queries confined to the system's knowledge base.
Specifically, our evaluation explores two novel dimensionality reduction and
feature separation strategies: \textit{PCA}, where top components are selected
using explained variance or OOD separability, and an adaptation of
\textit{Neural Collapse Feature Separation}. We validate our approach on
standard datasets (StackExchange and MSMARCO) and real-world applications
(Substance Use and COVID-19), including tests against LLM-simulated and actual
attacks on a COVID-19 vaccine chatbot. Through human and LLM-based evaluations
of response correctness and relevance, we confirm that an external OOD detector

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LaMPE是一种无需训练的方法，通过动态调整位置编码和引入多粒度注意力机制，显著提升大语言模型在长上下文输入下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在输入超过预训练上下文窗口时的性能下降问题，特别是由于RoPE的分布外行为导致的性能损失。

Method: 提出LaMPE，利用参数化缩放sigmoid函数动态调整位置编码，并结合多粒度注意力机制，自适应分配位置分辨率和捕捉长距离依赖。

Result: 在五个主流长上下文基准测试中，LaMPE显著优于现有长度外推方法。

Conclusion: LaMPE是一种高效且通用的方法，适用于多种基于RoPE的大语言模型，无需额外训练即可显著提升长上下文处理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) experience significant performance degradation
when the input exceeds the pretraining context window, primarily due to the
out-of-distribution (OOD) behavior of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). Recent
studies mitigate this problem by remapping OOD positions into the
in-distribution range with fixed mapping strategies, ignoring the dynamic
relationship between input length and the model's effective context window. To
this end, we propose Length-aware Multi-grained Positional Encoding (LaMPE), a
training-free method that fully utilizes the model's effective context window
for adaptive long-context scaling in LLMs. Motivated by the left-skewed
frequency distribution of relative positions, LaMPE establishes a dynamic
relationship between mapping length and input length through a parametric
scaled sigmoid function to adaptively allocate positional capacity across
varying input lengths. Meanwhile, LaMPE devises a novel multi-grained attention
mechanism that strategically allocates positional resolution across different
sequence regions to capture both fine-grained locality and long-range
dependencies. Our method can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of
RoPE-based LLMs without training. Extensive experiments on three representative
LLMs across five mainstream long-context benchmarks demonstrate that LaMPE
achieves significant performance improvements compared to existing length
extrapolation methods. The code will be released at
https://github.com/scar-on/LaMPE.

Motivation: 全模态大语言模型的训练面临异构模型架构和高效大规模训练的挑战，现有框架在可扩展性和工程开销上存在不足。

Method: VeOmni通过模型中心的分布式策略，将通信与计算解耦，支持高效的3D并行，并提供灵活的配置接口以无缝集成新模态。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have driven impressive
progress in omni-modal understanding and generation. However, training
omni-modal LLMs remains a significant challenge due to the heterogeneous model
architectures required to process diverse modalities, necessitating
sophisticated system design for efficient large-scale training. Existing
frameworks typically entangle model definition with parallel logic, incurring
limited scalability and substantial engineering overhead for end-to-end
omni-modal training. % We present \veomni, a modular and efficient training
framework to accelerate the development of omni-modal LLMs. \veomni introduces
model-centric distributed recipes that decouples communication from
computation, enabling efficient 3D parallelism on omni-modal LLMs. \veomni also
features a flexible configuration interface supporting seamless integration of
new modalities with minimal code change. % Using \veomni, a omni-modal
mixture-of-experts (MoE) model with 30B parameters can be trained with over
2,800 tokens/sec/GPU throughput and scale to 160K context lengths via 3D
parallelism on 128 GPUs, showcasing its superior efficiency and scalability for
training large omni-modal LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出CAMERA框架，通过微专家单元压缩MoE模型，提升计算和存储效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型虽性能强大，但计算和存储开销大，且性能提升与参数增长不成比例。

Method: 引入微专家作为压缩单元，提出CAMERA框架（含CAMERA-P修剪和CAMERA-Q量化）。

Result: 实验显示CAMERA-P在20%-60%修剪率下优于基线，CAMERA-Q在2-bit量化下表现优异。

Conclusion: CAMERA框架高效且轻量，显著提升MoE模型的压缩和量化效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures are
distinguished by their strong performance scaling with increasing parameters
across a wide range of tasks, yet they also suffer from substantial
computational and storage overheads. Notably, the performance gains of MoE
models do not scale proportionally with the growth in expert parameters. While
prior works attempt to reduce parameters via expert-level pruning, merging, or
decomposition, they still suffer from challenges in both performance and
computational efficiency. In this paper, we address these challenges by
introducing micro-expert as a finer-grained compression unit that spans across
matrices. We first establish a more fundamental perspective, viewing MoE layers
as mixtures of micro-experts, and present CAMERA, a lightweight and
training-free framework for identifying micro-expert redundancy. Our analysis
uncovers significant variance in micro-expert contributions during decoding.
Based on this insight, we further propose CAMERA-P, a structured micro-expert
pruning framework, and CAMERA-Q, a mixed-precision quantization idea designed
for micro-experts. Extensive experiments on nine downstream tasks show that
CAMERA-P consistently outperforms strong baselines under pruning ratios ranging
from 20% to 60%. Furthermore, CAMERA-Q achieves superior results under
aggressive 2-bit quantization, surpassing existing matrix- and channel-level
ideas. Notably, our method enables complete micro-expert analysis of
Qwen2-57B-A14B in less than 5 minutes on a single NVIDIA A100-40GB GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解政治微调如何影响语言模型的政治立场及其跨话题泛化机制，以解决现有研究中的不足。

Method: 提出Political Neuron Localization through Activation Contrasting (PNLAC)识别政治神经元，并开发InhibitFT方法抑制跨话题泛化。

Result: 实验证明PNLAC识别的神经元类型具有鲁棒性，InhibitFT平均减少20%的跨话题泛化，且仅需抑制5%的神经元即可有效。

Conclusion: 通过神经元层面分析和抑制性微调，可有效控制政治微调的跨话题影响，同时保持话题特异性表现。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models on a political topic will significantly
manipulate their political stance on various issues and unintentionally affect
their stance on unrelated topics. While previous studies have proposed this
issue, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the internal
representations of these stances and the mechanisms that lead to unintended
cross-topic generalization. In this paper, we systematically explore the
internal mechanisms underlying this phenomenon from a neuron-level perspective
and how to mitigate the cross-topic generalization of political fine-tuning.
Firstly, we propose Political Neuron Localization through Activation
Contrasting (PNLAC) to identify two distinct types of political neurons:
general political neurons, which govern stance across multiple political
topics, and topic-specific neurons} that affect the model's political stance on
individual topics. We find the existence of these political neuron types across
four models and datasets through activation patching experiments. Leveraging
these insights, we introduce InhibitFT, an inhibition-based fine-tuning method,
effectively mitigating the cross-topic stance generalization. Experimental
results demonstrate the robustness of identified neuron types across various
models and datasets, and show that InhibitFT significantly reduces the
cross-topic stance generalization by 20% on average, while preserving
topic-specific performance. Moreover, we demonstrate that selectively
inhibiting only 5% of neurons is sufficient to effectively mitigate the
cross-topic stance generalization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CompressKV的方法，通过识别GQA-based LLMs中具有特定功能的注意力头来优化KV缓存压缩，显著提升了长上下文处理的效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前KV缓存压缩方法依赖启发式标记淘汰，忽略了注意力头的不同功能，导致关键标记被淘汰，影响LLMs性能。

Method: 识别能够检索初始、最终及重要标记的注意力头，并利用这些头确定保留的KV缓存对；同时引入层自适应KV缓存分配策略。

Result: 在LongBench和Needle-in-a-Haystack基准测试中，CompressKV在不同内存预算下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CompressKV通过优化注意力头选择和层自适应策略，显著提升了KV缓存压缩的效果和LLMs的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly boosted
long-context processing. However, the increasing key-value (KV) cache size
poses critical challenges to memory and execution efficiency. Most KV cache
compression methods rely on heuristic token eviction using all attention heads
in Grouped Query Attention (GQA)-based LLMs. This method ignores the different
functionalities of attention heads, leading to the eviction of critical tokens
and thus degrades the performance of LLMs.
  To address the issue above, instead of using all the attention heads in
GQA-based LLMs to determine important tokens as in the previous work, we first
identify the attention heads in each layer that are not only capable of
retrieving the initial and final tokens of a prompt, but also capable of
retrieving important tokens within the text and attending to their surrounding
semantic context. Afterwards, we exploit such heads to determine the important
tokens and retain their corresponding KV cache pairs. Furthermore, we analyze
the cache eviction error of each layer individually and introduce a
layer-adaptive KV cache allocation strategy. Experimental results demonstrate
the proposed CompressKV consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
under various memory budgets on LongBench and Needle-in-a-Haystack benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的连续知识图谱嵌入模型BAKE，通过贝叶斯更新和持续聚类方法缓解传统模型在动态知识图谱中的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱嵌入模型仅适用于静态图谱，而动态知识图谱的持续演化导致模型易遗忘先前知识，亟需解决。

Method: BAKE模型利用贝叶斯后验更新原则作为持续学习策略，并将新数据视为模型先验的贝叶斯更新；同时提出持续聚类方法，约束新旧知识间的演化差异。

Result: 实验表明，BAKE在多个数据集上显著优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: BAKE通过贝叶斯框架和持续聚类有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，适用于动态知识图谱的持续嵌入学习。

Abstract: Since knowledge graphs (KG) will continue to evolve in real scenarios,
traditional KGE models are only suitable for static knowledge graphs.
Therefore, continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) has attracted the
attention of researchers. Currently, a key challenge facing CKGE is that the
model is prone to "catastrophic forgetting", resulting in the loss of
previously learned knowledge. In order to effectively alleviate this problem,
we propose a new CKGE model BAKE. First, we note that the Bayesian posterior
update principle provides a natural continual learning strategy that is
insensitive to data order and can theoretically effectively resist the
forgetting of previous knowledge during data evolution. Different from the
existing CKGE method, BAKE regards each batch of new data as a Bayesian update
of the model prior. Under this framework, as long as the posterior distribution
of the model is maintained, the model can better preserve the knowledge of
early snapshots even after evolving through multiple time snapshots. Secondly,
we propose a continual clustering method for CKGE, which further directly
combats knowledge forgetting by constraining the evolution difference (or
change amplitude) between new and old knowledge between different snapshots. We
conduct extensive experiments on BAKE on multiple datasets, and the results
show that BAKE significantly outperforms existing baseline models.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何利用大语言模型（LLMs）替代传统专家评估，通过设计一个LLM框架来可靠地从非结构化文本数据中评估创新性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统创新测量依赖专家评估和特定情境的代理指标，限制了研究的适用范围。作者希望通过LLMs克服这些限制，提供更广泛适用的创新测量工具。

Method: 设计了一个LLM框架，通过两项研究验证其性能：1）软件更新的创新性评估；2）用户生成反馈和产品改进想法的原创性评估。

Result: LLM框架在F1分数和一致性方面优于其他方法（包括传统机器学习和深度学习模型）。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究人员和企业提供了可靠、广泛适用的创新测量工具，并讨论了模型选择、提示工程等设计决策对性能的影响。

Abstract: Measuring innovation often relies on context-specific proxies and on expert
evaluation. Hence, empirical innovation research is often limited to settings
where such data is available. We investigate how large language models (LLMs)
can be leveraged to overcome the constraints of manual expert evaluations and
assist researchers in measuring innovation. We design an LLM framework that
reliably approximates domain experts' assessment of innovation from
unstructured text data. We demonstrate the performance and broad applicability
of this framework through two studies in different contexts: (1) the
innovativeness of software application updates and (2) the originality of
user-generated feedback and improvement ideas in product reviews. We compared
the performance (F1-score) and reliability (consistency rate) of our LLM
framework against alternative measures used in prior innovation studies, and to
state-of-the-art machine learning- and deep learning-based models. The LLM
framework achieved higher F1-scores than the other approaches, and its results
are highly consistent (i.e., results do not change across runs). This article
equips R&D personnel in firms, as well as researchers, reviewers, and editors,
with the knowledge and tools to effectively use LLMs for measuring innovation
and evaluating the performance of LLM-based innovation measures. In doing so,
we discuss, the impact of important design decisions-including model selection,
prompt engineering, training data size, training data distribution, and
parameter settings-on performance and reliability. Given the challenges
inherent in using human expert evaluation and existing text-based measures, our
framework has important implications for harnessing LLMs as reliable,
increasingly accessible, and broadly applicable research tools for measuring
innovation.

Result: 在Financial PhraseBank情感分类任务中，单次优化周期提升准确率约3%。

Conclusion: LatentPrompt具有广泛适用性，仅需LLM黑盒访问和自动评估指标，适合多领域任务。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that optimizing prompts for Large Language Models
(LLMs) can significantly improve task performance, yet many optimization
techniques rely on heuristics or manual exploration. We present LatentPrompt, a
model-agnostic framework for prompt optimization that leverages latent semantic
space to automatically generate, evaluate, and refine candidate prompts without
requiring hand-crafted rules. Beginning with a set of seed prompts, our method
embeds them in a continuous latent space and systematically explores this space
to identify prompts that maximize task-specific performance. In a
proof-of-concept study on the Financial PhraseBank sentiment classification
benchmark, LatentPrompt increased classification accuracy by approximately 3
percent after a single optimization cycle. The framework is broadly applicable,
requiring only black-box access to an LLM and an automatic evaluation metric,
making it suitable for diverse domains and tasks.

Method: 采用定性方法，分析视觉修辞、言语话语和数字讽刺，揭示共享符号和抗议艺术如何构建团结感。

Result: 研究发现，视觉与言语策略的结合不仅动员了公众情绪，还构建了挑战威权叙事的集体身份。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在线平台在数字时代可作为身份建构和政治动员的有力工具。

Abstract: This study investigates how Facebook shaped collective identity during the
July 2024 pro-democracy uprising in Bangladesh, known as the Monsoon Uprising.
During government repression, protesters turned to Facebook as a central space
for resistance, where multimodal expressions, images, memes, videos, hashtags,
and satirical posts played an important role in unifying participants. Using a
qualitative approach, this research analyzes visual rhetoric, verbal discourse,
and digital irony to reveal how shared symbols, protest art, and slogans built
a sense of solidarity. Key elements included the symbolic use of red, the
ironic metaphorical use of the term "Razakar", and the widespread sharing of
visuals representing courage, injustice, and resistance. The findings show that
the combination of visual and verbal strategies on Facebook not only mobilized
public sentiment, but also built a strong collective identity that challenged
authoritarian narratives. This study tries to demonstrate how online platforms
can serve as powerful tools for identity construction and political
mobilization in the digital age.

Method: 通过声音象征和词价两个任务，评估Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct在英语、荷兰语和中文中的表现。

Result: 模型输出受语言身份影响，Qwen对荷兰语和中文的区分更敏感；深层网络中心理语言学信号更易解码，中文提示的效价表征更强且更稳定。

Conclusion: 语言身份显著影响LLMs的输出和内部表征，为跨语言认知模型的应用提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong linguistic capabilities, but
little is known about how they encode psycholinguistic knowledge across
languages. We investigate whether and how LLMs exhibit human-like
psycholinguistic responses under different linguistic identities using two
tasks: sound symbolism and word valence. We evaluate two models,
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct, under monolingual and
bilingual prompting in English, Dutch, and Chinese. Behaviorally, both models
adjust their outputs based on prompted language identity, with Qwen showing
greater sensitivity and sharper distinctions between Dutch and Chinese. Probing
analysis reveals that psycholinguistic signals become more decodable in deeper
layers, with Chinese prompts yielding stronger and more stable valence
representations than Dutch. Our results demonstrate that language identity
conditions both output behavior and internal representations in LLMs, providing
new insights into their application as models of cross-linguistic cognition.

Conclusion: LLMs通过数字位置特定电路解决算术问题，展现了其组成性和可解释性。

Abstract: While recent work has begun to uncover the internal strategies that Large
Language Models (LLMs) employ for simple arithmetic tasks, a unified
understanding of their underlying mechanisms is still lacking. We extend recent
findings showing that LLMs represent numbers in a digit-wise manner and present
evidence for the existence of digit-position-specific circuits that LLMs use to
perform simple arithmetic tasks, i.e. modular subgroups of MLP neurons that
operate independently on different digit positions (units, tens, hundreds).
Notably, such circuits exist independently of model size and of tokenization
strategy, i.e. both for models that encode longer numbers digit-by-digit and as
one token. Using Feature Importance and Causal Interventions, we identify and
validate the digit-position-specific circuits, revealing a compositional and
interpretable structure underlying the solving of arithmetic problems in LLMs.
Our interventions selectively alter the model's prediction at targeted digit
positions, demonstrating the causal role of digit-position circuits in solving
arithmetic tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic investigation into the constrained
generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in producing Songci, a
classical Chinese poetry form characterized by strict structural, tonal, and
rhyme constraints defined by Cipai templates. We first develop a comprehensive,
multi-faceted evaluation framework that includes: (i) a formal conformity
score, (ii) automated quality assessment using LLMs, (iii) human evaluation,
and (iv) classification-based probing tasks. Using this framework, we evaluate
the generative performance of 18 LLMs, including 3 proprietary models and 15
open-source models across four families, under five prompting strategies:
zero-shot, one-shot, completion-based, instruction-tuned, and chain-of-thought.
Finally, we propose a Generate-Critic architecture in which the evaluation
framework functions as an automated critic. Leveraging the critic's feedback as
a reward signal, we fine-tune three lightweight open-source LLMs via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), resulting in improvements of up to 5.88% in formal
conformity. Our findings offer new insights into the generative strengths and
limitations of LLMs in producing culturally significant and formally

Result: 模型在无监督情况下学习了类似人类IPA元音图的音素表征，且“音素移动头”在语音任务中起关键作用。

Conclusion: Llama模型通过内部音素表征完成语音任务，展示了无监督学习的能力。

Abstract: Large language models demonstrate proficiency on phonetic tasks, such as
rhyming, without explicit phonetic or auditory grounding. In this work, we
investigate how \verb|Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct| represents token-level phonetic
information. Our results suggest that Llama uses a rich internal model of
phonemes to complete phonetic tasks. We provide evidence for high-level
organization of phoneme representations in its latent space. In doing so, we
also identify a ``phoneme mover head" which promotes phonetic information
during rhyming tasks. We visualize the output space of this head and find that,
while notable differences exist, Llama learns a model of vowels similar to the
standard IPA vowel chart for humans, despite receiving no direct supervision to
do so.

Motivation: 解决通用Transformer模型在复杂技术文档中细粒度语法和实体关系上的不足。

Method: 结合GNN和Transformer，构建动态图并通过GATv2Conv层学习局部结构，再用Transformer捕获全局依赖。

Result: CGT在RAG流程中表现优于GPT-2和BERT，准确率提升24.7%，参数减少62.4%。

Conclusion: CGT通过联合建模结构化和语义信息，适用于技术领域，具有高效性和适应性。

Abstract: Standard transformer-based language models, while powerful for general text,
often struggle with the fine-grained syntax and entity relationships in complex
technical, engineering documents. To address this, we propose the Contextual
Graph Transformer (CGT), a hybrid neural architecture that combines Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformers for domain-specific question answering.
CGT constructs a dynamic graph over input tokens using sequential, skip-gram,
and semantic similarity edges, which is processed by GATv2Conv layers for local
structure learning. These enriched embeddings are then passed to a Transformer
encoder to capture global dependencies. Unlike generic large models, technical
domains often require specialized language models with stronger
contextualization and structure awareness. CGT offers a parameter-efficient
solution for such use cases. Integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) pipeline, CGT outperforms baselines like GPT-2 and BERT, achieving 24.7%
higher accuracy than GPT-2 with 62.4% fewer parameters. This gain stems from
CGTs ability to jointly model structural token interactions and long-range
semantic coherence. The model is trained from scratch using a two-phase
approach: pretraining on general text followed by fine-tuning on
domain-specific manuals. This highlights CGTs adaptability to technical
language, enabling better grounding, entity tracking, and retrieval-augmented
responses in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从维基百科和EURONEWS构建多语言可比语料库的方法，并比较了两种跨语言相似度度量方法（基于双语词典和基于潜在语义索引）的效果，最终验证了CL-LSI在主题和事件级别的对齐能力。


<details>

Motivation: 可比语料库在多语言自然语言处理中具有重要价值，尤其是在缺乏平行文本的领域或语言中。本文旨在构建和自动对齐多语言可比文档。

Method: 从维基百科和EURONEWS构建英语、法语和阿拉伯语的可比语料库，并实验了基于双语词典和潜在语义索引（CL-LSI）的跨语言相似度度量方法。

Result: 实验表明，CL-LSI在跨语言文档对齐中优于基于词典的方法，且能在主题和事件级别实现对齐。

Conclusion: CL-LSI是一种有效的跨语言文档对齐方法，适用于主题和事件级别的对齐任务。

Abstract: Comparable corpus is a set of topic aligned documents in multiple languages,
which are not necessarily translations of each other. These documents are
useful for multilingual natural language processing when there is no parallel
text available in some domains or languages. In addition, comparable documents
are informative because they can tell what is being said about a topic in
different languages. In this paper, we present a method to build comparable
corpora from Wikipedia encyclopedia and EURONEWS website in English, French and
Arabic languages. We further experiment a method to automatically align
comparable documents using cross-lingual similarity measures. We investigate
two cross-lingual similarity measures to align comparable documents. The first
measure is based on bilingual dictionary, and the second measure is based on
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Experiments on several corpora show that the
Cross-Lingual LSI (CL-LSI) measure outperforms the dictionary based measure.
Finally, we collect English and Arabic news documents from the British
Broadcast Corporation (BBC) and from ALJAZEERA (JSC) news website respectively.
Then we use the CL-LSI similarity measure to automatically align comparable
documents of BBC and JSC. The evaluation of the alignment shows that CL-LSI is
not only able to align cross-lingual documents at the topic level, but also it
is able to do this at the event level.

### [89] [Automated SNOMED CT Concept Annotation in Clinical Text Using Bi-GRU Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02556)
*Ali Noori,Pratik Devkota,Somya Mohanty,Prashanti Manda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于双向GRU的神经序列标注方法，用于自动标注临床文本中的SNOMED CT概念，性能优于传统规则系统，计算成本低于基于Transformer的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床文本的标准化医学概念标注对结构化数据提取和决策支持至关重要，但手动标注耗时且难以规模化。

Method: 使用双向GRU模型，结合MIMIC-IV数据集，通过SpaCy和SciBERT预处理文本，分割为19个标记的块，并加入上下文、句法和形态特征。

Result: 模型在验证集上F1分数达到90%，优于传统规则系统，与现有神经模型相当或更优。

Conclusion: 轻量级RNN架构能以较低计算成本实现高质量临床概念标注，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Automated annotation of clinical text with standardized medical concepts is
critical for enabling structured data extraction and decision support. SNOMED
CT provides a rich ontology for labeling clinical entities, but manual
annotation is labor-intensive and impractical at scale. This study introduces a
neural sequence labeling approach for SNOMED CT concept recognition using a
Bidirectional GRU model. Leveraging a subset of MIMIC-IV, we preprocess text
with domain-adapted SpaCy and SciBERT-based tokenization, segmenting sentences
into overlapping 19-token chunks enriched with contextual, syntactic, and
morphological features. The Bi-GRU model assigns IOB tags to identify concept
spans and achieves strong performance with a 90 percent F1-score on the
validation set. These results surpass traditional rule-based systems and match
or exceed existing neural models. Qualitative analysis shows effective handling
of ambiguous terms and misspellings. Our findings highlight that lightweight
RNN-based architectures can deliver high-quality clinical concept annotation
with significantly lower computational cost than transformer-based models,
making them well-suited for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: Sparse-dLLM通过动态缓存淘汰和稀疏注意力优化，显著提升了dLLMs的推理效率，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: dLLMs在推理时存在高计算复杂度和内存开销，现有缓存技术无法满足长上下文需求。

Method: 提出Sparse-dLLM框架，结合动态缓存淘汰和稀疏注意力，利用token显著性稳定性优化缓存。

Result: 实验显示Sparse-dLLM吞吐量提升10倍，性能与内存开销与原始dLLMs相当。

Conclusion: Sparse-dLLM在效率和效果上优于现有方法，适用于长上下文场景。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) enable breakthroughs in reasoning and
parallel decoding but suffer from prohibitive quadratic computational
complexity and memory overhead during inference. Current caching techniques
accelerate decoding by storing full-layer states, yet impose substantial memory
usage that limit long-context applications. Our analysis of attention patterns
in dLLMs reveals persistent cross-layer sparsity, with pivotal tokens remaining
salient across decoding steps and low-relevance tokens staying unimportant,
motivating selective cache eviction. We propose Sparse-dLLM, the first
training-free framework integrating dynamic cache eviction with sparse
attention via delayed bidirectional sparse caching. By leveraging the stability
of token saliency over steps, it retains critical tokens and dynamically evicts
unimportant prefix/suffix entries using an attention-guided strategy. Extensive
experiments on LLaDA and Dream series demonstrate Sparse-dLLM achieves up to
10$\times$ higher throughput than vanilla dLLMs, with comparable performance
and similar peak memory costs, outperforming previous methods in efficiency and
effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs中逐字记忆的多面性及其背后的机制，改进现有分类方法以更准确地反映注意力权重的作用。

Method: 通过训练卷积神经网络（CNN）分析LLM的注意力权重，评估现有分类与解码过程中注意力权重的对齐情况，并提出新的分类法。

Result: 现有分类表现不佳，新分类法将记忆样本分为三类：基于语言建模能力的猜测、训练集高重复导致的回忆和非记忆样本。发现少样本逐字记忆无独特注意力机制，且部分可提取样本实为模型猜测。

Conclusion: 提出更准确的记忆分类法，揭示了记忆机制的复杂性，并开发了可视化技术以辅助理解。

Abstract: Verbatim memorization in Large Language Models (LLMs) is a multifaceted
phenomenon involving distinct underlying mechanisms. We introduce a novel
method to analyze the different forms of memorization described by the existing
taxonomy. Specifically, we train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the
attention weights of the LLM and evaluate the alignment between this taxonomy
and the attention weights involved in decoding.
  We find that the existing taxonomy performs poorly and fails to reflect
distinct mechanisms within the attention blocks. We propose a new taxonomy that
maximizes alignment with the attention weights, consisting of three categories:
memorized samples that are guessed using language modeling abilities, memorized
samples that are recalled due to high duplication in the training set, and
non-memorized samples. Our results reveal that few-shot verbatim memorization
does not correspond to a distinct attention mechanism. We also show that a
significant proportion of extractable samples are in fact guessed by the model
and should therefore be studied separately. Finally, we develop a custom visual
interpretability technique to localize the regions of the attention weights
involved in each form of memorization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语患者反馈因方言多样性和标注稀缺而缺乏自动化分析，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用ChatGPT伪标签与人工审核结合的混合方法，构建数据集，并训练两种Transformer模型进行方面和情感分类。

Result: 阿拉伯语专用模型在少量人工监督下仍保持高准确率，减少方面类别显著提升分类性能。

Conclusion: 研究展示了结合大语言模型与人工标注的可扩展方法，为阿拉伯语医疗领域情感分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Arabic-language patient feedback remains under-analysed because dialect
diversity and scarce aspect-level sentiment labels hinder automated assessment.
To address this gap, we introduce EHSAN, a data-centric hybrid pipeline that
merges ChatGPT pseudo-labelling with targeted human review to build the first
explainable Arabic aspect-based sentiment dataset for healthcare. Each sentence
is annotated with an aspect and sentiment label (positive, negative, or
neutral), forming a pioneering Arabic dataset aligned with healthcare themes,
with ChatGPT-generated rationales provided for each label to enhance
transparency. To evaluate the impact of annotation quality on model
performance, we created three versions of the training data: a fully supervised
set with all labels reviewed by humans, a semi-supervised set with 50% human
review, and an unsupervised set with only machine-generated labels. We
fine-tuned two transformer models on these datasets for both aspect and
sentiment classification. Experimental results show that our Arabic-specific
model achieved high accuracy even with minimal human supervision, reflecting
only a minor performance drop when using ChatGPT-only labels. Reducing the
number of aspect classes notably improved classification metrics across the
board. These findings demonstrate an effective, scalable approach to Arabic
aspect-based sentiment analysis (SA) in healthcare, combining large language
model annotation with human expertise to produce a robust and explainable
dataset. Future directions include generalisation across hospitals, prompt
refinement, and interpretable data-driven modelling.

TL;DR: MArgE框架通过结构化多LLM输出的论证树，显著提升了任务验证性能，优于单LLM及非结构化多LLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多LLM结合方法缺乏结构化，导致生成内容难以验证。MArgE旨在通过计算论证学提供可验证的论证路径。

Method: 使用Argumentative LLMs构建结构化论证树，为任务验证提供可检查的论证路径。

Result: MArgE在实验中显著优于单LLM、开源模型及非结构化多LLM方法。

Conclusion: 结合形式化论证机制能有效提升多LLM输出的性能与可验证性。

Abstract: Leveraging outputs from multiple large language models (LLMs) is emerging as
a method for harnessing their power across a wide range of tasks while
mitigating their capacity for making errors, e.g., hallucinations. However,
current approaches to combining insights from multiple LLMs often involve
unstructured interactions (e.g., free debate), resulting in model generations
that are not faithfully justifiable. In this work, we introduce MArgE, a novel
framework to provide formal structure to the evidence from each LLM, in the
form of a tree of extracted arguments, for the task of claim verification. We
use a variant of Argumentative LLMs (ArgLLMs), i.e. LLMs driven by frameworks
and semantics from the field of computational argumentation, to construct
structured argument trees for given claims. This process creates an inspectable
pathway from the initial arguments to the final claim verification decisions,
providing a faithful justification thereof. We show experimentally that MArgE
can significantly outperform single LLMs, including three open-source models
(4B to 8B parameters), GPT-4o-mini and existing ArgLLMs, as well as prior
methods for unstructured multi-LLM debates. We thus demonstrate the advantages
of incorporating formal, argumentative reasoning mechanisms when combining
multiple LLM outputs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CharBench是一个新的字符级任务基准测试，规模远超现有测试，评估了多种语言模型的表现，发现模型在字符级任务上表现较差，平均准确率仅为43.6%和32.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究字符级任务（如字符计数或定位）对语言模型的挑战，探讨子词单元对模型表现的影响。

Method: 引入CharBench基准测试，评估多种开源和专有模型，分析单词内在属性及分词对模型表现的影响。

Result: 模型在字符级任务上表现不佳，字符计数任务中单词长度和实际字符数更重要，而位置理解任务中长分词会降低性能。

Conclusion: CharBench为未来研究提供了工具，建议改进模型在字符级任务上的表现。

Abstract: Tasks that require character-level reasoning, such as counting or locating
characters within words, remain challenging for contemporary language models. A
common conjecture is that language models' reliance on subword units, rather
than characters, contributes to their struggles with character-level tasks, yet
recent studies offer conflicting conclusions about the role of tokenization,
leaving its impact unclear. To address this gap, we introduce CharBench, a
comprehensive benchmark of character-level tasks that is two orders of
magnitude larger than existing alternatives. We evaluate a diverse range of
leading open-weight and proprietary models on CharBench and find that it
presents a significant challenge to modern LLMs, with an average accuracy of
43.6% and 32.3% on some tasks. We present an in-depth analysis of how intrinsic
properties of words and their segmentations into tokens correspond to model
performance. For counting tasks, we find that tokenization properties are
weakly correlated with correctness, while the length of the queried word and
the actual character count play a more significant part. In contrast, for tasks
requiring intra-word positional understanding, performance is negatively
correlated with the length of the token containing the queried character,
suggesting that longer tokens obscure character position information for LLMs.
We encourage future work to build on the benchmark and evaluation methodology
introduced here as tools for improving model performance on such tasks.

Motivation: 主流奖励模型在偏好建模中缺乏对token级交互的关注，导致其判断信号容易被上下文注意力分配不当所干扰。

Method: 提出“交互蒸馏”框架，利用基于交互的自然语言理解模型作为教师模型，通过注意力对齐目标指导偏好建模模拟教师模型的交互模式。

Result: 实验表明，交互蒸馏能提供比现有方法更稳定和泛化的奖励信号，验证了注意力分配问题是奖励模型的根本限制。

Conclusion: 注意力优化是提升奖励模型性能的关键，交互蒸馏为解决这一问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The reward model (RM), as the core component of reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) for large language models (LLMs), responsible for
providing reward signals to generated responses. However, mainstream preference
modeling in RM is inadequate in terms of token-level interaction, making its
judgment signals vulnerable to being hacked by misallocated attention to
context. This stems from two fundamental limitations: (1) Current preference
modeling employs decoder-only architectures, where the unidirectional causal
attention mechanism leads to forward-decaying intra-sequence attention within
the prompt-response sequence. (2) The independent Siamese-encoding paradigm
induces the absence of token-level inter-sequence attention between chosen and
rejected sequences. To address this "attention hacking", we propose
"Interaction Distillation", a novel training framework for more adequate
preference modeling through attention-level optimization. The method introduces
an interaction-based natural language understanding model as the teacher to
provide sophisticated token interaction patterns via comprehensive attention,
and guides the preference modeling to simulate teacher model's interaction
pattern through an attentional alignment objective. Through extensive
experiments, interaction distillation has demonstrated its ability to provide
more stable and generalizable reward signals compared to state-of-the-art RM
optimization methods that target data noise, highlighting the attention hacking
constitute a more fundamental limitation in RM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统注意力机制O(N^2)复杂度的问题，提供高效的长序列建模方案。

Method: 采用层间指针链机制，每层指针选择依赖前层指针位置，形成显式长距离连接。

Result: 在长序列上实现2-10倍加速，2048个token内保持>95%准确率，学习到可解释的指针模式。

Conclusion: Pointer为无需预训练的高效长序列建模提供了有吸引力的替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce Pointer, a novel architecture that achieves linear $O(NK)$
complexity for long-range sequence modeling while maintaining superior
performance without requiring pre-training. Unlike standard attention
mechanisms that compute $O(N^2)$ pairwise interactions, our approach uses
layer-wise pointer chaining where each layer's pointer selection depends on
previous layer's pointer positions, creating explicit long-distance connections
through pointer chains. We demonstrate that this architecture achieves
$2$--$10\times$ speedup on long sequences compared to standard transformers,
maintains $>95\%$ accuracy on copy tasks at distances up to 2048 tokens, and
learns interpretable pointer patterns that reveal structured dependency
modeling. Our experiments on efficiency benchmarks, long-range dependency
tasks, and interpretability analysis show that Pointer offers a compelling
alternative to attention mechanisms for scenarios requiring efficient
long-range modeling without pre-training dependencies.

Conclusion: 建议数据集不应被视为不可变，需定期检查和版本控制，同时为数据集创建者和使用者提供了改进质量的建议。

Abstract: Several multilingual benchmark datasets have been developed in a
semi-automatic manner in the recent past to measure progress and understand the
state-of-the-art in the multilingual capabilities of Large Language Models.
However, there is not a lot of attention paid to the quality of the datasets
themselves, despite the existence of previous work in identifying errors in
even fully human-annotated test sets. In this paper, we manually analyze recent
multilingual evaluation sets in two languages - French and Telugu, identifying
several errors in the process. We compare the performance difference across
several LLMs with the original and revised versions of the datasets and
identify large differences (almost 10% in some cases) in both languages). Based
on these results, we argue that test sets should not be considered immutable
and should be revisited, checked for correctness, and potentially versioned. We
end with some recommendations for both the dataset creators as well as
consumers on addressing the dataset quality issues.

Conclusion: HoneyImage为数据所有者提供实用机制，保护数据集所有权，促进安全共享与AI潜力释放。

Abstract: Image-based AI models are increasingly deployed across a wide range of
domains, including healthcare, security, and consumer applications. However,
many image datasets carry sensitive or proprietary content, raising critical
concerns about unauthorized data usage. Data owners therefore need reliable
mechanisms to verify whether their proprietary data has been misused to train
third-party models. Existing solutions, such as backdoor watermarking and
membership inference, face inherent trade-offs between verification
effectiveness and preservation of data integrity. In this work, we propose
HoneyImage, a novel method for dataset ownership verification in image
recognition models. HoneyImage selectively modifies a small number of hard
samples to embed imperceptible yet verifiable traces, enabling reliable
ownership verification while maintaining dataset integrity. Extensive
experiments across four benchmark datasets and multiple model architectures
show that HoneyImage consistently achieves strong verification accuracy with
minimal impact on downstream performance while maintaining imperceptible. The
proposed HoneyImage method could provide data owners with a practical mechanism
to protect ownership over valuable image datasets, encouraging safe sharing and
unlocking the full transformative potential of data-driven AI.

Conclusion: PF-DiffSeg为金属显微组织数据增强提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The effectiveness of machine learning in metallographic microstructure
segmentation is often constrained by the lack of human-annotated phase masks,
particularly for rare or compositionally complex morphologies within the metal
alloy. We introduce PF-DiffSeg, a phase-fraction controlled, one-stage
denoising diffusion framework that jointly synthesizes microstructure images
and their corresponding segmentation masks in a single generative trajectory to
further improve segmentation accuracy. By conditioning on global phase-fraction
vectors, augmented to represent real data distribution and emphasize minority
classes, our model generates compositionally valid and structurally coherent
microstructure image and mask samples that improve both data diversity and
training efficiency. Evaluated on the MetalDAM benchmark for additively
manufactured multiphase steel, our synthetic augmentation method yields notable
improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to standard augmentation
strategies especially in minority classes and further outperforms a two-stage
mask-guided diffusion and generative adversarial network (GAN) baselines, while
also reducing inference time compared to conventional approach. The method
integrates generation and conditioning into a unified framework, offering a
scalable solution for data augmentation in metallographic applications.

Abstract: In recent years, advances in Artificial Intelligence have significantly
impacted computer science, particularly in the field of computer vision,
enabling solutions to complex problems such as video frame prediction. Video
frame prediction has critical applications in weather forecasting or autonomous
systems and can provide technical improvements, such as video compression and

highly effective for solving vision-related tasks, although current frame
prediction models still have room for enhancement. This paper evaluates several
hybrid deep learning approaches that combine the feature extraction
capabilities of autoencoders with temporal sequence modelling using Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs), and related
architectures. The proposed solutions were rigorously evaluated on three
datasets that differ in terms of synthetic versus real-world scenarios and
grayscale versus color imagery. Results demonstrate that the approaches perform
well, with SSIM metrics increasing from 0.69 to 0.82, indicating that hybrid
models utilizing 3DCNNs and ConvLSTMs are the most effective, and greyscale
videos with real data are the easiest to predict.

Abstract: Long-term temporal information is crucial for event-based perception tasks,
as raw events only encode pixel brightness changes. Recent works show that when
trained from scratch, recurrent models achieve better results than feedforward
models in these tasks. However, when leveraging self-supervised pre-trained
weights, feedforward models can outperform their recurrent counterparts.
Current self-supervised learning (SSL) methods for event-based pre-training
largely mimic RGB image-based approaches. They pre-train feedforward models on
raw events within a short time interval, ignoring the temporal information of
events. In this work, we introduce TESPEC, a self-supervised pre-training
framework tailored for learning spatio-temporal information. TESPEC is
well-suited for recurrent models, as it is the first framework to leverage long
event sequences during pre-training. TESPEC employs the masked image modeling
paradigm with a new reconstruction target. We design a novel method to
accumulate events into pseudo grayscale videos containing high-level semantic
information about the underlying scene, which is robust to sensor noise and
reduces motion blur. Reconstructing this target thus requires the model to
reason about long-term history of events. Extensive experiments demonstrate our
state-of-the-art results in downstream tasks, including object detection,
semantic segmentation, and monocular depth estimation. Project webpage:

Abstract: Face recognition systems experience severe performance degradation when
processing low-quality forensic evidence imagery. This paper presents an
evaluation of latent diffusion-based enhancement for improving face recognition
under forensically relevant degradations. Using a dataset of 3,000 individuals
from LFW with 24,000 recognition attempts, we implement the Flux.1 Kontext Dev
pipeline with Facezoom LoRA adaptation to test against seven degradation

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中注意力机制不匹配导致性能不佳的问题。

Method: 引入LPWCA捕获细粒度区域语义关联，结合PAI系统协调多种注意力机制。

Result: 在10个基准测试中取得最优性能，仅增加3.55M参数。

Conclusion: CCRA显著提升模型性能，同时增强注意力的区域聚焦和语义对齐。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) face challenges in effectively coordinating
diverse attention mechanisms for cross-modal embedding learning, leading to
mismatched attention and suboptimal performance. We propose Consistent
Cross-layer Regional Alignment (CCRA), which introduces Layer-Patch-wise Cross
Attention (LPWCA) to capture fine-grained regional-semantic correlations by
jointly weighting patch and layer-wise embedding, and Progressive Attention
Integration (PAI) that systematically coordinates LPWCA, layer-wise, and
patch-wise attention mechanisms in sequence. This progressive design ensures
consistency from semantic to regional levels while preventing attention drift
and maximizing individual attention benefits. Experimental results on ten
diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that our CCRA-enhanced
LLaVA-v1.5-7B model achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all
baseline methods with only 3.55M additional parameters, while providing
enhanced interpretability through more regionally focused and semantically
aligned attention patterns.

Abstract: Infrared thermography is emerging as a powerful tool in sports medicine,
allowing assessment of thermal radiation during exercise and analysis of
anatomical regions of interest, such as the well-exposed calves. Building on
our previous advanced automatic annotation method, we aimed to transfer the
stereo- and multimodal-based labeling approach from treadmill running to
ergometer cycling. Therefore, the training of the semantic segmentation network
with automatic labels and fine-tuning on high-quality manually annotated images
has been examined and compared in different data set combinations. The results
indicate that fine-tuning with a small fraction of manual data is sufficient to
improve the overall performance of the deep neural network. Finally, combining
automatically generated labels with small manually annotated data sets
accelerates the adaptation of deep neural networks to new use cases, such as
the transition from treadmill to bicycle.

Conclusion: ROVI为文本到图像生成提供了高质量的数据支持，其方法和数据集具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present ROVI, a high-quality synthetic dataset for instance-grounded
text-to-image generation, created by labeling 1M curated web images. Our key
innovation is a strategy called re-captioning, focusing on the pre-detection
stage, where a VLM (Vision-Language Model) generates comprehensive visual
descriptions that are then processed by an LLM (Large Language Model) to
extract a flat list of potential categories for OVDs (Open-Vocabulary
Detectors) to detect. This approach yields a global prompt inherently linked to
instance annotations while capturing secondary visual elements humans typically
overlook. Evaluations show that ROVI exceeds existing detection datasets in
image quality and resolution while containing two orders of magnitude more
categories with an open-vocabulary nature. For demonstrative purposes, a
text-to-image model GLIGEN trained on ROVI significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art alternatives in instance grounding accuracy, prompt fidelity,
and aesthetic quality. Our dataset and reproducible pipeline are available at

Conclusion: AutoSIGHT为动态人机协作中的专业评估提供了新思路，并公开了相关眼动追踪数据。

Abstract: Can we teach machines to assess the expertise of humans solving visual tasks
automatically based on eye tracking features? This paper proposes AutoSIGHT,
Automatic System for Immediate Grading of Human experTise, that classifies
expert and non-expert performers, and builds upon an ensemble of features
extracted from eye tracking data while the performers were solving a visual
task. Results on the task of iris Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) used for
this study show that with a small evaluation window of just 5 seconds,
AutoSIGHT achieves an average average Area Under the ROC curve performance of
0.751 in subject-disjoint train-test regime, indicating that such detection is
viable. Furthermore, when a larger evaluation window of up to 30 seconds is
available, the Area Under the ROC curve (AUROC) increases to 0.8306, indicating
the model is effectively leveraging more information at a cost of slightly
delayed decisions. This work opens new areas of research on how to incorporate
the automatic weighing of human and machine expertise into human-AI pairing
setups, which need to react dynamically to nonstationary expertise distribution
between the human and AI players (e.g. when the experts need to be replaced, or
the task at hand changes rapidly). Along with this paper, we offer the eye
tracking data used in this study collected from 6 experts and 53 non-experts

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，通过重投影误差和相机轨迹一致性评估重建质量。

Conclusion: 增量式SfM是一种可靠的方法，适用于视觉结构化环境中的稀疏3D重建。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction from unstructured image collections is a key
requirement in applications such as robotics, mapping, and scene understanding.
While global Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques rely on full image
connectivity and can be sensitive to noise or missing data, incremental SfM
offers a more flexible alternative. By progressively incorporating new views
into the reconstruction, it enables the system to recover scene structure and
camera motion even in sparse or partially overlapping datasets. In this paper,
we present a detailed implementation of the incremental SfM pipeline, focusing
on the consistency of geometric estimation and the effect of iterative
refinement through bundle adjustment. We demonstrate the approach using a real
dataset and assess reconstruction quality through reprojection error and camera
trajectory coherence. The results support the practical utility of incremental
SfM as a reliable method for sparse 3D reconstruction in visually structured
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT扫描检查的增加，需要自动化方法辅助放射科医生处理工作量。现有3D卷积网络和Vision Transformers在长程依赖建模或计算成本上存在局限。

Conclusion: 通过消融研究验证了各组件贡献，提出的图结构方法在多标签分类任务中具有优势。

Abstract: With the increasing number of CT scan examinations, there is a need for
automated methods such as organ segmentation, anomaly detection and report
generation to assist radiologists in managing their increasing workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D CT scans remains a critical yet challenging
task due to the complex spatial relationships within volumetric data and the
variety of observed anomalies. Existing approaches based on 3D convolutional
networks have limited abilities to model long-range dependencies while Vision
Transformers suffer from high computational costs and often require extensive
pre-training on large-scale datasets from the same domain to achieve
competitive performance. In this work, we propose an alternative by introducing
a new graph-based approach that models CT scans as structured graphs,
leveraging axial slice triplets nodes processed through spectral domain
convolution to enhance multi-label anomaly classification performance. Our
method exhibits strong cross-dataset generalization, and competitive
performance while achieving robustness to z-axis translation. An ablation study
evaluates the contribution of each proposed component.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集版权验证方法（DOV）依赖过于简单的规避攻击评估，导致虚假的安全感，亟需更全面的评估框架。

Method: 使用教师模型学习版权数据，通过OOD数据集转移任务相关知识到学生模型，结合视觉语言模型和大型语言模型优化转移集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能消除所有版权标识，并在泛化性和有效性上显著优于现有9种规避攻击。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前DOV方法的关键漏洞，强调需要长期开发以提升实用性。

Abstract: Modern over-parameterized deep models are highly data-dependent, with large
scale general-purpose and domain-specific datasets serving as the bedrock for
rapid advancements. However, many datasets are proprietary or contain sensitive
information, making unrestricted model training problematic. In the open world
where data thefts cannot be fully prevented, Dataset Ownership Verification
(DOV) has emerged as a promising method to protect copyright by detecting
unauthorized model training and tracing illicit activities. Due to its
diversity and superior stealth, evading DOV is considered extremely
challenging. However, this paper identifies that previous studies have relied
on oversimplistic evasion attacks for evaluation, leading to a false sense of
security. We introduce a unified evasion framework, in which a teacher model
first learns from the copyright dataset and then transfers task-relevant yet
identifier-independent domain knowledge to a surrogate student using an
out-of-distribution (OOD) dataset as the intermediary. Leveraging
Vision-Language Models and Large Language Models, we curate the most
informative and reliable subsets from the OOD gallery set as the final transfer
set, and propose selectively transferring task-oriented knowledge to achieve a
better trade-off between generalization and evasion effectiveness. Experiments
across diverse datasets covering eleven DOV methods demonstrate our approach
simultaneously eliminates all copyright identifiers and significantly
outperforms nine state-of-the-art evasion attacks in both generalization and
effectiveness, with moderate computational overhead. As a proof of concept, we
reveal key vulnerabilities in current DOV methods, highlighting the need for
long-term development to enhance practicality.

(image quality) and 3D geometric (shape accuracy) metrics, reveals that model
performance is domain-dependent. While models produce higher-quality images of
complex spacecraft, they achieve better geometric reconstructions for the
simpler forms of asteroids. New benchmarks are established, with Hunyuan-3D
achieving top perceptual scores on spacecraft but its best geometric accuracy
on asteroids, marking a significant advance over our prior work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法依赖熟悉性假设，忽略了衰减特征的作用。COSTARR旨在利用这些被忽视的信息提升性能。

Method: COSTARR结合熟悉特征和陌生特征的缺失，利用衰减特征的Hadamard乘积，并通过概率解释其评分。

Result: COSTARR在多种架构（ViTs、ConvNeXts、ResNet）上表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COSTARR通过利用衰减信息，显著提升了开放集识别的能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Handling novelty remains a key challenge in visual recognition systems.
Existing open-set recognition (OSR) methods rely on the familiarity hypothesis,
detecting novelty by the absence of familiar features. We propose a novel
attenuation hypothesis: small weights learned during training attenuate
features and serve a dual role-differentiating known classes while discarding
information useful for distinguishing known from unknown classes. To leverage
this overlooked information, we present COSTARR, a novel approach that combines
both the requirement of familiar features and the lack of unfamiliar ones. We
provide a probabilistic interpretation of the COSTARR score, linking it to the
likelihood of correct classification and belonging in a known class. To
determine the individual contributions of the pre- and post-attenuated features
to COSTARR's performance, we conduct ablation studies that show both
pre-attenuated deep features and the underutilized post-attenuated Hadamard
product features are essential for improving OSR. Also, we evaluate COSTARR in
a large-scale setting using ImageNet2012-1K as known data and NINCO,
iNaturalist, OpenImage-O, and other datasets as unknowns, across multiple
modern pre-trained architectures (ViTs, ConvNeXts, and ResNet). The experiments
demonstrate that COSTARR generalizes effectively across various architectures
and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods by incorporating
previously discarded attenuation information, advancing open-set recognition
capabilities.

Motivation: 现有图像修复方法仅适用于RGB图像，透明图像修复通常需要两阶段处理（修复+抠图），导致透明区域不一致和边缘锯齿。

Method: 提出Trans-Adapter适配器，支持ControlNet可控编辑，可直接处理RGBA图像，无需两阶段流程。

Result: 通过LayerBench数据集和新评估指标验证，Trans-Adapter在透明边缘质量上表现优异。

Conclusion: Trans-Adapter为透明图像修复提供了高效、可控的解决方案，可无缝集成到现有模型中。

Abstract: RGBA images, with the additional alpha channel, are crucial for any
application that needs blending, masking, or transparency effects, making them
more versatile than standard RGB images. Nevertheless, existing image
inpainting methods are designed exclusively for RGB images. Conventional
approaches to transparent image inpainting typically involve placing a
background underneath RGBA images and employing a two-stage process: image
inpainting followed by image matting. This pipeline, however, struggles to
preserve transparency consistency in edited regions, and matting can introduce
jagged edges along transparency boundaries. To address these challenges, we
propose Trans-Adapter, a plug-and-play adapter that enables diffusion-based
inpainting models to process transparent images directly. Trans-Adapter also
supports controllable editing via ControlNet and can be seamlessly integrated
into various community models. To evaluate our method, we introduce LayerBench,
along with a novel non-reference alpha edge quality evaluation metric for
assessing transparency edge quality. We conduct extensive experiments on
LayerBench to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: MASIV在几何精度、渲染质量和泛化能力上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MASIV为材料无关系统识别提供了新方法，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: System identification from videos aims to recover object geometry and
governing physical laws. Existing methods integrate differentiable rendering
with simulation but rely on predefined material priors, limiting their ability
to handle unknown ones. We introduce MASIV, the first vision-based framework
for material-agnostic system identification. Unlike existing approaches that
depend on hand-crafted constitutive laws, MASIV employs learnable neural
constitutive models, inferring object dynamics without assuming a
scene-specific material prior. However, the absence of full particle state
information imposes unique challenges, leading to unstable optimization and
physically implausible behaviors. To address this, we introduce dense geometric
guidance by reconstructing continuum particle trajectories, providing
temporally rich motion constraints beyond sparse visual cues. Comprehensive
experiments show that MASIV achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric
accuracy, rendering quality, and generalization ability.

Abstract: We explore three strategies to enhance performance on a wide range of image
editing tasks: supervised fine-tuning (SFT), reinforcement learning (RL), and
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. In order to study all these components in one
consistent framework, we adopt an autoregressive multimodal model that
processes textual and visual tokens in a unified manner. We find RL combined
with a large multi-modal LLM verifier to be the most effective of these
strategies. As a result, we release EARL: Editing with Autoregression and RL, a
strong RL-based image editing model that performs competitively on a diverse
range of edits compared to strong baselines, despite using much less training
data. Thus, EARL pushes the frontier of autoregressive multimodal models on
image editing. We release our code, training data, and trained models at

Method: 提出UniEgoMotion，一种基于条件运动扩散模型的统一框架，结合头中心运动表示和图像场景上下文，支持运动重建、预测与生成。

Conclusion: UniEgoMotion为第一人称运动建模设定了新基准，拓展了相关应用的可能性。

Abstract: Egocentric human motion generation and forecasting with scene-context is
crucial for enhancing AR/VR experiences, improving human-robot interaction,
advancing assistive technologies, and enabling adaptive healthcare solutions by
accurately predicting and simulating movement from a first-person perspective.
However, existing methods primarily focus on third-person motion synthesis with
structured 3D scene contexts, limiting their effectiveness in real-world
egocentric settings where limited field of view, frequent occlusions, and
dynamic cameras hinder scene perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Egocentric Motion Generation and Egocentric Motion Forecasting, two novel tasks
that utilize first-person images for scene-aware motion synthesis without
relying on explicit 3D scene. We propose UniEgoMotion, a unified conditional
motion diffusion model with a novel head-centric motion representation tailored
for egocentric devices. UniEgoMotion's simple yet effective design supports
egocentric motion reconstruction, forecasting, and generation from first-person
visual inputs in a unified framework. Unlike previous works that overlook scene
semantics, our model effectively extracts image-based scene context to infer
plausible 3D motion. To facilitate training, we introduce EE4D-Motion, a
large-scale dataset derived from EgoExo4D, augmented with pseudo-ground-truth
3D motion annotations. UniEgoMotion achieves state-of-the-art performance in
egocentric motion reconstruction and is the first to generate motion from a
single egocentric image. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of
our unified framework, setting a new benchmark for egocentric motion modeling
and unlocking new possibilities for egocentric applications.

Conclusion: 该方法具有鲁棒性、泛化能力和高效性，适用于实际临床和工业应用。

Abstract: To develop a domain-agnostic, semi-supervised anomaly detection framework
that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to address challenges such as
large-scale data, overfitting, and class imbalance, focusing on brain MRI
volumes. This retrospective study used publicly available brain MRI datasets
collected between 2005 and 2021. The IXI dataset provided 581 T1-weighted and
578 T2-weighted MRI volumes (from healthy subjects) for training, while the
BraTS 2021 dataset provided 251 volumes for validation and 1000 for testing
(unhealthy subjects with Glioblastomas). Preprocessing included normalization,
skull-stripping, and co-registering to a uniform voxel size. Experiments were
conducted on both T1- and T2-weighted modalities. Additional experiments and
ablation analyses were also carried out on the industrial datasets. The
proposed method integrates DRL with feature representations to handle label
scarcity, large-scale data and overfitting. Statistical analysis was based on
several detection and segmentation metrics including AUROC and Dice score. The
proposed method achieved an AUROC of 88.7% (pixel-level) and 96.7%
(image-level) on brain MRI datasets, outperforming State-of-The-Art (SOTA)
methods. On industrial surface datasets, the model also showed competitive
performance (AUROC = 99.8% pixel-level, 99.3% image-level) on MVTec AD dataset,
indicating strong cross-domain generalization. Studies on anomaly sample size
showed a monotonic increase in AUROC as more anomalies were seen, without
evidence of overfitting or additional computational cost. The domain-agnostic
semi-supervised approach using DRL shows significant promise for MRI anomaly
detection, achieving strong performance on both medical and industrial
datasets. Its robustness, generalizability and efficiency highlight its
potential for real-world clinical applications.

*Huyu Wu,Duo Su,Junjie Hou,Guang Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC3提出了一种数据集压缩框架，通过颜色补偿提升压缩图像的质量，解决了现有方法在效率和语义失真上的瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集压缩方法在图像级选择和像素级优化上存在效率低下和语义失真的问题，忽视了颜色作为信息载体和语义单元的双重作用。

Method: DC3采用校准选择策略，利用潜在扩散模型增强图像颜色多样性而非生成全新图像。

Result: 实验表明DC3在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，且生成的压缩数据集可用于训练网络而不引发模型崩溃。

Conclusion: DC3首次将预训练扩散模型与压缩数据集结合，证明了高质量数据集在训练中的可行性。

Abstract: Dataset condensation always faces a constitutive trade-off: balancing
performance and fidelity under extreme compression. Existing methods struggle
with two bottlenecks: image-level selection methods (Coreset Selection, Dataset
Quantization) suffer from inefficiency condensation, while pixel-level
optimization (Dataset Distillation) introduces semantic distortion due to
over-parameterization. With empirical observations, we find that a critical
problem in dataset condensation is the oversight of color's dual role as an
information carrier and a basic semantic representation unit. We argue that
improving the colorfulness of condensed images is beneficial for representation
learning. Motivated by this, we propose DC3: a Dataset Condensation framework
with Color Compensation. After a calibrated selection strategy, DC3 utilizes
the latent diffusion model to enhance the color diversity of an image rather
than creating a brand-new one. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior
performance and generalization of DC3 that outperforms SOTA methods across
multiple benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, besides focusing on
downstream tasks, DC3 is the first research to fine-tune pre-trained diffusion
models with condensed datasets. The FID results prove that training networks
with our high-quality datasets is feasible without model collapse or other
degradation issues. Code and generated data will be released soon.

Motivation: 现有方法在开放词汇查询下存在离线流程僵化和对象级理解不精确的问题，OpenGS-Fusion旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合3D高斯表示与截断符号距离场，提出多模态语言引导的自适应阈值方法（MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding）。

Result: 在3D mIoU上比固定阈值策略提升17%，在3D对象理解和场景重建质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OpenGS-Fusion在语义建模和语言引导场景交互方面表现出色，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D scene understanding have made significant strides
in enabling interaction with scenes using open-vocabulary queries, particularly
for VR/AR and robotic applications. Nevertheless, existing methods are hindered
by rigid offline pipelines and the inability to provide precise 3D object-level
understanding given open-ended queries. In this paper, we present
OpenGS-Fusion, an innovative open-vocabulary dense mapping framework that
improves semantic modeling and refines object-level understanding.
OpenGS-Fusion combines 3D Gaussian representation with a Truncated Signed
Distance Field to facilitate lossless fusion of semantic features on-the-fly.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal language-guided approach named
MLLM-Assisted Adaptive Thresholding, which refines the segmentation of 3D
objects by adaptively adjusting similarity thresholds, achieving an improvement
17\% in 3D mIoU compared to the fixed threshold strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in 3D object
understanding and scene reconstruction quality, as well as showcasing its
effectiveness in language-guided scene interaction. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出个性化安全对齐框架（PSA），通过用户个性化配置调整扩散模型的安全行为，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型的安全机制过于统一，未考虑用户个性化需求（如年龄、心理健康等）。

Method: 提出PSA框架，结合用户个性化配置，通过交叉注意力机制调整模型行为。

Result: PSA在有害内容抑制和用户约束对齐方面表现更优，Win Rate和Pass Rate得分更高。

Conclusion: PSA为生成模型提供个性化安全控制，平衡安全性与图像质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have revolutionized visual content generation,
but current safety mechanisms apply uniform standards that often fail to
account for individual user preferences. These models overlook the diverse
safety boundaries shaped by factors like age, mental health, and personal
beliefs. To address this, we propose Personalized Safety Alignment (PSA), a
framework that allows user-specific control over safety behaviors in generative
models. PSA integrates personalized user profiles into the diffusion process,
adjusting the model's behavior to match individual safety preferences while
preserving image quality. We introduce a new dataset, Sage, which captures
user-specific safety preferences and incorporates these profiles through a
cross-attention mechanism. Experiments show that PSA outperforms existing
methods in harmful content suppression and aligns generated content better with
user constraints, achieving higher Win Rate and Pass Rate scores. Our code,
data, and models are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有二分图像分割方法在用户控制和个性化需求上的不足。

Method: 结合语言控制分割策略（LS）和窗口控制细化策略（WR），通过潜在扩散模型实现图像条件掩码生成。

Result: 在DIS5K基准测试中，LawDIS显著优于11种前沿方法，Fβω增益达4.6%。

Conclusion: LawDIS框架在用户控制和精度上表现优异，适用于高精度个性化应用。

Abstract: We present LawDIS, a language-window-based controllable dichotomous image
segmentation (DIS) framework that produces high-quality object masks. Our
framework recasts DIS as an image-conditioned mask generation task within a
latent diffusion model, enabling seamless integration of user controls. LawDIS
is enhanced with macro-to-micro control modes. Specifically, in macro mode, we
introduce a language-controlled segmentation strategy (LS) to generate an
initial mask based on user-provided language prompts. In micro mode, a
window-controlled refinement strategy (WR) allows flexible refinement of
user-defined regions (i.e., size-adjustable windows) within the initial mask.
Coordinated by a mode switcher, these modes can operate independently or
jointly, making the framework well-suited for high-accuracy, personalised
applications. Extensive experiments on the DIS5K benchmark reveal that our
LawDIS significantly outperforms 11 cutting-edge methods across all metrics.
Notably, compared to the second-best model MVANet, we achieve $F_\beta^\omega$
gains of 4.6\% with both the LS and WR strategies and 3.6\% gains with only the
LS strategy on DIS-TE. Codes will be made available at

TL;DR: TEACH是一种新的训练范式，通过将真实文本作为辅助输入注入模型，并在训练中逐步减少其影响，提升场景文本识别（STR）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决场景文本识别中因复杂视觉外观和有限语义先验导致的挑战。

Method: 将目标标签编码到嵌入空间，应用损失感知掩码，模拟从标签依赖学习到完全视觉识别的课程学习过程。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，TEACH训练的模型表现出更高的准确性，尤其是在挑战性条件下。

Conclusion: TEACH无需外部预训练，无推理开销，模型无关，可轻松集成到现有编码器-解码器框架中，具有鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Scene Text Recognition (STR) remains a challenging task due to complex visual
appearances and limited semantic priors. We propose TEACH, a novel training
paradigm that injects ground-truth text into the model as auxiliary input and
progressively reduces its influence during training. By encoding target labels
into the embedding space and applying loss-aware masking, TEACH simulates a
curriculum learning process that guides the model from label-dependent learning
to fully visual recognition. Unlike language model-based approaches, TEACH
requires no external pretraining and introduces no inference overhead. It is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-decoder
frameworks. Extensive experiments across multiple public benchmarks show that
models trained with TEACH achieve consistently improved accuracy, especially
under challenging conditions, validating its robustness and general
applicability.

TL;DR: 提出一种新算法，通过粗到细策略和优化特征计算，显著加速3D点跟踪，速度提升5-100倍，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理大量轨迹时计算成本高，尤其是基于Transformer的迭代跟踪和特征计算成为瓶颈。

Method: 采用粗到细策略，逐步扩展跟踪轨迹，并引入可学习的插值模块；优化相关特征计算以减少成本。

Result: 算法速度提升5-100倍，同时保持最先进的跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 新算法有效解决了计算瓶颈，实现了高效且高精度的3D点跟踪。

Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for accelerating dense long-term 3D point
tracking in videos. Through analysis of existing state-of-the-art methods, we
identify two major computational bottlenecks. First, transformer-based
iterative tracking becomes expensive when handling a large number of
trajectories. To address this, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy that
begins tracking with a small subset of points and progressively expands the set
of tracked trajectories. The newly added trajectories are initialized using a
learnable interpolation module, which is trained end-to-end alongside the
tracking network. Second, we propose an optimization that significantly reduces
the cost of correlation feature computation, another key bottleneck in prior
methods. Together, these improvements lead to a 5-100x speedup over existing
approaches while maintaining state-of-the-art tracking accuracy.

Motivation: 解决多视角图像中缺乏真实姿态信息的问题，提出一种无需姿态监督的高效3D建模方法。

Method: 使用共享特征提取主干，同时预测3D高斯基元和相机姿态，结合渲染损失和重投影损失优化几何约束。

Result: 在无姿态监督下，SPFSplat在新视角合成和相对姿态估计中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SPFSplat的免姿态训练和高效设计使其适用于实际应用，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplat, an efficient framework for 3D Gaussian splatting from
sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during training or
inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone, enabling
simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in a
canonical space from unposed inputs within a single feed-forward step.
Alongside the rendering loss based on estimated novel-view poses, a
reprojection loss is integrated to enforce the learning of pixel-aligned
Gaussian primitives for enhanced geometric constraints. This pose-free training
paradigm and efficient one-step feed-forward design make SPFSplat well-suited
for practical applications. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose
supervision, SPFSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view
synthesis even under significant viewpoint changes and limited image overlap.
It also surpasses recent methods trained with geometry priors in relative pose
estimation. Code and trained models are available on our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过联合建模3D物体功能区域定位（affordance grounding）和功能分类（affordance classification），解决了现有方法因任务分离导致的预测不一致问题，并实现了对完整功能区域的预测和多尺度处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将3D功能区域定位和功能分类分开处理，导致预测不一致，且仅能预测图像中部分功能区域，无法处理多尺度变化。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于跨模态3D表示和阶段式推理策略的方法，通过高效融合和多尺度几何特征传播，预测完整功能区域，并采用两阶段预测机制联合优化定位和分类任务。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在功能区域定位和分类任务上均表现出色，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过联合建模和多尺度特征处理，该方法显著提升了3D功能区域的理解能力，为具身AI的物体操作学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A core problem of Embodied AI is to learn object manipulation from
observation, as humans do. To achieve this, it is important to localize 3D
object affordance areas through observation such as images (3D affordance
grounding) and understand their functionalities (affordance classification).
Previous attempts usually tackle these two tasks separately, leading to
inconsistent predictions due to lacking proper modeling of their dependency. In
addition, these methods typically only ground the incomplete affordance areas
depicted in images, failing to predict the full potential affordance areas, and
operate at a fixed scale, resulting in difficulty in coping with affordances
significantly varying in scale with respect to the whole object. To address
these issues, we propose a novel approach that learns an affordance-aware 3D
representation and employs a stage-wise inference strategy leveraging the
dependency between grounding and classification tasks. Specifically, we first
develop a cross-modal 3D representation through efficient fusion and
multi-scale geometric feature propagation, enabling inference of full potential
affordance areas at a suitable regional scale. Moreover, we adopt a simple
two-stage prediction mechanism, effectively coupling grounding and
classification for better affordance understanding. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, showing improved performance in both affordance
grounding and classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉定位任务依赖边界框，无法捕捉细粒度细节，导致对象表示不准确。

Method: 基于nuScenes数据集构建3D占用基准，提出端到端模型GroundingOcc，结合多模态特征（视觉、文本、点云）进行从粗到细的预测。

Result: 实验表明，GroundingOcc在3D占用定位任务上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和模型为户外场景中的精确对象感知提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to identify objects or regions in a scene based on
natural language descriptions, essential for spatially aware perception in
autonomous driving. However, existing visual grounding tasks typically depend
on bounding boxes that often fail to capture fine-grained details. Not all
voxels within a bounding box are occupied, resulting in inaccurate object
representations. To address this, we introduce a benchmark for 3D occupancy
grounding in challenging outdoor scenes. Built on the nuScenes dataset, it
integrates natural language with voxel-level occupancy annotations, offering
more precise object perception compared to the traditional grounding task.
Moreover, we propose GroundingOcc, an end-to-end model designed for 3D
occupancy grounding through multi-modal learning. It combines visual, textual,
and point cloud features to predict object location and occupancy information
from coarse to fine. Specifically, GroundingOcc comprises a multimodal encoder
for feature extraction, an occupancy head for voxel-wise predictions, and a
grounding head to refine localization. Additionally, a 2D grounding module and
a depth estimation module enhance geometric understanding, thereby boosting
model performance. Extensive experiments on the benchmark demonstrate that our
method outperforms existing baselines on 3D occupancy grounding. The dataset is
available at https://github.com/RONINGOD/GroundingOcc.

Abstract: Civil infrastructure systems covers large land areas and needs frequent
inspections to maintain their public service capabilities. The conventional
approaches of manual surveys or vehicle-based automated surveys to assess
infrastructure conditions are often labor-intensive and time-consuming. For
this reason, it is worthwhile to explore more cost-effective methods for
monitoring and maintaining these infrastructures. Fortunately, recent
advancements in satellite systems and image processing algorithms have opened
up new possibilities. Numerous satellite systems have been employed to monitor
infrastructure conditions and identify damages. Due to the improvement in
ground sample distance (GSD), the level of detail that can be captured has
significantly increased. Taking advantage of these technology advancement, this
research investigated to evaluate pavement conditions using deep learning
models for analyzing satellite images. We gathered over 3,000 satellite images
of pavement sections, together with pavement evaluation ratings from TxDOT's
PMIS database. The results of our study show an accuracy rate is exceeding 90%.
This research paves the way for a rapid and cost-effective approach to
evaluating the pavement network in the future.

Result: 在包含100万样本的大规模道路表面分类数据集上，RoadMamba实现了最优性能。

Conclusion: RoadMamba通过结合全局和局部感知，显著提升了道路表面分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Acquiring the road surface conditions in advance based on visual technologies
provides effective information for the planning and control system of
autonomous vehicles, thus improving the safety and driving comfort of the
vehicles. Recently, the Mamba architecture based on state-space models has
shown remarkable performance in visual processing tasks, benefiting from the
efficient global receptive field. However, existing Mamba architectures
struggle to achieve state-of-the-art visual road surface classification due to
their lack of effective extraction of the local texture of the road surface. In
this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of visual Mamba
architectures for road surface classification task and propose a method that
effectively combines local and global perception, called RoadMamba.
Specifically, we utilize the Dual State Space Model (DualSSM) to effectively
extract the global semantics and local texture of the road surface and decode
and fuse the dual features through the Dual Attention Fusion (DAF). In
addition, we propose a dual auxiliary loss to explicitly constrain dual
branches, preventing the network from relying only on global semantic
information from the deep large receptive field and ignoring the local texture.
The proposed RoadMamba achieves the state-of-the-art performance in experiments
on a large-scale road surface classification dataset containing 1 million
samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在风格迁移中将文本描述视为统一指导，忽略了文本与视觉风格的空间属性差异，导致语义结构和细节丢失。

Method: 提出Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD)无监督提取风格知识，并引入Contrastive Semantic Decoupling (CSD)任务特定目标，通过两类别聚类优化文本编码器。

Result: 在三个经典基准测试中，StyDeco在风格保真度和结构保留上优于现有方法，并支持独特的去风格化过程。

Conclusion: StyDeco框架有效解决了文本驱动风格迁移的语义结构问题，展示了其在风格迁移任务中的优越性和扩展性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as the dominant paradigm for style transfer,
but their text-driven mechanism is hindered by a core limitation: it treats
textual descriptions as uniform, monolithic guidance. This limitation overlooks
the semantic gap between the non-spatial nature of textual descriptions and the
spatially-aware attributes of visual style, often leading to the loss of
semantic structure and fine-grained details during stylization. In this paper,
we propose StyDeco, an unsupervised framework that resolves this limitation by
learning text representations specifically tailored for the style transfer
task. Our framework first employs Prior-Guided Data Distillation (PGD), a
strategy designed to distill stylistic knowledge without human supervision. It
leverages a powerful frozen generative model to automatically synthesize
pseudo-paired data. Subsequently, we introduce Contrastive Semantic Decoupling
(CSD), a task-specific objective that adapts a text encoder using
domain-specific weights. CSD performs a two-class clustering in the semantic
space, encouraging source and target representations to form distinct clusters.
Extensive experiments on three classic benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework outperforms several existing approaches in both stylistic fidelity
and structural preservation, highlighting its effectiveness in style transfer
with semantic preservation. In addition, our framework supports a unique
de-stylization process, further demonstrating its extensibility. Our code is
vailable at https://github.com/QuanjianSong/StyDeco.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 楼层平面定位（FLoc）因建筑布局的重复结构容易导致定位模糊，现有方法忽略了视觉图像提供的丰富上下文信息。本文旨在利用场景布局先验消除定位不确定性。

Method: 提出一种无监督学习技术，通过聚类约束预训练房间判别器，提取隐藏的房间类型信息，并将其注入FLoc算法中以利用场景上下文。

Result: 在两个标准FLoc基准测试中，该方法优于现有技术，显著提升了鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 通过利用视觉场景上下文信息，该方法有效解决了FLoc中的定位模糊问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplan remains consistent over time and is inherently
robust to changes in visual appearance, visual Floorplan Localization (FLoc)
has received increasing attention from researchers. However, as a compact and
minimalist representation of the building's layout, floorplans contain many
repetitive structures (e.g., hallways and corners), thus easily result in
ambiguous localization. Existing methods either pin their hopes on matching 2D
structural cues in floorplans or rely on 3D geometry-constrained visual
pre-trainings, ignoring the richer contextual information provided by visual
images. In this paper, we suggest using broader visual scene context to empower
FLoc algorithms with scene layout priors to eliminate localization uncertainty.
In particular, we propose an unsupervised learning technique with clustering
constraints to pre-train a room discriminator on self-collected unlabeled room
images. Such a discriminator can empirically extract the hidden room type of
the observed image and distinguish it from other room types. By injecting the
scene context information summarized by the discriminator into an FLoc
algorithm, the room style knowledge is effectively exploited to guide definite
visual FLoc. We conducted sufficient comparative studies on two standard visual
Floc benchmarks. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods and achieves significant improvements in robustness
and accuracy.

Result: 实验表明，MoGaFace实现了高保真头部虚拟形象重建，显著提升了新视角合成质量。

Conclusion: MoGaFace在网格初始化和真实场景下均表现优异，为3D头部建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing 3D head avatar reconstruction methods adopt a two-stage process,
relying on tracked FLAME meshes derived from facial landmarks, followed by
Gaussian-based rendering. However, misalignment between the estimated mesh and
target images often leads to suboptimal rendering quality and loss of fine
visual details. In this paper, we present MoGaFace, a novel 3D head avatar
modeling framework that continuously refines facial geometry and texture
attributes throughout the Gaussian rendering process. To address the
misalignment between estimated FLAME meshes and target images, we introduce the
Momentum-Guided Consistent Geometry module, which incorporates a
momentum-updated expression bank and an expression-aware correction mechanism
to ensure temporal and multi-view consistency. Additionally, we propose Latent
Texture Attention, which encodes compact multi-view features into head-aware
representations, enabling geometry-aware texture refinement via integration
into Gaussians. Extensive experiments show that MoGaFace achieves high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction and significantly improves novel-view synthesis
quality, even under inaccurate mesh initialization and unconstrained real-world
settings.

Method: ENN通过层共享的、学习的正交特征基（eigenbasis）重新参数化权重，强制权重动态解耦和对齐。此外，ENN还提出了无需反向传播的本地学习变体ENN-ℓ。

Result: ENN在ImageNet等大规模图像分类任务中表现优于现有方法，并在跨模态图像-文本检索中创下新基准。ENN-ℓ实现了2倍以上的训练加速，且精度超过端到端反向传播。

Conclusion: ENN通过结构化权重表示解决了传统DNN的缺陷，显著提升了性能和训练效率，为神经网络架构提供了新范式。

Abstract: The remarkable success of Deep Neural Networks(DNN) is driven by
gradient-based optimization, yet this process is often undermined by its
tendency to produce disordered weight structures, which harms feature clarity
and degrades learning dynamics. To address this fundamental representational
flaw, we introduced the Eigen Neural Network (ENN), a novel architecture that
reparameterizes each layer's weights in a layer-shared, learned orthonormal
eigenbasis. This design enforces decorrelated, well-aligned weight dynamics
axiomatically, rather than through regularization, leading to more structured
and discriminative feature representations. When integrated with standard BP,
ENN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale image
classification benchmarks, including ImageNet, and its superior representations
generalize to set a new benchmark in cross-modal image-text retrieval.
Furthermore, ENN's principled structure enables a highly efficient,
backpropagation-free(BP-free) local learning variant, ENN-$\ell$. This variant
not only resolves BP's procedural bottlenecks to achieve over 2$\times$
training speedup via parallelism, but also, remarkably, surpasses the accuracy
of end-to-end backpropagation. ENN thus presents a new architectural paradigm
that directly remedies the representational deficiencies of BP, leading to
enhanced performance and enabling a more efficient, parallelizable training
regime.

*Changqing Xu,Guoqing Sun,Yi Liu,Xinfang Liao,Yintang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ParaRevSNN通过并行化设计解决了RevSNN的高延迟问题，同时保留了内存高效的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RevSNN在训练时内存效率高，但严格顺序计算导致高延迟，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出ParaRevSNN，通过解耦可逆块间的顺序依赖实现并行计算，保留可逆性。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ParaRevSNN精度与RevSNN相当或更高，训练时间减少35.2%，推理时间降至18.15%。

Conclusion: ParaRevSNN适合资源受限场景，兼具高效内存和低延迟。

Abstract: Reversible Spiking Neural Networks (RevSNNs) enable memory-efficient training
by reconstructing forward activations during backpropagation, but suffer from
high latency due to strictly sequential computation. To overcome this
limitation, we propose ParaRevSNN, a parallel reversible SNN architecture that
decouples sequential dependencies between reversible blocks while preserving
reversibility. This design enables inter-block parallelism, significantly
accelerating training and inference while retaining the memory-saving benefits
of reversibility. Experiments on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, CIFAR10-DVS, and DVS128
Gesture demonstrate that ParaRevSNN matches or exceeds the accuracy of standard
RevSNNs, while reducing training time by up to 35.2\% and inference time to
18.15\%, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
scenarios.

*Xinyu Chen,Haotian Zhai,Can Zhang,Xiupeng Shi,Ruirui Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多缓存增强的原型测试时间适应方法（MCP），通过三个缓存优化原型构建，提升零样本设置下的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存增强TTA方法依赖低熵样本构建原型，但在分布偏移下可能不可靠，且无法保证类内紧凑性。本文发现性能与类内紧凑性正相关，因此提出改进方法。

Method: 提出MCP方法，包含三个缓存：熵缓存（低熵样本初始化原型）、对齐缓存（整合视觉与文本信息实现类内紧凑）、负缓存（高熵样本校准预测）。进一步开发MCP++框架，引入跨模态原型对齐和残差学习。

Result: 在15个下游任务中，MCP和MCP++表现出最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 多缓存和跨模态对齐显著提升了测试时间适应的性能，尤其在分布偏移下表现优异。

Abstract: In zero-shot setting, test-time adaptation adjusts pre-trained models using
unlabeled data from the test phase to enhance performance on unknown test
distributions. Existing cache-enhanced TTA methods rely on a low-entropy
criterion to select samples for prototype construction, assuming intra-class
compactness. However, low-entropy samples may be unreliable under distribution
shifts, and the resulting prototypes may not ensure compact intra-class
distributions. This study identifies a positive correlation between
cache-enhanced performance and intra-class compactness. Based on this
observation, we propose a Multi-Cache enhanced Prototype-based Test-Time
Adaptation (MCP) featuring three caches: an entropy cache for initializing
prototype representations with low-entropy samples, an align cache for
integrating visual and textual information to achieve compact intra-class
distributions, and a negative cache for prediction calibration using
high-entropy samples. We further developed MCP++, a framework incorporating
cross-modal prototype alignment and residual learning, introducing prototype
residual fine-tuning. Comparative and ablation experiments across 15 downstream
tasks demonstrate that the proposed method and framework achieve
state-of-the-art generalization performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视图开放集学习框架，通过模糊不确定性校准和视图去偏，解决了现有模型在开放集场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图学习模型因假设类别完整性而难以处理开放集场景，且视图诱导的静态偏差进一步削弱了其识别未知类别的能力。

Method: 设计了O-Mix合成策略生成虚拟样本，校准开放集模糊不确定性；引入辅助模糊感知网络捕获非典型模式；采用HSIC对比去偏模块增强视图独立性。

Result: 在多个多视图基准测试中，框架显著提升了未知类别的识别能力，同时保持了封闭集性能。

Conclusion: 该框架通过模糊校准和去偏技术，有效提升了多视图开放集学习的性能。

Abstract: Existing multi-view learning models struggle in open-set scenarios due to
their implicit assumption of class completeness. Moreover, static view-induced
biases, which arise from spurious view-label associations formed during
training, further degrade their ability to recognize unknown categories. In
this paper, we propose a multi-view open-set learning framework via ambiguity
uncertainty calibration and view-wise debiasing. To simulate ambiguous samples,
we design O-Mix, a novel synthesis strategy to generate virtual samples with
calibrated open-set ambiguity uncertainty. These samples are further processed
by an auxiliary ambiguity perception network that captures atypical patterns
for improved open-set adaptation. Furthermore, we incorporate an HSIC-based
contrastive debiasing module that enforces independence between view-specific
ambiguous and view-consistent representations, encouraging the model to learn
generalizable features. Extensive experiments on diverse multi-view benchmarks
demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently enhances unknown-class
recognition while preserving strong closed-set performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应内容补偿方法（ACCM），通过图像标题减少视觉信息损失，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的高计算成本限制了其广泛应用，现有方法在高剪枝率下性能下降严重。

Method: ACCM包括轻量级标题模型和选择器，通过自监督学习生成问题相关描述并选择合适标题。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，ACCM以更低的FLOPs显著优于现有方法（如超越SOTA 20.6%，FLOPs减少6.5%）。

Conclusion: ACCM有效解决了高剪枝率下的视觉信息损失问题，提升了模型效率。

Abstract: Despite the great success of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs), their high
computational cost severely limits their broad applications. The computational
cost of LVLMs mainly stems from the visual sequence of the input, which
consists of hundreds or even thousands of tokens. Although existing methods
have made progress by removing redundant tokens, they suffer from severe
performance degradation with high pruning rates due to the loss of visual
information. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Content Compensation Method
(ACCM), which can effectively mitigate the visual information loss via an image
caption. Specifically, ACCM comprises two key components: a lightweight caption
model and a selector. Firstly the caption model generates question-related
descriptions under the guidance of the user instruction. Then the selector
further identifies a contextually appropriate caption from multiple candidates.
Leveraging self-supervised learning, our modules could be learned efficiently
without any human or automated labeling. We conduct extensive experiments
across seven benchmarks and the results show that ACCM significantly
outperforms existing methods with lower FLOPs (e.g., surpassing SOTA by 20.6%
with 6.5% fewer FLOPs).

Motivation: 解决3DGS在真实场景中因标签噪声（如移动物体、非朗伯表面、阴影）导致的重建错误问题，现有方法效果有限或需场景特定调参。

Method: 提出OCSplats框架，结合混合噪声评估、观察认知校正和动态锚点分类流水线，实现高效噪声分类和多场景适用性。

Result: 实验表明OCSplats在不同复杂度场景中均实现领先的重建性能和精确的标签噪声分类。

Conclusion: OCSplats通过创新框架解决了3DGS的噪声问题，无需调参即可适应多场景，显著提升重建精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become one of the most promising 3D
reconstruction technologies. However, label noise in real-world scenarios-such
as moving objects, non-Lambertian surfaces, and shadows-often leads to
reconstruction errors. Existing 3DGS-Bsed anti-noise reconstruction methods
either fail to separate noise effectively or require scene-specific fine-tuning
of hyperparameters, making them difficult to apply in practice. This paper
re-examines the problem of anti-noise reconstruction from the perspective of
epistemic uncertainty, proposing a novel framework, OCSplats. By combining key
technologies such as hybrid noise assessment and observation-based cognitive
correction, the accuracy of noise classification in areas with cognitive
differences has been significantly improved. Moreover, to address the issue of
varying noise proportions in different scenarios, we have designed a label
noise classification pipeline based on dynamic anchor points. This pipeline
enables OCSplats to be applied simultaneously to scenarios with vastly
different noise proportions without adjusting parameters. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OCSplats always achieve leading reconstruction performance and
precise label noise classification in scenes of different complexity levels.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NS-Net的新检测框架，通过NULL-Space投影和对比学习改进AI生成图像的检测性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型（如GAN和扩散模型）的快速发展导致高度逼真的图像生成，引发安全领域的担忧。现有检测器在未知生成模型下表现不佳，尤其是当真实与生成图像的语义内容相似时。

Method: NS-Net利用NULL-Space投影从CLIP视觉特征中解耦语义信息，结合对比学习捕捉真实与生成图像的分布差异，并通过Patch Selection策略保留细粒度伪影。

Result: 在包含40种生成模型的开放世界基准测试中，NS-Net的检测准确率提高了7.4%，表现出对GAN和扩散模型的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: NS-Net通过解耦语义信息和保留细粒度特征，显著提升了AI生成图像检测的泛化能力和准确性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models,
has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing
concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing
detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to
generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content
between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the
use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical
limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual
features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net,
a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple
semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive
learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and
generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve
fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image
structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images
generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy,
thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and
diffusion-based image generation techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部解析方法依赖密集像素级标注，成本高且耗时。WSFP任务旨在通过弱监督（如图像级标签和自然语言描述）实现高效解析。

Method: 提出DisFaceRep框架，结合显式（共现组件解耦）和隐式（文本引导解耦损失）机制，分离共现的面部组件。

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ、LaPa和Helen数据集上，DisFaceRep显著优于现有弱监督语义分割方法。

Conclusion: WSFP任务具有挑战性，但DisFaceRep通过解耦策略有效解决了共现组件问题，为弱监督面部解析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Face parsing aims to segment facial images into key components such as eyes,
lips, and eyebrows. While existing methods rely on dense pixel-level
annotations, such annotations are expensive and labor-intensive to obtain. To
reduce annotation cost, we introduce Weakly Supervised Face Parsing (WSFP), a
new task setting that performs dense facial component segmentation using only
weak supervision, such as image-level labels and natural language descriptions.
WSFP introduces unique challenges due to the high co-occurrence and visual
similarity of facial components, which lead to ambiguous activations and
degraded parsing performance. To address this, we propose DisFaceRep, a
representation disentanglement framework designed to separate co-occurring
facial components through both explicit and implicit mechanisms. Specifically,
we introduce a co-occurring component disentanglement strategy to explicitly
reduce dataset-level bias, and a text-guided component disentanglement loss to
guide component separation using language supervision implicitly. Extensive
experiments on CelebAMask-HQ, LaPa, and Helen demonstrate the difficulty of
WSFP and the effectiveness of DisFaceRep, which significantly outperforms
existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods. The code will be
released at

Abstract: In this work, we handle a new problem of Open-Domain Open-Vocabulary (ODOV)
object detection, which considers the detection model's adaptability to the
real world including both domain and category shifts. For this problem, we
first construct a new benchmark OD-LVIS, which includes 46,949 images, covers
18 complex real-world domains and 1,203 categories, and provides a
comprehensive dataset for evaluating real-world object detection. Besides, we
develop a novel baseline method for ODOV detection.The proposed method first
leverages large language models to generate the domain-agnostic text prompts
for category embedding. It further learns the domain embedding from the given
image, which, during testing, can be integrated into the category embedding to
form the customized domain-specific category embedding for each test image. We
provide sufficient benchmark evaluations for the proposed ODOV detection task
and report the results, which verify the rationale of ODOV detection, the
usefulness of our benchmark, and the superiority of the proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常冻结预训练模型的编码器，导致任务无关表示与特定聚类需求不匹配，限制了性能。

Method: 第一阶段通过跨模态语义一致性训练轻量级聚类头；第二阶段通过自增强微调联合优化视觉编码器和聚类头。

Result: 在六个主流数据集上显著优于现有深度聚类方法，ViT-B/32模型性能甚至超越基于更大ViT-L/14的先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过跨模态语义一致性和自增强微调，有效解决了预训练模型与聚类任务的适配问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: While large language-image pre-trained models like CLIP offer powerful
generic features for image clustering, existing methods typically freeze the
encoder. This creates a fundamental mismatch between the model's task-agnostic
representations and the demands of a specific clustering task, imposing a
ceiling on performance. To break this ceiling, we propose a self-enhanced
framework based on cross-modal semantic consistency for efficient image
clustering. Our framework first builds a strong foundation via Cross-Modal
Semantic Consistency and then specializes the encoder through Self-Enhancement.
In the first stage, we focus on Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency. By mining
consistency between generated image-text pairs at the instance, cluster
assignment, and cluster center levels, we train lightweight clustering heads to
align with the rich semantics of the pre-trained model. This alignment process
is bolstered by a novel method for generating higher-quality cluster centers
and a dynamic balancing regularizer to ensure well-distributed assignments. In
the second stage, we introduce a Self-Enhanced fine-tuning strategy. The
well-aligned model from the first stage acts as a reliable pseudo-label
generator. These self-generated supervisory signals are then used to feed back
the efficient, joint optimization of the vision encoder and clustering heads,
unlocking their full potential. Extensive experiments on six mainstream
datasets show that our method outperforms existing deep clustering methods by
significant margins. Notably, our ViT-B/32 model already matches or even
surpasses the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods built upon the far larger
ViT-L/14.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STDNet的新方法，通过空间和时间差异分支解决视频深度超分辨率中的长尾分布问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频深度超分辨率在空间非平滑区域和时间变化区域存在显著的长尾分布问题，影响重建质量。

Method: STDNet包含空间差异分支和时间差异分支，分别通过动态对齐RGB特征和优先传播时间变化信息来解决长尾问题。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，STDNet优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STDNet有效解决了视频深度超分辨率中的长尾分布问题，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: Depth super-resolution has achieved impressive performance, and the
incorporation of multi-frame information further enhances reconstruction
quality. Nevertheless, statistical analyses reveal that video depth
super-resolution remains affected by pronounced long-tailed distributions, with
the long-tailed effects primarily manifesting in spatial non-smooth regions and
temporal variation zones. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
SpatioTemporal Difference Network (STDNet) comprising two core branches: a
spatial difference branch and a temporal difference branch. In the spatial
difference branch, we introduce a spatial difference mechanism to mitigate the
long-tailed issues in spatial non-smooth regions. This mechanism dynamically
aligns RGB features with learned spatial difference representations, enabling
intra-frame RGB-D aggregation for depth calibration. In the temporal difference
branch, we further design a temporal difference strategy that preferentially
propagates temporal variation information from adjacent RGB and depth frames to
the current depth frame, leveraging temporal difference representations to
achieve precise motion compensation in temporal long-tailed areas. Extensive
experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our STDNet, outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据集蒸馏在IPC或图像分辨率增大时性能下降，扩散模型虽能压缩大规模数据集但生成图像多样性不足，导致信息冗余。

Method: ACS将蒸馏数据集划分为多个课程，通过对抗性损失引导扩散采样过程，减少课程间信息重叠，生成更多样化的数据集。

Result: 在Imagewoof和ImageNet-1k上分别实现了4.1%和2.1%的性能提升。

Conclusion: ACS通过对抗性引导和课程采样，有效提升了数据集蒸馏的多样性和性能。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to encapsulate the rich information contained in
dataset into a compact distilled dataset but it faces performance degradation
as the image-per-class (IPC) setting or image resolution grows larger. Recent
advancements demonstrate that integrating diffusion generative models can
effectively facilitate the compression of large-scale datasets while
maintaining efficiency due to their superiority in matching data distribution
and summarizing representative patterns. However, images sampled from diffusion
models are always blamed for lack of diversity which may lead to information
redundancy when multiple independent sampled images are aggregated as a
distilled dataset. To address this issue, we propose Adversary-guided
Curriculum Sampling (ACS), which partitions the distilled dataset into multiple
curricula. For generating each curriculum, ACS guides diffusion sampling
process by an adversarial loss to challenge a discriminator trained on sampled
images, thus mitigating information overlap between curricula and fostering a
more diverse distilled dataset. Additionally, as the discriminator evolves with
the progression of curricula, ACS generates images from simpler to more
complex, ensuring efficient and systematic coverage of target data
informational spectrum. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
ACS, which achieves substantial improvements of 4.1\% on Imagewoof and 2.1\% on
ImageNet-1k over the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: We introduce ModelNet40-E, a new benchmark designed to assess the robustness
and calibration of point cloud classification models under synthetic LiDAR-like
noise. Unlike existing benchmarks, ModelNet40-E provides both noise-corrupted
point clouds and point-wise uncertainty annotations via Gaussian noise
parameters ({\sigma}, {\mu}), enabling fine-grained evaluation of uncertainty
modeling. We evaluate three popular models-PointNet, DGCNN, and Point

calibration metrics, and uncertainty-awareness. While all models degrade under
increasing noise, Point Transformer v3 demonstrates superior calibration, with
predicted uncertainties more closely aligned with the underlying measurement
uncertainty.

Motivation: 现有零样本图像字幕方法直接扩展到视频领域效果不佳，忽略了时间动态和多帧信息。

Method: 提出语义组解码（SGD）策略建模帧间关系，并引入关键句子选择（KSS）和概率采样监督（PSS）模块增强视频级监督。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有零样本方法，甚至与全监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: SGCap通过建模时间动态和多样化句子组，提升了零样本视频字幕的生成能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot video captioning aims to generate sentences for describing videos
without training the model on video-text pairs, which remains underexplored.
Existing zero-shot image captioning methods typically adopt a text-only
training paradigm, where a language decoder reconstructs single-sentence
embeddings obtained from CLIP. However, directly extending them to the video
domain is suboptimal, as applying average pooling over all frames neglects
temporal dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose a Semantic Group
Captioning (SGCap) method for zero-shot video captioning. In particular, it
develops the Semantic Group Decoding (SGD) strategy to employ multi-frame
information while explicitly modeling inter-frame temporal relationships.
Furthermore, existing zero-shot captioning methods that rely on cosine
similarity for sentence retrieval and reconstruct the description supervised by
a single frame-level caption, fail to provide sufficient video-level
supervision. To alleviate this, we introduce two key components, including the
Key Sentences Selection (KSS) module and the Probability Sampling Supervision
(PSS) module. The two modules construct semantically-diverse sentence groups
that models temporal dynamics and guide the model to capture inter-sentence
causal relationships, thereby enhancing its generalization ability to video
captioning. Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that SGCap
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art zero-shot alternatives and
even achieves performance competitive with fully supervised ones. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型容易生成不安全内容（如暴力或色情图像），而现有防御方法通常依赖大规模数据集且缺乏灵活性。PromptSafe旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过LLM重写不安全提示为安全版本，构建文本训练语料；优化通用软提示以在扩散去噪过程中排斥不安全内容；引入门控机制动态调整防御强度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PromptSafe的不安全生成率降至2.36%，同时保持高良性图像质量，并展现出对未知有害类别的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: PromptSafe为T2I模型提供了一种高效、灵活且可扩展的安全防御方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities but remain vulnerable to producing not-safe-for-work (NSFW)
content, such as violent or explicit imagery. While recent moderation efforts
have introduced soft prompt-guided tuning by appending defensive tokens to the
input, these approaches often rely on large-scale curated image-text datasets
and apply static, one-size-fits-all defenses at inference time. However, this
results not only in high computational cost and degraded benign image quality,
but also in limited adaptability to the diverse and nuanced safety requirements
of real-world prompts. To address these challenges, we propose PromptSafe, a
gated prompt tuning framework that combines a lightweight, text-only supervised
soft embedding with an inference-time gated control network. Instead of
training on expensive image-text datasets, we first rewrite unsafe prompts into
semantically aligned but safe alternatives using an LLM, constructing an
efficient text-only training corpus. Based on this, we optimize a universal
soft prompt that repels unsafe and attracts safe embeddings during the
diffusion denoising process. To avoid over-suppressing benign prompts, we
introduce a gated mechanism that adaptively adjusts the defensive strength
based on estimated prompt toxicity, thereby aligning defense intensity with
prompt risk and ensuring strong protection for harmful inputs while preserving
benign generation quality. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and
T2I models show that PromptSafe achieves a SOTA unsafe generation rate (2.36%),
while preserving high benign fidelity. Furthermore, PromptSafe demonstrates
strong generalization to unseen harmful categories, robust transferability
across diffusion model architectures, and resilience under adaptive adversarial
attacks, highlighting its practical value for safe and scalable deployment.

Abstract: Unsupervised stereo matching has garnered significant attention for its
independence from costly disparity annotations. Typical unsupervised methods
rely on the multi-view consistency assumption for training networks, which
suffer considerably from stereo matching ambiguities, such as repetitive
patterns and texture-less regions. A feasible solution lies in transferring 3D
geometric knowledge from a relative depth map to the stereo matching networks.
However, existing knowledge transfer methods learn depth ranking information
from randomly built sparse correspondences, which makes inefficient utilization
of 3D geometric knowledge and introduces noise from mistaken disparity
estimates. This work proposes a novel unsupervised learning framework to
address these challenges, which comprises a plug-and-play disparity confidence
estimation algorithm and two depth prior-guided loss functions. Specifically,
the local coherence consistency between neighboring disparities and their
corresponding relative depths is first checked to obtain disparity confidence.
Afterwards, quasi-dense correspondences are built using only confident
disparity estimates to facilitate efficient depth ranking learning. Finally, a
dual disparity smoothness loss is proposed to boost stereo matching performance
at disparity discontinuities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art stereo matching accuracy on the KITTI Stereo
benchmarks among all unsupervised stereo matching methods.

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is the leading approach for whole slide
image (WSI) classification, enabling efficient analysis of gigapixel pathology
slides. Recent work has introduced vision-language models (VLMs) into MIL
pipelines to incorporate medical knowledge through text-based class
descriptions rather than simple class names. However, when these methods rely
on large language models (LLMs) to generate clinical descriptions or use
fixed-length prompts to represent complex pathology concepts, the limited token
capacity of VLMs often constrains the expressiveness and richness of the
encoded class information. Additionally, descriptions generated solely by LLMs
may lack domain grounding and fine-grained medical specificity, leading to
suboptimal alignment with visual features. To address these challenges, we
propose a vision-language MIL framework with two key contributions: (1) A
grounded multi-agent description generation system that leverages curated
pathology textbooks and agent specialization (e.g., morphology, spatial
context) to produce accurate and diverse clinical descriptions; (2) A text
encoding strategy using a list of descriptions rather than a single prompt,
capturing fine-grained and complementary clinical signals for better alignment
with visual features. Integrated into a VLM-MIL pipeline, our approach shows
improved performance over single-prompt class baselines and achieves results
comparable to state-of-the-art models, as demonstrated on renal and lung cancer
datasets.

Method: 利用RGB空间的均值和标准差扰动生成新域样本，并通过高斯分布模拟扰动方向和强度不确定性，同时强制原始与增强数据的特征一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升了现有立体匹配网络的泛化性能。

Conclusion: UgDA方法简单、架构无关，能有效提升模型跨域表现。

Abstract: State-of-the-art stereo matching (SM) models trained on synthetic data often
fail to generalize to real data domains due to domain differences, such as
color, illumination, contrast, and texture. To address this challenge, we
leverage data augmentation to expand the training domain, encouraging the model
to acquire robust cross-domain feature representations instead of
domain-dependent shortcuts. This paper proposes an uncertainty-guided data
augmentation (UgDA) method, which argues that the image statistics in RGB space
(mean and standard deviation) carry the domain characteristics. Thus, samples
in unseen domains can be generated by properly perturbing these statistics.
Furthermore, to simulate more potential domains, Gaussian distributions founded
on batch-level statistics are poposed to model the unceratinty of perturbation
direction and intensity. Additionally, we further enforce feature consistency
between original and augmented data for the same scene, encouraging the model
to learn structure aware, shortcuts-invariant feature representations. Our
approach is simple, architecture-agnostic, and can be integrated into any SM
networks. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks have
demonstrated that our method can significantly improve the generalization
performance of existing SM networks.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上表现优异，AUROC分别达到66.4%、83.1%和63.4%。

Conclusion: C3D-AD框架有效解决了多类3D异常检测及持续学习问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: 3D Anomaly Detection (AD) has shown great potential in detecting anomalies or
defects of high-precision industrial products. However, existing methods are
typically trained in a class-specific manner and also lack the capability of
learning from emerging classes. In this study, we proposed a continual learning
framework named Continual 3D Anomaly Detection (C3D-AD), which can not only
learn generalized representations for multi-class point clouds but also handle
new classes emerging over time.Specifically, in the feature extraction module,
to extract generalized local features from diverse product types of different
tasks efficiently, Kernel Attention with random feature Layer (KAL) is
introduced, which normalizes the feature space. Then, to reconstruct data
correctly and continually, an efficient Kernel Attention with learnable Advisor
(KAA) mechanism is proposed, which learns the information from new categories
while discarding redundant old information within both the encoder and decoder.
Finally, to keep the representation consistency over tasks, a Reconstruction
with Parameter Perturbation (RPP) module is proposed by designing a
representation rehearsal loss function, which ensures that the model remembers
previous category information and returns category-adaptive
representation.Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an average performance of
66.4%, 83.1%, and 63.4% AUROC on Real3D-AD, Anomaly-ShapeNet, and MulSen-AD,
respectively.

Abstract: Distal myopathy represents a genetically heterogeneous group of skeletal
muscle disorders with broad clinical manifestations, posing diagnostic
challenges in radiology. To address this, we propose a novel multimodal
attention-aware fusion architecture that combines features extracted from two
distinct deep learning models, one capturing global contextual information and
the other focusing on local details, representing complementary aspects of the
input data. Uniquely, our approach integrates these features through an
attention gate mechanism, enhancing both predictive performance and
interpretability. Our method achieves a high classification accuracy on the
BUSI benchmark and a proprietary distal myopathy dataset, while also generating
clinically relevant saliency maps that support transparent decision-making in
medical diagnosis. We rigorously evaluated interpretability through (1)
functionally grounded metrics, coherence scoring against reference masks and
incremental deletion analysis, and (2) application-grounded validation with
seven expert radiologists. While our fusion strategy boosts predictive
performance relative to single-stream and alternative fusion strategies, both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations reveal persistent gaps in anatomical
specificity and clinical usefulness of the interpretability. These findings
highlight the need for richer, context-aware interpretability methods and
human-in-the-loop feedback to meet clinicians' expectations in real-world
diagnostic settings.

Method: CSINet通过跨视角窗口注意力模块（CVWin）在编码阶段补充全局和局部语义，并开发了协作扩张注意力增强解码器（CDAD）以挖掘目标方向性并整合多尺度特征。

Result: 该方法显著提升了全局和局部语义的利用，性能优于其他方法且保持较高速度。

Conclusion: CSINet通过跨视角语义交互和协作解码器，有效解决了遥感图像分割中的挑战。

Abstract: Recently, Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) has aroused
wide attention. To handle drastic scale variation of remote targets, existing
methods only use the full image as input and nest the saliency-preferring
techniques of cross-scale information interaction into traditional single-view
structure. Although effective for visually salient targets, they still struggle
in handling tiny, ambiguous ones in lots of real scenarios. In this work, we
instead propose a paralleled yet unified segmentation framework Cross-view
Semantics Interaction Network (CSINet) to solve the limitations. Motivated by
human behavior in observing targets of interest, the network orchestrates
visual cues from remote and close distances to conduct synergistic prediction.
In its every encoding stage, a Cross-View Window-attention module (CVWin) is
utilized to supplement global and local semantics into close-view and
remote-view branch features, finally promoting the unified representation of
feature in every encoding stage. In addition, we develop a Collaboratively
Dilated Attention enhanced Decoder (CDAD) to mine the orientation property of
target and meanwhile integrate cross-view multiscale features. The proposed
network seamlessly enhances the exploitation of global and local semantics,
achieving significant improvements over others while maintaining satisfactory
speed.

Conclusion: 结合生成扩散模型与统计色彩分割，为计算机辅助皮肤病学提供高效红斑检测方案。

Abstract: This study proposes a zero-shot image segmentation framework for detecting
erythema (redness of the skin) using edit-friendly inversion in diffusion
models. The method synthesizes reference images of the same patient that are
free from erythema via generative editing and then accurately aligns these
references with the original images. Color-space analysis is performed with
minimal user intervention to identify erythematous regions. This approach
significantly reduces the reliance on labeled dermatological datasets while
providing a scalable and flexible diagnostic support tool by avoiding the need
for any annotated training masks. In our initial qualitative experiments, the
pipeline successfully isolated facial erythema in diverse cases, demonstrating
performance improvements over baseline threshold-based techniques. These
results highlight the potential of combining generative diffusion models and
statistical color segmentation for computer-aided dermatology, enabling
efficient erythema detection without prior training data.

Result: 在单样本验证任务中表现优异，并在在线平台验证了有效性。

Conclusion: StyleSentinel为艺术作品版权保护提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The versatility of diffusion models in generating customized images has led
to unauthorized usage of personal artwork, which poses a significant threat to
the intellectual property of artists. Existing approaches relying on embedding
additional information, such as perturbations, watermarks, and backdoors,
suffer from limited defensive capabilities and fail to protect artwork
published online. In this paper, we propose StyleSentinel, an approach for
copyright protection of artwork by verifying an inherent stylistic fingerprint
in the artist's artwork. Specifically, we employ a semantic self-reconstruction
process to enhance stylistic expressiveness within the artwork, which
establishes a dense and style-consistent manifold foundation for feature
learning. Subsequently, we adaptively fuse multi-layer image features to encode
abstract artistic style into a compact stylistic fingerprint. Finally, we model
the target artist's style as a minimal enclosing hypersphere boundary in the
feature space, transforming complex copyright verification into a robust
one-class learning task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared with
the state-of-the-art, StyleSentinel achieves superior performance on the
one-sample verification task. We also demonstrate the effectiveness through
online platforms.

Result: 在多个公开数据集上，ViLaCo显著优于现有方法，检测和定位精度达到最优。

Conclusion: ViLaCo通过结合视觉-语言模型和对比一致性模块，有效弥补弱监督不足，提升伪造定位性能。

Abstract: Image forgery localization aims to precisely identify tampered regions within
images, but it commonly depends on costly pixel-level annotations. To alleviate
this annotation burden, weakly supervised image forgery localization (WSIFL)
has emerged, yet existing methods still achieve limited localization
performance as they mainly exploit intra-image consistency clues and lack
external semantic guidance to compensate for weak supervision. In this paper,
we propose ViLaCo, a vision-language collaborative reasoning framework that
introduces auxiliary semantic supervision distilled from pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs), enabling accurate pixel-level localization using
only image-level labels. Specifically, ViLaCo first incorporates semantic
knowledge through a vision-language feature modeling network, which jointly
extracts textual and visual priors using pre-trained VLMs. Next, an adaptive
vision-language reasoning network aligns textual semantics and visual features
through mutual interactions, producing semantically aligned representations.
Subsequently, these representations are passed into dual prediction heads,
where the coarse head performs image-level classification and the fine head
generates pixel-level localization masks, thereby bridging the gap between weak
supervision and fine-grained localization. Moreover, a contrastive patch
consistency module is introduced to cluster tampered features while separating
authentic ones, facilitating more reliable forgery discrimination. Extensive
experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that ViLaCo substantially
outperforms existing WSIFL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
both detection and localization accuracy.

Conclusion: RandSF.Q通过改进transitioner设计和训练策略，实现了视频OCL的显著进步。

Abstract: Unsupervised video Object-Centric Learning (OCL) is promising as it enables
object-level scene representation and dynamics modeling as we humans do.
Mainstream video OCL methods adopt a recurrent architecture: An aggregator
aggregates current video frame into object features, termed slots, under some
queries; A transitioner transits current slots to queries for the next frame.
This is an effective architecture but all existing implementations both
(\textit{i1}) neglect to incorporate next frame features, the most informative
source for query prediction, and (\textit{i2}) fail to learn transition
dynamics, the knowledge essential for query prediction. To address these
issues, we propose Random Slot-Feature pair for learning Query prediction
(RandSF.Q): (\textit{t1}) We design a new transitioner to incorporate both
slots and features, which provides more information for query prediction;
(\textit{t2}) We train the transitioner to predict queries from slot-feature
pairs randomly sampled from available recurrences, which drives it to learn
transition dynamics. Experiments on scene representation demonstrate that our
method surpass existing video OCL methods significantly, e.g., up to 10 points
on object discovery, setting new state-of-the-art. Such superiority also
benefits downstream tasks like dynamics modeling. Our core source code and
training logs are available as the supplement.

Abstract: False positives in pedestrian detection remain a challenge that has yet to be
effectively resolved. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Full-stage
Refined Proposal (FRP) algorithm aimed at eliminating these false positives
within a two-stage CNN-based pedestrian detection framework. The main
innovation of this work lies in employing various pedestrian feature
re-evaluation strategies to filter out low-quality pedestrian proposals during
both the training and testing stages. Specifically, in the training phase, the
Training mode FRP algorithm (TFRP) introduces a novel approach for validating
pedestrian proposals to effectively guide the model training process, thereby
constructing a model with strong capabilities for false positive suppression.
During the inference phase, two innovative strategies are implemented: the
Classifier-guided FRP (CFRP) algorithm integrates a pedestrian classifier into
the proposal generation pipeline to yield high-quality proposals through
pedestrian feature evaluation, and the Split-proposal FRP (SFRP) algorithm
vertically divides all proposals, sending both the original and the sub-region
proposals to the subsequent subnetwork to evaluate their confidence scores,
filtering out those with lower sub-region pedestrian confidence scores. As a
result, the proposed algorithm enhances the model's ability to suppress
pedestrian false positives across all stages. Various experiments conducted on
multiple benchmarks and the SY-Metro datasets demonstrate that the model,
supported by different combinations of the FRP algorithm, can effectively
eliminate false positives to varying extents. Furthermore, experiments
conducted on embedded platforms underscore the algorithm's effectiveness in
enhancing the comprehensive pedestrian detection capabilities of the small
pedestrian detector in resource-constrained edge devices.

Conclusion: FWA和LOLViT有效解决了计算饱和问题，提升了轻量级混合模型的性能。

Abstract: Currently, lightweight hybrid backbone networks have partially alleviated the
issue of computational saturation, but the imbalance in computational
efficiencys between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention
mechanisms is becoming increasingly apparent. Specifically, although linear
attention mechanisms and their variants have made progress in lightweight
design, they still fail to meet the demands of hybrid models for long-sequence
modeling. On the other hand, existing lightweight SoftMax attention
computations typically reduce the feature map to a fixed size to decrease the
number of sequences, thereby compressing the computational scale. However, the
process of determining the feature map reduction ratio is cumbersome, and
computational saturation issues still persist. To address this issue, this
paper proposes a lightweight SoftMax attention mechanism with adaptive feature
map sizes, named Fast Window Attention (FWA), which generates a small number of
key sequences (Key and Value) through window aggregation for attention
computation. Additionally, it explains the rationality of using ReLU to
simulate SoftMax operations in lightweight global attention mechanisms.
Finally, the paper designs a global-local feature fusion mechanism and combines
it with GhostNet to propose a lightweight hybrid backbone network, LOLViT.
Through visual tasks such as classification (ImageNet 1K), detection (COCO
2017), and segmentation (BDD100K), along with extensive ablation studies, it is
demonstrated that LOLViT outperforms CNN models of the same level in both

*Josef X. Biberstein,Guilherme Cavalheiro,Juyeop Han,Sertac Karaman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为神经地形图（NTM）的方法，通过神经体积渲染技术直接从卫星图像学习地形图，避免了传统多视点立体流程的繁琐预处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多视点立体流程生成数字地形图（DTM）需要大量手动预处理，效率低下。随着机器人探索任务的复杂性增加，高质量DTM的需求日益迫切。

Method: 采用神经体积渲染技术，仅需图像像素的轨迹信息，无需深度或其他结构先验，直接从卫星图像学习地形图。

Result: 在合成和真实卫星数据（地球和火星）上验证，覆盖面积约100平方公里。地形预测精度接近卫星图像分辨率，即使相机参数不完美。

Conclusion: NTM方法在生成高质量DTM方面表现出潜力，优于传统方法，尤其在处理复杂场景时更具优势。

Abstract: Digital terrain maps (DTMs) are an important part of planetary exploration,
enabling operations such as terrain relative navigation during entry, descent,
and landing for spacecraft and aiding in navigation on the ground. As robotic
exploration missions become more ambitious, the need for high quality DTMs will
only increase. However, producing DTMs via multi-view stereo pipelines for
satellite imagery, the current state-of-the-art, can be cumbersome and require
significant manual image preprocessing to produce satisfactory results. In this
work, we seek to address these shortcomings by adapting neural volume rendering
techniques to learn textured digital terrain maps directly from satellite
imagery. Our method, neural terrain maps (NTM), only requires the locus for
each image pixel and does not rely on depth or any other structural priors. We
demonstrate our method on both synthetic and real satellite data from Earth and
Mars encompassing scenes on the order of $100 \textrm{km}^2$. We evaluate the
accuracy of our output terrain maps by comparing with existing high-quality
DTMs produced using traditional multi-view stereo pipelines. Our method shows
promising results, with the precision of terrain prediction almost equal to the
resolution of the satellite images even in the presence of imperfect camera
intrinsics and extrinsics.

*Pouya Parsa,Keya Li,Kara M. Kockelman,Seongjin Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了利用大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在手持智能手机和非静态车载摄像头拍摄的视频中实现自动车牌识别（ALPR）和车辆品牌型号识别的方法，并提出了包含自反思模块的改进方案，实验结果显示其性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ALPR解决方案依赖专用硬件和手工OCR流程，在动态摄像头条件下性能下降。研究旨在利用VLMs的先进能力，为动态视频分析提供低成本、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 提出两种流程：ALPR流程通过筛选清晰帧并发送多模态提示至VLM；车辆品牌型号识别流程使用相同VLM，并可选加入自反思模块，通过对比查询图像与参考数据集纠正错误。

Result: 在智能手机数据集上，ALPR和品牌型号识别的Top-1准确率分别为91.67%和66.67%；在公开UFPR-ALPR数据集上分别为83.05%和61.07%。自反思模块平均提升品牌型号识别准确率5.72%。

Conclusion: VLMs为动态交通视频分析提供了一种经济高效的解决方案，尤其在非静态摄像头条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) and vehicle make and model
recognition underpin intelligent transportation systems, supporting law
enforcement, toll collection, and post-incident investigation. Applying these
methods to videos captured by handheld smartphones or non-static
vehicle-mounted cameras presents unique challenges compared to fixed
installations, including frequent camera motion, varying viewpoints,
occlusions, and unknown road geometry. Traditional ALPR solutions, dependent on
specialized hardware and handcrafted OCR pipelines, often degrade under these
conditions. Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) enable
direct recognition of textual and semantic attributes from arbitrary imagery.
This study evaluates the potential of VLMs for ALPR and makes and models
recognition using monocular videos captured with handheld smartphones and
non-static mounted cameras. The proposed license plate recognition pipeline
filters to sharp frames, then sends a multimodal prompt to a VLM using several
prompt strategies. Make and model recognition pipeline runs the same VLM with a
revised prompt and an optional self-reflection module. In the self-reflection
module, the model contrasts the query image with a reference from a 134-class
dataset, correcting mismatches. Experiments on a smartphone dataset collected
on the campus of the University of Texas at Austin, achieve top-1 accuracies of
91.67% for ALPR and 66.67% for make and model recognition. On the public
UFPR-ALPR dataset, the approach attains 83.05% and 61.07%, respectively. The
self-reflection module further improves results by 5.72% on average for make
and model recognition. These findings demonstrate that VLMs provide a
cost-effective solution for scalable, in-motion traffic video analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种开放属性识别任务（OAPR），用于解决行人属性识别（PAR）中未见属性的检索问题，并提出了一个通用框架和重构数据集。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法基于闭集假设，无法处理现实场景中出现的未见属性，且预定义属性缺乏区分性。

Method: 提出OAPR任务，设计通用框架学习可泛化的身体部位表示，并重构四个数据集。

Result: 实验验证了OAPR任务的必要性和框架的有效性。

Conclusion: OAPR任务和提出的框架为开放属性识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) plays a crucial role in various vision
tasks such as person retrieval and identification. Most existing
attribute-based retrieval methods operate under the closed-set assumption that
all attribute classes are consistently available during both training and
inference. However, this assumption limits their applicability in real-world
scenarios where novel attributes may emerge. Moreover, predefined attributes in
benchmark datasets are often generic and shared across individuals, making them
less discriminative for retrieving the target person. To address these
challenges, we propose the Open-Attribute Recognition for Person Retrieval
(OAPR) task, which aims to retrieve individuals based on attribute cues,
regardless of whether those attributes were seen during training. To support
this task, we introduce a novel framework designed to learn generalizable body
part representations that cover a broad range of attribute categories.
Furthermore, we reconstruct four widely used datasets for open-attribute
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the
necessity of the OAPR task and the effectiveness of our framework. The source
code and pre-trained models will be publicly available upon publication.

### [167] [Spatial-Frequency Aware for Object Detection in RAW Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01396)
*Zhuohua Ye,Liming Zhang,Hongru Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于空间和频率域的RAW图像目标检测增强框架（SFAE），通过频率域特征恢复被抑制的细节，并结合空间域特征进行多模态交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要在空间域处理RAW图像，难以有效恢复因动态范围和线性响应而丢失的细节。频率域能自然分离特征（如轮廓和纹理），因此提出结合空间和频率域的方法。

Method: 提出SFAE框架：1）将频率带“空间化”，转化为可感知的空间图；2）开发跨域融合注意力模块，实现空间和频率特征的多模态交互；3）通过预测和应用不同gamma参数进行自适应非线性调整。

Result: SFAE框架有效结合空间和频率域特征，提升了RAW图像中目标细节的恢复能力。

Conclusion: 结合空间和频率域的方法能更有效地处理RAW图像的动态范围和线性响应问题，为目标检测提供更丰富的细节信息。

Abstract: Direct RAW-based object detection offers great promise by utilizing RAW data
(unprocessed sensor data), but faces inherent challenges due to its wide
dynamic range and linear response, which tends to suppress crucial object
details. In particular, existing enhancement methods are almost all performed
in the spatial domain, making it difficult to effectively recover these
suppressed details from the skewed pixel distribution of RAW images. To address
this limitation, we turn to the frequency domain, where features, such as
object contours and textures, can be naturally separated based on frequency. In
this paper, we propose Space-Frequency Aware RAW Image Object Detection
Enhancer (SFAE), a novel framework that synergizes spatial and frequency
representations. Our contribution is threefold. The first lies in the
``spatialization" of frequency bands. Different from the traditional paradigm
of directly manipulating abstract spectra in deep networks, our method
inversely transforms individual frequency bands back into tangible spatial
maps, thus preserving direct physical intuition. Then the cross-domain fusion
attention module is developed to enable deep multimodal interactions between
these maps and the original spatial features. Finally, the framework performs
adaptive nonlinear adjustments by predicting and applying different gamma
parameters for the two domains.

Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测方法与人类认知分析存在差距，需要一种既能识别真实性又能提供解释的方法。

Method: ForenX结合MLLMs和专用提示，专注于伪造特征；引入ForgReason数据集，结合LLM和人工标注优化数据。

Result: ForenX在两大基准测试中表现优异，解释能力通过主观评估验证。

Conclusion: ForenX通过MLLMs和专用数据集，显著提升了AI生成图像的检测和解释能力。

Abstract: Advances in generative models have led to AI-generated images visually
indistinguishable from authentic ones. Despite numerous studies on detecting
AI-generated images with classifiers, a gap persists between such methods and
human cognitive forensic analysis. We present ForenX, a novel method that not
only identifies the authenticity of images but also provides explanations that
resonate with human thoughts. ForenX employs the powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) to analyze and interpret forensic cues. Furthermore, we
overcome the limitations of standard MLLMs in detecting forgeries by
incorporating a specialized forensic prompt that directs the MLLMs attention to
forgery-indicative attributes. This approach not only enhance the
generalization of forgery detection but also empowers the MLLMs to provide
explanations that are accurate, relevant, and comprehensive. Additionally, we
introduce ForgReason, a dataset dedicated to descriptions of forgery evidences
in AI-generated images. Curated through collaboration between an LLM-based
agent and a team of human annotators, this process provides refined data that
further enhances our model's performance. We demonstrate that even limited
manual annotations significantly improve explanation quality. We evaluate the
effectiveness of ForenX on two major benchmarks. The model's explainability is
verified by comprehensive subjective evaluations.

TL;DR: 3DRot是一种几何一致的图像增强方法，通过旋转和镜像图像并同步更新相关数据，提升3D任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB-based 3D任务中标注稀缺、昂贵且数据增强工具不足的问题。

Method: 提出3DRot方法，通过旋转和镜像图像并同步更新RGB图像、相机参数、物体位姿和3D标注，保持几何一致性。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集上，3DRot显著提升了3D检测任务的性能指标。

Conclusion: 3DRot是一种即插即用的增强方法，可轻松迁移到其他3D任务中。

Abstract: RGB-based 3D tasks, e.g., 3D detection, depth estimation, 3D keypoint
estimation, still suffer from scarce, expensive annotations and a thin
augmentation toolbox, since most image transforms, including resize and
rotation, disrupt geometric consistency. In this paper, we introduce 3DRot, a
plug-and-play augmentation that rotates and mirrors images about the camera's
optical center while synchronously updating RGB images, camera intrinsics,
object poses, and 3D annotations to preserve projective geometry-achieving
geometry-consistent rotations and reflections without relying on any scene
depth. We validate 3DRot with a classical 3D task, monocular 3D detection. On
SUN RGB-D dataset, 3DRot raises $IoU_{3D}$ from 43.21 to 44.51, cuts rotation
error (ROT) from 22.91$^\circ$ to 20.93$^\circ$, and boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from
35.70 to 38.11. As a comparison, Cube R-CNN adds 3 other datasets together with
SUN RGB-D for monocular 3D estimation, with a similar mechanism and test
dataset, increases $IoU_{3D}$ from 36.2 to 37.8, boosts $mAP_{0.5}$ from 34.7
to 35.4. Because it operates purely through camera-space transforms, 3DRot is
readily transferable to other 3D tasks.

TL;DR: SPECTRUM是一种时频协同模型，通过多域表示学习提升在线手写验证（OHV）性能，结合时域和频域特征，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OHV方法仅使用时域特征，忽略了频域信息的潜力，SPECTRUM旨在通过多域学习提升验证性能。

Method: 模型包含多尺度交互器、自门控融合模块和多域距离验证器，协同整合时频特征。

Result: 实验表明SPECTRUM性能优于现有OHV方法，验证了多域学习的有效性。

Conclusion: 多域学习不仅提升OHV性能，还为跨域研究提供了新方向，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SPECTRUM, a temporal-frequency synergistic model
that unlocks the untapped potential of multi-domain representation learning for
online handwriting verification (OHV). SPECTRUM comprises three core
components: (1) a multi-scale interactor that finely combines temporal and
frequency features through dual-modal sequence interaction and multi-scale
aggregation, (2) a self-gated fusion module that dynamically integrates global
temporal and frequency features via self-driven balancing. These two components
work synergistically to achieve micro-to-macro spectral-temporal integration.
(3) A multi-domain distance-based verifier then utilizes both temporal and
frequency representations to improve discrimination between genuine and forged
handwriting, surpassing conventional temporal-only approaches. Extensive
experiments demonstrate SPECTRUM's superior performance over existing OHV
methods, underscoring the effectiveness of temporal-frequency multi-domain
learning. Furthermore, we reveal that incorporating multiple handwritten
biometrics fundamentally enhances the discriminative power of handwriting
representations and facilitates verification. These findings not only validate
the efficacy of multi-domain learning in OHV but also pave the way for future
research in multi-domain approaches across both feature and biometric domains.

Conclusion: 提出的多粒度非局部自相似性先验模型在高光谱图像恢复中表现出色，适用于多样化缺失场景。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) recovery, as an upstream image processing task,
  holds significant importance for downstream tasks such as classification,
  segmentation, and detection. In recent years, HSI recovery methods based on
  non-local prior representations have demonstrated outstanding performance.
However,
  these methods employ a fixed-format factor to represent the non-local
self-similarity
  tensor groups, making them unable to adapt to diverse missing scenarios. To
address
  this issue, we introduce the concept of granularity in tensor decomposition
for the first
  time and propose an HSI recovery model constrained by multi-granularity
non-local
  self-similarity priors. Specifically, the proposed model alternately performs
  coarse-grained decomposition and fine-grained decomposition on the non-local
  self-similarity tensor groups. Among them, the coarse-grained decomposition
builds
  upon Tucker tensor decomposition, which extracts global structural
information of the
  image by performing singular value shrinkage on the mode-unfolded matrices.
The
  fine-grained decomposition employs the FCTN decomposition, capturing local
detail
  information through modeling pairwise correlations among factor tensors. This
  architectural approach achieves a unified representation of global, local,
and non-local
  priors for HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the model has strong
  applicability and exhibits outstanding recovery effects in various types of
missing
  scenes such as pixels and stripes.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical step in computational biomedical image
analysis, typically evaluated using metrics like the Dice coefficient during
training and validation. However, in clinical settings without manual
annotations, assessing segmentation quality becomes challenging, and models
lacking reliability indicators face adoption barriers. To address this gap, we
propose a novel framework for predicting segmentation quality without requiring
ground truth annotations during test time. Our approach introduces two
complementary frameworks: one leveraging predicted segmentation and uncertainty
maps, and another integrating the original input image, uncertainty maps, and
predicted segmentation maps. We present Bayesian adaptations of two benchmark
segmentation models-SwinUNet and Feature Pyramid Network with ResNet50-using
Monte Carlo Dropout, Ensemble, and Test Time Augmentation to quantify
uncertainty. We evaluate four uncertainty estimates: confidence map, entropy,
mutual information, and expected pairwise Kullback-Leibler divergence on 2D
skin lesion and 3D liver segmentation datasets, analyzing their correlation
with segmentation quality metrics. Our framework achieves an R2 score of 93.25
and Pearson correlation of 96.58 on the HAM10000 dataset, outperforming
previous segmentation quality assessment methods. For 3D liver segmentation,
Test Time Augmentation with entropy achieves an R2 score of 85.03 and a Pearson
correlation of 65.02, demonstrating cross-modality robustness. Additionally, we
propose an aggregation strategy that combines multiple uncertainty estimates
into a single score per image, offering a more robust and comprehensive
assessment of segmentation quality. Finally, we use Grad-CAM and UMAP-based
embedding analysis to interpret the model's behavior and reliability,
highlighting the impact of uncertainty integration.

Conclusion: Can3Tok为场景级3D生成提供了有效解决方案，并支持图像到3DGS和文本到3DGS的下游任务。

Abstract: 3D generation has made significant progress, however, it still largely
remains at the object-level. Feedforward 3D scene-level generation has been
rarely explored due to the lack of models capable of scaling-up latent
representation learning on 3D scene-level data. Unlike object-level generative
models, which are trained on well-labeled 3D data in a bounded canonical space,
scene-level generations with 3D scenes represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) are unbounded and exhibit scale inconsistency across different scenes,
making unified latent representation learning for generative purposes extremely
challenging. In this paper, we introduce Can3Tok, the first 3D scene-level
variational autoencoder (VAE) capable of encoding a large number of Gaussian
primitives into a low-dimensional latent embedding, which effectively captures
both semantic and spatial information of the inputs. Beyond model design, we
propose a general pipeline for 3D scene data processing to address scale
inconsistency issue. We validate our method on the recent scene-level 3D
dataset DL3DV-10K, where we found that only Can3Tok successfully generalizes to
novel 3D scenes, while compared methods fail to converge on even a few hundred
scene inputs during training and exhibit zero generalization ability during
inference. Finally, we demonstrate image-to-3DGS and text-to-3DGS generation as
our applications to demonstrate its ability to facilitate downstream generation
tasks.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient brain tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge
in neuroimaging due to the heterogeneous nature of tumor subregions and the
high computational cost of volumetric inference. In this paper, we propose
EfficientGFormer, a novel architecture that integrates pretrained foundation
models with graph-based reasoning and lightweight efficiency mechanisms for
robust 3D brain tumor segmentation. Our framework leverages nnFormer as a
modality-aware encoder, transforming multi-modal MRI volumes into patch-level
embeddings. These features are structured into a dual-edge graph that captures
both spatial adjacency and semantic similarity. A pruned, edge-type-aware Graph
Attention Network (GAT) enables efficient relational reasoning across tumor
subregions, while a distillation module transfers knowledge from a
full-capacity teacher to a compact student model for real-time deployment.
Experiments on the MSD Task01 and BraTS 2021 datasets demonstrate that
EfficientGFormer achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with significantly reduced
memory and inference time, outperforming recent transformer-based and

Conclusion: MiraGe通过生成器不变特征学习，显著提升了AI生成图像检测的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have highlighted the need for robust
detectors capable of distinguishing real images from AI-generated images. While
existing methods perform well on known generators, their performance often
declines when tested with newly emerging or unseen generative models due to
overlapping feature embeddings that hinder accurate cross-generator
classification. In this paper, we propose Multimodal Discriminative
Representation Learning for Generalizable AI-generated Image Detection
(MiraGe), a method designed to learn generator-invariant features. Motivated by
theoretical insights on intra-class variation minimization and inter-class
separation, MiraGe tightly aligns features within the same class while
maximizing separation between classes, enhancing feature discriminability.
Moreover, we apply multimodal prompt learning to further refine these
principles into CLIP, leveraging text embeddings as semantic anchors for
effective discriminative representation learning, thereby improving
generalizability. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show
that MiraGe achieves state-of-the-art performance, maintaining robustness even
against unseen generators like Sora.

Abstract: While recent multimodal models have shown progress in vision-language tasks,
small-scale variants still struggle with the fine-grained temporal reasoning
required for video understanding. We introduce ReasonAct, a method that
enhances video reasoning in smaller models through a three-stage training
process: first building a foundation with text-only reasoning, then fine-tuning
on video, and finally refining with temporal-aware reinforcement learning. We
build upon Temporal Group Relative Policy Optimization (T-GRPO) by
incorporating temporal consistency modeling into policy optimization. We also
propose a biomechanically-motivated sub-action decomposition mechanism that
provides graduated rewards for constituent action phases. Through experiments
on HMDB51, UCF-101, and Kinetics-400, our 3B-parameter model achieves 67.2%,
94.1%, and 78.9% accuracy respectively, demonstrating improvements of 17.9,

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in
recent years, enabling a diverse array of applications in everyday life.
However, the substantial computational and storage demands of VLMs pose
significant challenges for their efficient deployment on mobile devices, which
represent the most ubiquitous and accessible computing platforms today. In this
work, we introduce MagicVL-2B, a novel VLM meticulously optimized for flagship
smartphones. MagicVL-2B leverages a lightweight visual encoder with fewer than
100M parameters and features a redesigned dynamic resolution scheme that
adaptively generates image tokens without excessive modification of image
dimensions. To further enhance the performance of this compact encoder within
VLMs, we propose a multimodal curriculum learning strategy that incrementally
increases task difficulty and data information density throughout training.
This approach substantially improves the model's performance across a variety
of sub-tasks. Extensive evaluations on standard VLM benchmarks demonstrate that
MagicVL-2B matches the accuracy of current state-of-the-art models while
reducing on-device power consumption by 41.1%. These results establish

TL;DR: E-VRAG是一种高效的视频检索增强生成框架，通过分层查询分解和轻量级VLM评分，显著降低计算成本并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频RAG方法在检索效率和准确性之间难以平衡，尤其面对复杂视频内容时表现不佳。

Method: 提出E-VRAG框架，包括帧预过滤、轻量级VLM评分、全局统计分布优化的帧检索策略，以及多视角问答方案。

Result: 在四个公共基准测试中，E-VRAG实现了约70%的计算成本降低，且准确性高于基线方法。

Conclusion: E-VRAG无需额外训练即可显著提升视频RAG任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled substantial progress in video
understanding by leveraging cross-modal reasoning capabilities. However, their
effectiveness is limited by the restricted context window and the high
computational cost required to process long videos with thousands of frames.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this challenge by selecting only
the most relevant frames as input, thereby reducing the computational burden.
Nevertheless, existing video RAG methods struggle to balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy, particularly when handling diverse and complex video
content. To address these limitations, we propose E-VRAG, a novel and efficient
video RAG framework for video understanding. We first apply a frame
pre-filtering method based on hierarchical query decomposition to eliminate
irrelevant frames, reducing computational costs at the data level. We then
employ a lightweight VLM for frame scoring, further reducing computational
costs at the model level. Additionally, we propose a frame retrieval strategy
that leverages the global statistical distribution of inter-frame scores to
mitigate the potential performance degradation from using a lightweight VLM.
Finally, we introduce a multi-view question answering scheme for the retrieved
frames, enhancing the VLM's capability to extract and comprehend information
from long video contexts. Experiments on four public benchmarks show that
E-VRAG achieves about 70% reduction in computational cost and higher accuracy
compared to baseline methods, all without additional training. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of E-VRAG in improving both efficiency and
accuracy for video RAG tasks.

Motivation: 现有固定压缩比方法无法适应不同复杂度的场景，导致信息丢失和性能下降。

Method: 提出GlimpsePrune框架，通过单次前向传递动态剪枝无关视觉标记。

Result: 剪枝92.6%的视觉标记，完全保留基线性能；增强版GlimpsePrune+性能提升至基线110%。

Conclusion: GlimpsePrune为构建更强大高效的LVLMs提供了新途径。

Abstract: Visual token compression is critical for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
to efficiently process high-resolution inputs. Existing methods that typically
adopt fixed compression ratios cannot adapt to scenes of varying complexity,
often causing imprecise pruning that discards informative visual tokens and
results in degraded model performance. To address this issue, we introduce a
dynamic pruning framework, GlimpsePrune, inspired by human cognition. It takes
a data-driven ''glimpse'' and prunes irrelevant visual tokens in a single
forward pass before answer generation. This approach prunes 92.6% of visual
tokens while on average fully retaining the baseline performance on free-form
VQA tasks. The reduced computational cost also enables more effective
fine-tuning: an enhanced GlimpsePrune+ achieves 110% of the baseline
performance while maintaining a similarly high pruning rate. Our work paves a
new way for building more powerful and efficient LVLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有适配方法依赖人工设计，耗时且需经验，受LLM代码生成启发，提出自动搜索高效适配算法。

Method: 采用两阶段LLM辅助进化算法，分阶段优化特征选择和逻辑计算，结合低精度代码转换和在线执行监控。

Result: 在8-shot图像分类任务中，EvoVLMA发现的算法比人工设计的APE算法准确率提升1.91%。

Conclusion: EvoVLMA为预训练多模态模型的适配算法自动化优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been exploited in various
Computer Vision tasks (e.g., few-shot recognition) via model adaptation, such
as prompt tuning and adapters. However, existing adaptation methods are
designed by human experts, requiring significant time cost and experience.
Inspired by recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) based code
generation, we propose an Evolutionary Vision-Language Model Adaptation
(EvoVLMA) method to automatically search training-free efficient adaptation
algorithms for VLMs. We recognize feature selection and logits computation as
the key functions in training-free VLM adaptation, and propose a two-stage
LLM-assisted evolutionary algorithm for optimizing these parts in a sequential
manner, effectively addressing the challenge posed by the expansive search
space through a divide-and-conquer strategy. Besides, to enhance the stability
and efficiency of searching process, we propose low-precision code conversion,
web based code execution and process monitoring, leading to a highly effective
automatic algorithm design system. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
algorithms found by EvoVLMA can obtain promising results compared to previous
manually-designed ones. More specifically, in the 8-shot image classification
setting, the classical APE algorithm can be improved by 1.91 points in
recognition accuracy. This research opens new possibilities for automating the
optimization of adaptation algorithms of pre-trained multimodal models. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于历史感知的自适应LiDAR扫描框架，显著降低能耗并保持3D目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR传感器因密集扫描和忽略时间连续性导致冗余和能耗高，限制了资源受限平台的应用。

Method: 采用轻量级预测网络和可微分掩码生成器，基于历史数据预测感兴趣区域（ROI），并稀疏扫描非关键区域。

Result: 在nuScenes和Lyft基准测试中，能耗降低65%以上，3D目标检测性能与传统方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: 自适应扫描框架有效解决了LiDAR冗余扫描问题，显著提升了能效和实用性。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion using LiDAR and RGB cameras significantly enhances 3D
object detection task. However, conventional LiDAR sensors perform dense,
stateless scans, ignoring the strong temporal continuity in real-world scenes.
This leads to substantial sensing redundancy and excessive power consumption,
limiting their practicality on resource-constrained platforms. To address this
inefficiency, we propose a predictive, history-aware adaptive scanning
framework that anticipates informative regions of interest (ROI) based on past
observations. Our approach introduces a lightweight predictor network that
distills historical spatial and temporal contexts into refined query
embeddings. These embeddings guide a differentiable Mask Generator network,
which leverages Gumbel-Softmax sampling to produce binary masks identifying
critical ROIs for the upcoming frame. Our method significantly reduces
unnecessary data acquisition by concentrating dense LiDAR scanning only within
these ROIs and sparsely sampling elsewhere. Experiments on nuScenes and Lyft
benchmarks demonstrate that our adaptive scanning strategy reduces LiDAR energy
consumption by over 65% while maintaining competitive or even superior 3D
object detection performance compared to traditional LiDAR-camera fusion
methods with dense LiDAR scanning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐私法规（如GDPR和CCPA）要求用户数据可撤回，需从模型中完全移除数据影响，而ViTs的随机数据遗忘问题尤为复杂。

Method: 通过选择性掩码实验揭示ViTs特性，提出LetheViT方法，利用掩码和原始图像输入生成正负对数，指导模型遗忘特定数据。

Result: LetheViT在隐私合规与模型性能间取得平衡，达到最先进效果。

Conclusion: LetheViT为ViTs提供了一种高效的数据遗忘解决方案，满足隐私法规需求。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks with
their exceptional performance. However, the introduction of privacy regulations
such as GDPR and CCPA has brought new challenges to them. These laws grant
users the right to withdraw their data, necessitating not only the deletion of
data but also the complete removal of its influence from trained models.
Machine unlearning emerges as a critical solution, with exact unlearning being
computationally prohibitive and approximate methods offering a more practical
approach. This work addresses the particularly challenging scenario of random
data forgetting in ViTs, where the model must forget specific samples while
retaining others, even within the same class. We first reveal the core
characteristics of ViTs through selective masking experiments: when
high-attention areas are masked, the model retains its recognition capability
but significantly weakens its memorization ability. Based on the above
insights, we propose LetheViT, a contrastive unlearning method tailored for
ViTs. LetheViT uses masked image inputs to generate positive logits and
original image inputs to generate negative logits, guiding the model to forget
specific details while retaining the general cl category outlines. Experimental
results demonstrate that LetheViT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
effectively balancing privacy compliance with model efficacy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在图像处理中缺乏对拓扑结构的敏感性，而拓扑结构（如连通性和环）对理解图像内容（如生物医学对象）至关重要。

Method: 利用持久同调（PH）编码图像块的几何和拓扑特征，生成持久图（PDs）并将其向量化为多通道图像表示（TopoImage）。进一步通过多种过滤函数生成多视图TopoImages，并与输入图像融合用于分类。

Result: 在三个公共医学图像分类数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: TopoImages方法具有高度通用性，可无缝集成到常见深度学习框架中，为数据分析和分类任务提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Topological structures in image data, such as connected components and loops,
play a crucial role in understanding image content (e.g., biomedical objects).
% Despite remarkable successes of numerous image processing methods that rely
on appearance information, these methods often lack sensitivity to topological
structures when used in general deep learning (DL) frameworks. % In this paper,
we introduce a new general approach, called TopoImages (for Topology Images),
which computes a new representation of input images by encoding local topology
of patches. % In TopoImages, we leverage persistent homology (PH) to encode
geometric and topological features inherent in image patches. % Our main
objective is to capture topological information in local patches of an input
image into a vectorized form. % Specifically, we first compute persistence
diagrams (PDs) of the patches, % and then vectorize and arrange these PDs into
long vectors for pixels of the patches. % The resulting multi-channel
image-form representation is called a TopoImage. % TopoImages offers a new
perspective for data analysis. % To garner diverse and significant topological
features in image data and ensure a more comprehensive and enriched
representation, we further generate multiple TopoImages of the input image
using various filtration functions, which we call multi-view TopoImages. % The
multi-view TopoImages are fused with the input image for DL-based
classification, with considerable improvement. % Our TopoImages approach is
highly versatile and can be seamlessly integrated into common DL frameworks.
Experiments on three public medical image classification datasets demonstrate
noticeably improved accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CLIP中丰富的文本语义先验在持续学习中的潜力，解决现有方法因忽略语义相关性导致的知识干扰问题。

Method: 提出SG-AKT模块和SE-VPR模块，分别通过文本线索评估新图像与历史知识的关联性，并利用文本嵌入优化视觉原型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了SECA框架的有效性。

Conclusion: SECA通过结合文本和视觉信息，显著提升了持续学习的性能。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a
stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of
vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP),
their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong
generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in
CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored.
During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without
considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks
that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while
text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited
plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help
bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To
address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation
(SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured
nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the
backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier.
Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is
proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge
via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive
manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype
Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using
inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统领域泛化（DG）假设目标域在训练时不可访问，但随着VFMs的出现，这一假设变得过时。SPL旨在重新定义领域迁移任务，以适应现代研究和应用需求。

Method: SPL通过动态适应和VFM中心调优实现。提出Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning方法，结合动态类感知提示器和提示引导特征聚焦器，优化VFMs在目标场景中的表现。

Conclusion: SPL为领域泛化提供了新的范式，通过动态适应和VFM调优，显著提升了模型在实际场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the concept of Set Pivot
Learning, a paradigm shift that redefines domain generalization (DG) based on
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Traditional DG assumes that the target domain
is inaccessible during training, but the emergence of VFMs, trained on vast and
diverse data, renders this assumption unclear and obsolete. Traditional DG
assumes that the target domain is inaccessible during training, but the
emergence of VFMs, which are trained on vast and diverse datasets, renders this
assumption unclear and obsolete. To address this challenge, we propose Set
Pivot Learning (SPL), a new definition of domain migration task based on VFMs,
which is more suitable for current research and application requirements.
Unlike conventional DG methods, SPL prioritizes adaptive refinement over rigid
domain transfer, ensuring continuous alignment with evolving real-world
conditions. Specifically, SPL features two key attributes: (i) Dynamic
adaptation, transitioning from static domain alignment to flexible, task-driven
feature optimization, enabling models to evolve with downstream scenarios; (ii)
VFM-centric tuning, leveraging pretrained knowledge as a pivot to hone
task-specific representations while preserving cross-domain robustness.
Building on SPL, we propose a Dynamic Prompt Fine-Tuning method, which combines
a Dynamic Class-aware Prompter with a Prompt-guided Feature Focuser, to elevate
VFM performance in targeted scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets show the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its superiority
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in generalized segmentation.

Motivation: 现有方法在随机人体运动预测中难以学习连续时间动态和避免模式崩溃，忽视了复杂运动的灵活性。

Method: STCN分为两阶段：首阶段通过时空连续网络生成平滑运动序列并引入锚点集防止模式崩溃；次阶段利用锚点集学习高斯混合分布，并通过多序列采样减少类内差异。

Result: 在Human3.6M和HumanEva-I数据集上，STCN在多样性和准确性上均表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: STCN通过两阶段设计和锚点集策略，有效提升了随机人体运动预测的性能。

Abstract: Stochastic Human Motion Prediction (HMP) has received increasing attention
due to its wide applications. Despite the rapid progress in generative fields,
existing methods often face challenges in learning continuous temporal dynamics
and predicting stochastic motion sequences. They tend to overlook the
flexibility inherent in complex human motions and are prone to mode collapse.
To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel method called STCN, for
stochastic and continuous human motion prediction, which consists of two
stages. Specifically, in the first stage, we propose a spatio-temporal
continuous network to generate smoother human motion sequences. In addition,
the anchor set is innovatively introduced into the stochastic HMP task to
prevent mode collapse, which refers to the potential human motion patterns. In
the second stage, STCN endeavors to acquire the Gaussian mixture distribution
(GMM) of observed motion sequences with the aid of the anchor set. It also
focuses on the probability associated with each anchor, and employs the
strategy of sampling multiple sequences from each anchor to alleviate
intra-class differences in human motions. Experimental results on two
widely-used datasets (Human3.6M and HumanEva-I) demonstrate that our model
obtains competitive performance on both diversity and accuracy.

Motivation: 终身行人重识别（LReID）在领域偏移下需要增量学习，但传统重放方法存储历史样本会引发隐私问题，而免样本方法又因遗忘特定知识导致性能下降。

Method: 提出Pr²R方法，将序列数据信息压缩到像素空间的重放记忆中，通过像素级变化保护隐私并提升样本代表性；在风格重放阶段，对齐当前域与先前域，同时适应重放样本风格。

Result: 实验表明，Pr²R在多个基准测试中显著提升重放效果，比现有最优方法和其他重放方法分别高出4%和6%的准确率。

Conclusion: Pr²R有效解决了隐私保护和知识遗忘问题，为终身行人重识别提供了高效且隐私友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) aims to incrementally accumulate
knowledge across a sequence of tasks under domain shifts. Recently,
replay-based methods have demonstrated strong effectiveness in LReID by
rehearsing past samples stored in an auxiliary memory. However, storing
historical exemplars raises concerns over data privacy. To avoid this,
exemplar-free approaches attempt to match the distribution of past data without
storing raw samples. Despite being privacy-friendly, these methods often suffer
from performance degradation due to the forgetting of specific past knowledge
representations. To this end, we propose to condense information from
sequential data into the pixel space in the replay memory, enabling
Privacy-Preserving Replay (Pr^2R). More specifically, by distilling the
training characteristics of multiple real images into a single image, the
condensed samples undergo pixel-level changes. This not only protects the
privacy of the original data but also makes the replay samples more
representative for sequential tasks. During the style replay phase, we align
the current domain to the previous one while simultaneously adapting the replay
samples to match the style of the current domain. This dual-alignment strategy
effectively mitigates both class-incremental challenges and forgetting caused
by domain shifts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the
proposed method significantly improves replay effectiveness while preserving
data privacy. Specifically, Pr^2R achieves 4% and 6% higher accuracy on
sequential tasks compared to the current state-of-the-art and other
replay-based methods, respectively.

Motivation: 传统方法仅依赖预训练的正常数据特征，而SNARM通过动态优化和自参考学习，增强异常信号的区分能力。

Method: SNARM计算测试图像块与训练特征库的“间残差”，并利用低残差块生成自参考块计算“内残差”，结合多头Mamba模块动态聚焦异常区域。

Conclusion: SNARM通过自参考学习和动态导航机制，显著提升了工业异常检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Self-Navigated Residual Mamba (SNARM), a novel
framework for universal industrial anomaly detection that leverages
``self-referential learning'' within test images to enhance anomaly
discrimination. Unlike conventional methods that depend solely on pre-trained
features from normal training data, SNARM dynamically refines anomaly detection
by iteratively comparing test patches against adaptively selected in-image
references. Specifically, we first compute the ``inter-residuals'' features by
contrasting test image patches with the training feature bank. Patches
exhibiting small-norm residuals (indicating high normality) are then utilized
as self-generated reference patches to compute ``intra-residuals'', amplifying
discriminative signals. These inter- and intra-residual features are
concatenated and fed into a novel Mamba module with multiple heads, which are
dynamically navigated by residual properties to focus on anomalous regions.
Finally, AD results are obtained by aggregating the outputs of a self-navigated
Mamba in an ensemble learning paradigm. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD,
MVTec 3D, and VisA benchmarks demonstrate that SNARM achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance, with notable improvements in all metrics, including
Image-AUROC, Pixel-AURC, PRO, and AP.

Conclusion: DMTrack通过双适配器设计实现了高效的时空多模态跟踪，性能优越。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore adapter tuning and introduce a novel dual-adapter
architecture for spatio-temporal multimodal tracking, dubbed DMTrack. The key
of our DMTrack lies in two simple yet effective modules, including a
spatio-temporal modality adapter (STMA) and a progressive modality
complementary adapter (PMCA) module. The former, applied to each modality
alone, aims to adjust spatio-temporal features extracted from a frozen backbone
by self-prompting, which to some extent can bridge the gap between different
modalities and thus allows better cross-modality fusion. The latter seeks to
facilitate cross-modality prompting progressively with two specially designed
pixel-wise shallow and deep adapters. The shallow adapter employs shared
parameters between the two modalities, aiming to bridge the information flow
between the two modality branches, thereby laying the foundation for following
modality fusion, while the deep adapter modulates the preliminarily fused
information flow with pixel-wise inner-modal attention and further generates
modality-aware prompts through pixel-wise inter-modal attention. With such
designs, DMTrack achieves promising spatio-temporal multimodal tracking
performance with merely \textbf{0.93M} trainable parameters. Extensive
experiments on five benchmarks show that DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art
results. Code will be available.

Conclusion: CLIMD为提升多模态疾病诊断准确性提供了有效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Clinicians usually combine information from multiple sources to achieve the
most accurate diagnosis, and this has sparked increasing interest in leveraging
multimodal deep learning for diagnosis. However, in real clinical scenarios,
due to differences in incidence rates, multimodal medical data commonly face
the issue of class imbalance, which makes it difficult to adequately learn the
features of minority classes. Most existing methods tackle this issue with
resampling or loss reweighting, but they are prone to overfitting or
underfitting and fail to capture cross-modal interactions. Therefore, we
propose a Curriculum Learning framework for Imbalanced Multimodal Diagnosis
(CLIMD). Specifically, we first design multimodal curriculum measurer that
combines two indicators, intra-modal confidence and inter-modal
complementarity, to enable the model to focus on key samples and gradually
adapt to complex category distributions. Additionally, a class
distribution-guided training scheduler is introduced, which enables the model
to progressively adapt to the imbalanced class distribution during training.
Extensive experiments on multiple multimodal medical datasets demonstrate that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across various
metrics and excels in handling imbalanced multimodal medical data. Furthermore,
as a plug-and-play CL framework, CLIMD can be easily integrated into other
models, offering a promising path for improving multimodal disease diagnosis
accuracy. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/KHan-UJS/CLIMD.

Conclusion: FG-PAN在脑肿瘤亚型分类中表现出卓越的泛化能力和分类效果。

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of brain tumor subtypes from
histopathological whole slide images is highly challenging due to subtle
morphological variations and the scarcity of annotated data. Although
vision-language models have enabled promising zero-shot classification, their
ability to capture fine-grained pathological features remains limited,
resulting in suboptimal subtype discrimination. To address these challenges, we
propose the Fine-Grained Patch Alignment Network (FG-PAN), a novel zero-shot
framework tailored for digital pathology. FG-PAN consists of two key modules:
(1) a local feature refinement module that enhances patch-level visual features
by modeling spatial relationships among representative patches, and (2) a
fine-grained text description generation module that leverages large language
models to produce pathology-aware, class-specific semantic prototypes. By
aligning refined visual features with LLM-generated fine-grained descriptions,
FG-PAN effectively increases class separability in both visual and semantic
spaces. Extensive experiments on multiple public pathology datasets, including
EBRAINS and TCGA, demonstrate that FG-PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance
and robust generalization in zero-shot brain tumor subtype classification.

*Yiheng Li,Zichang Tan,Zhen Lei,Xu Zhou,Yang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IAPL的新框架，通过自适应模块提升AI生成图像检测的灵活性，解决了现有方法对未知生成器泛化能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在检测未见过生成器的伪造图像时泛化能力有限，IAPL旨在通过自适应模块提升模型的灵活性。

Method: IAPL包含两个模块：条件信息学习器和置信驱动自适应预测，分别学习伪造特征和优化预测。

Result: 在UniversalFakeDetect和GenImage数据集上分别达到95.61%和96.7%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: IAPL通过自适应调整输入图像的提示，显著提升了检测性能，适用于多样化伪造图像。

Abstract: A major struggle for AI-generated image detection is identifying fake images
from unseen generators. Existing cutting-edge methods typically customize
pre-trained foundation models to this task via partial-parameter fine-tuning.
However, these parameters trained on a narrow range of generators may fail to
generalize to unknown sources. In light of this, we propose a novel framework
named Image-Adaptive Prompt Learning (IAPL), which enhances flexibility in
processing diverse testing images. It consists of two adaptive modules, i.e.,
the Conditional Information Learner and the Confidence-Driven Adaptive
Prediction. The former employs CNN-based feature extractors to learn
forgery-specific and image-specific conditions, which are then propagated to
learnable tokens via a gated mechanism. The latter optimizes the shallowest
learnable tokens based on a single test sample and selects the cropped view
with the highest prediction confidence for final detection. These two modules
enable the prompts fed into the foundation model to be automatically adjusted
based on the input image, rather than being fixed after training, thereby
enhancing the model's adaptability to various forged images. Extensive
experiments show that IAPL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 95.61%
and 96.7% mean accuracy on two widely used UniversalFakeDetect and GenImage
datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: IMAGEO-Bench是一个评估大型语言模型（LLMs）在图像地理定位任务中表现的基准，揭示了模型在高资源地区的优势及地理偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在图像地理定位任务中的潜力，填补现有研究的空白，并为构建地理感知AI系统提供依据。

Method: 通过IMAGEO-Bench基准，使用三个多样化数据集评估10种先进LLMs的准确性、距离误差、地理偏见和推理过程。

Result: 闭源模型表现更优，但存在地理偏见（高资源地区表现更好），成功定位依赖于城市环境、户外场景和地标识别。

Conclusion: IMAGEO-Bench为LLMs的空间推理能力提供了严谨评估，并为未来地理感知AI系统的开发提供了指导。

Abstract: Image geolocalization, the task of identifying the geographic location
depicted in an image, is important for applications in crisis response, digital
forensics, and location-based intelligence. While recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for visual reasoning, their
ability to perform image geolocalization remains underexplored. In this study,
we introduce a benchmark called IMAGEO-Bench that systematically evaluates
accuracy, distance error, geospatial bias, and reasoning process. Our benchmark
includes three diverse datasets covering global street scenes, points of
interest (POIs) in the United States, and a private collection of unseen
images. Through experiments on 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including both open-
and closed-source models, we reveal clear performance disparities, with
closed-source models generally showing stronger reasoning. Importantly, we
uncover geospatial biases as LLMs tend to perform better in high-resource
regions (e.g., North America, Western Europe, and California) while exhibiting
degraded performance in underrepresented areas. Regression diagnostics
demonstrate that successful geolocalization is primarily dependent on
recognizing urban settings, outdoor environments, street-level imagery, and
identifiable landmarks. Overall, IMAGEO-Bench provides a rigorous lens into the
spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs and offers implications for building
geolocation-aware AI systems.

Conclusion: LLaDA-MedV在生物医学图像理解任务中表现优异，能够生成更长的响应，提供更丰富的信息。

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) have long dominated the landscape of biomedical
vision-language models (VLMs). Recently, masked diffusion models such as LLaDA
have emerged as promising alternatives, yet their application in the biomedical
domain remains largely underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textbf{LLaDA-MedV}, the first large language diffusion model tailored for
biomedical image understanding through vision instruction tuning. LLaDA-MedV
achieves relative performance gains of 7.855\% over LLaVA-Med and 1.867\% over
LLaDA-V in the open-ended biomedical visual conversation task, and sets new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the closed-form subset of three VQA benchmarks:
84.93\% on VQA-RAD, 92.31\% on SLAKE, and 95.15\% on PathVQA. Furthermore, a
detailed comparison with LLaVA-Med suggests that LLaDA-MedV is capable of
generating reasonably longer responses by explicitly controlling response
length, which can lead to more informative outputs. We also conduct an in-depth
analysis of both the training and inference stages, highlighting the critical
roles of initialization weight selection, fine-tuning strategies, and the
interplay between sampling steps and response repetition. The code and model
weight is released at https://github.com/LLM-VLM-GSL/LLaDA-MedV.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合深度学习与G-PCC的预处理框架，显著提升压缩效率，同时保持兼容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: G-PCC作为国际标准虽具通用性，但压缩效率不及深度学习方法，需改进其性能而不牺牲兼容性。

Method: 提出压缩导向的体素化网络与可微分G-PCC替代模型，联合优化训练，实现端到端梯度传播。

Result: 实验显示平均BD-rate降低38.84%，且无需修改解码器，适合实际部署。

Conclusion: 该工作为提升传统压缩标准提供了实用路径，同时保持向后兼容性。

Abstract: Geometry-based point cloud compression (G-PCC), an international standard
designed by MPEG, provides a generic framework for compressing diverse types of
point clouds while ensuring interoperability across applications and devices.
However, G-PCC underperforms compared to recent deep learning-based PCC methods
despite its lower computational power consumption. To enhance the efficiency of
G-PCC without sacrificing its interoperability or computational flexibility, we
propose a novel preprocessing framework that integrates a compression-oriented
voxelization network with a differentiable G-PCC surrogate model, jointly
optimized in the training phase. The surrogate model mimics the rate-distortion
behaviour of the non-differentiable G-PCC codec, enabling end-to-end gradient
propagation. The versatile voxelization network adaptively transforms input
point clouds using learning-based voxelization and effectively manipulates
point clouds via global scaling, fine-grained pruning, and point-level editing
for rate-distortion trade-offs. During inference, only the lightweight
voxelization network is appended to the G-PCC encoder, requiring no
modifications to the decoder, thus introducing no computational overhead for
end users. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 38.84% average BD-rate reduction
over G-PCC. By bridging classical codecs with deep learning, this work offers a
practical pathway to enhance legacy compression standards while preserving
their backward compatibility, making it ideal for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: WFF模块和MJU-Glass数据集为机器人领域的玻璃表面分割提供了有效解决方案，降低了碰撞风险。

Abstract: We address the problem of glass surface segmentation with an RGB-D camera,
with a focus on effectively fusing RGB and depth information. To this end, we
propose a Weighted Feature Fusion (WFF) module that dynamically and adaptively
combines RGB and depth features to tackle issues such as transparency,
reflections, and occlusions. This module can be seamlessly integrated with
various deep neural network backbones as a plug-and-play solution.
Additionally, we introduce the MJU-Glass dataset, a comprehensive RGB-D dataset
collected by a service robot navigating real-world environments, providing a
valuable benchmark for evaluating segmentation models. Experimental results
show significant improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness, with the
WFF module enhancing performance in both mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)
and boundary IoU (bIoU), achieving a 7.49% improvement in bIoU when integrated
with PSPNet. The proposed module and dataset provide a robust framework for
advancing glass surface segmentation in robotics and reducing the risk of
collisions with glass objects.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CDSR的双尺度重建框架，通过选择性采样和局部到全局网络，仅需少量高分辨率补丁即可实现高效的WSI分析，显著提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法忽视特征提取器的设计，导致领域差距和次优表示；SSL方法虽能缓解领域差距，但仍需大量补丁且破坏组织学结构。

Method: CDSR采用两阶段选择性采样策略和局部到全局网络，仅需少量高分辨率补丁重建WSI表示。

Result: 在Camelyon16等数据集上，CDSR仅需平均7070个补丁即实现6.3%准确率和5.5% ROC曲线下面积提升。

Conclusion: CDSR在效率和形态保真度上优于现有方法，显著减少训练成本并提升性能。

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) analysis remains challenging due to the gigapixel
scale and sparsely distributed diagnostic regions. Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) mitigates this by modeling the WSI as bags of patches for slide-level
prediction. However, most MIL approaches emphasize aggregator design while
overlooking the impact of the feature extractor of the feature extraction
stage, which is often pretrained on natural images. This leads to domain gap
and suboptimal representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown
promise in bridging domain gap via pretext tasks, but it still primarily builds
upon generic backbones, thus requiring WSIs to be split into small patches.
This inevitably splits histological structures and generates both redundant and
interdependent patches, which in turn degrades aggregator performance and
drastically increases training costs. To address this challenge, we propose a
Cascaded Dual-Scale Reconstruction (CDSR) framework, demonstrating that only an
average of 9 high-resolution patches per WSI are sufficient for robust
slide-level representation. CDSR employs a two-stage selective sampling
strategy that identifies the most informative representative regions from both
model-based and semantic perspectives. These patches are then fed into a
Local-to-Global Network, which reconstructs spatially coherent high-resolution
WSI representations by integrating fine-grained local detail with global
contextual information. Unlike existing dense-sampling or SSL pipelines, CDSR
is optimized for efficiency and morphological fidelity. Experiments on
Camelyon16, TCGA-NSCLC, and TCGA-RCC demonstrate that CDSR achieves
improvements of 6.3% in accuracy and 5.5% in area under ROC curve on downstream
classification tasks with only 7,070 (4.5% of total) high-resolution patches
per dataset on average, outperforming state-of-the-art methods trained on over
10,000,000 patches.

Abstract: Realistic hair strand generation is crucial for applications like computer
graphics and virtual reality. While diffusion models can generate hairstyles
from text or images, these inputs lack precision and user-friendliness.
Instead, we propose the first sketch-based strand generation model, which
offers finer control while remaining user-friendly. Our framework tackles key
challenges, such as modeling complex strand interactions and diverse sketch
patterns, through two main innovations: a learnable strand upsampling strategy
that encodes 3D strands into multi-scale latent spaces, and a multi-scale
adaptive conditioning mechanism using a transformer with diffusion heads to
ensure consistency across granularity levels. Experiments on several benchmark
datasets show our method outperforms existing approaches in realism and
precision. Qualitative results further confirm its effectiveness. Code will be
released at [GitHub](https://github.com/fighting-Zhang/StrandDesigner).

Conclusion: DAG通过扩散模型提取通用可供性知识，显著提升了3D可供性预测的泛化性能。

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to predict the touchable regions on a 3d
object, which is crucial for human-object interaction, human-robot interaction,
embodied perception, and robot learning. Recent advances tackle this problem
via learning from demonstration images. However, these methods fail to capture
the general affordance knowledge within the image, leading to poor
generalization. To address this issue, we propose to use text-to-image
diffusion models to extract the general affordance knowledge because we find
that such models can generate semantically valid HOI images, which demonstrate
that their internal representation space is highly correlated with real-world
affordance concepts. Specifically, we introduce the DAG, a diffusion-based 3d
affordance grounding framework, which leverages the frozen internal
representations of the text-to-image diffusion model and unlocks affordance
knowledge within the diffusion model to perform 3D affordance grounding. We
further introduce an affordance block and a multi-source affordance decoder to
endow 3D dense affordance prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show
that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world
generalization.

Result: 在POPE、MME和MMHal-Bench等基准测试中，MAP显著提高了模型的真实性和性能。

Conclusion: MAP展示了基于地图级解码策略的潜力，能有效减少LVLM的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
multimodal tasks, but they still suffer from hallucinations, i.e., generating
content that is grammatically accurate but inconsistent with visual inputs. In
this work, we introduce a novel map-level perspective to mitigate
hallucinations in LVLMs, interpreting the hidden states of the model as a 2D
semantic map. We observe that factual information is widely distributed across
this map, extending beyond the localized inter- or intra-layer regions targeted
by most existing methods (e.g., contrastive decoding and layer-wise
consistency). Building on this insight, we propose Map-Level Attention
Processing (MAP), a training-free decoding method that effectively leverages
factual information through attention-based map-level operations to improve
factual consistency. Specifically, we employ Layer-Wise Criss-Cross Attention
to progressively refine token representations at each decoding layer by
aggregating tokens from both inter- and intra-layer dimensions. Additionally, a
Global-Local Logit Fusion mechanism combines logits obtained before and after
global attention to further refine predictions and improve accuracy. Our method
consistently improves the truthfulness and performance of LVLMs across
benchmarks, such as POPE, MME, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrating the potential of
the map-level decoding strategy.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖强提示（如可见掩码或边界框）且缺乏几何可解释性，难以在复杂遮挡场景中泛化。

Method: VELA通过可微分网络预测形状特定运动场，驱动水平集函数从点提示逐步演化为最终模态掩码。

Result: 在COCOA-cls、D2SA和KINS基准测试中，VELA优于现有强提示方法，仅需单点提示。

Conclusion: VELA通过几何建模在弱提示下实现高效模态分割，具有可解释性和拓扑灵活性。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation aims to recover complete object shapes, including
occluded regions with no visual appearance, whereas conventional segmentation
focuses solely on visible areas. Existing methods typically rely on strong
prompts, such as visible masks or bounding boxes, which are costly or
impractical to obtain in real-world settings. While recent approaches such as
the Segment Anything Model (SAM) support point-based prompts for guidance, they
often perform direct mask regression without explicitly modeling shape
evolution, limiting generalization in complex occlusion scenarios. Moreover,
most existing methods suffer from a black-box nature, lacking geometric
interpretability and offering limited insight into how occluded shapes are
inferred. To deal with these limitations, we propose VELA, an end-to-end
VElocity-driven Level-set Amodal segmentation method that performs explicit
contour evolution from point-based prompts. VELA first constructs an initial
level set function from image features and the point input, which then
progressively evolves into the final amodal mask under the guidance of a
shape-specific motion field predicted by a fully differentiable network. This
network learns to generate evolution dynamics at each step, enabling
geometrically grounded and topologically flexible contour modeling. Extensive
experiments on COCOA-cls, D2SA, and KINS benchmarks demonstrate that VELA
outperforms existing strongly prompted methods while requiring only a
single-point prompt, validating the effectiveness of interpretable geometric
modeling under weak guidance. The code will be publicly released.

Conclusion: ShapeMoE通过形状感知的动态路由和专家设计，实现了高效且高性能的模态分割，同时保持了良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Amodal segmentation targets to predict complete object masks, covering both
visible and occluded regions. This task poses significant challenges due to
complex occlusions and extreme shape variation, from rigid furniture to highly
deformable clothing. Existing one-size-fits-all approaches rely on a single
model to handle all shape types, struggling to capture and reason about diverse
amodal shapes due to limited representation capacity. A natural solution is to
adopt a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, assigning experts to different
shape patterns. However, naively applying MoE without considering the object's
underlying shape distribution can lead to mismatched expert routing and
insufficient expert specialization, resulting in redundant or underutilized
experts. To deal with these issues, we introduce ShapeMoE, a shape-specific
sparse Mixture-of-Experts framework for amodal segmentation. The key idea is to
learn a latent shape distribution space and dynamically route each object to a
lightweight expert tailored to its shape characteristics. Specifically,
ShapeMoE encodes each object into a compact Gaussian embedding that captures
key shape characteristics. A Shape-Aware Sparse Router then maps the object to
the most suitable expert, enabling precise and efficient shape-aware expert
routing. Each expert is designed as lightweight and specialized in predicting
occluded regions for specific shape patterns. ShapeMoE offers well
interpretability via clear shape-to-expert correspondence, while maintaining
high capacity and efficiency. Experiments on COCOA-cls, KINS, and D2SA show
that ShapeMoE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in
occluded region segmentation. The code will be released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VFMs在语义分割中面临数据规模小和域分布偏移的挑战，限制了其应用。

Method: Rein++结合Rein-G（实例感知令牌优化特征）和Rein-A（实例和逻辑级域适应），并利用SAM增强边界细节。

Result: Rein++在高效训练下显著优于现有方法，适用于大规模模型。

Conclusion: Rein++为VFMs提供了高效、泛化和自适应的语义分割解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Foundation Models(VFMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
computer vision tasks. However, their application to semantic segmentation is
hindered by two significant challenges: (1) the disparity in data scale, as
segmentation datasets are typically much smaller than those used for VFM
pre-training, and (2) domain distribution shifts, where real-world segmentation
scenarios are diverse and often underrepresented during pre-training. To
overcome these limitations, we present Rein++, an efficient VFM-based
segmentation framework that demonstrates superior generalization from limited
data and enables effective adaptation to diverse unlabeled scenarios.
Specifically, Rein++ comprises a domain generalization solution Rein-G and a
domain adaptation solution Rein-A. Rein-G introduces a set of trainable,
instance-aware tokens that effectively refine the VFM's features for the
segmentation task. This parameter-efficient approach fine-tunes less than 1% of
the backbone's parameters, enabling robust generalization. Building on the
Rein-G, Rein-A performs unsupervised domain adaptation at both the instance and
logit levels to mitigate domain shifts. In addition, it incorporates a semantic
transfer module that leverages the class-agnostic capabilities of the segment
anything model to enhance boundary details in the target domain. The integrated
Rein++ pipeline first learns a generalizable model on a source domain (e.g.,
daytime scenes) and subsequently adapts it to diverse target domains (e.g.,
nighttime scenes) without any target labels. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that Rein++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with
efficient training, underscoring its roles an efficient, generalizable, and
adaptive segmentation solution for VFMs, even for large models with billions of
parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/wloves/Rein.

Conclusion: PatchMap及其代码已公开，未来将发布完整基准（6.5B预测）以推动位置感知防御和自适应攻击研究。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks threaten the reliability of modern vision models.
We present PatchMap, the first spatially exhaustive benchmark of patch
placement, built by evaluating over 1.5e8 forward passes on ImageNet validation
images. PatchMap reveals systematic hot-spots where small patches (as little as
2% of the image) induce confident misclassifications and large drops in model
confidence. To demonstrate its utility, we propose a simple segmentation guided
placement heuristic that leverages off the shelf masks to identify vulnerable
regions without any gradient queries. Across five architectures-including
adversarially trained ResNet50, our method boosts attack success rates by 8 to
13 percentage points compared to random or fixed placements. We publicly
release PatchMap and the code implementation. The full PatchMap bench (6.5B
predictions, multiple backbones) will be released soon to further accelerate
research on location-aware defenses and adaptive attacks.

challenges in aligning multimodal information. We propose Prompt-in-Image, a
simple method that embeds textual instructions directly into images. This
removes the need for separate text inputs and forces the model to process all
content through the visual channel. We evaluate this method on three popular
open-source VLMs: Qwen2.5-VL, LLaVA-1.5, and InstructBLIP. The results reveal
sharp differences. Prompt-in-Image improves Qwen2.5-VL's performance,
increasing POPE accuracy by 4.1 percent (from 80.2 percent to 84.3 percent) and
also reducing hallucination rates on MS-COCO. In contrast, LLaVA-1.5 and
InstructBLIP experience a severe performance drop, with accuracy falling from
around 84 percent to near-random levels. Through detailed analysis, we found
that CLIP-based encoders in LLaVA and InstructBLIP exhibit excessive attention
bias toward embedded text regions, disrupting visual understanding. In
contrast, Qwen's vision encoder handles text-embedded images robustly.
Crucially, Prompt-in-Image reduces Qwen's modality gap, enhancing cross-modal
alignment by unifying information processing through a single modality.

*Yufeng Chi,Huimin Ma,Kafeng Wang,Jianmin Li*

TL;DR: DisCo3D提出了一种新框架，通过将3D一致性先验融入2D编辑器，解决了3D编辑中的多视角一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在2D图像生成和编辑中表现出色，但扩展到3D编辑时，多视角一致性难以保持，现有方法存在收敛慢、模糊和细粒度不一致等问题。

Method: 方法包括：1）用多视角输入微调3D生成器以适应场景；2）通过一致性蒸馏训练2D编辑器；3）使用高斯泼溅优化编辑后的多视角输出为3D表示。

Result: 实验表明，DisCo3D在多视角一致性上表现稳定，编辑质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DisCo3D通过结合3D先验和2D编辑，显著提升了3D编辑的一致性和质量。

Abstract: While diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable progress in 2D image
generation and editing, extending these capabilities to 3D editing remains
challenging, particularly in maintaining multi-view consistency. Classical
approaches typically update 3D representations through iterative refinement
based on a single editing view. However, these methods often suffer from slow
convergence and blurry artifacts caused by cross-view inconsistencies. Recent
methods improve efficiency by propagating 2D editing attention features, yet
still exhibit fine-grained inconsistencies and failure modes in complex scenes
due to insufficient constraints. To address this, we propose \textbf{DisCo3D},
a novel framework that distills 3D consistency priors into a 2D editor. Our
method first fine-tunes a 3D generator using multi-view inputs for scene
adaptation, then trains a 2D editor through consistency distillation. The
edited multi-view outputs are finally optimized into 3D representations via
Gaussian Splatting. Experimental results show DisCo3D achieves stable
multi-view consistency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in editing
quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出PromptReg方法，通过直接搜索对应提示简化图像配准，利用预训练分割模型实现无训练配准，并在多种医学和非医学图像上验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统区域级对应表示需先分割再匹配，步骤繁琐。本文旨在简化流程，直接通过提示搜索实现对应区域的配准。

Method: 引入“对应提示问题”，提出“逆向提示”解决方案，生成主提示和辅助提示，并通过新算法在提示和空间维度上配准多对ROI。

Result: 在多种3D和2D图像配准任务中，PromptReg在Dice和目标配准误差上优于传统和基于学习的方法，甚至接近需全标注数据的弱监督方法。

Conclusion: PromptReg通过提示搜索简化配准流程，无需训练数据，性能优越，适用于多种图像配准任务。

Abstract: Establishing pixel/voxel-level or region-level correspondences is the core
challenge in image registration. The latter, also known as region-based
correspondence representation, leverages paired regions of interest (ROIs) to
enable regional matching while preserving fine-grained capability at
pixel/voxel level. Traditionally, this representation is implemented via two
steps: segmenting ROIs in each image then matching them between the two images.
In this paper, we simplify this into one step by directly "searching for
corresponding prompts", using extensively pre-trained segmentation models
(e.g., SAM) for a training-free registration approach, PromptReg. Firstly, we
introduce the "corresponding prompt problem", which aims to identify a
corresponding Prompt Y in Image Y for any given visual Prompt X in Image X,
such that the two respectively prompt-conditioned segmentations are a pair of
corresponding ROIs from the two images. Secondly, we present an "inverse
prompt" solution that generates primary and optionally auxiliary prompts,
inverting Prompt X into the prompt space of Image Y. Thirdly, we propose a
novel registration algorithm that identifies multiple paired corresponding ROIs
by marginalizing the inverted Prompt X across both prompt and spatial
dimensions. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on five applications of
registering 3D prostate MR, 3D abdomen MR, 3D lung CT, 2D histopathology and,
as a non-medical example, 2D aerial images. Based on metrics including Dice and
target registration errors on anatomical structures, the proposed registration
outperforms both intensity-based iterative algorithms and learning-based
DDF-predicting networks, even yielding competitive performance with
weakly-supervised approaches that require fully-segmented training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在视频生成中表现优异，但给定首尾帧和文本提示生成平滑过渡视频的研究不足。

Method: VTG采用插值初始化保持对象一致性，结合双向运动微调和表示对齐正则化提升运动平滑性和生成保真度。

Result: VTG在TransitBench基准测试中，在概念混合和场景过渡任务上均表现优异。

Conclusion: VTG为统一过渡生成提供了高效解决方案，未来可进一步扩展应用场景。

Abstract: Leveraging text, images, structure maps, or motion trajectories as
conditional guidance, diffusion models have achieved great success in automated
and high-quality video generation. However, generating smooth and rational
transition videos given the first and last video frames as well as descriptive
text prompts is far underexplored. We present VTG, a Versatile Transition video
Generation framework that can generate smooth, high-fidelity, and semantically
coherent video transitions. VTG introduces interpolation-based initialization
that helps preserve object identity and handle abrupt content changes
effectively. In addition, it incorporates dual-directional motion fine-tuning
and representation alignment regularization to mitigate the limitations of
pre-trained image-to-video diffusion models in motion smoothness and generation
fidelity, respectively. To evaluate VTG and facilitate future studies on
unified transition generation, we collected TransitBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for transition generation covering two representative transition
tasks: concept blending and scene transition. Extensive experiments show that
VTG achieves superior transition performance consistently across all four
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型（Video-LLMs）对所有任务令牌采用相同静态处理路径，无法区分时间定位、显著性评估和文本生成等本质不同的任务。

Method: 提出TimeExpert，利用MoE架构动态路由任务特定令牌到专用专家，实现各子任务的精确处理。

Result: 实验表明，TimeExpert在密集视频描述、时刻检索和视频高光检测等多种VTG任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: TimeExpert通过任务分解和动态路由，显著提升了视频时间定位任务的性能，为VTG应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to precisely identify video event
segments in response to textual queries. The outputs of VTG tasks manifest as
sequences of events, each defined by precise timestamps, saliency scores, and
textual descriptions. Despite recent advances, a fundamental limitation
persists in existing Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs): they process all
task tokens through identical and static pathways, failing to recognize that
temporal localization, saliency assessment, and textual generation represent
fundamentally distinct tasks requiring specialized processing. To address this,
we introduce TimeExpert, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based Video-LLM that
effectively decomposes VTG tasks by dynamically routing task-specific tokens
(e.g., timestamps, saliency scores) to specialized experts, with increased
computational efficiency. Our design choices enable precise handling of each
subtask, leading to improved event modeling across diverse VTG applications.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeExpert consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance on various VTG tasks such as Dense Video
Captioning, Moment Retrieval, and Video Highlight Detection.

TL;DR: LT-Gaussian是一种基于3D高斯泼溅（3D-GS）的地图更新方法，通过多模态高斯泼溅、结构变化检测模块和高斯地图更新模块，高效更新自动驾驶场景中的地图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D-GS在自动驾驶地图构建中具有潜力，但其生成高斯场景的时间和计算成本高，地图更新成为挑战。

Method: LT-Gaussian包含多模态高斯泼溅、结构变化检测模块和高斯地图更新模块，通过对比旧地图与当前LiDAR数据流进行针对性更新。

Result: 实验表明，LT-Gaussian能高效更新地图，处理常见环境变化，并生成更高质量的重建结果。

Conclusion: LT-Gaussian通过利用新旧场景信息，提供了一种高效且高质量的地图更新解决方案。

Abstract: Maps play an important role in autonomous driving systems. The recently
proposed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) produces rendering-quality explicit
scene reconstruction results, demonstrating the potential for map construction
in autonomous driving scenarios. However, because of the time and computational
costs involved in generating Gaussian scenes, how to update the map becomes a
significant challenge. In this paper, we propose LT-Gaussian, a map update
method for 3D-GS-based maps. LT-Gaussian consists of three main components:
Multimodal Gaussian Splatting, Structural Change Detection Module, and
Gaussian-Map Update Module. Firstly, the Gaussian map of the old scene is
generated using our proposed Multimodal Gaussian Splatting. Subsequently,
during the map update process, we compare the outdated Gaussian map with the
current LiDAR data stream to identify structural changes. Finally, we perform
targeted updates to the Gaussian-map to generate an up-to-date map. We
establish a benchmark for map updating on the nuScenes dataset to
quantitatively evaluate our method. The experimental results show that
LT-Gaussian can effectively and efficiently update the Gaussian-map, handling
common environmental changes in autonomous driving scenarios. Furthermore, by
taking full advantage of information from both new and old scenes, LT-Gaussian
is able to produce higher quality reconstruction results compared to map update
strategies that reconstruct maps from scratch. Our open-source code is
available at https://github.com/ChengLuqi/LT-gaussian.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖视觉线索，忽略了音频语义或采用粗粒度融合策略，导致多模态表示不理想。

Method: 提出GAID框架，包含帧级门控融合（FGF）和定向自适应语义扰动（DASP），分别实现细粒度对齐和增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得最先进的检索效果，并显著提升效率。

Conclusion: GAID通过互补模块优化多模态表示，为文本-视频检索提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video retrieval requires precise alignment between language and
temporally rich video signals. Existing methods predominantly exploit visual
cues and often overlook complementary audio semantics or adopt coarse fusion
strategies, leading to suboptimal multimodal representations. We present GAID,
a framework that jointly address this gap via two key components: (i) a
Frame-level Gated Fusion (FGF) that adaptively integrates audio and visual
features under textual guidance, enabling fine-grained temporal alignment; and
(ii) a Directional Adaptive Semantic Perturbation (DASP) that injects
structure-aware perturbations into text embeddings, enhancing robustness and
discrimination without incurring multi-pass inference. These modules complement
each other -- fusion reduces modality gaps while perturbation regularizes
cross-modal matching -- yielding more stable and expressive representations.
Extensive experiments on MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, and VATEX show consistent
state-of-the-art results across all retrieval metrics with notable efficiency
gains. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangBowenn/GAID.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人辅助手术需要实时场景理解，但静态数据集训练的模型在动态手术环境中表现不佳，因此需要类增量语义分割（CISS）方法。

Result: 提出了TOPICS+方法，并发布了包含144类的Syn-Mediverse数据集作为评估基准。

Conclusion: TOPICS+在手术场景中表现更鲁棒，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgeries rely on accurate and real-time scene understanding
to safely guide surgical instruments. However, segmentation models trained on
static datasets face key limitations when deployed in these dynamic and
evolving surgical environments. Class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS)
allows models to continually adapt to new classes while avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of prior knowledge, without training on previous data. In this work,
we build upon the recently introduced Taxonomy-Oriented Poincar\'e-regularized
Incremental Class Segmentation (TOPICS) approach and propose an enhanced
variant, termed TOPICS+, specifically tailored for robust segmentation of
surgical scenes. Concretely, we incorporate the Dice loss into the hierarchical
loss formulation to handle strong class imbalances, introduce hierarchical
pseudo-labeling, and design tailored label taxonomies for robotic surgery
environments. We also propose six novel CISS benchmarks designed for robotic
surgery environments including multiple incremental steps and several semantic
categories to emulate realistic class-incremental settings in surgical
environments. In addition, we introduce a refined set of labels with more than
144 classes on the Syn-Mediverse synthetic dataset, hosted online as an
evaluation benchmark. We make the code and trained models publicly available at

Result: GCC方法能够自动发现多个与特定概念相关的电路，并在多种深度图像分类模型中验证了其有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: GCC方法首次在细粒度水平上识别与特定视觉概念相关的电路，为模型提供了深刻的、概念层面的解释。

Abstract: Deep vision models have achieved remarkable classification performance by
leveraging a hierarchical architecture in which human-interpretable concepts
emerge through the composition of individual neurons across layers. Given the
distributed nature of representations, pinpointing where specific visual
concepts are encoded within a model remains a crucial yet challenging task. In
this paper, we introduce an effective circuit discovery method, called Granular
Concept Circuit (GCC), in which each circuit represents a concept relevant to a
given query. To construct each circuit, our method iteratively assesses
inter-neuron connectivity, focusing on both functional dependencies and
semantic alignment. By automatically discovering multiple circuits, each
capturing specific concepts within that query, our approach offers a profound,
concept-wise interpretation of models and is the first to identify circuits
tied to specific visual concepts at a fine-grained level. We validate the
versatility and effectiveness of GCCs across various deep image classification
models.

Abstract: The field of Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) poses substantial
technical challenges, including fluid inter-sign transitions, the absence of
temporal boundaries, and co-articulation effects. This paper, developed for the
MSLR 2025 Workshop Challenge at ICCV 2025, addresses the critical challenge of
signer-independent recognition to advance the generalization capabilities of
CSLR systems across diverse signers. A data-centric methodology is proposed,
centered on systematic feature engineering, a robust preprocessing pipeline,
and an optimized model architecture. Key contributions include a principled
feature selection process guided by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to isolate
communicative keypoints, a rigorous preprocessing pipeline incorporating
DBSCAN-based outlier filtering and spatial normalization, and the novel
CSLRConformer architecture. This architecture adapts the hybrid CNN-Transformer
design of the Conformer model, leveraging its capacity to model local temporal
dependencies and global sequence context; a characteristic uniquely suited for
the spatio-temporal dynamics of sign language. The proposed methodology
achieved a competitive performance, with a Word Error Rate (WER) of 5.60% on
the development set and 12.01% on the test set, a result that secured a 3rd
place ranking on the official competition platform. This research validates the
efficacy of cross-domain architectural adaptation, demonstrating that the
Conformer model, originally conceived for speech recognition, can be
successfully repurposed to establish a new state-of-the-art performance in
keypoint-based CSLR.

Result: 在VisDrone2019等三个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，且无需训练即可泛化。

Conclusion: AMOT通过外观与运动的联合建模显著提升了无人机视频中的多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining
consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex
UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often
lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing
methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking
their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking
performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance
and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency
(AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically,
the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance
of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity
association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks
through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions,
thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive
experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and
VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art
methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.

Motivation: 解决多光谱/高光谱数据缺乏对应基础模型的问题，探索现有RSFMs是否能有效处理多样光谱模态而无需大量光谱预训练。

Method: 提出两阶段训练：第一阶段通过掩码重建任务和Hyper Tokenizer提取空间与光谱维度属性令牌，并设计AoMoA动态聚合多属性专家知识；第二阶段插入Are-adapter，通过高低级语义特征迭代查询聚焦任务有益属性。

Result: SpectralX能够解释新区域或季节的光谱图像，显著提升领域泛化性能。

Conclusion: SpectralX成功适配现有RSFMs处理多光谱/高光谱数据，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) have led to
significant breakthroughs in the field. While many RSFMs have been pretrained
with massive optical imagery, more multispectral/hyperspectral data remain lack
of the corresponding foundation models. To leverage the advantages of spectral
imagery in earth observation, we explore whether existing RSFMs can be
effectively adapted to process diverse spectral modalities without requiring
extensive spectral pretraining. In response to this challenge, we proposed
SpectralX, an innovative parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework that adapt
existing RSFMs as backbone while introducing a two-stage training approach to
handle various spectral inputs, thereby significantly improving domain
generalization performance. In the first stage, we employ a
masked-reconstruction task and design a specialized Hyper Tokenizer (HyperT) to
extract attribute tokens from both spatial and spectral dimensions.
Simultaneously, we develop an Attribute-oriented Mixture of Adapter (AoMoA)
that dynamically aggregates multi-attribute expert knowledge while performing
layer-wise fine-tuning. With semantic segmentation as downstream task in the
second stage, we insert an Attribute-refined Adapter (Are-adapter) into the
first stage framework. By iteratively querying low-level semantic features with
high-level representations, the model learns to focus on task-beneficial
attributes, enabling customized adjustment of RSFMs. Following this two-phase
adaptation process, SpectralX is capable of interpreting spectral imagery from
new regions or seasons. The codes will be available from the website:

Conclusion: AG$^2$aussian通过锚图结构实现了干净准确的实例级高斯选择，为多种应用提供了显著优势。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has witnessed exponential adoption across
diverse applications, driving a critical need for semantic-aware 3D Gaussian
representations to enable scene understanding and editing tasks. Existing
approaches typically attach semantic features to a collection of free Gaussians
and distill the features via differentiable rendering, leading to noisy
segmentation and a messy selection of Gaussians. In this paper, we introduce
AG$^2$aussian, a novel framework that leverages an anchor-graph structure to
organize semantic features and regulate Gaussian primitives. Our anchor-graph
structure not only promotes compact and instance-aware Gaussian distributions,
but also facilitates graph-based propagation, achieving a clean and accurate
instance-level Gaussian selection. Extensive validation across four
applications, i.e. interactive click-based query, open-vocabulary text-driven
query, object removal editing, and physics simulation, demonstrates the
advantages of our approach and its benefits to various applications. The
experiments and ablation studies further evaluate the effectiveness of the key
designs of our approach.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SEA的新型灰盒攻击方法，揭示了微调视觉语言模型（VLM）可能继承基础模型的漏洞，导致可转移的越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示微调VLM可能保留基础模型的漏洞，从而面临可转移的越狱攻击风险。

Method: SEA结合了Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation（FTS）和Targeted Prompt Guidance（TPG）两种技术，分别模拟视觉编码器的参数变化和引导语言解码器生成对抗性输出。

Result: 实验表明，SEA在Qwen2-VL家族（2B和7B）上实现了超过86.5%的转移攻击成功率，毒性率接近49.5%。

Conclusion: 研究强调了保护微调专有VLM免受基础模型漏洞影响的紧迫性，呼吁开发全生命周期防御措施。

Abstract: Fine-tuning open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) creates a critical yet
underexplored attack surface: vulnerabilities in the base VLM could be retained
in fine-tuned variants, rendering them susceptible to transferable jailbreak
attacks. To demonstrate this risk, we introduce the Simulated Ensemble Attack
(SEA), a novel grey-box jailbreak method in which the adversary has full access
to the base VLM but no knowledge of the fine-tuned target's weights or training
configuration. To improve jailbreak transferability across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA
combines two key techniques: Fine-tuning Trajectory Simulation (FTS) and
Targeted Prompt Guidance (TPG). FTS generates transferable adversarial images
by simulating the vision encoder's parameter shifts, while TPG is a textual
strategy that steers the language decoder toward adversarially optimized
outputs. Experiments on the Qwen2-VL family (2B and 7B) demonstrate that SEA
achieves high transfer attack success rates exceeding 86.5% and toxicity rates
near 49.5% across diverse fine-tuned variants, even those specifically
fine-tuned to improve safety behaviors. Notably, while direct PGD-based image
jailbreaks rarely transfer across fine-tuned VLMs, SEA reliably exploits
inherited vulnerabilities from the base model, significantly enhancing
transferability. These findings highlight an urgent need to safeguard
fine-tuned proprietary VLMs against transferable vulnerabilities inherited from
open-source foundations, motivating the development of holistic defenses across

*Qiaohui Chu,Haoyu Zhang,Meng Liu,Yisen Feng,Haoxiang Shi,Liqiang Nie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSIGHT是一个两阶段框架，通过手-物体交互特征和动词-名词共现矩阵增强动作表示，并引入强化学习模块模拟认知推理，显著提升了长期动作预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在长期动作预测中忽视手-物体交互、语义依赖和认知推理的问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 提取手-物体交互特征和动词-名词共现矩阵；2) 强化学习模块模拟认知推理（感知->推理->预测）。

Result: 在Ego4D、EPIC-Kitchens-55和EGTEA Gaze+基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: INSIGHT通过结合语义特征和认知推理，显著提升了长期动作预测的泛化能力和准确性。

Abstract: Long-term action anticipation from egocentric video is critical for
applications such as human-computer interaction and assistive technologies,
where anticipating user intent enables proactive and context-aware AI
assistance. However, existing approaches suffer from three key limitations: 1)
underutilization of fine-grained visual cues from hand-object interactions, 2)
neglect of semantic dependencies between verbs and nouns, and 3) lack of
explicit cognitive reasoning, limiting generalization and long-term forecasting
ability. To overcome these challenges, we propose INSIGHT, a unified two-stage
framework for egocentric action anticipation. In the first stage, INSIGHT
focuses on extracting semantically rich features from hand-object interaction
regions and enhances action representations using a verb-noun co-occurrence
matrix. In the second stage, it introduces a reinforcement learning-based
module that simulates explicit cognitive reasoning through a structured
process: visual perception (think) -> intention inference (reason) -> action
anticipation (answer). Extensive experiments on Ego4D, EPIC-Kitchens-55, and
EGTEA Gaze+ benchmarks show that INSIGHT achieves state-of-the-art performance,
demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capability.

### [221] [Improving Noise Efficiency in Privacy-preserving Dataset Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01749)
*Runkai Zheng,Vishnu Asutosh Dasu,Yinong Oliver Wang,Haohan Wang,Fernando De la Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新框架，通过解耦采样与优化过程并提升信号质量，显著提升了隐私保护数据集蒸馏的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习依赖大量敏感数据，隐私保护成为关键问题。差分隐私数据生成虽能保护隐私，但需要大量数据且性能受限。数据集蒸馏（DD）高效但现有方法因同步采样优化和噪声依赖导致信息利用不足。

Method: 提出新框架，解耦采样与优化，通过匹配信息子空间减少差分隐私噪声影响。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，每类50张图像时性能提升10.0%，蒸馏集大小仅为先前方法的五分之一时提升8.3%。

Conclusion: 新框架显著提升了隐私保护DD的性能，具有重要应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models heavily rely on large datasets that often
include sensitive and private information, raising serious privacy concerns.
Differentially private (DP) data generation offers a solution by creating
synthetic datasets that limit the leakage of private information within a
predefined privacy budget; however, it requires a substantial amount of data to
achieve performance comparable to models trained on the original data. To
mitigate the significant expense incurred with synthetic data generation,
Dataset Distillation (DD) stands out for its remarkable training and storage
efficiency. This efficiency is particularly advantageous when integrated with
DP mechanisms, curating compact yet informative synthetic datasets without
compromising privacy. However, current state-of-the-art private DD methods
suffer from a synchronized sampling-optimization process and the dependency on
noisy training signals from randomly initialized networks. This results in the
inefficient utilization of private information due to the addition of excessive
noise. To address these issues, we introduce a novel framework that decouples
sampling from optimization for better convergence and improves signal quality
by mitigating the impact of DP noise through matching in an informative
subspace. On CIFAR-10, our method achieves a \textbf{10.0\%} improvement with
50 images per class and \textbf{8.3\%} increase with just \textbf{one-fifth}
the distilled set size of previous state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating
significant potential to advance privacy-preserving DD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种多摄像头实时追踪系统，用于室内饲养的奶牛活动监测，结合计算机视觉技术，显著提高了追踪准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奶牛活动和行为与健康及福利相关，传统人工监测费时且不一致，需自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用六摄像头系统，结合YOLO11-m模型和SAMURAI算法进行实例分割与追踪，采用运动感知卡尔曼滤波和IoU数据关联。

Result: 系统在多目标追踪准确率（MOTA）和IDF1分数上表现优异，显著优于Deep SORT Realtime。

Conclusion: 该系统能实时追踪复杂环境中的奶牛，减少冗余检测，有望通过行为分类提升疾病早期预测能力。

Abstract: Activity and behaviour correlate with dairy cow health and welfare, making
continual and accurate monitoring crucial for disease identification and farm
productivity. Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and
inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique
multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian
dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques,
including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity
seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by
geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The
detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow
dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an
upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for
instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory.
Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman
filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for
object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT
Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two
benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity
switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex
interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces
redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows
move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction
through activity quantification and behavioural classification.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Visual Prompt Navigation（VPN）的新范式，通过用户提供的视觉提示（而非语言指令）在2D地图上引导智能体导航，减少了语言模糊性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言在复杂环境中导航时存在模糊性和冗长性问题，限制了导航效果。

Method: 提出VPN范式，基于视觉提示导航；构建R2R-VP和R2R-CE-VP数据集；设计VPNet网络，采用视图级和轨迹级数据增强策略。

Result: 实验评估了视觉提示形式、地图格式和数据增强策略对导航性能的影响。

Conclusion: VPN通过视觉提示提供直观且空间明确的导航指导，更适合非专业用户，减少了解释模糊性。

Abstract: While natural language is commonly used to guide embodied agents, the
inherent ambiguity and verbosity of language often hinder the effectiveness of
language-guided navigation in complex environments. To this end, we propose
Visual Prompt Navigation (VPN), a novel paradigm that guides agents to navigate
using only user-provided visual prompts within 2D top-view maps. This visual
prompt primarily focuses on marking the visual navigation trajectory on a
top-down view of a scene, offering intuitive and spatially grounded guidance
without relying on language instructions. It is more friendly for non-expert
users and reduces interpretive ambiguity. We build VPN tasks in both discrete
and continuous navigation settings, constructing two new datasets, R2R-VP and
R2R-CE-VP, by extending existing R2R and R2R-CE episodes with corresponding
visual prompts. Furthermore, we introduce VPNet, a dedicated baseline network
to handle the VPN tasks, with two data augmentation strategies: view-level
augmentation (altering initial headings and prompt orientations) and
trajectory-level augmentation (incorporating diverse trajectories from
large-scale 3D scenes), to enhance navigation performance. Extensive
experiments evaluate how visual prompt forms, top-view map formats, and data
augmentation strategies affect the performance of visual prompt navigation. The
code is available at https://github.com/farlit/VPN.

TL;DR: DiffSemanticFusion融合了基于栅格和基于图的表示，通过语义栅格融合BEV空间和地图扩散模块，提升了在线高精地图的稳定性和表达能力，在轨迹预测和端到端自动驾驶任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要准确理解场景，包括道路几何、交通参与者及其语义关系。现有方法中，栅格表示适合视觉模型但几何精度不足，图表示保留结构细节但依赖精确地图。

Method: 提出DiffSemanticFusion框架，结合语义栅格融合BEV空间和地图扩散模块，提升地图表示的稳定性和表达能力。

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM基准测试中，轨迹预测任务性能提升5.1%，端到端自动驾驶任务在NavHard场景中性能提升15%。

Conclusion: DiffSemanticFusion有效融合了栅格和图表示的优势，显著提升了自动驾驶任务的性能，地图扩散模块可扩展至其他向量方法。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires accurate scene understanding, including road
geometry, traffic agents, and their semantic relationships. In online HD map
generation scenarios, raster-based representations are well-suited to vision
models but lack geometric precision, while graph-based representations retain
structural detail but become unstable without precise maps. To harness the
complementary strengths of both, we propose DiffSemanticFusion -- a fusion
framework for multimodal trajectory prediction and planning. Our approach
reasons over a semantic raster-fused BEV space, enhanced by a map diffusion
module that improves both the stability and expressiveness of online HD map
representations. We validate our framework on two downstream tasks: trajectory
prediction and planning-oriented end-to-end autonomous driving. Experiments on
real-world autonomous driving benchmarks, nuScenes and NAVSIM, demonstrate
improved performance over several state-of-the-art methods. For the prediction
task on nuScenes, we integrate DiffSemanticFusion with the online HD map
informed QCNet, achieving a 5.1\% performance improvement. For end-to-end
autonomous driving in NAVSIM, DiffSemanticFusion achieves state-of-the-art
results, with a 15\% performance gain in NavHard scenarios. In addition,
extensive ablation and sensitivity studies show that our map diffusion module
can be seamlessly integrated into other vector-based approaches to enhance
performance. All artifacts are available at

TL;DR: EST-LoRA是一种无需训练的LoRA融合方法，通过综合考虑矩阵能量、风格差异分数和时间步长，自适应选择主题和风格LoRA，实现平衡生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在平衡主题和风格时表现不佳，且需要额外训练。K-LoRA虽无需训练，但涉及过多超参数，适应性差。

Method: 提出EST-LoRA，结合矩阵能量、风格差异分数和时间步长，类似MoE架构，自适应选择主题和风格LoRA。

Result: 实验表明，EST-LoRA在质量和速度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EST-LoRA是一种高效、无需训练的LoRA融合方法，显著提升生成效果。

Abstract: Fine-tuning models via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) demonstrates remarkable
performance in subject-driven or style-driven generation tasks. Studies have
explored combinations of different LoRAs to jointly generate learned styles and
content. However, current methods struggle to balance the original subject and
style, and often require additional training. Recently, K-LoRA proposed a
training-free LoRA fusion method. But it involves multiple hyperparameters,
making it difficult to adapt to all styles and subjects. In this paper, we
propose EST-LoRA, a training-free adaptive LoRA fusion method. It
comprehensively considers three critical factors: \underline{E}nergy of matrix,
\underline{S}tyle discrepancy scores and \underline{T}ime steps. Analogous to
the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture, the model adaptively selects between
subject LoRA and style LoRA within each attention layer. This integrated
selection mechanism ensures balanced contributions from both components during
the generation process. Experimental results show that EST-LoRA outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations and
achieves faster generation speed compared to other efficient fusion approaches.

Motivation: 减少肝脏手术术前规划中对肝脏血管结构先验知识的依赖，提高分割效率。

Method: 使用3D点表示CT图像，通过图推理模块学习点邻域的亲和力，隐式学习肝脏血管结构。

Result: 在MSD和LiTS数据集上，Dice系数和平均表面距离得分优于四种点基方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法无需显式肝脏血管结构先验知识，通过图推理模块实现了高效且准确的Couinaud分割。

Abstract: The preoperative planning of liver surgery relies on Couinaud segmentation
from computed tomography (CT) images, to reduce the risk of bleeding and guide
the resection procedure. Using 3D point-based representations, rather than
voxelizing the CT volume, has the benefit of preserving the physical resolution
of the CT. However, point-based representations need prior knowledge of the
liver vessel structure, which is time consuming to acquire. Here, we propose a
point-based method for Couinaud segmentation, without explicitly providing the
prior liver vessel structure. To allow the model to learn this anatomical liver
vessel structure, we add a graph reasoning module on top of the point features.
This adds implicit anatomical information to the model, by learning affinities
across point neighborhoods. Our method is competitive on the MSD and LiTS
public datasets in Dice coefficient and average surface distance scores
compared to four pioneering point-based methods. Our code is available at

Motivation: 尽管单目图像中的3D手部重建已取得进展，但在视频中生成准确且时序一致的运动估计仍具挑战性，尤其是在手与物体交互时。

Method: 采用扩散模型和物理增强的运动细化模型，利用运动捕捉数据（无需图像）训练，并整合物理知识（如关键运动状态及其约束）以提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了多种帧级重建方法的性能，在现有基准测试中达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: 该框架通过物理增强和扩散模型有效提升了手部运动恢复的准确性和一致性，尤其在交互场景中表现优异。

Abstract: While 3D hand reconstruction from monocular images has made significant
progress, generating accurate and temporally coherent motion estimates from
videos remains challenging, particularly during hand-object interactions. In
this paper, we present a novel 3D hand motion recovery framework that enhances
image-based reconstructions through a diffusion-based and physics-augmented
motion refinement model. Our model captures the distribution of refined motion
estimates conditioned on initial ones, generating improved sequences through an
iterative denoising process. Instead of relying on scarce annotated video data,
we train our model only using motion capture data without images. We identify
valuable intuitive physics knowledge during hand-object interactions, including
key motion states and their associated motion constraints. We effectively
integrate these physical insights into our diffusion model to improve its
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
improves various frame-wise reconstruction methods, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance on existing benchmarks.

Result: 通过大量实验验证了方法的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在噪声环境下表现良好，适用于实际应用中的相机位姿估计。

Abstract: This paper presents a simple algebraic method to estimate the pose of a
camera relative to a planar target from $n \geq 4$ reference points with known
coordinates in the target frame and their corresponding bearing measurements in
the camera frame. The proposed approach follows a hierarchical structure;
first, the unit vector normal to the target plane is determined, followed by
the camera's position vector, its distance to the target plane, and finally,
the full orientation. To improve the method's robustness to measurement noise,
an averaging methodology is introduced to refine the estimation of the target's
normal direction. The accuracy and robustness of the approach are validated
through extensive experiments.

TL;DR: OmniEvent是一个统一的事件表示学习框架，通过解耦-增强-融合范式解决事件数据的时空不均匀性问题，支持多种任务且无需任务特定设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机数据因时空不均匀性和非结构化分布，导致现有架构难以复用，需任务特定设计。OmniEvent旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出解耦-增强-融合范式：独立处理时空域特征，使用空间填充曲线扩大感受野并提升效率，通过注意力机制融合特征。

Result: 在3个代表性任务和10个数据集上，OmniEvent比任务特定设计的SOTA方法性能提升高达68.2%。

Conclusion: OmniEvent首次实现事件数据的统一表示学习，显著提升性能并消除任务特定设计需求。

Abstract: Event cameras have gained increasing popularity in computer vision due to
their ultra-high dynamic range and temporal resolution. However, event networks
heavily rely on task-specific designs due to the unstructured data distribution
and spatial-temporal (S-T) inhomogeneity, making it hard to reuse existing
architectures for new tasks. We propose OmniEvent, the first unified event
representation learning framework that achieves SOTA performance across diverse
tasks, fully removing the need of task-specific designs. Unlike previous
methods that treat event data as 3D point clouds with manually tuned S-T
scaling weights, OmniEvent proposes a decouple-enhance-fuse paradigm, where the
local feature aggregation and enhancement is done independently on the spatial
and temporal domains to avoid inhomogeneity issues. Space-filling curves are
applied to enable large receptive fields while improving memory and compute
efficiency. The features from individual domains are then fused by attention to
learn S-T interactions. The output of OmniEvent is a grid-shaped tensor, which
enables standard vision models to process event data without architecture
change. With a unified framework and similar hyper-parameters, OmniEvent
out-performs (tasks-specific) SOTA by up to 68.2% across 3 representative tasks
and 10 datasets (Fig.1). Code will be ready in

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against computer vision systems have emerged as a
critical research area that challenges the fundamental assumptions about neural
network robustness and security. This comprehensive survey examines the
evolving landscape of adversarial techniques, revealing their dual nature as
both sophisticated security threats and valuable defensive tools. We provide a
systematic analysis of adversarial attack methodologies across three primary
domains: pixel-space attacks, physically realizable attacks, and latent-space
attacks. Our investigation traces the technical evolution from early
gradient-based methods such as FGSM and PGD to sophisticated optimization
techniques incorporating momentum, adaptive step sizes, and advanced
transferability mechanisms. We examine how physically realizable attacks have
successfully bridged the gap between digital vulnerabilities and real-world
threats through adversarial patches, 3D textures, and dynamic optical
perturbations. Additionally, we explore the emergence of latent-space attacks
that leverage semantic structure in internal representations to create more
transferable and meaningful adversarial examples. Beyond traditional offensive
applications, we investigate the constructive use of adversarial techniques for
vulnerability assessment in biometric authentication systems and protection
against malicious generative models. Our analysis reveals critical research
gaps, particularly in neural style transfer protection and computational
efficiency requirements. This survey contributes a comprehensive taxonomy,
evolution analysis, and identification of future research directions, aiming to
advance understanding of adversarial vulnerabilities and inform the development
of more robust and trustworthy computer vision systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文引导变换器（CGT）的熵模型，通过优化时空上下文建模，显著降低了计算成本和熵建模时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件熵模型在利用时空上下文时存在模型复杂度高、计算成本大以及空间依赖顺序建模不足的问题。

Method: 设计了CGT熵模型，包括时间上下文重采样器和依赖加权的空间上下文分配器（教师-学生网络），以高效提取关键信息并明确建模空间依赖顺序。

Result: 实验表明，CGT模型将熵建模时间减少约65%，BD-Rate降低11%。

Conclusion: CGT模型通过优化时空上下文建模，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Conditional entropy models effectively leverage spatio-temporal contexts to
reduce video redundancy. However, incorporating temporal context often
introduces additional model complexity and increases computational cost. In
parallel, many existing spatial context models lack explicit modeling the
ordering of spatial dependencies, which may limit the availability of relevant
context during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Context Guided
Transformer (CGT) entropy model, which estimates probability mass functions of
the current frame conditioned on resampled temporal context and
dependency-weighted spatial context. A temporal context resampler learns
predefined latent queries to extract critical temporal information using
transformer encoders, reducing downstream computational overhead. Meanwhile, a
teacher-student network is designed as dependency-weighted spatial context
assigner to explicitly model the dependency of spatial context order. The
teacher generates an attention map to represent token importance and an entropy
map to reflect prediction certainty from randomly masked inputs, guiding the
student to select the weighted top-k tokens with the highest spatial
dependency. During inference, only the student is used to predict undecoded
tokens based on high-dependency context. Experimental results demonstrate that
our CGT model reduces entropy modeling time by approximately 65% and achieves
an 11% BD-Rate reduction compared to the previous state-of-the-art conditional
entropy model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在分类目标与非目标注视点时，通常基于明确的搜索轨迹和抽象视觉刺激，忽略了场景上下文，而人类视觉搜索受场景特征影响较大。因此，论文旨在填补这一空白，研究现实场景中的分类问题。

Method: 研究通过36名参与者的用户实验，使用140种现实场景（如桌面图标搜索和工具查找），结合眼动和EEG特征进行分类。

Result: 提出的方法在跨用户评估中达到83.6%的准确率，显著优于基于注视持续时间和眼跳相关电位的传统方法（56.9%）。

Conclusion: 该方法在现实场景中显著提升了目标与非目标注视点的分类能力，为理解用户意图和构建辅助系统提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Distinguishing target from non-target fixations during visual search is a
fundamental building block to understand users' intended actions and to build
effective assistance systems. While prior research indicated the feasibility of
classifying target vs. non-target fixations based on eye tracking and
electroencephalography (EEG) data, these studies were conducted with explicitly
instructed search trajectories, abstract visual stimuli, and disregarded any
scene context. This is in stark contrast with the fact that human visual search
is largely driven by scene characteristics and raises questions regarding
generalizability to more realistic scenarios. To close this gap, we, for the
first time, investigate the classification of target vs. non-target fixations
during free visual search in realistic scenes. In particular, we conducted a
36-participants user study using a large variety of 140 realistic visual search
scenes in two highly relevant application scenarios: searching for icons on
desktop backgrounds and finding tools in a cluttered workshop. Our approach
based on gaze and EEG features outperforms the previous state-of-the-art
approach based on a combination of fixation duration and saccade-related
potentials. We perform extensive evaluations to assess the generalizability of
our approach across scene types. Our approach significantly advances the
ability to distinguish between target and non-target fixations in realistic
scenarios, achieving 83.6% accuracy in cross-user evaluations. This
substantially outperforms previous methods based on saccade-related potentials,
which reached only 56.9% accuracy.

TL;DR: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）存在严重的物体幻觉问题，研究发现其原因是模态偏差，即模型难以同时关注视觉和文本模态。作者提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过调整注意力权重和对比解码策略来缓解幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在理解和推理方面表现优异，但存在物体幻觉问题。以往研究认为这是由视觉编码器与大型语言模型（LLMs）规模不匹配导致的，但本文发现模态偏差（忽视视觉和文本模态）是更关键的原因。

Method: 提出一种无需训练的方法，通过干预和调整视觉与文本标记的注意力权重，平衡跨模态兼容性，并结合对比解码策略减少对参数知识的依赖。

Result: 实验证实模态偏差在LVLMs中普遍存在，该方法在多个开源LVLMs和基准测试中有效缓解了幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 模态偏差是LVLMs幻觉问题的重要原因，提出的方法简单有效，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
comprehension and reasoning capabilities, but they still suffer from severe
object hallucination. Previous studies primarily attribute the flaw to
linguistic prior caused by the scale mismatch between visual encoders and large
language models (LLMs) in LVLMs. Specifically, as current LVLMs are built upon
LLMs, they tend to over-rely on textual prompts and internal knowledge of LLMs,
generating descriptions inconsistent with visual cues. However, through an
in-depth investigation of the hallucinated mechanisms, we empirically reveal a
previously overlooked phenomenon: LVLMs may ignore not only visual information
but also textual modality during hallucination, a behavior termed as modality
bias, which indicates that LVLMs struggle to simultaneously attend to both
visual and textual modalities, leading to fragmented understanding of
user-provided instructions. Based on this observation, we propose a simple yet
effective training-free method to mitigate object hallucination. Concretely, we
intervene and adjust the attention weights of textual and visual tokens,
balancing cross-modal compatibility for better alignment with user intentions.
Furthermore, we adopt a contrastive decoding strategy to reduce the LVLM's
overreliance on its parametric knowledge, synergistically enhancing our
attention manipulation. Extensive experiments confirm the widespread presence
of modality bias in LVLMs. Notably, our method effectively mitigates
hallucination across multiple open-source LVLMs and benchmarks, highlighting
its generalizability and efficacy.

Result: 在跨数据集和数据集内测试中表现优异，检测精度高且能精确定位伪造痕迹。

Conclusion: DiffusionFF在检测精度和伪造痕迹定位方面均表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of deepfake generation techniques demands robust and
accurate face forgery detection algorithms. While determining whether an image
has been manipulated remains essential, the ability to precisely localize
forgery artifacts has become increasingly important for improving model
explainability and fostering user trust. To address this challenge, we propose
DiffusionFF, a novel framework that enhances face forgery detection through
diffusion-based artifact localization. Our method utilizes a denoising
diffusion model to generate high-quality Structural Dissimilarity (DSSIM) maps,
which effectively capture subtle traces of manipulation. These DSSIM maps are
then fused with high-level semantic features extracted by a pretrained forgery
detector, leading to significant improvements in detection accuracy. Extensive
experiments on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffusionFF not only achieves superior detection performance but also offers
precise and fine-grained artifact localization, highlighting its overall
effectiveness.

TL;DR: 提出StreamAgent，通过预测未来任务相关信息的时间和空间区域，实现主动响应，结合问题语义和历史观察，优化感知动作，并通过KV-cache机制提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频流理解（如自动驾驶和智能监控）需要连续感知和主动决策，现有方法缺乏任务驱动规划和未来预测，限制了实时响应能力。

Method: 集成问题语义和历史观察，预测关键事件的时间进展，调整感知动作（如关注任务相关区域或持续跟踪），并设计KV-cache内存机制以高效检索。

Result: 在流式视频和长视频理解任务中，方法在响应准确性和实时效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: StreamAgent在实时视频流场景中具有实际应用价值，提升了主动决策和响应能力。

Abstract: Real-time streaming video understanding in domains such as autonomous driving
and intelligent surveillance poses challenges beyond conventional offline video
processing, requiring continuous perception, proactive decision making, and
responsive interaction based on dynamically evolving visual content. However,
existing methods rely on alternating perception-reaction or asynchronous
triggers, lacking task-driven planning and future anticipation, which limits
their real-time responsiveness and proactive decision making in evolving video
streams. To this end, we propose a StreamAgent that anticipates the temporal
intervals and spatial regions expected to contain future task-relevant
information to enable proactive and goal-driven responses. Specifically, we
integrate question semantics and historical observations through prompting the
anticipatory agent to anticipate the temporal progression of key events, align
current observations with the expected future evidence, and subsequently adjust
the perception action (e.g., attending to task-relevant regions or continuously
tracking in subsequent frames). To enable efficient inference, we design a
streaming KV-cache memory mechanism that constructs a hierarchical memory
structure for selective recall of relevant tokens, enabling efficient semantic
retrieval while reducing the overhead of storing all tokens in the traditional
KV-cache. Extensive experiments on streaming and long video understanding tasks
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in response accuracy
and real-time efficiency, highlighting its practical value for real-world
streaming scenarios.

Motivation: 医学影像研究依赖大规模数据共享，但患者隐私保护是主要挑战。现有去标识化工具缺乏客观评估方法，限制了可重复性和监管信心。

Method: 开发了包含合成PHI/PII的DICOM数据集（MIDI），并提供了评估工具（Python脚本、答案键和映射文件），支持自动化比较去标识化效果。

Result: MIDI数据集包含538名受试者、53,581个DICOM图像实例，覆盖多种设备和癌症类型。评估框架符合HIPAA和DICOM标准。

Conclusion: 该框架为医学图像去标识化提供了客观、标准化的评估方法，促进了更安全和一致的医学图像共享。

Abstract: Medical imaging research increasingly depends on large-scale data sharing to
promote reproducibility and train Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. Ensuring
patient privacy remains a significant challenge for open-access data sharing.
Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM), the global standard
data format for medical imaging, encodes both essential clinical metadata and
extensive protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable
information (PII). Effective de-identification must remove identifiers,
preserve scientific utility, and maintain DICOM validity. Tools exist to
perform de-identification, but few assess its effectiveness, and most rely on
subjective reviews, limiting reproducibility and regulatory confidence. To
address this gap, we developed an openly accessible DICOM dataset infused with
synthetic PHI/PII and an evaluation framework for benchmarking image
de-identification workflows. The Medical Image de-identification (MIDI) dataset
was built using publicly available de-identified data from The Cancer Imaging
Archive (TCIA). It includes 538 subjects (216 for validation, 322 for testing),
605 studies, 708 series, and 53,581 DICOM image instances. These span multiple
vendors, imaging modalities, and cancer types. Synthetic PHI and PII were
embedded into structured data elements, plain text data elements, and pixel
data to simulate real-world identity leaks encountered by TCIA curation teams.
Accompanying evaluation tools include a Python script, answer keys (known
truth), and mapping files that enable automated comparison of curated data
against expected transformations. The framework is aligned with the HIPAA
Privacy Rule "Safe Harbor" method, DICOM PS3.15 Confidentiality Profiles, and
TCIA best practices. It supports objective, standards-driven evaluation of
de-identification workflows, promoting safer and more consistent medical image
sharing.

TL;DR: EgoTrigger利用音频线索智能激活摄像头，显著降低能耗，同时保持人类记忆增强功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全天智能眼镜在连续感知和多模态AI代理集成中的能源效率问题。

Method: 采用轻量级音频模型（YAMNet）和自定义分类头，通过手-物交互音频线索触发图像捕捉。

Result: 平均减少54%的帧数，显著节省能源，同时保持任务性能。

Conclusion: EgoTrigger为全天候智能眼镜提供了一种节能且功能强大的解决方案。

Abstract: All-day smart glasses are likely to emerge as platforms capable of continuous
contextual sensing, uniquely positioning them for unprecedented assistance in
our daily lives. Integrating the multi-modal AI agents required for human
memory enhancement while performing continuous sensing, however, presents a
major energy efficiency challenge for all-day usage. Achieving this balance
requires intelligent, context-aware sensor management. Our approach,
EgoTrigger, leverages audio cues from the microphone to selectively activate
power-intensive cameras, enabling efficient sensing while preserving
substantial utility for human memory enhancement. EgoTrigger uses a lightweight
audio model (YAMNet) and a custom classification head to trigger image capture
from hand-object interaction (HOI) audio cues, such as the sound of a drawer
opening or a medication bottle being opened. In addition to evaluating on the
QA-Ego4D dataset, we introduce and evaluate on the Human Memory Enhancement
Question-Answer (HME-QA) dataset. Our dataset contains 340 human-annotated
first-person QA pairs from full-length Ego4D videos that were curated to ensure
that they contained audio, focusing on HOI moments critical for contextual
understanding and memory. Our results show EgoTrigger can use 54% fewer frames
on average, significantly saving energy in both power-hungry sensing components
(e.g., cameras) and downstream operations (e.g., wireless transmission), while
achieving comparable performance on datasets for an episodic memory task. We
believe this context-aware triggering strategy represents a promising direction
for enabling energy-efficient, functional smart glasses capable of all-day use
-- supporting applications like helping users recall where they placed their
keys or information about their routine activities (e.g., taking medications).

TL;DR: 论文评估了基于语言驱动的统一视觉语言模型（VLM）在工业检测中的可行性，发现其虽在分类和关键点任务中表现良好，但在核心检测指标上不及传统模型，且存在鲁棒性和视觉基础不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业检测中管理多个任务专用模型复杂且低效，统一视觉语言模型（VLM）可能简化流程，但其实际可行性需验证。

Method: 使用基于Florence-2的InspectVLM模型，并在新的大规模多模态数据集InspectMM上进行训练和评估。

Result: InspectVLM在图像分类和关键点任务中表现良好，但在核心检测指标上不及ResNet模型，且对提示变化敏感、检测任务表现差、易依赖记忆回答。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在视觉基础和鲁棒性上不足，不适合用于精度要求高的工业检测，语言驱动的统一模型仍需改进。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (VLMs) promise to streamline computer vision
pipelines by reframing multiple visual tasks such as classification, detection,
and keypoint localization within a single language-driven interface. This
architecture is particularly appealing in industrial inspection, where managing
disjoint task-specific models introduces complexity, inefficiency, and
maintenance overhead. In this paper, we critically evaluate the viability of
this unified paradigm using InspectVLM, a Florence-2-based VLM trained on
InspectMM, our new large-scale multimodal, multitask inspection dataset. While
InspectVLM performs competitively on image-level classification and structured
keypoint tasks, we find that it fails to match traditional ResNet-based models
in core inspection metrics. Notably, the model exhibits brittle behavior under
low prompt variability, produces degenerate outputs for fine-grained object
detection, and frequently defaults to memorized language responses regardless
of visual input. Our findings suggest that while language-driven unification
offers conceptual elegance, current VLMs lack the visual grounding and
robustness necessary for deployment in precision critical industrial
inspections.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is critical in biomedical imaging to accurately
distinguish individual objects like cells, which often overlap and vary in
size. Recent query-based methods, where object queries guide segmentation, have
shown strong performance. While U-Net has been a go-to architecture in medical
image segmentation, its potential in query-based approaches remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we present IAUNet, a novel query-based U-Net
architecture. The core design features a full U-Net architecture, enhanced by a
novel lightweight convolutional Pixel decoder, making the model more efficient
and reducing the number of parameters. Additionally, we propose a Transformer
decoder that refines object-specific features across multiple scales. Finally,
we introduce the 2025 Revvity Full Cell Segmentation Dataset, a unique resource
with detailed annotations of overlapping cell cytoplasm in brightfield images,
setting a new benchmark for biomedical instance segmentation. Experiments on
multiple public datasets and our own show that IAUNet outperforms most
state-of-the-art fully convolutional, transformer-based, and query-based models
and cell segmentation-specific models, setting a strong baseline for cell
instance segmentation tasks. Code is available at

Result: 在CIFAR-10和GTSRB上，DBOM能鲁棒检测中毒图像，提升DNN训练管道的安全性。

Conclusion: DBOM为零样本泛化到新触发-对象配对提供了解决方案，增强了对抗攻击模式的理解。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) and generative AI (GenAI) are increasingly
vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where adversaries embed triggers into inputs to
cause models to misclassify or misinterpret target labels. Beyond traditional
single-trigger scenarios, attackers may inject multiple triggers across various
object classes, forming unseen backdoor-object configurations that evade
standard detection pipelines. In this paper, we introduce DBOM (Disentangled
Backdoor-Object Modeling), a proactive framework that leverages structured
disentanglement to identify and neutralize both seen and unseen backdoor
threats at the dataset level. Specifically, DBOM factorizes input image
representations by modeling triggers and objects as independent primitives in
the embedding space through the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By
leveraging the frozen, pre-trained encoders of VLMs, our approach decomposes
the latent representations into distinct components through a learnable visual
prompt repository and prompt prefix tuning, ensuring that the relationships
between triggers and objects are explicitly captured. To separate trigger and
object representations in the visual prompt repository, we introduce the
trigger-object separation and diversity losses that aids in disentangling
trigger and object visual features. Next, by aligning image features with
feature decomposition and fusion, as well as learned contextual prompt tokens
in a shared multimodal space, DBOM enables zero-shot generalization to novel
trigger-object pairings that were unseen during training, thereby offering
deeper insights into adversarial attack patterns. Experimental results on
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB demonstrate that DBOM robustly detects poisoned images prior
to downstream training, significantly enhancing the security of DNN training
pipelines.

To benchmark our method and foster further research, we introduce two newly

estimation; datasets of this nature remain rare in the current literature. The
proposed framework has been validated through extensive comparative analyses on
these datasets, demonstrating that our system achieves superior performance in

applications such as aerial navigation, search and rescue, and automated
inspection.

Motivation: 减少对大规模标注数据的依赖，提升目标检测器在有限标注数据下的性能。

Method: 使用SimCLR框架对YOLOv5和YOLOv8的卷积主干进行预训练，采用全局池化和投影头，并在COCO无标签数据集上优化对比损失。随后在有限标注数据的任务上进行微调。

Result: SSL预训练显著提升了mAP、收敛速度和精确率-召回率性能，尤其是在低标注数据情况下。例如，SimCLR预训练的YOLOv8在mAP@50:95上达到0.7663，优于监督学习版本。

Conclusion: 对比SSL为单阶段检测器提供了强大的基线，展示了无标签数据在高效目标检测中的潜力。

Abstract: One-stage object detectors such as the YOLO family achieve state-of-the-art
performance in real-time vision applications but remain heavily reliant on
large-scale labeled datasets for training. In this work, we present a
systematic study of contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) as a means to
reduce this dependency by pretraining YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 backbones on unlabeled
images using the SimCLR framework. Our approach introduces a simple yet
effective pipeline that adapts YOLO's convolutional backbones as encoders,
employs global pooling and projection heads, and optimizes a contrastive loss
using augmentations of the COCO unlabeled dataset (120k images). The pretrained
backbones are then fine-tuned on a cyclist detection task with limited labeled
data. Experimental results show that SSL pretraining leads to consistently
higher mAP, faster convergence, and improved precision-recall performance,
especially in low-label regimes. For example, our SimCLR-pretrained YOLOv8
achieves a mAP@50:95 of 0.7663, outperforming its supervised counterpart
despite using no annotations during pretraining. These findings establish a
strong baseline for applying contrastive SSL to one-stage detectors and
highlight the potential of unlabeled data as a scalable resource for
label-efficient object detection.

Abstract: Point clouds are essential for object modeling and play a critical role in
assisting driving tasks for autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, the significant
volume of data generated by AVs creates challenges for storage, bandwidth, and
processing cost. To tackle these challenges, we propose a representative point
selection framework for point cloud downsampling, which preserves critical
object-related information while effectively filtering out irrelevant
background points. Our method involves two steps: (1) Object Presence
Detection, where we introduce an unsupervised density peak-based classifier and
a supervised Na\"ive Bayes classifier to handle diverse scenarios, and (2)
Sampling Budget Allocation, where we propose a strategy that selects
object-relevant points while maintaining a high retention rate of object
information. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes datasets
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
in both efficiency and effectiveness across varying sampling rates. As a
model-agnostic solution, our approach integrates seamlessly with diverse
downstream models, making it a valuable and scalable addition to the 3D point
cloud downsampling toolkit for AV applications.

Abstract: Existing human motion Q\&A methods rely on explicit program execution, where
the requirement for manually defined functional modules may limit the
scalability and adaptability. To overcome this, we propose an implicit
program-guided motion reasoning (IMoRe) framework that unifies reasoning across
multiple query types without manually designed modules. Unlike existing
implicit reasoning approaches that infer reasoning operations from question
words, our model directly conditions on structured program functions, ensuring
a more precise execution of reasoning steps. Additionally, we introduce a
program-guided reading mechanism, which dynamically selects multi-level motion
representations from a pretrained motion Vision Transformer (ViT), capturing
both high-level semantics and fine-grained motion cues. The reasoning module
iteratively refines memory representations, leveraging structured program
functions to extract relevant information for different query types. Our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Babel-QA and generalizes to a newly
constructed motion Q\&A dataset based on HuMMan, demonstrating its adaptability
across different motion reasoning datasets. Code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: As the application of deep learning in dermatology continues to grow, the
recognition of melanoma has garnered significant attention, demonstrating
potential for improving diagnostic accuracy. Despite advancements in image
classification techniques, existing models still face challenges in identifying
subtle visual cues that differentiate melanoma from benign lesions. This paper
presents a novel Deeply Dual Supervised Learning framework that integrates
local and global feature extraction to enhance melanoma recognition. By
employing a dual-pathway structure, the model focuses on both fine-grained
local features and broader contextual information, ensuring a comprehensive
understanding of the image content. The framework utilizes a dual attention
mechanism that dynamically emphasizes critical features, thereby reducing the
risk of overlooking subtle characteristics of melanoma. Additionally, we
introduce a multi-scale feature aggregation strategy to ensure robust
performance across varying image resolutions. Extensive experiments on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in melanoma detection, achieving higher accuracy and
better resilience against false positives. This work lays the foundation for
future research in automated skin cancer recognition and highlights the
effectiveness of dual supervised learning in medical image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将测量数据和隐藏场景建模为三维，忽略了大多数隐藏物体的二维特性，导致高计算成本和内存消耗，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用二维函数表示隐藏场景，并采用Quasi-Fresnel变换建立测量数据与隐藏场景之间的直接反演公式。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了计算效率，使轻量级设备（如移动和嵌入式系统）实现实时高分辨率NLOS成像成为可能，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging seeks to reconstruct hidden objects by
analyzing reflections from intermediary surfaces. Existing methods typically
model both the measurement data and the hidden scene in three dimensions,
overlooking the inherently two-dimensional nature of most hidden objects. This
oversight leads to high computational costs and substantial memory consumption,
limiting practical applications and making real-time, high-resolution NLOS
imaging on lightweight devices challenging. In this paper, we introduce a novel
approach that represents the hidden scene using two-dimensional functions and
employs a Quasi-Fresnel transform to establish a direct inversion formula
between the measurement data and the hidden scene. This transformation
leverages the two-dimensional characteristics of the problem to significantly
reduce computational complexity and memory requirements. Our algorithm
efficiently performs fast transformations between these two-dimensional
aggregated data, enabling rapid reconstruction of hidden objects with minimal
memory usage. Compared to existing methods, our approach reduces runtime and
memory demands by several orders of magnitude while maintaining imaging
quality. The substantial reduction in memory usage not only enhances
computational efficiency but also enables NLOS imaging on lightweight devices
such as mobile and embedded systems. We anticipate that this method will
facilitate real-time, high-resolution NLOS imaging and broaden its
applicability across a wider range of platforms.

Conclusion: 通过冲突无关的引导和Stratified Attention，本文方法显著提升了生成图像对图像提示的忠实度，同时保持了逼真度。

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of
high-quality, diverse images from text prompts, these prompts struggle to
capture intricate details, such as textures, preventing the user intent from
being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images
conditioned on user-provided images, referred to as image prompts. Recent work
modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated
images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt.
This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer,
generally used to incorporate text prompts. In this paper, we identify two
common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention to generate
images that reflect the details of image prompts. First, existing approaches
neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance.
Specifically, current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired
conditions in classifier-free guidance, causing conflicting signals. To resolve
this, we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired
conditions, ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image
prompt. In addition, we observe that the two most common self-attention
modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image
and alignment with the image prompt. Specifically, selecting more keys and
values from the image prompt improves alignment, while selecting more from the
generated image enhances realism. To balance both, we propose an new
self-attention modification method, Stratified Attention to jointly use keys
and values from both images rather than selecting between them. Through
extensive experiments across three image generation tasks, we show that the
proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully
reflecting the image prompt.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了Bench2ADVLM框架，用于在闭环设置中评估基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的自动驾驶系统（ADVLM），填补了现有评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对ADVLM的性能评估主要局限于开环静态输入，缺乏对交互行为和真实安全性的闭环评估。

Method: 通过双系统适应架构将ADVLM适配到仿真环境，设计物理控制抽象层实现仿真与现实的闭环测试，并引入自反思场景生成模块。

Result: 实验表明，现有ADVLM在闭环条件下的性能仍有局限。

Conclusion: Bench2ADVLM为ADVLM提供了全面的闭环评估框架，揭示了其在实际应用中的不足。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
in autonomous driving (AD). However, current performance evaluation protocols
for VLM-based AD systems (ADVLMs) are predominantly confined to open-loop
settings with static inputs, neglecting the more realistic and informative
closed-loop setting that captures interactive behavior, feedback resilience,
and real-world safety. To address this, we introduce Bench2ADVLM, a unified
hierarchical closed-loop evaluation framework for real-time, interactive
assessment of ADVLMs across both simulation and physical platforms. Inspired by
dual-process theories of cognition, we first adapt diverse ADVLMs to simulation
environments via a dual-system adaptation architecture. In this design,
heterogeneous high-level driving commands generated by target ADVLMs (fast
system) are interpreted by a general-purpose VLM (slow system) into
standardized mid-level control actions suitable for execution in simulation. To
bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we design a physical control
abstraction layer that translates these mid-level actions into low-level
actuation signals, enabling, for the first time, closed-loop testing of ADVLMs
on physical vehicles. To enable more comprehensive evaluation, Bench2ADVLM
introduces a self-reflective scenario generation module that automatically
explores model behavior and uncovers potential failure modes for
safety-critical scenario generation. Overall, Bench2ADVLM establishes a
hierarchical evaluation pipeline that seamlessly integrates high-level abstract
reasoning, mid-level simulation actions, and low-level real-world execution.
Experiments on diverse scenarios across multiple state-of-the-art ADVLMs and
physical platforms validate the diagnostic strength of our framework, revealing
that existing ADVLMs still exhibit limited performance under closed-loop
conditions.

*Ziling Wang,Shuya Yang,Jialin Lu,Ka-Ho Chow*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protego是一种用户中心的隐私保护方法，通过3D面部签名动态变形为2D表示，防止面部识别技术滥用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部识别技术（如Clearview AI和PimEyes）滥用导致隐私泄露，用户数字足迹被未经同意地暴露。

Method: Protego将用户的3D面部签名封装为姿态不变的2D表示，并动态变形为自然3D面具，应用于在线分享前。

Result: 实验显示Protego显著降低检索准确率，性能优于现有方法至少2倍，且视觉一致性高。

Conclusion: Protego有效对抗面部识别技术的滥用，保护用户隐私。

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) technologies are increasingly used to power large-scale
image retrieval systems, raising serious privacy concerns. Services like
Clearview AI and PimEyes allow anyone to upload a facial photo and retrieve a
large amount of online content associated with that person. This not only
enables identity inference but also exposes their digital footprint, such as
social media activity, private photos, and news reports, often without their
consent. In response to this emerging threat, we propose Protego, a
user-centric privacy protection method that safeguards facial images from such
retrieval-based privacy intrusions. Protego encapsulates a user's 3D facial
signatures into a pose-invariant 2D representation, which is dynamically
deformed into a natural-looking 3D mask tailored to the pose and expression of
any facial image of the user, and applied prior to online sharing. Motivated by
a critical limitation of existing methods, Protego amplifies the sensitivity of
FR models so that protected images cannot be matched even among themselves.
Experiments show that Protego significantly reduces retrieval accuracy across a
wide range of black-box FR models and performs at least 2x better than existing
methods. It also offers unprecedented visual coherence, particularly in video
settings where consistency and natural appearance are essential. Overall,
Protego contributes to the fight against the misuse of FR for mass surveillance
and unsolicited identity tracing.

TL;DR: ADDiff-Dose是一种基于条件扩散模型的放疗剂量预测方法，通过多模态输入和复合损失函数显著提升了预测精度和临床适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度学习方法在泛化性、预测精度和临床适用性上的不足，减少放疗计划制定的时间和专家依赖。

Method: 采用LightweightVAE3D压缩CT数据，结合多模态输入和条件扩散模型，使用多注意力机制和复合损失函数。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，MAE为0.101-0.154，DICE系数0.927，计划生成时间降至22秒。

Conclusion: ADDiff-Dose为放疗剂量预测提供了高效、通用的解决方案，显著提升了临床工作效率。

Abstract: Radiotherapy treatment planning often relies on time-consuming,
trial-and-error adjustments that heavily depend on the expertise of
specialists, while existing deep learning methods face limitations in
generalization, prediction accuracy, and clinical applicability. To tackle
these challenges, we propose ADDiff-Dose, an Anatomical-Dose Dual Constraints
Conditional Diffusion Model for end-to-end multi-tumor dose prediction. The
model employs LightweightVAE3D to compress high-dimensional CT data and
integrates multimodal inputs, including target and organ-at-risk (OAR) masks
and beam parameters, within a progressive noise addition and denoising
framework. It incorporates conditional features via a multi-head attention
mechanism and utilizes a composite loss function combining MSE, conditional
terms, and KL divergence to ensure both dosimetric accuracy and compliance with
clinical constraints. Evaluation on a large-scale public dataset (2,877 cases)
and three external institutional cohorts (450 cases in total) demonstrates that
ADDiff-Dose significantly outperforms traditional baselines, achieving an MAE
of 0.101-0.154 (compared to 0.316 for UNet and 0.169 for GAN models), a DICE
coefficient of 0.927 (a 6.8% improvement), and limiting spinal cord maximum
dose error to within 0.1 Gy. The average plan generation time per case is
reduced to 22 seconds. Ablation studies confirm that the structural encoder
enhances compliance with clinical dose constraints by 28.5%. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to introduce a conditional diffusion model framework
for radiotherapy dose prediction, offering a generalizable and efficient
solution for automated treatment planning across diverse tumor sites, with the
potential to substantially reduce planning time and improve clinical workflow
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集（如Mapillary）的标注粒度较粗，无法区分语义重要的交通标志类型，影响自动驾驶的准确性。

Method: 从Mapillary数据集中提取并手动标注了细粒度的交通标志数据集MVV，包含像素级实例掩码，并对比了多种视觉语言模型与DINOv2的性能。

Result: DINOv2在交通标志识别及其他类别（如车辆和行人）上均优于其他视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: MVV数据集和DINOv2模型为自动驾驶提供了更可靠、可解释的感知系统基础。

Abstract: Obtaining high-quality fine-grained annotations for traffic signs is critical
for accurate and safe decision-making in autonomous driving. Widely used
datasets, such as Mapillary, often provide only coarse-grained labels - without
distinguishing semantically important types such as stop signs or speed limit
signs. To this end, we present a new validation set for traffic signs derived
from the Mapillary dataset called Mapillary Vistas Validation for Traffic Signs
(MVV), where we decompose composite traffic signs into granular, semantically
meaningful categories. The dataset includes pixel-level instance masks and has
been manually annotated by expert annotators to ensure label fidelity. Further,
we benchmark several state-of-the-art VLMs against the self-supervised DINOv2
model on this dataset and show that DINOv2 consistently outperforms all VLM
baselines-not only on traffic sign recognition, but also on heavily represented
categories like vehicles and humans. Our analysis reveals significant
limitations in current vision-language models for fine-grained visual
understanding and establishes DINOv2 as a strong baseline for dense semantic
matching in autonomous driving scenarios. This dataset and evaluation framework
pave the way for more reliable, interpretable, and scalable perception systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为HCF的分层级联框架，用于分布式多阶段图像压缩，通过潜在空间转换优化计算效率和率失真性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在分布式多阶段图像压缩中的不足，如渐进式方法未充分利用计算资源，连续压缩导致累积质量损失和效率低下，以及固定参数模型缺乏灵活性。

Method: 开发了HCF框架，通过潜在空间转换实现高效压缩，引入策略驱动的量化控制和边缘量化原则。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，PSNR增益最高达0.6dB，BD-Rate提升最高12.64%，计算资源节省显著（如97.8% FLOPs）。

Conclusion: HCF在分布式多阶段图像压缩中实现了高效性和灵活性，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Distributed multi-stage image compression -- where visual content traverses
multiple processing nodes under varying quality requirements -- poses
challenges. Progressive methods enable bitstream truncation but underutilize
available compute resources; successive compression repeats costly pixel-domain
operations and suffers cumulative quality loss and inefficiency;
fixed-parameter models lack post-encoding flexibility. In this work, we
developed the Hierarchical Cascade Framework (HCF) that achieves high
rate-distortion performance and better computational efficiency through direct
latent-space transformations across network nodes in distributed multi-stage
image compression system. Under HCF, we introduced policy-driven quantization
control to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs, and established the edge
quantization principle through differential entropy analysis. The configuration
based on this principle demonstrates up to 0.6dB PSNR gains over other
configurations. When comprehensively evaluated on the Kodak, CLIC, and
CLIC2020-mobile datasets, HCF outperforms successive-compression methods by up
to 5.56% BD-Rate in PSNR on CLIC, while saving up to 97.8% FLOPs, 96.5% GPU
memory, and 90.0% execution time. It also outperforms state-of-the-art
progressive compression methods by up to 12.64% BD-Rate on Kodak and enables
retraining-free cross-quality adaptation with 7.13-10.87% BD-Rate reductions on
CLIC2020-mobile.

Motivation: 传统方法在单目3D人体姿态估计中存在深度模糊和遮挡问题，而现有扩散方法忽视了时空相关性，导致时间一致性差和精度不足。

Method: StarPose将2D到3D姿态映射建模为自回归扩散过程，通过历史姿态集成模块（HPIM）和时空物理引导（STPG）机制，优化去噪过程。

Result: 在基准数据集上，StarPose优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和时间一致性。

Conclusion: StarPose通过自回归扩散框架和时空引导机制，显著提升了3D姿态估计的性能，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a challenging task due to inherent
depth ambiguities and occlusions. Compared to traditional methods based on
Transformers or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recent diffusion-based
approaches have shown superior performance, leveraging their probabilistic
nature and high-fidelity generation capabilities. However, these methods often
fail to account for the spatial and temporal correlations across predicted
frames, resulting in limited temporal consistency and inferior accuracy in
predicted 3D pose sequences. To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes
StarPose, an autoregressive diffusion framework that effectively incorporates
historical 3D pose predictions and spatial-temporal physical guidance to
significantly enhance both the accuracy and temporal coherence of pose
predictions. Unlike existing approaches, StarPose models the 2D-to-3D pose
mapping as an autoregressive diffusion process. By synergically integrating
previously predicted 3D poses with 2D pose inputs via a Historical Pose
Integration Module (HPIM), the framework generates rich and informative
historical pose embeddings that guide subsequent denoising steps, ensuring
temporally consistent predictions. In addition, a fully plug-and-play
Spatial-Temporal Physical Guidance (STPG) mechanism is tailored to refine the
denoising process in an iterative manner, which further enforces spatial
anatomical plausibility and temporal motion dynamics, rendering robust and
realistic pose estimates. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that StarPose outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving
superior accuracy and temporal consistency in 3D human pose estimation. Code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化放射学报告生成（S-RRG）新方法，包括数据集构建、模型训练和新评估框架，以解决传统报告冗余和不一致的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统自由文本报告存在冗余和语言不一致问题，结构化报告能提供标准化信息，但现有方法依赖预定义标签或模板，限制了表达能力和临床细节。

Method: 构建MIMIC-STRUC数据集，训练基于LLM的模型生成标准化报告，并提出S-Score评估指标。

Result: 新方法生成高质量结构化报告，S-Score评估指标更符合临床需求和人类评估。

Conclusion: 结构化报告和定制化评估指标提升了放射学报告生成的临床相关性。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) for diagnostic images, such as chest
X-rays, plays a pivotal role in both clinical practice and AI. Traditional
free-text reports suffer from redundancy and inconsistent language,
complicating the extraction of critical clinical details. Structured radiology
report generation (S-RRG) offers a promising solution by organizing information
into standardized, concise formats. However, existing approaches often rely on
classification or visual question answering (VQA) pipelines that require
predefined label sets and produce only fragmented outputs. Template-based
approaches, which generate reports by replacing keywords within fixed sentence
patterns, further compromise expressiveness and often omit clinically important
details. In this work, we present a novel approach to S-RRG that includes
dataset construction, model training, and the introduction of a new evaluation
framework. We first create a robust chest X-ray dataset (MIMIC-STRUC) that
includes disease names, severity levels, probabilities, and anatomical
locations, ensuring that the dataset is both clinically relevant and
well-structured. We train an LLM-based model to generate standardized,
high-quality reports. To assess the generated reports, we propose a specialized
evaluation metric (S-Score) that not only measures disease prediction accuracy
but also evaluates the precision of disease-specific details, thus offering a
clinically meaningful metric for report quality that focuses on elements
critical to clinical decision-making and demonstrates a stronger alignment with
human assessments. Our approach highlights the effectiveness of structured
reports and the importance of a tailored evaluation metric for S-RRG, providing
a more clinically relevant measure of report quality.

Motivation: 当前VLMs在动态时空交互理解上存在明显缺陷，而人类能轻松处理物体运动、旋转和视角变化。

Method: 设计了包含真实和合成视频的VLM4D基准测试，通过精心设计的问题对评估VLMs的时空推理能力。

Result: 评估发现VLMs在整合多视觉线索和保持时间连贯性上表现不佳，与人类基线差距显著。

Conclusion: 通过4D特征场重建和针对性监督微调等方法有望提升VLMs的时空理解能力，推动动态环境下的视觉智能发展。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in
integrating linguistic and visual reasoning but remain fundamentally limited in
understanding dynamic spatiotemporal interactions. Humans effortlessly track
and reason about object movements, rotations, and perspective shifts-abilities
essential for robust dynamic real-world understanding yet notably lacking in
current VLMs. In this paper, we introduce VLM4D, the first benchmark
specifically designed to evaluate the spatiotemporal reasoning capabilities of
VLMs. Our benchmark comprises diverse real-world and synthetic videos
accompanied by carefully curated question-answer pairs emphasizing
translational and rotational motions, perspective awareness, and motion
continuity. Through comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art open and
closed-source VLMs, we identify significant performance gaps compared to human
baselines, highlighting fundamental deficiencies in existing models. Extensive
analysis reveals that VLMs struggle particularly with integrating multiple
visual cues and maintaining temporal coherence. We further explore promising
directions, such as leveraging 4D feature field reconstruction and targeted
spatiotemporal supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating their effectiveness in
enhancing spatiotemporal comprehension. Our work aims to encourage deeper
exploration into improving VLMs' spatial and temporal grounding, paving the way
towards more capable and reliable visual intelligence for dynamic environments.

Abstract: Real-time synthesis of physically plausible human interactions remains a
critical challenge for immersive VR/AR systems and humanoid robotics. While
existing methods demonstrate progress in kinematic motion generation, they
often fail to address the fundamental tension between real-time responsiveness,
physical feasibility, and safety requirements in dynamic human-machine
interactions. We introduce Human-X, a novel framework designed to enable
immersive and physically plausible human interactions across diverse entities,
including human-avatar, human-humanoid, and human-robot systems. Unlike
existing approaches that focus on post-hoc alignment or simplified physics, our
method jointly predicts actions and reactions in real-time using an
auto-regressive reaction diffusion planner, ensuring seamless synchronization
and context-aware responses. To enhance physical realism and safety, we
integrate an actor-aware motion tracking policy trained with reinforcement
learning, which dynamically adapts to interaction partners' movements while
avoiding artifacts like foot sliding and penetration. Extensive experiments on
the Inter-X and InterHuman datasets demonstrate significant improvements in
motion quality, interaction continuity, and physical plausibility over
state-of-the-art methods. Our framework is validated in real-world
applications, including virtual reality interface for human-robot interaction,
showcasing its potential for advancing human-robot collaboration.

Motivation: 尽管FLUX和Stable Diffusion v3等大规模模型在逼真图像生成方面取得了进展，但其实际部署仍受限于参数微调的困难。LoRA虽能高效定制模型，但分布式LoRA模块的应用面临元数据稀疏、零样本适应和多LoRA融合的挑战。

Result: 该方法显著提升了图像生成性能，支持基础模型的高效增强。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了社区开发LoRA与实际部署需求之间的鸿沟，通过标准化适配器集成推动了协作式模型演进。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in photorealistic image generation through
large-scale models like FLUX and Stable Diffusion v3, the practical deployment
of these architectures remains constrained by their inherent intractability to
parameter fine-tuning. While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) have demonstrated
efficacy in enabling model customization with minimal parameter overhead, the
effective utilization of distributed open-source LoRA modules faces three
critical challenges: sparse metadata annotation, the requirement for zero-shot
adaptation capabilities, and suboptimal fusion strategies for multi-LoRA fusion
strategies. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework that
enables semantic-driven LoRA retrieval and dynamic aggregation through two key
components: (1) weight encoding-base LoRA retriever that establishes a shared
semantic space between LoRA parameter matrices and text prompts, eliminating
dependence on original training data, and (2) fine-grained gated fusion
mechanism that computes context-specific fusion weights across network layers
and diffusion timesteps to optimally integrate multiple LoRA modules during
generation. Our approach achieves significant improvement in image generation
perfermance, thereby facilitating scalable and data-efficient enhancement of
foundational models. This work establishes a critical bridge between the
fragmented landscape of community-developed LoRAs and practical deployment
requirements, enabling collaborative model evolution through standardized
adapter integration.

Motivation: 镜头光晕去除因光与镜头复杂交互导致信息混淆，现有方法难以保持上下文一致性，导致去除不完整或不一致。

Method: 提出DeflareMamba，采用分层框架和局部增强状态空间模型，通过变步长采样建立长程像素关联，同时保留局部细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效去除多种光晕（如散射和反射光晕），并保持非光晕区域的自然外观。

Conclusion: DeflareMamba首次将状态空间模型引入光晕去除任务，下游应用显示其能提升视觉目标识别和跨模态语义理解。

Abstract: Lens flare removal remains an information confusion challenge in the
underlying image background and the optical flares, due to the complex optical
interactions between light sources and camera lens. While recent solutions have
shown promise in decoupling the flare corruption from image, they often fail to
maintain contextual consistency, leading to incomplete and inconsistent flare
removal. To eliminate this limitation, we propose DeflareMamba, which leverages
the efficient sequence modeling capabilities of state space models while
maintains the ability to capture local-global dependencies. Particularly, we
design a hierarchical framework that establishes long-range pixel correlations
through varied stride sampling patterns, and utilize local-enhanced state space
models that simultaneously preserves local details. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that introduces state space models to the
flare removal task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively removes various types of flare artifacts, including scattering and
reflective flares, while maintaining the natural appearance of non-flare
regions. Further downstream applications demonstrate the capacity of our method
to improve visual object recognition and cross-modal semantic understanding.

Abstract: Accurate object detection under adverse lighting conditions is critical for
real-world applications such as autonomous driving. Although neuromorphic event
cameras have been introduced to handle these scenarios, adverse lighting often
induces distracting reflections from tunnel walls or road surfaces, which
frequently lead to false obstacle detections. However, neither RGB nor event
data alone is robust enough to address these complexities, and mitigating these
issues without additional sensors remains underexplored. To overcome these
challenges, we propose leveraging normal maps, directly predicted from
monocular RGB images, as robust geometric cues to suppress false positives and
enhance detection accuracy. We introduce NRE-Net, a novel multi-modal detection
framework that effectively fuses three complementary modalities: monocularly
predicted surface normal maps, RGB images, and event streams. To optimize the
fusion process, our framework incorporates two key modules: the Adaptive
Dual-stream Fusion Module (ADFM), which integrates RGB and normal map features,
and the Event-modality Aware Fusion Module (EAFM), which adapts to the high
dynamic range characteristics of event data. Extensive evaluations on the
DSEC-Det-sub and PKU-DAVIS-SOD datasets demonstrate that NRE-Net significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves mAP50 improvements
of 7.9% and 6.1% over frame-based approaches (e.g., YOLOX), while surpassing
the fusion-based SFNet by 2.7% on the DSEC-Det-sub dataset and SODFormer by
7.1% on the PKU-DAVIS-SOD dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖预校准对象轨迹或难以从欠采样捕获中准确建模快速运动物体，尤其是处理时间不连续性时存在挑战。

Method: 结合视频扩散模型提取时间一致先验，引入联合时间戳优化策略和不确定性蒸馏方法。

Result: 显著提升动态建模效果，尤其是快速运动物体，新视角合成的PSNR增益约2 dB。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了动态场景建模中的关键问题，性能优于基线方法。

Abstract: Dynamic urban scene modeling is a rapidly evolving area with broad
applications. While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or
Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity
novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem
from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately
modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to
challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we
propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our
key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time
adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective
integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a
joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses,
and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content
while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for
fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view
synthesis over baseline approaches.

*Behnaz Kavoosighafi,Rafal K. Mantiuk,Saghi Hajisharif,Ehsan Miandji,Jonas Unger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于感知的神经质量度量方法，用于直接评估BRDF模型的质量，无需渲染过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BRDF空间度量方法无法捕捉渲染图像中的感知差异，因此需要一种更符合人类感知的评估方法。

Method: 使用多层感知机（MLP）构建神经网络，输入参考和近似BRDF样本，预测其感知质量（JOD分数）。训练数据包括实测和合成BRDF数据，标注基于感知验证的图像空间度量。

Result: 该神经度量与人类判断的相关性显著高于现有BRDF空间度量方法。

Conclusion: 该度量方法为BRDF模型评估提供了基于感知的替代方案，但在BRDF拟合中作为损失函数的性能有限。

Abstract: Accurately evaluating the quality of bidirectional reflectance distribution
function (BRDF) models is essential for photo-realistic rendering. Traditional
BRDF-space metrics often employ numerical error measures that fail to capture
perceptual differences evident in rendered images. In this paper, we introduce
the first perceptually informed neural quality metric for BRDF evaluation that
operates directly in BRDF space, eliminating the need for rendering during
quality assessment. Our metric is implemented as a compact multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), trained on a dataset of measured BRDFs supplemented with
synthetically generated data and labelled using a perceptually validated
image-space metric. The network takes as input paired samples of reference and
approximated BRDFs and predicts their perceptual quality in terms of
just-objectionable-difference (JOD) scores. We show that our neural metric
achieves significantly higher correlation with human judgments than existing
BRDF-space metrics. While its performance as a loss function for BRDF fitting
remains limited, the proposed metric offers a perceptually grounded alternative
for evaluating BRDF models.

TL;DR: Free-MoRef是一种无需训练的方法，通过多参考注意力机制和并行分块处理，提升视频多模态大语言模型在长视频场景下的性能与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态大语言模型在长视频场景中因上下文长度限制表现不佳，传统方法牺牲特征粒度或推理效率。

Method: Free-MoRef将视觉令牌重构为多个短序列作为多参考，引入MoRef-attention并行收集线索，并通过参考融合步骤生成最终推理序列。

Result: 实验表明，Free-MoRef在单A100 GPU上支持2×至8×更长输入帧，性能显著提升，超越专门训练的长视频模型。

Conclusion: Free-MoRef通过分块与融合策略，高效提升长视频理解能力，兼具高效与性能优势。

Abstract: Video Multimodal Large Language Models~(Video-MLLM) have achieved remarkable
advancements in video understanding tasks. However, constrained by the context
length limitation in the underlying LLMs, existing Video-MLLMs typically
exhibit suboptimal performance on long video scenarios. To understand extended
input frames, common solutions span token compression and streaming inference
techniques, which sacrifice feature granularity or inference efficiency.
Differently, to efficiently achieve comprehensive understanding of longer frame
inputs, we draw ideas from MoE and propose a training-free approach
\textbf{Free-MoRef}, which instantly multiplexes the context perception
capabilities of Video-MLLMs within one inference pass. Specifically, Free-MoRef
reconstructs the vision tokens into several short sequences as
multi-references. Subsequently, we introduce MoRef-attention, which gathers
clues from the multi-reference chunks in parallel to summarize unified query
activations. After the shadow layers in LLMs, a reference fusion step is
derived to compose a final mixed reasoning sequence with key tokens from
parallel chunks, which compensates the cross-reference vision interactions that
are neglected in MoRef-attention. By splitting and fusing the long vision token
sequences, Free-MoRef achieves improved performance under much lower computing
costs in reasoning multiplexed context length, demonstrating strong efficiency
and effectiveness. Experiments on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench show that
Free-MoRef achieves full perception of 2$\times$ to 8$\times$ longer input
frames without compression on a single A100 GPU while keeping instant
responses, thereby bringing significant performance gains, even surpassing
dedicatedly trained long-video-MLLMs. Codes are available at

Motivation: 研究如何利用航拍图像为自动驾驶车辆提供环境上下文，尤其是在高清地图不可用或维护成本高的情况下。

Method: 通过SLAM点云地图将航拍图像与nuScenes坐标系对齐，提出对齐工作流程并进行质量控制，生成高质量对齐数据集。

Result: 航拍图像在地图构建中提升15-23%的准确性，在轨迹预测中提升2%的性能。

Conclusion: 航拍图像是自动驾驶系统中可扩展且适应性强的环境上下文来源，AID4AD数据集的发布将推动相关研究。

Abstract: This work investigates the integration of spatially aligned aerial imagery
into perception tasks for automated vehicles (AVs). As a central contribution,
we present AID4AD, a publicly available dataset that augments the nuScenes
dataset with high-resolution aerial imagery precisely aligned to its local
coordinate system. The alignment is performed using SLAM-based point cloud maps
provided by nuScenes, establishing a direct link between aerial data and
nuScenes local coordinate system. To ensure spatial fidelity, we propose an
alignment workflow that corrects for localization and projection distortions. A
manual quality control process further refines the dataset by identifying a set
of high-quality alignments, which we publish as ground truth to support future
research on automated registration. We demonstrate the practical value of
AID4AD in two representative tasks: in online map construction, aerial imagery
serves as a complementary input that improves the mapping process; in motion
prediction, it functions as a structured environmental representation that
replaces high-definition maps. Experiments show that aerial imagery leads to a
15-23% improvement in map construction accuracy and a 2% gain in trajectory
prediction performance. These results highlight the potential of aerial imagery
as a scalable and adaptable source of environmental context in automated
vehicle systems, particularly in scenarios where high-definition maps are
unavailable, outdated, or costly to maintain. AID4AD, along with evaluation
code and pretrained models, is publicly released to foster further research in
this direction: https://github.com/DriverlessMobility/AID4AD.

Result: 在Gait3D和GREW数据集上分别达到77.8和80.4的rank-1准确率，仅使用10.3M参数。

Conclusion: TrackletGait在现实场景中表现出色，为步态识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Gait recognition aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and
walking patterns. Though much progress has been achieved driven by deep
learning, gait recognition in real-world surveillance scenarios remains quite
challenging to current methods. Conventional approaches, which rely on periodic
gait cycles and controlled environments, struggle with the non-periodic and
occluded silhouette sequences encountered in the wild. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, TrackletGait, designed to address these challenges
in the wild. We propose Random Tracklet Sampling, a generalization of existing
sampling methods, which strikes a balance between robustness and representation
in capturing diverse walking patterns. Next, we introduce Haar Wavelet-based
Downsampling to preserve information during spatial downsampling. Finally, we
present a Hardness Exclusion Triplet Loss, designed to exclude low-quality
silhouettes by discarding hard triplet samples. TrackletGait achieves
state-of-the-art results, with 77.8 and 80.4 rank-1 accuracy on the Gait3D and
GREW datasets, respectively, while using only 10.3M backbone parameters.
Extensive experiments are also conducted to further investigate the factors
affecting gait recognition in the wild.

TL;DR: AURORA框架通过结构化思维链提示和特征蒸馏损失提升参考音频-视觉分割任务的语义理解和分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏真正的语义理解，且联合训练推理和分割会降低像素级精度。

Method: 采用思维链提示机制和特征蒸馏损失，分两阶段训练：自校正和强化学习。

Result: AURORA在Ref-AVS基准测试中达到最优性能，并能泛化到未参考分割任务。

Conclusion: AURORA通过增强推理能力和语言理解，显著提升了参考音频-视觉分割的性能。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) tasks challenge models to
precisely locate sounding objects by integrating visual, auditory, and textual
cues. Existing methods often lack genuine semantic understanding, tending to
memorize fixed reasoning patterns. Furthermore, jointly training for reasoning
and segmentation can compromise pixel-level precision. To address these issues,
we introduce AURORA, a novel framework designed to enhance genuine reasoning
and language comprehension in reference audio-visual segmentation. We employ a
structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting mechanism to guide the model
through a step-by-step reasoning process and introduce a novel segmentation
feature distillation loss to effectively integrate these reasoning abilities
without sacrificing segmentation performance. To further cultivate the model's
genuine reasoning capabilities, we devise a further two-stage training
strategy: first, a ``corrective reflective-style training" stage utilizes
self-correction to enhance the quality of reasoning paths, followed by
reinforcement learning via Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to bolster
robustness in challenging scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that AURORA
achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ref-AVS benchmarks and generalizes
effectively to unreferenced segmentation.

TL;DR: AttriCtrl是一个即插即用的框架，用于精确连续控制生成图像的美学属性，解决了现有方法依赖模糊文本提示或昂贵人工数据的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在美学属性的细粒度控制上存在挑战，尤其是需要连续和强度调整时，现有方法依赖模糊文本或人工数据，缺乏可扩展性和实用性。

Method: 通过预训练的视觉语言模型量化抽象美学，并使用轻量级值编码器将标量强度映射到可学习嵌入中，实现美学属性的精确控制。

Result: 实验表明，AttriCtrl能准确控制单个属性并灵活组合多属性，且与现有生成框架兼容。

Conclusion: AttriCtrl提供了一种直观、可定制且高效的美学属性控制方法，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
enhanced both the visual fidelity and semantic controllability of generated
images. However, fine-grained control over aesthetic attributes remains
challenging, especially when users require continuous and intensity-specific
adjustments. Existing approaches often rely on vague textual prompts, which are
inherently ambiguous in expressing both the aesthetic semantics and the desired
intensity, or depend on costly human preference data for alignment, limiting
their scalability and practicality. To address these limitations, we propose
AttriCtrl, a plug-and-play framework for precise and continuous control of
aesthetic attributes. Specifically, we quantify abstract aesthetics by
leveraging semantic similarity from pre-trained vision-language models, and
employ a lightweight value encoder that maps scalar intensities in $[0,1]$ to
learnable embeddings within diffusion-based generation. This design enables
intuitive and customizable aesthetic manipulation, with minimal training
overhead and seamless integration into existing generation pipelines. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that AttriCtrl achieves accurate control over
individual attributes as well as flexible multi-attribute composition.
Moreover, it is fully compatible with popular open-source controllable
generation frameworks, showcasing strong integration capability and practical
utility across diverse generation scenarios.

Result: 在无噪声图像上表现与ADMM方法相当，在高斯噪声污染图像上去噪效果更优。

Conclusion: CP框架是一种高效且无需参数选择的替代方案，适用于图像处理中的稀疏表示问题。

Abstract: Recently convolutional sparse representation (CSR), as a sparse
representation technique, has attracted increasing attention in the field of
image processing, due to its good characteristic of translate-invariance. The
content of CSR usually consists of convolutional sparse coding (CSC) and
convolutional dictionary learning (CDL), and many studies focus on how to solve
the corresponding optimization problems. At present, the most efficient
optimization scheme for CSC is based on the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). However, the ADMM-based approach involves a penalty
parameter that needs to be carefully selected, and improper parameter selection
may result in either no convergence or very slow convergence. In this paper, a
novel fast and efficient method using Chambolle-Pock(CP) framework is proposed,
which does not require extra manual selection parameters in solving processing,
and has faster convergence speed. Furthermore, we propose an anisotropic total
variation penalty of the coefficient maps for CSC and apply the CP algorithm to
solve it. In addition, we also apply the CP framework to solve the
corresponding CDL problem. Experiments show that for noise-free image the
proposed CSC algorithms can achieve rival results of the latest ADMM-based
approach, while outperforms in removing noise from Gaussian noise pollution
image.

Conclusion: DreamPainter为电商背景生成提供了高效解决方案，结合文本与视觉信息实现精准控制。

Abstract: Although diffusion-based image genenation has been widely explored and
applied, background generation tasks in e-commerce scenarios still face
significant challenges. The first challenge is to ensure that the generated
products are consistent with the given product inputs while maintaining a
reasonable spatial arrangement, harmonious shadows, and reflections between
foreground products and backgrounds. Existing inpainting methods fail to
address this due to the lack of domain-specific data. The second challenge
involves the limitation of relying solely on text prompts for image control, as
effective integrating visual information to achieve precise control in
inpainting tasks remains underexplored. To address these challenges, we
introduce DreamEcom-400K, a high-quality e-commerce dataset containing accurate
product instance masks, background reference images, text prompts, and
aesthetically pleasing product images. Based on this dataset, we propose
DreamPainter, a novel framework that not only utilizes text prompts for control
but also flexibly incorporates reference image information as an additional
control signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, maintaining high product
consistency while effectively integrating both text prompt and reference image
information.

Conclusion: 统一模型在RGB图像上实现了高效的检测与姿态估计，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recognizing objects in images is a fundamental problem in computer vision.
Although detecting objects in 2D images is common, many applications require
determining their pose in 3D space. Traditional category-level methods rely on
RGB-D inputs, which may not always be available, or employ two-stage approaches
that use separate models and representations for detection and pose estimation.
For the first time, we introduce a unified model that integrates detection and
pose estimation into a single framework for RGB images by leveraging neural
mesh models with learned features and multi-model RANSAC. Our approach achieves
state-of-the-art results for RGB category-level pose estimation on REAL275,
improving on the current state-of-the-art by 22.9% averaged across all
scale-agnostic metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our unified method
exhibits greater robustness compared to single-stage baselines. Our code and
models are available at

Method: 提出一种基于Retinex模型的学习框架，利用显式色度和亮度组件指导，精确分离光照与反射。

Conclusion: CL3AN数据集和提出的框架有效解决了复杂光照下的图像恢复问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Illumination in practical scenarios is inherently complex, involving colored
light sources, occlusions, and diverse material interactions that produce
intricate reflectance and shading effects. However, existing methods often
oversimplify this challenge by assuming a single light source or uniform,
white-balanced lighting, leaving many of these complexities unaddressed.In this
paper, we introduce CL3AN, the first large-scale, high-resolution dataset of
its kind designed to facilitate the restoration of images captured under
multiple Colored Light sources to their Ambient-Normalized counterparts.
Through benchmarking, we find that leading approaches often produce artifacts,
such as illumination inconsistencies, texture leakage, and color distortion,
primarily due to their limited ability to precisely disentangle illumination
from reflectance. Motivated by this insight, we achieve such a desired
decomposition through a novel learning framework that leverages explicit
chromaticity and luminance components guidance, drawing inspiration from the
principles of the Retinex model. Extensive evaluations on existing benchmarks
and our dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showcasing
enhanced robustness under non-homogeneous color lighting and material-specific
reflectance variations, all while maintaining a highly competitive
computational cost. The benchmark, codes, and models are available at

Conclusion: GaussianCross在3D场景理解中表现出强大的泛化能力和性能提升，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The significance of informative and robust point representations has been
widely acknowledged for 3D scene understanding. Despite existing
self-supervised pre-training counterparts demonstrating promising performance,
the model collapse and structural information deficiency remain prevalent due
to insufficient point discrimination difficulty, yielding unreliable
expressions and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we present
GaussianCross, a novel cross-modal self-supervised 3D representation learning
architecture integrating feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques
to address current challenges. GaussianCross seamlessly converts
scale-inconsistent 3D point clouds into a unified cuboid-normalized Gaussian
representation without missing details, enabling stable and generalizable
pre-training. Subsequently, a tri-attribute adaptive distillation splatting
module is incorporated to construct a 3D feature field, facilitating synergetic
feature capturing of appearance, geometry, and semantic cues to maintain
cross-modal consistency. To validate GaussianCross, we perform extensive
evaluations on various benchmarks, including ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS. In
particular, GaussianCross shows a prominent parameter and data efficiency,
achieving superior performance through linear probing (<0.1% parameters) and
limited data training (1% of scenes) compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Furthermore, GaussianCross demonstrates strong generalization capabilities,
improving the full fine-tuning accuracy by 9.3% mIoU and 6.1% AP$_{50}$ on
ScanNet200 semantic and instance segmentation tasks, respectively, supporting
the effectiveness of our approach. The code, weights, and visualizations are

Abstract: Background : De-identification of DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communi-cations
in Medicine) files is an essential component of medical image research.
Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Personal Health Identifying
Information (PHI) need to be hidden or removed due to legal reasons. According
to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and privacy
rules, also full-face photographic images and any compa-rable images are direct
identifiers and are considered protected health information that also need to
be de-identified. Objective : The study aimed to implement a method that permit
to de-identify the PII and PHI information present in the header and burned on
the pixel data of DICOM. Methods : To execute the de-identification, we
implemented an algorithm based on the safe harbor method, defined by HIPAA. Our
algorithm uses input customizable parameter to classify and then possibly
de-identify individual DICOM tags. Results : The most sensible information,
like names, history, personal data and institution were successfully
recognized. Conclusions : We developed a python algorithm that is able to
classify infor-mation present in a DICOM file. The flexibility provided by the
use of customi-zable input parameters, which allow the user to customize the
entire process de-pending on the case (e.g., the language), makes the entire
program very promis-ing for both everyday use and research purposes. Our code

Abstract: The spread of Deepfake videos has caused a trust crisis and impaired social
stability. Although numerous approaches have been proposed to address the
challenges of Deepfake detection and localization, there is still a lack of
systematic research on the weakly supervised multimodal fine-grained temporal
forgery localization (WS-MTFL). In this paper, we propose a novel weakly
supervised multimodal temporal forgery localization via multitask learning
(WMMT), which addresses the WS-MTFL under the multitask learning paradigm. WMMT
achieves multimodal fine-grained Deepfake detection and temporal partial
forgery localization using merely video-level annotations. Specifically, visual
and audio modality detection are formulated as two binary classification tasks.
The multitask learning paradigm is introduced to integrate these tasks into a
multimodal task. Furthermore, WMMT utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts structure to
adaptively select appropriate features and localization head, achieving
excellent flexibility and localization precision in WS-MTFL. A feature
enhancement module with temporal property preserving attention mechanism is
proposed to identify the intra- and inter-modality feature deviation and
construct comprehensive video features. To further explore the temporal
information for weakly supervised learning, an extensible deviation perceiving
loss has been proposed, which aims to enlarge the deviation of adjacent
segments of the forged samples and reduce the deviation of genuine samples.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of multitask learning for
WS-MTFL, and the WMMT achieves comparable results to fully supervised
approaches in several evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化模型在动态环境中性能下降严重，现有测试时适应（TTA）方法因依赖梯度回传而不适用于量化模型。

Method: 提出ZOA框架，仅需两次前向传播，无需梯度回传；引入领域知识管理方案存储和复用不同领域知识。

Result: 在量化W6A6 ViT-B模型上，ZOA在ImageNet-C数据集上比现有方法提升5.0%。

Conclusion: ZOA框架高效提升了量化模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，适用于长期适应场景。

Abstract: Quantizing deep models prior to deployment is a widely adopted technique to
speed up inference for various real-time applications, such as autonomous
driving. However, quantized models often suffer from severe performance
degradation in dynamic environments with potential domain shifts and this
degradation is significantly more pronounced compared with their full-precision
counterparts, as shown by our theoretical and empirical illustrations. To
address the domain shift problem, test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an
effective solution by enabling models to learn adaptively from test data.
Unfortunately, existing TTA methods are often impractical for quantized models
as they typically rely on gradient backpropagation--an operation that is
unsupported on quantized models due to vanishing gradients, as well as memory
and latency constraints. In this paper, we focus on TTA for quantized models to
improve their robustness and generalization ability efficiently. We propose a
continual zeroth-order adaptation (ZOA) framework that enables efficient model
adaptation using only two forward passes, eliminating the computational burden
of existing methods. Moreover, we propose a domain knowledge management scheme
to store and reuse different domain knowledge with negligible memory
consumption, reducing the interference of different domain knowledge and
fostering the knowledge accumulation during long-term adaptation. Experimental
results on three classical architectures, including quantized transformer-based
and CNN-based models, demonstrate the superiority of our methods for quantized
model adaptation. On the quantized W6A6 ViT-B model, our ZOA is able to achieve
a 5.0\% improvement over the state-of-the-art FOA on ImageNet-C dataset. The

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的对抗训练方法RPAT，通过优化感知一致性来缓解干净准确性和对抗鲁棒性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗训练（AT）在提升模型鲁棒性的同时会导致干净准确率下降，作者发现这是由于对难对抗样本的过度学习导致的。

Method: 提出了Robust Perception目标，鼓励模型感知随输入扰动平滑变化，并基于此设计了RPAT方法。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和Tiny-ImageNet等数据集上，RPAT超越了4种常见基线和12种SOTA方法。

Conclusion: RPAT通过优化感知一致性，有效缓解了准确性和鲁棒性的权衡问题，为对抗训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adversarial Training (AT) is one of the most effective methods to train
robust Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). However, AT creates an inherent trade-off
between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness, which is commonly attributed
to the more complicated decision boundary caused by the insufficient learning
of hard adversarial samples. In this work, we reveal a counterintuitive fact
for the first time: From the perspective of perception consistency, hard
adversarial samples that can still attack the robust model after AT are already
learned better than those successfully defended. Thus, different from previous
views, we argue that it is rather the over-sufficient learning of hard
adversarial samples that degrades the decision boundary and contributes to the
trade-off problem. Specifically, the excessive pursuit of perception
consistency would force the model to view the perturbations as noise and ignore
the information within them, which should have been utilized to induce a
smoother perception transition towards the decision boundary to support its
establishment to an appropriate location. In response, we define a new AT
objective named Robust Perception, encouraging the model perception to change
smoothly with input perturbations, based on which we propose a novel Robust
Perception Adversarial Training (RPAT) method, effectively mitigating the
current accuracy-robustness trade-off. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and
Tiny-ImageNet with ResNet-18, PreActResNet-18, and WideResNet-34-10 demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method beyond four common baselines and 12
state-of-the-art (SOTA) works. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Mamba模型因内容无关性和固定扫描方式，无法动态利用内容依赖关系。

Method: 提出CAM，包括内容感知token重组和全局先验集成。

Result: CMIC在多个基准测试中超越VTM-21.0，BD-rate显著降低。

Conclusion: CAM有效提升了全局依赖捕捉能力，同时保持计算效率。

Abstract: Recent Learned image compression (LIC) leverages Mamba-style state-space
models (SSMs) for global receptive fields with linear complexity. However,
vanilla Mamba is content-agnostic, relying on fixed and predefined selective
scans, which restricts its ability to dynamically and fully exploit content
dependencies. We introduce Content-Adaptive Mamba (CAM), a dynamic SSM that
addresses two critical limitations. First, it employs content-aware token
reorganization, clustering and reordering tokens based on content similarity to
prioritize proximity in feature space over Euclidean space. Second, it
integrates global priors into SSM via a prompt dictionary, effectively
mitigating the strict causality and long-range decay in the token interactions
of Mamba. These innovations enable CAM to better capture global dependencies
while preserving computational efficiency. Leveraging CAM, our Content-Adaptive
Mamba-based LIC model (CMIC) achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance, surpassing VTM-21.0 by -15.91\%, -21.34\%, and -17.58\% BD-rate on
Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC benchmarks, respectively.

Conclusion: COSFormer为临床WSI分析提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) analysis, with its ability to reveal detailed tissue
structures in magnified views, plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis and
prognosis. Due to their giga-sized nature, WSIs require substantial storage and
computational resources for processing and training predictive models. With the
rapid increase in WSIs used in clinics and hospitals, there is a growing need
for a continual learning system that can efficiently process and adapt existing
models to new tasks without retraining or fine-tuning on previous tasks. Such a
system must balance resource efficiency with high performance. In this study,
we introduce COSFormer, a Transformer-based continual learning framework
tailored for multi-task WSI analysis. COSFormer is designed to learn
sequentially from new tasks wile avoiding the need to revisit full historical
datasets. We evaluate COSFormer on a sequence of seven WSI datasets covering
seven organs and six WSI-related tasks under both class-incremental and
task-incremental settings. The results demonstrate COSFormer's superior
generalizability and effectiveness compared to existing continual learning
frameworks, establishing it as a robust solution for continual WSI analysis in
clinical applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件的单积分（ESI）方法，用于实时高帧率强度图像重建，适用于无人机视觉跟踪等场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和高时间分辨率等优势，但如何从异步事件流中提取有效信息并实现高效处理是关键挑战。

Method: ESI通过单次积分事件流结合增强衰减算法，实现实时强度图像重建，计算负载低。

Result: ESI在运行效率、重建质量和帧率上优于现有算法，尤其在低光照条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: ESI显著提升了无人机在视觉恶劣环境下的感知能力，适合实时应用。

Abstract: Event cameras offer significant advantages, including a wide dynamic range,
high temporal resolution, and immunity to motion blur, making them highly
promising for addressing challenging visual conditions. Extracting and
utilizing effective information from asynchronous event streams is essential
for the onboard implementation of event cameras. In this paper, we propose a
streamlined event-based intensity reconstruction scheme, event-based single
integration (ESI), to address such implementation challenges. This method
guarantees the portability of conventional frame-based vision methods to
event-based scenarios and maintains the intrinsic advantages of event cameras.
The ESI approach reconstructs intensity images by performing a single
integration of the event streams combined with an enhanced decay algorithm.
Such a method enables real-time intensity reconstruction at a high frame rate,
typically 100 FPS. Furthermore, the relatively low computation load of ESI fits
onboard implementation suitably, such as in UAV-based visual tracking
scenarios. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the
performance comparison of ESI and state-of-the-art algorithms. Compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, ESI demonstrates remarkable runtime efficiency
improvements, superior reconstruction quality, and a high frame rate. As a
result, ESI enhances UAV onboard perception significantly under visual
adversary surroundings. In-flight tests, ESI demonstrates effective performance
for UAV onboard visual tracking under extremely low illumination
conditions(2-10lux), whereas other comparative algorithms fail due to
insufficient frame rate, poor image quality, or limited real-time performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiTs在视觉生成任务中表现出色，但推理速度慢限制了其在低资源应用中的部署。现有方法存在内存和计算开销大、固定缓存调度导致输出质量下降的问题。

Method: 将泰勒预测目标从模块级转移到最后一个块级，减少缓存特征；利用第一块的预测误差动态调整缓存机制，确保预测可靠性。

Result: 在FLUX、DiT和Wan Video上分别实现了3.17倍、2.36倍和4.14倍的加速，且质量下降可忽略。

Conclusion: 该方法在速度和生成质量之间取得了更好的平衡，为DiTs的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
visual generation tasks. However, their low inference speed limits their
deployment in low-resource applications. Recent training-free approaches
exploit the redundancy of features across timesteps by caching and reusing past
representations to accelerate inference. Building on this idea, TaylorSeer
instead uses cached features to predict future ones via Taylor expansion.
However, its module-level prediction across all transformer blocks (e.g.,
attention or feedforward modules) requires storing fine-grained intermediate
features, leading to notable memory and computation overhead. Moreover, it
adopts a fixed caching schedule without considering the varying accuracy of
predictions across timesteps, which can lead to degraded outputs when
prediction fails. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to
better leverage Taylor-based acceleration. First, we shift the Taylor
prediction target from the module level to the last block level, significantly
reducing the number of cached features. Furthermore, observing strong
sequential dependencies among Transformer blocks, we propose to use the error
between the Taylor-estimated and actual outputs of the first block as an
indicator of prediction reliability. If the error is small, we trust the Taylor
prediction for the last block; otherwise, we fall back to full computation,
thereby enabling a dynamic caching mechanism. Empirical results show that our
method achieves a better balance between speed and quality, achieving a 3.17x
acceleration on FLUX, 2.36x on DiT, and 4.14x on Wan Video with negligible
quality drop. The Project Page is

Motivation: 现有方法存在图像数据冗余和视觉特征一次性提取的问题，影响效果和准确性。

Method: 提出I2CR框架，优先利用文本信息，不足时通过多轮迭代整合关键视觉线索。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上性能提升3.2%、5.1%和1.6%。

Conclusion: I2CR框架显著优于现有方法，解决了多模态实体链接中的关键问题。

Abstract: Multimodal entity linking plays a crucial role in a wide range of
applications. Recent advances in large language model-based methods have become
the dominant paradigm for this task, effectively leveraging both textual and
visual modalities to enhance performance. Despite their success, these methods
still face two challenges, including unnecessary incorporation of image data in
certain scenarios and the reliance only on a one-time extraction of visual
features, which can undermine their effectiveness and accuracy. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-based framework for the multimodal
entity linking task, called Intra- and Inter-modal Collaborative Reflections.
This framework prioritizes leveraging text information to address the task.
When text alone is insufficient to link the correct entity through intra- and
inter-modality evaluations, it employs a multi-round iterative strategy that
integrates key visual clues from various aspects of the image to support
reasoning and enhance matching accuracy. Extensive experiments on three widely
used public datasets demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
current state-of-the-art methods in the task, achieving improvements of 3.2%,
5.1%, and 1.6%, respectively. Our code is available at

Result: 实验验证了设计的合理性，并展示了优于其他方法的性能。

Conclusion: DerProp通过导数标签传播有效解决了相似性度量中的不适定问题，提升了半监督语义分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation, which leverages a limited set of
labeled images, helps to relieve the heavy annotation burden. While
pseudo-labeling strategies yield promising results, there is still room for
enhancing the reliability of pseudo-labels. Hence, we develop a semi-supervised
framework, namely DerProp, equipped with a novel derivative label propagation
to rectify imperfect pseudo-labels. Our label propagation method imposes
discrete derivative operations on pixel-wise feature vectors as additional
regularization, thereby generating strictly regularized similarity metrics.
Doing so effectively alleviates the ill-posed problem that identical
similarities correspond to different features, through constraining the
solution space. Extensive experiments are conducted to verify the rationality
of our design, and demonstrate our superiority over other methods. Codes are
available at https://github.com/ForawardStar/DerProp/.

Conclusion: Patho-AgenticRAG通过多模态检索和推理能力，有效解决了病理学中的幻觉问题，提升了诊断准确性。

Abstract: Although Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong generalization in
medical imaging, pathology presents unique challenges due to ultra-high
resolution, complex tissue structures, and nuanced clinical semantics. These
factors make pathology VLMs prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating outputs
inconsistent with visual evidence, which undermines clinical trust. Existing
RAG approaches in this domain largely depend on text-based knowledge bases,
limiting their ability to leverage diagnostic visual cues. To address this, we
propose Patho-AgenticRAG, a multimodal RAG framework with a database built on
page-level embeddings from authoritative pathology textbooks. Unlike
traditional text-only retrieval systems, it supports joint text-image search,
enabling direct retrieval of textbook pages that contain both the queried text
and relevant visual cues, thus avoiding the loss of critical image-based
information. Patho-AgenticRAG also supports reasoning, task decomposition, and
multi-turn search interactions, improving accuracy in complex diagnostic
scenarios. Experiments show that Patho-AgenticRAG significantly outperforms
existing multimodal models in complex pathology tasks like multiple-choice
diagnosis and visual question answering. Our project is available at the

Conclusion: SplatSSC通过深度引导和鲁棒聚合策略，显著提升了单目3D语义场景补全的性能和效率。

Abstract: Monocular 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is a challenging yet promising
task that aims to infer dense geometric and semantic descriptions of a scene
from a single image. While recent object-centric paradigms significantly
improve efficiency by leveraging flexible 3D Gaussian primitives, they still
rely heavily on a large number of randomly initialized primitives, which
inevitably leads to 1) inefficient primitive initialization and 2) outlier
primitives that introduce erroneous artifacts. In this paper, we propose
SplatSSC, a novel framework that resolves these limitations with a depth-guided
initialization strategy and a principled Gaussian aggregator. Instead of random
initialization, SplatSSC utilizes a dedicated depth branch composed of a
Group-wise Multi-scale Fusion (GMF) module, which integrates multi-scale image
and depth features to generate a sparse yet representative set of initial
Gaussian primitives. To mitigate noise from outlier primitives, we develop the
Decoupled Gaussian Aggregator (DGA), which enhances robustness by decomposing
geometric and semantic predictions during the Gaussian-to-voxel splatting
process. Complemented with a specialized Probability Scale Loss, our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Occ-ScanNet dataset, outperforming
prior approaches by over 6.3% in IoU and 4.1% in mIoU, while reducing both
latency and memory consumption by more than 9.3%. The code will be released
upon acceptance.

Method: 结合对比学习与半监督学习，设计任务间注意力和显著性模块，提出任务间一致性学习策略，并收集了SZ-TUS数据集。

Result: 在两个公共超声数据集和一个私有数据集上，Hermes在多种半监督设置下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Hermes通过任务间信息共享和一致性学习，显著提升了超声图像分类和分割的性能。

Abstract: Confidence-based pseudo-label selection usually generates overly confident
yet incorrect predictions, due to the early misleadingness of model and
overfitting inaccurate pseudo-labels in the learning process, which heavily
degrades the performance of semi-supervised contrastive learning. Moreover,
segmentation and classification tasks are treated independently and the
affinity fails to be fully explored. To address these issues, we propose a
novel semi-supervised dual-threshold contrastive learning strategy for
ultrasound image classification and segmentation, named Hermes. This strategy
combines the strengths of contrastive learning with semi-supervised learning,
where the pseudo-labels assist contrastive learning by providing additional
guidance. Specifically, an inter-task attention and saliency module is also
developed to facilitate information sharing between the segmentation and
classification tasks. Furthermore, an inter-task consistency learning strategy
is designed to align tumor features across both tasks, avoiding negative
transfer for reducing features discrepancy. To solve the lack of publicly
available ultrasound datasets, we have collected the SZ-TUS dataset, a thyroid
ultrasound image dataset. Extensive experiments on two public ultrasound
datasets and one private dataset demonstrate that Hermes consistently
outperforms several state-of-the-art methods across various semi-supervised
settings.

Abstract: Local feature matching remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision.
Recent Area to Point Matching (A2PM) methods have improved matching accuracy.
However, existing research based on this framework relies on inefficient
pixel-level comparisons and complex graph matching that limit scalability. In
this work, we introduce the Semantic and Geometric-aware Descriptor Network
(SGAD), which fundamentally rethinks area-based matching by generating highly
discriminative area descriptors that enable direct matching without complex
graph optimization. This approach significantly improves both accuracy and
efficiency of area matching. We further improve the performance of area
matching through a novel supervision strategy that decomposes the area matching
task into classification and ranking subtasks. Finally, we introduce the
Hierarchical Containment Redundancy Filter (HCRF) to eliminate overlapping
areas by analyzing containment graphs. SGAD demonstrates remarkable performance
gains, reducing runtime by 60x (0.82s vs. 60.23s) compared to MESA. Extensive
evaluations show consistent improvements across multiple point matchers:
SGAD+LoFTR reduces runtime compared to DKM, while achieving higher accuracy
(0.82s vs. 1.51s, 65.98 vs. 61.11) in outdoor pose estimation, and SGAD+ROMA
delivers +7.39% AUC@5{\deg} in indoor pose estimation, establishing a new

Conclusion: 边缘增强预训练需选择性应用，元学习策略能有效优化预训练方法选择，提升跨模态医学图像分割性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for disease diagnosis and treatment
planning, yet developing robust segmentation models often requires substantial
computational resources and large datasets. Existing research shows that
pre-trained and finetuned foundation models can boost segmentation performance.
However, questions remain about how particular image preprocessing steps may
influence segmentation performance across different medical imaging modalities.
In particular, edges-abrupt transitions in pixel intensity-are widely
acknowledged as vital cues for object boundaries but have not been
systematically examined in the pre-training of foundation models. We address
this gap by investigating to which extend pre-training with data processed
using computationally efficient edge kernels, such as kirsch, can improve
cross-modality segmentation capabilities of a foundation model. Two versions of
a foundation model are first trained on either raw or edge-enhanced data across
multiple medical imaging modalities, then finetuned on selected raw subsets
tailored to specific medical modalities. After systematic investigation using
the medical domains Dermoscopy, Fundus, Mammography, Microscopy, OCT, US, and
XRay, we discover both increased and reduced segmentation performance across
modalities using edge-focused pre-training, indicating the need for a selective
application of this approach. To guide such selective applications, we propose
a meta-learning strategy. It uses standard deviation and image entropy of the
raw image to choose between a model pre-trained on edge-enhanced or on raw data
for optimal performance. Our experiments show that integrating this
meta-learning layer yields an overall segmentation performance improvement
across diverse medical imaging tasks by 16.42% compared to models pre-trained
on edge-enhanced data only and 19.30% compared to models pre-trained on raw
data only.

Event cameras, with their asynchronous nature and high temporal resolution,
offer a solution by capturing motion continuously. The recent approach, which
integrates event cameras with conventional sensors for continuous-time
detection, struggles in fast-motion scenarios due to its dependency on
synchronized sensors. We propose a novel stereo 3D object detection framework
that relies solely on event cameras, eliminating the need for conventional 3D
sensors. To compensate for the lack of semantic and geometric information in
event data, we introduce a dual filter mechanism that extracts both.
Additionally, we enhance regression by aligning bounding boxes with
object-centric information. Experiments show that our method outperforms prior
approaches in dynamic environments, demonstrating the potential of event
cameras for robust, continuous-time 3D perception. The code is available at

### [290] [Towards Real Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Via Confident Meta-Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02293)
*Muhammad Aqeel,Shakiba Sharifi,Marco Cristani,Francesco Setti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Confident Meta-learning (CoMet)，一种无需手动筛选数据的深度异常检测训练策略，通过结合Soft Confident Learning和Meta-Learning提升模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无监督异常检测假设训练数据均为正常样本，需手动筛选数据，引入偏差且适应性差。

Method: CoMet结合Soft Confident Learning（低权重低置信度样本）和Meta-Learning（基于验证损失协方差正则化更新），防止过拟合并增强对噪声数据的鲁棒性。

Result: 在MVTec-AD等数据集上，CoMet显著优于基线方法，对训练集中的异常不敏感，并刷新了所有数据集的SOTA。

Conclusion: CoMet是一种模型无关的方法，可应用于任何基于梯度下降的异常检测模型，有效解决了数据筛选问题。

Abstract: So-called unsupervised anomaly detection is better described as
semi-supervised, as it assumes all training data are nominal. This assumption
simplifies training but requires manual data curation, introducing bias and
limiting adaptability. We propose Confident Meta-learning (CoMet), a novel
training strategy that enables deep anomaly detection models to learn from
uncurated datasets where nominal and anomalous samples coexist, eliminating the
need for explicit filtering. Our approach integrates Soft Confident Learning,
which assigns lower weights to low-confidence samples, and Meta-Learning, which
stabilizes training by regularizing updates based on training validation loss
covariance. This prevents overfitting and enhances robustness to noisy data.
CoMet is model-agnostic and can be applied to any anomaly detection method
trainable via gradient descent. Experiments on MVTec-AD, VIADUCT, and KSDD2
with two state-of-the-art models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
consistently improving over the baseline methods, remaining insensitive to
anomalies in the training set, and setting a new state-of-the-art across all
datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自监督学习的全身表征学习方法，用于多种疾病的临床前风险评估，优于传统放射组学方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的风险预测方法通常仅针对单一疾病且依赖手工特征提取，限制了其临床应用潜力。

Method: 采用自监督学习框架，结合竞争风险模型，进行全身表征学习，并模拟临床前筛查场景。

Result: 在心血管疾病、2型糖尿病、慢性阻塞性肺病和慢性肾病等多种疾病中表现优于传统方法，且与心脏MRI结合可进一步提升预测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法具有作为独立筛查工具或多模态框架组成部分的潜力，可用于早期个性化风险评估。

Abstract: Reliable preclinical disease risk assessment is essential to move public
healthcare from reactive treatment to proactive identification and prevention.
However, image-based risk prediction algorithms often consider one condition at
a time and depend on hand-crafted features obtained through segmentation tools.
We propose a whole-body self-supervised representation learning method for the
preclinical disease risk assessment under a competing risk modeling. This
approach outperforms whole-body radiomics in multiple diseases, including
cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Simulating a
preclinical screening scenario and subsequently combining with cardiac MRI, it
sharpens further the prediction for CVD subgroups: ischemic heart disease
(IHD), hypertensive diseases (HD), and stroke. The results indicate the
translational potential of whole-body representations as a standalone screening
modality and as part of a multi-modal framework within clinical workflows for
early personalized risk stratification. The code is available at

Motivation: 探讨AI在医疗决策中延迟至人类专家的能力，尤其是在数据分布变化时的表现。

Method: 通过眼科数据集评估学习式延迟模型和不确定性量化方法在分布内外数据上的表现。

Result: 不确定性量化方法在延迟决策时表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 不确定性量化方法可能是AI延迟决策的更好选择。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds the potential to dramatically improve
patient care. However, it is not infallible, necessitating
human-AI-collaboration to ensure safe implementation. One aspect of AI safety
is the models' ability to defer decisions to a human expert when they are
likely to misclassify autonomously. Recent research has focused on methods that
learn to defer by optimising a surrogate loss function that finds the optimal
trade-off between predicting a class label or deferring. However, during
clinical translation, models often face challenges such as data shift.
Uncertainty quantification methods aim to estimate a model's confidence in its
predictions. However, they may also be used as a deferral strategy which does
not rely on learning from specific training distribution. We hypothesise that
models developed to quantify uncertainty are more robust to out-of-distribution
(OOD) input than learned deferral models that have been trained in a supervised
fashion. To investigate this hypothesis, we constructed an extensive evaluation
study on a large ophthalmology dataset, examining both learned deferral models
and established uncertainty quantification methods, assessing their performance
in- and out-of-distribution. Specifically, we evaluate their ability to
accurately classify glaucoma from fundus images while deferring cases with a
high likelihood of error. We find that uncertainty quantification methods may
be a promising choice for AI deferral.

Conclusion: 逻辑驱动的双符号约束有效提升了零样本组合动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Zero-shot compositional action recognition (ZS-CAR) aims to identify unseen
verb-object compositions in the videos by exploiting the learned knowledge of
verb and object primitives during training. Despite compositional learning's
progress in ZS-CAR, two critical challenges persist: 1) Missing compositional
structure constraint, leading to spurious correlations between primitives; 2)
Neglecting semantic hierarchy constraint, leading to semantic ambiguity and
impairing the training process. In this paper, we argue that human-like
symbolic reasoning offers a principled solution to these challenges by
explicitly modeling compositional and hierarchical structured abstraction. To
this end, we propose a logic-driven ZS-CAR framework LogicCAR that integrates
dual symbolic constraints: Explicit Compositional Logic and Hierarchical
Primitive Logic. Specifically, the former models the restrictions within the
compositions, enhancing the compositional reasoning ability of our model. The
latter investigates the semantical dependencies among different primitives,
empowering the models with fine-to-coarse reasoning capacity. By formalizing
these constraints in first-order logic and embedding them into neural network
architectures, LogicCAR systematically bridges the gap between symbolic
abstraction and existing models. Extensive experiments on the Sth-com dataset
demonstrate that our LogicCAR outperforms existing baseline methods, proving
the effectiveness of our logic-driven constraints.

Abstract: Volumetric scene reconstruction from a single image is crucial for a broad
range of applications like autonomous driving and robotics. Recent volumetric
reconstruction methods achieve impressive results, but generally require
expensive 3D ground truth or multi-view supervision. We propose to leverage
pre-trained 2D diffusion models and depth prediction models to generate
synthetic scene geometry from a single image. This can then be used to distill
a feed-forward scene reconstruction model. Our experiments on the challenging
KITTI-360 and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our method matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines that use multi-view supervision, and offers unique
advantages, for example regarding dynamic scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂文本渲染和图像编辑一致性的挑战，提升模型在多种语言和任务中的表现。

Method: 采用大规模数据管道和渐进训练策略，结合多任务训练（T2I、TI2I、I2I）和双编码机制（Qwen2.5-VL和VAE）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，尤其在英语和中文等语言的文本渲染及图像编辑方面表现突出。

Conclusion: Qwen-Image在图像生成和编辑任务中展现出强大的能力，为复杂文本渲染和一致性编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Qwen-Image, an image generation foundation model in the Qwen
series that achieves significant advances in complex text rendering and precise
image editing. To address the challenges of complex text rendering, we design a
comprehensive data pipeline that includes large-scale data collection,
filtering, annotation, synthesis, and balancing. Moreover, we adopt a
progressive training strategy that starts with non-text-to-text rendering,
evolves from simple to complex textual inputs, and gradually scales up to
paragraph-level descriptions. This curriculum learning approach substantially
enhances the model's native text rendering capabilities. As a result,
Qwen-Image not only performs exceptionally well in alphabetic languages such as
English, but also achieves remarkable progress on more challenging logographic
languages like Chinese. To enhance image editing consistency, we introduce an
improved multi-task training paradigm that incorporates not only traditional
text-to-image (T2I) and text-image-to-image (TI2I) tasks but also
image-to-image (I2I) reconstruction, effectively aligning the latent
representations between Qwen2.5-VL and MMDiT. Furthermore, we separately feed
the original image into Qwen2.5-VL and the VAE encoder to obtain semantic and
reconstructive representations, respectively. This dual-encoding mechanism
enables the editing module to strike a balance between preserving semantic
consistency and maintaining visual fidelity. Qwen-Image achieves
state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its strong capabilities in both
image generation and editing across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 尽管CLIP等视觉语言模型在视觉与语言对齐方面表现优异，但其细粒度视觉理解能力仍有不足。

Method: 1. 利用指令编辑数据集生成硬负样本对，结合对称硬负对比损失；2. 引入长描述性标题，使用旋转位置编码捕捉语义上下文。

Result: 在MMVP基准和细粒度视觉任务中表现显著提升，同时保持零样本任务的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CLIP-IN展示了结合指令对比学习和描述性信息提升视觉语言模型细粒度理解的潜力。

Abstract: Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning
vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual
comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework
that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations.
Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for
image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs.
Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model
to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly,
CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional
encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our
experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP
benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without
compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and
retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into
Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations
and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable
potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with
comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding
of VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有球面模式旋转估计方法计算复杂度高（O(n^3)）且对异常值敏感，需改进。

Method: 将球面模式表示为离散3D点集，重新定义为球面点集对齐问题（Wahba问题），提出三种算法：SPMC、FRS及混合方法。

Result: 实验显示，在S^2域和无对应关系设置下，算法比现有方法快10倍、准确10倍。

Conclusion: 新算法高效且鲁棒，适用于点云配准和球面图像旋转估计等实际任务。

Abstract: Existing methods for rotation estimation between two spherical
($\mathbb{S}^2$) patterns typically rely on spherical cross-correlation
maximization between two spherical function. However, these approaches exhibit
computational complexities greater than cubic $O(n^3)$ with respect to rotation
space discretization and lack extensive evaluation under significant outlier
contamination. To this end, we propose a rotation estimation algorithm between
two spherical patterns with linear time complexity $O(n)$. Unlike existing
spherical-function-based methods, we explicitly represent spherical patterns as
discrete 3D point sets on the unit sphere, reformulating rotation estimation as
a spherical point-set alignment (i.e., Wahba problem for 3D unit vectors).
Given the geometric nature of our formulation, our spherical pattern alignment
algorithm naturally aligns with the Wahba problem framework for 3D unit
vectors. Specifically, we introduce three novel algorithms: (1) SPMC (Spherical
Pattern Matching by Correlation), (2) FRS (Fast Rotation Search), and (3) a
hybrid approach (SPMC+FRS) that combines the advantages of the previous two
methods. Our experiments demonstrate that in the $\mathbb{S}^2$ domain and in
correspondence-free settings, our algorithms are over 10x faster and over 10x
more accurate than current state-of-the-art methods for the Wahba problem with
outliers. We validate our approach through extensive simulations on a new
dataset of spherical patterns, the ``Robust Vector Alignment Dataset.
"Furthermore, we adapt our methods to two real-world tasks: (i) Point Cloud
Registration (PCR) and (ii) rotation estimation for spherical images.

Motivation: 解决视频搜索中视觉多样性导致的检索不全面问题，现有方法忽视了多样性空间的需求。

Result: 在TRECVID AVS基准测试中验证了LPD的有效性，可视化显示其能增强结果多样性。

Conclusion: LPD通过多样化空间和损失设计，显著提升了视频搜索的多样性和检索性能。

Abstract: Ad-hoc Video Search (AVS) involves using a textual query to search for
multiple relevant videos in a large collection of unlabeled short videos. The
main challenge of AVS is the visual diversity of relevant videos. A simple
query such as "Find shots of a man and a woman dancing together indoors" can
span a multitude of environments, from brightly lit halls and shadowy bars to
dance scenes in black-and-white animations. It is therefore essential to
retrieve relevant videos as comprehensively as possible. Current solutions for
the AVS task primarily fuse multiple features into one or more common spaces,
yet overlook the need for diverse spaces. To fully exploit the expressive
capability of individual features, we propose LPD, short for Learning Partially
Decorrelated common spaces. LPD incorporates two key innovations:
feature-specific common space construction and the de-correlation loss.
Specifically, LPD learns a separate common space for each video and text
feature, and employs de-correlation loss to diversify the ordering of negative
samples across different spaces. To enhance the consistency of multi-space
convergence, we designed an entropy-based fair multi-space triplet ranking
loss. Extensive experiments on the TRECVID AVS benchmarks (2016-2023) justify
the effectiveness of LPD. Moreover, diversity visualizations of LPD's spaces
highlight its ability to enhance result diversity.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了实际应用潜力，为NLoS行人定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Pedestrians Localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) regions within urban
environments poses a significant challenge for autonomous driving systems.
While mmWave radar has demonstrated potential for detecting objects in such
scenarios, the 2D radar point cloud (PCD) data is susceptible to distortions
caused by multipath reflections, making accurate spatial inference difficult.
Additionally, although camera images provide high-resolution visual
information, they lack depth perception and cannot directly observe objects in
NLoS regions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that interprets radar
PCD through road layout inferred from camera for localization of NLoS
pedestrians. The proposed method leverages visual information from the camera
to interpret 2D radar PCD, enabling spatial scene reconstruction. The
effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through experiments
conducted using a radar-camera system mounted on a real vehicle. The
localization performance is evaluated using a dataset collected in outdoor NLoS
driving environments, demonstrating the practical applicability of the method.

Conclusion: Text2Lip为可控且灵活的说话人脸生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Generating semantically coherent and visually accurate talking faces requires
bridging the gap between linguistic meaning and facial articulation. Although
audio-driven methods remain prevalent, their reliance on high-quality paired
audio visual data and the inherent ambiguity in mapping acoustics to lip motion
pose significant challenges in terms of scalability and robustness. To address
these issues, we propose Text2Lip, a viseme-centric framework that constructs
an interpretable phonetic-visual bridge by embedding textual input into
structured viseme sequences. These mid-level units serve as a linguistically
grounded prior for lip motion prediction. Furthermore, we design a progressive
viseme-audio replacement strategy based on curriculum learning, enabling the
model to gradually transition from real audio to pseudo-audio reconstructed
from enhanced viseme features via cross-modal attention. This allows for robust
generation in both audio-present and audio-free scenarios. Finally, a
landmark-guided renderer synthesizes photorealistic facial videos with accurate
lip synchronization. Extensive evaluations show that Text2Lip outperforms
existing approaches in semantic fidelity, visual realism, and modality
robustness, establishing a new paradigm for controllable and flexible talking
face generation. Our project homepage is https://plyon1.github.io/Text2Lip/.

Conclusion: OTIP在保持计算效率的同时，显著提升了图像反演的质量和编辑灵活性。

Abstract: Effective image inversion in rectified flow models - mapping real images to
editable latent representations - is crucial for practical image editing
applications; however, achieving optimal balance between reconstruction
fidelity and editing flexibility remains a fundamental challenge. In this work,
we introduce the Optimal Transport Inversion Pipeline (OTIP), a zero-shot
framework that leverages optimal transport theory to guide the inversion
process in rectified flow models. Our underlying hypothesis is that
incorporating transport-based guidance during the reverse diffusion process can
effectively balance reconstruction accuracy and editing controllability through
principled trajectory optimization. The method computes optimal transport paths
between image and noise distributions while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our approach achieves high-fidelity reconstruction with LPIPS
scores of 0.001 and SSIM of 0.992 on face editing benchmarks, demonstrating
superior preservation of fine-grained details compared to existing methods. We
evaluate the framework across multiple editing tasks, observing 7.8% to 12.9%
improvements in reconstruction loss over RF-Inversion on the LSUN-Bedroom and
LSUN-Church datasets, respectively. For semantic face editing, our method
achieves an 11.2% improvement in identity preservation and a 1.6% enhancement
in perceptual quality, while maintaining computational efficiency comparable to
baseline approaches. Qualitatively, our method produces visually compelling
edits with superior semantic consistency and fine-grained detail preservation
across diverse editing scenarios. Code is available at:

Motivation: 港口物流中识别运输单元的效率提升受限于缺乏公开的多样化数据集，因此作者提出了TRUDI数据集和TITUS管道来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过TRUDI数据集（包含35,034个标注实例）和TITUS管道（分三阶段：分割TU实例、检测ID文本位置、识别并验证ID）来识别运输单元。

Result: TITUS在不同视角、光照和天气条件下均能可靠识别TUs，优于依赖特定场景或角度的替代系统。

Conclusion: TRUDI数据集和TITUS管道为港口物流的数字化转型提供了有力支持，提升了物流链效率。

Abstract: Identifying transportation units (TUs) is essential for improving the
efficiency of port logistics. However, progress in this field has been hindered
by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets that capture the diversity
and dynamics of real-world port environments. To address this gap, we present
the TRUDI dataset-a comprehensive collection comprising 35,034 annotated
instances across five categories: container, tank container, trailer, ID text,
and logo. The images were captured at operational ports using both ground-based
and aerial cameras, under a wide variety of lighting and weather conditions.
For the identification of TUs-which involves reading the 11-digit alphanumeric
ID typically painted on each unit-we introduce TITUS, a dedicated pipeline that
operates in three stages: (1) segmenting the TU instances, (2) detecting the
location of the ID text, and (3) recognising and validating the extracted ID.
Unlike alternative systems, which often require similar scenes, specific camera
angles or gate setups, our evaluation demonstrates that TITUS reliably
identifies TUs from a range of camera perspectives and in varying lighting and
weather conditions. By making the TRUDI dataset publicly available, we provide
a robust benchmark that enables the development and comparison of new
approaches. This contribution supports digital transformation efforts in
multipurpose ports and helps to increase the efficiency of entire logistics
chains.

Abstract: Layout generation plays a crucial role in enhancing both user experience and
design efficiency. However, current approaches suffer from task-specific
generation capabilities and perceptually misaligned evaluation metrics, leading
to limited applicability and ineffective measurement. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Uni-Layout}, a novel framework that achieves unified generation,
human-mimicking evaluation and alignment between the two. For universal
generation, we incorporate various layout tasks into a single taxonomy and
develop a unified generator that handles background or element contents
constrained tasks via natural language prompts. To introduce human feedback for
the effective evaluation of layouts, we build \textit{Layout-HF100k}, the first
large-scale human feedback dataset with 100,000 expertly annotated layouts.
Based on \textit{Layout-HF100k}, we introduce a human-mimicking evaluator that
integrates visual and geometric information, employing a Chain-of-Thought
mechanism to conduct qualitative assessments alongside a confidence estimation
module to yield quantitative measurements. For better alignment between the
generator and the evaluator, we integrate them into a cohesive system by
adopting Dynamic-Margin Preference Optimization (DMPO), which dynamically
adjusts margins based on preference strength to better align with human
judgments. Extensive experiments show that \textit{Uni-Layout} significantly
outperforms both task-specific and general-purpose methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/JD-GenX/Uni-Layout.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个多模态遥感数据集SMART-Ship，用于分析停泊船只，包含五种模态的图像数据，支持多种遥感任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多尺度目标和动态环境下的海上监视挑战，提供时空一致的多模态数据。

Method: 构建包含1092组多模态图像的数据集，每组图像在一周内获取并注册，标注多边形位置、细粒度类别等信息。

Result: 数据集支持多种多模态遥感任务，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SMART-Ship数据集为多模态遥感任务提供了基础，并指出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: Given the limitations of satellite orbits and imaging conditions, multi-modal
remote sensing (RS) data is crucial in enabling long-term earth observation.
However, maritime surveillance remains challenging due to the complexity of
multi-scale targets and the dynamic environments. To bridge this critical gap,
we propose a Synchronized Multi-modal Aligned Remote sensing Targets dataset
for berthed ships analysis (SMART-Ship), containing spatiotemporal registered
images with fine-grained annotation for maritime targets from five modalities:
visible-light, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), panchromatic, multi-spectral,
and near-infrared. Specifically, our dataset consists of 1092 multi-modal image
sets, covering 38,838 ships. Each image set is acquired within one week and
registered to ensure spatiotemporal consistency. Ship instances in each set are
annotated with polygonal location information, fine-grained categories,
instance-level identifiers, and change region masks, organized hierarchically
to support diverse multi-modal RS tasks. Furthermore, we define standardized
benchmarks on five fundamental tasks and comprehensively compare representative
methods across the dataset. Thorough experiment evaluations validate that the
proposed SMART-Ship dataset could support various multi-modal RS interpretation
tasks and reveal the promising directions for further exploration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COLER是一种无监督实例分割和对象检测方法，通过CutOnce生成粗伪标签，并通过自训练提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动无监督对象定位领域的发展，提出一种简单且高效的方法。

Method: 使用CutOnce生成伪标签，结合自训练优化检测器性能。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: COLER是一种零样本无监督模型，具有潜力推动无监督对象定位的进步。

Abstract: We propose Cut-Once-and-LEaRn (COLER), a simple approach for unsupervised
instance segmentation and object detection. COLER first uses our developed
CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn
from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut only once and does not rely on
any clustering methods, but it can generate multiple object masks in an image.
We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce
to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised models,
but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER
achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions
for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through
self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms
previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks.We believe our method
can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hydra结合毫米波雷达与摄像头技术，通过深度学习检测叶片湿润时间（LWD），在多种环境下实现高精度分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LWD检测方法缺乏标准化且适应性差，无法直接测量真实叶片或在多变环境中保持鲁棒性。

Method: 设计CNN融合毫米波深度图像与RGB图像，结合Transformer编码器生成特征图，通过分类器检测叶片湿润。

Result: 在植物上测试，Hydra分类准确率达96%，在农场复杂环境下仍保持约90%准确率。

Conclusion: Hydra为LWD检测提供了一种高精度、适应性强的解决方案，适用于实际农业场景。

Abstract: Leaf Wetness Duration (LWD), the time that water remains on leaf surfaces, is
crucial in the development of plant diseases. Existing LWD detection lacks
standardized measurement techniques, and variations across different plant
characteristics limit its effectiveness. Prior research proposes diverse
approaches, but they fail to measure real natural leaves directly and lack
resilience in various environmental conditions. This reduces the precision and
robustness, revealing a notable practical application and effectiveness gap in
real-world agricultural settings. This paper presents Hydra, an innovative
approach that integrates millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) radar with camera technology
to detect leaf wetness by determining if there is water on the leaf. We can
measure the time to determine the LWD based on this detection. Firstly, we
design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to selectively fuse multiple
mm-Wave depth images with an RGB image to generate multiple feature images.
Then, we develop a transformer-based encoder to capture the inherent connection
among the multiple feature images to generate a feature map, which is further
fed to a classifier for detection. Moreover, we augment the dataset during
training to generalize our model. Implemented using a frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar within the 76 to 81 GHz band, Hydra's performance
is meticulously evaluated on plants, demonstrating the potential to classify
leaf wetness with up to 96% accuracy across varying scenarios. Deploying Hydra
in the farm, including rainy, dawn, or poorly light nights, it still achieves
an accuracy rate of around 90%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于超图的时间序列变换器网络HGTS-Former，用于解决多变量时间序列数据的高维性和复杂交互问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多变量时间序列分析因高维性、动态性和变量间复杂交互而具有挑战性，超图的结构建模能力为此提供了灵感。

Method: 通过多头自注意力增强时间表示，构建分层超图聚合通道内时间模式和变量间细粒度关系，并通过EdgeToNode模块和前馈网络进一步优化特征。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验验证了HGTS-Former的有效性。

Conclusion: HGTS-Former为解决多变量时间序列分析问题提供了一种有效方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multivariate time series analysis has long been one of the key research
topics in the field of artificial intelligence. However, analyzing complex time
series data remains a challenging and unresolved problem due to its high
dimensionality, dynamic nature, and complex interactions among variables.
Inspired by the strong structural modeling capability of hypergraphs, this
paper proposes a novel hypergraph-based time series transformer backbone
network, termed HGTS-Former, to address the multivariate coupling in time
series data. Specifically, given the multivariate time series signal, we first
normalize and embed each patch into tokens. Then, we adopt the multi-head
self-attention to enhance the temporal representation of each patch. The
hierarchical hypergraphs are constructed to aggregate the temporal patterns
within each channel and fine-grained relations between different variables.
After that, we convert the hyperedge into node features through the EdgeToNode
module and adopt the feed-forward network to further enhance the output
features. Extensive experiments conducted on two multivariate time series tasks
and eight datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed
HGTS-Former. The source code will be released on
https://github.com/Event-AHU/Time_Series_Analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformers (ViTs)的AI方法，直接从MRI图像预测胶质母细胞瘤患者的总生存期(OS)，无需肿瘤分割，简化流程并减少计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤是一种高度侵袭性脑肿瘤，生存期短，预测OS对个性化治疗和临床决策至关重要。

Method: 利用ViTs直接从MRI图像提取特征，避免传统方法中的肿瘤分割步骤，简化工作流程。

Result: 在BRATS数据集上测试准确率为62.5%，在精确率、召回率和F1分数上表现均衡，优于其他模型。

Conclusion: ViTs在医学影像任务中具有潜力，为高效且无需分割的OS预测模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Glioblastoma is one of the most aggressive and common brain tumors, with a
median survival of 10-15 months. Predicting Overall Survival (OS) is critical
for personalizing treatment strategies and aligning clinical decisions with
patient outcomes. In this study, we propose a novel Artificial Intelligence
(AI) approach for OS prediction using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images,
exploiting Vision Transformers (ViTs) to extract hidden features directly from
MRI images, eliminating the need of tumor segmentation. Unlike traditional
approaches, our method simplifies the workflow and reduces computational
resource requirements.
  The proposed model was evaluated on the BRATS dataset, reaching an accuracy
of 62.5% on the test set, comparable to the top-performing methods.
Additionally, it demonstrated balanced performance across precision, recall,
and F1 score, overcoming the best model in these metrics. The dataset size
limits the generalization of the ViT which typically requires larger datasets
compared to convolutional neural networks. This limitation in generalization is
observed across all the cited studies. This work highlights the applicability
of ViTs for downsampled medical imaging tasks and establishes a foundation for
OS prediction models that are computationally efficient and do not rely on
segmentation.

TL;DR: InfoSyncNet是一种非均匀序列建模网络，通过数据增强和动态调整技术提升从无声视频中估计语音内容的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从无声视频中估计语音内容在辅助技术和增强现实中具有重要应用，但现有方法因序列变异性和信息分布不均而面临挑战。

Method: 提出InfoSyncNet，包含非均匀量化模块和多种训练策略，以动态调整网络焦点并处理视觉语音数据的不一致性。

Result: 在LRW和LRW1000数据集上分别达到92.0%和60.7%的Top-1准确率，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: InfoSyncNet通过创新设计和训练策略，显著提升了无声视频语音估计的准确性，为相关应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating spoken content from silent videos is crucial for applications in
Assistive Technology (AT) and Augmented Reality (AR). However, accurately
mapping lip movement sequences in videos to words poses significant challenges
due to variability across sequences and the uneven distribution of information
within each sequence. To tackle this, we introduce InfoSyncNet, a non-uniform
sequence modeling network enhanced by tailored data augmentation techniques.
Central to InfoSyncNet is a non-uniform quantization module positioned between
the encoder and decoder, enabling dynamic adjustment to the network's focus and
effectively handling the natural inconsistencies in visual speech data.
Additionally, multiple training strategies are incorporated to enhance the
model's capability to handle variations in lighting and the speaker's
orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the LRW and LRW1000 datasets confirm
the superiority of InfoSyncNet, achieving new state-of-the-art accuracies of
92.0% and 60.7% Top-1 ACC. The code is available for download (see comments).

*Yonghuang Wu,Wenwen Zeng,Xuan Xie,Chengqian Zhao,Guoqing Wu,Jinhua Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAMPO通过偏好优化改进视觉基础模型，使其能从稀疏视觉交互中推断高级类别意图，显著提升医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型（如SAM）仅能分割显式提示的对象，无法泛化到用户隐式期望的语义相关实例，尤其在密集同质对象（如生物医学核分割）领域表现不足。

Method: 提出SAMPO框架，通过偏好优化使模型隐式捕获目标类别特征，无需依赖语言模型，实现稀疏提示下的鲁棒多对象分割。

Result: 在三个医学分割任务中，SAMPO仅用10%训练数据即超越所有基线方法（如PanNuke-T2任务提升9个百分点）。

Conclusion: SAMPO为视觉基础模型提供了一种新的意图感知对齐范式，无需辅助提示生成器或语言模型支持。

Abstract: Foundation models like Segment Anything Model (SAM) excel in promptable
segmentation but suffer from an intent gap: they segment only explicitly
prompted objects, failing to generalize to semantically related instances
implicitly desired by users. This limitation is critical in domains with dense
homogeneous objects (e.g., biomedical nuclei segmentation), where sparse visual
prompts typically yield incomplete results, rendering dense annotations
impractical due to prohibitive cost. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAMPO
(Segment Anything Model with Preference Optimization), a novel framework that
teaches visual foundation models to infer high-level categorical intent from
sparse visual interactions. Unlike conventional pixel-level fine-tuning, SAMPO
optimizes models to implicitly capture target-class characteristics through
preference optimization. This approach, which operates without dependency on
language models, enables robust multi-object segmentation even under sparse
prompting and demonstrates superior data efficiency during fine-tuning.
Validated on three medical segmentation tasks, SAMPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance: on challenging tasks like PanNuke-T2, our method, when fine-tuned
with only 10% of the training data, significantly outperforms all existing
methods trained on the full 100% dataset, achieving an improvement of over 9
percentage points compared to the best baseline. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for intent-aware alignment in visual foundation models, removing
dependencies on auxiliary prompt generators or language-model-assisted
preference learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore)的新框架，用于多类图像异常检测，解决了现有方法在训练和评估阶段是否使用类别标签时的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多类异常检测模型在性能上通常不如单类模型，且类别信息的使用方式对检测阈值定义的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出了HierCore框架，利用分层记忆库估计类别的决策标准，无需类别标签即可有效工作。

Result: 实验表明，HierCore在所有四种场景下均满足要求，性能稳定且优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierCore在多类异常检测任务中具有实际应用潜力，尤其在类别标签不可用时表现突出。

Abstract: Recent advances in image anomaly detection have extended unsupervised
learning-based models from single-class settings to multi-class frameworks,
aiming to improve efficiency in training time and model storage. When a single
model is trained to handle multiple classes, it often underperforms compared to
class-specific models in terms of per-class detection accuracy. Accordingly,
previous studies have primarily focused on narrowing this performance gap.
However, the way class information is used, or not used, remains a relatively
understudied factor that could influence how detection thresholds are defined
in multi-class image anomaly detection. These thresholds, whether
class-specific or class-agnostic, significantly affect detection outcomes. In
this study, we identify and formalize the requirements that a multi-class image
anomaly detection model must satisfy under different conditions, depending on
whether class labels are available during training and evaluation. We then
re-examine existing methods under these criteria. To meet these challenges, we
propose Hierarchical Coreset (HierCore), a novel framework designed to satisfy
all defined requirements. HierCore operates effectively even without class
labels, leveraging a hierarchical memory bank to estimate class-wise decision
criteria for anomaly detection. We empirically validate the applicability and
robustness of existing methods and HierCore under four distinct scenarios,
determined by the presence or absence of class labels in the training and
evaluation phases. The experimental results demonstrate that HierCore
consistently meets all requirements and maintains strong, stable performance
across all settings, highlighting its practical potential for real-world
multi-class anomaly detection tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种细粒度多重监督（FMS）网络，用于检测和定位多模态媒体篡改（DGM$^4$），通过模态可靠性监督、单模态内部监督和跨模态监督提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因忽视不可靠单模态数据的干扰和缺乏细粒度篡改痕迹挖掘的全面监督而性能受限。

Method: FMS网络包含三个模块：MDSC（多模态决策监督校正）、UFMR（单模态篡改挖掘增强）和MFAR（多模态篡改对齐推理），分别从不同角度提供监督。

Result: 实验表明FMS在性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FMS通过多重监督机制有效提升了DGM$^4$任务的检测能力。

Abstract: The task of Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM$^4$)
is a branch of misinformation detection. Unlike traditional binary
classification, it includes complex subtasks such as forgery content
localization and forgery method classification. Consider that existing methods
are often limited in performance due to neglecting the erroneous interference
caused by unreliable unimodal data and failing to establish comprehensive
forgery supervision for mining fine-grained tampering traces. In this paper, we
present a Fine-grained Multiple Supervisory (FMS) network, which incorporates
modality reliability supervision, unimodal internal supervision and cross-modal
supervision to provide comprehensive guidance for DGM$^4$ detection. For
modality reliability supervision, we propose the Multimodal Decision Supervised
Correction (MDSC) module. It leverages unimodal weak supervision to correct the
multi-modal decision-making process. For unimodal internal supervision, we
propose the Unimodal Forgery Mining Reinforcement (UFMR) module. It amplifies
the disparity between real and fake information within unimodal modality from
both feature-level and sample-level perspectives. For cross-modal supervision,
we propose the Multimodal Forgery Alignment Reasoning (MFAR) module. It
utilizes soft-attention interactions to achieve cross-modal feature perception
from both consistency and inconsistency perspectives, where we also design the
interaction constraints to ensure the interaction quality. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FMS compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 理解视觉认知和实现生动的脑机接口需要从fMRI重建动态视频，但现有方法仅限于单镜头片段，无法处理真实世界中的多镜头场景。

Method: 采用分治解码框架，包括镜头边界预测模块、生成关键帧字幕（利用LLM）和大规模数据合成。

Conclusion: 该研究为多镜头fMRI重建提供了新范式，通过分解和语义提示实现了复杂视觉叙事的准确恢复。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic videos from fMRI is important for understanding visual
cognition and enabling vivid brain-computer interfaces. However, current
methods are critically limited to single-shot clips, failing to address the
multi-shot nature of real-world experiences. Multi-shot reconstruction faces
fundamental challenges: fMRI signal mixing across shots, the temporal
resolution mismatch between fMRI and video obscuring rapid scene changes, and
the lack of dedicated multi-shot fMRI-video datasets. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel divide-and-decode framework for multi-shot fMRI
video reconstruction. Our core innovations are: (1) A shot boundary predictor
module explicitly decomposing mixed fMRI signals into shot-specific segments.
(2) Generative keyframe captioning using LLMs, which decodes robust textual
descriptions from each segment, overcoming temporal blur by leveraging
high-level semantics. (3) Novel large-scale data synthesis (20k samples) from
existing datasets. Experimental results demonstrate our framework outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in multi-shot reconstruction fidelity. Ablation
studies confirm the critical role of fMRI decomposition and semantic
captioning, with decomposition significantly improving decoded caption CLIP
similarity by 71.8%. This work establishes a new paradigm for multi-shot fMRI
reconstruction, enabling accurate recovery of complex visual narratives through
explicit decomposition and semantic prompting.

TL;DR: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）是一种高效的三维重建方法，但会产生浮动伪影。本文提出EFA-GS方法，通过优化高斯分布和动态调整策略减少伪影，提升视觉质量。


<details>

Motivation: 3DGS在低质量初始化时会产生浮动伪影，影响视觉保真度，但其成因尚未充分研究。本文旨在从频域角度分析伪影来源并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出EFA-GS方法，选择性扩展未优化高斯分布以优先学习低频信息，并结合深度和尺度策略动态调整高斯扩展。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，EFA-GS显著减少浮动伪影并保留高频细节，PSNR提升1.68 dB。

Conclusion: EFA-GS有效减少伪影且适用于下游三维编辑任务，代码将开源。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a powerful and computationally efficient
representation for 3D reconstruction. Despite its strengths, 3DGS often
produces floating artifacts, which are erroneous structures detached from the
actual geometry and significantly degrade visual fidelity. The underlying
mechanisms causing these artifacts, particularly in low-quality initialization
scenarios, have not been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the
origins of floating artifacts from a frequency-domain perspective and identify
under-optimized Gaussians as the primary source. Based on our analysis, we
propose \textit{Eliminating-Floating-Artifacts} Gaussian Splatting (EFA-GS),
which selectively expands under-optimized Gaussians to prioritize accurate
low-frequency learning. Additionally, we introduce complementary depth-based
and scale-based strategies to dynamically refine Gaussian expansion,
effectively mitigating detail erosion. Extensive experiments on both synthetic
and real-world datasets demonstrate that EFA-GS substantially reduces floating
artifacts while preserving high-frequency details, achieving an improvement of
1.68 dB in PSNR over baseline method on our RWLQ dataset. Furthermore, we
validate the effectiveness of our approach in downstream 3D editing tasks. Our
implementation will be released on GitHub.

Motivation: 透明物体导致深度相机生成不完整或无效数据，现有方法依赖隐式推理，泛化能力不足。

Method: 结合实例掩码和单目深度估计，显式区分透明区域，针对性学习深度补全。

Result: 在基准数据集和实际场景中表现优于现有方法，准确性和泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: ReMake通过显式区分透明区域，有效解决了深度补全问题，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: Due to the optical properties, transparent objects often lead depth cameras
to generate incomplete or invalid depth data, which in turn reduces the
accuracy and reliability of robotic grasping. Existing approaches typically
input the RGB-D image directly into the network to output the complete depth,
expecting the model to implicitly infer the reliability of depth values.
However, while effective in training datasets, such methods often fail to
generalize to real-world scenarios, where complex light interactions lead to
highly variable distributions of valid and invalid depth data. To address this,
we propose ReMake, a novel depth completion framework guided by an instance
mask and monocular depth estimation. By explicitly distinguishing transparent
regions from non-transparent ones, the mask enables the model to concentrate on
learning accurate depth estimation in these areas from RGB-D input during
training. This targeted supervision reduces reliance on implicit reasoning and
improves generalization to real-world scenarios. Additionally, monocular depth
estimation provides depth context between the transparent object and its
surroundings, enhancing depth prediction accuracy. Extensive experiments show
that our method outperforms existing approaches on both benchmark datasets and
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior accuracy and generalization
capability. Code and videos are available at

Conclusion: LMMs在视频参与度预测中具有潜力，音频特征对提升性能至关重要。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of user-generated content (UGC) on short-form video
platforms has made video engagement prediction increasingly important for
optimizing recommendation systems and guiding content creation. However, this
task remains challenging due to the complex interplay of factors such as
semantic content, visual quality, audio characteristics, and user background.
Prior studies have leveraged various types of features from different
modalities, such as visual quality, semantic content, background sound, etc.,
but often struggle to effectively model their cross-feature and cross-modality
interactions. In this work, we empirically investigate the potential of large
multimodal models (LMMs) for video engagement prediction. We adopt two
representative LMMs: VideoLLaMA2, which integrates audio, visual, and language
modalities, and Qwen2.5-VL, which models only visual and language modalities.
Specifically, VideoLLaMA2 jointly processes key video frames, text-based
metadata, and background sound, while Qwen2.5-VL utilizes only key video frames
and text-based metadata. Trained on the SnapUGC dataset, both models
demonstrate competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines,
showcasing the effectiveness of LMMs in engagement prediction. Notably,
VideoLLaMA2 consistently outperforms Qwen2.5-VL, highlighting the importance of
audio features in engagement prediction. By ensembling two types of models, our
method achieves first place in the ICCV VQualA 2025 EVQA-SnapUGC Challenge on
short-form video engagement prediction. The code is available at

Result: 简单图案影响小，复杂图案显著降低检测性能；恶意设计可故意隐藏行人或生成虚假检测。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了城市视觉监控系统的潜在漏洞，强调在设计鲁棒行人感知模型时需考虑环境视觉变化。

Abstract: Artistic crosswalks featuring asphalt art, introduced by different
organizations in recent years, aim to enhance the visibility and safety of
pedestrians. However, their visual complexity may interfere with surveillance
systems that rely on vision-based object detection models. In this study, we
investigate the impact of asphalt art on pedestrian detection performance of a
pretrained vision-based object detection model. We construct realistic
crosswalk scenarios by compositing various street art patterns into a fixed
surveillance scene and evaluate the model's performance in detecting
pedestrians on asphalt-arted crosswalks under both benign and adversarial
conditions. A benign case refers to pedestrian crosswalks painted with existing
normal asphalt art, whereas an adversarial case involves digitally crafted or
altered asphalt art perpetrated by an attacker. Our results show that while
simple, color-based designs have minimal effect, complex artistic patterns,
particularly those with high visual salience, can significantly degrade
pedestrian detection performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
adversarially crafted asphalt art can be exploited to deliberately obscure real
pedestrians or generate non-existent pedestrian detections. These findings
highlight a potential vulnerability in urban vision-based pedestrian
surveillance systems and underscore the importance of accounting for
environmental visual variations when designing robust pedestrian perception
models.

Method: 利用PAVC框架动态调整视频压缩级别，结合环境因素（天气和光照）优化带宽和检测精度。

Result: PAVC提升车辆检测精度13%，在中等带宽下减少带宽需求8.23倍，在极低带宽下减少72倍。

Conclusion: PAVC有效平衡带宽需求和检测精度，适用于不同带宽环境的ITS应用。

Abstract: Computer vision has become a popular tool in intelligent transportation
systems (ITS), enabling various applications through roadside traffic cameras
that capture video and transmit it in real time to computing devices within the
same network. The efficiency of this video transmission largely depends on the
available bandwidth of the communication system. However, limited bandwidth can
lead to communication bottlenecks, hindering the real-time performance of ITS
applications. To mitigate this issue, lossy video compression techniques can be
used to reduce bandwidth requirements, at the cost of degrading video quality.
This degradation can negatively impact the accuracy of applications that rely
on real-time vehicle detection. Additionally, vehicle detection accuracy is
influenced by environmental factors such as weather and lighting conditions,
suggesting that compression levels should be dynamically adjusted in response
to these variations. In this work, we utilize a framework called
Precision-Aware Video Compression (PAVC), where a roadside video camera
captures footage of vehicles on roadways, compresses videos, and then transmits
them to a processing unit, running a vehicle detection algorithm for
safety-critical applications, such as real-time collision risk assessment. The
system dynamically adjusts the video compression level based on current weather
and lighting conditions to maintain vehicle detection accuracy while minimizing
bandwidth usage. Our results demonstrate that PAVC improves vehicle detection
accuracy by up to 13% and reduces communication bandwidth requirements by up to
8.23x in areas with moderate bandwidth availability. Moreover, in locations
with severely limited bandwidth, PAVC reduces bandwidth requirements by up to
72x while preserving vehicle detection performance.

*Shuo Wang,Yongcai Wang,Wanting Li,Yucheng Wang,Maiyue Chen,Kaihui Wang,Zhizhong Su,Xudong Cai,Yeying Jin,Deying Li,Zhaoxin Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MonoDream提出了一种轻量级的视觉语言动作（VLA）框架，通过统一导航表示（UNR）和潜在全景梦境（LPD）任务，显著提升了单目视觉导航的性能，缩小了与全景RGB-D方法的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全景RGB-D传感器在实际部署中成本高或难以获取，而现有的单目视觉导航方法性能仍落后于全景方法。MonoDream旨在通过共享特征表示和潜在全景梦境任务，提升单目导航的可靠性。

Method: MonoDream通过UNR联合对齐导航相关的视觉语义（如全局布局、深度和未来线索）和语言驱动的动作意图，并通过LPD任务监督UNR，预测单目输入下的潜在全景RGB-D特征。

Result: 在多个VLN基准测试中，MonoDream显著提升了单目导航性能，缩小了与全景方法的差距。

Conclusion: MonoDream通过轻量级框架和潜在全景梦境任务，为单目视觉导航提供了一种高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks often leverage panoramic RGB and depth
inputs to provide rich spatial cues for action planning, but these sensors can
be costly or less accessible in real-world deployments. Recent approaches based
on Vision-Language Action (VLA) models achieve strong results with monocular
input, yet they still lag behind methods using panoramic RGB-D information. We
present MonoDream, a lightweight VLA framework that enables monocular agents to
learn a Unified Navigation Representation (UNR). This shared feature
representation jointly aligns navigation-relevant visual semantics (e.g.,
global layout, depth, and future cues) and language-grounded action intent,
enabling more reliable action prediction. MonoDream further introduces Latent
Panoramic Dreaming (LPD) tasks to supervise the UNR, which train the model to
predict latent features of panoramic RGB and depth observations at both current
and future steps based on only monocular input. Experiments on multiple VLN
benchmarks show that MonoDream consistently improves monocular navigation
performance and significantly narrows the gap with panoramic-based agents.

TL;DR: ReMoMask是一个统一的文本到动作生成框架，通过双向动量文本-动作模型、语义时空注意力机制和RAG-无分类器引导，解决了现有方法的多样性和物理合理性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到动作生成方法存在多样性不足、错误累积和物理不合理等问题，ReMoMask旨在通过创新技术解决这些挑战。

Method: 1) 双向动量文本-动作模型；2) 语义时空注意力机制；3) RAG-无分类器引导。基于MoMask的RVQ-VAE实现高效生成。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML基准测试中，FID分数分别提升3.88%和10.97%，优于之前的SOTA方法RAG-T2M。

Conclusion: ReMoMask通过技术创新显著提升了文本到动作生成的性能，成为当前最优方法。

Abstract: Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned human motion sequences from natural language descriptions. However,
current approaches face dual challenges: Generative models (e.g., diffusion
models) suffer from limited diversity, error accumulation, and physical
implausibility, while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods exhibit
diffusion inertia, partial-mode collapse, and asynchronous artifacts. To
address these limitations, we propose ReMoMask, a unified framework integrating
three key innovations: 1) A Bidirectional Momentum Text-Motion Model decouples
negative sample scale from batch size via momentum queues, substantially
improving cross-modal retrieval precision; 2) A Semantic Spatio-temporal
Attention mechanism enforces biomechanical constraints during part-level fusion
to eliminate asynchronous artifacts; 3) RAG-Classier-Free Guidance incorporates
minor unconditional generation to enhance generalization. Built upon MoMask's
RVQ-VAE, ReMoMask efficiently generates temporally coherent motions in minimal
steps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of ReMoMask, achieving a 3.88% and 10.97%
improvement in FID scores on HumanML3D and KIT-ML, respectively, compared to
the previous SOTA method RAG-T2M. Code:

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉问答（VQA）评估中的性能方差问题，并提出了改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在VQA基准测试中依赖点估计，忽略了性能方差的影响，如随机模型输出、训练种子敏感性和超参数配置。

Method: 通过分析14个VQA基准测试中的方差，研究了训练种子、框架非确定性、模型规模和指令微调对性能的影响，并探索了Cloze式评估的有效性。

Result: 研究发现当前评估方法存在局限性，性能方差显著影响结果。Cloze式评估能减少随机性并提高可靠性。

Conclusion: 论文主张采用方差感知的评估方法，以促进MLLMs更稳健和可靠的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
visual question answering (VQA), enabling reasoning and contextual
understanding across visual and textual modalities. Despite their advancements,
the evaluation of MLLMs on VQA benchmarks often relies on point estimates,
overlooking the significant variance in performance caused by factors such as
stochastic model outputs, training seed sensitivity, and hyperparameter
configurations. This paper critically examines these issues by analyzing
variance across 14 widely used VQA benchmarks, covering diverse tasks such as
visual reasoning, text understanding, and commonsense reasoning. We
systematically study the impact of training seed, framework non-determinism,
model scale, and extended instruction finetuning on performance variability.
Additionally, we explore Cloze-style evaluation as an alternate assessment
strategy, studying its effectiveness in reducing stochasticity and improving
reliability across benchmarks. Our findings highlight the limitations of
current evaluation practices and advocate for variance-aware methodologies to
foster more robust and reliable development of MLLMs.

TL;DR: PMGS通过3D高斯点云重建抛体运动，结合牛顿力学和姿态估计，显著提升了高速非线性刚体运动的动态重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大时空跨度复杂刚体运动建模的挑战，现有方法局限于短时小规模变形且物理一致性不足。

Method: 分两阶段：目标建模（动态场景分解与点密度控制）和运动恢复（学习每帧SE(3)姿态），引入加速度一致性约束和动态模拟退火策略。

Result: 实验表明PMGS在高速非线性刚体运动重建中优于主流动态方法。

Conclusion: PMGS通过物理约束和自适应优化策略，有效提升了动态重建的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modeling complex rigid motion across large spatiotemporal spans remains an
unresolved challenge in dynamic reconstruction. Existing paradigms are mainly
confined to short-term, small-scale deformation and offer limited consideration
for physical consistency. This study proposes PMGS, focusing on reconstructing
Projectile Motion via 3D Gaussian Splatting. The workflow comprises two stages:
1) Target Modeling: achieving object-centralized reconstruction through dynamic
scene decomposition and an improved point density control; 2) Motion Recovery:
restoring full motion sequences by learning per-frame SE(3) poses. We introduce
an acceleration consistency constraint to bridge Newtonian mechanics and pose
estimation, and design a dynamic simulated annealing strategy that adaptively
schedules learning rates based on motion states. Futhermore, we devise a Kalman
fusion scheme to optimize error accumulation from multi-source observations to
mitigate disturbances. Experiments show PMGS's superior performance in
reconstructing high-speed nonlinear rigid motion compared to mainstream dynamic
methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MedVLThinker，一个开放且可复现的医学推理模型构建方法，通过数据筛选和两种训练范式（SFT和RLVR），发现RLVR优于SFT，且纯文本数据训练效果优于多模态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学领域缺乏开放、可复现的推理模型构建方法的问题，推动社区研究和比较。

Method: 1. 数据筛选（文本和多模态医学数据）；2. 两种训练范式：SFT和RLVR。

Result: RLVR显著优于SFT，纯文本数据训练效果更好，7B模型在公开VQA基准上达到SOTA，32B模型性能接近GPT-4o。

Conclusion: MedVLThinker为医学多模态推理研究提供了开放、强大的基础，RLVR和纯文本数据训练是关键。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have introduced a new paradigm in AI by
enabling models to ``think before responding" via chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the absence of open and reproducible recipes for building
reasoning-centric medical LMMs hinders community-wide research, analysis, and
comparison. In this paper, we present MedVLThinker, a suite of simple yet
strong baselines. Our fully open recipe consists of: (1) systematic data
curation for both text-only and image-text medical data, filtered according to
varying levels of reasoning difficulty, and (2) two training paradigms:
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on distilled reasoning traces and Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) based on final answer correctness.
Across extensive experiments on the Qwen2.5-VL model family (3B, 7B) and six
medical QA benchmarks, we find that RLVR consistently and significantly
outperforms SFT. Additionally, under the RLVR framework, a key,
counter-intuitive finding is that training on our curated text-only reasoning
data provides a more substantial performance boost than training on multimodal
image-text data. Our best open 7B model, trained using the RLVR recipe on
text-only data, establishes a new state-of-the-art on existing public VQA
benchmarks, surpassing all previous open-source medical LMMs. Furthermore,
scaling our model to 32B achieves performance on par with the proprietary
GPT-4o. We release all curated data, models, and code to provide the community
with a strong, open foundation for future research in multimodal medical
reasoning.

Motivation: 现有提示调优方法依赖外部知识，成本高且忽视图像模态特征，AugPT旨在利用内部数据增强解决这一问题。

Method: AugPT通过自监督增强未标记图像，并引入共识测试门控机制过滤噪声样本，提升增强视图质量。

Result: 实验表明AugPT在不使用外部知识的情况下，显著提升了模型性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: AugPT为提示调优提供了一种高效、自给自足的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: For CLIP-based prompt tuning, introducing more data as additional knowledge
for enhancing fine-tuning process is proved to be an effective approach.
Existing data amplification strategies for prompt tuning typically rely on
external knowledge (e.g., large language models or pre-structured knowledge
bases), resulting in higher costs for data collection and processing, while
generally ignoring further utilization of features in image modality. To
address this, we propose Augmentation-driven Prompt Tuning (AugPT), a
self-contained distillation-based prompt tuning approach using only internal
augmentation on raw dataset to better exploit known features. Specifically,
AugPT employs self-supervised augmentation on unlabeled images in the training
set, and introduces a novel gating mechanism based on consensus test, reusing
the pre-trained prompt tuning backbone model to spontaneously filter noisy
samples, further enhancing the quality of augmented views. Extensive
experiments validate that AugPT simultaneously enhances model performance and
generalization capability without using appended external knowledge. The code
of AugPT is available at: https://github.com/JREion/AugPT .

TL;DR: ChEmbed是一种针对化学文献检索优化的文本嵌入模型，显著提升了检索质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用文本嵌入模型难以准确表示复杂化学术语，导致化学文献检索效果不佳，需要专门优化的嵌入模型。

Method: 开发ChEmbed模型，通过化学专用数据集（PubChem、Semantic Scholar、ChemRxiv）微调，并利用大语言模型生成合成查询数据。增加900个化学专用令牌以减少化学实体碎片化，并支持8192令牌的上下文长度。

Result: 在ChemRxiv Retrieval基准测试中，ChEmbed的nDCG@10从0.82提升至0.91（+9 pp），优于现有通用嵌入模型。

Conclusion: ChEmbed是一种轻量、可复现的解决方案，显著提升了化学文献检索的效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in chemistry heavily depend on
accurate and relevant retrieval of chemical literature. However,
general-purpose text embedding models frequently fail to adequately represent
complex chemical terminologies, resulting in suboptimal retrieval quality.
Specialized embedding models tailored to chemical literature retrieval have not
yet been developed, leaving a substantial performance gap. To address this
challenge, we introduce ChEmbed, a domain-adapted family of text embedding
models fine-tuned on a dataset comprising chemistry-specific text from the
PubChem, Semantic Scholar, and ChemRxiv corpora. To create effective training
data, we employ large language models to synthetically generate queries,
resulting in approximately 1.7 million high-quality query-passage pairs.
Additionally, we augment the tokenizer by adding 900 chemically specialized
tokens to previously unused slots, which significantly reduces the
fragmentation of chemical entities, such as IUPAC names. ChEmbed also maintains
a 8192-token context length, enabling the efficient retrieval of longer
passages compared to many other open-source embedding models, which typically
have a context length of 512 or 2048 tokens. Evaluated on our newly introduced
ChemRxiv Retrieval benchmark, ChEmbed outperforms state-of-the-art general
embedding models, raising nDCG@10 from 0.82 to 0.91 (+9 pp). ChEmbed represents
a practical, lightweight, and reproducible embedding solution that effectively
improves retrieval for chemical literature search.

*Surej Mouli,Ramaswamy Palaniappan*

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 研究探讨了高占空比视觉刺激对减轻SSVEP应用中视觉疲劳的影响，发现85%占空比能显著减少疲劳并提高响应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SSVEP在脑机接口等应用中具有高信息传输率，但传统闪烁刺激易导致视觉疲劳和精度问题，限制了其长期使用。

Method: 通过定制LED硬件生成50%至95%占空比的PWM刺激，记录十名受试者的脑电图数据，分析不同占空比对视觉疲劳和SSVEP响应的影响。

Result: 高占空比（尤其是85%）显著减少视觉疲劳，且SSVEP响应性能达到峰值。

Conclusion: 85%占空比的视觉刺激可有效解决SSVEP应用中的疲劳和精度问题，推动其实际应用。

Abstract: Steady state visual evoked response (SSVEP) is widely used in visual-based
diagnosis and applications such as brain computer interfacing due to its high
information transfer rate and the capability to activate commands through
simple gaze control. However, one major impediment in using flashing visual
stimulus to obtain SSVEP is eye fatigue that prevents continued long term use
preventing practical deployment. This combined with the difficulty in
establishing precise pulse-width modulation (PWM) that results in poorer
accuracy warrants the development of appropriate approach to solve these
issues. Various studies have suggested the usage of high frequencies of visual
stimulus to reduce the visual fatigue for the user but this results in poor
response performance. Here, the authors study the use of extremely high
duty-cycles in the stimulus in the hope of solving these constraints.
Electroencephalogram data was recorded with PWM duty-cycles of 50 to 95%
generated by a precise custom-made light-emitting diode hardware and tested ten
subjects responded that increasing duty-cycles had less visual strain for all
the frequency values and the SSVEP exhibited a subject-independent peak
response for duty-cycle of 85%. This could pave the way for increased usage of
SSVEP for practical applications.

Motivation: 传统聚类方法难以处理高维、异构的医疗数据，且缺乏上下文理解能力，因此研究探索了LLM在聚类中的潜力。

Method: 使用LLM（如LLAMA 3.1 8B、DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B和Stella-En-400M-V5）生成嵌入，并应用K-means聚类，与传统方法（如K-Medoids）对比。

Result: Stella-En-400M-V5获得最高轮廓分数（0.86），LLM方法在识别营养、临床和社会经济特征方面表现更优。

Conclusion: LLM在资源有限的环境中具有潜力，可用于上下文表型分析和决策支持。

Abstract: Clustering patient subgroups is essential for personalized care and efficient
resource use. Traditional clustering methods struggle with high-dimensional,
heterogeneous healthcare data and lack contextual understanding. This study
evaluates Large Language Model (LLM) based clustering against classical methods
using a pediatric sepsis dataset from a low-income country (LIC), containing
2,686 records with 28 numerical and 119 categorical variables. Patient records
were serialized into text with and without a clustering objective. Embeddings
were generated using quantized LLAMA 3.1 8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B with
low-rank adaptation(LoRA), and Stella-En-400M-V5 models. K-means clustering was
applied to these embeddings. Classical comparisons included K-Medoids
clustering on UMAP and FAMD-reduced mixed data. Silhouette scores and
statistical tests evaluated cluster quality and distinctiveness.
Stella-En-400M-V5 achieved the highest Silhouette Score (0.86). LLAMA 3.1 8B
with the clustering objective performed better with higher number of clusters,
identifying subgroups with distinct nutritional, clinical, and socioeconomic
profiles. LLM-based methods outperformed classical techniques by capturing
richer context and prioritizing key features. These results highlight potential
of LLMs for contextual phenotyping and informed decision-making in

Result: 模型在训练时间减少94.4%、参数减少89.0%的情况下，预测精度提升28%，计算速度提升100-200倍。在多个物理系统中表现优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 点扩散模型在高效性和准确性上均优于传统方法，适用于实时预测应用，并能灵活处理多种数据格式。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel point-wise diffusion model that processes
spatio-temporal points independently to efficiently predict complex physical
systems with shape variations. This methodological contribution lies in
applying forward and backward diffusion processes at individual spatio-temporal
points, coupled with a point-wise diffusion transformer architecture for
denoising. Unlike conventional image-based diffusion models that operate on
structured data representations, this framework enables direct processing of
any data formats including meshes and point clouds while preserving geometric
fidelity. We validate our approach across three distinct physical domains with
complex geometric configurations: 2D spatio-temporal systems including cylinder
fluid flow and OLED drop impact test, and 3D large-scale system for road-car
external aerodynamics. To justify the necessity of our point-wise approach for
real-time prediction applications, we employ denoising diffusion implicit
models (DDIM) for efficient deterministic sampling, requiring only 5-10 steps
compared to traditional 1000-step and providing computational speedup of 100 to
200 times during inference without compromising accuracy. In addition, our
proposed model achieves superior performance compared to image-based diffusion
model: reducing training time by 94.4% and requiring 89.0% fewer parameters
while achieving over 28% improvement in prediction accuracy. Comprehensive
comparisons against data-flexible surrogate models including DeepONet and
Meshgraphnet demonstrate consistent superiority of our approach across all
three physical systems. To further refine the proposed model, we investigate
two key aspects: 1) comparison of final physical states prediction or
incremental change prediction, and 2) computational efficiency evaluation
across varying subsampling ratios (10%-100%).

TL;DR: Cyber-Zero是一个无需运行时的框架，通过合成高质量代理轨迹训练网络安全LLM，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在软件工程任务中依赖运行时环境，但网络安全领域缺乏此类环境，Cyber-Zero旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用公开的CTF writeups和角色驱动的LLM模拟，逆向工程运行时行为，生成真实交互序列。

Result: Cyber-Zero训练的LLM在三个CTF基准测试中性能提升13.1%，达到开源模型最佳水平。

Conclusion: Cyber-Zero证明了无需运行时轨迹合成的有效性，为开发高性能网络安全代理提供了低成本方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in software
engineering tasks when trained with executable runtime environments,
particularly in resolving GitHub issues. However, such runtime environments are
often unavailable in other domains, especially cybersecurity, where challenge
configurations and execution contexts are ephemeral or restricted. We present
Cyber-Zero, the first runtime-free framework for synthesizing high-quality
agent trajectories to train cybersecurity LLMs. Cyber-Zero leverages publicly
available CTF writeups and employs persona-driven LLM simulation to
reverse-engineer runtime behaviors and generate realistic, long-horizon
interaction sequences without actual environments. Using trajectories
synthesized by Cyber-Zero, we train LLM-based agents that achieve up to 13.1%
absolute performance gains over baseline models on three prominent CTF
benchmarks: InterCode-CTF, NYU CTF Bench, and Cybench. Our best model,
Cyber-Zero-32B, establishes new state-of-the-art performance among open-weight
models, matching the capabilities of proprietary systems like DeepSeek-V3-0324
and Claude-3.5-Sonnet while offering superior cost-effectiveness, and
demonstrating that runtime-free trajectory synthesis can effectively
democratize the development of state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理的动态和非透明行为带来了安全风险，尤其是在提示注入攻击下，需要一种方法来分析和约束其行为。

Method: 提出AgentArmor框架，将代理痕迹转换为图中间表示（如CFG、DFG、PDG），并通过类型系统进行静态推断和检查。

Result: 在AgentDojo基准测试中，AgentArmor实现了95.75%的真阳性率和3.66%的假阳性率。

Conclusion: AgentArmor能够有效检测提示注入漏洞并强制执行细粒度安全约束。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving
various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of
external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces
critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection
attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime
traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present
AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph
intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations
(e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system.
AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that
reconstructs the agent's working traces as graph-based intermediate
representations with control flow and data flow described within; (2) a
property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools
& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over
the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured
programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis over sensitive data flow, trust
boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo
benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can achieve 95.75% of TPR, with
only 3.66% of FPR. Our results demonstrate AgentArmor's ability to detect
prompt injection vulnerabilities and enforce fine-grained security constraints.

Result: 实验显示ConfGuard在大多数情况下接近100%的TPR和极低FPR，且几乎无额外延迟。

Conclusion: ConfGuard是一种轻量高效的实时后门防御方法，适用于实际LLM部署。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to Large Language Models (LLMs),
where adversaries can embed hidden triggers to manipulate LLM's outputs. Most
existing defense methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, are
ineffective against the autoregressive nature and vast output space of LLMs,
thereby suffering from poor performance and high latency. To address these
limitations, we investigate the behavioral discrepancies between benign and
backdoored LLMs in output space. We identify a critical phenomenon which we
term sequence lock: a backdoored model generates the target sequence with
abnormally high and consistent confidence compared to benign generation.
Building on this insight, we propose ConfGuard, a lightweight and effective
detection method that monitors a sliding window of token confidences to
identify sequence lock. Extensive experiments demonstrate ConfGuard achieves a
near 100\% true positive rate (TPR) and a negligible false positive rate (FPR)
in the vast majority of cases. Crucially, the ConfGuard enables real-time
detection almost without additional latency, making it a practical backdoor
defense for real-world LLM deployments.

*Man Hu,Yahui Ding,Yatao Yang,Liangyu Chen,Yanhao Jia,Shuai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: DUP是一个统一的框架，结合了后门检测和基于遗忘的净化，通过细粒度分析和参数高效机制提升防御性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前防御策略对隐蔽且鲁棒的后门攻击存在缺陷，检测方法依赖粗粒度特征统计，净化方法需完全重新训练或额外干净模型。

Method: DUP利用类无关距离和层间转换捕获特征异常，通过加权方案识别污染输入，并采用知识蒸馏指导学生模型遗忘后门行为。

Result: 在多种攻击方法和语言模型架构上，DUP在检测准确性和净化效果上表现优异。

Conclusion: DUP提供了一种高效的后门防御解决方案，无需完全重新训练或外部干净模型。

Abstract: As backdoor attacks become more stealthy and robust, they reveal critical
weaknesses in current defense strategies: detection methods often rely on
coarse-grained feature statistics, and purification methods typically require
full retraining or additional clean models. To address these challenges, we
propose DUP (Detection-guided Unlearning for Purification), a unified framework
that integrates backdoor detection with unlearning-based purification. The
detector captures feature-level anomalies by jointly leveraging class-agnostic
distances and inter-layer transitions. These deviations are integrated through
a weighted scheme to identify poisoned inputs, enabling more fine-grained
analysis. Based on the detection results, we purify the model through a
parameter-efficient unlearning mechanism that avoids full retraining and does
not require any external clean model. Specifically, we innovatively repurpose
knowledge distillation to guide the student model toward increasing its output
divergence from the teacher on detected poisoned samples, effectively forcing
it to unlearn the backdoor behavior. Extensive experiments across diverse
attack methods and language model architectures demonstrate that DUP achieves
superior defense performance in detection accuracy and purification efficacy.

*Aldan Creo*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PDFuzz是一种新型攻击方法，通过操纵PDF文档中字符的视觉布局和提取顺序，完全规避了AI生成文本检测器，揭示了当前检测系统的漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI生成文本检测器的鲁棒性，发现其在面对视觉布局与提取顺序不一致的PDF文档时存在漏洞。

Method: 提出PDFuzz攻击方法，通过调整字符位置扰乱文本提取顺序，同时保持文本内容的视觉保真度。

Result: 攻击后，检测器性能从93.6%准确率和0.938 F1分数降至随机水平（50.4%准确率，0.0 F1分数）。

Conclusion: 当前检测系统对PDF文档结构的依赖性使其容易受到攻击，亟需更强大的防护措施。

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have become essential tools for maintaining
content authenticity, yet their robustness against evasion attacks remains
questionable. We present PDFuzz, a novel attack that exploits the discrepancy
between visual text layout and extraction order in PDF documents. Our method
preserves exact textual content while manipulating character positioning to
scramble extraction sequences. We evaluate this approach against the ArguGPT
detector using a dataset of human and AI-generated text. Our results
demonstrate complete evasion: detector performance drops from (93.6 $\pm$ 1.4)
% accuracy and 0.938 $\pm$ 0.014 F1 score to random-level performance ((50.4
$\pm$ 3.2) % accuracy, 0.0 F1 score) while maintaining perfect visual fidelity.
Our work reveals a vulnerability in current detection systems that is inherent
to PDF document structures and underscores the need for implementing sturdy
safeguards against such attacks. We make our code publicly available at
https://github.com/ACMCMC/PDFuzz.

*Kamal Al-Sabahi,Yousuf Khamis Al Mabsali*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于区块链和SSI的去中心化框架，以解决学术出版中的伦理问题，如作者身份模糊和利益冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础设施（如ORCID）在确保作者明确同意、验证贡献者角色和检测利益冲突方面存在不足。

Method: 利用DIDs和VCs验证作者身份和贡献，区块链记录作者同意和同行评审活动，ZKPs保护隐私检测利益冲突。

Result: 框架提高了学术出版的伦理合规性和透明度，调查显示研究者、编辑和审稿人对该框架的认可。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建更透明、可信的学术出版生态系统迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Academic publishing, integral to knowledge dissemination and scientific
advancement, increasingly faces threats from unethical practices such as
unconsented authorship, gift authorship, author ambiguity, and undisclosed
conflicts of interest. While existing infrastructures like ORCID effectively
disambiguate researcher identities, they fall short in enforcing explicit
authorship consent, accurately verifying contributor roles, and robustly
detecting conflicts of interest during peer review. To address these
shortcomings, this paper introduces a decentralized framework leveraging
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and blockchain technology. The proposed model
uses Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to
securely verify author identities and contributions, reducing ambiguity and
ensuring accurate attribution. A blockchain-based trust registry records
authorship consent and peer-review activity immutably. Privacy-preserving
cryptographic techniques, especially Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), support
conflict-of-interest detection without revealing sensitive data. Verified
authorship metadata and consent records are embedded in publications,
increasing transparency. A stakeholder survey of researchers, editors, and
reviewers suggests the framework improves ethical compliance and confidence in
scholarly communication. This work represents a step toward a more transparent,
accountable, and trustworthy academic publishing ecosystem.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: CP-FREEZER是一种针对协同感知（CP）系统的延迟攻击，通过V2V消息注入对抗性扰动，显著增加计算延迟，威胁CP系统的可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CP系统在及时性（或可用性）攻击下的鲁棒性，填补现有研究中对安全性关键需求的空白。

Method: 提出CP-FREEZER攻击，解决点云预处理不可微、传输延迟导致的输入异步等挑战，采用新型损失函数最大化CP流程执行时间。

Result: 攻击成功将端到端CP延迟提升90倍以上，单帧处理时间超过3秒，成功率100%。

Conclusion: CP-FREEZER揭示了CP系统可用性的严重威胁，亟需开发鲁棒防御机制。

Abstract: Cooperative perception (CP) enhances situational awareness of connected and
autonomous vehicles by exchanging and combining messages from multiple agents.
While prior work has explored adversarial integrity attacks that degrade
perceptual accuracy, little is known about CP's robustness against attacks on
timeliness (or availability), a safety-critical requirement for autonomous
driving. In this paper, we present CP-FREEZER, the first latency attack that
maximizes the computation delay of CP algorithms by injecting adversarial
perturbation via V2V messages. Our attack resolves several unique challenges,
including the non-differentiability of point cloud preprocessing, asynchronous
knowledge of the victim's input due to transmission delays, and uses a novel
loss function that effectively maximizes the execution time of the CP pipeline.
Extensive experiments show that CP-FREEZER increases end-to-end CP latency by
over $90\times$, pushing per-frame processing time beyond 3 seconds with a 100%
success rate on our real-world vehicle testbed. Our findings reveal a critical
threat to the availability of CP systems, highlighting the urgent need for
robust defenses.

Main category: cs.DL

TL;DR: 论文分析了LLM在回答查询时未充分引用网页内容的问题，提出了“归因缺口”概念，并通过实验数据展示了不同模型的引用行为差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示LLM在回答问题时未充分引用来源的现象，探讨其对信息生态系统的影响。

Method: 通过分析约14,000条LMArena对话日志，比较不同LLM模型的引用行为，并使用负二项式障碍模型量化归因缺口。

Result: 结果显示，不同模型的引用行为差异显著：Gemini和Sonar平均每查询遗漏3个相关网页，而GPT-4o的归因缺口较小。引用效率因模型设计而异。

Conclusion: 建议采用透明的LLM搜索架构，包括标准化遥测和完整披露搜索痕迹与引用日志，以减少归因缺口。

Abstract: Web-enabled LLMs frequently answer queries without crediting the web pages
they consume, creating an "attribution gap" - the difference between relevant
URLs read and those actually cited. Drawing on approximately 14,000 real-world
LMArena conversation logs with search-enabled LLM systems, we document three
exploitation patterns: 1) No Search: 34% of Google Gemini and 24% of OpenAI
GPT-4o responses are generated without explicitly fetching any online content;
2) No citation: Gemini provides no clickable citation source in 92% of answers;
3) High-volume, low-credit: Perplexity's Sonar visits approximately 10 relevant
pages per query but cites only three to four. A negative binomial hurdle model
shows that the average query answered by Gemini or Sonar leaves about 3
relevant websites uncited, whereas GPT-4o's tiny uncited gap is best explained
by its selective log disclosures rather than by better attribution. Citation
efficiency - extra citations provided per additional relevant web page visited
- varies widely across models, from 0.19 to 0.45 on identical queries,
underscoring that retrieval design, not technical limits, shapes ecosystem
impact. We recommend a transparent LLM search architecture based on
standardized telemetry and full disclosure of search traces and citation logs.

Motivation: 传统量化方法未关注对话在人力资本中的核心作用，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用对话可视化技术量化发言量，分析性别、职位等属性的差异，以及发言量与连续属性的相关性。

Result: 通过中小企业周会数据验证了方法的有效性，展示了发言量的差异和相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为人力资本的可视化提供了新方法，强调了对话分析的重要性。

Abstract: In recent years, many companies have recognized the importance of human
resources and are investing in human capital to revitalize their organizations
and enhance internal communication, thereby fostering innovation. However,
conventional quantification methods have mainly focused on readily measurable
indicators without addressing the fundamental role of conversations in human
capital. This study focuses on routine meetings and proposes strategies to
visualize human capital by analyzing speech amount during these meetings. We
employ conversation visualization technology, which operates effectively, to
quantify speech. We then measure differences in speech amount by attributes
such as gender and job post, changes in speech amount depending on whether
certain participants are present, and correlations between speech amount and
continuous attributes. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we
analyzed speech amounts by departmental affiliation during weekly meetings at
small to medium enterprises.

Motivation: 尽管对话推荐系统支持任务导向和探索性交互，但用户偏好的影响因素尚未充分研究。

Method: 采用被试内设计（N=139），参与者体验两种脚本化CRS对话，评估体验并评价八种系统质量的重要性，使用逻辑回归和聚类分析。

Result: 探索性交互偏好由享受、有用性、新颖性和对话质量预测，聚类分析揭示五种用户画像，年龄、性别和控制偏好显著影响选择。

Conclusion: 研究整合了情感、认知和特质层面的预测因子，为CRS用户建模和自适应对话设计提供了框架。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) deliver personalised
recommendations through multi-turn natural language dialogue and increasingly
support both task-oriented and exploratory interactions. Yet, the factors
shaping user interaction preferences remain underexplored. In this
within-subjects study (\(N = 139\)), participants experienced two scripted CRS
dialogues, rated their experiences, and indicated the importance of eight
system qualities. Logistic regression revealed that preference for the
exploratory interaction was predicted by enjoyment, usefulness, novelty, and
conversational quality. Unexpectedly, perceived effectiveness was also
associated with exploratory preference. Clustering uncovered five latent user
profiles with distinct dialogue style preferences. Moderation analyses
indicated that age, gender, and control preference significantly influenced
these choices. These findings integrate affective, cognitive, and trait-level
predictors into CRS user modelling and inform autonomy-sensitive,
value-adaptive dialogue design. The proposed predictive and adaptive framework
applies broadly to conversational AI systems seeking to align dynamically with
evolving user needs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了六条设计准则，旨在帮助设计师优化自动化系统的信任度评估，促进伦理和负责任的人机交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保用户对系统信任度的感知与其实际信任度一致，从而做出明智的依赖决策。

Method: 结合人机交互、认知心理学、自动化研究、用户体验设计和伦理学等领域的文献，并引入语用学中的共同基础和格莱斯沟通准则。

Result: 提出了六条设计准则，帮助设计师创建能提供相关信任度线索的自动化系统。

Conclusion: 这些准则有助于培养校准信任，提升人机交互的满意度、生产力和安全性，同时可作为评估现有系统的工具。

Abstract: Calibrated trust in automated systems (Lee and See 2004) is critical for
their safe and seamless integration into society. Users should only rely on a
system recommendation when it is actually correct and reject it when it is
factually wrong. One requirement to achieve this goal is an accurate
trustworthiness assessment, ensuring that the user's perception of the system's
trustworthiness aligns with its actual trustworthiness, allowing users to make
informed decisions about the extent to which they can rely on the system
(Schlicker et al. 2022). We propose six design guidelines to help designers
optimize for accurate trustworthiness assessments, thus fostering ethical and
responsible human-automation interactions. The proposed guidelines are derived
from existing literature in various fields, such as human-computer interaction,
cognitive psychology, automation research, user-experience design, and ethics.
We are incorporating key principles from the field of pragmatics, specifically
the cultivation of common ground (H. H. Clark 1996) and Gricean communication
maxims (Grice 1975). These principles are essential for the design of automated
systems because the user's perception of the system's trustworthiness is shaped
by both environmental contexts, such as organizational culture or societal
norms, and by situational context, including the specific circumstances or
scenarios in which the interaction occurs (Hoff and Bashir 2015). Our proposed
guidelines provide actionable insights for designers to create automated
systems that make relevant trustworthiness cues available. This would ideally
foster calibrated trust and more satisfactory, productive, and safe
interactions between humans and automated systems. Furthermore, the proposed
heuristics might work as a tool for evaluating to what extent existing systems
enable users to accurately assess a system's trustworthiness.

We introduce AIAP, a no-code platform that integrates natural language input

decompose ambiguous user instructions into modular, actionable steps, hidden
from users behind a unified interface. A user study involving 32 participants
showed that AIAP's AI-generated suggestions, modular workflows, and automatic
identification of data, actions, and context significantly improved
participants' ability to develop services intuitively. These findings highlight
that natural language-based visual programming significantly reduces barriers

TL;DR: VibeMesh是一种新型可穿戴系统，结合视觉和主动声学传感，用于高精度的手部姿势和接触估计，解决了视觉遮挡和触觉传感不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计手部姿势和手-物体接触事件对机器人数据收集、虚拟现实和生物力学分析至关重要，但现有方法因视觉遮挡、触觉传感限制等问题难以实现。

Method: VibeMesh集成骨传导扬声器和稀疏压电麦克风，通过结构化声学信号传播推断接触变化，并利用基于图的注意力网络处理同步音频频谱和RGB-D手部网格数据。

Result: VibeMesh在遮挡或静态接触场景中优于仅依赖视觉的基线方法，表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VibeMesh提供了一种轻量级、非侵入式的多模态传感解决方案，显著提升了手部姿势和接触估计的性能。

Abstract: Accurately estimating hand pose and hand-object contact events is essential
for robot data-collection, immersive virtual environments, and biomechanical
analysis, yet remains challenging due to visual occlusion, subtle contact cues,
limitations in vision-only sensing, and the lack of accessible and flexible
tactile sensing. We therefore introduce VibeMesh, a novel wearable system that
fuses vision with active acoustic sensing for dense, per-vertex hand contact
and pose estimation. VibeMesh integrates a bone-conduction speaker and sparse
piezoelectric microphones, distributed on a human hand, emitting structured
acoustic signals and capturing their propagation to infer changes induced by
contact. To interpret these cross-modal signals, we propose a graph-based
attention network that processes synchronized audio spectra and RGB-D-derived
hand meshes to predict contact with high spatial resolution. We contribute: (i)
a lightweight, non-intrusive visuo-acoustic sensing platform; (ii) a
cross-modal graph network for joint pose and contact inference; (iii) a dataset
of synchronized RGB-D, acoustic, and ground-truth contact annotations across
diverse manipulation scenarios; and (iv) empirical results showing that
VibeMesh outperforms vision-only baselines in accuracy and robustness,
particularly in occluded or static-contact settings.

Motivation: AR中虚拟物体缺乏物理性导致声音交互不自然，影响多感官体验和交互真实感。

Method: 利用计算机视觉识别和分割真实物体的材料，结合物理属性和碰撞动态，通过物理建模合成实时材料声音。

Result: 用户研究表明，材料声音显著提升了声音交互的真实感和材料辨识的准确性。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的材料声音增强了AR的交互真实感和对现实环境的感知。

Abstract: In Augmented Reality (AR), virtual objects interact with real objects.
However, the lack of physicality of virtual objects leads to the absence of
natural sonic interactions. When virtual and real objects collide, either no
sound or a generic sound is played. Both lead to an incongruent multisensory
experience, reducing interaction and object realism. Unlike in Virtual Reality
(VR) and games, where predefined scenes and interactions allow for the playback
of pre-recorded sound samples, AR requires real-time sound synthesis that
dynamically adapts to novel contexts and objects to provide audiovisual
congruence during interaction. To enhance real-virtual object interactions in
AR, we propose a framework for context-aware sounds using methods from computer
vision to recognize and segment the materials of real objects. The material's
physical properties and the impact dynamics of the interaction are used to
generate material-based sounds in real-time using physical modelling synthesis.
In a user study with 24 participants, we compared our congruent material-based
sounds to a generic sound effect, mirroring the current standard of
non-context-aware sounds in AR applications. The results showed that
material-based sounds led to significantly more realistic sonic interactions.
Material-based sounds also enabled participants to distinguish visually similar
materials with significantly greater accuracy and confidence. These findings
show that context-aware, material-based sonic interactions in AR foster a
stronger sense of realism and enhance our perception of real-world
surroundings.

Method: 提出了首个公开的EEG和眼动追踪数据集，用户自主决定搜索时间，并开发了跨用户预测方法。

Result: 跨用户预测准确率达到84.5%，接近用户内预测准确率（85.5%），但灵活性更高。

Conclusion: 该方法在区分搜索意图方面具有更高的实用性和灵活性，适用于真实场景。

Abstract: For machines to effectively assist humans in challenging visual search tasks,
they must differentiate whether a human is simply glancing into a scene
(navigational intent) or searching for a target object (informational intent).
Previous research proposed combining electroencephalography (EEG) and
eye-tracking measurements to recognize such search intents implicitly, i.e.,
without explicit user input. However, the applicability of these approaches to
real-world scenarios suffers from two key limitations. First, previous work
used fixed search times in the informational intent condition -- a stark
contrast to visual search, which naturally terminates when the target is found.
Second, methods incorporating EEG measurements addressed prediction scenarios
that require ground truth training data from the target user, which is
impractical in many use cases. We address these limitations by making the first
publicly available EEG and eye-tracking dataset for navigational vs.
informational intent recognition, where the user determines search times. We
present the first method for cross-user prediction of search intents from EEG
and eye-tracking recordings and reach 84.5% accuracy in leave-one-user-out
evaluations -- comparable to within-user prediction accuracy (85.5%) but
offering much greater flexibility

Motivation: 医疗领域中的公平性问题亟待解决，而现有的联邦学习方法在医疗数据上表现不佳且忽视公平性。

Method: 提出了FairLoRA框架，基于SVD低秩近似，为不同人口群体定制奇异值矩阵，同时共享奇异向量。

Result: 实验表明FairLoRA在医疗图像分类中表现优异，并显著提升了公平性。

Conclusion: FairLoRA和FairFedMed数据集为医疗FL的公平性研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Fairness remains a critical concern in healthcare, where unequal access to
services and treatment outcomes can adversely affect patient health. While
Federated Learning (FL) presents a collaborative and privacy-preserving
approach to model training, ensuring fairness is challenging due to
heterogeneous data across institutions, and current research primarily
addresses non-medical applications. To fill this gap, we establish the first
experimental benchmark for fairness in medical FL, evaluating six
representative FL methods across diverse demographic attributes and imaging
modalities. We introduce FairFedMed, the first medical FL dataset specifically
designed to study group fairness (i.e., demographics). It comprises two parts:
FairFedMed-Oph, featuring 2D fundus and 3D OCT ophthalmology samples with six
demographic attributes; and FairFedMed-Chest, which simulates real
cross-institutional FL using subsets of CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR. Together, they
support both simulated and real-world FL across diverse medical modalities and
demographic groups. Existing FL models often underperform on medical images and
overlook fairness across demographic groups. To address this, we propose
FairLoRA, a fairness-aware FL framework based on SVD-based low-rank
approximation. It customizes singular value matrices per demographic group
while sharing singular vectors, ensuring both fairness and efficiency.
Experimental results on the FairFedMed dataset demonstrate that FairLoRA not
only achieves state-of-the-art performance in medical image classification but
also significantly improves fairness across diverse populations. Our code and
dataset can be accessible via link: https://wang.hms.harvard.edu/fairfedmed/.

Result: 开源预训练MVTS插补模型的平均幻觉水平为59.5%，缓解方法可减少47.7%。

Conclusion: 新定义与方法有助于提升MVTS基础模型的安全性与应用前景。

Abstract: Foundation models for natural language processing have many coherent
definitions of hallucination and methods for its detection and mitigation.
However, analogous definitions and methods do not exist for multi-variate
time-series (MVTS) foundation models. We propose new definitions for MVTS
hallucination, along with new detection and mitigation methods using a
diffusion model to estimate hallucination levels. We derive relational datasets
from popular time-series datasets to benchmark these relational hallucination
levels. Using these definitions and models, we find that open-source
pre-trained MVTS imputation foundation models relationally hallucinate on
average up to 59.5% as much as a weak baseline. The proposed mitigation method
reduces this by up to 47.7% for these models. The definition and methods may
improve adoption and safe usage of MVTS foundation models.

Motivation: 现有研究对Transformer如何存储和提取知识的理论理解不足，且多局限于单层注意力架构，忽略了MLP的作用。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入了一种结合自注意力和MLP的单层Transformer框架，通过梯度动态分析，证明了其在知识获取和提取上的有效性。

Result: 证明Transformer在预训练中能实现接近最优的训练损失（知识获取）；在特定条件下，微调后能成功提取知识；否则会出现幻觉。

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer的知识获取和提取提供了理论支持，并通过实验验证了结果，揭示了学习率调度等经验现象的理论依据。

Abstract: Modern large language models excel in knowledge-intensive tasks, yet how
transformers acquire (store) knowledge during pre-training and extract
(retrieve) it during post-fine-tuning inference remains theoretically opaque.
While prior theoretical work has begun to investigate these questions through
the analysis of training dynamics, such studies are limited to single-layer,
attention-only architectures. However, most existing studies suggest that MLPs
are the most contributing components for storing knowledge in transformer-based
language models. Meanwhile, our empirical investigations reveal that such
simplified models, when trained using standard next-token prediction
objectives, may be incapable of acquiring or extracting factual knowledge. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce a tractable one-layer transformer
framework that crucially incorporates both self-attention and MLP modules. By
tracking its gradient dynamics, we establish convergence and generalization
guarantees that illuminate the ability of knowledge acquisition and extraction.
We prove that 1) Transformers can achieve near-optimal training loss during
pre-training, signifying effective knowledge acquisition; 2) With a large
fine-tuning dataset and specific data multiplicity conditions met, transformers
can achieve low generalization error when tested on factual knowledge learned
during pre-training but not reinforced during the fine-tuning, indicating
successful knowledge extraction; 3) When the conditions are not satisfied,
transformers exhibit high generalization loss, resulting in hallucinations. Our
analysis includes both full fine-tuning and low-rank fine-tuning. Furthermore,
our analysis offers theoretical insights into several pertinent empirical
phenomena, such as the role of learning rate schedules. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world PopQA datasets with GPT-2 and Llama-3.2-1B validate
our results.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合迭代主题细化、对比提示和主动学习的分类框架，用于零样本文本分类，适用于动态环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本文本分类在知识不断演化和类别边界模糊的领域（如工单系统）中的困难，传统方法（如大语言模型和少样本学习）在这些场景中表现不佳。

Method: 通过小规模标注样本生成初始主题标签，利用误分类或模糊样本进行迭代对比提示，细化类别区分，并结合人机交互动态调整类别定义。

Result: 在AGNews和DBpedia数据集上分别达到91%和84%的准确率，引入未见类别后性能稳定（82%和87%）。

Conclusion: 基于提示的语义推理在有限监督下能有效实现细粒度分类，适用于动态环境。

Abstract: Zero-shot text classification remains a difficult task in domains with
evolving knowledge and ambiguous category boundaries, such as ticketing
systems. Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to generalize in these
scenarios due to limited topic separability, while few-shot methods are
constrained by insufficient data diversity. We propose a classification
framework that combines iterative topic refinement, contrastive prompting, and
active learning. Starting with a small set of labeled samples, the model
generates initial topic labels. Misclassified or ambiguous samples are then
used in an iterative contrastive prompting process to refine category
distinctions by explicitly teaching the model to differentiate between closely
related classes. The framework features a human-in-the-loop component, allowing
users to introduce or revise category definitions in natural language. This
enables seamless integration of new, unseen categories without retraining,
making the system well-suited for real-world, dynamic environments. The
evaluations on AGNews and DBpedia demonstrate strong performance: 91% accuracy
on AGNews (3 seen, 1 unseen class) and 84% on DBpedia (8 seen, 1 unseen), with
minimal accuracy shift after introducing unseen classes (82% and 87%,
respectively). The results highlight the effectiveness of prompt-based semantic
reasoning for fine-grained classification with limited supervision.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大规模语言模型（LLM）的持续预训练方法，通过经验回放和梯度对齐技术解决数据分布偏移问题，实验证明这两种方法能稳定学习且避免遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM训练在新数据出现时需要从头开始，效率低下且浪费资源。持续预训练是一种更高效的方法，但新数据可能导致性能下降。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用Llama架构家族的大规模持续预训练，实验中使用1000亿标记的多语言数据，比较经验回放和梯度对齐的效果，并提出高效的元经验回放（MER）实现。

Result: 经验回放和梯度对齐均能稳定学习且避免遗忘，梯度对齐首次在LLM预训练中证明有效。小比例回放旧数据比增加模型规模更高效。

Conclusion: 持续预训练中，经验回放和梯度对齐是有效方法，小比例回放旧数据优于单纯扩大模型规模，为LLM训练提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) typically involves pre-training on
massive corpora, only to restart the process entirely when new data becomes
available. A more efficient and resource-conserving approach would be continual
pre-training, where models are updated with new data rather than retraining
from scratch. However, the introduction of new data often causes distribution
shifts, leading to performance degradation on previously learned tasks. In this
paper, we take a deeper look at two popular proposals for addressing this
distribution shift within the continual learning literature: experience replay
and gradient alignment. We consider continual pre-training of models within the
Llama family of architectures at a large scale across languages with 100
billion tokens of training data in each language, finding that both replay and
gradient alignment lead to more stable learning without forgetting. This
conclusion holds both as we vary the model scale and as we vary the number and
diversity of tasks. Moreover, we are the first to demonstrate the effectiveness
of gradient alignment techniques in the context of LLM pre-training and propose
an efficient implementation of meta-experience replay (MER) that imbues
experience replay with the benefits of gradient alignment despite negligible
compute and memory overhead. Our scaling analysis across model sizes and replay
rates indicates that small rates of replaying old examples are definitely a
more valuable use of compute than investing in model size, but that it is more
compute efficient to scale the size of the model than invest in high rates of
replaying old examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究神经网络内部表示的组织方式，探索无监督方法是否能发现自然子空间。

Method: 使用邻居距离最小化（NDM）目标，无监督学习非基对齐的子空间。

Result: 子空间在许多情况下可解释，且与GPT-2中的已知电路变量有强关联。

Conclusion: NDM为理解模型内部和构建电路提供了新视角。

Abstract: Understanding internal representations of neural models is a core interest of
mechanistic interpretability. Due to its large dimensionality, the
representation space can encode various aspects about inputs. To what extent
are different aspects organized and encoded in separate subspaces? Is it
possible to find these ``natural'' subspaces in a purely unsupervised way?
Somewhat surprisingly, we can indeed achieve this and find interpretable
subspaces by a seemingly unrelated training objective. Our method, neighbor
distance minimization (NDM), learns non-basis-aligned subspaces in an
unsupervised manner. Qualitative analysis shows subspaces are interpretable in
many cases, and encoded information in obtained subspaces tends to share the
same abstract concept across different inputs, making such subspaces similar to
``variables'' used by the model. We also conduct quantitative experiments using
known circuits in GPT-2; results show a strong connection between subspaces and
circuit variables. We also provide evidence showing scalability to 2B models by
finding separate subspaces mediating context and parametric knowledge routing.
Viewed more broadly, our findings offer a new perspective on understanding
model internals and building circuits.

Motivation: 现有方法在分子推理中缺乏领域特异性语义或面临可解释性问题，MolReasoner旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 1. Mol-SFT：用GPT-4o生成的合成CoT样本初始化模型推理能力；2. Mol-RL：通过强化学习对齐化学结构与语言描述。

Result: MolReasoner显著提升可解释性和分子理解能力，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MolReasoner实现了从记忆到化学推理的转变，为分子推理提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various domains, yet their capabilities in molecular reasoning remain
insufficiently explored. Current approaches tend to rely heavily on
general-purpose prompting, which lacks domain-specific molecular semantics,
while those that use fine-tuning strategies often face challenges with
interpretability and reasoning depth. To address these issues, we introduce
MolReasoner, a two-stage framework designed to transition LLMs from
memorization towards chemical reasoning. First, we propose Mol-SFT, which
initializes the model's reasoning abilities via synthetic Chain-of-Thought(CoT)
samples generated by GPT-4o and verified for chemical accuracy. Subsequently,
Mol-RL applies reinforcement learning with specialized reward functions
designed explicitly to align chemical structures with linguistic descriptions,
thereby enhancing molecular reasoning capabilities. Our approach notably
enhances interpretability, improving the model 's molecular understanding and
enabling better generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MolReasoner outperforms existing methods, and marking a significant shift from
memorization-based outputs to robust chemical reasoning.

Motivation: ANNS算法在AI应用中日益重要，特别是在检索增强生成（RAG）和基于代理的LLM应用中。CRINN旨在通过强化学习自动化优化ANNS算法。

Method: 将ANNS优化视为强化学习问题，以执行速度作为奖励信号，自动生成更快的实现。

Conclusion: CRINN的成功不仅验证了强化学习在ANNS优化中的有效性，还展示了LLM结合强化学习可以自动化复杂算法优化。

Abstract: Approximate nearest-neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms have become
increasingly critical for recent AI applications, particularly in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based LLM applications. In this
paper, we present CRINN, a new paradigm for ANNS algorithms. CRINN treats ANNS
optimization as a reinforcement learning problem where execution speed serves
as the reward signal. This approach enables the automatic generation of
progressively faster ANNS implementations while maintaining accuracy
constraints. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates CRINN's effectiveness
across six widely-used NNS benchmark datasets. When compared against
state-of-the-art open-source ANNS algorithms, CRINN achieves best performance
on three of them (GIST-960-Euclidean, MNIST-784-Euclidean, and
GloVe-25-angular), and tied for first place on two of them (SIFT-128-Euclidean
and GloVe-25-angular). The implications of CRINN's success reach well beyond
ANNS optimization: It validates that LLMs augmented with reinforcement learning
can function as an effective tool for automating sophisticated algorithmic
optimizations that demand specialized knowledge and labor-intensive manual
refinement.Code can be found at https://github.com/deepreinforce-ai/CRINN

Result: 实验显示，K缓存内存减少高达70%，V缓存内存减少16%-18%，注意力计算速度提升1.3倍。

Conclusion: LeanK有效解决了LLMs中的KV缓存效率问题，并通过分析学习到的重要性分布提供了对模型通道和注意力头的深入理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enable long-context tasks but face efficiency
challenges due to the growing key-value (KV) cache. We propose LeanK, a
learning-based method that prunes unimportant key (K) cache channels by
leveraging static channel sparsity. With a novel two-stage training process,
LeanK learns channel-wise static mask that could satisfy specific sparsity
ratio and hardware alignment requirement. LeanK reduces GPU memory and
accelerates decoding without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments demonstrate up
to 70% K cache and 16%-18% V cache memory reduction. Custom decoding kernel
enables 1.3x speedup for attention computation. We also provide insights into

Result: CellForge在六种数据集上的扰动预测任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CellForge展示了多智能体协作在解决复杂建模问题中的优势。

Abstract: Virtual cell modeling represents an emerging frontier at the intersection of
artificial intelligence and biology, aiming to predict quantities such as
responses to diverse perturbations quantitatively. However, autonomously
building computational models for virtual cells is challenging due to the
complexity of biological systems, the heterogeneity of data modalities, and the
need for domain-specific expertise across multiple disciplines. Here, we
introduce CellForge, an agentic system that leverages a multi-agent framework
that transforms presented biological datasets and research objectives directly
into optimized computational models for virtual cells. More specifically, given
only raw single-cell multi-omics data and task descriptions as input, CellForge
outputs both an optimized model architecture and executable code for training
virtual cell models and inference. The framework integrates three core modules:
Task Analysis for presented dataset characterization and relevant literature
retrieval, Method Design, where specialized agents collaboratively develop
optimized modeling strategies, and Experiment Execution for automated
generation of code. The agents in the Design module are separated into experts
with differing perspectives and a central moderator, and have to
collaboratively exchange solutions until they achieve a reasonable consensus.
We demonstrate CellForge's capabilities in single-cell perturbation prediction,
using six diverse datasets that encompass gene knockouts, drug treatments, and
cytokine stimulations across multiple modalities. CellForge consistently
outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods. Overall, CellForge
demonstrates how iterative interaction between LLM agents with differing
perspectives provides better solutions than directly addressing a modeling
challenge. Our code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法对整段响应分配相同奖励，导致信用分配不精确，影响学习效率和策略优化。

Result: CAPO在多个数学基准和跨领域基准上优于监督学习和基于RL的微调方法。

Conclusion: CAPO通过细粒度信用分配和投票机制，实现了更高效和准确的强化学习。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has improved the
reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using rule-based binary
feedback, helping to mitigate reward hacking. However, current RLVR methods
typically treat whole responses as single actions, assigning the same reward to
every token. This coarse-grained feedback hampers precise credit assignment,
making it hard for models to identify which reasoning steps lead to success or
failure, and often results in suboptimal policies and inefficient learning.
Methods like PPO provide credit assignment through value estimation, but often
yield inaccurate and unverifiable signals due to limited sampling. On the other
hand, methods using Process Reward Models can provide step-by-step judgments
for each reasoning step, but they require high-quality process supervision
labels and are time-consuming when applied in online reinforcement learning
(RL). To overcome these limitations, we introduce a simple but efficient method
Credit Assignment Policy Optimization (CAPO). Given a reasoning response
rollout from the policy model, CAPO directly leverages an off-the-shelf,
general-purpose LLM as a Generative Process Reward Model (LLM-as-GenPRM) to
generate all step-wise critique by one pass, thereby providing verifiable
token-level rewards to refine the tokens that were originally assigned
identical rule-based rewards. This enables more fine-grained credit assignment
in an effective way. Furthermore, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
CAPO, we employ voting mechanisms that scale with the number of generated
critiques. Extensive experiments using different backbones like Llama and Qwen
models and in different sizes show that CAPO consistently outperforms
supervised learning-based and RL-based fine-tuning methods across six
challenging mathematical benchmarks and three out-of-domain benchmarks.

Method: 设计混合系统，由LLMs生成高层交易策略指导RL代理行动，并通过专家评审和财务指标（如Sharpe Ratio和Maximum Drawdown）评估其效果。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLM引导的代理在收益和风险指标上优于传统RL方法。

Conclusion: LLMs与RL的结合能够提升算法交易的决策质量，尤其在长期目标和策略透明度方面表现突出。

Abstract: Algorithmic trading requires short-term decisions aligned with long-term
financial goals. While reinforcement learning (RL) has been explored for such
tactical decisions, its adoption remains limited by myopic behavior and opaque
policy rationale. In contrast, large language models (LLMs) have recently
demonstrated strategic reasoning and multi-modal financial signal
interpretation when guided by well-designed prompts.
  We propose a hybrid system where LLMs generate high-level trading strategies
to guide RL agents in their actions. We evaluate (i) the rationale of
LLM-generated strategies via expert review, and (ii) the Sharpe Ratio (SR) and
Maximum Drawdown (MDD) of LLM-guided agents versus unguided baselines. Results
show improved return and risk metrics over standard RL.

Result: 发现注意力汇聚现象是建立稳定坐标系的优化解，且架构组件（如位置编码）会影响参考框架类型。

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer注意力机制提供了新视角，对架构设计和注意力汇聚现象的理解具有重要意义。

Abstract: Attention sink (AS) is a consistent pattern in transformer attention maps
where certain tokens (often special tokens or positional anchors)
disproportionately attract attention from other tokens. We show that in
transformers, AS is not an architectural artifact, but it is the manifestation
of a fundamental geometric principle: the establishment of reference frames
that anchor representational spaces. We analyze several architectures and
identify three distinct reference frame types, centralized, distributed, and
bidirectional, that correlate with the attention sink phenomenon. We show that
they emerge during the earliest stages of training as optimal solutions to the
problem of establishing stable coordinate systems in high-dimensional spaces.
We show the influence of architecture components, particularly position
encoding implementations, on the specific type of reference frame. This
perspective transforms our understanding of transformer attention mechanisms
and provides insights for both architecture design and the relationship with
AS.

Conclusion: FRA框架和SDSN算法有效解决了松弛方法的误差问题，混合精度架构进一步提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Graph matching, typically formulated as a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP),
seeks to establish node correspondences between two graphs. To address the
NP-hardness of QAP, some existing methods adopt projection-based relaxations
that embed the problem into the convex hull of the discrete domain. However,
these relaxations inevitably enlarge the feasible set, introducing two sources
of error: numerical scale sensitivity and geometric misalignment between the
relaxed and original domains. To alleviate these errors, we propose a novel
relaxation framework by reformulating the projection step as a
Frobenius-regularized Linear Assignment (FRA) problem, where a tunable
regularization term mitigates feasible region inflation. This formulation
enables normalization-based operations to preserve numerical scale invariance
without compromising accuracy. To efficiently solve FRA, we propose the Scaling
Doubly Stochastic Normalization (SDSN) algorithm. Building on its favorable
computational properties, we develop a theoretically grounded mixed-precision
architecture to achieve substantial acceleration. Comprehensive CPU-based
benchmarks demonstrate that FRAM consistently outperforms all baseline methods
under identical precision settings. When combined with a GPU-based
mixed-precision architecture, FRAM achieves up to 370X speedup over its
CPU-FP64 counterpart, with negligible loss in solution accuracy.

Result: IMU在视觉和语言任务中均优于现有无需保留数据的遗忘方法。

Conclusion: IMU是一种简单有效的机器遗忘方法，显著提升遗忘效果并保持模型性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to attacks
and tend to memorize training data points, raising significant concerns about
privacy leakage. This motivates the development of machine unlearning (MU),
i.e., a paradigm that enables models to selectively forget specific data points
upon request. However, most existing MU algorithms require partial or full
fine-tuning on the retain set. This necessitates continued access to the
original training data, which is often impractical due to privacy concerns and
storage constraints. A few retain-data-free MU methods have been proposed, but
some rely on access to auxiliary data and precomputed statistics of the retain
set, while others scale poorly when forgetting larger portions of data. In this
paper, we propose Influence-guided Machine Unlearning (IMU), a simple yet
effective method that conducts MU using only the forget set. Specifically, IMU
employs gradient ascent and innovatively introduces dynamic allocation of
unlearning intensities across different data points based on their influences.
This adaptive strategy significantly enhances unlearning effectiveness while
maintaining model utility. Results across vision and language tasks demonstrate
that IMU consistently outperforms existing retain-data-free MU methods.

Conclusion: CcGAN-AVAR通过创新设计解决了数据不平衡和计算效率问题，为连续条件生成建模提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in conditional generative modeling have introduced Continuous
conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CcGAN) and Continuous Conditional
Diffusion Model (CCDM) for estimating high-dimensional data distributions
conditioned on scalar, continuous regression labels (e.g., angles, ages, or
temperatures). However, these approaches face fundamental limitations: CcGAN
suffers from data imbalance due to fixed-size vicinity constraints, while CCDM
requires computationally expensive iterative sampling. We present CcGAN-AVAR,
an enhanced CcGAN framework that addresses both challenges: (1) leveraging the
GAN framework's native one-step generation to overcome CCDMs' sampling
bottleneck (achieving 300x-2000x faster inference), while (2) two novel
components specifically target data imbalance - an adaptive vicinity mechanism
that dynamically adjusts vicinity's size, and a multi-task discriminator that
constructs two regularization terms (through auxiliary regression and density
ratio estimation) to significantly improve generator training. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets (64x64 to 192x192 resolution) across
eight challenging imbalanced settings demonstrate that CcGAN-AVAR achieves
state-of-the-art generation quality while maintaining sampling efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，OccamVTS在多个基准数据集上实现最优性能，参数仅为原模型的1%，尤其在少样本和零样本场景表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过去除冗余参数和语义噪声，OccamVTS显著提升时间序列预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is fundamental to diverse applications, with recent
approaches leverage large vision models (LVMs) to capture temporal patterns
through visual representations. We reveal that while vision models enhance
forecasting performance, 99% of their parameters are unnecessary for time
series tasks. Through cross-modal analysis, we find that time series align with
low-level textural features but not high-level semantics, which can impair
forecasting accuracy. We propose OccamVTS, a knowledge distillation framework
that extracts only the essential 1% of predictive information from LVMs into
lightweight networks. Using pre-trained LVMs as privileged teachers, OccamVTS
employs pyramid-style feature alignment combined with correlation and feature
distillation to transfer beneficial patterns while filtering out semantic
noise. Counterintuitively, this aggressive parameter reduction improves
accuracy by eliminating overfitting to irrelevant visual features while
preserving essential temporal patterns. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that OccamVTS consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of the original parameters,
particularly excelling in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

Motivation: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Noisy labels pose a common challenge for training accurate deep neural
networks. To mitigate label noise, prior studies have proposed various robust
loss functions to achieve noise tolerance in the presence of label noise,
particularly symmetric losses. However, they usually suffer from the
underfitting issue due to the overly strict symmetric condition. In this work,
we propose a simple yet effective approach for relaxing the symmetric
condition, namely $\epsilon$-softmax, which simply modifies the outputs of the
softmax layer to approximate one-hot vectors with a controllable error
$\epsilon$. Essentially, $\epsilon$-softmax not only acts as an alternative for
the softmax layer, but also implicitly plays the crucial role in modifying the
loss function. We prove theoretically that $\epsilon$-softmax can achieve
noise-tolerant learning with controllable excess risk bound for almost any loss
function. Recognizing that $\epsilon$-softmax-enhanced losses may slightly
reduce fitting ability on clean datasets, we further incorporate them with one
symmetric loss, thereby achieving a better trade-off between robustness and
effective learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
method in mitigating synthetic and real-world label noise. The code is
available at https://github.com/cswjl/eps-softmax.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种考虑临床专家不确定性的标签平滑方法，以解决医学图像分析中标签噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了临床专家在诊断中的不确定性（如“可能”或“未排除”），导致标签噪声。

Method: 研究了临床专家不确定性对标签噪声的影响，并提出了一种不确定性感知的标签平滑方法。

Result: 提出的方法显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过考虑专家不确定性，能更有效地处理医学图像分析中的标签噪声。

Abstract: Many previous studies have proposed extracting image labels from clinical
notes to create large-scale medical image datasets at a low cost. However,
these approaches inherently suffer from label noise due to uncertainty from the
clinical experts. When radiologists and physicians analyze medical images to
make diagnoses, they often include uncertainty-aware notes such as ``maybe'' or
``not excluded''. Unfortunately, current text-mining methods overlook these
nuances, resulting in the creation of noisy labels. Existing methods for
handling noisy labels in medical image analysis, which typically address the
problem through post-processing techniques, have largely ignored the important
issue of expert-driven uncertainty contributing to label noise. To better
incorporate the expert-written uncertainty in clinical notes into medical image
analysis and address the label noise issue, we first examine the impact of
clinical expert uncertainty on label noise. We then propose a clinical expert
uncertainty-aware benchmark, along with a label smoothing method, which
significantly improves performance compared to current state-of-the-art
approaches.

Motivation: 深度学习模型的可解释性对神经影像应用至关重要，但现有XAI方法缺乏严格验证，可能导致误解。

Method: 通过构建具有已知信号源的预测任务，验证XAI方法的准确性，未人为修改输入图像。

Result: GradCAM无法准确定位预测特征，LRP生成大量虚假解释，而SmoothGrad表现稳健。

Conclusion: XAI方法需针对神经影像数据做领域适配和验证，现有研究结果需重新评估。

Abstract: Trustworthy interpretation of deep learning models is critical for
neuroimaging applications, yet commonly used Explainable AI (XAI) methods lack
rigorous validation, risking misinterpretation. We performed the first
large-scale, systematic comparison of XAI methods on ~45,000 structural brain
MRIs using a novel XAI validation framework. This framework establishes
verifiable ground truth by constructing prediction tasks with known signal
sources - from localized anatomical features to subject-specific clinical
lesions - without artificially altering input images. Our analysis reveals
systematic failures in two of the most widely used methods: GradCAM
consistently failed to localize predictive features, while Layer-wise Relevance
Propagation generated extensive, artifactual explanations that suggest
incompatibility with neuroimaging data characteristics. Our results indicate
that these failures stem from a domain mismatch, where methods with design
principles tailored to natural images require substantial adaptation for
neuroimaging data. In contrast, the simpler, gradient-based method SmoothGrad,
which makes fewer assumptions about data structure, proved consistently
accurate, suggesting its conceptual simplicity makes it more robust to this
domain shift. These findings highlight the need for domain-specific adaptation
and validation of XAI methods, suggest that interpretations from prior
neuroimaging studies using standard XAI methodology warrant re-evaluation, and
provide urgent guidance for practical application of XAI in neuroimaging.

Motivation: 空间转录组学领域缺乏对多模态学习方法的全面基准测试，HESCAPE旨在填补这一空白，推动多模态学习方法的发展。

Method: 构建了一个跨器官数据集，评估了多种预训练策略下的图像和基因表达编码器，并测试了它们在基因突变分类和基因表达预测任务中的表现。

Result: 基因表达编码器对表征对齐起主要作用，对比预训练在基因突变分类中表现优异，但在基因表达预测中表现不佳，批次效应是影响跨模态对齐的关键因素。

Conclusion: HESCAPE为空间转录组学提供了标准化数据集和评估工具，强调了开发批次鲁棒的多模态学习方法的必要性。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics enables simultaneous measurement of gene expression
and tissue morphology, offering unprecedented insights into cellular
organization and disease mechanisms. However, the field lacks comprehensive
benchmarks for evaluating multimodal learning methods that leverage both
histology images and gene expression data. Here, we present HESCAPE, a
large-scale benchmark for cross-modal contrastive pretraining in spatial
transcriptomics, built on a curated pan-organ dataset spanning 6 different gene
panels and 54 donors. We systematically evaluated state-of-the-art image and
gene expression encoders across multiple pretraining strategies and assessed
their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: gene mutation classification and
gene expression prediction. Our benchmark demonstrates that gene expression
encoders are the primary determinant of strong representational alignment, and
that gene models pretrained on spatial transcriptomics data outperform both
those trained without spatial data and simple baseline approaches. However,
downstream task evaluation reveals a striking contradiction: while contrastive
pretraining consistently improves gene mutation classification performance, it
degrades direct gene expression prediction compared to baseline encoders
trained without cross-modal objectives. We identify batch effects as a key
factor that interferes with effective cross-modal alignment. Our findings
highlight the critical need for batch-robust multimodal learning approaches in
spatial transcriptomics. To accelerate progress in this direction, we release
HESCAPE, providing standardized datasets, evaluation protocols, and
benchmarking tools for the community

Motivation: 随着音频大语言模型的兴起，其安全性问题亟待解决。音频的独特性带来了新的挑战，而现有研究多集中于文本和视觉领域。

Method: 论文提出HIN框架，通过修改音频波形（如时间动态调整和频谱噪声注入）嵌入后门触发器，并开发AudioSafe基准测试评估ALLM的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示，ALLM对音频特征（如环境噪声和语速变化）的攻击成功率超过90%，但对音量触发不敏感，且攻击隐蔽性高。

Conclusion: ALLM在音频特征后门攻击中存在显著漏洞，需加强安全性研究。

Abstract: As Audio Large Language Models (ALLMs) emerge as powerful tools for speech
processing, their safety implications demand urgent attention. While
considerable research has explored textual and vision safety, audio's distinct
characteristics present significant challenges. This paper first investigates:
Is ALLM vulnerable to backdoor attacks exploiting acoustic triggers? In
response to this issue, we introduce Hidden in the Noise (HIN), a novel
backdoor attack framework designed to exploit subtle, audio-specific features.
HIN applies acoustic modifications to raw audio waveforms, such as alterations
to temporal dynamics and strategic injection of spectrally tailored noise.
These changes introduce consistent patterns that an ALLM's acoustic feature
encoder captures, embedding robust triggers within the audio stream. To
evaluate ALLM robustness against audio-feature-based triggers, we develop the
AudioSafe benchmark, assessing nine distinct risk types. Extensive experiments
on AudioSafe and three established safety datasets reveal critical
vulnerabilities in existing ALLMs: (I) audio features like environment noise
and speech rate variations achieve over 90% average attack success rate. (II)
ALLMs exhibit significant sensitivity differences across acoustic features,
particularly showing minimal response to volume as a trigger, and (III)
poisoned sample inclusion causes only marginal loss curve fluctuations,
highlighting the attack's stealth.

Motivation: 音频-视觉时序深度伪造定位在内容驱动的部分篡改场景下极具挑战性，现有方法难以处理少数帧被篡改的情况。

Method: HBMNet包含三个模块：音频-视觉特征编码器、粗粒度提案生成器和细粒度概率生成器，结合多模态学习和多尺度时序建模。

Result: 实验表明HBMNet在精度和召回率上均有提升，优于BA-TFD和UMMAFormer，并展示出更强的可扩展性。

Conclusion: HBMNet通过多模块协作和多模态融合，显著提升了音频-视觉深度伪造定位的性能。

Abstract: Audio-visual temporal deepfake localization under the content-driven partial
manipulation remains a highly challenging task. In this scenario, the deepfake
regions are usually only spanning a few frames, with the majority of the rest
remaining identical to the original. To tackle this, we propose a Hierarchical
Boundary Modeling Network (HBMNet), which includes three modules: an
Audio-Visual Feature Encoder that extracts discriminative frame-level
representations, a Coarse Proposal Generator that predicts candidate boundary
regions, and a Fine-grained Probabilities Generator that refines these
proposals using bidirectional boundary-content probabilities. From the modality
perspective, we enhance audio-visual learning through dedicated encoding and
fusion, reinforced by frame-level supervision to boost discriminability. From
the temporal perspective, HBMNet integrates multi-scale cues and bidirectional
boundary-content relationships. Experiments show that encoding and fusion
primarily improve precision, while frame-level supervision boosts recall. Each
module (audio-visual fusion, temporal scales, bi-directionality) contributes
complementary benefits, collectively enhancing localization performance. HBMNet
outperforms BA-TFD and UMMAFormer and shows improved potential scalability with
more training data.

Abstract: The proliferation of audio deepfakes poses a growing threat to trust in
digital communications. While detection methods have advanced, attributing
audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial
challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice
Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model
recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted
by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized
classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which
identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition
(ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve
robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection
thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong
performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all
datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes.
Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation
analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the
field by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model
recognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and
accompanied by publicly released models and code. Models and code are available

Abstract: We present MeshLLM, a novel framework that leverages large language models

addresses key limitations in existing methods, including the limited dataset
scale when catering to LLMs' token length and the loss of 3D structural
information during mesh serialization. We introduce a Primitive-Mesh
decomposition strategy, which divides 3D meshes into structurally meaningful
subunits. This enables the creation of a large-scale dataset with 1500k+
samples, almost 50 times larger than previous methods, which aligns better with
the LLM scaling law principles. Furthermore, we propose inferring face
connectivity from vertices and local mesh assembly training strategies,
significantly enhancing the LLMs' ability to capture mesh topology and spatial
structures. Experiments show that MeshLLM outperforms the state-of-the-art
LLaMA-Mesh in both mesh generation quality and shape understanding,

Abstract: The reconstruction of multi-layer 3D garments typically requires expensive
multi-view capture setups and specialized 3D editing efforts. To support the
creation of life-like clothed human avatars, we introduce ReMu for
reconstructing multi-layer clothed humans in a new setup, Image Layers, which
captures a subject wearing different layers of clothing with a single RGB
camera. To reconstruct physically plausible multi-layer 3D garments, a unified
3D representation is necessary to model these garments in a layered manner.
Thus, we first reconstruct and align each garment layer in a shared coordinate
system defined by the canonical body pose. Afterwards, we introduce a
collision-aware optimization process to address interpenetration and further
refine the garment boundaries leveraging implicit neural fields. It is worth
noting that our method is template-free and category-agnostic, which enables
the reconstruction of 3D garments in diverse clothing styles. Through our
experiments, we show that our method reconstructs nearly penetration-free 3D
clothed humans and achieves competitive performance compared to
category-specific methods. Project page: https://eth-ait.github.io/ReMu/

Abstract: In-betweening human motion generation aims to synthesize intermediate motions
that transition between user-specified keyframes. In addition to maintaining
smooth transitions, a crucial requirement of this task is to generate diverse
motion sequences. It is still challenging to maintain diversity, particularly
when it is necessary for the motions within a generated batch sampling to
differ meaningfully from one another due to complex motion dynamics. In this
paper, we propose a novel method, termed the Multi-Criteria Guidance with
In-Betweening Motion Model (MCG-IMM), for in-betweening human motion
generation. A key strength of MCG-IMM lies in its plug-and-play nature: it
enhances the diversity of motions generated by pretrained models without
introducing additional parameters This is achieved by providing a sampling
process of pretrained generative models with multi-criteria guidance.
Specifically, MCG-IMM reformulates the sampling process of pretrained
generative model as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and introduces an
optimization process to explore motion sequences that satisfy multiple
criteria, e.g., diversity and smoothness. Moreover, our proposed plug-and-play
multi-criteria guidance is compatible with different families of generative
models, including denoised diffusion probabilistic models, variational
autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks. Experiments on four popular
human motion datasets demonstrate that MCG-IMM consistently state-of-the-art
methods in in-betweening motion generation task.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel method for uncertainty estimation (UE) in
Gaussian Splatting. UE is crucial for using Gaussian Splatting in critical
applications such as robotics and medicine. Previous methods typically estimate
the variance of Gaussian primitives and use the rendering process to obtain
pixel-wise uncertainties. Our method establishes primitive representations of
error and visibility of trainings views, which carries meaningful uncertainty
information. This representation is obtained by projection of training error
and visibility onto the primitives. Uncertainties of novel views are obtained
by rendering the primitive representations of uncertainty for those novel
views, yielding uncertainty feature maps. To aggregate these uncertainty
feature maps of novel views, we perform a pixel-wise regression on holdout
data. In our experiments, we analyze the different components of our method,
investigating various combinations of uncertainty feature maps and regression
models. Furthermore, we considered the effect of separating splatting into
foreground and background. Our UEs show high correlations to true errors,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods, especially on foreground objects. The
trained regression models show generalization capabilities to new scenes,
allowing uncertainty estimation without the need for holdout data.

Method: 通过大量实验总结三个经验性洞察，提出基于LLM代理的框架AgentTTS，通过迭代反馈自主搜索最优分配。

Result: 实验表明，AgentTTS在搜索效率和鲁棒性上优于传统方法，且具有更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: AgentTTS为多阶段复杂任务中的计算资源分配提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) by allocating additional compute resources during inference. However,
existing research primarily investigates TTS in single-stage tasks; while many
real-world problems are multi-stage complex tasks, composed of a sequence of
heterogeneous subtasks with each subtask requires LLM of specific capability.
Therefore, we study a novel problem: the test-time compute-optimal scaling in
multi-stage complex tasks, aiming to select suitable models and allocate
budgets per subtask to maximize overall performance. TTS in multi-stage tasks
introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) The combinatorial search space of
model and budget allocations, combined with the high cost of inference, makes
brute-force search impractical. (ii) The optimal model and budget allocations
across subtasks are interdependent, increasing the complexity of the
compute-optimal search. To address this gap, we conduct extensive pilot
experiments on four tasks across six datasets, deriving three empirical
insights characterizing the behavior of LLMs in multi-stage complex tasks.
Informed by these insights, we propose AgentTTS, an LLM-agent-based framework
that autonomously searches for compute-optimal allocations through iterative
feedback-driven interactions with the execution environment. Experimental
results demonstrate that AgentTTS significantly outperforms traditional and
other LLM-based baselines in search efficiency, and shows improved robustness
to varying training set sizes and enhanced interpretability.

of losing something than when they might gain. I report the first tests of
Kahneman and Tversky's landmark 'prospect theory' with Large Language Models,
including today's state of the art chain-of-thought 'reasoners'.
  In common with humans, I find that prospect theory often anticipates how
these models approach risky decisions across a range of scenarios. I also
demonstrate that context is key to explaining much of the variance in risk
appetite. The 'frame' through which risk is apprehended appears to be embedded
within the language of the scenarios tackled by the models. Specifically, I
find that military scenarios generate far larger 'framing effects' than do
civilian settings, ceteris paribus. My research suggests, therefore, that
language models the world, capturing our human heuristics and biases. But also
that these biases are uneven - the idea of a 'frame' is richer than simple
gains and losses. Wittgenstein's notion of 'language games' explains the
contingent, localised biases activated by these scenarios. Finally, I use my
findings to reframe the ongoing debate about reasoning and memorisation in
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低CAD设计门槛，提高设计效率。

Method: 采用Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm（CIP），结合交互式对话和视觉反馈生成CAD代码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在CAD代码生成方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了CAD设计的易用性和生成代码的质量。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing
but typically requires a high level of expertise from designers. To lower the
entry barrier and improve design efficiency, we present an agent for CAD
conceptual design powered by large language models (LLMs). The agent accepts
both abstract textual descriptions and freehand sketches as input, engaging in
interactive dialogue with users to refine and clarify design requirements
through comprehensive requirement analysis. Built upon a novel
Context-Independent Imperative Paradigm (CIP), the agent generates high-quality
CAD modeling code. During the generation process, the agent incorporates
iterative visual feedback to improve model quality. Generated design cases are
stored in a structured knowledge base, enabling continuous improvement of the
agent's code generation capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD code generation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文探讨了Chain-of-Thought (CoT) 提示在大型语言模型（LLM）中的表现，发现其推理能力可能只是表面现象，并研究了其与数据分布的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CoT提示看似能提升LLM的任务表现，但初步研究表明其推理可能较为肤浅，作者希望通过数据分布视角深入探究其本质。

Method: 通过设计DataAlchemy实验环境，从任务、长度和格式三个维度分析CoT推理，并在不同数据分布条件下训练和测试LLM。

Result: 研究发现CoT推理在超出训练数据分布时会失效，表明其能力受限于训练数据的分布范围。

Conclusion: CoT推理是一种脆弱的假象，其有效性依赖于训练数据的分布，揭示了实现真正泛化推理的挑战。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been shown to improve Large Language
Model (LLM) performance on various tasks. With this approach, LLMs appear to
produce human-like reasoning steps before providing answers (a.k.a., CoT
reasoning), which often leads to the perception that they engage in deliberate
inferential processes. However, some initial findings suggest that CoT
reasoning may be more superficial than it appears, motivating us to explore
further. In this paper, we study CoT reasoning via a data distribution lens and
investigate if CoT reasoning reflects a structured inductive bias learned from
in-distribution data, allowing the model to conditionally generate reasoning
paths that approximate those seen during training. Thus, its effectiveness is
fundamentally bounded by the degree of distribution discrepancy between the
training data and the test queries. With this lens, we dissect CoT reasoning
via three dimensions: task, length, and format. To investigate each dimension,
we design DataAlchemy, an isolated and controlled environment to train LLMs
from scratch and systematically probe them under various distribution
conditions. Our results reveal that CoT reasoning is a brittle mirage that
vanishes when it is pushed beyond training distributions. This work offers a
deeper understanding of why and when CoT reasoning fails, emphasizing the
ongoing challenge of achieving genuine and generalizable reasoning.

TL;DR: Multi-TW是首个针对传统中文的多模态基准测试，评估任意模态模型的性能和延迟，填补了现有基准的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽视了传统中文的三模态评估和推理延迟问题，Multi-TW旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Multi-TW包含900道选择题（图文、音频和文本对），基于SC-TOP开发的官方测试，评估了多种任意模态模型和视觉语言模型。

Result: 闭源模型在多模态任务中表现更优，但开源模型在音频任务中表现良好；端到端任意模态模型在延迟上优于视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: Multi-TW全面展示了模型能力，并强调了传统中文微调和高效多模态架构的必要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process visual, acoustic, and
textual inputs, addressing the limitations of single-modality LLMs. However,
existing benchmarks often overlook tri-modal evaluation in Traditional Chinese
and do not consider inference latency. To address this, we introduce Multi-TW,
the first Traditional Chinese benchmark for evaluating the performance and
latency of any-to-any multimodal models. Multi-TW includes 900 multiple-choice
questions (image and text, audio and text pairs) sourced from official
proficiency tests developed with the Steering Committee for the Test of
Proficiency-Huayu (SC-TOP). We evaluated various any-to-any models and
vision-language models (VLMs) with audio transcription. Our results show that
closed-source models generally outperform open-source ones across modalities,
although open-source models can perform well in audio tasks. End-to-end
any-to-any pipelines offer clear latency advantages compared to VLMs using
separate audio transcription. Multi-TW presents a comprehensive view of model
capabilities and highlights the need for Traditional Chinese fine-tuning and
efficient multimodal architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流程奖励数据构建方法效率低下或劳动密集，限制了流程奖励模型（PRMs）的发展。

Method: 提出不确定性驱动的自动化数据生成与标注框架，并引入两种不确定性感知的输出聚合方法：混合多数奖励投票和加权奖励频率投票。

Result: 在ProcessBench、MATH和GSMPlus上的实验验证了框架的有效性，新方法进一步提升了PRMs的数学推理能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为PRMs提供了高效的数据支持，新聚合方法显著提升了模型性能，代码和数据将公开。

Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex
mathematical reasoning tasks, but they inevitably generate errors throughout
multi-step solutions. Process-level Reward Models (PRMs) have shown great
promise by providing supervision and evaluation at each intermediate step,
thereby effectively improving the models' reasoning abilities. However,
training effective PRMs requires high-quality process reward data, yet existing
methods for constructing such data are often labour-intensive or inefficient.
In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-driven framework for automated process
reward data construction, encompassing both data generation and annotation
processes for PRMs. Additionally, we identify the limitations of both majority
vote and PRMs, and introduce two generic uncertainty-aware output aggregation
methods: Hybrid Majority Reward Vote and Weighted Reward Frequency Vote, which
combine the strengths of majority vote with PRMs. Extensive experiments on
ProcessBench, MATH, and GSMPlus show the effectiveness and efficiency of the
proposed PRM data construction framework, and demonstrate that the two output
aggregation methods further improve the mathematical reasoning abilities across
diverse PRMs. The code and data will be publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCP基准测试局限于单服务器和少量工具，无法有效评估大规模真实场景中的代理能力。

Method: 提出LiveMCPBench基准测试、LiveMCPTool工具集和LiveMCPEval自动化评估框架，并设计MCP Copilot Agent进行动态规划和API交互。

Result: 最佳模型（Claude-Sonnet-4）成功率为78.95%，但不同模型性能差异显著。

Conclusion: LiveMCPBench为大规模、动态MCP环境中的代理能力评估提供了统一框架，支持可扩展和可重复的研究。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of MCP
servers has surpassed 10,000. However, existing MCP benchmarks are limited to
single-server settings with only a few tools, hindering effective evaluation of
agent capabilities in large-scale, real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we present LiveMCPBench, the first comprehensive benchmark
comprising 95 real-world tasks grounded in the MCP ecosystem, designed to
evaluate LLM agents at scale across diverse servers. To support a scalable and
reproducible evaluation pipeline in large-scale MCP environments, we curate
LiveMCPTool, a diverse and readily deployable collection of 70 MCP servers and
527 tools. Furthermore, we introduce LiveMCPEval, an LLM-as-a-Judge framework
that enables automated and adaptive evaluation in dynamic, time-varying task
environments, achieving 81% agreement with human reviewers. Finally, we propose
the MCP Copilot Agent, a multi-step agent that routes tools for dynamic
planning and executes tools for API interaction across the entire LiveMCPTool
suite. Our evaluation covers 10 leading models, with the best-performing model
(Claude-Sonnet-4) reaching a 78.95% success rate. However, we observe large
performance variance across models, and several widely-used models perform
poorly in LiveMCPBench's complex, tool-rich environments. Overall, LiveMCPBench
offers the first unified framework for benchmarking LLM agents in realistic,
tool-rich, and dynamic MCP environments, laying a solid foundation for scalable
and reproducible research on agent capabilities. Our code and data will be
publicly available at https://icip-cas.github.io/LiveMCPBench.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态掩码稀疏注意力机制（DMA），通过内容感知和位置感知的稀疏性，显著降低计算复杂度，同时保持信息完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准自注意力机制的二次复杂度问题，以及现有稀疏注意力机制的静态模式或信息丢失问题。

Method: 提出DMA机制，动态生成内容感知稀疏掩码，并结合位置感知稀疏注意力计算，减少不必要计算区域。

Result: DMA在困惑度和多查询关联召回任务中表现优于多种注意力机制，并在1.7B参数模型中显著超越多头注意力。

Conclusion: DMA有效平衡了模型效率和长上下文建模能力，具有显著优势。

Abstract: In large language models, the demand for modeling long contexts is constantly
increasing, but the quadratic complexity of the standard self-attention
mechanism often becomes a bottleneck. Although existing sparse attention
mechanisms have improved efficiency, they may still encounter issues such as
static patterns or information loss. We introduce a trainable dynamic mask
sparse attention mechanism, Dynamic Mask Attention, which effectively utilizes
content-aware and position-aware sparsity. DMA achieves this through two key
innovations: First, it dynamically generates content-aware sparse masks from
value representations, enabling the model to identify and focus on critical
information adaptively. Second, it implements position-aware sparse attention
computation that effectively skips unnecessary calculation regions. This
dual-sparsity design allows the model to significantly reduce the computational
complexity of important information while retaining complete information,
achieving an excellent balance between information fidelity and computational
efficiency. We have verified the performance of DMA through comprehensive
experiments. Comparative studies show that DMA outperforms multi-head
attention, sliding window attention, multi-head latent attention, and native
sparse attention in terms of perplexity under Chinchilla Scaling Law settings.
Moreover, in challenging multi-query associative recall tasks, DMA also
demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to these methods.
Crucially, in the evaluation of a 1.7B parameter model, DMA significantly
outperforms multi-head attention in both standard benchmark performance and the
challenging needle-in-a-haystack task. These experimental results highlight its
capability to balance model efficiency and long-context modeling ability
effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM求解器依赖迭代修复循环，导致高延迟且不可靠，OptiHive旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用单次批量LLM查询生成多样化组件（求解器、问题实例、验证测试），通过过滤和统计模型推断性能。

Result: 在复杂优化问题中，OptiHive将最优率从5%提升至92%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: OptiHive通过非迭代方法生成高质量求解器，为优化问题提供了可靠且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-based solvers have emerged as a promising means of automating problem
modeling and solving. However, they remain unreliable and often depend on
iterative repair loops that result in significant latency. We introduce
OptiHive, an LLM-based framework that produces high-quality solvers for
optimization problems from natural-language descriptions without iterative
self-correction. OptiHive uses a single batched LLM query to generate diverse
components (solvers, problem instances, and validation tests) and filters out
erroneous components to ensure fully interpretable outputs. Taking into account
the imperfection of the generated components, we employ a statistical model to
infer their true performance, enabling principled uncertainty quantification
and solver selection. On tasks ranging from traditional optimization problems
to challenging variants of the Multi-Depot Vehicle Routing Problem, OptiHive
significantly outperforms baselines, increasing the optimality rate from 5\% to
92\% on the most complex problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在复杂任务中生成的推理链存在冗余问题，原因是后训练过度依赖结果奖励范式，缺乏对中间推理步骤的调控。

Method: 提出PI框架，包含When、How和Which模块，动态干预推理路径，整合人类问题解决经验和认知科学原理。

Result: 实验表明，PI显著缩短推理链，减少幻觉，生成更简洁可靠的推理。

Conclusion: PI框架有效提升LLM推理的效率和可靠性，为动态干预提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-time compute has led to remarkable success in the large language model
(LLM) community, particularly for complex tasks, where longer chains of thought
(CoTs) are generated to enhance reasoning capabilities. However, growing
evidence reveals that such reasoning models often produce CoTs plagued by
excessive redundancy, including unnecessary verification steps and repetitive
reasoning shifts. The root cause lies in post-training of them that overly rely
on outcome reward paradigms, as the data of process reward paradigms, which
regulate intermediate reasoning steps, is difficult to construct at scale. To
address this, we propose PI, a novel framework for Test-time Prompt
Intervention. PI provides an interface to dynamically guide and regulate
reasoning paths during inference through timely (When module) and proper (How
module) interventions and post-intervention sampling (Which module). This
allows human problem-solving expertise and cognitive science principles to be
seamlessly integrated into LLMs' reasoning processes, enhancing controllability
and interpretability. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets
demonstrate that PI significantly shortens CoTs while reducing hallucination,
yielding more concise and reliable reasoning.

Conclusion: HealthFlow标志着从工具使用者到自我进化任务管理者的转变，为更自主的AI科学发现铺平道路。

Abstract: The efficacy of AI agents in healthcare research is hindered by their
reliance on static, predefined strategies. This creates a critical limitation:
agents can become better tool-users but cannot learn to become better strategic
planners, a crucial skill for complex domains like healthcare. We introduce
HealthFlow, a self-evolving AI agent that overcomes this limitation through a
novel meta-level evolution mechanism. HealthFlow autonomously refines its own
high-level problem-solving policies by distilling procedural successes and
failures into a durable, strategic knowledge base. To anchor our research and
facilitate reproducible evaluation, we introduce EHRFlowBench, a new benchmark
featuring complex, realistic health data analysis tasks derived from
peer-reviewed clinical research. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
HealthFlow's self-evolving approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
agent frameworks. This work marks a necessary shift from building better
tool-users to designing smarter, self-evolving task-managers, paving the way
for more autonomous and effective AI for scientific discovery.

Method: 采用多学科框架，结合LLM的意义整体论和LLM上下文认知场概念，分析AI如何通过关系构建意义并模拟代理性。

Result: 将Noosemia与pareidolia、泛灵论等现象区分，并引入a-noosemia描述其消退过程。

Conclusion: 论文总结了Noosemia的哲学、认识论和社会意义，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces and formalizes Noosemia, a novel
cognitive-phenomenological phenomenon emerging from human interaction with
generative AI systems, particularly those enabling dialogic or multimodal
exchanges. We propose a multidisciplinary framework to explain how, under
certain conditions, users attribute intentionality, agency, and even
interiority to these systems - a process grounded not in physical resemblance,
but in linguistic performance, epistemic opacity, and emergent technological
complexity. By linking an LLM declination of meaning holism to our technical
notion of the LLM Contextual Cognitive Field, we clarify how LLMs construct
meaning relationally and how coherence and a simulacrum of agency arise at the
human-AI interface. The analysis situates noosemia alongside pareidolia,
animism, the intentional stance and the uncanny valley, distinguishing its
unique characteristics. We also introduce a-noosemia to describe the
phenomenological withdrawal of such projections. The paper concludes with
reflections on the broader philosophical, epistemological, and social
implications of noosemic dynamics and directions for future research.

TL;DR: SURE-Med是一个统一框架，通过视觉、分布和上下文三个维度减少不确定性，提升医学报告生成的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学报告生成（MRG）面临视觉、标签分布和上下文不确定性，限制了其临床可信度。

Method: SURE-Med包含三个模块：视觉修复重采样、令牌敏感学习和上下文证据过滤，分别解决视觉、分布和上下文不确定性。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR和IU-Xray基准测试中，SURE-Med达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SURE-Med通过多维度不确定性减少，为医学报告生成设定了新的可靠性标准。

Abstract: Automated medical report generation (MRG) holds great promise for reducing
the heavy workload of radiologists. However, its clinical deployment is
hindered by three major sources of uncertainty. First, visual uncertainty,
caused by noisy or incorrect view annotations, compromises feature extraction.
Second, label distribution uncertainty, stemming from long-tailed disease
prevalence, biases models against rare but clinically critical conditions.
Third, contextual uncertainty, introduced by unverified historical reports,
often leads to factual hallucinations. These challenges collectively limit the
reliability and clinical trustworthiness of MRG systems. To address these
issues, we propose SURE-Med, a unified framework that systematically reduces
uncertainty across three critical dimensions: visual, distributional, and
contextual. To mitigate visual uncertainty, a Frontal-Aware View Repair
Resampling module corrects view annotation errors and adaptively selects
informative features from supplementary views. To tackle label distribution
uncertainty, we introduce a Token Sensitive Learning objective that enhances
the modeling of critical diagnostic sentences while reweighting
underrepresented diagnostic terms, thereby improving sensitivity to infrequent
conditions. To reduce contextual uncertainty, our Contextual Evidence Filter
validates and selectively incorporates prior information that aligns with the
current image, effectively suppressing hallucinations. Extensive experiments on
the MIMIC-CXR and IU-Xray benchmarks demonstrate that SURE-Med achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By holistically reducing uncertainty across
multiple input modalities, SURE-Med sets a new benchmark for reliability in
medical report generation and offers a robust step toward trustworthy clinical
decision support.

Conclusion: HyCodePolicy为自主决策提供了可扩展的多模态推理策略。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled
richer perceptual grounding for code policy generation in embodied agents.
However, most existing systems lack effective mechanisms to adaptively monitor
policy execution and repair codes during task completion. In this work, we
introduce HyCodePolicy, a hybrid language-based control framework that
systematically integrates code synthesis, geometric grounding, perceptual
monitoring, and iterative repair into a closed-loop programming cycle for
embodied agents. Technically, given a natural language instruction, our system
first decomposes it into subgoals and generates an initial executable program
grounded in object-centric geometric primitives. The program is then executed
in simulation, while a vision-language model (VLM) observes selected
checkpoints to detect and localize execution failures and infer failure
reasons. By fusing structured execution traces capturing program-level events
with VLM-based perceptual feedback, HyCodePolicy infers failure causes and
repairs programs. This hybrid dual feedback mechanism enables self-correcting
program synthesis with minimal human supervision. Our results demonstrate that
HyCodePolicy significantly improves the robustness and sample efficiency of
robot manipulation policies, offering a scalable strategy for integrating
multimodal reasoning into autonomous decision-making pipelines.

Motivation: 全球对药用植物（如大马士革玫瑰）需求激增，但人工采摘效率低，亟需自动化解决方案。

Method: 两阶段算法：基于立体图像的2D点检测和轻量级深度神经网络的深度估计；使用Blender生成合成数据集以减少标注成本。

Abstract: The global demand for medicinal plants, such as Damask roses, has surged with
population growth, yet labor-intensive harvesting remains a bottleneck for
scalability. To address this, we propose a novel 3D perception pipeline
tailored for flower-harvesting robots, focusing on sparse 3D localization of
rose centers. Our two-stage algorithm first performs 2D point-based detection
on stereo images, followed by depth estimation using a lightweight deep neural
network. To overcome the challenge of scarce real-world labeled data, we
introduce a photorealistic synthetic dataset generated via Blender, simulating
a dynamic rose farm environment with precise 3D annotations. This approach
minimizes manual labeling costs while enabling robust model training. We
evaluate two depth estimation paradigms: a traditional triangulation-based
method and our proposed deep learning framework. Results demonstrate the
superiority of our method, achieving an F1 score of 95.6% (synthetic) and 74.4%
(real) in 2D detection, with a depth estimation error of 3% at a 2-meter range
on synthetic data. The pipeline is optimized for computational efficiency,
ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained robotic systems. By bridging
the domain gap between synthetic and real-world data, this work advances
agricultural automation for specialty crops, offering a scalable solution for
precision harvesting.

Result: MTL在CAVs中展现出高效性和资源优化潜力，但仍存在研究空白，如实时性和多任务权衡问题。

Conclusion: MTL是CAVs领域的重要研究方向，未来需进一步优化方法以解决实际部署中的挑战。

Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) must simultaneously perform multiple
tasks, such as object detection, semantic segmentation, depth estimation,
trajectory prediction, motion prediction, and behaviour prediction, to ensure
safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Vehicle-to-everything
(V2X) communication enables cooperative driving among CAVs, thereby mitigating
the limitations of individual sensors, reducing occlusions, and improving
perception over long distances. Traditionally, these tasks are addressed using
distinct models, which leads to high deployment costs, increased computational
overhead, and challenges in achieving real-time performance. Multi-task
learning (MTL) has recently emerged as a promising solution that enables the
joint learning of multiple tasks within a single unified model. This offers
improved efficiency and resource utilization. To the best of our knowledge,
this survey is the first comprehensive review focused on MTL in the context of
CAVs. We begin with an overview of CAVs and MTL to provide foundational
background. We then explore the application of MTL across key functional
modules, including perception, prediction, planning, control, and multi-agent
collaboration. Finally, we discuss the strengths and limitations of existing
methods, identify key research gaps, and provide directions for future research
aimed at advancing MTL methodologies for CAV systems.

Result: 实验表明，Hestia在三个数据集和NVIDIA IsaacLab环境中表现稳健，并适合实际部署。

Conclusion: Hestia为智能自主数据收集提供了一种系统化的解决方案，并在真实场景中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Advances in 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis have enabled
efficient, photorealistic rendering, but the data collection process remains
largely manual, making it time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the
challenges, this study introduces Hierarchical Next-Best-View Exploration for
Systematic Intelligent Autonomous Data Collection (Hestia), which leverages
reinforcement learning to learn a generalizable policy for 5-DoF next-best
viewpoint prediction. Unlike prior approaches, Hestia systematically defines
the next-best-view task by proposing core components such as dataset choice,
observation design, action space, reward calculation, and learning schemes,
forming a foundation for the planner. Hestia goes beyond prior next-best-view
approaches and traditional capture systems through integration and validation
in a real-world setup, where a drone serves as a mobile sensor for active scene
exploration. Experimental results show that Hestia performs robustly across
three datasets and translated object settings in the NVIDIA IsaacLab
environment, and proves feasible for real-world deployment.

Abstract: The convergence of autonomous indoor drones with physics-aware sensing
technologies promises to transform property assessment from subjective visual
inspection to objective, quantitative measurement. This comprehensive review
examines the technical foundations enabling this paradigm shift across four
critical domains: (1) platform architectures optimized for indoor navigation,
where weight constraints drive innovations in heterogeneous computing,
collision-tolerant design, and hierarchical control systems; (2) advanced
sensing modalities that extend perception beyond human vision, including
hyperspectral imaging for material identification, polarimetric sensing for
surface characterization, and computational imaging with metaphotonics enabling
radical miniaturization; (3) intelligent autonomy through active reconstruction
algorithms, where drones equipped with 3D Gaussian Splatting make strategic
decisions about viewpoint selection to maximize information gain within battery
constraints; and (4) integration pathways with existing property workflows,
including Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems and industry standards
like Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6.

TL;DR: ScrewSplat提出了一种基于RGB图像的端到端方法，用于识别物体的几何和运动关节，无需额外输入或复杂步骤。

Result: 在多样化物体上实现最先进的识别精度，并支持零样本文本引导操作。

Conclusion: ScrewSplat是一种高效、实用的方法，适用于真实场景中的关节物体识别与操作。

Abstract: Articulated object recognition -- the task of identifying both the geometry
and kinematic joints of objects with movable parts -- is essential for enabling
robots to interact with everyday objects such as doors and laptops. However,
existing approaches often rely on strong assumptions, such as a known number of
articulated parts; require additional inputs, such as depth images; or involve
complex intermediate steps that can introduce potential errors -- limiting
their practicality in real-world settings. In this paper, we introduce
ScrewSplat, a simple end-to-end method that operates solely on RGB
observations. Our approach begins by randomly initializing screw axes, which
are then iteratively optimized to recover the object's underlying kinematic
structure. By integrating with Gaussian Splatting, we simultaneously
reconstruct the 3D geometry and segment the object into rigid, movable parts.
We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy
across a diverse set of articulated objects, and further enables zero-shot,
text-guided manipulation using the recovered kinematic model.

Conclusion: 矩匹配技术在稀疏和噪声环境下具有潜力，显著提升了点云配准的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a key step in robotic perception tasks, such as
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). It is especially challenging in
conditions with sparse points and heavy noise. Traditional registration
methods, such as Iterative Closest Point (ICP) and Normal Distributions
Transform (NDT), often have difficulties in achieving a robust and accurate
alignment under these conditions. In this paper, we propose a registration
framework based on moment matching. In particular, the point clouds are
regarded as i.i.d. samples drawn from the same distribution observed in the
source and target frames. We then match the generalized Gaussian Radial Basis
moments calculated from the point clouds to estimate the rigid transformation
between two frames. Moreover, such method does not require explicit
point-to-point correspondences among the point clouds. We further show the
consistency of the proposed method. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show that our approach achieves higher accuracy and robustness than
existing methods. In addition, we integrate our framework into a 4D Radar SLAM
system. The proposed method significantly improves the localization performance
and achieves results comparable to LiDAR-based systems. These findings
demonstrate the potential of moment matching technique for robust point cloud
registration in sparse and noisy scenarios.

Abstract: The control of robots for manipulation tasks generally relies on visual
input. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) enable the use of
natural language instructions to condition visual input and control robots in a
wider range of environments. However, existing methods require a large amount
of data to fine-tune VLMs for operating in unseen environments. In this paper,
we present a framework that learns object-arrangement tasks from just a few
demonstrations. We propose a two-stage framework that divides
object-arrangement tasks into a target localization stage, for picking the
object, and a region determination stage for placing the object. We present an
instance-level semantic fusion module that aligns the instance-level image
crops with the text embedding, enabling the model to identify the target
objects defined by the natural language instructions. We validate our method on
both simulation and real-world robotic environments. Our method, fine-tuned
with a few demonstrations, improves generalization capability and demonstrates
zero-shot ability in real-robot manipulation scenarios.

Motivation: 由于四足机器人的运动特性和传感器校准的复杂性，高质量全景训练数据稀缺，限制了其感知系统的发展。

Method: 提出Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE)捕捉垂直振动特征，Scene-Object Controller (SOC)管理对象运动，Panoramic Enhancer (PE)解决全景失真问题。

Result: 生成的视频序列可用于训练四足机器人的全景视觉感知模型，提升360度场景中的多目标跟踪性能。

Conclusion: QuaDreamer为四足机器人提供了高质量的全景数据生成方案，推动了其感知系统的进步。

Abstract: Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are
suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with
complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training
data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration
challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems
tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose
QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for
quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of
quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos,
providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively
capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during
quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts
controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and
provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video
generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller
(SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter
control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in
wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream
architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail
enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency.
We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training
data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the
performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes. The source code and
model weights will be publicly available at
https://github.com/losehu/QuaDreamer.

TL;DR: DBAIOps是一种结合推理LLM和知识图谱的混合数据库运维系统，旨在解决现有方法无法有效利用专家经验的问题，显著提升诊断准确性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有自动数据库运维方法（如基于规则或LLM的方法）无法有效整合专家经验，导致诊断结果不准确或泛化。

Method: DBAIOps通过异构图谱模型表示诊断经验，半自动构建图谱，开发800+可复用异常模型，并采用两阶段图谱演化机制结合推理LLM进行诊断。

Result: 在四种主流数据库系统中，DBAIOps在根因和人工评估准确率上分别比现有方法高34.85%和47.22%。

Conclusion: DBAIOps通过结合知识图谱和推理LLM，显著提升了数据库运维的自动化诊断能力。

Abstract: The operation and maintenance (O&M) of database systems is critical to
ensuring system availability and performance, typically requiring expert
experience (e.g., identifying metric-to-anomaly relations) for effective
diagnosis and recovery. However, existing automatic database O&M methods,
including commercial products, cannot effectively utilize expert experience. On
the one hand, rule-based methods only support basic O&M tasks (e.g.,
metric-based anomaly detection), which are mostly numerical equations and
cannot effectively incorporate literal O&M experience (e.g., troubleshooting
guidance in manuals). On the other hand, LLM-based methods, which retrieve
fragmented information (e.g., standard documents + RAG), often generate
inaccurate or generic results. To address these limitations, we present
DBAIOps, a novel hybrid database O&M system that combines reasoning LLMs with
knowledge graphs to achieve DBA-style diagnosis. First, DBAIOps introduces a
heterogeneous graph model for representing the diagnosis experience, and
proposes a semi-automatic graph construction algorithm to build that graph from
thousands of documents. Second, DBAIOps develops a collection of (800+)
reusable anomaly models that identify both directly alerted metrics and
implicitly correlated experience and metrics. Third, for each anomaly, DBAIOps
proposes a two-stage graph evolution mechanism to explore relevant diagnosis
paths and identify missing relations automatically. It then leverages a
reasoning LLM (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) to infer root causes and generate clear
diagnosis reports for both DBAs and common users. Our evaluation over four
mainstream database systems (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and DM8) demonstrates
that DBAIOps outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, 34.85% and 47.22% higher
in root cause and human evaluation accuracy, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督两阶段框架，用于MRI脑肿瘤分割，无需真实掩码，通过残差引导的DDPM和轻量级U-Net提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI脑肿瘤分割对临床诊断和治疗计划至关重要，但现有方法在更大、更异构的数据集上表现不足。

Method: 第一阶段使用残差引导DDPM进行跨模态合成，第二阶段用轻量级U-Net结合残差图和多模态输入优化分割。

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上，Dice得分为93.02%，IoU为86.7%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了分割精度和可扩展性，适用于多中心MRI数据集。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is critical for clinical
diagnosis and treatment planning. We propose a semi-supervised, two-stage
framework that extends the ReCoSeg approach to the larger and more
heterogeneous BraTS 2021 dataset, while eliminating the need for ground-truth
masks for the segmentation objective. In the first stage, a residual-guided
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) performs cross-modal synthesis
by reconstructing the T1ce modality from FLAIR, T1, and T2 scans. The residual
maps, capturing differences between predicted and actual T1ce images, serve as
spatial priors to enhance downstream segmentation. In the second stage, a
lightweight U-Net takes as input the concatenation of residual maps, computed
as the difference between real T1ce and synthesized T1ce, with T1, T2, and
FLAIR modalities to improve whole tumor segmentation. To address the increased
scale and variability of BraTS 2021, we apply slice-level filtering to exclude
non-informative samples and optimize thresholding strategies to balance
precision and recall. Our method achieves a Dice score of $93.02\%$ and an IoU
of $86.7\%$ for whole tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2021 dataset,
outperforming the ReCoSeg baseline on BraTS 2020 (Dice: $91.7\%$, IoU:
$85.3\%$), and demonstrating improved accuracy and scalability for real-world,
multi-center MRI datasets.

Motivation: 解决现有移动模型在医学图像任务上表现不佳的问题，因医学图像信息密度高且与自然图像差异大。

Result: 在8个公开2D和3D数据集上达到SOTA性能，包括零样本测试，证明其高效且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: Mobile U-ViT是移动医学图像分析的高效、强大且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: In clinical practice, medical image analysis often requires efficient
execution on resource-constrained mobile devices. However, existing mobile
models-primarily optimized for natural images-tend to perform poorly on medical
tasks due to the significant information density gap between natural and
medical domains. Combining computational efficiency with medical
imaging-specific architectural advantages remains a challenge when developing
lightweight, universal, and high-performing networks. To address this, we
propose a mobile model called Mobile U-shaped Vision Transformer (Mobile U-ViT)
tailored for medical image segmentation. Specifically, we employ the newly
purposed ConvUtr as a hierarchical patch embedding, featuring a
parameter-efficient large-kernel CNN with inverted bottleneck fusion. This
design exhibits transformer-like representation learning capacity while being
lighter and faster. To enable efficient local-global information exchange, we
introduce a novel Large-kernel Local-Global-Local (LGL) block that effectively
balances the low information density and high-level semantic discrepancy of
medical images. Finally, we incorporate a shallow and lightweight transformer
bottleneck for long-range modeling and employ a cascaded decoder with
downsample skip connections for dense prediction. Despite its reduced
computational demands, our medical-optimized architecture achieves
state-of-the-art performance across eight public 2D and 3D datasets covering
diverse imaging modalities, including zero-shot testing on four unseen
datasets. These results establish it as an efficient yet powerful and
generalization solution for mobile medical image analysis. Code is available at

Motivation: 评估VLMs在医学图像诊断中的潜力，为临床应用的可行性提供依据。

Method: 使用MedFMC数据集，比较五种VLMs在三种实验设置（仅视觉输入、多模态输入、思维链推理）下的诊断准确性。

Result: Qwen2.5在胸部X光和内窥镜图像中表现最佳，但在视网膜眼底检查中所有模型表现不佳。多模态输入和思维链推理未显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: 开源VLMs在医学诊断中具有潜力，但在复杂任务中仍需进一步优化和领域适配。

Abstract: This retrospective study evaluated five VLMs (Qwen2.5, Phi-4, Gemma3,
Llama3.2, and Mistral3.1) using the MedFMC dataset. This dataset includes
22,349 images from 7,461 patients encompassing chest radiography (19 disease
multi-label classifications), colon pathology (tumor detection), endoscopy
(colorectal lesion identification), neonatal jaundice assessment (skin
color-based treatment necessity), and retinal fundoscopy (5-point diabetic
retinopathy grading). Diagnostic accuracy was compared in three experimental
settings: visual input only, multimodal input, and chain-of-thought reasoning.
Model accuracy was assessed against ground truth labels, with statistical
comparisons using bootstrapped confidence intervals (p<.05). Qwen2.5 achieved
the highest accuracy for chest radiographs (90.4%) and endoscopy images
(84.2%), significantly outperforming the other models (p<.001). In colon
pathology, Qwen2.5 (69.0%) and Phi-4 (69.6%) performed comparably (p=.41), both
significantly exceeding other VLMs (p<.001). Similarly, for neonatal jaundice
assessment, Qwen2.5 (58.3%) and Phi-4 (58.1%) showed comparable leading
accuracies (p=.93) significantly exceeding their counterparts (p<.001). All
models struggled with retinal fundoscopy; Qwen2.5 and Gemma3 achieved the
highest, albeit modest, accuracies at 18.6% (comparable, p=.99), significantly
better than other tested models (p<.001). Unexpectedly, multimodal input
reduced accuracy for some models and modalities, and chain-of-thought reasoning
prompts also failed to improve accuracy. The open-source VLMs demonstrated
promising diagnostic capabilities, particularly in chest radiograph
interpretation. However, performance in complex domains such as retinal
fundoscopy was limited, underscoring the need for further development and
domain-specific adaptation before widespread clinical application.

Conclusion: CoCoLIT为阿尔茨海默病筛查提供了一种高效、低成本的方法，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible
structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for
large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence
that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless
encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered
through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural
complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing
MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a
lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more
effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned
Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that
incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss
(WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2)
a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an
existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference
consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for
MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available
datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in
amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method
with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external
dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测在复杂背景中存在挑战，传统卷积方法难以区分目标和背景的频域特征。

Method: SWAN框架包括Haar小波卷积（HWConv）、移位空间注意力（SSA）和残差双通道注意力（RDCA）模块，分别用于频域融合、长程空间依赖建模和通道特征校准。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，SWAN优于现有方法，尤其在复杂场景中表现出更高的检测精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SWAN通过多域协同和注意力机制，有效解决了复杂背景下的红外小目标检测问题。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is thus critical in both civilian and
military applications. This study addresses the challenge of precisely IRSTD in
complex backgrounds. Recent methods focus fundamental reliance on conventional
convolution operations, which primarily capture local spatial patterns and
struggle to distinguish the unique frequency-domain characteristics of small
targets from intricate background clutter. To overcome these limitations, we
proposed the Synergistic Wavelet-Attention Network (SWAN), a novel framework
designed to perceive targets from both spatial and frequency domains. SWAN
leverages a Haar Wavelet Convolution (HWConv) for a deep, cross-domain fusion
of the frequency energy and spatial details of small target. Furthermore, a
Shifted Spatial Attention (SSA) mechanism efficiently models long-range spatial
dependencies with linear computational complexity, enhancing contextual
awareness. Finally, a Residual Dual-Channel Attention (RDCA) module adaptively
calibrates channel-wise feature responses to suppress background interference
while amplifying target-pertinent signals. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that SWAN surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods,
showing significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness,
particularly in complex challenging scenarios.

Abstract: The use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has greatly improved the

study compared EfficientNetV2 with its predecessor, EfficientNet, and with
ResNet50 in classifying brain tumors into three types: glioma, meningioma, and
pituitary tumors. Results showed that EfficientNetV2 delivered superior
performance compared to the other models. However, this improvement came at the
cost of increased training time, likely due to the model's greater complexity.

Method: 结合ViT基础模型和ABMIL架构，训练并验证模型在印度和TCGA数据集上的性能。

Result: 模型在内部和外部测试集上的AUC分别为0.933和0.965，表现优于先前研究。

Conclusion: 该框架能高效利用小数据集预测EGFR突变，适用于资源有限环境，展示了AI在病理学中的潜力。

Abstract: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a subtype of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). LUAD with mutation in the EGFR gene accounts for approximately 46% of
LUAD cases. Patients carrying EGFR mutations can be treated with specific
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Hence, predicting EGFR mutation status can
help in clinical decision making. H&E-stained whole slide imaging (WSI) is a
routinely performed screening procedure for cancer staging and subtyping,
especially affecting the Southeast Asian populations with significantly higher
incidence of the mutation when compared to Caucasians (39-64% vs 7-22%). Recent
progress in AI models has shown promising results in cancer detection and
classification. In this study, we propose a deep learning (DL) framework built
on vision transformers (ViT) based pathology foundation model and
attention-based multiple instance learning (ABMIL) architecture to predict EGFR
mutation status from H&E WSI. The developed pipeline was trained using data
from an Indian cohort (170 WSI) and evaluated across two independent datasets:
Internal test (30 WSI from Indian cohort) set, and an external test set from
TCGA (86 WSI). The model shows consistent performance across both datasets,
with AUCs of 0.933 (+/-0.010), and 0.965 (+/-0.015) for the internal and
external test sets respectively. This proposed framework can be efficiently
trained on small datasets, achieving superior performance as compared to
several prior studies irrespective of training domain. The current study
demonstrates the feasibility of accurately predicting EGFR mutation status
using routine pathology slides, particularly in resource-limited settings using
foundation models and attention-based multiple instance learning.

*Mehreen Kanwal,Yunsik Son*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种深度监督多任务自编码器（DSMT-AE）框架，用于从3D MRI中准确估计大脑年龄，并同时优化性别分类和图像重建任务，显著提升了预测准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物大脑年龄的准确估计是神经退行性疾病的重要生物标志物，但现有方法在优化3D模型和考虑性别差异方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用深度监督和多任务学习，同时优化大脑年龄预测、性别分类和图像重建任务，以增强特征表示和模型稳定性。

Result: 在OpenBHB数据集上，DSMT-AE实现了最先进的性能，并在不同年龄和性别子组中表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DSMT-AE框架通过多任务学习和深度监督显著提升了大脑年龄预测的准确性和鲁棒性，为神经影像学研究提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of biological brain age from three dimensional (3D)
T$_1$-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical imaging biomarker
for identifying accelerated aging associated with neurodegenerative diseases.
Effective brain age prediction necessitates training 3D models to leverage
comprehensive insights from volumetric MRI scans, thereby fully capturing
spatial anatomical context. However, optimizing deep 3D models remains
challenging due to problems such as vanishing gradients. Furthermore, brain
structural patterns differ significantly between sexes, which impacts aging
trajectories and vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases, thereby making
sex classification crucial for enhancing the accuracy and generalizability of
predictive models. To address these challenges, we propose a Deeply Supervised
Multitask Autoencoder (DSMT-AE) framework for brain age estimation. DSMT-AE
employs deep supervision, which involves applying supervisory signals at
intermediate layers during training, to stabilize model optimization, and
multitask learning to enhance feature representation. Specifically, our
framework simultaneously optimizes brain age prediction alongside auxiliary
tasks of sex classification and image reconstruction, thus effectively
capturing anatomical and demographic variability to improve prediction
accuracy. We extensively evaluate DSMT-AE on the Open Brain Health Benchmark
(OpenBHB) dataset, the largest multisite neuroimaging cohort combining ten
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that DSMT-AE achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robustness across age and sex subgroups.
Additionally, our ablation study confirms that each proposed component
substantially contributes to the improved predictive accuracy and robustness of
the overall architecture.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于纤维束追踪的双标签协作学习网络（DCLNet），用于多模态颅神经分割，通过结合粗标签和精确标签提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态融合方法对扩散MRI信息利用不足，导致分割性能较低。

Method: 提出DCLNet，引入纤维束追踪生成的粗标签与专家标注的精确标签协作学习，并设计模态自适应编码模块（MEM）实现结构MRI与扩散MRI的软信息交换。

Result: 在HCP数据集上的实验表明，DCLNet性能优于单标签网络。

Conclusion: 双标签策略能有效解决颅神经分割任务中的固有模糊性问题。

Abstract: The parcellation of Cranial Nerves (CNs) serves as a crucial quantitative
methodology for evaluating the morphological characteristics and anatomical
pathways of specific CNs. Multi-modal CNs parcellation networks have achieved
promising segmentation performance, which combine structural Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) and diffusion MRI. However, insufficient exploration of diffusion
MRI information has led to low performance of existing multi-modal fusion. In
this work, we propose a tractography-guided Dual-label Collaborative Learning
Network (DCLNet) for multi-modal CNs parcellation. The key contribution of our
DCLNet is the introduction of coarse labels of CNs obtained from fiber
tractography through CN atlas, and collaborative learning with precise labels
annotated by experts. Meanwhile, we introduce a Modality-adaptive Encoder
Module (MEM) to achieve soft information swapping between structural MRI and
diffusion MRI. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available Human
Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate performance improvements compared
to single-label network. This systematic validation underscores the
effectiveness of dual-label strategies in addressing inherent ambiguities in
CNs parcellation tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种预测病理学家注意力轨迹的方法，通过两阶段模型预测其在全切片图像（WSI）中的动态注意力分配，以辅助病理学培训。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测专家病理学家的注意力轨迹可以开发决策支持系统，帮助病理学培训。

Result: 实验表明，该扫描路径预测模型优于随机和基线模型。

Conclusion: 该模型工具可帮助病理学学员学习如何像专家一样分配注意力。

Abstract: The ability to predict the attention of expert pathologists could lead to
decision support systems for better pathology training. We developed methods to
predict the spatio-temporal (where and when) movements of pathologists'
attention as they grade whole slide images (WSIs) of prostate cancer. We
characterize a pathologist's attention trajectory by their x, y, and m
(magnification) movements of a viewport as they navigate WSIs using a digital
microscope. This information was obtained from 43 pathologists across 123 WSIs,
and we consider the task of predicting the pathologist attention scanpaths
constructed from the viewport centers. We introduce a fixation extraction
algorithm that simplifies an attention trajectory by extracting fixations in
the pathologist's viewing while preserving semantic information, and we use
these pre-processed data to train and test a two-stage model to predict the
dynamic (scanpath) allocation of attention during WSI reading via intermediate
attention heatmap prediction. In the first stage, a transformer-based
sub-network predicts the attention heatmaps (static attention) across different
magnifications. In the second stage, we predict the attention scanpath by
sequentially modeling the next fixation points in an autoregressive manner
using a transformer-based approach, starting at the WSI center and leveraging
multi-magnification feature representations from the first stage. Experimental
results show that our scanpath prediction model outperforms chance and baseline
models. Tools developed from this model could assist pathology trainees in
learning to allocate their attention during WSI reading like an expert.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于LoRA的改进方法（CP-LoRA和DoRA变体），用于动脉瘤性蛛网膜下腔出血（SAH）的医学图像分割，显著优于传统Unet微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动脉瘤性SAH是一种高死亡率的神经系统急症，现有方法在有限数据集上表现不佳，而基于LoRA的参数高效迁移学习方法在医学图像领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 采用预训练的Unet架构，基于124例创伤性脑损伤患者的CT扫描数据，并在30例SAH患者数据上进行微调。提出了CP-LoRA和DoRA变体方法，分解权重矩阵为幅度和方向分量。

Result: LoRA方法在SAH分割任务中表现优于传统微调，CP-LoRA在参数效率上表现突出，且高秩参数化效果更佳。

Conclusion: 研究表明，不同血肿类型间的迁移学习可行，且LoRA方法显著提升了SAH分割的准确性。

Abstract: Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a life-threatening neurological
emergency with mortality rates exceeding 30%. Transfer learning from related
hematoma types represents a potentially valuable but underexplored approach.
Although Unet architectures remain the gold standard for medical image
segmentation due to their effectiveness on limited datasets, Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) methods for parameter-efficient transfer learning have been
rarely applied to convolutional neural networks in medical imaging contexts. We
implemented a Unet architecture pre-trained on computed tomography scans from
124 traumatic brain injury patients across multiple institutions, then
fine-tuned on 30 aneurysmal SAH patients from the University of Michigan Health
System using 3-fold cross-validation. We developed a novel CP-LoRA method based
on tensor CP-decomposition and introduced DoRA variants (DoRA-C, convDoRA,
CP-DoRA) that decompose weight matrices into magnitude and directional
components. We compared these approaches against existing LoRA methods (LoRA-C,
convLoRA) and standard fine-tuning strategies across different modules on a
multi-view Unet model. LoRA-based methods consistently outperformed standard
Unet fine-tuning. Performance varied by hemorrhage volume, with all methods
showing improved accuracy for larger volumes. CP-LoRA achieved comparable
performance to existing methods while using significantly fewer parameters.
Over-parameterization with higher ranks consistently yielded better performance
than strictly low-rank adaptations. This study demonstrates that transfer
learning between hematoma types is feasible and that LoRA-based methods
significantly outperform conventional Unet fine-tuning for aneurysmal SAH
segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型（LLM）的压缩方法在医学图像上表现不佳，且忽视安全性。

Method: 采用自适应模态分解策略和双路径无损压缩，结合分段隐写算法和A-LoRA微调策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在压缩比、效率和安全性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为医学图像压缩提供了高效且安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have driven promis ing progress in
lossless image compression. However, di rectly adopting existing paradigms for
medical images suf fers from an unsatisfactory trade-off between compression
  performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing LLM-based
  compressors often overlook the security of the compres sion process, which is
critical in modern medical scenarios.
  To this end, we propose a novel joint lossless compression
  and steganography framework. Inspired by bit plane slicing
  (BPS), we find it feasible to securely embed privacy messages
  into medical images in an invisible manner. Based on this in sight, an
adaptive modalities decomposition strategy is first
  devised to partition the entire image into two segments, pro viding global
and local modalities for subsequent dual-path
  lossless compression. During this dual-path stage, we inno vatively propose a
segmented message steganography algo rithm within the local modality path to
ensure the security of
  the compression process. Coupled with the proposed anatom ical priors-based
low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning
  strategy, extensive experimental results demonstrate the su periority of our
proposed method in terms of compression ra tios, efficiency, and security. The
source code will be made
  publicly available.

Motivation: 准确的乳腺肿瘤分割对下游任务（如pCR评估）至关重要，但现有方法在性能和泛化能力上仍有提升空间。

Method: 采用大核MedNeXt架构和UpKern算法，逐步扩大感受野；使用SNN对分割结果提取的放射组学特征进行分类。

Result: 分割任务中Dice得分为0.67，NormHD为0.24；pCR分类的平均平衡准确率为57%，部分子组达75%。

Conclusion: 大感受野与放射组学结合有效，未来可进一步优化集成方法和临床变量整合以提升性能。

Abstract: Accurate breast tumor segmentation in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic
resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is important for downstream tasks such as
pathological complete response (pCR) assessment. In this work, we address both
segmentation and pCR classification using the large-scale MAMA-MIA DCE-MRI
dataset. We employ a large-kernel MedNeXt architecture with a two-stage
training strategy that expands the receptive field from 3x3x3 to 5x5x5 kernels
using the UpKern algorithm. This approach allows stable transfer of learned
features to larger kernels, improving segmentation performance on the unseen
validation set. An ensemble of large-kernel models achieved a Dice score of
0.67 and a normalized Hausdorff Distance (NormHD) of 0.24. For pCR
classification, we trained a self-normalizing network (SNN) on radiomic
features extracted from the predicted segmentations and first post-contrast
DCE-MRI, reaching an average balanced accuracy of 57\%, and up to 75\% in some
subgroups. Our findings highlight the benefits of combining larger receptive
fields and radiomics-driven classification while motivating future work on
advanced ensembling and the integration of clinical variables to further
improve performance and generalization. Code:

Motivation: 探索如何将遥感领域的先进模型（如AMBER）应用于医疗图像分割任务，以提升效率并减少计算资源需求。

Method: 使用AMBER架构，以AFNO替代多头自注意力机制，通过频域混合捕获全局上下文，减少模型参数和计算量。

Result: 在ACDC和Synapse数据集上，AMBER-AFNO在DSC和HD指标上表现优异，参数减少80%，训练和推理效率显著提升。

Conclusion: AMBER-AFNO在医疗图像分割中实现了高效且高性能的解决方案，为模型轻量化提供了新思路。

Abstract: This work presents the results of a methodological transfer from remote
sensing to healthcare, adapting AMBER -- a transformer-based model originally
designed for multiband images, such as hyperspectral data -- to the task of 3D
medical datacube segmentation. In this study, we use the AMBER architecture
with Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators (AFNO) in place of the multi-head
self-attention mechanism. While existing models rely on various forms of
attention to capture global context, AMBER-AFNO achieves this through
frequency-domain mixing, enabling a drastic reduction in model complexity. This
design reduces the number of trainable parameters by over 80% compared to
UNETR++, while maintaining a FLOPs count comparable to other state-of-the-art
architectures. Model performance is evaluated on two benchmark 3D medical
datasets -- ACDC and Synapse -- using standard metrics such as Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC) and Hausdorff Distance (HD), demonstrating that AMBER-AFNO
achieves competitive or superior accuracy with significant gains in training
efficiency, inference speed, and memory usage.

Motivation: 解决临床影像中肿瘤分类的挑战，如模态质量不均、标注有限和缺乏结构化解剖指导。

Method: 采用双教师设计，分别利用双示踪PET/CT和低剂量CT数据，通过语义对齐和区域图蒸馏指导学生模型，并使用共享CBAM-3D模块保持注意力一致性。

Result: 在肝癌分期任务中，内部PET/CT队列平均AUC达93.4%，外部CT测试中AUC保持在76.6%至81.5%。

Conclusion: REACT-KD在临床决策中表现优异，具有实际诊断潜力。

Abstract: Reliable and interpretable tumor classification from clinical imaging remains
a core challenge due to heterogeneous modality quality, limited annotations,
and the lack of structured anatomical guidance. We introduce REACT-KD, a
Region-Aware Cross-modal Topological Knowledge Distillation framework that
transfers rich supervision from high-fidelity multi-modal sources into a
lightweight CT-based student model. The framework uses a dual teacher design:
one branch captures structure-function relationships using dual-tracer PET/CT,
and the other models dose-aware features through synthetically degraded
low-dose CT data. These branches jointly guide the student model through two
complementary objectives. The first focuses on semantic alignment via logits
distillation, while the second models anatomical topology using region graph
distillation. A shared CBAM-3D module is employed to maintain consistent
attention across modalities. To improve reliability for deployment, REACT-KD
introduces modality dropout during training, allowing inference under partial
or noisy inputs. The staging task for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is
conducted as a case study. REACT-KD achieves an average AUC of 93.4% on an
internal PET/CT cohort and maintains 76.6% to 81.5% AUC across varying dose
levels in external CT testing. Decision curve analysis shows that REACT-KD
consistently provides the highest clinical benefit across decision thresholds,
supporting its potential in real-world diagnostics. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有的RIC方法由于引入随机变量而存在不适定性问题，限制了其性能。

Method: 提出了一种基于超定系统的可逆1×1卷积（WIC），并设计了两种网络（WIN-Naïve和WIN），其中WIN通过高级跳跃连接增强长期记忆。

Result: 在多种RIC任务中（如图像隐藏、图像缩放和图像去色）均实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效克服了现有RIC解决方案的瓶颈，为领域设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Reversible image conversion (RIC) suffers from ill-posedness issues due to
its forward conversion process being considered an underdetermined system.
Despite employing invertible neural networks (INN), existing RIC methods
intrinsically remain ill-posed as inevitably introducing uncertainty by
incorporating randomly sampled variables. To tackle the ill-posedness dilemma,
we focus on developing a reliable approximate left inverse for the
underdetermined system by constructing an overdetermined system with a non-zero
Gram determinant, thus ensuring a well-posed solution. Based on this principle,
we propose a well-posed invertible $1\times1$ convolution (WIC), which
eliminates the reliance on random variable sampling and enables the development
of well-posed invertible networks. Furthermore, we design two innovative
networks, WIN-Na\"ive and WIN, with the latter incorporating advanced
skip-connections to enhance long-term memory. Our methods are evaluated across
diverse RIC tasks, including reversible image hiding, image rescaling, and
image decolorization, consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
its ability to overcome the bottlenecks of existing RIC solutions and setting a
new benchmark in the field. Codes are available in

Conclusion: GR-Gaussian在稀疏视图条件下显著提高了CT重建的准确性和适用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising approach for CT
reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on the average gradient
magnitude of points within the view, often leading to severe needle-like
artifacts under sparse-view conditions. To address this challenge, we propose
GR-Gaussian, a graph-based 3D Gaussian Splatting framework that suppresses
needle-like artifacts and improves reconstruction accuracy under sparse-view
conditions. Our framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a Denoised Point
Cloud Initialization Strategy that reduces initialization errors and
accelerates convergence; and (2) a Pixel-Graph-Aware Gradient Strategy that
refines gradient computation using graph-based density differences, improving
splitting accuracy and density representation. Experiments on X-3D and
real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of GR-Gaussian, achieving PSNR
improvements of 0.67 dB and 0.92 dB, and SSIM gains of 0.011 and 0.021. These
results highlight the applicability of GR-Gaussian for accurate CT
reconstruction under challenging sparse-view conditions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多种多实例学习（MIL）技术，用于检测非小细胞肺癌（NSCLC）的六种关键驱动突变，并提出了一种新型非对称Transformer解码器模型，显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基因检测对NSCLC治疗决策至关重要，但其广泛应用受限于可用性和耗时问题。机器学习方法虽具潜力，但现有研究多聚焦于少数常见突变，临床价值有限。

Method: 研究采用多实例学习技术，并引入非对称Transformer解码器模型，利用不同维度的查询和键值对提取信息，同时直接整合组织类型信息。

Conclusion: 该研究通过改进MIL技术和引入新模型，显著提升了NSCLC驱动突变的检测能力，为临床提供了更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Identifying actionable driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
can impact treatment decisions and significantly improve patient outcomes.
Despite guideline recommendations, broader adoption of genetic testing remains
challenging due to limited availability and lengthy turnaround times. Machine
Learning (ML) methods for Computational Pathology (CPath) offer a potential
solution; however, research often focuses on only one or two common mutations,
limiting the clinical value of these tools and the pool of patients who can
benefit from them. This study evaluates various Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) techniques to detect six key actionable NSCLC driver mutations: ALK,
BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and MET ex14. Additionally, we introduce an Asymmetric
Transformer Decoder model that employs queries and key-values of varying
dimensions to maintain a low query dimensionality. This approach efficiently
extracts information from patch embeddings and minimizes overfitting risks,
proving highly adaptable to the MIL setting. Moreover, we present a method to
directly utilize tissue type in the model, addressing a typical MIL limitation
where either all regions or only some specific regions are analyzed, neglecting
biological relevance. Our method outperforms top MIL models by an average of
3%, and over 4% when predicting rare mutations such as ERBB2 and BRAF, moving
ML-based tests closer to being practical alternatives to standard genetic
testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: H&E染色缺乏分子诊断信息，而IHC染色成本高且耗时。虚拟染色技术有望填补这一空白，但面临评估不公和结构保持的挑战。

Method: 提出Star-Diff模型，结合残差和噪声生成路径，保持组织结构的同时模拟生物标志物变异性，并引入SFS评估诊断一致性。

Result: 在BCI数据集上，Star-Diff在视觉保真度和诊断相关性上均达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Star-Diff为虚拟IHC合成提供了一种快速且临床实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is the clinical standard for assessing
tissue morphology, but it lacks molecular-level diagnostic information. In
contrast, immunohistochemistry (IHC) provides crucial insights into biomarker
expression, such as HER2 status for breast cancer grading, but remains costly
and time-consuming, limiting its use in time-sensitive clinical workflows. To
address this gap, virtual staining from H&E to IHC has emerged as a promising
alternative, yet faces two core challenges: (1) Lack of fair evaluation of
synthetic images against misaligned IHC ground truths, and (2) preserving
structural integrity and biological variability during translation. To this
end, we present an end-to-end framework encompassing both generation and
evaluation in this work. We introduce Star-Diff, a structure-aware staining
restoration diffusion model that reformulates virtual staining as an image
restoration task. By combining residual and noise-based generation pathways,
Star-Diff maintains tissue structure while modeling realistic biomarker
variability. To evaluate the diagnostic consistency of the generated IHC
patches, we propose the Semantic Fidelity Score (SFS), a
clinical-grading-task-driven metric that quantifies class-wise semantic
degradation based on biomarker classification accuracy. Unlike pixel-level
metrics such as SSIM and PSNR, SFS remains robust under spatial misalignment
and classifier uncertainty. Experiments on the BCI dataset demonstrate that
Star-Diff achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both visual fidelity
and diagnostic relevance. With rapid inference and strong clinical alignment,it
presents a practical solution for applications such as intraoperative virtual
IHC synthesis.

Abstract: Accurate whole-heart segmentation is a critical component in the precise
diagnosis and interventional planning of cardiovascular diseases. Integrating
complementary information from modalities such as computed tomography (CT) and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can significantly enhance segmentation
accuracy and robustness. However, existing multi-modal segmentation methods
face several limitations: severe spatial inconsistency between modalities
hinders effective feature fusion; fusion strategies are often static and lack
adaptability; and the processes of feature alignment and segmentation are
decoupled and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose a
dual-branch U-Net architecture enhanced by reinforcement learning for feature
alignment, termed RL-U$^2$Net, designed for precise and efficient multi-modal
3D whole-heart segmentation. The model employs a dual-branch U-shaped network
to process CT and MRI patches in parallel, and introduces a novel RL-XAlign
module between the encoders. The module employs a cross-modal attention
mechanism to capture semantic correspondences between modalities and a
reinforcement-learning agent learns an optimal rotation strategy that
consistently aligns anatomical pose and texture features. The aligned features
are then reconstructed through their respective decoders. Finally, an
ensemble-learning-based decision module integrates the predictions from
individual patches to produce the final segmentation result. Experimental
results on the publicly available MM-WHS 2017 dataset demonstrate that the
proposed RL-U$^2$Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving
Dice coefficients of 93.1% on CT and 87.0% on MRI, thereby validating the
effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.
