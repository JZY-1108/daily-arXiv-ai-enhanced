Under review", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve\nlarge language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on\nmath and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to\ngeneral reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL\nreward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated\nRL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning\ndomains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built\nthrough domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure\nreliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically\nrevisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant\nvariation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL\nprimarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal\na more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,\nScience) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with\nlimited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain\ntraining to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely\nto facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and\nGuru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open\nmodels RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by\n7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We\nalso show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their\nbase models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining\ndata.

Quantitative Structural\nModel (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree\nstructural reconstruction.

This study presents a novel unified framework that enables\nend-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative\ngraph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree\nsegmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through\ndedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology\nreasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf\nconditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and\ndata sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results\ndemonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in\nleaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with\npartial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the\nproposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,\nnon-destructive AGB estimation.

We propose Evolutionary Caching to\nAccelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,\nper-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set\nof calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or\nreference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables\nfine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly\nto different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize\neffectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We\nevaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple\nmetrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,\nPartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.\nOn PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous\nstate-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup\nfrom 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable\napproach for accelerating diffusion inference.

AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning\nmodel to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the\nreasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified\nrule set.

However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on\nutilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in\nexisting time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for\nmodels to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,\nsuch as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends\nbeyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed\npositional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical\ninformation into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key\ninnovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping\nphysics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding\nmechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and\nsequential order of tokens within the embedding space.

We then introduce a taxonomy of dense\nlatents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,\nentropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and\nprincipal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features\nevolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early\nlayers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented\nsignals in the last layers of the model.

This study\npresents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning\nmodels for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over\n3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was\ncurated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation\nand normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks\n(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural\nNetwork (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The\nmodels were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to\nreduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in\naccuracy.

Incorrect\nvisualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information\nconveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual\nbugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause\nobvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data\ngraphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good\nunderstanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is\nessential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz\nlibraries.\n  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz\nlibraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our\nstudy systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a\ndetailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in\nDataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,\nwhich necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.\nMoreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test\noracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in\ndesigning effective automated testing techniques.

Recently, a variant of IL, called\nIn-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant\npolicies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform\na new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale\ndemonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined\nby hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally\ngenerates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To\nalleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning\nalgorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's\nt-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of\ninstant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP\ngenerates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an\nLLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial\nfor ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory\nagainst hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both\nsimulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\\%$ improvement in task success\nrates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks.

Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training\nwith numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these\nlarge-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as\ndata scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes\nscarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we\npropose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We\noptimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image\npairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are\nused for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and\nevaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new\nbenchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch).

In this paper, we\nintroduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement\nlearning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.\nBuilt upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score\nfunction to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our\nNabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D\nreward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning\nbaselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,\nNabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting\nwithin a few finetuning steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "Nabla-R2D3\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76843D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72D\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u7eb9\u7406\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eNabla-GFlowNet\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u75282D\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u5bf93D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNabla-R2D3\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u6b65\u9aa4\u5185\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5148\u9a8c\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "Nabla-R2D3\u4e3a3D\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}
