### [1] [Interpreting Public Sentiment in Diplomacy Events: A Counterfactual Analysis Framework Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20367)
*Leyi Ouyang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个通过修改外交事件叙述框架来转变公众情绪的新方法，使用语言模型预测公众反应并生成反事实叙述，成功将负面情绪转为中性或正面的成功率达70%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公众情绪在外交中至关重要，但传统调查方法耗时费力且缺乏前瞻性分析能力，需要一种更高效的方法来优化外交事件叙述。

Method: 训练语言模型预测公众对外交事件的反应，基于沟通理论和专家意见确定文本修改特征，开发反事实生成算法系统性地产生修改版本。

Result: 该框架成功将公众情绪转向更有利状态，成功率达到70%。

Conclusion: 该框架可作为外交官、政策制定者和传播专家的实用工具，提供数据驱动的见解来优化外交事件叙述框架。

Abstract: Diplomatic events consistently prompt widespread public discussion and
debate. Public sentiment plays a critical role in diplomacy, as a good
sentiment provides vital support for policy implementation, helps resolve
international issues, and shapes a nation's international image. Traditional
methods for gauging public sentiment, such as large-scale surveys or manual
content analysis of media, are typically time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
lack the capacity for forward-looking analysis. We propose a novel framework
that identifies specific modifications for diplomatic event narratives to shift
public sentiment from negative to neutral or positive. First, we train a
language model to predict public reaction towards diplomatic events. To this
end, we construct a dataset comprising descriptions of diplomatic events and
their associated public discussions. Second, guided by communication theories
and in collaboration with domain experts, we predetermined several textual
features for modification, ensuring that any alterations changed the event's
narrative framing while preserving its core facts.We develop a counterfactual
generation algorithm that employs a large language model to systematically
produce modified versions of an original text. The results show that this
framework successfully shifted public sentiment to a more favorable state with
a 70\% success rate. This framework can therefore serve as a practical tool for
diplomats, policymakers, and communication specialists, offering data-driven
insights on how to frame diplomatic initiatives or report on events to foster a
more desirable public sentiment.

### [2] [Speaker Style-Aware Phoneme Anchoring for Improved Cross-Lingual Speech Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20373)
*Shreya G. Upadhyay,Carlos Busso,Chi-Chun Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于说话人风格感知的音素锚定框架，用于跨语言语音情感识别，通过图聚类构建情感特定的说话人社区，并在说话人和音素空间进行双空间锚定，提升跨语言情感迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨语言语音情感识别面临不同语言间音素变异性和说话人表达风格的差异，需要能够对齐不同说话人和语言间情感外化的框架。

Method: 使用图聚类构建情感特定的说话人社区，捕捉共享的说话人特征，然后在说话人和音素空间进行双空间锚定，实现跨语言情感迁移。

Result: 在MSP-Podcast（英语）和BIIC-Podcast（台湾普通话）语料库上的评估显示，相比竞争基线方法具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了跨语言情感识别的性能，并为跨语言情感表征的共同性提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Cross-lingual speech emotion recognition (SER) remains a challenging task due
to differences in phonetic variability and speaker-specific expressive styles
across languages. Effectively capturing emotion under such diverse conditions
requires a framework that can align the externalization of emotions across
different speakers and languages. To address this problem, we propose a
speaker-style aware phoneme anchoring framework that aligns emotional
expression at the phonetic and speaker levels. Our method builds
emotion-specific speaker communities via graph-based clustering to capture
shared speaker traits. Using these groups, we apply dual-space anchoring in
speaker and phonetic spaces to enable better emotion transfer across languages.
Evaluations on the MSP-Podcast (English) and BIIC-Podcast (Taiwanese Mandarin)
corpora demonstrate improved generalization over competitive baselines and
provide valuable insights into the commonalities in cross-lingual emotion
representation.

### [3] [CFD-LLMBench: A Benchmark Suite for Evaluating Large Language Models in Computational Fluid Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20374)
*Nithin Somasekharan,Ling Yue,Yadi Cao,Weichao Li,Patrick Emami,Pochinapeddi Sai Bhargav,Anurag Acharya,Xingyu Xie,Shaowu Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CFDLLMBench是一个用于评估大语言模型在计算流体动力学领域能力的基准测试套件，包含三个组件，旨在全面测试LLM在CFD知识、推理和工作流实现方面的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLM在通用NLP任务中表现出色，但在自动化复杂物理系统数值实验方面的应用仍未被充分探索。计算流体动力学作为计算科学的重要工具，为评估LLM的科学能力提供了独特挑战。

Method: 开发了包含CFDQuery、CFDCodeBench和FoamBench三个组件的基准测试套件，分别评估CFD研究生水平知识、数值物理推理能力以及上下文相关的CFD工作流实现。

Result: 该基准测试基于真实CFD实践，结合详细任务分类和严格评估框架，提供可重现结果，量化LLM在代码可执行性、解决方案准确性和数值收敛行为方面的表现。

Conclusion: CFDLLMBench为开发LLM驱动的复杂物理系统数值实验自动化建立了坚实基础，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
general NLP tasks, but their utility in automating numerical experiments of
complex physical system -- a critical and labor-intensive component -- remains
underexplored. As the major workhorse of computational science over the past
decades, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers a uniquely challenging
testbed for evaluating the scientific capabilities of LLMs. We introduce
CFDLLMBench, a benchmark suite comprising three complementary components --
CFDQuery, CFDCodeBench, and FoamBench -- designed to holistically evaluate LLM
performance across three key competencies: graduate-level CFD knowledge,
numerical and physical reasoning of CFD, and context-dependent implementation
of CFD workflows. Grounded in real-world CFD practices, our benchmark combines
a detailed task taxonomy with a rigorous evaluation framework to deliver
reproducible results and quantify LLM performance across code executability,
solution accuracy, and numerical convergence behavior. CFDLLMBench establishes
a solid foundation for the development and evaluation of LLM-driven automation
of numerical experiments for complex physical systems. Code and data are
available at https://github.com/NREL-Theseus/cfdllmbench/.

### [4] [Assessing Classical Machine Learning and Transformer-based Approaches for Detecting AI-Generated Research Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20375)
*Sharanya Parimanoharan,Ruwan D. Nawarathna*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了多种机器学习方法检测ChatGPT-3.5生成的学术摘要的能力，发现DistilBERT表现最佳，而集成学习未能超越单一最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着ChatGPT等大语言模型的广泛应用，区分AI生成文本与人类写作变得至关重要，涉及学术诚信、知识产权和错误信息传播等问题。

Method: 使用250对研究摘要数据集，测试了传统方法（逻辑回归+BOW/POS/TF-IDF）和基于Transformer的方法（BERT+N-gram、DistilBERT、BERT+轻量分类器、LSTM+N-gram），并尝试了集成学习。

Result: DistilBERT获得最佳性能，逻辑回归和BERT-Custom提供均衡替代方案，LSTM和BERT-N-gram表现较差。三种最佳模型的集成学习未能超越DistilBERT本身。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的单一表示优于模型多样性，为开发更强大的检测框架奠定了基础，需要更大更丰富的数据集来应对不断改进的生成式AI模型。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has
blurred the line between human and AI-generated texts, raising urgent questions
about academic integrity, intellectual property, and the spread of
misinformation. Thus, reliable AI-text detection is needed for fair assessment
to safeguard human authenticity and cultivate trust in digital communication.
In this study, we investigate how well current machine learning (ML) approaches
can distinguish ChatGPT-3.5-generated texts from human-written texts employing
a labeled data set of 250 pairs of abstracts from a wide range of research
topics. We test and compare both classical (Logistic Regression armed with
classical Bag-of-Words, POS, and TF-IDF features) and transformer-based (BERT
augmented with N-grams, DistilBERT, BERT with a lightweight custom classifier,
and LSTM-based N-gram models) ML detection techniques. As we aim to assess each
model's performance in detecting AI-generated research texts, we also aim to
test whether an ensemble of these models can outperform any single detector.
Results show DistilBERT achieves the overall best performance, while Logistic
Regression and BERT-Custom offer solid, balanced alternatives; LSTM- and
BERT-N-gram approaches lag. The max voting ensemble of the three best models
fails to surpass DistilBERT itself, highlighting the primacy of a single
transformer-based representation over mere model diversity. By comprehensively
assessing the strengths and weaknesses of these AI-text detection approaches,
this work lays a foundation for more robust transformer frameworks with larger,
richer datasets to keep pace with ever-improving generative AI models.

### [5] [ConceptViz: A Visual Analytics Approach for Exploring Concepts in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20376)
*Haoxuan Li,Zhen Wen,Qiqi Jiang,Chenxiao Li,Yuwei Wu,Yuchen Yang,Yiyao Wang,Xiuqi Huang,Minfeng Zhu,Wei Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConceptViz是一个可视化分析系统，用于探索大语言模型中的概念表示，通过识别-解释-验证的流程帮助研究人员理解SAE特征与人类概念之间的对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然稀疏自编码器（SAEs）是从大语言模型中提取可解释特征的有前景技术，但SAE特征本身并不与人类可理解的概念对齐，使得解释过程繁琐且劳动密集。

Method: ConceptViz实现了新颖的识别=>解释=>验证流程，允许用户使用感兴趣的概念查询SAEs，交互式探索概念到特征的对齐，并通过模型行为验证对应关系。

Result: 通过两个使用场景和用户研究证明了ConceptViz的有效性，结果显示该系统通过简化有意义的LLM概念表示的发现和验证过程，增强了可解释性研究。

Conclusion: ConceptViz最终帮助研究人员构建更准确的大语言模型特征心智模型，其代码和用户指南已公开可用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of natural language tasks. Understanding how LLMs internally
represent knowledge remains a significant challenge. Despite Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising technique for extracting
interpretable features from LLMs, SAE features do not inherently align with
human-understandable concepts, making their interpretation cumbersome and
labor-intensive. To bridge the gap between SAE features and human concepts, we
present ConceptViz, a visual analytics system designed for exploring concepts
in LLMs. ConceptViz implements a novel dentification => Interpretation =>
Validation pipeline, enabling users to query SAEs using concepts of interest,
interactively explore concept-to-feature alignments, and validate the
correspondences through model behavior verification. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of ConceptViz through two usage scenarios and a user study. Our
results show that ConceptViz enhances interpretability research by streamlining
the discovery and validation of meaningful concept representations in LLMs,
ultimately aiding researchers in building more accurate mental models of LLM
features. Our code and user guide are publicly available at
https://github.com/Happy-Hippo209/ConceptViz.

### [6] [SKILL-RAG: Self-Knowledge Induced Learning and Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20377)
*Tomoaki Isoda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SKILL-RAG是一种利用模型自我知识来筛选检索文档的新方法，通过强化学习训练框架在句子级别过滤无关内容，提高RAG性能并减少输入文档数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于检索系统可能返回不相关内容，将这些信息整合到模型中会导致幻觉问题。理解模型"知道"和"不知道"的内容（自我知识）对于更好地整合内部知识和外部检索知识至关重要。

Method: 提出SKILL-RAG方法，利用模型的自我知识判断哪些检索文档对回答查询有益。设计了基于强化学习的训练框架，在句子级别粒度上过滤无关内容，同时保留有用知识。

Result: 在多个问答基准测试中使用Llama2-7B和Qwen3-8B进行评估，实验结果表明SKILL-RAG不仅提高了生成质量，还显著减少了输入文档数量。

Conclusion: 验证了自我知识在指导高质量检索选择中的重要性，SKILL-RAG方法有效解决了RAG中无关内容导致的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly improved the
performance of large language models (LLMs) on knowledge-intensive tasks in
recent years. However, since retrieval systems may return irrelevant content,
incorporating such information into the model often leads to hallucinations.
Thus, identifying and filtering out unhelpful retrieved content is a key
challenge for improving RAG performance.To better integrate the internal
knowledge of the model with external knowledge from retrieval, it is essential
to understand what the model "knows" and "does not know" (which is also called
"self-knowledge"). Based on this insight, we propose SKILL-RAG (Self-Knowledge
Induced Learning and Filtering for RAG), a novel method that leverages the
model's self-knowledge to determine which retrieved documents are beneficial
for answering a given query. We design a reinforcement learning-based training
framework to explicitly elicit self-knowledge from the model and employs
sentence-level granularity to filter out irrelevant content while preserving
useful knowledge.We evaluate SKILL-RAG using Llama2-7B and Qwen3-8B on several
question answering benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that SKILL-RAG
not only improves generation quality but also significantly reduces the number
of input documents, validating the importance of self-knowledge in guiding the
selection of high-quality retrievals.

### [7] [Beyond Global Emotion: Fine-Grained Emotional Speech Synthesis with Dynamic Word-Level Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20378)
*Sirui Wang,Andong Chen,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Emo-FiLM是一个细粒度情感建模框架，通过将帧级情感特征对齐到单词并利用FiLM层调制文本嵌入，实现单词级情感控制的TTS系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感TTS系统依赖句子级控制，无法捕捉句子内的动态情感变化，需要细粒度情感建模方法。

Method: 使用emotion2vec获取帧级情感特征，对齐到单词级注释，通过FiLM层直接调制文本嵌入实现单词级情感控制。

Result: Emo-FiLM在全局和细粒度任务上均优于现有方法，证明了其在表达性语音合成中的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: Emo-FiLM框架成功实现了细粒度情感控制，为自然可信的人机交互提供了更精确的情感表达能力。

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech (E-TTS) is central to creating natural and
trustworthy human-computer interaction. Existing systems typically rely on
sentence-level control through predefined labels, reference audio, or natural
language prompts. While effective for global emotion expression, these
approaches fail to capture dynamic shifts within a sentence. To address this
limitation, we introduce Emo-FiLM, a fine-grained emotion modeling framework
for LLM-based TTS. Emo-FiLM aligns frame-level features from emotion2vec to
words to obtain word-level emotion annotations, and maps them through a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) layer, enabling word-level emotion
control by directly modulating text embeddings. To support evaluation, we
construct the Fine-grained Emotion Dynamics Dataset (FEDD) with detailed
annotations of emotional transitions. Experiments show that Emo-FiLM
outperforms existing approaches on both global and fine-grained tasks,
demonstrating its effectiveness and generality for expressive speech synthesis.

### [8] [USB-Rec: An Effective Framework for Improving Conversational Recommendation Capability of Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20381)
*Jianyu Wen,Jingyun Wang,Cilin Yan,Jiayin Cai,Xiaolong Jiang,Ying Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了USB-Rec框架，通过用户模拟器进行训练-推理一体化，提升LLM在对话推荐系统中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的对话推荐方法主要关注利用LLM的总结和分析能力，而忽略了训练问题

Method: 1. 设计基于LLM的偏好优化数据集构建策略用于RL训练；2. 在推理阶段提出自增强策略进一步挖掘RL训练获得的对话推荐潜力

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续优于之前的最先进方法

Conclusion: USB-Rec框架通过集成训练和推理，显著提升了LLM在对话推荐任务中的表现

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely employed in
Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs). Unlike traditional language model
approaches that focus on training, all existing LLMs-based approaches are
mainly centered around how to leverage the summarization and analysis
capabilities of LLMs while ignoring the issue of training. Therefore, in this
work, we propose an integrated training-inference framework,
User-Simulator-Based framework (USB-Rec), for improving the performance of LLMs
in conversational recommendation at the model level. Firstly, we design a
LLM-based Preference Optimization (PO) dataset construction strategy for RL
training, which helps the LLMs understand the strategies and methods in
conversational recommendation. Secondly, we propose a Self-Enhancement Strategy
(SES) at the inference stage to further exploit the conversational
recommendation potential obtained from RL training. Extensive experiments on
various datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

### [9] [Document Summarization with Conformal Importance Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20461)
*Bruce Kuwahara,Chen-Yuan Lin,Xiao Shi Huang,Kin Kwan Leung,Jullian Arta Yapeter,Ilya Stanevich,Felipe Perez,Jesse C. Cresswell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Conformal Importance Summarization框架，使用保形预测为摘要生成提供严格的内容覆盖保证，确保关键信息不被遗漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动摘要系统在医疗、法律、金融等高风险领域缺乏关键内容包含的可靠保证，需要开发能够提供严格覆盖保证的摘要方法。

Method: 基于保形预测框架，在校准集上调整句子重要性分数的阈值，实现可指定覆盖率和召回率的抽取式文档摘要，方法模型无关且可与现有黑盒LLM无缝集成。

Result: 在标准摘要基准测试中，Conformal Importance Summarization实现了理论保证的信息覆盖率。

Conclusion: 该框架可与现有技术结合实现可靠可控的自动摘要，为AI摘要工具在关键应用中的安全部署铺平道路。

Abstract: Automatic summarization systems have advanced rapidly with large language
models (LLMs), yet they still lack reliable guarantees on inclusion of critical
content in high-stakes domains like healthcare, law, and finance. In this work,
we introduce Conformal Importance Summarization, the first framework for
importance-preserving summary generation which uses conformal prediction to
provide rigorous, distribution-free coverage guarantees. By calibrating
thresholds on sentence-level importance scores, we enable extractive document
summarization with user-specified coverage and recall rates over critical
content. Our method is model-agnostic, requires only a small calibration set,
and seamlessly integrates with existing black-box LLMs. Experiments on
established summarization benchmarks demonstrate that Conformal Importance
Summarization achieves the theoretically assured information coverage rate. Our
work suggests that Conformal Importance Summarization can be combined with
existing techniques to achieve reliable, controllable automatic summarization,
paving the way for safer deployment of AI summarization tools in critical
applications. Code is available at

*Henrik Vatndal,Vinay Setty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ShortCheck是一个用于检测短视频平台（如TikTok）中值得核查内容的模块化系统，通过多模态分析帮助人工事实核查员识别虚假信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台因其多模态、动态和嘈杂的内容特性，在虚假信息检测方面面临独特挑战，需要专门工具来辅助人工核查。

Method: 采用模块化、仅推理的流水线，整合语音转录、OCR、物体和深度伪造检测、视频到文本摘要以及声明验证等多种技术。

Result: 在两个手动标注的多语言TikTok视频数据集上验证，系统F1加权分数超过70%，表现良好。

Conclusion: ShortCheck系统在短视频虚假信息检测方面取得了有希望的结果，为事实核查提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Short-form video platforms like TikTok present unique challenges for
misinformation detection due to their multimodal, dynamic, and noisy content.
We present ShortCheck, a modular, inference-only pipeline with a user-friendly
interface that automatically identifies checkworthy short-form videos to help
human fact-checkers. The system integrates speech transcription, OCR, object
and deepfake detection, video-to-text summarization, and claim verification.
ShortCheck is validated by evaluating it on two manually annotated datasets
with TikTok videos in a multilingual setting. The pipeline achieves promising
results with F1-weighted score over 70\%.

### [11] [MARS: toward more efficient multi-agent collaboration for LLM reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20502)
*Xiao Wang,Jia Wang,Yijie Wang,Pengtao Dang,Sha Cao,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MARS框架，通过角色分工的协作方式（作者、审稿人、元审稿人）提升大语言模型的推理能力，在保持与多智能体辩论相同准确率的同时，将token使用量和推理时间减少约50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体辩论虽然能提升大语言模型的推理能力，但存在计算开销大、通信频繁的问题，需要更高效的协作框架。

Method: 采用基于角色的协作框架：作者智能体生成初始方案，审稿智能体独立提供决策和评论，元审稿智能体整合反馈做出最终决策并指导进一步修订。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MARS与多智能体辩论的准确率相当，但token使用量和推理时间均减少约50%。

Conclusion: MARS框架通过避免审稿人间的交互，在保持推理质量的同时显著降低了计算开销，为多智能体协作提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in natural
language understanding, yet their reasoning capabilities remain limited when
operating as single agents. Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) has been proposed to
address this limitation by enabling collaborative reasoning among multiple
models in a round-table debate manner. While effective, MAD introduces
substantial computational overhead due to the number of agents involved and the
frequent communication required. In this paper, we propose MARS (Multi-Agent
Review System), a role-based collaboration framework inspired by the review
process. In MARS, an author agent generates an initial solution, reviewer
agents provide decisions and comments independently, and a meta-reviewer
integrates the feedback to make the final decision and guide further revision.
This design enhances reasoning quality while avoiding costly
reviewer-to-reviewer interactions, thereby controlling token consumption and
inference time. We compared MARS with both MAD and other state-of-the-art
reasoning strategies across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments with
different LLMs show that MARS matches the accuracy of MAD while reducing both
token usage and inference time by approximately 50\%. Code is available at
https://github.com/xwang97/MARS.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SiniticMTError数据集，为英语到普通话、粤语和吴语的机器翻译提供错误跨度、错误类型和错误严重性标注，支持低资源语言的翻译质量评估和错误检测研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器翻译近年取得重大进展，但许多低资源语言（如粤语和吴语）由于缺乏大规模训练数据和语言资源，进展仍然有限。

Method: 基于现有平行语料库构建新数据集，由母语者进行严格标注过程，包括错误跨度、错误类型和错误严重性标注，并分析标注者间一致性、迭代反馈以及错误类型和严重性模式。

Result: 创建了SiniticMTError数据集，为机器翻译社区提供了用于微调具有错误检测能力模型的资源，支持翻译质量估计、错误感知生成和低资源语言评估研究。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了低资源汉语方言机器翻译评估的空白，为改进这些语言的翻译质量提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Despite major advances in machine translation (MT) in recent years, progress
remains limited for many low-resource languages that lack large-scale training
data and linguistic resources. Cantonese and Wu Chinese are two Sinitic
examples, although each enjoys more than 80 million speakers around the world.
In this paper, we introduce SiniticMTError, a novel dataset that builds on
existing parallel corpora to provide error span, error type, and error severity
annotations in machine-translated examples from English to Mandarin, Cantonese,
and Wu Chinese. Our dataset serves as a resource for the MT community to
utilize in fine-tuning models with error detection capabilities, supporting
research on translation quality estimation, error-aware generation, and
low-resource language evaluation. We report our rigorous annotation process by
native speakers, with analyses on inter-annotator agreement, iterative
feedback, and patterns in error type and severity.

### [13] [SwasthLLM: a Unified Cross-Lingual, Multi-Task, and Meta-Learning Zero-Shot Framework for Medical Diagnosis Using Contrastive Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20567)
*Ayan Sar,Pranav Singh Puri,Sumit Aich,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SwasthLLM是一个统一、零样本、跨语言的多任务学习框架，用于多语言医疗环境中的疾病诊断，无需语言特定微调即可在英语、印地语和孟加拉语上有效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多语言医疗环境中，由于低资源语言中标注医疗数据的稀缺性以及跨人群的语言变异性，从临床文本进行自动疾病诊断仍然是一个具有挑战性的任务。

Method: SwasthLLM基于多语言XLM-RoBERTa编码器，增强语言感知注意力机制和疾病分类头；引入Siamese对比学习模块确保跨语言语义表示对齐；使用翻译一致性模块和对比投影头强化语言不变表示学习；采用多任务学习策略联合优化疾病分类、翻译对齐和对比学习目标；使用模型无关元学习（MAML）使模型具备快速适应能力。

Result: 在监督设置下，SwasthLLM达到97.22%的测试准确率和97.17%的F1分数；在零样本场景下，在印地语医疗文本上达到92.78%的准确率，在孟加拉语上达到73.33%的准确率。

Conclusion: SwasthLLM在多语言医疗环境中表现出强大的诊断性能和泛化能力，特别是在低资源语境下，为跨语言疾病诊断提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In multilingual healthcare environments, automatic disease diagnosis from
clinical text remains a challenging task due to the scarcity of annotated
medical data in low-resource languages and the linguistic variability across
populations. This paper proposes SwasthLLM, a unified, zero-shot,
cross-lingual, and multi-task learning framework for medical diagnosis that
operates effectively across English, Hindi, and Bengali without requiring
language-specific fine-tuning. At its core, SwasthLLM leverages the
multilingual XLM-RoBERTa encoder augmented with a language-aware attention
mechanism and a disease classification head, enabling the model to extract
medically relevant information regardless of the language structure. To align
semantic representations across languages, a Siamese contrastive learning
module is introduced, ensuring that equivalent medical texts in different
languages produce similar embeddings. Further, a translation consistency module
and a contrastive projection head reinforce language-invariant representation
learning. SwasthLLM is trained using a multi-task learning strategy, jointly
optimizing disease classification, translation alignment, and contrastive
learning objectives. Additionally, we employ Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning
(MAML) to equip the model with rapid adaptation capabilities for unseen
languages or tasks with minimal data. Our phased training pipeline emphasizes
robust representation alignment before task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive
evaluation shows that SwasthLLM achieves high diagnostic performance, with a
test accuracy of 97.22% and an F1-score of 97.17% in supervised settings.
Crucially, in zero-shot scenarios, it attains 92.78% accuracy on Hindi and
73.33% accuracy on Bengali medical text, demonstrating strong generalization in
low-resource contexts.

*Sampurna Roy,Ayan Sar,Anurag Kaushish,Kanav Gupta,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出DS-MoE框架，通过深度专业化专家混合实现动态推理链，为不同复杂度的输入匹配相应深度的计算，提升效率和推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer对所有输入使用相同处理深度，导致简单查询浪费资源，复杂问题推理不足。需要自适应深度处理机制。

Method: 基于Mixture of Experts范式，引入深度专业化专家模块，包括浅层模式识别、组合推理、逻辑推理等，通过学习路由网络动态组装推理链。

Result: 在The Pile数据集上，相比统一深度transformer，计算节省16%，推理速度提升35%，复杂多步推理准确率提高2.8%。

Conclusion: DS-MoE是自适应神经架构的重要进展，深度专业化模块化处理可同时提升效率、推理质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Contemporary transformer architectures apply identical processing depth to
all inputs, creating inefficiencies and limiting reasoning quality. Simple
factual queries are subjected to the same multilayered computation as complex
logical problems, wasting resources while constraining deep inference. To
overcome this, we came up with a concept of Dynamic Reasoning Chains through
Depth Specialised Mixture of Experts (DS-MoE), a modular framework that extends
the Mixture of Experts paradigm from width-based to depth specialised
computation. DS-MoE introduces expert modules optimised for distinct reasoning
depths, shallow pattern recognition, compositional reasoning, logical
inference, memory integration, and meta-cognitive supervision. A learned
routing network dynamically assembles custom reasoning chains, activating only
the necessary experts to match input complexity. The dataset on which we
trained and evaluated DS-MoE is on The Pile, an 800GB corpus covering diverse
domains such as scientific papers, legal texts, programming code, and web
content, enabling systematic assessment across reasoning depths. Experimental
results demonstrate that DS-MoE achieves up to 16 per cent computational
savings and 35 per cent faster inference compared to uniform-depth
transformers, while delivering 2.8 per cent higher accuracy on complex
multi-step reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, routing decisions yield
interpretable reasoning chains, enhancing transparency and scalability. These
findings establish DS-MoE as a significant advancement in adaptive neural
architectures, demonstrating that depth-specialised modular processing can
simultaneously improve efficiency, reasoning quality, and interpretability in
large-scale language models.

*Ayan Sar,Sampurna Roy,Kanav Gupta,Anurag Kaushish,Tanupriya Choudhury,Abhijit Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了分层分辨率变换器（HRT），一种受小波启发的神经架构，通过多分辨率处理语言，从字符到语篇级别，实现了O(nlogn)复杂度，在多个基准测试中优于标准变换器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准变换器将文本处理为扁平标记序列，错误地表示了人类语言的层次结构，导致二次计算成本、弱组合泛化和不充分的语篇级建模。

Method: HRT构建多分辨率注意力机制，实现自下而上的组合和自上而下的语境化，通过跨尺度的指数序列缩减实现效率提升。

Result: 在GLUE、SuperGLUE、Long Range Arena和WikiText-103上的评估显示，HRT平均优于标准变换器基线3.8%-6.1%，内存使用减少42%，推理延迟降低37%。

Conclusion: HRT是首个将计算结构与人类语言层次组织对齐的架构，证明了多尺度小波启发的处理在理论效率和实践语言理解方面都有提升。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance across
natural language tasks, yet they fundamentally misrepresent the hierarchical
nature of human language by processing text as flat token sequences. This
results in quadratic computational cost, weak computational cost, weak
compositional generalization, and inadequate discourse-level modeling. We
propose Hierarchical Resolution Transformer (HRT), a novel wavelet-inspired
neural architecture that processes language simultaneously across multiple
resolutions, from characters to discourse-level units. HRT constructs a
multi-resolution attention, enabling bottom-up composition and top-down
contextualization. By employing exponential sequence reduction across scales,
HRT achieves O(nlogn) complexity, offering significant efficiency improvements
over standard transformers. We evaluated HRT on a diverse suite of benchmarks,
including GLUE, SuperGLUE, Long Range Arena, and WikiText-103, and results
demonstrated that HRT outperforms standard transformer baselines by an average
of +3.8% on GLUE, +4.5% on SuperGLUE, and +6.1% on Long Range Arena, while
reducing memory usage by 42% and inference latency by 37% compared to BERT and
GPT style models of similar parameter count. Ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of cross-resolution attention and scale-specialized modules,
showing that each contributes independently to both efficiency and accuracy.
Our findings establish HRT as the first architecture to align computational
structure with the hierarchical organization of human language, demonstrating
that multi-scale, wavelet-inspired processing yields both theoretical
efficiency gains and practical improvements in language understanding.

TL;DR: FS-DFM是一种少步离散流匹配模型，通过将采样步数作为显式参数训练，实现8步采样即可达到1024步离散流基线的性能，采样速度提升128倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语言模型生成速度慢，扩散语言模型需要数百到数千次模型评估才能达到高质量，两者都存在效率问题。

Method: 采用离散流匹配，将采样步数作为显式参数训练模型一致性，配合可靠的更新规则和从长轨迹蒸馏的强教师指导。

Result: 在语言建模基准测试中，FS-DFM用8步采样达到1024步离散流基线的困惑度性能，采样速度提升128倍，延迟/吞吐量显著改善。

Conclusion: FS-DFM实现了少步采样稳定、准确且易于控制，在保持质量的同时大幅提升了语言生成的效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive language models (ARMs) deliver strong likelihoods, but are
inherently serial: they generate one token per forward pass, which limits
throughput and inflates latency for long sequences. Diffusion Language Models
(DLMs) parallelize across positions and thus appear promising for language
generation, yet standard discrete diffusion typically needs hundreds to
thousands of model evaluations to reach high quality, trading serial depth for
iterative breadth. We introduce FS-DFM, Few-Step Discrete Flow-Matching. A
discrete flow-matching model designed for speed without sacrificing quality.
The core idea is simple: make the number of sampling steps an explicit
parameter and train the model to be consistent across step budgets, so one big
move lands where many small moves would. We pair this with a reliable update
rule that moves probability in the right direction without overshooting, and
with strong teacher guidance distilled from long-run trajectories. Together,
these choices make few-step sampling stable, accurate, and easy to control. On
language modeling benchmarks, FS-DFM with 8 sampling steps achieves perplexity
parity with a 1,024-step discrete-flow baseline for generating 1,024 tokens
using a similar-size model, delivering up to 128 times faster sampling and
corresponding latency/throughput gains.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型评估瓶颈：能否在运行实验前预测结果，支持难度估计和更智能的实验优先级排序。

Method: 构建PRECOG语料库，包含多样化任务、领域和指标的红标描述-性能对。使用配备检索模块的模型进行预测，排除源论文信息。

Result: 任务具有挑战性但可行：模型达到中等预测性能且不确定性校准良好，在准确性子集上MAE低至8.7。强推理模型进行多样化迭代查询，而开源模型检索多样性有限。

Conclusion: 该语料库和分析为开放式预期评估提供了初步步骤，支持难度估计和更智能的实验优先级排序。

Abstract: Progress in large language models is constrained by an evaluation bottleneck:
build a benchmark, evaluate models and settings, then iterate. We therefore ask
a simple question: can we forecast outcomes before running any experiments? We
study text-only performance forecasting: estimating a model's score from a
redacted task description and intended configuration, with no access to dataset
instances. To support systematic study, we curate PRECOG, a corpus of redacted
description-performance pairs spanning diverse tasks, domains, and metrics.
Experiments show the task is challenging but feasible: models equipped with a
retrieval module that excludes source papers achieve moderate prediction
performance with well-calibrated uncertainty, reaching mean absolute error as
low as 8.7 on the Accuracy subset at high-confidence thresholds. Our analysis
indicates that stronger reasoning models engage in diverse, iterative querying,
whereas current open-source models lag and often skip retrieval or gather
evidence with limited diversity. We further test a zero-leakage setting,
forecasting on newly released datasets or experiments before their papers are
indexed, where GPT-5 with built-in web search still attains nontrivial
prediction accuracy. Overall, our corpus and analyses offer an initial step
toward open-ended anticipatory evaluation, supporting difficulty estimation and
smarter experiment prioritization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日语虽然是资源丰富的语言，但包含重音标记的准确音位转录训练数据很少，这限制了针对日语口语评估任务的语音识别器开发。

Method: 1. 多任务训练：引入辅助损失函数估计正字文本标签和音高模式；2. 双估计器融合：结合音素字母串和文本标记序列的估计器，基于有限状态转换器框架开发融合算法。

Result: 多任务学习和融合方法有效构建了准确的音位识别器，相比通用多语言识别器具有优势。平均音节标签错误率从12.3%降至7.1%。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效缓解数据稀疏问题，显著提高日语音位识别的准确性，在日语口语评估任务中具有实用价值。

Abstract: This paper presents methods for building speech recognizers tailored for
Japanese speaking assessment tasks. Specifically, we build a speech recognizer
that outputs phonemic labels with accent markers. Although Japanese is
resource-rich, there is only a small amount of data for training models to
produce accurate phonemic transcriptions that include accent marks. We propose
two methods to mitigate data sparsity. First, a multitask training scheme
introduces auxiliary loss functions to estimate orthographic text labels and
pitch patterns of the input signal, so that utterances with only orthographic
annotations can be leveraged in training. The second fuses two estimators, one
over phonetic alphabet strings, and the other over text token sequences. To
combine these estimates we develop an algorithm based on the finite-state
transducer framework. Our results indicate that the use of multitask learning
and fusion is effective for building an accurate phonemic recognizer. We show
that this approach is advantageous compared to the use of generic multilingual
recognizers. The relative advantages of the proposed methods were also
compared. Our proposed methods reduced the average of mora-label error rates
from 12.3% to 7.1% over the CSJ core evaluation sets.

Method: 使用GPT-4o、GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-R1三种先进LLMs进行知识提取，生成领域相关知识和分子向量化的可执行代码，将基于知识的特征与结构表示融合。

Result: 大量实验表明，该集成方法优于现有方法，证实LLM衍生知识与结构信息的结合为分子性质预测提供了稳健有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: LLM提取的知识与结构特征的集成显著提升了分子性质预测性能，为解决LLMs的知识局限提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Predicting molecular properties is a critical component of drug discovery.
Recent advances in deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
have enabled end-to-end learning from molecular structures, reducing reliance
on manual feature engineering. However, while GNNs and self-supervised learning
approaches have advanced molecular property prediction (MPP), the integration
of human prior knowledge remains indispensable, as evidenced by recent methods
that leverage large language models (LLMs) for knowledge extraction. Despite
their strengths, LLMs are constrained by knowledge gaps and hallucinations,
particularly for less-studied molecular properties. In this work, we propose a
novel framework that, for the first time, integrates knowledge extracted from
LLMs with structural features derived from pre-trained molecular models to
enhance MPP. Our approach prompts LLMs to generate both domain-relevant
knowledge and executable code for molecular vectorization, producing
knowledge-based features that are subsequently fused with structural
representations. We employ three state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and
DeepSeek-R1, for knowledge extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our integrated method outperforms existing approaches, confirming that the
combination of LLM-derived knowledge and structural information provides a
robust and effective solution for MPP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击检测模型在对抗文本攻击中表现良好，但其可靠性尚未被充分探索，特别是当攻击者故意制造检测模型与分类器之间的冲突时。

Method: 提出RedHerring攻击方法，通过文本修改使检测模型预测为攻击，同时确保分类器保持正确分类，创建分类器与检测器之间的紧张关系。

Result: 在4个数据集上对3个检测器和4个分类器的测试显示，RedHerring能将检测准确率降低20-71个百分点，同时维持或提高分类器准确率。

Conclusion: RedHerring威胁模型揭示了攻击者针对检测模型的新方式，提出了无需重新训练的简单置信度检查作为初步防御方案。

Abstract: In response to adversarial text attacks, attack detection models have been
proposed and shown to successfully identify text modified by adversaries.
Attack detection models can be leveraged to provide an additional check for NLP
models and give signals for human input. However, the reliability of these
models has not yet been thoroughly explored. Thus, we propose and test a novel
attack setting and attack, RedHerring. RedHerring aims to make attack detection
models unreliable by modifying a text to cause the detection model to predict
an attack, while keeping the classifier correct. This creates a tension between
the classifier and detector. If a human sees that the detector is giving an
``incorrect'' prediction, but the classifier a correct one, then the human will
see the detector as unreliable. We test this novel threat model on 4 datasets
against 3 detectors defending 4 classifiers. We find that RedHerring is able to
drop detection accuracy between 20 - 71 points, while maintaining (or
improving) classifier accuracy. As an initial defense, we propose a simple
confidence check which requires no retraining of the classifier or detector and
increases detection accuracy greatly. This novel threat model offers new
insights into how adversaries may target detection models.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的攻击选择策略（Hybrid和Dynamic Select），通过结合BinarySelect和GreedySelect的优势，显著减少了对抗性文本攻击所需的查询次数，同时保持攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于transformer架构的NLP模型对抗攻击测试计算成本高的问题，特别是针对资源有限的研究者。现有黑盒攻击方法需要大量查询，效率低下且不实用。

Method: Hybrid Select通过引入大小阈值来决定使用哪种选择算法，将广义BinarySelect与GreedySelect结合；Dynamic Select通过学习每种选择方法应应用于的文本长度来结合这两种方法。

Result: 在4个数据集和6个目标模型上，最佳方法（句子级Hybrid Select）平均减少攻击所需查询次数达25.82%，且不损失攻击有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的新攻击选择策略有效降低了对抗性文本攻击的计算成本，为资源有限的研究者提供了更实用的攻击测试方法。

Abstract: Adversarial text attack research plays a crucial role in evaluating the
robustness of NLP models. However, the increasing complexity of
transformer-based architectures has dramatically raised the computational cost
of attack testing, especially for researchers with limited resources (e.g.,
GPUs). Existing popular black-box attack methods often require a large number
of queries, which can make them inefficient and impractical for researchers. To
address these challenges, we propose two new attack selection strategies called
Hybrid and Dynamic Select, which better combine the strengths of previous
selection algorithms. Hybrid Select merges generalized BinarySelect techniques
with GreedySelect by introducing a size threshold to decide which selection
algorithm to use. Dynamic Select provides an alternative approach of combining
the generalized Binary and GreedySelect by learning which lengths of texts each
selection method should be applied to. This greatly reduces the number of
queries needed while maintaining attack effectiveness (a limitation of
BinarySelect). Across 4 datasets and 6 target models, our best
method(sentence-level Hybrid Select) is able to reduce the number of required
queries per attack up 25.82\% on average against both encoder models and LLMs,
without losing the effectiveness of the attack.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实部署中的语音情感识别经常在域不匹配情况下失败，源数据不可用且强大的LALM只能通过API访问。研究如何在仅使用未标记目标域音频和API-only LALM的情况下，使学生模型在目标域超越LALM性能。

Method: 提出MI-Fuse框架，将源域训练的SER分类器作为辅助教师，从两个教师中抽取多个随机预测，基于互信息的不确定性加权其平均分布，并使用指数移动平均教师稳定训练。

Result: 在三个公共情感数据集和六个跨域转移实验中都显示出一致的性能提升，学生模型超越了LALM，并在最强基线基础上提升了3.9%。

Conclusion: 该方法在不共享源数据的情况下增强了情感感知语音系统，实现了现实的适应能力。

Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong zero-shot ability on speech
tasks, suggesting promise for speech emotion recognition (SER). However, SER in
real-world deployments often fails under domain mismatch, where source data are
unavailable and powerful LALMs are accessible only through an API. We ask:
given only unlabeled target-domain audio and an API-only LALM, can a student
model be adapted to outperform the LALM in the target domain? To this end, we
propose MI-Fuse, a denoised label fusion framework that supplements the LALM
with a source-domain trained SER classifier as an auxiliary teacher. The
framework draws multiple stochastic predictions from both teachers, weights
their mean distributions by mutual-information-based uncertainty, and
stabilizes training with an exponential moving average teacher. Experiments
across three public emotion datasets and six cross-domain transfers show
consistent gains, with the student surpassing the LALM and outperforming the
strongest baseline by 3.9%. This approach strengthens emotion-aware speech
systems without sharing source data, enabling realistic adaptation.

Abstract: Unsupervised neural grammar induction aims to learn interpretable
hierarchical structures from language data. However, existing models face an
expressiveness bottleneck, often resulting in unnecessarily large yet
underperforming grammars. We identify a core issue, $\textit{probability
distribution collapse}$, as the underlying cause of this limitation. We analyze
when and how the collapse emerges across key components of neural
parameterization and introduce a targeted solution, $\textit{collapse-relaxing
neural parameterization}$, to mitigate it. Our approach substantially improves
parsing performance while enabling the use of significantly more compact
grammars across a wide range of languages, as demonstrated through extensive
empirical analysis.

Abstract: We propose Confidence-guided Refinement Reasoning (C2R), a novel
training-free framework applicable to question-answering (QA) tasks across
text, image, and video domains. C2R strategically constructs and refines
sub-questions and their answers (sub-QAs), deriving a better confidence score
for the target answer. C2R first curates a subset of sub-QAs to explore diverse
reasoning paths, then compares the confidence scores of the resulting answer
candidates to select the most reliable final answer. Since C2R relies solely on
confidence scores derived from the model itself, it can be seamlessly
integrated with various existing QA models, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements across diverse models and benchmarks. Furthermore, we
provide essential yet underexplored insights into how leveraging sub-QAs
affects model behavior, specifically analyzing the impact of both the quantity
and quality of sub-QAs on achieving robust and reliable reasoning.

Motivation: 传统观点认为领域特定的监督微调会损害LLM的通用能力，本文旨在重新审视这种权衡关系并寻找更好的平衡策略。

Method: 提出Token-Adaptive Loss Reweighting(TALR)方法，并比较了L2正则化、LoRA、模型平均、FLOW等多种策略在减少通用能力损失方面的效果。

Result: 实验表明，虽然没有任何方法能完全消除权衡，但TALR在平衡领域特定增益和通用能力方面始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 提供实用指南：使用小学习率可获得有利权衡；当需要更强平衡时，采用TALR作为有效策略。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on domain-specific datasets is a common approach
to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized tasks but is often
believed to degrade their general capabilities. In this work, we revisit this
trade-off and present both empirical and theoretical insights. First, we show
that SFT does not always hurt: using a smaller learning rate can substantially
mitigate general performance degradation while preserving comparable
target-domain performance. We then provide a theoretical analysis that explains
these phenomena and further motivates a new method, Token-Adaptive Loss
Reweighting (TALR). Building on this, and recognizing that smaller learning
rates alone do not fully eliminate general-performance degradation in all
cases, we evaluate a range of strategies for reducing general capability loss,
including L2 regularization, LoRA, model averaging, FLOW, and our proposed
TALR. Experimental results demonstrate that while no method completely
eliminates the trade-off, TALR consistently outperforms these baselines in
balancing domain-specific gains and general capabilities. Finally, we distill
our findings into practical guidelines for adapting LLMs to new domains: (i)
using a small learning rate to achieve a favorable trade-off, and (ii) when a
stronger balance is further desired, adopt TALR as an effective strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型内部表示的基本单元尚未明确定义，限制了对其机制的理解。神经元存在多义性问题，特征面临重建不可靠和不稳定的担忧，需要找到更可靠的表示单元。

Method: 提出原子理论，定义原子为基本表示单元；引入原子内积校正表示偏移；证明原子满足受限等距性质；训练带阈值激活的稀疏自编码器在Gemma2-2B、Gemma2-9B和Llama3.1-8B模型上识别原子。

Result: 在多个LLM模型上平均达到99.9%的稀疏重建，超过99.8%的原子满足唯一性条件，而神经元和特征分别只有0.5%和68.2%；缩放实验揭示了SAE大小与恢复能力的关系。

Conclusion: 原子理论为理解LLMs内部表示提供了理论框架，原子比神经元和特征更能忠实捕捉模型的内在表示，为机制可解释性研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The fundamental units of internal representations in large language models
(LLMs) remain undefined, limiting further understanding of their mechanisms.
Neurons or features are often regarded as such units, yet neurons suffer from
polysemy, while features face concerns of unreliable reconstruction and
instability. To address this issue, we propose the Atoms Theory, which defines
such units as atoms. We introduce the atomic inner product (AIP) to correct
representation shifting, formally define atoms, and prove the conditions that
atoms satisfy the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), ensuring stable sparse
representations over atom set and linking to compressed sensing. Under stronger
conditions, we further establish the uniqueness and exact $\ell_1$
recoverability of the sparse representations, and provide guarantees that
single-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs) with threshold activations can reliably
identify the atoms. To validate the Atoms Theory, we train threshold-activated
SAEs on Gemma2-2B, Gemma2-9B, and Llama3.1-8B, achieving 99.9% sparse
reconstruction across layers on average, and more than 99.8% of atoms satisfy
the uniqueness condition, compared to 0.5% for neurons and 68.2% for features,
showing that atoms more faithfully capture intrinsic representations of LLMs.
Scaling experiments further reveal the link between SAEs size and recovery
capacity. Overall, this work systematically introduces and validates Atoms
Theory of LLMs, providing a theoretical framework for understanding internal
representations and a foundation for mechanistic interpretability. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中常面临少样本和免训练情况，现有方法假设用户有大量历史评论或需要额外训练，而LLM的效果依赖提示工程

Method: 提出对话式提示：简单变体SCP仅使用用户自身评论，对比变体CCP插入其他用户或LLM的错误回复并要求模型纠正，鼓励生成用户风格文本

Result: 在8个产品领域和5个LLM上的实验表明，传统非对话提示生成类似随机用户的评论，而SCP和CCP能生成更接近目标用户的评论，即使每个用户只有2条评论

Conclusion: 对话式提示为少样本和免训练约束下的评论生成提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Personalized review generation helps businesses understand user preferences,
yet most existing approaches assume extensive review histories of the target
user or require additional model training. Real-world applications often face
few-shot and training-free situations, where only a few user reviews are
available and fine-tuning is infeasible. It is well known that large language
models (LLMs) can address such low-resource settings, but their effectiveness
depends on prompt engineering. In this paper, we propose Conversational
Prompting, a lightweight method that reformulates user reviews as multi-turn
conversations. Its simple variant, Simple Conversational Prompting (SCP),
relies solely on the user's own reviews, while the contrastive variant,
Contrastive Conversational Prompting (CCP), inserts reviews from other users or
LLMs as incorrect replies and then asks the model to correct them, encouraging
the model to produce text in the user's style. Experiments on eight product
domains and five LLMs showed that the conventional non-conversational prompt
often produced reviews similar to those written by random users, based on
text-based metrics such as ROUGE-L and BERTScore, and application-oriented
tasks like user identity matching and sentiment analysis. In contrast, both SCP
and CCP produced reviews much closer to those of the target user, even when
each user had only two reviews. CCP brings further improvements when
high-quality negative examples are available, whereas SCP remains competitive
when such data cannot be collected. These results suggest that conversational
prompting offers a practical solution for review generation under few-shot and
training-free constraints.

TL;DR: 提出Enrich-on-Graph框架，利用LLM的先验知识丰富知识图谱，弥合结构化KG与非结构化查询之间的语义鸿沟，在KGQA任务中实现高效证据提取和精确推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在知识图谱问答中存在的幻觉和事实错误问题，主要原因是结构化知识图谱与非结构化查询之间的语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出EoG框架，利用LLM的先验知识丰富知识图谱，通过三种图质量评估指标分析查询-图对齐，确保低计算成本和可扩展性。

Result: 在两个KGQA基准数据集上的实验表明，EoG能有效生成高质量KG并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EoG框架通过弥合语义鸿沟，在KGQA任务中实现了精确、鲁棒的推理，同时保持计算效率和适应性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities in complex
tasks. However, they still struggle with hallucinations and factual errors in
knowledge-intensive scenarios like knowledge graph question answering (KGQA).
We attribute this to the semantic gap between structured knowledge graphs (KGs)
and unstructured queries, caused by inherent differences in their focuses and
structures. Existing methods usually employ resource-intensive, non-scalable
workflows reasoning on vanilla KGs, but overlook this gap. To address this
challenge, we propose a flexible framework, Enrich-on-Graph (EoG), which
leverages LLMs' prior knowledge to enrich KGs, bridge the semantic gap between
graphs and queries. EoG enables efficient evidence extraction from KGs for
precise and robust reasoning, while ensuring low computational costs,
scalability, and adaptability across different methods. Furthermore, we propose
three graph quality evaluation metrics to analyze query-graph alignment in KGQA
task, supported by theoretical validation of our optimization objectives.
Extensive experiments on two KGQA benchmark datasets indicate that EoG can
effectively generate high-quality KGs and achieve the state-of-the-art
performance. Our code and data are available at

*Taehee Park,Heejin Do,Gary Geunbae Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoCO方法通过先使用LLM进行过度修正以最大化召回率，然后使用小型模型进行后修正来平衡召回率和精确度，从而提升语法错误修正的整体质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小型语言模型(sLMs)在监督微调后可靠性高但修正不足，精确度高但召回率低；大型语言模型(LLMs)则倾向于过度修正，导致精确度低。需要结合两者的优势来解决语法错误修正中的召回率问题。

Method: 提出PoCO方法：1) 使用LLM进行故意过度修正以最大化召回率；2) 使用微调的小型模型进行针对性后修正，识别和优化错误输出。

Result: 实验表明PoCO能有效平衡语法错误修正性能，在保持竞争力的精确度同时显著提高召回率。

Conclusion: PoCO通过结合LLMs的生成能力和小型监督模型的可靠性，成功提升了语法错误修正的整体质量，实现了召回率和精确度的平衡。

Abstract: Robust supervised fine-tuned small Language Models (sLMs) often show high
reliability but tend to undercorrect. They achieve high precision at the cost
of low recall. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) often show the opposite
tendency, making excessive overcorrection, leading to low precision. To
effectively harness the strengths of LLMs to address the recall challenges in
sLMs, we propose Post-Correction via Overcorrection (PoCO), a novel approach
that strategically balances recall and precision. PoCO first intentionally
triggers overcorrection via LLM to maximize recall by allowing comprehensive
revisions, then applies a targeted post-correction step via fine-tuning smaller
models to identify and refine erroneous outputs. We aim to harmonize both
aspects by leveraging the generative power of LLMs while preserving the
reliability of smaller supervised models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that PoCO effectively balances GEC performance by increasing recall with
competitive precision, ultimately improving the overall quality of grammatical
error correction.

TL;DR: 提出cheat-sheet ICL方法，将多示例上下文学习的信息提炼成简洁文本摘要，在推理时使用该摘要作为上下文，显著减少token数量并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的多示例上下文学习需要大量计算资源，因为输入token数量过多。

Method: 将多示例ICL的信息提炼成简洁的文本摘要（cheat sheet），在推理时使用该摘要作为上下文。

Result: 在推理任务上，cheat-sheet ICL使用更少的token达到与多示例ICL相当或更好的性能，且无需测试时检索即可匹配基于检索的ICL。

Conclusion: cheat-sheet ICL是利用LLM进行下游任务的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable effective in-context
learning (ICL) with many-shot examples, but at the cost of high computational
demand due to longer input tokens. To address this, we propose cheat-sheet ICL,
which distills the information from many-shot ICL into a concise textual
summary (cheat sheet) used as the context at inference time. Experiments on
challenging reasoning tasks show that cheat-sheet ICL achieves comparable or
better performance than many-shot ICL with far fewer tokens, and matches
retrieval-based ICL without requiring test-time retrieval. These findings
demonstrate that cheat-sheet ICL is a practical alternative for leveraging LLMs
in downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在云服务中的广泛应用引发了隐私担忧，现有文本匿名化技术难以平衡隐私保护与文本自然性和实用性。

Method: 使用基于树搜索的迭代句子重写算法，通过奖励模型指导的结构化搜索，逐步重写隐私敏感片段。

Result: 在隐私敏感数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有基线，在隐私保护和实用性之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法为隐私保护文本处理提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在保护敏感信息的同时保持文本质量。

Abstract: The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in cloud-based
services has raised significant privacy concerns, as user inputs may
inadvertently expose sensitive information. Existing text anonymization and
de-identification techniques, such as rule-based redaction and scrubbing, often
struggle to balance privacy preservation with text naturalness and utility. In
this work, we propose a zero-shot, tree-search-based iterative sentence
rewriting algorithm that systematically obfuscates or deletes private
information while preserving coherence, relevance, and naturalness. Our method
incrementally rewrites privacy-sensitive segments through a structured search
guided by a reward model, enabling dynamic exploration of the rewriting space.
Experiments on privacy-sensitive datasets show that our approach significantly
outperforms existing baselines, achieving a superior balance between privacy
protection and utility preservation.

Result: 在构建的数据集上实验表明，该方法能生成高质量且更易读的引用。

Conclusion: 子句级引用方法能够生成简洁且充分的引用，有效减少用户验证生成输出正确性所需的工作量。

Abstract: In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) question answering systems,
generating citations for large language model (LLM) outputs enhances
verifiability and helps users identify potential hallucinations. However, we
observe two problems in the citations produced by existing attribution methods.
First, the citations are typically provided at the sentence or even paragraph
level. Long sentences or paragraphs may include a substantial amount of
irrelevant content. Second, sentence-level citations may omit information that
is essential for verifying the output, forcing users to read the surrounding
context. In this paper, we propose generating sub-sentence citations that are
both concise and sufficient, thereby reducing the effort required by users to
confirm the correctness of the generated output. To this end, we first develop
annotation guidelines for such citations and construct a corresponding dataset.
Then, we propose an attribution framework for generating citations that adhere
to our standards. This framework leverages LLMs to automatically generate
fine-tuning data for our task and employs a credit model to filter out
low-quality examples. Our experiments on the constructed dataset demonstrate
that the propose approach can generate high-quality and more readable
citations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语言建模中显示出潜力，但缺乏精确的概率估计，导致生成过程不可预测且不一致，需要控制关键token来引导生成方向。

Method: WeFT加权SFT方法，根据token的熵分配不同权重，基于扩散理论设计。

Result: 在open-r1的1K、1.1K和3K样本上训练，在Sudoku、Countdown、GSM8K和MATH-500四个推理基准上分别获得39%、64%和83%的相对改进。

Conclusion: WeFT方法能有效提升扩散语言模型在推理任务中的性能，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown strong potential in language modeling,
offering faster generation compared to traditional autoregressive approaches.
However, applying supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to diffusion models remains
challenging, as they lack precise probability estimates at each denoising step.
While the diffusion mechanism enables the model to reason over entire
sequences, it also makes the generation process less predictable and often
inconsistent. This highlights the importance of controlling key tokens that
guide the direction of generation. To address this issue, we propose WeFT, a
weighted SFT method for diffusion language models, where tokens are assigned
different weights based on their entropy. Derived from diffusion theory, WeFT
delivers substantial gains: training on s1K, s1K-1.1, and 3k samples from
open-r1, it achieves relative improvements of 39%, 64%, and 83% over standard
SFT on four widely used reasoning benchmarks (Sudoku, Countdown, GSM8K, and
MATH-500). The code and models will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策通常考虑多个选项而非单一答案，但现有医学推理模型通常只生成单一答案，这限制了模型的实用性。

Method: 采用提示和微调两种方法，包括监督微调（SFT）和强化学习微调（RFT），并为排名列表格式设计了新的奖励函数。

Result: 虽然某些SFT模型能适应特定答案格式，但RFT训练的模型在多种格式中表现更稳健，且模型能识别有效答案即使不是基准的首选答案。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究医学推理模型生成排名列表答案的工作，为开发超越单一答案的替代格式提供了初步探索。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study on enabling medical reasoning models
(MRMs) to generate ranked lists of answers for open-ended questions. Clinical
decision-making rarely relies on a single answer but instead considers multiple
options, reducing the risks of narrow perspectives. Yet current MRMs are
typically trained to produce only one answer, even in open-ended settings. We
propose an alternative format: ranked lists and investigate two approaches:
prompting and fine-tuning. While prompting is a cost-effective way to steer an
MRM's response, not all MRMs generalize well across different answer formats:
choice, short text, and list answers. Based on our prompting findings, we train
and evaluate MRMs using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). SFT teaches a model to imitate annotated responses, and RFT
incentivizes exploration through the responses that maximize a reward. We
propose new reward functions targeted at ranked-list answer formats, and
conduct ablation studies for RFT. Our results show that while some SFT models
generalize to certain answer formats, models trained with RFT are more robust
across multiple formats. We also present a case study on a modified MedQA with
multiple valid answers, finding that although MRMs might fail to select the
benchmark's preferred ground truth, they can recognize valid answers. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation of approaches
for enabling MRMs to generate answers as ranked lists. We hope this work
provides a first step toward developing alternative answer formats that are
beneficial beyond single answers in medical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在长文档摘要中存在信息丢失、事实不一致和连贯性差的问题，需要新的方法来提升摘要质量。

Method: 采用对抗性多智能体框架，包含总结生成器、总结评审器、问答生成器、问答评审器和考生智能体，通过协作和对抗机制实现迭代优化。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的长文档摘要基准测试中，SummQ在ROUGE、BERTScore、LLM-as-a-Judge和人工评估指标上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一种新的长文档摘要方法，通过对抗性智能体协作来提升摘要质量。

Abstract: Long document summarization remains a significant challenge for current large
language models (LLMs), as existing approaches commonly struggle with
information loss, factual inconsistencies, and coherence issues when processing
excessively long documents. We propose SummQ, a novel adversarial multi-agent
framework that addresses these limitations through collaborative intelligence
between specialized agents operating in two complementary domains:
summarization and quizzing. Our approach employs summary generators and
reviewers that work collaboratively to create and evaluate comprehensive
summaries, while quiz generators and reviewers create comprehension questions
that serve as continuous quality checks for the summarization process. This
adversarial dynamic, enhanced by an examinee agent that validates whether the
generated summary contains the information needed to answer the quiz questions,
enables iterative refinement through multifaceted feedback mechanisms. We
evaluate SummQ on three widely used long document summarization benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods across ROUGE and BERTScore metrics, as well
as in LLM-as-a-Judge and human evaluations. Our comprehensive analyses reveal
the effectiveness of the multi-agent collaboration dynamics, the influence of
different agent configurations, and the impact of the quizzing mechanism. This
work establishes a new approach for long document summarization that uses
adversarial agentic collaboration to improve summarization quality.

Motivation: 现有检测方法主要依赖表面词汇重叠和困惑度，泛化能力差，在遇到隐式污染数据时性能显著下降。

Method: 分析数字令牌生成过程中的概率轨迹，识别被污染样本的"捷径"行为，并通过LoRA微调注入设计样本进行验证。

Result: 被污染样本和干净样本展现出明显分离的推理轨迹，验证了MemLens能够捕捉真正的记忆化信号而非虚假相关性。

Conclusion: MemLens方法有效检测LLM的记忆化现象，为评估模型在受污染基准上的真实能力提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are commonly evaluated on challenging benchmarks
such as AIME and Math500, which are susceptible to contamination and risk of
being memorized. Existing detection methods, which primarily rely on
surface-level lexical overlap and perplexity, demonstrate low generalization
and degrade significantly when encountering implicitly contaminated data. In
this paper, we propose MemLens (An Activation Lens for Memorization Detection)
to detect memorization by analyzing the probability trajectories of numeric
tokens during generation. Our method reveals that contaminated samples exhibit
``shortcut'' behaviors, locking onto an answer with high confidence in the
model's early layers, whereas clean samples show more gradual evidence
accumulation across the model's full depth. We observe that contaminated and
clean samples exhibit distinct and well-separated reasoning trajectories. To
further validate this, we inject carefully designed samples into the model
through LoRA fine-tuning and observe the same trajectory patterns as in
naturally contaminated data. These results provide strong evidence that MemLens
captures genuine signals of memorization rather than spurious correlations.

### [37] [Cross-Linguistic Analysis of Memory Load in Sentence Comprehension: Linear Distance and Structural Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20916)
*Krishna Aggarwal*

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This study examines whether sentence-level memory load in comprehension is
better explained by linear proximity between syntactically related words or by
the structural density of the intervening material. Building on locality-based
accounts and cross-linguistic evidence for dependency length minimization, the
work advances Intervener Complexity-the number of intervening heads between a
head and its dependent-as a structurally grounded lens that refines linear
distance measures. Using harmonized dependency treebanks and a mixed-effects
framework across multiple languages, the analysis jointly evaluates sentence
length, dependency length, and Intervener Complexity as predictors of the
Memory-load measure. Studies in Psycholinguistics have reported the
contributions of feature interference and misbinding to memory load during
processing. For this study, I operationalized sentence-level memory load as the
linear sum of feature misbinding and feature interference for tractability;
current evidence does not establish that their cognitive contributions combine
additively. All three factors are positively associated with memory load, with
sentence length exerting the broadest influence and Intervener Complexity
offering explanatory power beyond linear distance. Conceptually, the findings
reconcile linear and hierarchical perspectives on locality by treating
dependency length as an important surface signature while identifying
intervening heads as a more proximate indicator of integration and maintenance
demands. Methodologically, the study illustrates how UD-based graph measures
and cross-linguistic mixed-effects modelling can disentangle linear and
structural contributions to processing efficiency, providing a principled path
for evaluating competing theories of memory load in sentence comprehension.

Motivation: 当前工具调用研究主要集中于英语，缺乏对阿拉伯语等其他语言的研究，需要了解如何为阿拉伯语开发有效的工具调用功能。

Method: 使用开源阿拉伯语LLM的基础和训练后变体进行实验，将两个开源工具调用数据集翻译和适配为阿拉伯语版本，研究三种关键策略的效果。

Result: 研究结果为开发阿拉伯语工具增强智能体提供了关键见解，揭示了不同策略对工具调用性能的影响。

Conclusion: 本研究填补了阿拉伯语工具调用研究的空白，为开发非英语语言的工具调用能力提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Tool calling is a critical capability that allows Large Language Models
(LLMs) to interact with external systems, significantly expanding their
utility. However, research and resources for tool calling are predominantly
English-centric, leaving a gap in our understanding of how to enable this
functionality for other languages, such as Arabic. This paper investigates
three key research questions: (1) the necessity of in-language (Arabic)
tool-calling data versus relying on cross-lingual transfer, (2) the effect of
general-purpose instruction tuning on tool-calling performance, and (3) the
value of fine-tuning on specific, high-priority tools. To address these
questions, we conduct extensive experiments using base and post-trained
variants of an open-weight Arabic LLM. To enable this study, we bridge the
resource gap by translating and adapting two open-source tool-calling datasets
into Arabic. Our findings provide crucial insights into the optimal strategies
for developing robust tool-augmented agents for Arabic.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can act as evaluators, a role studied by methods
like LLM-as-a-Judge and fine-tuned judging LLMs. In the field of education,
LLMs have been studied as assistant tools for students and teachers. Our
research investigates LLM-driven automatic evaluation systems for academic
Text-Input Problems using rubrics. We propose five evaluation systems that have
been tested on a custom dataset of 110 answers about computer science from
higher education students with three models: JudgeLM, Llama-3.1-8B and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. The evaluation systems include: The JudgeLM
evaluation, which uses the model's single answer prompt to obtain a score;
Reference Aided Evaluation, which uses a correct answer as a guide aside from
the original context of the question; No Reference Evaluation, which ommits the
reference answer; Additive Evaluation, which uses atomic criteria; and Adaptive
Evaluation, which is an evaluation done with generated criteria fitted to each
question. All evaluation methods have been compared with the results of a human
evaluator. Results show that the best method to automatically evaluate and
score Text-Input Problems using LLMs is Reference Aided Evaluation. With the
lowest median absolute deviation (0.945) and the lowest root mean square
deviation (1.214) when compared to human evaluation, Reference Aided Evaluation
offers fair scoring as well as insightful and complete evaluations. Other
methods such as Additive and Adaptive Evaluation fail to provide good results
in concise answers, No Reference Evaluation lacks information needed to
correctly assess questions and JudgeLM Evaluations have not provided good
results due to the model's limitations. As a result, we conclude that
Artificial Intelligence-driven automatic evaluation systems, aided with proper
methodologies, show potential to work as complementary tools to other academic
resources.

Motivation: 探索因果掩码作为位置信息源的作用，分析其与显式位置编码（如RoPE）的相互作用。

Method: 理论分析因果掩码如何诱导位置依赖的注意力模式，并通过实证分析验证训练模型中的这种现象。

Result: 因果掩码能诱导偏向邻近查询-键对的注意力模式，与RoPE相互作用会扭曲其相对注意力得分模式为非相对模式。

Conclusion: 因果掩码应被视为与显式位置编码同等重要的位置信息源，在现代大语言模型中普遍存在这种效应。

Abstract: While explicit positional encodings such as RoPE are a primary source of
positional information in Transformer decoders, the causal mask also provides
positional information. In this work, we prove that the causal mask can induce
position-dependent patterns in attention scores, even without parameters or
causal dependency in the input. Our theoretical analysis indicates that the
induced attention pattern tends to favor nearby query-key pairs, mirroring the
behavior of common positional encodings. Empirical analysis confirms that
trained models exhibit the same behavior, with learned parameters further
amplifying these patterns. Notably, we found that the interaction of causal
mask and RoPE distorts RoPE's relative attention score patterns into
non-relative ones. We consistently observed this effect in modern large
language models, suggesting the importance of considering the causal mask as a
source of positional information alongside explicit positional encodings.

Motivation: 随着LLMs在现实场景中的应用增加，需要系统评估其同时遵循多个指令的能力，这对实际应用至关重要。

Method: 创建两个基准测试：ManyIFEval（文本生成，最多10个指令）和StyleMBPP（代码生成，最多6个指令）；开发三种回归模型来预测未见指令组合的性能。

Result: 实验显示随着指令数量增加，所有10个LLMs的性能都持续下降；逻辑回归模型使用指令数量作为解释变量，能够以约10%的误差预测多指令遵循性能。

Conclusion: 相对较小的样本量（500和300）足以进行性能估计，能够高效评估LLMs在各种指令组合下的表现。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world
scenarios, it becomes crucial to understand their ability to follow multiple
instructions simultaneously. To systematically evaluate these capabilities, we
introduce two specialized benchmarks for fundamental domains where multiple
instructions following is important: Many Instruction-Following Eval
(ManyIFEval) for text generation with up to ten instructions, and Style-aware
Mostly Basic Programming Problems (StyleMBPP) for code generation with up to
six instructions. Our experiments with the created benchmarks across ten LLMs
reveal that performance consistently degrades as the number of instructions
increases. Furthermore, given the fact that evaluating all the possible
combinations of multiple instructions is computationally impractical in actual
use cases, we developed three types of regression models that can estimate
performance on both unseen instruction combinations and different numbers of
instructions which are not used during training. We demonstrate that a logistic
regression model using instruction count as an explanatory variable can predict
performance of following multiple instructions with approximately 10% error,
even for unseen instruction combinations. We show that relatively modest sample
sizes (500 for ManyIFEval and 300 for StyleMBPP) are sufficient for performance
estimation, enabling efficient evaluation of LLMs under various instruction
combinations.

Motivation: 探索基础模型在复杂多模态工程问题上的能力，填补材料强度领域多模态评估的空白。

Method: 提出SoM-1K数据集，包含文本问题陈述和示意图；引入DoI（图像描述）提示策略，提供专家生成的文本描述作为上下文；评估8个代表性基础模型（LLM和VLM）。

Result: 当前基础模型在工程问题上表现显著不足，最佳模型准确率仅56.6%；LLM配合DoI通常优于VLM直接处理图像；DoI能有效减少视觉误解错误。

Conclusion: 为工程AI建立了严谨基准，强调需要开发更强大的多模态推理能力，特别是在科学和工程领域。

Abstract: Foundation models have shown remarkable capabilities in various domains, but
their performance on complex, multimodal engineering problems remains largely
unexplored. We introduce SoM-1K, the first large-scale multimodal benchmark
dataset dedicated to evaluating foundation models on problems in the strength
of materials (SoM). The dataset, which contains 1,065 annotated SoM problems,
mirrors real-world engineering tasks by including both textual problem
statements and schematic diagrams. Due to the limited capabilities of current
foundation models in understanding complicated visual information, we propose a
novel prompting strategy called Descriptions of Images (DoI), which provides
rigorous expert-generated text descriptions of the visual diagrams as the
context. We evaluate eight representative foundation models, including both
large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs). Our results
show that current foundation models struggle significantly with these
engineering problems, with the best-performing model achieving only 56.6%
accuracy. Interestingly, we found that LLMs, when provided with DoI, often
outperform VLMs provided with visual diagrams. A detailed error analysis
reveals that DoI plays a crucial role in mitigating visual misinterpretation
errors, suggesting that accurate text-based descriptions can be more effective
than direct image input for current foundation models. This work establishes a
rigorous benchmark for engineering AI and highlights a critical need for
developing more robust multimodal reasoning capabilities in foundation models,
particularly in scientific and engineering contexts.

### [44] [Which Cultural Lens Do Models Adopt? On Cultural Positioning Bias and Agentic Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21080)
*Yixin Wan,Xingrun Chen,Kai-Wei Chang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文识别并系统研究了LLMs中的文化定位偏见，即模型默认生成立场与主流文化对齐而将其他文化视为局外人。提出了CultureLens基准和两种推理时缓解方法，其中基于智能体的方法在减轻偏见方面表现有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在解锁下游生成应用的同时，也存在延续与文化相关的微妙公平性问题，其生成内容倾向于从主流美国文化视角出发，对非主流文化表现出明显的局外人态度。

Method: 提出CultureLens基准（4000个生成提示和3个评估指标），通过文化情境化访谈脚本生成任务量化偏见。提出两种推理时缓解方法：基于提示的FIP方法和基于智能体的MFA框架（包括单智能体自反思重写和多智能体分层协作）。

Result: 对5个最先进LLMs的实证评估显示：模型在美国情境脚本中平均88%以上采用内部人语气，但对非主流文化主要采用局外人立场。基于智能体的方法在减轻偏见方面表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 基于智能体的方法是减轻生成式LLMs偏见的有前景方向，能够有效缓解文化定位偏见问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have unlocked a wide range of downstream
generative applications. However, we found that they also risk perpetuating
subtle fairness issues tied to culture, positioning their generations from the
perspectives of the mainstream US culture while demonstrating salient
externality towards non-mainstream ones. In this work, we identify and
systematically investigate this novel culture positioning bias, in which an
LLM's default generative stance aligns with a mainstream view and treats other
cultures as outsiders. We propose the CultureLens benchmark with 4000
generation prompts and 3 evaluation metrics for quantifying this bias through
the lens of a culturally situated interview script generation task, in which an
LLM is positioned as an onsite reporter interviewing local people across 10
diverse cultures. Empirical evaluation on 5 state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a
stark pattern: while models adopt insider tones in over 88 percent of
US-contexted scripts on average, they disproportionately adopt mainly outsider
stances for less dominant cultures. To resolve these biases, we propose 2
inference-time mitigation methods: a baseline prompt-based Fairness
Intervention Pillars (FIP) method, and a structured Mitigation via Fairness
Agents (MFA) framework consisting of 2 pipelines: (1) MFA-SA (Single-Agent)
introduces a self-reflection and rewriting loop based on fairness guidelines.
(2) MFA-MA (Multi-Agent) structures the process into a hierarchy of specialized
agents: a Planner Agent(initial script generation), a Critique Agent (evaluates
initial script against fairness pillars), and a Refinement Agent (incorporates
feedback to produce a polished, unbiased script). Empirical results showcase
the effectiveness of agent-based methods as a promising direction for
mitigating biases in generative LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PerHalluEval是首个针对波斯语的动态幻觉评估基准，通过三阶段LLM驱动流程生成可信的问答和摘要，专门检测外在和内在幻觉。评估12个LLM发现模型普遍难以检测波斯语幻觉，提供外部知识可部分缓解幻觉，波斯语专门训练的模型表现无显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在低资源语言（如波斯语）中普遍存在的幻觉问题，建立首个波斯语幻觉评估基准。

Method: 使用三阶段LLM驱动流程生成可信答案和摘要，结合人类验证，利用生成token的对数概率选择最可信的幻觉实例，并让人类标注者突出波斯特定文化内容。

Result: 评估的12个LLM普遍难以检测波斯语幻觉，提供原始文档可部分缓解幻觉，波斯语专门训练模型与其他模型在幻觉方面无显著差异。

Conclusion: LLMs在波斯语幻觉检测方面表现不佳，需要更多针对低资源语言的专门研究和改进。

Abstract: Hallucination is a persistent issue affecting all large language Models
(LLMs), particularly within low-resource languages such as Persian.
PerHalluEval (Persian Hallucination Evaluation) is the first dynamic
hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored for the Persian language. Our
benchmark leverages a three-stage LLM-driven pipeline, augmented with human
validation, to generate plausible answers and summaries regarding QA and
summarization tasks, focusing on detecting extrinsic and intrinsic
hallucinations. Moreover, we used the log probabilities of generated tokens to
select the most believable hallucinated instances. In addition, we engaged
human annotators to highlight Persian-specific contexts in the QA dataset in
order to evaluate LLMs' performance on content specifically related to Persian
culture. Our evaluation of 12 LLMs, including open- and closed-source models
using PerHalluEval, revealed that the models generally struggle in detecting
hallucinated Persian text. We showed that providing external knowledge, i.e.,
the original document for the summarization task, could mitigate hallucination
partially. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in terms of
hallucination when comparing LLMs specifically trained for Persian with others.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了BESPOKE基准，用于评估搜索增强LLM的个性化能力，通过收集真实用户聊天和搜索历史，提供细粒度偏好评分和反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有搜索增强LLM在满足多样化用户需求方面仍不足，需要识别同一查询在不同用户中的不同意图，并以偏好形式提供信息。虽然ChatGPT和Gemini等系统尝试利用用户历史进行个性化，但系统化评估仍不足。

Method: 通过长期深入的人工标注构建BESPOKE基准，收集真实用户的聊天和搜索历史，用户贡献自己的历史、编写详细信息需求的查询，并用评分和诊断反馈评估响应。

Result: 利用BESPOKE进行系统分析，揭示了信息寻求任务中有效个性化的关键要求，为个性化搜索增强LLM的细粒度评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: BESPOKE基准为评估搜索增强LLM的个性化能力提供了现实和诊断性的工具，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) have advanced
information-seeking tasks by integrating retrieval into generation, reducing
users' cognitive burden compared to traditional search systems. Yet they remain
insufficient for fully addressing diverse user needs, which requires
recognizing how the same query can reflect different intents across users and
delivering information in preferred forms. While recent systems such as ChatGPT
and Gemini attempt personalization by leveraging user histories, systematic
evaluation of such personalization is under-explored. To address this gap, we
propose BESPOKE, the realistic benchmark for evaluating personalization in
search-augmented LLMs. BESPOKE is designed to be both realistic, by collecting
authentic chat and search histories directly from humans, and diagnostic, by
pairing responses with fine-grained preference scores and feedback. The
benchmark is constructed through long-term, deeply engaged human annotation,
where human annotators contributed their own histories, authored queries with
detailed information needs, and evaluated responses with scores and diagnostic
feedback. Leveraging BESPOKE, we conduct systematic analyses that reveal key
requirements for effective personalization in information-seeking tasks,
providing a foundation for fine-grained evaluation of personalized
search-augmented LLMs. Our code and data are available at

### [47] [VoiceBBQ: Investigating Effect of Content and Acoustics in Social Bias of Spoken Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21108)
*Junhyuk Choi,Ro-hoon Oh,Jihwan Seol,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VoiceBBQ是一个语音版本的BBQ偏见基准数据集，用于评估语音语言模型在内容和声学两个方面的社会偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语音的特性，语音语言模型的社会偏见可能来自内容和声学两个不同来源，需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 将BBQ数据集的所有上下文转换为受控的语音条件，计算每个维度的准确性、偏见和一致性得分。

Result: 评估LLaMA-Omni和Qwen2-Audio两个模型发现：LLaMA-Omni抵抗声学偏见但放大性别和口音偏见，Qwen2-Audio则显著抑制这些线索同时保持内容保真度。

Conclusion: VoiceBBQ提供了一个紧凑的测试平台，用于联合诊断语音语言模型的内容和声学偏见。

Abstract: We introduce VoiceBBQ, a spoken extension of the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for
Question Answering) - a dataset that measures social bias by presenting
ambiguous or disambiguated contexts followed by questions that may elicit
stereotypical responses. Due to the nature of speech, social bias in Spoken
Language Models (SLMs) can emerge from two distinct sources: 1) content aspect
and 2) acoustic aspect. The dataset converts every BBQ context into controlled
voice conditions, enabling per-axis accuracy, bias, and consistency scores that
remain comparable to the original text benchmark. Using VoiceBBQ, we evaluate
two SLMs - LLaMA-Omni and Qwen2-Audio - and observe architectural contrasts:
LLaMA-Omni resists acoustic bias while amplifying gender and accent bias,
whereas Qwen2-Audio substantially dampens these cues while preserving content
fidelity. VoiceBBQ thus provides a compact, drop-in testbed for jointly
diagnosing content and acoustic bias across spoken language models.

*Junhyuk Choi,Jihwan Seol,Nayeon Kim,Chanhee Cho,EunBin Cho,Bugeun Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文发现语音语言模型存在性别偏见悖论：在性别刻板印象问题中表现出男性导向响应，但在需要性别区分的语境中却忽视性别信息，这种偏见主要源于Whisper语音编码器产生的男性导向声学标记。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音语言模型可能在语音交互中基于说话者性别产生不同响应，存在基于声学的性别区分问题，需要系统分析这种现象。

Method: 构建包含9,208个语音样本的数据集，分为性别无关、性别刻板印象和性别依赖三类，评估LLaMA-Omni系列模型，分析响应模式并追溯偏见来源。

Result: 发现悖论模式：在性别刻板印象问题中模型一致表现出男性导向响应，而在需要性别区分的语境中却忽视性别信息；这种模式源于Whisper语音编码器产生的男性导向声学标记。

Conclusion: 当前语音语言模型未能成功消除性别偏见，虽然优先考虑一般公平原则但忽视了语境适当性，需要更复杂的技术来正确处理语音技术中的性别信息。

Abstract: Speech-aware Language Models (SpeechLMs) have fundamentally transformed
human-AI interaction by enabling voice-based communication, yet they may
exhibit acoustic-based gender differentiation where identical questions lead to
different responses based on the speaker's gender. This paper propose a new
dataset that enables systematic analysis of this phenomenon, containing 9,208
speech samples across three categories: Gender-Independent,
Gender-Stereotypical, and Gender-Dependent. We further evaluated LLaMA-Omni
series and discovered a paradoxical pattern; while overall responses seems
identical regardless of gender, the pattern is far from unbiased responses.
Specifically, in Gender-Stereotypical questions, all models consistently
exhibited male-oriented responses; meanwhile, in Gender-Dependent questions
where gender differentiation would be contextually appropriate, models
exhibited responses independent to gender instead. We also confirm that this
pattern does not result from neutral options nor perceived gender of a voice.
When we allow neutral response, models tends to respond neutrally also in
Gender-Dependent questions. The paradoxical pattern yet retains when we applied
gender neutralization methods on speech. Through comparison between SpeechLMs
with corresponding backbone LLMs, we confirmed that these paradoxical patterns
primarily stem from Whisper speech encoders, which generates male-oriented
acoustic tokens. These findings reveal that current SpeechLMs may not
successfully remove gender biases though they prioritized general fairness
principles over contextual appropriateness, highlighting the need for more
sophisticated techniques to utilize gender information properly in speech
technology.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ROC框架，将多模态关系抽取重新定义为基于关系语义的检索任务，通过整合实体类型和位置信息、将关系标签扩展为自然语言描述，实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态关系抽取方法采用基于分类的范式，存在两个主要局限：忽视实体类型和位置线索等结构约束，以及缺乏细粒度关系理解的语义表达能力。

Method: ROC框架使用多模态编码器整合实体类型和位置信息，利用大语言模型将关系标签扩展为自然语言描述，通过基于语义相似度的对比学习对齐实体-关系对。

Result: 在MNRE和MORE基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并展现出更强的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Conclusion: ROC框架通过将多模态关系抽取重新定义为检索任务，有效克服了传统分类方法的局限性，在性能和可解释性方面都有显著提升。

Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify semantic relations between entities
in unstructured text. Although recent work extends traditional RE to multimodal
scenarios, most approaches still adopt classification-based paradigms with
fused multimodal features, representing relations as discrete labels. This
paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) it overlooks structural
constraints like entity types and positional cues, and (2) it lacks semantic
expressiveness for fine-grained relation understanding. We propose
\underline{R}etrieval \underline{O}ver \underline{C}lassification (ROC), a
novel framework that reformulates multimodal RE as a retrieval task driven by
relation semantics. ROC integrates entity type and positional information
through a multimodal encoder, expands relation labels into natural language
descriptions using a large language model, and aligns entity-relation pairs via
semantic similarity-based contrastive learning. Experiments show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets MNRE and
MORE and exhibits stronger robustness and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM训练数据中存在句法模板与任务领域之间的虚假相关性，这种相关性会干扰模型对指令语义的理解，导致模型性能下降，甚至可能被用于绕过安全微调机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM需要同时理解指令的语义和领域才能正确响应，但训练数据中句法模板与领域之间的虚假相关性可能导致模型学习到错误的关联，从而影响模型性能和安全机制。

Method: 使用合成训练数据集分析句法-领域相关性对模型性能的影响，开发评估框架检测已训练模型中的这种现象，并通过案例研究探讨其对安全微调的影响。

Result: 句法-领域相关性显著降低了OLMo-2模型在实体知识任务上的性能（平均0.51±0.06），在多个开源和闭源模型中都发现了这种现象，且可能被用于绕过安全拒绝机制。

Conclusion: 需要显式测试句法-领域相关性，并确保训练数据中领域内的句法多样性，以防止此类虚假相关性影响模型性能和安全机制。

Abstract: For an LLM to correctly respond to an instruction it must understand both the
semantics and the domain (i.e., subject area) of a given task-instruction pair.
However, syntax can also convey implicit information Recent work shows that
syntactic templates--frequent sequences of Part-of-Speech (PoS) tags--are
prevalent in training data and often appear in model outputs. In this work we
characterize syntactic templates, domain, and semantics in task-instruction
pairs. We identify cases of spurious correlations between syntax and domain,
where models learn to associate a domain with syntax during training; this can
sometimes override prompt semantics. Using a synthetic training dataset, we
find that the syntactic-domain correlation can lower performance (mean 0.51 +/-
0.06) on entity knowledge tasks in OLMo-2 models (1B-13B). We introduce an
evaluation framework to detect this phenomenon in trained models, and show that
it occurs on a subset of the FlanV2 dataset in open (OLMo-2-7B;
Llama-4-Maverick), and closed (GPT-4o) models. Finally, we present a case study
on the implications for safety finetuning, showing that unintended
syntactic-domain correlations can be used to bypass refusals in OLMo-2-7B
Instruct and GPT-4o. Our findings highlight two needs: (1) to explicitly test
for syntactic-domain correlations, and (2) to ensure syntactic diversity in
training data, specifically within domains, to prevent such spurious
correlations.

Motivation: 幽默是人类的基本特质，其计算理解是NLP中最具挑战性的任务之一。幽默作为抽象、创造性且依赖上下文的概念，需要大量推理来理解和创造，因此是评估现代大语言模型常识知识和推理能力的合适任务。

Method: 本文通过文献综述的方法，系统梳理了计算幽默领域的研究现状，特别是幽默生成和解释任务的发展情况。

Result: 研究发现，尽管幽默理解具有基础NLP任务的所有特征，但在双关语之外的幽默生成和解释研究仍然稀少，最先进的模型在幽默能力上仍落后于人类。

Conclusion: 作者强调了计算幽默处理作为NLP子学科的重要性，并基于幽默的主观性和伦理模糊性，提出了该领域未来研究的广泛方向。

Abstract: The creation and perception of humour is a fundamental human trait,
positioning its computational understanding as one of the most challenging
tasks in natural language processing (NLP). As an abstract, creative, and
frequently context-dependent construct, humour requires extensive reasoning to
understand and create, making it a pertinent task for assessing the
common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities of modern large language models
(LLMs). In this work, we survey the landscape of computational humour as it
pertains to the generative tasks of creation and explanation. We observe that,
despite the task of understanding humour bearing all the hallmarks of a
foundational NLP task, work on generating and explaining humour beyond puns
remains sparse, while state-of-the-art models continue to fall short of human
capabilities. We bookend our literature survey by motivating the importance of
computational humour processing as a subdiscipline of NLP and presenting an
extensive discussion of future directions for research in the area that takes
into account the subjective and ethically ambiguous nature of humour.

Motivation: 小语言模型在特定领域表现接近大语言模型且能耗更低，但其在下游任务中的个人身份信息泄露风险尚未被充分研究，特别是在医疗领域。

Method: 首先基于BioGPT微调ChatBioGPT医疗聊天机器人，然后提出GEP方法——一种专门针对PII提取的贪心坐标梯度方法，用于检测模型泄露。

Result: GEP方法相比传统模板攻击方法，PII泄露检测效果提升高达60倍；在更复杂的自由格式插入场景下，仍能检测到4.53%的泄露率。

Conclusion: 小语言模型在医疗领域存在显著的个人身份信息泄露风险，GEP方法能有效检测此类泄露，为模型安全性评估提供新工具。

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) become unprecedentedly appealing due to their
approximately equivalent performance compared to large language models (LLMs)
in certain fields with less energy and time consumption during training and
inference. However, the personally identifiable information (PII) leakage of
SLMs for downstream tasks has yet to be explored. In this study, we investigate
the PII leakage of the chatbot based on SLM. We first finetune a new chatbot,
i.e., ChatBioGPT based on the backbone of BioGPT using medical datasets Alpaca
and HealthCareMagic. It shows a matchable performance in BERTscore compared
with previous studies of ChatDoctor and ChatGPT. Based on this model, we prove
that the previous template-based PII attacking methods cannot effectively
extract the PII in the dataset for leakage detection under the SLM condition.
We then propose GEP, which is a greedy coordinate gradient-based (GCG) method
specifically designed for PII extraction. We conduct experimental studies of
GEP and the results show an increment of up to 60$\times$ more leakage compared
with the previous template-based methods. We further expand the capability of
GEP in the case of a more complicated and realistic situation by conducting
free-style insertion where the inserted PII in the dataset is in the form of
various syntactic expressions instead of fixed templates, and GEP is still able
to reveal a PII leakage rate of up to 4.53%.

TL;DR: 提出统一框架结合隐式检索和结构化协作，解决LLM科学推理中的检索碎片化和多智能体平均化问题，在HLE Bio/Chem Gold上达到48.3%准确率，同时显著降低token使用和智能体步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM科学推理中的两个主要瓶颈：显式检索导致推理碎片化（产生额外token和步骤的"工具税"），以及多智能体管道通过平均所有候选方案稀释强解。

Method: 基于Monitor的检索模块在token级别操作，最小化干扰地集成外部知识；分层解决方案精炼(HSR)迭代指定每个候选作为锚点由同伴修复；质量感知迭代推理(QAIR)根据解决方案质量调整精炼。

Result: 在HLE Bio/Chem Gold上达到48.3%准确率（迄今最高），比最强智能体基线高13.4分，领先前沿LLM达18.1分，同时减少53.5%的token使用和43.7%的智能体步骤。

Conclusion: 隐式增强和结构化精炼克服了显式工具使用和统一聚合的低效性，错误分析显示85%以上案例中推理失败和知识缺口共存，多样性分析揭示检索任务受益于解决方案多样性而推理任务偏好共识。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong progress on
scientific reasoning, yet two major bottlenecks remain. First, explicit
retrieval fragments reasoning, imposing a hidden "tool tax" of extra tokens and
steps. Second, multi-agent pipelines often dilute strong solutions by averaging
across all candidates. We address these challenges with a unified framework
that combines implicit retrieval and structured collaboration. At its
foundation, a Monitor-based retrieval module operates at the token level,
integrating external knowledge with minimal disruption to reasoning. On top of
this substrate, Hierarchical Solution Refinement (HSR) iteratively designates
each candidate as an anchor to be repaired by its peers, while Quality-Aware
Iterative Reasoning (QAIR) adapts refinement to solution quality. On Humanity's
Last Exam (HLE) Bio/Chem Gold, our framework achieves 48.3\% accuracy -- the
highest reported to date, surpassing the strongest agent baseline by 13.4
points and leading frontier LLMs by up to 18.1 points, while simultaneously
reducing token usage by 53.5\% and agent steps by 43.7\%. Results on SuperGPQA
and TRQA confirm robustness across domains. Error analysis shows that reasoning
failures and knowledge gaps co-occur in over 85\% of cases, while diversity
analysis reveals a clear dichotomy: retrieval tasks benefit from solution
variety, whereas reasoning tasks favor consensus. Together, these findings
demonstrate how implicit augmentation and structured refinement overcome the
inefficiencies of explicit tool use and uniform aggregation. Code is available

TL;DR: CLaw是一个专门评估LLM中文法律知识和推理能力的新基准，包含306部中国国家法规的细粒度语料库和254个基于案例的推理实例，揭示了当前LLM在准确引用法律条文方面的显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在法律文本分析和法规引用方面可靠性不足，因为通用预训练缺乏对法律知识的专门关注，需要专门的评估基准来检验其真实法律知识深度。

Method: 构建CLaw基准，包含：(1) 306部中国国家法规的细粒度语料库（64,849条目），按子段落分割并包含历史修订时间；(2) 254个基于最高法院案例的推理实例。

Result: 实证评估显示大多数当代LLM在准确复现法律条文方面表现不佳，这严重影响了其法律推理的可靠性。

Conclusion: 实现可信赖的法律推理需要准确知识检索（通过SFT或RAG增强）与强大通用推理能力的稳健协同，该工作为推进领域特定LLM推理提供了重要基准和关键见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with analyzing legal
texts and citing relevant statutes, yet their reliability is often compromised
by general pre-training that ingests legal texts without specialized focus,
obscuring the true depth of their legal knowledge. This paper introduces CLaw,
a novel benchmark specifically engineered to meticulously evaluate LLMs on
Chinese legal knowledge and its application in reasoning. CLaw comprises two
key components: (1) a comprehensive, fine-grained corpus of all 306 Chinese
national statutes, segmented to the subparagraph level and incorporating
precise historical revision timesteps for rigorous recall evaluation (64,849
entries), and (2) a challenging set of 254 case-based reasoning instances
derived from China Supreme Court curated materials to assess the practical
application of legal knowledge. Our empirical evaluation reveals that most
contemporary LLMs significantly struggle to faithfully reproduce legal
provisions. As accurate retrieval and citation of legal provisions form the
basis of legal reasoning, this deficiency critically undermines the reliability
of their responses. We contend that achieving trustworthy legal reasoning in
LLMs requires a robust synergy of accurate knowledge retrieval--potentially
enhanced through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG)--and strong general reasoning capabilities. This work provides an
essential benchmark and critical insights for advancing domain-specific LLM
reasoning, particularly within the complex legal sphere.

Motivation: 现有基于事实提取或摘要的方法在组织不同粒度的对话信息和生成记忆方面存在困难，需要更有效的内存管理来处理长对话历史。

Method: SGMem将对话表示为分块单元内的句子级图，捕捉轮次、回合和会话级别的关联，结合检索的原始对话与生成的记忆（摘要、事实和见解）。

Result: 在LongMemEval和LoCoMo数据集上的实验表明，SGMem持续提高准确性，在长期对话问答中优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: SGMem通过句子图结构有效组织多粒度对话信息，为LLM提供连贯相关的上下文，显著提升长期对话代理的性能。

Abstract: Long-term conversational agents require effective memory management to handle
dialogue histories that exceed the context window of large language models
(LLMs). Existing methods based on fact extraction or summarization reduce
redundancy but struggle to organize and retrieve relevant information across
different granularities of dialogue and generated memory. We introduce SGMem
(Sentence Graph Memory), which represents dialogue as sentence-level graphs
within chunked units, capturing associations across turn-, round-, and
session-level contexts. By combining retrieved raw dialogue with generated
memory such as summaries, facts and insights, SGMem supplies LLMs with coherent
and relevant context for response generation. Experiments on LongMemEval and
LoCoMo show that SGMem consistently improves accuracy and outperforms strong
baselines in long-term conversational question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图RAG方法面临粒度困境：细粒度实体级图导致高token成本和上下文丢失，而粗粒度文档级图无法捕捉细微关系。

Method: 利用Doc2Query和Doc2Query--构建可控粒度的查询中心图，并采用定制的多跳检索机制通过生成的查询选择相关块。

Result: 在LiHuaWorld和MultiHop-RAG数据集上的实验表明，QCG-RAG在问答准确性上持续优于现有的基于块和基于图的RAG方法。

Conclusion: QCG-RAG为多跳推理建立了一个新范式，通过查询中心的方法提高了图质量和可解释性。

Abstract: Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches large language
models (LLMs) with external knowledge for long-context understanding and
multi-hop reasoning, but existing methods face a granularity dilemma:
fine-grained entity-level graphs incur high token costs and lose context, while
coarse document-level graphs fail to capture nuanced relations. We introduce
QCG-RAG, a query-centric graph RAG framework that enables query-granular
indexing and multi-hop chunk retrieval. Our query-centric approach leverages
Doc2Query and Doc2Query{-}{-} to construct query-centric graphs with
controllable granularity, improving graph quality and interpretability. A
tailored multi-hop retrieval mechanism then selects relevant chunks via the
generated queries. Experiments on LiHuaWorld and MultiHop-RAG show that QCG-RAG
consistently outperforms prior chunk-based and graph-based RAG methods in
question answering accuracy, establishing a new paradigm for multi-hop
reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文研究了扩散模型中的同音词重复问题，即当提示中出现同音词时，模型会同时生成该词的多个含义。作者提出了测量重复率的方法，并评估了不同扩散模型，同时探索了通过提示扩展来缓解该问题的方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同音词（拼写相同但含义不同的词）给生成模型带来挑战，扩散模型在处理同音词时会产生多个含义的重复生成。此外，英语中心偏见进一步加剧了这个问题，因为非英语词汇在翻译成英语后可能变成同音词而失去原意。

Method: 提出了测量重复率的方法，使用视觉语言模型（VLM）进行自动评估和人工评估来测试不同扩散模型。同时研究了通过提示扩展来减轻同音词重复问题的方法。

Result: 评估结果显示扩散模型确实存在同音词重复问题。通过提示扩展的方法被证明能有效减少重复率，并且也能缓解英语中心偏见相关的重复问题。

Conclusion: 同音词重复是扩散模型中的一个重要问题，特别是在存在英语中心偏见的情况下。提示扩展是一种有效的缓解策略，自动评估代码已公开提供。

Abstract: Homonyms are words with identical spelling but distinct meanings, which pose
challenges for many generative models. When a homonym appears in a prompt,
diffusion models may generate multiple senses of the word simultaneously, which
is known as homonym duplication. This issue is further complicated by an
Anglocentric bias, which includes an additional translation step before the
text-to-image model pipeline. As a result, even words that are not homonymous
in the original language may become homonyms and lose their meaning after
translation into English. In this paper, we introduce a method for measuring
duplication rates and conduct evaluations of different diffusion models using
both automatic evaluation utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLM) and human
evaluation. Additionally, we investigate methods to mitigate the homonym
duplication problem through prompt expansion, demonstrating that this approach
also effectively reduces duplication related to Anglocentric bias. The code for
the automatic evaluation pipeline is publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出任务依赖的输出同质化评估与缓解方法，包括任务分类学、功能多样性评估和任务锚定采样技术，在保持质量的同时提升多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作未能以任务依赖的方式概念化多样性，不同任务对输出同质化的定义和期望不同，需要针对性的解决方案。

Method: 1) 建立包含8个任务类别的分类学；2) 引入任务锚定功能多样性评估；3) 提出任务锚定采样技术；4) 挑战多样性-质量权衡观念。

Result: 成功提升了功能多样性同时保持了响应质量，验证了任务依赖方法在评估和缓解输出同质化方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 任务依赖的方法显著改进了输出同质化的评估和缓解，证明了在保持质量的同时提升多样性是可行的。

Abstract: A large language model can be less helpful if it exhibits output response
homogenization. But whether two responses are considered homogeneous, and
whether such homogenization is problematic, both depend on the task category.
For instance, in objective math tasks, we often expect no variation in the
final answer but anticipate variation in the problem-solving strategy. Whereas,
for creative writing tasks, we may expect variation in key narrative components
(e.g. plot, genre, setting, etc), beyond the vocabulary or embedding diversity
produced by temperature-sampling. Previous work addressing output
homogenization often fails to conceptualize diversity in a task-dependent way.
We address this gap in the literature directly by making the following
contributions. (1) We present a task taxonomy comprised of eight task
categories that each have distinct conceptualizations of output homogenization.
(2) We introduce task-anchored functional diversity to better evaluate output
homogenization. (3) We propose a task-anchored sampling technique that
increases functional diversity for task categories where homogenization is
undesired, while preserving homogenization where it is desired. (4) We
challenge the perceived existence of a diversity-quality trade-off by
increasing functional diversity while maintaining response quality. Overall, we
demonstrate how task dependence improves the evaluation and mitigation of
output homogenization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集存在局限性：使用过时模型生成、主要为英语、缺乏混合人机作者场景，且没有字符级标注来精确定位AI生成片段。

Method: 使用多样化的现代专有和开源LLM构建双语数据集，提供字符级标注以支持AI生成区间检测。

Result: 开发了LLMTrace语料库，包含英语和俄语文本，支持传统全文分类和新的AI区间检测任务。

Conclusion: LLMTrace将成为训练和评估下一代更细致、实用的AI检测模型的重要资源。

Abstract: The widespread use of human-like text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
necessitates the development of robust detection systems. However, progress is
limited by a critical lack of suitable training data; existing datasets are
often generated with outdated models, are predominantly in English, and fail to
address the increasingly common scenario of mixed human-AI authorship.
Crucially, while some datasets address mixed authorship, none provide the
character-level annotations required for the precise localization of
AI-generated segments within a text. To address these gaps, we introduce
LLMTrace, a new large-scale, bilingual (English and Russian) corpus for
AI-generated text detection. Constructed using a diverse range of modern
proprietary and open-source LLMs, our dataset is designed to support two key
tasks: traditional full-text binary classification (human vs. AI) and the novel
task of AI-generated interval detection, facilitated by character-level
annotations. We believe LLMTrace will serve as a vital resource for training
and evaluating the next generation of more nuanced and practical AI detection
models. The project page is available at

Motivation: 现有研究表明思维链输出对输入扰动敏感，但缺乏理论解释，这限制了理解扰动在推理过程中的传播机制和提示优化方法的改进。

Method: 理论推导输入扰动上界，并在线性自注意力模型中验证该上界与输入嵌入和隐藏状态向量范数的负相关性，最后在三个主流数据集和四个模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验结果表明理论分析与实验结果一致，证实了输入扰动上界与推理步数正相关，且无限推理无法消除扰动影响。

Conclusion: 本文为理解输入扰动对思维链输出的影响提供了理论框架，揭示了扰动传播的基本规律，有助于改进提示优化方法。

Abstract: Existing research indicates that the output of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) is
significantly affected by input perturbations. Although many methods aim to
mitigate such impact by optimizing prompts, a theoretical explanation of how
these perturbations influence CoT outputs remains an open area of research.
This gap limits our in-depth understanding of how input perturbations propagate
during the reasoning process and hinders further improvements in prompt
optimization methods. Therefore, in this paper, we theoretically analyze the
effect of input perturbations on the fluctuation of CoT outputs. We first
derive an upper bound for input perturbations under the condition that the
output fluctuation is within an acceptable range, based on which we prove that:
(i) This upper bound is positively correlated with the number of reasoning
steps in the CoT; (ii) Even an infinitely long reasoning process cannot
eliminate the impact of input perturbations. We then apply these conclusions to
the Linear Self-Attention (LSA) model, which can be viewed as a simplified
version of the Transformer. For the LSA model, we prove that the upper bound
for input perturbation is negatively correlated with the norms of the input
embedding and hidden state vectors. To validate this theoretical analysis, we
conduct experiments on three mainstream datasets and four mainstream models.
The experimental results align with our theoretical analysis, empirically
demonstrating the correctness of our findings.

TL;DR: DisCoCLIP是一个多模态编码器，通过结合冻结的CLIP视觉转换器和新型张量网络文本编码器，显式编码句法结构，显著提升视觉语言任务的组合推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在大规模图像-文本对齐方面表现出色，但往往忽略语言组合结构，导致在依赖词序和谓词-论元结构的任务上表现不佳。

Method: 使用组合范畴语法解析器解析句子生成分布词张量，通过张量分解降低参数数量，采用自监督对比损失进行端到端训练。

Result: 显著提升动词语义和词序敏感性：SVO-Probes动词准确率从77.6%提升至82.4%，ARO归因和关系得分分别提升超过9%和4%，在SVO-Swap基准上达到93.7%。

Conclusion: 通过张量网络嵌入显式语言结构能够产生可解释、参数高效的表示，大幅改善视觉语言任务中的组合推理能力。

Abstract: Recent vision-language models excel at large-scale image-text alignment but
often neglect the compositional structure of language, leading to failures on
tasks that hinge on word order and predicate-argument structure. We introduce
DisCoCLIP, a multimodal encoder that combines a frozen CLIP vision transformer
with a novel tensor network text encoder that explicitly encodes syntactic
structure. Sentences are parsed with a Combinatory Categorial Grammar parser to
yield distributional word tensors whose contractions mirror the sentence's
grammatical derivation. To keep the model efficient, high-order tensors are
factorized with tensor decompositions, reducing parameter count from tens of
millions to under one million. Trained end-to-end with a self-supervised
contrastive loss, DisCoCLIP markedly improves sensitivity to verb semantics and
word order: it raises CLIP's SVO-Probes verb accuracy from 77.6% to 82.4%,
boosts ARO attribution and relation scores by over 9% and 4%, and achieves
93.7% on a newly introduced SVO-Swap benchmark. These results demonstrate that
embedding explicit linguistic structure via tensor networks yields
interpretable, parameter-efficient representations that substantially improve
compositional reasoning in vision-language tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言环境下多语言AI系统的文化扎根问题，探索合成数据在多语言多文化背景下的有效性。

Method: 采用自下而上的生成策略，使用大型开源LLM（≥235B参数）基于语言特定的维基百科内容生成文化语境化的合成数据。

Result: 生成的合成数据质量高，在15个多语言数据集的下游评估中，使用Updesh微调的模型在生成任务上显著提升，在低中资源语言中改进最明显。

Conclusion: 有效的多语言AI需要结合上下文感知、文化扎根的多方面数据策展和生成策略。

Abstract: Developing AI systems that operate effectively across languages while
remaining culturally grounded is a long-standing challenge, particularly in
low-resource settings. Synthetic data provides a promising avenue, yet its
effectiveness in multilingual and multicultural contexts remains underexplored.
We investigate the creation and impact of synthetic, culturally contextualized
datasets for Indian languages through a bottom-up generation strategy that
prompts large open-source LLMs (>= 235B parameters) to ground data generation
in language-specific Wikipedia content. This approach complements the dominant
top-down paradigm of translating synthetic datasets from high-resource
languages such as English. We introduce Updesh, a high-quality large-scale
synthetic instruction-following dataset comprising 9.5M data points across 13
Indian languages, encompassing diverse reasoning and generative tasks with an
emphasis on long-context, multi-turn capabilities, and alignment with Indian
cultural contexts. A comprehensive evaluation incorporating both automated
metrics and human annotation across 10k assessments indicates that generated
data is high quality; though, human evaluation highlights areas for further
improvement. Additionally, we perform downstream evaluations by fine-tuning
models on our dataset and assessing the performance across 15 diverse
multilingual datasets. Models trained on Updesh consistently achieve
significant gains on generative tasks and remain competitive on multiple-choice
style NLU tasks. Notably, relative improvements are most pronounced in low and
medium-resource languages, narrowing their gap with high-resource languages.
These findings provide empirical evidence that effective multilingual AI
requires multi-faceted data curation and generation strategies that incorporate
context-aware, culturally grounded methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常表现出奉承行为，但尚不清楚这些行为是来自单一机制还是多个不同过程。

Method: 使用均值差方向、激活添加和子空间几何方法，在多个模型和数据集上分析奉承行为的表示结构。

Result: 三种行为在潜在空间中沿不同线性方向编码，可以独立放大或抑制而不影响其他行为，这种表示结构在不同模型家族和规模中保持一致。

Conclusion: 奉承行为对应着不同的、可独立操控的表示，而非单一机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit sycophantic behaviors -- such as
excessive agreement with or flattery of the user -- but it is unclear whether
these behaviors arise from a single mechanism or multiple distinct processes.
We decompose sycophancy into sycophantic agreement and sycophantic praise,
contrasting both with genuine agreement. Using difference-in-means directions,
activation additions, and subspace geometry across multiple models and
datasets, we show that: (1) the three behaviors are encoded along distinct
linear directions in latent space; (2) each behavior can be independently
amplified or suppressed without affecting the others; and (3) their
representational structure is consistent across model families and scales.
These results suggest that sycophantic behaviors correspond to distinct,
independently steerable representations.

Motivation: 解决RLHF缺乏可解释性和奖励黑客问题，以及RLVR仅限于正确性验证的局限性，希望结合人类反馈的灵活性和规则验证的精确性。

Method: 从自然语言反馈中提取可二元回答的原则（如信息准确性、代码可读性），将奖励模型训练构建为蕴含任务，判断响应是否满足任意原则。

Result: 在RM-Bench上达到86.2%，JudgeBench上81.4%（截至2025年9月排名第一），使用Qwen3-32B在MT-Bench、WildBench和Arena Hard v2上匹配或超越o3-mini和DeepSeek R1性能，推理成本不到5%。

Conclusion: RLBFF方法成功结合了人类反馈的多样性和规则验证的精确性，提供了可解释的奖励模型训练方法，并在多个基准测试中证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM
post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with
interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that
usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus
on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary
Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven
preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward
models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness.
RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g.
accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language
feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as
an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary
principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform
Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on
RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24,
2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time
to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry
models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to
align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the
performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of
MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLM产生的幻觉（视觉内容与生成文本不一致）影响模型可靠性，现有检测方法计算量大且增加延迟，需要更高效的检测方案。

Method: 训练传统ML模型基于VLM的NTP信号进行检测，NTP直接量化模型不确定性，低NTP值与幻觉高度相关。还引入语言NTP和VLM预测分数进行增强。

Result: NTP特征是有价值的幻觉预测因子，轻量级ML模型性能与强VLM相当。结合语言NTP和VLM预测分数可进一步提升检测性能。

Conclusion: NTP为基础的轻量级方法为增强VLM可靠性提供了简单有效的解决方案，有望推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Hallucinations of vision-language models (VLMs), which are misalignments
between visual content and generated text, undermine the reliability of VLMs.
One common approach for detecting them employs the same VLM, or a different
one, to assess generated outputs. This process is computationally intensive and
increases model latency. In this paper, we explore an efficient on-the-fly
method for hallucination detection by training traditional ML models over
signals based on the VLM's next-token probabilities (NTPs). NTPs provide a
direct quantification of model uncertainty. We hypothesize that high
uncertainty (i.e., a low NTP value) is strongly associated with hallucinations.
To test this, we introduce a dataset of 1,400 human-annotated statements
derived from VLM-generated content, each labeled as hallucinated or not, and
use it to test our NTP-based lightweight method. Our results demonstrate that
NTP-based features are valuable predictors of hallucinations, enabling fast and
simple ML models to achieve performance comparable to that of strong VLMs.
Furthermore, augmenting these NTPs with linguistic NTPs, computed by feeding
only the generated text back into the VLM, enhances hallucination detection
performance. Finally, integrating hallucination prediction scores from VLMs
into the NTP-based models led to better performance than using either VLMs or
NTPs alone. We hope this study paves the way for simple, lightweight solutions
that enhance the reliability of VLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线手写签名验证在独立书写者设置中具有挑战性，传统方法依赖真实签名数据集进行训练，需要解决数据稀缺问题并提高模型泛化能力。

Method: 利用SPD矩阵的黎曼几何，通过黎曼高斯混合模型从少量真实样本生成合成书写者和属性，然后进行黎曼高斯采样生成正负样本对，最后使用度量学习框架。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在黎曼空间中生成合成数据用于独立书写者签名验证系统的潜力，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Offline handwritten signature verification remains a challenging task,
particularly in writer-independent settings where models must generalize across
unseen individuals. Recent developments have highlighted the advantage of
geometrically inspired representations, such as covariance descriptors on
Riemannian manifolds. However, past or present, handcrafted or data-driven
methods usually depend on real-world signature datasets for classifier
training. We introduce a quasi-synthetic data generation framework leveraging
the Riemannian geometry of Symmetric Positive Definite matrices (SPD). A small
set of genuine samples in the SPD space is the seed to a Riemannian Gaussian
Mixture which identifies Riemannian centers as synthetic writers and variances
as their properties. Riemannian Gaussian sampling on each center generates
positive as well as negative synthetic SPD populations. A metric learning
framework utilizes pairs of similar and dissimilar SPD points, subsequently
testing it over on real-world datasets. Experiments conducted on two popular
signature datasets, encompassing Western and Asian writing styles, demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach under both intra- and cross- dataset
evaluation protocols. The results indicate that our quasi-synthetic approach
achieves low error rates, highlighting the potential of generating synthetic
data in Riemannian spaces for writer-independent signature verification
systems.

Result: 生成2K图像推理时间最快达1.8秒；在T2I和多模态图像编辑任务上达到最先进水平；在复杂任务中展示出色的多模态能力，包括精确图像编辑和上下文推理；支持多图像参考和生成多个输出图像。

Conclusion: Seedream 4.0将传统T2I系统扩展为更交互和多维的创意工具，推动了生成式AI在创意和专业应用领域的边界。

Abstract: We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image
generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing,
and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly
efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the
number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our
model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g.,
1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning
diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data
collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized
strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong
generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform
multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks
jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation,
distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It
achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image
(without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream
4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image
editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in
complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and
also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images.
This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and
multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both
creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on
https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺癌是全球第二大癌症死因，早期检测对治疗至关重要。深度学习虽有效但受限于标注数据不足，需要开发在小标注数据集上表现优异的方法

Method: 使用对比学习框架，在大量未标注乳腺X光片数据上以半监督方式训练Resnet-50模型，采用多种数据增强技术，最后在小规模标注数据上微调

Result: 在INbreast和MIAS基准数据集上实现了96.7%的乳腺癌检测准确率，超越了现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 对比学习框架能够有效解决乳腺癌检测中标注数据不足的问题，在小标注数据集上表现出色，为早期乳腺癌检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Breast cancer, the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally,
accounts for a quarter of all cancer cases [1]. To lower this death rate, it is
crucial to detect tumors early, as early-stage detection significantly improves
treatment outcomes. Advances in non-invasive imaging techniques have made early
detection possible through computer-aided detection (CAD) systems which rely on
traditional image analysis to identify malignancies. However, there is a
growing shift towards deep learning methods due to their superior
effectiveness. Despite their potential, deep learning methods often struggle
with accuracy due to the limited availability of large-labeled datasets for
training. To address this issue, our study introduces a Contrastive Learning
(CL) framework, which excels with smaller labeled datasets. In this regard, we
train Resnet-50 in semi supervised CL approach using similarity index on a
large amount of unlabeled mammogram data. In this regard, we use various
augmentation and transformations which help improve the performance of our
approach. Finally, we tune our model on a small set of labelled data that
outperforms the existing state of the art. Specifically, we observed a 96.7%
accuracy in detecting breast cancer on benchmark datasets INbreast and MIAS.

Motivation: 利用基础模型在零样本设置下的跨领域泛化能力，替代繁琐的标注任务，实现制造业质量检测的自动化。

Method: 在定制真实工业图像数据和公共图像数据上测试多个最新基础模型，比较它们在工业质量检测任务中的表现。

Result: 所有测试的基础模型在真实工业数据上都失败了，但同样的模型在公共基准数据集上表现良好。

Conclusion: 基础模型在当前阶段还不适用于真实工业环境的质量检测任务，需要进一步改进以适应工业应用场景。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have shown impressive performance on various text and
image processing tasks. They can generalize across domains and datasets in a
zero-shot setting. This could make them suitable for automated quality
inspection during series manufacturing, where various types of images are being
evaluated for many different products. Replacing tedious labeling tasks with a
simple text prompt to describe anomalies and utilizing the same models across
many products would save significant efforts during model setup and
implementation. This is a strong advantage over supervised Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models, which are trained for individual applications and
require labeled training data. We test multiple recent FMs on both custom
real-world industrial image data and public image data. We show that all of
those models fail on our real-world data, while the very same models perform
well on public benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前AI模型在成像和视觉应用中为特定高精度任务定制化导致的效率低下问题，特别是在需要执行一系列模块化任务时，每个任务都需要映射到不同的潜在域。

Method: 采用轻量级CNN骨干网络构建编码器-解码器框架，编码器学习变换感知的通用表示，多个下游模块在共享的神经空间特征上运行。

Result: 该方法成功应用于去马赛克、去噪、深度估计和语义分割等多种成像和视觉任务，证明了在神经空间中高效执行多任务的能力。

Conclusion: 通用神经空间框架为高效多任务视觉流水线奠定了基础，相比大型transformer骨干网络更轻量，具有更好的硬件适应性。

Abstract: The majority of AI models in imaging and vision are customized to perform on
specific high-precision task. However, this strategy is inefficient for
applications with a series of modular tasks, since each requires a mapping into
a disparate latent domain. To address this inefficiency, we proposed a
universal Neural Space (NS), where an encoder-decoder framework pre-computes
features across vision and imaging tasks. Our encoder learns transformation
aware, generalizable representations, which enable multiple downstream AI
modules to share the same feature space. This architecture reduces redundancy,
improves generalization across domain shift, and establishes a foundation for
effecient multi-task vision pipelines. Furthermore, as opposed to larger
transformer backbones, our backbone is lightweight and CNN-based, allowing for
wider across hardware. We furthur demonstrate that imaging and vision modules,
such as demosaicing, denoising, depth estimation and semantic segmentation can
be performed efficiently in the NS.

models are run on a central server to annotate data, which is then used to
train smaller models tailored to the edge devices with limited computational
power. This work explores how to select the most useful images for training to

that, for a similar training load (i.e., iterations), a high-confidence

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于掩码的虚拟试穿方法存在多个问题：生成理想掩码困难、需要专业知识、模型依赖性强，且在复杂场景下无法实现（如将长袖卷起）。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型和图像分割模型自动生成二进制掩码，基于用户提供的图像和自由文本风格指令，无需精确绘制掩码即可实现多轮图像生成。

Result: InstructVTON能够与现有虚拟试穿模型互操作，实现最先进的结果和风格控制。

Conclusion: 该系统简化了用户体验，实现了传统掩码方法无法完成的复杂试穿场景，展示了指令跟随虚拟试穿系统的有效性。

Abstract: We present InstructVTON, an instruction-following interactive virtual try-on
system that allows fine-grained and complex styling control of the resulting
generation, guided by natural language, on single or multiple garments. A
computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates
the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These
inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control
the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is
difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some
cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve
shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt
with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve).
InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation
models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on
user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies
the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask,
and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on
scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models
alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on
models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.

TL;DR: 提出了DeepAFRNet深度学习模型用于识别被篡改的指纹，在SOCOFing数据集上对不同难度级别实现了96.7%-99.54%的准确率，但阈值选择对性能影响很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边境管控、法医和财政准入等应用中，对手可能故意修改指纹脊线模式来逃避检测，因此需要开发能够识别被篡改指纹的鲁棒系统。

Method: 使用VGG16骨干网络提取高维特征，通过余弦相似度比较嵌入向量，在SOCOFing Real-Altered子集的三个难度级别（简单、中等、困难）上进行评估。

Result: 在严格阈值下，DeepAFRNet在三个难度级别分别达到96.7%、98.76%和99.54%的准确率；但当阈值从0.92放宽到0.72时，准确率急剧下降到7.86%、27.05%和29.51%。

Conclusion: DeepAFRNet使用真实篡改样本并报告分级指标，解决了基于合成篡改或有限验证协议的先前工作的局限性，表明其已准备好用于安全和识别弹性都至关重要的实际部署。

Abstract: Altered fingerprint recognition (AFR) is challenging for biometric
verification in applications such as border control, forensics, and fiscal
admission. Adversaries can deliberately modify ridge patterns to evade
detection, so robust recognition of altered prints is essential. We present
DeepAFRNet, a deep learning recognition model that matches and recognizes
distorted fingerprint samples. The approach uses a VGG16 backbone to extract
high-dimensional features and cosine similarity to compare embeddings. We
evaluate on the SOCOFing Real-Altered subset with three difficulty levels
(Easy, Medium, Hard). With strict thresholds, DeepAFRNet achieves accuracies of
96.7 percent, 98.76 percent, and 99.54 percent for the three levels. A
threshold-sensitivity study shows that relaxing the threshold from 0.92 to 0.72
sharply degrades accuracy to 7.86 percent, 27.05 percent, and 29.51 percent,
underscoring the importance of threshold selection in biometric systems. By
using real altered samples and reporting per-level metrics, DeepAFRNet
addresses limitations of prior work based on synthetic alterations or limited
verification protocols, and indicates readiness for real-world deployments
where both security and recognition resilience are critical.

over RGB images. These maps are lifted into a 3D voxel grid, resulting in
voxel-level semantic cues that are incorporated into a behavior cloning policy.
When integrated into a state-of-the-art voxel-based policy, our
attention-guided featurization yields an average absolute improvement of 8.2%
and a relative gain of 21.9% across all tasks in the RLBench bimanual

Result: YOLOv12m达到93.3% mAP@50，RT-DETRv2-X达到93.6% mAP@50；半监督学习后RT-DETRv2-X进一步提升至94.8% mAP@50。中等规模模型在精度和速度间取得良好平衡。

Conclusion: 研究为蓝莓检测提供了全面的模型基准和公开数据集，证明了半监督学习的有效性，但需要进一步研究以更好地利用跨域未标注数据。

Abstract: Blueberry detection in natural environments remains challenging due to
variable lighting, occlusions, and motion blur due to environmental factors and
imaging devices. Deep learning-based object detectors promise to address these
challenges, but they demand a large-scale, diverse dataset that captures the
real-world complexities. Moreover, deploying these models in practical
scenarios often requires the right accuracy/speed/memory trade-off in model
selection. This study presents a novel comparative benchmark analysis of
advanced real-time object detectors, including YOLO (You Only Look Once)
(v8-v12) and RT-DETR (Real-Time Detection Transformers) (v1-v2) families,
consisting of 36 model variants, evaluated on a newly curated dataset for
blueberry detection. This dataset comprises 661 canopy images collected with
smartphones during the 2022-2023 seasons, consisting of 85,879 labelled
instances (including 36,256 ripe and 49,623 unripe blueberries) across a wide
range of lighting conditions, occlusions, and fruit maturity stages. Among the
YOLO models, YOLOv12m achieved the best accuracy with a mAP@50 of 93.3%, while
RT-DETRv2-X obtained a mAP@50 of 93.6%, the highest among all the RT-DETR
variants. The inference time varied with the model scale and complexity, and
the mid-sized models appeared to offer a good accuracy-speed balance. To
further enhance detection performance, all the models were fine-tuned using
Unbiased Mean Teacher-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) on a separate set of
1,035 unlabeled images acquired by a ground-based machine vision platform in
2024. This resulted in accuracy gains ranging from -1.4% to 2.9%, with
RT-DETR-v2-X achieving the best mAP@50 of 94.8%. More in-depth research into
SSL is needed to better leverage cross-domain unlabeled data. Both the dataset
and software programs of this study are made publicly available to support
further research.

Method: 引入基于预计算边界框库的ROI增强策略，训练时概率性用随机ROI裁剪替换完整图像，可选抖动增加多样性

Result: 在Mini-DDSM数据集上，ROI增强（最佳参数p_roi=0.10, alpha=0.10）带来ROC-AUC的适度提升，PR-AUC持平或略降

Conclusion: 简单的数据中心化ROI策略可在受限环境下增强乳腺X光片分类，无需额外标签或架构修改

Abstract: Breast cancer screening with mammography remains central to early detection
and mortality reduction. Deep learning has shown strong potential for
automating mammogram interpretation, yet limited-resolution datasets and small
sample sizes continue to restrict performance. We revisit the Mini-DDSM dataset
(9,684 images; 2,414 patients) and introduce a lightweight region-of-interest
(ROI) augmentation strategy. During training, full images are probabilistically
replaced with random ROI crops sampled from a precomputed, label-free
bounding-box bank, with optional jitter to increase variability. We evaluate
under strict patient-level cross-validation and report ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, and
training-time efficiency metrics (throughput and GPU memory). Because ROI
augmentation is training-only, inference-time cost remains unchanged. On
Mini-DDSM, ROI augmentation (best: p_roi = 0.10, alpha = 0.10) yields modest
average ROC-AUC gains, with performance varying across folds; PR-AUC is flat to
slightly lower. These results demonstrate that simple, data-centric ROI
strategies can enhance mammography classification in constrained settings
without requiring additional labels or architectural modifications.

Result: 在真实世界和合成数据上的广泛实验证明了方法的有效性，提供包含16个场景的合成数据集

Conclusion: 该方法能实现单图像多视角立体视觉，简化成像过程，支持动态场景的逐帧几何恢复

Abstract: Mirror reflections are common in everyday environments and can provide stereo
information within a single capture, as the real and reflected virtual views
are visible simultaneously. We exploit this property by treating the reflection
as an auxiliary view and designing a transformation that constructs a
physically valid virtual camera, allowing direct pixel-domain generation of the
virtual view while adhering to the real-world imaging process. This enables a
multi-view stereo setup from a single image, simplifying the imaging process,
making it compatible with powerful feed-forward reconstruction models for
generalizable and robust 3D reconstruction. To further exploit the geometric
symmetry introduced by mirrors, we propose a symmetric-aware loss to refine
pose estimation. Our framework also naturally extends to dynamic scenes, where
each frame contains a mirror reflection, enabling efficient per-frame geometry
recovery. For quantitative evaluation, we provide a fully customizable
synthetic dataset of 16 Blender scenes, each with ground-truth point clouds and
camera poses. Extensive experiments on real-world data and synthetic data are
conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 灾后建筑占用评估对分类、检查、公用事业恢复和资源分配至关重要。高空影像覆盖快但缺乏立面细节，街景影像有细节但稀疏且难以与地块对齐。

Method: 使用语言引导框架链接全景视频到地块，校正立面视图，提取可解释属性（如入口堵塞、临时覆盖物、局部碎片），采用两种决策策略：透明单阶段规则和分离感知与保守推理的两阶段设计。

Result: 在两次飓风Helene后调查中，两阶段方法达到精度0.927、召回率0.781、F-1分数0.848；单阶段基线为精度0.943、召回率0.728、F-1分数0.822。

Conclusion: 该管道提供可审计、可扩展的占用评估，适合集成到地理空间和应急管理工作流程中，中间属性和空间诊断能揭示残余错误发生的位置和原因。

Abstract: Building-level occupancy after disasters is vital for triage, inspections,
utility re-energization, and equitable resource allocation. Overhead imagery
provides rapid coverage but often misses facade and access cues that determine
habitability, while street-view imagery captures those details but is sparse
and difficult to align with parcels. We present FacadeTrack, a street-level,
language-guided framework that links panoramic video to parcels, rectifies
views to facades, and elicits interpretable attributes (for example, entry
blockage, temporary coverings, localized debris) that drive two decision
strategies: a transparent one-stage rule and a two-stage design that separates
perception from conservative reasoning. Evaluated across two post-Hurricane
Helene surveys, the two-stage approach achieves a precision of 0.927, a recall
of 0.781, and an F-1 score of 0.848, compared with the one-stage baseline at a
precision of 0.943, a recall of 0.728, and an F-1 score of 0.822. Beyond
accuracy, intermediate attributes and spatial diagnostics reveal where and why
residual errors occur, enabling targeted quality control. The pipeline provides
auditable, scalable occupancy assessments suitable for integration into
geospatial and emergency-management workflows.

Motivation: 探索人类在识别移动形状显示的社交互动时，除了视觉特征外还使用哪些语义表征来补充理解。

Method: 研究1：让参与者直接标记动画印象；研究2：通过人类相似性判断测量27种社交互动的表征几何，并与基于视觉特征、标签和动画描述语义嵌入的模型预测进行比较。

Result: 语义模型为解释人类判断提供了视觉特征之外的补充信息，其中基于动词的语义嵌入最能解释人类相似性判断。

Conclusion: 简单显示中的社交感知反映了社交互动的语义结构，在视觉和抽象表征之间架起了桥梁。

Abstract: Humans are social creatures who readily recognize various social interactions
from simple display of moving shapes. While previous research has often focused
on visual features, we examine what semantic representations that humans employ
to complement visual features. In Study 1, we directly asked human participants
to label the animations based on their impression of moving shapes. We found
that human responses were distributed. In Study 2, we measured the
representational geometry of 27 social interactions through human similarity
judgments and compared it with model predictions based on visual features,
labels, and semantic embeddings from animation descriptions. We found that
semantic models provided complementary information to visual features in
explaining human judgments. Among the semantic models, verb-based embeddings
extracted from descriptions account for human similarity judgments the best.
These results suggest that social perception in simple displays reflects the
semantic structure of social interactions, bridging visual and abstract
representations.

Motivation: 解决跨视角地理定位中两个关键挑战：无人机不同方向和视野导致的严重外观变化阻碍跨域泛化，以及需要建立同时捕获全局语义和局部细节的可靠对应关系。

Method: 使用E(2)-Steerable CNN编码器提取旋转和视角变化下的稳定特征，构建带虚拟超级节点的图结构连接所有局部节点，实现全局语义聚合和局部区域重分布，强制全局-局部一致性。

Conclusion: EGS框架通过结合E(2)-Steerable特征提取和全局-局部一致的图结构，有效提升了跨视角地理定位的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) aims to match images of the same location
captured from drastically different viewpoints. Despite recent progress,
existing methods still face two key challenges: (1) achieving robustness under
severe appearance variations induced by diverse UAV orientations and fields of
view, which hinders cross-domain generalization, and (2) establishing reliable
correspondences that capture both global scene-level semantics and fine-grained
local details. In this paper, we propose EGS, a novel CVGL framework designed
to enhance cross-domain generalization. Specifically, we introduce an
E(2)-Steerable CNN encoder to extract stable and reliable features under
rotation and viewpoint shifts. Furthermore, we construct a graph with a virtual
super-node that connects to all local nodes, enabling global semantics to be
aggregated and redistributed to local regions, thereby enforcing global-local
consistency. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200
benchmarks demonstrate that EGS consistently achieves substantial performance
gains and establishes a new state of the art in cross-domain CVGL.

Abstract: Infrared small target detection is crucial for remote sensing applications
like disaster warning and maritime surveillance. However, due to the lack of
distinctive texture and morphological features, infrared small targets are
highly susceptible to blending into cluttered and noisy backgrounds. A
fundamental challenge in designing deep models for this task lies in the
inherent conflict between capturing high-resolution spatial details for minute
targets and extracting robust semantic context for larger targets, often
leading to feature misalignment and suboptimal performance. Existing methods
often rely on fixed gradient operators or simplistic attention mechanisms,
which are inadequate for accurately extracting target edges under low contrast
and high noise. In this paper, we propose a novel Dual-Path Edge Network that
explicitly addresses this challenge by decoupling edge enhancement and semantic
modeling into two complementary processing paths. The first path employs a
Bidirectional Interaction Module, which uses both Local Self-Attention and
Global Self-Attention to capture multi-scale local and global feature
dependencies. The global attention mechanism, based on a Transformer
architecture, integrates long-range semantic relationships and contextual
information, ensuring robust scene understanding. The second path introduces
the Multi-Edge Refiner, which enhances fine-grained edge details using cascaded
Taylor finite difference operators at multiple scales. This mathematical
approach, along with an attention-driven gating mechanism, enables precise edge
localization and feature enhancement for targets of varying sizes, while
effectively suppressing noise. Our method provides a promising solution for
precise infrared small target detection and localization, combining structural
semantics and edge refinement in a unified framework.

Abstract: Intention recognition has traditionally focused on individual intentions,
overlooking the complexities of collective intentions in group settings. To
address this limitation, we introduce the concept of group intention, which
represents shared goals emerging through the actions of multiple individuals,
and Group Intention Forecasting (GIF), a novel task that forecasts when group
intentions will occur by analyzing individual actions and interactions before
the collective goal becomes apparent. To investigate GIF in a specific
scenario, we propose SHOT, the first large-scale dataset for GIF, consisting of
1,979 basketball video clips captured from 5 camera views and annotated with 6
types of individual attributes. SHOT is designed with 3 key characteristics:
multi-individual information, multi-view adaptability, and multi-level
intention, making it well-suited for studying emerging group intentions.
Furthermore, we introduce GIFT (Group Intention ForecasTer), a framework that
extracts fine-grained individual features and models evolving group dynamics to
forecast intention emergence. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of
SHOT and GIFT, establishing a strong foundation for future research in group
intention forecasting. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Maritime object detection is essential for navigation safety, surveillance,
and autonomous operations, yet constrained by two key challenges: the scarcity
of annotated maritime data and poor generalization across various maritime
attributes (e.g., object category, viewpoint, location, and imaging
environment). % In particular, models trained on existing datasets often
underperform in underrepresented scenarios such as open-sea environments. To
address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric
generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by
leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the
generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned
generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key
component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures
boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve
visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose
Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic
samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we
construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for
generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in
maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy,
particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code

Motivation: 现有陨石坑导航主要针对短期着陆任务，而长期月球测绘任务面临稀疏、倾斜图像和变化光照条件的挑战

Method: 结合Mask R-CNN陨石坑检测器、无描述符陨石坑识别模块、鲁棒透视n点姿态求解器和批量轨道确定后端

Result: 在CRESENT-365数据集上平均达到米级位置精度和亚度姿态精度，适应不同视角、光照条件和月球纬度

Conclusion: 这是首次在真实月球测绘环境下全面评估陨石坑导航，为未来任务提供了操作条件参考

Abstract: Crater-Based Navigation (CBN) uses the ubiquitous impact craters of the Moon
observed on images as natural landmarks to determine the six degrees of freedom
pose of a spacecraft. To date, CBN has primarily been studied in the context of
powered descent and landing. These missions are typically short in duration,
with high-frequency imagery captured from a nadir viewpoint over well-lit
terrain. In contrast, lunar mapping missions involve sparse, oblique imagery
acquired under varying illumination conditions over potentially year-long
campaigns, posing significantly greater challenges for pose estimation. We
bridge this gap with STELLA - the first end-to-end CBN pipeline for
long-duration lunar mapping. STELLA combines a Mask R-CNN-based crater
detector, a descriptor-less crater identification module, a robust
perspective-n-crater pose solver, and a batch orbit determination back-end. To
rigorously test STELLA, we introduce CRESENT-365 - the first public dataset
that emulates a year-long lunar mapping mission. Each of its 15,283 images is
rendered from high-resolution digital elevation models with SPICE-derived Sun
angles and Moon motion, delivering realistic global coverage, illumination
cycles, and viewing geometries. Experiments on CRESENT+ and CRESENT-365 show
that STELLA maintains metre-level position accuracy and sub-degree attitude
accuracy on average across wide ranges of viewing angles, illumination
conditions, and lunar latitudes. These results constitute the first
comprehensive assessment of CBN in a true lunar mapping setting and inform
operational conditions that should be considered for future missions.

Conclusion: 单模态网络收敛于共享语义代码，该代码与人类判断一致，并通过样本聚合得到加强。

Abstract: Recent studies show that deep vision-only and language-only models--trained
on disjoint modalities--nonetheless project their inputs into a partially
aligned representational space. Yet we still lack a clear picture of where in
each network this convergence emerges, what visual or linguistic cues support
it, whether it captures human preferences in many-to-many image-text scenarios,
and how aggregating exemplars of the same concept affects alignment. Here, we
systematically investigate these questions. We find that alignment peaks in
mid-to-late layers of both model types, reflecting a shift from
modality-specific to conceptually shared representations. This alignment is
robust to appearance-only changes but collapses when semantics are altered
(e.g., object removal or word-order scrambling), highlighting that the shared
code is truly semantic. Moving beyond the one-to-one image-caption paradigm, a
forced-choice "Pick-a-Pic" task shows that human preferences for image-caption
matches are mirrored in the embedding spaces across all vision-language model
pairs. This pattern holds bidirectionally when multiple captions correspond to
a single image, demonstrating that models capture fine-grained semantic
distinctions akin to human judgments. Surprisingly, averaging embeddings across
exemplars amplifies alignment rather than blurring detail. Together, our
results demonstrate that unimodal networks converge on a shared semantic code
that aligns with human judgments and strengthens with exemplar aggregation.

Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在个性化物体插入任务中存在几何控制不足和风格一致性差的局限，需要一种无需大量训练就能实现精确几何控制和风格统一的解决方案。

Method: 首先将2D物体转换为3D，在3D空间进行交互式编辑，然后从指定视角重新渲染为2D图像，结合扩散适配器实现风格和内容控制。

Conclusion: FreeInsert通过利用3D几何信息和扩散适配器，成功解决了图像编辑中的几何控制和风格一致性问题，为个性化物体插入提供了有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image
generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing
image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with
personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of
geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D
space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to
maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the
challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style
consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack
of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without
extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose
\textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object
insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information.
Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert
the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then
re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces
geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as
geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through
diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled,
style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.

Abstract: Recently remarkable progress has been made in synthesizing realistic human
photos using text-to-image diffusion models. However, current approaches face
degraded scenes, insufficient control, and suboptimal perceptual identity. We
introduce CustomEnhancer, a novel framework to augment existing identity
customization models. CustomEnhancer is a zero-shot enhancement pipeline that
leverages face swapping techniques, pretrained diffusion model, to obtain
additional representations in a zeroshot manner for encoding into personalized
models. Through our proposed triple-flow fused PerGeneration approach, which
identifies and combines two compatible counter-directional latent spaces to
manipulate a pivotal space of personalized model, we unify the generation and
reconstruction processes, realizing generation from three flows. Our pipeline
also enables comprehensive training-free control over the generation process of
personalized models, offering precise controlled personalization for them and
eliminating the need for controller retraining for per-model. Besides, to
address the high time complexity of null-text inversion (NTI), we introduce
ResInversion, a novel inversion method that performs noise rectification via a
pre-diffusion mechanism, reducing the inversion time by 129 times. Experiments
demonstrate that CustomEnhancer reach SOTA results at scene diversity, identity
fidelity, training-free controls, while also showing the efficiency of our
ResInversion over NTI. The code will be made publicly available upon paper
acceptance.

Conclusion: DAC框架有效解决了CD-SSDG中伪标签不准确的问题，在医学图像分割中展现出优异的跨领域泛化性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation
offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing,
addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However,
conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for
each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in
practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the
training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical
and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization
(CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training
data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG
methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of
inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel
dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG.
Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross
pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level
supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This
feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision
caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing
complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two
distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to
enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model
collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation
datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust
generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展DEIM框架以利用DINOv3特征的强大性能，同时满足不同部署场景（GPU、边缘、移动）的资源约束需求。

Method: 对于X/L/M/S变体：采用DINOv3预训练或蒸馏骨干网络，引入空间调谐适配器(STA)将单尺度输出转换为多尺度特征；对于超轻量模型：使用HGNetv2进行深度和宽度剪枝，配合简化解码器和升级的Dense O2O。

Conclusion: DEIMv2通过统一设计实现了跨多样化场景的卓越性能-成本权衡，在实时目标检测领域建立了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM
has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly
outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features,
resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering
GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt
DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter
(STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale
features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance
detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we
employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets.
Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified
design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across
diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our
largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters,
surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for
just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model
(9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even
the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers
38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer
parameters.

Conclusion: DAC-LoRA提供了一种有效、轻量且广泛适用的方法，能够显著增强模型鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are foundational to critical applications like
autonomous driving, medical diagnosis, and content moderation. While
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA enable their efficient
adaptation to specialized tasks, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial
attacks that can compromise safety-critical decisions. CLIP, the backbone for
numerous downstream VLMs, is a high-value target whose vulnerabilities can
cascade across the multimodal AI ecosystem. We propose Dynamic Adversarial
Curriculum DAC-LoRA, a novel framework that integrates adversarial training
into PEFT. The core principle of our method i.e. an intelligent curriculum of
progressively challenging attack, is general and can potentially be applied to
any iterative attack method. Guided by the First-Order Stationary Condition
(FOSC) and a TRADES-inspired loss, DAC-LoRA achieves substantial improvements
in adversarial robustness without significantly compromising clean accuracy.
Our work presents an effective, lightweight, and broadly applicable method to
demonstrate that the DAC-LoRA framework can be easily integrated into a
standard PEFT pipeline to significantly enhance robustness.

Abstract: Prompt learning has become an efficient paradigm for adapting CLIP to
downstream tasks. Compared with traditional fine-tuning, prompt learning
optimizes a few parameters yet yields highly competitive results, especially
appealing in federated learning for computational efficiency. engendering
domain shift among clients and posing a formidable challenge for
downstream-task adaptation. Existing federated domain generalization (FDG)
methods based on prompt learning typically learn soft prompts from training
samples, replacing manually designed prompts to enhance the generalization
ability of federated models. However, these learned prompts exhibit limited
diversity and tend to ignore information from unknown domains. We propose a
novel and effective method from a generative perspective for handling FDG
tasks, namely federated domain generalization with domain-specific soft prompts
generation (FedDSPG). Specifically, during training, we introduce
domain-specific soft prompts (DSPs) for each domain and integrate content and
domain knowledge into the generative model among clients. In the inference
phase, the generator is utilized to obtain DSPs for unseen target domains, thus
guiding downstream tasks in unknown domains. Comprehensive evaluations across
several public datasets confirm that our method outperforms existing strong
baselines in FDG, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Result: 在三种提示引导采样策略和三个先进VideoLLM上的综合评估显示，攻击成功率达到82%-99%。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了提示引导采样策略的安全漏洞，强调了为VideoLLM开发更先进采样策略的重要性。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
understanding videos, supporting tasks such as summarization, captioning, and
question answering. Their performance has been driven by advances in frame
sampling, progressing from uniform-based to semantic-similarity-based and, most
recently, prompt-guided strategies. While vulnerabilities have been identified
in earlier sampling strategies, the safety of prompt-guided sampling remains
unexplored. We close this gap by presenting PoisonVID, the first black-box
poisoning attack that undermines prompt-guided sampling in VideoLLMs. PoisonVID
compromises the underlying prompt-guided sampling mechanism through a
closed-loop optimization strategy that iteratively optimizes a universal
perturbation to suppress harmful frame relevance scores, guided by a depiction
set constructed from paraphrased harmful descriptions leveraging a shadow
VideoLLM and a lightweight language model, i.e., GPT-4o-mini. Comprehensively
evaluated on three prompt-guided sampling strategies and across three advanced
VideoLLMs, PoisonVID achieves 82% - 99% attack success rate, highlighting the
importance of developing future advanced sampling strategies for VideoLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出GoR方法，通过可学习的正则化动态平衡任务特定损失和蒸馏损失，解决量化感知训练中梯度冲突问题，提升小量化模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAT-KD方法在低比特量化下难以平衡任务特定损失和蒸馏损失，存在梯度幅度异质性问题

Method: Game of Regularizer (GoR)方法，仅使用两个可训练参数进行动态损失加权，减少监督信号冲突；还提出QAT-EKD-GoR集成蒸馏框架

Result: 在图像分类、目标检测和LLM压缩任务中，GoR均优于现有QAT-KD方法；在边缘设备上实现更快推理同时保持全精度准确率

Conclusion: GoR为实际部署提供了稳健解决方案，在最优条件下EKD-GoR甚至可以超越全精度模型

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD)
is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for
deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods
often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to
heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We
propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that
adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters
for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals,
improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models
(SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large
language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster
inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce
QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple
heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR
can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for
real-world deployment.

Abstract: The 2017-th edition of the LifeCLEF plant identification challenge is an
important milestone towards automated plant identification systems working at
the scale of continental floras with 10.000 plant species living mainly in
Europe and North America illustrated by a total of 1.1M images. Nowadays, such
ambitious systems are enabled thanks to the conjunction of the dazzling recent
progress in image classification with deep learning and several outstanding
international initiatives, such as the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL), aggregating
the visual knowledge on plant species coming from the main national botany
institutes. However, despite all these efforts the majority of the plant
species still remain without pictures or are poorly illustrated. Outside the
institutional channels, a much larger number of plant pictures are available
and spread on the web through botanist blogs, plant lovers web-pages, image
hosting websites and on-line plant retailers. The LifeCLEF 2017 plant challenge
presented in this paper aimed at evaluating to what extent a large noisy
training dataset collected through the web and containing a lot of labelling
errors can compete with a smaller but trusted training dataset checked by
experts. To fairly compare both training strategies, the test dataset was
created from a third data source, i.e. the Pl@ntNet mobile application that
collects millions of plant image queries all over the world. This paper
presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge,
summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating research
groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: TasselNetV4是一个用于跨物种植物计数的视觉基础模型，通过结合局部计数思想和提取-匹配范式，在多种植物物种上实现高效准确的计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统植物计数方法需要为每种植物建立特定模型，但植物种类繁多且不断培育新品种，难以穷尽所有物种。需要从特定物种计数转向跨物种计数。

Method: 继承TasselNet的局部计数思想，结合类无关计数的提取-匹配范式，基于视觉Transformer构建，引入多分支框感知局部计数器以增强跨尺度鲁棒性。

Result: 在PAC-105和PAC-Somalia数据集上的实验表明，TasselNetV4相比最先进的类无关计数模型具有更优的计数性能和更高的效率。

Conclusion: TasselNetV4成为跨场景、跨尺度和跨物种植物计数的视觉基础模型，解决了植物多样性带来的计数挑战。

Abstract: Accurate plant counting provides valuable information for agriculture such as
crop yield prediction, plant density assessment, and phenotype quantification.
Vision-based approaches are currently the mainstream solution. Prior art
typically uses a detection or a regression model to count a specific plant.
However, plants have biodiversity, and new cultivars are increasingly bred each
year. It is almost impossible to exhaust and build all species-dependent
counting models. Inspired by class-agnostic counting (CAC) in computer vision,
we argue that it is time to rethink the problem formulation of plant counting,
from what plants to count to how to count plants. In contrast to most daily
objects with spatial and temporal invariance, plants are dynamic, changing with
time and space. Their non-rigid structure often leads to worse performance than
counting rigid instances like heads and cars such that current CAC and
open-world detection models are suboptimal to count plants. In this work, we
inherit the vein of the TasselNet plant counting model and introduce a new
extension, TasselNetV4, shifting from species-specific counting to
cross-species counting. TasselNetV4 marries the local counting idea of
TasselNet with the extract-and-match paradigm in CAC. It builds upon a plain
vision transformer and incorporates novel multi-branch box-aware local counters
used to enhance cross-scale robustness. Two challenging datasets, PAC-105 and
PAC-Somalia, are harvested. Extensive experiments against state-of-the-art CAC
models show that TasselNetV4 achieves not only superior counting performance
but also high efficiency.Our results indicate that TasselNetV4 emerges to be a
vision foundation model for cross-scene, cross-scale, and cross-species plant
counting.

Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法在视网膜分割中常产生解剖学上不合理的结果，无法有效建模层与病变的相互作用，且缺乏拓扑正确性保证。

Method: 引入完全可微分的生物标志物拓扑引擎，强制解剖学正确分割；采用解耦表示学习分离空间和风格因素；利用未标记和部分标记数据集进行联合学习。

Result: 在公开和内部OCT数据集上评估，在病变和层分割方面均优于当前最先进方法，能够使用部分标注数据将层分割泛化到病理情况。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在半监督学习中使用解剖学约束进行准确、鲁棒且可信赖的视网膜生物标志物分割的潜力。

Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is widely used for diagnosing and
monitoring retinal diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
The segmentation of biomarkers such as layers and lesions is essential for
patient diagnosis and follow-up. Recently, semi-supervised learning has shown
promise in improving retinal segmentation performance. However, existing
methods often produce anatomically implausible segmentations, fail to
effectively model layer-lesion interactions, and lack guarantees on topological
correctness.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel semi-supervised model that
introduces a fully differentiable biomarker topology engine to enforce
anatomically correct segmentation of lesions and layers. This enables joint
learning with bidirectional influence between layers and lesions, leveraging
unlabeled and diverse partially labeled datasets. Our model learns a
disentangled representation, separating spatial and style factors. This
approach enables more realistic layer segmentations and improves lesion
segmentation, while strictly enforcing lesion location in their anatomically
plausible positions relative to the segmented layers.
  We evaluate the proposed model on public and internal datasets of OCT scans
and show that it outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both lesion and
layer segmentation, while demonstrating the ability to generalize layer
segmentation to pathological cases using partially annotated training data. Our
results demonstrate the potential of using anatomical constraints in
semi-supervised learning for accurate, robust, and trustworthy retinal
biomarker segmentation.

Conclusion: LifeCLEF 2016为大规模植物识别提供了重要的基准测试，特别强调了开放集识别在真实世界生物多样性监测中的重要性。

Abstract: The LifeCLEF plant identification challenge aims at evaluating plant
identification methods and systems at a very large scale, close to the
conditions of a real-world biodiversity monitoring scenario. The 2016-th
edition was actually conducted on a set of more than 110K images illustrating
1000 plant species living in West Europe, built through a large-scale
participatory sensing platform initiated in 2011 and which now involves tens of
thousands of contributors. The main novelty over the previous years is that the
identification task was evaluated as an open-set recognition problem, i.e. a
problem in which the recognition system has to be robust to unknown and never
seen categories. Beyond the brute-force classification across the known classes
of the training set, the big challenge was thus to automatically reject the
false positive classification hits that are caused by the unknown classes. This
overview presents more precisely the resources and assessments of the
challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems employed by the participating
research groups, and provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

TL;DR: SCRA-VQA是一种基于大型语言模型的视觉问答方法，通过总结和重排图像描述来去除无关信息，提升模型推理能力，无需昂贵的端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用图像描述辅助LLMs理解图像，但这些描述包含过多与问题无关的噪声，且LLMs通常不理解VQA任务，限制了推理能力。

Method: 使用预训练视觉语言模型生成图像描述，同时生成上下文示例，对描述进行总结和重排以排除无关信息，使LLMs更好地理解图像信息和问题。

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上分别达到38.8%和34.6%的准确率，基于6.7B参数的LLM表现出色。

Conclusion: SCRA-VQA通过描述总结和重排有效提升了LLMs在知识型VQA任务中的推理能力和任务适应性。

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality knowledge is a central focus in Knowledge-Based Visual
Question Answering (KB-VQA). Recent methods use large language models (LLMs) as
knowledge engines for answering. These methods generally employ image captions
as visual text descriptions to assist LLMs in interpreting images. However, the
captions frequently include excessive noise irrelevant to the question, and
LLMs generally do not comprehend VQA tasks, limiting their reasoning
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose the Summarized Caption-Rerank
Augmented VQA (SCRA-VQA), which employs a pre-trained visual language model to
convert images into captions. Moreover, SCRA-VQA generates contextual examples
for the captions while simultaneously summarizing and reordering them to
exclude unrelated information. The caption-rerank process enables LLMs to
understand the image information and questions better, thus enhancing the
model's reasoning ability and task adaptability without expensive end-to-end
training. Based on an LLM with 6.7B parameters, SCRA-VQA performs excellently
on two challenging knowledge-based VQA datasets: OK-VQA and A-OKVQA, achieving
accuracies of 38.8% and 34.6%. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文揭示了感知优化与评估之间的不对称性：在图像质量评估中表现优异的保真度指标不一定适用于感知优化，判别器设计对优化效果起决定性作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索感知优化中保真度目标和对抗目标作为优化目标的有效性与作为图像质量评估指标能力之间的相关性，这一领域尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 系统分析不同保真度指标在感知优化中的表现，研究判别器设计对优化效果的影响，包括补丁级、卷积架构与Transformer架构的对比。

Result: 发现保真度指标在图像质量评估和感知优化之间存在明显不对齐，判别器能有效抑制伪影但学习到的表征对图像质量评估模型初始化帮助有限，补丁级和卷积架构在细节重建方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 这些发现推进了对损失函数设计及其与图像质量评估可迁移性联系的理解，为更原则性的感知优化方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Perceptual optimization is primarily driven by the fidelity objective, which
enforces both semantic consistency and overall visual realism, while the
adversarial objective provides complementary refinement by enhancing perceptual
sharpness and fine-grained detail. Despite their central role, the correlation
between their effectiveness as optimization objectives and their capability as
image quality assessment (IQA) metrics remains underexplored. In this work, we
conduct a systematic analysis and reveal an unanticipated asymmetry between
perceptual optimization and assessment: fidelity metrics that excel in IQA are
not necessarily effective for perceptual optimization, with this misalignment
emerging more distinctly under adversarial training. In addition, while
discriminators effectively suppress artifacts during optimization, their
learned representations offer only limited benefits when reused as backbone
initializations for IQA models. Beyond this asymmetry, our findings further
demonstrate that discriminator design plays a decisive role in shaping
optimization, with patch-level and convolutional architectures providing more
faithful detail reconstruction than vanilla or Transformer-based alternatives.
These insights advance the understanding of loss function design and its
connection to IQA transferability, paving the way for more principled
approaches to perceptual optimization.

Result: 在VQA-CP v1和v2数据集上表现优异，特别在处理有偏和不平衡数据分布方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 同时处理对象交互和数据集偏见对于推进VQA任务至关重要

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) presents a unique challenge by requiring
models to understand and reason about visual content to answer questions
accurately. Existing VQA models often struggle with biases introduced by the
training data, leading to over-reliance on superficial patterns and inadequate
generalization to diverse questions and images. This paper presents a novel
model, IOG-VQA, which integrates Object Interaction Self-Attention and
GAN-Based Debiasing to enhance VQA model performance. The self-attention
mechanism allows our model to capture complex interactions between objects
within an image, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the visual
context. Meanwhile, the GAN-based debiasing framework generates unbiased data
distributions, helping the model to learn more robust and generalizable
features. By leveraging these two components, IOG-VQA effectively combines
visual and textual information to address the inherent biases in VQA datasets.
Extensive experiments on the VQA-CP v1 and VQA-CP v2 datasets demonstrate that
our model shows excellent performance compared with the existing methods,
particularly in handling biased and imbalanced data distributions highlighting
the importance of addressing both object interactions and dataset biases in
advancing VQA tasks. Our code is available at

Result: 在心脏超声去雾任务中，相比传统RPCA在对比度增强和信号保持方面表现更好

Conclusion: 结合基于模型的时间模型与深度生成先验在高质量视频恢复方面具有潜力

Abstract: Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based
temporal models with deep generative priors for high-fidelity video
restoration.

Motivation: 随着VAEs、GANs和LDMs等先进模型生成的合成图像越来越逼真，合成图像检测面临重大挑战。

Method: 探索生成过程中引入的两种伪影类型：潜在分布偏差和解码诱导平滑效应，利用基于马尔可夫随机场的局部像素依赖特性重建合成图像以暴露纹理连续性和边缘一致性的破坏，并基于此提出仅含110万个参数的轻量神经网络FerretNet。

Conclusion: FerretNet能够高效且鲁棒地检测合成图像，显著超越现有最先进方法。

Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic images generated by advanced models such
as VAEs, GANs, and LDMs poses significant challenges for synthetic image
detection. To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced
during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2)
decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local
textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies
(LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic
images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture
continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a
lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient
and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an
average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22
generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.

Conclusion: MoTIF成功将概念瓶颈框架扩展到视频分类，为理解视频中的动作和事件提供了可解释的分析工具。

Abstract: Conceptual models such as Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have driven
substantial progress in improving interpretability for image classification by
leveraging human-interpretable concepts. However, extending these models from
static images to sequences of images, such as video data, introduces a
significant challenge due to the temporal dependencies inherent in videos,
which are essential for capturing actions and events. In this work, we
introduce MoTIF (Moving Temporal Interpretable Framework), an architectural
design inspired by a transformer that adapts the concept bottleneck framework
for video classification and handles sequences of arbitrary length. Within the
video domain, concepts refer to semantic entities such as objects, attributes,
or higher-level components (e.g., 'bow', 'mount', 'shoot') that reoccur across
time - forming motifs collectively describing and explaining actions. Our
design explicitly enables three complementary perspectives: global concept
importance across the entire video, local concept relevance within specific
windows, and temporal dependencies of a concept over time. Our results
demonstrate that the concept-based modeling paradigm can be effectively
transferred to video data, enabling a better understanding of concept
contributions in temporal contexts while maintaining competitive performance.

Abstract: 3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is
essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire
monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be
solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the
context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available
computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show
that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple
target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a
drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system
(GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter
can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and
image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle
filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new
tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be
conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image
segmentation model.

Conclusion: SwinMamba是遥感图像语义分割的有效解决方案，通过结合局部和全局特征感知实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in
computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use
classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this
task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene
structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To
address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been
proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the
recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive
field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and
effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning
tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which
are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts.
To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by
the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning
within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's
perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two
stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details,
while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader
contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows
enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature
integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and
ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution
for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于打包的多示例学习框架，通过将可变长度的特征序列打包成固定长度，解决了计算病理学中全切片图像序列长度极长、变化大和监督有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中的全切片图像具有极长的序列长度（可达20万）、显著的序列长度变化（从200到20万）和有限的监督，这些极端变化导致数据高度异质性和冗余。传统方法在有限监督下为了保持这种异质性往往牺牲训练效率和优化。

Method: 提出打包MIL框架，将多个采样的可变长度特征序列打包成固定长度序列，实现批处理训练同时保持数据异质性；引入残差分支将多个切片的丢弃特征组合成超切片进行训练；采用注意力驱动的下采样器压缩特征以减少冗余。

Result: 在PANDA(UNI)数据集上，该方法实现了高达8%的准确率提升，同时仅使用12%的训练时间。

Conclusion: 关注计算病理学中的数据挑战在基础模型时代具有重要潜力，该方法通过解决序列长度变化、数据异质性和监督有限等问题，显著提升了性能并降低了训练成本。

Abstract: Computational pathology (CPath) digitizes pathology slides into whole slide
images (WSIs), enabling analysis for critical healthcare tasks such as cancer
diagnosis and prognosis. However, WSIs possess extremely long sequence lengths
(up to 200K), significant length variations (from 200 to 200K), and limited
supervision. These extreme variations in sequence length lead to high data
heterogeneity and redundancy. Conventional methods often compromise on training
efficiency and optimization to preserve such heterogeneity under limited
supervision. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose a
pack-based MIL framework. It packs multiple sampled, variable-length feature
sequences into fixed-length ones, enabling batched training while preserving
data heterogeneity. Moreover, we introduce a residual branch that composes
discarded features from multiple slides into a hyperslide which is trained with
tailored labels. It offers multi-slide supervision while mitigating feature
loss from sampling. Meanwhile, an attention-driven downsampler is introduced to
compress features in both branches to reduce redundancy. By alleviating these
challenges, our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of up to 8% while
using only 12% of the training time in the PANDA(UNI). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that focusing data challenges in CPath holds significant potential
in the era of foundation models. The code is

TL;DR: SimDiff：一种模拟器约束的扩散模型，通过将环境参数直接整合到去噪过程中，无需推理时的重复模拟器调用即可高效生成物理合理的人体运动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩散过程中加入基于模拟器的运动投影层来确保物理合理性，但由于模拟器的顺序特性导致计算成本高昂且无法并行化。

Method: 将模拟器运动投影解释为扩散过程中的一种引导形式，提出SimDiff模型，通过环境参数（重力、风力等）条件化去噪过程，避免推理时重复调用模拟器。

Result: SimDiff能高效生成物理合理的运动，提供对不同物理系数的细粒度控制，并在未见过的环境参数组合上表现出组合泛化能力。

Conclusion: SimDiff通过将物理约束直接整合到扩散模型中，实现了高效、可控且具有组合泛化能力的物理合理人体运动生成。

Abstract: Generating physically plausible human motion is crucial for applications such
as character animation and virtual reality. Existing approaches often
incorporate a simulator-based motion projection layer to the diffusion process
to enforce physical plausibility. However, such methods are computationally
expensive due to the sequential nature of the simulator, which prevents
parallelization. We show that simulator-based motion projection can be
interpreted as a form of guidance, either classifier-based or classifier-free,
within the diffusion process. Building on this insight, we propose SimDiff, a
Simulator-constrained Diffusion Model that integrates environment parameters
(e.g., gravity, wind) directly into the denoising process. By conditioning on
these parameters, SimDiff generates physically plausible motions efficiently,
without repeated simulator calls at inference, and also provides fine-grained
control over different physical coefficients. Moreover, SimDiff successfully
generalizes to unseen combinations of environmental parameters, demonstrating
compositional generalization.

TL;DR: 本文通过分析1174个预训练视觉模型，发现四个能显著提升模型对高斯噪声鲁棒性的设计模式：更大的stem卷积核、更小的输入分辨率、平均池化以及使用监督ViT而非CLIP ViT。

Motivation: 研究视觉模型架构设计选择对高斯噪声鲁棒性的影响，将经验观察转化为可操作的设计规则。

Method: 对1174个预训练视觉模型进行广泛评估，识别鲁棒性设计模式，并通过理论分析解释这些发现。

Result: 识别出的设计模式可带来高达506位的排名提升和21.6%的准确率增益。理论分析证明了stem卷积核的低通特性、下采样抗混叠、平均池化的无偏性以及CLIP ViT的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究将鲁棒性分解为可解释模块，提供了解释观察趋势的理论，并为设计对高斯噪声更鲁棒的视觉模型提供了实用的即插即用指南。

Abstract: While the robustness of vision models is often measured, their dependence on
specific architectural design choices is rarely dissected. We investigate why
certain vision architectures are inherently more robust to additive Gaussian
noise and convert these empirical insights into simple, actionable design
rules. Specifically, we performed extensive evaluations on 1,174 pretrained
vision models, empirically identifying four consistent design patterns for
improved robustness against Gaussian noise: larger stem kernels, smaller input
resolutions, average pooling, and supervised vision transformers (ViTs) rather
than CLIP ViTs, which yield up to 506 rank improvements and 21.6\%p accuracy
gains. We then develop a theoretical analysis that explains these findings,
converting observed correlations into causal mechanisms. First, we prove that
low-pass stem kernels attenuate noise with a gain that decreases quadratically
with kernel size and that anti-aliased downsampling reduces noise energy
roughly in proportion to the square of the downsampling factor. Second, we
demonstrate that average pooling is unbiased and suppresses noise in proportion
to the pooling window area, whereas max pooling incurs a positive bias that
grows slowly with window size and yields a relatively higher mean-squared error
and greater worst-case sensitivity. Third, we reveal and explain the
vulnerability of CLIP ViTs via a pixel-space Lipschitz bound: The smaller
normalization standard deviations used in CLIP preprocessing amplify worst-case
sensitivity by up to 1.91 times relative to the Inception-style preprocessing
common in supervised ViTs. Our results collectively disentangle robustness into
interpretable modules, provide a theory that explains the observed trends, and
build practical, plug-and-play guidelines for designing vision models more
robust against Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Scene graphs (SGs) provide structured relational representations crucial for
decoding complex, dynamic surgical environments. This PRISMA-ScR-guided scoping
review systematically maps the evolving landscape of SG research in surgery,
charting its applications, methodological advancements, and future directions.
Our analysis reveals rapid growth, yet uncovers a critical 'data divide':
internal-view research (e.g., triplet recognition) almost exclusively uses
real-world 2D video, while external-view 4D modeling relies heavily on
simulated data, exposing a key translational research gap. Methodologically,
the field has advanced from foundational graph neural networks to specialized
foundation models that now significantly outperform generalist large
vision-language models in surgical contexts. This progress has established SGs
as a cornerstone technology for both analysis, such as workflow recognition and
automated safety monitoring, and generative tasks like controllable surgical
simulation. Although challenges in data annotation and real-time implementation
persist, they are actively being addressed through emerging techniques.
Surgical SGs are maturing into an essential semantic bridge, enabling a new
generation of intelligent systems to improve surgical safety, efficiency, and

Abstract: We present an automated vision-based system for defect detection and
classification of laser power meter sensor coatings. Our approach addresses the
critical challenge of identifying coating defects such as thermal damage and
scratches that can compromise laser energy measurement accuracy in medical and
industrial applications. The system employs an unsupervised anomaly detection
framework that trains exclusively on ``good'' sensor images to learn normal
coating distribution patterns, enabling detection of both known and novel
defect types without requiring extensive labeled defect datasets. Our
methodology consists of three key components: (1) a robust preprocessing
pipeline using Laplacian edge detection and K-means clustering to segment the
area of interest, (2) synthetic data augmentation via StyleGAN2, and (3) a
UFlow-based neural network architecture for multi-scale feature extraction and
anomaly map generation. Experimental evaluation on 366 real sensor images
demonstrates $93.8\%$ accuracy on defective samples and $89.3\%$ accuracy on
good samples, with image-level AUROC of 0.957 and pixel-level AUROC of 0.961.
The system provides potential annual cost savings through automated quality
control and processing times of 0.5 seconds per image in on-device
implementation.

Abstract: The dynamic propagation of social media has broadened the reach of financial
advisory content through podcast videos, yet extracting insights from lengthy,
multimodal segments (30-40 minutes) remains challenging. We introduce FASTER
(Financial Advisory Summariser with Textual Embedded Relevant images), a
modular framework that tackles three key challenges: (1) extracting
modality-specific features, (2) producing optimized, concise summaries, and (3)
aligning visual keyframes with associated textual points. FASTER employs BLIP
for semantic visual descriptions, OCR for textual patterns, and Whisper-based
transcription with Speaker diarization as BOS features. A modified Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO)-based loss function, equipped with BOS-specific
fact-checking, ensures precision, relevance, and factual consistency against
the human-aligned summary. A ranker-based retrieval mechanism further aligns
keyframes with summarized content, enhancing interpretability and cross-modal
coherence. To acknowledge data resource scarcity, we introduce Fin-APT, a
dataset comprising 470 publicly accessible financial advisory pep-talk videos
for robust multimodal research. Comprehensive cross-domain experiments confirm
FASTER's strong performance, robustness, and generalizability when compared to
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By establishing
a new standard for multimodal summarization, FASTER makes financial advisory
content more accessible and actionable, thereby opening new avenues for
research. The dataset and code are available at:

Motivation: 现有方法需要预训练、聚类学习或训练好的聚类模型作为前提，限制了SSL学习器在图像聚类任务中的灵活应用

Method: 随机采样伪标签数据，使用实例级分类器学习语义对齐的实例级标签，通过跟踪预测类别转换提取高级相似性，为伪标签数据分配聚类级标签，最后用带聚类级标签的伪数据触发SSL学习器

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于最新的深度图像聚类方法，与使用真实标签的SSL方法相比仅有微小精度差距（如CIFAR-10上仅1.33%）

Conclusion: ASD能够有效实现SSL学习器的冷启动图像聚类，并能进一步提升现有SSL嵌入深度图像聚类方法的性能

Abstract: Recently, some works integrate SSL techniques into deep clustering frameworks
to enhance image clustering performance. However, they all need pretraining,
clustering learning, or a trained clustering model as prerequisites, limiting
the flexible and out-of-box application of SSL learners in the image clustering
task. This work introduces ASD, an adaptor that enables the cold-start of SSL
learners for deep image clustering without any prerequisites. Specifically, we
first randomly sample pseudo-labeled data from all unlabeled data, and set an
instance-level classifier to learn them with semantically aligned
instance-level labels. With the ability of instance-level classification, we
track the class transitions of predictions on unlabeled data to extract
high-level similarities of instance-level classes, which can be utilized to
assign cluster-level labels to pseudo-labeled data. Finally, we use the
pseudo-labeled data with assigned cluster-level labels to trigger a general SSL
learner trained on the unlabeled data for image clustering. We show the
superior performance of ASD across various benchmarks against the latest deep
image clustering approaches and very slight accuracy gaps compared to SSL
methods using ground-truth, e.g., only 1.33% on CIFAR-10. Moreover, ASD can
also further boost the performance of existing SSL-embedded deep image
clustering methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformer在作为视觉基础模型时会产生高范数伪影，这些伪影会降低表示质量。在知识蒸馏过程中，高范数伪影会主导目标函数，导致学生模型过度拟合伪影而忽视信息信号。

Method: 提出SiNGER框架，使用零空间引导的扰动来精炼教师特征，在抑制伪影的同时保留信息信号。通过LoRA适配器实现高效扰动，最小化结构修改。

Result: 在多个下游任务中实现最先进性能，生成更清晰和可解释的表示。

Conclusion: SiNGER框架能够有效解决知识蒸馏中伪影抑制和信息保留的权衡问题，显著提升学生模型性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers are widely adopted as the backbone of vision foundation
models, but they are known to produce high-norm artifacts that degrade
representation quality. When knowledge distillation transfers these features to
students, high-norm artifacts dominate the objective, so students overfit to
artifacts and underweight informative signals, diminishing the gains from
larger models. Prior work attempted to remove artifacts but encountered an
inherent trade-off between artifact suppression and preserving informative
signals from teachers. To address this, we introduce Singular Nullspace-Guided
Energy Reallocation (SiNGER), a novel distillation framework that suppresses
artifacts while preserving informative signals. The key idea is principled
teacher feature refinement: during refinement, we leverage the nullspace-guided
perturbation to preserve information while suppressing artifacts. Then, the
refined teacher's features are distilled to a student. We implement this
perturbation efficiently with a LoRA-based adapter that requires minimal
structural modification. Extensive experiments show that \oursname consistently
improves student models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple
downstream tasks and producing clearer and more interpretable representations.

configurations and rely on ground-based processing. In this work, we propose
Fast-SEnSeI, a lightweight, sensor-independent encoder module that enables
flexible, on-board cloud segmentation across multispectral sensors with varying
band configurations. Building upon SEnSeI-v2, Fast-SEnSeI integrates an
improved spectral descriptor, lightweight architecture, and robust padding-band
handling. It accepts arbitrary combinations of spectral bands and their
wavelengths, producing fixed-size feature maps that feed into a compact,
quantized segmentation model based on a modified U-Net. The module runs
efficiently on embedded CPUs using Apache TVM, while the segmentation model is
deployed on FPGA, forming a CPU-FPGA hybrid pipeline suitable for
space-qualified hardware. Evaluations on Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 datasets
demonstrate accurate segmentation across diverse input configurations.

Abstract: Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation.
However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key
challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target
concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we
propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can
precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single
neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text
embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons
align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons
responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification
method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By
suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves
surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality.
Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves
state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the
model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our
method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly
outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Accurate point cloud segmentation for plant organs is crucial for 3D plant
phenotyping. Existing solutions are designed problem-specific with a focus on
certain plant species or specified sensor-modalities for data acquisition.
Furthermore, it is common to use extensive pre-processing and down-sample the
plant point clouds to meet hardware or neural network input size requirements.
We propose a simple, yet effective algorithm KDSS for sub-sampling of
biological point clouds that is agnostic to sensor data and plant species. The
main benefit of this approach is that we do not need to down-sample our input
data and thus, enable segmentation of the full-resolution point cloud.
Combining KD-SS with current state-of-the-art segmentation models shows
satisfying results evaluated on different modalities such as photogrammetry,
laser triangulation and LiDAR for various plant species. We propose KD-SS as
lightweight resolution-retaining alternative to intensive pre-processing and
down-sampling methods for plant organ segmentation regardless of used species
and sensor modality.

Conclusion: Mambo框架通过结合精炼的局部背景相似度和局部类别相似度，以及灵活的补丁选择策略，显著提高了少样本OOD检测的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Existing foreground-background (FG-BG) decomposition methods for the few-shot
out-of-distribution (FS-OOD) detection often suffer from low robustness due to
over-reliance on the local class similarity and a fixed background patch
extraction strategy. To address these challenges, we propose a new FG-BG
decomposition framework, namely Mambo, for FS-OOD detection. Specifically, we
propose to first learn a background prompt to obtain the local background
similarity containing both the background and image semantic information, and
then refine the local background similarity using the local class similarity.
As a result, we use both the refined local background similarity and the local
class similarity to conduct background extraction, reducing the dependence of
the local class similarity in previous methods. Furthermore, we propose the
patch self-calibrated tuning to consider the sample diversity to flexibly
select numbers of background patches for different samples, and thus exploring
the issue of fixed background extraction strategies in previous methods.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed
Mambo achieves the best performance, compared to SOTA methods in terms of OOD
detection and near OOD detection setting. The source code will be released at
https://github.com/YuzunoKawori/Mambo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像分割中随机数据集划分导致的测试集不具代表性、评估偏差和模型泛化差的问题。

Method: IPS是标签感知采样方法，WDES是使用遗传算法最小化Wasserstein距离来优化标签分布相似性的方法。

Conclusion: WDES在处理小型、不平衡和低多样性数据集时特别有价值，能有效减少传统划分策略的偏差。

Abstract: Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to
unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model
generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing
label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to
segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class
imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification
concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward,
label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we
present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic
algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the
similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is
globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical
heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and
find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES
across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging,
and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model
evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling
small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting
strategies are most prone to bias.

TL;DR: EnGraf-Net利用语义关联层次结构作为监督信号，无需裁剪技术或手动标注，在细粒度分类任务中达到与最先进方法竞争的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度分类模型依赖部件标注或自动注意力提取，但存在局部特征表示不完整的问题。人类识别物体时会形成语义关联，因此可以利用层次化语义关联作为监督信号

Method: 提出EnGraf-Net端到端深度神经网络模型，将语义关联构建为层次结构（分类学）作为监督信号，不依赖裁剪技术或手动标注

Result: 在CIFAR-100、CUB-200-2011和FGVC-Aircraft三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，EnGraf-Net优于许多现有细粒度模型，与最新最先进方法性能相当

Conclusion: 利用语义关联层次作为监督信号是细粒度分类的有效方法，无需复杂的手动标注或裁剪技术即可实现竞争性性能

Abstract: Fine-grained classification models are designed to focus on the relevant
details necessary to distinguish highly similar classes, particularly when
intra-class variance is high and inter-class variance is low. Most existing
models rely on part annotations such as bounding boxes, part locations, or
textual attributes to enhance classification performance, while others employ
sophisticated techniques to automatically extract attention maps. We posit that
part-based approaches, including automatic cropping methods, suffer from an
incomplete representation of local features, which are fundamental for
distinguishing similar objects. While fine-grained classification aims to
recognize the leaves of a hierarchical structure, humans recognize objects by
also forming semantic associations. In this paper, we leverage semantic
associations structured as a hierarchy (taxonomy) as supervised signals within
an end-to-end deep neural network model, termed EnGraf-Net. Extensive
experiments on three well-known datasets CIFAR-100, CUB-200-2011, and
FGVC-Aircraft demonstrate the superiority of EnGraf-Net over many existing
fine-grained models, showing competitive performance with the most recent
state-of-the-art approaches, without requiring cropping techniques or manual
annotations.

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) 对对抗性补丁攻击存在显著脆弱性，不同ViT模型的攻击成功率从40.04%到99.97%不等，证实了对抗性攻击从CNN到ViT的跨架构可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统依赖度增加，其安全性成为关键问题。尽管ViTs在性能和对抗扰动鲁棒性方面优于CNNs，但仍易受对抗性补丁攻击，需要研究其脆弱性。

Method: 使用Creases Transformation (CT)技术设计现实对抗性补丁，在人物分类任务中测试四个微调ViT模型，研究CNN对抗攻击技术向ViT分类模型的迁移性。

Result: 实验显示不同ViT模型攻击成功率差异显著：google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k为40.04%，facebook/dino-vitb16高达99.97%，其他两个模型分别为66.40%和65.17%。

Conclusion: 对抗性补丁可从CNN成功迁移到ViT，预训练数据集规模和方法强烈影响模型对对抗攻击的韧性。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on machine learning systems has made their security a
critical concern. Evasion attacks enable adversaries to manipulate the
decision-making processes of AI systems, potentially causing security breaches
or misclassification of targets. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained
significant traction in modern machine learning due to increased 1) performance
compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and 2) robustness against
adversarial perturbations. However, ViTs remain vulnerable to evasion attacks,
particularly to adversarial patches, unique patterns designed to manipulate AI
classification systems. These vulnerabilities are investigated by designing
realistic adversarial patches to cause misclassification in person vs.
non-person classification tasks using the Creases Transformation (CT)
technique, which adds subtle geometric distortions similar to those occurring
naturally when wearing clothing. This study investigates the transferability of
adversarial attack techniques used in CNNs when applied to ViT classification
models. Experimental evaluation across four fine-tuned ViT models on a binary
person classification task reveals significant vulnerability variations: attack
success rates ranged from 40.04% (google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) to 99.97%
(facebook/dino-vitb16), with google/vit-base-patch16-224 achieving 66.40% and
facebook/dinov3-vitb16 reaching 65.17%. These results confirm the
cross-architectural transferability of adversarial patches from CNNs to ViTs,
with pre-training dataset scale and methodology strongly influencing model
resilience to adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: UniTransfer通过空间和时间步分解实现精确可控的视频概念迁移，采用双流到单流的DiT架构和自监督预训练策略，在OpenAnimal数据集上超越现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频概念迁移方法缺乏对视频不同组件的细粒度控制能力，需要更精确和可控的生成框架。

Method: 提出空间分解（前景主体、背景、运动流）和时间步分解（Chain-of-Prompt机制），采用双流到单流DiT架构和自监督预训练策略。

Result: 在OpenAnimal数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉保真度和可编辑性方面均优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: UniTransfer通过空间和时间步分解实现了高质量、可控的视频概念迁移，为视频编辑领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture UniTransfer, which introduces both spatial
and diffusion timestep decomposition in a progressive paradigm, achieving
precise and controllable video concept transfer. Specifically, in terms of
spatial decomposition, we decouple videos into three key components: the
foreground subject, the background, and the motion flow. Building upon this
decomposed formulation, we further introduce a dual-to-single-stream DiT-based
architecture for supporting fine-grained control over different components in
the videos. We also introduce a self-supervised pretraining strategy based on
random masking to enhance the decomposed representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled video data. Inspired by the Chain-of-Thought reasoning
paradigm, we further revisit the denoising diffusion process and propose a
Chain-of-Prompt (CoP) mechanism to achieve the timestep decomposition. We
decompose the denoising process into three stages of different granularity and
leverage large language models (LLMs) for stage-specific instructions to guide
the generation progressively. We also curate an animal-centric video dataset
called OpenAnimal to facilitate the advancement and benchmarking of research in
video concept transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves high-quality and controllable video concept transfer across diverse
reference images and scenes, surpassing existing baselines in both visual
fidelity and editability. Web Page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要利用LLM推理分析解析的视觉内容，受限于静态感知阶段，需要增强多模态大语言模型的推理能力以实现人类水平的感知和理解

Method: VTTS方法：1) 迭代感知机制，基于更新文本预测逐步聚焦高置信度时空区域；2) 结合强化学习和时空监督优化推理；3) 构建VTTS-80K数据集支持迭代感知

Result: Videochat-R1.5模型在视频对话、视频推理和时空感知等15+基准测试中，相比Qwen2.5VL-3B和-7B等基线模型平均提升超过5%

Conclusion: VTTS通过增加感知计算有效提升了MLLMs的性能，在多样化任务和基准测试中验证了其有效性和泛化能力

Abstract: Inducing reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is critical
for achieving human-level perception and understanding. Existing methods mainly
leverage LLM reasoning to analyze parsed visuals, often limited by static
perception stages. This paper introduces Visual Test-Time Scaling (VTTS), a
novel approach to enhance MLLMs' reasoning via iterative perception during
inference. VTTS mimics humans' hierarchical attention by progressively refining
focus on high-confidence spatio-temporal regions, guided by updated textual
predictions. Specifically, VTTS employs an Iterative Perception (ITP)
mechanism, incorporating reinforcement learning with spatio-temporal
supervision to optimize reasoning. To support this paradigm, we also present
VTTS-80K, a dataset tailored for iterative perception. These designs allows a
MLLM to enhance its performance by increasing its perceptual compute. Extensive
experiments validate VTTS's effectiveness and generalization across diverse
tasks and benchmarks. Our newly introduced Videochat-R1.5 model has achieved
remarkable improvements, with an average increase of over 5\%, compared to
robust baselines such as Qwen2.5VL-3B and -7B, across more than 15 benchmarks
that encompass video conversation, video reasoning, and spatio-temporal
perception.

Motivation: 理解深度学习模型学习的内容对临床AI安全部署至关重要，现有研究多关注像素级解释方法，但文本概念更能反映临床医生的推理过程。

Method: 利用乳腺X光摄影专用视觉语言模型作为"解剖器"，在指定层为神经元标注人类可解释的文本概念，并量化其与领域知识的对齐程度。

Result: 乳腺X光摄影数据训练的模型捕获更多临床相关概念且更接近放射科医生工作流程；微调增强特定概念类别但可能减少其他概念的覆盖范围。

Conclusion: Mammo-CLIP Dissect能洞察CNN如何捕获乳腺X光摄影知识，揭示领域特定训练和任务适应如何塑造概念学习。

Abstract: Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe
deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous
work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been
paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect
the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first
concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision
models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific
vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels
neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and
quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we
investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL
vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific
datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept
specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain
underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more
clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists'
workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for
task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories
(e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g.,
density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and
generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights
into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific
knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we
reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept
learning. Code and concept set are available:

TL;DR: MOSS-ChatV是一个基于强化学习的框架，使用动态时间规整(DTW)的过程奖励来解决多模态大语言模型在视频推理中的过程不一致问题，在MOSS-Video基准上达到87.2%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视频推理中存在过程不一致问题，即使最终答案正确，中间推理过程也会偏离视频动态，这削弱了模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出MOSS-ChatV强化学习框架，采用基于动态时间规整(DTW)的过程奖励，将推理轨迹与时间基础参考对齐，无需辅助奖励模型即可实现高效的过程监督。

Result: 在MOSS-Video测试集上达到87.2%准确率，在MVBench和MMVU等通用视频基准上表现提升，并在Qwen2.5-VL和Phi-2等不同架构上均获得一致增益。

Conclusion: MOSS-ChatV框架能有效提升视频推理的过程一致性和稳定性，具有广泛的适用性，GPT-4o评估显示其能产生更一致稳定的推理轨迹。

Abstract: Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception
toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet
existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate
reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct,
undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we
introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time
Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning
traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process
supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state
prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a
benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to
fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation.
MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on
general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently
yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2,
confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further
show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常分别学习相机和物体运动，这可能导致对相机与物体间相对运动的混淆，难以在相机轨迹引导下生成一致且可泛化的视频。

Method: 将相机和物体运动统一转换为像素运动，使用稳定扩散网络学习参考运动图，结合语义物体先验，通过图像到视频网络生成视频。

Result: 大量实验验证，该方法在性能上大幅超越现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能有效解决相机轨迹引导视频生成中的一致性和泛化性问题，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Generating videos guided by camera trajectories poses significant challenges
in achieving consistency and generalizability, particularly when both camera
and object motions are present. Existing approaches often attempt to learn
these motions separately, which may lead to confusion regarding the relative
motion between the camera and the objects. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel approach that integrates both camera and object motions by
converting them into the motion of corresponding pixels. Utilizing a stable
diffusion network, we effectively learn reference motion maps in relation to
the specified camera trajectory. These maps, along with an extracted semantic
object prior, are then fed into an image-to-video network to generate the
desired video that can accurately follow the designated camera trajectory while
maintaining consistent object motions. Extensive experiments verify that our
model outperforms SOTA methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型在复杂对象关系、属性和空间排列描述时组合对齐失败的问题，克服现有优化和探索方法的局限性。

Method: 结合噪声优化和探索，采用基于人类判断相关性的原则性奖励选择程序，形成统一的CARINOX框架。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench++和HRS基准测试中，平均对齐分数分别提升16%和11%，在所有主要类别中一致优于最先进方法，同时保持图像质量和多样性。

Conclusion: CARINOX有效解决了文本到图像扩散模型的组合对齐问题，通过统一优化和探索策略以及原则性奖励选择，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了图像生成AI与判别器之间的竞争关系，分析了数据维度和复杂度对判别器性能的影响。发现简单和高度复杂的数据集都降低合成图像的可检测性，而中等复杂度数据集最有利于检测。


<details>

Motivation: 随着图像生成AI的快速发展，合成图像与真实图像的界限变得模糊，引发了生成器与判别器之间的军备竞赛。本文旨在探讨判别器在什么条件下处于最不利地位。

Method: 使用Kolmogorov复杂度作为数据集内在结构的度量，分析数据维度和复杂度对判别器检测能力的影响。

Result: 研究发现：增加数据维度通常增强判别器检测细微不一致的能力；简单数据集几乎可被生成器完美学习；高度多样化的数据集掩盖了生成器的缺陷；中等复杂度数据集最有利于检测，因为生成器无法完全捕获分布且错误仍然可见。

Conclusion: 数据复杂度对合成图像检测有重要影响，简单和高度复杂的数据集都降低可检测性，而中等复杂度数据集为检测创造了最有利条件。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between
synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and
discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which
discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key
factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased
dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle
inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov
complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very
simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic
images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme
diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets
create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully
capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决CLIP模型在不同分辨率下需要重新训练的问题，以及实现计算效率与准确性的动态权衡，开发了支持自适应分辨率推理的统一模型。

Method: 使用多级小波分解替代标准补丁嵌入，结合键值缓存和因果跨层注意力重用计算，采用基于置信度的门控机制实现自适应提前退出。

Result: 在零样本分类任务中，WAVECLIP仅需从冻结的CLIP教师模型进行轻量级蒸馏，就能达到竞争性准确率并显著节省计算成本。

Conclusion: WAVECLIP通过小波分词和自适应推理机制，实现了单一模型支持多分辨率处理，在保持准确性的同时大幅提升计算效率。

Abstract: We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution
inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces
standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling
the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple
resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low
resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and
causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to
the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot
classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism
enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a
compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires
only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves
competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.

TL;DR: 该论文对CLIP模型的量化进行了大规模评估，发现量化不仅能提高效率，还能改善模型可靠性指标，挑战了传统的效率-性能权衡观点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管CLIP等视觉语言模型在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但量化对CLIP性能的影响，特别是超出准确度之外的可靠性指标，尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 对CLIP模型进行大规模量化评估，不仅评估分布内准确度，还包括全面的可靠性指标分析，并测试不同的量化感知训练方法。

Result: 量化持续改善了通常欠自信的预训练模型的校准度，而对过度自信的变体会降低校准度；有趣的是，即使校准度下降，OOD检测仍可改善；某些QAT方法能同时在零样本准确度、校准度和OOD鲁棒性方面获得提升。

Conclusion: 量化可以超越传统角色，帮助部署高效、可靠和鲁棒的视觉语言模型，为多目标优化问题提供关键见解。

Abstract: The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models
(VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as
out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for
the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still
overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance
beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale
evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution
accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing
counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that
quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident
pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants.
Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other
reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these
same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific
quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in
zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a
strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights
for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable,
and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.

TL;DR: TABLET是一个大规模视觉表格理解数据集，包含400万个示例，覆盖20个任务，基于200万个唯一表格，其中88%保留原始可视化。该数据集提供图像-HTML配对表示，用于训练视觉语言模型以提高表格理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前表格理解基准主要使用合成渲染，缺乏真实世界表格的复杂性和视觉多样性，且现有数据集提供固定示例，无法访问底层序列化数据进行重新表述。

Method: 构建TABLET数据集，包含图像-HTML配对表示、全面元数据和来源信息，使用Qwen2.5-VL-7B等视觉语言模型进行微调。

Result: 在TABLET上微调视觉语言模型提高了在已见和未见VTU任务上的性能，同时增强了在真实世界表格可视化上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过保留原始可视化并在统一的大规模集合中维护示例可追溯性，TABLET为未来VTU模型的鲁棒训练和可扩展评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: While table understanding increasingly relies on pixel-only settings where
tables are processed as visual representations, current benchmarks
predominantly use synthetic renderings that lack the complexity and visual
diversity of real-world tables. Additionally, existing visual table
understanding (VTU) datasets offer fixed examples with single visualizations
and pre-defined instructions, providing no access to underlying serialized data
for reformulation. We introduce TABLET, a large-scale VTU dataset with 4
million examples across 20 tasks, grounded in 2 million unique tables where 88%
preserve original visualizations. Each example includes paired image-HTML
representations, comprehensive metadata, and provenance information linking
back to the source datasets. Fine-tuning vision-language models like
Qwen2.5-VL-7B on TABLET improves performance on seen and unseen VTU tasks while
increasing robustness on real-world table visualizations. By preserving
original visualizations and maintaining example traceability in a unified
large-scale collection, TABLET establishes a foundation for robust training and
extensible evaluation of future VTU models.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可靠的方式来控制解释保真度，基于超像素的度量更有效，为可信赖的模型解释提供了新途径。

Abstract: Feature attribution methods are widely used for explaining image-based
predictions, as they provide feature-level insights that can be intuitively
visualized. However, such explanations often vary in their robustness and may
fail to faithfully reflect the reasoning of the underlying black-box model. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel conformal prediction-based
approach that enables users to directly control the fidelity of the generated
explanations. The method identifies a subset of salient features that is
sufficient to preserve the model's prediction, regardless of the information
carried by the excluded features, and without demanding access to ground-truth
explanations for calibration. Four conformity functions are proposed to
quantify the extent to which explanations conform to the model's predictions.
The approach is empirically evaluated using five explainers across six image
datasets. The empirical results demonstrate that FastSHAP consistently
outperforms the competing methods in terms of both fidelity and informational
efficiency, the latter measured by the size of the explanation regions.
Furthermore, the results reveal that conformity measures based on super-pixels
are more effective than their pixel-wise counterparts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于骨架的手语理解方法面临三个关键限制：1）语义基础弱，模型难以将骨架动作模式与语言意义关联；2）局部细节与全局上下文不平衡；3）跨模态学习效率低，难以构建语义对齐的跨模态表示。

Conclusion: 证明了语义信息预训练的影响以及骨架数据作为手语理解独立解决方案的有效性。

Abstract: Pre-training has proven effective for learning transferable features in sign
language understanding (SLU) tasks. Recently, skeleton-based methods have
gained increasing attention because they can robustly handle variations in
subjects and backgrounds without being affected by appearance or environmental
factors. Current SLU methods continue to face three key limitations: 1) weak
semantic grounding, as models often capture low-level motion patterns from
skeletal data but struggle to relate them to linguistic meaning; 2) imbalance
between local details and global context, with models either focusing too
narrowly on fine-grained cues or overlooking them for broader context; and 3)
inefficient cross-modal learning, as constructing semantically aligned
representations across modalities remains difficult. To address these, we
propose Sigma, a unified skeleton-based SLU framework featuring: 1) a
sign-aware early fusion mechanism that facilitates deep interaction between
visual and textual modalities, enriching visual features with linguistic
context; 2) a hierarchical alignment learning strategy that jointly maximises
agreements across different levels of paired features from different
modalities, effectively capturing both fine-grained details and high-level
semantic relationships; and 3) a unified pre-training framework that combines
contrastive learning, text matching and language modelling to promote semantic
consistency and generalisation. Sigma achieves new state-of-the-art results on
isolated sign language recognition, continuous sign language recognition, and
gloss-free sign language translation on multiple benchmarks spanning different
sign and spoken languages, demonstrating the impact of semantically informative
pre-training and the effectiveness of skeletal data as a stand-alone solution
for SLU.

TL;DR: 该论文对文本-图像生成中的自动评估指标进行了广泛研究，发现没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致，不同指标在不同类型的组合问题上表现各异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本-图像生成领域严重依赖自动评估指标，但这些指标往往基于惯例或流行度而非经过人类判断验证，需要了解它们与人类偏好的对齐程度。

Method: 对广泛使用的组合文本-图像评估指标进行广泛研究，分析它们在多样化组合挑战中的行为，比较不同指标家族与人类判断的对齐情况。

Result: 结果显示：没有单一指标在所有任务中表现一致；VQA-based指标虽然流行但并非普遍优越；某些embedding-based指标在特定情况下更强；仅基于图像的指标对组合评估贡献很小。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在可信评估和作为生成奖励模型使用时，需要谨慎和透明地选择评估指标。

Abstract: Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs
truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts
remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on
automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity
rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported
progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to
understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present
a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation.
Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across
diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families
align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs
consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional
problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly
superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific
cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional
evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment.
These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric
selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models
in generation. Project page is available at

TL;DR: 提出了SlideMamba框架，结合Mamba架构和图神经网络(GNNs)进行全切片图像分析，通过基于熵的自适应融合策略平衡局部空间关系和长距离上下文依赖，在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学需要从全切片图像中提取有意义的表示来支持临床和生物学任务，现有方法在捕捉局部空间关系和长距离上下文依赖方面存在局限性。

Method: 集成Mamba架构(擅长捕捉长距离全局依赖)和GNNs(强调细粒度短距离空间交互)，引入基于熵的置信度加权机制进行自适应融合，动态平衡两个分支的贡献。

Result: 在基因融合和突变状态预测任务中，SlideMamba的PRAUC达到0.751±0.05，优于MIL(0.491±0.042)、Trans-MIL(0.39±0.017)、Mamba-only(0.664±0.063)、GNN-only(0.748±0.091)和GAT-Mamba(0.703±0.075)。

Conclusion: 集成架构结合自适应融合策略在计算病理学中显示出强大潜力，为空间分辨预测建模任务提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in computational pathology increasingly rely on extracting
meaningful representations from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) to support various
clinical and biological tasks. In this study, we propose a generalizable deep
learning framework that integrates the Mamba architecture with Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) for enhanced WSI analysis. Our method is designed to capture
both local spatial relationships and long-range contextual dependencies,
offering a flexible architecture for digital pathology analysis. Mamba modules
excels in capturing long-range global dependencies, while GNNs emphasize
fine-grained short-range spatial interactions. To effectively combine these
complementary signals, we introduce an adaptive fusion strategy that uses an
entropy-based confidence weighting mechanism. This approach dynamically
balances contributions from both branches by assigning higher weight to the
branch with more confident (lower-entropy) predictions, depending on the
contextual importance of local versus global information for different
downstream tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on a
representative task: predicting gene fusion and mutation status from WSIs. Our
framework, SlideMamba, achieves an area under the precision recall curve
(PRAUC) of 0.751 \pm 0.05, outperforming MIL (0.491 \pm 0.042), Trans-MIL (0.39
\pm 0.017), Mamba-only (0.664 \pm 0.063), GNN-only (0.748 \pm 0.091), and a
prior similar work GAT-Mamba (0.703 \pm 0.075). SlideMamba also achieves
competitive results across ROC AUC (0.738 \pm 0.055), sensitivity (0.662 \pm
0.083), and specificity (0.725 \pm 0.094). These results highlight the strength
of the integrated architecture, enhanced by the proposed entropy-based adaptive
fusion strategy, and suggest promising potential for application of
spatially-resolved predictive modeling tasks in computational pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D生成方法主要依赖图像或文本条件，缺乏细粒度的跨模态控制，限制了可控性和实际应用。

Method: 基于Hunyuan3D 2.1构建统一跨模态架构，采用渐进式难度感知采样策略，对每种控制信号进行加权训练。

Result: 实验表明额外控制信号提高了生成精度，实现了几何感知变换，并增强了生产工作流程的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态控制信号显著提升了3D资产生成的可控性和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D-native generative models have accelerated asset
creation for games, film, and design. However, most methods still rely
primarily on image or text conditioning and lack fine-grained, cross-modal
controls, which limits controllability and practical adoption. To address this
gap, we present Hunyuan3D-Omni, a unified framework for fine-grained,
controllable 3D asset generation built on Hunyuan3D 2.1. In addition to images,
Hunyuan3D-Omni accepts point clouds, voxels, bounding boxes, and skeletal pose
priors as conditioning signals, enabling precise control over geometry,
topology, and pose. Instead of separate heads for each modality, our model
unifies all signals in a single cross-modal architecture. We train with a
progressive, difficulty-aware sampling strategy that selects one control
modality per example and biases sampling toward harder signals (e.g., skeletal
pose) while downweighting easier ones (e.g., point clouds), encouraging robust
multi-modal fusion and graceful handling of missing inputs. Experiments show
that these additional controls improve generation accuracy, enable
geometry-aware transformations, and increase robustness for production
workflows.

Motivation: CNN经常利用表面相关性"作弊"，现有方法依赖专家标注，可扩展性差。受认知科学启发，需要更可扩展的方法来引导模型注意力。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型通过自然语言提示自动生成语义注意力图，引入辅助损失函数使CNN注意力与语言引导图对齐。

Result: 在ColoredMNIST和DecoyMNIST数据集上达到最先进性能，改善泛化能力，减少对捷径的依赖，模型注意力更符合人类直觉。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需人工标注的可扩展框架，能有效提升CNN的可靠性和认知合理性。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) frequently "cheat" by exploiting
superficial correlations, raising concerns about whether they make predictions
for the right reasons. Inspired by cognitive science, which highlights the role
of attention in robust human perception, recent methods have sought to guide
model attention using concept-based supervision and explanation regularization.
However, these techniques depend on labor-intensive, expert-provided
annotations, limiting their scalability. We propose a scalable framework that
leverages vision-language models to automatically generate semantic attention
maps using natural language prompts. By introducing an auxiliary loss that
aligns CNN attention with these language-guided maps, our approach promotes
more reliable and cognitively plausible decision-making without manual
annotation. Experiments on challenging datasets, ColoredMNIST and DecoyMNIST,
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ColorMNIST and
remains competitive with annotation-heavy baselines on DecoyMNIST,
demonstrating improved generalization, reduced shortcut reliance, and model
attention that better reflects human intuition.

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a critical medical imaging modality in
clinical diagnosis and research, yet its complexity and heterogeneity pose
challenges for automated analysis, particularly in scalable and generalizable
machine learning applications. While foundation models have revolutionized
natural language and vision tasks, their application to MRI remains limited due
to data scarcity and narrow anatomical focus. In this work, we present
Decipher-MR, a 3D MRI-specific vision-language foundation model trained on a
large-scale dataset comprising 200,000 MRI series from over 22,000 studies
spanning diverse anatomical regions, sequences, and pathologies. Decipher-MR
integrates self-supervised vision learning with report-guided text supervision
to build robust, generalizable representations, enabling effective adaptation
across broad applications. To enable robust and diverse clinical tasks with
minimal computational overhead, Decipher-MR supports a modular design that
enables tuning of lightweight, task-specific decoders attached to a frozen
pretrained encoder. Following this setting, we evaluate Decipher-MR across
diverse benchmarks including disease classification, demographic prediction,
anatomical localization, and cross-modal retrieval, demonstrating consistent
performance gains over existing foundation models and task-specific approaches.
Our results establish Decipher-MR as a scalable and versatile foundation for
MRI-based AI, facilitating efficient development across clinical and research

Result: 实验表明SQ-InstructBLIP在使用生成子问题作为额外信息时，在VQA任务中比先前工作实现了更准确的推理。

Conclusion: 该方法通过图像感知的子问题生成机制有效提升了视觉问答任务的推理性能。

Abstract: The field of vision-language understanding has been actively researched in
recent years, thanks to the development of Large Language Models~(LLMs).
However, it still needs help with problems requiring multi-step reasoning, even
for very simple questions. Recent studies adopt LLMs to tackle this problem by
iteratively generating sub-questions and answers. However, there are
disadvantages such as 1) the fine-grained visual contents of images are not
available using LLMs that cannot read visual information, 2) internal
mechanisms are inaccessible and difficult to reproduce by using black-box LLMs.
To solve these problems, we propose the SQ (Self-Questioning)-InstructBLIP,
which improves inference performance by generating image-aware informative
sub-questions and sub-answers iteratively. The SQ-InstructBLIP, which consists
of a Questioner, Answerer, and Reasoner that share the same architecture.
Questioner and Answerer generate sub-questions and sub-answers to help infer
the main-question, and Reasoner performs reasoning on the main-question
considering the generated sub-question information. Our experiments show that
the proposed method SQ-InstructBLIP, which uses the generated sub-questions as
additional information when solving the VQA task, performs more accurate
reasoning than the previous works.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注对齐性，检查提示指定元素是否出现，但忽视了模型在提示之外生成的内容，缺乏对T2I模型中幻觉现象的明确定义。

Method: 将T2I模型中的幻觉定义为偏见驱动的偏差，提出了包含属性幻觉、关系幻觉和对象幻觉的三类分类法。

Result: 该框架为评估设定了上限，揭示了隐藏的偏见，为更丰富的T2I模型评估奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 明确定义T2I模型中的幻觉现象对于全面评估模型性能至关重要，提出的分类法为未来研究提供了系统框架。

Abstract: In language and vision-language models, hallucination is broadly understood
as content generated from a model's prior knowledge or biases rather than from
the given input. While this phenomenon has been studied in those domains, it
has not been clearly framed for text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Existing
evaluations mainly focus on alignment, checking whether prompt-specified
elements appear, but overlook what the model generates beyond the prompt. We
argue for defining hallucination in T2I as bias-driven deviations and propose a
taxonomy with three categories: attribute, relation, and object hallucinations.
This framing introduces an upper bound for evaluation and surfaces hidden
biases, providing a foundation for richer assessment of T2I models.

Abstract: Micro-action Recognition is vital for psychological assessment and
human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often fail in real-world
scenarios because inter-person variability causes the same action to manifest
differently, hindering robust generalization. To address this, we propose the
Person Independence Universal Micro-action Recognition Framework, which
integrates Distributionally Robust Optimization principles to learn
person-agnostic representations. Our framework contains two plug-and-play
components operating at the feature and loss levels. At the feature level, the
Temporal-Frequency Alignment Module normalizes person-specific motion
characteristics with a dual-branch design: the temporal branch applies
Wasserstein-regularized alignment to stabilize dynamic trajectories, while the
frequency branch introduces variance-guided perturbations to enhance robustness
against person-specific spectral differences. A consistency-driven fusion
mechanism integrates both branches. At the loss level, the Group-Invariant
Regularized Loss partitions samples into pseudo-groups to simulate unseen
person-specific distributions. By up-weighting boundary cases and regularizing
subgroup variance, it forces the model to generalize beyond easy or frequent
samples, thus enhancing robustness to difficult variations. Experiments on the
large-scale MA-52 dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing
methods in both accuracy and robustness, achieving stable generalization under
fine-grained conditions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D几何基础模型VGGT的语义匹配方法，通过保留VGGT的早期特征、微调后期层、添加语义头，并结合循环一致性训练、合成数据增强等技术，解决了现有方法在几何歧义和最近邻规则方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义匹配方法存在两个主要问题：几何歧义（依赖2D基础模型特征无法处理对称结构）和最近邻规则（像素级匹配忽略跨图像不可见性和流形保持）。需要几何感知的像素描述符和整体密集对应机制。

Method: 1) 保留VGGT早期特征，微调后期层，添加语义头实现双向对应；2) 在数据稀缺情况下，采用循环一致性训练策略、合成数据增强和渐进训练方案，并缓解混叠伪影。

Result: 实验表明该方法在几何感知、匹配可靠性和流形保持方面表现优异，超越了之前的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将3D几何基础模型VGGT适应于语义匹配任务，克服了数据稀缺和跨实例匹配的挑战，实现了更好的几何感知和匹配性能。

Abstract: Semantic matching aims to establish pixel-level correspondences between
instances of the same category and represents a fundamental task in computer
vision. Existing approaches suffer from two limitations: (i) Geometric
Ambiguity: Their reliance on 2D foundation model features (e.g., Stable
Diffusion, DINO) often fails to disambiguate symmetric structures, requiring
extra fine-tuning yet lacking generalization; (ii) Nearest-Neighbor Rule: Their
pixel-wise matching ignores cross-image invisibility and neglects manifold
preservation. These challenges call for geometry-aware pixel descriptors and
holistic dense correspondence mechanisms. Inspired by recent advances in 3D
geometric foundation models, we turn to VGGT, which provides geometry-grounded
features and holistic dense matching capabilities well aligned with these
needs. However, directly transferring VGGT is challenging, as it was originally
designed for geometry matching within cross views of a single instance,
misaligned with cross-instance semantic matching, and further hindered by the
scarcity of dense semantic annotations. To address this, we propose an approach
that (i) retains VGGT's intrinsic strengths by reusing early feature stages,
fine-tuning later ones, and adding a semantic head for bidirectional
correspondences; and (ii) adapts VGGT to the semantic matching scenario under
data scarcity through cycle-consistent training strategy, synthetic data
augmentation, and progressive training recipe with aliasing artifact
mitigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior geometry awareness, matching reliability, and manifold preservation,
outperforming previous baselines.

TL;DR: 提出MedVSR框架，专门用于医学视频超分辨率，通过跨状态空间传播解决帧对齐问题，使用内部状态空间重建模块增强组织结构并减少伪影。

Conclusion: MedVSR通过专门设计的跨状态空间传播和内部状态空间重建模块，有效解决了医学视频超分辨率中的配准困难和伪影问题，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的视频增强方案。

Abstract: High-resolution (HR) medical videos are vital for accurate diagnosis, yet are
hard to acquire due to hardware limitations and physiological constraints.
Clinically, the collected low-resolution (LR) medical videos present unique
challenges for video super-resolution (VSR) models, including camera shake,
noise, and abrupt frame transitions, which result in significant optical flow
errors and alignment difficulties. Additionally, tissues and organs exhibit
continuous and nuanced structures, but current VSR models are prone to
introducing artifacts and distorted features that can mislead doctors. To this
end, we propose MedVSR, a tailored framework for medical VSR. It first employs
Cross State-Space Propagation (CSSP) to address the imprecise alignment by
projecting distant frames as control matrices within state-space models,
enabling the selective propagation of consistent and informative features to
neighboring frames for effective alignment. Moreover, we design an Inner
State-Space Reconstruction (ISSR) module that enhances tissue structures and
reduces artifacts with joint long-range spatial feature learning and
large-kernel short-range information aggregation. Experiments across four
datasets in diverse medical scenarios, including endoscopy and cataract
surgeries, show that MedVSR significantly outperforms existing VSR models in
reconstruction performance and efficiency. Code released at

Conclusion: VAS方法能有效稳定策略优化，发布的数据和模型为社区提供了标准化基准

Abstract: Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their
advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open,
large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability
of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone
to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization
signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We
propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by
Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory
diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We
release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT
cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty,
and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase.
(3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales,
establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across
mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the
curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses
provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition,
we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected
policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize
this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at

model by fine-tuning on two downstream marine earth observation tasks. We first
assess model performance compared to current baseline models used to quantify
chlorophyll concentration. We then evaluate the FMs ability to refine remote
sensing-based estimates of ocean primary production. Our results demonstrate
the utility of self-trained FMs for marine monitoring, in particular for making
use of small amounts of high quality labelled data and in capturing detailed
spatial patterns of ocean colour whilst matching point observations. We
conclude that this new generation of geospatial AI models has the potential to
provide more robust, data-driven insights into ocean ecosystems and their role
in global climate processes.

TL;DR: SHINE是一个无需训练的框架，用于实现无缝、高保真的图像合成，通过引入流形引导锚点损失、退化抑制指导和自适应背景融合来解决复杂光照和高分辨率输入下的合成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像合成模型在处理复杂光照（如准确阴影、水面反射）和多样化高分辨率输入时表现不佳，而现代文本到图像扩散模型虽然编码了必要的物理和分辨率先验，但缺乏释放这些能力的框架。

Method: SHINE引入流形引导锚点损失，利用预训练定制适配器（如IP-Adapter）指导潜在表示以保持主体忠实性；提出退化抑制指导和自适应背景融合来消除低质量输出和可见接缝。

Result: 在ComplexCompo和DreamEditBench上的实验显示，SHINE在标准指标（如DINOv2）和人类对齐评分（如DreamSim、ImageReward、VisionReward）上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: SHINE提供了一个无需训练的高质量图像合成框架，并引入了包含多样化分辨率和挑战性条件的ComplexCompo基准测试，代码和基准将在发表后公开。

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert a user-specified object into a
new scene, but existing models struggle with complex lighting (e.g., accurate
shadows, water reflections) and diverse, high-resolution inputs. Modern
text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX) already encode essential
physical and resolution priors, yet lack a framework to unleash them without
resorting to latent inversion, which often locks object poses into contextually
inappropriate orientations, or brittle attention surgery. We propose SHINE, a
training-free framework for Seamless, High-fidelity Insertion with Neutralized
Errors. SHINE introduces manifold-steered anchor loss, leveraging pretrained
customization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to guide latents for faithful subject
representation while preserving background integrity. Degradation-suppression
guidance and adaptive background blending are proposed to further eliminate
low-quality outputs and visible seams. To address the lack of rigorous
benchmarks, we introduce ComplexCompo, featuring diverse resolutions and
challenging conditions such as low lighting, strong illumination, intricate
shadows, and reflective surfaces. Experiments on ComplexCompo and
DreamEditBench show state-of-the-art performance on standard metrics (e.g.,
DINOv2) and human-aligned scores (e.g., DreamSim, ImageReward, VisionReward).
Code and benchmark will be publicly available upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出了QuantVGGT框架，首次针对VGGT模型进行量化，解决了亿级参数VGGT量化中的重尾分布和多视角数据校准问题，在4位量化下实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍加速，同时保持98%以上的重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于学习的3D重建模型（如VGGT）计算和内存成本过高，阻碍实际部署。传统PTQ方法在压缩亿级VGGT时面临数据无关特殊令牌导致的重尾激活分布，以及多视角3D数据带来的校准样本选择不稳定问题。

Method: 1. 双平滑细粒度量化：结合预全局Hadamard旋转和后局部通道平滑，缓解重尾分布和通道间方差；2. 噪声过滤多样化采样：通过深层统计过滤异常值，构建帧感知多样化校准簇确保稳定量化范围。

Result: QuantVGGT在不同基准和位宽下均达到最先进结果，大幅超越之前的通用量化方法。4位量化实现3.7倍内存减少和2.5倍硬件推理加速，重建精度保持在全精度模型的98%以上。

Conclusion: QuantVGGT在资源受限场景下具有显著优势和实用性，为VGGT模型的部署提供了有效的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Learning-based 3D reconstruction models, represented by Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformers (VGGTs), have made remarkable progress with the use of
large-scale transformers. Their prohibitive computational and memory costs
severely hinder real-world deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) has
become a common practice for compressing and accelerating models. However, we
empirically observe that PTQ faces unique obstacles when compressing
billion-scale VGGTs: the data-independent special tokens induce heavy-tailed
activation distributions, while the multi-view nature of 3D data makes
calibration sample selection highly unstable. This paper proposes the first
Quantization framework for VGGTs, namely QuantVGGT. This mainly relies on two
technical contributions: First, we introduce Dual-Smoothed Fine-Grained
Quantization, which integrates pre-global Hadamard rotation and post-local
channel smoothing to mitigate heavy-tailed distributions and inter-channel
variance robustly. Second, we design Noise-Filtered Diverse Sampling, which
filters outliers via deep-layer statistics and constructs frame-aware diverse
calibration clusters to ensure stable quantization ranges. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that QuantVGGT achieves the state-of-the-art results
across different benchmarks and bit-width, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art generic quantization method with a great margin. We highlight
that our 4-bit QuantVGGT can deliver a 3.7$\times$ memory reduction and
2.5$\times$ acceleration in real-hardware inference, while maintaining
reconstruction accuracy above 98\% of its full-precision counterpart. This
demonstrates the vast advantages and practicality of QuantVGGT in
resource-constrained scenarios. Our code is released in
https://github.com/wlfeng0509/QuantVGGT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NewtonGen是一个结合数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理的文本到视频生成框架，通过可训练的神经牛顿动力学(NND)建模牛顿运动，解决现有模型物理一致性和可控性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模文本到视频生成的主要瓶颈是物理一致性和可控性。现有模型经常产生不真实的运动（如物体向上坠落）和缺乏精确参数控制，这是因为它们仅从外观学习运动分布，缺乏对底层动力学的理解。

Method: 提出NewtonGen框架，核心是可训练的神经牛顿动力学(NND)，能够建模和预测各种牛顿运动，将潜在动力学约束注入视频生成过程。通过联合利用数据先验和动力学指导实现物理一致的视频合成。

Result: NewtonGen能够生成物理一致的视频，并具有精确的参数控制能力，解决了现有模型在物理一致性方面的根本限制。

Conclusion: 通过集成数据驱动合成与可学习物理原理，NewtonGen框架显著提升了文本到视频生成的物理一致性和可控性，为物理感知的视频生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: A primary bottleneck in large-scale text-to-video generation today is
physical consistency and controllability. Despite recent advances,
state-of-the-art models often produce unrealistic motions, such as objects
falling upward, or abrupt changes in velocity and direction. Moreover, these
models lack precise parameter control, struggling to generate physically
consistent dynamics under different initial conditions. We argue that this
fundamental limitation stems from current models learning motion distributions
solely from appearance, while lacking an understanding of the underlying
dynamics. In this work, we propose NewtonGen, a framework that integrates
data-driven synthesis with learnable physical principles. At its core lies
trainable Neural Newtonian Dynamics (NND), which can model and predict a
variety of Newtonian motions, thereby injecting latent dynamical constraints
into the video generation process. By jointly leveraging data priors and
dynamical guidance, NewtonGen enables physically consistent video synthesis
with precise parameter control.

Conclusion: 该框架使先进的生成式AI真正适用于实际部署，从手机到桌面电脑的全设备谱系都能使用。

Abstract: We present SD3.5-Flash, an efficient few-step distillation framework that
brings high-quality image generation to accessible consumer devices. Our
approach distills computationally prohibitive rectified flow models through a
reformulated distribution matching objective tailored specifically for few-step
generation. We introduce two key innovations: "timestep sharing" to reduce
gradient noise and "split-timestep fine-tuning" to improve prompt alignment.
Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder
restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid
generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware
configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices,
from mobile phones to desktop computers. Through extensive evaluation including
large-scale user studies, we demonstrate that SD3.5-Flash consistently
outperforms existing few-step methods, making advanced generative AI truly
accessible for practical deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CLAUSE是一个神经符号框架，通过三个智能体协同工作，在知识图谱上进行上下文构建，在保证准确率的同时控制延迟和成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态k跳扩展和"think-longer"提示方法存在过度检索、上下文膨胀和运行时不可预测的问题，需要在准确率、延迟和成本之间取得平衡。

Method: 采用LC-MAPPO算法协调三个智能体：子图架构师、路径导航器和上下文策展人，在资源预算下联合优化子图构建、推理路径发现和证据选择。

Result: 在HotpotQA、MetaQA和FactKG数据集上，CLAUSE在相同或更低的token预算下获得更高的EM@1，同时减少子图增长和端到端延迟。在MetaQA-2-hop上，相比GraphRAG基线，EM@1提升39.3%，延迟降低18.6%，边增长降低40.9%。

Conclusion: CLAUSE能够生成紧凑、保留来源的上下文，在部署约束下提供可预测的性能，实现了准确率、延迟和成本之间的平衡。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs provide structured context for multi-hop question answering,
but deployed systems must balance answer accuracy with strict latency and cost
targets while preserving provenance. Static k-hop expansions and "think-longer"
prompting often over-retrieve, inflate context, and yield unpredictable
runtime. We introduce CLAUSE, an agentic three-agent neuro-symbolic framework
that treats context construction as a sequential decision process over
knowledge graphs, deciding what to expand, which paths to follow or backtrack,
what evidence to keep, and when to stop. Latency (interaction steps) and prompt
cost (selected tokens) are exposed as user-specified budgets or prices,
allowing per-query adaptation to trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost
without retraining. CLAUSE employs the proposed Lagrangian-Constrained
Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LC-MAPPO) algorithm to coordinate
three agents: Subgraph Architect, Path Navigator, and Context Curator, so that
subgraph construction, reasoning-path discovery, and evidence selection are
jointly optimized under per-query resource budgets on edge edits, interaction
steps, and selected tokens. Across HotpotQA, MetaQA, and FactKG, CLAUSE yields
higher EM@1 while reducing subgraph growth and end-to-end latency at equal or
lower token budgets. On MetaQA-2-hop, relative to the strongest RAG baseline
(GraphRAG), CLAUSE achieves +39.3 EM@1 with 18.6% lower latency and 40.9% lower
edge growth. The resulting contexts are compact, provenance-preserving, and
deliver predictable performance under deployment constraints.

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了说服效能主要取决于模型规模的假设，提出说服动态由模型的认知过程（特别是显式推理能力）决定，揭示了说服二元性：LRM推理过程更抗说服，但分享推理内容能显著增强其说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解多智能体系统中LLM和LRM协作解决复杂问题时的说服动态，挑战模型规模决定说服效能的流行假设。

Method: 通过一系列多智能体说服实验，研究不同模型的认知过程对说服动态的影响，包括多跳说服网络中的影响传播和衰减。

Result: 发现LRM的推理过程具有更强的说服抵抗性，但分享推理内容能显著提高其说服能力；揭示了多智能体网络中复杂的影响传播动态。

Conclusion: 研究提供了模型内部处理架构与外部说服行为之间联系的系统证据，为高级模型的易感性提供了新解释，对MAS的安全性、鲁棒性和设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of recent Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), where Large
Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) usually collaborate to
solve complex problems, necessitates a deep understanding of the persuasion
dynamics that govern their interactions. This paper challenges the prevailing
hypothesis that persuasive efficacy is primarily a function of model scale. We
propose instead that these dynamics are fundamentally dictated by a model's
underlying cognitive process, especially its capacity for explicit reasoning.
Through a series of multi-agent persuasion experiments, we uncover a
fundamental trade-off we term the Persuasion Duality. Our findings reveal that
the reasoning process in LRMs exhibits significantly greater resistance to
persuasion, maintaining their initial beliefs more robustly. Conversely, making
this reasoning process transparent by sharing the "thinking content"
dramatically increases their ability to persuade others. We further consider
more complex transmission persuasion situations and reveal complex dynamics of
influence propagation and decay within multi-hop persuasion between multiple
agent networks. This research provides systematic evidence linking a model's
internal processing architecture to its external persuasive behavior, offering
a novel explanation for the susceptibility of advanced models and highlighting
critical implications for the safety, robustness, and design of future MAS.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TrustJudge框架，解决LLM作为评估器时的评分不一致性问题，包括评分比较不一致和成对传递性不一致，通过分布敏感评分和似然感知聚合来提升评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM作为评估器的框架存在严重的不一致性问题，包括评分比较不一致（低分回答在成对比较中优于高分回答）和成对传递性不一致（循环偏好链和等价矛盾），这源于离散评分系统的信息损失和模糊的平局判断。

Method: 提出TrustJudge概率框架：1）分布敏感评分，从离散评分概率计算连续期望，保留信息熵；2）似然感知聚合，使用双向偏好概率或困惑度解决传递性违规问题。

Result: 使用Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct作为评估器，TrustJudge将评分比较不一致性降低8.43%（从23.32%到14.89%），成对传递性不一致性降低10.82%（从15.22%到4.40%），同时保持更高的评估准确性。

Conclusion: TrustJudge提供了首个对LLM作为评估器框架不一致性的系统分析，提供了理论洞见和实用解决方案，无需额外训练或人工标注即可实现更可靠的自动化评估。

Abstract: The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automated evaluators
(LLM-as-a-judge) has revealed critical inconsistencies in current evaluation
frameworks. We identify two fundamental types of inconsistencies: (1)
Score-Comparison Inconsistency, where lower-rated responses outperform
higher-scored ones in pairwise comparisons, and (2) Pairwise Transitivity
Inconsistency, manifested through circular preference chains (A>B>C>A) and
equivalence contradictions (A=B=C\neq A). We argue that these issues come from
information loss in discrete rating systems and ambiguous tie judgments during
pairwise evaluation. We propose TrustJudge, a probabilistic framework that
addresses these limitations through two key innovations: 1)
distribution-sensitive scoring that computes continuous expectations from
discrete rating probabilities, preserving information entropy for more precise
scoring, and 2) likelihood-aware aggregation that resolves transitivity
violations using bidirectional preference probabilities or perplexity. We also
formalize the theoretical limitations of current LLM-as-a-judge frameworks and
demonstrate how TrustJudge's components overcome them. When evaluated with
Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct as judge using our dataset, TrustJudge reduces
Score-Comparison inconsistency by 8.43% (from 23.32% to 14.89%) and Pairwise
Transitivity inconsistency by 10.82% (from 15.22% to 4.40%), while maintaining
higher evaluation accuracy. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of
evaluation framework inconsistencies in LLM-as-a-judge paradigms, offering both
theoretical insights and practical solutions for reliable automated assessment.
The framework demonstrates consistent improvements across various model
architectures and scales, enabling more trustworthy LLM evaluation without
requiring additional training or human annotations. The codes can be found at

Motivation: 当前方法通常不加区分地使用CoT数据，但哪些数据类型能最有效提升模型推理能力仍是一个关键问题。论文首次定义了基础模型的推理潜力，并探索如何通过高价值推理模式来扩展这种潜力。

Method: 从CoT序列中抽象出具有共性和归纳能力的原子推理模式，构建富含价值推理模式的核心参考集，并提出基于推理模式链和token熵的双粒度算法来高效选择高价值CoT数据。

Result: 仅使用100亿token的CoTP数据，就能使850亿参数的MoE模型在AIME 2024和2025上提升9.58%，并将下游RL性能上限提高7.81%。

Conclusion: 通过选择性地利用富含高价值推理模式的CoT数据，可以有效扩展模型的推理潜力，显著提升数学推理性能，且数据效率极高。

Abstract: Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical
reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long
chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to
substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often
utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which
data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this
paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time
as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly
answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model
performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value
reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract
atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and
inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched
with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity
algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently
selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the
core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only
10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve
by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of
downstream RL performance by 7.81%.

retrieve/scale up relevant video clips with minimal user input. Specifically,
considering the user interface, our agent defines various user-friendly ways
for the user to specify requirements based on textual descriptions and
confirmations. As for agent functions, we leverage existing multi-modal large
language models to connect the user's requirements with the video content. More
importantly, we propose two novel filtering policies that can be updated when
user interaction is continually performed. Finally, we provide a new benchmark
for personalized video dataset collection, and carefully conduct the user study
to verify our agent's usage in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our agent for customized video

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-agent systems (MAS) enable tools for information

via a forum-style interface, supporting @-mention to invite targeted agents,
threading for parallel exploration, with a real-time mind map for visualizing
arguments and rationales. In a within-subjects study with 18 participants, we
compared Perspectra to a group-chat baseline as they developed research
proposals. Our findings show that Perspectra significantly increased the
frequency and depth of critical-thinking behaviors, elicited more
interdisciplinary replies, and led to more frequent proposal revisions than the
group chat condition. We discuss implications for designing multi-agent tools
that scaffold critical thinking by supporting user control over multi-agent

Abstract: This paper introduces the Hazard-Aware System Card (HASC), a novel framework
designed to enhance transparency and accountability in the development and
deployment of AI systems. The HASC builds upon existing model card and system
card concepts by integrating a comprehensive, dynamic record of an AI system's
security and safety posture. The framework proposes a standardized system of
identifiers, including a novel AI Safety Hazard (ASH) ID, to complement
existing security identifiers like CVEs, allowing for clear and consistent
communication of fixed flaws. By providing a single, accessible source of
truth, the HASC empowers developers and stakeholders to make more informed
decisions about AI system safety throughout its lifecycle. Ultimately, we also
compare our proposed AI system cards with the ISO/IEC 42001:2023 standard and
discuss how they can be used to complement each other, providing greater
transparency and accountability for AI systems.

### [163] [Every Character Counts: From Vulnerability to Defense in Phishing Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20589)
*Maria Chiper,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文研究了字符级深度学习模型在钓鱼检测中的有效性，评估了CharCNN、CharGRU和CharBiLSTM三种模型在标准训练、对抗攻击和对抗训练三种场景下的表现，发现CharGRU在计算资源受限时表现最佳，并通过Grad-CAM技术实现了模型决策的可视化解释。

Result: 在计算资源受限环境下，CharGRU在所有场景中表现最佳；所有模型对对抗攻击都表现出脆弱性，但对抗训练显著提高了鲁棒性；成功实现了模型决策的可视化解释。

Conclusion: 字符级深度学习模型能够为钓鱼检测提供鲁棒性和可解释性，CharGRU在资源受限环境中是最佳选择，对抗训练能有效提升模型鲁棒性，Grad-CAM技术有助于理解模型决策过程。

Abstract: Phishing attacks targeting both organizations and individuals are becoming an
increasingly significant threat as technology advances. Current automatic
detection methods often lack explainability and robustness in detecting new
phishing attacks. In this work, we investigate the effectiveness of
character-level deep learning models for phishing detection, which can provide
both robustness and interpretability. We evaluate three neural architectures
adapted to operate at the character level, namely CharCNN, CharGRU, and
CharBiLSTM, on a custom-built email dataset, which combines data from multiple
sources. Their performance is analyzed under three scenarios: (i) standard
training and testing, (ii) standard training and testing under adversarial
attacks, and (iii) training and testing with adversarial examples. Aiming to
develop a tool that operates as a browser extension, we test all models under
limited computational resources. In this constrained setup, CharGRU proves to
be the best-performing model across all scenarios. All models show
vulnerability to adversarial attacks, but adversarial training substantially
improves their robustness. In addition, by adapting the Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to character-level inputs, we are able
to visualize which parts of each email influence the decision of each model.

### [164] [PMark: Towards Robust and Distortion-free Semantic-level Watermarking with Channel Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21057)
*Jiahao Huo,Shuliang Liu,Bin Wang,Junyan Zhang,Yibo Yan,Aiwei Liu,Xuming Hu,Mingxun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出PMark，一种基于代理函数的语义级水印方法，通过动态估计中位数和多重约束通道，实现无失真水印并提升抗攻击能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义级水印方法缺乏理论鲁棒性保证，且基于拒绝采样的生成会导致显著分布失真

Method: 构建代理函数理论框架，动态估计句子中位数，通过多重约束通道增强水印证据，提供经验优化版本提升采样效率

Result: PMark在文本质量和鲁棒性方面均优于现有基线方法

Conclusion: PMark为检测机器生成文本提供了更有效的范式

Abstract: Semantic-level watermarking (SWM) for large language models (LLMs) enhances
watermarking robustness against text modifications and paraphrasing attacks by
treating the sentence as the fundamental unit. However, existing methods still
lack strong theoretical guarantees of robustness, and reject-sampling-based
generation often introduces significant distribution distortions compared with
unwatermarked outputs. In this work, we introduce a new theoretical framework
on SWM through the concept of proxy functions (PFs) $\unicode{x2013}$ functions
that map sentences to scalar values. Building on this framework, we propose
PMark, a simple yet powerful SWM method that estimates the PF median for the
next sentence dynamically through sampling while enforcing multiple PF
constraints (which we call channels) to strengthen watermark evidence. Equipped
with solid theoretical guarantees, PMark achieves the desired distortion-free
property and improves the robustness against paraphrasing-style attacks. We
also provide an empirically optimized version that further removes the
requirement for dynamical median estimation for better sampling efficiency.
Experimental results show that PMark consistently outperforms existing SWM
baselines in both text quality and robustness, offering a more effective
paradigm for detecting machine-generated text. Our code will be released at
[this URL](https://github.com/PMark-repo/PMark).

### [165] [BlockFUL: Enabling Unlearning in Blockchained Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16294)
*Xiao Liu,Mingyuan Li,Xu Wang,Guangsheng Yu,Wei Ni,Lixiang Li,Haipeng Peng,Renping Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了BlockFUL框架，通过双链结构和两种遗忘范式（并行和顺序）来解决区块链联邦学习中的模型遗忘问题，有效降低计算成本和数据依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链联邦学习中的模型遗忘面临挑战，因为模型具有复杂的继承关系，且需要编辑多个区块链记录和更新所有继承模型，过程复杂。

Method: 采用双链结构（实时链和归档链），引入并行和顺序两种遗忘范式，通过梯度上升和重新训练两种方法实现模型遗忘。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和Fashion-MNIST数据集上使用AlexNet、ResNet18和MobileNetV2模型验证，有效减少了数据依赖和操作开销。

Conclusion: BlockFUL框架显著提升了区块链联邦学习中继承模型的遗忘性能，降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Unlearning in Federated Learning (FL) presents significant challenges, as
models grow and evolve with complex inheritance relationships. This complexity
is amplified when blockchain is employed to ensure the integrity and
traceability of FL, where the need to edit multiple interlinked blockchain
records and update all inherited models complicates the process.In this paper,
we introduce Blockchained Federated Unlearning (BlockFUL), a novel framework
with a dual-chain structure comprising a live chain and an archive chain for
enabling unlearning capabilities within Blockchained FL. BlockFUL introduces
two new unlearning paradigms, i.e., parallel and sequential paradigms, which
can be effectively implemented through gradient-ascent-based and
re-training-based unlearning methods. These methods enhance the unlearning
process across multiple inherited models by enabling efficient consensus
operations and reducing computational costs. Our extensive experiments validate
that these methods effectively reduce data dependency and operational overhead,
thereby boosting the overall performance of unlearning inherited models within
BlockFUL on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST datasets using AlexNet, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2 models.

### [166] [Optimal Transport Based Hyperspectral Unmixing for Highly Mixed Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20417)
*D. Doutsas,B. Figliuzzi*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出基于最优传输(OT)的新方法解决高混合盲高光谱解混问题，通过OT衡量目标分布与真实丰度分布的差异作为正则化项，在高度混合数据下能更好估计端元


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决盲高光谱解混中高度混合数据带来的挑战，传统方法在数据高度混合时效果不佳

Method: 使用最优传输(OT)衡量目标Dirichlet分布与真实丰度分布的差异，将其作为正则化项加入优化问题，结合无监督深度学习

Result: 实验表明该方法在高度混合数据下能更好估计端元，且对目标丰度分布的选择具有鲁棒性

Conclusion: 基于OT的正则化方法有效解决了高混合盲高光谱解混问题，提升了端元估计性能

Abstract: We propose a novel approach based on optimal transport (OT) for tackling the
problem of highly mixed data in blind hyperspectral unmixing. Our method
constrains the distribution of the estimated abundance matrix to resemble a
targeted Dirichlet distribution more closely. The novelty lies in using OT to
measure the discrepancy between the targeted and true abundance distributions,
which we incorporate as a regularization term in our optimization problem. We
demonstrate the efficiency of our method through a case study involving an
unsupervised deep learning approach. Our experiments show that the proposed
approach allows for a better estimation of the endmembers in the presence of
highly mixed data, while displaying robustness to the choice of target
abundance distribution.

### [167] [RadAgents: Multimodal Agentic Reasoning for Chest X-ray Interpretation with Radiologist-like Workflows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20490)
*Kai Zhang,Corey D Barrett,Jangwon Kim,Lichao Sun,Tara Taghavi,Krishnaram Kenthapadi*

Main category: cs.MA

TL;DR: RadAgents是一个用于胸部X光片解读的多智能体框架，通过结合临床先验知识和任务感知的多模态推理，解决了现有方法在临床可解释性、多模态证据融合和跨工具一致性检测方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有胸部X光片解读方法存在三个主要问题：推理过程缺乏临床可解释性且不符合指南；多模态证据融合不足，产生仅基于文本的推理；系统无法检测和解决跨工具不一致性，缺乏验证机制。

Method: 提出了RadAgents多智能体框架，结合临床先验知识和任务感知的多模态推理，集成基础定位和多模态检索增强来验证和解决上下文冲突。

Result: 该方法产生了更可靠、透明且与临床实践一致的输出结果。

Conclusion: RadAgents框架通过多智能体协作和验证机制，显著提升了胸部X光片解读的可靠性和临床相关性。

Abstract: Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks
through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and
external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation,
prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither
clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere
aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused,
yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems
rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled
verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a
multi-agent framework for CXR interpretation that couples clinical priors with
task-aware multimodal reasoning. In addition, we integrate grounding and
multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts,
resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with
clinical practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态代理在通用GUI交互中表现优异，但在车载系统中的应用尚未充分探索。车载GUI面临驾驶员注意力有限、严格安全要求和复杂基于位置的交互模式等独特挑战。

Method: 开发了Automotive-ENV基准测试平台，包含185个参数化任务，涵盖显式控制、隐式意图理解和安全感知任务。提出了ASURADA代理，集成GPS信息来根据位置、环境条件和区域驾驶规范动态调整行为。

Conclusion: 地理感知上下文对车载代理的安全性和适应性至关重要，将发布完整的Automotive-ENV平台以促进安全自适应车载代理的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in
GPS-denied environments. While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme
weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather
operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an
equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm
pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the
graph, and employs separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature
processing. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse
radar data, improving inter-frame correspondence. Experiments on the
open-source dataset and self-collected dataset show Equi-RO outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy and robustness. Overall, our method
achieves 10.7% and 20.0% relative improvements in translation and rotation
accuracy, respectively, compared to the best baseline on the open-source
dataset.

*Wei-Teng Chu,Tianyi Zhang,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FINS是一个轻量级框架，能够从单张或少量图像快速重建高保真表面和SDF场，训练时间仅需几秒，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式表面重建方法如NeuS需要多视角图像和长时间训练，限制了实际应用。本文旨在开发仅需单张图像就能快速重建神经表面的方法。

Method: FINS整合多分辨率哈希网格编码器与轻量级几何和颜色头，使用近似二阶优化器实现高效训练。利用预训练基础模型从单张RGB图像估计几何信息。

Result: 实验表明，在相同条件下，FINS在收敛速度和表面重建、SDF场估计精度方面均优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: FINS能够高效地从单张图像重建神经表面，并成功应用于机器人表面跟随任务，在多个基准数据集上展现出良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

*Shouren Mao,Minghao Qin,Wei Dong,Huajian Liu,Yongzhuo Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAM-NAS是一种资源感知的多目标神经架构搜索方法，通过子网互蒸馏和延迟代理预测器，在机器人边缘硬件上平衡模型精度和推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NAS方法在超网络训练方面不足，且很少关注实际机器人硬件资源限制，需要开发资源感知的NAS方法。

Method: 引入子网互蒸馏概念，使用DKD损失增强蒸馏性能，训练延迟代理预测器估计硬件推理延迟，采用多目标进化搜索平衡精度和延迟。

Result: RAM-NAS模型在ImageNet上达到76.7%-81.4%的top-1准确率，在三种机器人边缘硬件上显著降低推理延迟，检测和分割任务推理时间相比MobileNetv3方法均有减少。

Conclusion: RAM-NAS填补了NAS在机器人硬件资源感知方面的空白，实现了在边缘硬件上高效部署深度学习模型。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出JFTO框架，通过关节流轨迹优化从人类视频演示中学习抓取姿态和物体轨迹，解决机器人操作中的本体差异和关节可行性约束问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类视频演示学习为机器人操作提供可扩展方案，但面临本体差异和关节可行性约束的挑战。

Method: 采用对象中心方法，平衡三个目标：选择可行抓取姿态、生成与演示一致的物体轨迹、确保无碰撞执行。扩展流匹配到SE(3)进行概率轨迹建模。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界实验中验证了方法在多样化操作任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: JFTO框架成功解决了视频演示学习中的关键挑战，实现了可靠的抓取姿态生成和物体轨迹模仿。

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言驱动的无SLAM导航框架，用语义推理和轻量拓扑表示替代传统几何建图，实现四足机器人的鲁棒导航


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SLAM方法在快速运动、标定需求和传感器漂移下表现脆弱，且缺乏语义推理能力，无法支持任务驱动的探索

Method: 采用分层视觉语言感知模块融合场景级上下文和物体级线索，构建语义-概率拓扑地图，结合LLM全局推理和视觉局部规划

Result: 实验表明在语义准确性、规划质量和导航成功率方面均有提升，消融研究验证了分层感知和局部规划的必要性

Conclusion: 该工作开创了无SLAM、视觉语言驱动的导航新范式，将机器人探索从几何中心建图转向语义驱动决策

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MASt3R-Fusion是一个多传感器辅助的视觉SLAM框架，将前馈点云图回归与惯性测量和GNSS数据紧密集成，通过Sim(3)视觉对齐约束和分层因子图设计，实现实时姿态跟踪和全局一致建图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉SLAM在低纹理环境、尺度模糊和挑战性视觉条件下表现不佳，而基于神经网络的前馈点云图回归方法虽然能恢复高保真3D场景几何，但往往丢弃了概率多传感器信息融合的优势。

Method: 提出Sim(3)视觉对齐约束，集成到通用度量尺度SE(3)因子图中进行有效信息融合；采用分层因子图设计，支持实时滑动窗口优化和具有激进闭环的全局优化。

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion框架成功整合了前馈点云图回归与多传感器信息，实现了实时姿态跟踪、度量尺度结构感知和全局一致建图，代码将开源以支持可复现性和进一步研究。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出TISA模块解决自动驾驶规划中自回归模型的时空不对齐问题，通过时间不变空间对齐校正智能体的世界观，结合运动学动作预测和多目标DPO训练，在NAVSIM数据集上达到89.8 PDMS的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在自动驾驶端到端规划中表现出色，但其性能受限于时空不对齐问题——规划器必须基于过去感知数据预测未来动作，造成世界观不一致，限制了这种强大方法的性能上限。

Method: 1) TISA模块学习将初始环境特征投影到每个未来时间步的一致自我中心坐标系；2) 运动学动作预测头确保物理可行的轨迹；3) 多目标DPO后训练阶段提供针对特定驾驶行为的精细化学习信号。

Result: 在NAVSIM数据集上达到89.8 PDMS的性能，在自回归模型中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: TISA模块有效解决了自回归规划器的时空对齐问题，结合运动学约束和多目标优化，显著提升了自动驾驶端到端规划的性能上限。

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人世界模型存在推理速度慢和生成轨迹物理合理性不足的问题，主要原因是逐帧生成方法的计算冗余和忽视关键语义转换的重要性。

Method: 1) 通过迭代简化机器人运动轨迹识别关键帧；2) 用DiT模型从文本任务描述生成关键帧；3) 用轻量插值器重建中间帧

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，相比逐帧生成基线实现了5.68倍加速，关键帧聚焦方法显著提升了生成视频的物理有效性，特别是在复杂任务上。

Conclusion: 该方法为在实时机器人控制和其他需要高效有效世界模型的领域中部署世界模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations

*William Barron,Xiaoxiang Dong,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出CrossInstruct框架，通过跨模态指令（如文本标签）而非物理动作演示来教导机器人行为，结合基础视觉语言模型和精细指向模型生成3D运动轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人教学需要物理演示，数据收集困难且难以扩展，需要更便捷的指令方式。

Method: 使用跨模态指令作为上下文输入基础VLM，通过迭代查询小模型合成多视角2D运动，融合为3D轨迹分布，结合下游强化学习优化策略。

Result: 在基准仿真和真实硬件上验证有效，无需额外微调，为强化学习提供良好初始化。

Conclusion: CrossInstruct实现了基于指令的机器人行为生成，能泛化到有限示例之外的环境，为机器人学习提供新范式。

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: ReasonNav是一个模块化导航系统，利用视觉语言模型的推理能力整合人类导航技能，在大型复杂建筑中实现高效导航


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人导航系统缺乏人类导航行为（如阅读标志、询问方向），导致在大型环境中导航效率低下

Method: 设计基于导航地标的紧凑输入输出抽象，让视觉语言模型专注于语言理解和推理

Result: 在真实和模拟导航任务中评估，代理成功运用高阶推理在大型复杂建筑中高效导航

Conclusion: ReasonNav通过整合人类导航行为，显著提升了机器人在大型环境中的导航效率

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有癌症筛查技术昂贵且侵入性强，全球普及度低，导致许多本可挽救的生命流失。需要开发基于常规医疗记录的预筛查方法。

Method: 基于数百万电子健康记录，建立医疗代码序列预训练的基础模型缩放规律，预训练计算最优的24亿参数基础模型，并在临床医生策划的癌症风险预测队列上进行微调。

Result: 在3万患者评估中，CATCH-FM达到60%敏感性和99%特异性及阴性预测值，大幅优于基于特征的树模型和通用/医疗大语言模型。在EHRSHOT少样本排行榜上实现胰腺癌风险预测最先进性能。

Conclusion: CATCH-FM在不同患者分布中表现稳健，在ICD代码空间操作具有优势，能够捕捉非平凡的癌症风险因素，代码将开源。

Abstract: Cancer screening, leading to early detection, saves lives. Unfortunately,
existing screening techniques require expensive and intrusive medical
procedures, not globally available, resulting in too many lost would-be-saved
lives. We present CATCH-FM, CATch Cancer early with Healthcare Foundation
Models, a cancer pre-screening methodology that identifies high-risk patients
for further screening solely based on their historical medical records. With
millions of electronic healthcare records (EHR), we establish the scaling law
of EHR foundation models pretrained on medical code sequences, pretrain
compute-optimal foundation models of up to 2.4 billion parameters, and finetune
them on clinician-curated cancer risk prediction cohorts. In our retrospective
evaluation comprising of thirty thousand patients, CATCH-FM achieved strong
efficacy (60% sensitivity) with low risk (99% specificity and Negative
Predictive Value), outperforming feature-based tree models as well as general
and medical large language models by large margins. Despite significant
demographic, healthcare system, and EHR coding differences, CATCH-FM achieves
state-of-the-art pancreatic cancer risk prediction on the EHRSHOT few-shot
leaderboard, outperforming EHR foundation models pretrained using on-site
patient data. Our analysis demonstrates the robustness of CATCH-FM in various
patient distributions, the benefits of operating in the ICD code space, and its
ability to capture non-trivial cancer risk factors. Our code will be

TL;DR: 研究发现联邦学习框架下训练的大型语言模型仍存在隐私泄露风险，攻击者可以从全局模型中提取训练数据，且模型规模越大泄露越严重。论文提出了增强攻击策略并评估了多种隐私保护技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织间希望通过联邦学习协作微调LLM但担心隐私泄露，虽然传统观点认为FL能保护隐私，但本文通过实验发现FL框架下的LLM仍存在数据泄露风险。

Method: 通过大量实验验证FL框架下LLM的隐私泄露问题，包括使用简单生成方法和专门设计的增强攻击策略来跟踪全局模型更新，并评估了差分隐私、正则化约束更新和安全对齐LLM等保护技术。

Result: 实验表明攻击者可以从FL训练的全局模型中提取训练数据，泄露程度随模型规模增大而增加，增强攻击策略能进一步加剧隐私泄露。

Conclusion: FL框架下的LLM训练仍存在显著隐私风险，需要采用适当的隐私保护技术来降低风险，论文为FL训练LLM提供了实用的隐私保护指南。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with local data is a widely adopted
approach for organizations seeking to adapt LLMs to their specific domains.
Given the shared characteristics in data across different organizations, the
idea of collaboratively fine-tuning an LLM using data from multiple sources
presents an appealing opportunity. However, organizations are often reluctant
to share local data, making centralized fine-tuning impractical. Federated
learning (FL), a privacy-preserving framework, enables clients to retain local
data while sharing only model parameters for collaborative training, offering a
potential solution. While fine-tuning LLMs on centralized datasets risks data
leakage through next-token prediction, the iterative aggregation process in FL
results in a global model that encapsulates generalized knowledge, which some
believe protects client privacy. In this paper, however, we present
contradictory findings through extensive experiments. We show that attackers
can still extract training data from the global model, even using
straightforward generation methods, with leakage increasing as the model size
grows. Moreover, we introduce an enhanced attack strategy tailored to FL, which
tracks global model updates during training to intensify privacy leakage. To
mitigate these risks, we evaluate privacy-preserving techniques in FL,
including differential privacy, regularization-constrained updates and adopting
LLMs with safety alignment. Our results provide valuable insights and practical
guidelines for reducing privacy risks when training LLMs with FL.

TL;DR: 提出CE-GPPO算法，通过保留被裁剪token的梯度信号来更好地控制策略熵，在数学推理任务上优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PPO方法由于裁剪机制丢弃了低概率token的梯度信号，而这些信号对调节熵动态有重要作用

Method: CE-GPPO算法温和且有界地重新引入被裁剪token的梯度，通过控制裁剪区间外token的梯度幅度来实现探索-利用平衡

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，CE-GPPO在不同模型规模下均优于强基线方法

Conclusion: CE-GPPO能有效缓解熵不稳定性，为强化学习优化大语言模型提供了更好的熵控制方法

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing
large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core
challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the
balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods,
such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable
gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We
systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped
tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We
propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via
\textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization
(CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in
native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of
gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve
an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and
empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy
instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show
that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model
scales.

TL;DR: StyleBench是一个系统性评估不同推理风格的基准测试，分析了5种推理风格在15个开源模型上的表现，发现没有单一最优风格，策略效果取决于模型规模和任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的性能受推理策略影响很大，但推理风格、模型架构和任务类型之间的相互作用仍不清楚，需要系统性评估。

Method: 引入StyleBench基准，评估5种代表性推理风格（CoT、ToT、AoT、SoT、CoD）在5个推理任务上，使用15个开源模型（270M-120B参数）。

Result: 搜索类方法（AoT、ToT）在开放性问题中表现优异但需要大规模模型，简洁风格（SoT、CoD）在定义明确任务上效率更高；小模型常无法遵循输出指令而猜测，推理鲁棒性随规模增长。

Conclusion: 没有通用最优推理风格，策略选择应基于具体约束条件；为基于约束选择最优推理策略提供了重要路线图。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is heavily influenced by
the reasoning strategies, or styles of thought, employed in their prompts.
However, the interplay between these reasoning styles, model architecture, and
task type remains poorly understood. To address this, we introduce StyleBench,
a comprehensive benchmark for systematically evaluating reasoning styles across
diverse tasks and models. We assess five representative reasoning styles,
including Chain of Thought (CoT), Tree of Thought (ToT), Algorithm of Thought
(AoT), Sketch of Thought (SoT), and Chain-of-Draft (CoD) on five reasoning
tasks, using 15 open-source models from major families (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral,
Gemma, GPT-OSS, Phi, and DeepSeek) ranging from 270M to 120B parameters. Our
large-scale analysis reveals that no single style is universally optimal. We
demonstrate that strategy efficacy is highly contingent on both model scale and
task type: search-based methods (AoT, ToT) excel in open-ended problems but
require large-scale models, while concise styles (SoT, CoD) achieve radical
efficiency gains on well-defined tasks. Furthermore, we identify key behavioral
patterns: smaller models frequently fail to follow output instructions and
default to guessing, while reasoning robustness emerges as a function of scale.
Our findings offer a crucial roadmap for selecting optimal reasoning strategies
based on specific constraints, we open source the benchmark in
https://github.com/JamesJunyuGuo/Style_Bench.

TL;DR: CLUE框架通过电路发现技术识别LLM中负责遗忘和保留的神经元电路，使用CNF形式化表示，为不同类别神经元提供针对性微调策略，实现更精确的遗忘效果和保留能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于定位的方法无法区分负责遗忘不良知识和保留必要技能的神经元，将它们视为单一纠缠组，导致统一干预风险，可能造成灾难性过度遗忘或目标知识不完全擦除。

Method: 采用机制解释性技术电路发现，提出CLUE框架，识别遗忘和保留电路，将其转换为合取范式(CNF)，根据CNF可满足性解中神经元的分配确定其应遗忘或保留，并为不同类别神经元提供针对性微调策略。

Result: 大量实验表明，与现有定位方法相比，CLUE通过精确的神经定位实现了优越的遗忘效果和保留效用。

Conclusion: CLUE框架能够有效解决LLM遗忘中的神经元纠缠问题，通过精确的电路识别和针对性干预策略，在保持模型能力的同时实现目标知识的有效擦除。

Abstract: The LLM unlearning aims to eliminate the influence of undesirable data
without affecting causally unrelated information. This process typically
involves using a forget set to remove target information, alongside a retain
set to maintain non-target capabilities. While recent localization-based
methods demonstrate promise in identifying important neurons to be unlearned,
they fail to disentangle neurons responsible for forgetting undesirable
knowledge or retaining essential skills, often treating them as a single
entangled group. As a result, these methods apply uniform interventions,
risking catastrophic over-forgetting or incomplete erasure of the target
knowledge. To address this, we turn to circuit discovery, a mechanistic
interpretability technique, and propose the Conflict-guided Localization for
LLM Unlearning framEwork (CLUE). This framework identifies the forget and
retain circuit composed of important neurons, and then the circuits are
transformed into conjunctive normal forms (CNF). The assignment of each neuron
in the CNF satisfiability solution reveals whether it should be forgotten or
retained. We then provide targeted fine-tuning strategies for different
categories of neurons. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to
existing localization methods, CLUE achieves superior forget efficacy and
retain utility through precise neural localization.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖自编码器但缺乏全局稀疏性保证，导致大量密集特征，损害了特征的稀疏性和原子化。

Method: 提出BAE，通过离散化隐藏激活为1位并使用梯度估计进行反向传播，在小批量上强制最小熵约束。

Result: BAE在特征提取中避免了密集特征，产生了最多的可解释特征，并能可靠估计特征集熵来分析LLM推理动态。

Conclusion: BAE作为特征提取器有效提升了特征稀疏性和可解释性，在特征解缠和熵分析方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Existing works are dedicated to untangling atomized numerical components
(features) from the hidden states of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
interpreting their mechanism. However, they typically rely on autoencoders
constrained by some implicit training-time regularization on single training
instances (i.e., $L_1$ normalization, top-k function, etc.), without an
explicit guarantee of global sparsity among instances, causing a large amount
of dense (simultaneously inactive) features, harming the feature sparsity and
atomization. In this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder variant that
enforces minimal entropy on minibatches of hidden activations, thereby
promoting feature independence and sparsity across instances. For efficient
entropy calculation, we discretize the hidden activations to 1-bit via a step
function and apply gradient estimation to enable backpropagation, so that we
term it as Binary Autoencoder (BAE) and empirically demonstrate two major
applications: (1) Feature set entropy calculation. Entropy can be reliably
estimated on binary hidden activations, which we empirically evaluate and
leverage to characterize the inference dynamics of LLMs and In-context
Learning. (2) Feature untangling. Similar to typical methods, BAE can extract
atomized features from LLM's hidden states. To robustly evaluate such feature
extraction capability, we refine traditional feature-interpretation methods to
avoid unreliable handling of numerical tokens, and show that BAE avoids dense
features while producing the largest number of interpretable ones among
baselines, which confirms the effectiveness of BAE serving as a feature
extractor.

TL;DR: 本文通过信息移除的视角揭示了上下文学习(ICL)的内在机制，发现ICL通过选择性移除隐藏状态中的冗余信息来引导语言模型专注于目标任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索上下文学习(ICL)的内在工作机制，虽然ICL已成为基于现代语言模型的少样本学习范式，但其内部机制仍不清楚。

Method: 采用信息移除的新视角，通过设计低秩滤波器选择性移除隐藏状态中的特定信息，并测量隐藏状态在精心设计的指标上的表现。

Result: 发现零样本场景下语言模型编码查询为非选择性表示，而少样本ICL有效模拟任务导向的信息移除过程；识别出诱导移除操作的关键注意力头(去噪头)。

Conclusion: 信息移除机制是ICL的关键机制，去噪头在其中发挥关键作用，阻断信息移除操作会显著降低ICL准确性。

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is an emerging few-shot learning paradigm based on
modern Language Models (LMs), yet its inner mechanism remains unclear. In this
paper, we investigate the mechanism through a novel perspective of information
removal. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the zero-shot scenario, LMs
encode queries into non-selective representations in hidden states containing
information for all possible tasks, leading to arbitrary outputs without
focusing on the intended task, resulting in near-zero accuracy. Meanwhile, we
find that selectively removing specific information from hidden states by a
low-rank filter effectively steers LMs toward the intended task. Building on
these findings, by measuring the hidden states on carefully designed metrics,
we observe that few-shot ICL effectively simulates such task-oriented
information removal processes, selectively removing the redundant information
from entangled non-selective representations, and improving the output based on
the demonstrations, which constitutes a key mechanism underlying ICL. Moreover,
we identify essential attention heads inducing the removal operation, termed
Denoising Heads, which enables the ablation experiments blocking the
information removal operation from the inference, where the ICL accuracy
significantly degrades, especially when the correct label is absent from the
few-shot demonstrations, confirming both the critical role of the information
removal mechanism and denoising heads.

Motivation: 探讨LLM是否能够通过强化学习获得真正新的推理策略，而不仅仅是预训练中已编码的技能，解决现有编码数据集无法隔离推理技能的问题。

Method: 使用模板化问题生成器创建合成编程问题家族，通过强化学习训练模型，采用阶段性预热、经验回放、课程训练和验证循环等关键技术。

Result: 发现明显的顿悟相变现象：在长期零奖励后模型突然达到接近完美的准确率；在家族内部和重组技能上表现良好，但在转换性案例中存在持续弱点。

Conclusion: DELTA提供了一个清晰的测试平台，用于探索RL驱动推理的极限，理解模型如何超越现有先验获得新的算法技能。

Abstract: It remains an open question whether LLMs can acquire or generalize genuinely
new reasoning strategies, beyond the sharpened skills encoded in their
parameters during pre-training or post-training. To attempt to answer this
debate, we introduce DELTA-Code--Distributional Evaluation of Learnability and
Transferrability in Algorithmic Coding, a controlled benchmark of synthetic
coding problem families designed to probe two fundamental aspects: learnability
-- can LLMs, through reinforcement learning (RL), solve problem families where
pretrained models exhibit failure with large enough attempts (pass@K=0)? --and
transferrability -- if learnability happens, can such skills transfer
systematically to out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets? Unlike prior public
coding datasets, DELTA isolates reasoning skills through templated problem
generators and introduces fully OOD problem families that demand novel
strategies rather than tool invocation or memorized patterns. Our experiments
reveal a striking grokking phase transition: after an extended period with
near-zero reward, RL-trained models abruptly climb to near-perfect accuracy. To
enable learnability on previously unsolvable problem families, we explore key
training ingredients such as staged warm-up with dense rewards, experience
replay, curriculum training, and verification-in-the-loop. Beyond learnability,
we use DELTA to evaluate transferability or generalization along exploratory,
compositional, and transformative axes, as well as cross-family transfer.
Results show solid gains within families and for recomposed skills, but
persistent weaknesses in transformative cases. DELTA thus offers a clean
testbed for probing the limits of RL-driven reasoning and for understanding how
models can move beyond existing priors to acquire new algorithmic skills.

Motivation: 现有方法在扩展困难数学问题生成方面面临计算成本高、提示复杂和生成问题难度有限等挑战。

Method: 使用自适应思维模型单次前向传播识别现有数据集中的难题，然后训练专门的难题生成器(DiffGen-8B)来大规模生成新难题。

Result: 在ScaleDiff-Math数据集上微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct，性能提升11.3%，在多个数学基准测试上达到65.9%平均准确率，优于OpenThinker3等模型。

Conclusion: ScaleDiff管道能有效转移高级推理能力，无需依赖更大更昂贵的教师模型，且随着困难问题数量增加，模型性能呈现明显扩展现象。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in complex
problem-solving, often benefiting from training on difficult mathematical
problems that stimulate intricate reasoning. Recent efforts have explored
automated synthesis of mathematical problems by prompting proprietary models or
large-scale open-source models from seed data or inherent mathematical
concepts. However, scaling up these methods remains challenging due to their
high computational/API cost, complexity of prompting, and limited difficulty
level of the generated problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose
ScaleDiff, a simple yet effective pipeline designed to scale the creation of
difficult problems. We efficiently identify difficult problems from existing
datasets with only a single forward pass using an adaptive thinking model,
which can perceive problem difficulty and automatically switch between
"Thinking" and "NoThinking" modes. We then train a specialized difficult
problem generator (DiffGen-8B) on this filtered difficult data, which can
produce new difficult problems in large scale, eliminating the need for
complex, per-instance prompting and its associated high API costs. Fine-tuning
Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct on the ScaleDiff-Math dataset yields a substantial
performance increase of 11.3% compared to the original dataset and achieves a
65.9% average accuracy on AIME'24, AIME'25, HMMT-Feb'25, BRUMO'25, and MATH500,
outperforming recent strong LRMs like OpenThinker3. Notably, this performance
is achieved using the cost-efficient Qwen3-8B model as a teacher, demonstrating
that our pipeline can effectively transfer advanced reasoning capabilities
without relying on larger, more expensive teacher models. Furthermore, we
observe a clear scaling phenomenon in model performance on difficult benchmarks
as the quantity of difficult problems increases. Code:

TL;DR: DARTVAE是一个基于规则指导的多模态聚类框架，通过将领域特定约束直接嵌入表示学习过程，结合VAE架构、显式规则和语义表示，生成更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类方法仅依赖输入数据的相似性，难以捕捉许多领域中关键的结构或语义约束。需要开发能够直接融入领域特定约束的聚类方法。

Method: 扩展VAE架构，嵌入显式规则、语义表示和数据驱动特征到统一潜在空间，通过损失函数中的规则一致性和违反惩罚来强制约束合规。规则由LLM生成并构建为知识图谱。

Result: 在飞机和汽车数据集上的实验表明，规则指导的聚类产生了更具操作意义和可解释性的聚类结果（如分离无人机、统一隐形飞机、区分SUV和轿车），同时改进了传统聚类指标。

Conclusion: DARTVAE通过结合规则编码和学习表示，比纯数据驱动模型实现了更有意义和一致的聚类结果，突显了约束指导多模态聚类在复杂知识密集型场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Traditional clustering techniques often rely solely on similarity in the
input data, limiting their ability to capture structural or semantic
constraints that are critical in many domains. We introduce the Domain Aware
Rule Triggered Variational Autoencoder (DARTVAE), a rule guided multimodal
clustering framework that incorporates domain specific constraints directly
into the representation learning process. DARTVAE extends the VAE architecture
by embedding explicit rules, semantic representations, and data driven features
into a unified latent space, while enforcing constraint compliance through rule
consistency and violation penalties in the loss function. Unlike conventional
clustering methods that rely only on visual similarity or apply rules as post
hoc filters, DARTVAE treats rules as first class learning signals. The rules
are generated by LLMs, structured into knowledge graphs, and enforced through a
loss function combining reconstruction, KL divergence, consistency, and
violation penalties. Experiments on aircraft and automotive datasets
demonstrate that rule guided clustering produces more operationally meaningful
and interpretable clusters for example, isolating UAVs, unifying stealth
aircraft, or separating SUVs from sedans while improving traditional clustering
metrics. However, the framework faces challenges: LLM generated rules may
hallucinate or conflict, excessive rules risk overfitting, and scaling to
complex domains increases computational and consistency difficulties. By
combining rule encodings with learned representations, DARTVAE achieves more
meaningful and consistent clustering outcomes than purely data driven models,
highlighting the utility of constraint guided multimodal clustering for
complex, knowledge intensive settings.

Motivation: 传统最优传输方法在对称性丰富的场景中，仅基于原始特征的成对几何距离进行对齐，可能会忽略数据的内在相干结构。需要一种能够感知对称性的扩展方法。

Method: 引入Bispectral Optimal Transport，这是离散最优传输的对称性感知扩展，使用双谱表示来比较元素。双谱是一种群傅里叶不变量，能保留所有信号结构，同时消除由群作用引起的变异。

Result: 在经视觉对称性变换的基准数据集上，Bispectral OT计算的传输计划比原始特征OT实现了更高的类别保持准确性，改善了有意义的对应关系的质量。

Conclusion: Bispectral OT能够捕获数据集中潜在的语义标签结构，同时消除不影响类别或内容的干扰变异，为对称性丰富的场景提供了更有效的对齐方法。

Abstract: Optimal transport (OT) is a widely used technique in machine learning,
graphics, and vision that aligns two distributions or datasets using their
relative geometry. In symmetry-rich settings, however, OT alignments based
solely on pairwise geometric distances between raw features can ignore the
intrinsic coherence structure of the data. We introduce Bispectral Optimal
Transport, a symmetry-aware extension of discrete OT that compares elements
using their representation using the bispectrum, a group Fourier invariant that
preserves all signal structure while removing only the variation due to group
actions. Empirically, we demonstrate that the transport plans computed with
Bispectral OT achieve greater class preservation accuracy than naive feature OT
on benchmark datasets transformed with visual symmetries, improving the quality
of meaningful correspondences that capture the underlying semantic label
structure in the dataset while removing nuisance variation not affecting class
or content.

TL;DR: 提出了首个公平增强的无数据鲁棒性蒸馏框架FERD，通过调整对抗样本的比例和分布来解决鲁棒公平性问题，显著提升了最差类别鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无数据鲁棒性蒸馏方法只关注整体鲁棒性，忽视了不同类别间的鲁棒公平性问题，导致不同类别的鲁棒性存在严重差异。

Method: FERD采用鲁棒性引导的类别重加权策略调整样本比例，为鲁棒性较差的类别合成更多样本；同时生成公平感知样本和统一目标对抗样本，通过特征级预测均匀性约束和统一目标类别约束来平衡表示和攻击目标。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，FERD在所有对抗攻击下都达到了最先进的最差类别鲁棒性，例如在CIFAR-10上使用MobileNet-V2时，FGSM和AutoAttack下的最差类别鲁棒性分别提升了15.1%和6.4%。

Conclusion: FERD框架在鲁棒性和公平性方面都表现出优越性能，有效解决了无数据鲁棒性蒸馏中的公平性问题。

Abstract: Data-Free Robustness Distillation (DFRD) aims to transfer the robustness from
the teacher to the student without accessing the training data. While existing
methods focus on overall robustness, they overlook the robust fairness issues,
leading to severe disparity of robustness across different categories. In this
paper, we find two key problems: (1) student model distilled with equal class
proportion data behaves significantly different across distinct categories; and
(2) the robustness of student model is not stable across different attacks
target. To bridge these gaps, we present the first Fairness-Enhanced data-free
Robustness Distillation (FERD) framework to adjust the proportion and
distribution of adversarial examples. For the proportion, FERD adopts a
robustness-guided class reweighting strategy to synthesize more samples for the
less robust categories, thereby improving robustness of them. For the
distribution, FERD generates complementary data samples for advanced robustness
distillation. It generates Fairness-Aware Examples (FAEs) by enforcing a
uniformity constraint on feature-level predictions, which suppress the
dominance of class-specific non-robust features, providing a more balanced
representation across all categories. Then, FERD constructs Uniform-Target
Adversarial Examples (UTAEs) from FAEs by applying a uniform target class
constraint to avoid biased attack directions, which distribute the attack
targets across all categories and prevents overfitting to specific vulnerable
categories. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that FERD
achieves state-of-the-art worst-class robustness under all adversarial attack
(e.g., the worst-class robustness under FGSM and AutoAttack are improved by
15.1\% and 6.4\% using MobileNet-V2 on CIFAR-10), demonstrating superior
performance in both robustness and fairness aspects.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了CaTS-Bench，首个大规模、真实世界的情境感知时间序列字幕基准，包含465k训练和105k测试时间戳，结合数值序列、元数据、线图和字幕，并引入新的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列字幕基准依赖合成数据或过于简化的字幕，通常忽略元数据和视觉表示，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 从11个多样化数据集重构为字幕和问答任务，使用可扩展的流水线生成参考字幕，包括LLM生成和人工修订，并提供460个多选题。

Result: 建立了可靠的基准和字幕流水线，对领先的视觉语言模型进行基准测试，揭示了其优势和局限性。

Conclusion: CaTS-Bench及其字幕流水线为时间序列分析与基础模型交叉研究的未来提供了可靠且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.

TL;DR: 提出基于掩码变换器自编码器的方法来重建缺失的胎儿心率信号，该方法能捕捉数据的空间和频率特征，适用于信号修复和预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约10%的新生儿需要呼吸辅助，5%需要通气支持。胎儿心率监测对评估胎儿健康至关重要，但可穿戴设备在孕妇运动时容易出现信号丢失，传统插值方法无法保持信号频谱特征。

Method: 使用掩码变换器自编码器方法，通过捕捉数据的空间和频率分量来重建缺失的胎儿心率信号。

Result: 该方法对不同缺失时长的数据都表现出鲁棒性，可用于信号修复和预测。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于回顾性研究数据集，支持AI风险算法开发，未来可集成到可穿戴胎儿心率监测设备中，实现更早、更稳健的风险检测。

Abstract: Approximately 10\% of newborns require assistance to initiate breathing at
birth, and around 5\% need ventilation support. Fetal heart rate (FHR)
monitoring plays a crucial role in assessing fetal well-being during prenatal
care, enabling the detection of abnormal patterns and supporting timely
obstetric interventions to mitigate fetal risks during labor. Applying
artificial intelligence (AI) methods to analyze large datasets of continuous
FHR monitoring episodes with diverse outcomes may offer novel insights into
predicting the risk of needing breathing assistance or interventions. Recent
advances in wearable FHR monitors have enabled continuous fetal monitoring
without compromising maternal mobility. However, sensor displacement during
maternal movement, as well as changes in fetal or maternal position, often lead
to signal dropouts, resulting in gaps in the recorded FHR data. Such missing
data limits the extraction of meaningful insights and complicates automated
(AI-based) analysis. Traditional approaches to handle missing data, such as
simple interpolation techniques, often fail to preserve the spectral
characteristics of the signals. In this paper, we propose a masked
transformer-based autoencoder approach to reconstruct missing FHR signals by
capturing both spatial and frequency components of the data. The proposed
method demonstrates robustness across varying durations of missing data and can
be used for signal inpainting and forecasting. The proposed approach can be
applied retrospectively to research datasets to support the development of
AI-based risk algorithms. In the future, the proposed method could be
integrated into wearable FHR monitoring devices to achieve earlier and more
robust risk detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在图像分类任务中表现出色但容易受到精心设计的对抗性扰动攻击，需要寻找简单有效的数据自适应防御方法。

Method: 使用稀疏主成分分析(SPCA)作为前端特征提取器，结合线性分类头进行理论分析，并通过实验比较SPCA与标准PCA在对抗性攻击下的表现。

Result: 理论分析显示SPCA能提供更好的鲁棒性保证，实验结果表明SPCA在白盒和黑盒攻击下比PCA表现更好，同时保持相当的清洁准确率。

Conclusion: 稀疏投影通过减少对抗性杠杆来提升模型鲁棒性，这一机制在理论和实验中都得到了验证，SPCA是一种有效的对抗性防御方法。

Abstract: Deep neural networks perform remarkably well on image classification tasks
but remain vulnerable to carefully crafted adversarial perturbations. This work
revisits linear dimensionality reduction as a simple, data-adapted defense. We
empirically compare standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with its sparse
variant (SPCA) as front-end feature extractors for downstream classifiers, and
we complement these experiments with a theoretical analysis. On the theory
side, we derive exact robustness certificates for linear heads applied to SPCA
features: for both $\ell_\infty$ and $\ell_2$ threat models (binary and
multiclass), the certified radius grows as the dual norms of $W^\top u$ shrink,
where $W$ is the projection and $u$ the head weights. We further show that for
general (non-linear) heads, sparsity reduces operator-norm bounds through a
Lipschitz composition argument, predicting lower input sensitivity.
Empirically, with a small non-linear network after the projection, SPCA
consistently degrades more gracefully than PCA under strong white-box and
black-box attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy. Taken together,
the theory identifies the mechanism (sparser projections reduce adversarial
leverage) and the experiments verify that this benefit persists beyond the
linear setting. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型的遗忘方法主要依赖MSE损失，但这种方法只是f-散度框架的一个特例，需要更灵活的遗忘框架来平衡遗忘效果和概念保留

Method: 建立基于f-散度的统一遗忘框架，分析不同f-散度对算法收敛性和遗忘质量的影响，允许根据具体应用选择最优散度

Result: 证明了MSE方法是统一框架的特殊情况，不同f-散度在遗忘攻击性和概念保留之间提供不同权衡

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架为机器遗忘提供了灵活范式，能够根据具体需求选择最优散度来平衡遗忘效果和模型性能

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge from a trained model.
While diffusion models (DMs) have shown remarkable generative capabilities,
existing unlearning methods for text-to-image (T2I) models often rely on
minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the output distribution of a
target and an anchor concept. We show that this MSE-based approach is a special
case of a unified $f$-divergence-based framework, in which any $f$-divergence
can be utilized. We analyze the benefits of using different $f$-divergences,
that mainly impact the convergence properties of the algorithm and the quality
of unlearning. The proposed unified framework offers a flexible paradigm that
allows to select the optimal divergence for a specific application, balancing
different trade-offs between aggressive unlearning and concept preservation.

Abstract: Accurately forecasting the long-term evolution of turbulence represents a
grand challenge in scientific computing and is crucial for applications ranging
from climate modeling to aerospace engineering. Existing deep learning methods,
particularly neural operators, often fail in long-term autoregressive
predictions, suffering from catastrophic error accumulation and a loss of
physical fidelity. This failure stems from their inability to simultaneously
capture the distinct mathematical structures that govern turbulent dynamics:
local, dissipative effects and global, non-local interactions. In this paper,
we propose the
{\textbf{\underline{D}}}ifferential-{\textbf{\underline{I}}}ntegral
{\textbf{\underline{N}}}eural {\textbf{\underline{O}}}perator (\method{}), a
novel framework designed from a first-principles approach of operator
decomposition. \method{} explicitly models the turbulent evolution through
parallel branches that learn distinct physical operators: a local differential
operator, realized by a constrained convolutional network that provably
converges to a derivative, and a global integral operator, captured by a
Transformer architecture that learns a data-driven global kernel. This
physics-based decomposition endows \method{} with exceptional stability and
robustness. Through extensive experiments on the challenging 2D Kolmogorov flow
benchmark, we demonstrate that \method{} significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models in long-term forecasting. It successfully suppresses
error accumulation over hundreds of timesteps, maintains high fidelity in both
the vorticity fields and energy spectra, and establishes a new benchmark for
physically consistent, long-range turbulence forecast.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台已成为健康建议的重要来源，其中混杂着有用、误导和有害内容。研究旨在理解可信度如何通过这些平台被包装和呈现，而非判断内容真伪。

Method: 收集了152个来自TikTok、Instagram和YouTube的公开视频，通过26个特征进行标注，包括视觉权威、主持人属性、叙事策略和参与度提示。采用自动语音识别、框架选择和多模态模型的透明标注流程，并进行人工验证。

Result: 发现自信的单一主持人在工作室或家庭环境中占主导地位，临床环境罕见。权威线索（如头衔、幻灯片、证书）常与说服性元素（行话、引用、恐惧或紧迫感、批评主流医学、阴谋论）以及盈利模式（销售链接、订阅呼吁）同时出现。

Conclusion: 引用和科学化视觉元素往往与情感化和对立性叙事相伴，而非体现克制。这表明可信度包装在短视频平台中呈现出复杂的混合特征。

Abstract: Short form video platforms are central sites for health advice, where
alternative narratives mix useful, misleading, and harmful content. Rather than
adjudicating truth, this study examines how credibility is packaged in
nutrition and supplement videos by analyzing the intersection of authority
signals, narrative techniques, and monetization. We assemble a cross platform
corpus of 152 public videos from TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube and annotate
each on 26 features spanning visual authority, presenter attributes, narrative
strategies, and engagement cues. A transparent annotation pipeline integrates
automatic speech recognition, principled frame selection, and a multimodal
model, with human verification on a stratified subsample showing strong
agreement. Descriptively, a confident single presenter in studio or home
settings dominates, and clinical contexts are rare. Analytically, authority
cues such as titles, slides and charts, and certificates frequently occur with
persuasive elements including jargon, references, fear or urgency, critiques of
mainstream medicine, and conspiracies, and with monetization including sales
links and calls to subscribe. References and science like visuals often travel
with emotive and oppositional narratives rather than signaling restraint.

Motivation: 随着具身AI的发展，需要既视觉逼真又物理合理且功能多样的3D环境。现有方法受限于固定场景类别，缺乏足够的物体级细节和物理一致性，难以处理复杂用户指令。

Method: 采用基于语言模型的规划器从可扩展的场景生成工具套件中选择工具，包括数据驱动的生成模型、视觉和基于LLM的方法，通过自我评估物理合理性、视觉真实性和语义对齐来指导迭代优化。

Conclusion: SceneWeaver通过闭环的推理-行动-反思设计实现了通用3D环境生成的重要进展，能够识别语义不一致性、调用针对性工具并在连续迭代中更新环境。

Abstract: Indoor scene synthesis has become increasingly important with the rise of
Embodied AI, which requires 3D environments that are not only visually
realistic but also physically plausible and functionally diverse. While recent
approaches have advanced visual fidelity, they often remain constrained to
fixed scene categories, lack sufficient object-level detail and physical
consistency, and struggle to align with complex user instructions. In this
work, we present SceneWeaver, a reflective agentic framework that unifies
diverse scene synthesis paradigms through tool-based iterative refinement. At
its core, SceneWeaver employs a language model-based planner to select from a
suite of extensible scene generation tools, ranging from data-driven generative
models to visual- and LLM-based methods, guided by self-evaluation of physical
plausibility, visual realism, and semantic alignment with user input. This
closed-loop reason-act-reflect design enables the agent to identify semantic
inconsistencies, invoke targeted tools, and update the environment over
successive iterations. Extensive experiments on both common and open-vocabulary
room types demonstrate that SceneWeaver not only outperforms prior methods on
physical, visual, and semantic metrics, but also generalizes effectively to
complex scenes with diverse instructions, marking a step toward general-purpose
3D environment generation. Project website: https://scene-weaver.github.io/.

Motivation: 现有UV展开方法存在耗时、碎片化、缺乏语义性和不规则UV岛等问题，限制了实际应用。需要满足无重叠映射、最小扭曲等基本标准，同时保持清晰边界、高效空间利用和语义一致性等高级标准

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 使用SeamGPT预测语义切割缝线；2) 将基于优化方法的粗糙UV和网格输入自编码器，精炼为艺术家风格UV贴图

Result: ArtUV在多个基准测试中表现出色，确保语义一致性和拓扑结构保持，使UV贴图可直接用于2D编辑

Conclusion: ArtUV作为多功能解决方案，既可作为专业渲染工具的插件，也可作为独立系统用于快速高质量UV生成

Abstract: UV unwrapping is an essential task in computer graphics, enabling various
visual editing operations in rendering pipelines. However, existing UV
unwrapping methods struggle with time-consuming, fragmentation, lack of
semanticity, and irregular UV islands, limiting their practical use. An
artist-style UV map must not only satisfy fundamental criteria, such as
overlap-free mapping and minimal distortion, but also uphold higher-level
standards, including clean boundaries, efficient space utilization, and
semantic coherence. We introduce ArtUV, a fully automated, end-to-end method
for generating artist-style UV unwrapping. We simulates the professional UV
mapping process by dividing it into two stages: surface seam prediction and
artist-style UV parameterization. In the seam prediction stage, SeamGPT is used
to generate semantically meaningful cutting seams. Then, in the
parameterization stage, a rough UV obtained from an optimization-based method,
along with the mesh, is fed into an Auto-Encoder, which refines it into an
artist-style UV map. Our method ensures semantic consistency and preserves
topological structure, making the UV map ready for 2D editing. We evaluate
ArtUV across multiple benchmarks and show that it serves as a versatile
solution, functioning seamlessly as either a plug-in for professional rendering
tools or as a standalone system for rapid, high-quality UV generation.

Conclusion: SeamCrafter通过创新的架构设计和优化策略，成功解决了网格接缝生成中失真与碎片化的权衡问题，为3D表面参数化提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Mesh seams play a pivotal role in partitioning 3D surfaces for UV
parametrization and texture mapping. Poorly placed seams often result in severe
UV distortion or excessive fragmentation, thereby hindering texture synthesis
and disrupting artist workflows. Existing methods frequently trade one failure
mode for another-producing either high distortion or many scattered islands. To
address this, we introduce SeamCrafter, an autoregressive GPT-style seam
generator conditioned on point cloud inputs. SeamCrafter employs a dual-branch
point-cloud encoder that disentangles and captures complementary topological
and geometric cues during pretraining. To further enhance seam quality, we
fine-tune the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on a preference
dataset derived from a novel seam-evaluation framework. This framework assesses
seams primarily by UV distortion and fragmentation, and provides pairwise
preference labels to guide optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
SeamCrafter produces seams with substantially lower distortion and
fragmentation than prior approaches, while preserving topological consistency
and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Directly generating 3D meshes, the default representation for 3D shapes in
the graphics industry, using auto-regressive (AR) models has become popular
these days, thanks to their sharpness, compactness in the generated results,
and ability to represent various types of surfaces. However, AR mesh generative
models typically construct meshes face by face in lexicographic order, which
does not effectively capture the underlying geometry in a manner consistent
with human perception. Inspired by 2D models that progressively refine images,
such as the prevailing next-scale prediction AR models, we propose generating
meshes auto-regressively in a progressive coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically,
we view mesh simplification algorithms, which gradually merge mesh faces to
build simpler meshes, as a natural fine-to-coarse process. Therefore, we
generalize meshes to simplicial complexes and develop a transformer-based AR
model to approximate the reverse process of simplification in the order of
level of detail, constructing meshes initially from a single point and
gradually adding geometric details through local remeshing, where the topology
is not predefined and is alterable. Our experiments show that this novel
progressive mesh generation approach not only provides intuitive control over
generation quality and time consumption by early stopping the auto-regressive
process but also enables applications such as mesh refinement and editing.

Abstract: Architecture embodies aesthetic, cultural, and historical values, standing as
a tangible testament to human civilization. Researchers have long leveraged
virtual reality (VR), mixed reality (MR), and augmented reality (AR) to enable
immersive exploration and interpretation of architecture, enhancing
accessibility, public understanding, and creative workflows around architecture
in education, heritage preservation, and professional design practice. However,
existing VR/MR/AR systems are often developed case-by-case, relying on
hard-coded annotations and task-specific interactions that do not scale across
diverse built environments. In this work, we present ArchGPT, a multimodal
architectural visual question answering (VQA) model, together with a scalable
data-construction pipeline for curating high-quality, architecture-specific VQA
annotations. This pipeline yields Arch-300K, a domain-specialized dataset of
approximately 315,000 image-question-answer triplets. Arch-300K is built via a
multi-stage process: first, we curate architectural scenes from Wikimedia
Commons and filter unconstrained tourist photo collections using a novel
coarse-to-fine strategy that integrates 3D reconstruction and semantic
segmentation to select occlusion-free, structurally consistent architectural
images. To mitigate noise and inconsistency in raw textual metadata, we propose
an LLM-guided text verification and knowledge-distillation pipeline to generate
reliable, architecture-specific question-answer pairs. Using these curated
images and refined metadata, we further synthesize formal analysis
annotations-including detailed descriptions and aspect-guided conversations-to
provide richer semantic variety while remaining faithful to the data. We
perform supervised fine-tuning of an open-source multimodal backbone
,ShareGPT4V-7B, on Arch-300K, yielding ArchGPT.

Abstract: Accurate surface geometry representation is crucial in 3D visual computing.
Explicit representations, such as polygonal meshes, and implicit
representations, like signed distance functions, each have distinct advantages,
making efficient conversions between them increasingly important. Conventional
surface extraction methods for implicit representations, such as the widely
used Marching Cubes algorithm, rely on spatial decomposition and sampling,
leading to inaccuracies due to fixed and limited resolution. We introduce a
novel approach for analytically extracting surfaces from neural implicit
functions. Our method operates natively in parallel and can navigate large
neural architectures. By leveraging the fact that each neuron partitions the
domain, we develop a depth-first traversal strategy to efficiently track the
encoded surface. The resulting meshes faithfully capture the full geometric
information from the network without ad-hoc spatial discretization, achieving
unprecedented accuracy across diverse shapes and network architectures while
maintaining competitive speed.

TL;DR: CHARM是一个用于动漫发型建模的参数化表示和生成框架，通过控制点序列表示发片，使用自回归生成方法从图像或点云生成高质量动漫发型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统发型建模方法主要针对写实头发，而动漫发型具有高度风格化、分段结构化的几何特征，现有技术难以有效处理。现有方法依赖密集网格建模或手工样条曲线，编辑效率低且不适合规模化学习。

Method: 提出紧凑、可逆的控制点参数化表示，每个发片用控制点序列表示，每个点仅用五个几何参数编码。基于此表示构建自回归生成框架，将动漫发型视为序列化的"头发语言"，使用transformer模型捕捉局部几何和全局发型拓扑。

Result: 构建了AnimeHair数据集（包含37K高质量动漫发型），实验表明CHARM在重建精度和生成质量方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: CHARM为动漫发型建模提供了表达力强且可扩展的解决方案，支持艺术家友好设计和基于学习的生成。

Abstract: We present CHARM, a novel parametric representation and generative framework
for anime hairstyle modeling. While traditional hair modeling methods focus on
realistic hair using strand-based or volumetric representations, anime
hairstyle exhibits highly stylized, piecewise-structured geometry that
challenges existing techniques. Existing works often rely on dense mesh
modeling or hand-crafted spline curves, making them inefficient for editing and
unsuitable for scalable learning. CHARM introduces a compact, invertible
control-point-based parameterization, where a sequence of control points
represents each hair card, and each point is encoded with only five geometric
parameters. This efficient and accurate representation supports both
artist-friendly design and learning-based generation. Built upon this
representation, CHARM introduces an autoregressive generative framework that
effectively generates anime hairstyles from input images or point clouds. By
interpreting anime hairstyles as a sequential "hair language", our
autoregressive transformer captures both local geometry and global hairstyle
topology, resulting in high-fidelity anime hairstyle creation. To facilitate
both training and evaluation of anime hairstyle generation, we construct
AnimeHair, a large-scale dataset of 37K high-quality anime hairstyles with
separated hair cards and processed mesh data. Extensive experiments demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance of CHARM in both reconstruction accuracy and
generation quality, offering an expressive and scalable solution for anime
hairstyle modeling. Project page: https://hyzcluster.github.io/charm/

TL;DR: 提出了交互式推荐流(IRF)新范式，通过自然语言命令让用户主动控制推荐策略，解决了传统推荐系统被动反馈机制无法捕捉用户细微行为动机的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖被动反馈机制，只能获取粗粒度的喜欢/不喜欢信号，无法捕捉用户细微的行为动机和意图，也无法识别具体驱动用户满意度的物品属性，导致偏好建模不准确。

Method: 开发了RecBot双智能体架构：解析器智能体将语言表达转化为结构化偏好，规划器智能体动态编排自适应工具链进行实时策略调整；采用模拟增强知识蒸馏实现高效部署。

Result: 通过大量离线和长期在线实验，RecBot在用户满意度和业务成果方面均显示出显著改善。

Conclusion: IRF范式通过自然语言交互实现了用户对推荐策略的主动显式控制，有效弥合了用户意图与系统理解之间的差距，提升了推荐系统的效果。

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems rely on passive feedback mechanisms that
limit users to simple choices such as like and dislike. However, these
coarse-grained signals fail to capture users' nuanced behavior motivations and
intentions. In turn, current systems cannot also distinguish which specific
item attributes drive user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, resulting in
inaccurate preference modeling. These fundamental limitations create a
persistent gap between user intentions and system interpretations, ultimately
undermining user satisfaction and harming system effectiveness.
  To address these limitations, we introduce the Interactive Recommendation
Feed (IRF), a pioneering paradigm that enables natural language commands within
mainstream recommendation feeds. Unlike traditional systems that confine users
to passive implicit behavioral influence, IRF empowers active explicit control
over recommendation policies through real-time linguistic commands. To support
this paradigm, we develop RecBot, a dual-agent architecture where a Parser
Agent transforms linguistic expressions into structured preferences and a
Planner Agent dynamically orchestrates adaptive tool chains for on-the-fly
policy adjustment. To enable practical deployment, we employ
simulation-augmented knowledge distillation to achieve efficient performance
while maintaining strong reasoning capabilities. Through extensive offline and
long-term online experiments, RecBot shows significant improvements in both
user satisfaction and business outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决考古专家在分析文物时需要处理大量比较资料的认知负担问题，提供系统化的溯源分析支持。

Method: 构建双模态知识库，结合文本和图像，使用原始视觉、边缘增强和语义检索识别风格相似文物，通过VLM生成结构化推理。

Result: 在英国博物馆的东亚青铜时代文物上测试，专家评估显示系统能产生有意义且可解释的输出，为学者提供具体分析起点。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效减轻专家处理大量比较资料的认知负担，为考古文物溯源分析提供实用的辅助工具。

Abstract: In this work, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-based system
for provenance analysis of archaeological artifacts, designed to support expert
reasoning by integrating multimodal retrieval and large vision-language models
(VLMs). The system constructs a dual-modal knowledge base from reference texts
and images, enabling raw visual, edge-enhanced, and semantic retrieval to
identify stylistically similar objects. Retrieved candidates are synthesized by
the VLM to generate structured inferences, including chronological,
geographical, and cultural attributions, alongside interpretive justifications.
We evaluate the system on a set of Eastern Eurasian Bronze Age artifacts from
the British Museum. Expert evaluation demonstrates that the system produces
meaningful and interpretable outputs, offering scholars concrete starting
points for analysis and significantly alleviating the cognitive burden of
navigating vast comparative corpora.

TL;DR: 提出了一种条件参数化的全卷积U-Net代理模型，用于加速液态金属脱合金相场模拟，能够大幅超越训练时空范围进行外推预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 液态金属脱合金相场模型虽然能解析丰富的微观结构动力学，但在大域或长时间尺度下计算变得不可行，需要开发高效的代理模型。

Method: 设计集成卷积自注意力和物理感知填充的条件参数化U-Net，通过参数调节实现可变时间步跳跃和适应不同合金系统。

Result: 代理模型在训练范围内相对误差通常低于5%，外推到更大域和更晚时间时误差低于10%，计算加速高达16,000倍。

Conclusion: 该方法标志着向可扩展、高保真液态金属脱合金相场模型外推的早期进展，能将数周模拟缩短至秒级。

Abstract: Phase-field models of liquid metal dealloying (LMD) can resolve rich
microstructural dynamics but become intractable for large domains or long time
horizons. We present a conditionally parameterized, fully convolutional U-Net
surrogate that generalizes far beyond its training window in both space and
time. The design integrates convolutional self-attention and physics-aware
padding, while parameter conditioning enables variable time-step skipping and
adaptation to diverse alloy systems. Although trained only on short,
small-scale simulations, the surrogate exploits the translational invariance of
convolutions to extend predictions to much longer horizons than traditional
solvers. It accurately reproduces key LMD physics, with relative errors
typically under 5% within the training regime and below 10% when extrapolating
to larger domains and later times. The method accelerates computations by up to
16,000 times, cutting weeks of simulation down to seconds, and marks an early
step toward scalable, high-fidelity extrapolation of LMD phase-field models.

Motivation: 上下文学习(ICL)已成为NLP和LLM应用的重要范式，但其理论机制理解有限，需要深入研究ICL的工作原理。

Method: 提出概念式上下文学习(CB-ICL)的理论分析框架，量化LLM可用的知识，推导提示演示与查询输入之间的相似性度量，并探索演示数量和嵌入维度的影响。

Result: 理论分析解释了CB-ICL在少量演示下表现良好的原因，提出的相似性度量为模型预训练和提示工程提供了重要指导，并通过真实数据实验验证了实用性。

Conclusion: CB-ICL理论框架为理解ICL机制提供了重要洞见，量化了知识利用过程，对LLM预训练和提示工程具有指导意义。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as an important new paradigm in natural
language processing and large language model (LLM) applications. However, the
theoretical understanding of the ICL mechanism remains limited. This paper aims
to investigate this issue by studying a particular ICL approach, called
concept-based ICL (CB-ICL). In particular, we propose theoretical analyses on
applying CB-ICL to ICL tasks, which explains why and when the CB-ICL performs
well for predicting query labels in prompts with only a few demonstrations. In
addition, the proposed theory quantifies the knowledge that can be leveraged by
the LLMs to the prompt tasks, and leads to a similarity measure between the
prompt demonstrations and the query input, which provides important insights
and guidance for model pre-training and prompt engineering in ICL. Moreover,
the impact of the prompt demonstration size and the dimension of the LLM
embeddings in ICL are also explored based on the proposed theory. Finally,
several real-data experiments are conducted to validate the practical
usefulness of CB-ICL and the corresponding theory.

TL;DR: 本文研究了代码生成中合成验证器的瓶颈问题，发现当前验证方法过于严格，过滤了有价值的多样性。通过调整验证策略，如使用更丰富的测试套件、放宽通过标准和结合LLM软验证，可以提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代码生成模型越来越多地依赖合成数据，验证能力成为训练数据质量和多样性的关键瓶颈。本文旨在系统研究验证设计和策略如何影响模型性能。

Method: 系统研究验证设计的三个方面：(1) 验证内容：分析测试复杂度和数量的影响；(2) 验证方式：探索放宽通过标准和LLM软验证；(3) 验证必要性：比较正确与错误解决方案并进行人工评估。

Result: 更丰富的测试套件平均提升3%的pass@1性能；放宽验证标准可恢复有价值的训练数据，带来2-4个百分点的性能提升；保留每个问题的多样化正确解决方案能带来一致的泛化收益。

Conclusion: 当前验证实践过于严格，但不能完全抛弃。通过结合校准验证与多样化、具有挑战性的问题-解决方案对，可以突破验证天花板，开发更强的代码生成模型。

Abstract: Large language models for code generation increasingly rely on synthetic
data, where both problem solutions and verification tests are generated by
models. While this enables scalable data creation, it introduces a previously
unexplored bottleneck: the verification ceiling, in which the quality and
diversity of training data are fundamentally constrained by the capabilities of
synthetic verifiers. In this work, we systematically study how verification
design and strategies influence model performance. We investigate (i) what we
verify by analyzing the impact of test complexity and quantity: richer test
suites improve code generation capabilities (on average +3 pass@1), while
quantity alone yields diminishing returns, (ii) how we verify by exploring
relaxed pass thresholds: rigid 100% pass criteria can be overly restrictive. By
allowing for relaxed thresholds or incorporating LLM-based soft verification,
we can recover valuable training data, leading to a 2-4 point improvement in
pass@1 performance. However, this benefit is contingent upon the strength and
diversity of the test cases used, and (iii) why verification remains necessary
through controlled comparisons of formally correct versus incorrect solutions
and human evaluation: retaining diverse correct solutions per problem yields
consistent generalization gains. Our results show that Verification as
currently practiced is too rigid, filtering out valuable diversity. But it
cannot be discarded, only recalibrated. By combining calibrated verification
with diverse, challenging problem-solution pairs, we outline a path to break
the verification ceiling and unlock stronger code generation models.
