### [1] [Baltimore Atlas: FreqWeaver Adapter for Semi-supervised Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15565)
*Junhao Wu,Aboagye-Ntow Stephen,Chuyuan Wang,Gang Chen,Xin Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种参数高效的半监督分割框架，用于0.3米空间分辨率影像，结合SAM2知识和遥感专用FreqWeaver Adapter，在仅占模型总参数5.96%的情况下提升细粒度细节建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超高空间分辨率土地覆盖分类对细粒度分析至关重要，但面临像素级标注成本高、尺度变化大及大规模视觉模型适应性有限等挑战。现有方法多依赖标注数据且仅适用于1米分辨率影像，而实际应用需在弱监督下处理更高分辨率影像。

Method: 提出参数高效的半监督分割框架，结合SAM2知识并引入遥感专用FreqWeaver Adapter，以轻量化设计（仅5.96%参数）增强细粒度细节建模。

Result: 有效利用未标注数据且参数开销最小，分割结果具有优越结构一致性，比现有参数高效调优策略提升1.78%，比最先进高分辨率遥感分割方法提升3.44%。

Conclusion: 该方法在超高分辨率遥感影像分割中表现出色，兼顾轻量化和性能提升，为实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Ultra-high Spatial Resolution Land Cover Classification is essential for
fine-grained land cover analysis, yet it remains challenging due to the high
cost of pixel-level annotations, significant scale variation, and the limited
adaptability of large-scale vision models. Existing methods typically focus on
1-meter spatial resolution imagery and rely heavily on annotated data, whereas
practical applications often require processing higher-resolution imagery under
weak supervision. To address this, we propose a parameter-efficient
semi-supervised segmentation framework for 0.3 m spatial resolution imagery,
which leverages the knowledge of SAM2 and introduces a remote sensing-specific
FreqWeaver Adapter to enhance fine-grained detail modeling while maintaining a
lightweight design at only 5.96% of the total model parameters. By effectively
leveraging unlabeled data and maintaining minimal parameter overhead, the
proposed method delivers robust segmentation results with superior structural
consistency, achieving a 1.78% improvement over existing parameter-efficient
tuning strategies and a 3.44% gain compared to state-of-the-art high-resolution
remote sensing segmentation approaches.

### [2] [A Unified Graph-based Framework for Scalable 3D Tree Reconstruction and Non-Destructive Biomass Estimation from Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15577)
*Di Wang,Shi Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图的新型统一框架，用于大规模点云的端到端处理，显著提高了森林地上生物量（AGB）估计的可行性和扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有定量结构模型（QSM）方法依赖高质量点云数据且需复杂预处理，限制了其扩展性和实际应用。

Method: 通过创新的图操作（如路径和抽象）无缝集成树木分割、叶木分离和3D骨架重建。

Result: 在多种条件下（如叶覆盖和低密度点云）表现优异，相对误差约20%-30%，验证了ULS作为TLS可行替代方案的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模AGB估计提供了稳健且可扩展的解决方案，推动了森林调查和气候变化研究的广泛应用。

Abstract: Estimating forest above-ground biomass (AGB) is crucial for assessing carbon
storage and supporting sustainable forest management. Quantitative Structural
Model (QSM) offers a non-destructive approach to AGB estimation through 3D tree
structural reconstruction. However, current QSM methods face significant
limitations, as they are primarily designed for individual trees,depend on
high-quality point cloud data from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and also
require multiple pre-processing steps that hinder scalability and practical
deployment. This study presents a novel unified framework that enables
end-to-end processing of large-scale point clouds using an innovative
graph-based pipeline. The proposed approach seamlessly integrates tree
segmentation,leaf-wood separation and 3D skeletal reconstruction through
dedicated graph operations including pathing and abstracting for tree topology
reasoning. Comprehensive validation was conducted on datasets with varying leaf
conditions (leaf-on and leaf-off), spatial scales (tree- and plot-level), and
data sources (TLS and UAV-based laser scanning, ULS). Experimental results
demonstrate strong performance under challenging conditions, particularly in
leaf-on scenarios (~20% relative error) and low-density ULS datasets with
partial coverage (~30% relative error). These findings indicate that the
proposed framework provides a robust and scalable solution for large-scale,
non-destructive AGB estimation. It significantly reduces dependency on
specialized pre-processing tools and establishes ULS as a viable alternative to
TLS. To our knowledge, this is the first method capable of enabling seamless,
end-to-end 3D tree reconstruction at operational scales. This advancement
substantially improves the feasibility of QSM-based AGB estimation, paving the
way for broader applications in forest inventory and climate change research.

### [3] [One-Step Diffusion for Detail-Rich and Temporally Consistent Video Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15591)
*Yujing Sun,Lingchen Sun,Shuaizheng Liu,Rongyuan Wu,Zhengqiang Zhang,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DLoRAL的双LoRA学习范式，用于在视频超分辨率任务中同时实现丰富的空间细节和时序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于稳定扩散（SD）的Real-VSR方法在保持时序一致性的同时往往牺牲了空间细节，导致视觉质量不佳。

Method: 通过双LoRA学习范式（DLoRAL），包括跨帧检索（CFR）模块和一致性-LoRA（C-LoRA）模块，以及细节-LoRA（D-LoRA）模块，分阶段优化以实现细节增强与时序一致性。

Result: 实验表明，DLoRAL在准确性和速度上均表现出色。

Conclusion: DLoRAL通过双LoRA学习范式，成功实现了视频超分辨率中细节与时序一致性的平衡，为高效高质量的视频恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: It is a challenging problem to reproduce rich spatial details while
maintaining temporal consistency in real-world video super-resolution
(Real-VSR), especially when we leverage pre-trained generative models such as
stable diffusion (SD) for realistic details synthesis. Existing SD-based
Real-VSR methods often compromise spatial details for temporal coherence,
resulting in suboptimal visual quality. We argue that the key lies in how to
effectively extract the degradation-robust temporal consistency priors from the
low-quality (LQ) input video and enhance the video details while maintaining
the extracted consistency priors. To achieve this, we propose a Dual LoRA
Learning (DLoRAL) paradigm to train an effective SD-based one-step diffusion
model, achieving realistic frame details and temporal consistency
simultaneously. Specifically, we introduce a Cross-Frame Retrieval (CFR) module
to aggregate complementary information across frames, and train a
Consistency-LoRA (C-LoRA) to learn robust temporal representations from
degraded inputs. After consistency learning, we fix the CFR and C-LoRA modules
and train a Detail-LoRA (D-LoRA) to enhance spatial details while aligning with
the temporal space defined by C-LoRA to keep temporal coherence. The two phases
alternate iteratively for optimization, collaboratively delivering consistent
and detail-rich outputs. During inference, the two LoRA branches are merged
into the SD model, allowing efficient and high-quality video restoration in a
single diffusion step. Experiments show that DLoRAL achieves strong performance
in both accuracy and speed. Code and models are available at
https://github.com/yjsunnn/DLoRAL.

### [4] [Mono-Modalizing Extremely Heterogeneous Multi-Modal Medical Image Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15596)
*Kyobin Choo,Hyunkyung Han,Jinyeong Kim,Chanyong Yoon,Seong Jae Hwang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出M2M-Reg框架，解决多模态图像配准中因模态差异大导致的配准失真问题，通过单模态相似性训练模型，并引入GradCyCon正则化器提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态图像配准（DIR）中，传统方法因模态差异大难以学习可靠的空间映射，导致图像失真。

Method: 提出M2M-Reg框架，利用单模态相似性训练多模态DIR模型，并引入GradCyCon正则化器促进微分同胚。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上，M2M-Reg在PET-MRI和FA-MRI配准中DSC提升2倍。

Conclusion: M2M-Reg有效解决了高度异质多模态DIR问题，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: In clinical practice, imaging modalities with functional characteristics,
such as positron emission tomography (PET) and fractional anisotropy (FA), are
often aligned with a structural reference (e.g., MRI, CT) for accurate
interpretation or group analysis, necessitating multi-modal deformable image
registration (DIR). However, due to the extreme heterogeneity of these
modalities compared to standard structural scans, conventional unsupervised DIR
methods struggle to learn reliable spatial mappings and often distort images.
We find that the similarity metrics guiding these models fail to capture
alignment between highly disparate modalities. To address this, we propose
M2M-Reg (Multi-to-Mono Registration), a novel framework that trains multi-modal
DIR models using only mono-modal similarity while preserving the established
architectural paradigm for seamless integration into existing models. We also
introduce GradCyCon, a regularizer that leverages M2M-Reg's cyclic training
scheme to promote diffeomorphism. Furthermore, our framework naturally extends
to a semi-supervised setting, integrating pre-aligned and unaligned pairs only,
without requiring ground-truth transformations or segmentation masks.
Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset
demonstrate that M2M-Reg achieves up to 2x higher DSC than prior methods for
PET-MRI and FA-MRI registration, highlighting its effectiveness in handling
highly heterogeneous multi-modal DIR. Our code is available at
https://github.com/MICV-yonsei/M2M-Reg.

### [5] [BoxFusion: Reconstruction-Free Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection via Real-Time Multi-View Box Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15610)
*Yuqing Lan,Chenyang Zhu,Zhirui Gao,Jiazhao Zhang,Yihan Cao,Renjiao Yi,Yijie Wang,Kai Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需重建的在线3D目标检测框架，结合预训练视觉模型和CLIP，实现高效实时检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集点云重建，计算和内存开销大，难以实时部署。

Method: 利用Cubify Anything和CLIP进行单视图检测，通过关联和优化模块融合多视图检测结果。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和CA-1M数据集上达到SOTA性能，支持大范围实时感知。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重建，计算高效，泛化能力强，适用于实时场景。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection has gained significant interest due to
its critical applications in autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing
detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point
cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and
memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To
address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored
for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming
posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual
foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes,
coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To
fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we
employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an
optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance
predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the
optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique
based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D
bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments
on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel
reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great
generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception
even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.

### [6] [HOIDiNi: Human-Object Interaction through Diffusion Noise Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15625)
*Roey Ron,Guy Tevet,Haim Sawdayee,Amit H. Bermano*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HOIDiNi是一种基于文本驱动的扩散框架，用于生成真实且合理的人-物交互（HOI），通过Diffusion Noise Optimization（DNO）在预训练扩散模型的噪声空间中直接优化，实现了高真实性和物理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人-物交互生成方法在真实性和物理正确性之间难以平衡，HOIDiNi旨在通过结构化的两阶段方法（对象中心阶段和人体中心阶段）解决这一问题。

Method: HOIDiNi采用Diffusion Noise Optimization（DNO）在预训练扩散模型的噪声空间中优化，分为对象中心阶段（选择手-物接触位置）和人体中心阶段（优化全身动作）。

Result: 在GRAB数据集上的定量、定性和主观评估表明，HOIDiNi在接触准确性、物理有效性和整体质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOIDiNi能够仅通过文本提示生成复杂且可控的人-物交互，包括抓取、放置和全身协调。

Abstract: We present HOIDiNi, a text-driven diffusion framework for synthesizing
realistic and plausible human-object interaction (HOI). HOI generation is
extremely challenging since it induces strict contact accuracies alongside a
diverse motion manifold. While current literature trades off between realism
and physical correctness, HOIDiNi optimizes directly in the noise space of a
pretrained diffusion model using Diffusion Noise Optimization (DNO), achieving
both. This is made feasible thanks to our observation that the problem can be
separated into two phases: an object-centric phase, primarily making discrete
choices of hand-object contact locations, and a human-centric phase that
refines the full-body motion to realize this blueprint. This structured
approach allows for precise hand-object contact without compromising motion
naturalness. Quantitative, qualitative, and subjective evaluations on the GRAB
dataset alone clearly indicate HOIDiNi outperforms prior works and baselines in
contact accuracy, physical validity, and overall quality. Our results
demonstrate the ability to generate complex, controllable interactions,
including grasping, placing, and full-body coordination, driven solely by
textual prompts. https://hoidini.github.io.

### [7] [FindingDory: A Benchmark to Evaluate Memory in Embodied Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15635)
*Karmesh Yadav,Yusuf Ali,Gunshi Gupta,Yarin Gal,Zsolt Kira*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在长期记忆和推理任务中的表现，特别是在机器人控制任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在处理长期记忆和大量图像时表现不佳，限制了其在机器人控制任务中的应用。

Method: 在Habitat模拟器中设计了一个包含60个任务的基准测试，评估模型的长期记忆和推理能力。

Result: 提出了基准测试和基线模型，展示了现有模型在记忆密集型任务中的表现和不足。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为未来研究提供了方向，强调了长期记忆和推理在机器人控制中的重要性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have recently demonstrated impressive
performance in planning and control tasks, driving interest in their
application to real-world robotics. However, deploying these models for
reasoning in embodied contexts is limited by their ability to incorporate
long-term experience collected across multiple days and represented by vast
collections of images. Current VLMs typically struggle to process more than a
few hundred images concurrently, highlighting the need for more efficient
mechanisms to handle long-term memory in embodied settings. To effectively
evaluate these models for long-horizon control, a benchmark must specifically
target scenarios where memory is crucial for success. Existing long-video QA
benchmarks overlook embodied challenges like object manipulation and
navigation, which demand low-level skills and fine-grained reasoning over past
interactions. Moreover, effective memory integration in embodied agents
involves both recalling relevant historical information and executing actions
based on that information, making it essential to study these aspects together
rather than in isolation. In this work, we introduce a new benchmark for
long-range embodied tasks in the Habitat simulator. This benchmark evaluates
memory-based capabilities across 60 tasks requiring sustained engagement and
contextual awareness in an environment. The tasks can also be procedurally
extended to longer and more challenging versions, enabling scalable evaluation
of memory and reasoning. We also present baselines that integrate
state-of-the-art VLMs with low level navigation policies, assessing their
performance on these memory-intensive tasks and highlight areas for
improvement.

### [8] [video-SALMONN 2: Captioning-Enhanced Audio-Visual Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15220)
*Changli Tang,Yixuan Li,Yudong Yang,Jimin Zhuang,Guangzhi Sun,Wei Li,Zejun Ma,Chao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视频-SALMONN 2是一种先进的视听大语言模型，通过低秩适应（LoRA）和定向偏好优化（DPO）提升视频（带音频）字幕生成能力。提出多轮DPO（MrDPO）方法，显著降低错误率28%，性能超越GPT-4o和Gemini-1.5-Pro。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频包含丰富信息，生成准确的自然语言描述是视频理解的关键。现有方法在描述完整性和准确性上仍有提升空间。

Method: 提出视频-SALMONN 2模型，结合LoRA和DPO优化。引入MrDPO方法，周期性更新参考模型并重新初始化LoRA模块，结合真实字幕指导训练。

Result: MrDPO显著提升模型性能，错误率降低28%。7B参数的视频-SALMONN 2在字幕生成任务中超越GPT-4o和Gemini-1.5-Pro。

Conclusion: 视频-SALMONN 2通过MrDPO优化，在视频字幕生成任务中表现优异，同时保持与同类模型竞争性的问答性能。

Abstract: Videos contain a wealth of information, and generating detailed and accurate
descriptions in natural language is a key aspect of video understanding. In
this paper, we present video-SALMONN 2, an advanced audio-visual large language
model (LLM) with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) designed for enhanced video (with
paired audio) captioning through directed preference optimisation (DPO). We
propose new metrics to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of video
descriptions, which are optimised using DPO. To further improve training, we
propose a novel multi-round DPO (MrDPO) approach, which involves periodically
updating the DPO reference model, merging and re-initialising the LoRA module
as a proxy for parameter updates after each training round (1,000 steps), and
incorporating guidance from ground-truth video captions to stabilise the
process. Experimental results show that MrDPO significantly enhances
video-SALMONN 2's captioning accuracy, reducing the captioning error rates by
28\%. The final video-SALMONN 2 model, with just 7 billion parameters,
surpasses leading models such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5-Pro in video captioning
tasks, while maintaining highly competitive performance to the state-of-the-art
on widely used video question-answering benchmarks among models of similar
size. Codes are available at

### [9] [Demystifying the Visual Quality Paradox in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15645)
*Shuo Xing,Lanqing Guo,Hongyuan Hua,Seoyoung Lee,Peiran Li,Yufei Wang,Zhangyang Wang,Zhengzhong Tu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉质量与性能之间存在矛盾：图像质量偏离人类感知时，模型表现反而更好。为此，作者提出了一种轻量级适配模块VQ-TTT，动态调整输入图像以提升任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉输入质量对MLLMs性能的影响，发现传统图像修复方法无法满足模型需求。

Method: 引入VQ-TTT模块，通过可学习的低秩核和浅层视觉编码器微调，动态调整输入图像。

Result: VQ-TTT显著提升了MLLMs在多个数据集上的平均准确率，无需额外数据或模型。

Conclusion: 研究重新定义了MLLMs对视觉输入的需求，强调适应性而非普遍“干净”图像的重要性。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel on benchmark
vision-language tasks, yet little is known about how input visual quality
shapes their responses. Does higher perceptual quality of images already
translate to better MLLM understanding? We conduct the first systematic study
spanning leading MLLMs and a suite of vision-language benchmarks, applying
controlled degradations and stylistic shifts to each image. Surprisingly, we
uncover a visual-quality paradox: model, task, and even individual-instance
performance can improve when images deviate from human-perceived fidelity.
Off-the-shelf restoration pipelines fail to reconcile these idiosyncratic
preferences. To close the gap, we introduce Visual-Quality Test-Time Tuning
(VQ-TTT)-a lightweight adaptation module that: (1) inserts a learnable,
low-rank kernel before the frozen vision encoder to modulate frequency content;
and (2) fine-tunes only shallow vision-encoder layers via LoRA. VQ-TTT
dynamically adjusts each input image in a single forward pass, aligning it with
task-specific model preferences. Across the evaluated MLLMs and all datasets,
VQ-TTT lifts significant average accuracy, with no external models, cached
features, or extra training data. These findings redefine ``better'' visual
inputs for MLLMs and highlight the need for adaptive, rather than universally
``clean'', imagery, in the new era of AI being the main data customer.

TL;DR: ViMaR是一种两阶段推理框架，通过结合时间差分价值模型和边缘感知奖励调整，提升视觉语言模型的效率和输出保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法计算成本高且容易产生低置信度生成，导致幻觉问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：首阶段筛选高价值候选描述，次阶段选择性优化弱视觉基础部分，并引入边缘惩罚机制。

Result: ViMaR显著提升描述的可靠性、准确性和细节，速度提升4倍，且能跨模型泛化。

Conclusion: ViMaR具有灵活性、可扩展性，并能通过自训练提升模型性能。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in inference-time search for vision-language
models (VLMs), existing approaches remain both computationally expensive and
prone to unpenalized, low-confidence generations which often lead to persistent
hallucinations. We introduce \textbf{Value-guided Inference with Margin-based
Reward (ViMaR)}, a two-stage inference framework that improves both efficiency
and output fidelity by combining a temporal-difference value model with a
margin-aware reward adjustment. In the first stage, we perform a single pass to
identify the highest-value caption among diverse candidates. In the second
stage, we selectively refine only those segments that were overlooked or
exhibit weak visual grounding, thereby eliminating frequently rewarded
evaluations. A calibrated margin-based penalty discourages low-confidence
continuations while preserving descriptive richness. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLM architectures demonstrate that ViMaR generates captions
that are significantly more reliable, factually accurate, detailed, and
explanatory, while achieving over 4$\times$ speedup compared to existing
value-guided methods. Specifically, we show that ViMaR trained solely on LLaVA
Mistral-7B, \textit{generalizes effectively to guide decoding in a stronger
unseen model}. To further validate this, we adapt the ViMaR to steer generation
in LLaVA-OneVision-Qwen2-7B, leading to consistent improvements in caption
quality and demonstrating robust cross-model guidance. This cross-model
generalization highlights ViMaR's flexibility and modularity, positioning it as
a scalable and transferable inference-time decoding strategy. Furthermore, when
ViMaR-generated captions are used for self-training, the underlying models
achieve substantial gains across a broad suite of visual comprehension
benchmarks, underscoring the potential of fast, accurate, and self-improving
VLM pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有端到端重光照模型因数据稀缺泛化能力差，以及两阶段方法因误差累积导致输出不真实的问题。

Method: 通过视频扩散模型联合估计反照率和合成重光照输出，利用合成多光照数据和自动标注的真实视频进行训练。

Result: 模型在视觉保真度和时间一致性上优于现有方法，并表现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合优化实现了高质量的重光照效果，适用于复杂光照和材质场景。

Abstract: We address the challenge of relighting a single image or video, a task that
demands precise scene intrinsic understanding and high-quality light transport
synthesis. Existing end-to-end relighting models are often limited by the
scarcity of paired multi-illumination data, restricting their ability to
generalize across diverse scenes. Conversely, two-stage pipelines that combine
inverse and forward rendering can mitigate data requirements but are
susceptible to error accumulation and often fail to produce realistic outputs
under complex lighting conditions or with sophisticated materials. In this
work, we introduce a general-purpose approach that jointly estimates albedo and
synthesizes relit outputs in a single pass, harnessing the generative
capabilities of video diffusion models. This joint formulation enhances
implicit scene comprehension and facilitates the creation of realistic lighting
effects and intricate material interactions, such as shadows, reflections, and
transparency. Trained on synthetic multi-illumination data and extensive
automatically labeled real-world videos, our model demonstrates strong
generalization across diverse domains and surpasses previous methods in both
visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Abstract: Video generation techniques have made remarkable progress, promising to be
the foundation of interactive world exploration. However, existing video
generation datasets are not well-suited for world exploration training as they
suffer from some limitations: limited locations, short duration, static scenes,
and a lack of annotations about exploration and the world. In this paper, we
introduce Sekai (meaning ``world'' in Japanese), a high-quality first-person
view worldwide video dataset with rich annotations for world exploration. It
consists of over 5,000 hours of walking or drone view (FPV and UVA) videos from
over 100 countries and regions across 750 cities. We develop an efficient and
effective toolbox to collect, pre-process and annotate videos with location,
scene, weather, crowd density, captions, and camera trajectories. Experiments
demonstrate the quality of the dataset. And, we use a subset to train an
interactive video world exploration model, named YUME (meaning ``dream'' in
Japanese). We believe Sekai will benefit the area of video generation and world
exploration, and motivate valuable applications.

*Anirud Aggarwal,Abhinav Shrivastava,Matthew Gwilliam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ECAD是一种基于遗传算法的缓存调度方法，用于加速扩散模型的推理，无需修改网络参数或参考图像，显著提升速度并保持质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理速度慢且计算成本高，现有方法依赖固定启发式规则，效果有限且泛化性差。

Method: 提出ECAD，通过遗传算法学习高效的缓存调度策略，形成帕累托前沿，仅需少量校准提示。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，ECAD显著提升推理速度（如PixArt-alpha加速2.58倍）并改善质量（COCO FID提升4.47）。

Conclusion: ECAD是一种可扩展且泛化性强的扩散模型加速方法，适用于不同模型和分辨率。

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generation models excel at producing high-quality
synthetic content, but suffer from slow and computationally expensive
inference. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this by caching and reusing
features within diffusion transformers across inference steps. These methods,
however, often rely on rigid heuristics that result in limited acceleration or
poor generalization across architectures. We propose Evolutionary Caching to
Accelerate Diffusion models (ECAD), a genetic algorithm that learns efficient,
per-model, caching schedules forming a Pareto frontier, using only a small set
of calibration prompts. ECAD requires no modifications to network parameters or
reference images. It offers significant inference speedups, enables
fine-grained control over the quality-latency trade-off, and adapts seamlessly
to different diffusion models. Notably, ECAD's learned schedules can generalize
effectively to resolutions and model variants not seen during calibration. We
evaluate ECAD on PixArt-alpha, PixArt-Sigma, and FLUX-1.dev using multiple
metrics (FID, CLIP, Image Reward) across diverse benchmarks (COCO, MJHQ-30k,
PartiPrompts), demonstrating consistent improvements over previous approaches.
On PixArt-alpha, ECAD identifies a schedule that outperforms the previous
state-of-the-art method by 4.47 COCO FID while increasing inference speedup
from 2.35x to 2.58x. Our results establish ECAD as a scalable and generalizable
approach for accelerating diffusion inference. Our project website is available

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对360度视频的超分辨率方法S3PO，并创建了新的数据集360VDS，解决了传统VSR模型在360度视频中的失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360度视频在VR中广泛应用，但分辨率不足影响视觉质量。传统VSR技术无法解决其投影失真问题，且缺乏相关数据集。

Method: 提出S3PO模型，采用循环建模和注意力机制，设计了专用特征提取器和损失函数以解决球形失真。

Result: S3PO在360度视频数据集上表现优于现有VSR模型和360度专用超分辨率模型。

Conclusion: S3PO通过针对性设计和优化，有效提升了360度视频的超分辨率效果。

Abstract: Omnidirectional Videos (or 360{\deg} videos) are widely used in Virtual
Reality (VR) to facilitate immersive and interactive viewing experiences.
However, the limited spatial resolution in 360{\deg} videos does not allow for
each degree of view to be represented with adequate pixels, limiting the visual
quality offered in the immersive experience. Deep learning Video
Super-Resolution (VSR) techniques used for conventional videos could provide a
promising software-based solution; however, these techniques do not tackle the
distortion present in equirectangular projections of 360{\deg} video signals.
An additional obstacle is the limited availability of 360{\deg} video datasets
for study. To address these issues, this paper creates a novel 360{\deg} Video
Dataset (360VDS) with a study of the extensibility of conventional VSR models
to 360{\deg} videos. This paper further proposes a novel deep learning model
for 360{\deg} Video Super-Resolution (360{\deg} VSR), called Spherical Signal
Super-resolution with a Proportioned Optimisation (S3PO). S3PO adopts recurrent
modelling with an attention mechanism, unbound from conventional VSR techniques
like alignment. With a purpose-built feature extractor and a novel loss
function addressing spherical distortion, S3PO outperforms most
state-of-the-art conventional VSR models and 360{\deg}~specific
super-resolution models on 360{\deg} video datasets. A step-wise ablation study
is presented to understand and demonstrate the impact of the chosen
architectural sub-components, targeted training and optimisation.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于Edge Impulse和深度学习模型的实时糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）检测方法，适用于边缘设备，具有高准确性和低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）是全球糖尿病患者视力损害的主要原因，传统诊断方法耗时且资源密集，亟需高效、低成本的解决方案。

Method: 研究使用Kaggle EyePACS数据集，通过预处理增强数据，并训练多种CNN模型（如MobileNet、ShuffleNet等），优化后部署到边缘设备。

Result: MobileNet准确率达96.45%，SqueezeNet模型仅176KB，延迟17ms，适合实时检测；其他模型在资源效率上表现优异。

Conclusion: 边缘AI技术为DR早期检测提供了可扩展、经济高效的解决方案，尤其适用于资源有限的医疗环境。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a leading cause of vision impairment in
individuals with diabetes, affects approximately 34.6% of diabetes patients
globally, with the number of cases projected to reach 242 million by 2045.
Traditional DR diagnosis relies on the manual examination of retinal fundus
images, which is both time-consuming and resource intensive. This study
presents a novel solution using Edge Impulse to deploy multiple deep learning
models for real-time DR detection on edge devices. A robust dataset of over
3,662 retinal fundus images, sourced from the Kaggle EyePACS dataset, was
curated, and enhanced through preprocessing techniques, including augmentation
and normalization. Using TensorFlow, various Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), such as MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, and a custom Deep Neural
Network (DNN), were designed, trained, and optimized for edge deployment. The
models were converted to TensorFlowLite and quantized to 8-bit integers to
reduce their size and enhance inference speed, with minimal trade-offs in
accuracy. Performance evaluations across different edge hardware platforms,
including smartphones and microcontrollers, highlighted key metrics such as
inference speed, accuracy, precision, and resource utilization. MobileNet
achieved an accuracy of 96.45%, while SqueezeNet demonstrated strong real-time
performance with a small model size of 176 KB and latency of just 17 ms on GPU.
ShuffleNet and the custom DNN achieved moderate accuracy but excelled in
resource efficiency, making them suitable for lower-end devices. This
integration of edge AI technology into healthcare presents a scalable,
cost-effective solution for early DR detection, providing timely and accurate
diagnosis, especially in resource-constrained and remote healthcare settings.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了Transformer模型（UNETR和SwinUNETR）在T2加权MRI图像中前列腺分割的鲁棒性，相比传统3D UNet，SwinUNETR在跨读者和跨站点数据中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决前列腺MRI分割中因读者差异和跨站点数据导致的精度下降问题。

Method: 比较UNETR、SwinUNETR和3D UNet，采用三种训练策略（单队列、5折交叉验证、基于腺体大小的数据集），并使用Optuna优化超参数。

Result: SwinUNETR在跨读者和跨站点数据中表现最佳，Dice分数提升高达5分。

Conclusion: SwinUNETR的全局和移位窗口自注意力机制有效减少标签噪声和类别不平衡敏感性，适合临床部署。

Abstract: Inter reader variability and cross site domain shift challenge the automatic
segmentation of prostate anatomy using T2 weighted MRI images. This study
investigates whether transformer models can retain precision amid such
heterogeneity. We compare the performance of UNETR and SwinUNETR in prostate
gland segmentation against our previous 3D UNet model [1], based on 546 MRI
(T2weighted) volumes annotated by two independent experts. Three training
strategies were analyzed: single cohort dataset, 5 fold cross validated mixed
cohort, and gland size based dataset. Hyperparameters were tuned by Optuna. The
test set, from an independent population of readers, served as the evaluation
endpoint (Dice Similarity Coefficient). In single reader training, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.816 for Reader#1 and 0.860 for Reader#2,
while UNETR scored 0.8 and 0.833 for Readers #1 and #2, respectively, compared
to the baseline UNets 0.825 for Reader #1 and 0.851 for Reader #2. SwinUNETR
had an average dice score of 0.8583 for Reader#1 and 0.867 for Reader#2 in
cross-validated mixed training. For the gland size-based dataset, SwinUNETR
achieved an average dice score of 0.902 for Reader#1 subset and 0.894 for
Reader#2, using the five-fold mixed training strategy (Reader#1, n=53;
Reader#2, n=87) at larger gland size-based subsets, where UNETR performed
poorly. Our findings demonstrate that global and shifted-window self-attention
effectively reduces label noise and class imbalance sensitivity, resulting in
improvements in the Dice score over CNNs by up to five points while maintaining
computational efficiency. This contributes to the high robustness of SwinUNETR
for clinical deployment.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: FAHR-Face是一个基于4000万张面部图像训练的基础模型，用于生物年龄估计和生存风险预测。模型在公开数据集和癌症患者中表现出色，提供了互补的预后信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过面部外观提供非侵入性的健康评估窗口，开发可扩展的面部生物标志物。

Method: FAHR-FaceAge通过两阶段年龄平衡微调训练；FAHR-FaceSurvival在癌症患者照片上微调。测试了模型鲁棒性和独立性，并在临床数据集中验证。

Result: FAHR-FaceAge在年龄估计中误差最低（5.1年），FAHR-FaceSurvival能稳健预测死亡率。两者结合提高了预后准确性。

Conclusion: 单一基础模型可生成低成本、可扩展的面部生物标志物，捕捉生物衰老和疾病相关死亡风险。

Abstract: Background: Facial appearance offers a noninvasive window into health. We
built FAHR-Face, a foundation model trained on >40 million facial images and
fine-tuned it for two distinct tasks: biological age estimation (FAHR-FaceAge)
and survival risk prediction (FAHR-FaceSurvival).
  Methods: FAHR-FaceAge underwent a two-stage, age-balanced fine-tuning on
749,935 public images; FAHR-FaceSurvival was fine-tuned on 34,389 photos of
cancer patients. Model robustness (cosmetic surgery, makeup, pose, lighting)
and independence (saliency mapping) was tested extensively. Both models were
clinically tested in two independent cancer patient datasets with survival
analyzed by multivariable Cox models and adjusted for clinical prognostic
factors.
  Findings: For age estimation, FAHR-FaceAge had the lowest mean absolute error
of 5.1 years on public datasets, outperforming benchmark models and maintaining
accuracy across the full human lifespan. In cancer patients, FAHR-FaceAge
outperformed a prior facial age estimation model in survival prognostication.
FAHR-FaceSurvival demonstrated robust prediction of mortality, and the
highest-risk quartile had more than triple the mortality of the lowest
(adjusted hazard ratio 3.22; P<0.001). These findings were validated in the
independent cohort and both models showed generalizability across age, sex,
race and cancer subgroups. The two algorithms provided distinct, complementary
prognostic information; saliency mapping revealed each model relied on distinct
facial regions. The combination of FAHR-FaceAge and FAHR-FaceSurvival improved
prognostic accuracy.
  Interpretation: A single foundation model can generate inexpensive, scalable
facial biomarkers that capture both biological ageing and disease-related
mortality risk. The foundation model enabled effective training using
relatively small clinical datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解剖树结构在临床诊断和治疗规划中至关重要，但现有方法难以准确表示其复杂的拓扑和几何特征。

Method: 开发了RvNN，利用血管的层次结构学习低维流形，编码分支连接和几何特征，生成新的血管几何模型。

Result: 生成的3D血管模型在半径、长度和弯曲度上与真实数据高度相似，适用于医疗培训、血流模拟等。

Conclusion: RvNN首次成功应用于血管合成，为医学领域提供了更准确和多样化的血管模型。

Abstract: Anatomical trees play an important role in clinical diagnosis and treatment
planning. Yet, accurately representing these structures poses significant
challenges owing to their intricate and varied topology and geometry. Most
existing methods to synthesize vasculature are rule based, and despite
providing some degree of control and variation in the structures produced, they
fail to capture the diversity and complexity of actual anatomical data. We
developed a Recursive variational Neural Network (RvNN) that fully exploits the
hierarchical organization of the vessel and learns a low-dimensional manifold
encoding branch connectivity along with geometry features describing the target
surface. After training, the RvNN latent space can be sampled to generate new
vessel geometries. By leveraging the power of generative neural networks, we
generate 3D models of blood vessels that are both accurate and diverse, which
is crucial for medical and surgical training, hemodynamic simulations, and many
other purposes. These results closely resemble real data, achieving high
similarity in vessel radii, length, and tortuosity across various datasets,
including those with aneurysms. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the
first to utilize this technique for synthesizing blood vessels.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态学习显著提升了神经退行性疾病的诊断能力，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: The integration of multi-modal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and clinical
data holds great promise for enhancing the diagnosis of neurological disorders
(NDs) in real-world clinical settings. Deep Learning (DL) has recently emerged
as a powerful tool for extracting meaningful patterns from medical data to aid
in diagnosis. However, existing DL approaches struggle to effectively leverage
multi-modal MRI and clinical data, leading to suboptimal performance.
  To address this challenge, we utilize a unique, proprietary multi-modal
clinical dataset curated for ND research. Based on this dataset, we propose a
novel transformer-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework for ND
classification, leveraging multiple MRI modalities-anatomical (aMRI), Diffusion
Tensor Imaging (DTI), and functional (fMRI)-alongside clinical assessments. Our
framework employs transformer encoders to capture spatial relationships within
volumetric MRI data while utilizing modality-specific experts for targeted
feature extraction. A gating mechanism with adaptive fusion dynamically
integrates expert outputs, ensuring optimal predictive performance.
Comprehensive experiments and comparisons with multiple baselines demonstrate
that our multi-modal approach significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy,
particularly in distinguishing overlapping disease states. Our framework
achieves a validation accuracy of 82.47\%, outperforming baseline methods by
over 10\%, highlighting its potential to improve ND diagnosis by applying
multi-modal learning to real-world clinical data.

Motivation: 解决DICOM头文件中因协议多样性和人为错误导致的信息不准确问题，以提高放射科医生的工作效率。

Method: 使用ResNet、EfficientNet和DenseNet等多种深度学习分类器对MRI序列进行分类，比较性能并选择最佳模型。

Result: DenseNet-121在内部数据集上F1-score和准确率分别为0.966和0.972，在外部数据集上表现也良好。

Conclusion: DenseNet-121模型在分类MRI序列任务中表现出色，且性能随训练数据量增加而提升。

Abstract: Multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) exams have various series
types acquired with different imaging protocols. The DICOM headers of these
series often have incorrect information due to the sheer diversity of protocols
and occasional technologist errors. To address this, we present a deep
learning-based classification model to classify 8 different body mpMRI series
types so that radiologists read the exams efficiently. Using mpMRI data from
various institutions, multiple deep learning-based classifiers of ResNet,
EfficientNet, and DenseNet are trained to classify 8 different MRI series, and
their performance is compared. Then, the best-performing classifier is
identified, and its classification capability under the setting of different
training data quantities is studied. Also, the model is evaluated on the
out-of-training-distribution datasets. Moreover, the model is trained using
mpMRI exams obtained from different scanners in two training strategies, and
its performance is tested. Experimental results show that the DenseNet-121
model achieves the highest F1-score and accuracy of 0.966 and 0.972 over the
other classification models with p-value$<$0.05. The model shows greater than
0.95 accuracy when trained with over 729 studies of the training data, whose
performance improves as the training data quantities grew larger. On the
external data with the DLDS and CPTAC-UCEC datasets, the model yields 0.872 and
0.810 accuracy for each. These results indicate that in both the internal and
external datasets, the DenseNet-121 model attains high accuracy for the task of
classifying 8 body MRI series types.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于VQGAN和同态加密（HE）的医疗图像推理框架，通过压缩图像和优化激活函数，显著降低了计算负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗图像包含敏感信息，需要隐私保护，但HE推理计算成本高，尤其是大图像（如胸部X光）。

Method: 使用VQGAN压缩图像为潜在表示，近似激活函数为低阶多项式，并引入squeeze and excitation模块优化HE框架。

Result: 在胸部X光数据集上测试，压缩因子为8时性能与计算成本达到最优平衡，HE推理虽慢但实用性高。

Conclusion: 该方法在保护隐私的同时，为医疗图像HE推理提供了高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical imaging data contain sensitive patient information requiring strong
privacy protection. Many analytical setups require data to be sent to a server
for inference purposes. Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a solution by
allowing computations to be performed on encrypted data without revealing the
original information. However, HE inference is computationally expensive,
particularly for large images (e.g., chest X-rays). In this study, we propose
an HE inference framework for medical images that uses VQGAN to compress images
into latent representations, thereby significantly reducing the computational
burden while preserving image quality. We approximate the activation functions
with lower-degree polynomials to balance the accuracy and efficiency in
compliance with HE requirements. We observed that a downsampling factor of
eight for compression achieved an optimal balance between performance and
computational cost. We further adapted the squeeze and excitation module, which
is known to improve traditional CNNs, to enhance the HE framework. Our method
was tested on two chest X-ray datasets for multi-label classification tasks
using vanilla CNN backbones. Although HE inference remains relatively slow and
introduces minor performance differences compared with unencrypted inference,
our approach shows strong potential for practical use in medical images

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaborative
medical image analysis, enabling multiple institutions to build robust
predictive models while preserving sensitive patient data. In the context of
Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification, FL faces significant challenges,
including heterogeneous computational resources across participating medical
institutes and privacy concerns. To address these challenges, we propose
FedWSIDD, a novel FL paradigm that leverages dataset distillation (DD) to learn
and transmit synthetic slides. On the server side, FedWSIDD aggregates
synthetic slides from participating centres and distributes them across all
centres. On the client side, we introduce a novel DD algorithm tailored to
histopathology datasets which incorporates stain normalisation into the
distillation process to generate a compact set of highly informative synthetic
slides. These synthetic slides, rather than model parameters, are transmitted
to the server. After communication, the received synthetic slides are combined
with original slides for local tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple WSI
classification tasks, including CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17, demonstrate that
FedWSIDD offers flexibility for heterogeneous local models, enhances local WSI
classification performance, and preserves patient privacy. This makes it a
highly effective solution for complex WSI classification tasks. The code is
available at FedWSIDD.

Conclusion: 混合去噪系统显著提升了内窥镜图像质量，为超小型传感器的应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Endoscopes featuring a miniaturized design have significantly enhanced
operational flexibility, portability, and diagnostic capability while
substantially reducing the invasiveness of medical procedures. Recently,
single-use endoscopes equipped with an ultra-compact analogue image sensor
measuring less than 1mm x 1mm bring revolutionary advancements to medical
diagnosis. They reduce the structural redundancy and large capital expenditures
associated with reusable devices, eliminate the risk of patient infections
caused by inadequate disinfection, and alleviate patient suffering. However,
the limited photosensitive area results in reduced photon capture per pixel,
requiring higher photon sensitivity settings to maintain adequate brightness.
In high-contrast medical imaging scenarios, the small-sized sensor exhibits a
constrained dynamic range, making it difficult to simultaneously capture
details in both highlights and shadows, and additional localized digital gain
is required to compensate. Moreover, the simplified circuit design and analog
signal transmission introduce additional noise sources. These factors
collectively contribute to significant noise issues in processed endoscopic
images. In this work, we developed a comprehensive noise model for analog image
sensors in medical endoscopes, addressing three primary noise types:
fixed-pattern noise, periodic banding noise, and mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise.
Building on this analysis, we propose a hybrid denoising system that
synergistically combines traditional image processing algorithms with advanced
learning-based techniques for captured raw frames from sensors. Experiments
demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces image noise without fine
detail loss or color distortion, while achieving real-time performance on FPGA
platforms and an average PSNR improvement from 21.16 to 33.05 on our test
dataset.

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a significant health problem, especially in
developing countries. Early detection is critical for effective treatment.
Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have shown promise in automated cervical
cancer screening, but their performance depends on Pap smear image quality.
This study investigates the impact of various image preprocessing techniques on
CNN performance for cervical cancer classification using the SIPaKMeD dataset.
Three preprocessing techniques were evaluated: perona-malik diffusion (PMD)
filter for noise reduction, contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization
(CLAHE) for image contrast enhancement, and the proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE approach. The enhanced image datasets were evaluated on pretrained
models, such as ResNet-34, ResNet-50, SqueezeNet-1.0, MobileNet-V2,
EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B1, DenseNet-121, and DenseNet-201. The results
show that hybrid preprocessing PMD filter-CLAHE can improve the Pap smear image
quality and CNN architecture performance compared to the original images. The
maximum metric improvements are 13.62% for accuracy, 10.04% for precision,
13.08% for recall, and 14.34% for F1-score. The proposed hybrid PMD
filter-CLAHE technique offers a new perspective in improving cervical cancer

Abstract: Cancer is an abnormal growth with potential to invade locally and metastasize
to distant organs. Accurate auto-segmentation of the tumor and surrounding
normal tissues is required for radiotherapy treatment plan optimization. Recent
AI-based segmentation models are generally trained on large public datasets,
which lack the heterogeneity of local patient populations. While these studies
advance AI-based medical image segmentation, research on local datasets is
necessary to develop and integrate AI tumor segmentation models directly into
hospital software for efficient and accurate oncology treatment planning and
execution. This study enhances tumor segmentation using computationally
efficient hybrid UNet-Transformer models on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
datasets acquired from a local hospital under strict privacy protection. We
developed a robust data pipeline for seamless DICOM extraction and
preprocessing, followed by extensive image augmentation to ensure model
generalization across diverse clinical settings, resulting in a total dataset
of 6080 images for training. Our novel architecture integrates UNet-based
convolutional neural networks with a transformer bottleneck and complementary
attention modules, including efficient attention, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE)
blocks, Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), and ResNeXt blocks. To
accelerate convergence and reduce computational demands, we used a maximum
batch size of 8 and initialized the encoder with pretrained ImageNet weights,
training the model on dual NVIDIA T4 GPUs via checkpointing to overcome
Kaggle's runtime limits. Quantitative evaluation on the local MRI dataset
yielded a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.764 and an Intersection over Union
(IoU) of 0.736, demonstrating competitive performance despite limited data and
underscoring the importance of site-specific model development for clinical
deployment.

### [27] [Revisiting Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning from A Cross-Domain Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14965)

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Guru，一个包含92K可验证示例的强化学习推理语料库，涵盖六个推理领域，并展示了Guru-7B和Guru-32B模型在公开数据RL训练中的领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习在大型语言模型推理中的应用主要集中在数学和代码领域，缺乏对其他推理领域的广泛研究，且缺乏可靠、可扩展的奖励信号。

Method: 通过领域特定的奖励设计、去重和过滤构建Guru语料库，并基于此系统性地研究RL在不同推理领域的效果，训练出Guru-7B和Guru-32B模型。

Result: Guru-7B和Guru-32B在六个推理领域的17项任务中表现最佳，分别比基线模型高出7.9%和6.7%，且在复杂任务上显著提升Pass@k性能。

Conclusion: RL在不同推理领域的效果存在显著差异，某些领域需要领域内训练才能取得显著性能提升，表明RL可能促进真正的技能获取。Guru语料库和模型为通用推理研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach to improve
large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet most open efforts focus narrowly on
math and code, limiting our understanding of its broader applicability to
general reasoning. A key challenge lies in the lack of reliable, scalable RL
reward signals across diverse reasoning domains. We introduce Guru, a curated
RL reasoning corpus of 92K verifiable examples spanning six reasoning
domains--Math, Code, Science, Logic, Simulation, and Tabular--each built
through domain-specific reward design, deduplication, and filtering to ensure
reliability and effectiveness for RL training. Based on Guru, we systematically
revisit established findings in RL for LLM reasoning and observe significant
variation across domains. For example, while prior work suggests that RL
primarily elicits existing knowledge from pretrained models, our results reveal
a more nuanced pattern: domains frequently seen during pretraining (Math, Code,
Science) easily benefit from cross-domain RL training, while domains with
limited pretraining exposure (Logic, Simulation, and Tabular) require in-domain
training to achieve meaningful performance gains, suggesting that RL is likely
to facilitate genuine skill acquisition. Finally, we present Guru-7B and
Guru-32B, two models that achieve state-of-the-art performance among open
models RL-trained with publicly available data, outperforming best baselines by
7.9% and 6.7% on our 17-task evaluation suite across six reasoning domains. We
also show that our models effectively improve the Pass@k performance of their
base models, particularly on complex tasks less likely to appear in pretraining
data. We release data, models, training and evaluation code to facilitate
general-purpose reasoning at: https://github.com/LLM360/Reasoning360

### [28] [Optimal Embedding Learning Rate in LLMs: The Effect of Vocabulary Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15025)
*Soufiane Hayou,Liyuan Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了词汇量对大型语言模型训练动态的影响，提出了与μP理论不同的LV（大词汇）机制，并验证了其优化规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: μP理论在LLMs应用中存在局限性，尤其是词汇量固定假设不现实，研究词汇量对训练动态的影响。

Method: 理论分析词汇量对训练动态的影响，提出LV机制，并通过实验验证优化规则。

Result: 发现LV机制下最优嵌入学习率与隐藏学习率比例应约为√width，与μP预测的width不同。

Conclusion: 词汇量增加时，训练动态在μP和LV机制间过渡，LV机制下的优化规则更符合实际需求。

Abstract: Pretraining large language models is a costly process. To make this process
more efficient, several methods have been proposed to optimize model
architecture/parametrization and hardware use. On the parametrization side,
$\mu P$ (Maximal Update Parametrization) parametrizes model weights and
learning rate (LR) in a way that makes hyperparameters (HPs) transferable with
width (embedding dimension): HPs can be tuned for a small model and used for
larger models without additional tuning. While $\mu$P showed impressive results
in practice, recent empirical studies have reported conflicting observations
when applied to LLMs. One limitation of the theory behind $\mu$P is the fact
that input dimension (vocabulary size in LLMs) is considered fixed when taking
the width to infinity. This is unrealistic since vocabulary size is generally
much larger than width in practice. In this work, we provide a theoretical
analysis of the effect of vocabulary size on training dynamics, and
subsequently show that as vocabulary size increases, the training dynamics
\emph{interpolate between the $\mu$P regime and another regime that we call
Large Vocab (LV) Regime}, where optimal scaling rules are different from those
predicted by $\mu$P. Our analysis reveals that in the LV regime, the optimal
embedding LR to hidden LR ratio should roughly scale as $\Theta(\sqrt{width})$,
surprisingly close to the empirical findings previously reported in the
literature, and different from the $\Theta(width)$ ratio predicted by $\mu$P.
We conduct several experiments to validate our theory, and pretrain a 1B model
from scratch to show the benefit of our suggested scaling rule for the
embedding LR.

TL;DR: 论文研究了上下文学习（ICL）在标签缺失或错误情况下的有效性，通过理论分析展示了不同模型结构对未标记数据的利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨ICL在标签不完整或错误时的表现，揭示模型如何利用未标记数据。

Method: 使用二元高斯混合模型（GMM）生成演示数据，分析单层线性注意力模型和多层/循环Transformer的表现。

Result: 单层模型无法利用未标记数据，而多层/循环模型能有效构建估计器，性能随深度指数提升。

Conclusion: 通过循环现成的表格基础模型，显著提升了半监督学习性能。

Abstract: Recent research shows that in-context learning (ICL) can be effective even
when demonstrations have missing or incorrect labels. To shed light on this
capability, we examine a canonical setting where the demonstrations are drawn
according to a binary Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and a certain fraction of
the demonstrations have missing labels. We provide a comprehensive theoretical
study to show that: (1) The loss landscape of one-layer linear attention models
recover the optimal fully-supervised estimator but completely fail to exploit
unlabeled data; (2) In contrast, multilayer or looped transformers can
effectively leverage unlabeled data by implicitly constructing estimators of
the form $\sum_{i\ge 0} a_i (X^\top X)^iX^\top y$ with $X$ and $y$ denoting
features and partially-observed labels (with missing entries set to zero). We
characterize the class of polynomials that can be expressed as a function of
depth and draw connections to Expectation Maximization, an iterative
pseudo-labeling algorithm commonly used in semi-supervised learning.
Importantly, the leading polynomial power is exponential in depth, so mild
amount of depth/looping suffices. As an application of theory, we propose
looping off-the-shelf tabular foundation models to enhance their
semi-supervision capabilities. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
show that our method significantly improves the semisupervised tabular learning
performance over the standard single pass inference.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRISM框架通过捕捉神经网络特征的复杂性，解决了现有方法在鲁棒性和单义性假设上的不足，提供了更准确的特征描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征描述方法假设神经元仅编码单一概念（单义性），而实际上神经元常为多义性，限制了描述的全面性和准确性。

Method: 提出PRISM框架，为多义性和单义性特征提供更细致的描述，并通过语言模型验证其效果。

Result: PRISM在描述质量和多义性捕捉能力上优于现有方法，表现为更高的描述分数和多义性分数。

Conclusion: PRISM通过更复杂的特征描述方法，显著提升了神经网络特征解释的准确性和全面性。

Abstract: Automated interpretability research aims to identify concepts encoded in
neural network features to enhance human understanding of model behavior.
Current feature description methods face two critical challenges: limited
robustness and the flawed assumption that each neuron encodes only a single
concept (monosemanticity), despite growing evidence that neurons are often
polysemantic. This assumption restricts the expressiveness of feature
descriptions and limits their ability to capture the full range of behaviors
encoded in model internals. To address this, we introduce Polysemantic FeatuRe
Identification and Scoring Method (PRISM), a novel framework that captures the
inherent complexity of neural network features. Unlike prior approaches that
assign a single description per feature, PRISM provides more nuanced
descriptions for both polysemantic and monosemantic features. We apply PRISM to
language models and, through extensive benchmarking against existing methods,
demonstrate that our approach produces more accurate and faithful feature
descriptions, improving both overall description quality (via a description
score) and the ability to capture distinct concepts when polysemanticity is
present (via a polysemanticity score).

*Gabrel J. Perin,Runjin Chen,Xuxi Chen,Nina S. T. Hirata,Zhangyang Wang,Junyuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LoX的无训练方法，通过外推对齐LLM的安全子空间，增强其安全性，实验证明LoX能显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对齐模型在安全方面有所改进，但后续微调仍可能破坏其安全保护，因此需要一种增强安全鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 提出Low-Rank Extrapolation (LoX)方法，外推安全子空间，减少微调对安全性的影响。

Result: LoX在面对良性或恶意微调攻击时，攻击成功率绝对降低了11%至54%。

Conclusion: LoX通过将参数移动到更平坦的区域，减少对扰动的敏感性，有效提升了模型的安全鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model's
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at
github.com/VITA-Group/LoX.

### [32] [AutoRule: Reasoning Chain-of-thought Extracted Rule-based Rewards Improve Preference Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15651)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AutoRule是一种自动从人类偏好反馈中提取规则并转化为规则奖励的方法，显著提升了强化学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于规则的奖励方法依赖人工规则设计，AutoRule旨在实现完全自动化，提高效率和性能。

Method: AutoRule分三阶段：利用推理模型解释用户偏好，从推理链中提取候选规则，合成统一规则集，并用语言模型验证规则满足度作为辅助奖励。

Result: 在Llama-3-8B模型上，AutoRule使AlpacaEval2.0的胜率提升28.6%，MT-Bench子集第二轮性能提升6.1%，且减少了奖励滥用。

Conclusion: AutoRule能自动提取与数据集偏好一致的规则，捕捉独特质量，代码已开源。

Abstract: Rule-based rewards offer a promising strategy for improving reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF), but current approaches often rely on
manual rule engineering. We present AutoRule, a fully automated method for
extracting rules from preference feedback and formulating them into rule-based
rewards. AutoRule extraction operates in three stages: it leverages a reasoning
model to interpret user preferences, identifies candidate rules from the
reasoning chain of these interpretations, and synthesizes them into a unified
rule set. Leveraging the finalized rule set, we employ language-model verifiers
to compute the fraction of rules satisfied by each output, using this metric as
an auxiliary reward alongside the learned reward model during policy
optimization. Training a Llama-3-8B model with AutoRule results in a 28.6\%
relative improvement in length-controlled win rate on AlpacaEval2.0, and a
6.1\% relative gain in second-turn performance on a held-out MT-Bench subset,
compared to a GRPO baseline trained with the same learned reward model but
without the rule-based auxiliary reward. Our analysis confirms that the
extracted rules exhibit good agreement with dataset preference. We find that
AutoRule demonstrates reduced reward hacking compared to a learned reward model
when run over two episodes. Finally, our case study suggests that the extracted
rules capture unique qualities valued in different datasets. The extracted
rules are provided in the appendix, and the code is open-sourced at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PIPE的轻量级方法，通过物理信息位置编码（PIPE）将物理信息嵌入视觉语言模型（VLMs），显著提升了多模态对齐和预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法主要关注文本数据，忽略了视觉数据中的物理信息（如卫星图像的时间和地理空间背景），导致模型难以有效捕捉这些信息。

Method: PIPE包含两个关键创新：1）基于物理信息的位置索引方案；2）变频率位置编码机制，用于编码物理变量的频率信息和标记的顺序信息。

Result: 在最大开源卫星图像数据集上，PIPE在深度学习和气候领域方法中均达到最先进性能，台风强度预测精度提升12%。

Conclusion: PIPE通过保留物理信息和顺序信息，显著提升了多模态对齐和预测准确性，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal time series forecasting is foundational in various fields, such as
utilizing satellite imagery and numerical data for predicting typhoons in
climate science. However, existing multimodal approaches primarily focus on
utilizing text data to help time series forecasting, leaving the visual data in
existing time series datasets untouched. Furthermore, it is challenging for
models to effectively capture the physical information embedded in visual data,
such as satellite imagery's temporal and geospatial context, which extends
beyond images themselves. To address this gap, we propose physics-informed
positional encoding (PIPE), a lightweight method that embeds physical
information into vision language models (VLMs). PIPE introduces two key
innovations: (1) a physics-informed positional indexing scheme for mapping
physics to positional IDs, and (2) a variant-frequency positional encoding
mechanism for encoding frequency information of physical variables and
sequential order of tokens within the embedding space. By preserving both the
physical information and sequential order information, PIPE significantly
improves multimodal alignment and forecasting accuracy. Through the experiments
on the most representative and the largest open-sourced satellite image
dataset, PIPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both deep learning
forecasting and climate domain methods, demonstrating superiority across
benchmarks, including a 12% improvement in typhoon intensity forecasting over
prior works. Our code is provided in the supplementary material.

Motivation: 研究高密度潜在特征的几何、功能和起源，以验证其是否为训练过程中的不良产物。

Method: 分析高密度潜在特征的几何结构、功能分类及其在模型各层的演化。

Result: 高密度特征形成对偶对，重建残差流中的特定方向，并在不同层中表现出结构、语义和输出导向的功能。

Conclusion: 高密度潜在特征在语言模型计算中具有功能性作用，不应被视为噪声。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are designed to extract interpretable features
from language models by enforcing a sparsity constraint. Ideally, training an
SAE would yield latents that are both sparse and semantically meaningful.
However, many SAE latents activate frequently (i.e., are \emph{dense}), raising
concerns that they may be undesirable artifacts of the training procedure. In
this work, we systematically investigate the geometry, function, and origin of
dense latents and show that they are not only persistent but often reflect
meaningful model representations. We first demonstrate that dense latents tend
to form antipodal pairs that reconstruct specific directions in the residual
stream, and that ablating their subspace suppresses the emergence of new dense
features in retrained SAEs -- suggesting that high density features are an
intrinsic property of the residual space. We then introduce a taxonomy of dense
latents, identifying classes tied to position tracking, context binding,
entropy regulation, letter-specific output signals, part-of-speech, and
principal component reconstruction. Finally, we analyze how these features
evolve across layers, revealing a shift from structural features in early
layers, to semantic features in mid layers, and finally to output-oriented
signals in the last layers of the model. Our findings indicate that dense
latents serve functional roles in language model computation and should not be
dismissed as training noise.

TL;DR: 小规模视觉语言模型通过GRPO训练和外部工具（如缩放）提升详细视觉推理能力，在VQA任务中表现优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大模型推理能力进步显著，但视觉语言模型在资源有限时仍难以进行详细视觉推理。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）训练小规模模型，结合简单奖励结构、简化工具调用接口、为工具调用结果分配额外令牌，并侧重视觉难度高的训练数据。

Result: 在部分视觉问答（VQA）任务中表现优于同类基线模型。

Conclusion: GRPO结合外部工具能有效提升小规模模型的详细视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Despite tremendous recent advances in large model reasoning ability,
vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle with detailed visual reasoning,
especially when compute resources are limited. To address this challenge, we
draw inspiration from methods like Deepseek-r1 for VLMs and train smaller-scale
models with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to use external tools
such as zoom. The greatest benefit is obtained with a combination of GRPO
learning, a simple reward structure, a simplified tool-calling interface,
allocating additional tokens to the result of the tool call, and a training
data mix that over-represents visually difficult examples. Compared to
similarly-sized baseline models, our method achieves better performance on some
visual question-answering (VQA) tasks, thanks to the detailed visual
information gathered from the external tool.

Motivation: 医疗数据通常不完整或有限，且ML模型缺乏透明度，影响了模型性能和可信度。AMD的早期诊断至关重要，但缺乏有效的治疗方法。

Method: 开发了CACTUS工具，结合遗传、饮食、临床和人口统计学因素，通过消除不相关或有偏数据，提供可解释的分类结果。

Result: CACTUS在AMD分期分类中表现优于标准ML模型，并能识别关键因素，增强决策信心。

Conclusion: CACTUS通过提高透明度和减少偏差，为临床医生提供了更可靠的分类工具，有助于AMD的早期诊断。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is used to tackle various tasks, such as disease
classification and prediction. The effectiveness of ML models relies heavily on
having large amounts of complete data. However, healthcare data is often
limited or incomplete, which can hinder model performance. Additionally, issues
like the trustworthiness of solutions vary with the datasets used. The lack of
transparency in some ML models further complicates their understanding and use.
In healthcare, particularly in the case of Age-related Macular Degeneration
(AMD), which affects millions of older adults, early diagnosis is crucial due
to the absence of effective treatments for reversing progression. Diagnosing
AMD involves assessing retinal images along with patients' symptom reports.
There is a need for classification approaches that consider genetic, dietary,
clinical, and demographic factors. Recently, we introduced the -Comprehensive
Abstraction and Classification Tool for Uncovering Structures-(CACTUS), aimed
at improving AMD stage classification. CACTUS offers explainability and
flexibility, outperforming standard ML models. It enhances decision-making by
identifying key factors and providing confidence in its results. The important
features identified by CACTUS allow us to compare with existing medical
knowledge. By eliminating less relevant or biased data, we created a clinical
scenario for clinicians to offer feedback and address biases.

Motivation: 后验归因方法在解释深度学习预测时存在非鲁棒性问题，微小输入扰动会显著改变归因图，影响其可信度。

Method: 采用随机平滑技术，将归因图稀疏化和平滑化，重新定义为分割问题，并认证每个像素的重要性。

Result: 在12种归因方法和5个ImageNet模型上的广泛评估表明，认证后的归因具有鲁棒性、可解释性和忠实性。

Conclusion: 该框架为归因方法提供了可靠的鲁棒性保证，适用于下游任务。

Abstract: Post-hoc attribution methods aim to explain deep learning predictions by
highlighting influential input pixels. However, these explanations are highly
non-robust: small, imperceptible input perturbations can drastically alter the
attribution map while maintaining the same prediction. This vulnerability
undermines their trustworthiness and calls for rigorous robustness guarantees
of pixel-level attribution scores. We introduce the first certification
framework that guarantees pixel-level robustness for any black-box attribution
method using randomized smoothing. By sparsifying and smoothing attribution
maps, we reformulate the task as a segmentation problem and certify each
pixel's importance against $\ell_2$-bounded perturbations. We further propose
three evaluation metrics to assess certified robustness, localization, and
faithfulness. An extensive evaluation of 12 attribution methods across 5
ImageNet models shows that our certified attributions are robust,
interpretable, and faithful, enabling reliable use in downstream tasks. Our
code is at https://github.com/AlaaAnani/certified-attributions.

Conclusion: SonicVerse能生成丰富描述，并支持长音乐片段的详细描述生成。

Abstract: Detailed captions that accurately reflect the characteristics of a music
piece can enrich music databases and drive forward research in music AI. This
paper introduces a multi-task music captioning model, SonicVerse, that
integrates caption generation with auxiliary music feature detection tasks such
as key detection, vocals detection, and more, so as to directly capture both
low-level acoustic details as well as high-level musical attributes. The key
contribution is a projection-based architecture that transforms audio input
into language tokens, while simultaneously detecting music features through
dedicated auxiliary heads. The outputs of these heads are also projected into
language tokens, to enhance the captioning input. This framework not only
produces rich, descriptive captions for short music fragments but also directly
enables the generation of detailed time-informed descriptions for longer music
pieces, by chaining the outputs using a large-language model. To train the
model, we extended the MusicBench dataset by annotating it with music features
using MIRFLEX, a modular music feature extractor, resulting in paired audio,
captions and music feature data. Experimental results show that incorporating
features in this way improves the quality and detail of the generated captions.

Conclusion: 被动声学监测结合自动化工具（如pycnet-audio）能显著提高野生动物研究的效率和规模。

Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring is an emerging approach in wildlife research that
leverages recent improvements in purpose-made automated recording units (ARUs).
The general approach is to deploy ARUs in the field to record on a programmed
schedule for extended periods (weeks or months), after which the audio data are
retrieved. These data must then be processed, typically either by measuring or
analyzing characteristics of the audio itself (e.g. calculating acoustic
indices), or by searching for some signal of interest within the recordings,
e.g. vocalizations or other sounds produced by some target species,
anthropogenic or environmental noise, etc. In the latter case, some method is
required to locate the signal(s) of interest within the audio. While very small
datasets can simply be searched manually, even modest projects can produce
audio datasets on the order of 105 hours of recordings, making manual review
impractical and necessitating some form of automated detection. pycnet-audio
(Ruff 2024) is intended to provide a practical processing workflow for acoustic
data, built around the PNW-Cnet model, which was initially developed by the

### [41] [Identifying economic narratives in large text corpora -- An integrated approach using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15041)
*Tobias Schmidt,Kai-Robin Lange,Matthias Reccius,Henrik Müller,Michael Roos,Carsten Jentsch*

Main category: econ.GN

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（如GPT-4）在提取经济叙事方面的潜力，并与专家标注的标准进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着经济叙事研究的兴起，现有自然语言处理技术（如BERT）在语义理解上存在不足，无法区分经济叙事提取与传统任务（如语义角色标注）。

Method: 研究使用GPT-4分析《华尔街日报》和《纽约时报》关于通胀的文章，并与专家标注的叙事进行对比。

Result: GPT-4能提取结构化经济叙事，但在处理复杂文档和叙事时仍不及专家水平。

Conclusion: 论文为经济学和社会科学领域未来使用大型语言模型提供了指导。

Abstract: As interest in economic narratives has grown in recent years, so has the
number of pipelines dedicated to extracting such narratives from texts.
Pipelines often employ a mix of state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques, such as BERT, to tackle this task. While effective on foundational
linguistic operations essential for narrative extraction, such models lack the
deeper semantic understanding required to distinguish extracting economic
narratives from merely conducting classic tasks like Semantic Role Labeling.
Instead of relying on complex model pipelines, we evaluate the benefits of
Large Language Models (LLMs) by analyzing a corpus of Wall Street Journal and
New York Times newspaper articles about inflation. We apply a rigorous
narrative definition and compare GPT-4o outputs to gold-standard narratives
produced by expert annotators. Our results suggests that GPT-4o is capable of
extracting valid economic narratives in a structured format, but still falls
short of expert-level performance when handling complex documents and
narratives. Given the novelty of LLMs in economic research, we also provide
guidance for future work in economics and the social sciences that employs LLMs
to pursue similar objectives.

TL;DR: HAC是一种分层音频编解码器，通过单一模型将瓶颈分解为声学、音素和词汇三个层次，利用知识蒸馏目标实现音素和词汇信息的解耦。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了在单一模型中统一表示声学细节和词汇意义，HAC旨在提供一种离散语音表示，用于下游任务。

Method: HAC通过HuBERT和LaBSE的知识蒸馏目标，分别提取音素和词汇信息，形成解耦的标记集。

Result: 实验表明，HAC的标记集在解耦和重建质量上优于单层基线，同时保留了自然性和可解释性。

Conclusion: HAC作为一种统一的离散语音表示，有望在语音生成和理解任务中发挥作用。

Abstract: We propose Hierarchical Audio Codec (HAC), a unified neural speech codec that
factorizes its bottleneck into three linguistic levels-acoustic, phonetic, and
lexical-within a single model. HAC leverages two knowledge distillation
objectives: one from a pre-trained speech encoder (HuBERT) for phoneme-level
structure, and another from a text-based encoder (LaBSE) for lexical cues.
Experiments on English and multilingual data show that HAC's factorized
bottleneck yields disentangled token sets: one aligns with phonemes, while
another captures word-level semantics. Quantitative evaluations confirm that
HAC tokens preserve naturalness and provide interpretable linguistic
information, outperforming single-level baselines in both disentanglement and
reconstruction quality. These findings underscore HAC's potential as a unified
discrete speech representation, bridging acoustic detail and lexical meaning
for downstream speech generation and understanding tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种定量框架，通过假设测试评估LLM模拟与真实人类行为在多选调查中的偏差，发现流行语言模型在模拟特定人群时存在不匹配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在社会科学研究中的广泛应用，评估其模拟人类行为的准确性变得至关重要。

Method: 使用假设测试构建定量框架，评估LLM模拟与人类行为在多选调查中的差异。

Result: 研究发现，流行语言模型在模拟特定人群（如不同种族、年龄、收入）时表现不佳，尤其在争议性问题中。

Conclusion: 该语言模型与测试人群的匹配性存在问题，提示在社会科学研究中需改进LLM的使用方式。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly appear in social science
research (e.g., economics and marketing), it becomes crucial to assess how well
these models replicate human behavior. In this work, using hypothesis testing,
we present a quantitative framework to assess the misalignment between
LLM-simulated and actual human behaviors in multiple-choice survey settings.
This framework allows us to determine in a principled way whether a specific
language model can effectively simulate human opinions, decision-making, and
general behaviors represented through multiple-choice options. We applied this
framework to a popular language model for simulating people's opinions in
various public surveys and found that this model is ill-suited for simulating
the tested sub-populations (e.g., across different races, ages, and incomes)
for contentious questions. This raises questions about the alignment of this
language model with the tested populations, highlighting the need for new
practices in using LLMs for social science studies beyond naive simulations of
human subjects.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型AI代理范式——Embodied Web Agents，旨在整合物理世界交互和网络规模推理能力，并开发了统一的任务环境和基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理在物理世界交互和数字信息处理上存在割裂，限制了其解决跨领域任务的能力。

Method: 开发了Embodied Web Agents任务环境，整合3D模拟环境和功能性网络接口，并构建了涵盖多任务的基准测试。

Result: 实验显示现有AI系统与人类能力存在显著差距，揭示了跨领域智能的挑战与机遇。

Conclusion: Embodied Web Agents为AI代理的跨领域智能提供了新方向，相关数据和工具已公开。

Abstract: AI agents today are mostly siloed - they either retrieve and reason over vast
amount of digital information and knowledge obtained online; or interact with
the physical world through embodied perception, planning and action - but
rarely both. This separation limits their ability to solve tasks that require
integrated physical and digital intelligence, such as cooking from online
recipes, navigating with dynamic map data, or interpreting real-world landmarks
using web knowledge. We introduce Embodied Web Agents, a novel paradigm for AI
agents that fluidly bridge embodiment and web-scale reasoning. To
operationalize this concept, we first develop the Embodied Web Agents task
environments, a unified simulation platform that tightly integrates realistic
3D indoor and outdoor environments with functional web interfaces. Building
upon this platform, we construct and release the Embodied Web Agents Benchmark,
which encompasses a diverse suite of tasks including cooking, navigation,
shopping, tourism, and geolocation - all requiring coordinated reasoning across
physical and digital realms for systematic assessment of cross-domain
intelligence. Experimental results reveal significant performance gaps between
state-of-the-art AI systems and human capabilities, establishing both
challenges and opportunities at the intersection of embodied cognition and
web-scale knowledge access. All datasets, codes and websites are publicly
available at our project page https://embodied-web-agent.github.io/.

Motivation: 利用无人机和先进算法辅助视障人士（VIPs）在复杂环境中独立导航，提升其生活质量。

Method: 提出几何问题建模和多DNN框架，结合局部感知路径规划和全局GPS地图规划，实现无人机和VIP的障碍物避让。

Conclusion: 系统在复杂环境中有效辅助视障人士导航，展示了无人机技术的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation by drones using onboard sensors combined with machine
learning and computer vision algorithms is impacting a number of domains,
including agriculture, logistics, and disaster management. In this paper, we
examine the use of drones for assisting visually impaired people (VIPs) in
navigating through outdoor urban environments. Specifically, we present a
perception-based path planning system for local planning around the
neighborhood of the VIP, integrated with a global planner based on GPS and maps
for coarse planning. We represent the problem using a geometric formulation and
propose a multi DNN based framework for obstacle avoidance of the UAV as well
as the VIP. Our evaluations conducted on a drone human system in a university
campus environment verifies the feasibility of our algorithms in three
scenarios; when the VIP walks on a footpath, near parked vehicles, and in a
crowded street.

TL;DR: 提出了一种鲁棒的上下文模仿学习算法（RIP），通过使用Student's t回归模型减少LLM生成的幻觉轨迹，显著提高了任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上下文模仿学习（In-Context IL）依赖LLM生成即时策略，但存在幻觉轨迹问题，影响可靠性。

Method: RIP利用Student's t分布聚合多个候选轨迹，忽略异常值（幻觉），生成鲁棒轨迹。

Result: 实验表明，RIP在低数据场景下任务成功率至少提高26%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RIP通过减少幻觉轨迹，显著提升了模仿学习的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to enable robots to perform tasks autonomously
by observing a few human demonstrations. Recently, a variant of IL, called
In-Context IL, utilized off-the-shelf large language models (LLMs) as instant
policies that understand the context from a few given demonstrations to perform
a new task, rather than explicitly updating network models with large-scale
demonstrations. However, its reliability in the robotics domain is undermined
by hallucination issues such as LLM-based instant policy, which occasionally
generates poor trajectories that deviate from the given demonstrations. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a new robust in-context imitation learning
algorithm called the robust instant policy (RIP), which utilizes a Student's
t-regression model to be robust against the hallucinated trajectories of
instant policies to allow reliable trajectory generation. Specifically, RIP
generates several candidate robot trajectories to complete a given task from an
LLM and aggregates them using the Student's t-distribution, which is beneficial
for ignoring outliers (i.e., hallucinations); thereby, a robust trajectory
against hallucinations is generated. Our experiments, conducted in both
simulated and real-world environments, show that RIP significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art IL methods, with at least $26\%$ improvement in task success
rates, particularly in low-data scenarios for everyday tasks. Video results

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MCOO-SLAM是一种基于多相机全景配置的SLAM系统，通过结合点特征和对象级标志物，实现了复杂户外场景下的鲁棒、一致且语义丰富的建图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM方法依赖RGB-D或单目相机，视野窄、易受遮挡且深度感知有限，导致对象建模不准确和数据关联不可靠。

Method: 提出MCOO-SLAM，集成点特征和对象级标志物，引入语义-几何-时间融合策略和全景闭环模块，构建分层3D场景图。

Result: 实验表明，MCOO-SLAM在遮挡、姿态变化和环境复杂性下实现了准确定位和可扩展的对象级建图。

Conclusion: MCOO-SLAM通过多相机全景配置和语义增强，显著提升了SLAM系统的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Object-level SLAM offers structured and semantically meaningful environment
representations, making it more interpretable and suitable for high-level
robotic tasks. However, most existing approaches rely on RGB-D sensors or
monocular views, which suffer from narrow fields of view, occlusion
sensitivity, and limited depth perception-especially in large-scale or outdoor
environments. These limitations often restrict the system to observing only
partial views of objects from limited perspectives, leading to inaccurate
object modeling and unreliable data association. In this work, we propose
MCOO-SLAM, a novel Multi-Camera Omnidirectional Object SLAM system that fully
leverages surround-view camera configurations to achieve robust, consistent,
and semantically enriched mapping in complex outdoor scenarios. Our approach
integrates point features and object-level landmarks enhanced with
open-vocabulary semantics. A semantic-geometric-temporal fusion strategy is
introduced for robust object association across multiple views, leading to
improved consistency and accurate object modeling, and an omnidirectional loop
closure module is designed to enable viewpoint-invariant place recognition
using scene-level descriptors. Furthermore, the constructed map is abstracted
into a hierarchical 3D scene graph to support downstream reasoning tasks.
Extensive experiments in real-world demonstrate that MCOO-SLAM achieves
accurate localization and scalable object-level mapping with improved
robustness to occlusion, pose variation, and environmental complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可变形物体的动态建模因物理属性多样性和视觉信息有限而具有挑战性，需一种高效且通用的方法。

Method: 采用粒子-网格混合表示，粒子捕捉物体形状，空间网格确保空间连续性，结合高斯渲染生成3D动作视频。

Conclusion: 该框架为可变形物体的学习型数字孪生提供了有效解决方案，适用于机器人交互和规划任务。

Abstract: Modeling the dynamics of deformable objects is challenging due to their
diverse physical properties and the difficulty of estimating states from
limited visual information. We address these challenges with a neural dynamics
framework that combines object particles and spatial grids in a hybrid
representation. Our particle-grid model captures global shape and motion
information while predicting dense particle movements, enabling the modeling of
objects with varied shapes and materials. Particles represent object shapes,
while the spatial grid discretizes the 3D space to ensure spatial continuity
and enhance learning efficiency. Coupled with Gaussian Splattings for visual
rendering, our framework achieves a fully learning-based digital twin of
deformable objects and generates 3D action-conditioned videos. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that our model learns the dynamics of diverse
objects -- such as ropes, cloths, stuffed animals, and paper bags -- from
sparse-view RGB-D recordings of robot-object interactions, while also
generalizing at the category level to unseen instances. Our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art learning-based and physics-based simulators,
particularly in scenarios with limited camera views. Furthermore, we showcase
the utility of our learned models in model-based planning, enabling
goal-conditioned object manipulation across a range of tasks. The project page

Motivation: 现有方法假设IMU传感器紧密附着于人体，但实际场景中这一假设常不成立，因此需解决松散附着IMU的挑战。

Method: 通过模拟现有服装感知运动数据集的IMU记录，开发基于变换器的扩散模型，合成松散IMU数据并估计姿态，同时结合服装参数训练。

Conclusion: 该方法为松散IMU传感器的姿态估计开辟了新方向，未来研究潜力大。

Abstract: Motion capture using sparse inertial sensors has shown great promise due to
its portability and lack of occlusion issues compared to camera-based tracking.
Existing approaches typically assume that IMU sensors are tightly attached to
the human body. However, this assumption often does not hold in real-world
scenarios. In this paper, we present a new task of full-body human pose
estimation using sparse, loosely attached IMU sensors. To solve this task, we
simulate IMU recordings from an existing garment-aware human motion dataset. We
developed transformer-based diffusion models to synthesize loose IMU data and
estimate human poses based on this challenging loose IMU data. In addition, we
show that incorporating garment-related parameters while training the model on
simulated loose data effectively maintains expressiveness and enhances the
ability to capture variations introduced by looser or tighter garments.
Experiments show that our proposed diffusion methods trained on simulated and
synthetic data outperformed the state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and
qualitatively, opening up a promising direction for future research.

Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖大量训练数据的问题，减少数据稀缺和高人力成本的影响。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能一次性生成高质量且一致的素描，适用性更广。

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺情况下表现优异，提供了更便捷的解决方案。

Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into
sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training
with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these
large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as
data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes
scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we
propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We
optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image
pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are
used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and
evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new
benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark
consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with
different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes,
expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we
select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used
for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can
convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a
one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater
convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at:

Result: 实验表明，Nabla-R2D3在少量微调步骤内能获得更高奖励并减少先验遗忘。

Conclusion: Nabla-R2D3为3D生成模型提供了一种高效对齐方法，优于传统微调基线。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and photorealistic 3D assets remains a longstanding
challenge in 3D vision and computer graphics. Although state-of-the-art
generative models, such as diffusion models, have made significant progress in
3D generation, they often fall short of human-designed content due to limited
ability to follow instructions, align with human preferences, or produce
realistic textures, geometries, and physical attributes. In this paper, we
introduce Nabla-R2D3, a highly effective and sample-efficient reinforcement
learning alignment framework for 3D-native diffusion models using 2D rewards.
Built upon the recently proposed Nabla-GFlowNet method, which matches the score
function to reward gradients in a principled manner for reward finetuning, our
Nabla-R2D3 enables effective adaptation of 3D diffusion models using only 2D
reward signals. Extensive experiments show that, unlike vanilla finetuning
baselines which either struggle to converge or suffer from reward hacking,
Nabla-R2D3 consistently achieves higher rewards and reduced prior forgetting
within a few finetuning steps.

Abstract: Data visualization (DataViz) libraries play a crucial role in presentation,
data analysis, and application development, underscoring the importance of
their accuracy in transforming data into visual representations. Incorrect
visualizations can adversely impact user experience, distort information
conveyance, and influence user perception and decision-making processes. Visual
bugs in these libraries can be particularly insidious as they may not cause
obvious errors like crashes, but instead mislead users of the underlying data
graphically, resulting in wrong decision making. Consequently, a good
understanding of the unique characteristics of bugs in DataViz libraries is
essential for researchers and developers to detect and fix bugs in DataViz
libraries.
  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of bugs in DataViz
libraries, examining 564 bugs collected from five widely-used libraries. Our
study systematically analyzes their symptoms and root causes, and provides a
detailed taxonomy. We found that incorrect/inaccurate plots are pervasive in
DataViz libraries and incorrect graphic computation is the major root cause,
which necessitates further automated testing methods for DataViz libraries.
Moreover, we identified eight key steps to trigger such bugs and two test
oracles specific to DataViz libraries, which may inspire future research in
designing effective automated testing techniques. Furthermore, with the recent
advancements in Vision Language Models (VLMs), we explored the feasibility of
applying these models to detect incorrect/inaccurate plots. The results show
that the effectiveness of VLMs in bug detection varies from 29% to 57%,
depending on the prompts, and adding more information in prompts does not
necessarily increase the effectiveness. More findings can be found in our
manuscript.
