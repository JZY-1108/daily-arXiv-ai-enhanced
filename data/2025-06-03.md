Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PHYSICS数据集包含16,568个高质量物理问题，涵盖多个领域和难度级别，旨在提升大语言模型在物理推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理作为推理密集型且对现实世界理解至关重要的学科，目前在大语言模型研究中关注不足。

Method: 通过精心设计的流程从100多本教科书中筛选问题，构建PHYSICS数据集，并分为训练集和测试集，提供推理路径辅助模型训练。同时提出Rule+Model评估框架以解决现有评估方法的偏差问题。

Result: 评估显示当前最先进的开源和专有模型在处理物理任务时存在局限性。

Conclusion: PHYSICS数据集和评估方法有望共同推动大语言模型在物理领域的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on advanced
reasoning tasks such as mathematics and coding competitions. Meanwhile,
physics, despite being both reasoning-intensive and essential to real-world
understanding, received limited academic and industrial attention. This paper
introduces PHYSICS, a dataset containing 16,568 high-quality physics problems
spanning subjects and difficulty levels, to facilitate this issue.
Specifically, PHYSICS is curated with exercises from over 100 textbooks through
a carefully designed pipeline for quality control. It covers five major physics
domains: Mechanics, Electromagnetism, Thermodynamics, Optics, and Modern
Physics. It also spans a wide range of difficulty levels, from high school to
graduate-level physics courses. To utilize the data for improving and
evaluating the model's physical reasoning capabilities, we split the dataset
into training and test sets, and provide reasoning paths generated by powerful
reasoning models for the training data to facilitate model training. In
addition, for the evaluation part, we find that existing evaluation frameworks
exhibit biases in aspects such as units, simplification, and precision in
physics domain. To balance efficiency and accuracy, we introduce a Rule+Model
evaluation framework tailored to physics problems. Our evaluations on current
state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models highlight the limitations
of current models in handling physics-related tasks. We hope that our dataset
and evaluation methodology will jointly advance the development of LLMs in the
field of physics.

### [3] [From Mathematical Reasoning to Code: Generalization of Process Reward Models in Test-Time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00027)
*Zhengyu Chen,Yudong Wang,Teng Xiao,Ruochen Zhou,Xuesheng Yang,Wei Wang,Zhifang Sui,Jingang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究分析了过程奖励模型（PRMs）在提升大型语言模型推理能力中的效果，探讨了训练方法、可扩展性和泛化能力，并指出模型规模与计算成本的平衡重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索PRMs在解决中间错误中的有效性，以及其在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Method: 从训练方法、可扩展性、泛化能力等多角度分析PRMs，研究预训练与奖励模型训练FLOPs的关系，并测试不同测试时扩展策略。

Result: 发现PRM规模增加时性能回报递减，训练数据多样性显著影响性能，数学数据集训练的PRMs表现与代码生成任务相当。

Conclusion: PRMs在跨领域泛化中表现稳健，优化时应平衡规模与成本，并注重数据多样性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in improving the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models have underscored the efficacy of Process Reward Models (PRMs) in
addressing intermediate errors through structured feedback mechanisms. This
study analyzes PRMs from multiple perspectives, including training
methodologies, scalability, and generalization capabilities. We investigate the
interplay between pre-training and reward model training FLOPs to assess their
influence on PRM efficiency and accuracy in complex reasoning tasks. Our
analysis reveals a pattern of diminishing returns in performance with
increasing PRM scale, highlighting the importance of balancing model size and
computational cost. Furthermore, the diversity of training datasets
significantly impacts PRM performance, emphasizing the importance of diverse
data to enhance both accuracy and efficiency. We further examine test-time
scaling strategies, identifying Monte Carlo Tree Search as the most effective
method when computational resources are abundant, while Best-of-N Sampling
serves as a practical alternative under resource-limited conditions. Notably,
our findings indicate that PRMs trained on mathematical datasets exhibit
performance comparable to those tailored for code generation, suggesting robust
cross-domain generalization. Employing a gradient-based metric, we observe that
PRMs exhibit a preference for selecting responses with similar underlying
patterns, further informing their optimization.

### [4] [Enhancing Tool Learning in Large Language Models with Hierarchical Error Checklists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00042)
*Yue Cui,Liuyi Yao,Shuchang Tao,Weijie Shi,Yaliang Li,Bolin Ding,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出HiTEC框架，通过分层错误检查表（全局和局部）诊断和缓解工具调用错误，并提出了HiTEC-ICL和HiTEC-KTO两种部署方法，显著提升了参数填充准确率和工具调用成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在工具调用中常因参数填充错误而受限，需系统化方法诊断和缓解此类问题。

Method: 提出HiTEC框架，包含全局和局部错误检查表，并开发了HiTEC-ICL（上下文学习）和HiTEC-KTO（偏好优化）两种方法。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上的实验表明，HiTEC显著优于基线方法，提高了参数填充和工具调用的准确性。

Conclusion: HiTEC框架有效解决了工具调用中的参数错误问题，为LLMs的实用化提供了可靠支持。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced natural language
processing, particularly through the integration of external tools and APIs.
However, their effectiveness is frequently hampered by parameter mis-filling
during tool calling. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchical Tool Error
Checklist (HiTEC) framework to systematically diagnose and mitigate
tool-calling errors without relying on extensive real-world interactions. HiTEC
introduces a two-tiered approach: a global error checklist that identifies
common, cross-tool issues, and a local error checklist that targets
tool-specific and contextual failures. Building on this structure, we propose
two deployments: HiTEC-In Context Learning (HiTEC-ICL) and
HiTEC-Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (HiTEC-KTO). HiTEC-ICL embeds the global
checklist in the initial prompts and leverages a two-round conversational
interaction to dynamically refine parameter handling, while HiTEC-KTO generates
high-quality negative examples to drive fine-tuning via preference-based
optimization. Extensive experiments across five public datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly improves parameter-filling accuracy and
tool-calling success rates compared to baseline methods.

### [5] [Unraveling SITT: Social Influence Technique Taxonomy and Detection with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00061)
*Wiktoria Mieleszczenko-Kowszewicz,Beata Bajcar,Aleksander Szczęsny,Maciej Markiewicz,Jolanta Babiak,Berenika Dyczek,Przemysław Kazienko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT)框架，包含58种社会影响技术，并评估了LLMs识别这些技术的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 构建一个全面的框架来检测文本中的社会影响技术，并研究LLMs在此任务上的表现。

Method: 构建SITT数据集（746个对话，由专家标注），采用分层多标签分类方法，评估5种LLMs（如GPT-4o、Claude 3.5等）。

Result: Claude 3.5表现最佳（F1=0.45），但整体模型表现有限，尤其是对上下文敏感的技术。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs对细微语言线索的敏感性不足，需领域特定微调，为研究LLMs识别社会影响技术提供了新资源。

Abstract: In this work we present the Social Influence Technique Taxonomy (SITT), a
comprehensive framework of 58 empirically grounded techniques organized into
nine categories, designed to detect subtle forms of social influence in textual
content. We also investigate the LLMs ability to identify various forms of
social influence. Building on interdisciplinary foundations, we construct the
SITT dataset -- a 746-dialogue corpus annotated by 11 experts in Polish and
translated into English -- to evaluate the ability of LLMs to identify these
techniques. Using a hierarchical multi-label classification setup, we benchmark
five LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, Llama-3.1, Mixtral, and PLLuM. Our
results show that while some models, notably Claude 3.5, achieved moderate
success (F1 score = 0.45 for categories), overall performance of models remains
limited, particularly for context-sensitive techniques. The findings
demonstrate key limitations in current LLMs' sensitivity to nuanced linguistic
cues and underscore the importance of domain-specific fine-tuning. This work
contributes a novel resource and evaluation example for understanding how LLMs
detect, classify, and potentially replicate strategies of social influence in
natural dialogues.

### [6] [Mis-prompt: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Proactive Error Handling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00064)
*Jiayi Zeng,Yizhe Feng,Mengliang He,Wenhui Lei,Wei Zhang,Zeming Liu,Xiaoming Shi,Aimin Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的基准测试Mis-prompt，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在无显式错误处理指令下的主动错误处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中通常缺乏显式错误处理指令，当前LLMs的被动错误处理方式存在局限性。

Method: 引入包含四项评估任务、错误分类法和新数据集的Mis-prompt基准，并分析LLMs在基准上的表现。

Result: 实验显示当前LLMs在主动错误处理上表现不佳，但通过错误处理实例的监督微调（SFT）可提升其能力。

Conclusion: Mis-prompt基准为未来研究提供了方向，数据集将公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant advancements in
error handling. Current error-handling works are performed in a passive manner,
with explicit error-handling instructions. However, in real-world scenarios,
explicit error-handling instructions are usually unavailable. In this paper,
our work identifies this challenge as how to conduct proactive error handling
without explicit error handling instructions. To promote further research, this
work introduces a new benchmark, termed Mis-prompt, consisting of four
evaluation tasks, an error category taxonomy, and a new evaluation dataset.
Furthermore, this work analyzes current LLMs' performance on the benchmark, and
the experimental results reveal that current LLMs show poor performance on
proactive error handling, and SFT on error handling instances improves LLMs'
proactive error handling capabilities. The dataset will be publicly available.

### [7] [You Prefer This One, I Prefer Yours: Using Reference Words is Harder Than Vocabulary Words for Humans and Multimodal Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00065)
*Dota Tianai Dong,Yifan Luo,Po-Ya Angela Wang,Asli Ozyurek,Paula Rubio-Fernandez*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了人类和多模态语言模型（MLMs）在词汇、物主代词和指示代词使用上的表现，发现MLMs在需要视角和空间推理的任务上表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨MLMs在参考词使用上的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 评估七种先进MLMs与人类参与者在词汇、物主代词和指示代词任务上的表现。

Result: MLMs在词汇任务上接近人类水平，但在物主和指示代词任务上表现显著较差，提示工程仅部分改善物主代词使用。

Conclusion: 当前NLP系统在处理需要语用和社会认知的语法形式时仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) increasingly communicate in human-like
ways, yet their ability to use reference words remains largely overlooked
despite their ubiquity in everyday communication. Our study addresses this gap
by comparing human and MLM use of three word classes with increasing cognitive
demands: vocabulary words, possessive pronouns (`mine' vs `yours'), and
demonstrative pronouns (`this one' vs `that one'). Evaluating seven
state-of-the-art MLMs against human participants, we observe a clear difficulty
hierarchy: while MLMs approach human-level performance on the vocabulary task,
they show substantial deficits with possessives and demonstratives. Our
analysis reveals these difficulties stem from limitations in perspective-taking
and spatial reasoning. Although prompt engineering improved model performance
on possessive use, demonstrative use remained well below human-level
competence. These findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that
producing grammatical forms requiring pragmatics and social cognition remains a
clear challenge in current NLP systems.

### [8] [Probing Politico-Economic Bias in Multilingual Large Language Models: A Cultural Analysis of Low-Resource Pakistani Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00068)
*Afrozah Nadeem,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文系统分析了13种最先进的大型语言模型（LLMs）在巴基斯坦五种低资源语言中的政治偏见，提出了一种结合定量和定性分析的新框架，发现LLMs主要偏向自由左翼价值观，但在区域语言中表现出向威权主义的转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是填补LLMs在非西方和低资源多语言环境中政治经济偏见的空白，特别是在巴基斯坦的语境下。

Method: 方法包括结合改编的政治罗盘测试（PCT）和多层次框架分析，定量评估政治倾向（经济和社会轴），并通过内容、风格和重点进行定性分析。

Result: 结果显示LLMs主要受西方训练数据影响，偏向自由左翼，但在区域语言中表现出向威权主义的转变，且存在模型特定的偏见特征。

Conclusion: 结论强调了开发基于文化的多语言偏见审计框架的紧迫性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly shaping public discourse, yet
their politico-economic biases remain underexamined in non-Western and
low-resource multilingual contexts. This paper presents a systematic analysis
of political bias in 13 state-of-the-art LLMs across five low-resource
languages spoken in Pakistan: Urdu, Punjabi, Sindhi, Balochi, and Pashto. We
propose a novel framework that integrates an adapted Political Compass Test
(PCT) with a multi-level framing analysis. Our method combines quantitative
assessment of political orientation across economic (left-right) and social
(libertarian-authoritarian) axes with qualitative analysis of framing through
content, style, and emphasis. We further contextualize this analysis by
aligning prompts with 11 key socio-political themes relevant to Pakistani
society. Our results reveal that LLMs predominantly align with liberal-left
values, echoing Western training data influences, but exhibit notable shifts
toward authoritarian framing in regional languages, suggesting strong cultural
modulation effects. We also identify consistent model-specific bias signatures
and language-conditioned variations in ideological expression. These findings
show the urgent need for culturally grounded, multilingual bias auditing
frameworks.

*Robert Hankache,Kingsley Nketia Acheampong,Liang Song,Marek Brynda,Raad Khraishi,Greig A. Cowan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在多轮对话中的性能变化，发现多轮上下文会导致性能显著下降，并提出任务描述的位置策略可缓解此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试主要关注单轮问答任务，无法反映多轮交互对LLM性能的影响，因此需要系统性评估。

Method: 引入一组新基准测试，系统性改变上下文量和性质，并评估多种LLM（如GPT、Claude、Gemini）的性能变化。

Result: 多轮交互中，LLM在选择题上的性能可能下降高达73%，即使GPT-4o也下降32%；任务描述的位置策略可提升准确性3.5倍。

Conclusion: 需开发稳健策略以设计和评估LLM，并缓解上下文敏感性。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multi-turn
dialogue and other sustained interactive scenarios, it is essential to
understand how extended context affects their performance. Popular benchmarks,
focusing primarily on single-turn question answering (QA) tasks, fail to
capture the effects of multi-turn exchanges. To address this gap, we introduce
a novel set of benchmarks that systematically vary the volume and nature of
prior context. We evaluate multiple conventional LLMs, including GPT, Claude,
and Gemini, across these benchmarks to measure their sensitivity to contextual
variations. Our findings reveal that LLM performance on multiple-choice
questions can degrade dramatically in multi-turn interactions, with performance
drops as large as 73% for certain models. Even highly capable models such as
GPT-4o exhibit up to a 32% decrease in accuracy. Notably, the relative
performance of larger versus smaller models is not always predictable.
Moreover, the strategic placement of the task description within the context
can substantially mitigate performance drops, improving the accuracy by as much
as a factor of 3.5. These findings underscore the need for robust strategies to
design, evaluate, and mitigate context-related sensitivity in LLMs.

*Edward Wang,Tianyu Wang,Avanti Athreya,Vince Lyzinski,Carey E. Priebe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出用交互高斯混合模型（GMMs）替代复杂的大语言模型（LLMs），用于社会科学中研究人类行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs虽然强大但计算成本高，GMMs提供了一种更简单的替代方案。

Method: 比较简化GMMs模型与LLMs在交互反馈中的表现。

Result: 交互GMMs能捕捉LLMs动态的重要特征，但存在差异。

Conclusion: GMMs具有潜力，未来可进一步优化和研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are a powerful tool with the ability to match
human capabilities and behavior in many settings. Retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) further allows LLMs to generate diverse output depending on
the contents of their RAG database. This motivates their use in the social
sciences to study human behavior between individuals when large-scale
experiments are infeasible. However, LLMs depend on complex, computationally
expensive algorithms. In this paper, we introduce interacting Gaussian mixture
models (GMMs) as an alternative to similar frameworks using LLMs. We compare a
simplified model of GMMs to select experimental simulations of LLMs whose
updating and response depend on feedback from other LLMs. We find that
interacting GMMs capture important features of the dynamics in interacting
LLMs, and we investigate key similarities and differences between interacting
LLMs and GMMs. We conclude by discussing the benefits of Gaussian mixture
models, potential modifications, and future research directions.

*Vincent Siu,Nicholas Crispino,Zihao Yu,Sam Pan,Zhun Wang,Yang Liu,Dawn Song,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: COSMIC是一种自动化框架，通过余弦相似度识别拒绝行为的方向和目标层，无需依赖模型输出或预设模板。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义的拒绝模板或手动分析，难以准确识别LLM中的拒绝行为。

Method: 使用余弦相似度指标（COSMIC）自动选择方向，独立于模型输出。

Result: COSMIC在对抗性环境和弱对齐模型中可靠识别拒绝方向，并能引导模型转向更安全行为，同时减少误拒。

Conclusion: COSMIC在多种对齐条件下表现稳健，无需假设拒绝行为的具体形式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode behaviors such as refusal within their
activation space, yet identifying these behaviors remains a significant
challenge. Existing methods often rely on predefined refusal templates
detectable in output tokens or require manual analysis. We introduce
\textbf{COSMIC} (Cosine Similarity Metrics for Inversion of Concepts), an
automated framework for direction selection that identifies viable steering
directions and target layers using cosine similarity - entirely independent of
model outputs. COSMIC achieves steering performance comparable to prior methods
without requiring assumptions about a model's refusal behavior, such as the
presence of specific refusal tokens. It reliably identifies refusal directions
in adversarial settings and weakly aligned models, and is capable of steering
such models toward safer behavior with minimal increase in false refusals,
demonstrating robustness across a wide range of alignment conditions.

*Peng Xie,Xingyuan Liu,Tsz Wai Chan,Yequan Bie,Yangqiu Song,Yang Wang,Hao Chen,Kani Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了LinguaMaster框架和SwitchLingua数据集，填补了多语言代码转换数据集的空白，并提出了新的评估指标SAER。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码转换数据集规模小且多样性不足，无法满足多语言应用需求。

Method: 提出LinguaMaster框架，合成大规模多语言代码转换数据集SwitchLingua，并设计SAER评估指标。

Result: 创建了包含420K文本样本和80小时音频的SwitchLingua数据集，覆盖12种语言和63种民族背景。

Conclusion: SwitchLingua为多语言研究提供了基础资源，SAER提升了代码转换场景下的评估准确性。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) is the alternating use of two or more languages within a
conversation or utterance, often influenced by social context and speaker
identity. This linguistic phenomenon poses challenges for Automatic Speech
Recognition (ASR) systems, which are typically designed for a single language
and struggle to handle multilingual inputs. The growing global demand for
multilingual applications, including Code-Switching ASR (CSASR), Text-to-Speech
(CSTTS), and Cross-Lingual Information Retrieval (CLIR), highlights the
inadequacy of existing monolingual datasets.
  Although some code-switching datasets exist, most are limited to bilingual
mixing within homogeneous ethnic groups, leaving a critical need for a
large-scale, diverse benchmark akin to ImageNet in computer vision.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{LinguaMaster}, a multi-agent
collaboration framework specifically designed for efficient and scalable
multilingual data synthesis. Leveraging this framework, we curate
\textbf{SwitchLingua}, the first large-scale multilingual and multi-ethnic
code-switching dataset, including: (1) 420K CS textual samples across 12
languages, and (2) over 80 hours of audio recordings from 174 speakers
representing 18 countries/regions and 63 racial/ethnic backgrounds, based on
the textual data. This dataset captures rich linguistic and cultural diversity,
offering a foundational resource for advancing multilingual and multicultural
research. Furthermore, to address the issue that existing ASR evaluation
metrics lack sensitivity to code-switching scenarios, we propose the
\textbf{Semantic-Aware Error Rate (SAER)}, a novel evaluation metric that
incorporates semantic information, providing a more accurate and context-aware
assessment of system performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HD-NDEs的新方法，通过神经微分方程在LLMs的潜在空间中建模动态系统，以系统性检测幻觉问题，实验表明其效果优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs取得了显著进展，但幻觉问题（模型生成不准确或非事实性陈述）仍是实际部署中的主要挑战。现有分类方法（如SAPLMA）在早期或中序列输出中表现不佳。

Method: 提出HD-NDEs方法，利用神经微分方程建模LLMs潜在空间中的动态系统，并将潜在空间序列映射到分类空间进行真实性评估。

Result: 在五个数据集和六种常用LLMs上的实验表明，HD-NDEs效果显著，尤其在True-False数据集上AUC-ROC比现有技术提高了14%以上。

Conclusion: HD-NDEs通过系统性建模LLMs潜在空间的动态特性，有效解决了幻觉检测问题，为LLMs的可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable
advancements, yet hallucination, where models produce inaccurate or non-factual
statements, remains a significant challenge for real-world deployment. Although
current classification-based methods, such as SAPLMA, are highly efficient in
mitigating hallucinations, they struggle when non-factual information arises in
the early or mid-sequence of outputs, reducing their reliability. To address
these issues, we propose Hallucination Detection-Neural Differential Equations
(HD-NDEs), a novel method that systematically assesses the truthfulness of
statements by capturing the full dynamics of LLMs within their latent space.
Our approaches apply neural differential equations (Neural DEs) to model the
dynamic system in the latent space of LLMs. Then, the sequence in the latent
space is mapped to the classification space for truth assessment. The extensive
experiments across five datasets and six widely used LLMs demonstrate the
effectiveness of HD-NDEs, especially, achieving over 14% improvement in AUC-ROC
on the True-False dataset compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

### [14] [Writing-Zero: Bridge the Gap Between Non-verifiable Problems and Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00103)
*Xun Lu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）方法，通过生成式奖励模型（GenRM）和自举相对策略优化（BRPO）算法，解决了非可验证任务（如创意写作）中的奖励建模问题，避免了传统标量奖励模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在非可验证任务（如创意写作）中依赖标量奖励模型，存在泛化能力差和奖励黑客问题，需要一种更可靠的奖励建模方法。

Method: 提出基于写作原则的成对生成式奖励模型（GenRM）和自举相对策略优化（BRPO）算法，将主观评估转化为可验证奖励。

Result: 方法在写作任务中表现优于标量奖励基线，展示了抗奖励黑客能力和竞争性结果。

Conclusion: RLVR框架有望统一基于规则、参考和无参考的奖励建模，为语言任务提供全面的强化学习训练范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has enabled large
language models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning tasks
with objective ground-truth answers, such as mathematics and code generation.
However, a significant gap remains for non-verifiable tasks, like creative
writing and open-ended dialogue, where quality assessment is inherently
subjective and lacks definitive references. Existing approaches for these
domains often rely on scalar reward models trained with human preferences,
which suffer from limited generalization and are prone to reward hacking, such
as over-explanation and length bias. In this work, we propose a unified
RLVR-based training paradigm that bridges the gap between non-verifiable tasks
and verifiable rewards. We introduce a writing-principle-based pairwise
Generative Reward Model (GenRM) and a novel Bootstrapped Relative Policy
Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. The pairwise writing GenRM leverages
self-principled critique to transform subjective assessments into reliable,
verifiable rewards, while BRPO enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise
comparison by leveraging a bootstrapped response as temporary reference from
within group rollouts during RL training. Our approach empowers LLMs to develop
robust writing capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by
Writing-Zero, which shows consistent improvement and strong resistance to
reward hacking compared to scalar reward baselines. Furthermore, our method
achieves competitive results on both in-house and open-source writing
benchmarks. Our findings suggest the potential to unify rule-based,
reference-based, and reference-free reward modeling under the RLVR framework,
thus paving the way for a comprehensive and scalable RL training paradigm
applicable across all language tasks.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了从临床文本中提取社会健康决定因素（SDOH）时，大型语言模型（LLMs）可能因依赖表面线索而产生虚假预测的问题，并提出缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SDOH提取对医疗分析至关重要，但LLMs可能因依赖表面线索（如提及酒精或吸烟）而错误预测药物使用状态，同时揭示模型性能中的性别差异。

Method: 使用SHAC数据集的MIMIC部分，以药物状态提取为例，评估LLMs的虚假预测问题，并测试提示工程和链式思维推理等缓解策略。

Result: 研究发现提及酒精或吸烟会误导模型预测药物使用，且模型性能存在性别差异；缓解策略（如提示工程）能减少虚假预测。

Conclusion: 通过优化提示设计和推理方法，可提升LLMs在医疗领域的可靠性。

Abstract: Social determinants of health (SDOH) extraction from clinical text is
critical for downstream healthcare analytics. Although large language models
(LLMs) have shown promise, they may rely on superficial cues leading to
spurious predictions. Using the MIMIC portion of the SHAC (Social History
Annotation Corpus) dataset and focusing on drug status extraction as a case
study, we demonstrate that mentions of alcohol or smoking can falsely induce
models to predict current/past drug use where none is present, while also
uncovering concerning gender disparities in model performance. We further
evaluate mitigation strategies - such as prompt engineering and
chain-of-thought reasoning - to reduce these false positives, providing
insights into enhancing LLM reliability in health domains.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了LaMP-QA基准，用于评估个性化长答案生成，填补了该领域资源不足的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化在问答系统中至关重要，但相关研究和资源匮乏，因此需要开发一个评估基准。

Method: 提出LaMP-QA基准，涵盖三大类问题，并进行人工与自动评估，比较不同策略。

Result: 实验显示，引入个性化上下文可使性能提升高达39%。

Conclusion: LaMP-QA基准为个性化问答研究提供了支持，未来可进一步推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Personalization is essential for question answering systems that are
user-centric. Despite its importance, personalization in answer generation has
been relatively underexplored. This is mainly due to lack of resources for
training and evaluating personalized question answering systems. We address
this gap by introducing LaMP-QA -- a benchmark designed for evaluating
personalized long-form answer generation. The benchmark covers questions from
three major categories: (1) Arts & Entertainment, (2) Lifestyle & Personal
Development, and (3) Society & Culture, encompassing over 45 subcategories in
total. To assess the quality and potential impact of the LaMP-QA benchmark for
personalized question answering, we conduct comprehensive human and automatic
evaluations, to compare multiple evaluation strategies for evaluating generated
personalized responses and measure their alignment with human preferences.
Furthermore, we benchmark a number of non-personalized and personalized
approaches based on open-source and proprietary large language models (LLMs).
Our results show that incorporating the personalized context provided leads to
performance improvements of up to 39%. The benchmark is publicly released to
support future research in this area.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Vedavani，首个专注于梵语吠陀诗歌的自动语音识别（ASR）研究，并提供了一个54小时的梵语ASR数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 梵语的音素复杂性和语音转换特性为ASR带来挑战，尤其是其诗歌形式的韵律和节奏特征尚未被充分研究。

Method: 研究构建了一个包含30,779个标记音频样本的数据集，并测试了多种多语言语音模型。

Result: 实验表明，IndicWhisper在现有模型中表现最佳。

Conclusion: Vedavani填补了梵语ASR研究的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Sanskrit, an ancient language with a rich linguistic heritage, presents
unique challenges for automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to its phonemic
complexity and the phonetic transformations that occur at word junctures,
similar to the connected speech found in natural conversations. Due to these
complexities, there has been limited exploration of ASR in Sanskrit,
particularly in the context of its poetic verses, which are characterized by
intricate prosodic and rhythmic patterns. This gap in research raises the
question: How can we develop an effective ASR system for Sanskrit, particularly
one that captures the nuanced features of its poetic form? In this study, we
introduce Vedavani, the first comprehensive ASR study focused on Sanskrit Vedic
poetry. We present a 54-hour Sanskrit ASR dataset, consisting of 30,779
labelled audio samples from the Rig Veda and Atharva Veda. This dataset
captures the precise prosodic and rhythmic features that define the language.
We also benchmark the dataset on various state-of-the-art multilingual speech
models.$^{1}$ Experimentation revealed that IndicWhisper performed the best
among the SOTA models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM推理和说服能力的提升，尤其是在DeepSeek R1和V3模型的推动下，LLM在社交推理游戏中的应用潜力增大，但现有方法依赖额外组件。

Method: 提出了一种基于LLM的狼人杀系统，结合优化的TTS模型，无需额外组件。

Result: 系统提升了与不同LLM模型的兼容性，并改善了用户参与感。

Conclusion: 随着LLM推理能力的持续增强，未来在狼人杀等游戏中，额外组件可能不再需要。

Abstract: The growing popularity of social deduction game systems for both business
applications and AI research has greatly benefited from the rapid advancements
in Large Language Models (LLMs), which now demonstrate stronger reasoning and
persuasion capabilities. Especially with the raise of DeepSeek R1 and V3
models, LLMs should enable a more engaging experience for human players in
LLM-agent-based social deduction games like Werewolf. Previous works either
fine-tuning, advanced prompting engineering, or additional experience pool to
achieve engaging text-format Werewolf game experience. We propose a novel yet
straightforward LLM-based Werewolf game system with tuned Text-to-Speech(TTS)
models designed for enhanced compatibility with various LLM models, and
improved user engagement. We argue with ever enhancing LLM reasoning, extra
components will be unnecessary in the case of Werewolf.

TL;DR: 研究发现，部分遵从策略（提供通用信息但不含可操作细节）能显著改善用户对LLM拒绝回答的负面感知，优于直接拒绝。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs因安全机制对所有潜在有害查询一概拒绝，导致用户体验与安全之间的权衡问题。

Method: 通过480名参与者评估3,840对查询-响应，分析不同拒绝策略对用户感知的影响，并评估9种LLMs的响应模式和6种奖励模型的评分。

Result: 部分遵从策略将负面用户感知降低50%以上，但现有LLMs和奖励模型未能充分利用此策略。

Conclusion: 有效的安全机制应注重设计细致的拒绝策略而非意图检测，以实现安全与用户体验的双赢。

Abstract: Current LLMs are trained to refuse potentially harmful input queries
regardless of whether users actually had harmful intents, causing a tradeoff
between safety and user experience. Through a study of 480 participants
evaluating 3,840 query-response pairs, we examine how different refusal
strategies affect user perceptions across varying motivations. Our findings
reveal that response strategy largely shapes user experience, while actual user
motivation has negligible impact. Partial compliance -- providing general
information without actionable details -- emerges as the optimal strategy,
reducing negative user perceptions by over 50% to flat-out refusals.
Complementing this, we analyze response patterns of 9 state-of-the-art LLMs and
evaluate how 6 reward models score different refusal strategies, demonstrating
that models rarely deploy partial compliance naturally and reward models
currently undervalue it. This work demonstrates that effective guardrails
require focusing on crafting thoughtful refusals rather than detecting intent,
offering a path toward AI safety mechanisms that ensure both safety and
sustained user engagement.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了轻量级编码器-解码器模型在结构化放射学报告中的潜力，相比大型语言模型（LLMs），其性能接近但计算资源消耗显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告缺乏标准化格式，限制了人类可读性和机器学习应用。大型语言模型虽强大，但计算成本高、透明度低且存在隐私问题。

Method: 使用轻量级T5和BERT2BERT模型（<300M参数）对MIMIC-CXR和CheXpert Plus数据集进行结构化处理，并与8个开源LLMs（1B-70B）进行对比。

Result: 轻量级模型在人工标注测试集上优于基于提示技术的LLMs。部分LoRA微调的LLMs在Findings部分略有提升，但计算资源消耗显著增加。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型是资源受限医疗环境中结构化临床文本的可持续、隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Radiology reports are critical for clinical decision-making but often lack a
standardized format, limiting both human interpretability and machine learning
(ML) applications. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
capabilities in reformatting clinical text, their high computational
requirements, lack of transparency, and data privacy concerns hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we explore lightweight encoder-decoder
models (<300M parameters)-specifically T5 and BERT2BERT-for structuring
radiology reports from the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus datasets. We benchmark
these models against eight open-source LLMs (1B-70B), adapted using prefix
prompting, in-context learning (ICL), and low-rank adaptation (LoRA)
finetuning. Our best-performing lightweight model outperforms all LLMs adapted
using prompt-based techniques on a human-annotated test set. While some
LoRA-finetuned LLMs achieve modest gains over the lightweight model on the
Findings section (BLEU 6.4%, ROUGE-L 4.8%, BERTScore 3.6%, F1-RadGraph 1.1%,
GREEN 3.6%, and F1-SRR-BERT 4.3%), these improvements come at the cost of
substantially greater computational resources. For example, LLaMA-3-70B
incurred more than 400 times the inference time, cost, and carbon emissions
compared to the lightweight model. These results underscore the potential of
lightweight, task-specific models as sustainable and privacy-preserving
solutions for structuring clinical text in resource-constrained healthcare
settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AST-FIM是一种利用抽象语法树（AST）进行代码预训练的新方法，相比传统的随机字符掩码方法，它能更好地捕捉代码结构和编辑模式，并在实际任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLM）将代码视为纯文本并随机掩码字符，忽略了代码的结构特性，导致训练示例不够连贯。

Method: 提出AST-FIM方法，通过AST掩码完整的语法结构（如代码块、表达式或函数），生成更符合代码结构和编辑模式的训练示例。

Result: 在1B和8B参数模型上，AST-FIM在标准FIM基准测试中比随机字符FIM方法高出5分。

Conclusion: AST-FIM通过利用代码结构信息，显著提升了代码填充任务的性能，适用于实际代码编辑场景。

Abstract: Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) is a common pretraining method for code LLMs, where
models complete code segments given surrounding context. However, existing LLMs
treat code as plain text and mask random character spans. We propose and
evaluate AST-FIM, a pretraining strategy that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees
(ASTs) to mask complete syntactic structures at scale, ensuring coherent
training examples better aligned with universal code structures and common code
editing patterns such as blocks, expressions, or functions. To evaluate
real-world fill-in-the-middle (FIM) programming tasks, we introduce
Real-FIM-Eval, a benchmark derived from 30,000+ GitHub commits across 12
languages. On infilling tasks, experiments on 1B and 8B parameter models show
that AST-FIM is particularly beneficial for real-world code editing as it
outperforms standard random-character FIM by up to 5 pts on standard FIM
benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: REIC是一种基于检索增强生成的意图分类方法，解决了传统方法在大规模客户服务中的扩展性问题，无需频繁重新训练即可实现精确分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着企业产品线的扩展，意图分类面临意图数量增加和分类体系多样化的挑战，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: REIC利用检索增强生成（RAG）动态整合相关知识，提升分类准确性。

Result: 实验表明，REIC在真实数据集上优于传统微调、零样本和少样本方法，适用于大规模场景。

Conclusion: REIC在域内和域外场景中均表现优异，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Accurate intent classification is critical for efficient routing in customer
service, ensuring customers are connected with the most suitable agents while
reducing handling times and operational costs. However, as companies expand
their product lines, intent classification faces scalability challenges due to
the increasing number of intents and variations in taxonomy across different
verticals. In this paper, we introduce REIC, a Retrieval-augmented generation
Enhanced Intent Classification approach, which addresses these challenges
effectively. REIC leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to dynamically
incorporate relevant knowledge, enabling precise classification without the
need for frequent retraining. Through extensive experiments on real-world
datasets, we demonstrate that REIC outperforms traditional fine-tuning,
zero-shot, and few-shot methods in large-scale customer service settings. Our
results highlight its effectiveness in both in-domain and out-of-domain
scenarios, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment in adaptive
and large-scale intent classification systems.

TL;DR: ComposeRAG提出了一种模块化的RAG系统设计，通过分解核心功能为独立模块，提升了多跳问答的准确性、可解释性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统设计过于单一，核心功能耦合度高，限制了可解释性、系统评估和针对性改进，尤其是在复杂多跳问答任务中。

Method: ComposeRAG将RAG流程分解为原子化、可组合的模块（如问题分解、查询重写、检索决策和答案验证），并引入自反机制以增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在四个多跳问答基准测试中，ComposeRAG在准确性和答案可靠性上均优于基线方法，最高提升15%的准确率和10%的答案可靠性。

Conclusion: ComposeRAG通过模块化设计实现了灵活、透明、可扩展且高性能的多跳推理，显著提升了答案可靠性和可解释性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly diverse, yet
many suffer from monolithic designs that tightly couple core functions like
query reformulation, retrieval, reasoning, and verification. This limits their
interpretability, systematic evaluation, and targeted improvement, especially
for complex multi-hop question answering. We introduce ComposeRAG, a novel
modular abstraction that decomposes RAG pipelines into atomic, composable
modules. Each module, such as Question Decomposition, Query Rewriting,
Retrieval Decision, and Answer Verification, acts as a parameterized
transformation on structured inputs/outputs, allowing independent
implementation, upgrade, and analysis. To enhance robustness against errors in
multi-step reasoning, ComposeRAG incorporates a self-reflection mechanism that
iteratively revisits and refines earlier steps upon verification failure.
Evaluated on four challenging multi-hop QA benchmarks, ComposeRAG consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both accuracy and grounding fidelity.
Specifically, it achieves up to a 15% accuracy improvement over
fine-tuning-based methods and up to a 5% gain over reasoning-specialized
pipelines under identical retrieval conditions. Crucially, ComposeRAG
significantly enhances grounding: its verification-first design reduces
ungrounded answers by over 10% in low-quality retrieval settings, and by
approximately 3% even with strong corpora. Comprehensive ablation studies
validate the modular architecture, demonstrating distinct and additive
contributions from each component. These findings underscore ComposeRAG's
capacity to deliver flexible, transparent, scalable, and high-performing
multi-hop reasoning with improved grounding and interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在医疗决策中存在局限性，要么依赖任务特定模型，要么缺乏专业知识和工具的基础。MedOrch旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MedOrch采用模块化、基于代理的架构，灵活集成领域工具，并确保透明和可追溯的推理过程。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病诊断、胸部X光解读和医学视觉问答等任务中，MedOrch表现优异，准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: MedOrch通过推理驱动的工具利用，为多模态医疗数据处理和复杂临床决策任务提供了潜力。

Abstract: Healthcare decision-making represents one of the most challenging domains for
Artificial Intelligence (AI), requiring the integration of diverse knowledge
sources, complex reasoning, and various external analytical tools. Current AI
systems often rely on either task-specific models, which offer limited
adaptability, or general language models without grounding with specialized
external knowledge and tools. We introduce MedOrch, a novel framework that
orchestrates multiple specialized tools and reasoning agents to provide
comprehensive medical decision support. MedOrch employs a modular, agent-based
architecture that facilitates the flexible integration of domain-specific tools
without altering the core system. Furthermore, it ensures transparent and
traceable reasoning processes, enabling clinicians to meticulously verify each
intermediate step underlying the system's recommendations. We evaluate MedOrch
across three distinct medical applications: Alzheimer's disease diagnosis,
chest X-ray interpretation, and medical visual question answering, using
authentic clinical datasets. The results demonstrate MedOrch's competitive
performance across these diverse medical tasks. Notably, in Alzheimer's disease
diagnosis, MedOrch achieves an accuracy of 93.26%, surpassing the
state-of-the-art baseline by over four percentage points. For predicting
Alzheimer's disease progression, it attains a 50.35% accuracy, marking a
significant improvement. In chest X-ray analysis, MedOrch exhibits superior
performance with a Macro AUC of 61.2% and a Macro F1-score of 25.5%. Moreover,
in complex multimodal visual question answering (Image+Table), MedOrch achieves
an accuracy of 54.47%. These findings underscore MedOrch's potential to advance
healthcare AI by enabling reasoning-driven tool utilization for multimodal
medical data processing and supporting intricate cognitive tasks in clinical
decision-making.

Result: 闭源通用模型在波斯语和英语中表现最佳，而波斯语微调模型表现不佳；翻译对性能有影响。

Conclusion: 模型大小不足以确保稳健性能，需结合领域或语言适应；PersianMedQA为多语言医学推理评估提供了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide
range of NLP benchmarks, often surpassing human-level accuracy. However, their
reliability in high-stakes domains such as medicine, particularly in
low-resource languages, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce
PersianMedQA, a large-scale, expert-validated dataset of multiple-choice
Persian medical questions, designed to evaluate LLMs across both Persian and
English. We benchmark over 40 state-of-the-art models, including
general-purpose, Persian fine-tuned, and medical LLMs, in zero-shot and
chain-of-thought (CoT) settings. Our results show that closed-source general
models (e.g., GPT-4.1) consistently outperform all other categories, achieving
83.3% accuracy in Persian and 80.7% in English, while Persian fine-tuned models
such as Dorna underperform significantly (e.g., 35.9% in Persian), often
struggling with both instruction-following and domain reasoning. We also
analyze the impact of translation, showing that while English performance is
generally higher, Persian responses are sometimes more accurate due to cultural
and clinical contextual cues. Finally, we demonstrate that model size alone is
insufficient for robust performance without strong domain or language
adaptation. PersianMedQA provides a foundation for evaluating multilingual and
culturally grounded medical reasoning in LLMs. The PersianMedQA dataset can be

Motivation: 探讨对齐语言模型在显性和隐性偏见评估中的不一致现象，揭示对齐过程如何放大隐性偏见，并提出更有效的偏见缓解方法。

Method: 通过分析对齐和未对齐语言模型的内部表征，发现对齐模型在模糊上下文中忽略种族概念。基于这一发现，提出一种新的偏见缓解策略，即在早期模型层中激励种族概念的表征。

Result: 研究发现对齐模型在早期表征中忽略种族概念，导致隐性偏见放大。提出的新策略能有效减少隐性偏见，优于传统的机器遗忘方法。

Conclusion: 忽略种族概念的表征会无意中放大语言模型的隐性偏见。通过激励早期层表征种族概念，可以更有效地缓解偏见，类似于人类对种族盲点的修正。

Abstract: Although value-aligned language models (LMs) appear unbiased in explicit bias
evaluations, they often exhibit stereotypes in implicit word association tasks,
raising concerns about their fair usage. We investigate the mechanisms behind
this discrepancy and find that alignment surprisingly amplifies implicit bias
in model outputs. Specifically, we show that aligned LMs, unlike their
unaligned counterparts, overlook racial concepts in early internal
representations when the context is ambiguous. Not representing race likely
fails to activate safety guardrails, leading to unintended biases. Inspired by
this insight, we propose a new bias mitigation strategy that works by
incentivizing the representation of racial concepts in the early model layers.
In contrast to conventional mitigation methods of machine unlearning, our
interventions find that steering the model to be more aware of racial concepts
effectively mitigates implicit bias. Similar to race blindness in humans,
ignoring racial nuances can inadvertently perpetuate subtle biases in LMs.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在招聘过程中对残疾信息的潜在偏见，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过模拟招聘场景，比较LLM对披露、未披露及无残疾信息的候选人的选择偏好。

Result: LLM倾向于选择明确表示无残疾的候选人，即使其他条件相同。

Conclusion: LLM在招聘中可能对残疾信息存在偏见，需进一步研究和改进。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into hiring
processes, concerns about fairness have gained prominence. When applying for
jobs, companies often request/require demographic information, including
gender, race, and disability or veteran status. This data is collected to
support diversity and inclusion initiatives, but when provided to LLMs,
especially disability-related information, it raises concerns about potential
biases in candidate selection outcomes. Many studies have highlighted how
disability can impact CV screening, yet little research has explored the
specific effect of voluntarily disclosed information on LLM-driven candidate
selection. This study seeks to bridge that gap. When candidates shared
identical gender, race, qualifications, experience, and backgrounds, and sought
jobs with minimal employment rate gaps between individuals with and without
disabilities (e.g., Cashier, Software Developer), LLMs consistently favored
candidates who disclosed that they had no disability. Even in cases where
candidates chose not to disclose their disability status, the LLMs were less
likely to select them compared to those who explicitly stated they did not have
a disability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在高风险领域的广泛应用，其检测错误假设和进行批判性推理的能力对确保输出可靠性至关重要。

Method: 通过MultiHoax基准测试，评估LLMs在多跳推理任务中检测错误前提的能力，数据集覆盖七个国家和十个知识类别。

Result: 实验表明，当前最先进的LLMs在不同国家、知识类别和多跳推理类型中检测错误前提的能力较弱。

Conclusion: 需要提升LLMs的错误前提检测能力和多跳推理能力，以确保其在复杂任务中的可靠性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains,
their ability to detect false assumptions and reason critically is crucial for
ensuring reliable outputs. False-premise questions (FPQs) serve as an important
evaluation method by exposing cases where flawed assumptions lead to incorrect
responses. While existing benchmarks focus on single-hop FPQs, real-world
reasoning often requires multi-hop inference, where models must verify
consistency across multiple reasoning steps rather than relying on
surface-level cues. To address this gap, we introduce MultiHoax, a benchmark
for evaluating LLMs' ability to handle false premises in complex, multi-step
reasoning tasks. Our dataset spans seven countries and ten diverse knowledge
categories, using Wikipedia as the primary knowledge source to enable factual
reasoning across regions. Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs
struggle to detect false premises across different countries, knowledge
categories, and multi-hop reasoning types, highlighting the need for improved
false premise detection and more robust multi-hop reasoning capabilities in
LLMs.

### [30] [Hierarchical Level-Wise News Article Clustering via Multilingual Matryoshka Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00277)
*Hans W. A. Hanley,Zakir Durumeric*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多语言Matryoshka嵌入的可扩展、可解释的层次聚类方法，用于新闻和社交媒体数据的主题建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在扩展性、透明度和多语言处理方面存在不足。

Method: 训练多语言Matryoshka嵌入模型，开发高效层次聚类算法。

Result: 嵌入模型在SemEval 2022 Task 8测试集上达到最佳性能（Pearson ρ = 0.816）。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别和聚类新闻数据中的故事、叙事和主题。

Abstract: Contextual large language model embeddings are increasingly utilized for
topic modeling and clustering. However, current methods often scale poorly,
rely on opaque similarity metrics, and struggle in multilingual settings. In
this work, we present a novel, scalable, interpretable, hierarchical, and
multilingual approach to clustering news articles and social media data. To do
this, we first train multilingual Matryoshka embeddings that can determine
story similarity at varying levels of granularity based on which subset of the
dimensions of the embeddings is examined. This embedding model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the SemEval 2022 Task 8 test dataset (Pearson
$\rho$ = 0.816). Once trained, we develop an efficient hierarchical clustering
algorithm that leverages the hierarchical nature of Matryoshka embeddings to
identify unique news stories, narratives, and themes. We conclude by
illustrating how our approach can identify and cluster stories, narratives, and
overarching themes within real-world news datasets.

### [31] [Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models under Continued Pretraining for Language Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00288)
*Ahmed Elhady,Eneko Agirre,Mikel Artetxe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在语言模型持续预训练（CPT）中，加入英语数据对验证困惑度无影响，但对目标语言下游任务能力至关重要。未加入英语会导致灾难性遗忘，影响模型泛化能力。提出课程学习和权重指数移动平均（EMA）作为替代方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨在语言模型持续预训练中，英语数据的作用及其对目标语言能力的影响。

Method: 通过语言无关的上下文学习（ICL）基准测试，分析英语数据的作用，并提出课程学习和EMA方法。

Result: 未加入英语数据会导致灾难性遗忘，影响模型泛化能力；课程学习和EMA能有效缓解这一问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了英语数据在CPT中的关键作用，为未来设计更有效的语言适应方法提供了基础。

Abstract: Continued pretraining (CPT) is a popular approach to adapt existing large
language models (LLMs) to new languages. When doing so, it is common practice
to include a portion of English data in the mixture, but its role has not been
carefully studied to date. In this work, we show that including English does
not impact validation perplexity, yet it is critical for the emergence of
downstream capabilities in the target language. We introduce a
language-agnostic benchmark for in-context learning (ICL), which reveals
catastrophic forgetting early on CPT when English is not included. This in turn
damages the ability of the model to generalize to downstream prompts in the
target language as measured by perplexity, even if it does not manifest in
terms of accuracy until later in training, and can be tied to a big shift in
the model parameters. Based on these insights, we introduce curriculum learning
and exponential moving average (EMA) of weights as effective alternatives to
mitigate the need for English. All in all, our work sheds light into the
dynamics by which emergent abilities arise when doing CPT for language
adaptation, and can serve as a foundation to design more effective methods in
the future.

*Tianqi Chen,Shujian Zhang,Mingyuan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DLM-One是一种基于分数蒸馏的框架，用于一步生成序列，通过连续扩散语言模型（DLMs）实现，显著提升采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究是否可以通过一步生成替代迭代细化，以提高语言建模的采样效率。

Method: 通过将学生模型输出在连续标记嵌入空间中的分数与预训练教师DLM的分数函数对齐，实现一步生成。

Result: 在DiffuSeq上实验显示，DLM-One推理时间最高可提速500倍，同时在基准文本生成任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 一步扩散为高效、高质量语言生成及连续扩散模型在自然语言处理中的广泛应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces DLM-One, a score-distillation-based framework for
one-step sequence generation with continuous diffusion language models (DLMs).
DLM-One eliminates the need for iterative refinement by aligning the scores of
a student model's outputs in the continuous token embedding space with the
score function of a pretrained teacher DLM. We investigate whether DLM-One can
achieve substantial gains in sampling efficiency for language modeling. Through
comprehensive experiments on DiffuSeq -- a representative continuous DLM -- we
show that DLM-One achieves up to ~500x speedup in inference time while
maintaining competitive performance on benchmark text generation tasks used to
evaluate the teacher models. We further analyze the method's empirical behavior
across multiple datasets, providing initial insights into its generality and
practical applicability. Our findings position one-step diffusion as a
promising direction for efficient, high-quality language generation and broader
adoption of continuous diffusion models operating in embedding space for
natural language processing.

### [33] [Can LLMs Understand Unvoiced Speech? Exploring EMG-to-Text Conversion with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00304)
*Payal Mohapatra,Akash Pandey,Xiaoyuan Zhang,Qi Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型EMG适配器模块，将无声音的EMG信号映射到大型语言模型（LLM）的输入空间，显著提升了无声音EMG到文本的转换性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖有声和无声音EMG信号的配对数据，对无法发声的个体不实用，因此探索LLM在无声音语音识别中的潜力。

Method: 提出EMG适配器模块，将EMG特征映射到LLM输入空间，仅使用无声音EMG数据进行训练。

Result: 在封闭词汇任务中，平均词错误率（WER）为0.49；仅用六分钟数据，性能提升近20%。

Conclusion: 这是LLM理解无声音EMG信号的重要第一步，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Unvoiced electromyography (EMG) is an effective communication tool for
individuals unable to produce vocal speech. However, most prior methods rely on
paired voiced and unvoiced EMG signals, along with speech data, for EMG-to-text
conversion, which is not practical for such individuals. Given the rise of
large language models (LLMs) in speech recognition, we explore their potential
to understand unvoiced speech. To this end, we address the challenge of
learning from unvoiced EMG alone and propose a novel EMG adaptor module that
maps EMG features into an LLM's input space, achieving an average word error
rate (WER) of 0.49 on a closed-vocabulary unvoiced EMG-to-text task. Even with
a conservative data availability of just six minutes, our approach improves
performance over specialized models by nearly 20%. While LLMs have been shown
to be extendable to new language modalities -- such as audio -- understanding
articulatory biosignals like unvoiced EMG remains more challenging. This work
takes a crucial first step toward enabling LLMs to comprehend unvoiced speech
using surface EMG.

*John Harvill,Ziwei Fan,Hao Wang,Yizhou Sun,Hao Ding,Luke Huan,Anoop Deoras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种任务无关的无损压缩技术，类似LZ77，平均减少输入token序列长度27%和18%，同时保留所有语义信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有提示压缩方法多为有损，专注于保留下游任务相关语义信息，但可能丢失其他信息。本文旨在探索无损压缩的可能性。

Method: 采用类似LZ77的无损压缩技术，通过减少token序列长度降低计算量，同时确保语义信息完整。

Result: 在两个评估任务中，压缩后token序列长度分别减少27%和18%，计算量减少47%和33%。无损压缩性能接近未压缩输入。

Conclusion: 无损压缩技术在小模型上性能接近未压缩输入，推测更大模型和计算资源可完全消除差距。

Abstract: Existing work on prompt compression for Large Language Models (LLM) focuses
on lossy methods that try to maximize the retention of semantic information
that is relevant to downstream tasks while significantly reducing the sequence
length. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic lossless compression
technique similar to LZ77 that makes it possible to reduce the input token
sequence length on average by 27\% and 18\% for the two evaluation tasks
explored here. Given that we use transformer-based LLMs, this equates to 47\%
and 33\% less encoding computation, respectively, due to the quadratic nature
of attention. The token sequence transformation is trivial to reverse and
highlights that no semantic information is lost in the process. We evaluate our
proposed approach on two tasks that require strict preservation of
semantics/syntax and demonstrate that existing lossy compression methods
perform poorly in this setting. We find that our lossless compression technique
produces only a small gap in performance compared to using the uncompressed
input and posit that larger models and an expanded computing budget would
likely erase the gap entirely.

### [35] [An evaluation of LLMs for generating movie reviews: GPT-4o, Gemini-2.0 and DeepSeek-V3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00312)
*Brendan Sands,Yining Wang,Chenhao Xu,Yuxuan Zhou,Lai Wei,Rohitash Chandra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种利用三种大语言模型（GPT-4o、DeepSeek-V3和Gemini-2.0）生成电影评论的框架，并通过与IMDb用户评论对比评估其性能。结果表明，LLM生成的评论在语法和结构上表现良好，但在情感丰富性和风格一致性上仍有差距。DeepSeek-V3表现最平衡，GPT-4o偏向积极情感，Gemini-2.0则更擅长捕捉负面情感但情感强度过高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在电影评论生成任务中的适用性，并评估其与真实用户评论的差距。

Method: 使用电影字幕和剧本作为输入，通过三种LLM生成评论，并从词汇、情感极性、相似性和主题一致性等方面与IMDb用户评论进行对比分析。

Result: LLM生成的评论在语法和结构上表现良好，但在情感丰富性和风格一致性上不及IMDb评论。DeepSeek-V3表现最接近真实评论，GPT-4o偏向积极情感，Gemini-2.0则情感强度过高。

Conclusion: LLM在电影评论生成任务中具有潜力，但需进一步优化以提升情感丰富性和风格一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been prominent in various tasks, including
text generation and summarisation. The applicability of LLMs to the generation
of product reviews is gaining momentum, paving the way for the generation of
movie reviews. In this study, we propose a framework that generates movie
reviews using three LLMs (GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, and Gemini-2.0), and evaluate
their performance by comparing the generated outputs with IMDb user reviews. We
use movie subtitles and screenplays as input to the LLMs and investigate how
they affect the quality of reviews generated. We review the LLM-based movie
reviews in terms of vocabulary, sentiment polarity, similarity, and thematic
consistency in comparison to IMDB user reviews. The results demonstrate that
LLMs are capable of generating syntactically fluent and structurally complete
movie reviews. Nevertheless, there is still a noticeable gap in emotional
richness and stylistic coherence between LLM-generated and IMDb reviews,
suggesting that further refinement is needed to improve the overall quality of
movie review generation. We provided a survey-based analysis where participants
were told to distinguish between LLM and IMDb user reviews. The results show
that LLM-generated reviews are difficult to distinguish from IMDB user reviews.
We found that DeepSeek-V3 produced the most balanced reviews, closely matching
IMDb reviews. GPT-4o overemphasised positive emotions, while Gemini-2.0
captured negative emotions better but showed excessive emotional intensity.

*Yufei Tian,Jiao Sun,Nanyun Peng,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SkillVerse是一个无监督的树状诊断框架，用于评估语言模型在特定技能上的表现，并通过树搜索算法提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型处理复杂任务的能力增强，需要更精细的评估方法来理解模型的具体能力，以指导模型开发。

Method: SkillVerse利用LLM作为评判者，分析模型响应并将其组织为层次化的树状结构（dendrogram），支持任意粒度的能力评估。

Result: SkillVerse在两项任务中表现优异：1）通过树搜索算法提升模型上下文学习能力25%；2）预测模型弱点的准确率提高22%。

Conclusion: SkillVerse提供了一种灵活且有效的方法，用于深入理解语言模型的能力，并在实际应用中显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: As language models evolve to tackle complex, multifaceted tasks, their
evaluation must adapt to capture this intricacy. A granular, skill-specific
understanding of model capabilities can empower researchers to make informed
model development plans. In this paper, we introduce SkillVerse, an
unsupervised tree-structured diagnosis framework for understanding model
proficiency in specific abilities. With LLM as a judge, SkillVerse first
critiques the model responses, and then organizes them into a hierarchical
structure termed dendrogram. Given proficiency at arbitrary levels of
granularity, SkillVerse is flexible to produce insights of behaviors of modern
large models. We also demonstrate its efficacy in two downstream tasks: 1)
improving model in-context learning by 25% using a tree-search algorithm to
select more informative few-shot demonstrations, and 2) accurately predicting
new model weaknesses with a 55% success rate, 22% higher than without
SkillVerse.

*Boyi Zhang,Zhuo Liu,Hangfeng He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TreeRare是一种基于语法树的检索与推理框架，通过分解复杂问题为子组件并逐步解决，显著提升了知识密集型问题的回答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在处理复杂、知识密集型问题时因推理错误和检索结果不匹配导致的性能限制。

Method: 利用语法树自底向上遍历，生成子组件查询并检索相关段落，通过子组件问答模块合成证据，最终聚合形成答案。

Result: 在五个涉及模糊或多跳推理的问答数据集上，TreeRare显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TreeRare通过语法树引导的检索与推理，有效解决了复杂问题回答中的性能瓶颈。

Abstract: In real practice, questions are typically complex and knowledge-intensive,
requiring Large Language Models (LLMs) to recognize the multifaceted nature of
the question and reason across multiple information sources. Iterative and
adaptive retrieval, where LLMs decide when and what to retrieve based on their
reasoning, has been shown to be a promising approach to resolve complex,
knowledge-intensive questions. However, the performance of such retrieval
frameworks is limited by the accumulation of reasoning errors and misaligned
retrieval results. To overcome these limitations, we propose TreeRare (Syntax
Tree-Guided Retrieval and Reasoning), a framework that utilizes syntax trees to
guide information retrieval and reasoning for question answering. Following the
principle of compositionality, TreeRare traverses the syntax tree in a
bottom-up fashion, and in each node, it generates subcomponent-based queries
and retrieves relevant passages to resolve localized uncertainty. A
subcomponent question answering module then synthesizes these passages into
concise, context-aware evidence. Finally, TreeRare aggregates the evidence
across the tree to form a final answer. Experiments across five question
answering datasets involving ambiguous or multi-hop reasoning demonstrate that
TreeRare achieves substantial improvements over existing state-of-the-art
methods.

*Svetlana Churina,Akshat Gupta,Insyirah Mujtahid,Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个标注的通用语料库Codemix Corpus，用于研究多语言混合现象，包含35万+条消息，支持计算语言学和社会语言学等研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏公开的、标注的多语言混合语料库，尤其是在社交媒体等非正式交流中，限制了相关研究的发展。

Method: 通过持续收集、验证和整合多语言混合消息，构建结构化数据集（JSON格式），并提供详细元数据和语言统计。

Result: 已收集355,641条多语言混合消息，涵盖英语、普通话等多种语言模式。

Conclusion: Codemix Corpus将成为计算语言学、社会语言学和NLP应用的基础数据集。

Abstract: Code-mixing involves the seamless integration of linguistic elements from
multiple languages within a single discourse, reflecting natural multilingual
communication patterns. Despite its prominence in informal interactions such as
social media, chat messages and instant-messaging exchanges, there has been a
lack of publicly available corpora that are author-labeled and suitable for
modeling human conversations and relationships. This study introduces the first
labeled and general-purpose corpus for understanding code-mixing in context
while maintaining rigorous privacy and ethical standards. Our live project will
continuously gather, verify, and integrate code-mixed messages into a
structured dataset released in JSON format, accompanied by detailed metadata
and linguistic statistics. To date, it includes over 355,641 messages spanning
various code-mixing patterns, with a primary focus on English, Mandarin, and
other languages. We expect the Codemix Corpus to serve as a foundational
dataset for research in computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, and NLP
applications.

### [39] [Beyond Context to Cognitive Appraisal: Emotion Reasoning as a Theory of Mind Benchmark for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00334)
*Gerard Christopher Yeo,Kokil Jaidka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何利用上下文信息推理他人情绪状态，基于心理理论（ToM）框架，发现LLMs具备一定推理能力，但在关联情境结果与特定情绪方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于文本中可能存在隐蔽的上下文线索，需要高阶推理能力来推断情绪状态，而非仅识别显性情绪。

Method: 基于认知评估理论，构建了一个专门的ToM评估数据集，评估LLMs的前向推理（从上下文到情绪）和后向推理（从情绪到推断上下文）能力。

Result: 结果表明，LLMs具备一定推理能力，但在关联情境结果与特定情绪方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在情绪推理任务中，心理学理论对LLMs训练和评估的重要性。

Abstract: Datasets used for emotion recognition tasks typically contain overt cues that
can be used in predicting the emotions expressed in a text. However, one
challenge is that texts sometimes contain covert contextual cues that are rich
in affective semantics, which warrant higher-order reasoning abilities to infer
emotional states, not simply the emotions conveyed. This study advances beyond
surface-level perceptual features to investigate how large language models
(LLMs) reason about others' emotional states using contextual information,
within a Theory-of-Mind (ToM) framework. Grounded in Cognitive Appraisal
Theory, we curate a specialized ToM evaluation dataset1 to assess both forward
reasoning - from context to emotion- and backward reasoning - from emotion to
inferred context. We showed that LLMs can reason to a certain extent, although
they are poor at associating situational outcomes and appraisals with specific
emotions. Our work highlights the need for psychological theories in the
training and evaluation of LLMs in the context of emotion reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决OWSM项目训练数据不足的问题，并处理YODAS数据集的语言标签和音频-文本对齐问题。

Method: 开发可扩展的数据清洗流程，整合YODAS数据集，训练新的OWSM v4模型。

Result: 新模型在多语言基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越Whisper和MMS等工业模型。

Conclusion: 公开清洗后的YODAS数据集、预训练模型及相关脚本，推动开源语音模型发展。

Abstract: The Open Whisper-style Speech Models (OWSM) project has developed a series of
fully open speech foundation models using academic-scale resources, but their
training data remains insufficient. This work enhances OWSM by integrating
YODAS, a large-scale web-crawled dataset with a Creative Commons license.
However, incorporating YODAS is nontrivial due to its wild nature, which
introduces challenges such as incorrect language labels and audio-text
misalignments. To address this, we develop a scalable data-cleaning pipeline
using public toolkits, yielding a dataset with 166,000 hours of speech across
75 languages. Our new series of OWSM v4 models, trained on this curated dataset
alongside existing OWSM data, significantly outperform previous versions on
multilingual benchmarks. Our models even match or surpass frontier industrial
models like Whisper and MMS in multiple scenarios. We will publicly release the
cleaned YODAS data, pre-trained models, and all associated scripts via the
ESPnet toolkit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部模型进行语义聚类，导致计算开销大且难以捕捉上下文语义，因此需要一种更高效且上下文敏感的方法。

Method: 提出潜在语义聚类（LSC），利用生成LLM的内部隐藏状态进行聚类，避免使用外部模型。

Result: 实验表明，LSC在多种LLM和数据集上显著提高了计算效率，同时性能优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: LSC是一种高效且上下文敏感的语义聚类方法，适用于测试时计算扩展。

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation--generating and analyzing multiple or
sequential outputs for a single input--has become a promising strategy for
improving the reliability and quality of large language models (LLMs), as
evidenced by advances in uncertainty quantification and multi-step reasoning. A
key shared component is semantic clustering, which groups outputs that differ
in form but convey the same meaning. Semantic clustering enables estimation of
the distribution over the semantics of outputs and helps avoid redundant
exploration of reasoning paths. However, existing approaches typically rely on
external models, which introduce substantial computational overhead and often
fail to capture context-aware semantics. We propose Latent Semantic Clustering
(LSC), a lightweight and context-sensitive method that leverages the generator
LLM's internal hidden states for clustering, eliminating the need for external
models. Our extensive experiment across various LLMs and datasets shows that
LSC significantly improves the computational efficiency of test-time scaling
while maintaining or exceeding the performance of existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经信号解码连续语言的挑战，推动脑机接口和神经解码技术的应用。

Result: 仅需30分钟神经数据即可表现优异，在低数据场景下超越现有方法。

Conclusion: Neuro2Semantic展示了实际应用的潜力，尤其在脑机接口领域。

Abstract: Decoding continuous language from neural signals remains a significant
challenge in the intersection of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. We
introduce Neuro2Semantic, a novel framework that reconstructs the semantic
content of perceived speech from intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings. Our
approach consists of two phases: first, an LSTM-based adapter aligns neural
signals with pre-trained text embeddings; second, a corrector module generates
continuous, natural text directly from these aligned embeddings. This flexible
method overcomes the limitations of previous decoding approaches and enables
unconstrained text generation. Neuro2Semantic achieves strong performance with
as little as 30 minutes of neural data, outperforming a recent state-of-the-art
method in low-data settings. These results highlight the potential for
practical applications in brain-computer interfaces and neural decoding
technologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准化患者模拟成本高且不灵活，现有虚拟患者系统无法根据学员沟通能力动态调整行为。

Method: 提出Adaptive-VP框架，结合临床场景构建和实时评估模块，动态调整虚拟患者反应。

Result: 自动评估显示框架能反映真实沟通水平，专家认为其交互更自然。

Conclusion: Adaptive-VP是一种可扩展且有效的护士沟通培训工具。

Abstract: Effective communication training is essential to preparing nurses for
high-quality patient care. While standardized patient (SP) simulations provide
valuable experiential learning, they are often costly and inflexible. Virtual
patient (VP) systems offer a scalable alternative, but most fail to adapt to
the varying communication skills of trainees. In particular, when trainees
respond ineffectively, VPs should escalate in hostility or become
uncooperative--yet this level of adaptive interaction remains largely
unsupported. To address this gap, we introduce Adaptive-VP, a VP dialogue
generation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to dynamically
adapt VP behavior based on trainee input. The framework features a pipeline for
constructing clinically grounded yet flexible VP scenarios and a modular system
for assessing trainee communication and adjusting VP responses in real time,
while ensuring learner safety. We validated Adaptive-VP by simulating
challenging patient conversations. Automated evaluation using a corpus from
practicing nurses showed that our communication skill evaluation mechanism
reflected real-world proficiency levels. Expert nurses further confirmed that
Adaptive-VP produced more natural and realistic interactions than existing
approaches, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and effective tool for
nursing communication training.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SHARE是一种基于SLM的分层动作校正助手，通过将声明式SQL查询转换为逐步动作轨迹，提升LLM在文本到SQL任务中的自我校正能力，同时减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL的自我校正方法存在计算开销大和LLM难以有效检测和修正SQL查询的问题。

Method: SHARE通过三个专用SLM的流水线，将SQL查询转换为逐步动作轨迹，并进行两阶段细化，同时采用分层自进化策略进行高效训练。

Result: 实验表明，SHARE显著提升了自我校正能力，并在低资源训练环境下保持强健性能。

Conclusion: SHARE为文本到SQL任务提供了一种高效且鲁棒的自我校正解决方案，尤其适用于数据隐私受限的场景。

Abstract: Current self-correction approaches in text-to-SQL face two critical
limitations: 1) Conventional self-correction methods rely on recursive
self-calls of LLMs, resulting in multiplicative computational overhead, and 2)
LLMs struggle to implement effective error detection and correction for
declarative SQL queries, as they fail to demonstrate the underlying reasoning
path. In this work, we propose SHARE, an SLM-based Hierarchical Action
corREction assistant that enables LLMs to perform more precise error
localization and efficient correction. SHARE orchestrates three specialized
Small Language Models (SLMs) in a sequential pipeline, where it first
transforms declarative SQL queries into stepwise action trajectories that
reveal underlying reasoning, followed by a two-phase granular refinement. We
further propose a novel hierarchical self-evolution strategy for data-efficient
training. Experimental results demonstrate that SHARE effectively enhances
self-correction capabilities while proving robust across various LLMs.
Furthermore, our comprehensive analysis shows that SHARE maintains strong
performance even in low-resource training settings, which is particularly
valuable for text-to-SQL applications with data privacy constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在LLM决策中过于注重性能而忽略成本效益平衡，需改进。

Method: 引入3E标准评估搜索策略，提出SRM框架，结合外部奖励分配器和推测验证机制。

Result: SRM将成本降至原框架的1/10，同时保持有效性。

Conclusion: SRM为LLM决策提供了一种高效且成本效益平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for
handling intricate tasks. However, existing approaches prioritize performance
but often overlook the balance between effectiveness and computational cost. To
address this, we first introduce the 3E Criteria to systematically assess the
cost-effectiveness of search strategies, revealing that existing methods often
trade significant efficiency for marginal performance gains. To improve LLM
decision-making while maintaining efficiency, we propose the Speculative Reward
Model (SRM), a plug-and-play framework that seamlessly integrates with existing
search strategies. Specifically, SRM employs an external reward assigner to
predict optimal actions, reducing reliance on LLMs' internal self-evaluation.
And a speculative verification mechanism is used to prune suboptimal choices
and guide the search toward more promising steps. We evaluate SRM on several
complex decision-making tasks including mathematical reasoning, planning and
numerical reasoning in specialized domains. Experimental results show that SRM
reduces costs to 1/10 of the original search framework on average while
maintaining effectiveness.

*Zixin Ding,Junyuan Hong,Jiachen T. Wang,Zinan Lin,Zhangyang Wang,Yuxin Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了文本提示优化在大型语言模型中的重要性，提出了一种基于动量的文本随机梯度下降方法（TSGD-M），通过重新加权提示采样提升性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着提示在大型语言模型中的作用日益关键，优化文本提示成为重要挑战。现有方法（如TGD）在数据规模增加时性能下降且计算成本高。

Method: 提出TSGD-M方法，受数值梯度下降启发，通过基于过去批次分布重新加权提示采样，实现可扩展的上下文学习。

Result: 在九个NLP任务中，TSGD-M显著优于未采用重新加权采样的TGD基线，同时降低多数任务的方差。

Conclusion: TSGD-M是一种高效且可扩展的文本提示优化方法，适用于多领域NLP任务。

Abstract: As prompts play an increasingly critical role in large language models
(LLMs), optimizing textual prompts has become a crucial challenge. The Textual
Gradient Descent (TGD) framework has emerged as a promising data-driven
approach that iteratively refines textual prompts using LLM - suggested updates
(or textual gradients) over minibatches of training samples. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that scaling the number of training examples initially
improves but later degrades TGD's performance across multiple downstream NLP
tasks. However, while data scaling improves results for most tasks, it also
significantly increases the computational cost when leveraging LLMs. To address
this, we draw inspiration from numerical gradient descent and propose Textual
Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (TSGD-M) - a method that facilitates
scalable in-context learning by reweighting prompt sampling based on past batch
distributions. Across nine NLP tasks spanning three domains - including
BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), natural language understanding tasks, and reasoning tasks
- TSGD-M significantly outperforms TGD baselines that do not incorporate
reweighted sampling, while also reducing variance in most tasks.

*Vishwanath Pratap Singh,Md. Sahidullah,Tomi Kinnunen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种因果结构发现方法，分析儿童自动语音识别（ASR）性能不佳的多因素相互依赖关系，并通过因果量化测量各因素的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童ASR性能通常低于成人，现有方法孤立分析影响因素，忽略了其相互依赖关系。

Method: 引入因果结构发现方法，揭示生理、认知和外部因素与ASR错误的相互依赖关系，并进行因果量化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同ASR系统（如Whisper和Wav2Vec2.0）中具有普适性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了儿童ASR性能的多因素相互依赖关系，并量化了各因素的影响，为改进ASR系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Children's automatic speech recognition (ASR) often underperforms compared to
that of adults due to a confluence of interdependent factors: physiological
(e.g., smaller vocal tracts), cognitive (e.g., underdeveloped pronunciation),
and extrinsic (e.g., vocabulary limitations, background noise). Existing
analysis methods examine the impact of these factors in isolation, neglecting
interdependencies-such as age affecting ASR accuracy both directly and
indirectly via pronunciation skills. In this paper, we introduce a causal
structure discovery to unravel these interdependent relationships among
physiology, cognition, extrinsic factors, and ASR errors. Then, we employ
causal quantification to measure each factor's impact on children's ASR. We
extend the analysis to fine-tuned models to identify which factors are
mitigated by fine-tuning and which remain largely unaffected. Experiments on
Whisper and Wav2Vec2.0 demonstrate the generalizability of our findings across
different ASR systems.

### [48] [Accelerating Diffusion LLMs via Adaptive Parallel Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00413)
*Daniel Israel,Guy Van den Broeck,Aditya Grover*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应并行解码（APD）方法，通过动态调整并行采样的令牌数量，解决了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）在并行生成令牌时的速度与质量平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归解码方法在LLMs中速度受限，而dLLMs理论上支持并行生成，但实践中难以在不牺牲质量的情况下达到自回归模型的速度。

Method: APD通过定义dLLM边缘概率与小型辅助自回归模型序列联合概率的乘积混合，动态调整并行采样的令牌数量，并优化了KV缓存和掩码输入大小。

Result: APD在保持质量的同时显著提高了吞吐量，在下游基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: APD通过三个可调参数灵活平衡吞吐量和质量，为并行令牌生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The generation speed of LLMs are bottlenecked by autoregressive decoding,
where tokens are predicted sequentially one by one. Alternatively, diffusion
large language models (dLLMs) theoretically allow for parallel token
generation, but in practice struggle to achieve the speed of autoregressive
models without significantly sacrificing quality. We therefore introduce
adaptive parallel decoding (APD), a novel method that dynamically adjusts the
number of tokens sampled in parallel. We achieve this by defining a
multiplicative mixture between the dLLM marginal probabilities and the joint
probability of sequences under a small auxiliary autoregressive model. This
inverts the standard setup of speculative decoding, where the goal is to sample
from a large autoregressive verifier by drafting from a smaller model. We
further optimize APD by enabling KV caching and limiting the size of the masked
input. Altogether, our method puts forward three tunable parameters to flexibly
tradeoff throughput and quality. We show that APD provides markedly higher
throughput with minimal quality degradations on downstream benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双去偏框架，通过合成邻居来修正困惑度估计，从而在噪声标注下实现鲁棒的样本清洁度评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在高噪声比例下失效，因为困惑度假设不再成立。本文旨在解决困惑度偏差问题，提升噪声检测能力。

Method: 引入双去偏框架，利用合成邻居显式修正困惑度估计，生成鲁棒的样本清洁度评分。

Result: 实验表明该方法在噪声检测和最终ICL性能上优于现有方法，且在高噪声比例下仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 双去偏框架有效解决了困惑度偏差问题，为噪声标注下的文本生成提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: In context learning (ICL) relies heavily on high quality demonstrations drawn
from large annotated corpora. Existing approaches detect noisy annotations by
ranking local perplexities, presuming that noisy samples yield higher
perplexities than their clean counterparts. However, this assumption breaks
down when the noise ratio is high and many demonstrations are flawed. We
reexamine the perplexity based paradigm for text generation under noisy
annotations, highlighting two sources of bias in perplexity: the annotation
itself and the domain specific knowledge inherent in large language models
(LLMs). To overcome these biases, we introduce a dual debiasing framework that
uses synthesized neighbors to explicitly correct perplexity estimates, yielding
a robust Sample Cleanliness Score. This metric uncovers absolute sample
cleanliness regardless of the overall corpus noise level. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our method's superior noise detection capabilities and show that
its final ICL performance is comparable to that of a fully clean demonstration
corpus. Moreover, our approach remains robust even when noise ratios are
extremely high.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新型多模态对话模型，旨在解决现有聊天机器人在多模态交互中忽视听觉信息的问题，并引入了一个新的数据集$M^3C$，模型在复杂场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有聊天机器人的多模态研究主要关注视觉任务，忽视了听觉信息，且交互多为静态，限制了动态对话的丰富性。

Method: 研究引入了$M^3C$数据集，并提出了一种具备多模态记忆检索功能的新型对话模型。

Result: 模型在复杂场景中能够处理视觉和听觉输入，并保持连贯的动态对话，人类评估显示其性能优异。

Conclusion: 该模型在多模态对话中表现出潜力，为未来高级多模态对话代理的发展提供了方向。

Abstract: As chatbots continue to evolve toward human-like, real-world, interactions,
multimodality remains an active area of research and exploration. So far,
efforts to integrate multimodality into chatbots have primarily focused on
image-centric tasks, such as visual dialogue and image-based instructions,
placing emphasis on the "eyes" of human perception while neglecting the "ears",
namely auditory aspects. Moreover, these studies often center around static
interactions that focus on discussing the modality rather than naturally
incorporating it into the conversation, which limits the richness of
simultaneous, dynamic engagement. Furthermore, while multimodality has been
explored in multi-party and multi-session conversations, task-specific
constraints have hindered its seamless integration into dynamic, natural
conversations. To address these challenges, this study aims to equip chatbots
with "eyes and ears" capable of more immersive interactions with humans. As
part of this effort, we introduce a new multimodal conversation dataset,
Multimodal Multi-Session Multi-Party Conversation ($M^3C$), and propose a novel
multimodal conversation model featuring multimodal memory retrieval. Our model,
trained on the $M^3C$, demonstrates the ability to seamlessly engage in
long-term conversations with multiple speakers in complex, real-world-like
settings, effectively processing visual and auditory inputs to understand and
respond appropriately. Human evaluations highlight the model's strong
performance in maintaining coherent and dynamic interactions, demonstrating its
potential for advanced multimodal conversational agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DYNAC是一种基于动态词汇的非自回归上下文化方法，通过自条件CTC有效整合动态词汇，显著降低实时因子（RTF）并保持较低的词错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态词汇在非自回归模型中因条件独立性假设无法捕捉静态与动态词汇依赖关系的问题。

Method: 提出DYNAC，将动态词汇整合到中间层，通过自条件CTC方法捕捉依赖关系。

Result: 在LibriSpeech 960测试集上，RTF降低81%，词错误率仅增加0.1点。

Conclusion: DYNAC在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理速度，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Contextual biasing (CB) improves automatic speech recognition for rare and
unseen phrases. Recent studies have introduced dynamic vocabulary, which
represents context phrases as expandable tokens in autoregressive (AR) models.
This method improves CB accuracy but with slow inference speed. While dynamic
vocabulary can be applied to non-autoregressive (NAR) models, such as
connectionist temporal classification (CTC), the conditional independence
assumption fails to capture dependencies between static and dynamic tokens.
This paper proposes DYNAC (Dynamic Vocabulary-based NAR Contextualization), a
self-conditioned CTC method that integrates dynamic vocabulary into
intermediate layers. Conditioning the encoder on dynamic vocabulary, DYNAC
effectively captures dependencies between static and dynamic tokens while
reducing the real-time factor (RTF). Experimental results show that DYNAC
reduces RTF by 81% with a 0.1-point degradation in word error rate on the
LibriSpeech 960 test-clean set.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多答案问答框架RI$^2$VER，通过独立阅读和跨段落验证解决现有系统在多答案QA中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索增强生成式QA系统在多答案问题中难以检索和合成大量证据段落。

Method: RI$^2$VER框架包括检索大量段落、独立处理生成初始答案集，以及跨段落验证流程（验证问题生成、收集额外证据、跨段落合成验证）。

Result: 在QAMPARI和RoMQA数据集上显著优于基线，F1分数平均提升11.17%。

Conclusion: 跨段落验证流程使框架在多证据合成问题上表现优异。

Abstract: Multi-answer question answering (QA), where questions can have many valid
answers, presents a significant challenge for existing retrieval-augmented
generation-based QA systems, as these systems struggle to retrieve and then
synthesize a large number of evidence passages. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a new multi-answer QA framework -- Retrieval-augmented Independent
Reading with Inter-passage Verification (RI$^2$VER). Our framework retrieves a
large set of passages and processes each passage individually to generate an
initial high-recall but noisy answer set. Then we propose a new inter-passage
verification pipeline that validates every candidate answer through (1)
Verification Question Generation, (2) Gathering Additional Evidence, and (3)
Verification with inter-passage synthesis. Evaluations on the QAMPARI and RoMQA
datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing
baselines across various model sizes, achieving an average F1 score improvement
of 11.17%. Further analysis validates that our inter-passage verification
pipeline enables our framework to be particularly beneficial for questions
requiring multi-evidence synthesis.

Result: 实验结果表明，G2S显著提升了大型语言模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: G2S框架通过分离通用模式和场景信息的学习，有效提升了模型在时序知识图谱预测任务中的性能。

Abstract: Forecasting over Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) which predicts future facts
based on historical ones has received much attention. Recent studies have
introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) for this task to enhance the models'
generalization abilities. However, these models perform forecasting via
simultaneously learning two kinds of entangled knowledge in the TKG: (1)
general patterns, i.e., invariant temporal structures shared across different
scenarios; and (2) scenario information, i.e., factual knowledge engaged in
specific scenario, such as entities and relations. As a result, the learning
processes of these two kinds of knowledge may interfere with each other, which
potentially impact the generalization abilities of the models. To enhance the
generalization ability of LLMs on this task, in this paper, we propose a
General-to-Specific learning framework (G2S) that disentangles the learning
processes of the above two kinds of knowledge. In the general learning stage,
we mask the scenario information in different TKGs and convert it into
anonymous temporal structures. After training on these structures, the model is
able to capture the general patterns across different TKGs. In the specific
learning stage, we inject the scenario information into the structures via
either in-context learning or fine-tuning modes. Experimental results show that
G2S effectively improves the generalization abilities of LLMs.

Abstract: Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) during summarization of
patient-clinician dialogues pose significant risks to patient care and clinical
decision-making. However, the phenomenon remains understudied in the clinical
domain, with uncertainty surrounding the applicability of general-domain
hallucination detectors. The rarity and randomness of hallucinations further
complicate their investigation. In this paper, we conduct an evaluation of
hallucination detection methods in the medical domain, and construct two
datasets for the purpose: A fact-controlled Leave-N-out dataset -- generated by
systematically removing facts from source dialogues to induce hallucinated
content in summaries; and a natural hallucination dataset -- arising
organically during LLM-based medical summarization. We show that general-domain
detectors struggle to detect clinical hallucinations, and that performance on
fact-controlled hallucinations does not reliably predict effectiveness on
natural hallucinations. We then develop fact-based approaches that count
hallucinations, offering explainability not available with existing methods.
Notably, our LLM-based detectors, which we developed using fact-controlled
hallucinations, generalize well to detecting real-world clinical
hallucinations. This research contributes a suite of specialized metrics
supported by expert-annotated datasets to advance faithful clinical
summarization systems.

massively multilingual language adaptation of the Llama3 family of models to
500 languages. To this end, we construct the MaLA bilingual translation corpus,

pre-trained from the Llama 3 family of base models extensively on diverse data
mixes up to 671B tokens -- and explore the effect of continual pre-training
with or without bilingual translation data. Comprehensive evaluation across 7
tasks and 12 benchmarks demonstrates that bilingual data tends to enhance
language transfer and performance, particularly for low-resource languages. We
open-source the MaLA corpus, EMMA-500 Llama 3 suite artefacts, code, and model

Conclusion: PVP数据集为个性化视觉说服技术提供了重要资源，心理特征的引入具有显著价值。

Abstract: Visual persuasion, which uses visual elements to influence cognition and
behaviors, is crucial in fields such as advertising and political
communication. With recent advancements in artificial intelligence, there is
growing potential to develop persuasive systems that automatically generate
persuasive images tailored to individuals. However, a significant bottleneck in
this area is the lack of comprehensive datasets that connect the persuasiveness
of images with the personal information about those who evaluated the images.
To address this gap and facilitate technological advancements in personalized
visual persuasion, we release the Personalized Visual Persuasion (PVP) dataset,
comprising 28,454 persuasive images across 596 messages and 9 persuasion
strategies. Importantly, the PVP dataset provides persuasiveness scores of
images evaluated by 2,521 human annotators, along with their demographic and
psychological characteristics (personality traits and values). We demonstrate
the utility of our dataset by developing a persuasive image generator and an
automated evaluator, and establish benchmark baselines. Our experiments reveal
that incorporating psychological characteristics enhances the generation and
evaluation of persuasive images, providing valuable insights for personalized
visual persuasion.

Conclusion: 结合LLM与标签传播技术可显著提升多模态假新闻检测性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist multimodal fake news detection by
predicting pseudo labels. However, LLM-generated pseudo labels alone
demonstrate poor performance compared to traditional detection methods, making
their effective integration non-trivial. In this paper, we propose Global Label
Propagation Network with LLM-based Pseudo Labeling (GLPN-LLM) for multimodal
fake news detection, which integrates LLM capabilities via label propagation
techniques. The global label propagation can utilize LLM-generated pseudo
labels, enhancing prediction accuracy by propagating label information among
all samples. For label propagation, a mask-based mechanism is designed to
prevent label leakage during training by ensuring that training nodes do not
propagate their own labels back to themselves. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that by synergizing LLMs with label propagation, our
model achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: DAT是一种简单有效的方法，适用于低资源语言，并能通过积累生成示例提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across
various tasks, leveraging their exceptional in-context learning ability with
only a few examples. Accordingly, the selection of optimal in-context examples
has been actively studied in the field of machine translation. However, these
studies presuppose the presence of a demonstration pool with human-annotated
pairs, making them less applicable to low-resource languages where such an
assumption is challenging to meet. To overcome this limitation, this paper
explores the research direction of in-context example generation for machine
translation. Specifically, we propose Demonstration Augmentation for
Translation (DAT), a simple yet effective approach that generates example pairs
without relying on any external resources. This method builds upon two prior
criteria, relevance and diversity, which have been highlighted in previous work
as key factors for in-context example selection. Through experiments and
analysis on low-resource languages where human-annotated pairs are scarce, we
show that DAT achieves superior translation quality compared to the baselines.
Furthermore, we investigate the potential of progressively accumulating
generated pairs during test time to build and reuse a demonstration pool. Our
implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/aiclaudev/DAT.

Abstract: Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MASs) have demonstrated

introduction of additional attack surfaces, MASs are particularly vulnerable to
misinformation injection. To facilitate a deeper understanding of
misinformation propagation dynamics within these systems, we introduce
MisinfoTask, a novel dataset featuring complex, realistic tasks designed to
evaluate MAS robustness against such threats. Building upon this, we propose
ARGUS, a two-stage, training-free defense framework leveraging goal-aware
reasoning for precise misinformation rectification within information flows.
Our experiments demonstrate that in challenging misinformation scenarios, ARGUS
exhibits significant efficacy across various injection attacks, achieving an
average reduction in misinformation toxicity of approximately 28.17% and

Motivation: 现有多样性指标在常识生成任务中的适用性不明确，需系统评估以确定最佳指标。

Method: 通过LLM创建标注数据集，对现有多样性指标进行元评估。

Result: 基于内容的多样性指标表现优于基于形式的指标，与LLM评分高度相关。

Conclusion: 建议未来常识生成研究采用基于内容的多样性评估指标。

Abstract: In commonsense generation, given a set of input concepts, a model must
generate a response that is not only commonsense bearing, but also capturing
multiple diverse viewpoints. Numerous evaluation metrics based on form- and
content-level overlap have been proposed in prior work for evaluating the
diversity of a commonsense generation model. However, it remains unclear as to
which metrics are best suited for evaluating the diversity in commonsense
generation. To address this gap, we conduct a systematic meta-evaluation of
diversity metrics for commonsense generation. We find that form-based diversity
metrics tend to consistently overestimate the diversity in sentence sets, where
even randomly generated sentences are assigned overly high diversity scores. We
then use an Large Language Model (LLM) to create a novel dataset annotated for
the diversity of sentences generated for a commonsense generation task, and use
it to conduct a meta-evaluation of the existing diversity evaluation metrics.
Our experimental results show that content-based diversity evaluation metrics
consistently outperform the form-based counterparts, showing high correlations
with the LLM-based ratings. We recommend that future work on commonsense
generation should use content-based metrics for evaluating the diversity of
their outputs.

### [63] [CausalAbstain: Enhancing Multilingual LLMs with Causal Reasoning for Trustworthy Abstention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00519)
*Yuxi Sun,Aoqi Zuo,Wei Gao,Jing Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CausalAbstain的方法，通过因果视角帮助LLMs在多语言场景中更有效地选择反馈并提升弃权决策的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在多语言环境中因知识差异导致的幻觉问题，现有方法依赖生成反馈但易受不准确和偏见影响。

Method: 引入CausalAbstain方法，从因果视角帮助LLMs判断是否使用多个生成反馈并选择最有用的反馈。

Result: 实验表明CausalAbstain在原生语言和多语言设置中均优于基线方法，提升了弃权决策的准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: CausalAbstain方法有效解决了多语言场景中LLMs的反馈选择问题，并显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit knowledge disparities across
languages. Encouraging LLMs to \textit{abstain} when faced with knowledge gaps
is a promising strategy to reduce hallucinations in multilingual settings.
Current abstention strategies for multilingual scenarios primarily rely on
generating feedback in various languages using LLMs and performing
self-reflection. However, these methods can be adversely impacted by
inaccuracies and biases in the generated feedback. To address this, from a
causal perspective, we introduce \textit{CausalAbstain}, a method that helps
LLMs determine whether to utilize multiple generated feedback responses and how
to identify the most useful ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
\textit{CausalAbstain} effectively selects helpful feedback and enhances
abstention decisions with interpretability in both native language
(\textsc{Casual-native}) and multilingual (\textsc{Causal-multi}) settings,
outperforming strong baselines on two benchmark datasets covering encyclopedic
and commonsense knowledge QA tasks. Our code and data are open-sourced at

TL;DR: MQG-RFM是一种轻量级框架，通过多角度问题生成和检索微调方法提升RAG系统在IP领域的检索准确性，实验显示显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决IP领域RAG系统因用户查询多样性（如口语化表达、拼写错误等）导致的检索不准确问题。

Method: 利用LLM模拟多样化用户查询，通过语义对齐和硬负样本挖掘微调检索模型。

Result: 在台湾专利数据集上，检索准确率提升185.62%和262.26%，生成质量分别提升14.22%和53.58%。

Conclusion: MQG-RFM为中小机构提供了一种实用、可扩展的专利情报解决方案，已被ScholarMate采用。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the Intellectual Property
(IP) field often struggle with diverse user queries, including colloquial
expressions, spelling errors, and ambiguous terminology, leading to inaccurate
retrieval and suboptimal responses. To address this challenge, we propose
Multi-Angle Question Generation and Retrieval Fine-Tuning Method (MQG-RFM), a
novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate varied
user inquiries and fine-tunes retrieval models to align semantically equivalent
but linguistically diverse questions. Unlike complex architectural
modifications, MQG-RFM adopts a lightweight Data-to-Tune paradigm, combining
prompt-engineered query generation with hard negative mining to enhance
retrieval robustness without costly infrastructure changes. Experimental
results on a Taiwan patent Q&A dataset show 185.62% improvement in retrieval
accuracy on the Patent Consultation dataset and 262.26% improvement on the
Novel Patent Technology Report dataset, with 14.22% and 53.58% improvements in
generation quality over the baselines, respectively. By bridging the gap
between user intent and system comprehension through semantic-aware retrieval
optimization, MQG-RFM offers a practical, scalable approach for rapid,
cost-effective deployment among small and medium-sized agencies seeking
reliable patent intelligence solutions. Additionally, our proposed method has
already been adopted by ScholarMate, the largest professional research social
networking platform in China, to support real-world development and deployment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DecKER是一个新的知识编辑框架，通过解耦推理和知识编辑，显著提升了多跳问答任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICE方法未明确分离新注入知识与模型原始推理过程，导致知识冲突和推理路径不一致。

Method: 提出DecKER框架，生成掩码推理路径并通过混合检索和基于模型的验证解决知识编辑问题。

Result: 在多跳QA基准测试中，DecKER显著优于现有ICE方法。

Conclusion: DecKER通过解耦推理与知识编辑，有效缓解知识冲突并保持推理一致性。

Abstract: Knowledge editing aims to efficiently update Large Language Models (LLMs) by
modifying specific knowledge without retraining the entire model. Among
knowledge editing approaches, in-context editing (ICE) offers a lightweight
solution by injecting new knowledge directly into the input context, leaving
model parameters unchanged. However, existing ICE approaches do not explicitly
separate the newly injected knowledge from the model's original reasoning
process. This entanglement often results in conflicts between external updates
and internal parametric knowledge, undermining the consistency and accuracy of
the reasoning path.In this work, we conduct preliminary experiments to examine
how parametric knowledge influences reasoning path planning. We find that the
model's reasoning is tightly coupled with its internal knowledge, and that
naively injecting new information without adapting the reasoning path often
leads to performance degradation, particularly in multi-hop tasks. To this end,
we propose DecKER, a novel ICE framework that decouples reasoning from
knowledge editing by generating a masked reasoning path and then resolving
knowledge edits via hybrid retrieval and model-based validation. Experiments on
multi-hop QA benchmarks show that DecKER significantly outperforms existing ICE
methods by mitigating knowledge conflicts and preserving reasoning consistency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ARIA方法通过将自然语言动作从高维空间映射到低维意图空间，聚合奖励以减少方差，提升语言代理的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放语言动作环境中，动作空间的高维性导致奖励稀疏和方差大，阻碍强化学习效果。

Method: 提出ARIA方法，将动作投影到低维意图空间，聚类语义相似动作并共享奖励。

Result: 实验显示ARIA显著降低策略梯度方差，平均性能提升9.95%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ARIA通过意图空间奖励聚合，有效解决了高维动作空间的奖励稀疏问题，提升了语言代理的训练效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled agents to perform complex reasoning
and decision-making through free-form language interactions. However, in
open-ended language action environments (e.g., negotiation or question-asking
games), the action space can be formulated as a joint distribution over tokens,
resulting in an exponentially large action space. Sampling actions in such a
space can lead to extreme reward sparsity, which brings large reward variance,
hindering effective reinforcement learning (RL). To address this, we propose
ARIA, a method that Aggregates Rewards in Intention space to enable efficient
and effective language Agents training. ARIA aims to project natural language
actions from the high-dimensional joint token distribution space into a
low-dimensional intention space, where semantically similar actions are
clustered and assigned shared rewards. This intention-aware reward aggregation
reduces reward variance by densifying reward signals, fostering better policy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARIA not only
significantly reduces policy gradient variance, but also delivers substantial
performance gains of an average of 9.95% across four downstream tasks,
consistently outperforming offline and online RL baselines.

Method: 引入MSumBench，包含多领域评估标准和多智能体辩论系统，评估8个现代摘要模型。

Result: 发现模型在不同领域和语言中表现差异，并揭示大语言模型在评估自生成摘要时的系统性偏差。

Conclusion: MSumBench为摘要评估提供了更全面的工具，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Evaluation frameworks for text summarization have evolved in terms of both
domain coverage and metrics. However, existing benchmarks still lack
domain-specific assessment criteria, remain predominantly English-centric, and
face challenges with human annotation due to the complexity of reasoning. To
address these, we introduce MSumBench, which provides a multi-dimensional,
multi-domain evaluation of summarization in English and Chinese. It also
incorporates specialized assessment criteria for each domain and leverages a
multi-agent debate system to enhance annotation quality. By evaluating eight
modern summarization models, we discover distinct performance patterns across
domains and languages. We further examine large language models as summary
evaluators, analyzing the correlation between their evaluation and
summarization capabilities, and uncovering systematic bias in their assessment
of self-generated summaries. Our benchmark dataset is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于成本和伦理问题，真实求助者难以参与AI驱动的心理健康研究，因此需要更真实的模拟方法。

Method: AnnaAgent结合情感调节器和投诉引发器，并采用三级记忆机制，动态控制模拟配置。

Result: 评估显示，AnnaAgent在心理咨询中比现有基线更真实地模拟求助者。

Conclusion: AnnaAgent为心理健康研究提供了更真实的模拟工具，代码已通过伦理审查并开源。

Abstract: Constrained by the cost and ethical concerns of involving real seekers in
AI-driven mental health, researchers develop LLM-based conversational agents
(CAs) with tailored configurations, such as profiles, symptoms, and scenarios,
to simulate seekers. While these efforts advance AI in mental health, achieving
more realistic seeker simulation remains hindered by two key challenges:
dynamic evolution and multi-session memory. Seekers' mental states often
fluctuate during counseling, which typically spans multiple sessions. To
address this, we propose AnnaAgent, an emotional and cognitive dynamic agent
system equipped with tertiary memory. AnnaAgent incorporates an emotion
modulator and a complaint elicitor trained on real counseling dialogues,
enabling dynamic control of the simulator's configurations. Additionally, its
tertiary memory mechanism effectively integrates short-term and long-term
memory across sessions. Evaluation results, both automated and manual,
demonstrate that AnnaAgent achieves more realistic seeker simulation in
psychological counseling compared to existing baselines. The ethically reviewed
and screened code can be found on https://github.com/sci-m-wang/AnnaAgent.

Motivation: 社交媒体中存在大量冒犯性内容，而表情符号作为视觉元素的作用未被充分研究，尤其是在其通过象征、讽刺或上下文被滥用时。

Method: 系统分析了表情符号在冒犯性推文中的分布和滥用方式，并提出了一种LLM驱动的多步审核流程，选择性替换有害表情符号。

Result: 人类评估证实该方法有效降低了冒犯性感知，同时保留了推文的语义意图。分析还揭示了不同冒犯类型的异质性影响。

Conclusion: 研究为在线交流和表情符号审核提供了细致见解，展示了LLM在内容审核中的潜力。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become central to modern communication, yet they
also harbor offensive content that challenges platform safety and inclusivity.
While prior research has primarily focused on textual indicators of offense,
the role of emojis, ubiquitous visual elements in online discourse, remains
underexplored. Emojis, despite being rarely offensive in isolation, can acquire
harmful meanings through symbolic associations, sarcasm, and contextual misuse.
In this work, we systematically examine emoji contributions to offensive
Twitter messages, analyzing their distribution across offense categories and
how users exploit emoji ambiguity. To address this, we propose an LLM-powered,
multi-step moderation pipeline that selectively replaces harmful emojis while
preserving the tweet's semantic intent. Human evaluations confirm our approach
effectively reduces perceived offensiveness without sacrificing meaning. Our
analysis also reveals heterogeneous effects across offense types, offering
nuanced insights for online communication and emoji moderation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于能量的检索器Entriever，用于解决知识检索中知识片段条件独立假设的问题，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前检索器模型假设知识片段条件独立，而实际任务中可能存在多个相关且关联的知识片段，需要更有效的建模方法。

Method: 提出Entriever，通过能量函数直接建模候选检索结果整体，探索不同能量函数架构和训练方法。

Result: Entriever在知识检索任务中显著优于基线模型，并在半监督对话系统中提升了端到端性能。

Conclusion: Entriever通过整体建模知识片段相关性，有效解决了条件独立假设的局限性，提升了检索和对话系统性能。

Abstract: A retriever, which retrieves relevant knowledge pieces from a knowledge base
given a context, is an important component in many natural language processing
(NLP) tasks. Retrievers have been introduced in knowledge-grounded dialog
systems to improve knowledge acquisition. In knowledge-grounded dialog systems,
when conditioning on a given context, there may be multiple relevant and
correlated knowledge pieces. However, knowledge pieces are usually assumed to
be conditionally independent in current retriever models. To address this
issue, we propose Entriever, an energy-based retriever. Entriever directly
models the candidate retrieval results as a whole instead of modeling the
knowledge pieces separately, with the relevance score defined by an energy
function. We explore various architectures of energy functions and different
training methods for Entriever, and show that Entriever substantially
outperforms the strong cross-encoder baseline in knowledge retrieval tasks.
Furthermore, we show that in semi-supervised training of knowledge-grounded
dialog systems, Entriever enables effective scoring of retrieved knowledge
pieces and significantly improves end-to-end performance of dialog systems.

TL;DR: PAKTON是一个开源的多智能体框架，旨在通过协作工作流和检索增强生成技术，实现自动化合同审查，解决法律文档分析的复杂性和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合同审查复杂且耗时，需要法律专业知识，对非专家不友好；法律解释模糊且主观；合同保密性限制了专有模型的使用。

Method: PAKTON采用多智能体协作工作流和检索增强生成（RAG）技术，实现端到端的自动化合同分析。

Result: PAKTON在预测准确性、检索性能、可解释性、完整性和合理性方面优于通用和预训练模型。

Conclusion: PAKTON为合同审查提供了更易用、灵活且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Contract review is a complex and time-intensive task that typically demands
specialized legal expertise, rendering it largely inaccessible to non-experts.
Moreover, legal interpretation is rarely straightforward-ambiguity is
pervasive, and judgments often hinge on subjective assessments. Compounding
these challenges, contracts are usually confidential, restricting their use
with proprietary models and necessitating reliance on open-source alternatives.
To address these challenges, we introduce PAKTON: a fully open-source,
end-to-end, multi-agent framework with plug-and-play capabilities. PAKTON is
designed to handle the complexities of contract analysis through collaborative
agent workflows and a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) component,
enabling automated legal document review that is more accessible, adaptable,
and privacy-preserving. Experiments demonstrate that PAKTON outperforms both
general-purpose and pretrained models in predictive accuracy, retrieval
performance, explainability, completeness, and grounded justifications as
evaluated through a human study and validated with automated metrics.

Motivation: 临床任务（如诊断和治疗）需要强大的决策能力，因此需要严格的评估基准来验证LLM的可靠性。

Method: 利用医学知识图谱进行多步语义遍历，生成既符合临床逻辑又具有误导性的干扰选项。

Result: 在六个医学QA基准测试中，KGGDG显著降低了最先进LLM的准确率。

Conclusion: KGGDG是一种强大的工具，可用于更稳健和诊断性地评估医学LLM。

Abstract: Clinical tasks such as diagnosis and treatment require strong decision-making
abilities, highlighting the importance of rigorous evaluation benchmarks to
assess the reliability of large language models (LLMs). In this work, we
introduce a knowledge-guided data augmentation framework that enhances the
difficulty of clinical multiple-choice question (MCQ) datasets by generating
distractors (i.e., incorrect choices that are similar to the correct one and
may confuse existing LLMs). Using our KG-based pipeline, the generated choices
are both clinically plausible and deliberately misleading. Our approach
involves multi-step, semantically informed walks on a medical knowledge graph
to identify distractor paths-associations that are medically relevant but
factually incorrect-which then guide the LLM in crafting more deceptive
distractors. We apply the designed knowledge graph guided distractor generation
(KGGDG) pipline, to six widely used medical QA benchmarks and show that it
consistently reduces the accuracy of state-of-the-art LLMs. These findings
establish KGGDG as a powerful tool for enabling more robust and diagnostic
evaluations of medical LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索器训练数据构建方法存在三个关键缺陷：未考虑示例的协同效应、未充分融入查询的语言特征、未直接优化DST性能评分。

Method: 提出CombiSearch方法，基于上下文示例对DST性能的组合影响进行评分，优化检索器训练。

Result: 在MultiWOZ上评估，CombiSearch超越现有方法，数据效率提升20倍，并在SGD数据集上泛化良好；假设无检索错误时，DST性能上限提升12%。

Conclusion: CombiSearch显著提升DST性能上限，证明现有方法依赖次优数据训练检索器。

Abstract: In dialogue state tracking (DST), in-context learning comprises a retriever
that selects labeled dialogues as in-context examples and a DST model that uses
these examples to infer the dialogue state of the query dialogue. Existing
methods for constructing training data for retrievers suffer from three key
limitations: (1) the synergistic effect of examples is not considered, (2) the
linguistic characteristics of the query are not sufficiently factored in, and
(3) scoring is not directly optimized for DST performance. Consequently, the
retriever can fail to retrieve examples that would substantially improve DST
performance. To address these issues, we present CombiSearch, a method that
scores effective in-context examples based on their combinatorial impact on DST
performance. Our evaluation on MultiWOZ shows that retrievers trained with
CombiSearch surpass state-of-the-art models, achieving a 20x gain in data
efficiency and generalizing well to the SGD dataset. Moreover, CombiSearch
attains a 12% absolute improvement in the upper bound DST performance over
traditional approaches when no retrieval errors are assumed. This significantly
increases the headroom for practical DST performance while demonstrating that
existing methods rely on suboptimal data for retriever training.

Result: 输入分块和序列信息整合显著提升模型在带口音语音上的性能，同时保持标准LID表现。

Conclusion: 通过简单方法可显著提升LID模型对带口音语音的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Prior research indicates that LID model performance significantly declines on
accented speech; however, the specific causes, extent, and characterization of
these errors remain under-explored. (i) We identify a common failure mode on
accented speech whereby LID systems often misclassify L2 accented speech as the
speaker's native language or a related language. (ii) We present evidence
suggesting that state-of-the-art models are invariant to permutations of short
spans of speech, implying they classify on the basis of short phonotactic
features indicative of accent rather than language. Our analysis reveals a
simple method to enhance model robustness to accents through input chunking.
(iii) We present an approach that integrates sequence-level information into
our model without relying on monolingual ASR systems; this reduces
accent-language confusion and significantly enhances performance on accented
speech while maintaining comparable results on standard LID.

Motivation: 研究租房广告语言如何反映城市空间的社会构建，探索传统方法忽略的空间定义争议。

Method: 结合人工和大语言模型标注Craigslist广告，进行地理空间分析和主题建模。

Result: 发现三种空间模式：冲突性定义、边界性定义和声誉漂白；不同位置的广告强调不同设施。

Conclusion: 自然语言处理技术能揭示传统方法忽略的城市空间定义争议。

Abstract: Rental listings offer a unique window into how urban space is socially
constructed through language. We analyze Chicago Craigslist rental
advertisements from 2018 to 2024 to examine how listing agents characterize
neighborhoods, identifying mismatches between institutional boundaries and
neighborhood claims. Through manual and large language model annotation, we
classify unstructured listings from Craigslist according to their neighborhood.
Geospatial analysis reveals three distinct patterns: properties with
conflicting neighborhood designations due to competing spatial definitions,
border properties with valid claims to adjacent neighborhoods, and ``reputation
laundering" where listings claim association with distant, desirable
neighborhoods. Through topic modeling, we identify patterns that correlate with
spatial positioning: listings further from neighborhood centers emphasize
different amenities than centrally-located units. Our findings demonstrate that
natural language processing techniques can reveal how definitions of urban
spaces are contested in ways that traditional methods overlook.

Result: 微调ASR模型显著降低毒性语音转录错误率，文本毒性检测模型优于基线。

Conclusion: ViToSA为越南语音频毒性检测设立新基准，推动语音内容审核研究。

Abstract: Toxic speech on online platforms is a growing concern, impacting user
experience and online safety. While text-based toxicity detection is
well-studied, audio-based approaches remain underexplored, especially for
low-resource languages like Vietnamese. This paper introduces ViToSA
(Vietnamese Toxic Spans Audio), the first dataset for toxic spans detection in
Vietnamese speech, comprising 11,000 audio samples (25 hours) with accurate
human-annotated transcripts. We propose a pipeline that combines ASR and toxic
spans detection for fine-grained identification of toxic content. Our
experiments show that fine-tuning ASR models on ViToSA significantly reduces
WER when transcribing toxic speech, while the text-based toxic spans detection
(TSD) models outperform existing baselines. These findings establish a novel
benchmark for Vietnamese audio-based toxic spans detection, paving the way for
future research in speech content moderation.

Motivation: 现有置信度度量在文本生成中校准不佳，因存在多个有效答案，传统方法未充分考虑。

Result: 在BART和Flan-T5模型上，改进了摘要、翻译和QA数据集的校准效果。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升生成模型的置信度校准，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Well-calibrated model confidence scores can improve the usefulness of text
generation models. For example, users can be prompted to review predictions
with low confidence scores, to prevent models from returning bad or potentially
dangerous predictions. However, confidence metrics are not always well
calibrated in text generation. One reason is that in generation, there can be
many valid answers, which previous methods do not always account for. Hence, a
confident model could distribute its output probability among multiple
sequences because they are all valid. We propose task-agnostic confidence
metrics suited to generation, which rely solely on the probabilities associated
with the model outputs without the need for further fine-tuning or heuristics.
Using these, we are able to improve the calibration of BART and Flan-T5 on
summarization, translation, and QA datasets.

Select All That Apply (SATA) questions across diverse domains, including
reading comprehension, law, and biomedicine. Our evaluation of 27 open-source
and proprietary models reveals a significant gap: even the strongest model
achieves only 41.8% exact match, exposing LLMs' inability to reliably identify
all correct answers. We find that this weakness stems from two core challenges:
selection bias - models favor certain choices regardless of content, and count
bias - models fail to predict the correct number of answers. To address these
issues, we propose Choice Funnel, a decoding strategy that combines token
debiasing with adaptive thresholding to guide models toward complete and
accurate selections. Choice Funnel achieves up to 29% higher exact match than
competitive baselines while reducing inference cost by over 64%. Our findings
expose fundamental limitations in current LLMs and introduce a new framework
for diagnosing and improving multi-answer reasoning. We release SATA-BENCH and
Choice Funnel to promote LLM development for robust decision-making in
realistic, multi-answer applications.

Motivation: 口吃是一种复杂的障碍，需要专业评估和治疗，现有数据集标注质量不足，需改进。

Method: 聘请临床专家标注数据，采用多模态特征（视听）标注口吃时刻、次要行为及紧张分数，并提供专家共识测试集。

Result: 实验表明，口吃评估模型的训练和验证需要大量临床专业知识。

Conclusion: 新标注方案和高质量数据集为口吃研究提供了更可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: Stuttering is a complex disorder that requires specialized expertise for
effective assessment and treatment. This paper presents an effort to enhance
the FluencyBank dataset with a new stuttering annotation scheme based on
established clinical standards. To achieve high-quality annotations, we hired
expert clinicians to label the data, ensuring that the resulting annotations
mirror real-world clinical expertise. The annotations are multi-modal,
incorporating audiovisual features for the detection and classification of
stuttering moments, secondary behaviors, and tension scores. In addition to
individual annotations, we additionally provide a test set with highly reliable
annotations based on expert consensus for assessing individual annotators and
machine learning models. Our experiments and analysis illustrate the complexity
of this task that necessitates extensive clinical expertise for valid training
and evaluation of stuttering assessment models.

TL;DR: GUIDEX是一种新方法，通过自动定义领域特定模式、推断指南并生成合成标记实例，提升零样本信息提取性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信息提取系统需要领域专家设计模式和数据标注，成本高；大语言模型在零样本任务中表现不佳，尤其在未知领域。

Method: GUIDEX自动生成领域模式、指南和合成数据，并微调Llama 3.1模型。

Result: 在七个零样本命名实体识别基准测试中达到新SOTA，F1分数提升7点（无标注数据）或2点（结合标注数据）。

Conclusion: GUIDEX显著提升模型对复杂领域模式的理解，且无需人工标注数据。

Abstract: Information Extraction (IE) systems are traditionally domain-specific,
requiring costly adaptation that involves expert schema design, data
annotation, and model training. While Large Language Models have shown promise
in zero-shot IE, performance degrades significantly in unseen domains where
label definitions differ. This paper introduces GUIDEX, a novel method that
automatically defines domain-specific schemas, infers guidelines, and generates
synthetically labeled instances, allowing for better out-of-domain
generalization. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 with GUIDEX sets a new state-of-the-art
across seven zeroshot Named Entity Recognition benchmarks. Models trained with
GUIDEX gain up to 7 F1 points over previous methods without humanlabeled data,
and nearly 2 F1 points higher when combined with it. Models trained on GUIDEX
demonstrate enhanced comprehension of complex, domain-specific annotation
schemas. Code, models, and synthetic datasets are available at

Conclusion: 情感提示技术在讽刺分类和生成中表现优越，为理解人类交流提供了新方法。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a form of humor where expressions convey meanings opposite to
their literal interpretations. Classifying and generating sarcasm using large
language models is vital for interpreting human communication. Sarcasm poses
challenges for computational models, due to its nuanced nature. We introduce
Sarc7, a benchmark that classifies 7 types of sarcasm: self-deprecating,
brooding, deadpan, polite, obnoxious, raging, and manic by annotating entries
of the MUStARD dataset. Classification was evaluated using zero-shot, few-shot,
chain-of-thought (CoT), and a novel emotion-based prompting technique. We
propose an emotion-based generation method developed by identifying key
components of sarcasm-incongruity, shock value, and context dependency. Our
classification experiments show that Gemini 2.5, using emotion-based prompting,
outperforms other setups with an F1 score of 0.3664. Human evaluators preferred
our emotion-based prompting, with 38.46% more successful generations than
zero-shot prompting.

Result: 实验表明，STREAM显著优于现有防御技术，将攻击成功率（ASR）降低了51.2%，同时保持了LLM的功能。

Conclusion: STREAM是一种有效的防御机制，能够显著减少多轮对话攻击的风险，同时不影响LLM的核心能力。

Abstract: Malicious attackers can exploit large language models (LLMs) by engaging them
in multi-turn dialogues to achieve harmful objectives, posing significant
safety risks to society. To address this challenge, we propose a novel defense
mechanism: SafeTy Reasoning Elicitation Alignment for Multi-Turn Dialogues
(STREAM). STREAM defends LLMs against multi-turn attacks while preserving their
functional capabilities. Our approach involves constructing a human-annotated
dataset, the Safety Reasoning Multi-turn Dialogues dataset, which is used to
fine-tune a plug-and-play safety reasoning moderator. This model is designed to
identify malicious intent hidden within multi-turn conversations and alert the
target LLM of potential risks. We evaluate STREAM across multiple LLMs against
prevalent multi-turn attack strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms existing defense techniques, reducing the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 51.2%, all while maintaining comparable LLM
capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在复杂法律任务（如论点生成）中显示出潜力，但其可靠性仍存疑。本文旨在通过自动化方法评估LLMs在这些任务中的表现。

Method: 采用外部LLM从生成的论点中提取因素，并与输入案例中的真实因素进行比较。评估了八种LLM在三种难度递增的测试中的表现。

Result: LLMs在避免幻觉方面表现良好（准确率超90%），但在利用全部相关因素和适当放弃方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 自动化评估方法揭示了LLMs在法律任务中的局限性，强调了改进因素利用和放弃能力的必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in complex legal tasks
like argument generation, yet their reliability remains a concern. Building
upon pilot work assessing LLM generation of 3-ply legal arguments using human
evaluation, this paper introduces an automated pipeline to evaluate LLM
performance on this task, specifically focusing on faithfulness (absence of
hallucination), factor utilization, and appropriate abstention. We define
hallucination as the generation of factors not present in the input case
materials and abstention as the model's ability to refrain from generating
arguments when instructed and no factual basis exists. Our automated method
employs an external LLM to extract factors from generated arguments and
compares them against the ground-truth factors provided in the input case
triples (current case and two precedent cases). We evaluated eight distinct
LLMs on three tests of increasing difficulty: 1) generating a standard 3-ply
argument, 2) generating an argument with swapped precedent roles, and 3)
recognizing the impossibility of argument generation due to lack of shared
factors and abstaining. Our findings indicate that while current LLMs achieve
high accuracy (over 90%) in avoiding hallucination on viable argument
generation tests (Tests 1 & 2), they often fail to utilize the full set of
relevant factors present in the cases. Critically, on the abstention test (Test
3), most models failed to follow instructions to stop, instead generating
spurious arguments despite the lack of common factors. This automated pipeline
provides a scalable method for assessing these crucial LLM behaviors,
highlighting the need for improvements in factor utilization and robust
abstention capabilities before reliable deployment in legal settings. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集无法检测某些攻击性论证（如削弱攻击），且理论格式难以直观理解论证结构。

Method: 通过标注论证组件和关系，构建知识库图，应用假言推理形成论证，并生成带有属性的AKG。

Result: AKG能识别隐含推理规则和间接关系，支持论证的连贯性检查和修订。

Conclusion: AKG为未来推理任务提供了图形化工具，帮助模型学习隐含的间接关系。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework to convert argumentative texts into argument
knowledge graphs (AKG). Starting with basic annotations of argumentative
components (ACs) and argumentative relations (ARs), we enrich the information
by constructing a knowledge base (KB) graph with metadata attributes for nodes.
Next, we use premises and inference rules from the KB to form arguments by
applying modus ponens. From these arguments, we create an AKG. The nodes and
edges of the AKG have attributes that capture important argumentative features.
We also find missing inference rules by identifying markers. This makes it
possible to identify undercut attacks that were previously undetectable in
existing datasets. The AKG gives a graphical view of the argumentative
structure that is easier to understand than theoretical formats. It also
prepares the ground for future reasoning tasks, including checking the
coherence of arguments and identifying opportunities for revision. For this, it
is important to find indirect relations, many of which are implicit. Our
proposed AKG format, with annotated inference rules and modus ponens, will help
reasoning models learn the implicit indirect relations that require inference
over arguments and the relations between them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统E2E语音对话系统需要大量训练数据且生成的响应语义连贯性不足，因此需要一种更高效且有效的方法。

Method: 利用链式思维（CoT）策略，将对话数据训练与多模态语言模型（LM）的预训练任务（如语音识别、文本生成等）紧密结合。

Result: 在公开的人类对话数据集（如Switchboard）上，ROUGE-1分数提高了1.5以上，且仅需300小时数据即可高效训练。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了E2E语音对话系统的性能，同时降低了数据需求，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Unlike traditional cascaded pipelines, end-to-end (E2E) spoken dialogue
systems preserve full differentiability and capture non-phonemic information,
making them well-suited for modeling spoken interactions. However, existing E2E
approaches often require large-scale training data and generates responses
lacking semantic coherence. We propose a simple yet effective strategy
leveraging a chain-of-thought (CoT) formulation, ensuring that training on
conversational data remains closely aligned with the multimodal language model
(LM)'s pre-training on speech recognition~(ASR), text-to-speech synthesis
(TTS), and text LM tasks. Our method achieves over 1.5 ROUGE-1 improvement over
the baseline, successfully training spoken dialogue systems on publicly
available human-human conversation datasets, while being compute-efficient
enough to train on just 300 hours of public human-human conversation data, such
as the Switchboard. We will publicly release our models and training code.

Conclusion: 梯度微调框架能有效利用大型语言模型的表征能力，确保训练稳定性并减少对大量标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: This paper presents a gradient-informed fine-tuning method for large language
models under few-shot conditions. The goal is to enhance task adaptability and
training stability when data is limited. The method builds on a base loss
function and introduces two gradient-related regularization terms. The first
enforces gradient direction consistency to guide parameter updates along
task-relevant directions and prevent drift. The second controls gradient
magnitude to avoid abnormal updates. Together, these components support a more
efficient and stable optimization path. To further improve cross-task
generalization, the method incorporates a gradient alignment mechanism. This
mechanism measures the consistency between optimization directions of the
source and target tasks. It enhances fine-tuning performance in multi-task and
cross-domain scenarios. Across various natural language understanding tasks,
the method outperforms existing fine-tuning strategies in average accuracy,
gradient stability, and directional alignment. Empirical evaluations under
different sample sizes and domain-specific tasks confirm the method's
robustness and broad applicability in low-resource environments. In particular,
the method shows clear advantages in controlling parameter update paths. The
results demonstrate that a gradient-based fine-tuning framework can effectively
leverage the representational power of large language models. It ensures
training stability while reducing dependence on large volumes of labeled data.

Abstract: Narrative frames are a powerful way of conceptualizing and communicating
complex, controversial ideas, however automated frame analysis to date has
mostly overlooked this framing device. In this paper, we connect elements of
narrativity with fundamental aspects of framing, and present a framework which
formalizes and operationalizes such aspects. We annotate and release a data set
of news articles in the climate change domain, analyze the dominance of
narrative frame components across political leanings, and test LLMs in their
ability to predict narrative frames and their components. Finally, we apply our
framework in an unsupervised way to elicit components of narrative framing in a
second domain, the COVID-19 crisis, where our predictions are congruent with
prior theoretical work showing the generalizability of our approach.

Conclusion: Data Swarms能优化多目标组合并泛化至未见过的LLM，为LLM评估提供高效工具。

Abstract: We propose Data Swarms, an algorithm to optimize the generation of synthetic
evaluation data and advance quantitative desiderata of LLM evaluation. We first
train a swarm of initial data generators using existing data, and define
various evaluation objectives to reflect the desired properties of evaluation
(e.g., generate more difficult problems for the evaluated models) and
quantitatively evaluate data generators. We then employ particle swarm
optimization to optimize the swarm of data generators, where they
collaboratively search through the model parameter space to find new generators
that advance these objectives. We further extend it to Adversarial Swarms,
where the data generator swarm generates harder data while the test taker model
swarm learns from such data, co-evolving dynamically for better data and models
simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Data Swarms outperforms
eight data generation baselines across five evaluation objectives, while
Adversarial Swarms produce more robust learning of synthetic data and stronger
generalization. Further analysis reveals that Data Swarms successfully
optimizes compositions of multiple evaluation objectives and generalizes to new
off-the-shelf LLMs, unseen at optimization time.

Abstract: Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the de-facto approach in
adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) for downstream tasks in Natural Language
Processing. However, its adoption in privacy-preserving distributed learning
frameworks, such as Federated Learning (FL), remains relatively limited. This
is mainly due to challenges specific to FL, such as resource-constrained
devices and diverse data distributions among clients. In this paper, we propose
an efficient method to perform PEFT within the FL framework for Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) based language models. We address the challenges through head
pruning, a novel head-specific weighted aggregation mechanism, and a client
selection strategy. Head pruning minimizes training complexity within the
clients, guided by the importance score computed based on the confidence of the
attention head. Weighted aggregation of heads ensures the global model captures
crucial updates from diverse clients complementing our client selection
strategy. We show results on the MultiNLI benchmark along with 20 Newsgroups,
XL-Sum, and E2E NLG datasets. We use the MultiNLI dataset and T5-small model
with LoRA as our PEFT method, attaining sparsity levels of up to 90%, resulting
in a communication advantage of up to 1.8x and a reduction in training OPs of
3.9x while maintaining the accuracy drop under 2%.

Motivation: 解决机器翻译中性别偏见和逻辑一致性问题，特别是在性别中立语言（如波斯语、印尼语、芬兰语）与自然性别语言（如英语）之间的翻译。

Method: 引入TWC数据集（3,950个挑战性场景），评估多种技术（GPT-4、mBART-50、NLLB-200、Google Translate），并通过微调mBART-50优化性能。

Result: 主流模型在翻译性别中立内容时普遍存在性别偏见（偏好男性代词）和逻辑错误，微调后的mBART-50显著改善并超越专有模型。

Conclusion: 需针对性解决性别和语义一致性问题，推动更公平、准确的机器翻译系统，特别是对性别中立语言。

Abstract: Addressing gender bias and maintaining logical coherence in machine
translation remains challenging, particularly when translating between natural
gender languages, like English, and genderless languages, such as Persian,
Indonesian, and Finnish. We introduce the Translate-with-Care (TWC) dataset,
comprising 3,950 challenging scenarios across six low- to mid-resource
languages, to assess translation systems' performance. Our analysis of diverse
technologies, including GPT-4, mBART-50, NLLB-200, and Google Translate,
reveals a universal struggle in translating genderless content, resulting in
gender stereotyping and reasoning errors. All models preferred masculine
pronouns when gender stereotypes could influence choices. Google Translate and
GPT-4 showed particularly strong bias, favoring male pronouns 4-6 times more
than feminine ones in leadership and professional success contexts. Fine-tuning
mBART-50 on TWC substantially resolved these biases and errors, led to strong
generalization, and surpassed proprietary LLMs while remaining open-source.
This work emphasizes the need for targeted approaches to gender and semantic
coherence in machine translation, particularly for genderless languages,

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言环境中存在隐私泄露风险，并提出通过识别和停用隐私通用神经元和语言特定神经元来降低风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在多语言环境中的隐私泄露问题，尤其是当训练数据和查询语言不一致时的风险。

Method: 分析跨语言隐私泄露的信息流，识别隐私通用神经元和语言特定神经元，并通过停用这些神经元来降低风险。

Result: 停用相关神经元后，跨语言隐私泄露风险降低了23.3%-31.6%。

Conclusion: LLMs在多语言环境中存在隐私泄露风险，但通过针对性干预可以显著降低风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on massive data capture rich information
embedded in the training data. However, this also introduces the risk of
privacy leakage, particularly involving personally identifiable information
(PII). Although previous studies have shown that this risk can be mitigated
through methods such as privacy neurons, they all assume that both the
(sensitive) training data and user queries are in English. We show that they
cannot defend against the privacy leakage in cross-lingual contexts: even if
the training data is exclusively in one language, these (private) models may
still reveal private information when queried in another language. In this
work, we first investigate the information flow of cross-lingual privacy
leakage to give a better understanding. We find that LLMs process private
information in the middle layers, where representations are largely shared
across languages. The risk of leakage peaks when converted to a
language-specific space in later layers. Based on this, we identify
privacy-universal neurons and language-specific privacy neurons.
Privacy-universal neurons influence privacy leakage across all languages, while
language-specific privacy neurons are only related to specific languages. By
deactivating these neurons, the cross-lingual privacy leakage risk is reduced
by 23.3%-31.6%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态分割长文本的方法，通过语义相似度和问题感知分类器优化LLM对长文本的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前固定长度分割方法可能导致语义相关内容分离，影响LLM的准确理解。

Method: 计算相邻句子的语义相似度，动态分割为变长块；训练问题感知分类器选择关键块。

Result: 在单跳和多跳问答基准测试中表现优于基线，支持长达256k token的输入。

Conclusion: 动态分割和选择方法显著提升LLM对长文本的处理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often struggle to accurately read and comprehend
extremely long texts. Current methods for improvement typically rely on
splitting long contexts into fixed-length chunks. However, fixed truncation
risks separating semantically relevant content, leading to ambiguity and
compromising accurate understanding. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
straightforward approach for dynamically separating and selecting chunks of
long context, facilitating a more streamlined input for LLMs. In particular, we
compute semantic similarities between adjacent sentences, using lower
similarities to adaptively divide long contexts into variable-length chunks. We
further train a question-aware classifier to select sensitive chunks that are
critical for answering specific questions. Experimental results on both
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks show that the proposed
approach consistently outperforms strong baselines. Notably, it maintains
robustness across a wide range of input lengths, handling sequences of up to
256k tokens. Our datasets and code are available at the following link:

Motivation: 传统自动评估指标不可靠，人工评估成本高，因此探索LLMs作为评委的可行性。

Method: 比较8个LLMs作为评委对5个LLMs生成的响应进行评估，并提出结构化输出和领域适应技术。

Result: LLM评委表现差（低于50%准确率），结构化输出提升15%性能，领域适应技术进一步优化。

Conclusion: 结构化输出和领域适应技术能有效提升LLM评委在生物医学关系抽取中的评估性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in
biomedical relation extraction, even in zero-shot scenarios. However,
evaluating LLMs in this task remains challenging due to their ability to
generate human-like text, often producing synonyms or abbreviations of
gold-standard answers, making traditional automatic evaluation metrics
unreliable. On the other hand, while human evaluation is more reliable, it is
costly and time-consuming, making it impractical for real-world applications.
This paper investigates the use of LLMs-as-the-Judge as an alternative
evaluation method for biomedical relation extraction. We benchmark 8 LLMs as
judges to evaluate the responses generated by 5 other LLMs across 3 biomedical
relation extraction datasets. Unlike other text-generation tasks, we observe
that LLM-based judges perform quite poorly (usually below 50% accuracy) in the
biomedical relation extraction task. Our findings reveal that it happens mainly
because relations extracted by LLMs do not adhere to any standard format. To
address this, we propose structured output formatting for LLM-generated
responses that helps LLM-Judges to improve their performance by about 15% (on
average). We also introduce a domain adaptation technique to further enhance
LLM-Judge performance by effectively transferring knowledge between datasets.
We release both our human-annotated and LLM-annotated judgment data (36k
samples in total) for public use here:

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂推理任务中缺乏可解释性和可信度的问题，如幻觉或不可归因的推理过程。

Method: 提出KG-TRACES框架，联合监督模型预测符号关系路径、完整三元组推理路径，并生成基于推理路径的可归因推理过程。

Result: 在WebQSP和CWQ任务中，Hits@1和F1分数显著提升，并在医学等专业领域展示出可迁移性。

Conclusion: KG-TRACES通过显式监督实现了更稳定和目标导向的推理过程，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable strides in various natural
language processing tasks, but their performance on complex reasoning problems
remains hindered by a lack of explainability and trustworthiness. This issue,
often manifesting as hallucinations or unattributable reasoning processes,
limits their applicability in complex reasoning scenarios. To address this, we
propose Knowledge Graph-constrained Trajectory Reasoning Attribution and Chain
Explanation Supervision (KG-TRACES), a novel framework that enhances the
reasoning ability of LLMs through explicit supervision over reasoning paths and
processes. KG-TRACES jointly supervises the model to: (1) predict symbolic
relation paths, (2) predict full triple-level reasoning paths, and (3) generate
attribution-aware reasoning processes grounded in the reasoning paths. At
inference phase, the model adapts to both KG-available and KG-unavailable
scenarios, retrieving reasoning paths from a KG when possible or predicting
plausible reasoning paths with only intrinsic knowledge when not. This design
enables the model to reason in an explainable and source-attributable pattern.
Through extensive experiments on complex reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that
KG-TRACES significantly outperforms existing SOTA: it improves Hits@1 by 1.6%
and F1 by 4.7% on WebQSP, and achieves improvements of 4.8% in Hits@1 and 2.1%
in F1 on CWQ. Moreover, we show its transferability to specialized domains such
as medicine. By visualizing the intermediate steps of reasoning processes, we
further show that the explicit supervision introduced by KG-TRACES leads to
more stable and goal-directed reasoning processes, aligning closely with
correct answers. Code is available at https://github.com/Edaizi/KG-TRACES.

Motivation: 当前语言技术对文化能力的关注不足，且研究方法多依赖合成设置和不完美的文化代理。

Method: 通过访谈跨学科研究者，构建研究文化的语言规范框架，并用计算指标量化这些规范。

Result: 成功量化了人类研究论文中的文化规范，并揭示了LLMs在文化能力上的不足。

Conclusion: 以人为中心的方法是衡量文化规范的有效途径，同时凸显了LLMs在文化能力上的局限性。

Abstract: Improving cultural competence of language technologies is important. However
most recent works rarely engage with the communities they study, and instead
rely on synthetic setups and imperfect proxies of culture. In this work, we
take a human-centered approach to discover and measure language-based cultural
norms, and cultural competence of LLMs. We focus on a single kind of culture,
research cultures, and a single task, adapting writing across research
cultures. Through a set of interviews with interdisciplinary researchers, who
are experts at moving between cultures, we create a framework of structural,
stylistic, rhetorical, and citational norms that vary across research cultures.
We operationalise these features with a suite of computational metrics and use
them for (a) surfacing latent cultural norms in human-written research papers
at scale; and (b) highlighting the lack of cultural competence of LLMs, and
their tendency to homogenise writing. Overall, our work illustrates the
efficacy of a human-centered approach to measuring cultural norms in
human-written and LLM-generated texts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估很少测试RAG系统在真实噪声、内部与外部检索冲突或快速变化事实下的表现，因此提出RARE框架填补这一空白。

Method: RARE通过知识图谱驱动的合成管道（RARE-Get）自动生成多级问题集，构建大规模数据集（RARE-Set），并定义检索条件鲁棒性指标（RARE-Met）。

Result: RAG系统对干扰表现出显著脆弱性，文档鲁棒性是其最薄弱环节，且在多跳查询中表现更差。

Conclusion: RARE为RAG系统在动态环境中的鲁棒性评估提供了统一框架，揭示了其改进方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances recency and factuality in
answers. However, existing evaluations rarely test how well these systems cope
with real-world noise, conflicting between internal and external retrieved
contexts, or fast-changing facts. We introduce Retrieval-Aware Robustness
Evaluation (RARE), a unified framework and large-scale benchmark that jointly
stress-tests query and document perturbations over dynamic, time-sensitive
corpora. One of the central features of RARE is a knowledge-graph-driven
synthesis pipeline (RARE-Get) that automatically extracts single and multi-hop
relations from the customized corpus and generates multi-level question sets
without manual intervention. Leveraging this pipeline, we construct a dataset
(RARE-Set) spanning 400 expert-level time-sensitive finance, economics, and
policy documents and 48,322 questions whose distribution evolves as the
underlying sources change. To quantify resilience, we formalize
retrieval-conditioned robustness metrics (RARE-Met) that capture a model's
ability to remain correct or recover when queries, documents, or real-world
retrieval results are systematically altered. Our results show that RAG systems
exhibit surprising vulnerability to perturbations, with document robustness
consistently being the weakest point regardless of generator size or
architecture. RAG systems consistently show lower robustness on multi-hop
queries than single-hop queries across all domains.

Result: 在四个基准测试中显著提升开源和黑盒MLLM性能，验证了结合多样化认知策略与精细化视觉信息的重要性。

Conclusion: FOCUS通过动态适应问题复杂度，有效提升视觉问答任务性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with complex
reasoning tasks in Visual Question Answering (VQA). While current methods have
advanced by incorporating visual prompts, our study uncovers critical
limitations: these approaches indiscriminately annotate all detected objects
for every visual question, generating excessive visual markers that degrade
task performance. This issue stems primarily from a lack of focus on key visual
elements, raising two important questions: Are all objects equally important,
and do all questions require visual prompts? Motivated by Dual Process Theory,
which distinguishes between instinctive and deliberate cognitive modes in human
reasoning, we propose FOCUS, a plug-and-play approach that dynamically adapts
to the complexity of questions, combining fast intuitive judgments with
deliberate analytical reasoning to enhance the vision-language reasoning
capability of the MLLM. For straightforward questions, FOCUS supports efficient
zero-shot reasoning. For more complex tasks, it employs the conceptualizing
before observation strategy to highlight critical elements. Extensive
experiments on four benchmarks, ScienceQA, TextQA, VizWiz, and MME, demonstrate
that FOCUS consistently improves the performance of both open-source and
black-box MLLMs, achieving significant gains across all datasets. Ablation
studies further validate the importance of combining diverse cognitive
strategies with refined visual information for superior performance. Code will
be released.

TL;DR: GuessBench是一个评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在模拟人类创造力方面的新基准，基于Minecraft游戏数据，展示了VLMs在创造力建模中的挑战性和改进潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在评估VLMs在模拟人类创造力方面的能力，尤其是在噪声和多样化的真实场景中。

Method: 通过Minecraft游戏“Guess the Build”收集1500张图像并设计2000个问题，测试VLMs在静态和动态图像、自然语言提示等场景下的表现。

Result: 实验显示，即使是GPT-4o也有34%的错误率，开放模型与API模型性能差距显著（13.87% vs. 53.93%）。微调后，视觉感知任务平均提升15.36%。

Conclusion: GuessBench揭示了VLMs在创造力建模中的不足，尤其是在文化背景和低资源语言中的表现，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: We propose GuessBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates Vision Language
Models (VLMs) on modeling the pervasive, noisy, and pluralistic human
creativity. GuessBench sources data from "Guess the Build", an online
multiplayer Minecraft minigame where one player constructs a Minecraft build
given a concept (e.g. caterpillar) and others try to guess it with natural
language hints, presenting a pristine testbed for sensemaking creativity in the
wild with VLMs acting as guessers. We curate 1500 images from the actual
gameplay and design 2000 problems spanning static and dynamic image settings,
natural language hints of varying completeness, and more. Extensive experiments
with six open/API VLMs and five reasoning enhancement approaches demonstrate
that GuessBench presents a uniquely challenging task in creativity modeling:
even the start-of-the-art GPT-4o is incorrect on 34% of instances, while we
observe a huge performance gap (13.87% vs. 53.93% on average) between open and
API models. When used as a resource to improve VLMs, fine-tuning on the
reasoning traces for GuessBench problems improves visual perception tasks by
15.36% on average. Further analysis reveals that VLM performance in creativity
sensemaking correlates with the frequency of the concept in training data,
while the accuracy drops sharply for concepts in underrepresented cultural
contexts and low-resource languages.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决大语言模型在高资源语言中的进展未能惠及低资源语言（如梵语）的问题，特别是结构化诗歌生成。

Method: 方法包括构建一个用于英语散文翻译为梵语诗歌的数据集，并评估多种生成模型，探索约束解码策略和基于指令的微调。

Result: 结果显示，约束解码策略在生成语法有效的诗歌形式上达到99%以上的准确率，指令微调模型在语义和风格对齐上表现更好，但韵律精度略有下降。

Conclusion: 结论表明，LLMs可以通过特定策略成功适应低资源语言的诗歌生成，但需在韵律精度和语义对齐之间权衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language generation, including creative tasks like poetry composition.
However, most progress remains concentrated in high-resource languages. This
raises an important question: Can LLMs be adapted for structured poetic
generation in a low-resource, morphologically rich language such as Sanskrit?
In this work, we introduce a dataset designed for translating English prose
into structured Sanskrit verse, with strict adherence to classical metrical
patterns, particularly the Anushtub meter. We evaluate a range of generative
models-both open-source and proprietary-under multiple settings. Specifically,
we explore constrained decoding strategies and instruction-based fine-tuning
tailored to metrical and semantic fidelity. Our decoding approach achieves over
99% accuracy in producing syntactically valid poetic forms, substantially
outperforming general-purpose models in meter conformity. Meanwhile,
instruction-tuned variants show improved alignment with source meaning and
poetic style, as supported by human assessments, albeit with marginal
trade-offs in metrical precision.

Result: 实验表明OnceEdit在多模型编辑中表现优异，效率高且稳定。

Conclusion: OnceEdit为多模型知识编辑提供了高效、稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) encode vast world knowledge but struggle to stay
up-to-date, often leading to errors and hallucinations. Knowledge editing
offers an efficient alternative to retraining, enabling targeted modifications
by updating specific model parameters. However, existing methods primarily
focus on individual models, posing challenges in efficiently updating multiple
models and adapting to new models. To address this, we propose OnceEdit, a
novel ensemble-based approach that employs a plug-in model as the editing
module, enabling stable knowledge updates across multiple models. Building on
the model ensemble, OnceEdit introduces two key mechanisms to enhance its
effectiveness. First, we introduce a dynamic weight mechanism through a \weight
token for distinguishing between edit-related and non-edit-related instances,
ensuring the appropriate utilization of knowledge from integrated models.
Second, we incorporate an ensemble enhancement mechanism to mitigate the
excessive reliance on the central model inherent in the model ensemble
technique, making it more suitable for knowledge editing. Extensive experiments
on diverse LLMs demonstrate that OnceEdit consistently outperforms existing
methods while achieving superior editing efficiency. Further analysis confirms
its adaptability and stability in multi-model editing scenarios. Our code will
be available.

Result: 发现真实性方向在更强大的模型中更显著，且探针能有效泛化至多种任务，提升输出可信度。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对LLM内部真实性表征的理解，并展示了真实性探针的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on extensive datasets that
encapsulate substantial world knowledge. However, their outputs often include
confidently stated inaccuracies. Earlier works suggest that LLMs encode
truthfulness as a distinct linear feature, termed the "truth direction", which
can classify truthfulness reliably. We address several open questions about the
truth direction: (i) whether LLMs universally exhibit consistent truth
directions; (ii) whether sophisticated probing techniques are necessary to
identify truth directions; and (iii) how the truth direction generalizes across
diverse contexts. Our findings reveal that not all LLMs exhibit consistent
truth directions, with stronger representations observed in more capable
models, particularly in the context of logical negation. Additionally, we
demonstrate that truthfulness probes trained on declarative atomic statements
can generalize effectively to logical transformations, question-answering
tasks, in-context learning, and external knowledge sources. Finally, we explore
the practical application of truthfulness probes in selective
question-answering, illustrating their potential to improve user trust in LLM
outputs. These results advance our understanding of truth directions and
provide new insights into the internal representations of LLM beliefs. Our code

Motivation: 现有MMKGC方法在封闭世界假设下仅利用MMKG中的信息，且采用判别式训练目标，限制了推理能力。生成式方法在单模态知识图谱补全中表现优异，但在MMKGC中潜力未充分挖掘。

Method: HERGC框架包含异构专家表示检索器和生成式LLM预测器，前者融合多模态信息并检索候选集，后者基于指令数据微调以准确识别正确答案。

Result: 在三个标准MMKG基准测试中，HERGC表现出色，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HERGC通过异构专家表示和生成式补全的结合，有效解决了MMKGC问题，展示了强大的推理能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) enrich traditional knowledge graphs (KGs)
by incorporating diverse modalities such as images and text. Multi-modal
knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) seeks to exploit these heterogeneous signals
to infer missing facts, thereby mitigating the intrinsic incompleteness of
MMKGs. Existing MMKGC methods typically leverage only the information contained
in the MMKGs under the closed-world assumption and adopt discriminative
training objectives, which limits their reasoning capacity during completion.
Recent generative completion approaches powered by advanced large language
models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning abilities in unimodal knowledge graph
completion, but their potential in MMKGC remains largely unexplored. To bridge
this gap, we propose HERGC, a Heterogeneous Experts Representation and
Generative Completion framework for MMKGs. HERGC first deploys a Heterogeneous
Experts Representation Retriever that enriches and fuses multimodal information
and retrieves a compact candidate set for each incomplete triple. It then uses
a Generative LLM Predictor fine-tuned on minimal instruction data to accurately
identify the correct answer from these candidates. Extensive experiments on
three standard MMKG benchmarks demonstrate HERGC's effectiveness and
robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现有基准未能有效评估知识编辑方法在复杂推理和现实场景中的应用效果。

Method: 引入COMPKE基准，包含11,924个复杂问题，并对四种知识编辑方法进行广泛评估。

Result: 不同方法在不同模型上的效果差异显著，例如MeLLo在GPT-4O-MINI上准确率为39.47，而在QWEN2.5-3B上仅为3.83。

Conclusion: COMPKE为知识编辑提供了更全面的评估工具，揭示了方法在不同模型上的性能差异及其原因。

Abstract: Knowledge Editing, which efficiently modifies the knowledge in large language
models, has gathered great attention. Current benchmarks primarily use
multi-hop question answering to assess and analyze newly injected or updated
knowledge. However, we argue that these benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate
how well the updated models apply this knowledge in real-life scenarios,
particularly when questions require complex reasoning, involving one-to-many
relationships or multi-step logical intersections. To fill in this gap, we
introduce a new benchmark, COMPKE: Complex Question Answering under Knowledge
Editing, which includes 11,924 complex questions that reflect real-life
situations. We conduct an extensive evaluation of four knowledge editing
methods on COMPKE, revealing that their effectiveness varies notably across
different models. For instance, MeLLo attains an accuracy of 39.47 on
GPT-4O-MINI, but this drops sharply to 3.83 on QWEN2.5-3B. We further
investigate the underlying causes of these disparities from both methodological
and model-specific perspectives. The datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在结构化数据（如表格和数据库）上表现不佳，主要原因是预训练中缺乏相关数据以及文本到结构的转换机制不够灵活。

Method: 提出CoRE框架，利用对比性上下文学习和蒙特卡洛树搜索生成经验记忆，增强LLMs的泛化能力。

Result: 在Text-to-SQL和TableQA任务中，CoRE平均提升3.44%和4.24%的性能，最高提升17.2%。

Conclusion: CoRE是一种无需训练且持续的方法，显著提升了LLMs在结构化数据任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on plain text tasks
but underperform on structured data like tables and databases. Potential
challenges arise from their underexposure during pre-training and rigid
text-to-structure transfer mechanisms. Unlike humans who seamlessly apply
learned patterns across data modalities, LLMs struggle to infer implicit
relationships embedded in tabular formats, especially in the absence of
explicit structural guidance. To bridge this cognitive gap, we introduce
Contrastive Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Experience (CoRE), a framework
that builds experience memory representations and enhances generalization
through contrastive In-Context Learning (ICL) to simulate human-like knowledge
transfer. Experiments on Text-to-SQL and TableQA show CoRE significantly
improves performance, achieving average gains of 3.44% and 4.24%, with up to
17.2% on challenging tasks. Our Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-generated
Experience Memory expands training data 8-9x, enhancing diversity and domain
coverage. This training-free and continual method propels LLMs toward
structured knowledge expertise.

TL;DR: EEG2TEXT-CN是一个针对中文的开源词汇EEG到文本生成框架，结合生物启发的EEG编码器和预训练语言模型，通过掩码预训练和对比学习实现脑信号与语言的跨模态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索非语音、跨模态的脑信号解码为中文文本的可行性，为多语言脑-文本研究开辟新方向。

Method: 使用NICE-EEG编码器和MiniLM语言模型，通过掩码预训练和对比学习对齐脑信号与语言表示，采用零样本设置预测句子。

Result: 在1,500个训练验证句子和300个测试样本上，最佳BLEU-1得分为6.38%，显示词汇对齐的潜力，但句法流畅性仍需改进。

Conclusion: EEG2TEXT-CN证明了从EEG解码中文文本的可行性，为未来中文认知语言接口奠定了基础。

Abstract: We propose EEG2TEXT-CN, which, to the best of our knowledge, represents one
of the earliest open-vocabulary EEG-to-text generation frameworks tailored for
Chinese. Built on a biologically grounded EEG encoder (NICE-EEG) and a compact
pretrained language model (MiniLM), our architecture aligns multichannel brain
signals with natural language representations via masked pretraining and
contrastive learning. Using a subset of the ChineseEEG dataset, where each
sentence contains approximately ten Chinese characters aligned with 128-channel
EEG recorded at 256 Hz, we segment EEG into per-character embeddings and
predict full sentences in a zero-shot setting. The decoder is trained with
teacher forcing and padding masks to accommodate variable-length sequences.
Evaluation on over 1,500 training-validation sentences and 300 held-out test
samples shows promising lexical alignment, with a best BLEU-1 score of 6.38\%.
While syntactic fluency remains a challenge, our findings demonstrate the
feasibility of non-phonetic, cross-modal language decoding from EEG. This work
opens a new direction in multilingual brain-to-text research and lays the
foundation for future cognitive-language interfaces in Chinese.

TL;DR: 论文通过信息瓶颈（IB）原则解释了双向语言模型优于单向模型的原因，并提出FlowNIB方法动态估计互信息，验证了双向模型在信息保留和表示复杂性上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索双向语言模型在自然语言理解任务中优于单向模型的理论原因。

Method: 提出FlowNIB方法，动态估计训练中的互信息，解决经典IB方法的计算难题和固定权衡问题。

Result: 理论证明双向模型保留更多互信息且具有更高有效维度，实验验证了信息编码和压缩的动态过程。

Conclusion: 为双向架构的有效性提供了理论解释，并提出了分析深度语言模型中信息流的实用工具。

Abstract: Bidirectional language models have better context understanding and perform
better than unidirectional models on natural language understanding tasks, yet
the theoretical reasons behind this advantage remain unclear. In this work, we
investigate this disparity through the lens of the Information Bottleneck (IB)
principle, which formalizes a trade-off between compressing input information
and preserving task-relevant content. We propose FlowNIB, a dynamic and
scalable method for estimating mutual information during training that
addresses key limitations of classical IB approaches, including computational
intractability and fixed trade-off schedules. Theoretically, we show that
bidirectional models retain more mutual information and exhibit higher
effective dimensionality than unidirectional models. To support this, we
present a generalized framework for measuring representational complexity and
prove that bidirectional representations are strictly more informative under
mild conditions. We further validate our findings through extensive experiments
across multiple models and tasks using FlowNIB, revealing how information is
encoded and compressed throughout training. Together, our work provides a
principled explanation for the effectiveness of bidirectional architectures and
introduces a practical tool for analyzing information flow in deep language
models.

*Nidhi Kowtal,Raviraj Joshi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出L3Cube-MahaEmotions数据集，用于低资源语言（如马拉地语）的情感识别，通过LLM生成训练数据，人工标注验证和测试集。研究发现GPT-4优于微调BERT模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如马拉地语）情感识别中标注数据不足的问题。

Method: 使用Chain-of-Translation（CoTR）提示技术，将马拉地语句子翻译为英语并通过LLM标注情感标签，生成训练数据；验证和测试集人工标注。

Result: GPT-4在情感识别任务中表现优于微调BERT模型，但基于合成标签训练的BERT模型未能超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: 高质量人工标注数据对情感识别至关重要，通用LLM（如GPT-4）在低资源情感识别任务中表现优于微调BERT。

Abstract: Emotion recognition in low-resource languages like Marathi remains
challenging due to limited annotated data. We present L3Cube-MahaEmotions, a
high-quality Marathi emotion recognition dataset with 11 fine-grained emotion
labels. The training data is synthetically annotated using large language
models (LLMs), while the validation and test sets are manually labeled to serve
as a reliable gold-standard benchmark. Building on the MahaSent dataset, we
apply the Chain-of-Translation (CoTR) prompting technique, where Marathi
sentences are translated into English and emotion labeled via a single prompt.
GPT-4 and Llama3-405B were evaluated, with GPT-4 selected for training data
annotation due to superior label quality. We evaluate model performance using
standard metrics and explore label aggregation strategies (e.g., Union,
Intersection). While GPT-4 predictions outperform fine-tuned BERT models,
BERT-based models trained on synthetic labels fail to surpass GPT-4. This
highlights both the importance of high-quality human-labeled data and the
inherent complexity of emotion recognition. An important finding of this work
is that generic LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama3-405B generalize better than
fine-tuned BERT for complex low-resource emotion recognition tasks. The dataset
and model are shared publicly at https://github.com/l3cube-pune/MarathiNLP

*Zhaotian Weng,Haoxuan Li,Kuan-Hao Huang,Jieyu Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了两个新基准VQA-Causal和VCR-Causal，专门用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）的因果推理能力，发现VLMs在因果推理任务上表现不佳，主要原因是训练数据中缺乏明确的因果关系表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在因果推理能力上的表现尚不明确，且现有基准难以真正评估其能力，因此需要设计新的评测标准。

Method: 引入VQA-Causal和VCR-Causal两个新基准，通过隔离因果推理任务来评估VLMs，并探索基于困难负例的微调策略。

Result: VLMs在因果推理任务上表现差，仅略高于随机猜测，主要原因是训练数据中缺乏因果关系表达；针对性微调可提升其因果推理能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前VLMs在因果推理上的关键不足，为未来提升模型因果理解能力奠定了基础。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of vision-language models (VLMs) on
downstream tasks, their ability to understand and reason about causal
relationships in visual inputs remains unclear. Robust causal reasoning is
fundamental to solving complex high-level reasoning tasks, yet existing
benchmarks often include a mixture of reasoning questions, and VLMs can
frequently exploit object recognition and activity identification as shortcuts
to arrive at the correct answers, making it challenging to truly assess their
causal reasoning abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce VQA-Causal and
VCR-Causal, two new benchmarks specifically designed to isolate and rigorously
evaluate VLMs' causal reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal that while VLMs
excel in object and activity recognition, they perform poorly on causal
reasoning tasks, often only marginally surpassing random guessing. Further
analysis suggests that this limitation stems from a severe lack of causal
expressions in widely used training datasets, where causal relationships are
rarely explicitly conveyed. We additionally explore fine-tuning strategies with
hard negative cases, showing that targeted fine-tuning can improve model's
causal reasoning while maintaining generalization and downstream performance.
Our study highlights a key gap in current VLMs and lays the groundwork for
future work on causal understanding.

TL;DR: CC-Tuning是一种新的多语言微调方法，通过在潜在层面建立跨语言连接机制，显著提升大语言模型的多语言能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的多语言能力不均衡，主要受限于以英语为中心的语料库训练。现有方法多关注数据层面的调整，忽略了潜在层面的跨语言交互潜力。

Method: CC-Tuning在训练中融合英语和非英语输入的激活值，并通过可训练的决策机制选择有益激活。推理时使用转换矩阵模拟跨语言连接。

Result: 在22种语言的六个基准测试中，CC-Tuning表现优于传统微调方法，并展示了潜在层面交互的潜力。

Conclusion: CC-Tuning为提升大语言模型的多语言性能提供了实用且高效的解决方案，凸显了潜在层面交互的重要性。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often exhibit imbalanced multilingual
capabilities due to their English-centric training corpora. To address this,
existing fine-tuning approaches operating at the data-level (e.g., through data
augmentation or distillation) typically introduce implicit cross-lingual
alignment, overlooking the potential for more profound, latent-level
cross-lingual interactions. In this work, we propose CC-Tuning, a novel
multilingual fine-tuning paradigm that explicitly establishes a cross-lingual
connection mechanism at the latent level. During training, CC-Tuning fuses the
feed forward activations from both English and non-English inputs, enabling the
model to benefit from both linguistic resources. This process is facilitated
with a trainable Decision Maker that identifies beneficial activations.
Furthermore, during inference, a Transform Matrix is utilized to simulate the
cross-lingual connection under monolingual setting through representation
transformation. Our experiments on six benchmarks covering 22 languages show
that CC-Tuning outperforms vanilla SFT and offers a strong latent-level
alternative to data-level augmentation methods. Further analysis also
highlights the practicality of CC-Tuning and the potential of latent-level
cross-lingual interactions in advancing the multilingual performance of LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出选择性遗忘（SU）方法，仅针对目标文档中与不需要信息相关的关键子集进行遗忘，而非所有令牌。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统遗忘方法会无差别地更新模型参数以遗忘目标文档中的所有令牌，包括携带通用知识的常见令牌（如代词、介词等），这可能导致模型效用下降。

Method: 提出选择性遗忘（SU），识别遗忘集中与不需要信息相关的关键令牌子集，仅对这些令牌进行遗忘。

Result: 在两个基准和六种基线遗忘算法上的实验表明，SU不仅能有效遗忘目标数据，还能显著保留模型在保留集中的效用。

Conclusion: 选择性遗忘（SU）是一种更高效的遗忘方法，能够在遗忘不需要信息的同时保留模型的通用知识。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning has recently gained significant
attention, driven by the need to remove unwanted information, such as private,
sensitive, or copyrighted content, from LLMs. However, conventional unlearning
approaches indiscriminately update model parameters to forget all tokens in a
target document, including common tokens (e.g., pronouns, prepositions, general
nouns) that carry general knowledge. In this paper, we highlight that not every
token needs forgetting. We propose Selective Unlearning (SU), which identifies
a critical subset of tokens within the forgetting set that is relevant to the
unwanted information, and unlearns only those tokens. Experiments on two
benchmarks and six baseline unlearning algorithms demonstrate that SU not only
achieves effective unlearning on the targeted forget data, but also
significantly preserves the model's utility in the retaining set.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MLLM Interview（MITV）的策略，通过少量问题快速评估多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于全面测试MLLM在大规模数据上的表现资源消耗大且耗时，作者希望找到一种更高效的评估方法。

Method: 首先构建带难度标签的面试数据集，然后通过少量问题初步评估模型性能，并逐步测试其极限。

Result: 实验表明，MITV策略在MLLM基准数据集上表现良好，能通过少量问答快速评估模型能力。

Conclusion: MITV策略是一种高效且资源节约的MLLM评估方法。

Abstract: The rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) has led to a
wide range of MLLM applications, and a number of benchmark datasets have sprung
up in order to assess MLLM abilities. However, full-coverage Q&A testing on
large-scale data is resource-intensive and time-consuming. To address this
issue, we propose the MLLM Interview (MITV) strategy, which aims to quickly
obtain MLLM performance metrics by quizzing fewer question. First, First, we
constructed the interview dataset, which was built on an existing MLLM
assessment dataset, by adding difficulty labels based on the performance of
some typical MLLMs in this dataset. Second, we propose an MLLM Interview
strategy, which obtains an initial performance situation of the large model by
quizzing a small number of topics and then continuously tries to test the
model's limits. Through extensive experiments, the result shows that the MITV
strategy proposed in this paper performs well on MLLM benchmark datasets, and
it is able to obtain the model evaluation capability faster through a small
number of questions and answers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了A4Bench基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在感知环境行动可能性（affordance）方面的能力，发现现有模型表现有限，尤其在动态和上下文感知方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其感知环境行动可能性的能力尚未充分研究，这对实现直观和安全的交互至关重要。

Method: 设计了A4Bench基准，包含1,282个问题-答案对评估固有属性理解（Constitutive Affordance），以及718个问题-答案对评估动态和上下文感知（Transformative Affordance）。

Result: 评估17个MLLMs（9个专有和8个开源）发现，专有模型表现优于开源模型，但所有模型能力有限，尤其在动态感知方面，且远低于人类表现。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLMs在环境理解上的关键不足，为开发更具鲁棒性和上下文感知能力的AI系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Affordance theory posits that environments inherently offer action
possibilities that shape perception and behavior. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks, their ability to
perceive affordance, which is crucial for intuitive and safe interactions,
remains underexplored. To address this, we introduce A4Bench, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate the affordance perception abilities of MLLMs across two
dimensions: 1) Constitutive Affordance}, assessing understanding of inherent
object properties through 1,282 question-answer pairs spanning nine
sub-disciplines, and 2) Transformative Affordance, probing dynamic and
contextual nuances (e.g., misleading, time-dependent, cultural, or
individual-specific affordance) with 718 challenging question-answer pairs.
Evaluating 17 MLLMs (nine proprietary and eight open-source) against human
performance, we find that proprietary models generally outperform open-source
counterparts, but all exhibit limited capabilities, particularly in
transformative affordance perception. Furthermore, even top-performing models,
such as Gemini-2.0-Pro (18.05% overall exact match accuracy), significantly lag
behind human performance (best: 85.34%, worst: 81.25%). These findings
highlight critical gaps in environmental understanding of MLLMs and provide a
foundation for advancing AI systems toward more robust, context-aware
interactions. The dataset is available in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs的社交智能及其与人类的差异，填补现有工作在结果和过程导向评估上的空白。

Method: 设计SocialEval基准，通过手工编写的叙事脚本构建世界树，评估LLMs在社交互动中的表现。

Result: LLMs在社交智能上落后于人类，表现出亲社会性，倾向于积极社交行为，即使导致目标失败。

Conclusion: LLMs在社交智能上与人类存在差距，但其能力特定的功能分区类似于人脑。

Abstract: LLMs exhibit promising Social Intelligence (SI) in modeling human behavior,
raising the need to evaluate LLMs' SI and their discrepancy with humans. SI
equips humans with interpersonal abilities to behave wisely in navigating
social interactions to achieve social goals. This presents an operational
evaluation paradigm: outcome-oriented goal achievement evaluation and
process-oriented interpersonal ability evaluation, which existing work fails to
address. To this end, we propose SocialEval, a script-based bilingual SI
benchmark, integrating outcome- and process-oriented evaluation by manually
crafting narrative scripts. Each script is structured as a world tree that
contains plot lines driven by interpersonal ability, providing a comprehensive
view of how LLMs navigate social interactions. Experiments show that LLMs fall
behind humans on both SI evaluations, exhibit prosociality, and prefer more
positive social behaviors, even if they lead to goal failure. Analysis of LLMs'
formed representation space and neuronal activations reveals that LLMs have
developed ability-specific functional partitions akin to the human brain.

Motivation: 现有基于提示的方法在自然语言与SQL程序之间存在语义鸿沟，导致准确性受限。

Method: Pi-SQL首先生成Python程序，提供细粒度指导，再根据Python程序生成SQL程序，并通过候选策略选择优化执行速度。

Result: Pi-SQL的执行准确率比最佳基线提升高达3.20，效率评分高4.55。

Conclusion: Pi-SQL通过Python中介有效缩小语义鸿沟，显著提升SQL生成的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL transforms the user queries from natural language to executable
SQL programs, enabling non-experts to interact with complex databases. Existing
prompt-based methods craft meticulous text guidelines and examples to
facilitate SQL generation, but their accuracy is hindered by the large semantic
gap between the texts and the low-resource SQL programs. In this work, we
propose Pi-SQL, which incorporates the high-resource Python program as a pivot
to bridge between the natural language query and SQL program. In particular,
Pi-SQL first generates Python programs that provide fine-grained step-by-step
guidelines in their code blocks or comments, and then produces an SQL program
following the guidance of each Python program.The final SQL program matches the
reference Python program's query results and, through selection from candidates
generated by different strategies, achieves superior execution speed, with a
reward-based valid efficiency score up to 4.55 higher than the best-performing
baseline.Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pi-SQL, which
improves the execution accuracy of the best-performing baseline by up to 3.20.

Result: 线性回归模型表现最佳，大多数嵌入模型组合性较强，BERT表现较差。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对组合性的全面分析，揭示了不同模型的组合性表现差异。

Abstract: Compositionality is a key aspect of human intelligence, essential for
reasoning and generalization. While transformer-based models have become the de
facto standard for many language modeling tasks, little is known about how they
represent compound words, and whether these representations are compositional.
In this study, we test compositionality in Mistral, OpenAI Large, and Google
embedding models, and compare them with BERT. First, we evaluate
compositionality in the representations by examining six diverse models of
compositionality (addition, multiplication, dilation, regression, etc.). We
find that ridge regression, albeit linear, best accounts for compositionality.
Surprisingly, we find that the classic vector addition model performs almost as
well as any other model. Next, we verify that most embedding models are highly
compositional, while BERT shows much poorer compositionality. We verify and
visualize our findings with a synthetic dataset consisting of fully transparent
adjective-noun compositions. Overall, we present a thorough investigation of
compositionality.

Motivation: 现有ECG-focused MLLMs主要局限于单一任务和固定输入格式，未能充分发挥MLLMs的潜力。

Method: 构建anyECG数据集，提出anyECG-chat模型，支持动态长度和多ECG输入，采用三阶段课程训练方法。

Result: anyECG-chat能支持多种实际应用场景，包括报告生成、异常波形定位和多ECG比较分析。

Conclusion: anyECG-chat和anyECG数据集为ECG分析提供了更灵活和全面的解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has sparked interest
in their application to electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis. However, existing
ECG-focused MLLMs primarily focus on report generation tasks, often limited to
single 12-lead, short-duration (10s) ECG inputs, thereby underutilizing the
potential of MLLMs. To this end, we aim to develop a MLLM for ECG analysis that
supports a broader range of tasks and more flexible ECG inputs. However,
existing ECG-QA datasets are often monotonous. To address this gap, we first
constructed the anyECG dataset, which encompasses a wide variety of tasks,
including report generation, abnormal waveform localization, and open-ended
question answering. In addition to standard hospital ECGs, we introduced
long-duration reduced-lead ECGs for home environments and multiple ECG
comparison scenarios commonly encountered in clinical practice. Furthermore, we
propose the anyECG-chat model, which supports dynamic-length ECG inputs and
multiple ECG inputs. We trained the model using a three-stage curriculum
training recipe with the anyECG dataset. A comprehensive evaluation was
conducted, demonstrating that anyECG-chat is capable of supporting various
practical application scenarios, including not only common report generation
tasks but also abnormal waveform localization for long-duration reduced-lead
ECGs in home environments and comprehensive comparative analysis of multiple
ECGs.

Motivation: 讽刺检测在语音中因数据稀缺和多模态依赖而具有挑战性，需要一种仅依赖语音的解决方案。

Result: 检测模型在公开数据集上达到73.63%的F1分数，验证了数据集的潜力。

Conclusion: 提出的标注流程和PodSarc数据集为讽刺语音检测研究提供了有效的工具和基准。

Abstract: Sarcasm fundamentally alters meaning through tone and context, yet detecting
it in speech remains a challenge due to data scarcity. In addition, existing
detection systems often rely on multimodal data, limiting their applicability
in contexts where only speech is available. To address this, we propose an
annotation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate a
sarcasm dataset. Using a publicly available sarcasm-focused podcast, we employ
GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 for initial sarcasm annotations, followed by human
verification to resolve disagreements. We validate this approach by comparing
annotation quality and detection performance on a publicly available sarcasm
dataset using a collaborative gating architecture. Finally, we introduce
PodSarc, a large-scale sarcastic speech dataset created through this pipeline.
The detection model achieves a 73.63% F1 score, demonstrating the dataset's
potential as a benchmark for sarcasm detection research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视教育目标且仅支持简单问题生成，无法满足复杂需求。

Method: 提出EQPR方法，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索和大型语言模型，采用“计划-评估-优化”流程。

Result: 实验表明EQPR在多维度教育目标问题生成上显著提升。

Conclusion: EQPR能有效生成符合教育目标的高质量数学问题。

Abstract: Automatically generating high-quality mathematical problems that align with
educational objectives is a crucial task in NLP-based educational technology.
Traditional generation methods focus primarily on textual quality, but they
often overlook educational objectives. Moreover, these methods address only
single-dimensional, simple question generation, failing to meet complex,
multifaceted educational requirements. To address these challenges, we
constructed and annotated EduMath, a dataset of 16k mathematical questions with
multi-dimensional educational objectives. Based on this dataset, we developed
EQGEVAL, which incorporates three evaluation dimensions and is designed to
assess the ability of models to generate educational questions. Drawing
inspiration from teachers' problem design processes, we propose the Educational
Question Planning with self-Reflection (EQPR) method for educational
mathematical question generation, following a "plan-evaluate-optimize"
approach. Specifically, by combining planning algorithm based on Monte Carlo
Tree Search with the generative capabilities of Large Language Models, we
continuously optimize questions through iterative feedback. This
self-optimization mechanism ensures that the generated questions both fit the
educational context and strategically achieve specific basic educational
objectives. Through extensive experiments based on EQGEVAL, we have
demonstrated that EQPR achieves significant improvements in generating
questions that meet multi-dimensional educational objectives.

Result: 模型在未授权请求管理上表现差异显著，但能有效处理合法查询。

Conclusion: 为敏感性感知语言模型奠定基准，为企业隐私中心AI系统提供改进方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly becoming valuable to corporate
data management due to their ability to process text from various document
formats and facilitate user interactions through natural language queries.
However, LLMs must consider the sensitivity of information when communicating
with employees, especially given access restrictions. Simple filtering based on
user clearance levels can pose both performance and privacy challenges. To
address this, we propose the concept of sensitivity awareness (SA), which
enables LLMs to adhere to predefined access rights rules. In addition, we
developed a benchmarking environment called ACCESS DENIED INC to evaluate SA.
Our experimental findings reveal significant variations in model behavior,
particularly in managing unauthorized data requests while effectively
addressing legitimate queries. This work establishes a foundation for
benchmarking sensitivity-aware language models and provides insights to enhance
privacy-centric AI systems in corporate environments.

*Vadivel Abishethvarman,Bhavik Chandna,Pratik Jalan,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: XGUARD是一个评估框架，用于分析LLM生成的极端内容的风险等级，通过五级分类和Attack Severity Curve（ASC）提供更细致的评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全评估过于简单，忽略了LLM生成内容的复杂风险谱，需要更细致的评估方法。

Method: XGUARD包含3,840个真实数据源的红队提示，将模型响应分为五个危险等级，并引入ASC可视化漏洞。

Result: 评估了六种流行LLM和两种轻量级防御策略，揭示了安全漏洞及鲁棒性与表达自由之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 分级安全指标对构建可信LLM至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate content spanning ideological
rhetoric to explicit instructions for violence. However, existing safety
evaluations often rely on simplistic binary labels (safe and unsafe),
overlooking the nuanced spectrum of risk these outputs pose. To address this,
we present XGUARD, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the
severity of extremist content generated by LLMs. XGUARD includes 3,840 red
teaming prompts sourced from real world data such as social media and news,
covering a broad range of ideologically charged scenarios. Our framework
categorizes model responses into five danger levels (0 to 4), enabling a more
nuanced analysis of both the frequency and severity of failures. We introduce
the interpretable Attack Severity Curve (ASC) to visualize vulnerabilities and
compare defense mechanisms across threat intensities. Using XGUARD, we evaluate
six popular LLMs and two lightweight defense strategies, revealing key insights
into current safety gaps and trade-offs between robustness and expressive
freedom. Our work underscores the value of graded safety metrics for building
trustworthy LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的生成建模范式NTPP，利用双通道语音数据提升语音语言模型的对话能力，显著改善了响应连贯性和自然性，同时降低了推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音语言模型未能充分利用双通道语音数据，限制了其在自然对话中的表现。

Method: 引入Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP)方法，首次在仅解码器架构中实现独立于说话者的双通道语音对话学习。

Result: NTPP在标准测试中显著提升了模型的对话能力（如轮转预测、响应连贯性和自然性），并大幅降低了推理延迟。

Conclusion: NTPP为语音语言模型在实时应用中的高效对话生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inspired by the impressive capabilities of GPT-4o, there is growing interest
in enabling speech language models (SLMs) to engage in natural, fluid spoken
interactions with humans. Recent advancements have led to the development of
several SLMs that demonstrate promising results in this area. However, current
approaches have yet to fully exploit dual-channel speech data, which inherently
captures the structure and dynamics of human conversation. In this work, we
systematically explore the use of dual-channel speech data in the context of
modern large language models, and introduce a novel generative modeling
paradigm, Next-Token-Pair Prediction (NTPP), to enable speaker-independent
dual-channel spoken dialogue learning using decoder-only architectures for the
first time. We evaluate our approach on standard benchmarks, and empirical
results show that our proposed method, NTPP, significantly improves the
conversational abilities of SLMs in terms of turn-taking prediction, response
coherence, and naturalness. Moreover, compared to existing methods, NTPP
achieves substantially lower inference latency, highlighting its practical
efficiency for real-time applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LEMONADE是一个大规模多语言冲突事件数据集，基于ACLED数据重新标注，并提出抽象事件提取（AEE）和抽象实体链接（AEL）方法。零-shot系统表现优于传统模型，但仍落后于监督系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言源数据聚合的挑战，提升全球事件分析的准确性和覆盖范围。

Method: 引入AEE和AEL方法，通过整体文档理解检测事件参数和实体，并评估多种大语言模型（LLMs）和零-shot系统（如ZEST）。

Result: 最佳零-shot系统在端到端任务中F1得分为58.3%，ZEST在AEL任务中F1得分为45.7%，均优于传统基线。

Conclusion: 零-shot方法表现良好，但仍需进一步研究以缩小与监督系统的差距。

Abstract: This paper presents LEMONADE, a large-scale conflict event dataset comprising
39,786 events across 20 languages and 171 countries, with extensive coverage of
region-specific entities. LEMONADE is based on a partially reannotated subset
of the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED), which has documented
global conflict events for over a decade.
  To address the challenge of aggregating multilingual sources for global event
analysis, we introduce abstractive event extraction (AEE) and its subtask,
abstractive entity linking (AEL). Unlike conventional span-based event
extraction, our approach detects event arguments and entities through holistic
document understanding and normalizes them across the multilingual dataset. We
evaluate various large language models (LLMs) on these tasks, adapt existing
zero-shot event extraction systems, and benchmark supervised models.
Additionally, we introduce ZEST, a novel zero-shot retrieval-based system for
AEL.
  Our best zero-shot system achieves an end-to-end F1 score of 58.3%, with LLMs
outperforming specialized event extraction models such as GoLLIE. For entity
linking, ZEST achieves an F1 score of 45.7%, significantly surpassing OneNet, a
state-of-the-art zero-shot baseline that achieves only 23.7%. However, these
zero-shot results lag behind the best supervised systems by 20.1% and 37.0% in
the end-to-end and AEL tasks, respectively, highlighting the need for further
research.

TL;DR: 研究探讨自监督模型学习的语音表征是否具有语言特异性，发现荷兰语预训练能更好地编码荷兰语的语言特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自监督模型在不同语言预训练下对特定语言特征的编码能力。

Method: 测试Wav2Vec2模型在荷兰语预训练下对荷兰语音系和词汇信息的编码效果，并与英语及多语言预训练对比。

Result: 荷兰语预训练显著提升荷兰语特征的编码效果，且与下游语音识别性能相关。

Conclusion: 语言特异性预训练能优化模型对目标语言特征的编码能力。

Abstract: How language-specific are speech representations learned by self-supervised
models? Existing work has shown that a range of linguistic features can be
successfully decoded from end-to-end models trained only on speech recordings.
However, it's less clear to what extent pre-training on specific languages
improves language-specific linguistic information. Here we test the encoding of
Dutch phonetic and lexical information in internal representations of
self-supervised Wav2Vec2 models. Pre-training exclusively on Dutch improves the
representation of Dutch linguistic features as compared to pre-training on
similar amounts of English or larger amounts of multilingual data. This
language-specific advantage is well-detected by trained clustering or
classification probes, and partially observable using zero-shot metrics.
Furthermore, the language-specific benefit on linguistic feature encoding
aligns with downstream performance on Automatic Speech Recognition.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于大语言模型（LLM）的新方法，用于从日记中识别和聚类写作目的，并在苏联时期的日记数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理大规模日记语料时效果不佳，因此需要一种更有效的方法来提取日记写作的意图。

Method: 使用不同的大语言模型（包括GPT-4o和o1-mini）对日记进行分析，并与基于模板的基线方法进行比较。

Result: GPT-4o和o1-mini表现最佳，而基线方法效果较差。研究还分析了写作目的与作者性别、年龄及写作年份的关系，并探讨了模型的错误类型。

Conclusion: 该方法在日记分析中表现出色，但也揭示了模型的局限性，为未来研究提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Diary analysis presents challenges, particularly in extracting meaningful
information from large corpora, where traditional methods often fail to deliver
satisfactory results. This study introduces a novel method based on Large
Language Models (LLMs) to identify and cluster the various purposes of diary
writing. By "purposes," we refer to the intentions behind diary writing, such
as documenting life events, self-reflection, or practicing language skills. Our
approach is applied to Soviet-era diaries (1922-1929) from the Prozhito digital
archive, a rich collection of personal narratives. We evaluate different
proprietary and open-source LLMs, finding that GPT-4o and o1-mini achieve the
best performance, while a template-based baseline is significantly less
effective. Additionally, we analyze the retrieved purposes based on gender, age
of the authors, and the year of writing. Furthermore, we examine the types of
errors made by the models, providing a deeper understanding of their
limitations and potential areas for improvement in future research.

Conclusion: 该工具展示了LLM在提升数字档案交互直觉性和包容性方面的潜力，有望改变人文研究方式。

Abstract: Access to humanities research databases is often hindered by the limitations
of traditional interaction formats, particularly in the methods of searching
and response generation. This study introduces an LLM-based smart assistant
designed to facilitate natural language communication with digital humanities
data. The assistant, developed in a chatbot format, leverages the RAG approach
and integrates state-of-the-art technologies such as hybrid search, automatic
query generation, text-to-SQL filtering, semantic database search, and
hyperlink insertion. To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, experiments
were conducted to assess the response quality of various language models. The
testing was based on the Prozhito digital archive, which contains diary entries
from predominantly Russian-speaking individuals who lived in the 20th century.
The chatbot is tailored to support anthropology and history researchers, as
well as non-specialist users with an interest in the field, without requiring
prior technical training. By enabling researchers to query complex databases
with natural language, this tool aims to enhance accessibility and efficiency
in humanities research. The study highlights the potential of Large Language
Models to transform the way researchers and the public interact with digital
archives, making them more intuitive and inclusive. Additional materials are

Abstract: Understanding the internal mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) remains
a challenging and complex endeavor. Even fundamental questions, such as how
fine-tuning affects model behavior, often require extensive empirical
evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective based on the
geometric properties of contextual latent embeddings to study the effects of
training and fine-tuning. To that end, we measure the local dimensions of a
contextual language model's latent space and analyze their shifts during
training and fine-tuning. We show that the local dimensions provide insights
into the model's training dynamics and generalization ability. Specifically,
the mean of the local dimensions predicts when the model's training
capabilities are exhausted, as exemplified in a dialogue state tracking task,
overfitting, as demonstrated in an emotion recognition task, and grokking, as
illustrated with an arithmetic task. Furthermore, our experiments suggest a
practical heuristic: reductions in the mean local dimension tend to accompany
and predict subsequent performance gains. Through this exploration, we aim to
provide practitioners with a deeper understanding of the implications of
fine-tuning on embedding spaces, facilitating informed decisions when
configuring models for specific applications. The results of this work
contribute to the ongoing discourse on the interpretability, adaptability, and
generalizability of LLMs by bridging the gap between intrinsic model mechanisms
and geometric properties in the respective embeddings.

### [130] [Probing Neural Topology of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01042)
*Yu Zheng,Yuan Yuan,Yong Li,Paolo Santi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“graph probing”的方法，用于揭示大语言模型（LLM）神经元的功能连接拓扑结构，并将其与语言生成性能相关联。研究发现，仅通过神经拓扑结构即可普遍预测下一个词预测性能，且这种预测性在仅保留1%神经元连接或模型仅经过8次预训练步骤后仍稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管通过探测LLM已获得对其内部机制的理解，但神经元如何通过功能共激活产生涌现能力仍不清楚，这阻碍了对LLM的深入理解和安全开发。

Method: 引入graph probing方法，分析不同LLM家族和规模的内部神经图，研究神经拓扑结构与语言生成性能的关系。

Result: 发现神经拓扑结构能普遍预测下一个词预测性能，且这种预测性具有稀疏性和早期涌现性。不同LLM尽管架构、参数和训练数据差异显著，但会形成一致且复杂的神经拓扑结构。

Conclusion: 神经拓扑结构可能是LLM语言生成能力的基础，graph probing为理解LLM提供了新工具。

Abstract: Probing large language models (LLMs) has yielded valuable insights into their
internal mechanisms by linking neural representations to interpretable
semantics. However, how neurons functionally co-activate with each other to
give rise to emergent capabilities remains largely unknown, hindering a deeper
understanding and safer development of LLMs. In this work, we introduce graph
probing, a method for uncovering the functional connectivity topology of LLM
neurons and relating it to language generation performance. By analyzing
internal neural graphs across diverse LLM families and scales, we discover a
universal predictability of next-token prediction performance using only neural
topology. This predictability is robust even when retaining just 1% of neuron
connections or probing models after only 8 pretraining steps, highlighting the
sparsity and early emergence of topological patterns. Further graph matching
analysis suggests that, despite significant distinctions in architectures,
parameters, and training data, different LLMs develop intricate and consistent
neural topological structures that may form the foundation for their language
generation abilities. Codes and data for the graph probing toolbox are released
at https://github.com/DavyMorgan/llm-graph-probing.

Using automatic best-worst scaling with large language models, we achieve

chain-of-thought reasoning significantly improve emotion recognition accuracy,
enabling smaller models to achieve competitive performance with larger ones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决现有搜索增强语言模型在复杂事实性问题中的局限性，特别是在搜索结果不理想时的表现问题。

Method: 设计了三个版本的SealQA基准测试，分别评估模型的准确性、推理能力和长文本处理能力，并对多个前沿模型进行了测试。

Result: 前沿模型在SealQA中表现不佳，例如在Seal-0中最高准确率仅为17.1%。增加计算资源未能显著提升性能，且模型对嘈杂搜索结果敏感。

Conclusion: SealQA揭示了当前模型的局限性，尤其是在复杂和嘈杂环境中的表现不足，为未来研究提供了新的挑战和方向。

Abstract: We introduce SealQA, a new challenge benchmark for evaluating
SEarch-Augmented Language models on fact-seeking questions where web search
yields conflicting, noisy, or unhelpful results. SealQA comes in three flavors:
(1) Seal-0 (main) and (2) Seal-Hard, which assess factual accuracy and
reasoning capabilities, with Seal-0 focusing on the most challenging questions
where chat models (e.g., GPT-4.1) typically achieve near-zero accuracy; and (3)
LongSeal, which extends SealQA to test long-context, multi-document reasoning
in "needle-in-a-haystack" settings. Our evaluation reveals critical limitations
in current models: Even frontier LLMs perform poorly across all SealQA flavors.
On Seal-0, frontier agentic models equipped with tools like o3 and o4-mini
achieve only 17.1% and 6.3% accuracy, respectively, at their best reasoning
efforts. We find that advanced reasoning models such as DeepSeek-R1-671B and
o3-mini are highly vulnerable to noisy search results. Notably, increasing
test-time compute does not yield reliable gains across o3-mini, o4-mini, and
o3, with performance often plateauing or even declining early. Additionally,
while recent models are less affected by the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, they
still fail to reliably identify relevant documents in LongSeal when faced with
numerous distractors. To facilitate future work, we release SealQA at
huggingface.co/datasets/vtllms/sealqa.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在多编程语言和英语混合环境中的内部表示机制，填补现有研究主要关注单语言编程任务的空白。

Method: 使用两个基于Llama的模型进行21对PL的少样本翻译任务，解码中间层嵌入并分析神经元激活。

Result: 概念空间更接近英语，语言特定神经元集中在底层，而PL专属神经元出现在顶层；高度对齐的PL难以识别语言特定神经元。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLMs内部表示PL的结构模式，为理解模型概念空间提供了新视角。

Abstract: Several studies have explored the mechanisms of large language models (LLMs)
in coding tasks, but most have focused on programming languages (PLs) in a
monolingual setting. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between
multiple PLs and English in the concept space of LLMs. We perform a few-shot
translation task on 21 PL pairs using two Llama-based models. By decoding the
embeddings of intermediate layers during this task, we observe that the concept
space is closer to English (including PL keywords) and assigns high
probabilities to English tokens in the second half of the intermediate layers.
We analyze neuron activations for 11 PLs and English, finding that while
language-specific neurons are primarily concentrated in the bottom layers,
those exclusive to each PL tend to appear in the top layers. For PLs that are
highly aligned with multiple other PLs, identifying language-specific neurons
is not feasible. These PLs also tend to have a larger keyword set than other
PLs and are closer to the model's concept space regardless of the input/output
PL in the translation task. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs
internally represent PLs, revealing structural patterns in the model's concept
space. Code is available at https://github.com/cisnlp/code-specific-neurons.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: zip2zip框架通过动态调整词汇表减少LLM的token序列长度，提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态tokenizer无法适应领域或语言特定输入，导致计算成本高。

Method: 基于LZW压缩的tokenizer、运行时嵌入层和因果语言建模变体。

Result: 输入输出序列长度减少20-60%，推理延迟显著改善。

Conclusion: zip2zip能以低成本高效优化LLM的tokenization效率。

Abstract: Tokenization efficiency plays a critical role in the performance and cost of
large language models (LLMs), yet most models rely on static tokenizers
optimized for general-purpose corpora. These tokenizers' fixed vocabularies
often fail to adapt to domain- or language-specific inputs, leading to longer
token sequences and higher computational costs. We introduce zip2zip, a
framework that enables LLMs to dynamically adjust token vocabulary at inference
time, allowing for fewer generated tokens and thus faster inference. zip2zip
consists of three key components: (1) a tokenizer based on Lempel-Ziv-Welch
(LZW) compression that incrementally compresses tokens into reusable
"hypertokens" on the fly; (2) an embedding layer that computes embeddings for
newly formed hypertokens at runtime; and (3) a causal language modeling variant
that trains the model to operate on hypertokenized, compressed sequences. We
show that an existing LLM can be zip2zip-fied in 10 GPU-hours via
parameter-efficient finetuning. The resulting zip2zip LLMs effectively learn to
use hypertokens at inference time, reducing input and output sequence length by
20-60\%, with significant improvements in inference latency.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在指代消解任务中处理索引词（如I、you、here、tomorrow）的表现，发现模型对某些索引词表现优异（如I），但对其他词（如you、here、tomorrow）表现较差，并分析了句法线索的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往研究主要关注名词和第三人称代词的指代消解，而索引词的独特语言特性带来新挑战，因此需要评估LLMs在此类任务中的表现。

Method: 研究构建了包含1600道多选题的英语索引数据集，并评估了包括GPT-4o、Claude 3.5 Sonnet等在内的领先LLMs。

Result: LLMs对某些索引词（如I）表现优异，但对其他词（如you、here、tomorrow）表现较差；句法线索（如引号）对不同索引词的影响不一致。

Conclusion: LLMs在处理索引词时表现不一，句法线索的作用因词而异，未来研究需进一步优化模型在此类任务中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performances in
tasks related to coreference resolution. However, previous studies mostly
assessed LLM performance on coreference resolution with nouns and third person
pronouns. This study evaluates LLM performance on coreference resolution with
indexical like I, you, here and tomorrow, which come with unique challenges due
to their linguistic properties. We present the first study examining how LLMs
interpret indexicals in English, releasing the English Indexical Dataset with
1600 multiple-choice questions. We evaluate pioneering LLMs, including GPT-4o,
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and DeepSeek V3. Our results reveal that
LLMs exhibit an impressive performance with some indexicals (I), while
struggling with others (you, here, tomorrow), and that syntactic cues (e.g.
quotation) contribute to LLM performance with some indexicals, while they
reduce performance with others. Code and data are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在生成事实性不足或虚构回答方面存在问题，影响了其可信度和广泛应用。因此，需要一种方法使模型能够准确识别不可回答问题并生成可靠的拒绝响应。

Method: RUL结合了判别性不可回答预测头和LLM的生成核心，采用多阶段学习策略，包括在新型数据集ECA上进行监督微调，以及通过RLHF阶段优化拒绝响应的细微差别和有用性。

Result: 实验表明，RUL在句子、段落和排序级别的不可回答检测中显著提高了准确性，并大幅提升了不可回答查询的拒绝响应生成质量。人类评估也证实了RUL的有效性。

Conclusion: RUL为构建更可靠、以用户为中心的对话AI系统提供了有效途径，显著提升了模型的帮助性和可信度。

Abstract: The pervasive deployment of large language models (LLMs) in conversational AI
systems has revolutionized information access, yet their propensity for
generating factually unsupported or hallucinated responses remains a critical
impediment to trustworthiness and widespread adoption. This paper introduces
Reinforced Unanswerability Learning (RUL), a novel hybrid training paradigm
designed to imbue LLMs with the intrinsic capability to accurately detect
unanswerable questions and generate reliably appropriate responses. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on external classifiers or simple prompting,
RUL integrates a discriminative unanswerability prediction head with the LLM's
generative core, guided by a multi-stage learning strategy. This includes
supervised fine-tuning on a novel, richly annotated dataset,
Enhanced-CAsT-Answerability (ECA), which features hierarchical answerability
labels and ground-truth refusal responses. Crucially, RUL incorporates a
subsequent reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) phase to refine
the nuance, helpfulness, and informativeness of refusal responses. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RUL's superior performance, achieving significantly
higher accuracy in unanswerability detection across sentence, paragraph, and
ranking levels, and substantially increasing the generation of appropriate
refusals for unanswerable queries, alongside strong performance on answerable
questions. Human evaluations further corroborate RUL's effectiveness,
highlighting a marked improvement in perceived helpfulness and trustworthiness,
ultimately paving the way for more reliable and user-centric conversational AI.

that can be associated with general intelligence. This raises an intriguing
question: Do such concepts emerge in models trained on other modalities, such
as speech? Furthermore, when models are trained jointly on multiple modalities:
Do they develop a richer, more structured semantic understanding? To explore
this, we analyze the conceptual structures learned by speech and textual models
both individually and jointly. We employ Latent Concept Analysis, an
unsupervised method for uncovering and interpreting latent representations in
neural networks, to examine how semantic abstractions form across modalities.
For reproducibility we made scripts and other resources available to the
community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于字符级神经架构的日志解析器，能够提取细粒度日志模板，在准确性和效率上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有日志解析器无法捕捉细粒度模板细节，导致下游任务准确性不足。

Method: 使用字符级神经网络架构，聚合字符嵌入，生成二进制编码的十进制序列以提取细粒度模板。

Result: 在Loghub-2k和工业数据集上测试，准确性媲美LLM解析器，效率优于语义解析器。

Conclusion: 字符级日志解析器在低资源条件下实现了高准确性和效率，适用于需要精确模式识别的任务。

Abstract: System-generated logs are typically converted into categorical log templates
through parsing. These templates are crucial for generating actionable insights
in various downstream tasks. However, existing parsers often fail to capture
fine-grained template details, leading to suboptimal accuracy and reduced
utility in downstream tasks requiring precise pattern identification. We
propose a character-level log parser utilizing a novel neural architecture that
aggregates character embeddings. Our approach estimates a sequence of
binary-coded decimals to achieve highly granular log templates extraction. Our
low-resource character-level parser, tested on revised Loghub-2k and a manually
annotated industrial dataset, matches LLM-based parsers in accuracy while
outperforming semantic parsers in efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对芬兰瑞典语（FS）的发音错误检测模型，适用于低资源语言，方法简单且语言无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多数发音错误检测模型针对英语等主要语言，而低资源语言如芬兰瑞典语缺乏相关工具。

Method: 使用多语言wav2vec 2.0模型，结合熵正则化、温度缩放和top-k归一化，适应发音错误检测任务。

Result: 模型在召回率（43.2%）和精确率（29.8%）上取得平衡，优于基线模型（召回率77.5%，精确率17.6%）。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，适用于其他低资源语言，为发音错误检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Mispronunciation detection (MD) models are the cornerstones of many language
learning applications. Unfortunately, most systems are built for English and
other major languages, while low-resourced language varieties, such as Finland
Swedish (FS), lack such tools. In this paper, we introduce our MD model for FS,
trained on 89 hours of first language (L1) speakers' spontaneous speech and
tested on 33 minutes of L2 transcribed read-aloud speech.
  We trained a multilingual wav2vec 2.0 model with entropy regularization,
followed by temperature scaling and top-k normalization after the inference to
better adapt it for MD. The main novelty of our method lies in its simplicity,
requiring minimal L2 data. The process is also language-independent, making it
suitable for other low-resource languages. Our proposed algorithm allows us to
balance Recall (43.2%) and Precision (29.8%), compared with the baseline
model's Recall (77.5%) and Precision (17.6%).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，预训练语言模型的规模与其对人类阅读时间的预测能力呈负相关，且数据泄漏并非主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨预训练语言模型规模与人类阅读时间预测能力的关系，并验证数据泄漏是否为主要影响因素。

Method: 进行两项研究：1) 分析五个自然阅读时间语料库在预训练数据中的泄漏情况；2) 使用无泄漏数据训练模型，验证模型规模与预测能力的关系。

Result: 1) 数据泄漏较少；2) 模型规模与预测能力仍呈负相关。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型规模对人类阅读时间预测能力的负面影响并非由数据泄漏导致。

Abstract: In psycholinguistic modeling, surprisal from larger pre-trained language
models has been shown to be a poorer predictor of naturalistic human reading
times. However, it has been speculated that this may be due to data leakage
that caused language models to see the text stimuli during training. This paper
presents two studies to address this concern at scale. The first study reveals
relatively little leakage of five naturalistic reading time corpora in two
pre-training datasets in terms of length and frequency of token $n$-gram
overlap. The second study replicates the negative relationship between language
model size and the fit of surprisal to reading times using models trained on
'leakage-free' data that overlaps only minimally with the reading time corpora.
Taken together, this suggests that previous results using language models
trained on these corpora are not driven by the effects of data leakage.

TL;DR: 论文提出了LAQuer任务，通过局部化生成文本与源文本的对应关系，提升细粒度和用户导向的归因能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归因方法要么过于笼统（整句归因），要么过于精确但不符合用户需求（子句归因），导致用户验证准确性困难。

Method: 提出LAQuer任务，比较了两种方法（提示大型语言模型和利用其内部表示），并扩展了现有归因文本生成方法。

Result: LAQuer方法显著减少了归因文本的长度，在多文档摘要和长问答任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: LAQuer任务提升了归因的实用性，提出了建模框架和评估设置，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Grounded text generation models often produce content that deviates from
their source material, requiring user verification to ensure accuracy. Existing
attribution methods associate entire sentences with source documents, which can
be overwhelming for users seeking to fact-check specific claims. In contrast,
existing sub-sentence attribution methods may be more precise but fail to align
with users' interests. In light of these limitations, we introduce Localized
Attribution Queries (LAQuer), a new task that localizes selected spans of
generated output to their corresponding source spans, allowing fine-grained and
user-directed attribution. We compare two approaches for the LAQuer task,
including prompting large language models (LLMs) and leveraging LLM internal
representations. We then explore a modeling framework that extends existing
attributed text generation methods to LAQuer. We evaluate this framework across
two grounded text generation tasks: Multi-document Summarization (MDS) and
Long-form Question Answering (LFQA). Our findings show that LAQuer methods
significantly reduce the length of the attributed text. Our contributions
include: (1) proposing the LAQuer task to enhance attribution usability, (2)
suggesting a modeling framework and benchmarking multiple baselines, and (3)
proposing a new evaluation setting to promote future research on localized
attribution in content-grounded generation.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在低资源语言和文化特定任务中的表现不足，以实现更公平的AI应用。

Method: 提出Culturally-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (CG-CoT)，结合文化上下文的密集向量检索与显式推理序列。

Result: 在约鲁巴谚语解释任务中，CG-CoT显著优于传统提示方法，且揭示了BLEU等指标与文化相关性之间的差异。

Conclusion: CG-CoT为低资源NLP任务提供了更有效的解决方案，并呼吁重新思考评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with culturally-specific reasoning
tasks, particularly in low-resource languages, hindering their global
applicability. Addressing this gap is crucial for equitable AI deployment. We
introduce Culturally-Grounded Chain-of-Thought (CG-CoT), a novel prompting
strategy that combines dense vector retrieval of cultural context with explicit
reasoning sequences. Our extensive experiments on Yoruba proverb interpretation
demonstrate that CG-CoT provides significantly higher culturally-aligned
accuracy and depth than traditional prompting methods, validated through both
automated metrics and LLM-based evaluations. Notably, we uncover stark
disparities between token-level translation metrics like BLEU and human-judged
cultural relevance, suggesting a rethinking of evaluation approaches for
low-resource NLP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补对非合作话语系统性理解的空白，特别是在高风险的对抗性环境中。

Method: 引入CoBRA框架和三个可解释指标（BaT、PaT、NRBaT），并利用CHARM数据集评估LLMs的表现。

Result: LLMs在战略语言理解上表现有限，模型规模提升性能，但推理能力反而导致过度复杂和内部混乱。

Conclusion: LLMs在非合作话语中的实用理解仍需改进，推理能力可能成为障碍。

Abstract: Language is often used strategically, particularly in high-stakes,
adversarial settings, yet most work on pragmatics and LLMs centers on
cooperativity. This leaves a gap in systematic understanding of non-cooperative
discourse. To address this, we introduce CoBRA (Cooperation-Breach Response
Assessment), along with three interpretable metrics -- Benefit at Turn (BaT),
Penalty at Turn (PaT), and Normalized Relative Benefit at Turn (NRBaT) -- to
quantify the perceived strategic effects of discourse moves. We also present
CHARM, an annotated dataset of real courtroom cross-examinations, to
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness. Using these tools, we evaluate a
range of LLMs and show that LLMs generally exhibit limited pragmatic
understanding of strategic language. While model size shows an increase in
performance on our metrics, reasoning ability does not help and largely hurts,
introducing overcomplication and internal confusion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的稀疏自编码器架构，显式建模概念的语义层次结构，提升了解释性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏字典学习未利用概念间的语义关系，限制了其解释性和效率。

Method: 引入改进的稀疏自编码器架构，显式建模语义层次结构。

Result: 实验表明该架构能学习语义层次，提升重建效果和解释性，并显著提高计算效率。

Conclusion: 改进的稀疏自编码器架构通过建模语义层次，有效提升了解释性和计算性能。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (and, in particular, sparse autoencoders) attempts
to learn a set of human-understandable concepts that can explain variation on
an abstract space. A basic limitation of this approach is that it neither
exploits nor represents the semantic relationships between the learned
concepts. In this paper, we introduce a modified SAE architecture that
explicitly models a semantic hierarchy of concepts. Application of this
architecture to the internal representations of large language models shows
both that semantic hierarchy can be learned, and that doing so improves both
reconstruction and interpretability. Additionally, the architecture leads to
significant improvements in computational efficiency.

Abstract: Detecting ambiguity is important for language understanding, including
uncertainty estimation, humour detection, and processing garden path sentences.
We assess language models' sensitivity to ambiguity by introducing an
adversarial ambiguity dataset that includes syntactic, lexical, and
phonological ambiguities along with adversarial variations (e.g., word-order
changes, synonym replacements, and random-based alterations). Our findings show
that direct prompting fails to robustly identify ambiguity, while linear probes
trained on model representations can decode ambiguity with high accuracy,
sometimes exceeding 90\%. Our results offer insights into the prompting
paradigm and how language models encode ambiguity at different layers. We
release both our code and data: https://github.com/coastalcph/lm_ambiguity.

TL;DR: 提出基于Mamba的新型drafters，结合外部drafters的灵活性和自推测方法的效率，通过线性结构降低计算复杂度，提升生成速度并减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在灵活性和效率之间存在权衡，外部drafters灵活但速度慢，自推测方法高效但需重新训练。

Method: 利用Mamba（SSM）的线性结构避免二次复杂度，结合测试时树搜索算法生成高质量候选。

Result: Mamba-based drafters在速度和内存效率上优于外部方法，与自推测方法相当且保持跨模型适应性。

Conclusion: Mamba-based drafters是一种高效、灵活且无需重新训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has emerged as a promising approach to accelerating
large language model (LLM) generation using a fast drafter while maintaining
alignment with the target model's distribution. However, existing approaches
face a trade-off: external drafters offer flexibility but can suffer from
slower drafting, while self-speculation methods use drafters tailored to the
target model but require re-training. In this paper, we introduce novel
drafters based on Mamba, a state-of-the-art state space model (SSM), as a
solution that combines the best aspects of both approaches. By leveraging the
linear structure of SSMs, our approach avoids the quadratic complexity inherent
in traditional Transformer-based methods, enabling faster drafting and lower
memory usage while maintaining the flexibility to work across different target
models. We further enhance efficiency with a novel test-time tree search
algorithm for generating high-quality draft candidates. Our empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mamba-based drafters not only outperform existing
external drafting methods but are also comparable to state-of-the-art
self-speculation approaches while using less memory and maintaining their
cross-model adaptability.

TL;DR: REFORM是一种新型推理框架，通过两阶段方法高效处理长上下文，显著提升性能并降低资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的普及，处理超出预训练上下文限制的超长上下文成为关键挑战。现有方法在信息保留或内存资源需求上存在不足。

Method: REFORM采用两阶段方法：1）增量处理输入块并维护压缩KV缓存；2）通过相似性匹配识别关键令牌并选择性重计算KV缓存。

Result: 在1M上下文长度下，REFORM在RULER和BABILong上分别实现50%和27%的性能提升，并在Infinite-Bench和MM-NIAH上表现优异。同时，推理时间减少30%，峰值内存使用降低5%。

Conclusion: REFORM在高效处理长上下文的同时，兼具性能优势和资源效率，适用于多样化任务和领域。

Abstract: As large language models increasingly gain popularity in real-world
applications, processing extremely long contexts, often exceeding the model's
pre-trained context limits, has emerged as a critical challenge. While existing
approaches to efficient long-context processing show promise, recurrent
compression-based methods struggle with information preservation, whereas
random access approaches require substantial memory resources. We introduce
REFORM, a novel inference framework that efficiently handles long contexts
through a two-phase approach. First, it incrementally processes input chunks
while maintaining a compressed KV cache, constructs cross-layer context
embeddings, and utilizes early exit strategy for improved efficiency. Second,
it identifies and gathers essential tokens via similarity matching and
selectively recomputes the KV cache. Compared to baselines, REFORM achieves
over 50% and 27% performance gains on RULER and BABILong respectively at 1M
context length. It also outperforms baselines on Infinite-Bench and MM-NIAH,
demonstrating flexibility across diverse tasks and domains. Additionally,
REFORM reduces inference time by 30% and peak memory usage by 5%, achieving
both efficiency and superior performance.

Result: LLMs在定义性任务上表现良好，但在需要现实经验知识的任务上表现不佳。

Abstract: We introduce the $\underline{Ko}rean \underline{G}rammar
\underline{E}valuation Bench\underline{M}ark (KoGEM)$, designed to assess the
linguistic competence of LLMs and humans in Korean. KoGEM consists of 1.5k
multiple-choice QA pairs covering five main categories and 16 subcategories.
The zero-shot evaluation of 27 LLMs of various sizes and types reveals that
while LLMs perform remarkably well on straightforward tasks requiring primarily
definitional knowledge, they struggle with tasks that demand the integration of
real-world experiential knowledge, such as phonological rules and
pronunciation. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis suggests that incorporating
such experiential knowledge could enhance the linguistic competence of LLMs.
With KoGEM, we not only highlight the limitations of current LLMs in linguistic
competence but also uncover hidden facets of LLMs in linguistic competence,
paving the way for enhancing comprehensive language understanding. Our code and

Conclusion: ExpertLongBench和CLEAR为专家级任务提供了有效评估工具，模型仍需显著改进。

Abstract: This paper introduces ExpertLongBench, an expert-level benchmark containing
11 tasks from 9 domains that reflect realistic expert workflows and
applications. Beyond question answering, the application-driven tasks in
ExpertLongBench demand long-form outputs that can exceed 5,000 tokens and
strict adherence to domain-specific requirements. Notably, each task in
ExpertLongBench includes a rubric, designed or validated by domain experts, to
specify task requirements and guide output evaluation. Furthermore, we propose
CLEAR, an evaluation framework that supports accurate evaluation of long-form
model outputs in our benchmark. To achieve fine-grained, expert-aligned
evaluation, CLEAR derives checklists from both model outputs and references by
extracting information corresponding to items in the task-specific rubric.
Checklist items for model outputs are then compared with corresponding items
for reference outputs to assess their correctness, enabling grounded
evaluation. We benchmark 11 large language models (LLMs) and analyze components
in CLEAR, showing that (1) existing LLMs, with the top performer achieving only
a 26.8% F1 score, require significant improvement for expert-level tasks; (2)
models can generate content corresponding to the required aspects, though often
not accurately; and (3) accurate checklist extraction and comparison in CLEAR
can be achieved by open-weight models for more scalable and low-cost usage.

Result: 初步结果显示，当前大语言模型在基础知识上表现良好，但在临床推理、处方规划和安全性合规方面不足。

Conclusion: MTCMB的推出填补了中医领域评估的空白，为开发更可靠的中医AI系统提供了指导。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is a holistic medical system with
millennia of accumulated clinical experience, playing a vital role in global
healthcare-particularly across East Asia. However, the implicit reasoning,
diverse textual forms, and lack of standardization in TCM pose major challenges
for computational modeling and evaluation. Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable potential in processing natural language across diverse
domains, including general medicine. Yet, their systematic evaluation in the
TCM domain remains underdeveloped. Existing benchmarks either focus narrowly on
factual question answering or lack domain-specific tasks and clinical realism.
To fill this gap, we introduce MTCMB-a Multi-Task Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs
on TCM Knowledge, Reasoning, and Safety. Developed in collaboration with
certified TCM experts, MTCMB comprises 12 sub-datasets spanning five major
categories: knowledge QA, language understanding, diagnostic reasoning,
prescription generation, and safety evaluation. The benchmark integrates
real-world case records, national licensing exams, and classical texts,
providing an authentic and comprehensive testbed for TCM-capable models.
Preliminary results indicate that current LLMs perform well on foundational
knowledge but fall short in clinical reasoning, prescription planning, and
safety compliance. These findings highlight the urgent need for domain-aligned
benchmarks like MTCMB to guide the development of more competent and
trustworthy medical AI systems. All datasets, code, and evaluation tools are

Motivation: 了解潜在条件如何影响事件结果有助于验证复杂事件的主张，但识别和分析这些条件具有挑战性。

Method: 结合并扩展了两个现有数据集（目标和状态）的标注，通过研究问题和条件推理任务探索条件的影响。测试了不同规模和意图对齐度的LLM。

Result: 条件在上下文缺失时有用，不同模型在生成和识别条件的能力上差异显著。GPT-4o等大模型在约束较少时表现更谨慎。

Conclusion: 条件分析有助于验证结果，但模型性能差异显著，大模型在不确定情境下更保守。

Abstract: Knowing which latent conditions lead to a particular outcome is useful for
critically examining claims made about complex event outcomes. Identifying
implied conditions and examining their influence on an outcome is challenging.
We handle this by combining and augmenting annotations from two existing
datasets consisting of goals and states, and explore the influence of
conditions through our research questions and Condition-based Reasoning tasks.
We examine open and closed LLMs of varying sizes and intent-alignment on our
reasoning tasks and find that conditions are useful when not all context is
available. Models differ widely in their ability to generate and identify
outcome-variant conditions which affects their performance on outcome
validation when conditions are used to replace missing context. Larger models
like GPT-4o, are more cautious in such less constrained situations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FastText的哈希分桶机制在大规模工业部署中存在语义漂移和高内存消耗的问题，需要优化。

Method: 通过双数组Trie结构和标记-压缩原则，分四阶段（前缀Trie构建、前缀相似性压缩、后缀相似性压缩、标记-压缩内存重组）实现内存优化。

Result: 在3000万中文词汇数据集上，内存占用从100GB降至30GB，性能几乎无损失。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了工业部署成本，提升了模型可靠性和加载速度。

Abstract: FastText has established itself as a fundamental algorithm for learning word
representations, demonstrating exceptional capability in handling
out-of-vocabulary words through character-level n-gram embeddings. However, its
hash-based bucketing mechanism introduces critical limitations for large-scale
industrial deployment: hash collisions cause semantic drift, and memory
requirements become prohibitively expensive when dealing with real-world
vocabularies containing millions of terms. This paper presents a comprehensive
memory optimization framework that fundamentally reimagines FastText's memory
management through the integration of double-array trie (DA-trie) structures
and mark-compact garbage collection principles. Our approach leverages the
linguistic insight that n-grams sharing common prefixes or suffixes exhibit
highly correlated embeddings due to co-occurrence patterns in natural language.
By systematically identifying and merging semantically similar embeddings based
on structural relationships, we achieve compression ratios of 4:1 to 10:1 while
maintaining near-perfect embedding quality. The algorithm consists of four
sophisticated phases: prefix trie construction with embedding mapping,
prefix-based similarity compression, suffix-based similarity compression, and
mark-compact memory reorganization. Comprehensive experiments on a 30-million
Chinese vocabulary dataset demonstrate memory reduction from over 100GB to
approximately 30GB with negligible performance degradation. Our industrial
deployment results show significant cost reduction, faster loading times, and
improved model reliability through the elimination of hash collision artifacts.

proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude-3 Opus; it excels in structured
problem-solving domains such as mathematics, healthcare diagnostics, code
generation, and pharmaceutical research. The model demonstrates competitive
performance on benchmarks like the United States Medical Licensing Examination
(USMLE) and American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME), with strong
results in pediatric and ophthalmologic clinical decision support tasks. Its

Motivation: 缺乏开源个性化对话数据集阻碍了研究人员开发个性化AI助手，HiCUPID旨在填补这一空白。

Method: HiCUPID提供了一个基于Llama-3.2的自动化评估模型和个性化对话数据集。

Result: HiCUPID的评估模型能有效反映人类偏好，为LLMs个性化能力研究提供支持。

Conclusion: HiCUPID为个性化AI助手研究提供了重要工具，推动了LLMs在该领域的发展。

Abstract: Personalized AI assistants, a hallmark of the human-like capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), are a challenging application that intertwines
multiple problems in LLM research. Despite the growing interest in the
development of personalized assistants, the lack of an open-source
conversational dataset tailored for personalization remains a significant
obstacle for researchers in the field. To address this research gap, we
introduce HiCUPID, a new benchmark to probe and unleash the potential of LLMs
to deliver personalized responses. Alongside a conversational dataset, HiCUPID
provides a Llama-3.2-based automated evaluation model whose assessment closely
mirrors human preferences. We release our dataset, evaluation model, and code

*Yu Nakagome,Michael Hentschel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种改进CTC模型中罕见词识别准确率的方法，无需额外训练或TTS系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端语音识别方法对训练数据词汇的偏见，尤其是专有名词和未知词的识别不准确问题。

Method: 在推理过程中利用中间层的声学特征进行关键词检测，并对声学模型的后续层施加偏置。采用wildcard CTC进行关键词检测，快速且容忍模糊匹配。

Result: 在日语语音识别实验中，未知词的F1分数提高了29%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练现有模型，适用于大规模模型，显著提升了罕见词的识别效果。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in end-to-end speech recognition methods, the output
tends to be biased to the training data's vocabulary, resulting in inaccurate
recognition of proper nouns and other unknown terms. To address this issue, we
propose a method to improve recognition accuracy of such rare words in
CTC-based models without additional training or text-to-speech systems.
Specifically, keyword spotting is performed using acoustic features of
intermediate layers during inference, and a bias is applied to the subsequent
layers of the acoustic model for detected keywords. For keyword detection, we
adopt a wildcard CTC that is both fast and tolerant of ambiguous matches,
allowing flexible handling of words that are difficult to match strictly. Since
this method does not require retraining of existing models, it can be easily
applied to even large-scale models. In experiments on Japanese speech
recognition, the proposed method achieved a 29% improvement in the F1 score for
unknown words.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了上下文学习（ICL）在预训练大语言模型（LLMs）中的局限性，尤其是在长文本生成任务中表现不佳，并提出了一种名为LongGuide的方法，通过生成任务语言和格式的并行指导流来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICL虽然在问答任务中表现良好，但在长文本生成任务（如摘要）中效果有限。作者希望通过明确的任务分布定义和指导流来提升模型性能。

Method: 提出LongGuide方法，生成两种并行指导流：Metric Guidelines（MGs）和Output Constraint Guidelines（OCGs），并通过自动选择最佳组合优化模型。

Result: LongGuide显著提升了开源和闭源LLMs的性能，在零样本和少样本设置中均提高超过5%。

Conclusion: LongGuide具有通用性，能够通过弱模型增强强模型，并与自动提示优化器协同工作。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) is an important yet not fully understood ability of
pre-trained large language models (LLMs). It can greatly enhance task
performance using a few examples, termed demonstrations, without fine-tuning.
Although effective in question answering, ICL often underperforms in long-form
generation tasks such as summarization. Under appropriately realistic
assumptions, we empirically and theoretically show that ICL demonstrations
alone are insufficient to teach LLMs the task language and format distributions
for generation. We argue for explicit exposure to the task distributions and
hypothesize that defining them by prompting enhances model performance. To this
end, we present LongGuide, which efficiently generates two parallel streams of
guidelines capturing task language and format properties: (i) Metric Guidelines
(MGs) that instruct models to optimize self-evaluated metrics; and (ii) Output
Constraint Guidelines (OCGs) that constrain generation at both token and
sentence levels. LongGuide automatically selects the best combination of
guidelines, improving both strong open- and closed-source LLMs by over 5% in
both zero- and few-shot settings. We show that LongGuide is generalizable,
learnable by weak models to enhance strong ones, and integrates synergistically
with automatic prompt optimizers.

TL;DR: 提出一种轻量级LLM去毒方法，通过预训练的校准模型引导生成过程，避免有害内容，同时保持流畅性和上下文理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM去毒方法依赖大规模数据训练或模型参数修改，计算成本高且可能影响模型性能。

Method: 利用紧凑的预训练校准模型，在生成过程中轻量干预，学习无毒嵌入空间。

Result: 实验表明该方法有效降低毒性，同时保持内容表达的合理性。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，适用于多种LLM，无需重复训练。

Abstract: Existing approaches for Large language model (LLM) detoxification generally
rely on training on large-scale non-toxic or human-annotated preference data,
designing prompts to instruct the LLM to generate safe content, or modifying
the model parameters to remove toxic information, which are computationally
expensive, lack robustness, and often compromise LLMs' fluency and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach for
LLM detoxification, which leverages a compact, pre-trained calibration model
that guides the detoxification process of a target LLM via a lightweight
intervention in its generation pipeline. By learning a detoxified embedding
space from non-toxic data, the calibration model effectively steers the LLM
away from generating harmful content. This approach only requires a one-time
training of the calibration model that is able to be seamlessly applied to
multiple LLMs without compromising fluency or contextual understanding.
Experiment results on the benchmark dataset demonstrate that our approach
reduces toxicity while maintaining reasonable content expression.

*Sheng Liang,Yongyue Zhang,Yaxiong Wu,Ruiming Tang,Yong Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SPT的统一自适应文本到结构生成框架，通过将预定义模式视为参数化工具，解决了UIE在模式选择和生成中的适应性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: UIE在预定义模式和即时模式生成之间缺乏适应性，尤其是在模式选择众多时。

Method: SPT框架将预定义模式视为参数化工具，支持模式检索、填充和生成，统一了封闭、开放和按需IE任务。

Result: SPT能自适应处理四种IE任务，模式检索和选择表现稳健，提取性能与LoRA基线相当，且训练参数更少。

Conclusion: SPT是一种高效且适应性强的UIE框架，显著提升了模式选择和生成的灵活性。

Abstract: Universal information extraction (UIE) primarily employs an extractive
generation approach with large language models (LLMs), typically outputting
structured information based on predefined schemas such as JSON or tables. UIE
suffers from a lack of adaptability when selecting between predefined schemas
and on-the-fly schema generation within the in-context learning paradigm,
especially when there are numerous schemas to choose from. In this paper, we
propose a unified adaptive text-to-structure generation framework, called
Schema as Parameterized Tools (SPT), which reimagines the tool-calling
capability of LLMs by treating predefined schemas as parameterized tools for
tool selection and parameter filling. Specifically, our SPT method can be
applied to unify closed, open, and on-demand IE tasks by adopting Schema
Retrieval by fetching the relevant schemas from a predefined pool, Schema
Filling by extracting information and filling slots as with tool parameters, or
Schema Generation by synthesizing new schemas with uncovered cases. Experiments
show that the SPT method can handle four distinct IE tasks adaptively,
delivering robust schema retrieval and selection performance. SPT also achieves
comparable extraction performance to LoRA baselines and current leading UIE
systems with significantly fewer trainable parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语社区的医疗数据分散且难以验证，缺乏标准化方法构建医学基准，影响语言模型在医疗应用中的质量。

Method: 利用可验证的医学考试和临床记录，经专家标注，构建包含四个难度级别的基准。

Result: 发布了包含公开样本集（4k）、完整公开集（10k）和私有集（2k）的基准，支持多语言扩展。

Conclusion: 该基准设计全面，可扩展至其他语言，开源数据构建流程支持未来多语言医学基准的开发。

Abstract: Medical benchmarks are indispensable for evaluating the capabilities of
language models in healthcare for non-English-speaking communities,therefore
help ensuring the quality of real-life applications. However, not every
community has sufficient resources and standardized methods to effectively
build and design such benchmark, and available non-English medical data is
normally fragmented and difficult to verify. We developed an approach to tackle
this problem and applied it to create the first Vietnamese medical question
benchmark, featuring 14,000 multiple-choice questions across 34 medical
specialties. Our benchmark was constructed using various verifiable sources,
including carefully curated medical exams and clinical records, and eventually
annotated by medical experts. The benchmark includes four difficulty levels,
ranging from foundational biological knowledge commonly found in textbooks to
typical clinical case studies that require advanced reasoning. This design
enables assessment of both the breadth and depth of language models' medical
understanding in the target language thanks to its extensive coverage and
in-depth subject-specific expertise. We release the benchmark in three parts: a
sample public set (4k questions), a full public set (10k questions), and a
private set (2k questions) used for leaderboard evaluation. Each set contains
all medical subfields and difficulty levels. Our approach is scalable to other
languages, and we open-source our data construction pipeline to support the
development of future multilingual benchmarks in the medical domain.

Result: 平台成功应用于在线社区数据集，展示了常见担忧的示例、时间序列分析以及重大事件前后话题频率的趋势。

Conclusion: ConcernScope为公共卫生官员提供了一种有效工具，帮助识别和分析在线内容中的健康担忧。

Abstract: A recent rise in online content expressing concerns with public health
initiatives has contributed to already stalled uptake of preemptive measures
globally. Future public health efforts must attempt to understand such content,
what concerns it may raise among readers, and how to effectively respond to it.
To this end, we present ConcernScope, a platform that uses a teacher-student
framework for knowledge transfer between large language models and light-weight
classifiers to quickly and effectively identify the health concerns raised in a
text corpus. The platform allows uploading massive files directly,
automatically scraping specific URLs, and direct text editing. ConcernScope is
built on top of a taxonomy of public health concerns. Intended for public
health officials, we demonstrate several applications of this platform: guided
data exploration to find useful examples of common concerns found in online
community datasets, identification of trends in concerns through an example
time series analysis of 186,000 samples, and finding trends in topic frequency
before and after significant events.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的弱到强情景学习框架，通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和新型蒸馏方法，提升语言模型在规划和问答任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前情景学习方法在可扩展性和集成性上存在局限，尤其是中等规模语言模型（7B参数）表现不佳，而大规模模型（70-405B参数）虽具备高级抽象能力，但缺乏有效利用经验流的机制。

Method: 结合蒙特卡洛树搜索进行结构化经验收集，并采用新型蒸馏方法，保留语言模型固有能力的同时嵌入情景记忆。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多样规划和问答任务中超越现有专有语言模型3.45%，且在深层模型层中任务对齐显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂规划场景中表现出稳定泛化能力，优于基线方法。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) require robust episodic grounding-the capacity to learn
from and apply past experiences-to excel at physical planning tasks. Current
episodic grounding approaches struggle with scalability and integration,
limiting their effectiveness, especially for medium-sized LMs (7B parameters).
While larger LMs (70-405B parameters) possess superior hierarchical
representations and extensive pre-trained knowledge, they encounter a
fundamental scale paradox: despite their advanced abstraction capabilities,
they lack efficient mechanisms to leverage experience streams. We propose a
scalable weak-to-strong episodic learning framework that effectively transfers
episodic behaviors from smaller to larger LMs. This framework integrates Monte
Carlo tree search for structured experience collection with a novel
distillation method, preserving the inherent LM capabilities while embedding
episodic memory. Experiments demonstrate our method surpasses state-of-the-art
proprietary LMs by 3.45% across diverse planning and question-answering tasks.
Layer-wise probing further indicates significant improvements in task
alignment, especially within deeper LM layers, highlighting stable
generalization even for previously unseen scenarios with increased planning
complexity-conditions where baseline methods degrade markedly.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在心理危机评估中的应用，通过PsyCrisisBench基准测试评估了64种LLMs在情绪状态识别、自杀意念检测等任务中的表现，发现LLMs在结构化任务中表现优异，但情绪识别仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理支持热线需求激增，但面临资源不足问题，LLMs可能提供支持，但其在情感敏感场景的能力尚不明确。

Method: 使用PsyCrisisBench（540条标注数据）评估64种LLMs，采用零样本、少样本和微调方法，通过F1分数和Welch's t检验分析性能。

Result: LLMs在自杀意念检测（F1=0.880）和风险评估（F1=0.907）中表现优异，情绪识别较弱（F1=0.709）。微调的小模型（Qwen2.5-1.5B）表现优于大模型。开源模型与闭源模型差距缩小。

Conclusion: LLMs在心理危机评估中潜力巨大，尤其是微调后。情绪识别仍需改进。开源模型和量化技术为实际部署提供了可行性。PsyCrisisBench为模型开发和伦理部署提供了框架。

Abstract: Psychological support hotlines are critical for crisis intervention but face
significant challenges due to rising demand. Large language models (LLMs) could
support crisis assessments, yet their capabilities in emotionally sensitive
contexts remain unclear. We introduce PsyCrisisBench, a benchmark of 540
annotated transcripts from the Hangzhou Psychological Assistance Hotline,
assessing four tasks: mood status recognition, suicidal ideation detection,
suicide plan identification, and risk assessment. We evaluated 64 LLMs across
15 families (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Qwen, DeepSeek) using zero-shot,
few-shot, and fine-tuning paradigms. Performance was measured by F1-score, with
statistical comparisons via Welch's t-tests. LLMs performed strongly on
suicidal ideation detection (F1=0.880), suicide plan identification (F1=0.779),
and risk assessment (F1=0.907), improved with few-shot and fine-tuning. Mood
status recognition was more challenging (max F1=0.709), likely due to lost
vocal cues and ambiguity. A fine-tuned 1.5B-parameter model (Qwen2.5-1.5B)
surpassed larger models on mood and suicidal ideation. Open-source models like
QwQ-32B performed comparably to closed-source on most tasks (p>0.3), though
closed models retained an edge in mood detection (p=0.007). Performance scaled
with size up to a point; quantization (AWQ) reduced GPU memory by 70% with
minimal F1 degradation. LLMs show substantial promise in structured
psychological crisis assessments, especially with fine-tuning. Mood recognition
remains limited due to contextual complexity. The narrowing gap between open-
and closed-source models, combined with efficient quantization, suggests
feasible integration. PsyCrisisBench offers a robust evaluation framework to
guide model development and ethical deployment in mental health.

Result: 在6个数据集上分类准确性提升6%，可解释性评估提升30%。

Conclusion: 动态代理和CoCoBM显著提升了概念瓶颈模型的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) decompose image classification into a
process governed by interpretable, human-readable concepts. Recent advances in
CBMs have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate candidate concepts.
However, a critical question remains: What is the optimal number of concepts to
use? Current concept banks suffer from redundancy or insufficient coverage. To
address this issue, we introduce a dynamic, agent-based approach that adjusts
the concept bank in response to environmental feedback, optimizing the number
of concepts for sufficiency yet concise coverage. Moreover, we propose
Conditional Concept Bottleneck Models (CoCoBMs) to overcome the limitations in
traditional CBMs' concept scoring mechanisms. It enhances the accuracy of
assessing each concept's contribution to classification tasks and feature an
editable matrix that allows LLMs to correct concept scores that conflict with
their internal knowledge. Our evaluations across 6 datasets show that our
method not only improves classification accuracy by 6% but also enhances
interpretability assessments by 30%.

than 422 million native speakers in 27 countries and is deeply rooted in a rich
linguistic and cultural heritage. Developing Arabic LLMs (ALLMs) presents an
unparalleled opportunity to bridge technological gaps and empower communities.
The journey of ALLMs has been both fascinating and complex, evolving from
rudimentary text processing systems to sophisticated AI-driven models. This
article explores the trajectory of ALLMs, from their inception to the present
day, highlighting the efforts to evaluate these models through benchmarks and
public leaderboards. We also discuss the challenges and opportunities that
ALLMs present for the Arab world.

TL;DR: TurnBench是一个新的基准测试，通过多轮、多步的代码破解任务评估语言模型的迭代推理能力，揭示了现有模型在复杂推理任务中的显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试多关注单轮或单步任务，无法反映真实场景中的迭代推理需求，因此设计了TurnBench以填补这一空白。

Method: TurnBench采用交互式代码破解任务，包含经典模式和噩梦模式，要求模型通过多轮猜测和反馈逐步揭示隐藏规则。

Result: 最佳模型在经典模式下准确率为81.5%，噩梦模式下骤降至17.8%，而人类参与者均达到100%，凸显模型在复杂推理上的差距。

Conclusion: TurnBench通过反馈循环和隐藏规则设计，为评估和提升语言模型的多步多轮推理能力提供了严格测试平台。

Abstract: Despite impressive advances in large language models (LLMs), existing
benchmarks often focus on single-turn or single-step tasks, failing to capture
the kind of iterative reasoning required in real-world settings. To address
this limitation, we introduce TurnBench, a novel benchmark that evaluates
multi-turn, multi-step reasoning through an interactive code-breaking task
inspired by a "Turing Machine Board Game." In each episode, a model must
uncover hidden logical or arithmetic rules by making sequential guesses,
receiving structured feedback, and integrating clues across multiple rounds.
This dynamic setup requires models to reason over time, adapt based on past
information, and maintain consistency across steps-capabilities underexplored
in current benchmarks. TurnBench includes two modes: Classic, which tests
standard reasoning, and Nightmare, which introduces increased complexity and
requires robust inferential chains. To support fine-grained analysis, we
provide ground-truth annotations for intermediate reasoning steps. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant gaps: the best model
achieves 81.5% accuracy in Classic mode, but performance drops to 17.8% in
Nightmare mode. In contrast, human participants achieve 100% in both,
underscoring the challenge TurnBench poses to current models. By incorporating
feedback loops and hiding task rules, TurnBench reduces contamination risks and
provides a rigorous testbed for diagnosing and advancing multi-step, multi-turn
reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流程图在关键领域（如物流、医疗、工程）中具有重要作用，但LLM在分析流程图时容易产生视觉幻觉，导致可靠性下降。

Method: 提出FlowPathAgent，一种神经符号代理，通过图推理进行细粒度归因：先分割流程图，转换为符号图，再动态交互生成归因路径。

Result: FlowPathAgent在FlowExplainBench数据集上优于基线方法10-14%，有效减少了LLM的视觉幻觉。

Conclusion: FlowPathAgent通过细粒度归因提高了LLM对流程图分析的可靠性和可解释性，FlowExplainBench为评估提供了新基准。

Abstract: Flowcharts are a critical tool for visualizing decision-making processes.
However, their non-linear structure and complex visual-textual relationships
make it challenging to interpret them using LLMs, as vision-language models
frequently hallucinate nonexistent connections and decision paths when
analyzing these diagrams. This leads to compromised reliability for automated
flowchart processing in critical domains such as logistics, health, and
engineering. We introduce the task of Fine-grained Flowchart Attribution, which
traces specific components grounding a flowchart referring LLM response.
Flowchart Attribution ensures the verifiability of LLM predictions and improves
explainability by linking generated responses to the flowchart's structure. We
propose FlowPathAgent, a neurosymbolic agent that performs fine-grained post
hoc attribution through graph-based reasoning. It first segments the flowchart,
then converts it into a structured symbolic graph, and then employs an agentic
approach to dynamically interact with the graph, to generate attribution paths.
Additionally, we present FlowExplainBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating
flowchart attributions across diverse styles, domains, and question types.
Experimental results show that FlowPathAgent mitigates visual hallucinations in
LLM answers over flowchart QA, outperforming strong baselines by 10-14% on our
proposed FlowExplainBench dataset.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach
for training language models (LMs) on reasoning tasks that elicit emergent long
chains of thought (CoTs). Unlike supervised learning, it updates the model
using both correct and incorrect samples via policy gradients. To better
understand its mechanism, we decompose the learning signal into reinforcing
correct responses and penalizing incorrect ones, referred to as Positive and
Negative Sample Reinforcement (PSR and NSR), respectively. We train
Qwen2.5-Math-7B and Qwen3-4B on a mathematical reasoning dataset and uncover a
surprising result: training with only negative samples -- without reinforcing
correct responses -- can be highly effective: it consistently improves
performance over the base model across the entire Pass@$k$ spectrum ($k$ up to
$256$), often matching or surpassing PPO and GRPO. In contrast, reinforcing
only correct responses improves Pass@$1$ but degrades performance at higher
$k$, due to reduced diversity. These inference-scaling trends highlight that
solely penalizing incorrect responses may contribute more to performance than
previously recognized. Through gradient analysis, we show that NSR works by
suppressing incorrect generations and redistributing probability mass toward
other plausible candidates, guided by the model's prior beliefs. It refines the
model's existing knowledge rather than introducing entirely new behaviors.
Building on this insight, we propose a simple variant of the RL objective that
upweights NSR, and show that it consistently improves overall Pass@$k$
performance on MATH, AIME 2025, and AMC23. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有心理咨询对话数据集存在多样性不足、真实性差及隐私问题，需一种既能保证质量又能规避隐私风险的数据收集方法。

Method: 采用角色扮演方法，由训练有素的咨询师模拟咨询对话，构建包含6,589条长对话的KokoroChat数据集，并附有详细客户反馈。

Result: 实验表明，使用KokoroChat微调开源大语言模型能显著提升生成咨询回复的质量和自动评估效果。

Conclusion: 角色扮演方法有效解决了心理咨询数据集的多样性和隐私问题，KokoroChat为相关研究提供了高质量资源。

Abstract: Generating psychological counseling responses with language models relies
heavily on high-quality datasets. Crowdsourced data collection methods require
strict worker training, and data from real-world counseling environments may
raise privacy and ethical concerns. While recent studies have explored using
large language models (LLMs) to augment psychological counseling dialogue
datasets, the resulting data often suffers from limited diversity and
authenticity. To address these limitations, this study adopts a role-playing
approach where trained counselors simulate counselor-client interactions,
ensuring high-quality dialogues while mitigating privacy risks. Using this
method, we construct KokoroChat, a Japanese psychological counseling dialogue
dataset comprising 6,589 long-form dialogues, each accompanied by comprehensive
client feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuning open-source
LLMs with KokoroChat improves both the quality of generated counseling
responses and the automatic evaluation of counseling dialogues. The KokoroChat
dataset is available at https://github.com/UEC-InabaLab/KokoroChat.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最大均值差异（MMD）的新方法MMD-Flagger，用于检测大语言模型生成的幻觉内容，并在机器翻译数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型生成的幻觉内容（不基于现实的内容）阻碍了其在关键应用中的使用，因此需要有效的检测方法。

Method: 利用MMD（非参数分布距离）跟踪生成文档与不同温度参数下生成文档的差异，通过分析差异轨迹检测幻觉内容。

Result: 在机器翻译数据集上，MMD-Flagger优于其他自然竞争方法。

Conclusion: MMD-Flagger是一种有效的幻觉内容检测方法，适用于大语言模型生成内容的可靠性验证。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become pervasive in our everyday life. Yet,
a fundamental obstacle prevents their use in many critical applications: their
propensity to generate fluent, human-quality content that is not grounded in
reality. The detection of such hallucinations is thus of the highest
importance. In this work, we propose a new method to flag hallucinated content,
MMD-Flagger. It relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD), a non-parametric
distance between distributions. On a high-level perspective, MMD-Flagger tracks
the MMD between the generated documents and documents generated with various
temperature parameters. We show empirically that inspecting the shape of this
trajectory is sufficient to detect most hallucinations. This novel method is
benchmarked on two machine translation datasets, on which it outperforms
natural competitors.

Motivation: 现有方法在训练时和测试时均未能充分发挥提示式对话查询重写的潜力。

Method: 提出AdaRewriter框架，利用对比排序损失训练奖励模型，在推理时选择最优重写。

Result: 在五个对话搜索数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 测试时适应在对话查询重写中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Prompting-based conversational query reformulation has emerged as a powerful
approach for conversational search, refining ambiguous user queries into
standalone search queries. Best-of-N reformulation over the generated
candidates via prompting shows impressive potential scaling capability.
However, both the previous tuning methods (training time) and adaptation
approaches (test time) can not fully unleash their benefits. In this paper, we
propose AdaRewriter, a novel framework for query reformulation using an
outcome-supervised reward model via test-time adaptation. By training a
lightweight reward model with contrastive ranking loss, AdaRewriter selects the
most promising reformulation during inference. Notably, it can operate
effectively in black-box systems, including commercial LLM APIs. Experiments on
five conversational search datasets show that AdaRewriter significantly
outperforms the existing methods across most settings, demonstrating the
potential of test-time adaptation for conversational query reformulation.

our data. We evaluated over 60 pipelines and determined the best one for each
direction. We also found that the ranks of components are generally independent

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLM）在敏感领域应用中隐私泄露风险及依赖外部模型的高成本问题。

Method: 利用LLM匿名器与推理模型的对抗交互收集数据，通过监督微调和偏好学习将能力蒸馏到SLM中。

Result: 8B参数的SLM在隐私-效用权衡上媲美GPT-4，并通过自优化在隐私性上超越。

Conclusion: SEAL框架证明SLM可作为高效匿名化工具，并公开实验数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in sensitive domains,
where their ability to infer personal data from seemingly benign text poses
emerging privacy risks. While recent LLM-based anonymization methods help
mitigate such risks, they often rely on proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4),
raising concerns about cost and the potential exposure of sensitive data to
untrusted external systems. To address this, we introduce SElf-refining
Anonymization with Language model (SEAL), a novel distillation framework for
training small language models (SLMs) to perform effective anonymization
without relying on external costly models at inference time. We leverage
adversarial interactions between an LLM anonymizer and an inference model to
collect trajectories of anonymized texts and inferred attributes, which are
used to distill anonymization, adversarial inference, and utility evaluation
capabilities into SLMs via supervised fine-tuning and preference learning. The
resulting models learn to both anonymize text and critique their outputs,
enabling iterative improvement of anonymization quality via self-refinement.
Experiments on SynthPAI, a dataset of synthetic personal profiles and text
comments, demonstrate that SLMs trained with SEAL achieve substantial
improvements in anonymization capabilities. Notably, 8B models attain a
privacy-utility trade-off comparable to that of the GPT-4 anonymizer and, with
self-refinement, even surpass it in terms of privacy. These results show the
effectiveness of our adversarial distillation framework in training SLMs as
efficient anonymizers. To facilitate further research, we release the full
dataset used in our experiments.

Result: 降维至原始维度的25%时性能下降很小，分类和聚类任务在降维至0.5%时性能仍稳定。

Conclusion: 分类和聚类任务的嵌入具有高维冗余，其内在维度低且各向异性较低。

Abstract: Prompt-based text embedding models, which generate task-specific embeddings
upon receiving tailored prompts, have recently demonstrated remarkable
performance. However, their resulting embeddings often have thousands of
dimensions, leading to high storage costs and increased computational costs of
embedding-based operations. In this paper, we investigate how post-hoc
dimensionality reduction applied to the embeddings affects the performance of
various tasks that leverage these embeddings, specifically classification,
clustering, retrieval, and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks. Our
experiments show that even a naive dimensionality reduction, which keeps only
the first 25% of the dimensions of the embeddings, results in a very slight
performance degradation, indicating that these embeddings are highly redundant.
Notably, for classification and clustering, even when embeddings are reduced to
less than 0.5% of the original dimensionality the performance degradation is
very small. To quantitatively analyze this redundancy, we perform an analysis
based on the intrinsic dimensionality and isotropy of the embeddings. Our
analysis reveals that embeddings for classification and clustering, which are
considered to have very high dimensional redundancy, exhibit lower intrinsic
dimensionality and less isotropy compared with those for retrieval and STS.

Abstract: Extracting useful signals or pattern to support important business decisions
for example analyzing investment product traction and discovering customer
preference, risk monitoring etc. from unstructured text is a challenging task.
Capturing interaction of entities or concepts and association mining is a
crucial component in text mining, enabling information extraction and reasoning
over and knowledge discovery from text. Furthermore, it can be used to enrich
or filter knowledge graphs to guide exploration processes, descriptive
analytics and uncover hidden stories in the text. In this paper, we introduce a
domain independent pipeline i.e., generalized framework to enable document
filtering, entity extraction using various sources (or techniques) as plug-ins
and association mining to build any text mining business use-case and
quantitatively define a scoring metric for ranking purpose. The proposed
framework has three major components a) Document filtering: filtering
documents/text of interest from massive amount of texts b) Configurable entity
extraction pipeline: include entity extraction techniques i.e., i) DBpedia
Spotlight, ii) Spacy NER, iii) Custom Entity Matcher, iv) Phrase extraction (or
dictionary) based c) Association Relationship Mining: To generates
co-occurrence graph to analyse potential relationships among entities,
concepts. Further, co-occurrence count based frequency statistics provide a
holistic window to observe association trends or buzz rate in specific business
context. The paper demonstrates the usage of framework as fundamental building
box in two financial use-cases namely brand product discovery and vendor risk
monitoring. We aim that such framework will remove duplicated effort, minimize
the development effort, and encourage reusability and rapid prototyping in
association mining business applications for institutions.

Abstract: Computational models of pragmatic language use have traditionally relied on
hand-specified sets of utterances and meanings, limiting their applicability to
real-world language use. We propose a neuro-symbolic framework that enhances
probabilistic cognitive models by integrating LLM-based modules to propose and
evaluate key components in natural language, eliminating the need for manual
specification. Through a classic case study of pragmatic question-answering, we
systematically examine various approaches to incorporating neural modules into
the cognitive model -- from evaluating utilities and literal semantics to
generating alternative utterances and goals. We find that hybrid models can
match or exceed the performance of traditional probabilistic models in
predicting human answer patterns. However, the success of the neuro-symbolic
model depends critically on how LLMs are integrated: while they are
particularly effective for proposing alternatives and transforming abstract
goals into utilities, they face challenges with truth-conditional semantic
evaluation. This work charts a path toward more flexible and scalable models of
pragmatic language use while illuminating crucial design considerations for
balancing neural and symbolic components.

Abstract: Detoxification, the task of rewriting harmful language into non-toxic text,
has become increasingly important amid the growing prevalence of toxic content
online. However, high-quality parallel datasets for detoxification, especially
for hate speech, remain scarce due to the cost and sensitivity of human
annotation. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-in-the-loop pipeline
leveraging GPT-4o-mini for automated detoxification. We first replicate the
ParaDetox pipeline by replacing human annotators with an LLM and show that the
LLM performs comparably to human annotation. Building on this, we construct
PARADEHATE, a large-scale parallel dataset specifically for hatespeech
detoxification. We release PARADEHATE as a benchmark of over 8K hate/non-hate
text pairs and evaluate a wide range of baseline methods. Experimental results
show that models such as BART, fine-tuned on PARADEHATE, achieve better
performance in style accuracy, content preservation, and fluency, demonstrating
the effectiveness of LLM-generated detoxification text as a scalable
alternative to human annotation.

Conclusion: ACCI方法在统一端到端框架中有效消除偏差，无需数据增强或启发式过滤，显著提升了跨文档事件共指消解的性能。

Abstract: Cross-document Event Coreference Resolution (CD-ECR) is a fundamental task in
natural language processing (NLP) that seeks to determine whether event
mentions across multiple documents refer to the same real-world occurrence.
However, current CD-ECR approaches predominantly rely on trigger features
within input mention pairs, which induce spurious correlations between
surface-level lexical features and coreference relationships, impairing the
overall performance of the models. To address this issue, we propose a novel
cross-document event coreference resolution method based on Argument-Centric
Causal Intervention (ACCI). Specifically, we construct a structural causal
graph to uncover confounding dependencies between lexical triggers and
coreference labels, and introduce backdoor-adjusted interventions to isolate
the true causal effect of argument semantics. To further mitigate spurious
correlations, ACCI integrates a counterfactual reasoning module that quantifies
the causal influence of trigger word perturbations, and an argument-aware
enhancement module to promote greater sensitivity to semantically grounded
information. In contrast to prior methods that depend on costly data
augmentation or heuristic-based filtering, ACCI enables effective debiasing in
a unified end-to-end framework without altering the underlying training
procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACCI achieves CoNLL F1 of
88.4% on ECB+ and 85.2% on GVC, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The
implementation and materials are available at https://github.com/era211/ACCI.

multilingual language models can perform on-pair with English but cannot
leverage potential cross-lingual synergies, with LLMs generally offering better
performance overall. A comprehensive human evaluation of the LLM-generated
definition highlights the zero and few-shot capabilities of these models in
this new task, also showing their shortcomings. Finally, we show that
performance on our task via BERTScore strongly correlates to the performance on
multilingual LLM benchmarks, suggesting that our task offers a viable
compute-constrained, stable and natural alternative to these.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于中国核心价值观的分层价值框架，构建了中国价值观语料库（CVC），并通过实验验证其在价值边界和多样性上的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）的价值评估和对齐受限于西方文化偏见和不完善的国内框架，且缺乏可扩展的规则驱动场景生成方法。

Method: 提出分层价值框架，构建包含25万条价值规则的CVC语料库，并通过人工标注增强。

Result: CVC生成的场景在价值边界和多样性上优于直接生成场景，主流LLMs在70.5%的情况下偏好CVC选项，中国人类标注者与CVC的契合度为87.5%。

Conclusion: 研究建立了一个文化适应性强的价值评估和对齐基准框架，体现了中国特色。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) align with mainstream human values
and ethical norms is crucial for the safe and sustainable development of AI.
Current value evaluation and alignment are constrained by Western cultural bias
and incomplete domestic frameworks reliant on non-native rules; furthermore,
the lack of scalable, rule-driven scenario generation methods makes evaluations
costly and inadequate across diverse cultural contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a hierarchical value framework grounded in core Chinese
values, encompassing three main dimensions, 12 core values, and 50 derived
values. Based on this framework, we construct a large-scale Chinese Values
Corpus (CVC) containing over 250,000 value rules enhanced and expanded through
human annotation. Experimental results show that CVC-guided scenarios
outperform direct generation ones in value boundaries and content diversity. In
the evaluation across six sensitive themes (e.g., surrogacy, suicide), seven
mainstream LLMs preferred CVC-generated options in over 70.5% of cases, while
five Chinese human annotators showed an 87.5% alignment with CVC, confirming
its universality, cultural relevance, and strong alignment with Chinese values.
Additionally, we construct 400,000 rule-based moral dilemma scenarios that
objectively capture nuanced distinctions in conflicting value prioritization
across 17 LLMs. Our work establishes a culturally-adaptive benchmarking
framework for comprehensive value evaluation and alignment, representing
Chinese characteristics. All data are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Whisper模型的连续语音学习方法，通过动态选择任务特征提升适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态方法无法适应动态多样的语音数据，需要更灵活的模型。

Method: 在Whisper模型编码器顶部加入可学习的门控融合层，动态选择任务特征。

Result: 在六项语音任务中显著提升准确率，无需完全重新训练即可适应新任务。

Conclusion: 连续语音学习方法有效解决了语音模型适应性问题，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: Rapid growth in speech data demands adaptive models, as traditional static
methods fail to keep pace with dynamic and diverse speech information. We
introduce continuous speech learning, a new set-up targeting at bridging the
adaptation gap in current speech models. We use the encoder-decoder Whisper
model to standardize speech tasks into a generative format. We integrate a
learnable gated-fusion layer on the top of the encoder to dynamically select
task-specific features for downstream tasks. Our approach improves accuracy
significantly over traditional methods in six speech processing tasks,
demonstrating gains in adapting to new speech tasks without full retraining.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在不确定环境中生成基于事实和信心的表达的能力不足，提出通过丰富LLMs的语义知识来提升其不确定性表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在生成基于证据强度的表达方面存在挑战，尤其是在不确定环境中。研究旨在评估LLMs对认知模态的语义知识，以提升其不确定性表达的可靠性。

Method: 利用类型学框架和受控故事评估LLMs对认知模态的知识，分析其生成认知表达的能力。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs生成认知表达的能力有限且不稳定，其不确定性表达不可靠。

Conclusion: 为构建具有不确定性意识的LLMs，需丰富其对认知模态的语义知识。

Abstract: Rational speakers are supposed to know what they know and what they do not
know, and to generate expressions matching the strength of evidence. In
contrast, it is still a challenge for current large language models to generate
corresponding utterances based on the assessment of facts and confidence in an
uncertain real-world environment. While it has recently become popular to
estimate and calibrate confidence of LLMs with verbalized uncertainty, what is
lacking is a careful examination of the linguistic knowledge of uncertainty
encoded in the latent space of LLMs. In this paper, we draw on typological
frameworks of epistemic expressions to evaluate LLMs' knowledge of epistemic
modality, using controlled stories. Our experiments show that the performance
of LLMs in generating epistemic expressions is limited and not robust, and
hence the expressions of uncertainty generated by LLMs are not always reliable.
To build uncertainty-aware LLMs, it is necessary to enrich semantic knowledge
of epistemic modality in LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出FormFactory，一个用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在表单填写任务中表现的交互式基准套件，发现当前模型的准确率不足5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线表单填写是一项常见但劳动密集型任务，现有工具缺乏通用性和生成能力，亟需解决其独特挑战（如灵活布局和文本指令与字段对齐）。

Method: 提出FormFactory，包含基于Web的界面、后端评估模块和精心构建的数据集，覆盖多样化的真实场景和字段格式。

Result: 评估显示当前MLLMs的准确率均低于5%，揭示了模型在视觉布局推理和字段值对齐能力上的显著局限性。

Conclusion: FormFactory为未来研究提供了基础，有望推动更鲁棒、实用的表单填写代理的发展。

Abstract: Online form filling is a common yet labor-intensive task involving extensive
keyboard and mouse interactions. Despite the long-standing vision of automating
this process with "one click", existing tools remain largely rule-based and
lack generalizable, generative capabilities. Recent advances in Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled promising agents for GUI-related
tasks in general-purpose scenarios. However, they struggle with the unique
challenges of form filling, such as flexible layouts and the difficulty of
aligning textual instructions with on-screen fields. To bridge this gap, we
formally define the form-filling task and propose FormFactory, an interactive
benchmarking suite comprising a web-based interface, backend evaluation module,
and carefully constructed dataset. Our benchmark covers diverse real-world
scenarios, incorporates various field formats, and simulates high-fidelity form
interactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs
and observe that no model surpasses 5% accuracy, underscoring the inherent
difficulty of the task. These findings also reveal significant limitations in
current models' visual layout reasoning and field-value alignment abilities. We
hope our benchmark can serve as a stepping stone for further research into
robust, practical form-filling agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于变分自编码器（V-VAE）的框架，用于生成更符合人物特质的对话响应，并构建了高质量数据集HumanChatData和基准测试HumanChatBench。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于角色扮演和人物特质的对话方法依赖静态描述和低质量合成数据，难以捕捉动态细节。

Method: 提出V-VAE框架，包含变分自编码模块和细粒度控制空间，动态调整对话行为。

Result: 实验表明，基于V-VAE的LLM在HumanChatBench和DialogBench上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: V-VAE和HumanChatData有效提升了对话生成的质量和人物一致性。

Abstract: With the continued proliferation of Large Language Model (LLM) based
chatbots, there is a growing demand for generating responses that are not only
linguistically fluent but also consistently aligned with persona-specific
traits in conversations. However, existing role-play and persona-based chat
approaches rely heavily on static role descriptions, coarse-grained signal
space, and low-quality synthetic data, which fail to capture dynamic
fine-grained details in human-like chat. Human-like chat requires modeling
subtle latent traits, such as emotional tone, situational awareness, and
evolving personality, which are difficult to predefine and cannot be easily
learned from synthetic or distillation-based data. To address these
limitations, we propose a Verbal Variational Auto-Encoding (V-VAE) framework,
containing a variational auto-encoding module and fine-grained control space
which dynamically adapts dialogue behaviour based on fine-grained,
interpretable latent variables across talking style, interaction patterns, and
personal attributes. We also construct a high-quality dataset, HumanChatData,
and benchmark HumanChatBench to address the scarcity of high-quality data in
the human-like domain. Experiments show that LLMs based on V-VAE consistently
outperform standard baselines on HumanChatBench and DialogBench, which further
demonstrates the effectiveness of V-VAE and HumanChatData.

Motivation: 现有数学数据集存在内容过时、缺乏挑战性、忽视人类推理和可靠性不足的问题，STORM-BORN旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用人类参与的多代理数据生成框架，结合推理密集过滤、多代理协作和人类数学家的评估。

Result: GPT-o1解决率低于5%，微调后LLaMA3-8B和Qwen2.5-7B准确率分别提升7.84%和9.12%。

Conclusion: STORM-BORN为AI提供了高难度基准和人类推理训练资源，推动数学推理能力的发展。

Abstract: High-quality math datasets are crucial for advancing the reasoning abilities
of large language models (LLMs). However, existing datasets often suffer from
three key issues: outdated and insufficient challenging content, neglecting
human-like reasoning, and limited reliability due to single-LLM generation. To
address these, we introduce $\textbf{STORM-BORN}$, an ultra-challenging dataset
of mathematical derivations sourced from cutting-edge academic papers, which
includes dense human-like approximations and heuristic cues. To ensure the
reliability and quality, we propose a novel human-in-the-loop, multi-agent data
generation framework, integrating reasoning-dense filters, multi-agent
collaboration, and human mathematicians' evaluations. We curated a set of 2,000
synthetic samples and deliberately selected the 100 most difficult problems.
Even most advanced models like GPT-o1 solved fewer than $5\%$ of them.
Fine-tuning on STORM-BORN boosts accuracy by $7.84\%$ (LLaMA3-8B) and $9.12\%$
(Qwen2.5-7B). As AI approaches mathematician-level reasoning, STORM-BORN
provides both a high-difficulty benchmark and a human-like reasoning training
resource. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在低资源语言上表现不佳，双语词典资源丰富但未被充分利用。

Method: 利用BPE分词器的特性，通过逐步移除目标子词并估计其嵌入，实现词汇迁移。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在低资源语言上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于词典的方法在跨语言词汇迁移中简单有效。

Abstract: Cross-lingual vocabulary transfer plays a promising role in adapting
pre-trained language models to new languages, including low-resource languages.
Existing approaches that utilize monolingual or parallel corpora face
challenges when applied to languages with limited resources. In this work, we
propose a simple yet effective vocabulary transfer method that utilizes
bilingual dictionaries, which are available for many languages, thanks to
descriptive linguists. Our proposed method leverages a property of BPE
tokenizers where removing a subword from the vocabulary causes a fallback to
shorter subwords. The embeddings of target subwords are estimated iteratively
by progressively removing them from the tokenizer. The experimental results
show that our approach outperforms existing methods for low-resource languages,
demonstrating the effectiveness of a dictionary-based approach for
cross-lingual vocabulary transfer.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Hanfu-Bench数据集，用于研究视觉语言模型在文化理解中的时间维度，包括文化视觉理解和图像转创任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文化理解研究多关注地理多样性，忽视了时间维度，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过专家策划的Hanfu-Bench数据集，设计文化视觉理解和图像转创任务，评估模型表现。

Result: 封闭式视觉语言模型在文化视觉理解上接近非专家水平，但落后专家10%；开放式模型表现更差。图像转创任务中，最佳模型成功率仅42%。

Conclusion: Hanfu-Bench揭示了时间文化理解和创意适应中的重大挑战，为未来研究提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Culture is a rich and dynamic domain that evolves across both geography and
time. However, existing studies on cultural understanding with vision-language
models (VLMs) primarily emphasize geographic diversity, often overlooking the
critical temporal dimensions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Hanfu-Bench, a
novel, expert-curated multimodal dataset. Hanfu, a traditional garment spanning
ancient Chinese dynasties, serves as a representative cultural heritage that
reflects the profound temporal aspects of Chinese culture while remaining
highly popular in Chinese contemporary society. Hanfu-Bench comprises two core
tasks: cultural visual understanding and cultural image transcreation.The
former task examines temporal-cultural feature recognition based on single- or
multi-image inputs through multiple-choice visual question answering, while the
latter focuses on transforming traditional attire into modern designs through
cultural element inheritance and modern context adaptation. Our evaluation
shows that closed VLMs perform comparably to non-experts on visual cutural
understanding but fall short by 10\% to human experts, while open VLMs lags
further behind non-experts. For the transcreation task, multi-faceted human
evaluation indicates that the best-performing model achieves a success rate of
only 42\%. Our benchmark provides an essential testbed, revealing significant
challenges in this new direction of temporal cultural understanding and
creative adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨提示工程是否足以提升复杂领域（如预测）中大型语言模型的性能。

Method: 测试了38种提示策略，包括复合提示和外部来源提示，并引入推理模型o1和o1-mini。

Result: 大多数提示改进效果微乎其微，部分策略（如鼓励贝叶斯推理）甚至显著降低准确性。

Conclusion: 提示工程在复杂任务中效果有限，可能需要更强大或专业的技术来显著提升AI预测性能。

Abstract: Large language model performance can be improved in a large number of ways.
Many such techniques, like fine-tuning or advanced tool usage, are
time-intensive and expensive. Although prompt engineering is significantly
cheaper and often works for simpler tasks, it remains unclear whether prompt
engineering suffices for more complex domains like forecasting. Here we show
that small prompt modifications rarely boost forecasting accuracy beyond a
minimal baseline. In our first study, we tested 38 prompts across Claude 3.5
Sonnet, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.1 405B. In our second, we
introduced compound prompts and prompts from external sources, also including
the reasoning models o1 and o1-mini. Our results show that most prompts lead to
negligible gains, although references to base rates yield slight benefits.
Surprisingly, some strategies showed strong negative effects on accuracy:
especially encouraging the model to engage in Bayesian reasoning. These results
suggest that, in the context of complex tasks like forecasting, basic prompt
refinements alone offer limited gains, implying that more robust or specialized
techniques may be required for substantial performance improvements in AI
forecasting.

Method: 开发了首个公开的乌尔都语假新闻数据集，并评估了多种预训练语言模型（如XLNet、mBERT等），提出了一种统一的LLM模型。

Result: 提出的统一模型在准确性、F1分数等指标上优于其他模型，并通过人工验证样本结果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发可靠数据集的重要性，并展示了统一模型在乌尔都语假新闻检测中的优越性。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of social media platforms has significantly increased the
dissemination of forged content and misinformation, making the detection of
fake news a critical area of research. Although fact-checking efforts
predominantly focus on English-language news, there is a noticeable gap in
resources and strategies to detect news in regional languages, such as Urdu.
Advanced Fake News Detection (FND) techniques rely heavily on large, accurately
labeled datasets. However, FND in under-resourced languages like Urdu faces
substantial challenges due to the scarcity of extensive corpora and the lack of
validated lexical resources. Current Urdu fake news datasets are often
domain-specific and inaccessible to the public. They also lack human
verification, relying mainly on unverified English-to-Urdu translations, which
compromises their reliability in practical applications. This study highlights
the necessity of developing reliable, expert-verified, and domain-independent
Urdu-enhanced FND datasets to improve fake news detection in Urdu and other
resource-constrained languages. This paper presents the first benchmark large
FND dataset for Urdu news, which is publicly available for validation and deep
analysis. We also evaluate this dataset using multiple state-of-the-art
pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as XLNet, mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa,
RoBERTa, DistilBERT, and DeBERTa. Additionally, we propose a unified LLM model
that outperforms the others with different embedding and feature extraction
techniques. The performance of these models is compared based on accuracy, F1
score, precision, recall, and human judgment for vetting the sample results of
news.

Conclusion: 编码器模型通过Statement Tuning可实现高效的多语言零样本泛化，为资源受限的NLP任务提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in zero-shot and few-shot tasks, but
achieving similar performance with encoder-only models like BERT and RoBERTa
has been challenging due to their architecture. However, encoders offer
advantages such as lower computational and memory costs. Recent work adapts
them for zero-shot generalization using Statement Tuning, which reformulates
tasks into finite templates. We extend this approach to multilingual NLP,
exploring whether encoders can achieve zero-shot cross-lingual generalization
and serve as efficient alternatives to memory-intensive LLMs for low-resource
languages. Our results show that state-of-the-art encoder models generalize
well across languages, rivaling multilingual LLMs while being more efficient.
We also analyze multilingual Statement Tuning dataset design, efficiency gains,
and language-specific generalization, contributing to more inclusive and
resource-efficient NLP models. We release our code and models.

Motivation: 印度语言缺乏高质量的RAG系统资源，包括评估基准和训练数据，阻碍了多语言RAG的发展。

Method: 通过手动翻译MS MARCO-dev集的1000个查询创建IndicMSMarco基准，并利用LLMs从19种印度语言维基百科构建训练数据集。

Result: 开发了IndicMSMarco基准和大规模训练数据集，支持13种印度语言的评估和训练。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了印度语言RAG资源的空白，为多语言信息检索和生成任务提供了支持。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enable language models to access
relevant information and generate accurate, well-grounded, and contextually
informed responses. However, for Indian languages, the development of
high-quality RAG systems is hindered by the lack of two critical resources: (1)
evaluation benchmarks for retrieval and generation tasks, and (2) large-scale
training datasets for multilingual retrieval. Most existing benchmarks and
datasets are centered around English or high-resource languages, making it
difficult to extend RAG capabilities to the diverse linguistic landscape of
India. To address the lack of evaluation benchmarks, we create IndicMSMarco, a
multilingual benchmark for evaluating retrieval quality and response generation
in 13 Indian languages, created via manual translation of 1000 diverse queries
from MS MARCO-dev set. To address the need for training data, we build a
large-scale dataset of (question, answer, relevant passage) tuples derived from
the Wikipedias of 19 Indian languages using state-of-the-art LLMs.
Additionally, we include translated versions of the original MS MARCO dataset
to further enrich the training data and ensure alignment with real-world
information-seeking tasks. Resources are available here:

Result: 在情感分析、情绪识别和问答三个任务上的实验证明了该模型的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的词嵌入增强模型显著提升了分类性能，相关代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models such as BERT have been proved to be powerful in
many natural language processing tasks. But in some text classification
applications such as emotion recognition and sentiment analysis, BERT may not
lead to satisfactory performance. This often happens in applications where
keywords play critical roles in the prediction of class labels. Our
investigation found that the root cause of the problem is that the
context-based BERT embedding of the keywords may not be discriminative enough
to produce discriminative text representation for classification. Motivated by
this finding, we develop a method to enhance word embeddings using
domain-specific lexical knowledge. The knowledge-based embedding enhancement
model projects the BERT embedding into a new space where within-class
similarity and between-class difference are maximized. To implement the
knowledge-based word embedding enhancement model, we also develop a knowledge
acquisition algorithm for automatically collecting lexical knowledge from
online open sources. Experiment results on three classification tasks,
including sentiment analysis, emotion recognition and question answering, have
shown the effectiveness of our proposed word embedding enhancing model. The

Motivation: 解决现有虚假新闻检测方法依赖长文本内容（如新闻文章和用户评论）的局限性，适应更现实的社交媒体场景。

Method: 开发了MVAN模型，结合文本语义注意力和传播结构注意力，捕捉源推文内容和传播结构的信息。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，MVAN在准确率上平均优于现有方法2.5%，并能提供合理的解释。

Conclusion: MVAN在虚假新闻检测任务中表现出色，尤其在短文本和传播结构分析方面具有优势。

Abstract: Fake news on social media is a widespread and serious problem in today's
society. Existing fake news detection methods focus on finding clues from Long
text content, such as original news articles and user comments. This paper
solves the problem of fake news detection in more realistic scenarios. Only
source shot-text tweet and its retweet users are provided without user
comments. We develop a novel neural network based model,
\textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{A}ttention \textbf{N}etworks (MVAN) to
detect fake news and provide explanations on social media. The MVAN model
includes text semantic attention and propagation structure attention, which
ensures that our model can capture information and clues both of source tweet
content and propagation structure. In addition, the two attention mechanisms in
the model can find key clue words in fake news texts and suspicious users in
the propagation structure. We conduct experiments on two real-world datasets,
and the results demonstrate that MVAN can significantly outperform
state-of-the-art methods by 2.5\% in accuracy on average, and produce a
reasonable explanation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言模型如何在无显式跨语言监督下实现知识迁移，探索其表示演化和神经元功能。

Method: 分析三种MLLMs的参数空间，观察预训练中表示的演变，并通过探测实验研究神经元功能。

Result: 模型初始形成语言特定表示，随后逐渐收敛为跨语言抽象；神经元逐渐对齐跨语言语义概念，部分神经元成为跨语言概念的可靠预测器。

Conclusion: 多语言模型通过压缩和神经元对齐实现跨语言知识迁移，为理解其内部机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Multilingual language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities
to transfer knowledge across languages, despite being trained without explicit
cross-lingual supervision. We analyze the parameter spaces of three MLLMs to
study how their representations evolve during pre-training, observing patterns
consistent with compression: models initially form language-specific
representations, which gradually converge into cross-lingual abstractions as
training progresses. Through probing experiments, we observe a clear transition
from uniform language identification capabilities across layers to more
specialized layer functions. For deeper analysis, we focus on neurons that
encode distinct semantic concepts. By tracing their development during
pre-training, we show how they gradually align across languages. Notably, we
identify specific neurons that emerge as increasingly reliable predictors for
the same concepts across languages.

### [200] [ESGenius: Benchmarking LLMs on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) and Sustainability Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01646)
*Chaoyue He,Xin Zhou,Yi Wu,Xinjia Yu,Yan Zhang,Lei Zhang,Di Wang,Shengfei Lyu,Hong Xu,Xiaoqiao Wang,Wei Liu,Chunyan Miao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ESGenius是一个评估和提升大语言模型（LLM）在环境、社会和治理（ESG）及可持续性问题回答能力的综合基准，包含QA数据集和语料库，并通过零样本和RAG方法评估模型表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在ESG和可持续性领域的表现有限，缺乏专门的评估基准，因此需要开发一个全面的工具来提升模型在这些跨学科领域的理解和回答能力。

Method: ESGenius包含两部分：1）ESGenius-QA，由LLM生成并经专家验证的1,136道多选题；2）ESGenius-Corpus，包含231份权威文档。采用零样本和RAG两阶段评估协议，测试50个不同规模的LLM。

Result: 零样本设置下，最先进模型的准确率仅为55-70%，而使用RAG的模型（尤其是小模型）表现显著提升，例如“DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B”从63.82%提升至80.46%。

Conclusion: ESGenius是首个专注于ESG和可持续性领域的LLM基准，结果表明基于权威来源的RAG方法能显著提升模型表现，强调了跨学科背景下知识基础的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce ESGenius, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating and enhancing
the proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Environmental, Social and
Governance (ESG) and sustainability-focused question answering. ESGenius
comprises two key components: (i) ESGenius-QA, a collection of 1 136
multiple-choice questions generated by LLMs and rigorously validated by domain
experts, covering a broad range of ESG pillars and sustainability topics. Each
question is systematically linked to its corresponding source text, enabling
transparent evaluation and supporting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
methods; and (ii) ESGenius-Corpus, a meticulously curated repository of 231
foundational frameworks, standards, reports and recommendation documents from
seven authoritative sources. Moreover, to fully assess the capabilities and
adaptation potential of the model, we implement a rigorous two-stage evaluation
protocol -- Zero-Shot and RAG. Extensive experiments across 50 LLMs (ranging
from 0.5 B to 671 B parameters) demonstrate that state-of-the-art models
achieve only moderate performance in zero-shot settings, with accuracies
typically around 55--70\%, highlighting ESGenius's challenging nature for LLMs
in interdisciplinary contexts. However, models employing RAG show significant
performance improvements, particularly for smaller models. For example,
"DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B" improves from 63.82\% (zero-shot) to 80.46\%
with RAG. These results underscore the necessity of grounding responses in
authoritative sources for enhanced ESG understanding. To the best of our
knowledge, ESGenius is the first benchmark curated for LLMs and the relevant
enhancement technologies that focuses on ESG and sustainability topics.

*Chen Zhang,Zhiyuan Liao,Yansong Feng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言环境中文化知识传递的机制，发现高资源语言与英语之间存在双向传递，而低资源语言主要向英语单向传递。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有大量研究评估LLMs处理全球文化多样性的能力，但其文化知识获取机制（尤其是在多语言环境中）仍不明确。

Method: 引入了一个可解释的框架，研究文化知识在语言适应过程中的传递，确保训练数据透明并控制传递效果。

Result: 观察到高资源语言与英语之间的双向文化传递，而低资源语言主要向英语单向传递。提出频率假设解释这一现象。

Conclusion: 文化知识在预训练数据中出现频率越高，传递越容易，这一假设得到了训练语料库的实证分析支持。

Abstract: Despite substantial research efforts evaluating how well large language
models~(LLMs) handle global cultural diversity, the mechanisms behind their
cultural knowledge acquisition, particularly in multilingual settings, remain
unclear. We study this question by investigating how cultural knowledge
transfers across languages during language adaptation of LLMs. We introduce an
interpretable framework for studying this transfer, ensuring training data
transparency and controlling transfer effects. Through a study of four
non-Anglophonic cultures, we observe bidirectional cultural transfer between
English and other high-resource languages, while low-resource languages
primarily transfer knowledge to English with limited reverse flow. To explain
this asymmetric phenomenon, we propose a frequency-based hypothesis: cultural
knowledge appearing more frequently in the pretraining data transfers more
easily, which is supported by empirical analysis of the training corpora.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为StochasTok的随机分词方案，通过随机分割训练中的token，提升大语言模型在子词级任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在子词级任务（如字符计数、子串识别等）中表现不佳，主要原因是分词掩盖了词的细粒度结构。现有方法（如字符级分词）计算成本高且效果不稳定。

Method: 引入StochasTok，一种简单高效的随机分词方案，训练时随机分割token，使模型能‘看到’词的内部结构。

Result: 实验表明，StochasTok显著提升了模型在子词级任务中的表现，并能无缝集成到现有预训练模型中。

Conclusion: StochasTok通过微小改动实现了显著改进，展示了在更大模型中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Subword-level understanding is integral to numerous tasks, including
understanding multi-digit numbers, spelling mistakes, abbreviations, rhyming,
and wordplay. Despite this, current large language models (LLMs) still often
struggle with seemingly simple subword-level tasks like How many 'r's in
'strawberry'?. A key factor behind these failures is tokenization which
obscures the fine-grained structure of words. Current alternatives, such as
character-level and dropout tokenization methods, significantly increase
computational costs and provide inconsistent improvements. In this paper we
revisit tokenization and introduce StochasTok, a simple, efficient stochastic
tokenization scheme that randomly splits tokens during training, allowing LLMs
to 'see' their internal structure. Our experiments show that pretraining with
StochasTok substantially improves LLMs' downstream performance across multiple
subword-level language games, including character counting, substring
identification, and math tasks. Furthermore, StochasTok's simplicity allows
seamless integration at any stage of the training pipeline; and we demonstrate
that post-training with StochasTok can instill improved subword understanding
into existing pretrained models, thus avoiding costly pretraining from scratch.
These dramatic improvements achieved with a minimal change suggest StochasTok
holds exciting potential when applied to larger, more capable models. Code

TL;DR: 该论文综述了基于大语言模型（LLM）的协作系统在情感计算（AC）中的应用，探讨了其方法、实验结果及未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感计算任务存在结构僵化问题，而LLM虽提供了统一解决方案，但在情感推理中存在认知局限。论文旨在通过协作系统提升情感计算的鲁棒性和适应性。

Method: 论文系统回顾了现有方法，包括协作策略、机制、关键功能和应用，并通过实验比较了不同策略在情感理解与生成任务中的表现。

Result: 协作系统在复杂情感推理中展现出增强鲁棒性和适应性的潜力，但仍面临文化差异和幻觉问题等挑战。

Conclusion: 论文为LLM在AC中的协作智能提供了系统性探索，为未来研究指明了方向，推动更接近人类社交智能的应用发展。

Abstract: Affective Computing (AC) is essential in bridging the gap between human
emotional experiences and machine understanding. Traditionally, AC tasks in
natural language processing (NLP) have been approached through pipeline
architectures, which often suffer from structure rigidity that leads to
inefficiencies and limited adaptability. The advent of Large Language Models
(LLMs) has revolutionized this field by offering a unified approach to
affective understanding and generation tasks, enhancing the potential for
dynamic, real-time interactions. However, LLMs face cognitive limitations in
affective reasoning, such as misinterpreting cultural nuances or contextual
emotions, and hallucination problems in decision-making. To address these
challenges, recent research advocates for LLM-based collaboration systems that
emphasize interactions among specialized models and LLMs, mimicking human-like
affective intelligence through the synergy of emotional and rational thinking
that aligns with Dual Process Theory in psychology. This survey aims to provide
a comprehensive overview of LLM-based collaboration systems in AC, exploring
from structured collaborations to autonomous collaborations. Specifically, it
includes: (1) A systematic review of existing methods, focusing on
collaboration strategies, mechanisms, key functions, and applications; (2)
Experimental comparisons of collaboration strategies across representative
tasks in affective understanding and generation; (3) An analysis highlighting
the potential of these systems to enhance robustness and adaptability in
complex affective reasoning; (4) A discussion of key challenges and future
research directions to further advance the field. This work is the first to
systematically explore collaborative intelligence with LLMs in AC, paving the
way for more powerful applications that approach human-like social
intelligence.

*Dominik Macko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于微调小型LLMs的文本分类方法（mdok），用于检测机器生成的文本，并在Voight-Kampff Generative AI Detection 2025任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）生成的高质量文本难以被人类识别，可能被滥用（如抄袭、垃圾邮件、传播虚假信息），因此需要自动化检测方法。

Method: 通过微调小型LLMs进行文本分类，提出mdok方法，用于检测机器生成的文本。

Result: 在Voight-Kampff Generative AI Detection 2025任务中，mdok方法在二元检测和多类分类（排名第一）中表现优异。

Conclusion: mdok方法在检测机器生成文本方面具有鲁棒性，能够有效应对分布外数据的挑战。

Abstract: The large language models (LLMs) are able to generate high-quality texts in
multiple languages. Such texts are often not recognizable by humans as
generated, and therefore present a potential of LLMs for misuse (e.g.,
plagiarism, spams, disinformation spreading). An automated detection is able to
assist humans to indicate the machine-generated texts; however, its robustness
to out-of-distribution data is still challenging. This notebook describes our
mdok approach in robust detection, based on fine-tuning smaller LLMs for text
classification. It is applied to both subtasks of Voight-Kampff Generative AI
Detection 2025, providing remarkable performance in binary detection as well as
in multiclass (1st rank) classification of various cases of human-AI
collaboration.

TL;DR: 研究大型语言模型（LLM）训练中的公平性动态，提出两种新指标评估偏见，发现Pythia-6.9b对男性有偏见，并通过早期停止在公平性和准确性间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM训练中偏见的动态变化，以诊断和缓解偏见问题。

Method: 引入两种新指标（平均排名和部分Jensen-Shannon散度）评估偏见动态，并在WinoBias数据集上测试Pythia模型。

Result: Pythia-6.9b对男性偏见明显，早期停止可显著提高公平性；更大模型可能表现出更多偏见。

Conclusion: 监控公平性动态有助于发现和缓解偏见，早期停止是一种有效干预手段。

Abstract: We investigate fairness dynamics during Large Language Model (LLM) training
to enable the diagnoses of biases and mitigations through training
interventions like early stopping; we find that biases can emerge suddenly and
do not always follow common performance metrics. We introduce two new metrics
to evaluate fairness dynamics holistically during model pre-training: Average
Rank and Jensen-Shannon Divergence by Parts. These metrics provide insights
into the Pythia models' progression of biases in gender prediction of
occupations on the WinoBias dataset. By monitoring these dynamics, we find that
(1) Pythia-6.9b is biased towards men; it becomes more performant and confident
predicting "male" than "female" during training, (2) via early-stopping,
Pythia-6.9b can exchange 1.7% accuracy on LAMBADA for a 92.5% increase in
fairness, and (3) larger models can exhibit more bias; Pythia-6.9b makes more
assumptions about gender than Pythia-160m, even when a subject's gender is not
specified.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习（RL）的表格推理方法Reasoning-Table，通过数据预处理、奖励设计和训练策略优化，在多个基准测试中超越监督微调（SFT），并提升了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的监督微调方法在表格推理任务中存在泛化和鲁棒性问题，因此探索强化学习作为替代方案。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，结合数据预处理、奖励设计和定制训练策略，统一训练多样化的表格推理任务。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，超越SFT和Claude-3.7-Sonnet等模型，并在文本到SQL任务中达到68.3%的性能。

Conclusion: Reasoning-Table展示了强化学习在表格推理任务中的潜力，显著提升了模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Table reasoning, encompassing tasks such as table question answering, fact
verification, and text-to-SQL, requires precise understanding of structured
tabular data, coupled with numerical computation and code manipulation for
effective inference. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches have achieved
notable success but often struggle with generalization and robustness due to
biases inherent in imitative learning. We introduce Reasoning-Table, the first
application of reinforcement learning (RL) to table reasoning, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Through rigorous data preprocessing, reward
design, and tailored training strategies, our method leverages simple
rule-based outcome rewards to outperform SFT across multiple benchmarks.
Unified training across diverse tasks enables Reasoning-Table to emerge as a
robust table reasoning large language model, surpassing larger proprietary
models like Claude-3.7-Sonnet by 4.0% on table reasoning benchmarks. The
approach also achieves excellent performance on text-to-SQL tasks, reaching
68.3% performance on the BIRD dev dataset with a 7B model. Further experiments
demonstrate that Reasoning-Table enhances the model's generalization
capabilities and robustness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SRPO的两阶段反射增强强化学习框架，旨在提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的推理能力，通过高质量反射数据集和新型奖励机制显著提升了推理准确性和反思质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，尤其是缺乏有效的自我反思和自我修正能力，现有方法生成的反馈质量有限。

Method: 提出SRPO框架，分为两阶段：1）构建高质量反射数据集；2）在GRPO框架中引入新型奖励机制，鼓励简洁且有认知意义的反思。

Result: 在多个多模态推理基准测试中，SRPO显著优于现有模型，推理准确性和反思质量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: SRPO通过两阶段强化学习框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型的推理和反思能力，为复杂任务提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising capabilities in
reasoning tasks, yet still struggle with complex problems requiring explicit
self-reflection and self-correction, especially compared to their unimodal
text-based counterparts. Existing reflection methods are simplistic and
struggle to generate meaningful and instructive feedback, as the reasoning
ability and knowledge limits of pre-trained models are largely fixed during
initial training. To overcome these challenges, we propose Multimodal
Self-Reflection enhanced reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(SRPO), a two-stage reflection-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework
explicitly designed to enhance multimodal LLM reasoning. In the first stage, we
construct a high-quality, reflection-focused dataset under the guidance of an
advanced MLLM, which generates reflections based on initial responses to help
the policy model learn both reasoning and self-reflection. In the second stage,
we introduce a novel reward mechanism within the GRPO framework that encourages
concise and cognitively meaningful reflection while avoiding redundancy.
Extensive experiments across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks,
including MathVista, MathVision, MathVerse, and MMMU-Pro, using Qwen-2.5-VL-7B
and Qwen-2.5-VL-32B demonstrate that SRPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art models, achieving notable improvements in both reasoning
accuracy and reflection quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 习语的比喻意义与字面意义差异显著，模型需学习区分和选择这两种意义，研究旨在揭示模型如何处理这种歧义。

Method: 使用机制可解释性工具分析LLama3.2-1B-base模型，定位了习语处理的三个步骤：比喻意义检索、比喻表示路径和字面意义并行路径。

Result: 发现特定注意力头在早期子层中增强比喻意义并抑制字面意义，模型通过中间路径表示比喻意义，同时保留字面意义的并行路径。

Conclusion: 研究为自回归变压器中习语理解的机制提供了实证证据。

Abstract: Idioms present a unique challenge for language models due to their
non-compositional figurative meanings, which often strongly diverge from the
idiom's literal interpretation. This duality requires a model to learn
representing and deciding between the two meanings to interpret an idiom in a
figurative sense, or literally. In this paper, we employ tools from mechanistic
interpretability to trace how a large pretrained causal transformer
(LLama3.2-1B-base) deals with this ambiguity. We localize three steps of idiom
processing: First, the idiom's figurative meaning is retrieved in early
attention and MLP sublayers. We identify specific attention heads which boost
the figurative meaning of the idiom while suppressing the idiom's literal
interpretation. The model subsequently represents the figurative representation
through an intermediate path. Meanwhile, a parallel bypass route forwards
literal interpretation, ensuring that a both reading remain available. Overall,
our findings provide a mechanistic evidence for idiom comprehension in an
autoregressive transformer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练数据多为受版权或专有内容，限制了AI法规下的使用，需要合规的开放数据。

Result: Common Corpus包含约两万亿标记，涵盖多种语言和代码数据，已被行业领先者使用。

Conclusion: Common Corpus将成为LLM开放科学研究的关键基础设施。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large amounts of data from
different sources and domains. These data most often contain trillions of
tokens with large portions of copyrighted or proprietary content, which hinders
the usage of such models under AI legislation. This raises the need for truly
open pre-training data that is compliant with the data security regulations. In
this paper, we introduce Common Corpus, the largest open dataset for language
model pre-training. The data assembled in Common Corpus are either
uncopyrighted or under permissible licenses and amount to about two trillion
tokens. The dataset contains a wide variety of languages, ranging from the main
European languages to low-resource ones rarely present in pre-training
datasets; in addition, it includes a large portion of code data. The diversity
of data sources in terms of covered domains and time periods opens up the paths
for both research and entrepreneurial needs in diverse areas of knowledge. In
this technical report, we present the detailed provenance of data assembling
and the details of dataset filtering and curation. Being already used by such
industry leaders as Anthropic and multiple LLM training projects, we believe
that Common Corpus will become a critical infrastructure for open science
research in LLMs.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）在数值任务中存在数字偏差，类似于本福德定律，并提出通过修剪特定神经元来缓解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但在基础数值问题上常出错，研究探讨其数字偏差是否源于预训练数据中的长尾分布。

Method: 分析预训练数据（OLMo2）是否符合本福德定律，构建均匀分布的数字基准测试，并通过logit-lens和神经元解剖识别偏差来源。

Result: 开源LLMs表现出类似本福德定律的数字偏差，主要由深层少数神经元引起，修剪后可部分纠正错误输出。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了预训练数据统计与LLMs符号故障的关联，为数值任务中的幻觉诊断和缓解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance on complex
reasoning tasks, yet they frequently fail on basic numerical problems,
producing incorrect outputs. Inspired by Benford's Law -- a statistical pattern
where lower digits occur more frequently as leading digits -- we hypothesize
that the long-tailed digit distributions in web-collected corpora may be
learned by LLMs during pretraining, leading to biased numerical generation. To
investigate the hypothesis, we first examine whether digits frequencies in
pretraining corpus (OLMo2) follows Benford's law. We then construct an
evaluation benchmark with uniformly distributed ground-truth digits across
seven numerical reasoning tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that
leading open-source LLMs show a consistent pattern of digit bias that resembles
Benford's law. Through logit-lens tracing and neuron-level dissection, we
identify that this bias arises predominantly from a small subset of highly
digit-selective feed-forward network (FFN) neurons in the deeper layers.
Finally, we demonstrate that pruning these neurons mitigates imbalanced
overgeneration and partially corrects erroneous outputs, providing causal
evidence that fine-grained pretraining digit bias can propagate into model
behavior. Our findings reveal a fundamental connection between corpus-level
statistics and symbolic failure modes in LLMs, offering a new lens for
diagnosing and mitigating hallucinations in numerical tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR)的新方法，通过Role Identity Activation (RIA)和Reasoning Style Optimization (RSO)两个阶段，解决了Role-Playing Agents (RPAs)中的注意力分散和风格漂移问题，显著提升了RPAs的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RPAs基于显式对话数据，缺乏深层次的人类内部思维过程，导致知识表达和风格表现肤浅。尽管Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)可以模拟角色思维，但其直接应用会因注意力分散和风格漂移而受限。

Method: 提出RAR方法，包括RIA（通过角色档案明确引导模型）和RSO（通过LRM蒸馏优化推理风格）。

Result: 实验表明，RAR有效解决了注意力分散和风格漂移问题，显著提升了RPAs的性能。

Conclusion: RAR方法通过角色感知推理，显著改善了RPAs的表现，为情感陪伴和虚拟互动等应用提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant
interest in Role-Playing Agents (RPAs) for applications such as emotional
companionship and virtual interaction. However, recent RPAs are often built on
explicit dialogue data, lacking deep, human-like internal thought processes,
resulting in superficial knowledge and style expression. While Large Reasoning
Models (LRMs) can be employed to simulate character thought, their direct
application is hindered by attention diversion (i.e., RPAs forget their role)
and style drift (i.e., overly formal and rigid reasoning rather than
character-consistent reasoning). To address these challenges, this paper
introduces a novel Role-Aware Reasoning (RAR) method, which consists of two
important stages: Role Identity Activation (RIA) and Reasoning Style
Optimization (RSO). RIA explicitly guides the model with character profiles
during reasoning to counteract attention diversion, and then RSO aligns
reasoning style with the character and scene via LRM distillation to mitigate
style drift. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed RAR
significantly enhances the performance of RPAs by effectively addressing
attention diversion and style drift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kwak'wala是一种濒危语言，其早期文本以图像形式存在，无法被机器读取。数字化这些文本有助于语言复兴和技术开发。

Method: 结合现成OCR技术、语言识别和掩码技术，隔离Kwak'wala文本，并使用后校正模型提高转录质量。

Result: 提出了一种高效的方法，能够从图像中提取并转录Kwak'wala文本。

Conclusion: 该方法为濒危语言的数字化提供了可行方案，支持语言复兴和技术开发。

Abstract: Kwak'wala is an Indigenous language spoken in British Columbia, with a rich
legacy of published documentation spanning more than a century, and an active
community of speakers, teachers, and learners engaged in language
revitalization. Over 11 volumes of the earliest texts created during the
collaboration between Franz Boas and George Hunt have been scanned but remain
unreadable by machines. Complete digitization through optical character
recognition has the potential to facilitate transliteration into modern
orthographies and the creation of other language technologies. In this paper,
we apply the latest OCR techniques to a series of Kwak'wala texts only
accessible as images, and discuss the challenges and unique adaptations
necessary to make such technologies work for these real-world texts. Building
on previous methods, we propose using a mix of off-the-shelf OCR methods,
language identification, and masking to effectively isolate Kwak'wala text,
along with post-correction models, to produce a final high-quality
transcription.

evaluating their practical utility. However, existing evaluation methods often
focus on single-language scenarios, overlooking the challenges and differences
present in multilingual and cross-lingual contexts. To address this gap, we

*Shuai Wang,Yinan Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: iQUEST框架通过迭代分解复杂查询并结合GNN增强多跳推理，显著提升了KBQA任务中LLM的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在知识密集型任务中的事实不准确问题，尤其是多跳推理中的连贯性和关键连接丢失问题。

Method: 提出iQUEST框架，迭代分解查询并结合GNN预视2跳邻居信息，优化推理路径。

Result: 在四个基准数据集和四种LLM上均表现出一致性改进。

Conclusion: iQUEST通过结构化推理和前瞻性信息整合，有效提升了KBQA任务的性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many natural language processing
tasks, they often suffer from factual inaccuracies in knowledge-intensive
scenarios. Integrating external knowledge resources, particularly knowledge
graphs (KGs), provides a transparent and updatable foundation for more reliable
reasoning. Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA), which queries and reasons
over KGs, is central to this effort, especially for complex, multi-hop queries.
However, multi-hop reasoning poses two key challenges: (1)~maintaining coherent
reasoning paths, and (2)~avoiding prematurely discarding critical multi-hop
connections. To address these issues, we introduce iQUEST, a question-guided
KBQA framework that iteratively decomposes complex queries into simpler
sub-questions, ensuring a structured and focused reasoning trajectory.
Additionally, we integrate a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to look ahead and
incorporate 2-hop neighbor information at each reasoning step. This dual
approach strengthens the reasoning process, enabling the model to explore
viable paths more effectively. Detailed experiments demonstrate the consistent
improvement delivered by iQUEST across four benchmark datasets and four LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种以人为中心的评估框架（HCE），关注问题解决能力、信息质量和交互体验，通过实验验证了不同模型的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法过于依赖客观指标，忽略了真实的人类体验，因此需要一种更全面的主观评估框架。

Method: 通过540名参与者与模型协作完成开放式研究任务，收集主观数据集，评估模型在三个核心维度的表现。

Result: Grok 3表现最佳，其次是Deepseek R1和Gemini 2.5，OpenAI o3 mini表现较差。

Conclusion: HCE框架为标准化、自动化的主观评估提供了基础，推动了LLM的发展。

Abstract: Currently, nearly all evaluations of foundation models focus on objective
metrics, emphasizing quiz performance to define model capabilities. While this
model-centric approach enables rapid performance assessment, it fails to
reflect authentic human experiences. To address this gap, we propose a
Human-Centric subjective Evaluation (HCE) framework, focusing on three core
dimensions: problem-solving ability, information quality, and interaction
experience. Through experiments involving Deepseek R1, OpenAI o3 mini, Grok 3,
and Gemini 2.5, we conduct over 540 participant-driven evaluations, where
humans and models collaborate on open-ended research tasks, yielding a
comprehensive subjective dataset. This dataset captures diverse user feedback
across multiple disciplines, revealing distinct model strengths and
adaptability. Our findings highlight Grok 3's superior performance, followed by
Deepseek R1 and Gemini 2.5, with OpenAI o3 mini lagging behind. By offering a
novel framework and a rich dataset, this study not only enhances subjective
evaluation methodologies but also lays the foundation for standardized,
automated assessments, advancing LLM development for research and practical
scenarios. Our dataset link is

Motivation: 研究语法书在极低资源语言翻译中的有效性，尤其是语法规则检索和应用的问题。

Method: 将语法规则分解为检索和应用两步，引入ZhuangRules数据集，并提出将语法规则表示为代码函数。

Result: 规则检索是主要瓶颈，代码规则显著提升了检索和应用效果，翻译BLEU分数提升13.1%。

Conclusion: 代码化的语法规则能有效解决LLM在极低资源语言翻译中的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in translating
extremely low-resource languages using resources like dictionaries, the
effectiveness of grammar books remains debated. This paper investigates the
role of grammar books in translating extremely low-resource languages by
decomposing it into two key steps: grammar rule retrieval and application. To
facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of
grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that
rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation.
Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly
provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To
address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code
functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code
in facilitating LLM reasoning. Our experiments show that using code rules
significantly boosts both rule retrieval and application, ultimately resulting
in a 13.1% BLEU improvement in translation.

Motivation: 研究乌克兰冲突中社交媒体在信息战中的作用，揭示宣传与可信信息的传播策略差异。

Method: 收集2022年2月至5月的40,000条推文，结合自然语言处理、机器学习算法及人工分析，评估情感、主题和叙事。

Result: 宣传账户使用情绪化语言和虚假信息，可信账户侧重事实和人道主义；聚类分析发现疑似协同行为。

Conclusion: 研究增进了对信息战动态的理解，并为未来社交媒体影响力研究提供了方法。

Abstract: The conflict in Ukraine has been not only characterised by military
engagement but also by a significant information war, with social media
platforms like X, formerly known as Twitter playing an important role in
shaping public perception. This article provides an analysis of tweets from
propaganda accounts and trusted accounts collected from the onset of the war,
February 2022 until the middle of May 2022 with n=40,000 total tweets. We
utilise natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to assess
the sentiment and identify key themes, topics and narratives across the dataset
with human-in-the-loop (HITL) analysis throughout. Our findings indicate
distinct strategies in how information is created, spread, and targeted at
different audiences by both sides. Propaganda accounts frequently employ
emotionally charged language and disinformation to evoke fear and distrust,
whereas other accounts, primarily Western tend to focus on factual reporting
and humanitarian aspects of the conflict. Clustering analysis reveals groups of
accounts with similar behaviours, which we suspect indicates the presence of
coordinated efforts. This research attempts to contribute to our understanding
of the dynamics of information warfare and offers techniques for future studies
on social media influence in military conflicts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源模型在多模态输入处理和泛化能力上表现不足，研究旨在探索实现真正全模态的可行方法。

Method: 通过扩展模态技术，对现成语言模型进行目标域和语言数据的微调，并研究模型合并及知识共享的效果。

Result: 实验表明，扩展模态可能影响核心语言能力，但模型合并和知识共享有助于提升全模态性能。

Conclusion: 当前方法在实现真正全模态上存在挑战，但模型合并和知识共享是潜在的有效途径。

Abstract: Omni-modal language models (OLMs) aim to integrate and reason over diverse
input modalities--such as text, images, video, and audio--while maintaining
strong language capabilities. Despite recent advancements, existing models,
especially open-source ones, remain far from true omni-modality, struggling to
generalize beyond the specific modality pairs they are trained on or to achieve
strong performance when processing multi-modal inputs. We study the effect of
extending modality, the dominant technique for training multimodal models,
where an off-the-shelf language model is fine-tuned on target-domain and
language data. Specifically, we investigate three key questions: (1) Does
modality extension compromise core language abilities? (2) Can model merging
effectively integrate independently fine-tuned modality-specific models to
achieve omni-modality? (3) Does omni-modality extension lead to better
knowledge sharing and generalization compared to sequential extension? Through
extensive experiments, we analyze these trade-offs and provide insights into
the feasibility of achieving true omni-modality using current approaches.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了PRC对齐的DeepSeek-R1和非PRC对齐的ChatGPT o3-mini-high在宣传和反美情绪上的偏差，发现DeepSeek-R1在简体中文中表现出显著更高的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）在意识形态上的中立性，特别是PRC与非PRC模型之间的跨语言比较。

Method: 开发了1200个去语境化的问题，通过GPT-4o评分和人工标注评估7200个回答。

Result: DeepSeek-R1在简体中文中表现出更高的宣传和反美偏差，而ChatGPT o3-mini-high几乎无此类偏差。

Conclusion: LLMs存在显著的模型和语言依赖性偏差，PRC对齐模型在中文内容中表现出更强的意识形态倾向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly shape public understanding and
civic decisions, yet their ideological neutrality is a growing concern. While
existing research has explored various forms of LLM bias, a direct,
cross-lingual comparison of models with differing geopolitical
alignments-specifically a PRC-system model versus a non-PRC counterpart-has
been lacking. This study addresses this gap by systematically evaluating
DeepSeek-R1 (PRC-aligned) against ChatGPT o3-mini-high (non-PRC) for
Chinese-state propaganda and anti-U.S. sentiment. We developed a novel corpus
of 1,200 de-contextualized, reasoning-oriented questions derived from
Chinese-language news, presented in Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese,
and English. Answers from both models (7,200 total) were assessed using a
hybrid evaluation pipeline combining rubric-guided GPT-4o scoring with human
annotation. Our findings reveal significant model-level and language-dependent
biases. DeepSeek-R1 consistently exhibited substantially higher proportions of
both propaganda and anti-U.S. bias compared to ChatGPT o3-mini-high, which
remained largely free of anti-U.S. sentiment and showed lower propaganda
levels. For DeepSeek-R1, Simplified Chinese queries elicited the highest bias
rates; these diminished in Traditional Chinese and were nearly absent in
English. Notably, DeepSeek-R1 occasionally responded in Simplified Chinese to
Traditional Chinese queries and amplified existing PRC-aligned terms in its
Chinese answers, demonstrating an "invisible loudspeaker" effect. Furthermore,
such biases were not confined to overtly political topics but also permeated
cultural and lifestyle content, particularly in DeepSeek-R1.

Motivation: 评估AI辅导教师在教育对话中的教学能力，特别是在识别学生错误（Track 1）和定位错误（Track 2）方面的表现。

Method: 基于MPNet（结合BERT和XLNet优势的Transformer模型），采用类别加权交叉熵损失处理类别不平衡，并通过10折分组交叉验证和硬投票集成提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在官方测试集上，Track 1的宏观F1得分为0.7110，Track 2为0.5543。

Conclusion: 该集成方法为教育对话中可靠的辅导教师响应评估系统提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: We present Team BD's submission to the BEA 2025 Shared Task on Pedagogical
Ability Assessment of AI-powered Tutors, under Track 1 (Mistake Identification)
and Track 2 (Mistake Location). Both tracks involve three-class classification
of tutor responses in educational dialogues - determining if a tutor correctly
recognizes a student's mistake (Track 1) and whether the tutor pinpoints the
mistake's location (Track 2). Our system is built on MPNet, a Transformer-based
language model that combines BERT and XLNet's pre-training advantages. We
fine-tuned MPNet on the task data using a class-weighted cross-entropy loss to
handle class imbalance, and leveraged grouped cross-validation (10 folds) to
maximize the use of limited data while avoiding dialogue overlap between
training and validation. We then performed a hard-voting ensemble of the best
models from each fold, which improves robustness and generalization by
combining multiple classifiers. Our approach achieved strong results on both
tracks, with exact-match macro-F1 scores of approximately 0.7110 for Mistake
Identification and 0.5543 for Mistake Location on the official test set. We
include comprehensive analysis of our system's performance, including confusion
matrices and t-SNE visualizations to interpret classifier behavior, as well as
a taxonomy of common errors with examples. We hope our ensemble-based approach
and findings provide useful insights for designing reliable tutor response
evaluation systems in educational dialogue settings.

Motivation: 随着AI和LLMs的发展，专业幽默（如职场幽默）的自动化判断被忽视，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 开发了一个专业幽默数据集，并评估了五种LLMs对幽默适当性的判断能力。

Result: LLMs在判断幽默适当性时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在专业幽默理解上的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: With the recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language
Models (LLMs), the automation of daily tasks, like automatic writing, is
getting more and more attention. Hence, efforts have focused on aligning LLMs
with human values, yet humor, particularly professional industrial humor used
in workplaces, has been largely neglected. To address this, we develop a
dataset of professional humor statements along with features that determine the
appropriateness of each statement. Our evaluation of five LLMs shows that LLMs
often struggle to judge the appropriateness of humor accurately.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要依赖自然语言推理（NLI），无法全面评估引用质量，因此需要更精细的评估框架。

Method: 提出CiteEval框架，结合引用源、检索上下文、用户查询和生成文本进行多维度评估；构建CiteBench基准并开发CiteEval-Auto自动评估工具。

Result: CiteEval-Auto在实验中表现出与人工评估高度相关，优于现有评估指标。

Conclusion: CiteEval提供了一种可扩展且高效的引用评估方法，有助于提升模型生成引用的质量。

Abstract: Citation quality is crucial in information-seeking systems, directly
influencing trust and the effectiveness of information access. Current
evaluation frameworks, both human and automatic, mainly rely on Natural
Language Inference (NLI) to assess binary or ternary supportiveness from cited
sources, which we argue is a suboptimal proxy for citation evaluation. In this
work we introduce CiteEval, a citation evaluation framework driven by
principles focusing on fine-grained citation assessment within a broad context,
encompassing not only the cited sources but the full retrieval context, user
query, and generated text. Guided by the proposed framework, we construct
CiteBench, a multi-domain benchmark with high-quality human annotations on
citation quality. To enable efficient evaluation, we further develop
CiteEval-Auto, a suite of model-based metrics that exhibit strong correlation
with human judgments. Experiments across diverse systems demonstrate
CiteEval-Auto's superior ability to capture the multifaceted nature of
citations compared to existing metrics, offering a principled and scalable
approach to evaluate and improve model-generated citations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最小对干预的方法，评估大语言模型（LLMs）在代码转换（CS）上的表现，发现模型越大，越倾向于自然出现的CS句子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏评估LLMs在代码转换上与双语者行为一致性的方法，现有方法覆盖语言少、无法全面衡量CS现象或难以扩展。

Method: 采用最小对干预法，收集11种语言对的自然CS句子及其变体，通过人类和LLMs实验对比偏好。

Result: 人类实验显示双语者一致偏好自然CS句子；LLMs实验表明模型越大，越倾向于自然CS句子，尤其在封闭类词变体中差异显著。

Conclusion: 大语言模型在代码转换行为上逐渐接近双语者，模型规模是关键因素。

Abstract: There is a lack of an evaluation methodology that estimates the extent to
which large language models (LLMs) use code-switching (CS) in the same way as
bilinguals. Existing methods do not have wide language coverage, fail to
account for the diverse range of CS phenomena, or do not scale. We propose an
intervention based on minimal pairs of CS. Each minimal pair contains one
naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We
collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human
experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer
the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current
LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher
probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant. In
accordance with theoretical claims, the largest probability differences arise
in those pairs where the manipulated material consisted of closed-class words.

Motivation: 现有理论认为CS模式可由语法解释，但缺乏大规模跨语言实验验证。

Method: 设计仅依赖语法信息的自动预测系统，测试其对CS句子的区分能力。

Result: 系统仅凭语法即可区分CS句子，效果与双语者相当，且模式可泛化至未见过语言对。

Conclusion: 语法信息足以解释CS模式，支持现有理论。

Abstract: The theoretical code-switching (CS) literature provides numerous pointwise
investigations that aim to explain patterns in CS, i.e. why bilinguals switch
language in certain positions in a sentence more often than in others. A
resulting consensus is that CS can be explained by the syntax of the
contributing languages. There is however no large-scale, multi-language,
cross-phenomena experiment that tests this claim. When designing such an
experiment, we need to make sure that the system that is predicting where
bilinguals tend to switch has access only to syntactic information. We provide
such an experiment here. Results show that syntax alone is sufficient for an
automatic system to distinguish between sentences in minimal pairs of CS, to
the same degree as bilingual humans. Furthermore, the learnt syntactic patterns
generalise well to unseen language pairs.

Motivation: 现有基准测试未能全面评估LLMs在复杂对话中的表现，CONFETTI填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过109个人工模拟对话（313个用户轮次）进行离策略轮级评估，涵盖多种对话复杂性（如跟进、目标修正等），并加入对话行为标注。

Result: 测试显示，部分模型能处理长对话和20+API调用，但多数模型在长上下文或多API调用中表现不佳，链式功能调用尤为受限。表现最佳模型为Nova Pro（40.01%）、Claude Sonnet v3.5（35.46%）和Llama 3.1 405B（33.19%）。

Conclusion: CONFETTI为评估LLMs在复杂对话中的功能调用能力提供了有效工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce Conversational Function-Calling Evaluation Through Turn-Level
Interactions (CONFETTI), a conversational benchmark1 designed to evaluate the
function-calling capabilities and response quality of large language models
(LLMs). Current benchmarks lack comprehensive assessment of LLMs in complex
conversational scenarios. CONFETTI addresses this gap through 109
human-simulated conversations, comprising 313 user turns and covering 86 APIs.
These conversations explicitly target various conversational complexities, such
as follow-ups, goal correction and switching, ambiguous and implicit goals. We
perform off-policy turn-level evaluation using this benchmark targeting
function-calling. Our benchmark also incorporates dialog act annotations to
assess agent responses. We evaluate a series of state-of-the-art LLMs and
analyze their performance with respect to the number of available APIs,
conversation lengths, and chained function calling. Our results reveal that
while some models are able to handle long conversations, and leverage more than
20+ APIs successfully, other models struggle with longer context or when
increasing the number of APIs. We also report that the performance on chained
function-calls is severely limited across the models. Overall, the top
performing models on CONFETTI are Nova Pro (40.01%), Claude Sonnet v3.5
(35.46%) and Llama 3.1 405B (33.19%) followed by command-r-plus (31.18%) and
Mistral-Large-2407 (30.07%).

Motivation: 现有单细胞LLMs难以整合空间信息和捕捉细胞间交互，限制了其在生物学关系分析中的应用。

Method: Spatial2Sentence通过构建表达相似性和距离矩阵，将空间相邻且表达相似的细胞配对为正样本，远距离且表达不相似的细胞为负样本，生成多句子表示，利用多任务学习训练LLMs。

Result: 在糖尿病数据集上，Spatial2Sentence将细胞类型分类和临床状态预测分别提升了5.98%和4.18%，并增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: Spatial2Sentence通过自然语言整合空间和表达信息，显著提升了单细胞数据分析的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Image mass cytometry (IMC) enables high-dimensional spatial profiling by
combining mass cytometry's analytical power with spatial distributions of cell
phenotypes. Recent studies leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract
cell states by translating gene or protein expression into biological context.
However, existing single-cell LLMs face two major challenges: (1) Integration
of spatial information: they struggle to generalize spatial coordinates and
effectively encode spatial context as text, and (2) Treating each cell
independently: they overlook cell-cell interactions, limiting their ability to
capture biological relationships. To address these limitations, we propose
Spatial2Sentence, a novel framework that integrates single-cell expression and
spatial information into natural language using a multi-sentence approach.
Spatial2Sentence constructs expression similarity and distance matrices,
pairing spatially adjacent and expressionally similar cells as positive pairs
while using distant and dissimilar cells as negatives. These multi-sentence
representations enable LLMs to learn cellular interactions in both expression
and spatial contexts. Equipped with multi-task learning, Spatial2Sentence
outperforms existing single-cell LLMs on preprocessed IMC datasets, improving
cell-type classification by 5.98% and clinical status prediction by 4.18% on
the diabetes dataset while enhancing interpretability. The source code can be

Conclusion: 强调文化能力与技术能力并重，为阿拉伯语模型评估提供理论和实践指导。

Abstract: This paper addresses critical gaps in Arabic language model evaluation by
establishing comprehensive theoretical guidelines and introducing a novel
evaluation framework. We first analyze existing Arabic evaluation datasets,
identifying significant issues in linguistic accuracy, cultural alignment, and
methodological rigor. To address these limitations in LLMs, we present the
Arabic Depth Mini Dataset (ADMD), a carefully curated collection of 490
challenging questions spanning ten major domains (42 sub-domains, see Figure 1.
Using ADMD, we evaluate five leading language models: GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
Gemini Flash 1.5, CommandR 100B, and Qwen-Max. Our results reveal significant
variations in model performance across different domains, with particular
challenges in areas requiring deep cultural understanding and specialized
knowledge. Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrated the highest overall accuracy at 30\%,
showing relative strength in mathematical theory in Arabic, Arabic language,
and islamic domains. This work provides both theoretical foundations and
practical insights for improving Arabic language model evaluation, emphasizing
the importance of cultural competence alongside technical capabilities.

TL;DR: Eso-LMs结合了自回归和掩码扩散模型，提升了语言模型的性能和推理效率，首次为MDM引入KV缓存，推理速度提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决掩码扩散模型（MDM）在困惑度和推理效率上不如自回归模型的问题，同时融合两者的优势。

Method: 提出Eso-LMs模型，结合自回归和掩码扩散模型，引入KV缓存并优化采样计划。

Result: 在标准语言建模基准上达到新SOTA，推理速度比标准MDM快65倍，比半自回归方法快4倍。

Conclusion: Eso-LMs成功融合了两种模型的优势，显著提升了性能和效率，为语言模型提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Diffusion-based language models offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive (AR) models by enabling parallel and controllable generation.
Among this family of models, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) achieve the
strongest performance but still underperform AR models in perplexity and lack
key inference-time efficiency features--most notably, KV caching. In this work,
we introduce Eso-LMs, a new family of models that fuses AR and MDM paradigms,
enabling smooth interpolation between their perplexities while overcoming their
respective limitations. Eso-LMs set a new state of the art on standard language
modeling benchmarks. Crucially, we are the **first to introduce KV caching for
MDMs** while preserving parallel generation, significantly improving inference
efficiency. Combined with an optimized sampling schedule, our method achieves
up to **65x** faster inference than standard MDMs and **4x** faster inference
than prior semi-autoregressive approaches. We provide the code and model
checkpoints on the project page:

Motivation: 当前奖励模型在下游任务中的效果未与评估进展同步，需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: 通过引入新的人类提示构建RewardBench 2，评估现有模型的表现，并量化其与下游任务的相关性。

Result: RewardBench 2使模型平均得分比第一版低约20分，但与下游任务表现高度相关。

Conclusion: RewardBench 2为奖励模型提供了更严格的评估标准，并验证了其与下游任务的相关性。

Abstract: Reward models are used throughout the post-training of language models to
capture nuanced signals from preference data and provide a training target for
optimization across instruction following, reasoning, safety, and more domains.
The community has begun establishing best practices for evaluating reward
models, from the development of benchmarks that test capabilities in specific
skill areas to others that test agreement with human preferences. At the same
time, progress in evaluation has not been mirrored by the effectiveness of
reward models in downstream tasks -- simpler direct alignment algorithms are
reported to work better in many cases. This paper introduces RewardBench 2, a
new multi-skill reward modeling benchmark designed to bring new, challenging
data for accuracy-based reward model evaluation -- models score about 20 points
on average lower on RewardBench 2 compared to the first RewardBench -- while
being highly correlated with downstream performance. Compared to most other
benchmarks, RewardBench 2 sources new human prompts instead of existing prompts
from downstream evaluations, facilitating more rigorous evaluation practices.
In this paper, we describe our benchmark construction process and report how
existing models perform on it, while quantifying how performance on the
benchmark correlates with downstream use of the models in both inference-time
scaling algorithms, like best-of-N sampling, and RLHF training algorithms like
proximal policy optimization.

Motivation: 探索RLVR机制，理解token熵模式如何影响LLM推理性能。

Method: 通过分析CoT推理中的token熵模式，研究RLVR训练中熵模式的变化，并优化高熵token。

Result: 仅优化20%高熵token在多个模型上表现优于全梯度更新，而优化低熵token导致性能下降。

Conclusion: RLVR效果主要源于优化高熵token，未来可通过熵视角进一步优化LLM推理。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), while its mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work,
we undertake a pioneering exploration of RLVR through the novel perspective of
token entropy patterns, comprehensively analyzing how different tokens
influence reasoning performance. By examining token entropy patterns in
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, we observe that only a small fraction of
tokens exhibit high entropy, and these tokens act as critical forks that steer
the model toward diverse reasoning pathways. Furthermore, studying how entropy
patterns evolve during RLVR training reveals that RLVR largely adheres to the
base model's entropy patterns, primarily adjusting the entropy of high-entropy
tokens. These findings highlight the significance of high-entropy tokens (i.e.,
forking tokens) to RLVR. We ultimately improve RLVR by restricting policy
gradient updates to forking tokens and uncover a finding even beyond the 80/20
rule: utilizing only 20% of the tokens while maintaining performance comparable
to full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-8B base model and significantly
surpassing full-gradient updates on the Qwen3-32B (+11.04 on AIME'25 and +7.71
on AIME'24) and Qwen3-14B (+4.79 on AIME'25 and +5.21 on AIME'24) base models,
highlighting a strong scaling trend. In contrast, training exclusively on the
80% lowest-entropy tokens leads to a marked decline in performance. These
findings indicate that the efficacy of RLVR primarily arises from optimizing
the high-entropy tokens that decide reasoning directions. Collectively, our
results highlight the potential to understand RLVR through a token-entropy
perspective and optimize RLVR by leveraging high-entropy minority tokens to
further improve LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多选问答中表现出置信度失真问题，即对正确答案信心不足而对错误答案过度自信，尤其是在选项较多时。这导致性能下降，亟需解决。

Method: 提出Self-ensemble方法，将选项分组并通过设计的注意力掩码和位置编码集成预测结果，无需标注数据调参。

Result: 在三个LLMs和数据集上的实验表明，Self-ensemble有效解决了置信度失真问题，性能优于标准推理和基线方法。

Conclusion: Self-ensemble是一种即插即用的方法，能显著提升LLMs在多选问答中的表现，无需额外调参。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in general fields, they
exhibit a confidence distortion problem on multi-choice question-answering
(MCQA), particularly as the number of answer choices increases. Specifically,
on MCQA with many choices, LLMs suffer from under-confidence in correct
predictions and over-confidence in incorrect ones, leading to a substantially
degraded performance. To solve this problem, we propose Self-ensemble in this
work. Our method splits the choices into several groups and ensembles LLM
predictions across these groups to reach a final decision. The advantage of
Self-ensemble is its plug-and-play nature, where it can be integrated into
existing LLM architecture based on a designed attention mask and positional
encoding, without requiring labeled datasets for parameter tuning. Experimental
results on three LLMs and datasets demonstrate that Self-ensemble
comprehensively addresses the confidence distortion problem of LLMs,
outperforming standard inference as well as baseline methods.

Motivation: 评估LLM是否能超越一般浏览任务，处理复杂、繁琐的任务，填补现有基准测试的不足。

Method: 基于WebArena的四个模拟环境，设计了包含大量记忆、计算和长期记忆任务的WebChoreArena基准测试。

Result: 实验显示，随着LLM（如GPT-4o、Claude 3.7 Sonnet、Gemini 2.5 Pro）的进步，性能显著提升，但仍未达到WebArena的水平。

Conclusion: WebChoreArena能有效衡量LLM的进步，但复杂任务仍具挑战性，未来需进一步优化。

Abstract: Powered by a large language model (LLM), a web browsing agent operates web
browsers in a human-like manner and offers a highly transparent path toward
automating a wide range of everyday tasks. As web agents become increasingly
capable and demonstrate proficiency in general browsing tasks, a critical
question emerges: Can they go beyond general browsing to robustly handle tasks
that are tedious and complex, or chores that humans often avoid doing
themselves? In this paper, we introduce WebChoreArena, a new fully reproducible
benchmark comprising 532 carefully curated tasks designed to extend the scope
of WebArena beyond general browsing to more labor-intensive and tedious tasks.
WebChoreArena systematically integrates three key challenges: (i) Massive
Memory tasks requiring accurate retrieval of large amounts of information in
the observations, (ii) Calculation tasks demanding precise mathematical
reasoning, and (iii) Long-Term Memory tasks necessitating long-term memory
across multiple webpages. Built on top of the fully reproducible and widely
adopted four WebArena simulation environments, WebChoreArena ensures strict
reproducibility and enables fair, direct comparisons with the established
WebArena benchmark, offering key insights into agent progress. Our experimental
results demonstrate that as LLMs evolve, represented by GPT-4o, Claude 3.7
Sonnet, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, significant improvements in performance are
observed on WebChoreArena. These findings suggest that WebChoreArena is
well-suited to measure the advancement of state-of-the-art LLMs with greater
clarity. Nevertheless, the results also indicate that even with Gemini 2.5 Pro,
there remains substantial room for improvement compared to WebArena,
highlighting the increased challenges posed by WebChoreArena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RAG方法在事实一致性和知识检索方面表现优异，但其大规模系统计算资源消耗高且易产生幻觉内容，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: DRAG框架基于证据和知识图谱的蒸馏方法，将大型模型的知识迁移到小型模型中，同时通过结构化知识图谱和排名证据对齐预测，减少幻觉。

Result: 实验表明，DRAG在多个基准测试中优于现有RAG方法（如MiniRAG），性能提升高达27.7%，同时保持高效和可靠。

Conclusion: DRAG为在小型语言模型中部署增强的检索和生成能力提供了实用且资源高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have proven highly effective for
tasks requiring factual consistency and robust knowledge retrieval. However,
large-scale RAG systems consume significant computational resources and are
prone to generating hallucinated content from Humans. In this work, we
introduce $\texttt{DRAG}$, a novel framework for distilling RAG knowledge from
large-scale Language Models (LLMs) into small LMs (SLMs). Our approach
leverages evidence- and knowledge graph-based distillation, ensuring that the
distilled model retains critical factual knowledge while significantly reducing
model size and computational cost. By aligning the smaller model's predictions
with a structured knowledge graph and ranked evidence, $\texttt{DRAG}$
effectively mitigates hallucinations and improves factual accuracy. We further
present a case demonstrating how our framework mitigates user privacy risks and
introduce a corresponding benchmark. Experimental evaluations on multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the prior competitive RAG
methods like MiniRAG for SLMs by up to 27.7% using the same models, preserving
high-level efficiency and reliability. With $\texttt{DRAG}$, we provide a
practical and resource-efficient roadmap to deploying enhanced retrieval and
generation capabilities in small-sized LLMs.

Motivation: 现有方法未能明确学习场景状态变化，而理解程序性活动需要建模动作步骤如何改变场景以及场景变化如何影响动作序列。

Method: 利用LLM生成的状态变化描述作为监督信号，并生成反事实场景模拟假设失败结果，以增强模型对因果关系的理解。

Result: 在多个程序感知任务（如时序动作分割、错误检测等）上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的状态变化描述及反事实推理方法有效提升了模型对程序性活动的理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding a procedural activity requires modeling both how action steps
transform the scene, and how evolving scene transformations can influence the
sequence of action steps, even those that are accidental or erroneous. Yet,
existing work on procedure-aware video representations fails to explicitly
learned the state changes (scene transformations). In this work, we study
procedure-aware video representation learning by incorporating state-change
descriptions generated by LLMs as supervision signals for video encoders.
Moreover, we generate state-change counterfactuals that simulate hypothesized
failure outcomes, allowing models to learn by imagining the unseen ``What if''
scenarios. This counterfactual reasoning facilitates the model's ability to
understand the cause and effect of each step in an activity. To verify the
procedure awareness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on
procedure-aware tasks, including temporal action segmentation, error detection,
and more. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
state-change descriptions and their counterfactuals, and achieve significant
improvements on multiple tasks.

Conclusion: VeBrain展示了强大的适应性、灵活性和组合能力，是机器人控制领域的有效解决方案。

Abstract: The remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
attracted increasing attention to extend them to physical entities like legged
robot. This typically requires MLLMs to not only grasp multimodal understanding
abilities, but also integrate visual-spatial reasoning and physical interaction
capabilities. Nevertheless,existing methods struggle to unify these
capabilities due to their fundamental differences.In this paper, we present the
Visual Embodied Brain (VeBrain), a unified framework for perception, reasoning,
and control in real world. VeBrain reformulates robotic control into common
text-based MLLM tasks in the 2D visual space, thus unifying the objectives and
mapping spaces of different tasks. Then, a novel robotic adapter is proposed to
convert textual control signals from MLLMs to motion policies of real robots.
From the data perspective, we further introduce VeBrain-600k, a high-quality
instruction dataset encompassing various capabilities of VeBrain. In
VeBrain-600k, we take hundreds of hours to collect, curate and annotate the
data, and adopt multimodal chain-of-thought(CoT) to mix the different
capabilities into a single conversation. Extensive experiments on 13 multimodal
benchmarks and 5 spatial intelligence benchmarks demonstrate the superior
performance of VeBrain to existing MLLMs like Qwen2.5-VL. When deployed to
legged robots and robotic arms, VeBrain shows strong adaptability, flexibility,
and compositional capabilities compared to existing methods. For example,
compared to Qwen2.5-VL, VeBrain not only achieves substantial gains on MMVet by
+5.6%, but also excels in legged robot tasks with +50% average gains.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent progress in Sign Language Translation (SLT) has focussed primarily on
improving the representational capacity of large language models to incorporate
Sign Language features. This work explores an alternative direction: enhancing
the geometric properties of skeletal representations themselves. We propose
Geo-Sign, a method that leverages the properties of hyperbolic geometry to
model the hierarchical structure inherent in sign language kinematics. By
projecting skeletal features derived from Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional
Networks (ST-GCNs) into the Poincar\'e ball model, we aim to create more
discriminative embeddings, particularly for fine-grained motions like finger
articulations. We introduce a hyperbolic projection layer, a weighted Fr\'echet
mean aggregation scheme, and a geometric contrastive loss operating directly in
hyperbolic space. These components are integrated into an end-to-end
translation framework as a regularisation function, to enhance the
representations within the language model. This work demonstrates the potential
of hyperbolic geometry to improve skeletal representations for Sign Language
Translation, improving on SOTA RGB methods while preserving privacy and
improving computational efficiency. Code available here:

Abstract: This paper examines the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and deep
learning for detecting endangered deer species in their natural habitats. As
traditional identification processes require trained manual labor that can be
costly in resources and time, there is a need for more efficient solutions.
Leveraging high-resolution aerial imagery, advanced computer vision techniques
are applied to automate the identification process of deer across two distinct
projects in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first project, Pantano Project,
involves the marsh deer in the Paran\'a Delta, while the second, WiMoBo,
focuses on the Pampas deer in Campos del Tuy\'u National Park. A tailored
algorithm was developed using the YOLO framework, trained on extensive datasets
compiled from UAV-captured images. The findings demonstrate that the algorithm
effectively identifies marsh deer with a high degree of accuracy and provides
initial insights into its applicability to Pampas deer, albeit with noted
limitations. This study not only supports ongoing conservation efforts but also
highlights the potential of integrating AI with UAV technology to enhance

Conclusion: FastCAR在任务整合中表现出高效性和性能优势，适用于类似科学和工程应用。

Abstract: FastCAR is a novel task consolidation approach in Multi-Task Learning (MTL)
for a classification and a regression task, despite the non-triviality of task
heterogeneity with only a subtle correlation. The approach addresses the
classification of a detected object (occupying the entire image frame) and
regression for modeling a continuous property variable (for instances of an
object class), a crucial use case in science and engineering. FastCAR involves
a label transformation approach that is amenable for use with only a
single-task regression network architecture. FastCAR outperforms traditional
MTL model families, parametrized in the landscape of architecture and loss
weighting schemes, when learning both tasks are collectively considered
(classification accuracy of 99.54%, regression mean absolute percentage error
of 2.4%). The experiments performed used "Advanced Steel Property Dataset"
contributed by us https://github.com/fastcandr/AdvancedSteel-Property-Dataset.
The dataset comprises 4536 images of 224x224 pixels, annotated with discrete
object classes and its hardness property that can take continuous values. Our

efficiency (2.52x quicker) and reduced inference latency (55% faster) than

Motivation: 由于驾驶数据集中事故事件的稀缺性，现有视频扩散技术难以生成逼真的汽车碰撞场景，而提升交通安全需要可控且真实的模拟。

Conclusion: Ctrl-Crash为交通安全的可控模拟提供了有效工具，能够生成高质量且逼真的汽车碰撞视频。

Abstract: Video diffusion techniques have advanced significantly in recent years;
however, they struggle to generate realistic imagery of car crashes due to the
scarcity of accident events in most driving datasets. Improving traffic safety
requires realistic and controllable accident simulations. To tackle the
problem, we propose Ctrl-Crash, a controllable car crash video generation model
that conditions on signals such as bounding boxes, crash types, and an initial
image frame. Our approach enables counterfactual scenario generation where
minor variations in input can lead to dramatically different crash outcomes. To
support fine-grained control at inference time, we leverage classifier-free
guidance with independently tunable scales for each conditioning signal.
Ctrl-Crash achieves state-of-the-art performance across quantitative video
quality metrics (e.g., FVD and JEDi) and qualitative measurements based on a
human-evaluation of physical realism and video quality compared to prior
diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: ZeShot-VQA提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案，适用于自然灾害响应中的开放性问题。

Abstract: Natural disasters usually affect vast areas and devastate infrastructures.
Performing a timely and efficient response is crucial to minimize the impact on
affected communities, and data-driven approaches are the best choice. Visual
question answering (VQA) models help management teams to achieve in-depth
understanding of damages. However, recently published models do not possess the
ability to answer open-ended questions and only select the best answer among a
predefined list of answers. If we want to ask questions with new additional
possible answers that do not exist in the predefined list, the model needs to
be fin-tuned/retrained on a new collected and annotated dataset, which is a
time-consuming procedure. In recent years, large-scale Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) have earned significant attention. These models are trained on extensive
datasets and demonstrate strong performance on both unimodal and multimodal
vision/language downstream tasks, often without the need for fine-tuning. In
this paper, we propose a VLM-based zero-shot VQA (ZeShot-VQA) method, and
investigate the performance of on post-disaster FloodNet dataset. Since the
proposed method takes advantage of zero-shot learning, it can be applied on new
datasets without fine-tuning. In addition, ZeShot-VQA is able to process and
generate answers that has been not seen during the training procedure, which
demonstrates its flexibility.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视频帧的链式推理方法（CoF），通过生成与关键帧相关的推理步骤，显著提升视频LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频多模态任务中缺乏对关键帧的显式引用，导致推理不准确。

Method: 创建CoF-Data数据集，并基于此微调视频LLMs，无需辅助网络。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中表现优异，减少幻觉率。

Conclusion: CoF方法简单有效，显著提升视频LLMs的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that eliciting Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
reasoning traces in natural language before answering the user's request can
significantly improve their performance across tasks. This approach has been
extended to multimodal LLMs, where the models can produce chain-of-thoughts
(CoT) about the content of input images and videos. In this work, we propose to
obtain video LLMs whose reasoning steps are grounded in, and explicitly refer
to, the relevant video frames. For this, we first create CoF-Data, a large
dataset of diverse questions, answers, and corresponding frame-grounded
reasoning traces about both natural and synthetic videos, spanning various
topics and tasks. Then, we fine-tune existing video LLMs on this
chain-of-frames (CoF) data. Our approach is simple and self-contained, and,
unlike existing approaches for video CoT, does not require auxiliary networks
to select or caption relevant frames. We show that our models based on CoF are
able to generate chain-of-thoughts that accurately refer to the key frames to
answer the given question. This, in turn, leads to improved performance across
multiple video understanding benchmarks, for example, surpassing leading video
LLMs on Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, and notably reducing the
hallucination rate. Code available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于不确定性的置信度图方法，通过Difficulty Balancing (DB)损失和Occlusion Avoiding (OA)损失，分别解决像素学习难度差异和遮挡问题，显著提升了光流和立体深度任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法对所有像素采用统一的损失函数，忽略了像素和区域间学习难度的显著差异，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出DB损失，利用基于误差的置信度度量，使网络更关注挑战性像素；提出OA损失，通过循环一致性引导网络避开遮挡区域。

Result: 实验表明，结合DB和OA损失显著提升了光流和立体深度任务的性能。

Conclusion: 通过结合DB和OA损失，有效解决了像素学习难度差异和遮挡问题，为光流和立体深度任务提供了更优的训练策略。

Abstract: Conventional training for optical flow and stereo depth models typically
employs a uniform loss function across all pixels. However, this
one-size-fits-all approach often overlooks the significant variations in
learning difficulty among individual pixels and contextual regions. This paper
investigates the uncertainty-based confidence maps which capture these
spatially varying learning difficulties and introduces tailored solutions to
address them. We first present the Difficulty Balancing (DB) loss, which
utilizes an error-based confidence measure to encourage the network to focus
more on challenging pixels and regions. Moreover, we identify that some
difficult pixels and regions are affected by occlusions, resulting from the
inherently ill-posed matching problem in the absence of real correspondences.
To address this, we propose the Occlusion Avoiding (OA) loss, designed to guide
the network into cycle consistency-based confident regions, where feature
matching is more reliable. By combining the DB and OA losses, we effectively
manage various types of challenging pixels and regions during training.
Experiments on both optical flow and stereo depth tasks consistently
demonstrate significant performance improvements when applying our proposed
combination of the DB and OA losses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于深度学习的视觉跟踪方法取得了显著进展，但其在面对精心设计的对抗攻击时表现出脆弱性，导致跟踪性能急剧下降。

Method: DiffDf通过结合像素级重建损失、语义一致性损失和结构相似性损失，建立多尺度防御机制，并通过逐步去噪过程有效抑制对抗扰动。

Result: 在多个主流数据集上的实验结果表明，DiffDf对不同架构的跟踪器表现出优异的泛化性能，显著提升了各项评估指标，同时实现超过30 FPS的实时推理速度。

Conclusion: DiffDf展示了出色的防御性能和效率，代码已开源。

Abstract: Although deep learning-based visual tracking methods have made significant
progress, they exhibit vulnerabilities when facing carefully designed
adversarial attacks, which can lead to a sharp decline in tracking performance.
To address this issue, this paper proposes for the first time a novel
adversarial defense method based on denoise diffusion probabilistic models,
termed DiffDf, aimed at effectively improving the robustness of existing visual
tracking methods against adversarial attacks. DiffDf establishes a multi-scale
defense mechanism by combining pixel-level reconstruction loss, semantic
consistency loss, and structural similarity loss, effectively suppressing
adversarial perturbations through a gradual denoising process. Extensive
experimental results on several mainstream datasets show that the DiffDf method
demonstrates excellent generalization performance for trackers with different
architectures, significantly improving various evaluation metrics while
achieving real-time inference speeds of over 30 FPS, showcasing outstanding
defense performance and efficiency. Codes are available at

Method: 提出Perceptual Manifold Guidance（PMG）算法，利用预训练扩散模型和感知特征提取多尺度、多时间步的特征图。

Result: 实验表明，PMG提取的特征与人类感知高度相关，并在NR-IQA任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: PMG是首个利用感知特征引导扩散模型进行NR-IQA的方法，具有优异的泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in latent diffusion models that generate
high-dimensional image data and perform various downstream tasks, there has
been little exploration into perceptual consistency within these models on the
task of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA). In this paper, we
hypothesize that latent diffusion models implicitly exhibit perceptually
consistent local regions within the data manifold. We leverage this insight to
guide on-manifold sampling using perceptual features and input measurements.
Specifically, we propose Perceptual Manifold Guidance (PMG), an algorithm that
utilizes pretrained latent diffusion models and perceptual quality features to
obtain perceptually consistent multi-scale and multi-timestep feature maps from
the denoising U-Net. We empirically demonstrate that these hyperfeatures
exhibit high correlation with human perception in IQA tasks. Our method can be
applied to any existing pretrained latent diffusion model and is
straightforward to integrate. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the
first work on guiding diffusion model with perceptual features for NR-IQA.
Extensive experiments on IQA datasets show that our method, LGDM, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the superior generalization
capabilities of diffusion models for NR-IQA tasks.

Result: 在COCO和Objects365数据集上，VocAda显著提升了三种先进检测器的性能。

Conclusion: VocAda是一种通用且高效的词汇优化方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection models allow users to freely specify a class
vocabulary in natural language at test time, guiding the detection of desired
objects. However, vocabularies can be overly broad or even mis-specified,
hampering the overall performance of the detector. In this work, we propose a
plug-and-play Vocabulary Adapter (VocAda) to refine the user-defined
vocabulary, automatically tailoring it to categories that are relevant for a
given image. VocAda does not require any training, it operates at inference
time in three steps: i) it uses an image captionner to describe visible
objects, ii) it parses nouns from those captions, and iii) it selects relevant
classes from the user-defined vocabulary, discarding irrelevant ones.
Experiments on COCO and Objects365 with three state-of-the-art detectors show
that VocAda consistently improves performance, proving its versatility. The
code is open source.

Conclusion: 该框架适用于实际多目标检测场景，兼具高精度和高效性。

Abstract: In the surveillance and defense domain, multi-target detection and
classification (MTD) is considered essential yet challenging due to
heterogeneous inputs from diverse data sources and the computational complexity
of algorithms designed for resource-constrained embedded devices, particularly
for Al-based solutions. To address these challenges, we propose a feature
fusion and knowledge-distilled framework for multi-modal MTD that leverages
data fusion to enhance accuracy and employs knowledge distillation for improved
domain adaptation. Specifically, our approach utilizes both RGB and thermal
image inputs within a novel fusion-based multi-modal model, coupled with a
distillation training pipeline. We formulate the problem as a posterior
probability optimization task, which is solved through a multi-stage training
pipeline supported by a composite loss function. This loss function effectively
transfers knowledge from a teacher model to a student model. Experimental
results demonstrate that our student model achieves approximately 95% of the
teacher model's mean Average Precision while reducing inference time by
approximately 50%, underscoring its suitability for practical MTD deployment
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有基于提示的方法在医学目标检测任务中存在前景-背景信息耦合以及提示与图像-文本标记耦合的问题，导致性能受限。

Method: 框架包含两部分：1) 实例级提示生成（\ipg），解耦细粒度实例级知识并生成专注于密集预测的提示；2) 解耦提示注意力（\dpa），优化提示信息传递并减少内存使用。

Result: 在13个临床数据集上的实验显示，\method在多种设置下均优于现有方法，FAP提升最高达12.88%。

Conclusion: \method通过解耦设计有效解决了医学领域中的挑战，显著提升了增量医学目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Existing prompt-based approaches have demonstrated impressive performance in
continual learning, leveraging pre-trained large-scale models for
classification tasks; however, the tight coupling between foreground-background
information and the coupled attention between prompts and image-text tokens
present significant challenges in incremental medical object detection tasks,
due to the conceptual gap between medical and natural domains. To overcome
these challenges, we introduce the \method~framework, which comprises two main
components: 1) Instance-level Prompt Generation (\ipg), which decouples
fine-grained instance-level knowledge from images and generates prompts that
focus on dense predictions, and 2) Decoupled Prompt Attention (\dpa), which
decouples the original prompt attention, enabling a more direct and efficient
transfer of prompt information while reducing memory usage and mitigating
catastrophic forgetting. We collect 13 clinical, cross-modal, multi-organ, and
multi-category datasets, referred to as \dataset, and experiments demonstrate
that \method~outperforms existing SOTA methods, with FAP improvements of
5.44\%, 4.83\%, 12.88\%, and 4.59\% in full data, 1-shot, 10-shot, and 50-shot

Motivation: 高分辨率图像合成在生成模型中仍具挑战性，需平衡计算效率与细节保留。

Result: LWD在超高清图像合成中提升感知质量并降低FID，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 频率感知的信号驱动监督是高效高分辨率生成建模的有效方法。

Abstract: High-resolution image synthesis remains a core challenge in generative
modeling, particularly in balancing computational efficiency with the
preservation of fine-grained visual detail. We present Latent Wavelet Diffusion
(LWD), a lightweight framework that enables any latent diffusion model to scale
to ultra-high-resolution image generation (2K to 4K) for free. LWD introduces
three key components: (1) a scale-consistent variational autoencoder objective
that enhances the spectral fidelity of latent representations; (2) wavelet
energy maps that identify and localize detail-rich spatial regions within the
latent space; and (3) a time-dependent masking strategy that focuses denoising
supervision on high-frequency components during training. LWD requires no
architectural modifications and incurs no additional computational overhead.
Despite its simplicity, it consistently improves perceptual quality and reduces
FID in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, outperforming strong baseline
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of frequency-aware,
signal-driven supervision as a principled and efficient approach for
high-resolution generative modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the crucial task of brain tumor segmentation in
medical imaging and propose innovative approaches to enhance its performance.
The current state-of-the-art nnU-Net has shown promising results but suffers
from extensive training requirements and underutilization of pre-trained
weights. To overcome these limitations, we integrate Axial-Coronal-Sagittal
convolutions and pre-trained weights from ImageNet into the nnU-Net framework,
resulting in reduced training epochs, reduced trainable parameters, and
improved efficiency. Two strategies for transferring 2D pre-trained weights to
the 3D domain are presented, ensuring the preservation of learned relationships
and feature representations critical for effective information propagation.
Furthermore, we explore a joint classification and segmentation model that
leverages pre-trained encoders from a brain glioma grade classification proxy
task, leading to enhanced segmentation performance, especially for challenging
tumor labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods in the
fast training settings achieve comparable or even outperform the ensemble of
cross-validation models, a common practice in the brain tumor segmentation
literature.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of few-shot learning (FSL) approaches
in recognizing Bangla handwritten characters and numerals using limited labeled
data. It demonstrates the applicability of these methods to scripts with
intricate and complex structures, where dataset scarcity is a common challenge.
Given the complexity of Bangla script, we hypothesize that models performing
well on these characters can generalize effectively to languages of similar or
lower structural complexity. To this end, we introduce SynergiProtoNet, a
hybrid network designed to improve the recognition accuracy of handwritten
characters and digits. The model integrates advanced clustering techniques with
a robust embedding framework to capture fine-grained details and contextual
nuances. It leverages multi-level (both high- and low-level) feature extraction
within a prototypical learning framework. We rigorously benchmark
SynergiProtoNet against several state-of-the-art few-shot learning models:
BD-CSPN, Prototypical Network, Relation Network, Matching Network, and
SimpleShot, across diverse evaluation settings including Monolingual
Intra-Dataset Evaluation, Monolingual Inter-Dataset Evaluation, Cross-Lingual
Transfer, and Split Digit Testing. Experimental results show that
SynergiProtoNet consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new

Result: 在标准数据集上，BAGNet在精度和推理时间上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BAGNet通过优化边界点特征提取和全局特征保持，实现了高效且高精度的点云语义分割。

Abstract: Since the point cloud data is inherently irregular and unstructured, point
cloud semantic segmentation has always been a challenging task. The graph-based
method attempts to model the irregular point cloud by representing it as a
graph; however, this approach incurs substantial computational cost due to the
necessity of constructing a graph for every point within a large-scale point
cloud. In this paper, we observe that boundary points possess more intricate
spatial structural information and develop a novel graph attention network
known as the Boundary-Aware Graph attention Network (BAGNet). On one hand,
BAGNet contains a boundary-aware graph attention layer (BAGLayer), which
employs edge vertex fusion and attention coefficients to capture features of
boundary points, reducing the computation time. On the other hand, BAGNet
employs a lightweight attention pooling layer to extract the global feature of
the point cloud to maintain model accuracy. Extensive experiments on standard
datasets demonstrate that BAGNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in point
cloud semantic segmentation with higher accuracy and less inference time.

Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法因缺乏显式监督而冻结图像编码器，忽视了其在分布偏移中的关键作用。

Method: SSAM包含软原型估计（SPE）和原型锚定图像重建（PIR），通过双阶段学习动态优化编码器。

Result: 实验表明SSAM显著优于现有方法，且计算高效、架构无关。

Conclusion: SSAM通过动态优化图像编码器，有效解决了测试时适应中的分布偏移问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Test-time adaption (TTA) has witnessed important progress in recent years,
the prevailing methods typically first encode the image and the text and design
strategies to model the association between them. Meanwhile, the image encoder
is usually frozen due to the absence of explicit supervision in TTA scenarios.
We identify a critical limitation in this paradigm: While test-time images
often exhibit distribution shifts from training data, existing methods
persistently freeze the image encoder due to the absence of explicit
supervision during adaptation. This practice overlooks the image encoder's
crucial role in bridging distribution shift between training and test. To
address this challenge, we propose SSAM (Self-Supervised Association Modeling),
a new TTA framework that enables dynamic encoder refinement through dual-phase
association learning. Our method operates via two synergistic components: 1)
Soft Prototype Estimation (SPE), which estimates probabilistic category
associations to guide feature space reorganization, and 2) Prototype-anchored
Image Reconstruction (PIR), enforcing encoder stability through
cluster-conditional image feature reconstruction. Comprehensive experiments
across diverse baseline methods and benchmarks demonstrate that SSAM can
surpass state-of-the-art TTA baselines by a clear margin while maintaining
computational efficiency. The framework's architecture-agnostic design and
minimal hyperparameter dependence further enhance its practical applicability.

Abstract: The Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) has been successfully applied to
text-to-image diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion (SD) 1.5. However,
vanilla DMD suffers from convergence difficulties on large-scale flow-based
text-to-image models, such as SD 3.5 and FLUX. In this paper, we first analyze
the issues when applying vanilla DMD on large-scale models. Then, to overcome
the scalability challenge, we propose implicit distribution alignment (IDA) to
regularize the distance between the generator and fake distribution.
Furthermore, we propose intra-segment guidance (ISG) to relocate the timestep
importance distribution from the teacher model. With IDA alone, DMD converges
for SD 3.5; employing both IDA and ISG, DMD converges for SD 3.5 and FLUX.1
dev. Along with other improvements such as scaled up discriminator models, our
final model, dubbed \textbf{SenseFlow}, achieves superior performance in
distillation for both diffusion based text-to-image models such as SDXL, and
flow-matching models such as SD 3.5 Large and FLUX. The source code will be

Abstract: Photomechanics is a crucial branch of solid mechanics. The localization of
point targets constitutes a fundamental problem in optical experimental
mechanics, with extensive applications in various missions of UAVs. Localizing
moving targets is crucial for analyzing their motion characteristics and
dynamic properties. Reconstructing the trajectories of points from asynchronous
cameras is a significant challenge. It encompasses two coupled sub-problems:
trajectory reconstruction and camera synchronization. Present methods typically
address only one of these sub-problems individually. This paper proposes a 3D
trajectory reconstruction method for point targets based on asynchronous
cameras, simultaneously solving both sub-problems. Firstly, we extend the
trajectory intersection method to asynchronous cameras to resolve the
limitation of traditional triangulation that requires camera synchronization.
Secondly, we develop models for camera temporal information and target motion,
based on imaging mechanisms and target dynamics characteristics. The parameters
are optimized simultaneously to achieve trajectory reconstruction without
accurate time parameters. Thirdly, we optimize the camera rotations alongside
the camera time information and target motion parameters, using tighter and
more continuous constraints on moving points. The reconstruction accuracy is
significantly improved, especially when the camera rotations are inaccurate.
Finally, the simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the
feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. The real-world results
indicate that the proposed algorithm achieved a localization error of 112.95 m
at an observation range of 15 ~ 20 km.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有体积视频数据集缺乏真实世界生产流程中的多样内容，包括语义和低层特征，限制了模型开发和验证。

Method: 提出ViVo数据集，包含多视角RGB和深度视频对、音频数据、2D前景掩码和3D点云，并扩展了多样性定义。

Result: 通过测试三种3D重建方法和两种压缩算法，验证了数据集的挑战性和现有算法的局限性。

Conclusion: ViVo数据集为体积视频重建和压缩提供了更真实的基准，推动了相关算法的进一步发展。

Abstract: As research on neural volumetric video reconstruction and compression
flourishes, there is a need for diverse and realistic datasets, which can be
used to develop and validate reconstruction and compression models. However,
existing volumetric video datasets lack diverse content in terms of both
semantic and low-level features that are commonly present in real-world
production pipelines. In this context, we propose a new dataset, ViVo, for
VolumetrIc VideO reconstruction and compression. The dataset is faithful to
real-world volumetric video production and is the first dataset to extend the
definition of diversity to include both human-centric characteristics (skin,
hair, etc.) and dynamic visual phenomena (transparent, reflective, liquid,
etc.). Each video sequence in this database contains raw data including
fourteen multi-view RGB and depth video pairs, synchronized at 30FPS with
per-frame calibration and audio data, and their associated 2-D foreground masks
and 3-D point clouds. To demonstrate the use of this database, we have
benchmarked three state-of-the-art (SotA) 3-D reconstruction methods and two
volumetric video compression algorithms. The obtained results evidence the
challenging nature of the proposed dataset and the limitations of existing
datasets for both volumetric video reconstruction and compression tasks,
highlighting the need to develop more effective algorithms for these
applications. The database and the associated results are available at

*Yule Zhu,Ping Liu,Zhedong Zheng,Wei Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了SEED数据集和FAITH模型，用于研究基于扩散模型的渐进式面部编辑序列的跟踪与分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏针对渐进式面部编辑序列的大规模精细标注数据集，导致编辑归属和检测鲁棒性面临挑战。

Method: 构建了SEED数据集，包含90,000多张面部图像，每张图像标注了编辑序列、属性掩码和提示；提出了FAITH模型，利用高频线索增强对细微变化的敏感性。

Result: FAITH模型在SEED数据集上表现出色，展示了其在渐进式编辑跟踪中的有效性。

Conclusion: SEED为研究渐进式扩散编辑提供了挑战性资源，FAITH模型为相关任务提供了新方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently enabled precise and photorealistic facial
editing across a wide range of semantic attributes. Beyond single-step
modifications, a growing class of applications now demands the ability to
analyze and track sequences of progressive edits, such as stepwise changes to
hair, makeup, or accessories. However, sequential editing introduces
significant challenges in edit attribution and detection robustness, further
complicated by the lack of large-scale, finely annotated benchmarks tailored
explicitly for this task. We introduce SEED, a large-scale Sequentially Edited
facE Dataset constructed via state-of-the-art diffusion models. SEED contains
over 90,000 facial images with one to four sequential attribute modifications,
generated using diverse diffusion-based editing pipelines (LEdits, SDXL, SD3).
Each image is annotated with detailed edit sequences, attribute masks, and
prompts, facilitating research on sequential edit tracking, visual provenance
analysis, and manipulation robustness assessment. To benchmark this task, we
propose FAITH, a frequency-aware transformer-based model that incorporates
high-frequency cues to enhance sensitivity to subtle sequential changes.
Comprehensive experiments, including systematic comparisons of multiple
frequency-domain methods, demonstrate the effectiveness of FAITH and the unique
challenges posed by SEED. SEED offers a challenging and flexible resource for
studying progressive diffusion-based edits at scale. Dataset and code will be
publicly released at: https://github.com/Zeus1037/SEED.

TL;DR: 论文提出CReFT-CAD方法，通过两阶段微调提升CAD中的正交投影推理能力，并发布TriView2CAD基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在CAD工作流中存在尺寸不精确和参数化编辑能力不足的问题，而现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在复杂推理任务中表现不佳。

Method: CReFT-CAD采用两阶段微调：第一阶段通过课程驱动的强化学习逐步构建推理能力，第二阶段通过监督微调优化指令跟随和语义提取。

Result: CReFT-CAD显著提升了正交投影推理的准确性和分布外泛化能力，并在真实场景中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CReFT-CAD为CAD推理研究提供了新思路，TriView2CAD数据集的发布将推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a pivotal role in industrial manufacturing.
Orthographic projection reasoning underpins the entire CAD workflow,
encompassing design, manufacturing, and simulation. However, prevailing
deep-learning approaches employ standard 3D reconstruction pipelines as an
alternative, which often introduce imprecise dimensions and limit the
parametric editability required for CAD workflows. Recently, some researchers
adopt vision-language models (VLMs), particularly supervised fine-tuning (SFT),
to tackle CAD-related challenges. SFT shows promise but often devolves into
pattern memorization, yielding poor out-of-distribution performance on complex
reasoning tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce CReFT-CAD, a two-stage
fine-tuning paradigm that first employs a curriculum-driven reinforcement
learning stage with difficulty-aware rewards to build reasoning ability
steadily, and then applies supervised post-tuning to hone instruction following
and semantic extraction. Complementing this, we release TriView2CAD, the first
large-scale, open-source benchmark for orthographic projection reasoning,
comprising 200,000 synthetic and 3,000 real-world orthographic projections with
precise dimension annotations and six interoperable data modalities. We
benchmark leading VLMs on orthographic projection reasoning and demonstrate
that CReFT-CAD substantially improves reasoning accuracy and
out-of-distribution generalizability in real-world scenarios, offering valuable
insights for advancing CAD reasoning research.

Motivation: 高动态、高速目标运动的机械特性测量在工业中至关重要，但现有方法存在动态范围有限、观测不连续和高成本等挑战。

Method: 利用事件时空分布的单调性提取目标前缘特征，消除拖尾效应；通过重投影误差关联事件与目标轨迹；采用目标速度衰减模型拟合数据。

Result: 在轻气枪碎片测试中，与电磁测速仪相比，测量偏差为4.47%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多视角数据联合计算，实现了高精度运动测量，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: The characterization of mechanical properties for high-dynamic, high-velocity
target motion is essential in industries. It provides crucial data for
validating weapon systems and precision manufacturing processes etc. However,
existing measurement methods face challenges such as limited dynamic range,
discontinuous observations, and high costs. This paper presents a new approach
leveraging an event-based multi-view photogrammetric system, which aims to
address the aforementioned challenges. First, the monotonicity in the
spatiotemporal distribution of events is leveraged to extract the target's
leading-edge features, eliminating the tailing effect that complicates motion
measurements. Then, reprojection error is used to associate events with the
target's trajectory, providing more data than traditional intersection methods.
Finally, a target velocity decay model is employed to fit the data, enabling
accurate motion measurements via ours multi-view data joint computation. In a
light gas gun fragment test, the proposed method showed a measurement deviation
of 4.47% compared to the electromagnetic speedometer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有S2I方法无法同时保证语义和形状一致性，且在多实体场景中容易发生属性泄漏。

Method: Seg2Any将分割掩码条件解耦为区域语义和高频形状组件，并通过多模态注意力引入形状条件，同时使用属性隔离注意力掩码机制防止属性泄漏。

Result: Seg2Any在开放集和封闭集S2I基准测试中均达到最先进性能，尤其在实体细粒度空间和属性控制方面表现突出。

Conclusion: Seg2Any通过创新的解耦和隔离机制，显著提升了S2I生成的语义和形状一致性，为复杂场景的图像生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion models, top-tier text-to-image (T2I)
models still struggle to achieve precise spatial layout control, i.e.
accurately generating entities with specified attributes and locations.
Segmentation-mask-to-image (S2I) generation has emerged as a promising solution
by incorporating pixel-level spatial guidance and regional text prompts.
However, existing S2I methods fail to simultaneously ensure semantic
consistency and shape consistency. To address these challenges, we propose
Seg2Any, a novel S2I framework built upon advanced multimodal diffusion
transformers (e.g. FLUX). First, to achieve both semantic and shape
consistency, we decouple segmentation mask conditions into regional semantic
and high-frequency shape components. The regional semantic condition is
introduced by a Semantic Alignment Attention Mask, ensuring that generated
entities adhere to their assigned text prompts. The high-frequency shape
condition, representing entity boundaries, is encoded as an Entity Contour Map
and then introduced as an additional modality via multi-modal attention to
guide image spatial structure. Second, to prevent attribute leakage across
entities in multi-entity scenarios, we introduce an Attribute Isolation
Attention Mask mechanism, which constrains each entity's image tokens to attend
exclusively to themselves during image self-attention. To support open-set S2I
generation, we construct SACap-1M, a large-scale dataset containing 1 million
images with 5.9 million segmented entities and detailed regional captions,
along with a SACap-Eval benchmark for comprehensive S2I evaluation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Seg2Any achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both open-set and closed-set S2I benchmarks, particularly in fine-grained
spatial and attribute control of entities.

Method: 数据集包含15种无纹理、金属且对称的物体，通过高精度工业相机和商业相机采集RGB、灰度和深度图像，并结合合成数据。标注流程采用抗反射喷雾、多视角深度融合和半自动标注。

Abstract: We introduce XYZ-IBD, a bin-picking dataset for 6D pose estimation that
captures real-world industrial complexity, including challenging object
geometries, reflective materials, severe occlusions, and dense clutter. The
dataset reflects authentic robotic manipulation scenarios with
millimeter-accurate annotations. Unlike existing datasets that primarily focus
on household objects, which approach saturation,XYZ-IBD represents the unsolved
realistic industrial conditions. The dataset features 15 texture-less,
metallic, and mostly symmetrical objects of varying shapes and sizes. These
objects are heavily occluded and randomly arranged in bins with high density,
replicating the challenges of real-world bin-picking. XYZ-IBD was collected
using two high-precision industrial cameras and one commercially available
camera, providing RGB, grayscale, and depth images. It contains 75 multi-view
real-world scenes, along with a large-scale synthetic dataset rendered under
simulated bin-picking conditions. We employ a meticulous annotation pipeline
that includes anti-reflection spray, multi-view depth fusion, and
semi-automatic annotation, achieving millimeter-level pose labeling accuracy
required for industrial manipulation. Quantification in simulated environments
confirms the reliability of the ground-truth annotations. We benchmark
state-of-the-art methods on 2D detection, 6D pose estimation, and depth
estimation tasks on our dataset, revealing significant performance degradation
in our setups compared to current academic household benchmarks. By capturing
the complexity of real-world bin-picking scenarios, XYZ-IBD introduces more
realistic and challenging problems for future research. The dataset and
benchmark are publicly available at https://xyz-ibd.github.io/XYZ-IBD/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要生成单张地面图像，依赖辅助输入且无法保证时间一致性，限制了在仿真、自动驾驶等领域的应用。

Method: 采用紧凑的三平面表示编码场景几何，结合基于射线的像素注意力机制和极线约束时间注意力模块，确保几何和时间一致性。

Result: 实验表明，SatDreamer360在保真度、连贯性和几何对齐方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SatDreamer360为跨视角视频生成提供了高效解决方案，并在新数据集VIGOR++上验证了其性能。

Abstract: Generating continuous ground-level video from satellite imagery is a
challenging task with significant potential for applications in simulation,
autonomous navigation, and digital twin cities. Existing approaches primarily
focus on synthesizing individual ground-view images, often relying on auxiliary
inputs like height maps or handcrafted projections, and fall short in producing
temporally consistent sequences. In this paper, we propose {SatDreamer360}, a
novel framework that generates geometrically and temporally consistent
ground-view video from a single satellite image and a predefined trajectory. To
bridge the large viewpoint gap, we introduce a compact tri-plane representation
that encodes scene geometry directly from the satellite image. A ray-based
pixel attention mechanism retrieves view-dependent features from the tri-plane,
enabling accurate cross-view correspondence without requiring additional
geometric priors. To ensure multi-frame consistency, we propose an
epipolar-constrained temporal attention module that aligns features across
frames using the known relative poses along the trajectory. To support
evaluation, we introduce {VIGOR++}, a large-scale dataset for cross-view video
generation, with dense trajectory annotations and high-quality ground-view
sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SatDreamer360 achieves
superior performance in fidelity, coherence, and geometric alignment across
diverse urban scenes.

Motivation: 现有方法在少量参考图像下容易过拟合，导致生成图像与文本提示不一致，尤其是在复杂或风格化提示下表现不佳。

Method: 提出并行重缩放技术，将一致性引导信号分解为与分类器无关引导（CFG）平行和正交的分量，并对平行分量进行重缩放。

Conclusion: 并行重缩放技术能够在不增加额外数据或标注的情况下，实现更稳定和准确的个性化生成。

Abstract: Personalizing diffusion models to specific users or concepts remains
challenging, particularly when only a few reference images are available.
Existing methods such as DreamBooth and Textual Inversion often overfit to
limited data, causing misalignment between generated images and text prompts
when attempting to balance identity fidelity with prompt adherence. While
Direct Consistency Optimization (DCO) with its consistency-guided sampling
partially alleviates this issue, it still struggles with complex or stylized
prompts. In this paper, we propose a parallel rescaling technique for
personalized diffusion models. Our approach explicitly decomposes the
consistency guidance signal into parallel and orthogonal components relative to
classifier free guidance (CFG). By rescaling the parallel component, we
minimize disruptive interference with CFG while preserving the subject's
identity. Unlike prior personalization methods, our technique does not require
additional training data or expensive annotations. Extensive experiments show
improved prompt alignment and visual fidelity compared to baseline methods,
even on challenging stylized prompts. These findings highlight the potential of
parallel rescaled guidance to yield more stable and accurate personalization
for diverse user inputs.

Motivation: 长尾数据分布不平衡导致深度学习模型偏向头部类别，尾部类别识别精度低。

Method: 提出PI-H2T方法，包括PIF优化表示空间和H2TF调整分类器，通过头部到尾部特征融合。

Result: 实验证明PI-H2T有效优化表示空间和决策边界，提升尾部类别多样性。

Conclusion: PI-H2T是一种即插即用的方法，可无缝集成现有模型，显著提升性能。

Abstract: The imbalanced distribution of long-tailed data presents a significant
challenge for deep learning models, causing them to prioritize head classes
while neglecting tail classes. Two key factors contributing to low recognition
accuracy are the deformed representation space and a biased classifier,
stemming from insufficient semantic information in tail classes. To address
these issues, we propose permutation-invariant and head-to-tail feature fusion
(PI-H2T), a highly adaptable method. PI-H2T enhances the representation space
through permutation-invariant representation fusion (PIF), yielding more
clustered features and automatic class margins. Additionally, it adjusts the
biased classifier by transferring semantic information from head to tail
classes via head-to-tail fusion (H2TF), improving tail class diversity.
Theoretical analysis and experiments show that PI-H2T optimizes both the
representation space and decision boundaries. Its plug-and-play design ensures
seamless integration into existing methods, providing a straightforward path to
further performance improvements. Extensive experiments on long-tailed
benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of PI-H2T.

Motivation: 扩展文本到图像生成技术至3D医学影像（如CT）面临高维度、解剖复杂性及缺乏有效视觉语言对齐框架的挑战。

Method: 采用双编码器CLIP风格模型和预训练的3D VAE，结合潜在扩散模型，实现高效的3D去噪扩散。

Conclusion: 研究表明，特定模态的视觉语言对齐是高质量3D医学图像生成的关键，该方法为数据增强、医学教育和临床模拟提供了新途径。

Abstract: Objective: While recent advances in text-conditioned generative models have
enabled the synthesis of realistic medical images, progress has been largely
confined to 2D modalities such as chest X-rays. Extending text-to-image
generation to volumetric Computed Tomography (CT) remains a significant
challenge, due to its high dimensionality, anatomical complexity, and the
absence of robust frameworks that align vision-language data in 3D medical
imaging. Methods: We introduce a novel architecture for Text-to-CT generation
that combines a latent diffusion model with a 3D contrastive vision-language
pretraining scheme. Our approach leverages a dual-encoder CLIP-style model
trained on paired CT volumes and radiology reports to establish a shared
embedding space, which serves as the conditioning input for generation. CT
volumes are compressed into a low-dimensional latent space via a pretrained
volumetric VAE, enabling efficient 3D denoising diffusion without requiring
external super-resolution stages. Results: We evaluate our method on the
CT-RATE dataset and conduct a comprehensive assessment of image fidelity,
clinical relevance, and semantic alignment. Our model achieves competitive
performance across all tasks, significantly outperforming prior baselines for
text-to-CT generation. Moreover, we demonstrate that CT scans synthesized by
our framework can effectively augment real data, improving downstream
diagnostic performance. Conclusion: Our results show that modality-specific
vision-language alignment is a key component for high-quality 3D medical image
generation. By integrating contrastive pretraining and volumetric diffusion,
our method offers a scalable and controllable solution for synthesizing
clinically meaningful CT volumes from text, paving the way for new applications
in data augmentation, medical education, and automated clinical simulation.

Motivation: AIGC的快速发展引发了对知识产权保护和内容追溯的担忧，现有后生成水印方法存在计算开销大且难以平衡水印提取与视频质量的问题。

Method: VIDSIG通过部分微调潜在解码器，结合Perturbation-Aware Suppression（PAS）和轻量级时间对齐模块，实现水印的隐式集成和时间一致性。

Result: 实验表明VIDSIG在水印提取、视觉质量和生成效率上表现最佳，并对空间和时间篡改具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VIDSIG是一种实用且高效的视频生成水印方法，适用于实际场景。

Abstract: The rapid development of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has
led to significant progress in video generation but also raises serious
concerns about intellectual property protection and reliable content tracing.
Watermarking is a widely adopted solution to this issue, but existing methods
for video generation mainly follow a post-generation paradigm, which introduces
additional computational overhead and often fails to effectively balance the
trade-off between video quality and watermark extraction. To address these
issues, we propose Video Signature (VIDSIG), an in-generation watermarking
method for latent video diffusion models, which enables implicit and adaptive
watermark integration during generation. Specifically, we achieve this by
partially fine-tuning the latent decoder, where Perturbation-Aware Suppression
(PAS) pre-identifies and freezes perceptually sensitive layers to preserve
visual quality. Beyond spatial fidelity, we further enhance temporal
consistency by introducing a lightweight Temporal Alignment module that guides
the decoder to generate coherent frame sequences during fine-tuning.
Experimental results show that VIDSIG achieves the best overall performance in
watermark extraction, visual quality, and generation efficiency. It also
demonstrates strong robustness against both spatial and temporal tampering,
highlighting its practicality in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Image classifiers, such as those used for autonomous vehicle navigation, are
largely known to be susceptible to adversarial attacks that target the input
image set. There is extensive discussion on adversarial attacks including
perturbations that alter the input images to cause malicious misclassifications
without perceivable modification. This work proposes a countermeasure for such
attacks by adjusting the weights and classes of pretrained vision transformers
with a low-rank adaptation to become more robust against adversarial attacks
and allow for scalable fine-tuning without retraining.

Abstract: Robust scene segmentation and keyframe extraction are essential preprocessing
steps in video understanding pipelines, supporting tasks such as indexing,
summarization, and semantic retrieval. However, existing methods often lack
generalizability across diverse video types and durations. We present a
unified, adaptive framework for automatic scene detection and keyframe
selection that handles formats ranging from short-form media to long-form
films, archival content, and surveillance footage. Our system dynamically
selects segmentation policies based on video length: adaptive thresholding for
short videos, hybrid strategies for mid-length ones, and interval-based
splitting for extended recordings. This ensures consistent granularity and
efficient processing across domains. For keyframe selection, we employ a
lightweight module that scores sampled frames using a composite metric of
sharpness, luminance, and temporal spread, avoiding complex saliency models
while ensuring visual relevance. Designed for high-throughput workflows, the
system is deployed in a commercial video analysis platform and has processed
content from media, education, research, and security domains. It offers a
scalable and interpretable solution suitable for downstream applications such
as UI previews, embedding pipelines, and content filtering. We discuss
practical implementation details and outline future enhancements, including
audio-aware segmentation and reinforcement-learned frame scoring.

Abstract: Vector-Quantized Generative Models (VQGMs) have emerged as powerful tools for
image generation. However, the key component of VQGMs -- the codebook of
discrete tokens -- is still not well understood, e.g., which tokens are
critical to generate an image of a certain concept? This paper introduces
Concept-Oriented Token Explanation (CORTEX), a novel approach for interpreting
VQGMs by identifying concept-specific token combinations. Our framework employs
two methods: (1) a sample-level explanation method that analyzes token
importance scores in individual images, and (2) a codebook-level explanation
method that explores the entire codebook to find globally relevant tokens.
Experimental results demonstrate CORTEX's efficacy in providing clear
explanations of token usage in the generative process, outperforming baselines
across multiple pretrained VQGMs. Besides enhancing VQGMs transparency, CORTEX
is useful in applications such as targeted image editing and shortcut feature
detection. Our code is available at https://github.com/YangTianze009/CORTEX.

Result: Fovea Stacking在扩展景深成像中优于传统方法，并可结合目标检测或眼动追踪实现动态调整，适用于实时视频应用。

Conclusion: Fovea Stacking为小型化高性能成像系统提供了有效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The desire for cameras with smaller form factors has recently lead to a push
for exploring computational imaging systems with reduced optical complexity
such as a smaller number of lens elements. Unfortunately such simplified
optical systems usually suffer from severe aberrations, especially in off-axis
regions, which can be difficult to correct purely in software.
  In this paper we introduce Fovea Stacking, a new type of imaging system that
utilizes emerging dynamic optical components called deformable phase plates
(DPPs) for localized aberration correction anywhere on the image sensor. By
optimizing DPP deformations through a differentiable optical model, off-axis
aberrations are corrected locally, producing a foveated image with enhanced
sharpness at the fixation point - analogous to the eye's fovea. Stacking
multiple such foveated images, each with a different fixation point, yields a
composite image free from aberrations. To efficiently cover the entire field of
view, we propose joint optimization of DPP deformations under imaging budget
constraints. Due to the DPP device's non-linear behavior, we introduce a neural
network-based control model for improved alignment between simulation-hardware
performance.
  We further demonstrated that for extended depth-of-field imaging, fovea
stacking outperforms traditional focus stacking in image quality. By
integrating object detection or eye-tracking, the system can dynamically adjust
the lens to track the object of interest-enabling real-time foveated video
suitable for downstream applications such as surveillance or foveated virtual
reality displays.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 现代视觉模型（如ViTs和ConvNeXt）在自监督训练（如MAE）下表现出类似Gestalt原则的行为，但分类微调会削弱这种能力。DiSRT测试表明，自监督模型对全局结构的敏感性优于监督模型甚至人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代视觉模型是否遵循Gestalt原则（如闭合、接近性等），并探索其训练条件。

Method: 使用Masked Autoencoding（MAE）训练Vision Transformers（ViTs）和ConvNeXt，并通过DiSRT测试评估模型对全局结构的敏感性。

Result: 自监督模型（如MAE、CLIP）在DiSRT测试中表现优于监督模型，甚至超过人类。分类微调会降低Gestalt敏感性，但Top-K激活稀疏机制可恢复。

Conclusion: 自监督训练能促进Gestalt-like感知，DiSRT可作为评估模型全局结构敏感性的工具。

Abstract: Human vision organizes local cues into coherent global forms using Gestalt
principles like closure, proximity, and figure-ground assignment -- functions
reliant on global spatial structure. We investigate whether modern vision
models show similar behaviors, and under what training conditions these emerge.
We find that Vision Transformers (ViTs) trained with Masked Autoencoding (MAE)
exhibit activation patterns consistent with Gestalt laws, including illusory
contour completion, convexity preference, and dynamic figure-ground
segregation. To probe the computational basis, we hypothesize that modeling
global dependencies is necessary for Gestalt-like organization. We introduce
the Distorted Spatial Relationship Testbench (DiSRT), which evaluates
sensitivity to global spatial perturbations while preserving local textures.
Using DiSRT, we show that self-supervised models (e.g., MAE, CLIP) outperform
supervised baselines and sometimes even exceed human performance. ConvNeXt
models trained with MAE also exhibit Gestalt-compatible representations,
suggesting such sensitivity can arise without attention architectures. However,
classification finetuning degrades this ability. Inspired by biological vision,
we show that a Top-K activation sparsity mechanism can restore global
sensitivity. Our findings identify training conditions that promote or suppress
Gestalt-like perception and establish DiSRT as a diagnostic for global
structure sensitivity across models.

Result: 揭示了语义先验对修复成功的影响，支持上下文分类器训练、对象预测任务和上下文增强的伪造检测。

Conclusion: COinCO为计算机视觉和图像取证提供了上下文变化的测试平台，推动了上下文感知研究。

Abstract: We present Common Inpainted Objects In-N-Out of Context (COinCO), a novel
dataset addressing the scarcity of out-of-context examples in existing vision
datasets. By systematically replacing objects in COCO images through
diffusion-based inpainting, we create 97,722 unique images featuring both
contextually coherent and inconsistent scenes, enabling effective context
learning. Each inpainted object is meticulously verified and categorized as in-
or out-of-context through a multimodal large language model assessment. Our
analysis reveals significant patterns in semantic priors that influence
inpainting success across object categories. We demonstrate three key tasks
enabled by COinCO: (1) training context classifiers that effectively determine
whether existing objects belong in their context; (2) a novel
Objects-from-Context prediction task that determines which new objects
naturally belong in given scenes at both instance and clique levels, and (3)
context-enhanced fake detection on state-of-the-art methods without
fine-tuning. COinCO provides a controlled testbed with contextual variations,
establishing a foundation for advancing context-aware visual understanding in
computer vision and image forensics. Our code and data are at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业对全球粮食安全至关重要，但作物易受病害影响。传统CNN模型计算需求高，难以在资源受限设备上部署。

Method: 采用权重剪枝减少模型大小和计算负载，知识蒸馏提升小模型性能，并融合DenseNet与Involutional Layers以高效捕捉空间特征。

Result: 压缩后的ResNet50在PlantVillage和PaddyLeaf数据集上分别达到99.55%和98.99%准确率；DenseNet模型参数极少但性能优异；混合模型表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该方法支持在能效设备上实时部署，促进精准农业和可持续种植。

Abstract: Agriculture is vital for global food security, but crops are vulnerable to
diseases that impact yield and quality. While Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) accurately classify plant diseases using leaf images, their high
computational demands hinder their deployment in resource-constrained settings
such as smartphones, edge devices, and real-time monitoring systems. This study
proposes a two-step model compression approach integrating Weight Pruning and
Knowledge Distillation, along with the hybridization of DenseNet with
Involutional Layers. Pruning reduces model size and computational load, while
distillation improves the smaller student models performance by transferring
knowledge from a larger teacher network. The hybridization enhances the models
ability to capture spatial features efficiently. These compressed models are
suitable for real-time applications, promoting precision agriculture through
rapid disease identification and crop management. The results demonstrate
ResNet50s superior performance post-compression, achieving 99.55% and 98.99%
accuracy on the PlantVillage and PaddyLeaf datasets, respectively. The
DenseNet-based model, optimized for efficiency, recorded 99.21% and 93.96%
accuracy with a minimal parameter count. Furthermore, the hybrid model achieved
98.87% and 97.10% accuracy, supporting the practical deployment of
energy-efficient devices for timely disease intervention and sustainable

Motivation: 传统3D场景设计复杂且依赖高质量3D数据，而文本到3D生成方法受限于数据不足。利用文本到图像模型的多样性和可靠性，可以间接生成3D场景。

Method: 首先生成2D图像，从中提取对象形状和外观信息，再结合几何、位置和姿态信息组装成3D场景。

Conclusion: ArtiScene通过2D中介图像实现了高效、多样化的3D场景生成，无需额外训练，性能卓越。

Abstract: Designing 3D scenes is traditionally a challenging task that demands both
artistic expertise and proficiency with complex software. Recent advances in
text-to-3D generation have greatly simplified this process by letting users
create scenes based on simple text descriptions. However, as these methods
generally require extra training or in-context learning, their performance is
often hindered by the limited availability of high-quality 3D data. In
contrast, modern text-to-image models learned from web-scale images can
generate scenes with diverse, reliable spatial layouts and consistent, visually
appealing styles. Our key insight is that instead of learning directly from 3D
scenes, we can leverage generated 2D images as an intermediary to guide 3D
synthesis. In light of this, we introduce ArtiScene, a training-free automated
pipeline for scene design that integrates the flexibility of free-form
text-to-image generation with the diversity and reliability of 2D intermediary
layouts.
  First, we generate 2D images from a scene description, then extract the shape
and appearance of objects to create 3D models. These models are assembled into
the final scene using geometry, position, and pose information derived from the
same intermediary image. Being generalizable to a wide range of scenes and
styles, ArtiScene outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks by a large margin in
layout and aesthetic quality by quantitative metrics. It also averages a 74.89%
winning rate in extensive user studies and 95.07% in GPT-4o evaluation. Project

Abstract: Video processing for real-time analytics in resource-constrained environments
presents a significant challenge in balancing energy consumption and video
semantics. This paper addresses the problem of energy-efficient video
processing by proposing a system that dynamically optimizes processing
configurations to minimize energy usage on the edge, while preserving essential
video features for deep learning inference. We first gather an extensive
offline profile of various configurations consisting of device CPU frequencies,
frame filtering features, difference thresholds, and video bitrates, to
establish apriori knowledge of their impact on energy consumption and inference
accuracy. Leveraging this insight, we introduce an online system that employs
multi-objective Bayesian optimization to intelligently explore and adapt
configurations in real time. Our approach continuously refines processing
settings to meet a target inference accuracy with minimal edge device energy
expenditure. Experimental results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in
reducing video processing energy use while maintaining high analytical
performance, offering a practical solution for smart devices and edge computing
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于运动的多目标跟踪方法依赖IoU进行目标关联，在遮挡或视觉相似物体场景下效果不佳，需引入3D特征提升性能。

Method: 采用零样本深度估计，将深度作为独立特征引入关联过程，并提出分层对齐分数（结合粗粒度边界框重叠和细粒度像素对齐）优化关联。

Result: 在无需训练或微调的情况下，框架在挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 首次将3D特征（单目深度）作为独立决策矩阵引入关联步骤，显著提升了多目标跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current motion-based multiple object tracking (MOT) approaches rely heavily
on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for object association. Without using 3D
features, they are ineffective in scenarios with occlusions or visually similar
objects. To address this, our paper presents a novel depth-aware framework for
MOT. We estimate depth using a zero-shot approach and incorporate it as an
independent feature in the association process. Additionally, we introduce a
Hierarchical Alignment Score that refines IoU by integrating both coarse
bounding box overlap and fine-grained (pixel-level) alignment to improve
association accuracy without requiring additional learnable parameters. To our
knowledge, this is the first MOT framework to incorporate 3D features
(monocular depth) as an independent decision matrix in the association step.
Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks
without any training nor fine-tuning. The code is available at

Motivation: 医学专业人员，尤其是培训中的医生，依赖视觉参考资料进行准确诊断和模式识别，但现有资源缺乏多样性和可访问性。

Method: 使用预训练的稳定扩散模型，通过LoRA在PathMNIST数据集上进行微调，生成医学图像，并通过ResNet-18分类模型验证图像准确性。

Result: 生成模型的最佳版本F1得分为0.6727，部分组织类型分类完美，系统在生成和分类部分均表现出高准确性。

Conclusion: 该系统为合成特定领域医学图像提供了可靠方法，具有诊断支持和临床教育的潜在应用价值，未来将优化提示准确性并扩展至其他医学影像领域。

Abstract: Medical professionals, especially those in training, often depend on visual
reference materials to support an accurate diagnosis and develop pattern
recognition skills. However, existing resources may lack the diversity and
accessibility needed for broad and effective clinical learning. This paper
presents a system designed to generate realistic medical images from textual
descriptions and validate their accuracy through a classification model. A
pretrained stable diffusion model was fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) on the PathMNIST dataset, consisting of nine colorectal histopathology
tissue types. The generative model was trained multiple times using different
training parameter configurations, guided by domain-specific prompts to capture
meaningful features. To ensure quality control, a ResNet-18 classification
model was trained on the same dataset, achieving 99.76% accuracy in detecting
the correct label of a colorectal histopathological medical image. Generated
images were then filtered using the trained classifier and an iterative
process, where inaccurate outputs were discarded and regenerated until they
were correctly classified. The highest performing version of the generative
model from experimentation achieved an F1 score of 0.6727, with precision and
recall scores of 0.6817 and 0.7111, respectively. Some types of tissue, such as
adipose tissue and lymphocytes, reached perfect classification scores, while
others proved more challenging due to structural complexity. The
self-validating approach created demonstrates a reliable method for
synthesizing domain-specific medical images because of high accuracy in both
the generation and classification portions of the system, with potential
applications in both diagnostic support and clinical education. Future work
includes improving prompt-specific accuracy and extending the system to other
areas of medical imaging.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-VLMs忽视模态不对齐问题，导致临床场景中不可靠的响应，需解决数据生成和偏好优化挑战。

Method: HSCR利用Med-VLMs生成不偏好响应，通过视觉标记丢弃分析对齐奖励函数，并采用多级偏好优化策略。

Result: 实验表明HSCR在零样本性能、模态对齐和可信度上显著提升，仅需2000训练样本。

Conclusion: HSCR有效解决Med-VLMs对齐问题，提升模型在医疗任务中的表现和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs) have achieved success across
various tasks, yet most existing methods overlook the modality misalignment
issue that can lead to untrustworthy responses in clinical settings. In this
paper, we propose Hierarchical Self-Contrastive Rewarding (HSCR), a novel
approach that addresses two critical challenges in Med-VLM alignment: 1)
Cost-effective generation of high-quality preference data; 2) Capturing nuanced
and context-aware preferences for improved alignment. HSCR first leverages the
inherent capability of Med-VLMs to generate dispreferred responses with higher
sampling probability. By analyzing output logit shifts after visual token
dropout, we identify modality-coupled tokens that induce misalignment and
derive an implicit alignment reward function. This function guides token
replacement with hallucinated ones during decoding, producing high-quality
dispreferred data. Furthermore, HSCR introduces a multi-level preference
optimization strategy, which extends beyond traditional adjacent-level
optimization by incorporating nuanced implicit preferences, leveraging relative
quality in dispreferred data to capture subtle alignment cues for more precise
and context-aware optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple medical
tasks, including Med-VQA, medical image captioning and instruction following,
demonstrate that HSCR not only enhances zero-shot performance but also
significantly improves modality alignment and trustworthiness with just 2,000
training entries.

Result: 在完整和不完整表格输入下，TIME均优于基线方法，展示了其实际应用价值。

Conclusion: TIME在多模态学习中表现出色，尤其在医学领域具有实用潜力。

Abstract: Tabular-image multimodal learning, which integrates structured tabular data
with imaging data, holds great promise for a variety of tasks, especially in
medical applications. Yet, two key challenges remain: (1) the lack of a
standardized, pretrained representation for tabular data, as is commonly
available in vision and language domains; and (2) the difficulty of handling
missing values in the tabular modality, which are common in real-world medical
datasets. To address these issues, we propose the TabPFN-Integrated Multimodal
Engine (TIME), a novel multimodal framework that builds on the recently
introduced tabular foundation model, TabPFN. TIME leverages TabPFN as a frozen
tabular encoder to generate robust, strong embeddings that are naturally
resilient to missing data, and combines them with image features from
pretrained vision backbones. We explore a range of fusion strategies and
tabular encoders, and evaluate our approach on both natural and medical
datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TIME consistently outperforms
competitive baselines across both complete and incomplete tabular inputs,
underscoring its practical value in real-world multimodal learning scenarios.

Method: L3A包含伪标签模块（PL）和加权分析分类器（WAC），分别解决标签缺失和类别不平衡问题。

Result: 在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上，L3A表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: L3A是一种无需存储历史样本的有效方法，成功解决了MLCIL中的关键问题。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes
continually without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Multi-label CIL
(MLCIL) extends CIL to a real-world scenario where each sample may belong to
multiple classes, introducing several challenges: label absence, which leads to
incomplete historical information due to missing labels, and class imbalance,
which results in the model bias toward majority classes. To address these
challenges, we propose Label-Augmented Analytic Adaptation (L3A), an
exemplar-free approach without storing past samples. L3A integrates two key
modules. The pseudo-label (PL) module implements label augmentation by
generating pseudo-labels for current phase samples, addressing the label
absence problem. The weighted analytic classifier (WAC) derives a closed-form
solution for neural networks. It introduces sample-specific weights to
adaptively balance the class contribution and mitigate class imbalance.
Experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that L3A outperforms
existing methods in MLCIL tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving remarkable performance in face
restoration. However, the heavy computations of diffusion models make it
difficult to deploy them on devices like smartphones. In this work, we propose
QuantFace, a novel low-bit quantization for one-step diffusion face restoration
models, where the full-precision (\ie, 32-bit) weights and activations are
quantized to 4$\sim$6-bit. We first analyze the data distribution within
activations and find that they are highly variant. To preserve the original
data information, we employ rotation-scaling channel balancing. Furthermore, we
propose Quantization-Distillation Low-Rank Adaptation (QD-LoRA) that jointly
optimizes for quantization and distillation performance. Finally, we propose an
adaptive bit-width allocation strategy. We formulate such a strategy as an
integer programming problem, which combines quantization error and perceptual
metrics to find a satisfactory resource allocation. Extensive experiments on
the synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
QuantFace under 6-bit and 4-bit. QuantFace achieves significant advantages over
recent leading low-bit quantization methods for face restoration. The code is

Abstract: The generation and editing of audio-conditioned talking portraits guided by

In this paper, we present SkyReels-Audio, a unified framework for synthesizing
high-fidelity and temporally coherent talking portrait videos. Built upon
pretrained video diffusion transformers, our framework supports infinite-length
generation and editing, while enabling diverse and controllable conditioning
through multimodal inputs. We employ a hybrid curriculum learning strategy to
progressively align audio with facial motion, enabling fine-grained multimodal
control over long video sequences. To enhance local facial coherence, we
introduce a facial mask loss and an audio-guided classifier-free guidance
mechanism. A sliding-window denoising approach further fuses latent
representations across temporal segments, ensuring visual fidelity and temporal
consistency across extended durations and diverse identities. More importantly,
we construct a dedicated data pipeline for curating high-quality triplets
consisting of synchronized audio, video, and textual descriptions.
Comprehensive benchmark evaluations show that SkyReels-Audio achieves superior
performance in lip-sync accuracy, identity consistency, and realistic facial
dynamics, particularly under complex and challenging conditions.

Abstract: The synchrotron light source, a cutting-edge large-scale user facility,

geometric analysis to assess potential collisions with transfer learning that
enhances robustness. In addition, an interactive annotation module has been
developed to improve the adaptability to new object classes. Experiments on a

Abstract: Predicting accurate future trajectories of pedestrians is essential for
autonomous systems but remains a challenging task due to the need for
adaptability in different environments and domains. A common approach involves
collecting scenario-specific data and performing fine-tuning via
backpropagation. However, this process is often impractical on edge devices due
to constrained computational resources. To address this challenge, we introduce
TrajICL, an In-Context Learning (ICL) framework for pedestrian trajectory
prediction that enables rapid adaptation without fine-tuning on the
scenario-specific data. We propose a spatio-temporal similarity-based example
selection (STES) method that selects relevant examples from previously observed
trajectories within the same scene by identifying similar motion patterns at
corresponding locations. To further refine this selection, we introduce
prediction-guided example selection (PG-ES), which selects examples based on
both the past trajectory and the predicted future trajectory, rather than
relying solely on the past trajectory. This approach allows the model to
account for long-term dynamics when selecting examples. Finally, instead of
relying on small real-world datasets with limited scenario diversity, we train
our model on a large-scale synthetic dataset to enhance its prediction ability
by leveraging in-context examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TrajICL achieves remarkable adaptation across both in-domain and cross-domain
scenarios, outperforming even fine-tuned approaches across multiple public
benchmarks. The code will be released at

*Yue Zhou,Xinan He,KaiQing Lin,Bin Fan,Feng Ding,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前AIGC检测器在训练时使用的生成器上表现优异，但难以泛化到未见过的生成器。研究发现这是由于潜在先验偏差，检测器学习了与初始噪声向量相关的捷径而非稳健的生成伪影。为解决此问题，提出了On-Manifold Adversarial Training (OMAT)，通过优化扩散模型的初始潜在噪声生成对抗样本，保持其在生成器的输出流形上。实验表明，该方法显著提升了跨生成器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AIGC检测器在跨生成器泛化能力上表现不佳，主要原因是潜在先验偏差。研究旨在解决这一问题，提升检测器的鲁棒性和泛化性。

Method: 提出OMAT方法，通过优化扩散模型的初始潜在噪声生成对抗样本，保持其在生成器的输出流形上。使用GenImage++基准测试，并在ResNet50和CLIP基线模型上应用对抗训练。

Result: 实验表明，对抗训练的检测器显著提升了跨生成器性能，无需重新设计网络。

Conclusion: OMAT方法有效解决了潜在先验偏差问题，为未来数据集构建和检测器评估提供了重要见解，推动了更鲁棒和泛化的AIGC取证方法的发展。

Abstract: Current AIGC detectors often achieve near-perfect accuracy on images produced
by the same generator used for training but struggle to generalize to outputs
from unseen generators. We trace this failure in part to latent prior bias:
detectors learn shortcuts tied to patterns stemming from the initial noise
vector rather than learning robust generative artifacts. To address this, we
propose On-Manifold Adversarial Training (OMAT): by optimizing the initial
latent noise of diffusion models under fixed conditioning, we generate
on-manifold adversarial examples that remain on the generator's output
manifold-unlike pixel-space attacks, which introduce off-manifold perturbations
that the generator itself cannot reproduce and that can obscure the true
discriminative artifacts. To test against state-of-the-art generative models,
we introduce GenImage++, a test-only benchmark of outputs from advanced
generators (Flux.1, SD3) with extended prompts and diverse styles. We apply our
adversarial-training paradigm to ResNet50 and CLIP baselines and evaluate
across existing AIGC forensic benchmarks and recent challenge datasets.
Extensive experiments show that adversarially trained detectors significantly
improve cross-generator performance without any network redesign. Our findings
on latent-prior bias offer valuable insights for future dataset construction
and detector evaluation, guiding the development of more robust and
generalizable AIGC forensic methodologies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UEM的框架，通过PGVS模块和CAER模块解决了PRVR任务中事件边界模糊和文本-视频对齐不精确的问题，并在实验中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在部分相关视频检索（PRVR）中通常将视频分割为固定长度的片段，导致事件边界模糊，且使用平均池化计算事件表示，引入了不准确的对齐。

Method: 提出UEM框架，包含PGVS模块（基于时间和语义相似性迭代分割视频）和CAER模块（通过文本的跨注意力优化事件表示）。

Result: 在两个PRVR基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UEM框架通过明确的事件边界和精确的文本-视频对齐，显著提升了PRVR任务的性能。

Abstract: Given a text query, partially relevant video retrieval (PRVR) aims to
retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant moments, wherein event modeling
is crucial for partitioning the video into smaller temporal events that
partially correspond to the text. Previous methods typically segment videos
into a fixed number of equal-length clips, resulting in ambiguous event
boundaries. Additionally, they rely on mean pooling to compute event
representations, inevitably introducing undesired misalignment. To address
these, we propose an Uneven Event Modeling (UEM) framework for PRVR. We first
introduce the Progressive-Grouped Video Segmentation (PGVS) module, to
iteratively formulate events in light of both temporal dependencies and
semantic similarity between consecutive frames, enabling clear event
boundaries. Furthermore, we also propose the Context-Aware Event Refinement
(CAER) module to refine the event representation conditioned the text's
cross-attention. This enables event representations to focus on the most
relevant frames for a given text, facilitating more precise text-video
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on two PRVR benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于CLIP的多模态情感识别框架MER-CLIP，通过标签编码器和跨模态解码器增强情感特征表示，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态情感识别中因数据集有限导致的性能瓶颈问题。

Method: 利用CLIP架构和标签编码器，结合跨模态解码器对齐多模态特征，学习更具代表性的情感特征。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MER-CLIP通过语义信息融合和标签编码器指导，有效提升了多模态情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify human emotions by
combining data from various modalities such as language, audio, and vision.
Despite the recent advances of MER approaches, the limitations in obtaining
extensive datasets impede the improvement of performance. To mitigate this
issue, we leverage a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based
architecture and its semantic knowledge from massive datasets that aims to
enhance the discriminative multimodal representation. We propose a label
encoder-guided MER framework based on CLIP (MER-CLIP) to learn emotion-related
representations across modalities. Our approach introduces a label encoder that
treats labels as text embeddings to incorporate their semantic information,
leading to the learning of more representative emotional features. To further
exploit label semantics, we devise a cross-modal decoder that aligns each
modality to a shared embedding space by sequentially fusing modality features
based on emotion-related input from the label encoder. Finally, the label
encoder-guided prediction enables generalization across diverse labels by
embedding their semantic information as well as word labels. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods on
the benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑行业设备利用率低导致成本增加和项目延误，需实时监控设备活动以提升效率。

Method: 框架包含目标检测、跟踪和空闲状态识别三部分，适用于资源受限的边缘计算设备。

Result: 目标检测F1分数为71.75%，空闲识别模块准确区分活动与空闲状态，减少误报。

Conclusion: Edge-IMI实现高效现场推理，降低对高带宽云服务和昂贵硬件的依赖。

Abstract: The construction industry faces significant challenges in optimizing
equipment utilization, as underused machinery leads to increased operational
costs and project delays. Accurate and timely monitoring of equipment activity
is therefore key to identifying idle periods and improving overall efficiency.
This paper presents the Edge-IMI framework for detecting idle construction
machinery, specifically designed for integration with surveillance camera
systems. The proposed solution consists of three components: object detection,
tracking, and idle state identification, which are tailored for execution on
resource-constrained, CPU-based edge computing devices. The performance of
Edge-IMI is evaluated using a combined dataset derived from the ACID and MOCS
benchmarks. Experimental results confirm that the object detector achieves an
F1 score of 71.75%, indicating robust real-world detection capabilities. The
logistic regression-based idle identification module reliably distinguishes
between active and idle machinery with minimal false positives. Integrating all
three modules, Edge-IMI enables efficient on-site inference, reducing reliance
on high-bandwidth cloud services and costly hardware accelerators. We also
evaluate the performance of object detection models on Raspberry Pi 5 and an
Intel NUC platforms, as example edge computing platforms. We assess the
feasibility of real-time processing and the impact of model optimization
techniques.

TL;DR: DS-VTON是一个双尺度虚拟试穿框架，通过分阶段处理结构对齐和纹理保真，实现了更高效的虚拟试穿效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法难以同时解决服装图像与目标人体的精确对齐以及细粒度纹理和图案的保留问题。

Method: DS-VTON采用两阶段方法：首先生成低分辨率试穿结果以捕获语义对应关系，第二阶段通过残差引导的扩散过程重建高分辨率输出。

Result: DS-VTON在多个标准虚拟试穿基准测试中实现了结构对齐和纹理保留的最先进性能。

Conclusion: DS-VTON通过双尺度设计和无掩模生成范式，显著提升了虚拟试穿的效果。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, most existing virtual try-on methods still struggle
to simultaneously address two core challenges: accurately aligning the garment
image with the target human body, and preserving fine-grained garment textures
and patterns. In this paper, we propose DS-VTON, a dual-scale virtual try-on
framework that explicitly disentangles these objectives for more effective
modeling. DS-VTON consists of two stages: the first stage generates a
low-resolution try-on result to capture the semantic correspondence between
garment and body, where reduced detail facilitates robust structural alignment.
The second stage introduces a residual-guided diffusion process that
reconstructs high-resolution outputs by refining the residual between the two
scales, focusing on texture fidelity. In addition, our method adopts a fully
mask-free generation paradigm, eliminating reliance on human parsing maps or
segmentation masks. By leveraging the semantic priors embedded in pretrained
diffusion models, this design more effectively preserves the person's
appearance and geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
DS-VTON achieves state-of-the-art performance in both structural alignment and
texture preservation across multiple standard virtual try-on benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有综述多从模型角度出发，忽略了骨架动作识别的关键步骤，阻碍了对任务的深入理解。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将任务分解为多个子任务，重点讨论预处理、特征提取和时空建模，并涵盖最新技术如混合架构、Mamba模型和生成模型。

Result: 提供了公共3D骨架数据集的全面概述，并分析了在这些基准上的最先进算法。

Conclusion: 本文通过任务导向的讨论和最新技术整合，为3D骨架动作识别领域提供了结构化路线图。

Abstract: With the inherent advantages of skeleton representation, 3D skeleton-based
action recognition has become a prominent topic in the field of computer
vision. However, previous reviews have predominantly adopted a model-oriented
perspective, often neglecting the fundamental steps involved in skeleton-based
action recognition. This oversight tends to ignore key components of
skeleton-based action recognition beyond model design and has hindered deeper,
more intrinsic understanding of the task. To bridge this gap, our review aims
to address these limitations by presenting a comprehensive, task-oriented
framework for understanding skeleton-based action recognition. We begin by
decomposing the task into a series of sub-tasks, placing particular emphasis on
preprocessing steps such as modality derivation and data augmentation. The
subsequent discussion delves into critical sub-tasks, including feature
extraction and spatio-temporal modeling techniques. Beyond foundational action
recognition networks, recently advanced frameworks such as hybrid
architectures, Mamba models, large language models (LLMs), and generative
models have also been highlighted. Finally, a comprehensive overview of public
3D skeleton datasets is presented, accompanied by an analysis of
state-of-the-art algorithms evaluated on these benchmarks. By integrating
task-oriented discussions, comprehensive examinations of sub-tasks, and an
emphasis on the latest advancements, our review provides a fundamental and
accessible structured roadmap for understanding and advancing the field of 3D
skeleton-based action recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过语言和视觉线索区分已完成和进行中的动作，但现有视频语言模型是否能真正理解时间动态尚不明确。

Method: 创建了包含四种语言的Perfect Times数据集，通过视频与完成标签配对，测试模型的时间推理能力。

Result: 实验表明，现有模型在时间与因果推理上表现不佳，难以模拟人类的理解。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要整合多模态线索以提升模型对动作持续性和完成性的理解，为时间推理评估设定了新标准。

Abstract: Human perception of events is intrinsically tied to distinguishing between
completed (perfect and telic) and ongoing (durative) actions, a process
mediated by both linguistic structure and visual cues. In this work, we
introduce the \textbf{Perfect Times} dataset, a novel, quadrilingual (English,
Italian, Russian, and Japanese) multiple-choice question-answering benchmark
designed to assess video-language models (VLMs) on temporal reasoning. By
pairing everyday activity videos with event completion labels and
perfectivity-tailored distractors, our dataset probes whether models truly
comprehend temporal dynamics or merely latch onto superficial markers.
Experimental results indicate that state-of-the-art models, despite their
success on text-based tasks, struggle to mirror human-like temporal and causal
reasoning grounded in video. This study underscores the necessity of
integrating deep multimodal cues to capture the nuances of action duration and
completion within temporal and causal video dynamics, setting a new standard
for evaluating and advancing temporal reasoning in VLMs.

Result: 在健康主动脉解剖结构上展示了高精度和计算效率。

Conclusion: AD-SVFD在血管形状配准和合成解剖结构生成中表现出色，具有高效和准确的潜力。

Abstract: This work introduces AD-SVFD, a deep learning model for the deformable
registration of vascular shapes to a pre-defined reference and for the
generation of synthetic anatomies. AD-SVFD operates by representing each
geometry as a weighted point cloud and models ambient space deformations as
solutions at unit time of ODEs, whose time-independent right-hand sides are
expressed through artificial neural networks. The model parameters are
optimized by minimizing the Chamfer Distance between the deformed and reference
point clouds, while backward integration of the ODE defines the inverse
transformation. A distinctive feature of AD-SVFD is its auto-decoder structure,
that enables generalization across shape cohorts and favors efficient weight
sharing. In particular, each anatomy is associated with a low-dimensional code
that acts as a self-conditioning field and that is jointly optimized with the
network parameters during training. At inference, only the latent codes are
fine-tuned, substantially reducing computational overheads. Furthermore, the
use of implicit shape representations enables generative applications: new
anatomies can be synthesized by suitably sampling from the latent space and
applying the corresponding inverse transformations to the reference geometry.
Numerical experiments, conducted on healthy aortic anatomies, showcase the
high-quality results of AD-SVFD, which yields extremely accurate approximations
at competitive computational costs.

TL;DR: TIGeR框架通过文本驱动生成和视觉引导优化，解决了3D模板在交互场景中的局限性，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D模板需要大量手动工作且适应性差，尤其在遮挡场景中表现不佳。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：文本指令生成形状先验，再通过2D-3D协同注意力优化。

Result: 在Dex-YCB和Obman数据集上表现优异，Chamfer距离分别为1.979和5.468。

Conclusion: TIGeR框架具有鲁棒性，兼容多种先验来源，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Pre-defined 3D object templates are widely used in 3D reconstruction of
hand-object interactions. However, they often require substantial manual
efforts to capture or source, and inherently restrict the adaptability of
models to unconstrained interaction scenarios, e.g., heavily-occluded objects.
To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a new Text-Instructed Generation and
Refinement (TIGeR) framework, harnessing the power of intuitive text-driven
priors to steer the object shape refinement and pose estimation. We use a
two-stage framework: a text-instructed prior generation and vision-guided
refinement. As the name implies, we first leverage off-the-shelf models to
generate shape priors according to the text description without tedious 3D
crafting. Considering the geometric gap between the synthesized prototype and
the real object interacted with the hand, we further calibrate the synthesized
prototype via 2D-3D collaborative attention. TIGeR achieves competitive
performance, i.e., 1.979 and 5.468 object Chamfer distance on the widely-used
Dex-YCB and Obman datasets, respectively, surpassing existing template-free
methods. Notably, the proposed framework shows robustness to occlusion, while
maintaining compatibility with heterogeneous prior sources, e.g., retrieved
hand-crafted prototypes, in practical deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: CAPAA为多分类器和动态相机姿态场景提供了更有效的投影对抗攻击解决方案。

Abstract: Projector-based adversarial attack aims to project carefully designed light
patterns (i.e., adversarial projections) onto scenes to deceive deep image
classifiers. It has potential applications in privacy protection and the
development of more robust classifiers. However, existing approaches primarily
focus on individual classifiers and fixed camera poses, often neglecting the
complexities of multi-classifier systems and scenarios with varying camera
poses. This limitation reduces their effectiveness when introducing new
classifiers or camera poses. In this paper, we introduce Classifier-Agnostic
Projector-Based Adversarial Attack (CAPAA) to address these issues. First, we
develop a novel classifier-agnostic adversarial loss and optimization framework
that aggregates adversarial and stealthiness loss gradients from multiple
classifiers. Then, we propose an attention-based gradient weighting mechanism
that concentrates perturbations on regions of high classification activation,
thereby improving the robustness of adversarial projections when applied to
scenes with varying camera poses. Our extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that CAPAA achieves both a higher attack success rate and greater
stealthiness compared to existing baselines. Codes are available at:

Conclusion: IVY-FAKE和IVY-XDETECTOR显著提升了AIGC检测的可解释性和统一性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) in
visual domains has resulted in highly realistic synthetic images and videos,
driven by sophisticated generative frameworks such as diffusion-based
architectures. While these breakthroughs open substantial opportunities, they
simultaneously raise critical concerns about content authenticity and
integrity. Many current AIGC detection methods operate as black-box binary
classifiers, which offer limited interpretability, and no approach supports
detecting both images and videos in a unified framework. This dual limitation
compromises model transparency, reduces trustworthiness, and hinders practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce IVY-FAKE , a novel,
unified, and large-scale dataset specifically designed for explainable
multimodal AIGC detection. Unlike prior benchmarks, which suffer from
fragmented modality coverage and sparse annotations, IVY-FAKE contains over
150,000 richly annotated training samples (images and videos) and 18,700
evaluation examples, each accompanied by detailed natural-language reasoning
beyond simple binary labels. Building on this, we propose Ivy Explainable
Detector (IVY-XDETECTOR), a unified AIGC detection and explainable architecture
that jointly performs explainable detection for both image and video content.
Our unified vision-language model achieves state-of-the-art performance across
multiple image and video detection benchmarks, highlighting the significant
advancements enabled by our dataset and modeling framework. Our data is

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Multi-modality Large Language Models (MLLMs) is
driving significant advancements in visual understanding and generation.
Nevertheless, a comprehensive assessment of their capabilities, concerning the

We curates high-quality prompts of geometric optical scenarios and use MLLMs to
construct GOBench-Gen-1k dataset.We then organize subjective experiments to
assess the generated imagery based on Optical Authenticity, Aesthetic Quality,
and Instruction Fidelity, revealing MLLMs' generation flaws that violate
optical principles. For the understanding task, we apply crafted evaluation
instructions to test optical understanding ability of eleven prominent MLLMs.
The experimental results demonstrate that current models face significant
challenges in both optical generation and understanding. The top-performing
generative model, GPT-4o-Image, cannot perfectly complete all generation tasks,
and the best-performing MLLM model, Gemini-2.5Pro, attains a mere 37.35\%
accuracy in optical understanding.

*Peng Hui,Jiamuyang Zhao,Changxin Li,Qingzhen Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于商数学习的网络（Quotient Network），通过将学习目标从绝对差异改为目标特征与现有特征的商数，解决了ResNet中学习差异的敏感性问题，并在多个数据集上验证了其优于ResNet的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ResNet通过学习特征差异来训练深度网络，但这种差异缺乏独立意义且对特征大小敏感。论文旨在解决这些问题，同时保留ResNet的优势。

Method: 提出Quotient Network，学习目标特征与现有特征的商数而非差异，并设计了一些训练规则以确保高效学习和性能提升。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100和SVHN数据集上的实验表明，Quotient Network无需增加参数即可稳定优于ResNet。

Conclusion: Quotient Network通过改进学习目标，解决了ResNet的局限性，并在实验中表现出显著优势，为深度网络训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: The emergence of ResNet provides a powerful tool for training extremely deep
networks. The core idea behind it is to change the learning goals of the
network. It no longer learns new features from scratch but learns the
difference between the target and existing features. However, the difference
between the two kinds of features does not have an independent and clear
meaning, and the amount of learning is based on the absolute rather than the
relative difference, which is sensitive to the size of existing features. We
propose a new network that perfectly solves these two problems while still
having the advantages of ResNet. Specifically, it chooses to learn the quotient
of the target features with the existing features, so we call it the quotient
network. In order to enable this network to learn successfully and achieve
higher performance, we propose some design rules for this network so that it
can be trained efficiently and achieve better performance than ResNet.
Experiments on the CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN datasets prove that this network
can stably achieve considerable improvements over ResNet by simply making tiny
corresponding changes to the original ResNet network without adding new
parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FlexSelect是一种灵活高效的视频大语言模型（VideoLLMs）处理长视频的令牌选择策略，通过跨模态注意力模式识别并保留最相关的语义内容，显著提升性能和速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解对视频大语言模型（VideoLLMs）提出了高计算和内存需求的挑战，需要一种高效的方法来处理长视频内容。

Method: FlexSelect包含两部分：1）无训练的令牌排序管道，利用跨模态注意力权重估计视频令牌的重要性；2）轻量级选择器，训练以复制这些排序并过滤冗余令牌。

Result: FlexSelect在多个长视频基准测试（如VideoMME、MLVU等）中表现优异，并能显著加速模型（如LLaVA-Video-7B模型提速9倍）。

Conclusion: FlexSelect是一种通用且高效的插件模块，可扩展视频大语言模型的时序上下文长度，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding poses a significant challenge for video large
language models (VideoLLMs) due to prohibitively high computational and memory
demands. In this paper, we propose FlexSelect, a flexible and efficient token
selection strategy for processing long videos. FlexSelect identifies and
retains the most semantically relevant content by leveraging cross-modal
attention patterns from a reference transformer layer. It comprises two key
components: (1) a training-free token ranking pipeline that leverages faithful
cross-modal attention weights to estimate each video token's importance, and
(2) a rank-supervised lightweight selector that is trained to replicate these
rankings and filter redundant tokens. This generic approach can be seamlessly
integrated into various VideoLLM architectures, such as LLaVA-Video, InternVL
and Qwen-VL, serving as a plug-and-play module to extend their temporal context
length. Empirically, FlexSelect delivers strong gains across multiple
long-video benchmarks including VideoMME, MLVU, LongVB, and LVBench. Moreover,
it achieves significant speed-ups (for example, up to 9 times on a
LLaVA-Video-7B model), highlighting FlexSelect's promise for efficient
long-form video understanding. Project page available at:

TL;DR: TIC-FT是一种高效且通用的方法，通过沿时间轴连接条件和目标帧，并插入噪声逐渐增加的缓冲帧，实现预训练视频扩散模型的适应性调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部编码器或架构修改，需要大数据集且灵活性不足，因此需要一种更高效、灵活的条件生成方法。

Method: 沿时间轴连接条件和目标帧，插入噪声逐渐增加的缓冲帧，无需架构修改。

Result: 在图像到视频和视频到视频生成任务中表现优异，仅需10-30个训练样本。

Conclusion: TIC-FT在条件保真度和视觉质量上优于现有基线，训练和推理效率高。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality
video synthesis, but controllable generation remains challenging, particularly
under limited data and compute. Existing fine-tuning methods for conditional
generation often rely on external encoders or architectural modifications,
which demand large datasets and are typically restricted to spatially aligned
conditioning, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce
Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning (TIC-FT), an efficient and versatile approach
for adapting pretrained video diffusion models to diverse conditional
generation tasks. Our key idea is to concatenate condition and target frames
along the temporal axis and insert intermediate buffer frames with
progressively increasing noise levels. These buffer frames enable smooth
transitions, aligning the fine-tuning process with the pretrained model's
temporal dynamics. TIC-FT requires no architectural changes and achieves strong
performance with as few as 10-30 training samples. We validate our method
across a range of tasks, including image-to-video and video-to-video
generation, using large-scale base models such as CogVideoX-5B and Wan-14B.
Extensive experiments show that TIC-FT outperforms existing baselines in both
condition fidelity and visual quality, while remaining highly efficient in both
training and inference. For additional results, visit

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对MS-COCO数据集标注问题的改进框架MJ-COCO，通过基于损失和梯度的错误检测以及四阶段伪标签细化流程，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MS-COCO数据集存在标注错误（如缺失标签、类别错误等），影响模型训练和泛化能力，因此需要一种自动化的标注修正方法。

Method: 采用损失和梯度检测错误样本，并通过四阶段伪标签细化流程（包括边界框生成、重复去除、类别验证和空间调整）修正标注。

Result: MJ-COCO在多个验证数据集上表现优于MS-COCO，AP和APS指标提升，且小目标标注数量增加超过20万。

Conclusion: MJ-COCO通过自动化标注修正显著提升了数据集质量，为对象检测模型的训练和评估提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Benchmark object detection (OD) datasets play a pivotal role in advancing
computer vision applications such as autonomous driving, and surveillance, as
well as in training and evaluating deep learning-based state-of-the-art
detection models. Among them, MS-COCO has become a standard benchmark due to
its diverse object categories and complex scenes. However, despite its wide
adoption, MS-COCO suffers from various annotation issues, including missing
labels, incorrect class assignments, inaccurate bounding boxes, duplicate
labels, and group labeling inconsistencies. These errors not only hinder model
training but also degrade the reliability and generalization of OD models. To
address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive refinement framework and
present MJ-COCO, a newly re-annotated version of MS-COCO. Our approach begins
with loss and gradient-based error detection to identify potentially mislabeled
or hard-to-learn samples. Next, we apply a four-stage pseudo-labeling
refinement process: (1) bounding box generation using invertible
transformations, (2) IoU-based duplicate removal and confidence merging, (3)
class consistency verification via expert objects recognizer, and (4) spatial
adjustment based on object region activation map analysis. This integrated
pipeline enables scalable and accurate correction of annotation errors without
manual re-labeling. Extensive experiments were conducted across four validation
datasets: MS-COCO, Sama COCO, Objects365, and PASCAL VOC. Models trained on
MJ-COCO consistently outperformed those trained on MS-COCO, achieving
improvements in Average Precision (AP) and APS metrics. MJ-COCO also
demonstrated significant gains in annotation coverage: for example, the number
of small object annotations increased by more than 200,000 compared to MS-COCO.

TL;DR: MoCA-Video是一个无需训练的视频语义混合框架，通过参考图像将语义特征注入视频中的特定对象，同时保持原始运动和视觉上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像域语义混合与视频之间的差距，实现高质量、可控的视频合成。

Method: 利用对角去噪调度和类别无关分割检测和跟踪对象，结合动量语义校正和伽马残差噪声稳定确保时间一致性。

Result: 在SSIM、LPIPS和新型CASS指标上优于基线，实现空间一致性和运动连贯性。

Conclusion: MoCA-Video证明在扩散噪声轨迹中进行结构化操作可实现高质量视频合成。

Abstract: We introduce MoCA-Video (Motion-Aware Concept Alignment in Video), a
training-free framework bridging the gap between image-domain semantic mixing
and video. Given a generated video and a user-provided reference image,
MoCA-Video injects the semantic features of the reference image into a specific
object within the video, while preserving the original motion and visual
context. Our approach leverages a diagonal denoising schedule and
class-agnostic segmentation to detect and track objects in the latent space and
precisely control the spatial location of the blended objects. To ensure
temporal coherence, we incorporate momentum-based semantic corrections and
gamma residual noise stabilization for smooth frame transitions. We evaluate
MoCA's performance using the standard SSIM, image-level LPIPS, temporal LPIPS,
and introduce a novel metric CASS (Conceptual Alignment Shift Score) to
evaluate the consistency and effectiveness of the visual shifts between the
source prompt and the modified video frames. Using self-constructed dataset,
MoCA-Video outperforms current baselines, achieving superior spatial
consistency, coherent motion, and a significantly higher CASS score, despite
having no training or fine-tuning. MoCA-Video demonstrates that structured
manipulation in the diffusion noise trajectory allows for controllable,
high-quality video synthesis.

TL;DR: AuralSAM2通过AuralFuser模块将音频与视觉模态结合，优化SAM2在多模态场景下的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在音频与视觉模态融合上效率低或定位不精确，且忽视多模态语义交互。

Method: 提出AuralFuser模块，通过特征金字塔和音频引导对比学习优化多模态特征融合。

Result: 在公开基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AuralSAM2为多模态分割提供了高效且精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) exhibits strong generalisation for promptable
segmentation in video clips; however, its integration with the audio modality
remains underexplored. Existing approaches mainly follow two directions: (1)
injecting adapters into the image encoder to receive audio signals, which
incurs efficiency costs during prompt engineering, and (2) leveraging
additional foundation models to generate visual prompts for the sounding
objects, which are often imprecisely localised, leading to misguidance in SAM2.
Moreover, these methods overlook the rich semantic interplay between
hierarchical visual features and other modalities, resulting in suboptimal
cross-modal fusion. In this work, we propose AuralSAM2, comprising the novel
AuralFuser module, which externally attaches to SAM2 to integrate features from
different modalities and generate feature-level prompts, guiding SAM2's decoder
in segmenting sounding targets. Such integration is facilitated by a feature
pyramid, further refining semantic understanding and enhancing object awareness
in multimodal scenarios. Additionally, the audio-guided contrastive learning is
introduced to explicitly align audio and visual representations and to also
mitigate biases caused by dominant visual patterns. Results on public
benchmarks show that our approach achieves remarkable improvements over the
previous methods in the field. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态MR-US配准对前列腺癌诊断至关重要，但现有方法因模态差异大而难以对齐关键边界。

Method: 提出ACMT网络，利用浅层特征保持纹理一致性，深层特征保留边界，并通过中间伪模态转换MR和US图像。

Result: 实验表明，ACMT有效减少模态差异并保留解剖边界，配准性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ACMT框架在多模态前列腺图像配准中表现出鲁棒性和优越性。

Abstract: Multimodal MR-US registration is critical for prostate cancer diagnosis.
However, this task remains challenging due to significant modality
discrepancies. Existing methods often fail to align critical boundaries while
being overly sensitive to irrelevant details. To address this, we propose an
anatomically coherent modality translation (ACMT) network based on a
hierarchical feature disentanglement design. We leverage shallow-layer features
for texture consistency and deep-layer features for boundary preservation.
Unlike conventional modality translation methods that convert one modality into
another, our ACMT introduces the customized design of an intermediate pseudo
modality. Both MR and US images are translated toward this intermediate domain,
effectively addressing the bottlenecks faced by traditional translation methods
in the downstream registration task. Experiments demonstrate that our method
mitigates modality-specific discrepancies while preserving crucial anatomical
boundaries for accurate registration. Quantitative evaluations show superior
modality similarity compared to state-of-the-art modality translation methods.
Furthermore, downstream registration experiments confirm that our translated
images achieve the best alignment performance, highlighting the robustness of
our framework for multi-modal prostate image registration.

Method: NavBench包含导航理解（3,200个问答对）和逐步执行（432个场景），并开发了将MLLM输出转化为机器人动作的流程。

Result: GPT-4o表现最佳，轻量模型在简单任务中有效。理解能力与执行性能相关，地图上下文提升决策准确性，但时间理解是主要挑战。

Conclusion: MLLMs在导航任务中表现潜力，但时间理解能力需改进，未来研究可关注优化模型在此领域的表现。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
generalization in vision-language tasks, yet their ability to understand and
act within embodied environments remains underexplored. We present NavBench, a
benchmark to evaluate the embodied navigation capabilities of MLLMs under
zero-shot settings. NavBench consists of two components: (1) navigation
comprehension, assessed through three cognitively grounded tasks including
global instruction alignment, temporal progress estimation, and local
observation-action reasoning, covering 3,200 question-answer pairs; and (2)
step-by-step execution in 432 episodes across 72 indoor scenes, stratified by
spatial, cognitive, and execution complexity. To support real-world deployment,
we introduce a pipeline that converts MLLMs' outputs into robotic actions. We
evaluate both proprietary and open-source models, finding that GPT-4o performs
well across tasks, while lighter open-source models succeed in simpler cases.
Results also show that models with higher comprehension scores tend to achieve
better execution performance. Providing map-based context improves decision
accuracy, especially in medium-difficulty scenarios. However, most models
struggle with temporal understanding, particularly in estimating progress
during navigation, which may pose a key challenge.

Conclusion: 提出的模型设计和训练策略有效，显著提升了视频超分辨率的性能。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) methods are susceptible
to introducing complex degradations and noticeable artifacts into
high-resolution videos due to their inherent randomness. In this paper, we
propose a noise-robust real-world VSR framework by incorporating
self-supervised learning and Mamba into pre-trained latent diffusion models. To
ensure content consistency across adjacent frames, we enhance the diffusion
model with a global spatio-temporal attention mechanism using the Video
State-Space block with a 3D Selective Scan module, which reinforces coherence
at an affordable computational cost. To further reduce artifacts in generated
details, we introduce a self-supervised ControlNet that leverages HR features
as guidance and employs contrastive learning to extract degradation-insensitive
features from LR videos. Finally, a three-stage training strategy based on a
mixture of HR-LR videos is proposed to stabilize VSR training. The proposed
Self-supervised ControlNet with Spatio-Temporal Continuous Mamba based VSR
algorithm achieves superior perceptual quality than state-of-the-arts on
real-world VSR benchmark datasets, validating the effectiveness of the proposed
model design and training strategies.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优异，Flevoland 1989数据集上总体准确率达99.70%。

Conclusion: ECP-Mamba在准确性和资源效率之间取得了平衡，为PolSAR分类提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification
has been greatly promoted by deep neural networks. However,current deep
learning-based PolSAR classification methods encounter difficulties due to its
dependence on extensive labeled data and the computational inefficiency of
architectures like Transformers. This paper presents ECP-Mamba, an efficient
framework integrating multi-scale self-supervised contrastive learning with a
state space model (SSM) backbone. Specifically, ECP-Mamba addresses annotation
scarcity through a multi-scale predictive pretext task based on local-to-global
feature correspondences, which uses a simplified self-distillation paradigm
without negative sample pairs. To enhance computational efficiency,the Mamba
architecture (a selective SSM) is first tailored for pixel-wise PolSAR
classification task by designing a spiral scan strategy. This strategy
prioritizes causally relevant features near the central pixel, leveraging the
localized nature of pixel-wise classification tasks. Additionally, the
lightweight Cross Mamba module is proposed to facilitates complementary
multi-scale feature interaction with minimal overhead. Extensive experiments
across four benchmark datasets demonstrate ECP-Mamba's effectiveness in
balancing high accuracy with resource efficiency. On the Flevoland 1989
dataset, ECP-Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance with an overall
accuracy of 99.70%, average accuracy of 99.64% and Kappa coefficient of

systematically organize and describe VFI methodologies, detailing the core
principles, design assumptions, and technical characteristics of each approach.
We categorize the learning paradigm of VFI methods namely, Center-Time Frame
Interpolation (CTFI) and Arbitrary-Time Frame Interpolation (ATFI). We analyze
key challenges of VFI such as large motion, occlusion, lighting variation, and
non-linear motion. In addition, we review standard datasets, loss functions,
evaluation metrics. We examine applications of VFI including event-based,

Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现优异，但其对视觉对抗攻击的脆弱性限制了性能。目前对抗净化的方法研究较少，F3旨在填补这一空白。

Result: F3无需训练、易于实现，计算效率高，显著优于现有净化方法。

Conclusion: F3适用于大规模工业应用，兼顾鲁棒性和效率，代码将公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have showcased their
remarkable capabilities across a wide range of multimodal vision-language
tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to visual adversarial attacks,
which can substantially compromise their performance. Despite their potential
impact, the development of effective methods for purifying such adversarial
examples has received relatively limited attention. In this paper, we introduce
F3, a novel adversarial purification framework that employs a counterintuitive
"fighting fire with fire" strategy: intentionally introducing simple
perturbations to adversarial examples to mitigate their harmful effects.
Specifically, F3 leverages cross-modal attentions derived from randomly
perturbed adversary examples as reference targets. By injecting noise into
these adversarial examples, F3 effectively refines their attention, resulting
in cleaner and more reliable model outputs. Remarkably, this seemingly
paradoxical approach of employing noise to counteract adversarial attacks
yields impressive purification results. Furthermore, F3 offers several distinct
advantages: it is training-free and straightforward to implement, and exhibits
significant computational efficiency improvements compared to existing
purification methods. These attributes render F3 particularly suitable for
large-scale industrial applications where both robust performance and
operational efficiency are critical priorities. The code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 现有生物识别方法（如虹膜扫描和基因组分析）成本高且耗时，研究试图通过指纹与血型的关联提供更经济的替代方案。

Method: 纳入200名受试者，比较指纹类型（环、涡、弓）与血型，使用卡方检验和皮尔逊相关性分析。

Result: 环型指纹最常见，O+血型最普遍，但指纹模式与血型无显著统计学关联。

Abstract: Identification of a person is central in forensic science, security, and
healthcare. Methods such as iris scanning and genomic profiling are more
accurate but expensive, time-consuming, and more difficult to implement. This
study focuses on the relationship between the fingerprint patterns and the ABO
blood group as a biometric identification tool. A total of 200 subjects were
included in the study, and fingerprint types (loops, whorls, and arches) and
blood groups were compared. Associations were evaluated with statistical tests,
including chi-square and Pearson correlation. The study found that the loops
were the most common fingerprint pattern and the O+ blood group was the most
prevalent. Even though there was some associative pattern, there was no
statistically significant difference in the fingerprint patterns of different
blood groups. Overall, the results indicate that blood group data do not
significantly improve personal identification when used in conjunction with
fingerprinting. Although the study shows weak correlation, it may emphasize the
efforts of multi-modal based biometric systems in enhancing the current
biometric systems. Future studies may focus on larger and more diverse samples,
and possibly machine learning and additional biometrics to improve
identification methods. This study addresses an element of the ever-changing
nature of the fields of forensic science and biometric identification,

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视图训练虽能提升性能，但对比学习在视图增加时未能持续增强模型泛化能力，需解决梯度冲突问题。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，达到新SOTA性能。

Conclusion: ACL算法有效解决了长尾识别问题，并通过实验验证了其优越性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Aligned Contrastive Learning (ACL) algorithm to
address the long-tailed recognition problem. Our findings indicate that while
multi-view training boosts the performance, contrastive learning does not
consistently enhance model generalization as the number of views increases.
Through theoretical gradient analysis of supervised contrastive learning (SCL),
we identify gradient conflicts, and imbalanced attraction and repulsion
gradients between positive and negative pairs as the underlying issues. Our ACL

TL;DR: GynBTNet是一种多阶段学习框架，通过自监督预训练和分层微调策略提升妇科近距离放射治疗（GYN-BT）中临床靶区和危及器官的分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 妇科近距离放射治疗中，临床靶区和危及器官的准确分割对治疗计划至关重要，但解剖变异性、CT成像中软组织对比度低以及标注数据有限等问题带来了挑战。

Method: GynBTNet采用三阶段训练策略：1）自监督预训练，2）多器官分割数据集的监督微调，3）针对GYN-BT数据集的特定任务微调。

Result: GynBTNet在DSC、HD95和ASD指标上显著优于nnU-Net和Swin-UNETR，但对乙状结肠的分割仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: GynBTNet通过自监督预训练和分层微调显著提升了分割性能，为临床提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate segmentation of clinical target volumes (CTV) and
organs-at-risk is crucial for optimizing gynecologic brachytherapy (GYN-BT)
treatment planning. However, anatomical variability, low soft-tissue contrast
in CT imaging, and limited annotated datasets pose significant challenges. This
study presents GynBTNet, a novel multi-stage learning framework designed to
enhance segmentation performance through self-supervised pretraining and
hierarchical fine-tuning strategies. Methods: GynBTNet employs a three-stage
training strategy: (1) self-supervised pretraining on large-scale CT datasets
using sparse submanifold convolution to capture robust anatomical
representations, (2) supervised fine-tuning on a comprehensive multi-organ
segmentation dataset to refine feature extraction, and (3) task-specific
fine-tuning on a dedicated GYN-BT dataset to optimize segmentation performance
for clinical applications. The model was evaluated against state-of-the-art
methods using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), 95th percentile Hausdorff
Distance (HD95), and Average Surface Distance (ASD). Results: Our GynBTNet
achieved superior segmentation performance, significantly outperforming nnU-Net
and Swin-UNETR. Notably, it yielded a DSC of 0.837 +/- 0.068 for CTV, 0.940 +/-
0.052 for the bladder, 0.842 +/- 0.070 for the rectum, and 0.871 +/- 0.047 for
the uterus, with reduced HD95 and ASD compared to baseline models.
Self-supervised pretraining led to consistent performance improvements,
particularly for structures with complex boundaries. However, segmentation of
the sigmoid colon remained challenging, likely due to anatomical ambiguities
and inter-patient variability. Statistical significance analysis confirmed that
GynBTNet's improvements were significant compared to baseline models.

TL;DR: GThinker是一种新型多模态推理模型，通过Cue-Rethinking策略和两阶段训练，显著提升视觉中心多模态推理任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视觉中心多模态推理任务中表现不佳，主要依赖逻辑和知识的慢思考策略，未能有效整合视觉信息。

Method: 提出Cue-Rethinking策略，结合两阶段训练（模式引导冷启动和激励强化学习），并使用GThinker-11K数据集支持训练。

Result: 在M$^3$CoT基准测试中达到81.5%，超越O4-mini模型，并在通用场景多模态推理任务中平均提升2.1%。

Conclusion: GThinker通过视觉线索的迭代重解释和强化学习，实现了跨领域多模态推理能力的显著提升。

Abstract: Despite notable advancements in multimodal reasoning, leading Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) still underperform on vision-centric multimodal
reasoning tasks in general scenarios. This shortfall stems from their
predominant reliance on logic- and knowledge-based slow thinking strategies,
while effective for domains like math and science, fail to integrate visual
information effectively during reasoning. Consequently, these models often fail
to adequately ground visual cues, resulting in suboptimal performance in tasks
that require multiple plausible visual interpretations and inferences. To
address this, we present GThinker (General Thinker), a novel reasoning MLLM
excelling in multimodal reasoning across general scenarios, mathematics, and
science. GThinker introduces Cue-Rethinking, a flexible reasoning pattern that
grounds inferences in visual cues and iteratively reinterprets these cues to
resolve inconsistencies. Building on this pattern, we further propose a
two-stage training pipeline, including pattern-guided cold start and incentive
reinforcement learning, designed to enable multimodal reasoning capabilities
across domains. Furthermore, to support the training, we construct
GThinker-11K, comprising 7K high-quality, iteratively-annotated reasoning paths
and 4K curated reinforcement learning samples, filling the data gap toward
general multimodal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GThinker
achieves 81.5% on the challenging comprehensive multimodal reasoning benchmark
M$^3$CoT, surpassing the latest O4-mini model. It also shows an average
improvement of 2.1% on general scenario multimodal reasoning benchmarks, while
maintaining on-par performance in mathematical reasoning compared to
counterpart advanced reasoning models. The code, model, and data will be
released soon at https://github.com/jefferyZhan/GThinker.

Motivation: 解决传统指令调优方法在数据、标注和计算资源上的高成本问题。

Conclusion: PROGRESS是一种可扩展的高效学习解决方案，具有跨架构泛化能力。

Abstract: Instruction tuning has been central to the success of recent vision-language
models (VLMs), but it remains expensive-requiring large-scale datasets,
high-quality annotations, and large compute budgets. We propose PRioritized
cOncept learninG via Relative Error-driven Sample Selection (PROGRESS), a data-
and compute-efficient framework that enables VLMs to dynamically select what to
learn next based on their evolving needs during training. At each stage, the
model tracks its learning progress across skills and selects the most
informative samples-those it has not already mastered and that are not too
difficult to learn at the current stage of training. This strategy effectively
controls skill acquisition and the order in which skills are learned.
Specifically, we sample from skills showing the highest learning progress,
prioritizing those with the most rapid improvement. Unlike prior methods,
PROGRESS requires no upfront answer annotations, queries answers only on a need
basis, avoids reliance on additional supervision from auxiliary VLMs, and does
not require compute-heavy gradient computations for data selection. Experiments
across multiple instruction-tuning datasets of varying scales demonstrate that
PROGRESS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with much less
data and supervision. Additionally, we show strong cross-architecture
generalization and transferability to larger models, validating PROGRESS as a
scalable solution for efficient learning.

TL;DR: 研究发现，通过适当的视觉令牌压缩，可以在多模态大语言模型（MLLM）的输入阶段实现高效压缩，性能损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM处理大量视觉令牌导致计算成本高且效率低下，研究旨在探索输入阶段的令牌压缩可行性。

Method: 利用可解释性方法评估视觉令牌重要性，并通过学习第一层注意力图到解释结果的映射实现高效压缩。

Result: 在10个图像和视频基准测试中，压缩50%视觉令牌仍能保留96%以上性能，且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 输入阶段的令牌压缩是可行的，且通过轻量级网络实现，为MLLM的高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to significant computational costs and inefficiency.
Previous works generally assume that all visual tokens are necessary in the
shallow layers of LLMs, and therefore token compression typically occurs in
intermediate layers. In contrast, our study reveals an interesting insight:
with proper selection, token compression is feasible at the input stage of LLM
with negligible performance loss. Specifically, we reveal that explainability
methods can effectively evaluate the importance of each visual token with
respect to the given instruction, which can well guide the token compression.
Furthermore, we propose to learn a mapping from the attention map of the first
LLM layer to the explanation results, thereby avoiding the need for a full
inference pass and facilitating practical deployment. Interestingly, this
mapping can be learned using a simple and lightweight convolutional network,
whose training is efficient and independent of MLLMs. Extensive experiments on
10 image and video benchmarks across three leading MLLMs (Qwen2-VL,
LLaVA-OneVision, and VILA1.5) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,
e.g., pruning 50% visual tokens while retaining more than 96% of the original
performance across all benchmarks for all these three MLLMs. It also exhibits
strong generalization, even when the number of tokens in inference far exceeds
that used in training.

Conclusion: GLEVR框架在细粒度关键步骤识别任务中表现出色，计算高效且灵活。

Abstract: We pose keystep recognition as a node classification task, and propose a
flexible graph-learning framework for fine-grained keystep recognition that is
able to effectively leverage long-term dependencies in egocentric videos. Our
approach, termed GLEVR, consists of constructing a graph where each video clip
of the egocentric video corresponds to a node. The constructed graphs are
sparse and computationally efficient, outperforming existing larger models
substantially. We further leverage alignment between egocentric and exocentric
videos during training for improved inference on egocentric videos, as well as
adding automatic captioning as an additional modality. We consider each clip of
each exocentric video (if available) or video captions as additional nodes
during training. We examine several strategies to define connections across
these nodes. We perform extensive experiments on the Ego-Exo4D dataset and show
that our proposed flexible graph-based framework notably outperforms existing
methods.

Method: DeepVerse将先前时间步的几何预测显式结合到当前动作条件下的预测中。

Result: 实验表明，DeepVerse能捕捉更丰富的时空关系和物理动态，显著减少漂移并提升一致性，同时支持高保真长期预测。

Conclusion: DeepVerse为几何感知的动态预测提供了有效解决方案，验证了其在多样场景中的高效性。

Abstract: World models serve as essential building blocks toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), enabling intelligent agents to predict future states and
plan actions by simulating complex physical interactions. However, existing
interactive models primarily predict visual observations, thereby neglecting
crucial hidden states like geometric structures and spatial coherence. This
leads to rapid error accumulation and temporal inconsistency. To address these
limitations, we introduce DeepVerse, a novel 4D interactive world model
explicitly incorporating geometric predictions from previous timesteps into
current predictions conditioned on actions. Experiments demonstrate that by
incorporating explicit geometric constraints, DeepVerse captures richer
spatio-temporal relationships and underlying physical dynamics. This capability
significantly reduces drift and enhances temporal consistency, enabling the
model to reliably generate extended future sequences and achieve substantial
improvements in prediction accuracy, visual realism, and scene rationality.
Furthermore, our method provides an effective solution for geometry-aware
memory retrieval, effectively preserving long-term spatial consistency. We
validate the effectiveness of DeepVerse across diverse scenarios, establishing
its capacity for high-fidelity, long-horizon predictions grounded in
geometry-aware dynamics.

Motivation: 解决农业环境中水果计数的视觉遮挡、语义模糊和高计算需求问题。

Method: 采用自适应高斯喷洒管道重建场景，结合CLIP对齐的语言嵌入实现语义控制，并通过分布感知采样和聚类估计水果数量。

Result: 在真实果园数据上，FruitLangGS在渲染速度、语义灵活性和计数准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FruitLangGS为语言驱动的实时神经渲染提供了新视角。

Abstract: Accurate fruit counting in real-world agricultural environments is a
longstanding challenge due to visual occlusions, semantic ambiguity, and the
high computational demands of 3D reconstruction. Existing methods based on
neural radiance fields suffer from low inference speed, limited generalization,
and lack support for open-set semantic control. This paper presents
FruitLangGS, a real-time 3D fruit counting framework that addresses these
limitations through spatial reconstruction, semantic embedding, and
language-guided instance estimation. FruitLangGS first reconstructs
orchard-scale scenes using an adaptive Gaussian splatting pipeline with
radius-aware pruning and tile-based rasterization for efficient rendering. To
enable semantic control, each Gaussian encodes a compressed CLIP-aligned
language embedding, forming a compact and queryable 3D representation. At
inference time, prompt-based semantic filtering is applied directly in 3D
space, without relying on image-space segmentation or view-level fusion. The
selected Gaussians are then converted into dense point clouds via
distribution-aware sampling and clustered to estimate fruit counts.
Experimental results on real orchard data demonstrate that FruitLangGS achieves
higher rendering speed, semantic flexibility, and counting accuracy compared to
prior approaches, offering a new perspective for language-driven, real-time
neural rendering across open-world scenarios.

Abstract: Many motion-centric video analysis tasks, such as atomic actions, detecting
atypical motor behavior in individuals with autism, or analyzing articulatory
motion in real-time MRI of human speech, require efficient and interpretable
temporal modeling. Capturing temporal dynamics is a central challenge in video
analysis, often requiring significant computational resources and fine-grained
annotations that are not widely available. This paper presents MOOSE (Motion
Flow Over Spatial Space), a novel temporally-centric video encoder explicitly
integrating optical flow with spatial embeddings to model temporal information
efficiently, inspired by human perception of motion. Unlike prior models, MOOSE
takes advantage of rich, widely available pre-trained visual and optical flow
encoders instead of training video models from scratch. This significantly
reduces computational complexity while enhancing temporal interpretability. Our
primary contributions includes (1) proposing a computationally efficient
temporally-centric architecture for video understanding (2) demonstrating
enhanced interpretability in modeling temporal dynamics; and (3) achieving
state-of-the-art performance on diverse benchmarks, including clinical,
medical, and standard action recognition datasets, confirming the broad
applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Surgical triplet detection has emerged as a pivotal task in surgical video
analysis, with significant implications for performance assessment and the
training of novice surgeons. However, existing datasets such as CholecT50
exhibit critical limitations: they lack precise spatial bounding box
annotations, provide inconsistent and clinically ungrounded temporal labels,
and rely on a single data source, which limits model generalizability.To
address these shortcomings, we introduce ProstaTD, a large-scale,
multi-institutional dataset for surgical triplet detection, developed from the
technically demanding domain of robot-assisted prostatectomy. ProstaTD offers
clinically defined temporal boundaries and high-precision bounding box
annotations for each structured triplet action. The dataset comprises 60,529
video frames and 165,567 annotated triplet instances, collected from 21
surgeries performed across multiple institutions, reflecting a broad range of
surgical practices and intraoperative conditions. The annotation process was
conducted under rigorous medical supervision and involved more than 50
contributors, including practicing surgeons and medically trained annotators,
through multiple iterative phases of labeling and verification. ProstaTD is the
largest and most diverse surgical triplet dataset to date, providing a robust
foundation for fair benchmarking, the development of reliable surgical AI

Motivation: 现有文本到视频扩散模型在建模时间动态方面存在局限，通常需要重新训练或引入外部条件信号。FlowMo旨在不依赖额外训练或输入的情况下，直接从模型预测中提取时间表示。

Result: 实验表明，FlowMo显著提升了运动连贯性，同时保持了视觉质量和提示对齐。

Conclusion: FlowMo为预训练视频扩散模型提供了一种即插即用的时间保真度增强方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models are notoriously limited in their ability to
model temporal aspects such as motion, physics, and dynamic interactions.
Existing approaches address this limitation by retraining the model or
introducing external conditioning signals to enforce temporal consistency. In
this work, we explore whether a meaningful temporal representation can be
extracted directly from the predictions of a pre-trained model without any
additional training or auxiliary inputs. We introduce \textbf{FlowMo}, a novel
training-free guidance method that enhances motion coherence using only the
model's own predictions in each diffusion step. FlowMo first derives an
appearance-debiased temporal representation by measuring the distance between
latents corresponding to consecutive frames. This highlights the implicit
temporal structure predicted by the model. It then estimates motion coherence
by measuring the patch-wise variance across the temporal dimension and guides
the model to reduce this variance dynamically during sampling. Extensive
experiments across multiple text-to-video models demonstrate that FlowMo
significantly improves motion coherence without sacrificing visual quality or
prompt alignment, offering an effective plug-and-play solution for enhancing
the temporal fidelity of pre-trained video diffusion models.

Result: 在多种形状数据集上表现优异，参数少且性能与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: SVarM方法为形状数据分析提供了高效且通用的框架。

Abstract: Despite progress in the rapidly developing field of geometric deep learning,
performing statistical analysis on geometric data--where each observation is a
shape such as a curve, graph, or surface--remains challenging due to the
non-Euclidean nature of shape spaces, which are defined as equivalence classes
under invariance groups. Building machine learning frameworks that incorporate
such invariances, notably to shape parametrization, is often crucial to ensure
generalizability of the trained models to new observations. This work proposes
SVarM to exploit varifold representations of shapes as measures and their
duality with test functions $h:\mathbb{R}^n \times S^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}$.
This method provides a general framework akin to linear support vector machines
but operating instead over the infinite-dimensional space of varifolds. We
develop classification and regression models on shape datasets by introducing a
neural network-based representation of the trainable test function $h$. This
approach demonstrates strong performance and robustness across various shape
graph and surface datasets, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters.

Conclusion: 提出在通用对比表示预训练前增加预训练阶段，利用人类视觉系统的归纳偏置提升最终表示质量并减少收敛时间。

Abstract: David Marr's seminal theory of human perception stipulates that visual
processing is a multi-stage process, prioritizing the derivation of boundary
and surface properties before forming semantic object representations. In
contrast, contrastive representation learning frameworks typically bypass this
explicit multi-stage approach, defining their objective as the direct learning
of a semantic representation space for objects. While effective in general
contexts, this approach sacrifices the inductive biases of vision, leading to
slower convergence speed and learning shortcut resulting in texture bias. In
this work, we demonstrate that leveraging Marr's multi-stage theory-by first
constructing boundary and surface-level representations using perceptual
constructs from early visual processing stages and subsequently training for
object semantics-leads to 2x faster convergence on ResNet18, improved final
representations on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and object
recognition, and enhanced robustness and out-of-distribution capability.
Together, we propose a pretraining stage before the general contrastive
representation pretraining to further enhance the final representation quality
and reduce the overall convergence time via inductive bias from human vision
systems.

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a fundamental task in affective
computing with applications in human-computer interaction, mental health
analysis, and behavioral understanding. In this paper, we propose SMILE-VLM, a
self-supervised vision-language model for 3D/4D FER that unifies multiview
visual representation learning with natural language supervision. SMILE-VLM
learns robust, semantically aligned, and view-invariant embeddings by proposing
three core components: multiview decorrelation via a Barlow Twins-style loss,
vision-language contrastive alignment, and cross-modal redundancy minimization.
Our framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.
We further extend SMILE-VLM to the task of 4D micro-expression recognition
(MER) to recognize the subtle affective cues. The extensive results demonstrate
that SMILE-VLM not only surpasses existing unsupervised methods but also
matches or exceeds supervised baselines, offering a scalable and
annotation-efficient solution for expressive facial behavior understanding.

Abstract: This review provides an in-depth exploration of the field of animal action
recognition, focusing on coarse-grained (CG) and fine-grained (FG) techniques.
The primary aim is to examine the current state of research in animal behaviour
recognition and to elucidate the unique challenges associated with recognising
subtle animal actions in outdoor environments. These challenges differ
significantly from those encountered in human action recognition due to factors
such as non-rigid body structures, frequent occlusions, and the lack of
large-scale, annotated datasets. The review begins by discussing the evolution
of human action recognition, a more established field, highlighting how it
progressed from broad, coarse actions in controlled settings to the demand for
fine-grained recognition in dynamic environments. This shift is particularly
relevant for animal action recognition, where behavioural variability and
environmental complexity present unique challenges that human-centric models
cannot fully address. The review then underscores the critical differences
between human and animal action recognition, with an emphasis on high
intra-species variability, unstructured datasets, and the natural complexity of
animal habitats. Techniques like spatio-temporal deep learning frameworks
(e.g., SlowFast) are evaluated for their effectiveness in animal behaviour
analysis, along with the limitations of existing datasets. By assessing the
strengths and weaknesses of current methodologies and introducing a
recently-published dataset, the review outlines future directions for advancing
fine-grained action recognition, aiming to improve accuracy and
generalisability in behaviour analysis across species.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 利用GAN判别器保护计算机视觉模型免受脏标签攻击，通过训练单类判别器识别错误标签和修改图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决收集图像时可能遭遇的脏标签或干净标签攻击问题，避免手动检查或重新训练模型的高成本。

Method: 使用GAN判别器训练单类模型，通过置信度分数阈值识别错误标签和修改图像。

Result: 在扰动幅度为0.20时，能100%识别测试中的毒化图像。

Conclusion: 开发者可基于此方法训练判别器，保护高价值类别的CV模型。

Abstract: Gathering enough images to train a deep computer vision model is a constant
challenge. Unfortunately, collecting images from unknown sources can leave your
model s behavior at risk of being manipulated by a dirty-label or clean-label
attack unless the images are properly inspected. Manually inspecting each
image-label pair is impractical and common poison-detection methods that
involve re-training your model can be time consuming. This research uses GAN
discriminators to protect a single class against mislabeled and different
levels of modified images. The effect of said perturbation on a basic
convolutional neural network classifier is also included for reference. The
results suggest that after training on a single class, GAN discriminator s
confidence scores can provide a threshold to identify mislabeled images and
identify 100% of the tested poison starting at a perturbation epsilon magnitude
of 0.20, after decision threshold calibration using in-class samples.
Developers can use this report as a basis to train their own discriminators to
protect high valued classes in their CV models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱卫星图像在农业、渔业和环境监测中至关重要，但其高维度、大数据量和多分辨率特性给数据压缩和分析带来挑战。

Method: 利用INR将卫星图像建模为坐标空间上的连续函数，并引入傅里叶调制算法动态适应各波段的光谱和空间特征。

Abstract: Multispectral satellite images play a vital role in agriculture, fisheries,

volumes, and diverse spatial resolutions across multiple channels pose
significant challenges for data compression and analysis. This paper presents
ImpliSat, a unified framework specifically designed to address these challenges
through efficient compression and reconstruction of multispectral satellite
data. ImpliSat leverages Implicit Neural Representations (INR) to model
satellite images as continuous functions over coordinate space, capturing fine
spatial details across varying spatial resolutions. Furthermore, we introduce a
Fourier modulation algorithm that dynamically adjusts to the spectral and
spatial characteristics of each band, ensuring optimal compression while
preserving critical image details.

TL;DR: VS2是一种轻量级测试时方法，通过稀疏特征引导视觉模型，无需对比数据，显著提升性能。VS2++进一步通过检索增强稀疏特征，性能更优。PASS通过原型对齐进一步提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在动态或资源受限环境中，无需重新训练或大量标注数据即可引导视觉基础模型是一个重要但具有挑战性的目标。

Method: 提出VS2和VS2++方法，利用稀疏自编码器的稀疏特征引导模型；进一步提出PASS，通过原型对齐优化稀疏特征。

Result: VS2在多个数据集上超越零样本CLIP，VS2++性能更优，PASS进一步小幅提升效果。

Conclusion: 稀疏特征引导能显著提升模型性能，尤其是针对特定类别，原型对齐可进一步优化效果。

Abstract: Steering vision foundation models at inference time without retraining or
access to large labeled datasets is a desirable yet challenging objective,
particularly in dynamic or resource-constrained settings. In this paper, we
introduce Visual Sparse Steering (VS2), a lightweight, test-time method that
guides vision models using steering vectors derived from sparse features
learned by top-$k$ Sparse Autoencoders without requiring contrastive data.
Specifically, VS2 surpasses zero-shot CLIP by 4.12% on CIFAR-100, 1.08% on
CUB-200, and 1.84% on Tiny-ImageNet. We further propose VS2++, a
retrieval-augmented variant that selectively amplifies relevant sparse features
using pseudo-labeled neighbors at inference time. With oracle positive/negative
sets, VS2++ achieves absolute top-1 gains over CLIP zero-shot of up to 21.44%
on CIFAR-100, 7.08% on CUB-200, and 20.47% on Tiny-ImageNet. Interestingly, VS2
and VS2++ raise per-class accuracy by up to 25% and 38%, respectively, showing
that sparse steering benefits specific classes by disambiguating visually or
taxonomically proximate categories rather than providing a uniform boost.
Finally, to better align the sparse features learned through the SAE
reconstruction task with those relevant for downstream performance, we propose
Prototype-Aligned Sparse Steering (PASS). By incorporating a
prototype-alignment loss during SAE training, using labels only during training
while remaining fully test-time unsupervised, PASS consistently, though
modestly, outperforms VS2, achieving a 6.12% gain over VS2 only on CIFAR-100
with ViT-B/32.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReFoCUS是一种通过强化学习优化视频帧选择的新框架，提升视频问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频多模态模型的帧选择策略效果不佳，无法提供查询相关信息。

Method: 采用强化学习训练帧选择策略，利用参考模型的奖励信号优化选择，并通过自回归条件选择架构降低复杂度。

Result: 在多个视频问答基准测试中表现优异，无需显式帧级监督。

Conclusion: ReFoCUS通过模型内部对齐帧选择，显著提升了视频内容理解能力。

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) has enabled effective
vision-language reasoning, yet the ability to understand video content remains
constrained by suboptimal frame selection strategies. Existing approaches often
rely on static heuristics or external retrieval modules to feed frame
information into video-LLMs, which may fail to provide the query-relevant
information. In this work, we introduce ReFoCUS (Reinforcement-guided Frame
Optimization for Contextual UnderStanding), a novel frame-level policy
optimization framework that shifts the optimization target from textual
responses to visual input selection. ReFoCUS learns a frame selection policy
via reinforcement learning, using reward signals derived from a reference LMM
to reflect the model's intrinsic preferences for frames that best support
temporally grounded responses. To efficiently explore the large combinatorial
frame space, we employ an autoregressive, conditional selection architecture
that ensures temporal coherence while reducing complexity. Our approach does
not require explicit supervision at the frame-level and consistently improves
reasoning performance across multiple video QA benchmarks, highlighting the
benefits of aligning frame selection with model-internal utility.

TL;DR: 提出了M3STR基准，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对结构化视觉知识的理解能力，发现现有模型在此方面存在不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准忽视了MLLMs对结构化视觉知识的理解能力，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 设计M3STR基准，利用多模态知识图谱生成包含多模态实体及其关系的图像，要求模型识别实体并解析关系拓扑。

Result: 对26个先进MLLMs的评估显示，它们在处理结构化视觉知识方面存在显著缺陷。

Conclusion: M3STR为提升MLLMs的整体推理能力指明了方向，代码和数据已开源。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) incorporate heterogeneous
modalities into LLMs, enabling a comprehensive understanding of diverse
scenarios and objects. Despite the proliferation of evaluation benchmarks and
leaderboards for MLLMs, they predominantly overlook the critical capacity of
MLLMs to comprehend world knowledge with structured abstractions that appear in
visual form. To address this gap, we propose a novel evaluation paradigm and
devise M3STR, an innovative benchmark grounded in the Multi-Modal Map for
STRuctured understanding. This benchmark leverages multi-modal knowledge graphs
to synthesize images encapsulating subgraph architectures enriched with
multi-modal entities. M3STR necessitates that MLLMs not only recognize the
multi-modal entities within the visual inputs but also decipher intricate
relational topologies among them. We delineate the benchmark's statistical
profiles and automated construction pipeline, accompanied by an extensive
empirical analysis of 26 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our findings reveal persistent
deficiencies in processing abstractive visual information with structured
knowledge, thereby charting a pivotal trajectory for advancing MLLMs' holistic
reasoning capacities. Our code and data are released at

TL;DR: ReAgent-V是一种新型视频理解框架，通过动态反馈和多视角反思机制提升推理能力，显著提高了泛化和推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频理解方法缺乏动态反馈，限制了模型在复杂场景中的自我修正和适应能力。现有方法存在高标注成本、低推理效率等问题。

Method: ReAgent-V结合高效帧选择和实时奖励生成，通过多视角反思机制迭代优化答案，并支持灵活工具集成。

Result: 在12个数据集上的实验显示，ReAgent-V在视频理解、推理增强和模型对齐方面分别提升了6.9%、2.1%和9.8%。

Conclusion: ReAgent-V是一种轻量级、模块化且高效的框架，显著提升了视频理解的泛化和推理能力。

Abstract: Video understanding is fundamental to tasks such as action recognition, video
reasoning, and robotic control. Early video understanding methods based on
large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically adopt a single-pass reasoning
paradigm without dynamic feedback, limiting the model's capacity to
self-correct and adapt in complex scenarios. Recent efforts have attempted to
address this limitation by incorporating reward models and reinforcement
learning to enhance reasoning, or by employing tool-agent frameworks. However,
these approaches face several challenges, including high annotation costs,
reward signals that fail to capture real-time reasoning states, and low
inference efficiency. To overcome these issues, we propose ReAgent-V, a novel
agentic video understanding framework that integrates efficient frame selection
with real-time reward generation during inference. These reward signals not
only guide iterative answer refinement through a multi-perspective reflection
mechanism-adjusting predictions from conservative, neutral, and aggressive
viewpoints-but also enable automatic filtering of high-quality data for
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and group
relative policy optimization (GRPO). ReAgent-V is lightweight, modular, and
extensible, supporting flexible tool integration tailored to diverse tasks.
Extensive experiments on 12 datasets across three core applications-video
understanding, video reasoning enhancement, and vision-language-action model
alignment-demonstrate significant gains in generalization and reasoning, with
improvements of up to 6.9%, 2.1%, and 9.8%, respectively, highlighting the
effectiveness and versatility of the proposed framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展基础模型（如SAM）到视频分割领域面临高训练成本和资源需求的挑战，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过升级预训练的SAM模型，引入时空视频感知、记忆过滤策略和基于记忆的提示机制，实现高效的视频分割。

Result: 实验表明，SAM-I2V仅用0.2%的训练成本即可达到SAM 2的90%性能。

Conclusion: SAM-I2V为视频分割提供了一种资源高效的途径，降低了研究门槛并推动了该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have significantly
advanced promptable image segmentation in computer vision. However, extending
these capabilities to videos presents substantial challenges, particularly in
ensuring precise and temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes.
SAM 2 attempts to address this by training a model on massive image and video
data from scratch to learn complex spatiotemporal associations, resulting in
huge training costs that hinder research and practical deployment. In this
paper, we introduce SAM-I2V, an effective image-to-video upgradation method for
cultivating a promptable video segmentation (PVS) model. Our approach
strategically upgrades the pre-trained SAM to support PVS, significantly
reducing training complexity and resource requirements. To achieve this, we
introduce three key innovations: (i) an image-to-video feature extraction
upgrader built upon SAM's static image encoder to enable spatiotemporal video
perception, (ii) a memory filtering strategy that selects the most relevant
past frames for more effective utilization of historical information, and (iii)
a memory-as-prompt mechanism leveraging object memory to ensure temporally
consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves over 90% of SAM 2's performance while
using only 0.2% of its training cost. Our work presents a resource-efficient
pathway to PVS, lowering barriers for further research in PVS model design and
enabling broader applications and advancements in the field. Code and model are

Conclusion: Aesthetic-4K和Diffusion-4K为超高清图像合成提供了新基准和方法。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution image synthesis holds significant potential, yet
remains an underexplored challenge due to the absence of standardized
benchmarks and computational constraints. In this paper, we establish
Aesthetic-4K, a meticulously curated dataset containing dedicated training and
evaluation subsets specifically designed for comprehensive research on
ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. This dataset consists of high-quality 4K
images accompanied by descriptive captions generated by GPT-4o. Furthermore, we
propose Diffusion-4K, an innovative framework for the direct generation of
ultra-high-resolution images. Our approach incorporates the Scale Consistent
Variational Auto-Encoder (SC-VAE) and Wavelet-based Latent Fine-tuning (WLF),
which are designed for efficient visual token compression and the capture of
intricate details in ultra-high-resolution images, thereby facilitating direct
training with photorealistic 4K data. This method is applicable to various
latent diffusion models and demonstrates its efficacy in synthesizing highly
detailed 4K images. Additionally, we propose novel metrics, namely the GLCM
Score and Compression Ratio, to assess the texture richness and fine details in
local patches, in conjunction with holistic measures such as FID, Aesthetics,
and CLIPScore, enabling a thorough and multifaceted evaluation of
ultra-high-resolution image synthesis. Consequently, Diffusion-4K achieves
impressive performance in ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, particularly
when powered by state-of-the-art large-scale diffusion models (eg, Flux-12B).

Abstract: We aim to detect the class and orientation of a vehicle by training a model
with synthetic data. However, the distribution of the classes in the training
data is imbalanced, and the model trained on the synthetic image is difficult
to predict in real-world images. We propose a two-stage detection model with
photo-realistic image generation to tackle this issue. Our model mainly takes
four steps to detect the class and orientation of the vehicle. (1) It builds a
table containing the image, class, and location information of objects in the
image, (2) transforms the synthetic images into real-world images style, and
merges them into the meta table. (3) Classify vehicle class and orientation
using images from the meta-table. (4) Finally, the vehicle class and
orientation are detected by combining the pre-extracted location information
and the predicted classes. We achieved 4th place in IEEE BigData Challenge 2022
Vehicle class and Orientation Detection (VOD) with our approach.

Motivation: 卷积神经网络在分类任务中表现优异，但在恶劣天气条件下拍摄的低对比度图像上性能下降。传统直方图均衡化（HE）使用均匀分布作为目标分布，但本文假设单一优化设计的目标分布可能更有效。

Method: 提出了一种可微分且参数化的HM方法，通过下游分类器的损失函数优化目标分布，仅使用正常天气图像进行训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用该方法预处理的分类器在恶劣天气条件下优于传统预处理方法。

Conclusion: 优化设计的HM目标分布能有效提升分类器在低对比度图像上的性能。

Abstract: This paper rethinks image histogram matching (HM) and proposes a
differentiable and parametric HM preprocessing for a downstream classifier.
Convolutional neural networks have demonstrated remarkable achievements in
classification tasks. However, they often exhibit degraded performance on
low-contrast images captured under adverse weather conditions. To maintain
classifier performance under low-contrast images, histogram equalization (HE)
is commonly used. HE is a special case of HM using a uniform distribution as a
target pixel value distribution. In this paper, we focus on the shape of the
target pixel value distribution. Compared to a uniform distribution, a single,
well-designed distribution could have potential to improve the performance of
the downstream classifier across various adverse weather conditions. Based on
this hypothesis, we propose a differentiable and parametric HM that optimizes
the target distribution using the loss function of the downstream classifier.
This method addresses pixel value imbalances by transforming input images with
arbitrary distributions into a target distribution optimized for the
classifier. Our HM is trained on only normal weather images using the
classifier. Experimental results show that a classifier trained with our
proposed HM outperforms conventional preprocessing methods under adverse
weather conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有损失函数（如二元交叉熵和IoU损失）在训练分割模型时，虽然能提取像素级特征或全局图像上下文，但无法有效提升局部区域检测性能及对小尺度低对比度目标的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出TDA损失，引入基于块的机制和自适应调整策略，以优化模型对小尺度低对比度目标的关注。

Result: 在三个IRSTD数据集上的实验表明，TDA损失优于现有损失函数。

Conclusion: TDA损失通过聚焦局部区域和优化对小尺度低对比度目标的处理，显著提升了IRSTD的性能。

Abstract: We propose a target driven adaptive (TDA) loss to enhance the performance of
infrared small target detection (IRSTD). Prior works have used loss functions,
such as binary cross-entropy loss and IoU loss, to train segmentation models
for IRSTD. Minimizing these loss functions guides models to extract pixel-level
features or global image context. However, they have two issues: improving
detection performance for local regions around the targets and enhancing
robustness to small scale and low local contrast. To address these issues, the
proposed TDA loss introduces a patch-based mechanism, and an adaptive
adjustment strategy to scale and local contrast. The proposed TDA loss leads
the model to focus on local regions around the targets and pay particular
attention to targets with smaller scales and lower local contrast. We evaluate
the proposed method on three datasets for IRSTD. The results demonstrate that
the proposed TDA loss achieves better detection performance than existing
losses on these datasets.

Motivation: 现有去雨模型使用单一网络处理所有雨图像，但不同雨模式差异显著，单一网络难以应对多样性雨滴和雨线。

Result: 在多个数据集上达到最优性能，尤其在复杂混合数据集中表现突出。

Conclusion: CLIP-RPN通过自适应子网络路由和动态优化机制，显著提升了模型对多样性降雨条件的处理能力。

Abstract: Existing deraining models process all rainy images within a single network.
However, different rain patterns have significant variations, which makes it
challenging for a single network to handle diverse types of raindrops and
streaks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CLIP-driven rain
perception network (CLIP-RPN) that leverages CLIP to automatically perceive
rain patterns by computing visual-language matching scores and adaptively
routing to sub-networks to handle different rain patterns, such as varying
raindrop densities, streak orientations, and rainfall intensity. CLIP-RPN
establishes semantic-aware rain pattern recognition through CLIP's cross-modal
visual-language alignment capabilities, enabling automatic identification of
precipitation characteristics across different rain scenarios. This rain
pattern awareness drives an adaptive subnetwork routing mechanism where
specialized processing branches are dynamically activated based on the detected
rain type, significantly enhancing the model's capacity to handle diverse
rainfall conditions. Furthermore, within sub-networks of CLIP-RPN, we introduce
a mask-guided cross-attention mechanism (MGCA) that predicts precise rain masks
at multi-scale to facilitate contextual interactions between rainy regions and
clean background areas by cross-attention. We also introduces a dynamic loss
scheduling mechanism (DLS) to adaptively adjust the gradients for the
optimization process of CLIP-RPN. Compared with the commonly used $l_1$ or
$l_2$ loss, DLS is more compatible with the inherent dynamics of the network
training process, thus achieving enhanced outcomes. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, particularly excelling
in complex mixed datasets.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了长尾食物分类问题，通过合成数据增强提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based food image classification enables precise identification
of food categories, further facilitating accurate nutritional analysis.
However, real-world food images often show a skewed distribution, with some
food types being more prevalent than others. This class imbalance can be
problematic, causing models to favor the majority (head) classes with overall
performance degradation for the less common (tail) classes. Recently, synthetic
data augmentation using diffusion-based generative models has emerged as a
promising solution to address this issue. By generating high-quality synthetic
images, these models can help uniformize the data distribution, potentially
improving classification performance. However, existing approaches face
challenges: fine-tuning-based methods need a uniformly distributed dataset,
while pre-trained model-based approaches often overlook inter-class separation
in synthetic data. In this paper, we propose a two-stage synthetic data
augmentation framework, leveraging pre-trained diffusion models for long-tailed
food classification. We generate a reference set conditioned by a positive
prompt on the generation target and then select a class that shares similar
features with the generation target as a negative prompt. Subsequently, we
generate a synthetic augmentation set using positive and negative prompt
conditions by a combined sampling strategy that promotes intra-class diversity
and inter-class separation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method
on two long-tailed food benchmark datasets, achieving superior performance
compared to previous works in terms of top-1 accuracy.

Conclusion: PointT2I是首个利用LLM实现关键点引导图像生成的框架，显著提升了复杂姿势生成的准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation model has made significant advancements,
resulting in high-quality images aligned with an input prompt. However, despite
T2I generation's ability to generate fine-grained images, it still faces
challenges in accurately generating images when the input prompt contains
complex concepts, especially human pose. In this paper, we propose PointT2I, a
framework that effectively generates images that accurately correspond to the
human pose described in the prompt by using a large language model (LLM).
PointT2I consists of three components: Keypoint generation, Image generation,
and Feedback system. The keypoint generation uses an LLM to directly generate
keypoints corresponding to a human pose, solely based on the input prompt,
without external references. Subsequently, the image generation produces images
based on both the text prompt and the generated keypoints to accurately reflect
the target pose. To refine the outputs of the preceding stages, we incorporate
an LLM-based feedback system that assesses the semantic consistency between the
generated contents and the given prompts. Our framework is the first approach
to leveraging LLM for keypoints-guided image generation without any
fine-tuning, producing accurate pose-aligned images based solely on textual
prompts.

*Peiyao Wang,Haibin Ling*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SVQA-R1通过引入Spatial-GRPO策略，提升视觉语言模型在空间视觉问答任务中的表现，无需监督微调数据即可实现高精度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在空间推理能力上表现不足，尤其是在需要理解相对位置、距离和物体配置的空间视觉问答任务中。

Method: 提出SVQA-R1框架，采用Spatial-GRPO策略，通过扰动物体间空间关系（如镜像翻转）构建视图一致的奖励，强化模型对空间的理解。

Result: SVQA-R1在多个空间推理基准测试中显著提升准确率，并展示出可解释的推理路径。

Conclusion: SVQA-R1通过规则强化学习有效提升了模型的空间推理能力，且无需监督微调数据。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning remains a critical yet underdeveloped capability in
existing vision-language models (VLMs), especially for Spatial Visual Question
Answering (Spatial VQA) tasks that require understanding relative positions,
distances, and object configurations. Inspired by the R1 paradigm introduced in
DeepSeek-R1, which enhances reasoning in language models through rule-based
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose SVQA-R1, the first framework to extend
R1-style training to spatial VQA. In particular, we introduce Spatial-GRPO, a
novel group-wise RL strategy that constructs view-consistent rewards by
perturbing spatial relations between objects, e.g., mirror flipping, thereby
encouraging the model to develop a consistent and grounded understanding of
space. Our model, SVQA-R1, not only achieves dramatically improved accuracy on
spatial VQA benchmarks but also exhibits interpretable reasoning paths even
without using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data. Extensive experiments and
visualization demonstrate the effectiveness of SVQA-R1 across multiple spatial
reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体育分析中的多目标跟踪面临快速运动、遮挡和相机移动等挑战，传统方法需要大量调参或难以处理轨迹。

Method: McByte结合了时间传播的分割掩码作为关联线索，无需训练，仅依赖预训练模型和通用目标检测器。

Result: 在SportsMOT、DanceTrack、SoccerNet-tracking 2022和MOT17等数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: McByte展示了掩码传播在提升多目标跟踪适应性和泛化能力方面的优势。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is essential for sports analytics, enabling
performance evaluation and tactical insights. However, tracking in sports is
challenging due to fast movements, occlusions, and camera shifts. Traditional
tracking-by-detection methods require extensive tuning, while
segmentation-based approaches struggle with track processing. We propose
McByte, a tracking-by-detection framework that integrates temporally propagated
segmentation mask as an association cue to improve robustness without per-video
tuning. Unlike many existing methods, McByte does not require training, relying
solely on pre-trained models and object detectors commonly used in the
community. Evaluated on SportsMOT, DanceTrack, SoccerNet-tracking 2022 and
MOT17, McByte demonstrates strong performance across sports and general
pedestrian tracking. Our results highlight the benefits of mask propagation for
a more adaptable and generalizable MOT approach. Code will be made available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达在恶劣天气中表现优异，但现有雷达神经表示在噪声场景下效果不佳，无法合成真实雷达数据。

Result: PSNR提升3.4，SSIM提高2.6倍；几何重建误差降低40%，精度提高1.5倍。

Conclusion: RadarSplat能高效生成高保真雷达数据并提升场景重建质量。

Abstract: High-Fidelity 3D scene reconstruction plays a crucial role in autonomous
driving by enabling novel data generation from existing datasets. This allows
simulating safety-critical scenarios and augmenting training datasets without
incurring further data collection costs. While recent advances in radiance
fields have demonstrated promising results in 3D reconstruction and sensor data
synthesis using cameras and LiDAR, their potential for radar remains largely
unexplored. Radar is crucial for autonomous driving due to its robustness in
adverse weather conditions like rain, fog, and snow, where optical sensors
often struggle. Although the state-of-the-art radar-based neural representation
shows promise for 3D driving scene reconstruction, it performs poorly in
scenarios with significant radar noise, including receiver saturation and
multipath reflection. Moreover, it is limited to synthesizing preprocessed,
noise-excluded radar images, failing to address realistic radar data synthesis.
To address these limitations, this paper proposes RadarSplat, which integrates
Gaussian Splatting with novel radar noise modeling to enable realistic radar
data synthesis and enhanced 3D reconstruction. Compared to the
state-of-the-art, RadarSplat achieves superior radar image synthesis (+3.4 PSNR
/ 2.6x SSIM) and improved geometric reconstruction (-40% RMSE / 1.5x Accuracy),
demonstrating its effectiveness in generating high-fidelity radar data and
scene reconstruction. A project page is available at

Motivation: 解决自回归视频模型在实时视频生成中的高计算成本和硬件效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出Next-Frame Diffusion (NFD)，结合块级因果注意力和并行令牌生成；引入一致性蒸馏和推测采样技术优化推理效率。

Result: 在动作条件视频生成基准测试中，NFD在视觉质量和采样效率上优于基线模型，首次实现30 FPS的实时生成。

Conclusion: NFD通过技术创新显著提升了自回归视频模型的实时生成能力，为交互式视频内容和流媒体应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive video models offer distinct advantages over bidirectional
diffusion models in creating interactive video content and supporting streaming
applications with arbitrary duration. In this work, we present Next-Frame
Diffusion (NFD), an autoregressive diffusion transformer that incorporates
block-wise causal attention, enabling iterative sampling and efficient
inference via parallel token generation within each frame. Nonetheless,
achieving real-time video generation remains a significant challenge for such
models, primarily due to the high computational cost associated with diffusion
sampling and the hardware inefficiencies inherent to autoregressive generation.
To address this, we introduce two innovations: (1) We extend consistency
distillation to the video domain and adapt it specifically for video models,
enabling efficient inference with few sampling steps; (2) To fully leverage
parallel computation, motivated by the observation that adjacent frames often
share the identical action input, we propose speculative sampling. In this
approach, the model generates next few frames using current action input, and
discard speculatively generated frames if the input action differs. Experiments
on a large-scale action-conditioned video generation benchmark demonstrate that
NFD beats autoregressive baselines in terms of both visual quality and sampling
efficiency. We, for the first time, achieves autoregressive video generation at
over 30 Frames Per Second (FPS) on an A100 GPU using a 310M model.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成和真实图像上均能有效实现3D重建。

Conclusion: 所提技术显著提升了主动立体系统的灵活性和实用性，适用于动态场景下的3D形状测量。

Abstract: Active-stereo-based 3D shape measurement is crucial for various purposes,
such as industrial inspection, reverse engineering, and medical systems, due to
its strong ability to accurately acquire the shape of textureless objects.
Active stereo systems typically consist of a camera and a pattern projector,
tightly fixed to each other, and precise calibration between a camera and a
projector is required, which in turn decreases the usability of the system. If
a camera and a projector can be freely moved during shape scanning process, it
will drastically increase the convenience of the usability of the system. To
realize it, we propose a technique to recover the shape of the target object by
capturing multiple images while both the camera and the projector are in
motion, and their relative poses are auto-calibrated by our neural
signed-distance-field (NeuralSDF) using novel volumetric differential rendering
technique. In the experiment, the proposed method is evaluated by performing 3D
reconstruction using both synthetic and real images.

Result: 在四个PAR基准测试中表现优异，推理高效。

Conclusion: ViTA-PAR通过多模态提示和对齐技术，显著提升了行人属性识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: The Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) task aims to identify various
detailed attributes of an individual, such as clothing, accessories, and
gender. To enhance PAR performance, a model must capture features ranging from
coarse-grained global attributes (e.g., for identifying gender) to fine-grained
local details (e.g., for recognizing accessories) that may appear in diverse
regions. Recent research suggests that body part representation can enhance the
model's robustness and accuracy, but these methods are often restricted to
attribute classes within fixed horizontal regions, leading to degraded
performance when attributes appear in varying or unexpected body locations. In
this paper, we propose Visual and Textual Attribute Alignment with Attribute
Prompting for Pedestrian Attribute Recognition, dubbed as ViTA-PAR, to enhance
attribute recognition through specialized multimodal prompting and
vision-language alignment. We introduce visual attribute prompts that capture
global-to-local semantics, enabling diverse attribute representations. To
enrich textual embeddings, we design a learnable prompt template, termed person
and attribute context prompting, to learn person and attributes context.
Finally, we align visual and textual attribute features for effective fusion.
ViTA-PAR is validated on four PAR benchmarks, achieving competitive performance
with efficient inference. We release our code and model at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过激励推理来提升大语言模型（LLM）处理复杂指令能力的方法，解决了传统思维链（CoT）在多层约束下表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在处理复杂指令时表现不佳，尤其是当指令包含多层并行、链式或分支结构时。传统思维链（CoT）方法因仅简单复述指令而效果有限。

Method: 1. 基于现有分类法分解复杂指令并提出可复现的数据获取方法；2. 利用强化学习（RL）和基于规则的奖励信号培养推理能力；3. 通过样本对比和行为克隆优化推理过程。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，1.5B参数的LLM性能提升11.74%，接近8B参数模型的水平。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了LLM处理复杂指令的能力，验证了激励推理和强化学习的有效性。

Abstract: Existing large language models (LLMs) face challenges of following complex
instructions, especially when multiple constraints are present and organized in
paralleling, chaining, and branching structures. One intuitive solution, namely
chain-of-thought (CoT), is expected to universally improve capabilities of
LLMs. However, we find that the vanilla CoT exerts a negative impact on
performance due to its superficial reasoning pattern of simply paraphrasing the
instructions. It fails to peel back the compositions of constraints for
identifying their relationship across hierarchies of types and dimensions. To
this end, we propose a systematic method to boost LLMs in dealing with complex
instructions via incentivizing reasoning for test-time compute scaling. First,
we stem from the decomposition of complex instructions under existing
taxonomies and propose a reproducible data acquisition method. Second, we
exploit reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rule-centric reward signals
to cultivate reasoning specifically for instruction following. We address the
shallow, non-essential nature of reasoning under complex instructions via
sample-wise contrast for superior CoT enforcement. We also exploit behavior
cloning of experts to facilitate steady distribution shift from fast-thinking
LLMs to skillful reasoners. Extensive evaluations on seven comprehensive
benchmarks confirm the validity of the proposed method, where a 1.5B LLM
achieves 11.74% gains with performance comparable to a 8B LLM. Codes and data
are available at https://github.com/yuleiqin/RAIF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型和rectified flow (RF)的方法在图像编辑中因噪声累积导致重建精度下降，需要改进。

Method: 提出DNA方法，直接在噪声域中优化高斯噪声，减少误差累积；引入MVG控制生成过程，平衡编辑与背景保留。

Result: 实验证明DNAEdit在文本引导的图像编辑任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DNAEdit通过DNA和MVG的结合，显著提升了图像编辑的性能和灵活性。

Abstract: Leveraging the powerful generation capability of large-scale pretrained
text-to-image models, training-free methods have demonstrated impressive image
editing results. Conventional diffusion-based methods, as well as recent
rectified flow (RF)-based methods, typically reverse synthesis trajectories by
gradually adding noise to clean images, during which the noisy latent at the
current timestep is used to approximate that at the next timesteps, introducing
accumulated drift and degrading reconstruction accuracy. Considering the fact
that in RF the noisy latent is estimated through direct interpolation between
Gaussian noises and clean images at each timestep, we propose Direct Noise
Alignment (DNA), which directly refines the desired Gaussian noise in the noise
domain, significantly reducing the error accumulation in previous methods.
Specifically, DNA estimates the velocity field of the interpolated noised
latent at each timestep and adjusts the Gaussian noise by computing the
difference between the predicted and expected velocity field. We validate the
effectiveness of DNA and reveal its relationship with existing RF-based
inversion methods. Additionally, we introduce a Mobile Velocity Guidance (MVG)
to control the target prompt-guided generation process, balancing image
background preservation and target object editability. DNA and MVG collectively
constitute our proposed method, namely DNAEdit. Finally, we introduce
DNA-Bench, a long-prompt benchmark, to evaluate the performance of advanced
image editing models. Experimental results demonstrate that our DNAEdit
achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art text-guided editing methods.

Result: 实验证明该方法能高效且精确地实现像素级颜色编辑，确保颜色传播内容感知。

Conclusion: 提出的语义调色板方法克服了传统方法的局限性，实现了更自然的颜色传播效果。

Abstract: Color propagation aims to extend local color edits to similar regions across
the input image. Conventional approaches often rely on low-level visual cues
such as color, texture, or lightness to measure pixel similarity, making it
difficult to achieve content-aware color propagation. While some recent
approaches attempt to introduce semantic information into color editing, but
often lead to unnatural, global color change in color adjustments. To overcome
these limitations, we present a semantic palette-guided approach for color
propagation. We first extract a semantic palette from an input image. Then, we
solve an edited palette by minimizing a well-designed energy function based on
user edits. Finally, local edits are accurately propagated to regions that
share similar semantics via the solved palette. Our approach enables efficient
yet accurate pixel-level color editing and ensures that local color changes are
propagated in a content-aware manner. Extensive experiments demonstrated the
effectiveness of our method.

encoder, the overall coarse-to-fine framework and the training loss, we succeed
to design a scene flow approach that outperforms the current state of the art
on KITTI and Spring by 8.7%(3.89 vs. 4.26) and 65.8% (9.13 vs. 26.71),

Abstract: Sonar imaging is fundamental to underwater exploration, with critical
applications in defense, navigation, and marine research. Shadow regions, in
particular, provide essential cues for object detection and classification, yet
existing studies primarily focus on highlight-based analysis, leaving
shadow-based classification underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a

image processing techniques to extract and integrate discriminative shadow and
highlight features. Our framework introduces a novel shadow-specific classifier
and adaptive shadow segmentation, enabling effective classification based on
the dominant region. This approach ensures optimal feature representation,
improving robustness against noise and occlusions. In addition, we introduce a
Region-aware denoising model that enhances sonar image quality by preserving
critical structural details while suppressing noise. This model incorporates an
explainability-driven optimization strategy, ensuring that denoising is guided
by feature importance, thereby improving interpretability and classification
reliability. Furthermore, we present S3Simulator+, an extended dataset
incorporating naval mine scenarios with physics-informed noise specifically
tailored for the underwater sonar domain, fostering the development of robust
AI models. By combining novel classification strategies with an enhanced

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have revolutionized video generation,
enabling the creation of high-quality, temporally consistent videos. However,
generating high frame-rate (FPS) videos remains a significant challenge due to
issues such as flickering and degradation in long sequences, particularly in
fast-motion scenarios. Existing methods often suffer from computational
inefficiencies and limitations in maintaining video quality over extended
frames. In this paper, we present a novel, training-free approach for high FPS
video generation using pre-trained diffusion models. Our method, DiffuseSlide,
introduces a new pipeline that leverages key frames from low FPS videos and
applies innovative techniques, including noise re-injection and sliding window
latent denoising, to achieve smooth, consistent video outputs without the need
for additional fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
our approach significantly improves video quality, offering enhanced temporal
coherence and spatial fidelity. The proposed method is not only computationally
efficient but also adaptable to various video generation tasks, making it ideal
for applications such as virtual reality, video games, and high-quality content
creation.

Abstract: Video anomaly retrieval aims to localize anomalous events in videos using
natural language queries to facilitate public safety. However, existing
datasets suffer from severe limitations: (1) data scarcity due to the long-tail
nature of real-world anomalies, and (2) privacy constraints that impede
large-scale collection. To address the aforementioned issues in one go, we
introduce SVTA (Synthetic Video-Text Anomaly benchmark), the first large-scale
dataset for cross-modal anomaly retrieval, leveraging generative models to
overcome data availability challenges. Specifically, we collect and generate
video descriptions via the off-the-shelf LLM (Large Language Model) covering 68
anomaly categories, e.g., throwing, stealing, and shooting. These descriptions
encompass common long-tail events. We adopt these texts to guide the video
generative model to produce diverse and high-quality videos. Finally, our SVTA
involves 41,315 videos (1.36M frames) with paired captions, covering 30 normal
activities, e.g., standing, walking, and sports, and 68 anomalous events, e.g.,
falling, fighting, theft, explosions, and natural disasters. We adopt three
widely-used video-text retrieval baselines to comprehensively test our SVTA,
revealing SVTA's challenging nature and its effectiveness in evaluating a
robust cross-modal retrieval method. SVTA eliminates privacy risks associated
with real-world anomaly collection while maintaining realistic scenarios. The

Abstract: Accurately recognizing and assessing pain in sheep is key to discern animal
health and mitigating harmful situations. However, such accuracy is limited by
the ability to manage automatic monitoring of pain in those animals. Facial
expression scoring is a widely used and useful method to evaluate pain in both
humans and other living beings. Researchers also analyzed the facial
expressions of sheep to assess their health state and concluded that facial
landmark detection and pain level prediction are essential. For this purpose,
we propose a novel weighted graph neural network (WGNN) model to link sheep's
detected facial landmarks and define pain levels. Furthermore, we propose a new
sheep facial landmarks dataset that adheres to the parameters of the Sheep
Facial Expression Scale (SPFES). Currently, there is no comprehensive
performance benchmark that specifically evaluates the use of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on sheep facial landmark data to detect and measure pain
levels. The YOLOv8n detector architecture achieves a mean average precision
(mAP) of 59.30% with the sheep facial landmarks dataset, among seven other
detection models. The WGNN framework has an accuracy of 92.71% for tracking
multiple facial parts expressions with the YOLOv8n lightweight on-board device
deployment-capable model.

Motivation: 手术视频标注耗时费力，研究旨在利用未标注数据实现高性能，填补半监督学习在手术领域的空白。

Method: 采用视频Transformer模型，结合时间一致性正则化和对比学习，利用伪标签优化特征空间。

Result: 在RAMIE数据集上准确率提升4.9%，在Cholec80上仅用1/4标注数据即达到全监督可比结果。

Conclusion: 为半监督手术阶段识别设定了新基准，推动了该领域未来研究。

Abstract: Accurate surgical phase recognition is crucial for computer-assisted
interventions and surgical video analysis. Annotating long surgical videos is
labor-intensive, driving research toward leveraging unlabeled data for strong
performance with minimal annotations. Although self-supervised learning has
gained popularity by enabling large-scale pretraining followed by fine-tuning
on small labeled subsets, semi-supervised approaches remain largely
underexplored in the surgical domain. In this work, we propose a video
transformer-based model with a robust pseudo-labeling framework. Our method
incorporates temporal consistency regularization for unlabeled data and
contrastive learning with class prototypes, which leverages both labeled data
and pseudo-labels to refine the feature space. Through extensive experiments on
the private RAMIE (Robot-Assisted Minimally Invasive Esophagectomy) dataset and
the public Cholec80 dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
By incorporating unlabeled data, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on
RAMIE with a 4.9% accuracy increase and obtain comparable results to full
supervision while using only 1/4 of the labeled data on Cholec80. Our findings
establish a strong benchmark for semi-supervised surgical phase recognition,
paving the way for future research in this domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs中视觉理解和生成能力相互独立，未能充分利用LLM的推理机制改进图像生成。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：监督微调教授生成真实CoT能力，强化学习通过探索-利用权衡激活潜力。

Result: 模型在文本到图像生成、图像编辑和图像语义评估方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了视觉理解和生成的协同进化，推动了MLLMs的统一图像生成能力。

Abstract: Recent endeavors in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) aim to unify
visual comprehension and generation. However, these two capabilities remain
largely independent, as if they are two separate functions encapsulated within
the same model. Consequently, visual comprehension does not enhance visual
generation, and the reasoning mechanisms of LLMs have not been fully integrated
to revolutionize image generation. In this paper, we propose to enable the
collaborative co-evolution of visual comprehension and generation, advancing
image generation into an iterative introspective process. We introduce a
two-stage training approach: supervised fine-tuning teaches the MLLM with the
foundational ability to generate genuine CoT for visual generation, while
reinforcement learning activates its full potential via an
exploration-exploitation trade-off. Ultimately, we unlock the Aha moment in
visual generation, advancing MLLMs from text-to-image tasks to unified image
generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model not only excels in
text-to-image generation and image editing, but also functions as a superior
image semantic evaluator with enhanced visual comprehension capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能有效建模实体和关系的动态变化，限制了视频场景理解。

Method: FDSG框架结合查询分解和神经随机微分方程建模动态，并通过跨注意力整合预测与观察信息。

Result: 在Action Genome数据集上，FDSG在动态场景图生成、预测和前瞻任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FDSG为未来场景图预测任务提供了新基准，并展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Dynamic scene graph generation extends scene graph generation from images to
videos by modeling entity relationships and their temporal evolution. However,
existing methods either generate scene graphs from observed frames without
explicitly modeling temporal dynamics, or predict only relationships while
assuming static entity labels and locations. These limitations hinder effective
extrapolation of both entity and relationship dynamics, restricting video scene
understanding. We propose Forecasting Dynamic Scene Graphs (FDSG), a novel
framework that predicts future entity labels, bounding boxes, and
relationships, for unobserved frames, while also generating scene graphs for
observed frames. Our scene graph forecast module leverages query decomposition
and neural stochastic differential equations to model entity and relationship
dynamics. A temporal aggregation module further refines predictions by
integrating forecasted and observed information via cross-attention. To
benchmark FDSG, we introduce Scene Graph Forecasting, a new task for full
future scene graph prediction. Experiments on Action Genome show that FDSG
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on dynamic scene graph generation, scene
graph anticipation, and scene graph forecasting. Codes will be released upon
publication.

TL;DR: SCAD模型通过结合预训练模型和双判别器设计，显著降低了训练成本，同时提升了生成多样性和样本保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低大规模GAN训练成本，同时避免生成多样性的损失。

Method: 使用两个专用判别器和Slicing Adversarial Networks (SANs) 设计SCAD模型，并提出Per-Prompt Diversity (PPD) 指标。

Result: SCAD在训练成本降低两个数量级的同时，零样本FID与最新大规模GAN相当。

Conclusion: SCAD实现了高效且高保真的文本到图像生成，未妥协于多样性或成本。

Abstract: Recently, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been successfully
scaled to billion-scale large text-to-image datasets. However, training such
models entails a high training cost, limiting some applications and research
usage. To reduce the cost, one promising direction is the incorporation of
pre-trained models. The existing method of utilizing pre-trained models for a
generator significantly reduced the training cost compared with the other
large-scale GANs, but we found the model loses the diversity of generation for
a given prompt by a large margin. To build an efficient and high-fidelity
text-to-image GAN without compromise, we propose to use two specialized
discriminators with Slicing Adversarial Networks (SANs) adapted for
text-to-image tasks. Our proposed model, called SCAD, shows a notable
enhancement in diversity for a given prompt with better sample fidelity. We
also propose to use a metric called Per-Prompt Diversity (PPD) to evaluate the
diversity of text-to-image models quantitatively. SCAD achieved a zero-shot FID
competitive with the latest large-scale GANs at two orders of magnitude less
training cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型偏好对齐主要关注良性人类偏好（如审美），而对抗性偏好对齐（如视觉一致性与攻击效果）存在冲突，导致优化不稳定。

Method: APA框架分两阶段：1）使用LoRA微调提升视觉一致性；2）基于替代分类器反馈优化图像潜在或提示嵌入，并结合扩散增强策略。

Result: APA在保持高视觉一致性的同时显著提升攻击迁移能力。

Conclusion: APA为对抗性攻击研究提供了新的对齐视角，代码将开源。

Abstract: Preference alignment in diffusion models has primarily focused on benign
human preferences (e.g., aesthetic). In this paper, we propose a novel
perspective: framing unrestricted adversarial example generation as a problem
of aligning with adversary preferences. Unlike benign alignment, adversarial
alignment involves two inherently conflicting preferences: visual consistency
and attack effectiveness, which often lead to unstable optimization and reward
hacking (e.g., reducing visual quality to improve attack success). To address
this, we propose APA (Adversary Preferences Alignment), a two-stage framework
that decouples conflicting preferences and optimizes each with differentiable
rewards. In the first stage, APA fine-tunes LoRA to improve visual consistency
using rule-based similarity reward. In the second stage, APA updates either the
image latent or prompt embedding based on feedback from a substitute
classifier, guided by trajectory-level and step-wise rewards. To enhance
black-box transferability, we further incorporate a diffusion augmentation
strategy. Experiments demonstrate that APA achieves significantly better attack
transferability while maintaining high visual consistency, inspiring further
research to approach adversarial attacks from an alignment perspective. Code
will be available at https://github.com/deep-kaixun/APA.

Motivation: ViT模型在图像嵌入提取中表现出色，但计算负担高，需要一种方法在不牺牲性能的情况下加速模型。

Method: ATF方法包含一个令牌过滤模块和过滤策略，动态保留特定对象类型的令牌，静态保留高注意力区域的令牌，无需修改或微调编码器。

Result: 在检索任务中，ATF将ViT模型SigLIP的速度提升了2.8倍，同时保持了检索召回率。

Conclusion: ATF是一种有效的ViT加速方法，能够在保持性能的同时显著减少计算负担。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) models have made breakthroughs in image embedding
extraction, which provide state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as
zero-shot image classification. However, the models suffer from a high
computational burden. In this paper, we propose a novel speed-up method for ViT
models called Attention-aware Token Filtering (ATF). ATF consists of two main
ideas: a novel token filtering module and a filtering strategy. The token
filtering module is introduced between a tokenizer and a transformer encoder of
the ViT model, without modifying or fine-tuning of the transformer encoder. The
module filters out tokens inputted to the encoder so that it keeps tokens in
regions of specific object types dynamically and keeps tokens in regions that
statically receive high attention in the transformer encoder. This filtering
strategy maintains task accuracy while filtering out tokens inputted to the
transformer encoder. Evaluation results on retrieval tasks show that ATF
provides $2.8\times$ speed-up to a ViT model, SigLIP, while maintaining the
retrieval recall rate.

Conclusion: 种族标签的连续化处理能更有效地解决数据偏见问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Bias has been a constant in face recognition models. Over the years,
researchers have looked at it from both the model and the data point of view.
However, their approach to mitigation of data bias was limited and lacked
insight on the real nature of the problem. Here, in this document, we propose
to revise our use of ethnicity labels as a continuous variable instead of a
discrete value per identity. We validate our formulation both experimentally
and theoretically, showcasing that not all identities from one ethnicity
contribute equally to the balance of the dataset; thus, having the same number
of identities per ethnicity does not represent a balanced dataset. We further
show that models trained on datasets balanced in the continuous space
consistently outperform models trained on data balanced in the discrete space.
We trained more than 65 different models, and created more than 20 subsets of
the original datasets.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of utilizing a large-scale text-to-image
diffusion model to tackle the challenging Inexact Segmentation (IS) task.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely heavily on discriminative-model-based
paradigms or dense visual representations derived from internal attention
mechanisms, our method focuses on the intrinsic generative priors in Stable
Diffusion~(SD). Specifically, we exploit the pattern discrepancies between
original images and mask-conditional generated images to facilitate a
coarse-to-fine segmentation refinement by establishing a semantic
correspondence alignment and updating the foreground probability. Comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness and
superiority of our plug-and-play design, underscoring the potential of
leveraging generation discrepancies to model dense representations and
encouraging further exploration of generative approaches for solving
discriminative tasks.

Result: 在NuScenes基准测试中，FVD提升27%，推理时间减少85%，能生成110+帧的长视频。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了长期视频生成的连贯性问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Driving world models are used to simulate futures by video generation based
on the condition of the current state and actions. However, current models
often suffer serious error accumulations when predicting the long-term future,
which limits the practical application. Recent studies utilize the Diffusion
Transformer (DiT) as the backbone of driving world models to improve learning
flexibility. However, these models are always trained on short video clips
(high fps and short duration), and multiple roll-out generations struggle to
produce consistent and reasonable long videos due to the training-inference
gap. To this end, we propose several solutions to build a simple yet effective
long-term driving world model. First, we hierarchically decouple world model
learning into large motion learning and bidirectional continuous motion
learning. Then, considering the continuity of driving scenes, we propose a
simple distillation method where fine-grained video flows are self-supervised
signals for coarse-grained flows. The distillation is designed to improve the
coherence of infinite video generation. The coarse-grained and fine-grained
modules are coordinated to generate long-term and temporally coherent videos.
In the public benchmark NuScenes, compared with the state-of-the-art front-view
model, our model improves FVD by $27\%$ and reduces inference time by $85\%$
for the video task of generating 110+ frames. More videos (including 90s
duration) are available at https://Wang-Xiaodong1899.github.io/longdwm/.

Result: 在VLN基准测试中表现优于现有LLM-based方法。

Conclusion: EvolveNav通过结合形式化CoT和自我反思训练，显著提升了导航决策的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Building Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents which can navigate following
natural language instructions is a long-standing goal in human-robot
interaction applications. Recent studies have revealed the potential of
training open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to unleash LLMs' reasoning
ability for improving navigation, and simultaneously mitigate the domain gap
between LLMs' training corpus and the VLN task. However, these approaches
primarily adopt direct input-output mapping paradigms, causing the mapping
learning difficult and the navigational decisions unexplainable.
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training is a promising way to improve both navigational
decision accuracy and interpretability, while the complexity of the navigation
task makes the perfect CoT labels unavailable and may lead to overfitting
through pure CoT supervised fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose a novel
sElf-improving embodied reasoning framework for boosting LLM-based
vision-language Navigation, dubbed EvolveNav. Our EvolveNav consists of two
stages: (1) Formalized CoT Supervised Fine-Tuning, where we train the model
with formalized CoT labels to both activate the model's navigational reasoning
capabilities and increase the reasoning speed; (2) Self-Reflective
Post-Training, where the model is iteratively trained with its own reasoning
outputs as self-enriched CoT labels to enhance the supervision diversity. A
self-reflective auxiliary task is also introduced to encourage learning correct
reasoning patterns by contrasting with wrong ones. Experimental results on the
popular VLN benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of EvolveNav over previous
LLM-based VLN approaches. Code is available at

Result: 在Ref-AVS基准上，SAM2-LOVE比SOTA方法提升了8.5%的J&F分数。

Conclusion: SAM2-LOVE框架简单有效，显著提升了多模态场景理解的性能。

Abstract: Reference Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to provide a pixel-wise
scene understanding in Language-aided Audio-Visual Scenes (LAVS). This task
requires the model to continuously segment objects referred to by text and
audio from a video. Previous dual-modality methods always fail due to the lack
of a third modality and the existing triple-modality method struggles with
spatio-temporal consistency, leading to the target shift of different frames.
In this work, we introduce a novel framework, termed SAM2-LOVE, which
integrates textual, audio, and visual representations into a learnable token to
prompt and align SAM2 for achieving Ref-AVS in the LAVS. Technically, our
approach includes a multimodal fusion module aimed at improving multimodal
understanding of SAM2, as well as token propagation and accumulation strategies
designed to enhance spatio-temporal consistency without forgetting historical
information. We conducted extensive experiments to demonstrate that SAM2-LOVE
outperforms the SOTA by 8.5\% in $\mathcal{J\&F}$ on the Ref-AVS benchmark and
showcase the simplicity and effectiveness of the components. Our code will be

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在人类-物体交互中常忽略场景上下文，导致不合理的穿透；而人类-场景交互方法难以协调精细操作与长距离导航。

Method: HOSIG框架包含三个关键组件：场景感知抓取姿势生成器、启发式导航算法和场景引导运动扩散模型。

Result: 在TRUMANS数据集上的实验显示，HOSIG优于现有方法，支持无限运动长度且需最少人工干预。

Conclusion: HOSIG填补了场景感知导航与灵巧物体操作之间的关键空白，推动了交互合成的前沿。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity full-body human interactions with dynamic objects
and static scenes remains a critical challenge in computer graphics and
animation. Existing methods for human-object interaction often neglect scene
context, leading to implausible penetrations, while human-scene interaction
approaches struggle to coordinate fine-grained manipulations with long-range
navigation. To address these limitations, we propose HOSIG, a novel framework
for synthesizing full-body interactions through hierarchical scene perception.
Our method decouples the task into three key components: 1) a scene-aware grasp
pose generator that ensures collision-free whole-body postures with precise
hand-object contact by integrating local geometry constraints, 2) a heuristic
navigation algorithm that autonomously plans obstacle-avoiding paths in complex
indoor environments via compressed 2D floor maps and dual-component spatial
reasoning, and 3) a scene-guided motion diffusion model that generates
trajectory-controlled, full-body motions with finger-level accuracy by
incorporating spatial anchors and dual-space classifier-free guidance.
Extensive experiments on the TRUMANS dataset demonstrate superior performance
over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework supports unlimited motion
length through autoregressive generation and requires minimal manual
intervention. This work bridges the critical gap between scene-aware navigation
and dexterous object manipulation, advancing the frontier of embodied
interaction synthesis. Codes will be available after publication. Project page:

Conclusion: MDW通过高效数据蒸馏和噪声容忍，为多模态模型训练提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal models have shown remarkable versatility in real-world
applications. However, their rapid development encounters two critical data
challenges. First, the training process requires large-scale datasets, leading
to substantial storage and computational costs. Second, these data are
typically web-crawled with inevitable noise, i.e., partially mismatched pairs,
severely degrading model performance. To these ends, we propose Multi-modal
dataset Distillation in the Wild, i.e., MDW, the first framework to distill
noisy multi-modal datasets into compact clean ones for effective and efficient
model training. Specifically, MDW introduces learnable fine-grained
correspondences during distillation and adaptively optimizes distilled data to
emphasize correspondence-discriminative regions, thereby enhancing distilled
data's information density and efficacy. Moreover, to capture robust
cross-modal correspondence prior knowledge from real data, MDW proposes
dual-track collaborative learning to avoid the risky data noise, alleviating
information loss with certifiable noise tolerance. Extensive experiments
validate MDW's theoretical and empirical efficacy with remarkable scalability,
surpassing prior methods by over 15% across various compression ratios,
highlighting its appealing practicality for applications with diverse efficacy

IMUs, eye gaze, body and hand kinematics spanning 29.7 hours of 16 subjects
cooking four different recipes. Action sequences were densely annotated with
33.78 action segments per minute. Leveraging this multi-modal dataset, we
propose four benchmarks to advance behavior understanding and modeling through
1) a vision-language benchmark, 2) a semantic text-to-motion generation

Conclusion: SFAM填补了度量学习模型视觉解释的空白，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Visual explanation maps enhance the trustworthiness of decisions made by deep
learning models and offer valuable guidance for developing new algorithms in
image recognition tasks. Class activation maps (CAM) and their variants (e.g.,
Grad-CAM and Relevance-CAM) have been extensively employed to explore the
interpretability of softmax-based convolutional neural networks, which require
a fully connected layer as the classifier for decision-making. However, these
methods cannot be directly applied to metric learning models, as such models
lack a fully connected layer functioning as a classifier. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel visual explanation method termed Similar Feature
Activation Map (SFAM). This method introduces the channel-wise contribution
importance score (CIS) to measure feature importance, derived from the
similarity measurement between two image embeddings. The explanation map is
constructed by linearly combining the proposed importance weights with the
feature map from a CNN model. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show
that SFAM provides highly promising interpretable visual explanations for CNN
models using Euclidean distance or cosine similarity as the similarity metric.

*Xuan Yu,Dayan Guan,Michael Ying Yang,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Zoom-Refine是一种无需训练的MLLM增强方法，通过局部放大和自我优化提升高分辨率图像理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLM在高分辨率图像中难以捕捉细粒度细节的问题。

Method: 结合局部放大（Localized Zoom）和自我优化（Self-Refinement）步骤，利用MLLM自身能力进行区域定位和推理优化。

Result: 在两个高分辨率多模态基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: Zoom-Refine有效提升了MLLM对高分辨率图像的解析能力，无需额外训练或专家干预。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) often struggle to interpret
high-resolution images accurately, where fine-grained details are crucial for
complex visual understanding. We introduce Zoom-Refine, a novel training-free
method that enhances MLLM capabilities to address this issue. Zoom-Refine
operates through a synergistic process of \textit{Localized Zoom} and
\textit{Self-Refinement}. In the \textit{Localized Zoom} step, Zoom-Refine
leverages the MLLM to provide a preliminary response to an input query and
identifies the most task-relevant image region by predicting its bounding box
coordinates. During the \textit{Self-Refinement} step, Zoom-Refine then
integrates fine-grained details from the high-resolution crop (identified by
\textit{Localized Zoom}) with its initial reasoning to re-evaluate and refine
its preliminary response. Our method harnesses the MLLM's inherent capabilities
for spatial localization, contextual reasoning and comparative analysis without
requiring additional training or external experts. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of Zoom-Refine on two challenging high-resolution
multimodal benchmarks. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型（LMMs）在地球观测（EO）数据理解上表现不足，而EO数据对环境监测至关重要。

Method: EarthMind采用空间注意力提示（SAP）和跨模态融合技术，并引入EarthMind-Bench作为评估基准。

Result: EarthMind在EarthMind-Bench和多个公共EO基准测试中表现优异，超越GPT-4o等现有方法。

Conclusion: EarthMind展示了在多粒度和多传感器挑战中的潜力，为EO数据理解提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
various vision-language tasks. However, they often struggle to comprehensively
understand Earth Observation (EO) data, which is critical for monitoring the
environment and the effects of human activity on it. In this work, we present
EarthMind, a novel vision-language framework for multi-granular and
multi-sensor EO data understanding. EarthMind features two core components: (1)
Spatial Attention Prompting (SAP), which reallocates attention within the LLM
to enhance pixel-level understanding; and (2) Cross-modal Fusion, which aligns
heterogeneous modalities into a shared space and adaptively reweighs tokens
based on their information density for effective fusion. To facilitate
multi-sensor fusion evaluation, we propose EarthMind-Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark with over 2,000 human-annotated multi-sensor image-question pairs,
covering a wide range of perception and reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of EarthMind. It achieves state-of-the-art
performance on EarthMind-Bench, surpassing GPT-4o despite being only 4B in
scale. Moreover, EarthMind outperforms existing methods on multiple public EO
benchmarks, showcasing its potential to handle both multi-granular and
multi-sensor challenges in a unified framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在多模态任务中取得进展，但在细粒度视频运动理解方面仍存在局限，如缺乏帧间差异分析和忽略细微视觉线索。视觉提示在静态图像中有效，但在视频中的时间复杂性应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出MotionSight方法，利用物体中心视觉聚焦和运动模糊作为视觉提示，无需训练即可提升运动理解。同时构建MotionVid-QA数据集，包含40K视频片段和87K问答对。

Result: 实验表明MotionSight在开源模型中达到最先进水平，与商业模型竞争。

Conclusion: MotionSight通过零样本技术和高质量数据集显著提升了MLLMs的细粒度运动理解能力，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), their
proficiency in fine-grained video motion understanding remains critically
limited. They often lack inter-frame differencing and tend to average or ignore
subtle visual cues. Furthermore, while visual prompting has shown potential in
static images, its application to video's temporal complexities, particularly
for fine-grained motion understanding, remains largely unexplored. We
investigate whether inherent capability can be unlocked and boost MLLMs' motion
perception and enable distinct visual signatures tailored to decouple object
and camera motion cues. In this study, we introduce MotionSight, a novel
zero-shot method pioneering object-centric visual spotlight and motion blur as
visual prompts to effectively improve fine-grained motion understanding without
training. To convert this into valuable data assets, we curated MotionVid-QA,
the first large-scale dataset for fine-grained video motion understanding, with
hierarchical annotations including SFT and preference data, {\Theta}(40K) video
clips and {\Theta}(87K) QAs. Experiments show MotionSight achieves
state-of-the-art open-source performance and competitiveness with commercial
models. In particular, for fine-grained motion understanding we present a novel
zero-shot technique and a large-scale, high-quality dataset. All the code and
annotations will be publicly available.

Method: 提出SteerPose神经网络，通过旋转2D姿态到另一视角，结合可微分匹配，实现相机外参校准和对应关系搜索的统一框架，并引入几何一致性损失确保估计有效性。

Result: 在多样化的野外数据集上验证了方法的有效性和鲁棒性，并展示了利用现成2D姿态估计器和类无关模型重建新动物3D姿态的能力。

Conclusion: SteerPose提供了一种统一的框架，能够有效解决多相机系统校准和对应关系问题，适用于人类和动物的3D姿态重建。

Abstract: Can freely moving humans or animals themselves serve as calibration targets
for multi-camera systems while simultaneously estimating their correspondences
across views? We humans can solve this problem by mentally rotating the
observed 2D poses and aligning them with those in the target views. Inspired by
this cognitive ability, we propose SteerPose, a neural network that performs
this rotation of 2D poses into another view. By integrating differentiable
matching, SteerPose simultaneously performs extrinsic camera calibration and
correspondence search within a single unified framework. We also introduce a
novel geometric consistency loss that explicitly ensures that the estimated
rotation and correspondences result in a valid translation estimation.
Experimental results on diverse in-the-wild datasets of humans and animals
validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that our method can reconstruct the 3D poses of novel animals in
multi-camera setups by leveraging off-the-shelf 2D pose estimators and our
class-agnostic model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据剪枝方法未能有效平衡样本信息量和冗余性，InfoMax旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过重要性评分衡量样本信息量，利用样本相似性量化冗余性，将核心集选择问题建模为离散二次规划任务，并采用梯度求解器和稀疏化技术提升效率。

Result: 实验表明，InfoMax在图像分类、视觉语言预训练和大语言模型指令调优等任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: InfoMax是一种高效且可扩展的数据剪枝方法，显著提升了核心集的信息含量。

Abstract: In this paper, we present InfoMax, a novel data pruning method, also known as
coreset selection, designed to maximize the information content of selected
samples while minimizing redundancy. By doing so, InfoMax enhances the overall
informativeness of the coreset. The information of individual samples is
measured by importance scores, which capture their influence or difficulty in
model learning. To quantify redundancy, we use pairwise sample similarities,
based on the premise that similar samples contribute similarly to the learning
process. We formalize the coreset selection problem as a discrete quadratic
programming (DQP) task, with the objective of maximizing the total information
content, represented as the sum of individual sample contributions minus the
redundancies introduced by similar samples within the coreset. To ensure
practical scalability, we introduce an efficient gradient-based solver,
complemented by sparsification techniques applied to the similarity matrix and
dataset partitioning strategies. This enables InfoMax to seamlessly scale to
datasets with millions of samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of InfoMax in various data pruning tasks, including image
classification, vision-language pre-training, and instruction tuning for large
language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少数据标注成本并利用公开数据提升主动学习效果。

Method: 结合检索到的任务相关数据和TFS策略，采用对比调优（CT）进行模型适应。

Result: ALOR方法显著优于现有方法，CT在所有适应方法中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 公开数据和TFS策略的结合显著提升了主动学习的性能，CT是最优的适应方法。

Abstract: Pretrained on web-scale open data, VLMs offer powerful capabilities for
solving downstream tasks after being adapted to task-specific labeled data.
Yet, data labeling can be expensive and may demand domain expertise. Active
Learning (AL) aims to reduce this expense by strategically selecting the most
informative data for labeling and model training. Recent AL methods have
explored VLMs but have not leveraged publicly available open data, such as
VLM's pretraining data. In this work, we leverage such data by retrieving
task-relevant examples to augment the task-specific examples. As expected,
incorporating them significantly improves AL. Given that our method exploits
open-source VLM and open data, we refer to it as Active Learning with Open
Resources (ALOR). Additionally, most VLM-based AL methods use prompt tuning
(PT) for model adaptation, likely due to its ability to directly utilize
pretrained parameters and the assumption that doing so reduces the risk of
overfitting to limited labeled data. We rigorously compare popular adaptation
approaches, including linear probing (LP), finetuning (FT), and contrastive
tuning (CT). We reveal two key findings: (1) All adaptation approaches benefit
from incorporating retrieved data, and (2) CT resoundingly outperforms other
approaches across AL methods. Further analysis of retrieved data reveals a
naturally imbalanced distribution of task-relevant classes, exposing inherent
biases within the VLM. This motivates our novel Tail First Sampling (TFS)
strategy for AL, an embarrassingly simple yet effective method that prioritizes
sampling data from underrepresented classes to label. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our final method, contrastively finetuning VLM on both
retrieved and TFS-selected labeled data, significantly outperforms existing
methods.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了基于GRPO的强化学习后训练方法，用于提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频字幕生成中的动作描述能力，提出了VideoCap-R1模型，并通过实验验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在提升大语言模型的推理能力方面取得了进展，但在多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视频字幕生成中仍未被充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了VideoCap-R1模型，采用GRPO强化学习框架，结合结构化思维分析和两种奖励机制（LLM-free思维评分和LLM辅助字幕评分），以提升动作描述的准确性。

Result: 实验表明，VideoCap-R1在多个视频字幕基准测试中显著优于基线模型Qwen2VL-7B，并在有限样本（1.5k）下取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: GRPO强化学习框架能有效提升MLLMs在视频字幕生成中的能力，尤其是在动作描述方面，验证了其优越性。

Abstract: While recent advances in reinforcement learning have significantly enhanced
reasoning capabilities in large language models (LLMs), these techniques remain
underexplored in multi-modal LLMs for video captioning. This paper presents the
first systematic investigation of GRPO-based RL post-training for video MLLMs,
with the goal of enhancing video MLLMs' capability of describing actions in
videos. Specifically, we develop the VideoCap-R1, which is prompted to first
perform structured thinking that analyzes video subjects with their attributes
and actions before generating complete captions, supported by two specialized
reward mechanisms: a LLM-free think scorer evaluating the structured thinking
quality and a LLM-assisted caption scorer assessing the output quality. The RL
training framework effectively establishes the connection between structured
reasoning and comprehensive description generation, enabling the model to
produce captions with more accurate actions. Our experiments demonstrate that
VideoCap-R1 achieves substantial improvements over the Qwen2VL-7B baseline
using limited samples (1.5k) across multiple video caption benchmarks (DREAM1K:
+4.4 event F1, VDC: +4.2 Acc, CAREBENCH: +3.1 action F1, +6.9 object F1) while
consistently outperforming the SFT-trained counterparts, confirming GRPO's
superiority in enhancing MLLMs' captioning capabilities.

Conclusion: STORM为MLLMs在视觉评分任务中的研究提供了数据和工具支持。

Abstract: Visual rating is an essential capability of artificial intelligence (AI) for
multi-dimensional quantification of visual content, primarily applied in
ordinal regression (OR) tasks such as image quality assessment, facial age
estimation, and medical image grading. However, current multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) under-perform in such visual rating ability while also
suffering the lack of relevant datasets and benchmarks. In this work, we
collect and present STORM, a data collection and benchmark for Stimulating
Trustworthy Ordinal Regression Ability of MLLMs for universal visual rating.
STORM encompasses 14 ordinal regression datasets across five common visual
rating domains, comprising 655K image-level pairs and the corresponding
carefully curated VQAs. Importantly, we also propose a coarse-to-fine
processing pipeline that dynamically considers label candidates and provides
interpretable thoughts, providing MLLMs with a general and trustworthy ordinal
thinking paradigm. This benchmark aims to evaluate the all-in-one and zero-shot
performance of MLLMs in scenarios requiring understanding of the essential
common ordinal relationships of rating labels. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and shed light on better
fine-tuning strategies. The STORM dataset, benchmark, and pre-trained models

area. Datasets and codes are released on the project page:

Motivation: 解决在可穿戴XR设备上部署实时Egocentric Action Recognition (EAR)系统时面临的便携性、电池寿命和计算资源之间的权衡问题。

Method: 系统分析RGB视频和3D手部姿态输入在不同采样频率下的性能与CPU使用情况，探索多种配置。

Result: 降低RGB帧采样率并结合高频3D手部姿态输入可减少高达3倍的CPU使用，同时保持高识别精度。

Conclusion: 多模态输入策略是实现XR设备上高效实时EAR的可行方法。

Abstract: The increasing availability of wearable XR devices opens new perspectives for
Egocentric Action Recognition (EAR) systems, which can provide deeper human
understanding and situation awareness. However, deploying real-time algorithms
on these devices can be challenging due to the inherent trade-offs between
portability, battery life, and computational resources. In this work, we
systematically analyze the impact of sampling frequency across different input
modalities - RGB video and 3D hand pose - on egocentric action recognition
performance and CPU usage. By exploring a range of configurations, we provide a
comprehensive characterization of the trade-offs between accuracy and
computational efficiency. Our findings reveal that reducing the sampling rate
of RGB frames, when complemented with higher-frequency 3D hand pose input, can
preserve high accuracy while significantly lowering CPU demands. Notably, we
observe up to a 3x reduction in CPU usage with minimal to no loss in
recognition performance. This highlights the potential of multimodal input
strategies as a viable approach to achieving efficient, real-time EAR on XR
devices.

Motivation: 现有模型通常专注于单一任务，且高质量标注数据成本高昂。

Method: 设计轻量级适配器统一不同任务条件，采用联合图像-视频学习策略，并引入深度图辅助3D感知。

Result: 训练了8B和2B两个版本，支持10多种任务，8B模型在视频生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架为多任务视觉生成和操作提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown impressive performance in many visual generation
and manipulation tasks. Many existing methods focus on training a model for a
specific task, especially, text-to-video (T2V) generation, while many other
works focus on finetuning the pretrained T2V model for image-to-video (I2V),
video-to-video (V2V), image and video manipulation tasks, etc. However,
training a strong T2V foundation model requires a large amount of high-quality
annotations, which is very costly. In addition, many existing models can
perform only one or several tasks. In this work, we introduce a unified
framework, namely many-for-many, which leverages the available training data
from many different visual generation and manipulation tasks to train a single
model for those different tasks. Specifically, we design a lightweight adapter
to unify the different conditions in different tasks, then employ a joint
image-video learning strategy to progressively train the model from scratch.
Our joint learning leads to a unified visual generation and manipulation model
with improved video generation performance. In addition, we introduce depth
maps as a condition to help our model better perceive the 3D space in visual
generation. Two versions of our model are trained with different model sizes
(8B and 2B), each of which can perform more than 10 different tasks. In
particular, our 8B model demonstrates highly competitive performance in video
generation tasks compared to open-source and even commercial engines. Our
models and source codes are available at https://github.com/leeruibin/MfM.git.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在分割复杂真实世界对象时表现有限，无法处理拥挤图像。

Method: unMORE通过两阶段流程，先学习对象中心表示，再利用网络无关的多对象推理模块发现对象。

Result: 在6个真实世界数据集上表现最优，尤其在COCO数据集和拥挤图像中显著超越基线方法。

Conclusion: unMORE为无监督多目标分割提供了高效解决方案，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: We study the challenging problem of unsupervised multi-object segmentation on
single images. Existing methods, which rely on image reconstruction objectives
to learn objectness or leverage pretrained image features to group similar
pixels, often succeed only in segmenting simple synthetic objects or
discovering a limited number of real-world objects. In this paper, we introduce
unMORE, a novel two-stage pipeline designed to identify many complex objects in
real-world images. The key to our approach involves explicitly learning three
levels of carefully defined object-centric representations in the first stage.
Subsequently, our multi-object reasoning module utilizes these learned object
priors to discover multiple objects in the second stage. Notably, this
reasoning module is entirely network-free and does not require human labels.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that unMORE significantly outperforms all
existing unsupervised methods across 6 real-world benchmark datasets, including
the challenging COCO dataset, achieving state-of-the-art object segmentation
results. Remarkably, our method excels in crowded images where all baselines
collapse.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FAS依赖单一视觉模态，泛化能力有限；多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的突破为结合视觉与语言推理提供了可能。

Method: 构建FaceCoT数据集（含14种攻击类型和高质量CoT VQA标注），开发强化学习优化的标注模型，并提出CEPL策略。

Result: 实验表明，基于FaceCoT和CEPL训练的模型在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FaceCoT和CEPL显著提升了FAS的性能，为多模态方法在安全领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Face Anti-Spoofing (FAS) typically depends on a single visual modality when
defending against presentation attacks such as print attacks, screen replays,
and 3D masks, resulting in limited generalization across devices, environments,
and attack types. Meanwhile, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
recently achieved breakthroughs in image-text understanding and semantic
reasoning, suggesting that integrating visual and linguistic co-inference into
FAS can substantially improve both robustness and interpretability. However,
the lack of a high-quality vision-language multimodal dataset has been a
critical bottleneck. To address this, we introduce FaceCoT (Face
Chain-of-Thought), the first large-scale Visual Question Answering (VQA)
dataset tailored for FAS. FaceCoT covers 14 spoofing attack types and enriches
model learning with high-quality CoT VQA annotations. Meanwhile, we develop a
caption model refined via reinforcement learning to expand the dataset and
enhance annotation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a CoT-Enhanced
Progressive Learning (CEPL) strategy to better leverage the CoT data and boost
model performance on FAS tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained with FaceCoT and CEPL outperform state-of-the-art methods on multiple
benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 扩展文本引导分割任务，通过用户意图驱动掩码类型选择，提升视觉语言模型的多模态推理能力。

Method: 通过增强COCOA-cls、D2SA和MUVA的标注构建R2SM数据集，模型需根据自然语言提示生成模态或非模态掩码。

Result: R2SM数据集支持模型微调和评估，任务要求模型根据提示生成合适的分割掩码。

Conclusion: R2SM为多模态推理和意图感知分割研究提供了挑战性测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce a new task, Referring and Reasoning for Selective Masks (R2SM),
which extends text-guided segmentation by incorporating mask-type selection
driven by user intent. This task challenges vision-language models to determine
whether to generate a modal (visible) or amodal (complete) segmentation mask
based solely on natural language prompts. To support the R2SM task, we present
the R2SM dataset, constructed by augmenting annotations of COCOA-cls, D2SA, and
MUVA. The R2SM dataset consists of both modal and amodal text queries, each
paired with the corresponding ground-truth mask, enabling model finetuning and
evaluation for the ability to segment images as per user intent. Specifically,
the task requires the model to interpret whether a given prompt refers to only
the visible part of an object or to its complete shape, including occluded
regions, and then produce the appropriate segmentation. For example, if a
prompt explicitly requests the whole shape of a partially hidden object, the
model is expected to output an amodal mask that completes the occluded parts.
In contrast, prompts without explicit mention of hidden regions should generate
standard modal masks. The R2SM benchmark provides a challenging and insightful
testbed for advancing research in multimodal reasoning and intent-aware
segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成3D场景时，视角扩展会导致噪声和失真，限制了场景的探索性。WorldExplorer旨在解决这一问题，实现高质量、稳定的3D场景生成。

Method: 通过多视角一致的360度全景图初始化场景，利用视频扩散模型迭代生成场景。采用场景记忆和碰撞检测机制优化生成过程，最后通过3D高斯泼溅优化融合视图。

Result: WorldExplorer生成的3D场景在较大相机运动下仍保持高质量和稳定性，首次实现了真实且无限制的探索。

Conclusion: WorldExplorer在生成沉浸式、可探索的3D虚拟环境方面迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Generating 3D worlds from text is a highly anticipated goal in computer
vision. Existing works are limited by the degree of exploration they allow
inside of a scene, i.e., produce streched-out and noisy artifacts when moving
beyond central or panoramic perspectives. To this end, we propose
WorldExplorer, a novel method based on autoregressive video trajectory
generation, which builds fully navigable 3D scenes with consistent visual
quality across a wide range of viewpoints. We initialize our scenes by creating
multi-view consistent images corresponding to a 360 degree panorama. Then, we
expand it by leveraging video diffusion models in an iterative scene generation
pipeline. Concretely, we generate multiple videos along short, pre-defined
trajectories, that explore the scene in depth, including motion around objects.
Our novel scene memory conditions each video on the most relevant prior views,
while a collision-detection mechanism prevents degenerate results, like moving
into objects. Finally, we fuse all generated views into a unified 3D
representation via 3D Gaussian Splatting optimization. Compared to prior
approaches, WorldExplorer produces high-quality scenes that remain stable under
large camera motion, enabling for the first time realistic and unrestricted
exploration. We believe this marks a significant step toward generating
immersive and truly explorable virtual 3D environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型局限于单一场景，无法实现多样化动态内容操作。

Method: 提出统一动态内容操作注入模块和视觉-文本指令模块，构建多任务数据处理系统及OmniV2V数据集。

Result: 实验表明OmniV2V在多种视频生成与编辑任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: OmniV2V为多场景视频生成与编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of Diffusion Transformers (DiT) has brought significant
advancements to video generation, especially in text-to-video and
image-to-video tasks. Although video generation is widely applied in various
fields, most existing models are limited to single scenarios and cannot perform
diverse video generation and editing through dynamic content manipulation. We
propose OmniV2V, a video model capable of generating and editing videos across
different scenarios based on various operations, including: object movement,
object addition, mask-guided video edit, try-on, inpainting, outpainting, human
animation, and controllable character video synthesis. We explore a unified
dynamic content manipulation injection module, which effectively integrates the
requirements of the above tasks. In addition, we design a visual-text
instruction module based on LLaVA, enabling the model to effectively understand
the correspondence between visual content and instructions. Furthermore, we
build a comprehensive multi-task data processing system. Since there is data
overlap among various tasks, this system can efficiently provide data
augmentation. Using this system, we construct a multi-type, multi-scenario
OmniV2V dataset and its corresponding OmniV2V-Test benchmark. Extensive
experiments show that OmniV2V works as well as, and sometimes better than, the
best existing open-source and commercial models for many video generation and
editing tasks.

Abstract: Learning an animatable and clothed human avatar model with vivid dynamics and
photorealistic appearance from multi-view videos is an important foundational
research problem in computer graphics and vision. Fueled by recent advances in
implicit representations, the quality of the animatable avatars has achieved an
unprecedented level by attaching the implicit representation to drivable human
template meshes. However, they usually fail to preserve the highest level of
detail, particularly apparent when the virtual camera is zoomed in and when
rendering at 4K resolution and higher. We argue that this limitation stems from
inaccurate surface tracking, specifically, depth misalignment and surface drift
between character geometry and the ground truth surface, which forces the
detailed appearance model to compensate for geometric errors. To address this,
we propose a latent deformation model and supervising the 3D deformation of the
animatable character using guidance from foundational 2D video point trackers,
which offer improved robustness to shading and surface variations, and are less
prone to local minima than differentiable rendering. To mitigate the drift over
time and lack of 3D awareness of 2D point trackers, we introduce a cascaded
training strategy that generates consistent 3D point tracks by anchoring point
tracks to the rendered avatar, which ultimately supervises our avatar at the
vertex and texel level. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising five multi-view video sequences, each over
10 minutes in duration, captured using 40 calibrated 6K-resolution cameras,
featuring subjects dressed in clothing with challenging texture patterns and
wrinkle deformations. Our approach demonstrates significantly improved
performance in rendering quality and geometric accuracy over the prior state of
the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非接触式指纹识别技术因卫生和便携性需求日益增长，但面临图像模糊、对比度低、手指位置变化等挑战，影响匹配准确性。

Method: 采用多阶段Transformer方法，先提取全局空间特征，再细化局部特征对齐，通过分层特征提取和匹配流程实现高精度匹配。

Result: 在HKPolyU和RidgeBase等公开数据集上测试，表现优于现有方法，包括商业解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了非接触式指纹匹配的准确性和可靠性，为实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The increasing demand for hygienic and portable biometric systems has
underscored the critical need for advancements in contactless fingerprint
recognition. Despite its potential, this technology faces notable challenges,
including out-of-focus image acquisition, reduced contrast between fingerprint
ridges and valleys, variations in finger positioning, and perspective
distortion. These factors significantly hinder the accuracy and reliability of
contactless fingerprint matching. To address these issues, we propose a novel
multi-stage transformer-based contactless fingerprint matching approach that
first captures global spatial features and subsequently refines localized
feature alignment across fingerprint samples. By employing a hierarchical
feature extraction and matching pipeline, our method ensures fine-grained,
cross-sample alignment while maintaining the robustness of global feature
representation. We perform extensive evaluations on publicly available datasets
such as HKPolyU and RidgeBase under different evaluation protocols, such as
contactless-to-contact matching and contactless-to-contactless matching and
demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods, including
COTS solutions.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting and its extension to 4D dynamic scenes enable
photorealistic, real-time rendering from real-world captures, positioning
Gaussian Splats (GS) as a promising format for next-generation immersive media.
However, their high storage requirements pose significant challenges for
practical use in sharing, transmission, and storage. Despite various studies
exploring GS compression from different perspectives, these efforts remain
scattered across separate repositories, complicating benchmarking and the
integration of best practices. To address this gap, we present GSCodec Studio,
a unified and modular framework for GS reconstruction, compression, and
rendering. The framework incorporates a diverse set of 3D/4D GS reconstruction
methods and GS compression techniques as modular components, facilitating
flexible combinations and comprehensive comparisons. By integrating best
practices from community research and our own explorations, GSCodec Studio
supports the development of compact representation and compression solutions
for static and dynamic Gaussian Splats, namely our Static and Dynamic GSCodec,
achieving competitive rate-distortion performance in static and dynamic GS
compression. The code for our framework is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoDA（Modulation Adapter）是一种轻量级模块，通过指令引导的调制优化预对齐的视觉特征，提升多模态大语言模型在复杂场景中的细粒度视觉概念理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂场景中难以准确关联细粒度视觉概念，MoDA旨在通过指令引导的调制解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1）通过冻结视觉编码器和适配层对齐图像特征；2）在指令调优阶段使用MoDA模块生成调制掩码，突出语义相关特征。

Result: 实验表明，MoDA提升了视觉定位能力，并生成更符合上下文的响应。

Conclusion: MoDA是一种有效的通用增强模块，适用于基于图像的多模态大语言模型。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on instruction-following tasks by integrating pretrained
visual encoders with large language models (LLMs). However, existing approaches
often struggle to ground fine-grained visual concepts in complex scenes. In
this paper, we propose MoDA (Modulation Adapter), a lightweight yet effective
module designed to refine pre-aligned visual features through
instruction-guided modulation. Our approach follows the standard LLaVA training
protocol, consisting of a two-stage process: (1) aligning image features to the
LLMs input space via a frozen vision encoder and adapter layers, and (2)
refining those features using the MoDA adapter during the instructional tuning
stage. MoDA employs a Transformer-based cross-attention mechanism to generate a
modulation mask over the aligned visual tokens, thereby emphasizing
semantically relevant embedding dimensions based on the language instruction.
The modulated features are then passed to the LLM for autoregressive language
generation. Our experimental evaluation shows that MoDA improves visual
grounding and generates more contextually appropriate responses, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a general-purpose enhancement for image-based MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（如ChatGPT-4o）仅支持图像与文本，缺乏对3D内容的理解与生成能力。

Method: 通过训练3D VQVAE将3D对象映射到离散潜在空间，构建3D-Alpaca数据集，并在Qwen-2.5-vl-7B-Instruct模型上进行指令训练。

Conclusion: 该研究为扩展多模态模型的3D能力提供了有效尝试，推动了3D原生AI的未来发展。

Abstract: Recently, the powerful text-to-image capabilities of ChatGPT-4o have led to
growing appreciation for native multimodal large language models. However, its
multimodal capabilities remain confined to images and text. Yet beyond images,
the ability to understand and generate 3D content is equally crucial. To
address this gap, we propose ShapeLLM-Omni-a native 3D large language model
capable of understanding and generating 3D assets and text in any sequence.
First, we train a 3D vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE), which
maps 3D objects into a discrete latent space to achieve efficient and accurate
shape representation and reconstruction. Building upon the 3D-aware discrete
tokens, we innovatively construct a large-scale continuous training dataset
named 3D-Alpaca, encompassing generation, comprehension, and editing, thus
providing rich resources for future research and training. Finally, by
performing instruction-based training of the Qwen-2.5-vl-7B-Instruct model on
the 3D-Alpaca dataset. Our work provides an effective attempt at extending
multimodal models with basic 3D capabilities, which contributes to future
research in 3D-native AI. Project page:

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生物医学视觉语言模型预训练方法，通过扰动报告区分任务和对比学习，提升了模型对复杂语义的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文本具有复杂且领域特定的语义，现有对比学习方法未能充分捕捉这些特性。

Method: 设计了文本扰动方法，通过区分原始报告与扰动报告，并结合注意力加权的图像子区域和子词对比学习。

Result: 在多个下游任务中表现优于基线方法，学习到更具语义意义和鲁棒性的多模态表示。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升生物医学视觉语言模型的语义理解能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models pre-trained on large scale of unlabeled biomedical
images and associated reports learn generalizable semantic representations.
These multi-modal representations can benefit various downstream tasks in the
biomedical domain. Contrastive learning is widely used to pre-train
vision-language models for general natural images and associated captions.
Despite its popularity, we found biomedical texts have complex and
domain-specific semantics that are often neglected by common contrastive
methods. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, perturbed report
discrimination, for pre-train biomedical vision-language models. First, we
curate a set of text perturbation methods that keep the same words, but disrupt
the semantic structure of the sentence. Next, we apply different types of
perturbation to reports, and use the model to distinguish the original report
from the perturbed ones given the associated image. Parallel to this, we
enhance the sensitivity of our method to higher level of granularity for both
modalities by contrasting attention-weighted image sub-regions and sub-words in
the image-text pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple downstream
tasks, and our method outperforms strong baseline methods. The results
demonstrate that our approach learns more semantic meaningful and robust
multi-modal representations.

Motivation: 解决复杂语义和长时序依赖的视频理解问题，利用RLT增强MLLMs的推理能力。

Method: 基于GRPO框架，设计双奖励机制（语义和时序推理），并引入方差感知数据选择策略优化训练样本。

Result: 在八项视频理解任务中表现优于监督微调和现有RLT基线，且训练数据需求更少。

Conclusion: 奖励设计和数据选择对提升MLLMs的视频推理能力至关重要，代码已更新并开源。

Abstract: Understanding real-world videos with complex semantics and long temporal
dependencies remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Recent
progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in vision-language tasks, while reinforcement learning tuning
(RLT) has further improved their reasoning abilities. In this work, we explore
RLT as a post-training strategy to enhance the video-specific reasoning
capabilities of MLLMs. Built upon the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)
framework, we propose a dual-reward formulation that supervises both semantic
and temporal reasoning through discrete and continuous reward signals. To
facilitate effective preference-based optimization, we introduce a
variance-aware data selection strategy based on repeated inference to identify
samples that provide informative learning signals. We evaluate our approach
across eight representative video understanding tasks, including VideoQA,
Temporal Video Grounding, and Grounded VideoQA. Our method consistently
outperforms supervised fine-tuning and existing RLT baselines, achieving
superior performance with significantly less training data. These results
underscore the importance of reward design and data selection in advancing
reasoning-centric video understanding with MLLMs. Notably, The initial code
release (two months ago) has now been expanded with updates, including
optimized reward mechanisms and additional datasets. The latest version is
available at https://github.com/appletea233/Temporal-R1 .

Method: 通过分析UNet中间块的稀疏通道表示，开发了一种随机重建算法，并研究了该表示的性质。

Result: 发现潜在空间中的欧氏距离与条件密度距离及图像语义相似性相关，聚类分析显示图像共享细节和全局结构。

Conclusion: 首次证明仅通过降噪训练的UNet包含丰富且可访问的稀疏图像表示。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models learn probability densities over diverse image
datasets by estimating the score with a neural network trained to remove noise.
Despite their remarkable success in generating high-quality images, the
internal mechanisms of the underlying score networks are not well understood.
Here, we examine a UNet trained for denoising on the ImageNet dataset, to
better understand its internal representation and computation of the score. We
show that the middle block of the UNet decomposes individual images into sparse
subsets of active channels, and that the vector of spatial averages of these
channels can provide a nonlinear representation of the underlying clean images.
We develop a novel algorithm for stochastic reconstruction of images from this
representation and demonstrate that it recovers a sample from a set of images
defined by a target image representation. We then study the properties of the
representation and demonstrate that Euclidean distances in the latent space
correspond to distances between conditional densities induced by
representations as well as semantic similarities in the image space. Applying a
clustering algorithm in the representation space yields groups of images that
share both fine details (e.g., specialized features, textured regions, small
objects), as well as global structure, but are only partially aligned with
object identities. Thus, we show for the first time that a network trained
solely on denoising contains a rich and accessible sparse representation of
images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将每个物种视为独立类别，忽略了物种间的视觉相似性，TaxaDiffusion旨在利用分类学知识提升细粒度图像生成效果。

Method: TaxaDiffusion采用分层训练策略，从大类（如纲、目）逐步细化到物种级别，利用共享形态特征进行知识迁移。

Result: 在三个细粒度动物数据集上，TaxaDiffusion表现优于现有方法，生成图像保真度更高。

Conclusion: TaxaDiffusion通过分类学指导的分层训练，显著提升了细粒度动物图像生成的准确性和效率。

Abstract: We propose TaxaDiffusion, a taxonomy-informed training framework for
diffusion models to generate fine-grained animal images with high morphological
and identity accuracy. Unlike standard approaches that treat each species as an
independent category, TaxaDiffusion incorporates domain knowledge that many
species exhibit strong visual similarities, with distinctions often residing in
subtle variations of shape, pattern, and color. To exploit these relationships,
TaxaDiffusion progressively trains conditioned diffusion models across
different taxonomic levels -- starting from broad classifications such as Class
and Order, refining through Family and Genus, and ultimately distinguishing at
the Species level. This hierarchical learning strategy first captures
coarse-grained morphological traits shared by species with common ancestors,
facilitating knowledge transfer before refining fine-grained differences for
species-level distinction. As a result, TaxaDiffusion enables accurate
generation even with limited training samples per species. Extensive
experiments on three fine-grained animal datasets demonstrate that outperforms
existing approaches, achieving superior fidelity in fine-grained animal image
generation. Project page: https://amink8.github.io/TaxaDiffusion/

Abstract: Spatial intelligence, encompassing 3D reconstruction, perception, and
reasoning, is fundamental to applications such as robotics, aerial imaging, and
extended reality. A key enabler is the real-time, accurate estimation of core
3D attributes (camera parameters, point clouds, depth maps, and 3D point
tracks) from unstructured or streaming imagery. Inspired by the success of
large foundation models in language and 2D vision, a new class of end-to-end 3D
geometric foundation models (GFMs) has emerged, directly predicting dense 3D
representations in a single feed-forward pass, eliminating the need for slow or
unavailable precomputed camera parameters. Since late 2023, the field has
exploded with diverse variants, but systematic evaluation is lacking. In this
work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for 3D GFMs, covering five
core tasks: sparse-view depth estimation, video depth estimation, 3D
reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation, novel view synthesis, and spanning
both standard and challenging out-of-distribution datasets. Our standardized
toolkit automates dataset handling, evaluation protocols, and metric
computation to ensure fair, reproducible comparisons. We evaluate 16
state-of-the-art GFMs, revealing their strengths and limitations across tasks
and domains, and derive key insights to guide future model scaling and
optimization. All code, evaluation scripts, and processed data will be publicly
released to accelerate research in 3D spatial intelligence.

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for low-rank personalization of a generic model
for head avatar generation. Prior work proposes generic models that achieve
high-quality face animation by leveraging large-scale datasets of multiple
identities. However, such generic models usually fail to synthesize unique
identity-specific details, since they learn a general domain prior. To adapt to
specific subjects, we find that it is still challenging to capture
high-frequency facial details via popular solutions like low-rank adaptation
(LoRA). This motivates us to propose a specific architecture, a Register
Module, that enhances the performance of LoRA, while requiring only a small
number of parameters to adapt to an unseen identity. Our module is applied to
intermediate features of a pre-trained model, storing and re-purposing
information in a learnable 3D feature space. To demonstrate the efficacy of our
personalization method, we collect a dataset of talking videos of individuals
with distinctive facial details, such as wrinkles and tattoos. Our approach
faithfully captures unseen faces, outperforming existing methods quantitatively
and qualitatively. We will release the code, models, and dataset to the public.

Abstract: Anisotropic rotation averaging has recently been explored as a natural
extension of respective isotropic methods. In the anisotropic formulation,
uncertainties of the estimated relative rotations -- obtained via standard
two-view optimization -- are propagated to the optimization of absolute
rotations. The resulting semidefinite relaxations are able to recover global
minima but scale poorly with the problem size. Local methods are fast and also
admit robust estimation but are sensitive to initialization. They usually
employ minimum spanning trees and therefore suffer from drift accumulation and
can get trapped in poor local minima. In this paper, we attempt to bridge the
gap between optimality, robustness and efficiency of anisotropic rotation
averaging. We analyze a family of block coordinate descent methods initially
proposed to optimize the standard chordal distances, and derive a much simpler
formulation and an anisotropic extension obtaining a fast general solver. We
integrate this solver into the extended anisotropic large-scale robust rotation
averaging pipeline. The resulting algorithm achieves state-of-the-art
performance on public structure-from-motion datasets. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模神经网络训练需要大量计算资源，现有数据集蒸馏方法主要针对图像分类，而复杂的目标检测任务尚未充分探索。

Method: OD3框架分为两阶段：候选选择（迭代放置对象实例）和候选筛选（使用预训练观察模型去除低置信度对象）。

Conclusion: OD3为目标检测任务提供了一种高效的数据集蒸馏方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Training large neural networks on large-scale datasets requires substantial
computational resources, particularly for dense prediction tasks such as object
detection. Although dataset distillation (DD) has been proposed to alleviate
these demands by synthesizing compact datasets from larger ones, most existing
work focuses solely on image classification, leaving the more complex detection
setting largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce OD3, a novel
optimization-free data distillation framework specifically designed for object
detection. Our approach involves two stages: first, a candidate selection
process in which object instances are iteratively placed in synthesized images
based on their suitable locations, and second, a candidate screening process
using a pre-trained observer model to remove low-confidence objects. We perform
our data synthesis framework on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC, two popular detection

TL;DR: RoboMaster提出了一种新框架，通过分解交互过程为三个阶段，解决了多物体交互中的特征纠缠问题，提升了轨迹控制视频生成的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于轨迹的方法难以捕捉复杂机器人操作中的多物体交互，导致视觉保真度下降。

Method: 将交互过程分解为三个阶段（交互前、交互中、交互后），分别用主导物体特征建模，并引入外观和形状感知的潜在表示。

Result: 在Bridge V2数据集和实际评估中，RoboMaster表现优于现有方法，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: RoboMaster通过分阶段建模和潜在表示，显著提升了多物体交互的轨迹控制视频生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential
for generating robotic decision-making data, with trajectory conditions further
enabling fine-grained control. However, existing trajectory-based methods
primarily focus on individual object motion and struggle to capture
multi-object interaction crucial in complex robotic manipulation. This
limitation arises from multi-feature entanglement in overlapping regions, which
leads to degraded visual fidelity. To address this, we present RoboMaster, a
novel framework that models inter-object dynamics through a collaborative
trajectory formulation. Unlike prior methods that decompose objects, our core
is to decompose the interaction process into three sub-stages: pre-interaction,
interaction, and post-interaction. Each stage is modeled using the feature of
the dominant object, specifically the robotic arm in the pre- and
post-interaction phases and the manipulated object during interaction, thereby
mitigating the drawback of multi-object feature fusion present during
interaction in prior work. To further ensure subject semantic consistency
throughout the video, we incorporate appearance- and shape-aware latent
representations for objects. Extensive experiments on the challenging Bridge V2
dataset, as well as in-the-wild evaluation, demonstrate that our method
outperforms existing approaches, establishing new state-of-the-art performance
in trajectory-controlled video generation for robotic manipulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在3D推理中因缺乏显式3D数据而受限，研究发现3D感知表示质量与下游任务性能正相关。

Method: 提出3DRS框架，通过3D基础模型监督对齐MLLM视觉特征与3D知识。

Result: 在多个基准测试和MLLMs上（如视觉定位、描述和问答）表现一致提升。

Conclusion: 3DRS有效提升MLLM的3D表示能力，改善场景理解性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in scene understanding have leveraged multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) for 3D reasoning by capitalizing on their strong 2D
pretraining. However, the lack of explicit 3D data during MLLM pretraining
limits 3D representation capability. In this paper, we investigate the
3D-awareness of MLLMs by evaluating multi-view correspondence and reveal a
strong positive correlation between the quality of 3D-aware representation and
downstream task performance. Motivated by this, we propose 3DRS, a framework
that enhances MLLM 3D representation learning by introducing supervision from
pretrained 3D foundation models. Our approach aligns MLLM visual features with
rich 3D knowledge distilled from 3D models, effectively improving scene
understanding. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and MLLMs --
including visual grounding, captioning, and question answering -- demonstrate
consistent performance gains. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/3drs

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务QL-Edit，旨在解决多对象场景中数量和空间布局控制的挑战，并提出了IMAGHarmony框架和PNS策略，显著提升了编辑精度和生成稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像编辑方法在多对象场景中对数量和空间布局的控制不足，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 提出了IMAGHarmony框架，结合和谐感知注意力（HA）和多模态语义，并引入偏好引导噪声选择（PNS）策略。

Result: IMAGHarmony在结构对齐和语义准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IMAGHarmony为多对象图像编辑提供了更精确和稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models have advanced image editing by enhancing visual
quality and control, supporting broad applications across creative and
personalized domains. However, current image editing largely overlooks
multi-object scenarios, where precise control over object categories, counts,
and spatial layouts remains a significant challenge. To address this, we
introduce a new task, quantity-and-layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit),
which aims to enable fine-grained control of object quantity and spatial
structure in complex scenes. We further propose IMAGHarmony, a structure-aware
framework that incorporates harmony-aware attention (HA) to integrate
multimodal semantics, explicitly modeling object counts and layouts to enhance
editing accuracy and structural consistency. In addition, we observe that
diffusion models are susceptible to initial noise and exhibit strong
preferences for specific noise patterns. Motivated by this, we present a
preference-guided noise selection (PNS) strategy that chooses semantically
aligned initial noise samples based on vision-language matching, thereby
improving generation stability and layout consistency in multi-object editing.
To support evaluation, we construct HarmonyBench, a comprehensive benchmark
covering diverse quantity and layout control scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that IMAGHarmony consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in structural alignment and semantic accuracy. The code and model are available

Result: 实现了多种新控制任务，如常识推理和视觉提示，用户可快速实现多模态控制。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像生成提供了灵活且高效的控制框架。

Abstract: Prior methods for controlling image generation are limited in their ability
to be taught new tasks. In contrast, vision-language models, or VLMs, can learn
tasks in-context and produce the correct outputs for a given input. We propose
a dual-process distillation scheme that allows feed-forward image generators to
learn new tasks from deliberative VLMs. Our scheme uses a VLM to rate the
generated images and backpropagates this gradient to update the weights of the
image generator. Our general framework enables a wide variety of new control
tasks through the same text-and-image based interface. We showcase a handful of
applications of this technique for different types of control signals, such as
commonsense inferences and visual prompts. With our method, users can implement
multimodal controls for properties such as color palette, line weight, horizon
position, and relative depth within a matter of minutes. Project page:

Abstract: Purpose: We investigated the utilization of privacy-preserving,
locally-deployed, open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
diagnostic information from free-text cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
reports. Materials and Methods: We evaluated nine open-source LLMs on their
ability to identify diagnoses and classify patients into various cardiac
diagnostic categories based on descriptive findings in 109 clinical CMR
reports. Performance was quantified using standard classification metrics
including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We also employed confusion
matrices to examine patterns of misclassification across models. Results: Most
open-source LLMs demonstrated exceptional performance in classifying reports
into different diagnostic categories. Google's Gemma2 model achieved the
highest average F1 score of 0.98, followed by Qwen2.5:32B and DeepseekR1-32B
with F1 scores of 0.96 and 0.95, respectively. All other evaluated models
attained average scores above 0.93, with Mistral and DeepseekR1-7B being the
only exceptions. The top four LLMs outperformed our board-certified
cardiologist (F1 score of 0.94) across all evaluation metrics in analyzing CMR
reports. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of implementing
open-source, privacy-preserving LLMs in clinical settings for automated
analysis of imaging reports, enabling accurate, fast and resource-efficient
diagnostic categorization.

Result: 防御方法能有效恢复模型安全性，且不影响下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 强调电信LLMs需关注安全微调，并提供实用指南以保障实际部署中的安全性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for telecom tasks and datasets is a
common practice to adapt general-purpose models to the telecom domain. However,
little attention has been paid to how this process may compromise model safety.
Recent research has shown that even benign fine-tuning can degrade the safety
alignment of LLMs, causing them to respond to harmful or unethical user
queries. In this paper, we investigate this issue for telecom-tuned LLMs using
three representative datasets featured by the GenAINet initiative. We show that
safety degradation persists even for structured and seemingly harmless datasets
such as 3GPP standards and tabular records, indicating that telecom-specific
data is not immune to safety erosion during fine-tuning. We further extend our
analysis to publicly available Telecom LLMs trained via continual pre-training,
revealing that safety alignment is often severely lacking, primarily due to the
omission of safety-focused instruction tuning. To address these issues in both
fine-tuned and pre-trained models, we conduct extensive experiments and
evaluate three safety realignment defenses (SafeInstruct, SafeLoRA, and
SafeMERGE) using established red-teaming benchmarks. The results show that,
across all settings, the proposed defenses can effectively restore safety after
harmful degradation without compromising downstream task performance, leading
to Safe teleCOMMunication (SafeCOMM) models. In a nutshell, our work serves as
a diagnostic study and practical guide for safety realignment in telecom-tuned
LLMs, and emphasizes the importance of safety-aware instruction and fine-tuning
for real-world deployments of Telecom LLMs.

Motivation: 探讨提示工程技术如何影响LLMs在医学任务中的表现，特别是准确性和置信度的校准。

Method: 使用波斯医学考试数据集，评估五种LLMs在不同配置（温度、提示风格、置信度标度）下的表现，采用AUC-ROC、Brier Score和ECE等指标。

Result: Chain-of-Thought提示提高准确性但导致过度自信；情感提示进一步加剧置信度膨胀；小模型表现较差，专有模型准确性高但置信度校准不足。

Conclusion: 提示工程技术需同时优化准确性和不确定性校准，以适用于高风险的医学任务。

Abstract: This paper investigates how prompt engineering techniques impact both
accuracy and confidence elicitation in Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to
medical contexts. Using a stratified dataset of Persian board exam questions
across multiple specialties, we evaluated five LLMs - GPT-4o, o3-mini,
Llama-3.3-70b, Llama-3.1-8b, and DeepSeek-v3 - across 156 configurations. These
configurations varied in temperature settings (0.3, 0.7, 1.0), prompt styles
(Chain-of-Thought, Few-Shot, Emotional, Expert Mimicry), and confidence scales
(1-10, 1-100). We used AUC-ROC, Brier Score, and Expected Calibration Error
(ECE) to evaluate alignment between confidence and actual performance.
Chain-of-Thought prompts improved accuracy but also led to overconfidence,
highlighting the need for calibration. Emotional prompting further inflated
confidence, risking poor decisions. Smaller models like Llama-3.1-8b
underperformed across all metrics, while proprietary models showed higher
accuracy but still lacked calibrated confidence. These results suggest prompt
engineering must address both accuracy and uncertainty to be effective in
high-stakes medical tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电视网络在节目决策时面临高财务风险，通常依赖有限的历史数据预测收视率，因此需要更准确的预测方法。

Method: 通过提取剧集对话中的情感基调、认知复杂度和叙事结构等NLP特征，结合SARIMAX、滚动XGBoost和特征选择模型进行评估。

Result: NLP特征对某些剧集的预测有显著提升，同时提出了一种基于对话向量欧氏距离的节目相似性评分方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在不同类型节目中表现出色，为内容创作者和管理者提供了可解释的数据驱动见解。

Abstract: Television networks face high financial risk when making programming
decisions, often relying on limited historical data to forecast episodic
viewership. This study introduces a machine learning framework that integrates
natural language processing (NLP) features from over 25000 television episodes
with traditional viewership data to enhance predictive accuracy. By extracting
emotional tone, cognitive complexity, and narrative structure from episode
dialogue, we evaluate forecasting performance using SARIMAX, rolling XGBoost,
and feature selection models. While prior viewership remains a strong baseline
predictor, NLP features contribute meaningful improvements for some series. We
also introduce a similarity scoring method based on Euclidean distance between
aggregate dialogue vectors to compare shows by content. Tested across diverse
genres, including Better Call Saul and Abbott Elementary, our framework reveals
genre-specific performance and offers interpretable metrics for writers,
executives, and marketers seeking data-driven insight into audience behavior.

Motivation: 现有AI治理框架多为高层规范，未能充分反映实际应用中的用户关切。

Method: 利用BERTopic分析G2.com上的10万条AI产品用户评论，提取与AI治理相关的潜在主题。

Result: 发现隐私和透明度等与现有框架重叠的问题，但也揭示了项目管理、战略制定等被忽视的领域。

Conclusion: 强调需要更多基于实证、以用户为中心的AI治理方法，以补充现有规范模型。

Abstract: With the growing importance of AI governance, numerous high-level frameworks
and principles have been articulated by policymakers, institutions, and expert
communities to guide the development and application of AI. While such
frameworks offer valuable normative orientation, they may not fully capture the
practical concerns of those who interact with AI systems in organizational and
operational contexts. To address this gap, this study adopts a bottom-up
approach to explore how governance-relevant themes are expressed in user
discourse. Drawing on over 100,000 user reviews of AI products from G2.com, we
apply BERTopic to extract latent themes and identify those most semantically
related to AI governance. The analysis reveals a diverse set of
governance-relevant topics spanning both technical and non-technical domains.
These include concerns across organizational processes-such as planning,
coordination, and communication-as well as stages of the AI value chain,
including deployment infrastructure, data handling, and analytics. The findings
show considerable overlap with institutional AI governance and ethics
frameworks on issues like privacy and transparency, but also surface overlooked
areas such as project management, strategy development, and customer
interaction. This highlights the need for more empirically grounded,
user-centered approaches to AI governance-approaches that complement normative
models by capturing how governance unfolds in applied settings. By
foregrounding how governance is enacted in practice, this study contributes to
more inclusive and operationally grounded approaches to AI governance and
digital policy.

Motivation: HPB疾病的高发病率和死亡率是全球公共卫生挑战，但现有LLM评估基准缺乏HPB覆盖和真实临床案例。

Method: 系统构建HPB疾病评估基准，包括选择题和真实诊断案例，涵盖ICD-10定义的33个主类和465个子类。

Result: 商业和开源LLM在HPB诊断任务中表现不佳，尤其在复杂住院病例中，医学LLM的泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在HPB疾病领域存在显著局限，未来需提升处理复杂临床诊断的能力，而非仅应对简单医学考试问题。

Abstract: Hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) disorders represent a global public health
challenge due to their high morbidity and mortality. Although large language
models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in general medical
question-answering tasks, the current evaluation benchmarks are mostly derived
from standardized examinations or manually designed questions, lacking HPB
coverage and clinical cases. To address these issues, we systematically
eatablish an HPB disease evaluation benchmark comprising 3,535 closed-ended
multiple-choice questions and 337 open-ended real diagnosis cases, which
encompasses all the 33 main categories and 465 subcategories of HPB diseases
defined in the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, 10th
Revision (ICD-10). The multiple-choice questions are curated from public
datasets and synthesized data, and the clinical cases are collected from
prestigious medical journals, case-sharing platforms, and collaborating
hospitals. By evalauting commercial and open-source general and medical LLMs on
our established benchmark, namely ClinBench-HBP, we find that while commercial
LLMs perform competently on medical exam questions, they exhibit substantial
performance degradation on HPB diagnosis tasks, especially on complex,
inpatient clinical cases. Those medical LLMs also show limited generalizability
to HPB diseases. Our results reveal the critical limitations of current LLMs in
the domain of HPB diseases, underscoring the imperative need for future medical
LLMs to handle real, complex clinical diagnostics rather than simple medical
exam questions. The benchmark will be released at the homepage.

Conclusion: 需进一步研究儿童语音匿名化技术及评估方法。

Abstract: Children are one of the most under-represented groups in speech technologies,
as well as one of the most vulnerable in terms of privacy. Despite this,
anonymization techniques targeting this population have received little
attention. In this study, we seek to bridge this gap, and establish a baseline
for the use of voice anonymization techniques designed for adult speech when
applied to children's voices. Such an evaluation is essential, as children's
speech presents a distinct set of challenges when compared to that of adults.
This study comprises three children's datasets, six anonymization methods, and
objective and subjective utility metrics for evaluation. Our results show that
existing systems for adults are still able to protect children's voice privacy,
but suffer from much higher utility degradation. In addition, our subjective
study displays the challenges of automatic evaluation methods for speech
quality in children's speech, highlighting the need for further research.

Abstract: Understanding the prevalence of misinformation in health topics online can
inform public health policies and interventions. However, measuring such
misinformation at scale remains a challenge, particularly for high-stakes but
understudied topics like opioid-use disorder (OUD)--a leading cause of death in
the U.S. We present the first large-scale study of OUD-related myths on
YouTube, a widely-used platform for health information. With clinical experts,
we validate 8 pervasive myths and release an expert-labeled video dataset. To
scale labeling, we introduce MythTriage, an efficient triage pipeline that uses
a lightweight model for routine cases and defers harder ones to a
high-performing, but costlier, large language model (LLM). MythTriage achieves
up to 0.86 macro F1-score while estimated to reduce annotation time and
financial cost by over 76% compared to experts and full LLM labeling. We
analyze 2.9K search results and 343K recommendations, uncovering how myths
persist on YouTube and offering actionable insights for public health and

Conclusion: 论文通过公开数据集和AIMSCheck框架，推动AI在合规评估中的应用，并促进相关领域研究。

Abstract: Modern Slavery Acts mandate that corporations disclose their efforts to
combat modern slavery, aiming to enhance transparency and strengthen practices
for its eradication. However, verifying these statements remains challenging
due to their complex, diversified language and the sheer number of statements
that must be reviewed. The development of NLP tools to assist in this task is
also difficult due to a scarcity of annotated data. Furthermore, as modern
slavery transparency legislation has been introduced in several countries, the
generalizability of such tools across legal jurisdictions must be studied. To
address these challenges, we work with domain experts to make two key
contributions. First, we present AIMS.uk and AIMS.ca, newly annotated datasets
from the UK and Canada to enable cross-jurisdictional evaluation. Second, we
introduce AIMSCheck, an end-to-end framework for compliance validation.
AIMSCheck decomposes the compliance assessment task into three levels,
enhancing interpretability and practical applicability. Our experiments show
that models trained on an Australian dataset generalize well across UK and
Canadian jurisdictions, demonstrating the potential for broader application in
compliance monitoring. We release the benchmark datasets and AIMSCheck to the
public to advance AI-adoption in compliance assessment and drive further
research in this field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法忽视了蛋白质逆折叠问题的一对多特性，即多种序列可折叠为同一结构，因此需要一种能生成多样化序列的模型。

Method: ProtInvTree采用奖励引导的树搜索框架，分阶段决策（位置选择和残基生成），并通过自评估、前瞻和回溯优化设计路径。

Result: ProtInvTree在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，生成的结构一致且多样化的序列，包括远离原生序列的情况。

Conclusion: ProtInvTree为蛋白质逆折叠提供了一种高效、灵活的生成方法，解决了序列多样性与结构一致性的平衡问题。

Abstract: Designing protein sequences that fold into a target 3D structure, known as
protein inverse folding, is a fundamental challenge in protein engineering.
While recent deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance by
recovering native sequences, they often overlook the one-to-many nature of the
problem: multiple diverse sequences can fold into the same structure. This
motivates the need for a generative model capable of designing diverse
sequences while preserving structural consistency. To address this trade-off,
we introduce ProtInvTree, the first reward-guided tree-search framework for
protein inverse folding. ProtInvTree reformulates sequence generation as a
deliberate, step-wise decision-making process, enabling the exploration of
multiple design paths and exploitation of promising candidates through
self-evaluation, lookahead, and backtracking. We propose a two-stage
focus-and-grounding action mechanism that decouples position selection and
residue generation. To efficiently evaluate intermediate states, we introduce a
jumpy denoising strategy that avoids full rollouts. Built upon pretrained
protein language models, ProtInvTree supports flexible test-time scaling by
expanding the search depth and breadth without retraining. Empirically,
ProtInvTree outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks,
generating structurally consistent yet diverse sequences, including those far
from the native ground truth.

Method: 将2D方向域分布分解为两个1D概率分布函数，用神经网络建模离散坐标的分布，通过插值评估和采样，并通过缓存入射辐射优化训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在复杂光传输场景中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在表达力和效率上取得了平衡，适用于复杂渲染任务。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural path guiding method to aid with Monte
Carlo (MC) integration in rendering. Existing neural methods utilize
distribution representations that are either fast or expressive, but not both.
We propose a simple, but effective, representation that is sufficiently
expressive and reasonably fast. Specifically, we break down the 2D distribution
over the directional domain into two 1D probability distribution functions
(PDF). We propose to model each 1D PDF using a neural network that estimates
the distribution at a set of discrete coordinates. The PDF at an arbitrary
location can then be evaluated and sampled through interpolation. To train the
network, we maximize the similarity of the learned and target distributions. To
reduce the variance of the gradient during optimizations and estimate the
normalization factor, we propose to cache the incoming radiance using an
additional network. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
approach is better than the existing methods, particularly in challenging
scenes with complex light transport.

TL;DR: LensCraft提出了一种数据驱动的方法，结合电影摄影原则和实时动态场景适应能力，解决了自动化拍摄系统中机械执行与创意意图之间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字创作者在将创意转化为精确镜头运动时面临瓶颈，现有系统忽视了主体的方向和体积，限制了空间感知。

Method: 结合专业电影摄影师的技巧，使用专门模拟框架生成高保真训练数据，并通过高级神经模型实现脚本忠实性和动态场景适应。

Result: LensCraft在静态和动态场景中表现出前所未有的准确性和一致性，计算复杂度低且推理速度快。

Conclusion: LensCraft为智能相机系统设定了新基准，提供了灵活的控制方式和高质量输出。

Abstract: Digital creators, from indie filmmakers to animation studios, face a
persistent bottleneck: translating their creative vision into precise camera
movements. Despite significant progress in computer vision and artificial
intelligence, current automated filming systems struggle with a fundamental
trade-off between mechanical execution and creative intent. Crucially, almost
all previous works simplify the subject to a single point-ignoring its
orientation and true volume-severely limiting spatial awareness during filming.
LensCraft solves this problem by mimicking the expertise of a professional
cinematographer, using a data-driven approach that combines cinematographic
principles with the flexibility to adapt to dynamic scenes in real time. Our
solution combines a specialized simulation framework for generating
high-fidelity training data with an advanced neural model that is faithful to
the script while being aware of the volume and dynamic behavior of the subject.
Additionally, our approach allows for flexible control via various input
modalities, including text prompts, subject trajectory and volume, key points,
or a full camera trajectory, offering creators a versatile tool to guide camera
movements in line with their vision. Leveraging a lightweight real time
architecture, LensCraft achieves markedly lower computational complexity and
faster inference while maintaining high output quality. Extensive evaluation
across static and dynamic scenarios reveals unprecedented accuracy and
coherence, setting a new benchmark for intelligent camera systems compared to
state-of-the-art models. Extended results, the complete dataset, simulation
environment, trained model weights, and source code are publicly accessible on

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于文本驱动的4D流场预测框架，用于实时生成3D动画效果，减少了对专业软件和手动建模的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代影视、游戏和AR/VR中，视觉特效（VFX）对沉浸感至关重要，但传统方法需要专业技能且耗时。生成式方法通常计算量大且速度慢。

Method: 将3D动画重新定义为场预测任务，利用大语言模型（LLMs）和视觉语言模型（VLMs）生成函数，通过文本提示实时更新3D高斯的颜色、透明度和位置。

Result: 实验表明，简单的文本指令即可生成动态VFX，显著减少了手动建模和物理模拟的工作量。

Conclusion: 该方法为语言驱动的3D内容创作提供了快速且易于使用的途径，有助于进一步普及VFX技术。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are key to immersion in modern films, games, and AR/VR.
Creating 3D effects requires specialized expertise and training in 3D animation
software and can be time consuming. Generative solutions typically rely on
computationally intense methods such as diffusion models which can be slow at
4D inference. We reformulate 3D animation as a field prediction task and
introduce a text-driven framework that infers a time-varying 4D flow field
acting on 3D Gaussians. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) for function generation, our approach interprets
arbitrary prompts (e.g., "make the vase glow orange, then explode") and
instantly updates color, opacity, and positions of 3D Gaussians in real time.
This design avoids overheads such as mesh extraction, manual or physics-based
simulations and allows both novice and expert users to animate volumetric
scenes with minimal effort on a consumer device even in a web browser.
Experimental results show that simple textual instructions suffice to generate
compelling time-varying VFX, reducing the manual effort typically required for
rigging or advanced modeling. We thus present a fast and accessible pathway to
language-driven 3D content creation that can pave the way to democratize VFX
further.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 论文提出Silencer方法，通过两阶段设计主动保护肖像隐私，解决LDM生成视频的伦理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDM生成的高度逼真视频可能被滥用，现有防御方法无法有效保护肖像隐私。

Method: 提出两阶段方法Silencer：1) 使用nullifying loss忽略音频控制；2) 应用anti-purification loss优化潜在特征生成鲁棒扰动。

Result: 实验证明Silencer能有效保护肖像隐私。

Conclusion: Silencer为AI安全社区提供了解决LDM伦理问题的有效方案。

Abstract: Advances in talking-head animation based on Latent Diffusion Models (LDM)
enable the creation of highly realistic, synchronized videos. These fabricated
videos are indistinguishable from real ones, increasing the risk of potential
misuse for scams, political manipulation, and misinformation. Hence, addressing
these ethical concerns has become a pressing issue in AI security. Recent
proactive defense studies focused on countering LDM-based models by adding
perturbations to portraits. However, these methods are ineffective at
protecting reference portraits from advanced image-to-video animation. The
limitations are twofold: 1) they fail to prevent images from being manipulated
by audio signals, and 2) diffusion-based purification techniques can
effectively eliminate protective perturbations. To address these challenges, we
propose Silencer, a two-stage method designed to proactively protect the
privacy of portraits. First, a nullifying loss is proposed to ignore audio
control in talking-head generation. Second, we apply anti-purification loss in
LDM to optimize the inverted latent feature to generate robust perturbations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Silencer in proactively
protecting portrait privacy. We hope this work will raise awareness among the
AI security community regarding critical ethical issues related to talking-head
generation techniques. Code: https://github.com/yuangan/Silencer.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种阶段感知提示分解框架，通过代理提示引导去噪过程，解决文本到图像扩散模型在概念组合矛盾时的语义准确性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在处理包含矛盾概念组合的提示时，常因学习到的先验知识而产生语义不准确的结果。

Method: 使用大语言模型分析目标提示，识别矛盾并生成替代表达，构建阶段匹配的代理提示以引导去噪过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种挑战性提示下显著提升了图像与文本提示的对齐度。

Conclusion: 通过阶段感知提示分解，实现了对语义的细粒度控制，有效解决了上下文矛盾问题。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse
images from natural language prompts. However, they often fail to produce
semantically accurate results when the prompt contains concept combinations
that contradict their learned priors. We define this failure mode as contextual
contradiction, where one concept implicitly negates another due to entangled
associations learned during training. To address this, we propose a stage-aware
prompt decomposition framework that guides the denoising process using a
sequence of proxy prompts. Each proxy prompt is constructed to match the
semantic content expected to emerge at a specific stage of denoising, while
ensuring contextual coherence. To construct these proxy prompts, we leverage a
large language model (LLM) to analyze the target prompt, identify
contradictions, and generate alternative expressions that preserve the original
intent while resolving contextual conflicts. By aligning prompt information
with the denoising progression, our method enables fine-grained semantic
control and accurate image generation in the presence of contextual
contradictions. Experiments across a variety of challenging prompts show
substantial improvements in alignment to the textual prompt.

TL;DR: GeoChain是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）逐步地理推理能力的大规模基准测试，包含146万张街景图像和3000万问答对，涵盖视觉、空间、文化和精确定位四类推理任务。测试显示当前模型在视觉基础、推理一致性和精确定位方面存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在复杂地理推理任务中表现不足，缺乏系统性评估工具。GeoChain旨在填补这一空白，提供全面的诊断方法以推动技术进步。

Method: 利用146万张Mapillary街景图像，每张图像配以21步链式思维（CoT）问答序列，涵盖四类推理任务，并标注难度。图像还包含语义分割和视觉可定位性评分。

Result: 测试2088张图像的子集显示，当前模型（如GPT-4.1、Claude 3.7、Gemini 2.5）在视觉基础、推理一致性和精确定位方面表现不佳，尤其在复杂推理任务中。

Conclusion: GeoChain为MLLMs的复杂地理推理能力提供了强有力的诊断工具，有助于推动该领域的进一步研究和发展。

Abstract: This paper introduces GeoChain, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating
step-by-step geographic reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Leveraging 1.46 million Mapillary street-level images, GeoChain pairs each
image with a 21-step chain-of-thought (CoT) question sequence (over 30 million
Q&A pairs). These sequences guide models from coarse attributes to fine-grained
localization across four reasoning categories - visual, spatial, cultural, and
precise geolocation - annotated by difficulty. Images are also enriched with
semantic segmentation (150 classes) and a visual locatability score. Our
benchmarking of contemporary MLLMs (GPT-4.1 variants, Claude 3.7, Gemini 2.5
variants) on a diverse 2,088-image subset reveals consistent challenges: models
frequently exhibit weaknesses in visual grounding, display erratic reasoning,
and struggle to achieve accurate localization, especially as the reasoning
complexity escalates. GeoChain offers a robust diagnostic methodology, critical
for fostering significant advancements in complex geographic reasoning within
MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉视频的细微动态和丰富细节信息，因此需要一种更高效的优化方法。

Method: 提出了一种构建偏好对的流程，并结合SynPO优化方法，避免负面偏好主导优化，同时保留模型的语言能力。

Result: 在视频描述和NLP任务中，SynPO均优于DPO变体，训练效率提升20%。

Conclusion: SynPO是一种高效的优化方法，适用于细粒度视频描述任务，并具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Fine-grained video captioning aims to generate detailed, temporally coherent
descriptions of video content. However, existing methods struggle to capture
subtle video dynamics and rich detailed information. In this paper, we leverage
preference learning to enhance the performance of vision-language models in
fine-grained video captioning, while mitigating several limitations inherent to
direct preference optimization (DPO). First, we propose a pipeline for
constructing preference pairs that leverages the intrinsic properties of VLMs
along with partial assistance from large language models, achieving an optimal
balance between cost and data quality. Second, we propose Synergistic
Preference Optimization (SynPO), a novel optimization method offering
significant advantages over DPO and its variants. SynPO prevents negative
preferences from dominating the optimization, explicitly preserves the model's
language capability to avoid deviation of the optimization objective, and
improves training efficiency by eliminating the need for the reference model.
We extensively evaluate SynPO not only on video captioning benchmarks (e.g.,
VDC, VDD, VATEX) but also across well-established NLP tasks, including general
language understanding and preference evaluation, using diverse pretrained
models. Results demonstrate that SynPO consistently outperforms DPO variants
while achieving 20\% improvement in training efficiency. Code is available at

Conclusion: MARS通过多模态框架填补了对话AI中非语言交流的空白。

Abstract: Nonverbal communication is integral to human interaction, with gestures,
facial expressions, and body language conveying critical aspects of intent and
emotion. However, existing large language models (LLMs) fail to effectively
incorporate these nonverbal elements, limiting their capacity to create fully
immersive conversational experiences. We introduce MARS, a multimodal language
model designed to understand and generate nonverbal cues alongside text,
bridging this gap in conversational AI. Our key innovation is VENUS, a
large-scale dataset comprising annotated videos with time-aligned text, facial
expressions, and body language. Leveraging VENUS, we train MARS with a
next-token prediction objective, combining text with vector-quantized nonverbal
representations to achieve multimodal understanding and generation within a
unified framework. Based on various analyses of the VENUS datasets, we validate
its substantial scale and high effectiveness. Our quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that MARS successfully generates text and nonverbal
languages, corresponding to conversational input.

Conclusion: AgentCPM-GUI在移动GUI交互中表现出色，代码和模型已开源以促进研究。

Abstract: The recent progress of large language model agents has opened new
possibilities for automating tasks through graphical user interfaces (GUIs),
especially in mobile environments where intelligent interaction can greatly
enhance usability. However, practical deployment of such agents remains
constrained by several key challenges. Existing training data is often noisy
and lack semantic diversity, which hinders the learning of precise grounding
and planning. Models trained purely by imitation tend to overfit to seen
interface patterns and fail to generalize in unfamiliar scenarios. Moreover,
most prior work focuses on English interfaces while overlooks the growing
diversity of non-English applications such as those in the Chinese mobile
ecosystem. In this work, we present AgentCPM-GUI, an 8B-parameter GUI agent
built for robust and efficient on-device GUI interaction. Our training pipeline
includes grounding-aware pre-training to enhance perception, supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality Chinese and English trajectories to imitate
human-like actions, and reinforcement fine-tuning with GRPO to improve
reasoning capability. We also introduce a compact action space that reduces
output length and supports low-latency execution on mobile devices.
AgentCPM-GUI achieves state-of-the-art performance on five public benchmarks
and a new Chinese GUI benchmark called CAGUI, reaching $96.9\%$ Type-Match and
$91.3\%$ Exact-Match. To facilitate reproducibility and further research, we
publicly release all code, model checkpoint, and evaluation data.

Result: 不同代理表现差异大，LLM行为异常可能导致财务损失，如过度消费或不合理交易。

Conclusion: 自动化虽提升效率，但风险显著，用户需谨慎授权AI代理处理商业决策。

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly used in consumer-facing applications to assist
with tasks such as product search, negotiation, and transaction execution. In
this paper, we explore a future scenario where both consumers and merchants
authorize AI agents to fully automate negotiations and transactions. We aim to
answer two key questions: (1) Do different LLM agents vary in their ability to
secure favorable deals for users? (2) What risks arise from fully automating
deal-making with AI agents in consumer markets? To address these questions, we
develop an experimental framework that evaluates the performance of various LLM
agents in real-world negotiation and transaction settings. Our findings reveal
that AI-mediated deal-making is an inherently imbalanced game -- different
agents achieve significantly different outcomes for their users. Moreover,
behavioral anomalies in LLMs can result in financial losses for both consumers
and merchants, such as overspending or accepting unreasonable deals. These
results underscore that while automation can improve efficiency, it also
introduces substantial risks. Users should exercise caution when delegating
business decisions to AI agents.

enhance reasoning control, we propose a Conditional Distillation Finetuning

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into global applications
necessitates effective cultural alignment for meaningful and
culturally-sensitive interactions. Current LLMs often lack the nuanced
understanding required for diverse cultural contexts, and adapting them
typically involves costly full fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce a
novel soft prompt fine-tuning framework that enables efficient and modular
cultural alignment. Our method utilizes vectorized prompt tuning to dynamically
route queries to a committee of culturally specialized 'expert' LLM
configurations, created by optimizing soft prompt embeddings without altering
the base model's parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework significantly enhances cultural sensitivity and adaptability,
improving alignment scores from 0.208 to 0.820, offering a robust solution for
culturally-aware LLM deployment. This research paves the way for subsequent
investigations into enhanced cultural coverage and dynamic expert adaptation,
crucial for realizing autonomous AI with deeply nuanced understanding in a

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in harnessing the reasoning capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate scientific discovery. While
existing approaches rely on grounding the discovery process within the relevant
literature, effectiveness varies significantly with the quality and nature of
the retrieved literature. We address the challenge of retrieving prior work
whose concepts can inspire solutions for a given research problem, a task we
define as Methodology Inspiration Retrieval (MIR). We construct a novel dataset
tailored for training and evaluating retrievers on MIR, and establish
baselines. To address MIR, we build the Methodology Adjacency Graph (MAG);
capturing methodological lineage through citation relationships. We leverage
MAG to embed an "intuitive prior" into dense retrievers for identifying
patterns of methodological inspiration beyond superficial semantic similarity.
This achieves significant gains of +5.4 in Recall@3 and +7.8 in Mean Average
Precision (mAP) over strong baselines. Further, we adapt LLM-based re-ranking
strategies to MIR, yielding additional improvements of +4.5 in Recall@3 and
+4.8 in mAP. Through extensive ablation studies and qualitative analyses, we
exhibit the promise of MIR in enhancing automated scientific discovery and
outline avenues for advancing inspiration-driven retrieval.

Abstract: Recent progress in reasoning with large language models (LLMs), such as
DeepSeek-R1, demonstrates impressive capabilities in domains like mathematics
and coding, by exhibiting complex cognitive behaviors such as verification,
goal decomposition, and self-reflection. However, it is unclear what behavior
is effective and what behavior is missing for long-horizon AI agents tasks. In
this work, we propose Dyna-Think, a thinking framework that integrates planning
with an internal world model with reasoning and acting to enhance AI agent
performance. To enable Dyna-Think, we propose Dyna-Think Imitation Learning
(DIT) and Dyna-Think Dyna Training (DDT). To initialize a policy with
Dyna-Think, DIT reconstructs the thinking process of R1 to focus on performing
world model simulation relevant to the proposed (and planned) action, and
trains the policy using this reconstructed data. To enhance Dyna-Think, DDT
uses a two-stage training process to first improve the agent's world modeling
ability via objectives such as state prediction or critique generation, and
then improve the agent's action via policy training. We evaluate our methods on
OSWorld, and demonstrate that Dyna-Think improves the agent's in-domain and
out-of-domain performance, achieving similar best-of-n performance compared to
R1 while generating 2x less tokens on average. Our extensive empirical studies
reveal that 1) using critique generation for world model training is effective
to improve policy performance; and 2) AI agents with better performance
correlate with better world modeling abilities. We believe our results suggest
a promising research direction to integrate world model simulation into AI
agents to enhance their reasoning, planning, and acting capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解城市社会经济状况对可持续发展和政策规划至关重要，但现有方法存在挑战。

Method: 构建覆盖17个全球城市的多模态数据集，定义11个预测任务，采用三种评估范式，并对17种LLVMs进行基准测试。

Result: LLVMs在感知和推理方面表现良好，但在预测社会经济指标上仍有局限。

Conclusion: CityLens为诊断LLVMs的局限性提供了统一框架，并指导未来研究。

Abstract: Understanding urban socioeconomic conditions through visual data is a
challenging yet essential task for sustainable urban development and policy
planning. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{CityLens}$, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of large language-vision models
(LLVMs) in predicting socioeconomic indicators from satellite and street view
imagery. We construct a multi-modal dataset covering a total of 17 globally
distributed cities, spanning 6 key domains: economy, education, crime,
transport, health, and environment, reflecting the multifaceted nature of urban
life. Based on this dataset, we define 11 prediction tasks and utilize three
evaluation paradigms: Direct Metric Prediction, Normalized Metric Estimation,
and Feature-Based Regression. We benchmark 17 state-of-the-art LLVMs across
these tasks. Our results reveal that while LLVMs demonstrate promising
perceptual and reasoning capabilities, they still exhibit limitations in
predicting urban socioeconomic indicators. CityLens provides a unified
framework for diagnosing these limitations and guiding future efforts in using
LLVMs to understand and predict urban socioeconomic patterns. Our codes and
datasets are open-sourced via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CityLens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用LLM对图结构的感知和推理能力，DrKGC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DrKGC通过轻量级模型学习结构嵌入和逻辑规则，结合子图检索和GCN适配器增强LLM的提示。

Result: 在两个通用领域和两个生物医学数据集上表现优异，且具有解释性和实用性。

Conclusion: DrKGC在知识图谱补全任务中表现出色，尤其在生物医学领域具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to predict missing triples in knowledge
graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing triples and textual information. Recently,
generative large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly employed for
graph tasks. However, current approaches typically encode graph context in
textual form, which fails to fully exploit the potential of LLMs for perceiving
and reasoning about graph structures. To address this limitation, we propose
DrKGC (Dynamic Subgraph Retrieval-Augmented LLMs for Knowledge Graph
Completion). DrKGC employs a flexible lightweight model training strategy to
learn structural embeddings and logical rules within the KG. It then leverages
a novel bottom-up graph retrieval method to extract a subgraph for each query
guided by the learned rules. Finally, a graph convolutional network (GCN)
adapter uses the retrieved subgraph to enhance the structural embeddings, which
are then integrated into the prompt for effective LLM fine-tuning. Experimental
results on two general domain benchmark datasets and two biomedical datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of DrKGC. Furthermore, a realistic case
study in the biomedical domain highlights its interpretability and practical
utility.

Conclusion: 个性化对齐VLM是可行的，PCogAlignBench和PCogAlign为未来研究提供了工具。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) aligned with general human objectives, such as
being harmless and hallucination-free, have become valuable assistants of
humans in managing visual tasks. However, people with diversified backgrounds
have different cognition even in the same situation. Consequently, they may
have personalized expectations for VLM assistants. This highlights the urgent
need to align VLM assistants with personalized situated cognition for
real-world assistance. To study this problem, we first simplify it by
characterizing individuals based on the sociological concept of Role-Set. Then,
we propose to evaluate the individuals' actions to examine whether the
personalized alignment is achieved. Further, we construct a benchmark named
PCogAlignBench, which includes 18k instances and 20 individuals with different
Role-Sets. Finally, we present a framework called PCogAlign, which constructs a
cognition-aware and action-based reward model for personalized alignment.
Experimental results and human evaluations demonstrate the reliability of the
PCogAlignBench and the effectiveness of our proposed PCogAlign. We will
open-source the constructed benchmark and code at

<details>

Motivation: 现有ToM方法依赖结构化流程或深度模型微调，难以在多模态环境中扩展且无法适应复杂任务。

Method: 采用弱到强控制策略，让小语言模型专注于ToM似然估计，并将推理行为转移到大语言模型中。

Result: 在多模态ToM基准测试中，准确率提升4.6%，尤其在未见场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂环境中建模人类心理状态设立了新标准。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) enables humans to infer mental states-such as beliefs,
desires, and intentions-forming the foundation of social cognition. However,
existing computational ToM methods rely on structured workflows with
ToM-specific priors or deep model fine-tuning, which struggle with scalability
in multimodal environments and fail to generalize as task complexity increases.
To address these limitations, we propose a scalable Bayesian ToM planner that
decomposes ToM reasoning into stepwise Bayesian updates. Our framework
introduces weak-to-strong control, allowing smaller language models (LMs) to
specialize in ToM-specific likelihood estimation and transfer their reasoning
behaviors to larger LMs (7B to 405B) for integration with social and world
knowledge. This synergistic approach aligns large-model inference of human
mental states with Bayesian principles. Extensive experiments show that our
method achieves a 4.6% accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art techniques on
multimodal ToM benchmarks, including challenging unseen scenarios, thereby
establishing a new standard for modeling human mental states in complex
environments.

Conclusion: 需政策促进多样性和透明度，以减少匿名在线环境中LLM生成的偏见传播。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent
systems that simulate real-world interactions with near-human reasoning. While
previous studies have extensively examined biases related to protected
attributes such as race, the emergence and propagation of biases on socially
contentious issues in multi-agent LLM interactions remain underexplored. This
study explores how LLM agents shape public opinion through debates on five
contentious topics. By simulating over 2,500 debates, we analyze how initially
neutral agents, assigned a centrist disposition, adopt specific stances over
time. Statistical analyses reveal significant group conformity mirroring human
behavior; LLM agents tend to align with numerically dominant groups or more
intelligent agents, exerting a greater influence. These findings underscore the
crucial role of agent intelligence in shaping discourse and highlight the risks
of bias amplification in online interactions. Our results emphasize the need
for policy measures that promote diversity and transparency in LLM-generated
discussions to mitigate the risks of bias propagation within anonymous online
environments.

Abstract: The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Scientist represents a paradigm
shift in scientific discovery, with large language models (LLMs) taking the
lead as the primary executor in the entire scientific workflow from idea
generation to experiment implementation. Recent AI Scientist studies
demonstrate sufficient capabilities for independent scientific discovery, with
the generated research reports gaining acceptance at the ICLR 2025 workshop and
ACL 2025, arguing that a human-level AI Scientist, capable of uncovering
phenomena previously unknown to humans, may be imminent. Despite this
substantial progress, AI Scientist has yet to produce a groundbreaking
achievement in the domain of computer science on par with automated scientific
tools. Based on extensive quantitative evidence from existing benchmarks in
complex engineering tasks and a systematic evaluation assess 28 research papers
generated by five advanced AI Scientist systems, we argue that \textbf{the
fundamental bottleneck for AI Scientists lies in their capability to execute
the requisite verification procedures.} Current AI Scientist systems lack the
execution capabilities needed to execute rigorous experiments and produce
high-quality scientific papers. To better illustrate the root cause of this
\textbf{implementation gap}, we provide an in-depth discussion on the
fundamental limitations of AI Scientist. This position paper aims to call for

Result: 实验表明PGPO在代表性代理基准上表现优异，优于当前领先基线。

Conclusion: P-code Plan和PGPO显著提升了LLM代理的推理能力和泛化效率。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities
in handling complex interactive problems. Existing LLM agents mainly generate
natural language plans to guide reasoning, which is verbose and inefficient. NL
plans are also tailored to specific tasks and restrict agents' ability to
generalize across similar tasks. To this end, we explore pseudocode-style plans
(P-code Plan) to capture the structural logic of reasoning. We find that P-code
Plan empowers LLM agents with stronger generalization ability and more
efficiency. Inspired by this finding, we propose a pseudocode-style Planning
Guided Preference Optimization method called PGPO for effective agent learning.
With two planning-oriented rewards, PGPO further enhances LLM agents' ability
to generate high-quality P-code Plans and subsequent reasoning. Experiments
show that PGPO achieves superior performance on representative agent benchmarks
and outperforms the current leading baselines. Analyses reveal the advantage of
PGPO in reducing action errors and omissions during reasoning.

Conclusion: 研究指出了多模态AI中的关键挑战和未来研究方向。

Abstract: Querying generative AI models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), has become
a prevalent method for information acquisition. However, existing query-answer
datasets primarily focus on textual responses, making it challenging to address
complex user queries that require visual demonstrations or explanations for
better understanding. To bridge this gap, we construct a benchmark,
RealVideoQuest, designed to evaluate the abilities of text-to-video (T2V)
models in answering real-world, visually grounded queries. It identifies 7.5K
real user queries with video response intents from Chatbot-Arena and builds
4.5K high-quality query-video pairs through a multistage video retrieval and
refinement process. We further develop a multi-angle evaluation system to
assess the quality of generated video answers. Experiments indicate that
current T2V models struggle with effectively addressing real user queries,
pointing to key challenges and future research opportunities in multimodal AI.

Method: 提出自我挑战框架，智能体先作为挑战者生成任务（Code-as-Task形式），再作为执行者通过强化学习训练。

Result: 在M3ToolEval和TauBench基准测试中，Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct性能提升两倍以上。

Conclusion: 自我挑战框架仅依赖自生成数据即可显著提升智能体的工具使用能力。

Abstract: Large language models are quickly becoming the foundation for intelligent
agents that are capable of using tools. However, training such agents is
challenging because it requires human creation and annotation of a diverse set
of tasks, tools, and evaluation criteria. In this paper, we propose the
Self-Challenging framework for training an agent on high-quality tasks that are
generated by itself. The agent first plays the role of challenger and generates
a task after interacting with the given tools. The tasks take the form of a
novel general class of problems termed Code-as-Task, which are defined by an
instruction, a verification function and solution and failure cases which serve
as tests, allowing to filter only for high-quality tasks. The agent then takes
an executor role and trains on those tasks with reinforcement learning using
the evaluation feedback as a reward. Evaluation on two existing multi-turn
tool-use agent benchmarks, M3ToolEval and TauBench, shows the Self-Challenging
framework achieves over a two-fold improvement in Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct,
despite using only self-generated training data.

Motivation: 任务导向对话系统中，用户表达常缺乏结构信息，而系统需精确意图定义。现有LLM代理无法区分语言完整性和上下文触发表达，缺乏协作意图形成框架。

Method: 提出STORM框架，通过UserLLM（完全内部访问）和AgentLLM（仅可观察行为）对话建模信息不对称动态，生成标注语料库。

Result: 实验显示40-60%的不确定性在某些场景下优于完全透明，模型特定模式提示需重新考虑人机协作中信息完整性的最优水平。

Conclusion: STORM为理解不对称推理动态提供了新视角，并为不确定性校准的对话系统设计提供了依据。

Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue systems often face difficulties when user utterances
seem semantically complete but lack necessary structural information for
appropriate system action. This arises because users frequently do not fully
understand their own needs, while systems require precise intent definitions.
Current LLM-based agents cannot effectively distinguish between linguistically
complete and contextually triggerable expressions, lacking frameworks for
collaborative intent formation. We present STORM, a framework modeling
asymmetric information dynamics through conversations between UserLLM (full
internal access) and AgentLLM (observable behavior only). STORM produces
annotated corpora capturing expression trajectories and latent cognitive
transitions, enabling systematic analysis of collaborative understanding
development. Our contributions include: (1) formalizing asymmetric information
processing in dialogue systems; (2) modeling intent formation tracking
collaborative understanding evolution; and (3) evaluation metrics measuring
internal cognitive improvements alongside task performance. Experiments across
four language models reveal that moderate uncertainty (40-60%) can outperform
complete transparency in certain scenarios, with model-specific patterns
suggesting reconsideration of optimal information completeness in human-AI
collaboration. These findings contribute to understanding asymmetric reasoning
dynamics and inform uncertainty-calibrated dialogue system design.

Result: 模型能学习隐写编码并泛化至未见过的字符串，但底层推理方式未变。

Conclusion: 惩罚特定字符串可能导致模型隐写推理，威胁CoT监控的可靠性，需更深入的研究。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning not only enhances large language model
performance but also provides critical insights into decision-making processes,
marking it as a useful tool for monitoring model intent and planning. By
proactively preventing models from acting on CoT indicating misaligned or
harmful intent, CoT monitoring can be used to reduce risks associated with
deploying models. However, developers may be incentivized to train away the
appearance of harmful intent from CoT traces, by either customer preferences or
regulatory requirements. Recent works have shown that banning mention of a
specific example of reward hacking, which may be done either to make CoT
presentable to users or as a naive attempt to prevent the behavior, causes
obfuscation of the undesired reasoning traces but the persistence of the
undesired behavior. Such obfuscation threatens the reliability of CoT
monitoring. However, obfuscation of reasoning can be due to its internalization
to latent space computation, or its encoding within the CoT. Here, we provide
an extension to these results. First, we show that penalizing the use of
specific strings within load-bearing reasoning traces causes models to
substitute alternative strings. Crucially, this does not alter the underlying
method by which the model performs the task, demonstrating that the model can
learn to steganographically encode its reasoning. We further demonstrate that
models can generalize an encoding scheme. When the penalized strings belong to
an overarching class, the model learns not only to substitute strings seen in
training, but also develops a general encoding scheme for all members of the
class which it can apply to held-out testing strings.

Motivation: 传统不确定性度量（如体素蒙特卡洛方差）不适合表面放置的不确定性建模，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Conclusion: UNSURF是一种有效的皮质表面重建不确定性度量方法，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We propose UNSURF, a novel uncertainty measure for cortical surface
reconstruction of clinical brain MRI scans of any orientation, resolution, and

distance functions (SDFs) and the actual SDFs of the fitted surfaces. Our
experiments on real clinical scans show that traditional uncertainty measures,
such as voxel-wise Monte Carlo variance, are not suitable for modeling the
uncertainty of surface placement. Our results demonstrate that UNSURF estimates
correlate well with the ground truth errors and: \textit{(i)}~enable effective
automated quality control of surface reconstructions at the subject-, parcel-,
mesh node-level; and \textit{(ii)}~improve performance on a downstream

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了跨模态配准的准确性和实用性，为前列腺癌诊断提供了新工具。

Abstract: The diagnosis of prostate cancer increasingly depends on multimodal imaging,
particularly magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and transrectal ultrasound
(TRUS). However, accurate registration between these modalities remains a
fundamental challenge due to the differences in dimensionality and anatomical
representations. In this work, we present a novel framework that addresses
these challenges through a two-stage process: TRUS 3D reconstruction followed
by cross-modal registration. Unlike existing TRUS 3D reconstruction methods
that rely heavily on external probe tracking information, we propose a totally
probe-location-independent approach that leverages the natural correlation
between sagittal and transverse TRUS views. With the help of our
clustering-based feature matching method, we enable the spatial localization of
2D frames without any additional probe tracking information. For the
registration stage, we introduce an unsupervised diffusion-based framework
guided by modality translation. Unlike existing methods that translate one
modality into another, we map both MR and US into a pseudo intermediate
modality. This design enables us to customize it to retain only
registration-critical features, greatly easing registration. To further enhance
anatomical alignment, we incorporate an anatomy-aware registration strategy
that prioritizes internal structural coherence while adaptively reducing the
influence of boundary inconsistencies. Extensive validation demonstrates that
our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior
registration accuracy with physically realistic deformations in a completely
unsupervised fashion.

Abstract: With the advancement of modern medicine and the development of technologies
such as MRI, CT, and cellular analysis, it has become increasingly critical for
clinicians to accurately interpret various diagnostic images. However, modern
medical education often faces challenges due to limited access to high-quality

educational resources (Balogh et al., 2015). In this context, image data
generated by machine learning models, particularly generative models, presents
a promising solution. These models can create diverse and comparable imaging
datasets without compromising patient privacy, thereby supporting modern
medical education. In this study, we explore the use of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and CycleGAN (Zhu et al., 2017) for generating synthetic

TL;DR: CineMA是一种基于自监督学习的AI模型，用于自动化心脏磁共振（CMR）图像分析，减少标注需求并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CMR测量方法耗时且主观，需自动化解决方案。

Method: CineMA通过自监督自动编码器在74,916个CMR研究中预训练，并通过微调完成多种任务。

Result: CineMA在23个任务中表现优于CNN，且标注效率更高。

Conclusion: CineMA为心脏影像分析提供了高效基础模型，促进临床转化。

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a key investigation in clinical
cardiovascular medicine and has been used extensively in population research.
However, extracting clinically important measurements such as ejection fraction
for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases remains time-consuming and subjective.
We developed CineMA, a foundation AI model automating these tasks with limited
labels. CineMA is a self-supervised autoencoder model trained on 74,916 cine
CMR studies to reconstruct images from masked inputs. After fine-tuning, it was
evaluated across eight datasets on 23 tasks from four categories: ventricle and
myocardium segmentation, left and right ventricle ejection fraction
calculation, disease detection and classification, and landmark localisation.
CineMA is the first foundation model for cine CMR to match or outperform
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CineMA demonstrated greater label
efficiency than CNNs, achieving comparable or better performance with fewer
annotations. This reduces the burden of clinician labelling and supports
replacing task-specific training with fine-tuning foundation models in future
cardiac imaging applications. Models and code for pre-training and fine-tuning
are available at https://github.com/mathpluscode/CineMA, democratising access
to high-performance models that otherwise require substantial computational
resources, promoting reproducibility and accelerating clinical translation.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the NTIRE 2025
challenge on the 2nd Restore Any Image Model (RAIM) in the Wild. This challenge
established a new benchmark for real-world image restoration, featuring diverse
scenarios with and without reference ground truth. Participants were tasked
with restoring real-captured images suffering from complex and unknown
degradations, where both perceptual quality and fidelity were critically
evaluated. The challenge comprised two tracks: (1) the low-light joint
denoising and demosaicing (JDD) task, and (2) the image detail
enhancement/generation task. Each track included two sub-tasks. The first
sub-task involved paired data with available ground truth, enabling
quantitative evaluation. The second sub-task dealt with real-world yet unpaired
images, emphasizing restoration efficiency and subjective quality assessed
through a comprehensive user study. In total, the challenge attracted nearly
300 registrations, with 51 teams submitting more than 600 results. The
top-performing methods advanced the state of the art in image restoration and
received unanimous recognition from all 20+ expert judges. The datasets used in

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了从sRGB图像重建RAW传感器图像的挑战（反向ISP），提出了高效模型并建立了最新基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于RAW数据集稀缺且昂贵，而sRGB数据集丰富，研究旨在通过反向ISP技术从sRGB图像生成真实RAW数据。

Method: 通过挑战赛形式，吸引了150多名参与者提交高效模型，尝试从sRGB图像恢复RAW图像（无元数据）。

Result: 提出的方法和基准确立了生成真实RAW数据的最新技术水平。

Conclusion: 该研究为RAW数据生成提供了新方向，并展示了反向ISP技术的潜力。

Abstract: Numerous low-level vision tasks operate in the RAW domain due to its linear
properties, bit depth, and sensor designs. Despite this, RAW image datasets are
scarce and more expensive to collect than the already large and public sRGB
datasets. For this reason, many approaches try to generate realistic RAW images
using sensor information and sRGB images. This paper covers the second
challenge on RAW Reconstruction from sRGB (Reverse ISP). We aim to recover RAW
sensor images from smartphones given the corresponding sRGB images without
metadata and, by doing this, ``reverse" the ISP transformation. Over 150
participants joined this NTIRE 2025 challenge and submitted efficient models.
The proposed methods and benchmark establish the state-of-the-art for
generating realistic RAW data.

Method: 通过公开多中心数据集，支持开发基于AI的MRI乳腺癌检测工具。

Result: 提出了利用AI和MRI技术提高乳腺癌检测效率的潜在解决方案。

Conclusion: AI辅助MRI检测有望提升乳腺癌早期筛查的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Detecting breast cancer early is of the utmost importance to effectively
treat the millions of women afflicted by breast cancer worldwide every year.
Although mammography is the primary imaging modality for screening breast
cancer, there is an increasing interest in adding magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to screening programmes, particularly for women at high risk. Recent
guidelines by the European Society of Breast Imaging (EUSOBI) recommended
breast MRI as a supplemental screening tool for women with dense breast tissue.
However, acquiring and reading MRI scans requires significantly more time from
expert radiologists. This highlights the need to develop new automated methods
to detect cancer accurately using MRI and Artificial Intelligence (AI), which
have the potential to support radiologists in breast MRI interpretation and
classification and help detect cancer earlier. For this reason, the ODELIA
consortium has made this multi-centre dataset publicly available to assist in
developing AI tools for the detection of breast cancer on MRI.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在傅里叶域中建立噪声监督的方法，解决了现有方法在处理空间相关噪声和像素级损失函数时的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减轻数据收集负担并提升深度学习的实用性，但现有方法无法有效处理空间相关噪声且监督信息有限。

Result: 实验验证了该方法在定量指标和感知质量上的优异表现。

Conclusion: 傅里叶域噪声监督为多种图像恢复任务提供了统一且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Noisy supervision refers to supervising image restoration learning with noisy
targets. It can alleviate the data collection burden and enhance the practical
applicability of deep learning techniques. However, existing methods suffer
from two key drawbacks. Firstly, they are ineffective in handling spatially
correlated noise commonly observed in practical applications such as low-light
imaging and remote sensing. Secondly, they rely on pixel-wise loss functions
that only provide limited supervision information. This work addresses these
challenges by leveraging the Fourier domain. We highlight that the Fourier
coefficients of spatially correlated noise exhibit sparsity and independence,
making them easier to handle. Additionally, Fourier coefficients contain global
information, enabling more significant supervision. Motivated by these
insights, we propose to establish noisy supervision in the Fourier domain. We
first prove that Fourier coefficients of a wide range of noise converge in
distribution to the Gaussian distribution. Exploiting this statistical
property, we establish the equivalence between using noisy targets and clean
targets in the Fourier domain. This leads to a unified learning framework
applicable to various image restoration tasks, diverse network architectures,
and different noise models. Extensive experiments validate the outstanding
performance of this framework in terms of both quantitative indices and
perceptual quality.

TL;DR: GLEN是一种新的生成式检索方法，通过动态词汇标识符和两阶段索引学习策略解决现有生成式检索的挑战，并在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式检索避免了构建辅助索引结构，但面临预训练语言模型知识与标识符之间的差异以及训练与推理之间的差距问题。

Method: GLEN采用动态词汇标识符和两阶段索引学习策略，学习有意义的词汇标识符和查询与文档之间的相关性信号。推理时使用无冲突推理和标识符权重排序文档。

Result: GLEN在NQ320k、MS MARCO和BEIR等基准数据集上达到或优于现有生成式检索方法的性能。

Conclusion: GLEN通过创新的索引学习和推理策略，成功解决了生成式检索的挑战，并展示了优越的性能。

Abstract: Generative retrieval shed light on a new paradigm of document retrieval,
aiming to directly generate the identifier of a relevant document for a query.
While it takes advantage of bypassing the construction of auxiliary index
structures, existing studies face two significant challenges: (i) the
discrepancy between the knowledge of pre-trained language models and
identifiers and (ii) the gap between training and inference that poses
difficulty in learning to rank. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel generative retrieval method, namely Generative retrieval via LExical
iNdex learning (GLEN). For training, GLEN effectively exploits a dynamic
lexical identifier using a two-phase index learning strategy, enabling it to
learn meaningful lexical identifiers and relevance signals between queries and
documents. For inference, GLEN utilizes collision-free inference, using
identifier weights to rank documents without additional overhead. Experimental
results prove that GLEN achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance
against existing generative retrieval methods on various benchmark datasets,
e.g., NQ320k, MS MARCO, and BEIR. The code is available at
https://github.com/skleee/GLEN.

TL;DR: 本文综述了检索增强生成（RAG）的最新进展，分析了其架构分类、优化方法及性能评估，并探讨了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG通过结合外部证据增强语言模型的生成能力，但面临检索质量、鲁棒性等新挑战。本文旨在系统总结RAG研究现状。

Method: 提出分类法将RAG架构分为检索中心、生成中心、混合和鲁棒性设计，并分析优化方法及性能评估框架。

Result: 揭示了检索精度与生成灵活性、效率与忠实性之间的权衡，并总结了现有评估趋势。

Conclusion: 指出未来研究方向，如自适应检索架构、实时检索集成和多跳推理，为下一代RAG系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance large language models (LLMs) by conditioning generation on external
evidence retrieved at inference time. While RAG addresses critical limitations
of parametric knowledge storage-such as factual inconsistency and domain
inflexibility-it introduces new challenges in retrieval quality, grounding
fidelity, pipeline efficiency, and robustness against noisy or adversarial
inputs. This survey provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent advances in
RAG systems, offering a taxonomy that categorizes architectures into
retriever-centric, generator-centric, hybrid, and robustness-oriented designs.
We systematically analyze enhancements across retrieval optimization, context
filtering, decoding control, and efficiency improvements, supported by
comparative performance analyses on short-form and multi-hop question answering
tasks. Furthermore, we review state-of-the-art evaluation frameworks and
benchmarks, highlighting trends in retrieval-aware evaluation, robustness
testing, and federated retrieval settings. Our analysis reveals recurring
trade-offs between retrieval precision and generation flexibility, efficiency
and faithfulness, and modularity and coordination. We conclude by identifying
open challenges and future research directions, including adaptive retrieval
architectures, real-time retrieval integration, structured reasoning over
multi-hop evidence, and privacy-preserving retrieval mechanisms. This survey
aims to consolidate current knowledge in RAG research and serve as a foundation
for the next generation of retrieval-augmented language modeling systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索器依赖纯文本预训练的语言模型，存在领域不对齐和结构忽略问题，限制了其在GRAG中的效果。

Method: 提出GPR，直接基于知识图谱预训练，通过LLM引导的图增强对齐自然语言问题与相关子图，并采用结构感知目标学习细粒度检索策略。

Result: 在两个数据集、三个LLM主干和五个基线上的实验表明，GPR显著提升了检索质量和下游生成效果。

Conclusion: GPR是一种有效的GRAG检索解决方案，具有鲁棒性和广泛适用性。

Abstract: Graph retrieval-augmented generation (GRAG) places high demands on
graph-specific retrievers. However, existing retrievers often rely on language
models pretrained on plain text, limiting their effectiveness due to domain
misalignment and structure ignorance. To address these challenges, we propose
GPR, a graph-based retriever pretrained directly on knowledge graphs. GPR
aligns natural language questions with relevant subgraphs through LLM-guided
graph augmentation and employs a structure-aware objective to learn
fine-grained retrieval strategies. Experiments on two datasets, three LLM
backbones, and five baselines show that GPR consistently improves both
retrieval quality and downstream generation, demonstrating its effectiveness as
a robust retrieval solution for GRAG.

TL;DR: BMEmbed是一种新方法，通过利用BM25的关键词检索技术，将通用文本嵌入模型适配到私有数据集上，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用文本嵌入模型在私有数据集（如公司专有数据）上表现不佳，因为这些数据包含专业术语和行话。

Result: 在多个领域、数据集和模型上验证了BMEmbed的检索性能提升。

Conclusion: BM25信号通过促进对齐和均匀性改善了嵌入模型，为领域特定数据适配提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Text embedding models play a cornerstone role in AI applications, such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While general-purpose text embedding
models demonstrate strong performance on generic retrieval benchmarks, their
effectiveness diminishes when applied to private datasets (e.g.,
company-specific proprietary data), which often contain specialized terminology
and lingo. In this work, we introduce BMEmbed, a novel method for adapting
general-purpose text embedding models to private datasets. By leveraging the
well-established keyword-based retrieval technique (BM25), we construct
supervisory signals from the ranking of keyword-based retrieval results to
facilitate model adaptation. We evaluate BMEmbed across a range of domains,
datasets, and models, showing consistent improvements in retrieval performance.
Moreover, we provide empirical insights into how BM25-based signals contribute
to improving embeddings by fostering alignment and uniformity, highlighting the
value of this approach in adapting models to domain-specific data. We release
the source code available at https://github.com/BaileyWei/BMEmbed for the
research community.

TL;DR: Conv2Query框架通过将对话上下文映射为ad-hoc查询，解决了PSC中输入不匹配的问题，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PSC方法直接使用对话上下文作为ad-hoc检索器的输入，但由于输入长度和噪声问题，检索质量受限。

Method: 提出Conv2Query框架，将对话上下文转换为ad-hoc查询，适配ad-hoc检索器。

Result: 在两个PSC数据集上的实验表明，Conv2Query显著提升了检索性能。

Conclusion: Conv2Query有效解决了PSC中的输入不匹配问题，为检索性能提供了显著改进。

Abstract: Proactive search in conversations (PSC) aims to reduce user effort in
formulating explicit queries by proactively retrieving useful relevant
information given conversational context. Previous work in PSC either directly
uses this context as input to off-the-shelf ad-hoc retrievers or further
fine-tunes them on PSC data. However, ad-hoc retrievers are pre-trained on
short and concise queries, while the PSC input is longer and noisier. This
input mismatch between ad-hoc search and PSC limits retrieval quality. While
fine-tuning on PSC data helps, its benefits remain constrained by this input
gap. In this work, we propose Conv2Query, a novel conversation-to-query
framework that adapts ad-hoc retrievers to PSC by bridging the input gap
between ad-hoc search and PSC. Conv2Query maps conversational context into
ad-hoc queries, which can either be used as input for off-the-shelf ad-hoc
retrievers or for further fine-tuning on PSC data. Extensive experiments on two
PSC datasets show that Conv2Query significantly improves ad-hoc retrievers'
performance, both when used directly and after fine-tuning on PSC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐方法在隐式项目关系和冗长项目信息利用上存在局限性，GRAM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 设计了语义到词汇的翻译和多粒度延迟融合技术，分别编码隐式关系并高效整合丰富语义。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，GRAM显著优于现有模型，Recall@5提升11.5-16.0%，NDCG@5提升5.3-13.6%。

Conclusion: GRAM通过创新技术有效提升了生成式推荐的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Generative recommendation is an emerging paradigm that leverages the
extensive knowledge of large language models by formulating recommendations
into a text-to-text generation task. However, existing studies face two key
limitations in (i) incorporating implicit item relationships and (ii) utilizing
rich yet lengthy item information. To address these challenges, we propose a
Generative Recommender via semantic-Aware Multi-granular late fusion (GRAM),
introducing two synergistic innovations. First, we design semantic-to-lexical
translation to encode implicit hierarchical and collaborative item
relationships into the vocabulary space of LLMs. Second, we present
multi-granular late fusion to integrate rich semantics efficiently with minimal
information loss. It employs separate encoders for multi-granular prompts,
delaying the fusion until the decoding stage. Experiments on four benchmark
datasets show that GRAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art generative
recommendation models, achieving significant improvements of 11.5-16.0% in
Recall@5 and 5.3-13.6% in NDCG@5. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界语料库持续演变，导致检索器的训练分布偏移，若不及时更新或重新训练，新文档的索引会降低未来查询的检索性能。

Method: 提出GradNormIR，一种基于梯度范数的无监督方法，用于检测OOD语料库。

Result: 在BEIR基准测试中，GradNormIR显著提升了密集检索器的更新效率和检索鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GradNormIR能有效预测OOD语料库，为检索系统的主动管理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Dense retrievers encode texts into embeddings to efficiently retrieve
relevant documents from large databases in response to user queries. However,
real-world corpora continually evolve, leading to a shift from the original
training distribution of the retriever. Without timely updates or retraining,
indexing newly emerging documents can degrade retrieval performance for future
queries. Thus, identifying when a dense retriever requires an update is
critical for maintaining robust retrieval systems. In this paper, we propose a
novel task of predicting whether a corpus is out-of-distribution (OOD) relative
to a dense retriever before indexing. Addressing this task allows us to
proactively manage retriever updates, preventing potential retrieval failures.
We introduce GradNormIR, an unsupervised approach that leverages gradient norms
to detect OOD corpora effectively. Experiments on the BEIR benchmark
demonstrate that GradNormIR enables timely updates of dense retrievers in
evolving document collections, significantly enhancing retrieval robustness and
efficiency.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在代码迁移任务中的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 设计CODEMENV基准，包含三个核心任务：识别不兼容函数、检测函数定义变化、适配目标环境代码。

Result: LLMs在代码迁移中表现有限，平均通过率26.50%，GPT-4O表现最佳（43.84%）。

Conclusion: LLMs在代码迁移任务中仍有改进空间，尤其是逻辑一致性方面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various software engineering tasks; however, their effectiveness in code
migration, adapting code to run in different environments, remains
insufficiently studied. In this work, we introduce CODEMENV: Code Migration
Across Environment, a new benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs'
abilities in code migration scenarios. CODEMENV consists of 922 examples
spanning 19 Python and Java packages, and covers three core tasks: (1)
identifying functions incompatible with specific versions, (2) detecting
changes in function definitions, and (3) adapting code to target environments.
Experimental evaluation with seven LLMs on CODEMENV yields an average pass@1
rate of 26.50%, with GPT-4O achieving the highest score at 43.84%. Key findings
include: (i) LLMs tend to be more proficient with newer function versions,
which aids in migrating legacy code, and (ii) LLMs sometimes exhibit logical
inconsistencies by identifying function changes irrelevant to the intended
migration environment. The datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: BLV人群难以通过视觉比较学习视频内容，需要非视觉支持。视觉康复治疗师（VRTs）的指导方式启发了Vid2Coach的设计。

Method: Vid2Coach从视频生成可访问的指令，结合非视觉替代方案，并通过智能眼镜的摄像头监控用户进度，提供上下文感知的反馈。

Result: BLV参与者使用Vid2Coach时，烹饪任务的错误率减少了58.5%，并表示希望在日常中使用该系统。

Conclusion: Vid2Coach展示了AI视觉辅助的潜力，能够增强而非取代非视觉专业知识。

Abstract: People use videos to learn new recipes, exercises, and crafts. Such videos
remain difficult for blind and low vision (BLV) people to follow as they rely
on visual comparison. Our observations of visual rehabilitation therapists
(VRTs) guiding BLV people to follow how-to videos revealed that VRTs provide
both proactive and responsive support including detailed descriptions,
non-visual workarounds, and progress feedback. We propose Vid2Coach, a system
that transforms how-to videos into wearable camera-based assistants that
provide accessible instructions and mixed-initiative feedback. From the video,
Vid2Coach generates accessible instructions by augmenting narrated instructions
with demonstration details and completion criteria for each step. It then uses
retrieval-augmented-generation to extract relevant non-visual workarounds from
BLV-specific resources. Vid2Coach then monitors user progress with a camera
embedded in commercial smart glasses to provide context-aware instructions,
proactive feedback, and answers to user questions. BLV participants (N=8) using
Vid2Coach completed cooking tasks with 58.5\% fewer errors than when using
their typical workflow and wanted to use Vid2Coach in their daily lives.
Vid2Coach demonstrates an opportunity for AI visual assistance that strengthens
rather than replaces non-visual expertise.

### [464] [PerFormer: A Permutation Based Vision Transformer for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00259)
*Zhengyang Fan,Wanru Li,Kuo-chu Chang,Ting Yuan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于排列的视觉变换器方法PerFormer，用于提升多变量时间序列数据的剩余使用寿命（RUL）预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉变换器（ViT）在图像任务中表现优于卷积神经网络（CNN），但直接应用于时间序列数据存在空间信息模糊的挑战。

Method: 通过排列多变量时间序列数据模拟图像空间特性，并设计新的排列损失函数生成排列矩阵。

Result: 在NASA的C-MAPSS数据集上，PerFormer表现优于CNN、RNN和其他变换器模型。

Conclusion: PerFormer在PHM应用中具有显著潜力和有效性。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the remaining useful life (RUL) for degradation systems
is crucial in modern prognostic and health management (PHM). Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs), initially developed for tasks like image and video
recognition, have proven highly effectively in RUL prediction, demonstrating
remarkable performance. However, with the emergence of the Vision Transformer
(ViT), a Transformer model tailored for computer vision tasks such as image
classification, and its demonstrated superiority over CNNs, there is a natural
inclination to explore its potential in enhancing RUL prediction accuracy.
Nonetheless, applying ViT directly to multivariate sensor data for RUL
prediction poses challenges, primarily due to the ambiguous nature of spatial
information in time series data. To address this issue, we introduce the
PerFormer, a permutation-based vision transformer approach designed to permute
multivariate time series data, mimicking spatial characteristics akin to image
data, thereby making it suitable for ViT. To generate the desired permutation
matrix, we introduce a novel permutation loss function aimed at guiding the
convergence of any matrix towards a permutation matrix. Our experiments on
NASA's C-MAPSS dataset demonstrate the PerFormer's superior performance in RUL
prediction compared to state-of-the-art methods employing CNNs, Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), and various Transformer models. This underscores its
effectiveness and potential in PHM applications.

### [465] [Foresight: Adaptive Layer Reuse for Accelerated and High-Quality Text-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00329)
*Muhammad Adnan,Nithesh Kurella,Akhil Arunkumar,Prashant J. Nair*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Foresight是一种自适应层重用技术，通过动态识别和重用DiT块输出来减少计算冗余，显著提升视频生成效率，同时保持质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DiTs在文本到图像和视频生成中表现优异，但其大模型尺寸和时空注意力的二次成本导致计算开销巨大。静态缓存虽能部分缓解，但无法适应生成动态，导致速度与质量的次优权衡。

Method: 提出Foresight技术，动态识别并重用所有层和步骤中的DiT块输出，根据生成参数（如分辨率和去噪计划）优化效率。

Result: 在OpenSora、Latte和CogVideoX上应用Foresight，实现了1.63倍的端到端加速，同时保持视频质量。

Conclusion: Foresight有效解决了DiTs的计算冗余问题，显著提升了视频生成的效率，且不影响性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) achieve state-of-the-art results in
text-to-image, text-to-video generation, and editing. However, their large
model size and the quadratic cost of spatial-temporal attention over multiple
denoising steps make video generation computationally expensive. Static caching
mitigates this by reusing features across fixed steps but fails to adapt to
generation dynamics, leading to suboptimal trade-offs between speed and
quality.
  We propose Foresight, an adaptive layer-reuse technique that reduces
computational redundancy across denoising steps while preserving baseline
performance. Foresight dynamically identifies and reuses DiT block outputs for
all layers across steps, adapting to generation parameters such as resolution
and denoising schedules to optimize efficiency. Applied to OpenSora, Latte, and
CogVideoX, Foresight achieves up to 1.63x end-to-end speedup, while maintaining
video quality. The source code of Foresight is available at
\texttt{https://github.com/STAR-Laboratory/foresight}.

### [466] [SST: Self-training with Self-adaptive Thresholding for Semi-supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00467)
*Shuai Zhao,Heyan Huang,Xinge Li,Xiaokang Chen,Rui Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SST的半监督学习框架，通过自适应的阈值机制（SAT）高效选择高质量伪标签，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中获取高质量标注数据成本高，现有半监督学习方法依赖固定阈值或更新阈值效率低。

Method: 提出SST框架，引入SAT机制动态调整类别特定阈值，优化伪标签选择。

Result: SST在ImageNet-1K上仅用1%/10%标注数据达到80.7%/84.9% Top-1准确率，优于全监督模型。

Conclusion: SST通过自适应阈值机制实现了高效、可扩展的半监督学习，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Neural networks have demonstrated exceptional performance in supervised
learning, benefiting from abundant high-quality annotated data. However,
obtaining such data in real-world scenarios is costly and labor-intensive.
Semi-supervised learning (SSL) offers a solution to this problem. Recent
studies, such as Semi-ViT and Noisy Student, which employ consistency
regularization or pseudo-labeling, have demonstrated significant achievements.
However, they still face challenges, particularly in accurately selecting
sufficient high-quality pseudo-labels due to their reliance on fixed
thresholds. Recent methods such as FlexMatch and FreeMatch have introduced
flexible or self-adaptive thresholding techniques, greatly advancing SSL
research. Nonetheless, their process of updating thresholds at each iteration
is deemed time-consuming, computationally intensive, and potentially
unnecessary. To address these issues, we propose Self-training with
Self-adaptive Thresholding (SST), a novel, effective, and efficient SSL
framework. SST introduces an innovative Self-Adaptive Thresholding (SAT)
mechanism that adaptively adjusts class-specific thresholds based on the
model's learning progress. SAT ensures the selection of high-quality
pseudo-labeled data, mitigating the risks of inaccurate pseudo-labels and
confirmation bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SST achieves
state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency, generalization, and
scalability across various architectures and datasets. Semi-SST-ViT-Huge
achieves the best results on competitive ImageNet-1K SSL benchmarks, with 80.7%
/ 84.9% Top-1 accuracy using only 1% / 10% labeled data. Compared to the
fully-supervised DeiT-III-ViT-Huge, which achieves 84.8% Top-1 accuracy using
100% labeled data, our method demonstrates superior performance using only 10%
labeled data.

### [467] [Flashbacks to Harmonize Stability and Plasticity in Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00477)
*Leila Mahmoodi,Peyman Moghadam,Munawar Hayat,Christian Simon,Mehrtash Harandi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Flashback Learning (FL) 是一种新颖的持续学习方法，通过双向正则化平衡模型的稳定性和可塑性，显著提升分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续学习中模型在保留旧知识的同时快速学习新知识的平衡问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练过程，结合两种知识库（增强可塑性和稳定性）进行双向正则化。

Result: 在标准图像分类基准上，FL 平均提升分类准确率 4.91%（类增量）和 3.51%（任务增量），并在 ImageNet 上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FL 通过双向正则化有效平衡稳定性和可塑性，显著提升持续学习性能。

Abstract: We introduce Flashback Learning (FL), a novel method designed to harmonize
the stability and plasticity of models in Continual Learning (CL). Unlike prior
approaches that primarily focus on regularizing model updates to preserve old
information while learning new concepts, FL explicitly balances this trade-off
through a bidirectional form of regularization. This approach effectively
guides the model to swiftly incorporate new knowledge while actively retaining
its old knowledge. FL operates through a two-phase training process and can be
seamlessly integrated into various CL methods, including replay, parameter
regularization, distillation, and dynamic architecture techniques. In designing
FL, we use two distinct knowledge bases: one to enhance plasticity and another
to improve stability. FL ensures a more balanced model by utilizing both
knowledge bases to regularize model updates. Theoretically, we analyze how the
FL mechanism enhances the stability-plasticity balance. Empirically, FL
demonstrates tangible improvements over baseline methods within the same
training budget. By integrating FL into at least one representative baseline
from each CL category, we observed an average accuracy improvement of up to
4.91% in Class-Incremental and 3.51% in Task-Incremental settings on standard
image classification benchmarks. Additionally, measurements of the
stability-to-plasticity ratio confirm that FL effectively enhances this
balance. FL also outperforms state-of-the-art CL methods on more challenging
datasets like ImageNet.

### [468] [Dynamic Domain Adaptation-Driven Physics-Informed Graph Representation Learning for AC-OPF](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00478)
*Hongjie Zhu,Zezheng Zhang,Zeyu Zhang,Yu Bai,Shimin Wen,Huazhang Wang,Daji Ergu,Ying Cai,Yang Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DDA-PIGCN是一种结合时空特征的图卷积网络方法，用于解决AC-OPF中约束建模的局限性，并在多个标准测试案例中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AC-OPF求解器在约束空间和最优解之间的复杂关系建模上存在不足，且缺乏时空信息的整合。

Method: 提出DDA-PIGCN方法，通过多层硬物理约束和动态域适应学习机制，结合电网物理结构捕捉时空依赖性。

Result: 在IEEE标准测试案例中，MAE为0.0011至0.0624，约束满足率达99.6%至100%。

Conclusion: DDA-PIGCN是一种可靠且高效的AC-OPF求解器，能够有效整合时空信息并优化约束建模。

Abstract: Alternating Current Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) aims to optimize generator
power outputs by utilizing the non-linear relationships between voltage
magnitudes and phase angles in a power system. However, current AC-OPF solvers
struggle to effectively represent the complex relationship between variable
distributions in the constraint space and their corresponding optimal
solutions. This limitation in constraint modeling restricts the system's
ability to develop diverse knowledge representations. Additionally, modeling
the power grid solely based on spatial topology further limits the integration
of additional prior knowledge, such as temporal information. To overcome these
challenges, we propose DDA-PIGCN (Dynamic Domain Adaptation-Driven
Physics-Informed Graph Convolutional Network), a new method designed to address
constraint-related issues and build a graph-based learning framework that
incorporates spatiotemporal features. DDA-PIGCN improves consistency
optimization for features with varying long-range dependencies by applying
multi-layer, hard physics-informed constraints. It also uses a dynamic domain
adaptation learning mechanism that iteratively updates and refines key state
variables under predefined constraints, enabling precise constraint
verification. Moreover, it captures spatiotemporal dependencies between
generators and loads by leveraging the physical structure of the power grid,
allowing for deep integration of topological information across time and space.
Extensive comparative and ablation studies show that DDA-PIGCN delivers strong
performance across several IEEE standard test cases (such as case9, case30, and
case300), achieving mean absolute errors (MAE) from 0.0011 to 0.0624 and
constraint satisfaction rates between 99.6% and 100%, establishing it as a
reliable and efficient AC-OPF solver.

### [469] [MMedAgent-RL: Optimizing Multi-Agent Collaboration for Multimodal Medical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00555)
*Peng Xia,Jinglu Wang,Yibo Peng,Kaide Zeng,Xian Wu,Xiangru Tang,Hongtu Zhu,Yun Li,Shujie Liu,Yan Lu,Huaxiu Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MMedAgent-RL是一种基于强化学习的多智能体框架，通过动态协作提升医疗多模态诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单智能体模型在跨医学专业泛化能力不足，静态多智能体框架缺乏灵活性。

Method: 使用强化学习训练两个GP智能体，结合课程学习策略优化协作。

Result: 在五个医疗VQA基准测试中表现优于现有模型，平均性能提升18.4%。

Conclusion: MMedAgent-RL展示了动态协作的潜力，并模拟了人类推理模式。

Abstract: Medical Large Vision-Language Models (Med-LVLMs) have shown strong potential
in multimodal diagnostic tasks. However, existing single-agent models struggle
to generalize across diverse medical specialties, limiting their performance.
Recent efforts introduce multi-agent collaboration frameworks inspired by
clinical workflows, where general practitioners (GPs) and specialists interact
in a fixed sequence. Despite improvements, these static pipelines lack
flexibility and adaptability in reasoning. To address this, we propose
MMedAgent-RL, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-agent framework that
enables dynamic, optimized collaboration among medical agents. Specifically, we
train two GP agents based on Qwen2.5-VL via RL: the triage doctor learns to
assign patients to appropriate specialties, while the attending physician
integrates the judgments from multi-specialists and its own knowledge to make
final decisions. To address the inconsistency in specialist outputs, we
introduce a curriculum learning (CL)-guided RL strategy that progressively
teaches the attending physician to balance between imitating specialists and
correcting their mistakes. Experiments on five medical VQA benchmarks
demonstrate that MMedAgent-RL not only outperforms both open-source and
proprietary Med-LVLMs, but also exhibits human-like reasoning patterns.
Notably, it achieves an average performance gain of 18.4% over supervised
fine-tuning baselines.

### [470] [QoQ-Med: Building Multimodal Clinical Foundation Models with Domain-Aware GRPO Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00711)
*Wei Dai,Peilin Chen,Chanakya Ekbote,Paul Pu Liang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QoQ-Med-7B/32B是首个开放通用的临床基础模型，能够联合处理医学图像、时间序列信号和文本报告，通过DRPO训练方法显著提升诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态语言模型（MLLMs）主要关注视觉数据，难以泛化到不同临床领域，因此需要一种能跨模态推理的通用模型。

Method: 采用Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization（DRPO）训练方法，通过分层缩放奖励解决数据分布不均问题。

Result: DRPO训练使诊断性能平均提升43%（宏F1），并在分割任务中显著优于其他开放模型。

Conclusion: QoQ-Med在跨模态临床推理中表现优异，同时开源模型权重和训练工具以促进研究。

Abstract: Clinical decision-making routinely demands reasoning over heterogeneous data,
yet existing multimodal language models (MLLMs) remain largely vision-centric
and fail to generalize across clinical specialties. To bridge this gap, we
introduce QoQ-Med-7B/32B, the first open generalist clinical foundation model
that jointly reasons across medical images, time-series signals, and text
reports. QoQ-Med is trained with Domain-aware Relative Policy Optimization
(DRPO), a novel reinforcement-learning objective that hierarchically scales
normalized rewards according to domain rarity and modality difficulty,
mitigating performance imbalance caused by skewed clinical data distributions.
Trained on 2.61 million instruction tuning pairs spanning 9 clinical domains,
we show that DRPO training boosts diagnostic performance by 43% in macro-F1 on
average across all visual domains as compared to other critic-free training
methods like GRPO. Furthermore, with QoQ-Med trained on intensive segmentation
data, it is able to highlight salient regions related to the diagnosis, with an
IoU 10x higher than open models while reaching the performance of OpenAI
o4-mini. To foster reproducibility and downstream research, we release (i) the
full model weights, (ii) the modular training pipeline, and (iii) all
intermediate reasoning traces at https://github.com/DDVD233/QoQ_Med.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于灵活坐标系的深度强化学习方法，用于医学图像平面重格式化，解决了现有方法对测试数据位置和方向的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法在平面重格式化任务中表现良好，但要求测试数据与训练数据的位置和方向一致，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 采用异步优势演员评论家（A3C）算法，结合灵活坐标系，使模型能在任意位置和方向的体积数据中导航。

Result: 在4D流MRI中，该方法在角度和距离误差上表现更优（6.32±4.15°和3.40±2.75 mm），且与专家操作的流测量结果统计等效（p=0.21）。

Conclusion: 该方法具有灵活性和适应性，适用于4D流MRI以外的其他医学成像应用。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have shown robust results in
plane reformatting tasks. In these methods, an agent sequentially adjusts the
position and orientation of an initial plane towards an objective location.
This process allows accurate plane reformatting, without the need for detailed
landmarks, which makes it suitable for images with limited contrast and
resolution, such as 4D flow MRI. However, current DRL methods require the test
dataset to be in the same position and orientation as the training dataset. In
this paper, we present a novel technique that utilizes a flexible coordinate
system based on the current state, enabling navigation in volumes at any
position or orientation. We adopted the Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic
(A3C) algorithm for reinforcement learning, outperforming Deep Q Network (DQN).
Experimental results in 4D flow MRI demonstrate improved accuracy in plane
reformatting angular and distance errors (6.32 +- 4.15 {\deg} and 3.40 +- 2.75
mm), as well as statistically equivalent flow measurements determined by a
plane reformatting process done by an expert (p=0.21). The method's flexibility
and adaptability make it a promising candidate for other medical imaging
applications beyond 4D flow MRI.

*Chengyi Cai,Zesheng Ye,Lei Feng,Jianzhong Qi,Feng Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦和重加权框架（DVP），通过分组优化视觉提示（DVP-cse/DVP-cls）并引入概率重加权矩阵（PRM）提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉重编程方法（VR）使用单一视觉提示可能无法捕捉多样描述特征或偏向非信息属性，影响分类效果。

Method: 采用解耦视觉提示（DVP），按显式原因或聚类分组优化，并通过PRM整合各提示贡献。

Result: 在11个下游数据集上优于基线，DVP-PRM组合提供了分类决策的可解释性。

Conclusion: DVP框架通过解耦和重加权提升了视觉重编程的效果，并提供了分类决策的透明性。

Abstract: Model reprogramming adapts pretrained models to downstream tasks by modifying
only the input and output spaces. Visual reprogramming (VR) is one instance for
vision tasks that adds a trainable noise pattern (i.e., a visual prompt) to
input images to facilitate downstream classification. The existing VR
approaches for CLIP train a single visual prompt using all descriptions of
different downstream classes. However, the limited learning capacity may result
in (1) a failure to capture diverse aspects of the descriptions (e.g., shape,
color, and texture), and (2) a possible bias toward less informative attributes
that do not help distinguish between classes. In this paper, we introduce a
decoupling-and-reweighting framework. Our decoupled visual prompts (DVP) are
optimized using descriptions grouped by explicit causes (DVP-cse) or
unsupervised clusters (DVP-cls). Then, we integrate the outputs of these visual
prompts with a probabilistic reweighting matrix (PRM) that measures their
contributions to each downstream class. Theoretically, DVP lowers the empirical
risk bound. Experimentally, DVP outperforms baselines on average across 11
downstream datasets. Notably, the DVP-PRM integration enables insights into how
individual visual prompts influence classification decisions, providing a
probabilistic framework for understanding reprogramming. Our code is available
at https://github.com/tmlr-group/DecoupledVP.

*Taehoon Yoon,Yunhong Min,Kyeongmin Yeo,Minhyuk Sung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: We introduce $\Psi$-Sampler, an SMC-based framework incorporating pCNL-based
initial particle sampling for effective inference-time reward alignment with a
score-based generative model. Inference-time reward alignment with score-based
generative models has recently gained significant traction, following a broader
paradigm shift from pre-training to post-training optimization. At the core of
this trend is the application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to the denoising
process. However, existing methods typically initialize particles from the
Gaussian prior, which inadequately captures reward-relevant regions and results
in reduced sampling efficiency. We demonstrate that initializing from the
reward-aware posterior significantly improves alignment performance. To enable
posterior sampling in high-dimensional latent spaces, we introduce the
preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin (pCNL) algorithm, which combines
dimension-robust proposals with gradient-informed dynamics. This approach
enables efficient and scalable posterior sampling and consistently improves
performance across various reward alignment tasks, including layout-to-image
generation, quantity-aware generation, and aesthetic-preference generation, as
demonstrated in our experiments.

*Sujeevan Aseervatham,Achraf Kerzazi,Younès Bennani*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的防御方法，用于检测和消除AI模型中的后门攻击，无需依赖干净数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 后门攻击因其隐蔽性对AI模型构成威胁，现有防御方法依赖干净数据集，实际场景中难以满足。

Method: 训练模型检测中毒类别，提取攻击触发器的关键部分，识别中毒实例。

Result: 实验证明该方法在知名图像数据集上有效，优于SCAn、ABL和AGPD三种先进算法。

Conclusion: 新方法提高了可解释性，无需干净数据集即可防御后门攻击。

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a subtle yet effective class of cyberattacks
targeting AI models, primarily due to their stealthy nature. The model behaves
normally on clean data but exhibits malicious behavior only when the attacker
embeds a specific trigger into the input. This attack is performed during the
training phase, where the adversary corrupts a small subset of the training
data by embedding a pattern and modifying the labels to a chosen target. The
objective is to make the model associate the pattern with the target label
while maintaining normal performance on unaltered data. Several defense
mechanisms have been proposed to sanitize training data-sets. However, these
methods often rely on the availability of a clean dataset to compute
statistical anomalies, which may not always be feasible in real-world scenarios
where datasets can be unavailable or compromised. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel defense method that trains a model on the given dataset,
detects poisoned classes, and extracts the critical part of the attack trigger
before identifying the poisoned instances. This approach enhances
explainability by explicitly revealing the harmful part of the trigger. The
effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experimental evaluations on
well-known image datasets and comparative analysis against three
state-of-the-art algorithms: SCAn, ABL, and AGPD.

TL;DR: 本文提出DataRubrics框架，通过系统化的评估指标和LLM技术，提升数据集质量评估的标准化和可操作性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据集论文缺乏原创性、多样性和严格的质量控制，且现有工具如datasheets未能提供可衡量的评估方法。

Method: 提出DataRubrics框架，结合系统化的评估指标和LLM技术，支持数据集质量评估。

Result: DataRubrics为数据集质量评估提供了可重复、可扩展的解决方案，并开源代码支持复现。

Conclusion: 呼吁在数据集评审中采用系统化评估指标，以提升数据为中心研究的质量。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are fundamental to training and evaluating machine
learning models, yet their creation-especially with accurate human
annotations-remains a significant challenge. Many dataset paper submissions
lack originality, diversity, or rigorous quality control, and these
shortcomings are often overlooked during peer review. Submissions also
frequently omit essential details about dataset construction and properties.
While existing tools such as datasheets aim to promote transparency, they are
largely descriptive and do not provide standardized, measurable methods for
evaluating data quality. Similarly, metadata requirements at conferences
promote accountability but are inconsistently enforced. To address these
limitations, this position paper advocates for the integration of systematic,
rubric-based evaluation metrics into the dataset review process-particularly as
submission volumes continue to grow. We also explore scalable, cost-effective
methods for synthetic data generation, including dedicated tools and
LLM-as-a-judge approaches, to support more efficient evaluation. As a call to
action, we introduce DataRubrics, a structured framework for assessing the
quality of both human- and model-generated datasets. Leveraging recent advances
in LLM-based evaluation, DataRubrics offers a reproducible, scalable, and
actionable solution for dataset quality assessment, enabling both authors and
reviewers to uphold higher standards in data-centric research. We also release
code to support reproducibility of LLM-based evaluations at

*Kundan Krishna,Joseph Y Cheng,Charles Maalouf,Leon A Gatys*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DSA框架通过解耦安全计算与任务优化模型，提升AI安全性的同时保持高效性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全方法（如护栏模型和对齐训练）常牺牲推理效率或开发灵活性，DSA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DSA使用轻量级适配器，利用基础模型的内部表示，实现多样化的安全功能，对推理成本影响极小。

Result: DSA在幻觉检测（AUC 0.88）、仇恨言论分类（0.98）和输入/响应安全性（0.93）上显著优于独立模型，并支持动态调整对齐强度。

Conclusion: DSA为AI安全和对齐提供了模块化、高效且灵活的解决方案，显著降低了对齐税。

Abstract: Existing paradigms for ensuring AI safety, such as guardrail models and
alignment training, often compromise either inference efficiency or development
flexibility. We introduce Disentangled Safety Adapters (DSA), a novel framework
addressing these challenges by decoupling safety-specific computations from a
task-optimized base model. DSA utilizes lightweight adapters that leverage the
base model's internal representations, enabling diverse and flexible safety
functionalities with minimal impact on inference cost. Empirically, DSA-based
safety guardrails substantially outperform comparably sized standalone models,
notably improving hallucination detection (0.88 vs. 0.61 AUC on Summedits) and
also excelling at classifying hate speech (0.98 vs. 0.92 on ToxiGen) and unsafe
model inputs and responses (0.93 vs. 0.90 on AEGIS2.0 & BeaverTails).
Furthermore, DSA-based safety alignment allows dynamic, inference-time
adjustment of alignment strength and a fine-grained trade-off between
instruction following performance and model safety. Importantly, combining the
DSA safety guardrail with DSA safety alignment facilitates context-dependent
alignment strength, boosting safety on StrongReject by 93% while maintaining
98% performance on MTBench -- a total reduction in alignment tax of 8
percentage points compared to standard safety alignment fine-tuning. Overall,
DSA presents a promising path towards more modular, efficient, and adaptable AI
safety and alignment.

*Babak Barazandeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Localized LoRA提出了一种参数高效微调方法，通过局部低秩矩阵更新权重，提升表达能力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法（如LoRA）依赖全局低秩结构，可能忽略参数空间中的空间模式。

Method: 提出Localized LoRA框架，将权重更新建模为低秩矩阵对权重矩阵结构化块的组合，实现密集局部更新。

Result: 在相同参数预算下，Localized LoRA的近似误差更低，实验显示其表达能力和适应性更强。

Conclusion: Localized LoRA是一种更高效、性能更好的微调方法。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA, offer compact
and effective alternatives to full model fine-tuning by introducing low-rank
updates to pretrained weights. However, most existing approaches rely on global
low-rank structures, which can overlook spatial patterns spread across the
parameter space. In this work, we propose Localized LoRA, a generalized
framework that models weight updates as a composition of low-rank matrices
applied to structured blocks of the weight matrix. This formulation enables
dense, localized updates throughout the parameter space-without increasing the
total number of trainable parameters. We provide a formal comparison between
global, diagonal-local, and fully localized low-rank approximations, and show
that our method consistently achieves lower approximation error under matched
parameter budgets. Experiments on both synthetic and practical settings
demonstrate that Localized LoRA offers a more expressive and adaptable
alternative to existing methods, enabling efficient fine-tuning with improved
performance.

Abstract: Hallucination in large language models (LLMs) can be detected by assessing
the uncertainty of model outputs, typically measured using entropy. Semantic
entropy (SE) enhances traditional entropy estimation by quantifying uncertainty
at the semantic cluster level. However, as modern LLMs generate longer
one-sentence responses, SE becomes less effective because it overlooks two
crucial factors: intra-cluster similarity (the spread within a cluster) and
inter-cluster similarity (the distance between clusters). To address these
limitations, we propose a simple black-box uncertainty quantification method
inspired by nearest neighbor estimates of entropy. Our approach can also be
easily extended to white-box settings by incorporating token probabilities.
Additionally, we provide theoretical results showing that our method
generalizes semantic entropy. Extensive empirical results demonstrate its
effectiveness compared to semantic entropy across two recent LLMs (Phi3 and
Llama3) and three common text generation tasks: question answering, text
summarization, and machine translation. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种数据无关的方法，通过CKA分析预训练LLM中的关键层，发现这些层在微调中表现显著变化，并应用于领域适应和防御后门攻击。


<details>

Motivation: 理解LLM中特征表示的演变对提高其可解释性和鲁棒性至关重要，但现有方法依赖数据且局限于事后分析。

Method: 使用Centered Kernel Alignment（CKA）分析预训练LLM的表示动态，识别关键层，并通过谱分析揭示其驱动因素。

Result: 关键层在微调中变化显著，且其变化由语义过渡（从理据到结论）驱动。应用这些发现可提升领域适应效率并降低后门攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 数据无关方法能有效识别LLM中的关键层，为模型优化和安全防御提供新思路。

Abstract: Understanding how feature representations evolve across layers in large
language models (LLMs) is key to improving their interpretability and
robustness. While recent studies have identified critical layers linked to
specific functions or behaviors, these efforts typically rely on data-dependent
analyses of fine-tuned models, limiting their use to post-hoc settings. In
contrast, we introduce a data-oblivious approach to identify intrinsic critical
layers in pre-fine-tuned LLMs by analyzing representation dynamics via Centered
Kernel Alignment(CKA). We show that layers with significant shifts in
representation space are also those most affected during fine-tuning--a pattern
that holds consistently across tasks for a given model. Our spectral analysis
further reveals that these shifts are driven by changes in the top principal
components, which encode semantic transitions from rationales to conclusions.
We further apply these findings to two practical scenarios: efficient domain
adaptation, where fine-tuning critical layers leads to greater loss reduction
compared to non-critical layers; and backdoor defense, where freezing them
reduces attack success rates by up to 40%.

Motivation: 随着LLM的发展，现有数据集分散且难以管理，无法满足特定领域或需求的高效评估需求。

Result: 实验表明，LLM在不同领域子集上的性能差异显著，凸显领域感知基准测试的重要性。

Conclusion: BenchHub能促进数据集重用、透明模型比较，并识别现有基准中的不足，为LLM评估研究提供关键基础设施。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance, the need for up-to-date
and well-organized benchmarks becomes increasingly critical. However, many
existing datasets are scattered, difficult to manage, and make it challenging
to perform evaluations tailored to specific needs or domains, despite the
growing importance of domain-specific models in areas such as math or code. In
this paper, we introduce BenchHub, a dynamic benchmark repository that empowers
researchers and developers to evaluate LLMs more effectively. BenchHub
aggregates and automatically classifies benchmark datasets from diverse
domains, integrating 303K questions across 38 benchmarks. It is designed to
support continuous updates and scalable data management, enabling flexible and
customizable evaluation tailored to various domains or use cases. Through
extensive experiments with various LLM families, we demonstrate that model
performance varies significantly across domain-specific subsets, emphasizing
the importance of domain-aware benchmarking. We believe BenchHub can encourage
better dataset reuse, more transparent model comparisons, and easier
identification of underrepresented areas in existing benchmarks, offering a
critical infrastructure for advancing LLM evaluation research.

TL;DR: FLoE是一种新型的PEFT框架，通过动态识别关键层和自动分配LoRA秩，显著提高了参数效率和适应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法在所有层中均匀部署LoRA适配器，忽略了层贡献的异质性和任务特定的秩需求，导致参数冗余和效率低下。

Method: FLoE引入Fisher信息引导的重要性评分机制和贝叶斯优化驱动的秩分配器，实现稀疏适配器部署和自动秩优化。

Result: 实验表明，FLoE在多种LLM和基准测试中实现了高效的准确性与效率平衡。

Conclusion: FLoE在资源受限环境中具有显著优势，特别适合需要快速适应的场景。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a widely
adopted strategy for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to
downstream tasks, significantly reducing memory and computational costs.
However, most existing PEFT techniques uniformly deploy LoRA adapters across
all layers, disregarding the intrinsic heterogeneity of layer contributions and
task-specific rank requirements. This uniform paradigm leads to redundant
parameter allocation and suboptimal adaptation efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose FLoE, a novel PEFT framework that introduces two key
innovations: (i) a Fisher information-guided importance scoring mechanism to
dynamically identify task-critical transformer layers for MoE-based low-rank
adaptation, enabling sparse adapter deployment; and (ii) a Bayesian
optimization-driven rank allocator that automatically determines optimal LoRA
ranks on specific datasets without exhaustive grid search. Extensive
experiments across diverse LLMs and benchmarks reveal that FLoE achieves
impressive efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, making FLoE particularly
advantageous in resource-constrained environments that necessitate rapid
adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络在相似数据和架构下学习的表示是否共享，以及这些表示是否可以跨模型迁移。

Method: 提出LRT假设，学习不同大小模型隐藏状态间的仿射映射，评估行为方向（steering vectors）的语义效果是否保留。

Result: 实验证明仿射映射能保留行为方向的效果，小模型的表示可指导大模型行为。

Conclusion: LRT假设为理解跨模型尺度的表示对齐提供了新方向，小模型的表示对大模型具有指导意义。

Abstract: It has been hypothesized that neural networks with similar architectures
trained on similar data learn shared representations relevant to the learning
task. We build on this idea by extending the conceptual framework where
representations learned across models trained on the same data can be expressed
as linear combinations of a \emph{universal} set of basis features. These basis
features underlie the learning task itself and remain consistent across models,
regardless of scale. From this framework, we propose the \textbf{Linear
Representation Transferability (LRT)} Hypothesis -- that there exists an affine
transformation between the representation spaces of different models. To test
this hypothesis, we learn affine mappings between the hidden states of models
of different sizes and evaluate whether steering vectors -- directions in
hidden state space associated with specific model behaviors -- retain their
semantic effect when transferred from small to large language models using the
learned mappings. We find strong empirical evidence that such affine mappings
can preserve steering behaviors. These findings suggest that representations
learned by small models can be used to guide the behavior of large models, and
that the LRT hypothesis may be a promising direction on understanding
representation alignment across model scales.

Conclusion: 当前评估方法可能高估或低估遗忘效果，需采用新原则改进评估实践。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove sensitive or undesired data from large
language models. However, recent studies suggest that unlearning is often
shallow, claiming that removed knowledge can easily be recovered. In this work,
we critically examine standard unlearning evaluation practices and uncover key
limitations that shake our trust in those findings. First, we show that some
evaluations introduce substantial new information into the model, potentially
masking true unlearning performance by re-teaching the model during testing.
Second, we demonstrate that evaluation outcomes vary significantly across
tasks, undermining the generalizability of current evaluation routines.
Finally, we find that many evaluations rely on spurious correlations, making
their results difficult to trust and interpret. Taken together, these issues
suggest that current evaluation protocols may both overstate and understate
unlearning success. To address this, we propose two principles for future
unlearning evaluations: minimal information injection and downstream task
awareness. We validate these principles through a series of targeted
experiments, showing how violations of each can lead to misleading conclusions.

Conclusion: BCRF是一种高效且灵活的序列标注模型，适用于需要快速并行推断的场景。

Abstract: We propose a novel discriminative model for sequence labeling called Bregman
conditional random fields (BCRF). Contrary to standard linear-chain conditional
random fields, BCRF allows fast parallelizable inference algorithms based on
iterative Bregman projections. We show how such models can be learned using
Fenchel-Young losses, including extension for learning from partial labels.
Experimentally, our approach delivers comparable results to CRF while being
faster, and achieves better results in highly constrained settings compared to

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种低秩信息稀疏微调方法（LIFT），通过仅更新关键权重（Principal Weights），在保持高效的同时优于全参数微调（Full FT）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全参数微调（Full FT）计算成本高且易过拟合，稀疏微调在LLM时代效果不佳。研究旨在找到一种高效且有效的微调方法。

Method: 提出LIFT方法，通过低秩近似识别关键权重（Principal Weights），仅更新前5%的关键权重。

Result: LIFT在推理任务中表现优于Full FT，同时保持内存效率，并在源领域知识保留上表现更优。

Conclusion: LIFT是一种高效且有效的微调方法，适用于LLM，尤其在数据有限时表现突出。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that supervised fine-tuning of LLMs on a small
number of high-quality datasets can yield strong reasoning capabilities.
However, full fine-tuning (Full FT), while powerful, is computationally
expensive and susceptible to overfitting and catastrophic forgetting,
particularly when data is limited. Sparse fine-tuning, which previously
achieved notable success by updating only a small subset of model parameters,
offers a promising trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. Yet, it has
lagged behind in the LLM era due to the difficulty of identifying parameters
truly critical for reasoning. In this work, we state that weights with the
largest magnitude after low-rank approximation are critical weights for
fine-tuning, which we call Principal Weights. Surprisingly, while
magnitude-based sparse fine-tuning performs poorly as a baseline on LLM
fine-tuning, it becomes highly effective after rank reduction. These insights
motivate our method: Low-rank Informed Sparse Fine-Tuning (LIFT). LIFT only
updates the top 5% Principal Weights throughout training and consistently
achieves better performance on reasoning tasks than Full FT, while maintaining
memory efficiency on par with popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.
In addition to strong performance on target domains such as arithmetic
reasoning, LIFT also retains up to 20% more source-domain knowledge, compared
to Full FT and LoRA. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 现有方法通过监督微调提升LLMs在图算法任务上的表现，但缺乏对真实世界隐含图结构的泛化能力，因此探索RL的潜力。

Method: 设计基于解和过程的奖励机制，使用GRPO和DPO等RL算法，对比微调前后的LLMs在合成任务和真实任务上的表现。

Result: 实验表明RL方法在5个数据集上平均提升12.9%，基于过程的奖励优于基于解的奖励，但组合性和可解释性仍是挑战。

Conclusion: RL能有效提升LLMs在图数据上的泛化能力，但需进一步解决组合性和中间步骤的可解释性问题。

Abstract: Previous research has sought to enhance the graph reasoning capabilities of
LLMs by supervised fine-tuning on synthetic graph data. While these led to
specialized LLMs better at solving graph algorithm problems, we don't need LLMs
for shortest path: we need generalization from synthetic graph data to
real-world tasks with implicit graph structures. In this work, we propose to
unlock generalizable learning of graph synthetic data with reinforcement
learning. We first design solution-based and process-based rewards for
synthetic graph problems: instead of rigid memorizing response patterns in
direct fine-tuning, we posit that RL would help LLMs grasp the essentials
underlying graph reasoning and alleviate overfitting. We employ RL algorithms
such as GRPO and DPO, aligning both off-the-shelf LLMs and LLMs fine-tuned on
synthetic graph data. We then compare them against existing settings on both
in-domain synthetic tasks and out-of-domain real-world tasks with implicit
graph structures such as multi-hop QA, structured planning, and more. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our RL recipe leads to statistically significant
improvement on 5 datasets, with an average gain of 12.9\% over baseline
settings. Further analysis reveals that process-based rewards consistently
outperform solution-based rewards, mixing synthetic and real-world task data
yields potential gains, while compositionality and explainable intermediate
steps remains a critical challenge even after RL.

Motivation: 解决深度序列模型在测试序列长度显著超过训练长度时准确性下降的问题，特别是在算法推理、多步算术和组合泛化等关键任务中。

Method: PRISM通过可微分直方图滤波学习连续相对位置，使用概率叠加而非确定性嵌入来保持位置不确定性。

Result: PRISM在算法基准测试中实现了最先进的长度推断能力，包括算术、SCAN组合任务和复杂复制任务。

Conclusion: PRISM的随机位置编码保持了清晰可解释的内部状态，为可靠的长度泛化提供了理论基础，推动了神经网络序列模型在远超训练长度时的算法鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deep sequence models typically degrade in accuracy when test sequences
significantly exceed their training lengths, yet many critical tasks--such as
algorithmic reasoning, multi-step arithmetic, and compositional
generalization--require robust length extrapolation. We introduce PRISM, a
Probabilistic Relative-position Implicit Superposition Model, a novel
positional encoding mechanism that enables Transformers to extrapolate
accurately up to 10x beyond their training length. PRISM learns continuous
relative positions through a differentiable histogram-filter update, preserving
position uncertainty via a probabilistic superposition rather than conventional
deterministic embeddings. Empirically, PRISM achieves state-of-the-art length
extrapolation, successfully generalizing to previously intractable sequence
lengths across algorithmic benchmarks--including arithmetic (addition,
multiplication), SCAN compositionality tasks, and complex copy variants derived
from DeepMind's recent datasets. Our analysis demonstrates that PRISM's
stochastic positional encoding maintains sharp and interpretable internal
states, providing a theoretical basis for reliable length generalization. These
results advance the goal of neural sequence models that remain algorithmically
robust at lengths far exceeding their training horizon.

Motivation: 探讨Transformer架构中自注意力机制对性能提升的具体贡献，以及不同组件在任务中的作用。

Method: 通过冻结MLP层或注意力投影器，并引入随机固定注意力的MixiT模型，对比分析不同变体的性能。

Result: MixiT在算术和记忆任务中表现与完整Transformer相当，但在检索任务中表现较差；冻结查询和键投影器的注意力仍能形成关键电路并保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 架构的异质性对不同任务至关重要，不同组件提供互补的归纳偏置。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture is central to the success of modern Large
Language Models (LLMs), in part due to its surprising ability to perform a wide
range of algorithmic tasks -- including mathematical reasoning, memorization,
and retrieval -- using only gradient-based training on next-token prediction.
While the core component of a Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, we
question how much, and which aspects, of the performance gains can be
attributed to it. To this end, we compare standard Transformers to variants in
which either the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers or the attention
projectors (queries and keys) are frozen at initialization. To further isolate
the contribution of attention, we introduce MixiT -- the Mixing Transformer --
a simplified, principled model in which the attention coefficients are entirely
random and fixed at initialization, eliminating any input-dependent computation
or learning in attention. Surprisingly, we find that MixiT matches the
performance of fully trained Transformers on various algorithmic tasks,
especially those involving basic arithmetic or focusing heavily on
memorization. For retrieval-based tasks, we observe that having input-dependent
attention coefficients is consistently beneficial, while MixiT underperforms.
We attribute this failure to its inability to form specialized circuits such as
induction heads -- a specific circuit known to be crucial for learning and
exploiting repeating patterns in input sequences. Even more interestingly, we
find that attention with frozen key and query projectors is not only able to
form induction heads, but can also perform competitively on language modeling.
Our results underscore the importance of architectural heterogeneity, where
distinct components contribute complementary inductive biases crucial for
solving different classes of tasks.

Conclusion: ZapFormat和Formatron显著提升了约束解码的效率与性能，开源项目Formatron为结构化生成任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities, yet ensuring
their outputs conform to strict structural or grammatical constraints remains
challenging, which is critical in function calls and domain-specific language
(DSL) generation. Constrained decoding with context-free grammar is a flexible
approach to guarantee LLMs' adherence to a specific format by dynamically
building a token logits mask. However, creating this mask requires checking the
validity of all tokens in the LLM vocabulary at every decoding step, which
often incurs significant overheads in existing constrained decoding engines. To
address this challenge, we propose $\textbf{ZapFormat}$, a novel
$\textbf{dynamic pruning}$ strategy based on the Earley algorithm that
identifies and eliminates invalid or redundant Earley states in real-time,
significantly reducing memory occupation of the Earley algorithm's states. This
further enables us to use a state cache to speed up structured generations on a
large number of queries. We implemented ZapFormat in a new constrained decoding
engine called Formatron which also incorporates existing optimizations. Through
comprehensive experiments on structured generation tasks, including JSON
generation, JSON Schema validation, and semantic parsing, we demonstrate that
Formatron not only $\textbf{consistently maintains}$ high-precision compliant
outputs but also achieves $\textbf{significant improvements}$ in inference
speed up to 2x compared to state-of-the-art implementations. More importantly,
Formatron is generally applicable across various LLM architectures. We release
Formatron as open source at https://github.com/Dan-wanna-M/formatron.

Conclusion: 研究为压缩格式的选择和训练算法优化提供了理论支持，证明了统一扩展框架的可行性。

Abstract: Scaling laws have shaped recent advances in machine learning by enabling
predictable scaling of model performance based on model size, computation, and
data volume. Concurrently, the rise in computational cost for AI has motivated
model compression techniques, notably quantization and sparsification, which
have emerged to mitigate the steep computational demands associated with
large-scale training and inference. This paper investigates the interplay
between scaling laws and compression formats, exploring whether a unified
scaling framework can accurately predict model performance when training occurs
over various compressed representations, such as sparse, scalar-quantized,
sparse-quantized or even vector-quantized formats. Our key contributions
include validating a general scaling law formulation and showing that it is
applicable both individually but also composably across compression types.
Based on this, our main finding is demonstrating both theoretically and
empirically that there exists a simple "capacity" metric -- based on the
representation's ability to fit random Gaussian data -- which can robustly
predict parameter efficiency across multiple compressed representations. On the
practical side, we extend our formulation to directly compare the accuracy
potential of different compressed formats, and to derive better algorithms for
training over sparse-quantized formats.

Conclusion: 预训练的视觉模型在天文光谱数据分析中具有高效性和可扩展性，为首次在大规模真实光谱数据中应用ViT。

Abstract: We apply pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs), originally developed for
image recognition, to the analysis of astronomical spectral data. By converting
traditional one-dimensional spectra into two-dimensional image representations,
we enable ViTs to capture both local and global spectral features through
spatial self-attention. We fine-tune a ViT pretrained on ImageNet using
millions of spectra from the SDSS and LAMOST surveys, represented as spectral
plots. Our model is evaluated on key tasks including stellar object
classification and redshift ($z$) estimation, where it demonstrates strong
performance and scalability. We achieve classification accuracy higher than
Support Vector Machines and Random Forests, and attain $R^2$ values comparable
to AstroCLIP's spectrum encoder, even when generalizing across diverse object
types. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using pretrained vision
models for spectroscopic data analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first
application of ViTs to large-scale, which also leverages real spectroscopic
data and does not rely on synthetic inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对人中心对象、场景和上下文操纵的大规模深度伪造基准数据集，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型（VLM）生成语义和上下文感知的操纵图像，构建包含845,286张图像的数据集。

Result: 实验表明，现有深度伪造检测模型和人类观察者难以识别这些细微但有意义的操纵。

Conclusion: MultiFakeVerse为深度伪造检测研究提供了新挑战，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of GenAI technology over the past few years has
significantly contributed towards highly realistic deepfake content generation.
Despite ongoing efforts, the research community still lacks a large-scale and
reasoning capability driven deepfake benchmark dataset specifically tailored
for person-centric object, context and scene manipulations. In this paper, we
address this gap by introducing MultiFakeVerse, a large scale person-centric
deepfake dataset, comprising 845,286 images generated through manipulation
suggestions and image manipulations both derived from vision-language models
(VLM). The VLM instructions were specifically targeted towards modifications to
individuals or contextual elements of a scene that influence human perception
of importance, intent, or narrative. This VLM-driven approach enables semantic,
context-aware alterations such as modifying actions, scenes, and human-object
interactions rather than synthetic or low-level identity swaps and
region-specific edits that are common in existing datasets. Our experiments
reveal that current state-of-the-art deepfake detection models and human
observers struggle to detect these subtle yet meaningful manipulations. The
code and dataset are available on

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种加速Transducer模型束搜索的通用方法，显著提升了ASR系统的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transducer模型的束搜索速度较慢，限制了其实际应用，因此需要一种加速方法。

Method: 通过批量操作、树状假设结构、新颖的空白评分和CUDA图执行优化束搜索，提出了ALSD++和AES++算法。

Result: 束搜索与贪婪解码的速度差距缩小至10-20%，WER相对提升14-30%，低资源浅融合提升11%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了Transducer模型的实用性和性能，所有算法已开源。

Abstract: Transducer models have emerged as a promising choice for end-to-end ASR
systems, offering a balanced trade-off between recognition accuracy, streaming
capabilities, and inference speed in greedy decoding. However, beam search
significantly slows down Transducers due to repeated evaluations of key network
components, limiting practical applications. This paper introduces a universal
method to accelerate beam search for Transducers, enabling the implementation
of two optimized algorithms: ALSD++ and AES++. The proposed method utilizes
batch operations, a tree-based hypothesis structure, novel blank scoring for
enhanced shallow fusion, and CUDA graph execution for efficient GPU inference.
This narrows the speed gap between beam and greedy modes to only 10-20% for the
whole system, achieves 14-30% relative improvement in WER compared to greedy
decoding, and improves shallow fusion for low-resource up to 11% compared to
existing implementations. All the algorithms are open sourced.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用神经网络集成技术为强制对齐边界生成置信区间的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强制对齐工具通常只提供单一的边界估计，缺乏对边界不确定性的量化。

Method: 通过训练十个不同的分段分类神经网络，重复对齐过程，利用集成结果确定边界中位数并构建97.85%的置信区间。

Result: 在Buckeye和TIMIT语料库上，集成边界比单一模型略有改进，并提供了置信区间输出。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了边界估计的准确性，还为研究者提供了边界不确定性的量化工具。

Abstract: Forced alignment is a common tool to align audio with orthographic and
phonetic transcriptions. Most forced alignment tools provide only a single
estimate of a boundary. The present project introduces a method of deriving
confidence intervals for these boundaries using a neural network ensemble
technique. Ten different segment classifier neural networks were previously
trained, and the alignment process is repeated with each model. The alignment
ensemble is then used to place the boundary at the median of the boundaries in
the ensemble, and 97.85% confidence intervals are constructed using order
statistics. On the Buckeye and TIMIT corpora, the ensemble boundaries show a
slight improvement over using just a single model. The confidence intervals are
incorporated into Praat TextGrids using a point tier, and they are also output
as a table for researchers to analyze separately as diagnostics or to
incorporate uncertainty into their analyses.

Motivation: 研究自监督语音表示的结构，探索语音转换的简单有效方法。

Method: 使用线性变换自监督特征，并通过旋转和奇异值分解（SVD）显式分解内容和说话者信息。

Result: 仅需100维的线性投影即可实现高质量的语音转换。

Conclusion: LinearVC不仅为语音转换提供了实用方法，还深化了对自监督语音表示的理解。

Abstract: We introduce LinearVC, a simple voice conversion method that sheds light on
the structure of self-supervised representations. First, we show that simple
linear transformations of self-supervised features effectively convert voices.
Next, we probe the geometry of the feature space by constraining the set of
allowed transformations. We find that just rotating the features is sufficient
for high-quality voice conversion. This suggests that content information is
embedded in a low-dimensional subspace which can be linearly transformed to
produce a target voice. To validate this hypothesis, we finally propose a
method that explicitly factorizes content and speaker information using
singular value decomposition; the resulting linear projection with a rank of
just 100 gives competitive conversion results. Our work has implications for
both practical voice conversion and a broader understanding of self-supervised
speech representations. Samples and code: https://www.kamperh.com/linearvc/.

TL;DR: GaussianFusion提出了一种基于高斯表示的多传感器融合框架，用于端到端自动驾驶，通过显式和隐式特征提升性能与鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在可解释性或计算开销上存在局限，需一种更高效且直观的融合方式。

Method: 使用2D高斯分布作为中间载体，逐步融合多模态特征，并通过级联规划头优化轨迹预测。

Result: 在NAVSIM和Bench2Drive基准测试中验证了框架的有效性与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GaussianFusion为自动驾驶提供了一种高效且可解释的多传感器融合解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion is crucial for improving the performance and robustness
of end-to-end autonomous driving systems. Existing methods predominantly adopt
either attention-based flatten fusion or bird's eye view fusion through
geometric transformations. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
interpretability or dense computational overhead. In this paper, we introduce
GaussianFusion, a Gaussian-based multi-sensor fusion framework for end-to-end
autonomous driving. Our method employs intuitive and compact Gaussian
representations as intermediate carriers to aggregate information from diverse
sensors. Specifically, we initialize a set of 2D Gaussians uniformly across the
driving scene, where each Gaussian is parameterized by physical attributes and
equipped with explicit and implicit features. These Gaussians are progressively
refined by integrating multi-modal features. The explicit features capture rich
semantic and spatial information about the traffic scene, while the implicit
features provide complementary cues beneficial for trajectory planning. To
fully exploit rich spatial and semantic information in Gaussians, we design a
cascade planning head that iteratively refines trajectory predictions through
interactions with Gaussians. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and
Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the
proposed GaussianFusion framework. The source code will be released at

Motivation: 当前研究主要关注低层次短周期运动或高层次动作规划，忽略了人类活动的分层目标导向特性。

Method: 提出Generative Behavior Control（GBC）框架，利用LLMs生成分层行为计划，并结合机器人任务与运动规划技术控制人类运动。

Result: GBC在GBC-100K数据集上生成了更多样化和高质量的人类运动，运动时长是现有方法的10倍。

Conclusion: GBC为人类行为建模研究奠定了基础，数据集和源代码将公开。

Abstract: Human motion generative modeling or synthesis aims to characterize
complicated human motions of daily activities in diverse real-world
environments. However, current research predominantly focuses on either
low-level, short-period motions or high-level action planning, without taking
into account the hierarchical goal-oriented nature of human activities. In this
work, we take a step forward from human motion generation to human behavior
modeling, which is inspired by cognitive science. We present a unified
framework, dubbed Generative Behavior Control (GBC), to model diverse human
motions driven by various high-level intentions by aligning motions with
hierarchical behavior plans generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
insight is that human motions can be jointly controlled by task and motion
planning in robotics, but guided by LLMs to achieve improved motion diversity
and physical fidelity. Meanwhile, to overcome the limitations of existing
benchmarks, i.e., lack of behavioral plans, we propose GBC-100K dataset
annotated with a hierarchical granularity of semantic and motion plans driven
by target goals. Our experiments demonstrate that GBC can generate more diverse
and purposeful high-quality human motions with 10* longer horizons compared
with existing methods when trained on GBC-100K, laying a foundation for future
research on behavioral modeling of human motions. Our dataset and source code
will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: ActiveSGM通过战略性地选择观测视角，支持更自适应的场景探索，提升了机器人自主性。

Abstract: Effective robotic autonomy in unknown environments demands proactive
exploration and precise understanding of both geometry and semantics. In this
paper, we propose ActiveSGM, an active semantic mapping framework designed to
predict the informativeness of potential observations before execution. Built
upon a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) mapping backbone, our approach employs
semantic and geometric uncertainty quantification, coupled with a sparse
semantic representation, to guide exploration. By enabling robots to
strategically select the most beneficial viewpoints, ActiveSGM efficiently
enhances mapping completeness, accuracy, and robustness to noisy semantic data,
ultimately supporting more adaptive scene exploration. Our experiments on the
Replica and Matterport3D datasets highlight the effectiveness of ActiveSGM in
active semantic mapping tasks.

TL;DR: EnDfuser是一种端到端自动驾驶系统，利用扩散模型作为轨迹规划器，通过集成扩散生成候选轨迹分布，提升驾驶决策的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶系统在规划中未充分考虑不确定性，或使用不具泛化能力的专用表示方法。

Method: 结合注意力池化和轨迹规划，通过扩散变换器模块处理感知信息，生成128条候选轨迹。

Result: 在CARLA的Longest6基准测试中取得70.1的驾驶分数，推理速度影响较小。

Conclusion: 集成扩散模型可替代传统点估计轨迹规划模块，通过建模后验轨迹分布的不确定性提升安全性。

Abstract: End-to-end planning systems for autonomous driving are improving rapidly,
especially in closed-loop simulation environments like CARLA. Many such driving
systems either do not consider uncertainty as part of the plan itself, or
obtain it by using specialized representations that do not generalize. In this
paper, we propose EnDfuser, an end-to-end driving system that uses a diffusion
model as the trajectory planner. EnDfuser effectively leverages complex
perception information like fused camera and LiDAR features, through combining
attention pooling and trajectory planning into a single diffusion transformer
module. Instead of committing to a single plan, EnDfuser produces a
distribution of candidate trajectories (128 for our case) from a single
perception frame through ensemble diffusion. By observing the full set of
candidate trajectories, EnDfuser provides interpretability for uncertain,
multi-modal future trajectory spaces, where there are multiple plausible
options. EnDfuser achieves a competitive driving score of 70.1 on the Longest6
benchmark in CARLA with minimal concessions on inference speed. Our findings
suggest that ensemble diffusion, used as a drop-in replacement for traditional
point-estimate trajectory planning modules, can help improve the safety of
driving decisions by modeling the uncertainty of the posterior trajectory
distribution.

Motivation: 解决3D感知策略在未见指令、场景和物体上泛化能力不足，以及VLA对相机和机器人姿态变化敏感的问题。

Method: 通过将输入观测投影到点云并渲染为标准正交视图，结合视觉主干、大语言模型（LLM）和图像扩散模型生成末端执行器的位置和方向。

Conclusion: OG-VLA展示了在真实世界中的快速适应能力（3到5次演示）和强泛化性能。

Abstract: We introduce OG-VLA, a novel architecture and learning framework that
combines the generalization strengths of Vision Language Action models (VLAs)
with the robustness of 3D-aware policies. We address the challenge of mapping
natural language instructions and multi-view RGBD observations to quasi-static
robot actions. 3D-aware robot policies achieve state-of-the-art performance on
precise robot manipulation tasks, but struggle with generalization to unseen
instructions, scenes, and objects. On the other hand, VLAs excel at
generalizing across instructions and scenes, but can be sensitive to camera and
robot pose variations. We leverage prior knowledge embedded in language and
vision foundation models to improve generalization of 3D-aware keyframe
policies. OG-VLA projects input observations from diverse views into a point
cloud which is then rendered from canonical orthographic views, ensuring input
view invariance and consistency between input and output spaces. These
canonical views are processed with a vision backbone, a Large Language Model
(LLM), and an image diffusion model to generate images that encode the next
position and orientation of the end-effector on the input scene. Evaluations on
the Arnold and Colosseum benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art generalization
to unseen environments, with over 40% relative improvements while maintaining
robust performance in seen settings. We also show real-world adaption in 3 to 5
demonstrations along with strong generalization. Videos and resources at

Result: 实验表明，稀疏想象在保持任务性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为世界模型在实时决策场景中的应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: World model based planning has significantly improved decision-making in
complex environments by enabling agents to simulate future states and make
informed choices. However, ensuring the prediction accuracy of world models
often demands substantial computational resources, posing a major challenge for
real-time applications. This computational burden is particularly restrictive
in robotics, where resources are severely constrained. To address this
limitation, we propose a Sparse Imagination for Efficient Visual World Model
Planning, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of
tokens processed during forward prediction. Our method leverages a sparsely
trained vision-based world model based on transformers with randomized grouped
attention strategy, allowing the model to adaptively adjust the number of
tokens processed based on the computational resource. By enabling sparse
imagination (rollout), our approach significantly accelerates planning while
maintaining high control fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that sparse
imagination preserves task performance while dramatically improving inference
efficiency, paving the way for the deployment of world models in real-time
decision-making scenarios.

Result: 在Habitat 2.0仿真环境和真实机器人平台上，SEMNAV表现优于现有方法，并缩小了仿真与现实的差距。

Conclusion: SEMNAV通过语义分割显著提升VSN的泛化能力，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Semantic Navigation (VSN) is a fundamental problem in robotics, where
an agent must navigate toward a target object in an unknown environment, mainly
using visual information. Most state-of-the-art VSN models are trained in
simulation environments, where rendered scenes of the real world are used, at
best. These approaches typically rely on raw RGB data from the virtual scenes,
which limits their ability to generalize to real-world environments due to
domain adaptation issues. To tackle this problem, in this work, we propose
SEMNAV, a novel approach that leverages semantic segmentation as the main
visual input representation of the environment to enhance the agent's
perception and decision-making capabilities. By explicitly incorporating
high-level semantic information, our model learns robust navigation policies
that improve generalization across unseen environments, both in simulated and
real world settings. We also introduce a newly curated dataset, i.e. the SEMNAV
dataset, designed for training semantic segmentation-aware navigation models
like SEMNAV. Our approach is evaluated extensively in both simulated
environments and with real-world robotic platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that SEMNAV outperforms existing state-of-the-art VSN models,
achieving higher success rates in the Habitat 2.0 simulation environment, using
the HM3D dataset. Furthermore, our real-world experiments highlight the
effectiveness of semantic segmentation in mitigating the sim-to-real gap,
making our model a promising solution for practical VSN-based robotic
applications. We release SEMNAV dataset, code and trained models at

Conclusion: 频域自回归框架结合连续表征为通用机器人操作提供了潜力。

Abstract: Learning effective visuomotor policies for robotic manipulation is
challenging, as it requires generating precise actions while maintaining
computational efficiency. Existing methods remain unsatisfactory due to
inherent limitations in the essential action representation and the basic
network architectures. We observe that representing actions in the frequency
domain captures the structured nature of motion more effectively: low-frequency
components reflect global movement patterns, while high-frequency components
encode fine local details. Additionally, robotic manipulation tasks of varying
complexity demand different levels of modeling precision across these frequency
bands. Motivated by this, we propose a novel paradigm for visuomotor policy
learning that progressively models hierarchical frequency components. To
further enhance precision, we introduce continuous latent representations that
maintain smoothness and continuity in the action space. Extensive experiments
across diverse 2D and 3D robotic manipulation benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and efficiency,
showcasing the potential of a frequency-domain autoregressive framework with
continuous tokens for generalized robotic manipulation.

Abstract: Language-instructed active object localization is a critical challenge for
robots, requiring efficient exploration of partially observable environments.
However, state-of-the-art approaches either struggle to generalize beyond
demonstration datasets (e.g., imitation learning methods) or fail to generate
physically grounded actions (e.g., VLMs). To address these limitations, we
introduce WoMAP (World Models for Active Perception): a recipe for training
open-vocabulary object localization policies that: (i) uses a Gaussian
Splatting-based real-to-sim-to-real pipeline for scalable data generation
without the need for expert demonstrations, (ii) distills dense rewards signals
from open-vocabulary object detectors, and (iii) leverages a latent world model
for dynamics and rewards prediction to ground high-level action proposals at
inference time. Rigorous simulation and hardware experiments demonstrate
WoMAP's superior performance in a broad range of zero-shot object localization
tasks, with more than 9x and 2x higher success rates compared to VLM and
diffusion policy baselines, respectively. Further, we show that WoMAP achieves
strong generalization and sim-to-real transfer on a TidyBot.

TL;DR: RoboMoRe是一个基于大语言模型（LLM）的框架，通过双阶段优化（粗优化和细优化）联合优化机器人形态和奖励函数，显著优于人工设计和其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人协同设计因固定奖励函数易收敛于次优设计，无法探索适合不同形态的多样化运动模式。

Method: RoboMoRe采用双阶段优化：粗优化阶段通过LLM生成多样化形态-奖励对；细优化阶段通过交替更新奖励和形态梯度迭代优化。

Result: 在八项任务中，RoboMoRe无需任务特定提示或预定义模板，显著优于人工设计和其他方法。

Conclusion: RoboMoRe通过LLM驱动的奖励和形态协同优化，解决了机器人协同设计的局限性，实现了更高效的形态和运动行为优化。

Abstract: Robot co-design, jointly optimizing morphology and control policy, remains a
longstanding challenge in the robotics community, where many promising robots
have been developed. However, a key limitation lies in its tendency to converge
to sub-optimal designs due to the use of fixed reward functions, which fail to
explore the diverse motion modes suitable for different morphologies. Here we
propose RoboMoRe, a large language model (LLM)-driven framework that integrates
morphology and reward shaping for co-optimization within the robot co-design
loop. RoboMoRe performs a dual-stage optimization: in the coarse optimization
stage, an LLM-based diversity reflection mechanism generates both diverse and
high-quality morphology-reward pairs and efficiently explores their
distribution. In the fine optimization stage, top candidates are iteratively
refined through alternating LLM-guided reward and morphology gradient updates.
RoboMoRe can optimize both efficient robot morphologies and their suited motion
behaviors through reward shaping. Results demonstrate that without any
task-specific prompting or predefined reward/morphology templates, RoboMoRe
significantly outperforms human-engineered designs and competing methods across
eight different tasks.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种针对3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的攻击方法：CLOAK和DAGGER，揭示了3DGS在安全关键应用中的潜在漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着3DGS在安全关键应用中的普及，研究其潜在的对抗性攻击风险变得尤为重要。

Method: CLOAK利用视角相关的高斯外观嵌入对抗性内容；DAGGER通过扰动3D高斯直接攻击目标检测器。

Result: 攻击成功欺骗了多阶段目标检测器（如Faster R-CNN），展示了3DGS的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这些攻击揭示了3DGS在安全关键应用中的新威胁，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: With 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) being increasingly used in safety-critical
applications, how can an adversary manipulate the scene to cause harm? We
introduce CLOAK, the first attack that leverages view-dependent Gaussian
appearances - colors and textures that change with viewing angle - to embed
adversarial content visible only from specific viewpoints. We further
demonstrate DAGGER, a targeted adversarial attack directly perturbing 3D
Gaussians without access to underlying training data, deceiving multi-stage
object detectors e.g., Faster R-CNN, through established methods such as
projected gradient descent. These attacks highlight underexplored
vulnerabilities in 3DGS, introducing a new potential threat to robotic learning
for autonomous navigation and other safety-critical 3DGS applications.

### [510] [Con Instruction: Universal Jailbreaking of Multimodal Large Language Models via Non-Textual Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00548)
*Jiahui Geng,Thy Thy Tran,Preslav Nakov,Iryna Gurevych*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Con Instruction的新方法，通过对抗性图像或音频绕过多模态语言模型（MLLMs）的安全机制，无需训练数据或文本预处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法主要通过文本和对抗性图像结合，而本文利用MLLMs的非文本指令理解能力，揭示其潜在风险。

Method: 优化对抗性示例以在嵌入空间中与目标指令对齐，结合文本输入增强攻击效果，并引入ARC框架评估响应质量。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5等模型上，攻击成功率最高达81.3%和86.6%，现有防御技术存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: Con Instruction有效绕过MLLMs安全机制，暴露其漏洞，同时公开实现以促进防御研究。

Abstract: Existing attacks against multimodal language models (MLLMs) primarily
communicate instructions through text accompanied by adversarial images. In
contrast, we exploit the capabilities of MLLMs to interpret non-textual
instructions, specifically, adversarial images or audio generated by our novel
method, Con Instruction. We optimize these adversarial examples to align
closely with target instructions in the embedding space, revealing the
detrimental implications of MLLMs' sophisticated understanding. Unlike prior
work, our method does not require training data or preprocessing of textual
instructions. While these non-textual adversarial examples can effectively
bypass MLLM safety mechanisms, their combination with various text inputs
substantially amplifies attack success. We further introduce a new Attack
Response Categorization (ARC) framework, which evaluates both the quality of
the model's response and its relevance to the malicious instructions.
Experimental results demonstrate that Con Instruction effectively bypasses
safety mechanisms in multiple vision- and audio-language models, including
LLaVA-v1.5, InternVL, Qwen-VL, and Qwen-Audio, evaluated on two standard
benchmarks: AdvBench and SafeBench. Specifically, our method achieves the
highest attack success rates, reaching 81.3% and 86.6% on LLaVA-v1.5 (13B). On
the defense side, we explore various countermeasures against our attacks and
uncover a substantial performance gap among existing techniques. Our
implementation is made publicly available.

### [511] [Simple Prompt Injection Attacks Can Leak Personal Data Observed by LLM Agents During Task Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01055)
*Meysam Alizadeh,Zeynab Samei,Daria Stetsenko,Fabrizio Gilardi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 论文研究了提示注入攻击如何导致工具调用代理泄露任务执行中的个人数据，通过虚构银行代理和AgentDojo基准测试，发现LLMs在攻击下效用下降15-50%，平均攻击成功率约20%，部分防御措施可降至0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试对复杂威胁（如数据泄露）的洞察有限，因此研究提示注入攻击对工具调用代理的影响。

Method: 使用虚构银行代理开发基于数据流的攻击，并将其集成到AgentDojo基准测试中，同时创建更丰富的人工智能-人类银行对话数据集。

Result: LLMs在攻击下效用显著下降，平均攻击成功率约20%；部分防御措施有效，但任务类型与防御效果密切相关。

Conclusion: 提示注入攻击对LLMs构成显著威胁，需进一步优化防御措施，尤其是针对数据提取和授权工作流的任务。

Abstract: Previous benchmarks on prompt injection in large language models (LLMs) have
primarily focused on generic tasks and attacks, offering limited insights into
more complex threats like data exfiltration. This paper examines how prompt
injection can cause tool-calling agents to leak personal data observed during
task execution. Using a fictitious banking agent, we develop data flow-based
attacks and integrate them into AgentDojo, a recent benchmark for agentic
security. To enhance its scope, we also create a richer synthetic dataset of
human-AI banking conversations. In 16 user tasks from AgentDojo, LLMs show a
15-50 percentage point drop in utility under attack, with average attack
success rates (ASR) around 20 percent; some defenses reduce ASR to zero. Most
LLMs, even when successfully tricked by the attack, avoid leaking highly
sensitive data like passwords, likely due to safety alignments, but they remain
vulnerable to disclosing other personal data. The likelihood of password
leakage increases when a password is requested along with one or two additional
personal details. In an extended evaluation across 48 tasks, the average ASR is
around 15 percent, with no built-in AgentDojo defense fully preventing leakage.
Tasks involving data extraction or authorization workflows, which closely
resemble the structure of exfiltration attacks, exhibit the highest ASRs,
highlighting the interaction between task type, agent performance, and defense
efficacy.

### [512] [Learning Sparsity for Effective and Efficient Music Performance Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01319)
*Xingjian Diao,Tianzhen Yang,Chunhui Zhang,Weiyi Wu,Ming Cheng,Jiang Gui*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Sparsify的稀疏学习框架，用于解决音乐表演音频-视觉问答（Music AVQA）中的效率问题，通过三种稀疏化策略实现高效表现，并减少训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音乐表演的多模态场景理解和推理存在挑战，现有方法依赖密集且未优化的表示，导致效率低下。

Method: 提出Sparsify框架，集成三种稀疏化策略，并设计关键子集选择算法以提高数据效率。

Result: 在Music AVQA数据集上实现最优性能，训练时间减少28.32%，同时保持准确性；关键子集选择算法仅使用25%训练数据，保留70-80%性能。

Conclusion: Sparsify框架显著提升了Music AVQA任务的效率和性能，为多模态学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Music performances, characterized by dense and continuous audio as well as
seamless audio-visual integration, present unique challenges for multimodal
scene understanding and reasoning. Recent Music Performance Audio-Visual
Question Answering (Music AVQA) datasets have been proposed to reflect these
challenges, highlighting the continued need for more effective integration of
audio-visual representations in complex question answering. However, existing
Music AVQA methods often rely on dense and unoptimized representations, leading
to inefficiencies in the isolation of key information, the reduction of
redundancy, and the prioritization of critical samples. To address these
challenges, we introduce Sparsify, a sparse learning framework specifically
designed for Music AVQA. It integrates three sparsification strategies into an
end-to-end pipeline and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Music AVQA
datasets. In addition, it reduces training time by 28.32% compared to its fully
trained dense counterpart while maintaining accuracy, demonstrating clear
efficiency gains. To further improve data efficiency, we propose a key-subset
selection algorithm that selects and uses approximately 25% of MUSIC-AVQA v2.0
training data and retains 70-80% of full-data performance across models.

*Arjun Prasaath Anbazhagan,Parteek Kumar,Ujjwal Kaur,Aslihan Akalin,Kevin Zhu,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）如何通过文本表示生成音频，发现其能力随音频复杂度增加而下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在文本训练基础上生成音频的潜力，填补文本与音频之间的鸿沟。

Method: 采用三阶段方法（音符、环境音、人声），通过代码作为中介生成音频，并用FAD和CLAP评分评估质量。

Result: LLMs能生成基础音频，但复杂度增加时性能下降，表明其音频生成能力有限。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究提升LLM生成音频的质量和多样性，以改进其性能。

Abstract: How does textual representation of audio relate to the Large Language Model's
(LLMs) learning about the audio world? This research investigates the extent to
which LLMs can be prompted to generate audio, despite their primary training in
textual data. We employ a three-tier approach, progressively increasing the
complexity of audio generation: 1) Musical Notes, 2) Environmental Sounds, and
3) Human Speech. To bridge the gap between text and audio, we leverage code as
an intermediary, prompting LLMs to generate code that, when executed, produces
the desired audio output. To evaluate the quality and accuracy of the generated
audio, we employ FAD and CLAP scores. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can
generate basic audio features, their performance deteriorates as the complexity
of the audio increases. This suggests that while LLMs possess a latent
understanding of the auditory world, their ability to translate this
understanding into tangible audio output remains rudimentary. Further research
into techniques that can enhance the quality and diversity of LLM-generated
audio can lead to an improvement in the performance of text-based LLMs in
generating audio.

### [514] [XMAD-Bench: Cross-Domain Multilingual Audio Deepfake Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00462)
*Ioan-Paul Ciobanu,Andrei-Iulian Hiji,Nicolae-Catalin Ristea,Paul Irofti,Cristian Rusu,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文介绍了XMAD-Bench，一个跨领域多语言音频深度伪造基准测试，揭示了现有检测器在跨领域测试中性能显著下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频深度伪造技术日益普及，导致公众面临更多风险，而现有检测器在跨领域测试中的性能未被充分研究。

Method: 构建了包含668.8小时真实和伪造语音的跨领域数据集，训练和测试数据在说话者、生成方法和音频来源上完全独立。

Result: 实验显示检测器在领域内性能接近100%，但在跨领域测试中性能可能接近随机猜测。

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发具有跨领域泛化能力的音频深度伪造检测器的必要性，并公开了XMAD-Bench基准测试。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio generation led to an increasing number of deepfakes,
making the general public more vulnerable to financial scams, identity theft,
and misinformation. Audio deepfake detectors promise to alleviate this issue,
with many recent studies reporting accuracy rates close to 99%. However, these
methods are typically tested in an in-domain setup, where the deepfake samples
from the training and test sets are produced by the same generative models. To
this end, we introduce XMAD-Bench, a large-scale cross-domain multilingual
audio deepfake benchmark comprising 668.8 hours of real and deepfake speech. In
our novel dataset, the speakers, the generative methods, and the real audio
sources are distinct across training and test splits. This leads to a
challenging cross-domain evaluation setup, where audio deepfake detectors can
be tested ``in the wild''. Our in-domain and cross-domain experiments indicate
a clear disparity between the in-domain performance of deepfake detectors,
which is usually as high as 100%, and the cross-domain performance of the same
models, which is sometimes similar to random chance. Our benchmark highlights
the need for the development of robust audio deepfake detectors, which maintain
their generalization capacity across different languages, speakers, generative
methods, and data sources. Our benchmark is publicly released at
https://github.com/ristea/xmad-bench/.

### [515] [Attention Is Not Always the Answer: Optimizing Voice Activity Detection with Simple Feature Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01365)
*Kumud Tripathi,Chowdam Venkata Kumar,Pankaj Wasnik*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出FusionVAD框架，结合MFCC和预训练模型特征，通过三种融合策略提升语音活动检测性能，实验表明简单融合（如加法）优于交叉注意力，且融合模型优于单特征模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音活动检测（VAD）在语音处理中至关重要，但现有方法多依赖手工或单一神经网络特征，研究旨在探索MFCC与预训练模型特征的互补性。

Method: 提出FusionVAD框架，采用拼接、加法和交叉注意力三种策略融合MFCC与预训练模型特征（如wav2vec 2.0、HuBERT等）。

Result: 实验显示加法融合效果最佳，融合模型性能优于单特征模型，并在多个数据集上超越当前最优方法Pyannote，平均提升2.04%。

Conclusion: 简单特征融合能显著提升VAD的鲁棒性和计算效率，验证了MFCC与预训练模型特征的互补性。

Abstract: Voice Activity Detection (VAD) plays a key role in speech processing, often
utilizing hand-crafted or neural features. This study examines the
effectiveness of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and pre-trained
model (PTM) features, including wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, UniSpeech, MMS, and
Whisper. We propose FusionVAD, a unified framework that combines both feature
types using three fusion strategies: concatenation, addition, and
cross-attention (CA). Experimental results reveal that simple fusion
techniques, particularly addition, outperform CA in both accuracy and
efficiency. Fusion-based models consistently surpass single-feature models,
highlighting the complementary nature of MFCCs and PTM features. Notably, our
best-performing fusion model exceeds the state-of-the-art Pyannote across
multiple datasets, achieving an absolute average improvement of 2.04%. These
results confirm that simple feature fusion enhances VAD robustness while
maintaining computational efficiency.
