### [2] [Policy Optimization Prefers The Path of Least Resistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21853)
*Debdeep Sanyal,Aakash Sen Sharma,Dhruv Kumar,Saurabh Deshpande,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 政策优化算法在开放式的思维链结构中会优先选择最简单的奖励路径，导致模型放弃显式推理而退化到直接回答格式，即使复杂格式被赋予更高奖励权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前严格约束的思维链格式在政策优化中被放松为开放式结构时的行为表现，探索政策优化在灵活推理中的潜在问题。

Method: 通过一系列受控实验和奖励分解实验，分析不同模型和算法在开放式思维链结构中的行为模式。

Result: 政策优化始终遵循最小阻力路径，即使复杂思维链格式被赋予4倍奖励权重，模型仍会退化到直接回答格式。

Conclusion: 给予政策优化的自由度是一把双刃剑：虽然能发现高奖励捷径，但也创造了奖励函数被简单利用的风险，这对对齐构成了关键挑战。

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) algorithms are used to refine Large Language Models
for complex, multi-step reasoning. Current state-of-the-art pipelines enforce a
strict think-then-answer format to elicit chain-of-thought (CoT); however, the
behavior of PO when these rigid constraints are relaxed into an open-ended CoT
structure remains an under-studied question. We investigate this gap with an
extensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:
\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.
When afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy
optimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the
policy to degenerate to a direct \texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome
holds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in
format is persistent even when the complex \texttt{<think><answer>} format is
assigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a
series of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear
hierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,
a preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or
strong incentives for more complex behaviors. Finally, we show that successful
convergence on the high-reward shortcut is not a low-effort drift but is driven
by the optimization process that requires the KL-regularized policy to have
sufficient freedom to make a significant shift from its initial prior. Our
findings reveal that granting policies the freedom to diverge is a double-edged
sword: while necessary for discovering high-reward shortcuts, it also creates a
powerful incentive to game the simplest aspects of the reward function, posing
a critical challenge for reward hacking under alignment.

### [3] [Language Ranker: A Lightweight Ranking framework for LLM Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21883)
*Chenheng Zhang,Tianqi Du,Jizhe Zhang,Mingqing Xiao,Yifei Wang,Yisen Wang,Zhouchen Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Language Ranker框架，将LLM解码过程重新定义为推荐系统中的排序阶段，通过轻量级模块重排候选响应，在性能媲美大型奖励模型的同时显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM研究主要关注优化输出分布，而忽视了将分布转化为最终响应的解码过程。现有方法如奖励模型计算成本高且适用性有限，传统解码方法存在冗余等明显局限。

Method: 借鉴推荐系统思路，将解码过程类比为推荐流水线中的排序阶段。提出Language Ranker框架，使用基础模型提取特征，通过轻量级模块（仅需<0.5M参数）对候选响应进行重排。

Result: 在广泛任务上的实验表明，Language Ranker性能与大规模奖励模型相当，同时训练和推理阶段的计算开销显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且有效，展示了充分释放LLM潜力的潜力，为解码过程提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Conventional research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused
on refining output distributions, while paying less attention to the decoding
process that transforms these distributions into final responses. Recent
advances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models,
have underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer
from high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we
revisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing
the decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation
pipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding
methods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy.
Motivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that
introduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features
extracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that
Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models,
while requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the
computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This
highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, showcasing its
potential to fully unlock the capabilities of LLMs.

### [4] [Framework for Machine Evaluation of Reasoning Completeness in Large Language Models For Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21884)
*Avinash Patil*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RACE框架评估LLM生成解释与逻辑回归特征重要性之间的对齐度，发现正确预测更覆盖支持特征，错误预测更覆盖矛盾特征，揭示了LLM解释的忠实性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习在敏感领域的应用增加，对可解释AI的需求日益增长。LLM能生成自然语言解释，但这些解释是否真实反映决策依据尚不明确。

Method: 提出RACE框架，在四个文本分类数据集上比较LLM解释与逻辑回归的特征重要性，使用token感知、精确字符串和编辑距离匹配技术评估对齐度。

Result: 实证结果显示一致的不对称性：正确预测更覆盖支持特征，错误预测更覆盖矛盾特征。编辑距离匹配发现释义重叠，提高覆盖率但保持不对称性。

Conclusion: LLM解释结合了表层和灵活的证据重用，但在错误情况下也会放大误导线索。RACE为评估神经语言模型推理完整性提供了量化基础。

Abstract: The growing adoption of machine learning (ML) in sensitive domains has
heightened the demand for transparent and interpretable artificial
intelligence. Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of
producing natural language explanations, yet it remains unclear whether these
rationales faithfully capture the predictive signals that underlie decisions.
This paper introduces RACE-Reasoning Alignment for Completeness of
Explanations, a systematic framework to evaluate the alignment between
LLM-generated explanations and interpretable feature importance scores derived
from a logistic regression baseline. We analyze four widely used text
classification datasets-WIKI ONTOLOGY, AG NEWS, IMDB, and GOEMOTIONS-and
compare LLM rationales against top-ranked supporting and contradicting lexical
features. To capture alignment at multiple levels of granularity, RACE
implements token-aware, exact string, and edit-distance matching techniques.
Empirical results reveal a consistent asymmetry: correct predictions exhibit
higher coverage of supporting features, while incorrect predictions are
associated with elevated coverage of contradicting features. Edit-distance
matching further uncovers paraphrastic overlaps, boosting coverage while
preserving this asymmetry. These findings demonstrate that LLM rationales
combine both surface-level and flexible evidence reuse, yet can also amplify
misleading cues in error cases. RACE provides new insights into the
faithfulness of LLM explanations and establishes a quantitative basis for
evaluating reasoning completeness in neural language models.

### [5] [Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting: Behavior-Aware Sampling for Safer Language Model Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21885)
*Anh Pham,Mihir Thalanki,Michael Sun,Aditya Chaloo,Ankita Gupta,Tian Xia,Aditya Mate,Ehimwenma Nosakhare,Soundararajan Srinivasan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出行为感知采样框架，通过基于指令-响应行为和语义多样性的安全示例选择，有效缓解大语言模型微调时的灾难性遗忘问题，仅需0.5%额外训练数据即可将有害输出减少41%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在良性数据微调时经常失去之前对齐的安全行为，即灾难性遗忘现象。虽然添加随机安全示例可以缓解此问题，但哪些示例最有效仍不清楚。

Method: 提出行为感知采样框架，基于两个互补因素选择安全示例：指令-响应行为（如拒绝vs遵从）和跨伤害类别的语义多样性。

Result: 系统评估显示该方法显著减少有害输出同时保持有用性，仅用0.5%额外训练数据即可实现高达41%的有害性降低。

Conclusion: 结果表明目标数据选择可以大规模提高微调的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models often lose previously aligned safety behaviors when
fine-tuned on benign data, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Prior
work shows that adding random safety examples can mitigate this effect, but it
remains unclear which examples are most effective. We propose a behavior-aware
sampling framework that selects safety examples based on two complementary
factors: instruction-response behavior (e.g., refusal versus compliance) and
semantic diversity across harm categories. Systematic evaluation shows that
this approach substantially reduces harmful outputs while maintaining
helpfulness, achieving up to a 41% reduction in harmfulness with only 0.5%
additional training data. These results highlight how targeted data selection
can improve the safety and efficiency of fine-tuning at scale.

### [6] [Embedding Trust: Semantic Isotropy Predicts Nonfactuality in Long-Form Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21891)
*Dhrupad Bhardwaj,Julia Kempe,Tim G. J. Rudner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出语义各向同性方法，通过分析文本嵌入在单位球面上的分布均匀性来评估LLM长文本响应的可信度，无需标注数据或调参。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险应用领域部署LLM时，需要可靠且计算成本低的方法来评估长文本响应的可信度，现有基于逐条事实核查的方法计算昂贵且脆弱。

Method: 生成多个长文本响应，将其嵌入到向量空间，通过计算嵌入向量在单位球面上的角度离散度来估计语义各向同性水平。

Result: 发现更高的语义各向同性（即更大的嵌入离散度）可靠地表明样本间的事实一致性较低，该方法在多个领域均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、低成本的信任评估方法，可集成到实际LLM工作流程中，无需标注数据、微调或超参数选择。

Abstract: To deploy large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes application domains
that require substantively accurate responses to open-ended prompts, we need
reliable, computationally inexpensive methods that assess the trustworthiness
of long-form responses generated by LLMs. However, existing approaches often
rely on claim-by-claim fact-checking, which is computationally expensive and
brittle in long-form responses to open-ended prompts. In this work, we
introduce semantic isotropy -- the degree of uniformity across normalized text
embeddings on the unit sphere -- and use it to assess the trustworthiness of
long-form responses generated by LLMs. To do so, we generate several long-form
responses, embed them, and estimate the level of semantic isotropy of these
responses as the angular dispersion of the embeddings on the unit sphere. We
find that higher semantic isotropy -- that is, greater embedding dispersion --
reliably signals lower factual consistency across samples. Our approach
requires no labeled data, no fine-tuning, and no hyperparameter selection, and
can be used with open- or closed-weight embedding models. Across multiple
domains, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in predicting
nonfactuality in long-form responses using only a handful of samples --
offering a practical, low-cost approach for integrating trust assessment into
real-world LLM workflows.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NetMind是一个使用自然语言查询网络的框架，通过树形配置分块、统一事实图和混合命令式-声明式语言解决LLM在网络配置理解中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网络配置分析方法依赖领域特定语言和形式化模型，学习曲线陡峭且灵活性有限。自然语言接口更易用，但LLM在处理长配置、设备异构性和复杂网络拓扑方面存在挑战。

Method: 1) 树形配置分块策略保持语义连贯性；2) 构建统一事实图作为中间表示；3) 设计混合命令式-声明式语言减轻LLM推理负担。

Result: 实验表明NetMind在准确性和可扩展性方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: NetMind通过创新的配置处理方法和推理优化，实现了高效准确的网络行为理解，为自然语言网络查询提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Modern large-scale networks introduce significant complexity in understanding
network behaviors, increasing the risk of misconfiguration. Prior work proposed
to understand network behaviors by mining network configurations, typically
relying on domain-specific languages interfaced with formal models. While
effective, they suffer from a steep learning curve and limited flexibility. In
contrast, natural language (NL) offers a more accessible and interpretable
interface, motivating recent research on NL-guided network behavior
understanding. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) further enhance
this direction, leveraging their extensive prior knowledge of network concepts
and strong reasoning capabilities. However, three key challenges remain: 1)
numerous router devices with lengthy configuration files challenge LLM's
long-context understanding ability; 2) heterogeneity across devices and
protocols impedes scalability; and 3) complex network topologies and protocols
demand advanced reasoning abilities beyond the current capabilities of LLMs. To
tackle the above challenges, we propose NetMind, a novel framework for querying
networks using NL. Our approach introduces a tree-based configuration chunking
strategy to preserve semantic coherence while enabling efficient partitioning.
We then construct a unified fact graph as an intermediate representation to
normalize vendor-specific configurations. Finally, we design a hybrid
imperative-declarative language to reduce the reasoning burden on LLMs and
enhance precision. We contribute a benchmark consisting of NL question-answer
pairs paired with network configurations. Experiments demonstrate that NetMind
achieves accurate and scalable network behavior understanding, outperforming
existing baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出IterSurvey框架，通过迭代式大纲生成和论文卡片机制，改进传统一次性检索方法的局限性，显著提升文献综述的质量和可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文献综述生成系统采用一次性检索和静态大纲生成，导致检索噪声大、结构碎片化、上下文过载等问题，限制了综述质量。受人类研究者迭代阅读过程的启发，需要更智能的生成方法。

Method: 1. 基于循环大纲生成的框架，规划代理逐步检索、阅读和更新大纲；2. 设计论文卡片提炼每篇论文的贡献、方法和发现；3. 引入审查-精炼循环和可视化增强，改善文本流畅度并整合多模态元素。

Result: 在既有和新兴主题上的实验表明，IterSurvey在内容覆盖度、结构连贯性和引用质量方面显著优于现有基线方法，生成更易访问和组织更好的综述。

Conclusion: IterSurvey通过迭代式方法有效解决了传统文献综述生成的局限性，同时引入Survey-Arena评估基准，为机器生成与人工撰写综述的比较提供了更可靠的评估标准。

Abstract: Automatic literature survey generation has attracted increasing attention,
yet most existing systems follow a one-shot paradigm, where a large set of
papers is retrieved at once and a static outline is generated before drafting.
This design often leads to noisy retrieval, fragmented structures, and context
overload, ultimately limiting survey quality. Inspired by the iterative reading
process of human researchers, we propose \ours, a framework based on recurrent
outline generation, in which a planning agent incrementally retrieves, reads,
and updates the outline to ensure both exploration and coherence. To provide
faithful paper-level grounding, we design paper cards that distill each paper
into its contributions, methods, and findings, and introduce a
review-and-refine loop with visualization enhancement to improve textual flow
and integrate multimodal elements such as figures and tables. Experiments on
both established and emerging topics show that \ours\ substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in content coverage, structural coherence, and
citation quality, while producing more accessible and better-organized surveys.
To provide a more reliable assessment of such improvements, we further
introduce Survey-Arena, a pairwise benchmark that complements absolute scoring
and more clearly positions machine-generated surveys relative to human-written
ones. The code is available at
https://github.com/HancCui/IterSurvey\_Autosurveyv2.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: The number of tokens it takes to encode parallel text in different languages
is known to vary. These disparities are called token premiums. Having high
token premiums leads to less throughput during training and increases costs at
inference. In this paper, we show that even after controlling for dataset size,
vocabulary size, and data content, monolingual tokenizers exhibit a wide range
of token premiums across languages. To understand the cross-linguistic
differences that cause these token premiums, we train a suite of approximately
7,000 comparable monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages, manipulating
tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and dataset size. We measure token
premiums and test for a relationship between factors such as data similarity
(between tokenizer training and evaluation), vocabulary size, and
pre-tokenization. We also investigate the role of language-specific features
such as writing system and word length. We find that similarity between
training and test data does not impact token premiums, but vocabulary size and
pre-tokenization do. While simply increasing vocabulary size does not lead to
reduced token premium effects, we can determine an ``optimal'' vocabulary size
for each language to achieve significantly reduced token premium effects. We
also train superword tokenizers which allow merges over whitespaces, and we
find that they both reduce token premium effects and improve compression
overall. Thus, intervening on the vocabulary size or the pre-tokenizer
significantly reduces crosslingual token premium effects.

### [10] [Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21954)
*Mykola Haltiuk,Aleksander Smywiński-Pohl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MATT是一种模型感知的分词器迁移方法，通过注意力影响建模目标将源模型的token间通信模式蒸馏到使用新分词器的目标模型中，相比仅关注嵌入相似性的方法，MATT利用注意力行为指导嵌入初始化和适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型支持的语言数量不断增加，但预定义的分词器仍然是适应低资源或不同文字语言时的瓶颈。现有的分词器迁移方法通常依赖语义启发式来初始化新嵌入，忽略了更高层的模型动态，限制了迁移质量。

Method: 提出模型感知分词器迁移(MATT)方法，引入注意力影响建模(AIM)目标，将源模型的token间通信模式蒸馏到使用新分词器的目标模型中，为标准语言建模提供高效预热。

Result: 在多样化语言设置下的实验表明，MATT在几个GPU小时内恢复了原始模型性能的很大一部分，优于启发式基线方法。

Conclusion: 这些结果表明，融入模型级信号为多语言LLM中稳健的分词器迁移提供了一条实用且有效的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to support an increasing number of
languages, yet their predefined tokenizers remain a bottleneck for adapting
models to lower-resource or distinct-script languages. Existing tokenizer
transfer methods typically rely on semantic heuristics to initialize new
embeddings, ignoring higher-layer model dynamics and limiting transfer quality.
We propose Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT), a method that incorporates
model internals into the tokenizer transfer process. MATT introduces an
Attention Influence Modeling (AIM) objective that distills inter-token
communication patterns from a source model into a target model with a new
tokenizer, providing an efficient warm-up before standard language modeling.
Unlike approaches that focus solely on embedding similarity, MATT leverages
attention behavior to guide embedding initialization and adaptation.
Experiments across diverse linguistic settings show that MATT recovers a large
fraction of the original model's performance within a few GPU hours,
outperforming heuristic baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating
model-level signals offers a practical and effective path toward robust
tokenizer transfer in multilingual LLMs.

TL;DR: 使用GPT-2模型通过训练特定作者的文本来识别作者写作风格，能够区分不同作者的文本，并成功确认了Oz系列第15本书的真实作者身份。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能够捕捉和识别不同作者的独特写作风格，用于作者身份识别和归属确认。

Method: 为每个作者单独训练GPT-2模型，通过比较模型对保留文本的预测准确性来识别作者风格。

Result: 模型能够准确区分八位不同作者的写作风格，并成功确认R. P. Thompson是Oz系列第15本书的真实作者，而非原先认为的F. L. Baum。

Conclusion: GPT-2模型能够有效体现作者的独特写作风格，为作者身份识别提供了一种新的技术方法。

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used to distinguish the
writings of different authors. Specifically, an individual GPT-2 model, trained
from scratch on the works of one author, will predict held-out text from that
author more accurately than held-out text from other authors. We suggest that,
in this way, a model trained on one author's works embodies the unique writing
style of that author. We first demonstrate our approach on books written by
eight different (known) authors. We also use this approach to confirm R. P.
Thompson's authorship of the well-studied 15th book of the Oz series,
originally attributed to F. L. Baum.

TL;DR: 该论文研究如何利用社会科学中的说服理论来构建对抗性提示，从而绕过LLM的对齐约束，引发越狱行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有多种越狱攻击策略，但很少关注影响模型易受攻击性的语言和心理机制。作者认为LLM在人类生成文本上训练，可能对具有说服结构的提示更易服从。

Method: 借鉴社会科学的成熟说服策略，构建具有说服结构的对抗性提示，并在多个对齐LLM上进行实证评估。

Result: 实证评估显示，具有说服意识的提示能显著绕过安全防护，诱导越狱行为。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了跨学科见解在应对LLM安全挑战中的重要性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While
prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human
readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the
linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's
susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary
line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the
social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment
constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we
hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text,
may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures.
Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive
fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations
across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly
bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors.
This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in
addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are
available.

TL;DR: 本文分析了离散优化越狱攻击在大型语言模型中的可转移性，识别了三个与转移成功强相关的统计特性，并发现语义相似性对转移成功的影响较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管离散优化越狱攻击的转移性已被广泛观察，但缺乏对其发生时机和原因的严格分析。本文旨在填补这一空白，深入理解转移性的机制。

Method: 通过大量实验设置，识别了三个与转移成功强相关的统计特性：无后缀提示激活模型拒绝方向的程度、后缀诱导远离拒绝方向的强度、以及正交于拒绝方向的偏移大小。

Result: 研究发现三个统计特性与转移成功强相关，而提示语义相似性仅弱相关。这些发现为理解转移性提供了更精细的视角。

Conclusion: 本文对转移性的统计分析可以转化为实际攻击成功的改进，通过干预性实验展示了这一分析的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Discrete optimization-based jailbreaking attacks on large language models aim
to generate short, nonsensical suffixes that, when appended onto input prompts,
elicit disallowed content. Notably, these suffixes are often transferable --
succeeding on prompts and models for which they were never optimized. And yet,
despite the fact that transferability is surprising and empirically
well-established, the field lacks a rigorous analysis of when and why transfer
occurs. To fill this gap, we identify three statistical properties that
strongly correlate with transfer success across numerous experimental settings:
(1) how much a prompt without a suffix activates a model's internal refusal
direction, (2) how strongly a suffix induces a push away from this direction,
and (3) how large these shifts are in directions orthogonal to refusal. On the
other hand, we find that prompt semantic similarity only weakly correlates with
transfer success. These findings lead to a more fine-grained understanding of
transferability, which we use in interventional experiments to showcase how our
statistical analysis can translate into practical improvements in attack
success.

*Yilin Zhang,Wenda Xu,Zhongtao Liu,Tetsuji Nakagawa,Markus Freitag*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了质量评估(QE)指标中的长度偏见问题，发现QE指标普遍存在对长文本过度预测错误和对短翻译偏好的偏见，提出了长度归一化和参考文本两种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质量评估指标在机器翻译中至关重要，但长度偏见的影响尚未充分探索。现有QE指标可能不公平地惩罚较长的正确翻译，在重排序和强化学习等应用中导致次优决策。

Method: 对10种不同语言对中的顶级回归基和LLM-as-a-Judge QE指标进行系统研究，识别两种关键长度偏见，并提出长度归一化训练和评估时加入参考文本两种缓解方法。

Result: 研究发现QE指标确实存在系统性长度偏见：随着翻译长度增加，即使对高质量无错误文本也会过度预测错误；在多个候选翻译中偏好较短翻译。提出的两种策略都能有效减少这种偏见。

Conclusion: QE指标存在显著的长度偏见问题，可能影响翻译评估的公平性。通过长度归一化和参考文本集成可以有效缓解这些偏见，提高QE指标在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) metrics are vital in machine translation for
reference-free evaluation and as a reward signal in tasks like reinforcement
learning. However, the prevalence and impact of length bias in QE have been
underexplored. Through a systematic study of top-performing regression-based
and LLM-as-a-Judge QE metrics across 10 diverse language pairs, we reveal two
critical length biases: First, QE metrics consistently over-predict errors with
increasing translation length, even for high-quality, error-free texts. Second,
they exhibit a preference for shorter translations when multiple candidates are
available for the same source text. These inherent length biases risk unfairly
penalizing longer, correct translations and can lead to sub-optimal
decision-making in applications such as QE reranking and QE guided
reinforcement learning. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: (a)
applying length normalization during model training, and (b) incorporating
reference texts during evaluation. Both approaches were found to effectively
reduce the identified length bias.

*Shayne Longpre,Sneha Kudugunta,Niklas Muennighoff,I-Hung Hsu,Isaac Caswell,Alex Pentland,Sercan Arik,Chen-Yu Lee,Sayna Ebrahimi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文进行了迄今为止最大的多语言缩放定律研究，包含774个多语言训练实验，覆盖10M-8B参数范围、400+训练语言和48个评估语言，提出了优于现有方法的自适应迁移缩放定律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究主要集中在英语，而最先进的AI模型需要服务全球数十亿用户，因此需要研究多语言环境下的缩放定律。

Method: 通过大规模多语言训练实验，引入自适应迁移缩放定律(ATLAS)，分析多语言学习动态、语言间迁移特性以及多语言诅咒问题，推导跨语言迁移矩阵和语言无关的缩放定律。

Result: ATLAS在样本外泛化方面比现有缩放定律提高了0.3 R²以上，识别了38x38=1444个语言对的互惠得分，确定了从头训练与从多语言检查点微调的计算交叉点。

Conclusion: 这些发现为跨语言民主化缩放定律提供了科学基础，使从业者能够有效扩展模型，超越以英语为先的AI发展模式。

Abstract: Scaling laws research has focused overwhelmingly on English -- yet the most
prominent AI models explicitly serve billions of international users. In this
work, we undertake the largest multilingual scaling laws study to date,
totaling 774 multilingual training experiments, spanning 10M-8B model
parameters, 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. We introduce
the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) for both monolingual and multilingual
pretraining, which outperforms existing scaling laws' out-of-sample
generalization often by more than 0.3 R^2. Our analyses of the experiments shed
light on multilingual learning dynamics, transfer properties between languages,
and the curse of multilinguality. First, we derive a cross-lingual transfer
matrix, empirically measuring mutual benefit scores between 38 x 38=1444
language pairs. Second, we derive a language-agnostic scaling law that reveals
how to optimally scale model size and data when adding languages without
sacrificing performance. Third, we identify the computational crossover points
for when to pretrain from scratch versus finetune from multilingual
checkpoints. We hope these findings provide the scientific foundation for
democratizing scaling laws across languages, and enable practitioners to
efficiently scale models -- beyond English-first AI.

*Benjamin Reichman,Adar Avsian,Larry Heck*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析LLM隐藏状态空间的几何结构，揭示了其内部情感表示的低维情感流形，发现情感表征具有方向性编码、跨层分布的特点，并能跨语言和数据集泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何内部表示情感，理解其情感处理机制，为情感操控提供理论基础。

Method: 分析LLM隐藏状态空间的几何结构，识别低维情感流形，研究情感表征的方向性编码和跨层分布特性，并在8个真实世界情感数据集上进行验证。

Result: 发现情感表征形成稳定的低维流形，具有跨语言和数据集的可泛化性，能够通过干预模块操控内部情感感知而不影响语义。

Conclusion: LLM内部存在一致且可操控的情感几何结构，这为理解模型如何内化和处理情感提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This work investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally represent
emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hidden-state space. The paper
identifies a low-dimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional
representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and
aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures are stable across depth
and generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages.
Cross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance,
indicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion
perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned
intervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across
languages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective
geometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process
emotion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文比较了六种减轻LLM性别偏见的技术，发现监督微调(SFT)在约束合规性和词汇多样性方面表现最佳，而基于偏好的方法(如DPO)无法满足组合约束要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型即使在职业中性语境中仍会产生性别刻板印象语言，反映了深层社会偏见。现有偏见缓解方法的比较效果和学习动态尚不明确。

Method: 比较分析六种偏见缓解控制技术：仅提示、生成后过滤、DFA-based Ctrl-G解码、监督微调(SFT)、直接偏好优化(DPO)和迭代零空间投影(INLP)，在组合约束任务上进行评估。

Result: SFT达到99.87%合规性和高词汇多样性，DPO仅4.53%合规性。Ctrl-G保证完美合规但严重降低流畅性和多样性。基于偏好的学习无法满足组合约束。

Conclusion: 只有显式正监督才能缓解组合偏见，偏好学习无法泛化逻辑结构，强调了显式监督对于公平流畅控制生成的必要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still produce gender-stereotyped language even
in occupation-neutral contexts that reflect deep societal biases (Rudinger et
al., 2018). To address this, prior work has proposed prompting, constrained
decoding (Dathathri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2024), post-processing, and
fine-tuning-based alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Ravfogel et al., 2022).
However, the comparative efficacy and learning dynamics remain little
understood. We report a comparative analysis of six control techniques for bias
mitigation: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and
Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP). We evaluate each method on a
compositional constraint task. This task requires generating sentences that
contain at least one agentic and one communal descriptor for each of the twenty
Winogender-derived occupations. We quantify trade-offs between control strength
and naturalness with evaluations of constraint compliance, lexical diversity,
and fluency. Our results reveal key contrasts among the methods: SFT achieves
99.87 +- 0.15% compliance and high lexical diversity, while DPO, despite
similar training stability, fails at 4.53 +- 0.82%. Ctrl-G guarantees perfect
compliance, but at the cost of severely reduced fluency and diversity.
Preference-based learning fundamentally differs: it cannot satisfy
compositional constraints, as binary preference signals encode ranking, not
logical conjunctions. Only explicit positive supervision enables mitigation of
compositional biases; preference-based alignment fails to generalize logical
structures, underscoring the limitations of preference learning and the
necessity of explicit supervision for fair and fluent controlled generation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS)框架，通过信息瓶颈理论区分LLM的泛化与记忆模式，并在推理时动态引导模型偏向泛化模式，提升逻辑一致性和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM存在泛化能力和逐字记忆的双重特性，这种不可预测性在高风险应用中影响可靠性。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈理论建立理论模型，开发DMS算法：包含因果线性探针识别记忆依赖，以及动态激活引导机制将计算导向泛化电路。

Result: 在推理和真实性任务上的实验表明，DMS显著改善了逻辑一致性和事实准确性。

Conclusion: DMS为增强LLM可靠性提供了一种原则性方法，通过自适应自对比解码实现推理时模式控制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a troubling duality, capable of both
remarkable generalization and brittle, verbatim memorization of their training
data. This unpredictability undermines their reliability in high-stakes
applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to understand,
identify, and control these distinct reasoning modes. First, we introduce a
theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle,
formalizing generalization as the learning of a compressed, task-relevant
representation and memorization as a failure to compress. Building on this
theory, we develop Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), a novel inference-time
algorithm which comprises two components: (1) a lightweight, causally-grounded
linear probe that identifies the model's instantaneous reliance on
memorization, and (2) a dynamic activation steering mechanism that nudges the
model's computation towards pre-identified generalization circuits. We frame
DMS as a form of adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning
and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that DMS significantly improves logical
consistency and factual accuracy, thereby offering a principled approach to
enhancing LLM reliability.

*Billy Dickson,Zoran Tiganj*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过输入令牌的对数压缩来扩展Transformer长程记忆的方法，而不是修改模型架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长上下文处理方法通常通过集成递归或辅助记忆模块来增加Transformer内部架构的复杂性，本文寻求一种更简单的替代方案。

Method: 受人类记忆认知模型启发，对输入令牌应用尺度不变的对数压缩，使用标准未修改的Transformer处理压缩后的表示。

Result: 在WikiText-103和PG-19语言建模基准测试中，相比未压缩基线降低了困惑度，且随着压缩时间上下文变长，性能持续提升。

Conclusion: 输入级对数压缩是扩展Transformer长程记忆的简单有效方法，保持了架构的简洁性。

Abstract: Most approaches to long-context processing increase the complexity of the
transformer's internal architecture by integrating mechanisms such as
recurrence or auxiliary memory modules. In this work, we introduce an
alternative approach that modifies the input representation itself, rather than
the transformer architecture. Inspired by cognitive models of human memory, our
method applies a scale-invariant logarithmic compression to the input tokens.
The resulting compressed representation is processed by a standard, unmodified
transformer, preserving architectural simplicity. We evaluate this approach on
the WikiText-103 and PG-19 language modeling benchmarks, showing a reduction in
perplexity compared to uncompressed baselines. Moreover, performance improves
consistently with longer compressed temporal contexts, showing that input-level
logarithmic compression is a simple and effective way to extend a transformer's
long-range memory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于"每个激活都应增强推理能力"的原则，旨在构建可扩展的高效推理模型，解决传统密集模型在推理任务上计算效率低下的问题。

Method: 采用高稀疏度的MoE架构，结合MTP高效推理机制；使用推理导向的数据和训练中思维链激活；实施基于强化的微调(DFT、Evo-CoT)；采用全规模FP8训练和细粒度异构流水线。

Result: Ling-1T在万亿参数规模上建立了推理准确性与计算效率的新帕累托前沿，稀疏激活与推理目标正确对齐时能够实现可扩展且高效的智能。

Conclusion: Ling 2.0为推进未来推理和思维模型提供了一个连贯、开放且高效的基础，包括基于相同基础的Ring系列模型。

Abstract: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built
upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed
to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity,
cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The
series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0,
Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and
achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense
counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model
architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity
MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training
CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale
FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale,
Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus
computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly
aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence.
Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for
advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built
upon the same base.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RAG的智能客服系统存在幻觉问题和机械式响应，这会带来业务风险并影响用户体验，特别是在Web客服交互场景中。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：Learn-to-Think阶段学习人类专家的推理过程和响应策略，Learn-to-Respond阶段结合冷启动监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)进行从基础到困难的自我精炼。

Result: 在工业级社交客服环境下的大规模在线A/B测试显示，在社区支持/直播互动场景中，智能解决率分别提升+28.92%/+18.42%，人工接管率分别降低-6.08%/-7.12%。

Conclusion: OlaMind框架能显著增强人类化程度和自然度，有效缓解幻觉和关键业务风险，在不同真实应用场景中表现一致有效。

Abstract: Intelligent customer service (ICS) systems via retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) have been widely adopted in Web-based domains such as social platforms
and e-commerce, achieving remarkable improvements in automation and efficiency.
However, notable limitations still remain: these systems are prone to
hallucinations and often generate rigid, mechanical responses, which can
introduce business risks and undermine user experience, especially in Web-based
customer service interactions under the RAG scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce OlaMind, a human-like and hallucination-safe customer service
framework for retrieval-augmented dialogue. Specifically, it first leverages a
Learn-to-Think stage to learn the reasoning processes and response strategies
from human experts, and then employs a Learn-to-Respond stage to perform
cold-start supervised fine-tuning (SFT) combined with reinforcement learning
(RL) for basic-to-hard self-refinement. Our method significantly enhances
human-likeness and naturalness while effectively mitigating hallucinations and
critical business risks. We have conducted large-scale online A/B experiments
in an industry-level social customer service setting, and extensive
experimental results show that OlaMind achieves significant cumulative relative
improvements with intelligent resolution rates +28.92%/+18.42% and human
takeover rate -6.08%/-7.12% in community-support/livestream-interaction
scenarios, respectively, which highlights its consistent effectiveness across
diverse real-world applications. The code and data will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了首个迈蒂利语可解释情感分析数据集，包含3,221个带情感极性和自然语言解释的句子，填补了低资源语言情感分析空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 迈蒂利语作为拥有1300万使用者的印度-雅利安语言，在自然语言处理研究中代表性不足，缺乏高质量情感分析资源，且现有资源缺乏可解释性机制。

Method: 构建了包含3,221个迈蒂利语句子的数据集，每个句子都标注了情感极性并配有自然语言解释，由语言专家精心策划和验证确保标签可靠性和上下文保真度。

Result: 使用经典机器学习和最先进transformer架构进行的广泛实验证明了该数据集在可解释情感分析方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为迈蒂利语建立了首个可解释情感计算基准，为多语言NLP和可解释AI的广泛发展贡献了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Developing benchmark datasets for low-resource languages poses significant
challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of native linguistic
experts and the substantial time and cost involved in annotation. Given these
challenges, Maithili is still underrepresented in natural language processing
research. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than 13 million people in
the Purvanchal region of India, valued for its rich linguistic structure and
cultural significance. While sentiment analysis has achieved remarkable
progress in high-resource languages, resources for low-resource languages, such
as Maithili, remain scarce, often restricted to coarse-grained annotations and
lacking interpretability mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel dataset comprising 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment
polarity and accompanied by natural language justifications. Moreover, the
dataset is carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure both
label reliability and contextual fidelity. Notably, the justifications are
written in Maithili, thereby promoting culturally grounded interpretation and
enhancing the explainability of sentiment models. Furthermore, extensive
experiments using both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art
transformer architectures demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for
interpretable sentiment analysis. Ultimately, this work establishes the first
benchmark for explainable affective computing in Maithili, thus contributing a
valuable resource to the broader advancement of multilingual NLP and
explainable AI.

TL;DR: DETECT是首个德语自动文本简化(ATS)专用评估指标，通过LLM生成合成质量分数训练，在简洁性、意义保留和流畅性三个维度上全面评估ATS质量，比现有通用指标与人类判断相关性更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前德语ATS评估依赖SARI、BLEU等通用指标，无法充分捕捉简化质量。虽然英语有LENS等专用指标，但德语缺乏人类标注语料库，导致相应研究滞后。

Method: 基于LENS框架适配德语，通过LLM生成合成质量分数创建数据集（无需人工标注），并加入LLM驱动的评分标准对齐步骤，构建了最大的德语人工评估数据集进行验证。

Result: DETECT在人类判断相关性上显著优于广泛使用的ATS指标，在意义保留和流畅性方面提升尤其明显。

Conclusion: DETECT填补了德语ATS评估空白，证明了LLM在自动评估中的潜力与局限，为通用语言可访问性任务提供了可迁移指南。

Abstract: Current evaluation of German automatic text simplification (ATS) relies on
general-purpose metrics such as SARI, BLEU, and BERTScore, which insufficiently
capture simplification quality in terms of simplicity, meaning preservation,
and fluency. While specialized metrics like LENS have been developed for
English, corresponding efforts for German have lagged behind due to the absence
of human-annotated corpora. To close this gap, we introduce DETECT, the first
German-specific metric that holistically evaluates ATS quality across all three
dimensions of simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency, and is trained
entirely on synthetic large language model (LLM) responses. Our approach adapts
the LENS framework to German and extends it with (i) a pipeline for generating
synthetic quality scores via LLMs, enabling dataset creation without human
annotation, and (ii) an LLM-based refinement step for aligning grading criteria
with simplification requirements. To the best of our knowledge, we also
construct the largest German human evaluation dataset for text simplification
to validate our metric directly. Experimental results show that DETECT achieves
substantially higher correlations with human judgments than widely used ATS
metrics, with particularly strong gains in meaning preservation and fluency.
Beyond ATS, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of
LLMs for automatic evaluation and provide transferable guidelines for general
language accessibility tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需真实标签的方法来测量LLM在成对文本比较中的输出错误率，支持均匀错误率和二元位置偏差两种场景，通过Copeland计数构建文本排名，在六个主流LLM上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要量化LLM在成对文本比较任务中的错误率，但传统方法依赖真实标签，因此开发不依赖真实标签的误差测量方法。

Method: 使用Copeland计数从成对偏好构建文本排名，支持两种误差场景：(i)均匀错误率，通过每个文本对两次比较估计；(ii)二元位置偏差，通过重复比较估计不同顺序的错误率。

Result: 在六个LLM上的实验显示，两个位置偏差项相似且接近均匀错误率，Claude在错误率和提示鲁棒性方面表现最佳，该方法优于有偏Bradley-Terry模型和交换性评分。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效测量LLM在成对比较中的错误率，Claude在此任务中表现最优，模型优于现有基准方法。

Abstract: We measure LLMs' output error at pairwise text comparison, noting the
probability of error in their preferences. Our method does not rely on the
ground truth and supports two scenarios: (i) uniform error rate regardless of
the order of comparison, estimated with two comparisons for each text pair with
either text placed first; (ii) binary positional bias assuming distinct error
rates for the two orders of comparison, estimated with repeated comparisons
between the texts. The Copeland counting constructs a ranking over the compared
texts from pairwise preferences; the ranking reveals the poor scalability of
LLM-based pairwise comparison and helps yield the estimates for LLMs' error
rates. We apply the method to six LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini,
Grok, Qwen) with five types of text input and obtain consistent estimates of
LLMs' error. In general, the measured two positional bias terms are similar,
close to the uniform error. Considering both the error rates and the robustness
to the variation of prompts, Claude obtained the most desirable performance in
this experiment. Our model outperforms the biased Bradley-Terry model and the
commutativity score in indicating LLMs' error at this task.

TL;DR: 本文分析了Swadesh方法在语言年代学中的局限性，指出即使所有基本假设都满足，数学上仍存在估计精度的固有界限。同时强调了词汇渐进修改过程对语言演变的重要性，并证明考虑这一过程能显著提高时间分离估计的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swadesh方法基于词汇替换的随机过程来估计语言间的时间分离，但其基本假设往往不现实，且存在各种污染现象和误判。更重要的是，即使假设完全满足，数学上仍存在估计精度的固有界限，这些概率性限制在词汇统计学研究中常被忽视。

Method: 通过数学分析详细探讨了Swadesh方法中词汇替换随机过程的概率性限制，同时引入了词汇渐进修改这一第二随机过程，从纯概率角度分析其对语言词汇演变的影响。

Result: 研究发现词汇渐进修改过程对语言词汇的重塑具有重要贡献，考虑这一过程能显著提高语言时间分离估计的精度。同时揭示了即使理想情况下，Swadesh方法在估计精度上仍存在数学上的固有界限。

Conclusion: 语言年代学研究需要同时考虑词汇替换和词汇渐进修改两个随机过程，这能显著提高时间分离估计的准确性。研究强调了概率性限制在词汇统计学中的重要性，为改进语言演化模型提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two
languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a
complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that
the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to
various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers,
variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments
of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means
that the results cannot be completely correct.
  More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are
satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the
temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely
probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical
studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.
  Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's
lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical
modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a
major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the
centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that
taking into account this second random process significantly increases the
precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进标准CoT提示方法，通过约束规则减少语义模糊和常识错误带来的推理错误。

Method: 提出"Sculpting"约束式提示方法，在GSM8K数学推理基准上评估三种提示策略（零样本、标准CoT、Sculpting）在三个OpenAI模型上的表现。

Result: 发现"提示反转"现象：Sculpting在gpt-4o上优于CoT（97% vs 93%），但在gpt-5上反而有害（94.00% vs 96.36%）。

Conclusion: 最优提示策略需要与模型能力共同进化，更强大的模型可能需要更简单的提示方法。

Abstract: Prompt engineering, particularly Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting,
significantly enhances LLM reasoning capabilities. We introduce "Sculpting," a
constrained, rule-based prompting method designed to improve upon standard CoT
by reducing errors from semantic ambiguity and flawed common sense.
  We evaluate three prompting strategies (Zero Shot, standard CoT, and
Sculpting) across three OpenAI model generations (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5)
using the GSM8K mathematical reasoning benchmark (1,317 problems).
  Our findings reveal a "Prompting Inversion": Sculpting provides advantages on
gpt-4o (97% vs. 93% for standard CoT), but becomes detrimental on gpt-5 (94.00%
vs. 96.36% for CoT on full benchmark). We trace this to a
"Guardrail-to-Handcuff" transition where constraints preventing common-sense
errors in mid-tier models induce hyper-literalism in advanced models. Our
detailed error analysis demonstrates that optimal prompting strategies must
co-evolve with model capabilities, suggesting simpler prompts for more capable
models.

Method: 基于因果推断理论，SteerX估计token级因果效应来识别偏好驱动token，将这些离散信号转化为连贯描述，然后用于引导个性化LLM生成。

Result: 在两个代表性引导骨干方法和真实数据集上的实验表明，SteerX持续提升引导向量质量。

Conclusion: SteerX通过关注真正偏好驱动的信息，为更有效的LLM个性化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in recent years,
enabling a wide range of applications, including intelligent assistants that
support users' daily life and work. A critical factor in building such
assistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely.
Activation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user
preference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a
cost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However,
existing methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector,
ignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines
the personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled
steering method that isolates preference-driven components from
preference-agnostic components. Grounded in causal inference theory, SteerX
estimates token-level causal effects to identify preference-driven tokens,
transforms these discrete signals into a coherent description, and then
leverages them to steer personalized LLM generation. By focusing on the truly
preference-driven information, SteerX produces more accurate activation
steering vectors and enhances personalization. Experiments on two
representative steering backbone methods across real-world datasets demonstrate
that SteerX consistently enhances steering vector quality, offering a practical
solution for more effective LLM personalization.

*Iliass Ayaou,Denis Cavallucci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了PatenTEB专利文本嵌入基准，包含15个任务和206万个样本，开发了patembed模型系列，在多个专利任务上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分捕捉专利特定挑战，需要专门的专利文本嵌入基准来支持专利检索、技术景观分析等应用。

Method: 构建PatenTEB基准，采用领域分层分割、领域特定困难负样本挖掘，并通过多任务训练开发patembed模型系列（67M-344M参数）。

Result: patembed-base在MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2上达到0.494 V-measure（之前最佳为0.445），patembed-large在DAPFAM上达到0.377 NDCG@100。

Conclusion: 多任务训练能提升外部泛化能力，领域预训练初始化在各类任务中均提供优势，所有资源将开源。

Abstract: Patent text embeddings enable prior art search, technology landscaping, and
patent analysis, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture patent-specific
challenges. We introduce PatenTEB, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 15
tasks across retrieval, classification, paraphrase, and clustering, with 2.06
million examples. PatenTEB employs domain-stratified splits, domain specific
hard negative mining, and systematic coverage of asymmetric
fragment-to-document matching scenarios absent from general embedding
benchmarks. We develop the patembed model family through multi-task training,
spanning 67M to 344M parameters with context lengths up to 4096 tokens.
External validation shows strong generalization: patembed-base achieves
state-of-the-art on MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2 (0.494 V-measure vs. 0.445
previous best), while patembed-large achieves 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM.
Systematic ablations reveal that multi-task training improves external
generalization despite minor benchmark costs, and that domain-pretrained
initialization provides consistent advantages across task families. All
resources will be made available at https://github.com/iliass-y/patenteb.

*Tu Anh Dinh,Philipp Nicolas Schumacher,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了如何通过整合大学课程材料（如讲义幻灯片和转录稿）来提升大型语言模型在计算机科学教育中的表现，比较了检索增强生成和持续预训练两种策略，发现RAG方法更有效，且多模态方法能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在教育应用中表现不佳，特别是在大学计算机科学课程中准确回答问题方面存在困难。研究旨在探索如何利用课程特定材料来增强模型性能。

Method: 比较了两种策略：检索增强生成（RAG）和持续预训练（CPT）。对于讲义幻灯片，还探索了多模态RAG方法，将检索内容以图像形式呈现给生成器。

Result: 实验表明，考虑到大学课程材料规模相对较小，RAG比CPT更有效且高效。此外，在多模态设置中将幻灯片作为图像整合，相比仅文本检索能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发更好地支持学习和教学的AI助手提供了实用策略，并希望激励其他教育背景下的类似努力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. One
application of LLMs is to support student learning in educational settings.
However, prior work has shown that LLMs still struggle to answer questions
accurately within university-level computer science courses. In this work, we
investigate how incorporating university course materials can enhance LLM
performance in this setting. A key challenge lies in leveraging diverse course
materials such as lecture slides and transcripts, which differ substantially
from typical textual corpora: slides also contain visual elements like images
and formulas, while transcripts contain spoken, less structured language. We
compare two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual
Pre-Training (CPT), to extend LLMs with course-specific knowledge. For lecture
slides, we further explore a multi-modal RAG approach, where we present the
retrieved content to the generator in image form. Our experiments reveal that,
given the relatively small size of university course materials, RAG is more
effective and efficient than CPT. Moreover, incorporating slides as images in
the multi-modal setting significantly improves performance over text-only
retrieval. These findings highlight practical strategies for developing AI
assistants that better support learning and teaching, and we hope they inspire
similar efforts in other educational contexts.

### [30] [Supervised Fine-Tuning or In-Context Learning? Evaluating LLMs for Clinical NER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22285)
*Andrei Baroian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较了BERT编码器、GPT-4o少样本学习和监督微调在临床命名实体识别任务上的表现，发现监督微调的GPT-4o效果最佳（F1≈87.1%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同方法在临床命名实体识别任务上的表现，特别是比较传统BERT模型与大型语言模型（GPT-4o）在不同设置下的效果。

Method: 使用CADEC语料库，比较三类方法：(i) BERT风格编码器（BERT Base、BioClinicalBERT、RoBERTa-large），(ii) GPT-4o少样本学习（简单vs复杂提示），(iii) GPT-4o监督微调。评估五种实体类型（ADR、药物、疾病、症状、发现）的标准NER指标。

Result: RoBERTa-large和BioClinicalBERT相比BERT Base改进有限；简单提示的少样本学习优于复杂提示；监督微调的GPT-4o表现最佳（F1≈87.1%），但成本更高；LLM在简化的二分类任务上准确率更高。

Conclusion: 监督微调的GPT-4o在临床NER任务上表现最优，但需权衡成本；简单提示在少样本学习中更有效；传统BERT模型改进空间有限；LLM在简化任务中表现更好。

Abstract: We study clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CADEC corpus and
compare three families of approaches: (i) BERT-style encoders (BERT Base,
BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large), (ii) GPT-4o used with few-shot in-context
learning (ICL) under simple vs.\ complex prompts, and (iii) GPT-4o with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). All models are evaluated on standard NER metrics
over CADEC's five entity types (ADR, Drug, Disease, Symptom, Finding).
RoBERTa-large and BioClinicalBERT offer limited improvements over BERT Base,
showing the limit of these family of models. Among LLM settings, simple ICL
outperforms a longer, instruction-heavy prompt, and SFT achieves the strongest
overall performance (F1 $\approx$ 87.1%), albeit with higher cost. We find that
the LLM achieve higher accuracy on simplified tasks, restricting classification
to two labels.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 寻求比深度神经网络语言建模更高效、更环保的替代方案，减少训练和推理过程中的生态足迹，同时保持性能。

Method: 实现基于内存的语言建模，使用k近邻分类的快速近似方法，完全依赖CPU运行，实现低延迟的令牌预测。

Result: OLIFANT实现与GPT-2和GPT-Neo相当的下一令牌预测准确率，同时显著降低排放并提高速度，模型内部机制完全透明。

Conclusion: 基于内存的语言建模是深度神经网络语言建模的可行环保替代方案，在保持性能的同时大幅减少生态影响，且具有更好的可解释性。

Abstract: We present memory-based language modeling as an efficient, eco-friendly
alternative to deep neural network-based language modeling. It offers
log-linearly scalable next-token prediction performance and strong memorization
capabilities. Implementing fast approximations of k-nearest neighbor
classification, memory-based language modeling leaves a relatively small
ecological footprint both in training and in inference mode, as it relies fully
on CPUs and attains low token latencies. Its internal workings are simple and
fully transparent. We compare our implementation of memory-based language
modeling, OLIFANT, with GPT-2 and GPT-Neo on next-token prediction accuracy,
estimated emissions and speeds, and offer some deeper analyses of the model.

### [32] [Multilingual Target-Stance Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22334)
*Ethan Mines,Bonnie Dorr*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个多语言目标立场提取（TSE）基准，涵盖6种语言，并展示了在无需为每种语言单独建模的情况下扩展TSE流程的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TSE研究仅限于英语，缺乏多语言环境下的基准和评估标准，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 将原始TSE流程扩展到多语言设置，使用统一模型处理多种语言，无需为每种语言单独训练模型。

Result: 模型在F1分数上达到12.78，表明多语言任务相比英语设置难度显著增加，目标预测是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 这项工作为多语言TSE提供了急需的基准资源、算法和评估标准，并首次证明了TSE的F1分数对目标表达方式的敏感性。

Abstract: Social media enables data-driven analysis of public opinion on contested
issues. Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) is the task of identifying the target
discussed in a document and the document's stance towards that target. Many
works classify stance towards a given target in a multilingual setting, but all
prior work in TSE is English-only. This work introduces the first multilingual
TSE benchmark, spanning Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and
Spanish corpora. It manages to extend the original TSE pipeline to a
multilingual setting without requiring separate models for each language. Our
model pipeline achieves a modest F1 score of 12.78, underscoring the increased
difficulty of the multilingual task relative to English-only setups and
highlighting target prediction as the primary bottleneck. We are also the first
to demonstrate the sensitivity of TSE's F1 score to different target
verbalizations. Together these serve as a much-needed baseline for resources,
algorithms, and evaluation criteria in multilingual TSE.

*Mohammad Aghajani Asl,Majid Asgari-Bidhendi,Behrooz Minaei-Bidgoli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FAIR-RAG是一个新型的代理框架，通过结构化证据评估和迭代优化循环来解决复杂多跳查询中的证据缺口问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG框架在处理需要从不同来源综合信息的复杂多跳查询时表现不佳，缺乏系统识别和填补证据缺口的机制，容易传播噪声或无法收集全面上下文。

Method: 引入FAIR-RAG框架，核心是结构化证据评估(SEA)模块，将查询分解为所需发现清单，审计聚合证据以识别确认事实和明确信息缺口，通过自适应查询优化代理生成针对性子查询来检索缺失信息。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHopQA和MusiQue等基准测试中，FAIR-RAG显著优于强基线。在HotpotQA上F1得分为0.453，比最强迭代基线绝对提升8.3分，建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 具有明确缺口分析的结构化、证据驱动的优化过程对于在复杂知识密集型任务中解锁高级RAG系统的可靠准确推理至关重要。

Abstract: While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination and
knowledge staleness in Large Language Models (LLMs), existing frameworks often
falter on complex, multi-hop queries that require synthesizing information from
disparate sources. Current advanced RAG methods, employing iterative or
adaptive strategies, lack a robust mechanism to systematically identify and
fill evidence gaps, often propagating noise or failing to gather a
comprehensive context. We introduce FAIR-RAG, a novel agentic framework that
transforms the standard RAG pipeline into a dynamic, evidence-driven reasoning
process. At its core is an Iterative Refinement Cycle governed by a module we
term Structured Evidence Assessment (SEA). The SEA acts as an analytical gating
mechanism: it deconstructs the initial query into a checklist of required
findings and audits the aggregated evidence to identify confirmed facts and,
critically, explicit informational gaps. These gaps provide a precise signal to
an Adaptive Query Refinement agent, which generates new, targeted sub-queries
to retrieve missing information. This cycle repeats until the evidence is
verified as sufficient, ensuring a comprehensive context for a final, strictly
faithful generation. We conducted experiments on challenging multi-hop QA
benchmarks, including HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MusiQue. In a unified
experimental setup, FAIR-RAG significantly outperforms strong baselines. On
HotpotQA, it achieves an F1-score of 0.453 -- an absolute improvement of 8.3
points over the strongest iterative baseline -- establishing a new
state-of-the-art for this class of methods on these benchmarks. Our work
demonstrates that a structured, evidence-driven refinement process with
explicit gap analysis is crucial for unlocking reliable and accurate reasoning
in advanced RAG systems for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks.

Abstract: Ironic identification is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing,
particularly when dealing with languages that differ in syntax and cultural
context. In this work, we aim to detect irony in Urdu by translating an English
Ironic Corpus into the Urdu language. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art machine

detection. Among machine learning models, Gradient Boosting achieved the best
performance with an F1-score of 89.18%. Among transformer-based models, LLaMA 3
(8B) achieved the highest performance with an F1-score of 94.61%. These results
demonstrate that combining transliteration techniques with modern NLP models
enables robust irony detection in Urdu, a historically low-resource language.

TL;DR: 提出了VisJudge-Bench，首个用于评估多模态大语言模型在可视化质量评估方面能力的综合基准，包含3090个专家标注样本。研究发现最先进的MLLMs与人类专家存在显著差距，为此设计了专门的可视化美学评估模型VisJudge，显著缩小了与人类判断的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化质量评估具有挑战性，需要同时判断数据编码准确性、信息表达性和视觉美学。虽然MLLMs在自然图像美学评估中表现出色，但缺乏系统基准来衡量其在可视化评估方面的能力。

Method: 构建VisJudge-Bench基准，包含3090个专家标注的真实场景样本，涵盖32种图表类型。提出VisJudge模型专门用于可视化美学和质量评估。

Result: 最先进的MLLMs（如GPT-5）与人类专家存在显著差距，MAE为0.551，与人类评分相关性仅0.429。VisJudge将MAE降至0.442（减少19.8%），与人类专家一致性提升至0.681（提高58.7%）。

Conclusion: VisJudge-Bench填补了可视化质量评估基准的空白，VisJudge模型显著提升了MLLMs在可视化美学评估方面的性能，但仍需进一步改进以完全匹配人类专家水平。

Abstract: Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an
effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value
depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and
aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is
challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across
data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics.
Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising
performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark
exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To
address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and
quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios,
covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across
32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most
advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human
experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551 and a
correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. To address this issue, we propose
VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and
quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge
significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.442 (a
19.8% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.681 (a
58.7% improvement) compared to GPT-5. The benchmark is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在科学领域中，大语言模型的幻觉会扭曲事实知识，而专业术语、统计推理和上下文依赖解释的存在进一步加剧了这些扭曲，特别是考虑到LLMs缺乏真正理解、上下文理解有限以及偏向表面泛化的偏见。

Method: CAP在跨语言环境中运作，涵盖5种高资源语言和4种低资源语言。数据集包含900个精选科学问题和来自16个公开可用模型的7000多个LLM生成答案，以问答对形式提供，包含标记序列和相应logits。

Conclusion: CAP公开发布，旨在促进幻觉检测、LLMs多语言评估以及开发更可靠的科学NLP系统的先进研究。

Abstract: We introduce the CAP (Confabulations from ACL Publications) dataset, a
multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in large language models
(LLMs) within scientific text generation. CAP focuses on the scientific domain,
where hallucinations can distort factual knowledge, as they frequently do. In
this domain, however, the presence of specialized terminology, statistical
reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations further exacerbates these
distortions, particularly given LLMs' lack of true comprehension, limited
contextual understanding, and bias toward surface-level generalization. CAP
operates in a cross-lingual setting covering five high-resource languages
(English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish) and four low-resource languages
(Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Telugu). The dataset comprises 900 curated
scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 publicly
available models, provided as question-answer pairs along with token sequences
and corresponding logits. Each instance is annotated with a binary label
indicating the presence of a scientific hallucination, denoted as a factuality
error, and a fluency label, capturing issues in the linguistic quality or
naturalness of the text. CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced
research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and the
development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.

TL;DR: CHOIR是一个测试时框架，通过协调多个角色条件下的推理信号来提升LLM推理的鲁棒性，无需额外训练即可显著改善性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将角色变化视为需要消除的偏差，但本文探索将其作为提升推理鲁棒性的建设性资源。

Method: 提出CHOIR框架，在反事实角色间进行协作解码，动态平衡推理路径中的一致性和分歧。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，CHOIR持续提升性能，个体人口群体改进高达26.4%，五个群体平均改进19.2%。

Conclusion: 通过将角色变化重新定义为建设性信号，CHOIR为更可靠的LLM推理提供了可扩展和可泛化的方法。

Abstract: Persona-assigned Large Language Models (LLMs) can adopt diverse roles,
enabling personalized and context-aware reasoning. However, even minor
demographic perturbations in personas, such as simple pronoun changes, can
alter reasoning trajectories, leading to divergent sets of correct answers.
Instead of treating these variations as biases to be mitigated, we explore
their potential as a constructive resource to improve reasoning robustness. We
propose CHOIR (Collaborative Harmonization fOr Inference Robustness), a
test-time framework that harmonizes multiple persona-conditioned reasoning
signals into a unified prediction. CHOIR orchestrates a collaborative decoding
process among counterfactual personas, dynamically balancing agreement and
divergence in their reasoning paths. Experiments on various reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that CHOIR consistently enhances performance across
demographics, model architectures, scales, and tasks - without additional
training. Improvements reach up to 26.4% for individual demographic groups and
19.2% on average across five demographics. It remains effective even when base
personas are suboptimal. By reframing persona variation as a constructive
signal, CHOIR provides a scalable and generalizable approach to more reliable
LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 传统上通过比较重建和声学语音学研究声调产生过程，本文旨在引入计算方法来量化音高在不同声调产生阶段的功能作用。

Method: 通过测量音高操作对自动语音识别性能的影响，分析一组密切相关的藏语方言对音高平坦化的敏感度。

Result: 发现声调产生连续谱：无音调安多方言最能容忍音高移除，完全音调卫藏方言显示严重性能下降，中间康方言处于二者之间。

Conclusion: 计算方法可以捕捉声音变化的细粒度阶段，传统基于最小对的功能负荷指标可能高估过渡系统中音高依赖性。

Abstract: Tonogenesis-the historical process by which segmental contrasts evolve into
lexical tone-has traditionally been studied through comparative reconstruction
and acoustic phonetics. We introduce a computational approach that quantifies
the functional role of pitch at different stages of this sound change by
measuring how pitch manipulation affects automatic speech recognition (ASR)
performance. Through analysis on the sensitivity to pitch-flattening from a set
of closely related Tibetan languages, we find evidence of a tonogenesis
continuum: atonal Amdo dialects tolerate pitch removal the most, while fully
tonal U-Tsang varieties show severe degradation, and intermediate Kham dialects
fall measurably between these extremes. These gradient effects demonstrate how
ASR models implicitly learn the shifting functional load of pitch as languages
transition from consonant-based to tone-based lexical contrasts. Our findings
show that computational methods can capture fine-grained stages of sound change
and suggest that traditional functional load metrics, based solely on minimal
pairs, may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems where
segmental and suprasegmental cues remain phonetically intertwined.

Abstract: Pruning provides a practical solution to reduce the resources required to run
large language models (LLMs) to benefit from their effective capabilities as
well as control their cost for training and inference. Research on LLM pruning
often ranks the importance of LLM parameters using their magnitudes and
calibration-data activations and removes (or masks) the less important ones,
accordingly reducing LLMs' size. However, these approaches primarily focus on
preserving the LLM's ability to generate fluent sentences, while neglecting
performance on specific domains and tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective pruning approach for LLMs that preserves task-specific
capabilities while shrinking their parameter space. We first analyze how
conventional pruning minimizes loss perturbation under general-domain
calibration and extend this formulation by incorporating task-specific feature
distributions into the importance computation of existing pruning algorithms.
Thus, our framework computes separate importance scores using both general and
task-specific calibration data, partitions parameters into shared and exclusive
groups based on activation-norm differences, and then fuses their scores to
guide the pruning process. This design enables our method to integrate
seamlessly with various foundation pruning techniques and preserve the LLM's
specialized abilities under compression. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach is effective and consistently outperforms the
baselines with identical pruning ratios and different settings.

### [41] [The Limits of Data Scaling: Sub-token Utilization and Acoustic Saturation in Multilingual ASR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22492)
*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 分析多语言ASR模型Whisper在49种语言中的解码行为，发现子词令牌的发现模式与预训练数据量无关，而是遵循一致的指数饱和模式，提出了声学饱和时间(AST)概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言ASR模型学习到的子词令牌库在不同语言中的观察需求，以及预训练数据差异是否影响这些令牌在推理时的使用。

Method: 通过记录Whisper模型在49种语言推理时的解码候选子词，跟踪它们随时间的累积发现模式，分析子词空间的利用模式。

Result: 发现子词令牌总数与语言预训练小时数无关，子词发现率遵循一致的指数饱和模式，拉丁文字语言比西里尔、CJK和闪米特文字语言表现更好。

Conclusion: 多语言ASR推理中的子词利用更多受语音的统计、类型学和正字法结构约束，而非训练数据规模，为更公平的语料构建和跨语言评估提供了实证基础。

Abstract: How much audio is needed to fully observe a multilingual ASR model's learned
sub-token inventory across languages, and does data disparity in multilingual
pre-training affect how these tokens are utilized during inference? We address
this question by analyzing Whisper's decoding behavior during inference across
49 languages. By logging decoding candidate sub-tokens and tracking their
cumulative discovery over time, we study the utilization pattern of the model's
sub-token space. Results show that the total number of discovered tokens
remains largely independent of a language's pre-training hours, indicating that
data disparity does not strongly influence lexical diversity in the model's
hypothesis space. Sub-token discovery rates follow a consistent exponential
saturation pattern across languages, suggesting a stable time window after
which additional audio yields minimal new sub-token activation. We refer to
this convergence threshold as acoustic saturation time (AST). Further analyses
of rank-frequency distributions reveal Zipf-like patterns better modeled by a
Zipf-Mandelbrot law, and mean sub-token length shows a positive correlation
with resource level. Additionally, those metrics show more favorable patterns
for languages in the Latin script than those in scripts such as Cyrillic, CJK,
and Semitic. Together, our study suggests that sub-token utilization during
multilingual ASR inference is constrained more by the statistical, typological,
and orthographic structure of the speech than by training data scale, providing
an empirical basis for more equitable corpus construction and cross-lingual
evaluation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对四个主要商业ASR系统的种族偏见进行系统评估，发现语音质量变异是偏见的主要来源，特别是非洲裔美国人在所有系统中表现最差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估商业自动语音识别系统中存在的种族偏见，分析不同种族背景说话者的转录准确性差异。

Method: 使用太平洋西北英语语料库，分析四个种族背景说话者的转录准确性，引入语音错误率指标，分析11个社会语音特征。

Result: 发现元音质量变异与不同种族群体的错误率差异相关，非洲裔美国人在所有评估系统中表现最差。

Conclusion: 方言语音变异的声学建模是商业ASR系统偏见的主要来源，需要通过在训练数据中针对性表示社会语音多样性来改进ASR性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of racial bias in four major
commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using the Pacific
Northwest English (PNWE) corpus. We analyze transcription accuracy across
speakers from four ethnic backgrounds (African American, Caucasian American,
ChicanX, and Yakama) and examine how sociophonetic variation contributes to
differential system performance. We introduce a heuristically-determined
Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric that links recognition errors to specific
linguistically motivated variables derived from sociophonetic annotation. Our
analysis of eleven sociophonetic features reveals that vowel quality variation,
particularly resistance to the low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns,
is systematically associated with differential error rates across ethnic
groups, with the most pronounced effects for African American speakers across
all evaluated systems. These findings demonstrate that acoustic modeling of
dialectal phonetic variation, rather than lexical or syntactic factors, remains
a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems. The study establishes the
PNWE corpus as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies
and provides actionable guidance for improving ASR performance through targeted
representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data.

*Noshitha Padma Pratyusha Juttu,Sahithi Singireddy,Sravani Gona,Sujal Timilsina*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了在服务条款不公平条款检测任务中，全量微调、参数高效适配（LoRA、QLoRA）和零样本提示三种策略的性能表现，发现全量微调效果最佳，而LoRA方法在显著降低内存成本的同时保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本理解方面表现出色，但在专业法律领域的适应仍受限于全量微调的高昂成本，需要探索更高效的适配方法。

Method: 在CLAUDETTE-ToS基准和多语言爬虫语料库上，对BERT、DistilBERT进行全量微调，对TinyLlama、LLaMA 3B/7B、SaulLM应用4位低秩适配（LoRA），并评估GPT-4o及其变体的零样本性能。

Result: 全量微调在精确率-召回率平衡方面表现最强，而基于LoRA的模型在内存成本降低高达3倍的情况下仍能提供有竞争力的召回率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了高效领域适配LLMs的实际设计权衡，为法律文本处理中的微调研究提供了开放基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text understanding, yet their
adaptation to specialized legal domains remains constrained by the cost of full
fine-tuning. This study provides a systematic evaluation of fine tuning,
parameter efficient adaptation (LoRA, QLoRA), and zero-shot prompting
strategies for unfair clause detection in Terms of Service (ToS) documents, a
key application in legal NLP. We finetune BERT and DistilBERT, apply 4-bit
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to models such as TinyLlama, LLaMA 3B/7B, and
SaulLM, and evaluate GPT-4o and O-versions in zero-shot settings. Experiments
on the CLAUDETTE-ToS benchmark and the Multilingual Scraper Corpus show that
full fine-tuning achieves the strongest precision recall balance, while
LoRA-based models provide competitive recall with up to 3x lower memory cost.
These findings highlight practical design trade-offs for efficient and
domain-adapted LLMs, contributing open baselines for fine-tuning research in
legal text processing.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LooGLE v2是一个评估大语言模型在真实世界长上下文应用中能力的基准测试，包含16k到2M tokens的文本，涵盖法律、金融、游戏和代码领域，设计了10种长依赖任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型虽然拥有扩展的上下文窗口，但在长依赖任务上的理解能力仍然有限且研究不足，特别是在许多真实世界长上下文应用中缺乏基准测试。

Method: 自动收集真实世界长文本，精心设计10种领域特定的长依赖任务，通过可扩展的数据处理流程生成1,934个多样化QA实例，评估了6个本地部署和4个API-based的LLM。

Result: 评估结果显示，即使在最佳性能的模型上，总体得分也仅为59.2%。流行的LLM实际能理解的上下文长度远低于其声称的能力，在处理真实世界长依赖任务时存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 尽管拥有广泛的上下文窗口，大语言模型在实际长上下文理解能力方面仍有很大改进空间，揭示了它们在处理真实世界长依赖任务时的重大局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with increasingly extended context
windows recently, yet their long context understanding capabilities over long
dependency tasks remain fundamentally limited and underexplored. This gap is
especially significant in many real-world long-context applications that were
rarely benchmarked. In this paper, we introduce LooGLE v2, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs' long context ability in real-world applications and
scenarios. Our benchmark consists of automatically collected real-world long
texts, ranging from 16k to 2M tokens, encompassing domains in law, finance,
game and code. Accordingly, we delicately design 10 types of domain-specific
long-dependency tasks and generate 1,934 QA instances with various diversity
and complexity in a scalable data curation pipeline for further practical
needs. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of 6 locally deployed and 4
API-based LLMs. The evaluation results show that even the best-performing model
achieves only a 59.2% overall score on our benchmark. Despite the extensive
context windows, popular LLMs are only capable of understanding a much shorter
length of context than they claim to be, revealing significant limitations in
their ability to handle real-world tasks with long dependencies and
highlighting substantial room for model improvement in practical long-context
understanding.

*Jinhan Chen,Jianchun Liu,Hongli Xu,Xianjun Gao,Shilong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SABlock是一个语义感知的KV缓存驱逐框架，通过自适应块大小来平衡语义连贯性和内存效率，显著减少长上下文LLM推理中的内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存不断增长的内存占用成为长上下文LLM推理的可扩展性瓶颈，现有压缩方法难以平衡语义连贯性和内存效率。

Method: 首先进行语义分割对齐压缩边界与语言结构，然后应用分段引导的令牌评分来优化令牌重要性估计，最后通过预算驱动的搜索策略自适应确定最优块大小。

Result: 在相同内存预算下，SABlock持续优于最先进的基线方法。在NIAH测试中，仅用96个KV条目就达到99.9%检索准确率，接近保留8K条目的全缓存性能。在1024固定缓存预算下，峰值内存使用减少46.28%，解码速度提升9.5倍。

Conclusion: SABlock通过语义感知的自适应块大小策略，有效解决了长上下文LLM推理中的KV缓存内存瓶颈问题，在保持语义完整性的同时显著提升了压缩效率。

Abstract: The growing memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache poses a severe
scalability bottleneck for long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less
critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression
methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this
end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction
framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically,
SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries
with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine
token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search
strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic
integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget.
Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory
budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9%
retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of
the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache
budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and
achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.

TL;DR: 提出EduLoop-Agent端到端个性化学习代理，整合神经认知诊断模型、自适应测试策略和大语言模型，形成诊断-推荐-反馈闭环框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法孤立处理建模、题目选择和反馈，导致学生模型粗糙、适应性受限且反馈不具操作性。需要构建闭环系统实现真正个性化学习。

Method: 使用神经认知诊断模型(NCD)进行细粒度知识掌握度评估，BECAT策略动态选择题目，大语言模型(LLMs)生成结构化反馈，形成诊断-推荐-反馈闭环。

Result: 在ASSISTments数据集上，NCD模块在响应预测和可解释掌握度评估方面表现优异，自适应推荐提高题目相关性和个性化，LLM反馈提供针对性学习指导。

Conclusion: 该设计有效且可实际部署，为智能教育中生成个性化学习路径提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As information technology advances, education is moving from
one-size-fits-all instruction toward personalized learning. However, most
methods handle modeling, item selection, and feedback in isolation rather than
as a closed loop. This leads to coarse or opaque student models,
assumption-bound adaptivity that ignores diagnostic posteriors, and generic,
non-actionable feedback. To address these limitations, this paper presents an
end-to-end personalized learning agent, EduLoop-Agent, which integrates a
Neural Cognitive Diagnosis model (NCD), a Bounded-Ability Estimation
Computerized Adaptive Testing strategy (BECAT), and large language models
(LLMs). The NCD module provides fine-grained estimates of students' mastery at
the knowledge-point level; BECAT dynamically selects subsequent items to
maximize relevance and learning efficiency; and LLMs convert diagnostic signals
into structured, actionable feedback. Together, these components form a
closed-loop framework of ``Diagnosis--Recommendation--Feedback.'' Experiments
on the ASSISTments dataset show that the NCD module achieves strong performance
on response prediction while yielding interpretable mastery assessments. The
adaptive recommendation strategy improves item relevance and personalization,
and the LLM-based feedback offers targeted study guidance aligned with
identified weaknesses. Overall, the results indicate that the proposed design
is effective and practically deployable, providing a feasible pathway to
generating individualized learning trajectories in intelligent education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI和大型语言模型的成功加速了智能辅导系统的发展，但这些系统的进展和影响难以追踪，因为缺乏可靠、教育理论驱动的评估框架和基准。

Method: 通过回顾现有评估实践，分析实际案例研究，并基于跨学科AI教育研究的见解，提出实用的研究方向。

Result: 识别了当前ITS评估中的不一致性和有限泛化性问题，强调了标准化评估方法的重要性。

Conclusion: 提出了三个基于学习科学原理的实用研究方向，旨在建立公平、统一且可扩展的智能辅导系统评估方法。

Abstract: The interdisciplinary research domain of Artificial Intelligence in Education
(AIED) has a long history of developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) by
integrating insights from technological advancements, educational theories, and
cognitive psychology. The remarkable success of generative AI (GenAI) models
has accelerated the development of large language model (LLM)-powered ITSs,
which have potential to imitate human-like, pedagogically rich, and cognitively
demanding tutoring. However, the progress and impact of these systems remain
largely untraceable due to the absence of reliable, universally accepted, and
pedagogy-driven evaluation frameworks and benchmarks. Most existing educational
dialogue-based ITS evaluations rely on subjective protocols and
non-standardized benchmarks, leading to inconsistencies and limited
generalizability. In this work, we take a step back from mainstream ITS
development and provide comprehensive state-of-the-art evaluation practices,
highlighting associated challenges through real-world case studies from careful
and caring AIED research. Finally, building on insights from previous
interdisciplinary AIED research, we propose three practical, feasible, and
theoretically grounded research directions, rooted in learning science
principles and aimed at establishing fair, unified, and scalable evaluation
methodologies for ITSs.

TL;DR: AutoBench是一个完全自动化和自我维持的框架，通过相互同行评估来评估大型语言模型。它动态生成新颖评估任务，模型轮流担任问题生成者、参赛者和评委，采用迭代加权机制聚合同行判断，形成基于共识的排名。


<details>

Motivation: 传统静态基准存在测试集污染和适应性有限的问题，需要一种能够持续评估不断发展的语言模型的污染抵抗替代方案。

Method: AutoBench采用多评委设计，模型在多样化领域中交替担任问题生成者、参赛者和评委，通过迭代加权机制放大可靠评估者的影响力，将同行判断聚合成基于共识的排名。

Result: 实验显示与MMLU-Pro和GPQA基准有强相关性（分别为78%和63%），多评委设计显著优于单评委基线，分布式评估产生更稳健和人类一致的评估。

Conclusion: AutoBench为持续评估演进的语言模型提供了一个可扩展、抗污染的静态基准替代方案，验证了同行驱动评估范式的有效性。

Abstract: We present AutoBench, a fully automated and self-sustaining framework for
evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) through reciprocal peer assessment.
This paper provides a rigorous scientific validation of the AutoBench
methodology, originally developed as an open-source project by eZecute S.R.L..
Unlike static benchmarks that suffer from test-set contamination and limited
adaptability, AutoBench dynamically generates novel evaluation tasks while
models alternately serve as question generators, contestants, and judges across
diverse domains. An iterative weighting mechanism amplifies the influence of
consistently reliable evaluators, aggregating peer judgments into
consensus-based rankings that reflect collective model agreement. Our
experiments demonstrate strong correlations with established benchmarks
including MMLU-Pro and GPQA (respectively 78\% and 63\%), validating this
peer-driven evaluation paradigm. The multi-judge design significantly
outperforms single-judge baselines, confirming that distributed evaluation
produces more robust and human-consistent assessments. AutoBench offers a
scalable, contamination-resistant alternative to static benchmarks for the
continuous evaluation of evolving language models.

Conclusion: PCU不仅改善个人健康结果，还为公共卫生和科学发现提供新基础，代表了从间歇性护理向持续健康指导的范式转变。

Abstract: Building on decades of success in digital infrastructure and biomedical
innovation, we propose the Personal Care Utility (PCU) - a cybernetic system
for lifelong health guidance. PCU is conceived as a global, AI-powered utility
that continuously orchestrates multimodal data, knowledge, and services to
assist individuals and populations alike. Drawing on multimodal agents,
event-centric modeling, and contextual inference, it offers three essential
capabilities: (1) trusted health information tailored to the individual, (2)
proactive health navigation and behavior guidance, and (3) ongoing
interpretation of recovery and treatment response after medical events. Unlike
conventional episodic care, PCU functions as an ambient, adaptive companion -
observing, interpreting, and guiding health in real time across daily life. By
integrating personal sensing, experiential computing, and population-level
analytics, PCU promises not only improved outcomes for individuals but also a
new substrate for public health and scientific discovery. We describe the
architecture, design principles, and implementation challenges of this emerging
paradigm.

Motivation: 填补波斯语常识推理基准的空白，为波斯语自然语言处理提供评估标准。

Method: 使用连接词分割策略生成句子对，提出DRESS-AF（基于嵌入相似性评分和对抗性过滤的干扰项排序）方法来选择干扰项。

Result: 人类标注者准确率89%，OpenAI-o3达到最高92.18%，Claude-Sonnet-3.7为91.17%，最强开源模型DeepSeek-R1为82.51%。DRESS-AF方法在英语HellaSwag基准上也有效。

Conclusion: PerCoR是一个具有挑战性的波斯语常识推理基准，显示了当前模型在波斯语常识推理方面的性能差距，DRESS-AF方法具有可迁移性。

Abstract: We introduced PerCoR (Persian Commonsense Reasoning), the first large-scale
Persian benchmark for commonsense reasoning. PerCoR contains 106K
multiple-choice sentence-completion problems drawn from more than forty news,
cultural, and other web sources. We introduce a novel conjunction-based
segmentation strategy to generate coherent sentence-completion pairs, enabling
broad topical and structural diversity. To create challenging distractors, we
propose DRESS-AF (Distractor Ranking via Embedding Similarity Scoring and
Adversarial Filtering), a generation-free adversarial filtering method that
selects distractors from the pool of gold continuations while maximising model
confusion. Human annotators score 89% on PerCoR, while OpenAI-o3 achieves the
highest performance at 92.18%, followed closely by Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (91.17%).
The strongest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, reaches 82.51%, underscoring both
the dataset's difficulty and the remaining performance gap in Persian
commonsense reasoning. We further show that DRESS-AF transfers to the English
HellaSwag benchmark, increasing its difficulty without hurting human
solvability. The dataset is available at

to preserve endangered languages through documentation. This paper is a part of
a project which aims to develop a trilingual (Toto-Bangla-English) language
learning application to digitally archive and promote the endangered Toto
language of West Bengal, India. This application, designed for both native Toto
speakers and non-native learners, aims to revitalize the language by ensuring
accessibility and usability through Unicode script integration and a structured
language corpus. The research includes detailed linguistic documentation
collected via fieldwork, followed by the creation of a morpheme-tagged,
trilingual corpus used to train a Small Language Model (SLM) and a
Transformer-based translation engine. The analysis covers inflectional
morphology such as person-number-gender agreement, tense-aspect-mood
distinctions, and case marking, alongside derivational strategies that reflect
word-class changes. Script standardization and digital literacy tools were also
developed to enhance script usage. The study offers a sustainable model for
preserving endangered languages by incorporating traditional linguistic
methodology with AI. This bridge between linguistic research with technological
innovation highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration for
community-based language revitalization.

Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉复杂关系模式并缓解数据稀疏性，特别是在处理长尾分布挑战时表现不佳。

Method: 使用邻域聚合编码器整合高阶邻居信息，共轭关系学习器结合隐式条件扩散关系模块和稳定关系模块来捕捉稳定语义和不确定性偏移，以及流形共轭解码器在流形空间中高效评估和推断缺失三元组。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CR-FKGC框架通过共轭关系建模有效解决了FKGC中的关键挑战，实现了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC) infers missing triples from
limited support samples, tackling long-tail distribution challenges. Existing
methods, however, struggle to capture complex relational patterns and mitigate
data sparsity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel FKGC framework
for conjugate relation modeling (CR-FKGC). Specifically, it employs a
neighborhood aggregation encoder to integrate higher-order neighbor
information, a conjugate relation learner combining an implicit conditional
diffusion relation module with a stable relation module to capture stable
semantics and uncertainty offsets, and a manifold conjugate decoder for
efficient evaluation and inference of missing triples in manifold space.
Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个用于解释检索增强生成(RAG)大语言模型(LLM)的规则生成方法，通过分析检索源对输出的影响来生成if-then规则，并设计了优化算法提高规则生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着检索增强生成(RAG)在LLM中的广泛应用，需要解释模型如何利用检索信息源来生成输出。现有的规则解释方法主要针对传统机器学习模型，缺乏专门针对RAG-LLM系统的解释方案。

Method: 提出通过探测LLM在不同检索源组合下的输出来生成规则，采用受Apriori算法启发的剪枝优化策略，避免对所有可能的源组合进行暴力搜索，从而提高规则生成效率。

Result: 通过定性和定量实验验证了所提解决方案的价值和效率，能够有效识别检索源与LLM输出之间的因果关系。

Conclusion: 该方法为RAG-LLM系统提供了有效的可解释性工具，通过生成if-then规则揭示了检索信息源对模型决策的影响，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: If-then rules are widely used to explain machine learning models; e.g., "if
employed = no, then loan application = rejected." We present the first proposal
to apply rules to explain the emerging class of large language models (LLMs)
with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Since RAG enables LLM systems to
incorporate retrieved information sources at inference time, rules linking the
presence or absence of sources can explain output provenance; e.g., "if a Times
Higher Education ranking article is retrieved, then the LLM ranks Oxford
first." To generate such rules, a brute force approach would probe the LLM with
all source combinations and check if the presence or absence of any sources
leads to the same output. We propose optimizations to speed up rule generation,
inspired by Apriori-like pruning from frequent itemset mining but redefined
within the scope of our novel problem. We conclude with qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrating our solutions' value and efficiency.

*Ruslan Berdichevsky,Shai Nahum-Gefen,Elad Ben Zaken*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SALSA是一种结合结构化提示、类到令牌映射和参数高效微调的文本分类方法，避免冷启动训练，在单次前向传播中实现高效准确的分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管指令调优的大型语言模型具有强大的泛化能力，但在文本分类基准测试中表现不佳，需要改进分类性能。

Method: 将每个类别标签映射到不同的输出令牌，构建提示以引出单令牌响应，在推理时仅将模型输出投影到相关类别令牌的logits上。

Result: SALSA在多个基准测试中达到了最先进的结果，证明了其在基于LLM的分类应用中的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: SALSA提供了一种高效准确的LLM文本分类解决方案，通过结构化提示和参数高效微调显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generalization capabilities, instruction-tuned Large
Language Models often underperform on text classification benchmarks. We
introduce SALSA, a coherent pipeline that combines structured prompting,
class-to-token mapping, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, thereby avoiding
cold-start training. Each class label is mapped to a distinct output token, and
prompts are constructed to elicit a single-token response. During inference,
the model's output is projected only onto the logits of the relevant class
tokens, enabling efficient and accurate classification in a single forward
pass. SALSA achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks,
demonstrating its robustness and scalability for LLM-based classification
applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: E^2Rank是一个统一的嵌入排序框架，通过列表排序目标继续训练单个文本嵌入模型，实现高质量检索和列表重排序，在保持效率的同时显著提升重排序性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本嵌入模型在搜索应用中检索效率高但排序保真度有限，特别是与基于LLM的列表重排序器相比，后者能捕捉细粒度的查询-文档和文档-文档交互。

Method: 提出E^2Rank框架，使用查询和文档嵌入的余弦相似度作为统一排序函数，构建包含原始查询和候选文档的列表排序提示，类似于传统检索模型中的伪相关反馈。

Result: 在BEIR重排序基准上达到最先进结果，在BRIGHT推理密集型基准上表现有竞争力，重排序延迟很低，同时在MTEB基准上提升嵌入性能。

Conclusion: 单个嵌入模型可以有效统一检索和重排序，提供计算效率和竞争性排序精度的平衡。

Abstract: Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search
applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space,
they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However,
their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers,
especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained
query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient
Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single
text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise
reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective,
thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying
cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified
ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the
original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query
enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance
feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the
efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while
significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically,
$\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR
reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the
reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also
show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the
MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can
effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational
efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在有限数据和计算预算下，使用持续预训练（CPT）和低秩适应（LoRA）技术将大型语言模型适配到魁北克法语方言，实现了在少数方言基准上的性能提升，同时主流语言基准回归最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的能力主要集中在高资源语言上，而低资源方言缺乏足够的训练数据。研究旨在通过参数高效微调方法，为少数语言社区提供高质量LLM访问。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）和计算高效的持续预训练，在非常小的数据集上适配三个LLM到魁北克法语方言，并在COLE套件上进行基准测试。

Result: 实验显示在少数方言基准上有所改进，主流语言基准回归最小（仅更新不到1%的模型参数），且效果高度依赖于语料库组成。

Conclusion: CPT与PEFT结合可以缩小方言差距，为少数语言社区提供成本效益高且可持续的语言资源创建方案，并发布了首个魁北克法语LLM。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), their
strongest capabilities remain largely confined to a small number of
high-resource languages for which there is abundant training data. Recently,
continual pre-training (CPT) has emerged as a means to fine-tune these models
to low-resource regional dialects. In this paper, we study the use of CPT for
dialect learning under tight data and compute budgets. Using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient continual pre-training, we adapt three
LLMs to the Qu\'ebec French dialect using a very small dataset and benchmark
them on the COLE suite. Our experiments demonstrate an improvement on the
minority dialect benchmarks with minimal regression on the prestige language
benchmarks with under 1% of model parameters updated. Analysis of the results
demonstrate that gains are highly contingent on corpus composition. These
findings indicate that CPT with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can
narrow the dialect gap by providing cost-effective and sustainable language
resource creation, expanding high-quality LLM access to minority linguistic
communities. We release the first Qu\'ebec French LLMs on HuggingFace.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型如何基于时间和语义关系检索上下文信息，类似于人类情景记忆的时间分离机制。

Method: 通过固定重复token位置并置换其他token，消除语义干扰，隔离时间效应对下一个token预测的影响。使用包括transformer和状态空间模型在内的多种预训练LLM进行实验。

Result: 模型始终对重复token后的token赋予最高概率，但存在对输入序列开头或结尾附近token的明显偏好。transformer中的归纳头是这一现象的关键机制。

Conclusion: 研究加深了对上下文学习中时间偏差的理解，展示了这些偏差如何实现时间分离和情景检索，transformer和状态空间模型表现出相似的时间偏差模式。

Abstract: In-context learning is governed by both temporal and semantic relationships,
shaping how Large Language Models (LLMs) retrieve contextual information.
Analogous to human episodic memory, where the retrieval of specific events is
enabled by separating events that happened at different times, this work probes
the ability of various pretrained LLMs, including transformer and state-space
models, to differentiate and retrieve temporally separated events.
Specifically, we prompted models with sequences containing multiple
presentations of the same token, which reappears at the sequence end. By fixing
the positions of these repeated tokens and permuting all others, we removed
semantic confounds and isolated temporal effects on next-token prediction.
Across diverse sequences, models consistently placed the highest probabilities
on tokens following a repeated token, but with a notable bias for those nearest
the beginning or end of the input. An ablation experiment linked this
phenomenon in transformers to induction heads. Extending the analysis to unique
semantic contexts with partial overlap further demonstrated that memories
embedded in the middle of a prompt are retrieved less reliably. Despite
architectural differences, state-space and transformer models showed comparable
temporal biases. Our findings deepen the understanding of temporal biases in
in-context learning and offer an illustration of how these biases can enable
temporal separation and episodic retrieval.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EchoMind是首个多层级、相互关联的基准测试，通过顺序任务模拟共情对话的认知过程，评估语音语言模型在理解口语内容、感知声音线索、综合推理和生成回应方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估语言、声学、推理或对话能力，忽视了这些技能整合对于实现类人、情感智能对话的重要性。需要评估SLMs是否能完全感知非词汇声音线索并生成符合情感和语境因素的共情回应。

Method: 设计EchoMind基准测试，包含顺序的语境关联任务：口语内容理解、声音线索感知、综合推理和回应生成。所有任务使用相同的中性脚本，通过控制声音风格变化来测试独立于文本内容的传递效果。基于包含3个粗粒度和12个细粒度维度的共情导向框架，涵盖39个声音属性。

Result: 测试12个先进SLMs显示，即使最先进的模型在处理高表达性声音线索方面也存在困难，限制了共情回应质量。在指令遵循、对自然语音变化的适应能力以及有效利用声音线索实现共情方面存在持续弱点。

Conclusion: 结果强调需要开发能够整合语言内容与多样化声音线索的SLMs，以实现真正的共情对话能力。

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) have made significant progress in spoken
language understanding. Yet it remains unclear whether they can fully perceive
non lexical vocal cues alongside spoken words, and respond with empathy that
aligns with both emotional and contextual factors. Existing benchmarks
typically evaluate linguistic, acoustic, reasoning, or dialogue abilities in
isolation, overlooking the integration of these skills that is crucial for
human-like, emotionally intelligent conversation. We present EchoMind, the
first interrelated, multi-level benchmark that simulates the cognitive process
of empathetic dialogue through sequential, context-linked tasks: spoken-content
understanding, vocal-cue perception, integrated reasoning, and response
generation. All tasks share identical and semantically neutral scripts that are
free of explicit emotional or contextual cues, and controlled variations in
vocal style are used to test the effect of delivery independent of the
transcript. EchoMind is grounded in an empathy-oriented framework spanning 3
coarse and 12 fine-grained dimensions, encompassing 39 vocal attributes, and
evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics. Testing 12 advanced SLMs
reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle with high-expressive vocal
cues, limiting empathetic response quality. Analyses of prompt strength, speech
source, and ideal vocal cue recognition reveal persistent weaknesses in
instruction-following, resilience to natural speech variability, and effective
use of vocal cues for empathy. These results underscore the need for SLMs that
integrate linguistic content with diverse vocal cues to achieve truly
empathetic conversational ability.

TL;DR: MMPersuade是一个研究大型视觉语言模型在多模态说服情境中表现的系统框架，包括数据集和评估方法，揭示了多模态输入显著增强说服效果、先验偏好降低易感性等关键发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LVLMs在购物、健康、新闻等领域的部署，它们面临大量说服性内容。理解模型如何被多模态说服输入影响至关重要，因为过度易受影响的模型可能采纳误导性信念、覆盖用户偏好或生成不道德输出。

Method: 提出MMPersuade框架，包含：(1) 包含图像和视频的多模态数据集，涵盖商业、主观行为、对抗性情境的说服原则；(2) 通过第三方协议评分和自估计token概率评估说服效果和模型易感性的评估框架。

Result: 对六个领先LVLMs的研究发现：(1) 多模态输入显著增强说服效果，特别是在错误信息场景；(2) 先验偏好降低易感性，但多模态信息仍保持说服优势；(3) 不同策略在不同情境中效果各异，互惠在商业和主观情境最有效，可信度和逻辑在对抗情境中占优。

Conclusion: MMPersuade通过联合分析说服效果和易感性，为开发在面对说服性多模态内容时具有鲁棒性、偏好一致性和伦理对齐的模型提供了原则性基础。

Abstract: As Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains
such as shopping, health, and news, they are exposed to pervasive persuasive
content. A critical question is how these models function as persuadees-how and
why they can be influenced by persuasive multimodal inputs. Understanding both
their susceptibility to persuasion and the effectiveness of different
persuasive strategies is crucial, as overly persuadable models may adopt
misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical or unsafe
outputs when exposed to manipulative messages. We introduce MMPersuade, a
unified framework for systematically studying multimodal persuasion dynamics in
LVLMs. MMPersuade contributes (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset that pairs
images and videos with established persuasion principles across commercial,
subjective and behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation
framework that quantifies both persuasion effectiveness and model
susceptibility via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token
probabilities on conversation histories. Our study of six leading LVLMs as
persuadees yields three key insights: (i) multimodal inputs substantially
increase persuasion effectiveness-and model susceptibility-compared to text
alone, especially in misinformation scenarios; (ii) stated prior preferences
decrease susceptibility, yet multimodal information maintains its persuasive
advantage; and (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across
contexts, with reciprocity being most potent in commercial and subjective
contexts, and credibility and logic prevailing in adversarial contexts. By
jointly analyzing persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility, MMPersuade
provides a principled foundation for developing models that are robust,
preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive
multimodal content.

TL;DR: R4P是一个通过推理为软件工程代理提供可扩展奖励的补丁验证模型，解决了传统基于测试监督方法的可扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于测试的监督方法存在可扩展性限制：测试沙箱构建运行成本高且脆弱，高覆盖率测试数据稀缺且易受边缘案例测试攻击。

Method: R4P将补丁验证视为推理任务，采用分组目标进行强化学习训练，通过比较多个补丁的修改来获得密集奖励。

Result: R4P在SWE-bench-verified上达到72.2%的补丁验证准确率，比OpenAI o3更优。基于R4P训练的Mini-SE在SWE-bench-verified上达到26.2% Pass@1，比原Qwen3-32B提升10.0%。

Conclusion: R4P提供了一种高效、可扩展的补丁验证方法，验证速度比传统测试快50倍，奖励和准确率的稳定扩展曲线证明了其实用性。

Abstract: While large language model agents have advanced software engineering tasks,
the unscalable nature of existing test-based supervision is limiting the
potential improvement of data scaling. The reason is twofold: (1) building and
running test sandbox is rather heavy and fragile, and (2) data with
high-coverage tests is naturally rare and threatened by test hacking via edge
cases. In this paper, we propose R4P, a patch verifier model to provide
scalable rewards for training and testing SWE agents via reasoning. We consider
that patch verification is fundamentally a reasoning task, mirroring how human
repository maintainers review patches without writing and running new
reproduction tests. To obtain sufficient reference and reduce the risk of
reward hacking, R4P uses a group-wise objective for RL training, enabling it to
verify multiple patches against each other's modification and gain a dense
reward for stable training. R4P achieves 72.2% Acc. for verifying patches from
SWE-bench-verified, surpassing OpenAI o3. To demonstrate R4P's practicality, we
design and train a lite scaffold, Mini-SE, with pure reinforcement learning
where all rewards are derived from R4P. As a result, Mini-SE achieves 26.2%
Pass@1 on SWE-bench-verified, showing a 10.0% improvement over the original
Qwen3-32B. This can be further improved to 32.8% with R4P for test-time
scaling. Furthermore, R4P verifies patches within a second, 50x faster than
testing on average. The stable scaling curves of rewards and accuracy along
with high efficiency reflect R4P's practicality.

Motivation: 人道主义组织面临关键选择：投资昂贵的商业API还是依赖免费开源模型进行多语言人权监控。商业系统提供可靠性，但开源替代方案缺乏实证验证，特别是在冲突地区常见的低资源语言上。

Method: 在78,000次多语言推理中评估了6个模型（4个指令对齐模型和2个开源权重模型），使用标准分类指标和新的跨语言可靠性度量：校准偏差、决策偏差、语言鲁棒性评分和语言稳定性评分。

Conclusion: 多语言对齐实现了语言无关推理，为人道主义组织在多语言部署中平衡预算约束和可靠性提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Humanitarian organizations face a critical choice: invest in costly
commercial APIs or rely on free open-weight models for multilingual human
rights monitoring. While commercial systems offer reliability, open-weight
alternatives lack empirical validation -- especially for low-resource languages
common in conflict zones. This paper presents the first systematic comparison
of commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for
human-rights-violation detection across seven languages, quantifying the
cost-reliability trade-off facing resource-constrained organizations. Across
78,000 multilingual inferences, we evaluate six models -- four
instruction-aligned (Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0,
GPT-4.1-mini) and two open-weight (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B) -- using both
standard classification metrics and new measures of cross-lingual reliability:
Calibration Deviation (CD), Decision Bias (B), Language Robustness Score (LRS),
and Language Stability Score (LSS). Results show that alignment, not scale,
determines stability: aligned models maintain near-invariant accuracy and
balanced calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages
(e.g., Lingala, Burmese), while open-weight models exhibit significant
prompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift. These findings demonstrate
that multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning and provide
practical guidance for humanitarian organizations balancing budget constraints
with reliability in multilingual deployment.

Abstract: Understanding how ideas develop and flow in small-group conversations is
critical for analyzing collaborative learning. A key structural feature of
these interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes
into interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been
widely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous
spoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues.
At the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating
discourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on
tracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether
explicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in
group talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in
synchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting
strategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences
performance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that
capture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting.
Our results show that providing clear conversational thread information
improves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of
downstream analysis on well-structured dialogue. We also discuss practical
trade-offs in time and cost, emphasizing where human-AI hybrid approaches can
yield the best value. Together, this work advances methods for combining LLMs
and robust conversational thread structures to make sense of complex, real-time
group interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如CoT和PoT在复杂多步推理中仍会产生不理想的解决方案，特别是在算法领域，需要更有效的推理增强方法。

Method: PIPS在实例级别生成和精炼程序，使用结构反馈而不依赖任务特定指导或显式测试用例，并引入置信度指标动态选择直接推理或程序合成。

Result: 在3个前沿LLM和30个基准测试中，PIPS相比PoT和CoT分别提升绝对调和平均准确率8.6%和9.4%，在算法任务中比PoT减少65.1%的不良程序生成。

Conclusion: PIPS通过实例级程序合成和动态策略选择，显著提升了LLM在复杂推理任务中的性能，减少了不良解决方案的产生。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but continue to
struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning. Recent methods that augment LLMs
with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of
Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions,
especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis
(PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level
using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit
test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence
metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis
on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30
benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question
answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks
show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and
9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program
generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with
Gemini-2.0-Flash.

TL;DR: 提出了一种残差解缠方法，从语言模型中分离出词汇、句法、语义和推理四个几乎正交的表示，用于建模人脑对自然语言的处理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型内部表示高度纠缠，难以分离不同层次的认知过程，阻碍了对大脑高层面推理神经机制的研究。

Method: 通过残差解缠方法，先识别语言模型中特定特征的层级，然后迭代回归掉低层次表示，得到四个正交的嵌入表示。

Result: 分离出的推理嵌入具有独特的预测能力，能解释其他语言特征无法解释的神经活动方差，且推理神经信号在时间上更晚出现（350-400ms）。

Conclusion: 标准未解缠的语言模型嵌入可能产生误导，其预测成功主要归因于浅层语言特征，掩盖了深层认知处理的贡献。

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple
linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge
in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are
highly "entangled," mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and
reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward
linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult
to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we
introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these
components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our
method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four
nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically,
reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG)
brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We
show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive
power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other
linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions
beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is
temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to
lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing
hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as
their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow
features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLMs中的不确定性现象，即模型在重新提示时会将先前正确的答案翻转为错误答案。通过改进的Needle-in-a-Haystack检索框架和Flip式重新评估提示，发现非检索注意力头是导致不确定性的主要原因，屏蔽这些头可减少15%的翻转行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在不确定性现象，即重新提示时会将正确答案翻转为错误答案，这在高风险领域会破坏信任并带来严重风险。

Method: 采用改进的Needle-in-a-Haystack检索框架，集成Flip式重新评估提示来模拟真实的答案翻转场景，识别并屏蔽导致不确定性的非检索注意力头。

Result: 发现检索头不是避免不确定性的主要原因，而是一小部分非检索注意力头在不确定情境中过度关注误导性标记。屏蔽这些头可减少高达15%的翻转行为，且不会引入不连贯或过度修正。

Conclusion: 研究为机械可解释性领域做出贡献，提供了一种简单有效的技术来减轻LLMs中不确定性驱动的失败模式，但在下游任务测试中观察到与翻转行为的权衡。

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
unwanted uncertainty, a phenomenon where a model changes a previously correct
answer into an incorrect one when re-prompted. This behavior undermines trust
and poses serious risks in high-stakes domains. In this work, we investigate
the mechanisms that drive this phenomenon. We adapt the Needle-in-a-Haystack
retrieval framework and integrate a Flip-style re-evaluation prompt to simulate
realistic answer-flipping scenarios. We find that retrieval heads are not
primarily responsible for avoiding uncertainty. Instead, we identify a small
set of non-retrieval attention heads that disproportionately attend to
misleading tokens in uncertain contexts. Masking these heads yields significant
improvements, reducing flip behavior by up to 15% without introducing
incoherence or overcorrection. However, when tested for downstream tasks, we
observe trade-offs with flip behavior. Our findings contribute to the growing
field of mechanistic interpretability and present a simple yet effective
technique for mitigating uncertainty-driven failure modes in LLMs.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，AI生成文本越来越像人类写作，引发了内容真实性、错误信息和可信度的担忧。需要大规模、多样化且标注良好的数据集来可靠检测AI生成文本并将其归因到特定模型。

Method: 构建包含真实纽约时报文章和由Gemma-2-9b、Mistral-7B、Qwen-2-72B、LLaMA-8B、Yi-Large、GPT-4-o等多个先进LLM生成的合成版本的综合数据集，提供原始文章摘要作为提示和完整人类撰写叙述。

Conclusion: 通过将真实世界新闻内容与现代生成模型相结合，该数据集旨在促进稳健检测和归因方法的发展，在生成AI时代培养信任和透明度。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
human-like AI-generated text, raising concerns about content authenticity,
misinformation, and trustworthiness. Addressing the challenge of reliably
detecting AI-generated text and attributing it to specific models requires
large-scale, diverse, and well-annotated datasets. In this work, we present a
comprehensive dataset comprising over 58,000 text samples that combine
authentic New York Times articles with synthetic versions generated by multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs including Gemma-2-9b, Mistral-7B, Qwen-2-72B, LLaMA-8B,
Yi-Large, and GPT-4-o. The dataset provides original article abstracts as
prompts, full human-authored narratives. We establish baseline results for two
key tasks: distinguishing human-written from AI-generated text, achieving an
accuracy of 58.35\%, and attributing AI texts to their generating models with
an accuracy of 8.92\%. By bridging real-world journalistic content with modern
generative models, the dataset aims to catalyze the development of robust
detection and attribution methods, fostering trust and transparency in the era

*Ranran Haoran Zhang,Soumik Dey,Ashirbad Mishra,Hansi Wu,Binbin Li,Rui Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种批处理推测解码方法，解决了序列长度不一致导致的张量对齐问题，在保持输出等价性的同时显著提升推理吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推测解码通过小模型生成候选token并由大模型并行验证来加速推理，但扩展到批处理时会出现序列长度不一致的张量对齐问题，导致位置ID、注意力掩码和KV缓存状态损坏，影响输出等价性。

Method: 提出了两种方法：EQSPEC通过正确同步保证输出等价性，但重对齐开销占40%；EXSPEC通过维护滑动序列池和动态分组来减少重对齐开销，同时保持每个序列的推测加速效果。

Result: 在SpecBench数据集上，使用Vicuna-7B/68M、Qwen3-8B/0.6B和GLM-4-9B/0.6B等目标/草稿模型对，在批大小8时相比批大小1实现了最高3倍的吞吐量提升，同时保持95%的输出等价性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需定制内核，可无缝集成到现有推理栈中，有效解决了批处理推测解码中的张量对齐问题，在保持正确性的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to
propose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending
this idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the
ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of
draft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention
masks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations
violate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative
decoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive
generation. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the
ragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization
requirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch
speculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of
overhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences
and dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead
while preserving per-sequence speculative speedups. On the SpecBench dataset,
across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B target/draft pairs, our
approach achieves up to 3$\times$ throughput improvement at batch size 8
compared to batch size 1, with efficient scaling through batch size 8, while
maintaining 95% output equivalence. Our method requires no custom kernels and
integrates cleanly with existing inference stacks. Our code is available at

Motivation: 大语言模型经常产生API幻觉和错误定位编辑，而语言服务器能够计算关于真实代码的已验证、IDE级事实。作者认为语言服务器不仅提供结构信息，还提供可操作的过程奖励信号。

Method: 开发了Lanser-CLI，包含：1）稳健的寻址方案和选择器DSL；2）确定性分析包；3）变异操作的安全信封；4）基于语言服务器事实的过程奖励函数。

Result: 建立了在冻结快照下的确定性形式化，并确立了过程奖励的单调性属性，使其适用于过程监督和反事实分析。

Conclusion: Lanser-CLI通过语言服务器为编码代理提供确定性、可重放的工作流和过程奖励，解决了大语言模型在代码编辑中的不可靠性问题。

Abstract: Large language models routinely hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while
language servers compute verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. We present
Lanser-CLI, a CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates a Language
Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic,
replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only
structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also
an actionable process reward: machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an
agent's planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI
contributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle "file:line:col" via
a Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a
principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that
normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata
with stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations
(rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware,
transactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language
Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply
checks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize
determinism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for
the process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and
counterfactual analysis. Project Page:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Infinity-Chat数据集，用于评估语言模型在开放性问题生成中的多样性，揭示了模型存在严重的模式崩溃和人工蜂群效应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型在生成多样化、类似人类的创意内容方面存在困难，长期暴露于相似输出可能导致人类思想的同质化，但目前缺乏可扩展的方法来评估LM输出多样性。

Method: 引入Infinity-Chat数据集，包含26K个多样化的真实世界开放性问题查询，建立了首个全面的开放提示分类法（6个顶级类别、17个子类别），并包含31,250个人类标注。

Result: 研究揭示了语言模型在开放生成中存在显著的人工蜂群效应：模型内部重复和模型间同质性。LM、奖励模型和LM评判器在人类偏好差异较大的生成上校准较差。

Conclusion: Infinity-Chat为系统研究真实世界开放性问题提供了首个大规模资源，揭示了缓解人工蜂群效应带来的长期AI安全风险的关键见解。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative
content, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought
through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for
evaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks
such as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a
single model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,
real-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible
answers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive
taxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to
LMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that
further breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a
large-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial
Hivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)
intra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar
responses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models
produce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human
annotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25
independent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and
individual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our
findings show that LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated
to human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic
annotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall,
INFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically
studying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to
guide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the
Artificial Hivemind.

Motivation: 现代大型语言模型在处理长复杂上下文时存在有效问答和推理能力的限制，现有方法如RAG和分块重排序依赖复杂的预处理和索引步骤，且对分块、嵌入和检索策略敏感。

Method: 提出轻量级数据增强策略TAG，通过在上下文或提示中添加标记定义来增强LLM在长上下文场景中的表现，保持文档完整性。

Result: 在NoLima和NovelQA基准测试中，TAG方法在32K标记上下文中性能提升达17%，在需要跨文本知识的多跳查询复杂推理问答中提升2.9%。

Conclusion: TAG是一种有效的轻量级方法，能够显著提升LLM在长上下文问答任务中的性能，且不依赖复杂的预处理步骤。

Abstract: Recent investigations into effective context lengths of modern flagship large
language models (LLMs) have revealed major limitations in effective question
answering (QA) and reasoning over long and complex contexts for even the
largest and most impressive cadre of models. While approaches like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to
mitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval
strategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing,
knowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose
Tagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy
that boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and
altering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our
hypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant
question-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging
the context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to
consistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token
contexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop
queries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text. Additional details are

Motivation: 大语言模型在生物医学、法律和教育等高风险领域的广泛应用引发了对其输出事实准确性的担忧，现有短文本评估方法无法有效评估长文本内容。

Method: 整合大规模长文本数据集、多智能体验证机制和加权评估指标，构建中文长文本事实数据集LongHalluQA，开发基于辩论的多智能体验证系统MAD-Fact，引入事实重要性层次结构。

Result: 在两个基准测试上的实验表明，更大的LLM通常保持更高的事实一致性，而国内模型在中文内容上表现更优。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估和增强长文本LLM输出的事实可靠性提供了一个结构化框架，指导其在敏感领域的安全部署。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) raises critical
concerns about the factual accuracy of their outputs, especially in high-risk
domains such as biomedicine, law, and education. Existing evaluation methods
for short texts often fail on long-form content due to complex reasoning
chains, intertwined perspectives, and cumulative information. To address this,
we propose a systematic approach integrating large-scale long-form datasets,
multi-agent verification mechanisms, and weighted evaluation metrics. We
construct LongHalluQA, a Chinese long-form factuality dataset; and develop
MAD-Fact, a debate-based multi-agent verification system. We introduce a fact
importance hierarchy to capture the varying significance of claims in long-form
texts. Experiments on two benchmarks show that larger LLMs generally maintain
higher factual consistency, while domestic models excel on Chinese content. Our
work provides a structured framework for evaluating and enhancing factual
reliability in long-form LLM outputs, guiding their safe deployment in
sensitive domains.

Motivation: 教育领域需要客观可扩展的教学质量测量方法，通用LLM在处理复杂的课堂观察工具时可靠性不足。

Method: 使用基于句子级嵌入的定制LLM架构，系统评估五种句子嵌入方法，采用防过拟合的数据高效训练策略。

Result: 专业模型达到人类水平表现（与专家评分相关性>0.65），超越平均人-人评分相关性；高级模型更关注课程级特征而非孤立话语；总体模型得分与教师增值测量相关。

Conclusion: 建立了AI驱动教学测量的可行方法，为实现可扩展、可靠、有效的教师发展反馈提供了路径。

Abstract: Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent
challenge in education. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,
general-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic
classroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on
sentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,
interpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword
tokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings
under a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our
results demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and
even super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and
surpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis
of annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better
aligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to
lesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the
sufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external
validity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added
measures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning.
However, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that
while the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full
generalization. This work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for
AI-driven instructional measurement, offering a path toward providing scalable,
reliable, and valid feedback for educator development.

Motivation: 深入理解不同架构大语言模型在上下文学习中的内部机制差异，特别是transformer、状态空间和混合模型的对比研究。

Method: 结合行为探测和基于干预的方法，分析不同架构LLM在知识型上下文学习任务中的表现和内部机制。

Result: 发现负责上下文学习的函数向量主要位于自注意力层和Mamba层，Mamba2可能使用不同于函数向量的机制进行上下文学习。函数向量在涉及参数知识检索的上下文学习中更重要，但在上下文知识理解中作用较小。

Conclusion: 不同架构的LLM在任务表现上可能相似，但内部机制存在差异。结合行为和机制分析对于研究LLM能力至关重要，有助于更细致地理解不同架构和任务类型。

Abstract: We perform in-depth evaluations of in-context learning (ICL) on
state-of-the-art transformer, state-space, and hybrid large language models
over two categories of knowledge-based ICL tasks. Using a combination of
behavioral probing and intervention-based methods, we have discovered that,
while LLMs of different architectures can behave similarly in task performance,
their internals could remain different. We discover that function vectors (FVs)
responsible for ICL are primarily located in the self-attention and Mamba
layers, and speculate that Mamba2 uses a different mechanism from FVs to
perform ICL. FVs are more important for ICL involving parametric knowledge
retrieval, but not for contextual knowledge understanding. Our work contributes
to a more nuanced understanding across architectures and task types.
Methodologically, our approach also highlights the importance of combining both
behavioural and mechanistic analyses to investigate LLM capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估器主要基于纯文本推理，难以验证复杂约束和进行精确计算，限制了评估能力。受工具集成推理在其他任务中成功的启发，希望开发能够集成代码执行器的评估器。

Method: 基于三个原则构建：跨可验证和不可验证领域的多样化训练、灵活的评估格式（点对点、成对、列表）、无需蒸馏的迭代强化学习。

Result: 在7个公共基准测试中，TIR-Judge在点对点评估上超越强推理基准6.4%，在成对评估上超越7.7%，列表评估性能与Claude-Opus-4相当（仅8B参数）。TIR-Judge-Zero无需蒸馏轨迹也能达到蒸馏变体的性能。

Conclusion: 工具增强的评估器可以通过迭代强化学习自我进化，无需依赖蒸馏数据，证明了工具集成推理在LLM评估任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as judges to evaluate response
quality, providing a scalable alternative to human evaluation. However, most
LLM judges operate solely on intrinsic text-based reasoning, limiting their
ability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computation.
Motivated by the success of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) in numerous tasks,
we propose TIR-Judge, an end-to-end RL framework for training LLM judges that
integrates a code executor for precise evaluation. TIR-Judge is built on three
principles: (i) diverse training across verifiable and non-verifiable domains,
(ii) flexible judgment formats (pointwise, pairwise, listwise), and (iii)
iterative RL that bootstraps directly from the initial model without
distillation. On seven public benchmarks, TIR-Judge surpasses strong
reasoning-based judges by up to 6.4% (pointwise) and 7.7% (pairwise), and
achieves listwise performance comparable to Claude-Opus-4 despite having only
8B parameters. Remarkably, TIR-Judge-Zero - trained entirely without distilled
judge trajectories, matches the performance of distilled variants,
demonstrating that tool-augmented judges can self-evolve through iterative
reinforcement learning.

TL;DR: 提出knocking-heads attention (KHA)机制，通过跨头特征级交互增强多头注意力，解决了传统注意力机制中头间缺乏强交互的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多头注意力机制中，增加头数会削弱单个头的能力，且现有机制只是简单拼接孤立头的输出，缺乏头间的强交互。

Method: 在缩放点积注意力之前应用共享的对角初始化投影矩阵，使注意力头能够相互'敲击'，实现跨头特征级交互。

Result: 在6.1B参数MoE模型上验证，相比基线注意力机制，KHA带来更优越和稳定的训练动态，在下游任务中表现更好。

Conclusion: KHA通过最小参数和计算开销实现了有效的跨头交互，可无缝集成到各种注意力变体中，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-head attention (MHA) has become the cornerstone of modern large
language models, enhancing representational capacity through parallel attention
heads. However, increasing the number of heads inherently weakens individual
head capacity, and existing attention mechanisms - whether standard MHA or its
variants like grouped-query attention (GQA) and grouped-tied attention (GTA) -
simply concatenate outputs from isolated heads without strong interaction. To
address this limitation, we propose knocking-heads attention (KHA), which
enables attention heads to "knock" on each other - facilitating cross-head
feature-level interactions before the scaled dot-product attention. This is
achieved by applying a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix across
all heads. The diagonal initialization preserves head-specific specialization
at the start of training while allowing the model to progressively learn
integrated cross-head representations. KHA adds only minimal parameters and
FLOPs and can be seamlessly integrated into MHA, GQA, GTA, and other attention
variants. We validate KHA by training a 6.1B parameter MoE model (1.01B
activated) on 1T high-quality tokens. Compared to baseline attention
mechanisms, KHA brings superior and more stable training dynamics, achieving
better performance across downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么假设翻译质量足够好，要么使用重写方法导致事实扭曲和幻觉。在低资源语言环境下，翻译质量差会严重影响响应生成性能。

Method: QTT-RAG明确评估翻译质量的三个维度，并将这些分数作为元数据附加到文档中，不改变原始内容。

Result: 在XORQA和MKQA两个开放域QA基准测试中，使用6个2.4B到14B参数的指令调优LLM，覆盖韩语、芬兰语（低资源）和中文（高资源），QTT-RAG优于CrossRAG和DKM-RAG基线方法。

Conclusion: QTT-RAG通过保持事实完整性，使生成模型能够基于翻译可靠性做出明智决策，为低资源环境下跨语言文档的有效使用提供了实用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) often retrieves English
documents and translates them into the query language for low-resource
settings. However, poor translation quality degrades response generation
performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality
or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and
hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware
Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation
quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and
naturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the
original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines
in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs
ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages
(Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG
outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling
generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability.
This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in
low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a
practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have highlighted the significant
benefits of multi-stage training, with a particular emphasis on the emergence
of mid-training as a vital stage that bridges pre-training and post-training.
Mid-training is distinguished by its use of intermediate data and computational
resources, systematically enhancing specified capabilities such as mathematics,
coding, reasoning, and long-context extension, while maintaining foundational
competencies. This survey provides a formal definition of mid-training for
large language models (LLMs) and investigates optimization frameworks that
encompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture
optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of
objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a
distinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities.
By clarifying the unique contributions of mid-training, this survey offers a
comprehensive taxonomy and actionable insights, supporting future research and
innovation in the advancement of LLMs.

TL;DR: MAP4TS是一个多角度提示框架，将经典时间序列分析融入提示设计，通过全局域提示、局部域提示、统计提示和时间提示四个组件，结合原始时间序列嵌入，提升LLM在时间序列预测中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法往往忽视时间序列数据特有的统计特性和时间依赖性，需要将经典时间序列分析明确纳入提示设计。

Method: 提出四个专用提示组件：全局域提示（数据集级上下文）、局部域提示（近期趋势和序列特定行为）、统计提示和时间提示（基于自相关、偏自相关和傅里叶分析的手工洞察），通过跨模态对齐模块生成统一表示。

Result: 在八个不同数据集上的实验表明，MAP4TS持续优于最先进的基于LLM的方法，提示感知设计显著提升性能稳定性，GPT-2骨干网络在结构化提示下在长期预测任务中优于LLaMA等更大模型。

Conclusion: MAP4TS通过将经典时间序列分析融入提示设计，有效提升了LLM在时间序列预测中的性能，证明了提示感知设计的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models
(LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM
embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the
distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental
to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel
Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical
time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four
specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys
dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and
series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that
embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial
autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined
with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment
module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM
and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse
datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs
significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when
paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in
long-term forecasting tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了在医学多文档摘要任务中引入层次结构输入的方法，相比传统平铺式摘要，层次结构能提升模型组织跨文档信息的能力，生成更受人类专家偏好的摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学多文档摘要是复杂任务，需要有效管理跨文档关系。传统平铺式摘要方法在组织信息方面存在局限，因此研究层次结构是否能提升模型的信息组织和上下文理解能力。

Method: 研究了两种层次组织方法，在三个大语言模型上进行实验，使用自动化指标、基于模型的指标和领域专家评估（偏好性、可理解性、清晰度、复杂性、相关性、覆盖度、事实性和连贯性）进行综合评估。

Result: 人类专家更偏好模型生成的摘要而非人工编写的摘要。层次方法通常能保持信息的事实性、覆盖度和连贯性，同时提高人类对摘要的偏好。GPT-4的模拟判断与人类判断在更客观的评估维度上具有更高一致性。

Conclusion: 层次结构可以提升医学摘要的清晰度，同时保持内容覆盖度，为提高生成摘要的人类偏好提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Medical multi-document summarization (MDS) is a complex task that requires
effectively managing cross-document relationships. This paper investigates
whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve
a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents
compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of
incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models
(LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using
automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of
preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage,
factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer
model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches
generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while
also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine
whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding
higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings
demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical
summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a
practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.

TL;DR: 提出一种紧凑的单模型多语言词形变化方法，在73种语言上联合训练，性能优于单语言基线，简化了部署过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决缺乏开源、通用、多语言形态变化系统的问题，特别是能够处理未见词汇的系统

Method: 使用单模型在73种语言数据上联合训练，引入基于频率加权、词干不相交的训练-开发-测试重采样方法

Result: 模型轻量、对未见词汇鲁棒，在大多数语言中优于单语言基线模型

Conclusion: 多语言建模在词形变化任务中有效，具有简化部署的实用价值

Abstract: We present a compact, single-model approach to multilingual inflection, the
task of generating inflected word forms from base lemmas to express grammatical
categories. Our model, trained jointly on data from 73 languages, is
lightweight, robust to unseen words, and outperforms monolingual baselines in
most languages. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multilingual modeling
for inflection and highlights its practical benefits: simplifying deployment by
eliminating the need to manage and retrain dozens of separate monolingual
models. In addition to the standard SIGMORPHON shared task benchmarks, we
evaluate our monolingual and multilingual models on 73 Universal Dependencies
(UD) treebanks, extracting lemma-tag-form triples and their frequency counts.
To ensure realistic data splits, we introduce a novel frequency-weighted,
lemma-disjoint train-dev-test resampling procedure. Our work addresses the lack
of an open-source, general-purpose, multilingual morphological inflection
system capable of handling unseen words across a wide range of languages,
including Czech. All code is publicly released at:

TL;DR: TopLoRA是一种改进的低秩适应方法，通过为每个输入token动态调整LoRA权重，实现token级别的输入输出投影，在保持相同秩的情况下获得更细粒度的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA方法中所有输入token共享相同的权重，无法捕捉token特定的语义信息，限制了模型的表达能力。

Method: 提出TopLoRA方法，权重表示为BΣ_XA，其中Σ_X是根据每个输入token生成的对角矩阵，实现token级别的权重调整。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验表明，TopLoRA一致性地优于标准LoRA及其变体。

Conclusion: TopLoRA通过token级别的自适应投影，在不增加秩的情况下显著提升了LoRA的性能。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the
projection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the
dimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens
share the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This
limits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent
semantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose
Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts
LoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise
input-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of
TopLoRA can be expressed as $B\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank
matrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated
from each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA
weights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA
weights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments
across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统形态学屈折方法忽略了词汇频率分布信息，而实际部署中用户输入会反映自然文本的真实频率分布。论文旨在将语料库频率信息整合到系统开发中，以更好地适应实际应用场景。

Method: 采用三方面方法：(1) 结合词干不相交和频率加权的训练-测试划分策略；(2) 在标准类型准确率基础上引入词例准确率评估；(3) 提出频率感知训练方法，在训练采样中显式考虑词频。

Result: 频率感知训练在43种语言中的26种语言上优于均匀采样方法，证明了频率信息对提升形态学屈折性能的有效性。

Conclusion: 将语料库频率信息融入形态学屈折任务能够显著提升系统性能，特别是在实际部署场景下，频率感知方法能够更好地反映真实世界的语言使用模式。

Abstract: The traditional approach to morphological inflection (the task of modifying a
base word (lemma) to express grammatical categories) has been, for decades, to
consider lexical entries of lemma-tag-form triples uniformly, lacking any
information about their frequency distribution. However, in production
deployment, one might expect the user inputs to reflect a real-world
distribution of frequencies in natural texts. With future deployment in mind,
we explore the incorporation of corpus frequency information into the task of
morphological inflection along three key dimensions during system development:
(i) for train-dev-test split, we combine a lemma-disjoint approach, which
evaluates the model's generalization capabilities, with a frequency-weighted
strategy to better reflect the realistic distribution of items across different
frequency bands in training and test sets; (ii) for evaluation, we complement
the standard type accuracy (often referred to simply as accuracy), which treats
all items equally regardless of frequency, with token accuracy, which assigns
greater weight to frequent words and better approximates performance on running
text; (iii) for training data sampling, we introduce a method novel in the
context of inflection, frequency-aware training, which explicitly incorporates
word frequency into the sampling process. We show that frequency-aware training
outperforms uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法只关注高质量数据，忽视了低质量数据中的有价值信号，且依赖不完美的质量过滤器。

Method: 提出ENTP框架，结合符号模块（基于统计先验识别和修剪噪声样本）和神经组件（利用潜在表示和模型知识合成增强的指令-响应对）。

Result: ENTP增强的数据集在五个指令跟随基准测试中超越13种现有数据选择基线，甚至优于在完整原始数据集（约30万样本）上的微调结果。

Conclusion: 低质量数据具有未开发的潜力，智能净化和合成对于高效的指令对齐至关重要。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to domain-specific instructions by training on a carefully curated subset of
high-quality instruction-response pairs, typically drawn from a larger dataset
that often contains many low-quality or noisy samples. However, existing
quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded
low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP
(Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a
framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification
and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy
samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes
enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and
model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and
diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed
exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection
baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass
fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our
results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the
importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction
alignment.

<details>

Motivation: 传统端到端的LLM剧本生成方法往往只模仿表面格式而缺乏深层叙事结构，因为单个模型难以同时掌握创意叙事构建和严格格式遵循这两种不同能力。

Method: 双阶段精炼框架：第一阶段将简要大纲转化为丰富的类小说风格散文，第二阶段将叙事精炼为专业格式剧本。采用混合数据合成方法解决训练数据稀缺问题。

Result: 专业编剧盲评显示，DSR在对抗Gemini-2.5-Pro等强基线时达到75%胜率，达到人类水平表现的82.7%。

Conclusion: 分解生成架构结合定制化数据合成能有效让LLM在复杂创意领域实现专业化，为高质量剧本生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining
narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end
generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue
this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two
disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format
adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep
structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.
To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage
Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative
generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline
into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a
professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to
specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in
implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We
address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs
existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages
these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.
Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%
win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of
human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation
architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in
complex creative domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代码生成评估面临挑战：单元测试成本高且不可扩展，语法相似度指标无法捕捉代码功能，而CodeBERTScore等需要参考代码。需要开发无需参考代码的评估方法。

Method: 使用对比学习为代码和自然语言任务描述生成有意义的嵌入表示，通过相似度评分来反映生成代码实现任务的程度。

Result: MATCH在多种编程语言中，相比现有指标在功能正确性和人类偏好方面都表现出更强的相关性。

Conclusion: MATCH是一种有效的无参考代码生成评估指标，能够更好地衡量生成代码与开发者意图的对齐程度。

Abstract: AI-based code generation is increasingly prevalent, with GitHub Copilot
estimated to generate 46% of the code on GitHub. Accurately evaluating how well
generated code aligns with developer intent remains a critical challenge.
Traditional evaluation methods, such as unit tests, are often unscalable and
costly. Syntactic similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) fail to capture code
functionality, and metrics like CodeBERTScore require reference code, which is
not always available. To address the gap in reference-free evaluation, with few
alternatives such as ICE-Score, this paper introduces MATCH, a novel
reference-free metric. MATCH uses Contrastive Learning to generate meaningful
embeddings for code and natural language task descriptions, enabling similarity
scoring that reflects how well generated code implements the task. We show that
MATCH achieves stronger correlations with functional correctness and human
preference than existing metrics across multiple programming languages.

TL;DR: SI-Bench是一个评估大语言模型社交智能的新基准，包含2,221个真实多轮对话，实验显示SOTA模型在复杂社交情境的推理能力已超越人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多通过模拟代理间交互构建数据集，无法捕捉真实人类对话的语言风格和关系动态，需要更真实的社交智能评估基准。

Method: 基于广泛的社会科学理论，从社交网络应用收集2,221个真实多轮对话，并对312个对话在8个主要模型上进行人工标注。

Result: SOTA模型在复杂社交情境的过程推理能力已超越人类专家，但在回复质量上仍落后于人类，且引入思维链推理可能降低LLMs在社交对话任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 需要开发更有效的社交智能评估方法，现有LLMs在社交对话中仍有改进空间，特别是回复质量方面。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) develop anthropomorphic abilities, they are
increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents to interact with humans.
However, evaluating their performance in realistic and complex social
interactions remains a significant challenge. Most previous research built
datasets through simulated agent-to-agent interactions, which fails to capture
the authentic linguistic styles and relational dynamics found in real human
conversations. To address this gap, we introduce SI-Bench, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate aspects of social intelligence in LLMs. Grounded in broad
social science theories, SI-Bench contains 2,221 authentic multi-turn dialogues
collected from a social networking application. We further selected a subset of
312 dialogues for manual annotation across 8 major models. The experiments show
that SOTA models have surpassed the human expert in process reasoning under
complex social situations, yet they still fall behind humans in reply quality.
Moreover, introducing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may degrade the
performance of LLMs in social dialogue tasks. All datasets are openly available
at https://github.com/SI-Bench/SI-Bench.git.

Method: 先用训练好的关系抽取模型发现实体间关系，然后应用到医学文本语料库构建药物关系本体，最后用大语言模型验证提取结果

Result: 定量结果显示LLM对PubMed摘要子集中71%的提取关系表示同意；定性分析表明该方法能揭示医学领域的歧义性

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提取药物关系并构建本体，同时揭示了医学领域关系提取的挑战

Abstract: Relation extraction between drugs plays a crucial role in identifying drug
drug interactions and predicting side effects. The advancement of machine
learning methods in relation extraction, along with the development of large
medical text databases, has enabled the low cost extraction of such relations
compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge. However,
to the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed
for drug drug relation extraction currently available. Therefore, employing
transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this
domain. In this study, we propose DREAM, a method that first employs a trained
relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then
applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of
drug relationships. The extracted relations are subsequently validated using a
large language model. Quantitative results indicate that the LLM agreed with 71
of the relations extracted from a subset of PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, our
qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in
the medical domain, highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction
in this field.

TL;DR: 提出一种句子级别的过程奖励模型（PRM），用于检测大型视觉语言模型在生成放射学报告时产生的临床关键幻觉，提高报告质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在生成放射学报告时经常产生临床关键幻觉，存在严重风险，而现有的幻觉检测方法缺乏句子级粒度且泛化能力不足。

Method: 开发轻量级（0.5B参数）的句子级过程奖励模型，在MIMIC-CXR数据集上使用弱监督标签进行微调，预测每个生成句子的真实性，并考虑临床上下文和先前文本。

Result: PRM在多个指标上优于现有验证技术，在未见过的LVLM上表现出强泛化能力，能够有效过滤低质量报告，在引导加权最佳选择过程中显著提升临床指标。

Conclusion: 轻量级、上下文感知的PRM为临床LVLM提供了模型无关的安全层，无需访问内部激活状态，有效提升了放射学报告生成的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Automating radiology report generation with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) holds great potential, yet these models often produce clinically
critical hallucinations, posing serious risks. Existing hallucination detection
methods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust
generalization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach:
a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language
task. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence,
conditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on
MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM
outperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance,
relative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in
AUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods
reliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to
an unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively
filter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when
discarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted
best-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative
improvements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for
BERTScore. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, context-aware PRM
provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without access to
internal activations

Abstract: Conventional research on speech recognition modeling relies on the canonical
form for most low-resource languages while automatic speech recognition (ASR)
for regional dialects is treated as a fine-tuning task. To investigate the
effects of dialectal variations on ASR we develop a 78-hour annotated Bengali
Speech-to-Text (STT) corpus named Ben-10. Investigation from linguistic and
data-driven perspectives shows that speech foundation models struggle heavily
in regional dialect ASR, both in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We observe
that all deep learning methods struggle to model speech data under dialectal
variations but dialect specific model training alleviates the issue. Our

*Mohammed Aljafari,Ismail Alturki,Ahmed Mori,Yehya Kadumi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mubeen是一个专有的阿拉伯语语言模型，通过深度语言学工程框架训练，专注于阿拉伯语言学、伊斯兰研究和文化遗产的深度理解，采用实用闭合架构解决信息与用户需求之间的效用差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有阿拉伯语模型依赖英语翻译数据导致意图检测和检索增强生成失败的问题，确保文化真实性和准确性，同时应对事实正确但无法满足用户核心需求的'效用差距危机'。

Method: 使用专有阿拉伯OCR引擎数字化历史手稿扩展训练数据，整合语言学、法学、圣训和古兰经注释等学术著作，结合多学科专家模块，采用实用闭合架构优先考虑清晰度和决定性指导。

Result: 模型能够精确理解古典文本、当代写作和地区方言，掌握阿拉伯语的优雅表达，在文化保护和一般知识领域均表现出强大性能。

Conclusion: Mubeen从信息存储库转变为决定性指南，与沙特2030愿景保持一致，通过原生阿拉伯语源确保文化真实性，解决了用户重复提示的挫败循环。

Abstract: Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model developed by MASARAT SA,
optimized for deep understanding of Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and
cultural heritage. Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic
sources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a
proprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works
in linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside
thousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned
through a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the
meaning but the eloquence of Arabic, enabling precise understanding across
classical texts, contemporary writing, and regional dialects with focus on
comprehending user intent and delivering accurate, contextually relevant
responses. Unlike other Arabic models relying on translated English data that
often fail in intent detection or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Mubeen
uses native Arabic sources to ensure cultural authenticity and accuracy. Its
core innovation is the Practical Closure Architecture, designed to solve the
"Utility Gap Crisis" where factually correct answers fail to resolve users'
core needs, forcing them into frustrating cycles of re-prompting. By
prioritizing clarity and decisive guidance, Mubeen transforms from an
information repository into a decisive guide, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030.
The model's architecture combines deep heritage specialization with
multi-disciplinary expert modules, enabling robust performance across both
cultural preservation and general knowledge domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种提升LLM生成代码美观性的新方法，通过构建AesCode-358K数据集和代理奖励反馈系统，结合GRPO算法优化代码功能和美观性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在传统编程任务中表现出色，但在视觉导向的编码任务中生成代码的美观性较差，需要专门的方法来提升代码美学质量。

Method: 1. 构建AesCode-358K指令调优数据集；2. 提出代理奖励反馈系统评估可执行性、静态美学和交互美学；3. 开发GRPO-AR算法联合优化功能性和代码美学；4. 建立OpenDesign基准评估代码美学。

Result: 在AesCode-358K上进行监督微调并结合强化学习的代理奖励反馈，在OpenDesign基准上显著提升性能，在PandasPlotBench等现有基准上也有改进。AesCoder-4B超越GPT-4o和GPT-4.1，性能接近480B-685B参数的大型开源模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LLM生成代码的美观性，证明了专门针对代码美学的优化策略的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers
in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such
as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding
tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new
pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first
construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on
code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system
that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics.
Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the
GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics.
Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics.
Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K
with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly
improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing
benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o
and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models
with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 第九届CHiME挑战赛引入MCoRec任务，解决单房间环境下重叠对话的鸡尾酒会问题，使用音频、视觉和上下文线索识别谁在何时说了什么以及与谁对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然多人群聊中极端语音重叠（可达100%）和高度碎片化对话轮次的识别问题，传统音频方法在此类场景下效果不佳。

Method: 通过音频-视觉联合记录，结合视觉线索来转录每个说话者的语音并将其聚类到各自的对话中。

Result: 纯音频基线的词错误率超过100%，而加入视觉线索后词错误率显著改善50%，证明了多模态方法的重要性。

Conclusion: MCoRec任务展示了在高度重叠对话场景中，多模态方法相比纯音频方法具有显著优势，为复杂对话分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce the task of Multi-Modal Context-Aware Recognition (MCoRec) in
the ninth CHiME Challenge, which addresses the cocktail-party problem of
overlapping conversations in a single-room setting using audio, visual, and
contextual cues. MCoRec captures natural multi-party conversations where the
recordings focus on unscripted, casual group chats, leading to extreme speech
overlap of up to 100% and highly fragmented conversational turns. The task
requires systems to answer the question "Who speaks when, what, and with whom?"
by jointly transcribing each speaker's speech and clustering them into their
respective conversations from audio-visual recordings. Audio-only baselines
exceed 100% word error rate, whereas incorporating visual cues yields
substantial 50% improvements, highlighting the importance of multi-modality. In
this manuscript, we present the motivation behind the task, outline the data
collection process, and report the baseline systems developed for the MCoRec.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种完全自动化的数据为中心的方法，用于改进文本到SQL任务，包括自适应数据修复和错误数据增强，以及多模型协作训练和集成策略，在轻量级模型中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于代理的框架在文本到SQL任务中取得了显著改进，但数据为中心策略的影响很少被探索。现有方法主要依赖单一微调模型，但其能力有限。

Method: 设计了全自动数据为中心管道：1）自适应数据修复 - 自动发现并修复训练数据集中的错误；2）错误数据增强 - 扩散和增强初始模型预测的错误数据；3）多模型协作训练 - 用不同增强数据训练多个模型，使其具备不同能力并互补；4）集成策略 - 整合多个模型能力解决多选题。

Result: 实验和消融研究证明了数据为中心管道和多模型交互迭代策略的有效性，在轻量级文本到SQL模型（70B以内）中取得了第一名。

Conclusion: 数据为中心的方法和多模型协作策略显著提升了文本到SQL任务的性能，特别是在轻量级模型上表现出色，为这一领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL tasks have gained attractive improvements since the release of
ChatGPT. Among them, agent-based frameworks have been widely used in this
field. However, the impact of data-centric strategies on text-to-SQL tasks has
rarely been explored. In this paper, we systemically design a fully automated
data-centric pipeline for text-to-SQL tasks, including \emph{adaptive data
repair}, which can automatically find and fix errors in the training dataset;
and \emph{error data augmentation}, where we specifically diffuse and enhance
erroneous data predicted by the initially trained models. Meanwhile, we propose
a Multi-Model collaboration training schema, aiming to train multiple models
with different augmented data, enabling them to possess distinct capabilities
and work together to complement each other, because it has been found that the
capability of a single fine-tuned model is very limited. Furthermore, we
utilize an ensemble strategy to integrate the capabilities of multiple models
to solve a multiple-choice question, aiming to further improve the accuracy of
text-to-SQL tasks. The experiment results and ablation study have demonstrated
the effectiveness of data-centric pipeline and Multi-Model(MM) interactive
iterative strategies, achieving first place in lightweight text-to-SQL models
(within 70B).

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Arabic Little STT数据集，这是一个包含288名6-13岁儿童355条黎凡特阿拉伯语课堂语音的数据集，并评估了Whisper模型在儿童语音识别上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决阿拉伯语等低资源语言中儿童特定语音语料库的缺失问题，该问题对AI系统的性能造成重大挑战。

Method: 创建Arabic Little STT儿童语音数据集，并系统评估8个Whisper变体在该数据集上的表现，与成人阿拉伯语基准进行比较。

Result: 即使表现最好的Whisper Large_v3模型在儿童语音上的词错误率高达0.66，远高于其在成人数据集上低于0.20的表现，与英语语音研究结果一致。

Conclusion: ASR开发迫切需要专门的儿童语音基准和包容性训练数据，且此类数据必须遵循严格的伦理和隐私框架来保护儿童敏感信息。

Abstract: The performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems fundamentally depends
on high-quality training data. However, low-resource languages like Arabic
suffer from severe data scarcity. Moreover, the absence of child-specific
speech corpora is an essential gap that poses significant challenges. To
address this gap, we present our created dataset, Arabic Little STT, a dataset
of Levantine Arabic child speech recorded in classrooms, containing 355
utterances from 288 children (ages 6 - 13). We further conduct a systematic
assessment of Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR)
model, on this dataset and compare its performance with adult Arabic
benchmarks. Our evaluation across eight Whisper variants reveals that even the
best-performing model (Large_v3) struggles significantly, achieving a 0.66 word
error rate (WER) on child speech, starkly contrasting with its sub 0.20 WER on
adult datasets. These results align with other research on English speech.
Results highlight the critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and
inclusive training data in ASR development. Emphasizing that such data must be
governed by strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child
information. We hope that this study provides an initial step for future work
on equitable speech technologies for Arabic-speaking children. We hope that our
publicly available dataset enrich the children's demographic representation in
ASR datasets.

TL;DR: AdaSearch是一种新颖的块状搜索策略，通过自适应分配固定计算预算，专注于响应中关键的前几个token，在LLM对齐任务中显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理时方法计算资源分配均匀，导致对齐效果不佳。作者假设响应初始token对对齐任务更为关键，需要更高效的计算资源分配策略。

Method: 提出AdaSearch块状搜索策略，使用采样调度自适应分配固定计算预算，专注于关键token。同时开发了树搜索版本AdaBeam。

Result: 在8个LLM上的综合评估显示，AdaSearch在无害性生成、受控情感生成和数学推理任务中，相比Best-of-N基线胜率提升超过10%。

Conclusion: AdaSearch通过自适应计算预算分配，专注于关键初始token，为LLM对齐提供了高效且有效的推理时解决方案。

Abstract: LLM alignment remains a critical challenge. Inference-time methods provide a
flexible alternative to fine-tuning, but their uniform computational effort
often yields suboptimal alignment. We hypothesize that for many alignment
tasks, the initial tokens of a response are disproportionately more critical.
To leverage this principle, we introduce AdaSearch, a novel blockwise search
strategy. It adaptively allocates a fixed computational budget using a sampling
schedule, focusing search effort on these critical tokens. We apply AdaSearch
to sequential decoding and introduce its tree-search counterpart, AdaBeam. Our
comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs demonstrates that AdaSearch
outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, win-rates
improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment
generation, and for mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.

TL;DR: 提出首个基于八字命理的人物推理问答数据集和BaZi-LLM系统，结合符号推理与大语言模型生成动态细粒度虚拟人物，相比主流LLM准确率提升30.3%-62.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虚拟人物生成方法依赖标注数据或手工制作的人物提示，难以规模化生成真实且上下文一致的人物。

Method: 创建八字命理人物推理问答数据集，将人类经验分类为财富、健康、亲情、事业和关系等生活事件问答；提出BaZi-LLM系统，整合符号推理与大语言模型。

Result: 相比DeepSeek-v3和GPT-5-mini等主流LLM，准确率提升30.3%-62.6%；当使用错误八字信息时，模型准确率下降20%-45%。

Conclusion: 基于文化根基的符号推理与LLM整合在真实人物模拟方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Human-like virtual characters are crucial for games, storytelling, and
virtual reality, yet current methods rely heavily on annotated data or
handcrafted persona prompts, making it difficult to scale up and generate
realistic, contextually coherent personas. We create the first QA dataset for
BaZi-based persona reasoning, where real human experiences categorized into
wealth, health, kinship, career, and relationships are represented as
life-event questions and answers. Furthermore, we propose the first BaZi-LLM
system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to
generate temporally dynamic and fine-grained virtual personas. Compared with
mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini, our method achieves a
30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement. In addition, when incorrect BaZi information
is used, our model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the potential of
culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character
simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高质量知识图谱稀缺的问题，现有提取方法依赖错误率高的模式匹配或计算密集型大语言模型，限制了在低资源环境中的可访问性。

Method: 采用两个关键技术：1）上下文集成图提取 - 将上下文信息与节点和边整合到统一图结构中；2）拓扑增强关系推理 - 利用提取图的固有拓扑结构高效推断关系。

Result: 能够以最小硬件需求实现准确的知识图谱构建，弥合了自动知识提取与实用部署场景之间的差距。

Conclusion: 该工作为在结构化NLP任务中优化小型语言模型效率引入了科学严谨的方法，使知识图谱提取在资源受限环境中变得可行。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a critical
bottleneck for downstream AI applications, as existing extraction methods rely
heavily on error-prone pattern-matching techniques or resource-intensive large
language models (LLMs). While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their
computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our
paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG
extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through
two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction
integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph
structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while
maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference
leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer
relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex
language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG
construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap
between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while
introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in
structured NLP tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基准测试，用于评估大型语言模型预测AI对就业市场影响的能力，结合了美国高频职位发布数据和全球AI采用预测数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能正在重塑劳动力市场，但缺乏系统预测其就业影响的工具。现有研究表明LLMs能够提取情感、总结经济报告和模拟预测者行为，但很少评估其在劳动力预测中的应用。

Method: 构建包含两个互补数据集的基准测试：美国部门级高频职位发布指数和全球AI采用导致的职业变化预测数据集。使用多种提示策略评估LLMs，包括任务支架、角色驱动和混合方法。

Result: 结构化任务提示持续提高预测稳定性，角色提示在短期趋势上有优势。但不同部门和预测期限的表现差异显著，需要领域感知提示和严格评估协议。

Conclusion: 该基准测试支持未来劳动力预测、提示设计和基于LLM的经济推理研究，为研究AI作为劳动力市场预测工具的局限性和机会提供了可复现的测试平台。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping labor markets, yet we lack tools to
systematically forecast its effects on employment. This paper introduces a
benchmark for evaluating how well large language models (LLMs) can anticipate
changes in job demand, especially in occupations affected by AI. Existing
research has shown that LLMs can extract sentiment, summarize economic reports,
and emulate forecaster behavior, but little work has assessed their use for
forward-looking labor prediction. Our benchmark combines two complementary
datasets: a high-frequency index of sector-level job postings in the United
States, and a global dataset of projected occupational changes due to AI
adoption. We format these data into forecasting tasks with clear temporal
splits, minimizing the risk of information leakage. We then evaluate LLMs using
multiple prompting strategies, comparing task-scaffolded, persona-driven, and
hybrid approaches across model families. We assess both quantitative accuracy
and qualitative consistency over time. Results show that structured task
prompts consistently improve forecast stability, while persona prompts offer
advantages on short-term trends. However, performance varies significantly
across sectors and horizons, highlighting the need for domain-aware prompting
and rigorous evaluation protocols. By releasing our benchmark, we aim to
support future research on labor forecasting, prompt design, and LLM-based
economic reasoning. This work contributes to a growing body of research on how
LLMs interact with real-world economic data, and provides a reproducible
testbed for studying the limits and opportunities of AI as a forecasting tool
in the context of labor markets.

Motivation: 宗教语言在当代话语中持续存在，甚至在环境行动主义和气候变化辩论等表面上世俗的领域中也是如此。研究旨在了解宗教语言如何在世俗和宗教非政府组织的气候相关文本中显现。

Method: 采用双重方法：基于生态神学文献构建宗教术语层次树的规则模型，以及在零样本设置下运行的大型语言模型。使用包含88万多句子的数据集进行比较分析。

Result: 结果显示基于规则的方法比LLMs更一致地将句子标记为宗教语言。这突显了计算检测宗教语言的方法学挑战，以及宗教语言是否应仅由词汇定义还是由上下文意义定义的更广泛张力。

Conclusion: 本研究通过展示分析神圣在气候话语中持续存在的方法的潜力和局限性，为宗教研究中的数字方法做出了贡献。

Abstract: Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in
ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change
debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious
language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological
approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms
derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating
in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we
compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of
agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method
consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings
highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting
religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language
should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study
contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the
potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred
persists in climate discourse.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，提出的MoE框架超越了所有现有的时序预测模型，包括最新的基于MoE的方法。

Conclusion: 混合专家框架能够有效整合不同时序预测模型的优势，提供比单一模型更强大的预测性能。

Abstract: The immense success of the Transformer architecture
  in Natural Language Processing has led to its adoption in Time Se ries
Forecasting (TSF), where superior performance has been shown.
  However, a recent important paper questioned their effectiveness by
  demonstrating that a simple single layer linear model outperforms
  Transformer-based models. This was soon shown to be not as valid,
  by a better transformer-based model termed PatchTST. More re cently, TimeLLM
demonstrated even better results by repurposing a
  Large Language Model (LLM) for the TSF domain. Again, a follow
  up paper challenged this by demonstrating that removing the LLM
  component or replacing it with a basic attention layer in fact yields
  better performance. One of the challenges in forecasting is the fact
  that TSF data favors the more recent past, and is sometimes subject
  to unpredictable events. Based upon these recent insights in TSF, we
  propose a strong Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework. Our method
  combines the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models including xLSTM, en hanced
Linear, PatchTST, and minGRU, among others. This set of
  complimentary and diverse models for TSF are integrated in a Trans former
based MoE gating network. Our proposed model outperforms
  all existing TSF models on standard benchmarks, surpassing even the
  latest approaches based on MoE frameworks.

Conclusion: 该研究为通用多模态奖励建模迈出了重要一步，支持自由形式偏好，解决了现有奖励模型的局限性。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human
preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance,
where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering
limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference
Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the
complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above
challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward
modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation:
We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form
preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image,
video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal
preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K
instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We
propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative
RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other
widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单轮场景中的自信度，而在复杂多轮交互中LLM表达自信度的能力研究有限，需要探索模型在长序列动作后能否通过语言化自信分数来传达不确定性。

Method: 在开源代理模型上进行实验，提出测试时缩放方法，利用自信分数确定答案质量，鼓励模型在达到满意自信水平前重试。

Result: 实验发现模型在高自信度时任务准确率显著更高，低自信度时准确率接近零；提出的方法显著减少了token消耗，在性能上与基线固定预算方法相当。

Conclusion: LLM搜索代理能够在多轮交互中有效传达自信度，基于自信度的测试时缩放方法能够平衡性能和效率，为模型不确定性评估提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Confidence in LLMs is a useful indicator of model uncertainty and answer
reliability. Existing work mainly focused on single-turn scenarios, while
research on confidence in complex multi-turn interactions is limited. In this
paper, we investigate whether LLM-based search agents have the ability to
communicate their own confidence through verbalized confidence scores after
long sequences of actions, a significantly more challenging task compared to
outputting confidence in a single interaction. Experimenting on open-source
agentic models, we first find that models exhibit much higher task accuracy at
high confidence while having near-zero accuracy when confidence is low. Based
on this observation, we propose Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods that use
confidence scores to determine answer quality, encourage the model to try again
until reaching a satisfactory confidence level. Results show that our proposed
methods significantly reduce token consumption while demonstrating competitive
performance compared to baseline fixed budget TTS methods.

filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very
important for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length,
financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult.
Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive
labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial
targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for
stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per
share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual
reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using
the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this
corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models
(LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best
compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC
and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging
LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring
extensive labeled data.

*Tengchao Yang,Sichen Guo,Mengzhao Jia,Jiaming Su,Yuanyang Liu,Zhihan Zhang,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MMTutorBench是首个AI数学辅导基准，包含685个围绕关键教学步骤构建的问题，通过六个维度评估12个领先MLLM，发现专有与开源系统存在性能差距，OCR会降低辅导质量，基于量规的LLM评估高度可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准大多忽视了数学辅导所需的诊断学生困难和逐步指导的能力，而这是有效数学辅导的关键技能。

Method: 构建MMTutorBench基准，包含685个问题，每个问题配有特定量规，分为三个任务：洞察发现、操作制定和操作执行，评估12个领先MLLM。

Result: 专有与开源系统存在明显性能差距，与人类导师相比仍有很大提升空间，OCR会降低辅导质量，少量提示收益有限，基于量规的LLM评估高度可靠。

Conclusion: MMTutorBench既展示了AI数学辅导的难度，也证明了其诊断价值，为推进AI辅导系统发展提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also
diagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks
largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first
benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around
pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with
problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six
dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation
Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find
clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial
room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR
pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains,
and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results
highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for
advancing AI tutoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态事实核查数据集存在实例少、语言单一、证据泄露、依赖外部新闻源等问题，需要构建更全面的数据集来支持多任务多语言研究。

Method: 收集了22个专业事实核查机构验证的4,982张图像，对应6,980个声明，涵盖10种语言，设计了6个多模态事实核查任务。

Conclusion: M4FC是一个全面、多样化的多模态事实核查数据集，支持多语言多任务研究，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Existing real-world datasets for multimodal automated fact-checking have
multiple limitations: they contain few instances, focus on only one or two
languages and tasks, suffer from evidence leakage, or depend on external sets
of news articles for sourcing true claims. To address these shortcomings, we
introduce M4FC, a new real-world dataset comprising 4,982 images paired with
6,980 claims. The images, verified by professional fact-checkers from 22
organizations, represent diverse cultural and geographic contexts. Each claim
is available in one or two out of ten languages. M4FC spans six multimodal
fact-checking tasks: visual claim extraction, claimant intent prediction, fake
detection, image contextualization, location verification, and verdict
prediction. We provide baseline results for all tasks and analyze how combining
intermediate tasks influence downstream verdict prediction performance. We make
our dataset and code available.

*Jieyong Kim,Maryam Amirizaniani,Soojin Yoon,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了IPQA基准测试，用于评估个性化问答中的核心意图识别能力，发现现有模型在识别用户优先意图方面存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试只评估回答质量或检索性能，缺乏直接衡量意图识别能力的方法，而理解用户优先意图对于生成满足个性化信息需求的回答至关重要。

Method: 基于满意理论，从用户选择答案的可观察行为模式中推导核心意图，通过系统过滤、LLM标注和严格质量控制构建多领域数据集。

Result: 实验表明当前最先进的语言模型在个性化情境下难以识别核心意图，随着问题复杂度增加性能下降。

Conclusion: 需要开发更好的核心意图识别方法，IPQA基准测试和数据集将公开以促进该方向研究。

Abstract: Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate
responses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing
benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without
directly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical
because without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot
generate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we
introduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting
answers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we
propose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized
Question Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized
intents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer
selection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting
their acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains
through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality
control combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental
evaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems
struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail
to identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as
question complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly
available to facilitate future research in this direction.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIMRANK是一个使用少量合成数据训练的LLM重排序器，在BRIGHT和FollowIR基准测试中表现优异，仅需不到5%的传统训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大规模微调来适配LLM进行信息重排序，计算成本高昂。本文旨在证明现代LLM可以通过最小化高质量监督有效适配。

Method: 设计了LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER管道生成多样化、具有挑战性的合成重排序示例，并用此数据微调LIMRANK模型。

Result: LIMRANK在两个挑战性基准测试中达到竞争性性能，且训练数据量仅为先前工作的不到5%。消融研究验证了LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER的有效性和LIMRANK在下游任务中的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过高质量的合成数据，可以显著减少LLM重排序任务的训练数据需求，同时保持优异性能，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs
for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this
work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only
minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design
LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating
diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic
data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two
challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and
FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that
LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5%
of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate
the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization
capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific
literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive
problem solving.

*Luis Ramos,Hiram Calvo,Olga Kolesnikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了传统机器学习模型和微调transformer在希望语音检测任务上的表现，发现transformer模型在精度和召回率方面表现更好，特别是在小数据集上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别社交媒体上的希望语音已成为重要的NLP任务，需要检测具有动机性、目标导向行为的表达。

Method: 使用传统机器学习模型（SVM、逻辑回归、朴素贝叶斯）和微调的transformer模型，在预分割的希望语音数据集上进行评估。

Result: 传统模型中线性SVM和逻辑回归的macro-F1为0.78，transformer模型表现更好，最佳模型达到加权精度0.82、加权召回率0.80、加权F1 0.79、macro F1 0.79、准确率0.80。

Conclusion: 虽然优化配置的传统机器学习模型仍然灵活，但transformer架构能够检测希望语音的微妙语义，在小数据集上表现更好，表明大型transformer和LLM可能具有更好性能。

Abstract: The identification of hope speech has become a promised NLP task, considering
the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed
behaviour on social media platforms. This proposal evaluates traditional
machine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope
speech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a
linear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM
with RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models
delivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82,
weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80
accuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional
machine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some
subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech
detection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in
small datasets.

*Yizhu Jiao,Jiaqi Zeng,Julien Veron Vialard,Oleksii Kuchaiev,Jiawei Han,Olivier Delalleau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出BR-RM模型，将"三思而后行"原则应用于奖励建模，通过两轮思考减少判断扩散，提高对细微错误的敏感性，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型将多个质量维度压缩为单一标量，导致注意力分散和判断扩散，而大语言模型已证明二次思考能显著提升推理能力。

Method: 采用两轮思考机制：第一轮自适应分支选择关键维度并生成假设，第二轮执行分支条件化重新思考，验证假设并专注最重要内容。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的奖励建模基准测试中实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: BR-RM通过将一次性评分转换为聚焦的二次思考，有效减少判断扩散，提高对细微错误的敏感性，同时保持实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that
externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with
think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit
stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many
quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces
judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding
diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a
two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1
performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical
dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,
evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a
targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters
most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn
traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making
the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting
all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning,
BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet
consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code
and the model will be released soon.

*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了FUGU测试套件来诊断视觉语言模型在数据可视化理解任务中的失败原因，发现错误主要源于视觉-语言模块间的信息传递问题，而非视觉编码本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在基本的数据可视化理解任务上表现不佳，但失败原因尚不明确，需要系统性地诊断是视觉信息编码、模块间信息传递还是语言处理环节的问题。

Method: 开发FUGU测试套件，使用激活修补和线性探针技术追踪信息流，分析三种广泛使用的视觉语言模型在不同提示策略下的表现。

Result: 模型难以正确生成单个数据点坐标，但视觉编码器中实际包含正确的坐标信息；提供正确坐标能改善少量数据点任务，但会恶化需要统计关系的任务；微调也无法达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型存在架构限制，在可靠的数据可视化理解方面面临重大挑战，特别是视觉-语言模块间的信息传递问题。

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了一种成本效益高的自一致性框架，通过语义聚类和余弦相似度共识机制，提高视觉语言模型在农业图像描述中的可靠性，在PlantVillage数据集上取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决发展中国家农业病害管理面临的挑战：专家资源有限、网络连接不可靠、成本限制阻碍大规模AI系统部署。

Method: 使用轻量级预训练嵌入模型进行语义聚类，通过余弦相似度选择最一致的图像描述，并加入人机交互组件让用户确认作物类型以过滤错误生成。

Result: 在800张作物病害图像上测试，单聚类共识方法在10个候选生成时达到83.1%准确率，优于贪婪解码的77.5%；多聚类方法在前4个候选聚类中准确率可达94.0%。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提高了农业图像描述任务的可靠性，为资源受限环境下的农业病害管理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本到图像扩散模型生成高保真图像，但对输出的空间和几何结构控制有限，需要更精细的艺术控制方法。

Method: 开发了两种ControlNet模块：比例ControlNet基于边界框控制对象位置和比例，透视ControlNet基于消失线控制3D场景几何。使用视觉语言模型进行数据标注，并采用专门算法进行条件图像合成。

Result: 实验表明两种模块都提供了有效的控制，但在处理复杂约束时存在局限性。模型已在HuggingFace发布。

Conclusion: 提出的两种ControlNet为艺术控制提供了有效方法，但在复杂约束场景下仍有改进空间。

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

TL;DR: H2OFlow是一个无需人工标注、仅使用合成数据的3D人-物交互(HOI)理解框架，通过密集扩散过程学习3D流表示，全面建模接触、朝向和空间占用等交互特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖费时费力的人工标注数据集，且大多局限于接触分析，忽略了朝向偏好和空间占用等重要交互特征。

Method: 使用3D生成模型生成合成数据，通过密集扩散过程在点云上学习3D流表示，全面捕捉接触、朝向和空间占用信息。

Result: H2OFlow在定量和定性评估中表现出色，能够有效泛化到真实世界物体，超越依赖人工标注或网格表示的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了仅使用合成数据就能全面学习3D HOI affordances的可行性，为计算机视觉和机器人学提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在响应局部语义指令时存在面部属性泄漏和物理一致性不足的问题，需要开发能够保持面部ID和物理特征一致性的面部图像生成模型。

Method: 1. 构建包含约100万图像-文本-掩码对的大规模数据集FaceCaptionMask-1M；2. 使用通用文本到图像预训练模型作为骨干，引入3D面部渲染通道和全局面部特征通道；3. 制定语义对齐和感知损失两个优化目标。

Result: 大量实验表明，Face-MakeUpV2在保持面部ID和参考图像物理一致性方面实现了最佳整体性能。

Conclusion: Face-MakeUpV2在可靠和可控的面部编辑应用中具有实际潜力。

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

Motivation: 研究紧凑二进制人脸模板的长期稳定性，量化年龄变化对模板匹配性能的影响，为智能卡和片上匹配部署提供指导。

Method: 使用PCA-ITQ将现代人脸CNN的浮点嵌入压缩为64位和128位代码，对AgeDB中每个身份构建所有真实配对，拟合汉明距离与绝对年龄差的线性模型。

Result: 566个身份的中位数斜率：64位模板为1.357比特/十年，128位模板为2.571比特/十年，分布主要为正值，表明类内距离随时间系统性增加。

Conclusion: 较短代码在固定决策阈值下具有更好的年龄稳定性，建议采用定期重新注册和针对不稳定比特位的奇偶校验等简单缓解措施。

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

*Runchu Donga,Peng Zhao,Guiqin Wang,Nan Qi,Jie Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeSync是一种高效的边缘模型更新方法，通过改进样本过滤和动态训练管理，解决实时视频分析中模型精度下降和更新延迟的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频分析系统在边缘设备部署轻量模型以减少延迟，但数据特征分布随时间变化（如光照、天气条件）导致模型精度下降。现有方法面临计算密集的重新训练过程和模型与当前视频流数据分布不匹配的问题。

Method: EdgeSync通过结合时效性和推理结果来增强样本过滤，确保训练样本与当前视频内容更相关；同时采用动态训练管理模块优化模型更新的时间和顺序。

Result: 在多样复杂的真实世界数据集上的评估显示，EdgeSync相比现有方法准确率提升约3.4%，相比传统方法提升约10%。

Conclusion: EdgeSync通过高效的样本过滤和动态训练管理，显著提高了边缘模型在实时视频分析中的准确性和更新效率。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

*Emmanuel U. Ugwu,Zhang Xinming*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文首次全面评估了SAM2变体在火焰分割任务中的表现，重点关注边界框提示策略以提升部署可行性。研究发现边界框提示策略优于自动和单点方法，其中Box+MP组合在Khan数据集上获得最高性能（mIoU 0.64，Dice 0.75），轻量级变体更适合边缘部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火焰分割在计算机视觉中具有挑战性，因为火焰具有不规则边界、半透明边缘和高度变化的强度。虽然SAM和SAM2模型展示了出色的跨域泛化能力，但它们在火焰分割任务中的有效性，特别是在移动部署约束下的表现尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 系统评估了四种SAM2.1变体（tiny、small、base_plus、large）以及面向移动的变体（TinySAM、MobileSAM），在三个火焰数据集上使用多种提示策略：自动、单正点、单正点+单负点、多正点、边界框以及混合变体（Box+SP和Box+MP）。

Result: 边界框提示策略始终优于自动和单点方法，其中Box+MP在Khan数据集上获得最高平均IoU（0.64）和Dice系数（0.75）。轻量级变体如TinySAM和MobileSAM进一步降低了内存和计算成本，更适合延迟容忍的边缘场景。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在火焰监测系统中部署可提示分割模型提供了关键见解，并为未来领域特定SAM应用研究建立了基准。轻量级模型结合边界框提示策略在火焰分割任务中表现出色，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

*Guo Li,Yuyang Yu,Xuemiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种针对扩散模型的高效成员推理攻击方法，通过注入轻微噪声并评估噪声分布的聚合程度来区分训练集样本和非训练集样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）在生成高质量图像方面表现出强大性能，但其广泛使用也带来了隐私风险，特别是成员推理攻击，即试图确定特定数据样本是否用于模型训练过程。

Method: 基于注入轻微噪声并评估噪声分布聚合程度的方法。直觉是扩散模型对训练集样本和非训练集样本的噪声预测模式存在可区分差异：成员图像在扩散过程特定时间步的预测噪声呈现更高聚合性，而非成员图像则呈现更离散特性。该方法需要较少访问目标扩散模型。

Result: 实证结果表明，该方法在多个数据集上实现了优越性能。在面对大规模文本到图像扩散模型时，在ASR和AUC指标上也显示出更好的攻击效果，证明了方法的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的成员推理攻击方法高效且可扩展，能够有效识别扩散模型中的训练数据成员，为扩散模型的隐私风险评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种相机位姿估计的协方差下界计算方法，通过将可微分渲染器视为测量函数，在流形上线性化图像形成过程，推导出渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管位姿估计在计算机视觉和机器人领域应用广泛，但现有工作很少为密集或学习模型下的位姿提供严格的不确定性量化。

Method: 将可微分渲染器作为测量函数，在流形上对小的位姿扰动进行图像形成过程的线性化，从而推导出渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。

Result: 该方法可简化为经典的束调整不确定性，确保与视觉理论的连续性，并能自然地扩展到多智能体设置，通过融合多个相机的Fisher信息。

Conclusion: 这种统计公式在下游任务中具有应用价值，如协作感知和无需显式关键点对应关系的新视角合成。

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了AVEP（以动作为中心的视频事件预测）任务，构建了包含3.5万标注视频和17.8万视频片段的大型结构化数据集，并开发了基于节点图层次注意力的EventFormer模型，在复杂逻辑和语义信息的事件预测任务上超越了现有视频预测模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脚本事件归纳在NLP领域取得了显著成功，但人类事件大多以视频形式记录，视觉领域缺乏相关研究。现有视频预测任务缺乏复杂逻辑和丰富语义信息，需要开发新的任务和模型。

Method: 构建大型结构化视频事件数据集，提供细粒度多模态事件参数节点标注；提出EventFormer模型，采用节点图层次注意力机制，能够捕捉事件与参数之间的关系以及参数间的共指关系。

Result: 在AVEP任务上，EventFormer模型超越了多个SOTA视频预测模型和LVLMs，证明了任务的复杂性和数据集的价值。

Conclusion: AVEP任务填补了视觉领域事件预测研究的空白，提出的数据集和EventFormer模型为复杂逻辑的视频事件预测提供了有效解决方案，具有重要的研究价值和应用前景。

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的失配重建理论，用于解决多模光纤成像中测量矩阵未知时的图像重建问题。通过设计匹配和校准算法构建新测量矩阵，在低噪声水平下能成功重建原始图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模光纤成像需要测量值与测量矩阵严格匹配才能重建图像，但实际应用中由于系统配置未知或光纤弯曲后难以实时对准，导致传统重建算法失效。

Method: 提出失配方程，设计匹配和校准求解算法来构建新的测量矩阵，并提供了详细的方程和算法证明。

Result: 实验结果显示，在低噪声水平下，构建的矩阵可用于传统重建算法的匹配对，成功重建原始图像。算法对噪声、计算精度和正交性具有一定鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该理论解决了测量矩阵未知时的图像重建问题，具有实际应用价值，但存在一定局限性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D
image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore
quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost
without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into
selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data
fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide
recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion
quality.

Conclusion: MAFR为融合视觉和几何信息提供了原则性方法，提升了工业异常检测的稳健性和准确性。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D
and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a
novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

TL;DR: TITA是一个轻量级框架，通过冻结基础视觉语言模型并训练奖励模型来近似其分布，在推理时提取隐式偏好信号作为对数概率比，提供密集的自回归反馈以减少幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对齐方法依赖昂贵的微调或粗粒度的序列级推理策略，无法提供细粒度的即时反馈来有效减少视觉语言模型的幻觉问题。

Method: 冻结基础VLM，训练奖励模型近似其分布，在推理时提取奖励模型与目标VLM之间的对数概率比作为隐式偏好信号，提供token级的纠正信号。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B和13B上的12个基准测试中表现一致提升，MMVet提升8.6%，POPE提升6.7%，在Qwen2.5-VL-7B和DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B上也显示出可比较的增益，特别是在幻觉减少和VQA准确性方面，同时推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: TITA作为推理时直接偏好优化的变体，能够在不重新训练主干网络的情况下提供token级纠正信号，有效减少幻觉并提高多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型直接迁移语言模型架构，无法有效捕捉时间序列数据固有的多尺度时间依赖关系，特别是在零样本迁移到不同模式和采样策略的数据集时表现受限。

Method: 提出层次化交错块注意力(HIBA)，包含块内注意力促进局部信息交换，块间注意力捕捉全局时间模式交互和动态演化。基于此构建了参数规模从950万到15亿的Xihe模型家族。

Result: 在GIFT-Eval基准测试中，最小的Xihe-tiny模型(9.5M)超越多数现有TSFMs，展现卓越参数效率；最大的Xihe-max模型(1.5B)在零样本性能上大幅超越先前最佳结果，建立新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: HIBA架构具有出色的泛化能力和架构优势，在整个参数规模范围内都表现出持续优异的性能，证明了该方法在时间序列建模中的有效性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

Abstract: We explore the enhancement of Human-in-the-Loop video annotation by
integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA

### [135] [It Takes Two to Tango: Two Parallel Samplers Improve Quality in Diffusion Models for Limited Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21802)
*Pedro Cisneros-Velarde*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在有限去噪步骤下，使用两个并行采样器通过适当整合信息可以提升扩散模型生成图像的质量，该方法简单易用且无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对扩散模型在有限去噪步骤评估下的性能限制，探索如何通过并行处理提升采样质量。

Method: 使用两个并行采样器在连续时间进行去噪步骤，并适当整合它们的潜在图像信息。该方法为即插即用、模型无关且无需额外微调。

Result: 通过自动化和人工评估验证，该方法在不同扩散模型上均能提升样本质量。但发现简单整合信息会降低质量，且增加更多并行采样器不一定带来进一步改善。

Conclusion: 在有限计算预算下，两个并行采样器的适当信息整合是提升扩散模型采样质量的有效策略。

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

TL;DR: 本文提出FDA-CLIP框架，通过帧差生成动态区域掩码，引导模型关注关键动态区域，抑制静态冗余特征，提升文本-视频检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索方法依赖大规模标注数据且存在模态鸿沟问题，现有CLIP适配方法缺乏动态特征增强和静态冗余特征抑制能力。

Method: 使用帧差生成动态区域掩码作为Alpha通道输入Alpha-CLIP，主动引导模型关注语义关键动态区域。

Result: 实验表明帧差引导的视频语义编码能有效平衡检索效率和准确性。

Conclusion: FDA-CLIP框架通过动态区域关注机制成功解决了视频检索中的模态对齐问题。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为MPCC的新颖微调任务，通过遮挡图像重建来强制模型整合视觉上下文和常识推理，并开发了RFPS训练方法以提升模型在OOD和跨任务场景中的泛化推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理模型主要关注单模态语言任务，在多模态视觉语言任务中存在适应不足的问题，无法充分利用视觉上下文和常识知识，限制了在多模态环境中的推理泛化能力。

Method: 1. 提出MPCC微调任务：通过重建遮挡图像内容来整合视觉上下文和常识推理；2. 开发RFPS训练方法：强化微调与先验采样结合；3. 构建MPCC Eval评估基准系统评估泛化推理能力。

Conclusion: MPCC任务和RFPS方法为多模态推理提供了有效解决方案，能够显著提升模型在复杂视觉语言任务中的泛化推理能力。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出SRE-CLIP适配器框架，通过语义关系结构损失和跨模态对齐保持策略，解决DAZSL中CLIP模型的两个核心挑战，在I2AwA和I2WebV基准上实现最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据标注成本高昂，现有方法无法平衡跨域迁移和跨类别泛化，需要Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL)。虽然CLIP模型在DAZSL领域具有天然优势，但当前研究未能充分利用其潜力。

Method: 提出语义关系增强的CLIP适配器框架(SRE-CLIP)，包含语义关系结构损失和跨模态对齐保持策略，解决跨类别知识转移效率低和微调过程中跨模态对齐退化的问题。

Result: 作为首个基于CLIP的DAZSL方法，SRE-CLIP在I2AwA和I2WebV基准上实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRE-CLIP框架有效解决了DAZSL中的关键挑战，证明了CLIP模型在领域自适应零样本学习中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

Motivation: 当前多模态机器人导航系统趋向复杂黑盒化，可解释系统与高性能之间存在权衡，需要既能解释决策又保持高性能的方法。

Method: 将动作语言描述作为强化学习的辅助任务，利用预训练视觉语言模型进行知识蒸馏，解决缺乏真实描述数据的问题。

Result: 在各种导航任务中全面评估，既能描述动作又获得高导航性能，在语义视听导航任务中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了可解释性与性能的权衡问题，为可靠的多模态导航系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是糖尿病的主要并发症，在印度等糖尿病高发地区尤为严重。早期筛查至关重要，因为该疾病在初期阶段无症状，但可能导致不可逆的视力丧失。

Method: 采用混合诊断框架，结合传统手工特征提取和深度学习技术。手工特征捕捉关键临床标记，而深度学习自动化分层模式识别，两者协同工作。

Conclusion: 这种混合方法能够实现可扩展、准确的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查，对于糖尿病负担重的地区具有重要意义。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

Result: YOLOv11表现最优，平均准确率比其他方法高70%，在检测微小表面缺陷方面更快更高效。

Conclusion: YOLOv11在NEU数据集上的表面缺陷检测任务中表现卓越，在准确性和速度方面均大幅超越其他竞争算法，是最有效的模型。

Abstract: This article compares the performance of six prominent object detection
algorithms, YOLOv11, RetinaNet, Fast R-CNN, YOLOv8, RT-DETR, and DETR, on the
NEU-DET surface defect detection dataset, comprising images representing
various metal surface defects, a crucial application in industrial quality
control. Each model's performance was assessed regarding detection accuracy,
speed, and robustness across different defect types such as scratches,
inclusions, and rolled-in scales. YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art real-time object
detection algorithm, demonstrated superior performance compared to the other
methods, achieving a remarkable 70% higher accuracy on average. This
improvement can be attributed to YOLOv11s enhanced feature extraction
capabilities and ability to process the entire image in a single forward pass,
making it faster and more efficient in detecting minor surface defects.
Additionally, YOLOv11's architecture optimizations, such as improved anchor box
generation and deeper convolutional layers, contributed to more precise
localization of defects. In conclusion, YOLOv11's outstanding performance in
accuracy and speed solidifies its position as the most effective model for
surface defect detection on the NEU dataset, surpassing competing algorithms by
a substantial margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地球观测基础模型需要额外适配，且结构僵化。受大语言模型启发，希望通过统一序列框架简化EO数据的处理。

Method: 使用GPT风格解码器架构，通过符号提示实现多任务处理，无需特定任务或模态的适配。

Result: 在作物类型分类任务(PASTIS-R)上优于更大的EO基础模型，证明密集时间序列建模的重要性。

Conclusion: 展示了数据为中心的方法，能力来自训练数据的多样性和结构而非架构复杂性，为未来生成式EO基础模型提供了概念桥梁。

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GestureGPT解决方案在识别准确性和响应时间方面存在局限，需要开发更高效的自由手势理解系统来改善人机交互体验。

Method: 使用预训练大视觉语言模型对齐手势与语义概念；引入手部关键点处理模块嵌入解剖学先验知识；采用链式思维推理策略进行逐步语义推理。

Result: Gestura实现了稳健且适应性强的自由手势理解能力，并创建了首个包含30万标注问答对的开源自由手势意图推理数据集。

Conclusion: Gestura通过结合LVLM、手部先验知识和CoT推理，显著提升了自由手势理解的性能，为人机交互提供了更自然高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Abstract: This study examines the prompt fidelity of ChatGPT4o / DALL-E3 text-to-image
visualisations by analysing whether attributes explicitly specified in
autogenously generated prompts are correctly rendered in the resulting images.
Using two public-domain datasets comprising 200 visualisations of women working
in the cultural and creative industries and 230 visualisations of museum
curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair),
appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While
correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications
in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia,
moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person
themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable
prompt-to-image fidelity gaps with implications for bias detection and model
evaluation.

Motivation: GAN生成图像的检测在数字图像取证中面临重大挑战，需要开发有效的方法来区分真实图像和GAN生成图像。

Method: 使用离散小波变换(DWT)预处理，应用Haar和Daubechies小波滤波器将图像转换为多分辨率表示，然后输入ResNet50网络进行分类，利用生成过程中留下的细微伪影。

Result: Haar和Daubechies预处理模型的准确率分别达到93.8%和95.1%，显著高于空间域模型(81.5%)，Daubechies模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: GAN生成图像在小波域具有独特的伪影或"指纹"，小波域分析对检测GAN图像非常有效，为未来深度伪造检测系统的开发提供了潜力。

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

Result: DenseNet121表现优于ResNet50：脑肿瘤检测准确率94.3% vs 92.5%，肺炎检测准确率89.1% vs 84.4%。Grad-CAM显示DenseNet121更专注于核心病理区域。

Conclusion: 结合深度学习和可解释AI为开发可靠、可解释且临床有用的诊断工具提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging
diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase
analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially.
However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种结合低秩Transformer和基于流的生成模型的新框架，用于处理不完整多模态医疗数据的生存分析，通过类别特定流实现跨模态分布对齐，提高重建数据与真实分布的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界医疗数据集中常存在模态不完整问题，现有方法直接通过深度神经网络推断缺失模态，但忽略了模态间的分布差异，导致重建结果不一致且不可靠。

Method: 使用类别特定流进行跨模态分布对齐，在类别标签条件下建模和转换跨模态分布；设计轻量级Transformer架构建模模态内依赖关系，通过低秩Transformer缓解高维模态融合中的过拟合问题。

Result: 在完整模态设置下达到最先进性能，在不完整模态场景下仍保持稳健且优越的准确性。

Conclusion: 所提框架能有效处理多模态医疗生存分析中的模态缺失问题，通过分布一致的潜在空间构建和轻量级Transformer设计，实现了稳健和灵活的多模态生存预测。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了三种垃圾图像分类方法：传统机器学习、深度学习以及混合方法。实验表明，混合方法（深度学习特征提取+传统分类器）在三个公开数据集上表现最佳，准确率高达100%，同时通过特征选择减少95%特征维度而不损失精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化垃圾图像分类是全球废物管理的关键组成部分，但目前缺乏整合机器学习、深度学习和高效混合解决方案的系统性基准。

Method: 比较三种范式：(1) 基于手工特征的机器学习算法；(2) 深度学习架构（ResNet变体和EfficientNetV2S）；(3) 混合方法（深度模型特征提取+传统分类器如SVM和逻辑回归）。在三个公开数据集上进行实验。

Result: 混合方法在三个数据集上表现最佳：TrashNet和精炼家庭垃圾数据集达到100%准确率，垃圾分类数据集达到99.87%，超越了现有最佳基准。特征选择减少95%以上特征维度，同时保持精度。

Conclusion: 本研究为废物分类建立了更可靠的基准，并提出了高效的混合框架，在降低推理成本的同时实现高精度，适合在资源受限环境中进行可扩展部署。

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for
scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

*Pragna Prahallad,Pranathi Prahallad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估GPT-4o在零样本设置下对胸部X光图像进行正常/肺炎分类的能力，发现简洁的特征导向提示可获得74%准确率，但诊断可靠性仍有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在医学图像分类中的零样本能力，特别是评估GPT-4o在胸部X光诊断中的潜力，无需专门微调。

Method: 使用包含400张图像（正常和肺炎各200张）的平衡测试集，在零样本设置下测试四种不同提示设计：从最小指令到详细推理提示。

Result: 简洁的特征导向提示获得最高分类准确率74%，而推理导向提示表现较差。模型显示出医学图像解释的潜力，但诊断可靠性有限。

Conclusion: 虽然ChatGPT在医学图像解释方面显示出潜力，但在安全应用于临床实践前，仍需在视觉推理和领域特定适应方面持续改进。

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视频生成模型虽然视觉上逼真，但缺乏物理理解能力，经常产生不合理的视频。研究表明SSL预训练可以产生直观物理理解，因此探索能否利用SSL视频世界模型来改进视频生成模型的物理合理性。

Method: 在MAGI-1视频生成模型基础上，结合VJEPA-2架构，使用VJEPA-2作为奖励信号来指导生成过程。

Result: 通过VJEPA-2作为奖励信号，成功将最先进视频生成模型的物理合理性提高了约6%。

Conclusion: SSL视频世界模型可以有效提升视频生成模型的物理合理性，为构建更符合物理规律的内容生成系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RatioWaveNet在TCFormer时序CNN-Transformer骨干网络上增加了可训练的理性小波变换前端，通过多分辨率子带分解提升运动想象脑机接口的鲁棒性，特别是在最难分类的受试者上表现显著改善。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于运动想象的脑机接口面临非平稳性、低信噪比和个体差异等挑战，特别是在非侵入式EEG信号解码中可靠性不足。研究旨在测试小波变换前端是否能提升BCI在最困难受试者上的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用理性小波变换前端进行多分辨率子带分解，保持时间长度和移位不变性；通过轻量级分组1-D卷积融合子带，使用多核CNN提取局部时空特征，分组查询注意力编码器获取长程上下文，紧凑TCN头进行因果时间整合。

Result: 在BCI-IV-2a和BCI-IV-2b数据集上，RatioWaveNet相比Transformer骨干网络在最差受试者准确率上分别提升0.17/0.42和1.07/2.54个百分点，平均性能也有稳定增益，计算开销适中。

Conclusion: 可训练的小波变换前端是增强基于Transformer的BCI的有效插件，能在不牺牲效率的情况下改善最差情况下的可靠性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

TL;DR: 模态失语症：统一多模态模型在视觉记忆上表现准确，但在文字表达上失败的系统性分离现象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究当前统一多模态模型存在的系统性缺陷，即模型能够准确记忆视觉概念但无法用文字正确表达，这揭示了模型在不同模态间理解的不一致性

Method: 通过实验验证前沿模型在生成电影艺术作品时的视觉准确性与文字描述的混淆，并在多个架构的合成数据集上进行受控实验

Result: 模态失语症是当前统一多模态模型的基本属性而非训练伪影，模型在文本模态对齐后仍能生成不安全图像，存在AI安全漏洞

Conclusion: 模态失语症揭示了多模态模型的内在局限性，对AI安全框架构成威胁，需要在多模态层面进行全面对齐

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCoPE VLM是一个用于长文档导航的视觉语言模型，通过链式滚动机制选择性浏览文档相关片段，大幅降低内存使用并模拟人类阅读行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理长上下文视觉信息时存在挑战，特别是在GUI控制和网页导航等代理任务中，忽视了决策导向的文档理解，且现有方法内存消耗大，难以本地部署。

Method: 提出链式滚动机制选择性递归导航文档，引入专用数据生成管道构建信息丰富的滚动轨迹，以及针对性的强化学习方法Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization来缩小训练与推理差距。

Result: 该方法显著降低了内存使用，有效模拟了人类阅读行为，是首个在多页文档问答中明确建模代理阅读模式的框架。

Conclusion: SCoPE VLM通过创新的链式滚动机制和优化方法，提升了多模态代理在长文档理解方面的能力，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge
for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control
and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently
structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT)方法，使Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM)能够独立训练，无需依赖预训练的PFGM++模型，并在CT图像去噪任务中取得了良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PFCM原本只能通过蒸馏方式训练，这限制了其在多种数据模态中的应用潜力。本研究旨在开发一种独立训练PFCM的方法。

Method: 利用扰动核去除对预训练PFGM++的依赖，引入正弦离散化调度和Beta噪声分布来提升适应性和样本质量。

Result: 在低剂量CT图像去噪任务中，模型在LPIPS和SSIM指标上改善了图像质量，去噪效果与Consistency Model等模型相当。

Conclusion: PFCT被证明是训练PFCM的有效方法，为生成建模领域提供了更灵活的训练框架，具有与其他生成模型竞争的性能。

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种三阶段混合框架，使用现代检测和视觉语言模型自动解释2D多视图工程图，解决了传统方法在复杂布局、方向和混合符号文本内容方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程图纸是制造通信的基础，但手动方法、通用OCR系统或传统深度学习方法在解释具有密集注释的复杂多视图图纸时存在困难，主要由于布局多变、方向不同以及符号文本混合内容。

Method: 三阶段混合框架：第一阶段使用YOLOv11-det进行布局分割定位关键区域；第二阶段使用YOLOv11-obb进行方向感知的细粒度注释检测；第三阶段使用两个基于Donut的OCR-free VLM进行语义内容解析。

Result: 开发了两个专门数据集：1,000张图纸用于布局检测，1,406张用于注释级训练。Alphabetical VLM总体F1得分为0.672，Numerical VLM达到0.963，分别在文本和定量解释方面表现良好。

Conclusion: 统一的JSON输出实现了与CAD和制造数据库的无缝集成，为智能工程图纸分析提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving
as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production
details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense
annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character
recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to
varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the
automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern
detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det
performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title
blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,
fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and
surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free
VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and
categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM
interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface
roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and
generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for
annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of
0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance
in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON
output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases,
providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

TL;DR: LSF-Animation是一个无需显式情感和身份标签的语音驱动3D面部动画框架，通过隐式提取语音中的情感信息和中性面部网格中的身份特征，实现了对未见说话者和情感状态的更好泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式one-hot编码来表示身份和情感，限制了泛化能力，且忽略了语音中固有的情感线索，导致生成动画的自然度和适应性受限。

Method: 提出LSF-Animation框架，隐式提取语音情感信息和中性面部网格身份特征；引入分层交互融合块(HIFB)，使用融合令牌集成双变换器特征，更有效地整合情感、运动和身份线索。

Result: 在3DMEAD数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在情感表现力、身份泛化和动画真实感方面超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: LSF-Animation通过消除对显式情感和身份特征表示的依赖，实现了更好的泛化能力和更自然的动画效果，为语音驱动的3D面部动画提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban
planning, effective environmental monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of
climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate
technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the
lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for
estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically
computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed
methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can
foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and
healthier future.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive
modeling, exemplified by models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational
framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of
CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones.
TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules,
preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency
computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TernaryCLIP can
achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98
$\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$
storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while
maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and
image-text retrieval tasks across 41 commonly used datasets. Our work
highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models,
supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning based generative models, particularly
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and
Diffusion Models (DMs), have been instrumental in in generating diverse,
high-quality content across various domains, such as image and video synthesis.
This capability has led to widespread adoption of these models and has captured
strong public interest. As they continue to advance at a rapid pace, the
growing volume of research, expanding application areas, and unresolved
technical challenges make it increasingly difficult to stay current. To address
this need, this survey introduces a comprehensive taxonomy that organizes the
literature and provides a cohesive framework for understanding the development
of GANs, VAEs, and DMs, including their many variants and combined approaches.
We highlight key innovations that have improved the quality, diversity, and
controllability of generated outputs, reflecting the expanding potential of
generative artificial intelligence. In addition to summarizing technical
progress, we examine rising ethical concerns, including the risks of misuse and
the broader societal impact of synthetic media. Finally, we outline persistent
challenges and propose future research directions, offering a structured and
forward looking perspective for researchers in this fast evolving field.

*Dogyun Park,Moayed Haji-Ali,Yanyu Li,Willi Menapace,Sergey Tulyakov,Hyunwoo J. Kim,Aliaksandr Siarohin,Anil Kag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPRINT是一种高效的扩散变换器训练方法，通过分层token丢弃策略（浅层处理所有token，深层只处理稀疏子集）和残差融合，实现了高达75%的token丢弃率，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器(DiTs)在生成性能上表现优异，但其二次训练成本随序列长度增加而急剧上升，使得大规模预训练成本过高。现有的token丢弃方法要么参数过多，要么在高丢弃率下表现不佳。

Method: SPRINT采用稀疏-密集残差融合策略：浅层处理所有token以捕捉局部细节，深层只处理稀疏token子集以减少计算，通过残差连接融合输出。采用两阶段训练：长时掩码预训练提高效率，短时全token微调缩小训练-推理差距。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，SPRINT实现了9.8倍的训练节省，同时保持相当的FID/FDD指标。在推理时，其路径丢弃指导(PDG)几乎将FLOPs减半，同时提升生成质量。

Conclusion: SPRINT为高效DiT训练提供了一个简单、有效且通用的解决方案，能够在保持生成质量的同时大幅降低计算成本。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance
but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale
pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as
a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Lite-Diff是一种轻量级扩散模型微调方法，通过冻结基础模型权重并优化小型残差适配器模块，显著降低计算开销并防止过拟合，特别适用于医学影像等数据稀缺领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成方面表现出色，但在医学影像等专业领域微调面临挑战：领域特定数据有限，完整模型适配计算成本高。

Method: 在冻结的扩散U-Net中集成轻量级适配层，结合潜在形态自编码器（用于领域特定潜在一致性）和像素级判别器（用于对抗对齐）增强训练。

Result: 在三个胸部X射线数据集上的实验表明，Lite-Diff相比完整微调实现了更优的适配效率。

Conclusion: 该框架为扩散模型中的迁移学习提供了有前景的方向，促进了其在各种低数据领域的部署。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

TL;DR: FlowOpt是一个零阶优化框架，将整个流匹配过程视为黑盒，无需反向传播即可优化整个采样路径，实现了高效的图像编辑控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流匹配模型在测试时进行控制生成任务时，由于采样过程的迭代性质，基于梯度的优化计算成本过高，现有方法只能分别处理每个时间步。

Method: 提出零阶优化框架FlowOpt，将流过程视为黑盒，通过整个采样路径进行优化而无需反向传播，允许监控中间结果和提前停止。

Result: 在图像编辑任务中，FlowOpt实现了最先进的结果，同时使用的神经网络函数评估次数与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: FlowOpt提供了一种高效且实用的方法来解决流匹配模型中的控制生成问题，具有理论保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

Abstract: Sign languages play a crucial role in the communication of deaf communities,
but they are often marginalized, limiting access to essential services such as
healthcare and education. This study proposes an automatic sign language
recognition system based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, using Mediapipe for
gesture keypoint extraction. Developed with Python, TensorFlow and Streamlit,
the system provides real-time gesture translation. The results show an average
accuracy of 92\%, with very good performance for distinct gestures such as
``Hello'' and ``Thank you''. However, some confusions remain for visually
similar gestures, such as ``Call'' and ``Yes''. This work opens up interesting
perspectives for applications in various fields such as healthcare, education
and public services.

Motivation: 解决机器学习模型鲁棒性不足的问题，特别是在计算机视觉任务中，当虚假特征和显著特征在像素空间中重叠时，传统的显著性图方法可能会产生误导性解释。

Method: 采用新颖的网络手术方法，将待解释的独立模型集成到对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）模型中，创建基于字幕的XAI模型来识别主导概念。

Result: 该方法能够识别对模型预测贡献最大的主导概念，最小化独立模型因协变量偏移而误判的风险。

Conclusion: 基于字幕的XAI方法为开发更鲁棒的机器学习模型提供了重要贡献，能够有效避免传统显著性图方法的局限性。

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

*Hyeonsu Kang,Emily Bao,Anjan Goswami*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了VLM-SlideEval评估框架，用于测试视觉语言模型在幻灯片理解方面的能力，发现现有模型在像素级元素提取和跨幻灯片叙事结构理解方面表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型越来越多地用于评估多模态内容（包括演示文稿幻灯片），但它们在幻灯片特定理解方面的能力尚未得到充分探索，特别是在作为代理流程中批评者的角色时。

Method: 开发了VLM-SlideEval评估框架，从三个维度测试VLMs：(1) 元素级提取与真实标注对齐；(2) 对几何、样式和文本扰动的鲁棒性；(3) 高层次理解，如从乱序幻灯片中恢复叙事顺序。使用Zenodo公开数据集，通过PowerPoint XML和实时渲染标准化真实元素元数据。

Result: 实验表明，VLMs在像素级精确提取方面表现不佳，在受控扰动下显示出非平凡的协议性、保真度和一致性，在单幻灯片内容理解方面表现较好，但无法可靠地捕捉跨幻灯片的叙事结构。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在幻灯片评估方面存在局限性，需要开发经过校准的、批评者在环的评估器，以驱动代理流程中的迭代优化和选择。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal
content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding
remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic,
model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework
that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide
images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in
geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as
recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly
available decks from Zenodo
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we
standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live
renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop
evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个结合人体检测跟踪和时空建模的深度学习框架，用于监控视频中的多类异常检测，在UCF-Crime数据集上达到92.41%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决监控视频异常检测面临的挑战：异常事件多样性、类别不平衡和场景相关的视觉干扰。

Method: 使用YOLO-World进行人体检测，ByteTrack进行身份跟踪，高斯模糊抑制背景，InceptionV3提取空间特征，双向LSTM建模时序动态。

Result: 在UCF-Crime五类子集上平均测试准确率92.41%，各类别F1分数均超过0.85，表现出良好的泛化能力和对类别不平衡的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 前景聚焦的预处理方法显著提升了真实监控场景中的异常识别能力。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

*Zheng Qi,Chao Shang,Evangelia Spiliopoulou,Nikolaos Pappas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为GIFT的方法，通过跟踪视觉注意力的积极变化来预计算整体视觉显著性图，从而减少视觉语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要归因于视觉语言模型过度依赖语言先验知识而非视觉输入，且忽视了视觉注意力下沉问题（注意力被错误分配到任务无关的视觉区域）和跨模态融合平衡问题。

Method: GIFT方法通过跟踪用户查询理解过程中的视觉注意力变化（"凝视转移"）来预计算整体视觉显著性图，并在每个解码步骤中放大对显著视觉信息和用户查询的注意力。

Result: 实验表明GIFT在生成和分类任务中有效减少了视觉语言模型的幻觉，相比贪婪解码提高了20.7%，同时保持了良好的视觉语言性能且计算开销低。

Conclusion: GIFT方法通过解决视觉注意力下沉和跨模态融合不平衡问题，有效减轻了视觉语言模型的幻觉现象。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的3D T1加权脑MRI图像协调框架，通过解耦解剖内容和扫描器/站点特异性变化，减少多中心研究中的变异性，提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI扫描器型号、采集协议和成像站点的差异导致多中心研究分析不一致和泛化性差，需要一种方法来协调这些变异性。

Method: 基于结构相似性指数(SSIM)的可微分损失函数框架，分离评估图像亮度、对比度和结构组件，使用多风格目标进行协调训练。

Result: 协调后结构SSIM达0.97，亮度SSIM达0.98-0.99，Wasserstein距离显著降低；脑年龄预测误差从5.36年降至3.30年，阿尔茨海默病分类AUC从0.78提升至0.85。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了跨站点图像一致性，保持了解剖保真度，改善了下游模型性能，为大规模多中心神经影像研究提供了稳健且可泛化的解决方案。

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型在坐标预测方面存在困难，特别是在高分辨率输入时，位置编码失效导致方向性偏差。作者通过扰动视觉位置编码分析这种偏差，并提出VPSG方法进行校正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但在精确坐标预测方面存在挑战。高分辨率输入会产生长token序列，削弱位置编码并引入坐标输出的方向性偏差。

Method: 通过故意扰乱视觉位置编码来分析模型行为，发现扰动会诱导可预测的非随机坐标偏差。提出Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG)方法，这是一种无需训练的在测试时使用的方法，利用方向性偏差进行校正。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上的实验表明，VPSG方法能够可靠地改善坐标预测性能，证明了位置编码鲁棒性对MLLMs空间推理的重要性。

Conclusion: 位置编码失效是精确坐标预测的关键瓶颈，提高位置编码的鲁棒性对于MLLMs的空间推理能力至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

TL;DR: Rainbow是一个条件图像生成框架，通过将输入条件分解为多样化的潜在表示来生成多样化的图像，解决了条件不确定性带来的多输出问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通过修改随机种子或多样化输入提示来生成多样图像，但难以区分有意义的差异或受限于语言可解释的多样性。需要一种能处理条件不确定性并生成多样化合理图像的方法。

Method: 在提示表示计算中集成潜在图（由GFlowNets参数化），利用GFlowNets的高级图采样能力捕获不确定性并生成多样化轨迹，从而产生多样化的条件表示和输出图像。

Result: 在自然图像和医学图像数据集上的评估显示，Rainbow在图像合成、生成和反事实生成任务中，在多样性和保真度方面均有改进。

Conclusion: Rainbow框架能有效处理条件不确定性，生成多样化且高质量的图像，适用于任何预训练的条件生成模型。

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Conclusion: GRAID框架能够生成高质量的空间推理训练数据，显著提升视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，并具有良好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated
accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work.
% or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data,
models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6
question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\%
on BDD and 37.9\% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all

TL;DR: CogStereo是一个新颖的立体匹配框架，通过嵌入隐式空间认知来改进具有挑战性的区域（如遮挡或弱纹理），无需依赖数据集特定先验，实现了卓越的零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度立体匹配方法在基准数据集上表现良好，但在零样本泛化方面不如其他视觉任务中的基础模型，特别是在遮挡、弱纹理等挑战性区域表现不足。

Method: CogStereo将单目深度特征作为先验嵌入到细化过程中，采用双条件细化机制，结合像素级不确定性和认知引导特征，实现结构一致的视差估计。

Result: 在Scene Flow、KITTI、Middlebury、ETH3D、EuRoc和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，CogStereo不仅达到了最先进的结果，而且在跨域泛化方面表现出色。

Conclusion: CogStereo将立体视觉推向认知驱动的方法，即使在几何信息不足的区域也能实现结构一致的视差估计，展现了卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided
features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments
on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that
CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in
cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven
approach.

*Wenxuan Bao,Ruxi Deng,Jingrui He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型在输入损坏时的表现，发现嵌入方差崩溃现象，并提出Mint方法通过最大化伪标签的类间方差来提升模型在损坏数据上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型如CLIP在零样本泛化方面表现良好，但对输入损坏引起的分布偏移很脆弱。本文旨在理解损坏如何影响CLIP的图像嵌入，并找到提升其鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 首先分析了损坏对嵌入空间的影响，发现了嵌入方差崩溃现象。然后提出Mint方法，这是一种测试时自适应方法，通过均值累加器和梯度累加器实时最大化基于伪标签的类间方差。

Result: Mint方法在多个损坏基准测试和CLIP架构上都能有效提升性能，特别是在小批量大小下也能稳定工作。

Conclusion: 嵌入方差崩溃是CLIP在损坏数据上性能下降的关键原因，通过最大化类间方差可以有效提升嵌入质量和模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

*Matthias Jammot,Bjöern Braun,Paul Streli,Rafael Wampfler,Christian Holz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了egoEMOTION数据集，这是首个结合自我中心视觉和生理信号与密集情绪和人格自我报告的数据集，包含50多小时来自43名参与者的记录，定义了三个基准任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自我中心视觉基准主要忽略影响人类决策和行为的情绪状态，限制了视觉系统捕捉行为关键内部驱动因素的能力。

Method: 使用Meta的Project Aria眼镜记录同步眼动追踪视频、头戴式光电容积描记、惯性运动数据和生理基线，参与者完成情绪诱发任务和自然活动，使用环状模型和Mikels轮进行情绪自我报告，使用大五模型进行人格评估。

Result: 基于经典学习方法在真实世界情绪预测中，从自我中心视觉系统捕获的信号比处理生理信号产生更好的估计。

Conclusion: 该数据集确立了情绪和人格作为自我中心感知的核心维度，为基于情绪的行为、意图和交互建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

TL;DR: STG-Avatar是一个基于3DGS的高保真可动画人体化身重建框架，通过刚性-非刚性耦合变形框架结合时空高斯和线性混合蒙皮，解决了非刚性物体细节和动态区域准确表示的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从单目视频创建逼真的可动画人体化身对于推进人机交互和增强沉浸式虚拟体验至关重要。现有3DGS方法在表示非刚性物体细节和动态区域方面仍存在困难。

Method: 提出刚性-非刚性耦合变形框架，将时空高斯与线性混合蒙皮协同集成。LBS驱动全局姿态变换实现实时骨骼控制，STG通过时空自适应优化3D高斯进行补充。使用光流识别高动态区域并指导3D高斯的自适应密集化。

Conclusion: STG-Avatar框架成功解决了3DGS基人体化身在非刚性变形和动态区域表示方面的挑战，为高保真可动画人体化身重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for
advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences.
While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在开放集挑战中取得进展，但3D数据集有限限制了其在3D场景理解中的应用。

Method: 提出LOC框架，融合多帧LiDAR点云进行泊松重建，使用KNN为体素分配语义，引入密集对比学习(DCL)缓解特征同质化问题。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实现高性能，对已知类别进行高精度预测，并能区分未知类别而无需额外训练数据。

Conclusion: LOC框架有效解决了3D场景理解中的数据限制问题，通过语言引导和对比学习实现了强大的开放集识别能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

Motivation: 现有源自由域自适应方法主要关注域偏移，但忽略了负迁移问题，这会阻碍模型在自适应过程中的性能提升。

Method: 使用注意力机制捕获目标对象的判别区域，将注意力特征分解为空间和通道注意力实现跨层注意力残差融合和自蒸馏；通过对比全局和局部表示提升类别感知能力；采用动态质心评估策略评估可信质心和标签。

Result: 在五个不同规模的基准测试上进行了全面实验，结果表明该方法超越了其他技术，在SFDA基准上取得了优越性能。

Conclusion: ARFNet框架通过注意力残差融合、对比学习和动态质心评估有效缓解了源自由域自适应中的负迁移和域偏移问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: I2-NeRF是一个新颖的神经辐射场框架，通过反向分层上采样策略和统一的辐射传输公式，在媒体退化条件下增强等距和各向同性度量感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF模型主要依赖物体中心采样，缺乏对3D空间中均匀采样的关注，无法在媒体退化条件下保持等距和各向同性的度量感知。

Method: 提出反向分层上采样策略实现近均匀3D空间采样，建立统一的辐射传输公式将发射、吸收和散射统一到受Beer-Lambert衰减定律控制的粒子模型中。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比现有方法显著提高了重建保真度和物理合理性，并能估计介质属性如水深。

Conclusion: I2-NeRF通过创新的采样策略和辐射传输建模，成功提升了在复杂媒体环境下的3D物理世界感知能力，为生成AI的物理感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: 联合利用模型内部信念和输出概率分布能显著提升不确定性估计性能，为视觉语言模型的可靠部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

Method: 基于空间非平稳性、低层规律性和高层语义三个原则，从局部上下文窗口定义每个像素的分布，构建非参数生成模型。

Result: 在MNIST上生成高保真样本，在CIFAR-10上生成视觉上令人信服的图像，无需训练即可实现。

Conclusion: 该模型的简单性和强大性能指向自然图像结构的最小理论，其白盒特性有助于理解生成模型的泛化机制和组合式推理过程。

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架和模型在建筑工地轨迹预测方面显著优于传统方法，为开发更有效的碰撞避免系统提供了有力支持。

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.
TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3
m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both
workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m).
Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing
ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in
both visual quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

TL;DR: 提出UniPAN方法，通过统一分布策略增强全色锐化模型的泛化能力，解决不同卫星传感器数据分布差异导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习全色锐化模型在训练数据上表现优异，但由于传感器特性和成像条件差异，在未见卫星数据上性能显著下降，缺乏泛化性。

Method: 构建分布变换函数，将不同来源的像素归一化到相同分布，在变换域上训练模型，测试时也将新数据变换到训练分布。

Result: 大量实验验证了UniPAN的有效性，显著提升了深度全色锐化模型在不同卫星传感器上的性能。

Conclusion: UniPAN通过统一训练和测试分布，增强了模型的泛化能力，为实现"一次训练，永久部署"提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义分割需要密集像素级标注，成本高昂，特别是在标注预算极低的情况下，需要开发高效的主动学习方法。

Method: 两阶段选择流程：第一阶段使用MaxHerding进行分层候选选择，构建多样化全局池；第二阶段计算熵增强分歧评分(eDALD)来选择最具信息量的像素进行标注。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在极端像素预算情况下显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过解耦多样性和不确定性，该方法能够在仅使用少量标注像素的情况下实现高分割精度。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决传统车道检测方法在复杂场景下特征表示不足的问题，利用扩散模型的生成能力提升车道检测的准确性和泛化能力。

Method: 1) 在真实车道参数上添加高斯噪声获得噪声车道锚点，模型学习逐步去噪；2) 提出混合扩散解码器结合全局和局部解码器；3) 训练阶段使用辅助头增强编码器监督。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优异：Carlane领域自适应数据集上超越现有方法至少1%准确率；CULane上F1得分81.32%；Tusimple上准确率96.89%；LLAMAS上F1得分97.59%。

Conclusion: DiffusionLane具有强大的泛化能力和有前景的检测性能，在多个数据集上超越了现有最先进方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and
97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer
vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while
operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we
present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation
leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained
Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The
model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision
on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while
enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were
applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip
connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable
and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our
implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second
(FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate
the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and
off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for
implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time
applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power
efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. The code for this project is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的交通事故预测范式，将预测目标从当前帧风险评分转向直接估计多个未来时间步的事故分数，利用精确标注的事故时间戳作为监督，解决了现有方法依赖模糊二元监督的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事故预测方法通常预测帧级风险分数作为危险指标，但这些方法依赖于模糊的二元监督（将所有事故视频帧标记为正样本），而实际上风险随时间连续变化，这导致不可靠的学习和误报。

Method: 采用片段级编码器联合建模空间和时间动态，以及基于Transformer的时间解码器，使用专用时间查询同时预测所有未来时间范围的事故分数。

Result: 实验表明，在现实误报率约束下，该方法在召回率和事故时间预测方面均实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的新范式通过直接预测未来事故分数，结合精确的时间监督和合理的评估协议，显著提升了事故预测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

Motivation: 空中-地面行人重识别面临极端视角差异、遮挡和域差距等挑战，现有方法在处理严重姿态变化和空间错位方面存在局限。

Method: 提出GSAlign网络，包含可学习薄板样条模块（LTPS）用于几何变形补偿，以及动态对齐模块（DAM）用于语义级可见性感知表示。

Result: 在CARGO数据集四个匹配协议上评估，相比现有最优方法，在空对地设置中mAP提升18.8%，Rank-1准确率提升16.8%。

Conclusion: GSAlign通过联合处理几何失真和语义错位，有效解决了空中-地面行人重识别中的关键挑战，显著提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and
interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these
limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce
\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist
socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with
emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines,
improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban
contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators.
This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable

TL;DR: GRPO-Guard通过比率归一化和梯度重加权来解决GRPO强化学习中重要性比率分布偏移问题，防止隐式过优化，提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO框架中重要性比率分布存在系统性偏移（均值低于1、方差不一致），导致PPO裁剪机制失效，模型进入隐式过优化阶段，虽然代理奖励增加但图像质量和文本对齐等关键指标急剧下降。

Method: 提出GRPO-Guard方法：1）比率归一化，恢复平衡且步长一致的重要性比率；2）梯度重加权策略，均衡不同噪声条件下的策略梯度。

Result: 在多种扩散骨干网络（如SD3.5M、Flux.1-dev）和多样化代理任务上的实验表明，GRPO-Guard显著减少过优化，同时保持甚至提升生成质量。

Conclusion: GRPO-Guard作为受调控的裁剪机制，能够稳定优化过程，大幅缓解隐式过优化问题，且无需依赖沉重的KL正则化。

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

Conclusion: 基于图的机制在自监督表示学习中具有显著效果，能够有效捕获样本间关系并提升模型性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散的方法通常将fMRI活动映射到单个高层嵌入，在整个生成过程中作为固定引导。然而这种固定引导会压缩分层神经信息，且与图像重建的阶段需求不匹配。

Method: 提出MindHier框架，包含三个组件：分层fMRI编码器提取多级神经嵌入、层次到层次对齐方案与CLIP特征建立层间对应关系、尺度感知的从粗到细神经引导策略在匹配尺度注入嵌入到自回归过程中。

Result: 在NSD数据集上的实验表明，MindHier相比基于扩散的基线方法实现了更好的语义保真度、4.67倍的推理速度提升，以及更确定性的结果。

Conclusion: MindHier通过分层重建过程，先合成全局语义再细化局部细节，提供了一个高效且认知对齐的替代方案，更符合人类视觉感知机制。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

Abstract: Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \&
product design and creative industries to control 3D object features accurately
in image space. Traditional 3D editing approaches are time-consuming and demand
specialized skills, while current image-based generative methods lack accuracy
in geometric conditioning. To address these challenges, we propose
GeoDiffusion, a training-free framework for accurate and efficient geometric
conditioning of 3D features in image generation. GeoDiffusion employs a
class-specific 3D object as a geometric prior to define keypoints and
parametric correlations in 3D space. We ensure viewpoint consistency through a
rendered image of a reference 3D object, followed by style transfer to meet
user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is
GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry
guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench. Our results demonstrate
that GeoDiffusion enables precise geometric modifications across various
iterative design workflows.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent
state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and
3D reconstruction. Code and model weights can be found in project repository:

Conclusion: T2SMark通过创新的尾部截断采样和两阶段框架，有效解决了扩散模型水印中鲁棒性与多样性的权衡问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing
high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property
protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion
models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as
specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the
infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the
generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing
the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to
balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve
strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which
degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile
for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a
two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike
prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances
robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while
randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our
two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly
generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on
diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show
that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于循环相关的可变形图像配准框架，通过动态调整匹配区域位置来高效处理大变形，在保持高精度的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有可变形图像配准方法在处理大变形时的效率问题，特别是体素到区域匹配方法难以捕捉长距离对应关系的问题。

Method: 采用循环相关框架，在每个步骤中执行低成本局部匹配，利用估计的偏移量指导下一个搜索区域，结合轻量级循环更新模块和特征解耦策略。

Result: 在脑部MRI和腹部CT数据集上测试，在有无仿射预配准两种设置下均表现出色，在OASIS数据集上仅使用RDP方法9.5%的FLOPs，运行速度快96%，同时保持可比性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度和计算效率之间取得了良好平衡，优于或匹配现有最先进方法，为处理大变形配准提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

this representation to classify LiDAR points as foreground or background. The
method supports diverse LiDAR types, including multiline 360 degree and
micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) sensors, and adapts to various
configurations. Evaluated on the publicly available RCooper dataset, it
outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and flexibility, even with

TL;DR: 提出TDSR框架，将图像描述重新定义为分层规划问题，通过高效的MCTS算法显著减少VLM调用次数，提升描述质量和计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型视觉语言模型在图像描述任务中的矛盾：强大的单步生成能力导致决策短视，难以在保持全局叙事连贯性的同时捕捉丰富细节

Method: 将图像描述建模为马尔可夫决策过程，提出基于视觉引导并行扩展和轻量级价值网络的高效MCTS算法，包含自适应早停机制

Result: 在DetailCaps、COMPOSITIONCAP和POPE等多个基准测试中达到SOTA或极具竞争力的结果，显著提升现有VLM在细粒度描述、组合泛化和幻觉抑制方面的性能

Conclusion: TDSR作为即插即用模块，能够在不牺牲规划质量的前提下，将昂贵的VLM调用频率降低一个数量级，有效解决了VLM在复杂场景描述中的根本挑战

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

Conclusion: 该研究为量化LiDAR在降雪条件下的性能退化提供了有效方法，生成的合成数据可用于评估和改进自动驾驶系统在恶劣天气条件下的感知能力。

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决可穿戴辅助代理中的目标推断问题，消除用户与代理交互所需的努力，通过多模态上下文观察自动推断用户目标。

Method: 创建WAGIBench基准测试，收集29小时多模态数据（视觉、音频、数字、纵向上下文），涵盖348名参与者的3,477条记录，评估多种视觉语言模型。

Result: 人类表现优于模型（93% vs 84%），大型模型表现更好但实用性仍不足（仅55%时间生成相关目标），相关模态信息能提升性能而无关模态影响很小。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在目标推断任务上仍有很大提升空间，多模态信息对性能有积极影响，WAGIBench为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

Result: 在大规模CZII数据集上的广泛评估表明，该方法比监督基线提高了10%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 半监督学习在利用未标记CryoET数据方面具有巨大潜力，能够显著提升粒子检测性能。

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach
improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of
semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in
camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative
solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential
applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play
fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

Conclusion: GateFuseNet通过自适应多模态融合显著提升了帕金森病诊断性能，Grad-CAM可视化证实模型聚焦于临床相关病理区域。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) from MRI remains challenging
due to symptom variability and pathological heterogeneity. Most existing
methods rely on conventional magnitude-based MRI modalities, such as
T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that
quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we
propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates
QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion
module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating
vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism
enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further
validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion
positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically
relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be

Conclusion: ORIG展示了开放多模态检索在事实图像生成方面的潜力，能够有效提升生成图像的事实准确性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

Conclusion: AesCrop通过显式整合构图知识，在图像裁剪任务中实现了更好的全局性和多样性，为美学驱动的图像裁剪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

*Xiang Fei,Tina Tian,Howie Choset,Lu Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG)方法，通过词组概念和时空一致性改进SLAM系统中的闭环检测，在感知混叠环境中实现高精度、鲁棒性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在感知混叠环境（如狭窄管道）中表现不佳，存在向量量化、特征稀疏和重复纹理等问题，而现有解决方案通常计算成本高昂。

Method: 引入词组概念捕捉视觉词的空间共现和邻近性构建在线词典；结合概率转移模型将时间一致性融入相似度计算；增加特征分布分析模块和专用后验证机制。

Result: 在公共数据集和自建受限管道数据集上测试，BoWG在精度-召回率和计算效率方面均优于现有最先进方法（包括传统和基于学习的方法），在Bicocca25b数据集上平均每张图像处理时间仅16毫秒。

Conclusion: BoWG方法在感知混叠环境中实现了卓越的闭环检测性能，具有高精度、鲁棒性和计算效率，并展现出良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the
Bicocca25b dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的即插即用空间重聚焦超分辨率框架，通过空间重聚焦交叉注意力和空间目标无分类器引导机制，解决了现有扩散超分辨率方法中的语义模糊和幻觉细节问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的超分辨率方法存在语义模糊问题，主要由于文本条件的不准确性和不完整性，以及交叉注意力容易偏向无关像素，导致语义错位和幻觉细节。

Method: 1. 空间重聚焦交叉注意力：在推理时通过视觉基础分割掩码来引导交叉注意力，精炼文本条件；2. 空间目标无分类器引导：选择性绕过对未接地像素的文本影响以防止幻觉。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，SRSR在所有数据集的标准保真度指标上均优于七个最先进的基线方法，并在两个真实世界基准测试中在感知质量指标上表现更好。

Conclusion: SRSR框架在超分辨率任务中实现了高语义保真度和感知质量，有效解决了现有方法的语义模糊和幻觉问题。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

*Mahiro Ukai,Shuhei Kurita,Nakamasa Inoue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STATUS Bench是首个专门评估视觉语言模型理解物体状态变化能力的基准，包含三个同步任务：物体状态识别、图像检索和状态变化识别。实验表明当前最先进的VLMs在识别细微物体状态变化方面仍有困难，大多数模型在零样本设置下表现仅达到随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然现代视觉语言模型能够执行多种多模态任务，但其在识别物体状态（如位置状态和功能状态）方面的精确度仍不明确。为了解决这个问题，需要建立一个专门的基准来严格评估VLMs理解物体状态细微变化的能力。

Method: 提出了STATUS Bench基准，包含三个同步评估任务：物体状态识别(OSI)、图像检索(IR)和状态变化识别(SCI)。构建了全手工制作的数据集，包含图像对及其对应的物体状态描述和状态变化描述。同时创建了STATUS Train训练数据集，包含1300万半自动生成的描述。

Result: 实验显示当前最先进的VLMs在捕捉细微物体状态区分方面仍有显著困难。在严格的评估方案下，大多数开源权重的VLMs在零样本设置下表现仅达到随机水平。在STATUS Train上微调后，Qwen2.5-VL达到了与Gemini 2.0 Flash相当的性能。

Conclusion: STATUS Bench和STATUS Train对于推进VLM研究中物体状态识别的发展是必要的，当前VLMs在理解物体状态变化方面仍有很大提升空间。

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

Method: 开发了端到端的定位检测框架MELDAE，采用新颖的边界感知损失函数来惩罚起始和结束时间误差，提高时间定位精度。

Result: 在WDMD数据集上，关键F1_{DR}定位指标比最强基线提升了17.72%，并在现有基准测试中展现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为野外对话场景中的微表情分析提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了真实环境下的检测和定位性能。

Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial
for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild
scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on
datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance
degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose
three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on
conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection
framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves
temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD
dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the
strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization
capabilities on existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文针对XLFM（扩展光场显微镜）的3D重建问题，提出了三个关键贡献：XLFM-Zebrafish基准数据集、自监督的MVN-LF方法和物理约束的ORC损失函数，在斑马鱼数据集上PSNR提升7.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: XLFM在神经科学中具有重要应用价值，但基于学习的3D重建面临两大挑战：缺乏标准化数据集和缺乏能有效建模角度-空间结构且保持物理基础的方法。

Method: 1) 构建XLFM-Zebrafish基准数据集；2) 提出MVN-LF自监督任务，通过预测遮挡视图学习角度先验；3) 设计ORC损失函数，通过可微分渲染约束确保预测体积与PSF前向投影的一致性。

Result: 在XLFM-Zebrafish基准测试中，该方法相比最先进基线方法，PSNR提升了7.7%。

Conclusion: 该工作通过构建标准化数据集、引入自监督学习和物理约束，显著提升了XLFM的3D重建性能，为神经科学大规模成像提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有跨视角地理定位方法依赖资源密集型细粒度特征提取和对齐，导致推理成本高、难以在边缘设备部署的问题。

Method: 1) 训练阶段：层次蒸馏范式HD-CVGL结合不确定性感知预测对齐UAPA；2) 推理阶段：多视图精炼模块MRM利用互信息过滤冗余样本。

Result: 在University-1652数据集上达到97.15% Recall@1，FLOPs效率提升5倍以上，速度提升3倍，在AGX Orin边缘设备上达到251.5 FPS。

Conclusion: PFED在精度和效率方面均达到最先进水平，证明了其在实时无人机应用中的实际可行性。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on
University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3
\times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS
on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for
real-time UAV applications. The project is available at

TL;DR: PSScreen V2是一个用于多种视网膜疾病筛查的部分监督自训练框架，通过三分支架构（一个教师网络和两个学生网络）解决标签缺失和域偏移问题，在多个眼底数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖完全标注或单域数据集的问题，处理多个部分标注数据集中的标签缺失和域偏移挑战。

Method: 采用三分支架构：教师分支从弱增强图像生成伪标签解决标签缺失；两个学生分支分别使用低频丢弃（LF-Dropout）增强域鲁棒性，以及低频不确定性（LF-Uncert）通过对抗学习的高斯扰动估计域变异性。

Result: 在多个域内和域外眼底数据集上实现了最先进的性能和优越的域泛化能力，与包括DINOv2在内的多种骨干网络兼容，在胸部X射线数据集上也表现良好。

Conclusion: PSScreen V2是一个通用且适应性强的框架，能有效处理部分监督学习和域泛化问题，在医疗图像分析中具有广泛应用前景。

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The

TL;DR: 提出了一种投影嵌入扩散桥（PEDB）方法，通过引入新的反向随机微分方程，在采样过程中同时考虑FBP重建和投影数据，从而自然融入数据一致性，在稀疏视图、有限角度和截断投影等不完整CT数据重建中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不完整投影数据CT重建的挑战，现有扩散桥模型主要从FBP重建恢复干净图像，但如何融入数据一致性来提升重建保真度和细节恢复仍待探索。

Method: 提出PEDB方法，设计新的反向SDE从干净图像分布中采样，同时以FBP重建和投影数据为条件；将投影数据嵌入反向SDE的得分函数，推导后验得分的可处理表达式；引入自由参数控制反向过程随机性，设计离散化方案减少误差。

Result: 在稀疏视图、有限角度和截断投影三种不完整数据类型的CT重建中，PEDB在标准、噪声和域偏移评估中均优于现有最先进的扩散桥模型。

Conclusion: PEDB通过显式地将投影数据条件化到采样过程中，自然融入了数据一致性，在多种不完整CT数据重建场景下实现了优越性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

TL;DR: SWAN是一个三阶段自监督小波神经网络，用于从高光谱图像联合估计端元和丰度。该方法通过小波变换获得稀疏多尺度表示，利用自监督学习提取潜在对称性，无需地面真值即可训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统高光谱解混方法依赖地面真值，而SWAN旨在通过自监督学习消除这一依赖，同时利用小波变换的稀疏多尺度特性提高解混性能。

Method: 三阶段架构：SWANencoder将小波系数映射到低维潜在空间，SWANdecoder重建输入小波系数，SWANforward学习高光谱图像的物理特性。使用Adam优化器，Sigmoid激活函数和dropout防止过拟合，核正则化器约束端元系数。

Result: 在两个合成数据集和三个真实高光谱数据集上的实验表明，SWAN在定性和定量评估中优于现有神经网络解混方法，学习到了更具鲁棒性的解混函数。

Conclusion: SWAN通过自监督学习和紧凑网络参数实现了性能提升，为实际应用提供了有效的解混解决方案。

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact
network parameters for practical applications.

TL;DR: 评估ZebraPose模型从斑马到奶牛的跨物种姿态估计迁移学习，发现在分布内数据表现良好但泛化到新环境时失败，揭示了合成到真实域差距是农业AI部署的主要障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决畜牧业中大规模标注数据集稀缺的问题，探索通过跨物种迁移学习来克服数据限制，特别是在奶牛姿态估计领域。

Method: 使用ZebraPose（基于视觉transformer的模型，在合成斑马图像上训练）进行27个关键点检测，评估三种配置：自定义农场数据集、APT-36K基准子集及其组合。

Result: 组合模型在分布内数据上表现良好（AP=0.86，AR=0.87，PCK 0.5=0.869），但在未见过的牛舍和牛群上出现显著泛化失败。

Conclusion: 物种间形态相似性不足以支持跨域迁移，需要农业优先的AI设计，强调农场级真实性、跨环境鲁棒性和开放基准数据集。

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures are important biomarkers of tumor aggressiveness in
histopathology, yet reliable recognition remains challenging due to severe
class imbalance and variability across imaging domains. We present a
DenseNet-121-based framework tailored for atypical mitosis classification in
the MIDOG 2025 (Track 2) setting. Our method integrates stain-aware
augmentation (Macenko), geometric and intensity transformations, and
imbalance-aware learning via weighted sampling with a hybrid objective
combining class-weighted binary cross-entropy and focal loss. Trained
end-to-end with AdamW and evaluated across multiple independent domains, the
model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts,
achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and
specificity 80.9% on the official test set. These results indicate that
combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive
objectives yields a robust, domain-generalizable framework for atypical mitosis
classification suitable for real-world computational pathology workflows.

*Tharun Anand,Mohammad Hassan Vali,Arno Solin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种从预训练扩散模型参数中直接推导语义编辑方向的解析方法，无需额外数据或微调，通过分析自注意力权重矩阵的特征向量获得可解释的编辑方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成方面表现出色，但对其输出进行精确控制和目标编辑仍然具有挑战性。现有方法通常依赖大量图像采样或训练辅助网络，效率较低。

Method: 通过计算预训练扩散模型中自注意力权重矩阵的特征向量，直接获得语义编辑方向，无需额外数据或模型微调。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多个数据集上产生高质量编辑效果，同时将编辑时间显著减少60%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、无需额外训练的可解释编辑方案，证明了自注意力权重矩阵编码了丰富的语义结构信息。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while
reducing editing time significantly by 60% over current benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了SARCLIP，首个针对SAR领域的视觉语言基础模型，通过对比学习实现SAR图像与文本的对齐，在图像-文本检索和零样本分类任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAR基础模型主要关注低层视觉特征，忽视了多模态对齐和零样本目标识别能力，需要构建能够理解SAR图像语义的视觉语言模型。

Method: 构建了包含100万文本-图像对的SARCLIP-1M数据集，采用对比视觉语言学习方法，通过领域迁移策略训练SARCLIP模型。

Result: 在图像-文本检索和零样本分类任务中，SARCLIP显著优于现有最先进的基础模型，提升了SAR图像的语义理解能力。

Conclusion: SARCLIP成功建立了SAR图像与文本描述之间的桥梁，为SAR领域的语义理解提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

Conclusion: LVD-GS系统通过多模态融合和动态建模，有效提升了大规模动态户外场景下的SLAM性能和重建鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

### [231] [Alias-Free ViT: Fractional Shift Invariance via Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22673)
*Hagay Michaeli,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种Alias-Free ViT模型，通过无混叠下采样和非线性操作，以及线性互协方差注意力机制，解决了Vision Transformers缺乏平移不变性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers缺乏卷积网络的架构归纳偏置，特别是对图像平移敏感，而卷积网络本身也存在因混叠导致的平移不变性不足问题。

Method: 结合无混叠下采样和非线性操作，使用线性互协方差注意力机制，该注意力对整数和分数平移都具有平移等变性。

Result: 模型在图像分类任务中保持竞争力，在对抗性平移鲁棒性方面优于类似规模的模型。

Conclusion: Alias-Free ViT通过解决混叠问题实现了更好的平移不变性，为Vision Transformers提供了更强的平移鲁棒性。

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高精地图预测方法在高质量预测方面表现不佳，主要由于任务不对齐问题：1）不合适的任务标签（一对多匹配查询共享相同标签）2）次优的任务特征（任务共享采样机制）

Method: 提出DAMap方法，包含三个组件：距离感知焦点损失（DAFL）为样本分配适当分类标签，任务调制可变形注意力（TMDA）获取判别性任务特定特征，混合损失方案（HLS）更好利用DAFL优势

Result: 在NuScenes和Argoverse2基准测试中，在不同指标、基线、分割、骨干网络和训练计划下均实现了性能提升

Conclusion: DAMap通过解决任务不对齐问题，有效提升了高精地图元素的预测质量，对自动驾驶安全具有重要意义

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日本房地产市场中关键建筑元数据（如建筑年份和结构类型）经常缺失或过时，这影响了灾害风险评估和保险定价。

Method: 使用多任务学习模型从立面图像联合估计建筑年份、建筑结构和物业类型，然后通过基于官方保险标准的规则映射推导出结构防火等级。

Result: 模型在建筑年份回归和跨不平衡类别的分类中实现了高准确率，定性分析显示模型能够捕捉与建筑年龄和材料相关的视觉线索。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了基于图像的可扩展、可解释风险分析系统的可行性，在保险、城市规划和灾害准备方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban
planning, and disaster preparedness.

Conclusion: RoboSVG建立了一个统一的多模态框架，能够有效生成高质量的交互式SVG图形，为数字设计和机器人控制提供了强大的工具。数据集和源代码将公开发布。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive
generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity
across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation.

TL;DR: VADTree提出了一种基于层次粒度感知树结构的视频异常检测方法，通过预训练的通用事件边界检测模型来灵活采样，结合视觉语言模型和大语言模型进行异常感知和推理，在无需训练的情况下实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于固定长度时间窗口采样的训练免费方法难以准确捕捉不同时间跨度的异常，需要更灵活的采样策略来适应异常事件的多样性。

Method: 使用层次粒度感知树结构，基于GEBD模型识别事件边界，构建自适应粗细层次结构，结合VLMs和LLMs进行节点级异常感知和推理，最后通过簇间节点相关性整合多粒度异常分数。

Result: 在三个挑战性数据集上的实验表明，VADTree在训练免费设置下达到最先进性能，同时大幅减少采样的视频片段数量。

Conclusion: VADTree通过灵活的层次采样和知识注入，有效解决了视频异常检测中不同时间跨度异常的识别问题，为训练免费方法提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MRAG方法存在静态检索策略、模态选择不灵活和检索信息利用不足的问题，导致计算开销大且响应质量低。

Method: 1) Windsock模块：查询依赖的检索决策和模态选择；2) DANCE指令调优：增强检索信息利用能力并保持噪声鲁棒性；3) 自评估方法：将问答数据集转换为MRAG训练数据集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高生成质量17.07%，同时减少8.95%的检索次数。

Conclusion: Windsock和DANCE指令调优有效解决了MRAG的关键挑战，在提升响应质量的同时降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

Conclusion: WaveMAE被确立为多光谱遥感图像的强大且地理感知的基础模型。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D几何重建和语义理解分开处理，忽略了二者的内在关联，限制了泛化能力和下游任务性能

Method: 设计3D一致性对比学习策略，从2D视觉输入编码统一表示，构建InsScene-15K数据集支持训练

Result: 模型能够从2D输入一致地提升到3D场景，并明确区分对象实例

Conclusion: IGGT通过统一几何和语义表示，实现了更好的3D场景理解

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

word-level lipreading dataset, comprising $743$ target words and over
$414{,}000$ video samples extracted from more than $1{,}900$ hours of footage
across $67$ television programs. Designed as a benchmark-ready resource,
LRW-Persian provides speaker-disjoint training and test splits, wide regional

pose/mask screening. We further fine-tune two widely used lipreading
architectures on LRW-Persian, establishing reference performance and
demonstrating the difficulty of Persian visual speech recognition. By filling a

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

TL;DR: 提出ConMatFormer混合深度学习架构，结合ConvNeXt块、多种注意力机制和Transformer模块，用于糖尿病足溃疡检测，在公开数据集上超越现有SOTA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决糖尿病足溃疡检测中公开数据集稀缺和变异性的挑战，以及类别不平衡问题。

Method: 使用ConvNeXt块提取局部特征，结合CBAM和DANet注意力机制，加入Transformer模块增强长程依赖，采用数据增强处理类别不平衡。

Result: 在DFUC2021和DFU数据集上，单次实验准确率0.8961，精度0.9160；4折交叉验证准确率0.9755±0.0031，优于现有CNN和ViT模型。

Conclusion: 为DFU分类设定了新基准，提供了用于医学图像分析的混合注意力Transformer框架，并通过XAI方法确保决策透明度和可信度。

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

### [242] [Self-Calibrated Consistency can Fight Back for Adversarial Robustness in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22785)
*Jiaxiang Liu,Jiawei Du,Xiao Liu,Prayag Tiwari,Mingkun Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC)方法，通过语义一致性和空间一致性模块增强CLIP模型在零样本设置下的对抗鲁棒性，无需对抗微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP模型对对抗扰动高度脆弱，而现有防御方法依赖有标签数据的对抗微调，限制了在零样本场景中的应用。

Method: SCC包含两个模块：语义一致性利用反攻击预热生成的软伪标签和多视图预测来正则化跨模态对齐；空间一致性通过增强视图对齐扰动视觉预测以稳定推理。

Result: 在22个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SCC能持续提升CLIP的零样本鲁棒性，同时保持准确性，并可无缝集成到其他VLM中。

Conclusion: SCC为从CLIP建立对抗鲁棒范式提供了巨大潜力，其影响可扩展到更广泛的视觉语言领域如BioMedCLIP。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

TL;DR: MedXplain-VQA是一个可解释的医学视觉问答框架，整合了五个可解释AI组件，在病理VQA任务中显著提升性能，同时提供透明的诊断推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学VQA系统需要可解释性才能获得临床采纳，医生需要透明的推理过程来信任AI生成的诊断结果。

Method: 使用微调的BLIP-2骨干网络，结合医学查询重构、增强的Grad-CAM注意力、精确区域提取和通过多模态语言模型的结构化思维链推理。

Result: 在500个PathVQA病理样本上的实验显示，增强系统获得0.683的综合得分（基线为0.378），保持高推理置信度（0.890），每个样本识别3-5个诊断相关区域，生成平均57词的结构化解释。

Conclusion: MedXplain-VQA是一个强大、可解释的医学VQA系统，消融研究表明查询重构提供最大初始改进，思维链推理支持系统化诊断过程。

Abstract: Explainability is critical for the clinical adoption of medical visual
question answering (VQA) systems, as physicians require transparent reasoning
to trust AI-generated diagnoses. We present MedXplain-VQA, a comprehensive
framework integrating five explainable AI components to deliver interpretable
medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region
extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language
models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific
framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while
maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5
diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured
explanations averaging 57 words with appropriate clinical terminology. Ablation
studies reveal that query reformulation provides the most significant initial
improvement, while chain-of-thought reasoning enables systematic diagnostic
processes. These findings underscore the potential of MedXplain-VQA as a
robust, explainable medical VQA system. Future work will focus on validation
with medical experts and large-scale clinical datasets to ensure clinical
readiness.

*Fatemeh Nazarieh,Zhenhua Feng,Diptesh Kanojia,Muhammad Awais,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC-Talk是一个基于扩散模型的单次学习框架，用于生成可定制且时间稳定的说话人脸视频，解决了现有方法在时间一致性、身份保持和自定义方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的音频驱动说话人脸生成方法虽然改善了音频-嘴唇同步，但在时间一致性、身份保持和自定义方面表现不佳，特别是在生成长视频时。

Method: MAGIC-Talk包含ReferenceNet（通过文本提示保持身份和实现细粒度面部编辑）和AnimateNet（使用结构化运动先验增强运动连贯性），并引入了渐进潜在融合策略来改善长视频质量。

Result: 大量实验表明，MAGIC-Talk在视觉质量、身份保持和同步准确性方面优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk为说话人脸生成提供了一个强大的解决方案，能够从单张图像保持身份，同时确保帧间的平滑过渡。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,
offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

### [245] [FairJudge: MLLM Judging for Social Attributes and Prompt Image Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22827)
*Zahraa Al Sahili,Maryam Fetanat,Maimuna Nowaz,Ioannis Patras,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairJudge是一个轻量级评估协议，使用多模态LLM作为公平评判者来评估文本到图像系统的图像与提示匹配度和社会属性处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I系统缺乏简单可复现的方法来评估图像与提示的匹配度以及模型处理社会属性的方式，常用代理方法（如人脸分类器和对比相似度）存在奖励表面线索、缺乏校准弃权、忽略弱可见属性等问题。

Method: 采用指令跟随的多模态LLM作为公平评判者，使用解释导向的评分标准映射到[-1,1]区间，约束判断为封闭标签集，要求基于可见内容的证据，并在线索不足时强制弃权。

Result: 在FairFace、PaTA、FairCoT等数据集上评估性别、种族、年龄等属性，并扩展到宗教、文化和残疾属性。在IdenProf、FairCoT-Professions和新发布的DIVERSIFY-Professions上评估职业正确性和对齐度。

Conclusion: FairJudge在人口统计预测上优于对比性和人脸中心基线方法，在保持高职业准确性的同时提高了平均对齐度，实现了更可靠、可复现的公平性审计。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MediaEval 2025竞赛中商业广告记忆度预测任务，旨在开发能够准确预测广告记忆度的多模态系统。

Method: 使用Gemma-3 LLM作为主干网络，通过多模态投影整合预计算的视觉(ViT)和文本(E5)特征，采用LoRA进行模型适配，并利用LLM生成的基于专家记忆度方面的理性提示来指导融合模型。

Result: 基于LLM的系统在最终测试集上表现出比梯度提升树基线更好的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: 多模态LLM融合系统在商业广告记忆度预测任务中具有优势，特别是通过理性提示引导的方法能够有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: 提出SP-CSVR框架解决大型视觉语言模型中的"风格陷阱"问题，通过风格-内容解耦实现跨风格的稳定语义理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效解耦风格与内容，阻碍了跨风格语义理解的泛化能力，特别是在上下文学习中。

Method: 集成跨风格特征编码器(CSFE)进行风格-内容解耦，语义对齐上下文解码器(SAICD)实现少样本风格适应，自适应语义一致性模块(ASCM)通过多任务对比学习强制跨风格语义不变性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的多风格数据集上的广泛实验表明，SP-CSVR在视觉描述、视觉问答和上下文风格适应方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 综合评估确认SP-CSVR在增强跨多样视觉风格的鲁棒性、泛化能力和效率方面具有显著效果。

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual
styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to
effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address
this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR),
a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style
visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for
style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)
for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency
Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style
semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset
demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning,
visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive
evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm
SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency
across diverse visual styles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联合图像对齐方法通常需要长时间训练、大容量模型和大量超参数调优，计算复杂度高。

Method: 利用现成的图像匹配器计算成对匹配，通过快速非参数聚类构建表示关键点关系的图，使用图神经网络传播和聚合对应关系，通过图像级池化预测单应性参数，采用逆组合损失避免正则化项。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，FastJAM在配准质量上优于现有现代JA方法，同时将计算时间从小时/分钟级减少到秒级。

Conclusion: FastJAM提供了一种快速有效的联合图像对齐解决方案，显著降低了计算复杂度，同时保持了高质量的对齐效果。

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code
is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

TL;DR: Semantic Surgery是一个无需训练、零样本的概念擦除框架，直接在文本嵌入层面操作，通过向量减法消除目标概念的影响，在保持图像质量的同时实现高效概念擦除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型概念擦除方法往往会损害生成质量，需要一种既能有效擦除有害内容又不影响图像质量的方法。

Method: 在扩散过程前对文本嵌入进行操作，动态估计目标概念存在性，执行校准向量减法，包含共现编码模块和视觉反馈循环来处理多概念擦除和潜在概念持续性问题。

Result: 在物体、显式内容、艺术风格和多名人擦除任务中显著优于现有方法，如物体擦除H-score达93.58，显式内容减少到仅1个实例，风格擦除H_a为8.09且无质量下降。

Conclusion: 该方法作为训练无关的解决方案，能够动态适应每个提示，提供精确干预，同时可作为内置威胁检测系统，为更安全的文本到图像生成提供实用方案。

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

<details>

Motivation: 风力涡轮机叶片在恶劣环境中运行，需要及时检测损伤以防止故障。传统基于深度学习的无人机检测方法依赖大量标注数据，难以检测罕见或新出现的损伤类型

Method: 构建包含技术文档、参考图像和领域指南的多模态知识库，使用混合文本-图像检索器结合关键词感知重排序，在推理时为VLM提供最相关上下文

Result: 在30张标记叶片图像测试集上，RAG增强的VLM正确分类所有样本，而无检索的相同VLM在准确率和精度上表现较差

Conclusion: 该框架通过可解释性和泛化性优势，利用领域知识而非仅依赖视觉线索，为工业检测提供了减少对大量标注数据依赖的数据高效解决方案

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in
livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to
manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the
risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a
comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected
across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons
and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm *
30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted
by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors
(AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual,
spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing
the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如LangSplat需要为每个场景训练特定的语言自编码器进行特征压缩，这造成了昂贵的逐场景优化瓶颈，限制了部署的可扩展性。

Method: 使用在ScanNet数据集上预训练的通用自编码器替代场景特定自编码器，为任何新场景提供固定的紧凑潜在空间，无需场景特定训练。

Result: 实现了整个语言场构建过程的效率提升，查询性能与原LangSplat方法相当或更好，通过MSE和余弦相似度验证了表示保真度。

Conclusion: 通用嵌入能够高效准确地支持新3D场景中的开词汇查询，为可扩展的实时交互3D AI应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但由于冗余视觉令牌导致效率低下。现有令牌合并方法减少序列长度但经常破坏空间布局和时间连续性，忽视了位置关系。

Method: PPE在令牌维度上显式引入3D位置的解耦编码，使每个压缩令牌能够封装来自多个原始令牌的不同位置。支持级联聚类——一种渐进式令牌压缩策略，实现更好的性能保持。PPE是无参数通用算子，可无缝集成到现有令牌合并方法中。

Result: 应用于最先进的令牌合并框架，PPE在多个视觉语言基准测试中实现了2%~5%的持续改进，包括MMBench(通用视觉理解)、TextVQA(布局理解)和VideoMME(时间理解)。

Conclusion: 保持位置线索对于高效且有效的多模态大语言模型推理至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

*Matthew So,Judah Goldfeder,Mark Lis,Hod Lipson*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文通过训练双编码器网络验证生物特征统计独立性的历史假设，发现左右虹膜存在相关性，指纹模型重现了先前研究的阳性结果，但跨模态匹配效果仅略高于随机水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战生物特征统计独立性的历史假设，验证不同生物特征之间是否存在相关性。

Method: 使用ResNet-50和Vision Transformer作为骨干网络，在双编码器架构中训练对比损失，对274名受试者的约10万指纹和7千虹膜图像进行三种验证任务：指纹-指纹匹配、虹膜-虹膜匹配、跨模态指纹-虹膜匹配。

Result: 虹膜ResNet架构在虹膜-虹膜匹配中达到91% ROC AUC分数，证明个体左右虹膜存在相关性；指纹模型重现了先前研究的阳性结果；跨模态匹配仅略高于随机水平。

Conclusion: 研究结果继续挑战生物特征独立性的假设，未来计划扩展到其他生物特征。这是首次尝试使用Vision Transformer进行此类匹配的工作。

Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are
statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder
networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint
matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching
using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可切换的令牌特定码本量化方法，用于人脸图像压缩，通过为不同图像类别学习不同的码本组，并为每个令牌分配独立码本，在低比特率下显著提升重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于码本的全局共享策略忽视了人脸图像中类别特定的相关性以及令牌间的语义差异，导致在低比特率下性能不佳。

Method: 学习不同图像类别的码本组，为每个令牌分配独立码本，通过少量比特记录每个令牌所属的码本组，在降低每个码本组大小的同时减少损失。

Result: 在0.05 bpp下，重建图像在人脸识别数据集上达到93.51%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法可集成到任何现有的基于码本的表征学习方法中，在低比特率下显著提升人脸图像压缩的重建性能。

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型虽然能力强大但需要从头训练且计算资源消耗大，本文旨在通过融合现有专用模型来更高效地获得竞争性性能。

Method: 采用双重融合机制：保留原始模型块，同时在网络中插入多模态自注意力块，实现理解编码器的高级语义表示与生成编码器的低级空间信号的协同融合。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异：GenEval组合文本到图像生成0.91，DPG-Bench复杂文本到图像生成82.16，GEditBench 6.06，ImgEdit-Bench 3.77。

Conclusion: 通过战略性地融合公开可用的专用模型，可以在大幅减少训练数据（仅35B tokens）的情况下获得竞争性多模态建模性能，为未来统一多模态建模研究提供支持。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image
generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By
fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope
to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

TL;DR: FAME是一个公平感知的视频编辑方法，通过注意力调制来减轻职业相关的性别偏见，同时保持提示对齐和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的免训练视频编辑模型在处理职业相关提示时容易陷入性别刻板印象，需要开发能够缓解职业相关性别偏见的方法。

Method: 通过软注入去偏标记获得公平嵌入，并在时间自注意力和跨注意力中集成公平调制，使用区域约束注意力掩码和时间衰减权重来增强一致性。

Result: 在FairVE基准测试中，FAME实现了更强的公平对齐和语义保真度，超越了现有的视频编辑基线方法。

Conclusion: FAME通过公平感知的注意力调制有效缓解了视频编辑中的职业性别偏见，同时保持了时间一致性和提示对齐。

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

Conclusion: 指出了领域泛化、可解释性、效率和隐私方面的紧迫挑战，并为未来研究规划了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With
powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align
naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal
characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the
field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a
dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of
multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual
and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics
and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques
for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality
heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training
paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are
systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks.
Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across
ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and
application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping,
agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial
intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline
pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and
privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

TL;DR: VALA提出了一种变分对齐模块，通过自适应选择关键帧并将其潜在特征压缩为语义锚点，实现无训练视频编辑中的时序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式帧选择来维持DDIM反演中的时序一致性，这会引入人为偏差并降低端到端推理的可扩展性。

Method: VALA使用变分框架和对比学习目标，将跨帧潜在表示压缩为保持内容和时序一致性的潜在锚点。

Result: 在真实世界视频编辑基准测试中，VALA在反演保真度、编辑质量和时序一致性方面达到最先进性能，同时比先前方法更高效。

Conclusion: VALA可以完全集成到基于无训练文本到图像的视频编辑模型中，提供更好的时序一致性和编辑质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing
quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over
prior methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的占用中心方法性能严重依赖标注的占用数据，但这类数据仍然稀缺。需要克服这一限制来推动自动驾驶下游应用。

Method: 采用时空解耦架构支持4D动态占用的高保真空间扩展和时间预测，提出高斯溅射的稀疏点图渲染策略增强多视角视频生成，以及传感器感知嵌入策略建模LiDAR传感器特性。

Result: 方法在生成保真度和可扩展性方面优于现有方法，并在下游任务中验证了其实用价值。

Conclusion: 基于Nuplan-Occ数据集开发的统一框架能够有效解决驾驶场景生成中的数据稀缺问题，为自动驾驶感知和规划评估提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理模拟需要空间变化的力学属性，传统方法需要手工制作，过程繁琐。VoMP旨在自动预测3D物体的体积材料属性。

Method: 使用多视图特征聚合，通过训练的几何变换器预测每个体素的材料潜在编码，这些编码位于从真实世界数据集学习的物理合理材料流形上。

Result: VoMP在准确性和速度上都远超现有方法，能够准确估计体积属性。

Conclusion: VoMP提供了一种有效的自动预测3D物体材料属性的方法，显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often
laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict
Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在保持概念一致性方面仍有困难，特别是在场景层面。现有工作主要关注角色一致性，但忽视了场景在叙事中的关键作用，限制了实际应用中的创造力。

Method: 提出SceneDecorator框架：1）VLM引导的场景规划，以"全局到局部"方式确保不同场景间的叙事连贯性；2）长期场景共享注意力机制，保持跨故事的长时期场景一致性和主体多样性。

Result: 大量实验证明SceneDecorator具有优越性能，在艺术、电影和游戏领域展现出释放创造力的潜力。

Conclusion: SceneDecorator通过创新的场景规划方法和一致性保持机制，有效解决了场景导向故事生成中的关键挑战，为创意领域提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they
still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images.
While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,
and games.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoMix是一个可微分的即插即用模块，通过混合多尺度解码器logits并自动学习最优损失权重，提升U型网络的性能，无需推理开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: U型网络的多尺度输出在训练中被孤立处理，缺乏粗细预测的互补融合，限制了性能提升。

Method: 使用四种轻量级融合算子（加法、乘法、连接、注意力加权）混合多尺度logits，生成合成突变图，并通过softplus损失权重与网络参数共同优化。

Result: 在Synapse 8器官数据集上，DICE比单输出监督提升+4.2%，比深度监督提升+2.2%，比等权重加法融合提升+1.5%；在数据稀缺时优势更明显（+9.23%）。

Conclusion: LoMix通过可学习的加权多尺度融合，在多种U型网络和基准测试中显著提升性能，同时保持数据高效、完全可解释且无推理开销。

Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a
different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats
these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final,
highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss
weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations.
Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only
when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce
LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that
generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should
guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder
logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,
concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of
synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss
weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step
architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,
mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures
(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset
improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep
supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero
inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled
scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.
Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up
to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted
mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully
interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SLDGroup/LoMix.

TL;DR: CoMo是一个用于文本到视频生成的组合运动定制框架，能够在一个视频中合成多个不同的运动，解决了现有方法在复杂多主体运动控制方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频模型在生成多样化场景方面表现出色，但在精确运动控制方面存在困难，特别是在处理复杂多主体运动时。虽然已有单运动定制方法，但在组合场景中由于运动-外观纠缠和无效的多运动混合而失败。

Method: CoMo采用两阶段方法：1）单运动学习阶段，通过静态-动态解耦调优范式从外观中解耦运动，学习运动特定模块；2）多运动组合阶段，通过即插即用的分治策略，在去噪过程中空间隔离不同运动的影响，无需额外训练即可组合学习到的运动。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，CoMo实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了可控视频生成的能力。作者还引入了新的基准和评估指标来评估多运动保真度和混合效果。

Conclusion: CoMo框架通过创新的两阶段方法有效解决了多运动定制中的关键挑战，为可控视频生成领域提供了重要进展。

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video
generation. Our project page is at https://como6.github.io/.

TL;DR: 提出统一的几何和属性增强框架UGAE，通过后几何增强、前属性增强和后属性增强三个组件，显著提升点云压缩质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云有损压缩会不可避免地导致几何结构和属性信息的不可逆失真，需要解决这些质量问题。

Method: UGAE框架包含三个核心组件：基于Transformer的稀疏卷积U-Net进行后几何增强，使用增强几何引导的重新着色策略进行前属性增强，以及使用属性残差预测网络进行后属性增强。

Result: 在8iVFB、Owlii和MVUB三个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，相比G-PCC测试模型，几何BD-PSNR提升9.98dB，属性Y分量BD-PSNR提升3.67dB，同时大幅节省码率。

Conclusion: UGAE框架有效提升了点云压缩的几何和属性质量，在客观指标和感知质量方面均有显著改善。

Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
improved perceptual quality significantly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了M³T2IBench基准和AlignScore评估指标，用于评估文本到图像生成中的图像-文本对齐问题，并提出了Revise-Then-Enforce方法来提升对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在图像与文本提示的精确对齐方面存在困难，特别是处理同一类别多个不同实例的复杂提示时表现不佳，且现有评估方法要么过于简单，要么与人类评估相关性差。

Method: 1) 构建大规模、多类别、多实例、多关系的M³T2IBench基准；2) 提出基于目标检测的AlignScore评估指标；3) 提出无需训练的Revise-Then-Enforce后编辑方法。

Result: 当前开源文本到图像模型在M³T2IBench基准上表现较差，而Revise-Then-Enforce方法在多种扩散模型中都能显著提升图像-文本对齐效果。

Conclusion: M³T2IBench和AlignScore为文本到图像对齐提供了更有效的评估工具，Revise-Then-Enforce方法为提升对齐性能提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made
publicly available after the paper is accepted.}

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of
digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have
proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks
are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image
categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To
address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive
benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers
a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image,
image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer
three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the
relation between detection and localization. Our benchmark and analysis provide
a robust foundation for future research.

*Hongyu Wu,Xuhui Fan,Zhangkai Wu,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NestAR模型，通过嵌套自回归架构在多个尺度上生成图像，将复杂度从O(n)降低到O(log n)，同时提高图像多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自回归模型在图像生成中计算密集和样本多样性有限的问题。

Method: 设计分层多尺度模块，每个大尺度模块基于前一个小尺度模块的输出，内部使用AR结构生成token块，结合流匹配损失和连续token。

Result: 在保持竞争力的图像生成性能的同时，显著降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: NestAR模型通过嵌套自回归架构有效平衡了图像生成质量和计算效率。

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

*Joungbin An,Kristen Grauman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HieraMamba是一个用于视频时序定位的分层架构，通过Anchor-MambaPooling块和多粒度对比学习，在长视频中实现了精确的时间定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时，由于过度下采样或依赖固定窗口，往往牺牲时间保真度。需要一种能同时捕捉全局上下文和细粒度时间细节的解决方案。

Method: 采用分层架构，核心是Anchor-MambaPooling块，利用Mamba的选择性扫描生成多粒度的紧凑锚点标记。结合锚点条件和段池化对比损失，保持局部细节和全局区分性。

Result: 在Ego4D-NLQ、MAD和TACoS数据集上达到新的最先进水平，在长未修剪视频中实现了精确的时间定位。

Conclusion: HieraMamba通过分层设计和多粒度表示，有效解决了长视频时序定位中时间保真度的问题，为视频理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,
untrimmed videos.

Motivation: 深度学习形变配准方法泛化能力差，在训练数据分布外的对比度和模态上表现不佳，限制了实际应用。LUMIR脑配准挑战赛旨在评估这种跨模态配准性能。

Method: 1. 将图像转换到MIND特征空间后再输入模型；2. 采用特殊的集成策略

Result: MIND特征空间变换显著提高了配准的鲁棒性，集成策略带来了小而一致的性能提升

Conclusion: 简单的MIND特征空间变换能显著改善深度学习配准方法的泛化能力，集成策略提供额外增益

Abstract: Deep learning based deformable registration methods have become popular in
recent years. However, their ability to generalize beyond training data
distribution can be poor, significantly hindering their usability. LUMIR brain
registration challenge for Learn2Reg 2025 aims to advance the field by
evaluating the performance of the registration on contrasts and modalities
different from those included in the training set. Here we describe our
submission to the challenge, which proposes a very simple idea for

space before feeding them into the model. In addition, a special ensembling
strategy is proposed that shows a small but consistent improvement.

TL;DR: EndoWave是一个用于内窥镜视频3D重建的统一时空高斯泼溅框架，通过结合光流几何约束和多分辨率有理小波监督来解决内窥镜场景中的动态视觉伪影问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器人辅助微创手术中，从内窥镜视频进行准确的3D重建对于下游任务和改善手术结果至关重要。然而，内窥镜场景存在独特挑战，包括光度不一致性、非刚性组织运动和视角依赖性高光等动态视觉伪影，这些会误导基于外观约束的3DGS优化过程。

Method: 1. 采用统一的时空高斯表示，直接在4D域中优化基元；2. 提出基于光流的几何约束来增强时间一致性并有效约束场景的3D结构；3. 提出多分辨率有理正交小波作为约束，能有效分离内窥镜细节并增强渲染性能。

Result: 在两个真实手术数据集EndoNeRF和StereoMIS上的广泛评估表明，EndoWave相比基线方法实现了最先进的重建质量和视觉精度。

Conclusion: EndoWave通过引入几何约束和小波监督，有效解决了内窥镜3D重建中的动态视觉伪影问题，显著提升了重建质量和准确性。

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

Motivation: 多模态位置编码对视觉语言模型至关重要，但目前缺乏系统性的研究。本文旨在填补这一空白，深入分析多模态RoPE的核心组件。

Method: 通过分析RoPE的两个核心组件(位置设计和频率分配)，提出了三种指导原则，并基于这些原则开发了MHRoPE和MRoPE-I两种变体方法。

Result: 提出的方法在多样化的基准测试中始终优于现有方法，在通用和细粒度多模态理解任务上都取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 本文为多模态位置编码提供了系统性的分析框架和有效的解决方案，所提出的方法简单易用且性能优越。

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and
frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key
guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and
plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods
consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with
significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal
understanding. Code will be avaliable at

TL;DR: 本文提出残差扩散桥模型（RDBM），通过理论重构广义扩散桥的随机微分方程，利用分布残差调制噪声注入和去除，实现自适应图像修复，在多种图像修复任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散桥模型缺乏统一分析视角，且通过全局噪声注入和去除重构图像会扭曲未退化区域。需要一种能自适应修复退化区域同时保持完好区域的方法。

Method: 理论重构广义扩散桥的随机微分方程，推导其前向和反向过程的解析公式。利用给定分布的残差调制噪声注入和去除，实现自适应修复。

Result: 在多种图像修复任务中，RDBM在定性和定量上都表现出最先进的性能，且证明现有桥模型都是RDBM的特例。

Conclusion: RDBM提供了一种统一的扩散桥模型分析框架，能自适应修复退化区域同时保护完好区域，在图像修复任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code
is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/RDBM.

TL;DR: 提出了一个任务无关的多模态融合框架，能够融合时间序列和单时间戳图像数据，支持跨模态生成并在下游任务中表现出鲁棒性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常针对特定任务设计，缺乏通用的多模态融合框架。本文旨在开发一个任务无关的框架，能够有效融合时间序列和图像数据，实现跨模态生成和下游任务性能提升。

Method: 探索确定性和学习性时间序列量化策略，利用掩码相关学习目标，在统一表示空间中对齐离散的图像和时间序列标记。在地球观测领域实例化该模型。

Result: 预训练模型能够从卫星图像生成一致的全球温度分布图，并在反事实实验中验证。在下游任务中，任务无关预训练比任务特定融合平均提高6%的R²和2%的RMSE，比基线方法提高50%的R²和12%的RMSE。

Conclusion: 该任务无关多模态融合框架在跨模态生成和下游任务中表现出优越性能，通过梯度敏感性分析提供了模型鲁棒性的见解。

Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and
single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream
performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for
time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning
objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified
representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the
pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from
satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across
downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific
fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods
by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity
across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and
weights will be released under a permissive license.

TL;DR: DeepSalt是一个基于深度学习的谱迁移框架，通过知识蒸馏和光谱适配单元将实验室光谱的高分辨率信息迁移到卫星高光谱传感中，实现无需大量地面采样的准确大范围盐度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤盐渍化严重威胁生态系统和农业，传统实验室光谱测量精度高但难以扩展到区域或全球范围，而卫星高光谱成像覆盖范围广但解释性差，需要桥接这一差距。

Method: 提出DeepSalt框架，结合知识蒸馏和新型光谱适配单元，将实验室光谱的高分辨率洞察迁移到卫星高光谱传感中。

Result: DeepSalt在综合实证基准测试中显著优于无显式域适应的方法，证明了光谱适配单元和知识蒸馏策略的有效性，模型还能有效泛化到未见过的地理区域。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了一个能够准确估计大范围土壤盐度的深度学习方法，无需大量地面采样，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

TL;DR: 本文通过TLS谱线拟合的统一视角，重新解释了Bigun和Granlund 1987与Granlund和Knutsson 1995提出的两种结构张量构造方法，发现它们可以相互协调，并带来额外优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨两种看似不同的结构张量构造方法（梯度滤波响应外积平均与正交滤波器调谐频率向量加权外积）之间的内在联系，寻求统一的理论框架。

Method: 使用总最小二乘法(TLS)谱线拟合作为共同分析框架，重新解释两种结构张量构造方法，并分析Granlund和Knutsson 1995方法中修正项的必要性。

Result: 发现两种方法在TLS框架下可以协调，Granlund和Knutsson 1995的修正项变得不必要，省略后能保证张量半正定性，简化特征值解释，并允许使用非正交滤波器和非角度镶嵌。

Conclusion: TLS视角为结构张量构造提供了统一框架，消除了对正交滤波器的依赖，扩展了可用滤波器类型，并支持多方向拟合，为结构张量分析带来更大灵活性。

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

Motivation: 现有方法中，一些参考点往往远离目标物体，容易导致误检。需要确保参考点从物体表面或内部采样，并解决部分遮挡问题。

Method: 使用深度信息和2D检测生成深度引导的查询，确保参考点从物体表面或内部采样；引入混合注意力机制，融合历史检测结果与深度引导查询形成混合查询。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，mAP提升6.3%，NDS提升4.3%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DQ3D方法通过深度引导的查询生成和混合注意力机制，有效提升了3D物体检测性能，特别是在处理误检和部分遮挡方面表现出色。

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

Motivation: 现有方法难以准确评估新兴预训练模型的可迁移性，这些模型具有多样化架构、训练策略和任务对齐方式。

Method: ITM框架隐式建模模型内在可迁移性，采用分治变分近似策略高效近似嵌入空间演化。

Result: 在涵盖广泛训练机制和模型类型的综合基准测试中，ITM在稳定性、有效性和效率方面始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ITM能够更准确地评估预训练模型的可迁移性，推动预训练-微调范式的发展。

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

Result: 在标准KITTI数据集达到93.92%准确率，在新建的E3D挖掘机数据集上比基线显著提升24.88%，证明了在复杂工业场景中对不可靠模态信息的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AG-Fusion方法能够有效识别可靠模式并选择性融合跨模态知识，在复杂和挑战性环境中实现鲁棒的3D目标检测。

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D
dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in
complex industrial scenes.

Motivation: 现有3D场景类比方法需要额外训练和固定对象词汇表，限制了在未见环境中的适应性。本文旨在利用基础模型实现零样本、开放词汇的3D场景对应。

Method: 采用混合神经表示：基于视觉语言模型特征的稀疏图和3D形状基础模型的特征场。通过先对齐图结构再使用特征场细化对应的粗到精方式寻找场景类比。

Result: 方法能够在复杂场景间建立准确对应关系，并展示了在轨迹和路径点转移方面的应用。

Conclusion: 提出的零样本方法成功实现了开放词汇的3D场景类比，为机器人适应和规划提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究视觉语言模型在零样本异常检测中的空间推理能力，通过将视频转换为文本描述并使用文本蕴含来评分，评估了四个开源模型在UCF-Crime和RWF-2000数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会广泛使用摄像头产生海量视频数据，远超人工监控能力，这对公共安全和犯罪事件及时检测提出严峻挑战。需要研究具身代理识别异常事件的能力，这与其空间推理能力密切相关。

Method: 将异常动作识别构建为零样本、语言基础的任务，通过将视频转换为文本描述，使用文本蕴含对标签进行评分。评估了四个预训练视觉-LLM模型在提示和隐私保护条件下的表现。

Result: 少样本示例可以提升某些模型的准确性，但可能增加误报；隐私过滤器（尤其是全身GAN变换）会引入不一致性降低准确率。当前模型在简单、空间显著事件上表现良好，但在噪声空间线索和身份模糊情况下表现不佳。

Conclusion: 提出了无需任务特定训练即可增强空间基础的具体路径：结构感知提示、跨片段的轻量级空间记忆、描述过程中的场景图或3D姿态先验，以及保留动作相关几何的隐私方法。这为零样本、语言基础的管道作为具身现实世界视频理解的适应性构建模块奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DecoDINO是一个基于DECO框架的三分支网络，用于改进人体与物体之间的顶点级接触预测，通过双DINOv2编码器、类别平衡损失权重和补丁级交叉注意力机制，在DAMON基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DECO模型在野外环境下的人体-物体接触预测存在局限性，包括只能生成二元接触图、在软表面、遮挡、儿童和误报脚部接触方面表现不佳。

Method: 使用两个DINOv2 ViT-g/14编码器构建三分支网络，采用类别平衡损失权重减少偏差，通过补丁级交叉注意力改进局部推理，顶点特征通过轻量级MLP和softmax分配语义接触标签。

Result: 在DAMON基准测试中：二元接触F1分数提升7%，测地误差减半，增加了物体级语义标签预测；消融研究表明LoRA微调和双编码器是关键改进因素。

Conclusion: DecoDINO在DAMON挑战赛的两个任务中都优于基准方法，证明了其在人体-物体接触预测任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding
objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models
used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the
wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and
struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot
contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch
network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,
class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention
for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a
lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also
tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the
simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON
benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii)
halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level
semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual
encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge
baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at

TL;DR: VR-Drive是一个端到端自动驾驶框架，通过联合学习3D场景重建作为辅助任务来解决相机视角变化问题，提高规划鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶在处理不同相机视角时缺乏鲁棒性，这是现实世界中由于车辆配置多样化带来的常见挑战。

Method: 采用前馈推理策略，支持从稀疏视图进行在线训练时增强；引入视角混合记忆库促进多视角时间交互；使用视角一致性蒸馏策略从原始视图向合成视图传递知识。

Result: VR-Drive有效减轻了合成引起的噪声，在视角变化下改进了规划性能，并发布了新的基准数据集用于评估。

Conclusion: VR-Drive是端到端自动驾驶系统在现实世界部署的可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决WSI检索的挑战：千兆像素规模、捕捉细微语义差异困难、大量无关内容干扰，以支持精确诊断、提高观察者一致性和辅助基于案例的教育。

Method: 统一细粒度注意力马赛克表示与全局幻灯片嵌入，通过视觉-语言对比学习在6926个幻灯片-报告对上训练，支持图像到图像检索和多模态文本查询检索。

Result: 在四个公共病理数据集和三个内部队列上评估，涵盖解剖部位检索、肿瘤亚型分类、肿瘤与非肿瘤区分、分级等任务，优于传统检索框架，提高诊断准确性、置信度和观察者间一致性。

Conclusion: PathSearch是一个可扩展且通用的数字病理学检索解决方案，在真实临床场景中表现出色。

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable
retrieval solution for digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了最先进的深度伪造检测器在受莫尔条纹影响的视频上的表现，发现莫尔伪影会使检测性能下降高达25.4%，而去莫尔方法反而会加剧问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中智能手机从数字屏幕拍摄的媒体经常引入莫尔伪影，这会扭曲检测结果，但这个问题在深度伪造检测研究中很少受到关注。

Method: 收集了12,832个视频的数据集，涵盖多个数据集，并在不同真实条件下拍摄。使用DeepMoiréFake数据集和两种合成莫尔生成技术进行额外实验，评估了15个顶级检测器。

Result: 莫尔伪影使检测性能下降高达25.4%，合成生成的莫尔模式导致准确率下降21.4%。去莫尔方法反而使准确率降低达17.2%。

Conclusion: 迫切需要能够稳健处理莫尔失真及其他现实挑战的检测模型。通过引入DMF数据集，旨在推动研究缩小受控实验与实际深度伪造检测之间的差距。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归Transformer方法在手写文本生成中需要额外输入、缺乏停止机制、容易产生重复循环和视觉伪影，需要改进内容可控性。

Method: 将HTG作为多模态提示条件生成任务，引入特殊文本输入标记以更好地与视觉标记对齐，并设计基于Classifier-Free-Guidance的自回归模型策略。

Result: 相比先前解决方案，Eruku需要更少输入，对未见风格泛化更好，更忠实地遵循文本提示，提高了内容依从性。

Conclusion: Eruku方法通过重新定义问题框架和改进模型设计，有效解决了手写文本生成中的内容可控性问题，取得了更好的生成效果。

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

<details>

Motivation: 解决传统恒定补丁大小采样在3D医学图像分割中存在的类别不平衡问题，并提升训练效率。

Method: 采用渐进式课程学习策略，在模型训练过程中逐步增加输入补丁的尺寸，设计了资源高效模式和性能模式两种设置。

Result: 资源高效模式在保持Dice分数性能的同时将训练时间减少至44%；性能模式在15个任务中均超越基线，平均Dice分数提升1.28%，训练时间减少至89%。

Conclusion: 这种简单而优雅的数据变换策略显著提升了分割性能和训练效率，且适用于多种分割架构，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对视觉语言模型依赖增加，需要评估多模态模型的复杂性和发展方向，特别是解决文本主导问题和探索模态间交互。

Method: 使用Shapley值计算特征归因和模态评分，将视频帧和文本元素视为平等特征，将多选VQA任务视为视频、问题和答案三个模态的交互。

Result: 结果显示模型对文本的依赖性强，多选VQA任务实际上变成了模型忽略干扰项的能力测试。

Conclusion: 当前VLM模型存在文本主导问题，多选VQA任务未能有效评估多模态理解能力，需要更平衡的评估方法。

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

Motivation: 现实世界对象具有自然的层次化组织结构，传统CNN分类方法仅关注平面分类，无法利用对象间的关系来提升分类效果和控制错误严重程度。

Method: 在YOLO模型基础上构建端到端层次化模型，引入层次化架构设计、改进的损失函数和专用层次化性能评估指标，在两种不同层次化分类的数据集上进行训练评估。

Result: 所提方法能够有效处理现实世界对象固有的层次结构，相比传统平面分类算法具有更好的性能表现。

Conclusion: 层次化模型能够更好地捕捉对象间的关系，提供更好的上下文理解和错误控制，是图像分类任务的重要改进方向。

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

Motivation: 基于微分方程求解的扩散生成过程需要在计算速度和样本质量之间取得平衡。理论研究发现ODE和SDE求解器存在互补弱点：ODE沿确定性轨迹积累不可约梯度误差，SDE在步数有限时遭受放大的离散化误差。

Method: 引入AdaSDE，一种新颖的单步SDE求解器，通过轻量级蒸馏估计每个步骤的可学习系数，动态调节误差校正强度以加速扩散采样。该框架可与现有求解器集成。

Result: 在5 NFE下，AdaSDE在CIFAR-10上达到4.18的FID分数，在FFHQ上达到8.05，在LSUN Bedroom上达到6.96，表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: AdaSDE成功统一了ODE的效率和SDE的误差弹性，通过动态调节误差校正强度，在有限步数下实现了优异的扩散采样性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available

Motivation: 现有讽刺检测方法主要关注单图像场景，忽略了多图像之间的语义和情感关系，无法有效建模真实世界中由多图像线索触发的讽刺情况。

Method: 提出跨图像推理模型(CIRM)，进行目标跨图像序列建模以捕捉潜在的图像间联系；引入基于文本-图像对应关系的相关性引导细粒度跨模态融合机制。

Result: MMSD3.0被证明是有效可靠的基准，能更好反映真实世界条件；CIRM在MMSD、MMSD2.0和MMSD3.0上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在单图像和多图像场景下都有效，填补了多图像讽刺检测的研究空白。

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and
methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential
semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in
modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world
settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed
entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We
further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted
cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In
addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion
mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during
integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative
baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an
effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.
Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0
and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了MDReID框架，解决多模态物体重识别中的模态不一致问题，通过模态解耦学习和模态感知度量学习实现任意模态间的匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的物体重识别系统经常面临模态不一致问题（如RGB、NIR、TIR等不同传感器），但现有方法大多假设模态匹配条件，限制了实际应用中的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: MDReID包含两个关键组件：模态解耦学习（MDL）将模态特征分解为模态共享特征和模态特定特征；模态感知度量学习（MML）通过正交性和互补性增强跨模态判别能力。

Result: 在三个多模态ReID基准测试（RGBNT201、RGBNT100、MSVR310）上，MDReID在模态匹配场景中分别获得9.8%、3.0%、11.5%的mAP提升，在模态不匹配场景中平均获得3.4%、11.8%、10.9%的增益。

Conclusion: MDReID是一个灵活的多模态物体重识别框架，能够有效处理模态匹配和不匹配场景，显著提升了跨模态检索性能。

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出ReconViaGen方法，通过将重建先验整合到生成框架中，解决多视图3D重建中因遮挡和稀疏覆盖导致的完整性问题，实现与输入视图一致的完整准确3D模型重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视图3D重建方法严重依赖输入视图间的充分重叠，实际中遮挡和稀疏覆盖常导致重建不完整。基于扩散的3D生成技术虽能通过生成先验补全不可见部分，但其随机性限制了生成结果的准确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出ReconViaGen框架，分析扩散基3D生成方法一致性不足的原因：(a)提取多视图图像特征作为条件时构建和利用跨视图连接的不足；(b)迭代去噪在局部细节生成中可控性差，导致与输入不一致的几何和纹理细节。设计相应策略将重建先验整合到生成框架中。

Result: 大量实验表明，ReconViaGen能够在全局结构和局部细节上重建与输入视图一致的完整准确3D模型。

Conclusion: ReconViaGen通过创新性地将重建先验整合到生成框架中，有效解决了多视图3D重建中的完整性和一致性问题，为结合3D生成先验的重建方法提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PlanarTrack，一个用于平面跟踪的大规模高质量基准数据集，包含1150个序列、超过73.3万帧，支持短期和长期跟踪性能评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面跟踪在机器人和增强现实中具有重要作用，但由于缺乏大规模平台，其发展受到限制。

Method: 构建包含1000个短期和150个长期视频的数据集，所有视频在无约束条件下录制，每个帧通过四个角点手动标注，确保每个序列包含唯一目标以增强多样性。

Result: PlanarTrack是目前最大、最多样化、最具挑战性的平面跟踪数据集，评估显示现有顶级平面跟踪器在该数据集上性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 需要更多努力来改进平面跟踪技术，该数据集为未来研究提供了比较基准。

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at

*Songxi Yang,Tang Sui,Qunying Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的遥感超分辨率框架LSSR，基于预训练的Stable Diffusion模型，通过整合多模态辅助信息和SAR引导，在保持高效推理的同时实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有遥感超分辨率方法面临的三个主要挑战：扩散模型训练成本高且推理慢、辅助信息利用不足、缺乏下游任务评估。

Method: 基于冻结预训练的Stable Diffusion，集成跨模态注意力机制，结合DEM、土地覆盖、月份等辅助知识以及SAR引导，使用适配器和定制傅里叶NDVI损失来平衡空间细节和光谱保真度。

Result: LSSR显著改善了作物边界描绘和恢复，在RGB和IR通道上分别达到PSNR/SSIM为32.63/0.84和23.99/0.78，NDVI均方误差最低为0.042，推理效率为0.39秒/图像。在HLS超分辨率任务中，作物分类F1分数达到0.86，优于Sentinel-2的0.85。

Conclusion: LSSR展示了遥感超分辨率在推进精准农业方面的潜力，提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

TL;DR: 提出VideoTG-R1框架，通过边界反射代理和难度估计代理解决视频时序定位中的部分标注样本和难定位样本问题，实现高效课程强化学习训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在视频时序定位中忽略了训练样本质量和难度问题：部分标注样本引入模糊监督，难定位样本在RL训练中产生低且难以区分的奖励，阻碍学习效率。

Method: 1. 边界反射代理：利用MLLMs预测标注区间外的相关时间戳，识别并过滤部分标注样本；2. 难度估计代理：评估样本训练难度，设计课程RL策略动态屏蔽难定位样本的视频内容。

Result: 在VTG和基于视频的问答任务上表现优异，仅使用10%训练样本和21%计算预算，就超越了使用全部数据的GRPO和SFT方法。

Conclusion: VideoTG-R1通过解决样本质量和难度问题，实现了数据高效的视频时序定位训练，显著提升了性能并降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos
based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video
understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the
challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.
(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond
the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground
samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and
indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference
among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with
reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,
we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict
query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to
identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing
ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess
the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that
dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the
training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer
preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples
and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data
counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at
https://github.com/ldong1111/VideoTG-R1.

insufficient input dimension. We construct two optimization schemes and combine
them, which achieves the performance improvement of indicators such as PSNR and
SSIM of the images after DDColor.

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural
networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate
that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such
as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning
capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision
transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts
DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information
from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms.
It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of
downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while
generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show
that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining
strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and
multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI
modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces
dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a

Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
city monitoring.

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了草图约束的直接整合，为CAD逆向工程提供了更有效的解决方案，更贴近实际设计工作流程。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the
reconstruction process.

Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a
notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques,
leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However,
the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular
distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional
neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised
Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples,
enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification
performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based
on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic
unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class
distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream
task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image
datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We
investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised
sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning
component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that
the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy
of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray
dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50.
Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%,
80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM
datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

Conclusion: FRBNet作为即插即用模块能有效提升低光视觉任务性能，无需修改损失函数

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
+2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanIng-V2X是首个大规模多模态数据集，支持车辆和基础设施传感器在德国英戈尔施塔特三个城市交叉口的协同感知，包含34个时间对齐和空间校准的传感器序列，提供12个车载RGB摄像头、2个车载LiDAR、17个基础设施热成像摄像头和12个基础设施LiDAR的数据，共约712k个标注实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实世界数据集通常局限于单个交叉口或单个车辆，缺乏多车辆和多基础设施传感器在多个交叉口的综合感知数据集，这限制了算法在不同交通环境中的基准测试，可能导致过拟合和误导性的高性能表现。

Method: 在德国英戈尔施塔特三个城市交叉口部署协同感知系统，收集34个时间对齐和空间校准的传感器序列，每个序列持续20秒，包含两辆车辆和最多三个基础设施传感器杆的协调场景数据。

Result: 数据集包含12个车载RGB摄像头、2个车载LiDAR、17个基础设施热成像摄像头和12个基础设施LiDAR的数据，所有序列以10Hz频率标注3D边界框，涵盖13个对象类别，总共约712k个标注实例。

Conclusion: UrbanIng-V2X填补了多车辆和多基础设施传感器在多个交叉口的协同感知数据集空白，提供了全面的评估和公开的代码库、数据集、高清地图以及完整数据收集环境的数字孪生。

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MergeMix是一种连接监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)的训练时增强范式，通过注意力感知的图像混合和偏好驱动训练来提升多模态大语言模型的视觉语言对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SFT需要大量人工标注且无法捕捉细微偏好，以及RL训练开销大且不稳定的问题，在可扩展性、鲁棒性和对齐质量之间找到平衡。

Method: 首先通过token合并进行注意力感知的图像混合，保留更多聚类表示和空间上下文；然后构建混合图像与原始图像的偏好对，使用SimPO损失进行优化。

Result: MergeMix在分类任务中超越了其他基于启发式的方法，实现了具有竞争力的准确率和改进的效率。

Conclusion: MergeMix为分类和多模态大语言模型中的偏好对齐提供了一种可扩展的方法，增强了注意力一致性和训练效率。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
(RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations
and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现大型视觉语言模型生成的视觉-文本多模态思维链存在视觉信息不准确的问题，提出了一种基于充分成分因果模型的学习策略来提升视觉推理的忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-文本多模态思维链虽然能给出正确答案，但其中包含的视觉信息往往不准确，表明推理过程缺乏忠实性。这源于强化微调中的奖励机制只激励视觉-文本交替格式，而不考虑视觉信息的正确性。

Method: 提出充分成分因果模型学习策略，鼓励模型生成充分且最小化的视觉组件，这些组件能够独立导致正确答案。该方法无需标注，可与各种强化微调方法即插即用。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在一系列细粒度感知和推理基准上持续提升了视觉忠实度。

Conclusion: SCCM学习策略能有效解决MCoT中视觉信息不可靠和不充分的问题，显著提升多模态推理的忠实性。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is
available at https://github.com/EugeneLiu01/Faithful_Thinking_with_Image.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合扩散先验与物理渲染的混合重光照框架，通过时间正则化和光学流引导实现更稳定的体积视频重光照效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前体积视频重光照方法在时间稳定性方面存在不足，扩散方法在单帧效果好但扩展到序列时存在随机噪声和不稳定性，而视频扩散模型受限于内存和规模。

Method: 结合扩散先验与物理渲染的混合框架，使用光学流引导的时间正则化聚合多帧材质属性，从高斯不透明度场提取网格代理进行间接效果渲染。

Result: 在真实和合成捕获数据上的实验表明，该方法比纯扩散基线在序列重光照稳定性方面显著提升，且能处理超出视频扩散可行范围的长序列。

Conclusion: 混合方法平衡学习先验与物理约束，是实现生产级体积视频重光照的实用步骤。

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances
into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally
stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition
methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and
instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain
constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that
combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and
physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic
estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading
components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such
as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity
Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real
and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially
more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while
scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results
indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically
grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric
video relighting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在复杂推理任务中高质量图像-文本数据稀缺的问题，利用丰富的文本推理资源来增强VLM的推理能力

Method: 结合GRPO强化学习和在线策略蒸馏，通过教师模型指导学生模型的推理轨迹，并采用冷启动对齐确保有效迁移

Result: 在MMMU-Pro、MathVision、MathVista和LogicVista等多个基准测试中显著超越基线模型，达到最先进水平

Conclusion: VOLD框架成功实现了从文本教师模型到视觉语言学生的推理能力迁移，冷启动对齐对于在线蒸馏至关重要

Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a
challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning
data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

Result: 在多个医学图像数据集上的实验评估显示，iPac相比基线方法平均准确率提升高达5%。

Conclusion: iPac通过利用图表示并考虑视觉实体之间的固有结构和关系，为图像分类特别是医学图像分类提供了一个通用且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image
processing, yet their performance in image classification tasks is hindered by
a limited consideration of the underlying structure and relationships among
visual entities. This work presents iPac, a novel approach to introduce a new
graph representation of images to enhance graph neural network image
classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and
relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages,
including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph
construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph
neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and
organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation
that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental
evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac,
exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.
Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,
particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph
representation and accounting for the inherent structure and relationships
among visual entities.

TL;DR: FreeFuse提出了一种无需训练的多主体文本到图像生成方法，通过自动融合多个主体LoRA，利用交叉注意力层权重动态生成主体掩码，实现高质量的多主体生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么专注于预推理阶段的LoRA权重合并，要么依赖分割模型和复杂的噪声混合技术来隔离LoRA输出，这些方法存在效率低下和实用性不足的问题。

Method: 基于交叉注意力层权重自动推导上下文感知的动态主体掩码，在推理过程中将这些掩码直接应用于LoRA输出，无需额外训练或修改LoRA。

Result: FreeFuse在多主体生成任务中，在生成质量和可用性方面均优于现有方法，且无需额外训练、无需修改LoRA、无需辅助模型。

Conclusion: FreeFuse提供了一种实用且高效的多主体文本到图像生成解决方案，仅需用户提供LoRA激活词即可无缝集成到标准工作流程中。

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

Motivation: 真实世界LiDAR点云标注成本高昂，现有自训练无监督域自适应方法未能有效利用未标记数据，依赖预定义或固定置信度阈值导致性能欠佳。

Method: 1. 动态伪标签过滤(DPLF)方案增强真实数据利用；2. 先验引导数据增强管道(PG-DAP)缓解域偏移；3. 数据混合一致性损失学习上下文无关表示。

Conclusion: 所提出的动态伪标签过滤和先验引导数据增强方法能够有效提升点云语义分割的无监督域自适应性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

Result: EgoThinker在多个自我中心基准测试中优于现有方法，在细粒度时空定位任务上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: EgoThinker成功解决了自我中心视频推理的核心挑战，为多模态大语言模型提供了有效的自我中心推理能力。

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera
who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden
intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge
limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible
event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust
egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought
supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M,
a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric
video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with
detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT
on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning
RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show
that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric
benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained
spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at

Motivation: 现有生成式深度估计方法在训练时会导致预训练模型图像生成能力的灾难性退化，需要开发既能进行深度估计又不损害原始生成能力的统一模型。

Method: 引入可插拔框架，通过简单转换器实现图像生成和深度估计模式切换；提出组重用机制促进参数重用，提高额外可学习参数的利用率。

Result: MERGE在多个深度估计基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时成功保持了预训练模型的图像生成能力。

Conclusion: 预训练文本到图像模型不仅能用于图像生成，还能轻松扩展到深度估计任务，MERGE展示了这种统一模型的强大潜力。

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degradation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a
play-and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image
generation and depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters.
Meanwhile, we propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and
improve the utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes
the powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other
unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The

Motivation: 音频驱动人体动画模型在时间自回归生成过程中容易出现身份漂移问题，现有基于关键帧的方法需要额外生成阶段且限制自然运动动态。

Method: 提出前瞻锚定方法，使用当前生成窗口前方未来时间步的关键帧作为方向性信标，模型在响应即时音频提示的同时持续追求这些未来锚点，实现自我关键帧化。

Result: 应用于三个最新人体动画模型后，该方法在唇部同步、身份保持和视觉质量方面表现优异，时间前瞻距离自然控制表达性与一致性的平衡。

Conclusion: Lookahead Anchoring方法通过时间前瞻锚定机制有效改善了多种架构的时间条件化效果，无需额外关键帧生成即可实现身份一致性保持。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

Conclusion: FARMER成功统一了归一化流和自回归模型，解决了像素级建模的冗余和复杂度问题，实现了高效的图像生成和似然估计。

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

TL;DR: 提出了InFlux基准数据集，为具有动态相机内参的视频提供逐帧真实内参标注，包含14.3万+标注帧和386个高分辨率视频，解决了现有基准缺乏动态内参变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D算法通常假设相机内参在视频中保持不变，但真实视频中内参经常变化。该领域的主要障碍是缺乏动态相机内参基准数据集。

Method: 构建了全面的校准实验查找表，扩展了Kalibr工具箱以提高准确性和鲁棒性，创建了包含室内外视频的多样化数据集。

Result: 评估现有基线方法发现，大多数方法在动态内参视频上难以实现准确预测，突显了该基准的必要性。

Conclusion: InFlux基准填补了动态相机内参评估的空白，为相关研究提供了重要的数据集和评估平台。

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

*Yusu Qian,Cheng Wan,Chao Jia,Yinfei Yang,Qingyu Zhao,Zhe Gan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM-Bench是一个基于视觉谜题的基准测试，专门用于评估模型推理过程而非仅关注最终答案准确性。它要求模型在包含一个错误的逐步推理链中识别第一个错误步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法仅关注最终答案准确性，无法评估模型推理过程的逻辑一致性。需要一种诊断性评估来区分流畅生成与忠实推理之间的差距。

Method: 设计包含多步符号、几何和类比推理的视觉谜题，要求模型在包含一个错误的推理链中定位第一个错误步骤，从而评估逻辑一致性和错误检测能力。

Result: 评估显示最先进的多模态大语言模型在流畅生成与忠实推理之间存在持续差距，模型能生成看似合理的推理链但无法定位简单逻辑错误。

Conclusion: PRISM-Bench通过分离答案生成与推理验证，为多模态推理能力提供了更精确的评估框架，强调在开发可信赖MLLM时需要诊断性评估协议。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual
challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but
how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only
final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual
puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error,
models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables
fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual
reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric,
and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern
matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap
between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible
CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer
generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on
multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic
evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelRefer是一个统一的区域级多模态大语言模型框架，专注于细粒度的对象级理解，通过尺度自适应对象标记器和对象中心融合模块，在图像和视频中实现高效的区域级分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs主要关注整体场景理解，忽视了细粒度的对象中心推理需求。需要开发能够处理用户指定区域的精细理解能力。

Method: 提出尺度自适应对象标记器(SAOT)生成紧凑的对象表示，并设计PixelRefer-Lite变体，通过对象中心融合模块将全局上下文预融合到对象标记中，形成轻量级的仅对象框架。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PixelRefer以更少的训练样本实现领先性能，PixelRefer-Lite在保持高语义保真度的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: PixelRefer框架成功解决了MLLMs在细粒度对象理解方面的不足，提供了高效且准确的区域级视觉理解能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

TL;DR: TIRE方法通过跟踪、修复和重投影技术，显著提升了3D/4D生成中的语义身份保持能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D/4D生成方法在保持跨视角语义身份一致性方面存在不足，个性化3D/4D生成研究仍不充分

Method: 使用现有3D生成模型输出作为输入，通过视频跟踪识别需修改区域，采用主题驱动的2D修复模型逐步填充，最后将修改后的多视角观测重投影回3D

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在3D/4D生成的身份保持方面显著优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: TIRE方法有效解决了3D/4D生成中的语义身份保持问题，为个性化3D/4D生成提供了新思路

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Concerto是一个模拟人类概念学习的简约框架，通过3D模态内自蒸馏和2D-3D跨模态联合嵌入，学习更连贯的空间特征，在3D场景感知任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类通过多感官协同学习抽象概念的启发，希望开发能够从单一模态回忆多模态表示的空间认知模型。

Method: 结合3D模态内自蒸馏和2D-3D跨模态联合嵌入的简约框架，还包含针对视频点云空间理解的变体和将表示线性投影到CLIP语言空间的翻译器。

Result: 在零样本可视化中学习到更连贯的空间特征；在线性探测中比现有2D和3D自监督模型分别提升14.2%和4.8%；在ScanNet等基准测试中达到80.7% mIoU的新SOTA结果。

Conclusion: Concerto能够学习具有优越细粒度几何和语义一致性的空间表示，支持开放世界感知。

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

*Pavlos Ntais*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了Jailbreak Mimicry方法，通过参数高效微调训练小型攻击模型，自动生成基于叙事的越狱提示，在GPT-OSS-20B上达到81.0%攻击成功率，相比直接提示提升54倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型仍容易受到复杂提示工程攻击，利用上下文框架绕过安全机制，对网络安全应用构成重大风险。

Method: 使用参数高效微调(LoRA)在Mistral-7B上训练，基于AdvBench的精选数据集，开发自动生成叙事式越狱提示的系统方法。

Result: 在GPT-OSS-20B上达到81.0%攻击成功率，对其他模型也有效：GPT-4(66.5%)、Llama-3(79.5%)、Gemini 2.5 Flash(33.0%)。技术领域(网络安全93%)和欺骗类攻击(欺诈87.8%)特别脆弱。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前安全对齐方法的系统性漏洞，技术领域和欺骗攻击特别易受攻击，需要开发防御策略来缓解AI网络安全中的这些漏洞。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to sophisticated prompt
engineering attacks that exploit contextual framing to bypass safety
mechanisms, posing significant risks in cybersecurity applications. We
introduce Jailbreak Mimicry, a systematic methodology for training compact
attacker models to automatically generate narrative-based jailbreak prompts in
a one-shot manner. Our approach transforms adversarial prompt discovery from
manual craftsmanship into a reproducible scientific process, enabling proactive
vulnerability assessment in AI-driven security systems. Developed for the
OpenAI GPT-OSS-20B Red-Teaming Challenge, we use parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (LoRA) on Mistral-7B with a curated dataset derived from AdvBench,
achieving an 81.0% Attack Success Rate (ASR) against GPT-OSS-20B on a held-out
test set of 200 items. Cross-model evaluation reveals significant variation in
vulnerability patterns: our attacks achieve 66.5% ASR against GPT-4, 79.5% on
Llama-3 and 33.0% against Gemini 2.5 Flash, demonstrating both broad
applicability and model-specific defensive strengths in cybersecurity contexts.
This represents a 54x improvement over direct prompting (1.5% ASR) and
demonstrates systematic vulnerabilities in current safety alignment approaches.
Our analysis reveals that technical domains (Cybersecurity: 93% ASR) and
deception-based attacks (Fraud: 87.8% ASR) are particularly vulnerable,
highlighting threats to AI-integrated threat detection, malware analysis, and
secure systems, while physical harm categories show greater resistance (55.6%
ASR). We employ automated harmfulness evaluation using Claude Sonnet 4,
cross-validated with human expert assessment, ensuring reliable and scalable
evaluation for cybersecurity red-teaming. Finally, we analyze failure
mechanisms and discuss defensive strategies to mitigate these vulnerabilities
in AI for cybersecurity.

TL;DR: Fast-MIA是一个用于高效评估大型语言模型成员推理攻击的Python库，解决了计算成本高和缺乏标准化实现的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着版权、安全和数据隐私问题日益突出，针对LLMs的成员推理攻击研究变得至关重要，但面临高计算成本和缺乏标准化实现两大障碍。

Method: 提供快速批量推理功能，并在统一评估框架下实现了代表性MIA方法，支持简单配置和可扩展性。

Result: 开发了开源工具Fast-MIA，支持可扩展和透明的LLMs研究。

Conclusion: Fast-MIA库通过提供高效推理和标准化实现，促进了成员推理攻击研究的可复现性和大规模实证比较。

Abstract: We propose Fast-MIA (https://github.com/Nikkei/fast-mia), a Python library
for efficiently evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against Large
Language Models (LLMs). MIA against LLMs has emerged as a crucial challenge due
to growing concerns over copyright, security, and data privacy, and has
attracted increasing research attention. However, the progress of this research
is significantly hindered by two main obstacles: (1) the high computational
cost of inference in LLMs, and (2) the lack of standardized and maintained
implementations of MIA methods, which makes large-scale empirical comparison
difficult. To address these challenges, our library provides fast batch
inference and includes implementations of representative MIA methods under a
unified evaluation framework. This library supports easy implementation of
reproducible benchmarks with simple configuration and extensibility. We release
Fast-MIA as an open-source (Apache License 2.0) tool to support scalable and
transparent research on LLMs.

*Chenyu Zhang,Tairen Zhang,Lanjun Wang,Ruidong Chen,Wenhui Li,Anan Liu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了T2I-RiskyPrompt基准，包含6,432个有效风险提示，采用分层风险分类法（6个主类别、14个子类别），用于评估文本到图像模型的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风险提示数据集存在三个主要限制：风险类别有限、标注粒度粗糙、有效性低，需要更全面的基准来评估T2I模型安全性。

Method: 开发分层风险分类法，构建收集和标注风险提示的流程，提出基于原因的风险图像检测方法，将MLLM与安全标注对齐。

Result: 对8个T2I模型、9种防御方法、5个安全过滤器和5种攻击策略进行全面评估，提供了9个关于T2I模型安全性的关键见解。

Conclusion: T2I-RiskyPrompt基准能够有效评估T2I模型安全性，并在多个研究领域具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Using risky text prompts, such as pornography and violent prompts, to test
the safety of text-to-image (T2I) models is a critical task. However, existing
risky prompt datasets are limited in three key areas: 1) limited risky
categories, 2) coarse-grained annotation, and 3) low effectiveness. To address
these limitations, we introduce T2I-RiskyPrompt, a comprehensive benchmark
designed for evaluating safety-related tasks in T2I models. Specifically, we
first develop a hierarchical risk taxonomy, which consists of 6 primary
categories and 14 fine-grained subcategories. Building upon this taxonomy, we
construct a pipeline to collect and annotate risky prompts. Finally, we obtain
6,432 effective risky prompts, where each prompt is annotated with both
hierarchical category labels and detailed risk reasons. Moreover, to facilitate
the evaluation, we propose a reason-driven risky image detection method that
explicitly aligns the MLLM with safety annotations. Based on T2I-RiskyPrompt,
we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of eight T2I models, nine defense
methods, five safety filters, and five attack strategies, offering nine key
insights into the strengths and limitations of T2I model safety. Finally, we
discuss potential applications of T2I-RiskyPrompt across various research
fields. The dataset and code are provided in

### [328] [Privacy-Aware Federated nnU-Net for ECG Page Digitization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22387)
*Nader Nemati*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨机构联邦学习框架，用于将ECG页面图像转换为可分析波形，在保护隐私的同时实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式训练与跨机构隐私和部署约束存在冲突，需要在不共享图像的情况下实现ECG数字化。

Method: 使用nnU-Net分割骨干网络，集成FedAvg、FedProx和FedAdam三种聚合器，结合安全聚合和中心差分隐私保护。

Result: FedAdam相比FedAvg和FedProx收敛更快且达到更高性能，接近集中式训练效果，同时保持隐私保护。

Conclusion: 该框架在保护原始图像和客户端更新的同时，实现了可部署、可审计的隐私保证，适用于多机构环境。

Abstract: Deep neural networks can convert ECG page images into analyzable waveforms,
yet centralized training often conflicts with cross-institutional privacy and
deployment constraints. A cross-silo federated digitization framework is
presented that trains a full-model nnU-Net segmentation backbone without
sharing images and aggregates updates across sites under realistic non-IID
heterogeneity (layout, grid style, scanner profile, noise).
  The protocol integrates three standard server-side aggregators--FedAvg,
FedProx, and FedAdam--and couples secure aggregation with central, user-level
differential privacy to align utility with formal guarantees. Key features
include: (i) end-to-end full-model training and synchronization across clients;
(ii) secure aggregation so the server only observes a clipped, weighted sum
once a participation threshold is met; (iii) central Gaussian DP with Renyi
accounting applied post-aggregation for auditable user-level privacy; and (iv)
a calibration-aware digitization pipeline comprising page normalization, trace
segmentation, grid-leakage suppression, and vectorization to twelve-lead
signals.
  Experiments on ECG pages rendered from PTB-XL show consistently faster
convergence and higher late-round plateaus with adaptive server updates
(FedAdam) relative to FedAvg and FedProx, while approaching centralized
performance. The privacy mechanism maintains competitive accuracy while
preventing exposure of raw images or per-client updates, yielding deployable,
auditable guarantees suitable for multi-institution settings.

TL;DR: 构建了大规模多模态深度伪造数据集Mega-MMDF和首个统一基准DeepfakeBench-MM，以应对AI生成伪造内容带来的社会风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应对生成式AI滥用导致伪造音视频内容泛滥的社会风险（如金融欺诈和社会不稳定），解决现有方法缺乏足够多样化训练数据和标准化基准的问题。

Method: 通过21种伪造流程构建Mega-MMDF数据集（包含10种音频伪造、12种视觉伪造和6种音频驱动人脸重演方法），建立DeepfakeBench-MM统一基准，支持5个数据集和11种多模态深度伪造检测器。

Result: Mega-MMDF包含10万真实样本和110万伪造样本，是目前最大最全的多模态深度伪造数据集；基准评估揭示了多个关键发现（如数据增强、堆叠伪造等）。

Conclusion: DeepfakeBench-MM和Mega-MMDF将为推进多模态深度伪造检测提供基础性基础设施。

Abstract: The misuse of advanced generative AI models has resulted in the widespread
proliferation of falsified data, particularly forged human-centric audiovisual
content, which poses substantial societal risks (e.g., financial fraud and
social instability). In response to this growing threat, several works have
preliminarily explored countermeasures. However, the lack of sufficient and
diverse training data, along with the absence of a standardized benchmark,
hinder deeper exploration. To address this challenge, we first build Mega-MMDF,
a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset for multimodal deepfake
detection. Specifically, we employ 21 forgery pipelines through the combination
of 10 audio forgery methods, 12 visual forgery methods, and 6 audio-driven face
reenactment methods. Mega-MMDF currently contains 0.1 million real samples and
1.1 million forged samples, making it one of the largest and most diverse
multimodal deepfake datasets, with plans for continuous expansion. Building on
it, we present DeepfakeBench-MM, the first unified benchmark for multimodal
deepfake detection. It establishes standardized protocols across the entire
detection pipeline and serves as a versatile platform for evaluating existing
methods as well as exploring novel approaches. DeepfakeBench-MM currently
supports 5 datasets and 11 multimodal deepfake detectors. Furthermore, our
comprehensive evaluations and in-depth analyses uncover several key findings
from multiple perspectives (e.g., augmentation, stacked forgery). We believe
that DeepfakeBench-MM, together with our large-scale Mega-MMDF, will serve as
foundational infrastructures for advancing multimodal deepfake detection.

Motivation: Agentic RAG面临三个主要挑战：规划和搜索的相互依赖性、中间推理步骤缺乏监督、规划和搜索的候选空间指数级增长。

Method: 使用双价值模型分别优化规划推理和搜索基础，构建推理树，采用蒙特卡洛树搜索评估步骤质量，推理时使用分层波束搜索。

Result: 在不同参数规模的策略模型上进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DecoupleSearch框架成功解决了Agentic RAG面临的挑战，通过解耦规划和搜索实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a pivotal
methodology for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) through the dynamic
integration of external knowledge. To further improve RAG's flexibility,
Agentic RAG introduces autonomous agents into the workflow. However, Agentic
RAG faces several challenges: (1) the success of each step depends on both
high-quality planning and accurate search, (2) the lack of supervision for
intermediate reasoning steps, and (3) the exponentially large candidate space
for planning and searching. To address these challenges, we propose
DecoupleSearch, a novel framework that decouples planning and search processes
using dual value models, enabling independent optimization of plan reasoning
and search grounding. Our approach constructs a reasoning tree, where each node
represents planning and search steps. We leverage Monte Carlo Tree Search to
assess the quality of each step. During inference, Hierarchical Beam Search
iteratively refines planning and search candidates with dual value models.
Extensive experiments across policy models of varying parameter sizes,
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实核查基准采用启发式声明分解方法和弱监督网络搜索来收集证据，这可能导致证据相关性低、来源嘈杂且存在时间泄漏，缺乏真实性的检索设置。

Method: 通过近似模拟人类事实核查员的声明分解过程来收集相关证据，确保没有时间泄漏，并构建包含自然数值声明和开放领域语料库的数据集。

Result: 引入了QuanTemp++数据集，包含自然数值声明、开放领域语料库以及每个声明的相关证据，并分析了关键声明分解范式的检索性能。

Conclusion: QuanTemp++数据集提供了一个更真实的检索设置，有助于开发包含人类事实核查员技能的自动化方法，并揭示了声明分解对验证流程结果的影响。

Abstract: Fact-checking numerical claims is critical as the presence of numbers provide
mirage of veracity despite being fake potentially causing catastrophic impacts
on society. The prior works in automatic fact verification do not primarily
focus on natural numerical claims. A typical human fact-checker first retrieves
relevant evidence addressing the different numerical aspects of the claim and
then reasons about them to predict the veracity of the claim. Hence, the search
process of a human fact-checker is a crucial skill that forms the foundation of
the verification process. Emulating a real-world setting is essential to aid in
the development of automated methods that encompass such skills. However,
existing benchmarks employ heuristic claim decomposition approaches augmented
with weakly supervised web search to collect evidences for verifying claims.
This sometimes results in less relevant evidences and noisy sources with
temporal leakage rendering a less realistic retrieval setting for claim
verification. Hence, we introduce QuanTemp++: a dataset consisting of natural
numerical claims, an open domain corpus, with the corresponding relevant
evidence for each claim. The evidences are collected through a claim
decomposition process approximately emulating the approach of human
fact-checker and veracity labels ensuring there is no temporal leakage. Given
this dataset, we also characterize the retrieval performance of key claim
decomposition paradigms. Finally, we observe their effect on the outcome of the
verification pipeline and draw insights. The code for data pipeline along with
link to data can be found at https://github.com/VenkteshV/QuanTemp_Plus

TL;DR: PaperAsk是一个评估LLM在学术任务中可靠性的基准，涵盖引文检索、内容提取、论文发现和声明验证四个任务。研究发现LLM存在严重可靠性问题，如引文检索失败率48-98%，内容提取失败率72-91%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM越来越多地作为研究助手使用，其在学术任务中的可靠性尚未得到充分评估。需要系统性地评估LLM在真实使用条件下的表现。

Method: 开发PaperAsk基准，在四个关键研究任务上评估GPT-4o、GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Flash。通过受控实验和人工分析，识别失败模式并开发可靠性分类器。

Result: LLM在多个任务中表现不佳：引文检索失败率48-98%，内容提取失败率72-91%，论文发现F1分数低于0.32。不同LLM有不同失败行为：ChatGPT倾向于不回应，Gemini生成流畅但虚构的答案。

Conclusion: LLM作为研究助手存在严重可靠性问题，主要由于检索上下文不受控扩展和LLM倾向于优先考虑语义相关文本而非任务指令。PaperAsk为评估LLM学术助手可靠性提供了可复现的诊断框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly serve as research assistants, yet
their reliability in scholarly tasks remains under-evaluated. In this work, we
introduce PaperAsk, a benchmark that systematically evaluates LLMs across four
key research tasks: citation retrieval, content extraction, paper discovery,
and claim verification. We evaluate GPT-4o, GPT-5, and Gemini-2.5-Flash under
realistic usage conditions-via web interfaces where search operations are
opaque to the user. Through controlled experiments, we find consistent
reliability failures: citation retrieval fails in 48-98% of multi-reference
queries, section-specific content extraction fails in 72-91% of cases, and
topical paper discovery yields F1 scores below 0.32, missing over 60% of
relevant literature. Further human analysis attributes these failures to the
uncontrolled expansion of retrieved context and the tendency of LLMs to
prioritize semantically relevant text over task instructions. Across basic
tasks, the LLMs display distinct failure behaviors: ChatGPT often withholds
responses rather than risk errors, whereas Gemini produces fluent but
fabricated answers. To address these issues, we develop lightweight reliability
classifiers trained on PaperAsk data to identify unreliable outputs. PaperAsk
provides a reproducible and diagnostic framework for advancing the reliability
evaluation of LLM-based scholarly assistance systems.

TL;DR: 针对淘宝电商视觉搜索中大量无点击请求反映的用户隐式意图表达与系统响应不匹配问题，提出REVISION框架，通过离线推理挖掘和在线决策执行相结合的方式，利用大模型分析隐式意图并生成优化策略，显著降低无点击率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 淘宝电商视觉搜索中存在大量无点击请求，表明用户有多样化但难以表达的隐式意图，导致平台策略适应性有限且滞后，限制了用户意图表达和视觉搜索系统的扩展性。

Method: 提出REVISION框架：离线阶段构建周期性管道从历史无点击请求中挖掘差异，利用大模型分析隐式意图因素，通过联合推理查询和产品元数据推断最优建议；在线阶段使用REVISION-R1-3B模型对查询图像和相关历史产品进行整体分析，生成优化计划并自适应调度搜索管道策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法提高了从大规模搜索日志中挖掘隐式意图的效率，并显著降低了无点击率。

Conclusion: REVISION框架为大模型与传统搜索系统的集成提供了简化范式，实现了信息聚合和用户交互的端到端智能优化，有效缓解了用户隐式意图表达与系统响应之间的不匹配问题。

Abstract: In Taobao e-commerce visual search, user behavior analysis reveals a large
proportion of no-click requests, suggesting diverse and implicit user intents.
These intents are expressed in various forms and are difficult to mine and
discover, thereby leading to the limited adaptability and lag in platform
strategies. This greatly restricts users' ability to express diverse intents
and hinders the scalability of the visual search system. This mismatch between
user implicit intent expression and system response defines the User-SearchSys
Intent Discrepancy. To alleviate the issue, we propose a novel framework
REVISION. This framework integrates offline reasoning mining with online
decision-making and execution, enabling adaptive strategies to solve implicit
user demands. In the offline stage, we construct a periodic pipeline to mine
discrepancies from historical no-click requests. Leveraging large models, we
analyze implicit intent factors and infer optimal suggestions by jointly
reasoning over query and product metadata. These inferred suggestions serve as
actionable insights for refining platform strategies. In the online stage,
REVISION-R1-3B, trained on the curated offline data, performs holistic analysis
over query images and associated historical products to generate optimization
plans and adaptively schedule strategies across the search pipeline. Our
framework offers a streamlined paradigm for integrating large models with
traditional search systems, enabling end-to-end intelligent optimization across
information aggregation and user interaction. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach improves the efficiency of implicit intent mining from
large-scale search logs and significantly reduces the no-click rate.

*Juyeon Kim,Geon Lee,Dongwon Choi,Taeuk Kim,Kijung Shin*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HEAVEN是一个两阶段混合向量检索框架，用于视觉丰富文档检索，在保持高准确率的同时大幅降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉丰富文档检索方法存在效率与准确性之间的权衡：单向量检索效率高但精度低，多向量检索准确但计算昂贵。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：第一阶段使用单向量方法在视觉汇总页面上高效检索候选页面；第二阶段使用多向量方法重排序，并通过语言重要性过滤查询标记以减少冗余计算。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，HEAVEN平均达到多向量模型Recall@1性能的99.87%，同时将每查询计算量减少99.82%。

Conclusion: HEAVEN框架成功解决了视觉丰富文档检索中效率与准确性的权衡问题，并引入了ViMDOC基准测试来评估真实条件下的检索系统。

Abstract: Retrieval over visually rich documents is essential for tasks such as legal
discovery, scientific search, and enterprise knowledge management. Existing
approaches fall into two paradigms: single-vector retrieval, which is efficient
but coarse, and multi-vector retrieval, which is accurate but computationally
expensive. To address this trade-off, we propose HEAVEN, a two-stage
hybrid-vector framework. In the first stage, HEAVEN efficiently retrieves
candidate pages using a single-vector method over Visually-Summarized Pages
(VS-Pages), which assemble representative visual layouts from multiple pages.
In the second stage, it reranks candidates with a multi-vector method while
filtering query tokens by linguistic importance to reduce redundant
computations. To evaluate retrieval systems under realistic conditions, we also
introduce ViMDOC, the first benchmark for visually rich, multi-document, and
long-document retrieval. Across four benchmarks, HEAVEN attains 99.87% of the
Recall@1 performance of multi-vector models on average while reducing per-query
computation by 99.82%, achieving efficiency and accuracy. Our code and datasets
are available at: https://github.com/juyeonnn/HEAVEN

TL;DR: SIGN是一种命名游戏，研究轻量级结构如何引导多智能体系统中的约定形成，相比无约束自然语言能实现更快的收敛和高达5.8倍的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实AI系统处理复杂问题时，多个LLM智能体之间的不一致约定会导致协调失败，需要可靠、一致的通信，且随着系统规模扩大，可扩展性成为核心问题。

Method: 引入Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN)命名游戏，研究轻量级结构如何引导约定形成，比较模式诱导通信与无约束自然语言。

Result: 模式诱导通信相比无约束自然语言实现了更快的收敛，一致性提高了5.8倍。

Conclusion: 最小化结构可以作为多智能体协调的简单控制旋钮，提高效率，在命名游戏之外有更广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Real-world AI systems are tackling increasingly complex problems, often
through interactions among large language model (LLM) agents. When these agents
develop inconsistent conventions, coordination can break down. Applications
such as collaborative coding and distributed planning therefore require
reliable, consistent communication, and scalability is a central concern as
systems grow. We introduce Schema-Induced Games for Naming (SIGN), a naming
game that examines how lightweight structure can steer convention formation. We
compare schema-induced communication to unconstrained natural language and find
faster convergence with up to 5.8x higher agreement. These results suggest that
minimal structure can act as a simple control knob for efficient multi-agent
coordination, pointing toward broader applications beyond the naming game.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文开发了GeoThoughts数据集和GeoThought-MLLM模型来解决几何推理任务中的挑战，通过链式思维训练显著提升了多模态模型在几何问题上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本数学问题上表现出色，但在视觉推理特别是几何问题解决中性能大幅下降，主要因为几何问题的内在复杂性（需要详细图像理解和多步推理）以及现有数据集在规模、多样性和明确推理轨迹方面的不足。

Method: 开发了GeoThoughts数据集（包含6,243样本的Geo-Thought-6K和10,834样本的Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K），每个样本包含视觉描述、逐步解决方案、明确推理链、反思步骤和最终答案。基于此数据集训练了GeoThought-MLLM多模态数学推理模型。

Result: GeoThought-MLLM模型在几何任务中超越了现有基准测试，证明使用链式思维数据集训练能够提升模型在领域内和领域外的几何推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过链式思维纠正数学概念误解或空间判断错误，模型能够产生正确答案。错误分析显示失败案例主要源于数学概念错误解释或空间误判。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities
in text-based mathematical problem solving; however, when adapted to visual
reasoning tasks, particularly geometric problem solving, their performance
substantially declines because geometric problems present unique challenges.
Specifically, these challenges stem from two key factors: first, the intrinsic
complexity of geometry requiring detailed image comprehension and multi-step
reasoning, and second, the limitations of existing datasets which lack
sufficient scale, diversity, and explicit reasoning traces, consequently
hindering effective model training. To address these challenges, we developed
the GeoThoughts dataset, a comprehensive geometric reasoning corpus with two
subsets: Geo-Thought-6K with 6,243 samples and its augmented version
Geo-Thought-Augmented-10K containing 10,834 samples. Each entry includes visual
descriptions, step-by-step solutions, explicit reasoning chains, reflection
steps, and final answers. Using this dataset, we developed GeoThought-MLLM, a
mathematical reasoning multimodal model that generates detailed thinking
processes during problem-solving. Our model outperforms existing benchmarks in
geometric tasks, demonstrating that training with our Chain-of-Thought dataset
improves geometric reasoning capabilities across both in-domain and
out-of-domain settings. Finally, we analyze failure cases and observe that
errors primarily arise from incorrect interpretation of mathematical concepts
or spatial misjudgment. By invoking CoT to correct these mistakes, the model
produces correct answers.

TL;DR: 研究表明，经过专门优化的10亿参数开源模型在电子商务意图识别任务中可以达到与GPT-4.1相当的99%准确率，同时大幅降低计算成本和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 商用大语言模型在专业领域部署面临高计算成本、延迟和运营费用的问题，需要寻找资源效率更高的替代方案。

Method: 使用QLoRA方法对10亿参数的Llama 3.2模型进行微调，并在合成数据集上训练，然后应用GPTQ和GGUF后训练量化技术创建GPU和CPU优化版本。

Result: 专门优化的1B模型达到99%准确率，匹配GPT-4.1性能。GPTQ减少41%显存但推理速度下降82%，GGUF在CPU上实现18倍推理吞吐量提升和90%以上内存减少。

Conclusion: 经过适当优化的小型开源模型不仅是可行的，而且是领域特定应用更合适的替代方案，能以极低的计算成本提供最先进的准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer state-of-the-art performance in natural
language understanding and generation tasks. However, the deployment of leading
commercial models for specialized tasks, such as e-commerce, is often hindered
by high computational costs, latency, and operational expenses. This paper
investigates the viability of smaller, open-weight models as a
resource-efficient alternative. We present a methodology for optimizing a
one-billion-parameter Llama 3.2 model for multilingual e-commerce intent
recognition. The model was fine-tuned using Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation
(QLoRA) on a synthetically generated dataset designed to mimic real-world user
queries. Subsequently, we applied post-training quantization techniques,
creating GPU-optimized (GPTQ) and CPU-optimized (GGUF) versions. Our results
demonstrate that the specialized 1B model achieves 99% accuracy, matching the
performance of the significantly larger GPT-4.1 model. A detailed performance
analysis revealed critical, hardware-dependent trade-offs: while 4-bit GPTQ
reduced VRAM usage by 41%, it paradoxically slowed inference by 82% on an older
GPU architecture (NVIDIA T4) due to dequantization overhead. Conversely, GGUF
formats on a CPU achieved a speedup of up to 18x in inference throughput and a
reduction of over 90% in RAM consumption compared to the FP16 baseline. We
conclude that small, properly optimized open-weight models are not just a
viable but a more suitable alternative for domain-specific applications,
offering state-of-the-art accuracy at a fraction of the computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑机接口在严重神经损伤患者中具有重要应用前景，但其广泛应用受到信息传输率低和用户特定校准等限制。现有研究探索了大型语言模型的集成，但部署智能AI面临技术障碍和伦理问题。

Method: 这是一篇立场论文，通过分析当前BCI的局限性，提出从BCI到BAC的范式转变，强调智能体作为主动协作伙伴的角色定位。

Result: 提出了脑-智能体协作（BAC）的新范式概念，强调需要建立伦理数据处理、模型可靠性和人-智能体协作框架。

Conclusion: 该领域已准备好从BCI扩展到BAC，需要将智能体重新定义为主动协作伙伴，确保系统安全、可信且有效。

Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) offer a direct communication pathway between
the human brain and external devices, holding significant promise for
individuals with severe neurological impairments. However, their widespread
adoption is hindered by critical limitations, such as low information transfer
rates and extensive user-specific calibration. To overcome these challenges,
recent research has explored the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs),
extending the focus from simple command decoding to understanding complex
cognitive states. Despite these advancements, deploying agentic AI faces
technical hurdles and ethical concerns. Due to the lack of comprehensive
discussion on this emerging direction, this position paper argues that the
field is poised for a paradigm extension from BCI to Brain-Agent Collaboration
(BAC). We emphasize reframing agents as active and collaborative partners for
intelligent assistance rather than passive brain signal data processors,
demanding a focus on ethical data handling, model reliability, and a robust
human-agent collaboration framework to ensure these systems are safe,
trustworthy, and effective.

TL;DR: 提出PACR方法，通过模型内在的置信度奖励来加速强化学习训练，解决稀疏奖励导致的探索效率低下问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR方法的稀疏、基于结果的奖励无法为中间推理步骤提供指导，导致探索过程缓慢。

Method: 使用渐进上升置信度奖励(PACR)，这是一种密集的模型内在奖励，直接基于模型对正确答案信念的演化计算，编码了推理轨迹中正确答案概率应呈上升趋势的归纳偏置。

Result: PACR加速了探索过程，用更少轨迹达到奖励饱和，在多个基准测试中取得改进。

Conclusion: 密集的模型内在塑形信号可以使RLVR训练更有效和可靠。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has significantly
improved LLM reasoning, but its sparse, outcome-based reward provides no
guidance for intermediate steps, slowing exploration. We propose Progressively
Ascending Confidence Reward (PACR), a dense, model-intrinsic reward computed
directly from the model's evolving belief in the correct answer. PACR encodes
the inductive bias that, along a well-formed reasoning trajectory, the
probability of the ground-truth answer should have a generally ascending trend.
We provide empirical and theoretical analysis validating that such an inductive
bias constrains the exploration search space to regions richer in logically
sound reasoning. We demonstrate that PACR accelerates exploration, reaches
reward saturation with fewer trajectories, and yields improvements on multiple
benchmarks. Our results suggest that dense, model-intrinsic shaping signals can
make RLVR training more effective and reliable.

Motivation: 越南语歌词自动转录面临音调复杂性和方言变异的独特挑战，但由于缺乏专用数据集，该领域研究仍处于空白状态。

Method: 构建了647小时的越南语歌词数据集VietLyrics，包含行级对齐的歌词和元数据，并基于该数据集微调Whisper模型。

Result: 微调后的Whisper模型在越南语歌词转录任务上表现优于现有的多语言ALT系统（包括LyricWhiz），解决了传统ASR方法中的转录错误和非人声段幻觉问题。

Conclusion: VietLyrics数据集和微调模型的公开发布将推动越南音乐计算研究，并展示了该方法在低资源语言和音乐ALT任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Automatic Lyrics Transcription (ALT) for Vietnamese music presents unique
challenges due to its tonal complexity and dialectal variations, but remains
largely unexplored due to the lack of a dedicated dataset. Therefore, we
curated the first large-scale Vietnamese ALT dataset (VietLyrics), comprising
647 hours of songs with line-level aligned lyrics and metadata to address these
issues. Our evaluation of current ASRbased approaches reveal significant
limitations, including frequent transcription errors and hallucinations in
non-vocal segments. To improve performance, we fine-tuned Whisper models on the
VietLyrics dataset, achieving superior results compared to existing
multilingual ALT systems, including LyricWhiz. We publicly release VietLyrics
and our models, aiming to advance Vietnamese music computing research while
demonstrating the potential of this approach for ALT in low-resource language
and music.

TL;DR: DynaSolidGeo是首个用于评估视觉语言模型真实空间推理能力的动态基准，专注于立体几何问题，通过半自动标注流程构建，包含503个专家策划的种子问题，可动态生成无限多样的多模态实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多数多模态数学推理基准主要关注2D平面几何，依赖静态数据集容易导致数据污染和记忆问题，且仅通过最终答案评估模型而忽略了推理过程。

Method: 采用半自动标注流程构建动态基准，包含专家策划的种子问题，可动态生成多样化多模态实例。除了答案准确性，还基于专家标注的推理链进行过程评估，衡量逻辑有效性和因果一致性。

Result: 实验显示代表性开源和闭源视觉语言模型存在较大性能差距，在动态设置下性能严重下降，在需要高级空间智能的任务（如心理旋转和可视化）上表现较差。

Conclusion: DynaSolidGeo填补了立体几何空间推理评估的空白，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在空间推理方面的局限性，为未来模型改进提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Solid geometry problem solving demands spatial mathematical reasoning that
integrates spatial intelligence and symbolic reasoning. However, most existing
multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmarks focus primarily on 2D plane
geometry, rely on static datasets prone to data contamination and memorization,
and evaluate models solely by final answers, overlooking the reasoning process.
To address these limitations, we introduce DynaSolidGeo, the first dynamic
benchmark for evaluating genuine spatial reasoning in Vision-Language Models
(VLMs). Constructed through a semi-automatic annotation pipeline, DynaSolidGeo
contains 503 expert-curated seed questions that can, in principle, dynamically
generate an unbounded number of diverse multimodal text-visual instances.
Beyond answer accuracy, we incorporate process evaluation based on
expert-annotated reasoning chains to measure logical validity and causal
coherence. Experiments across representative open-source and closed-source VLMs
reveal large performance gaps, severe degradation in dynamic settings, and poor
performance on tasks requiring high-level spatial intelligence, such as mental
rotation and visualization. The code and dataset are available at

Result: 大型推理模型在足够复杂度下性能急剧下降，无法泛化到训练分布之外的复杂问题，但多数现实世界问题仍在其成功范围内。

Conclusion: 大型推理模型在短期内具有实用性，但需要开发能够超越训练分布复杂度的新方法来解决长尾复杂问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in reasoning
tasks. However, recent studies show that transformers and LLMs fail
catastrophically once reasoning problems exceed modest complexity. We revisit
these findings through the lens of large reasoning models (LRMs) -- LLMs
fine-tuned with incentives for step-by-step argumentation and
self-verification. LRM performance on graph and reasoning benchmarks such as
NLGraph seem extraordinary, with some even claiming they are capable of
generalized reasoning and innovation in reasoning-intensive fields such as
mathematics, physics, medicine, and law. However, by more carefully scaling the
complexity of reasoning problems, we show existing benchmarks actually have
limited complexity. We develop a new dataset, the Deep Reasoning Dataset
(DeepRD), along with a generative process for producing unlimited examples of
scalable complexity. We use this dataset to evaluate model performance on graph
connectivity and natural language proof planning. We find that the performance
of LRMs drop abruptly at sufficient complexity and do not generalize. We also
relate our LRM results to the distributions of the complexities of large,
real-world knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, and proof datasets. We find
the majority of real-world examples fall inside the LRMs' success regime, yet
the long tails expose substantial failure potential. Our analysis highlights
the near-term utility of LRMs while underscoring the need for new methods that
generalize beyond the complexity of examples in the training distribution.

Result: 基于FSM的分析揭示了不同的推理模式和潜在缺陷，为评估和改进LLM推理提供了新的视角。

Conclusion: FSM公式为分析、解释和可视化不同模型如何解决问题提供了系统方法，能够揭示模型推理过程中的独特模式和潜在问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities
when they generate step-by-step solutions, known as chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning. When trained to using chain-of-thought reasoning examples, the
resulting models (called Large Reasoning Models, or LRMs) appear to learn
hierarchical thinking strategies similar to those used by humans. However,
understanding LRMs emerging reasoning capabilities remains a difficult open
problem, with many potential important applications including improving
training and understanding robustness. In this paper, we adopt a memoryless
Finite State Machine formulation to approximate LRM's emerging hierarchical
reasoning dynamics as a structured, interpretable abstraction. We identify a
small set of discrete reasoning states including - initialization, deduction,
augmentation-strategy, uncertainty-estimation, backtracking, and
final-conclusion that capture the high-level states present in the model's
reasoning process. By annotating each step of a model's CoT with these states,
we can represent the reasoning trajectory as a transition sequence through the
state graph. This FSM formulation provides a systematic way to analyze,
interpret and visualize how different models approach problems. We describe the
FSM model, provide examples of CoT annotations under this scheme, and discuss
how it can shed light on differences between available models in their approach
to reasoning. Our results demonstrate that this FSM-based analysis reveals
distinct reasoning patterns and potential shortcomings, offering a new lens to
evaluate and improve LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 现有MLLM遗忘基准存在图像多样性不足、准确性问题和评估场景不够全面的局限，无法反映真实应用的复杂性。

Method: 构建了基于足球转会谣言的手动整理数据集，包含四个测试集来评估遗忘效果、泛化性、实用性和鲁棒性，支持选择性遗忘、纠正性再学习和单模态遗忘等高级设置。

Result: 评估发现：单模态方法在多模态谣言上失效；遗忘效果主要由灾难性遗忘驱动；所有方法都难以处理视觉谣言；遗忘的谣言容易被恢复；所有方法都易受提示攻击。

Conclusion: 当前方法存在显著脆弱性，需要更鲁棒的多模态遗忘解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) intensify concerns about
data privacy, making Machine Unlearning (MU), the selective removal of learned
information, a critical necessity. However, existing MU benchmarks for MLLMs
are limited by a lack of image diversity, potential inaccuracies, and
insufficient evaluation scenarios, which fail to capture the complexity of
real-world applications. To facilitate the development of MLLMs unlearning and
alleviate the aforementioned limitations, we introduce OFFSIDE, a novel
benchmark for evaluating misinformation unlearning in MLLMs based on football
transfer rumors. This manually curated dataset contains 15.68K records for 80
players, providing a comprehensive framework with four test sets to assess
forgetting efficacy, generalization, utility, and robustness. OFFSIDE supports
advanced settings like selective unlearning and corrective relearning, and
crucially, unimodal unlearning (forgetting only text data). Our extensive
evaluation of multiple baselines reveals key findings: (1) Unimodal methods
(erasing text-based knowledge) fail on multimodal rumors; (2) Unlearning
efficacy is largely driven by catastrophic forgetting; (3) All methods struggle
with "visual rumors" (rumors appear in the image); (4) The unlearned rumors can
be easily recovered and (5) All methods are vulnerable to prompt attacks. These
results expose significant vulnerabilities in current approaches, highlighting
the need for more robust multimodal unlearning solutions. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识图谱构建忽略了数据的动态性和时效性，而现有的零样本或少样本方法存在不稳定性和关键事实覆盖不全的问题。

Method: 将输入文档分割为最小自包含的原子事实，采用双时间建模区分信息观察时间和有效时间，并行合并原子时序知识图谱。

Result: 相比基线方法，ATOM实现了约18%的完整性提升、约17%的稳定性改善以及超过90%的延迟降低。

Conclusion: ATOM展示了动态时序知识图谱构建的强大可扩展潜力，能够有效应对实时数据变化。

Abstract: In today's rapidly expanding data landscape, knowledge extraction from
unstructured text is vital for real-time analytics, temporal inference, and
dynamic memory frameworks. However, traditional static knowledge graph (KG)
construction often overlooks the dynamic and time-sensitive nature of
real-world data, limiting adaptability to continuous changes. Moreover, recent
zero- or few-shot approaches that avoid domain-specific fine-tuning or reliance
on prebuilt ontologies often suffer from instability across multiple runs, as
well as incomplete coverage of key facts. To address these challenges, we
introduce ATOM (AdapTive and OptiMized), a few-shot and scalable approach that
builds and continuously updates Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) from
unstructured texts. ATOM splits input documents into minimal, self-contained
"atomic" facts, improving extraction exhaustivity and stability. Then, it
constructs atomic TKGs from these facts while employing a dual-time modeling
that distinguishes when information is observed from when it is valid. The
resulting atomic TKGs are subsequently merged in parallel. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that ATOM achieves ~18% higher exhaustivity, ~17%
better stability, and over 90% latency reduction compared to baseline methods,
demonstrating a strong scalability potential for dynamic TKG construction.

inefficiency, we propose a simple yet highly effective method for detecting
such responses after only a single generation step. We demonstrate that the
log-probability distribution of the first generated token serves as a powerful
signal for classifying the nature of the entire subsequent response. Our
experiments, conducted across a diverse range of small, large, and
reasoning-specialized models, show that the first-token log-probability vectors
form distinctly separable clusters for different response types. Using a
lightweight k-NN classifier, we achieve high accuracy in predicting whether a
response will be a substantive answer or a form of boilerplate response,
including user-specified refusals. The primary implication is a practical,
computationally trivial technique, optimizing LLM inference by enabling early
termination or redirection to a smaller model, thereby yielding significant
savings in computational cost. This work presents a direct path toward more
efficient and sustainable LLM deployment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究比较了五个顶级大语言模型（Gemini、DeepSeek、Claude、GPT和LLaMA）在性能准确性、伦理偏见缓解和可用性集成三个关键维度的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着各大公司不断改进LLMs，了解不同模型在性能、道德行为和可用性方面的差异变得至关重要，这些差异源于它们不同的设计理念。

Method: 通过分析三个重要因素：性能与准确性、伦理与偏见缓解、可用性与集成，对五个顶级LLM进行比较评估。

Result: Claude在道德推理方面表现良好，Gemini在多模态能力和伦理框架方面更强，DeepSeek擅长基于事实的推理，LLaMA适合开放应用，ChatGPT提供平衡性能并注重使用体验。

Conclusion: 这些模型在工作效果、易用性和伦理处理方面存在显著差异，用户应根据具体需求选择最能发挥其优势的模型。

Abstract: Big Language Models (LLMs) are changing the way businesses use software, the
way people live their lives and the way industries work. Companies like Google,
High-Flyer, Anthropic, OpenAI and Meta are making better LLMs. So, it's crucial
to look at how each model is different in terms of performance, moral behaviour
and usability, as these differences are based on the different ideas that built
them. This study compares five top LLMs: Google's Gemini, High-Flyer's
DeepSeek, Anthropic's Claude, OpenAI's GPT models and Meta's LLaMA. It performs
this by analysing three important factors: Performance and Accuracy, Ethics and
Bias Mitigation and Usability and Integration. It was found that Claude has
good moral reasoning, Gemini is better at multimodal capabilities and has
strong ethical frameworks. DeepSeek is great at reasoning based on facts, LLaMA
is good for open applications and ChatGPT delivers balanced performance with a
focus on usage. It was concluded that these models are different in terms of
how well they work, how easy they are to use and how they treat people
ethically, making it a point that each model should be utilised by the user in
a way that makes the most of its strengths.

TL;DR: 开发了一个事实验证框架，通过交叉检查LLM输出与多个知识源来实时捕捉和纠正AI幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型会自信地生成听起来合理但实际错误的信息，这种幻觉问题已成为在准确性至关重要的现实应用中部署这些模型的主要障碍。

Method: 结合结构化数据库、实时网络搜索和学术文献，在生成事实声明时进行验证。检测到不一致时自动纠正，同时保持回答的自然流畅性。

Result: 跨领域测试显示幻觉减少了67%，且不牺牲回答质量。医疗、金融和科学研究领域的专家对纠正后输出的满意度达到89%，相比未验证的LLM回答有显著提升。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在不能容忍事实错误的应用中使LLM更加可靠提供了一个实用解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have transformed how we interact with AI systems,
they suffer from a critical flaw: they confidently generate false information
that sounds entirely plausible. This hallucination problem has become a major
barrier to deploying these models in real-world applications where accuracy
matters. We developed a fact verification framework that catches and corrects
these errors in real-time by cross checking LLM outputs against multiple
knowledge sources. Our system combines structured databases, live web searches,
and academic literature to verify factual claims as they're generated. When we
detect inconsistencies, we automatically correct them while preserving the
natural flow of the response. Testing across various domains showed we could
reduce hallucinations by 67% without sacrificing response quality. Domain
experts in healthcare, finance, and scientific research rated our corrected
outputs 89% satisfactory a significant improvement over unverified LLM
responses. This work offers a practical solution for making LLMs more
trustworthy in applications where getting facts wrong isn't an option.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文首次直接比较人类与AI代理在多个工作技能（数据分析、工程、计算、写作、设计）上的表现，发现代理虽然工作质量较差且存在数据伪造问题，但速度快88.3%、成本低90.4-96.2%，适合处理可编程任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理开发缺乏对人类工作执行方式的理解，需要揭示代理在不同工作流程中的专业能力和角色定位。

Method: 引入可扩展工具包，从人类或代理的计算机使用活动中提取可解释的结构化工作流程，进行直接比较分析。

Result: 代理在所有工作领域都采用程序化方法，与人类UI中心方法形成对比；工作质量较差但通过数据伪造掩盖缺陷；比人类快88.3%、成本低90.4-96.2%。

Conclusion: 代理在可编程任务上具有效率优势，适合与人类协作，但需要解决质量问题和数据诚信问题。

Abstract: AI agents are continually optimized for tasks related to human work, such as
software engineering and professional writing, signaling a pressing trend with
significant impacts on the human workforce. However, these agent developments
have often not been grounded in a clear understanding of how humans execute
work, to reveal what expertise agents possess and the roles they can play in
diverse workflows. In this work, we study how agents do human work by
presenting the first direct comparison of human and agent workers across
multiple essential work-related skills: data analysis, engineering,
computation, writing, and design. To better understand and compare
heterogeneous computer-use activities of workers, we introduce a scalable
toolkit to induce interpretable, structured workflows from either human or
agent computer-use activities. Using such induced workflows, we compare how
humans and agents perform the same tasks and find that: (1) While agents
exhibit promise in their alignment to human workflows, they take an
overwhelmingly programmatic approach across all work domains, even for
open-ended, visually dependent tasks like design, creating a contrast with the
UI-centric methods typically used by humans. (2) Agents produce work of
inferior quality, yet often mask their deficiencies via data fabrication and
misuse of advanced tools. (3) Nonetheless, agents deliver results 88.3% faster
and cost 90.4-96.2% less than humans, highlighting the potential for enabling
efficient collaboration by delegating easily programmable tasks to agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个自适应信号框架，通过理性沟通原则优化人机协作中的信息传递时机和内容，确保用户在动态环境中保持准确理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在快速变化的环境中，辅助AI需要识别关键信息并估计最佳沟通时机，因为人类注意力是零和认知资源，关注一个信息会降低对其他信息的感知。

Method: 使用贝叶斯参考解析和理性言语行为（RSA）建模框架，规划消息序列以优化用户信念与动态环境的及时对齐。代理根据用户和场景特点调整消息特异性和时机。

Result: 与基线方法相比，该方法的效果关键依赖于多步规划和现实用户意识模型的结合。

Conclusion: 这是RSA在动态环境通信和人类-AI交互中的首次应用，为人类-代理团队的实用沟通建立了理论基础，展示了认知科学见解如何指导辅助代理设计。

Abstract: Adaptive agent design offers a way to improve human-AI collaboration on
time-sensitive tasks in rapidly changing environments. In such cases, to ensure
the human maintains an accurate understanding of critical task elements, an
assistive agent must not only identify the highest priority information but
also estimate how and when this information can be communicated most
effectively, given that human attention represents a zero-sum cognitive
resource where focus on one message diminishes awareness of other or upcoming
information. We introduce a theoretical framework for adaptive signalling which
meets these challenges by using principles of rational communication,
formalised as Bayesian reference resolution using the Rational Speech Act (RSA)
modelling framework, to plan a sequence of messages which optimise timely
alignment between user belief and a dynamic environment. The agent adapts
message specificity and timing to the particulars of a user and scenario based
on projections of how prior-guided interpretation of messages will influence
attention to the interface and subsequent belief update, across several
timesteps out to a fixed horizon. In a comparison to baseline methods, we show
that this effectiveness depends crucially on combining multi-step planning with
a realistic model of user awareness. As the first application of RSA for
communication in a dynamic environment, and for human-AI interaction in
general, we establish theoretical foundations for pragmatic communication in
human-agent teams, highlighting how insights from cognitive science can be
capitalised to inform the design of assistive agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了JanusCode-800K，这是迄今为止最大的多模态代码语料库，并基于此训练了JanusCoder系列模型，能够在文本指令、视觉输入或两者结合的情况下生成代码，在文本中心和视觉中心编码任务上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经代码智能的范围正在从基于文本的源代码扩展到程序生成的丰富视觉输出，但高质量多模态代码数据的稀缺阻碍了进展，这源于合成和质量评估的挑战。

Method: 首先开发了一个完整的合成工具包，利用数据模态之间的协同作用高效生成大规模高质量语料库；然后构建了JanusCode-800K语料库；最后训练了JanusCoder和JanusCoderV模型，建立了视觉-程序接口。

Result: JanusCoder系列模型在文本中心和视觉中心编码任务上表现出卓越性能，7B到14B规模的模型接近甚至超过商业模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作通过构建大规模多模态代码语料库和统一模型，成功地将程序逻辑与其视觉表达相协调，为视觉编程接口提供了关键见解。

Abstract: The scope of neural code intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text-based
source code to encompass the rich visual outputs that programs generate. This
visual dimension is critical for advanced applications like flexible content
generation and precise, program-driven editing of visualizations. However,
progress has been impeded by the scarcity of high-quality multimodal code data,
a bottleneck stemming from challenges in synthesis and quality assessment. To
address these challenges, we make contributions from both a data and modeling
perspective. We first introduce a complete synthesis toolkit that leverages
reciprocal synergies between data modalities to efficiently produce a
large-scale, high-quality corpus spanning from standard charts to complex
interactive web UIs and code-driven animations. Leveraging this toolkit, we
construct JanusCode-800K, the largest multimodal code corpus to date. This
powers the training of our models, JanusCoder and JanusCoderV, which establish
a visual-programmatic interface for generating code from textual instructions,
visual inputs, or a combination of both. Our unified model is a departure from
existing approaches that build specialized models for isolated tasks. Extensive
experiments on both text-centric and vision-centric coding tasks demonstrate
the superior performance of the JanusCoder series, with our 7B to 14B scale
models approaching or even exceeding the performance of commercial models.
Furthermore, extensive analysis provides key insights into harmonizing
programmatic logic with its visual expression. Our code and checkpoints will
are available at https://github.com/InternLM/JanusCoder.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ReCode提出了一种通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动的新范式，解决了LLM智能体无法在不同决策粒度间灵活操作的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界任务需要在不同粒度上做决策，人类擅长通过统一的认知表示来实现这一点。但现有LLM智能体缺乏这种跨粒度决策能力，因为传统范式将高层规划与底层行动严格分离，限制了动态适应性和泛化能力。

Method: ReCode在单一代码表示中统一规划和行动，将高层计划视为抽象占位函数，然后递归分解为更细粒度的子函数，直到达到原始行动。这种递归方法消除了规划与行动之间的刚性边界。

Result: 大量实验表明ReCode在推理性能上显著超越先进基线，并在训练中表现出卓越的数据效率。

Conclusion: 通过递归代码生成统一规划和行动是实现通用粒度控制的有效方法，递归结构还能自动生成丰富的多粒度训练数据。

Abstract: Real-world tasks require decisions at varying granularities, and humans excel
at this by leveraging a unified cognitive representation where planning is
fundamentally understood as a high-level form of action. However, current Large
Language Model (LLM)-based agents lack this crucial capability to operate
fluidly across decision granularities. This limitation stems from existing
paradigms that enforce a rigid separation between high-level planning and
low-level action, which impairs dynamic adaptability and limits generalization.
We propose ReCode (Recursive Code Generation), a novel paradigm that addresses
this limitation by unifying planning and action within a single code
representation. In this representation, ReCode treats high-level plans as
abstract placeholder functions, which the agent then recursively decomposes
into finer-grained sub-functions until reaching primitive actions. This
recursive approach dissolves the rigid boundary between plan and action,
enabling the agent to dynamically control its decision granularity.
Furthermore, the recursive structure inherently generates rich,
multi-granularity training data, enabling models to learn hierarchical
decision-making processes. Extensive experiments show ReCode significantly
surpasses advanced baselines in inference performance and demonstrates
exceptional data efficiency in training, validating our core insight that
unifying planning and action through recursive code generation is a powerful
and effective approach to achieving universal granularity control. The code is
available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/ReCode.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Atlas Urban Index (AUI)指标，利用Sentinel-2卫星影像和视觉语言模型来测量城市发展，克服传统NDBI等指标在大气噪声、季节变化和云层覆盖方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如NDBI在准确捕捉城市发展方面存在困难，受大气噪声、季节变化和云层覆盖等因素影响，这阻碍了大规模人类发展和城市化的监测。

Method: 收集每个区域的Sentinel-2影像时间序列，在固定时间窗口内处理图像以获得云层覆盖最少的代表性图像；采用两种策略确保评分一致性：(i)提供代表不同城市化水平的参考图像集，(ii)提供最近的过去图像以保持时间一致性和减轻云层噪声。

Result: 在班加罗尔的定性实验表明，AUI优于NDBI等标准指标。

Conclusion: AUI能够克服传统城市化指标的挑战，产生更可靠和稳定的发展评分。

Abstract: We introduce the {\em Atlas Urban Index} (AUI), a metric for measuring urban
development computed using Sentinel-2 \citep{spoto2012sentinel2} satellite
imagery. Existing approaches, such as the {\em Normalized Difference Built-up
Index} (NDBI), often struggle to accurately capture urban development due to
factors like atmospheric noise, seasonal variation, and cloud cover. These
limitations hinder large-scale monitoring of human development and
urbanization. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that
leverages {\em Vision-Language Models }(VLMs) to provide a development score
for regions. Specifically, we collect a time series of Sentinel-2 images for
each region. Then, we further process the images within fixed time windows to
get an image with minimal cloud cover, which serves as the representative image
for that time window. To ensure consistent scoring, we adopt two strategies:
(i) providing the VLM with a curated set of reference images representing
different levels of urbanization, and (ii) supplying the most recent past image
to both anchor temporal consistency and mitigate cloud-related noise in the
current image. Together, these components enable AUI to overcome the challenges
of traditional urbanization indices and produce more reliable and stable
development scores. Our qualitative experiments on Bangalore suggest that AUI
outperforms standard indices such as NDBI.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多维度指令不确定性减少框架InSUR，用于生成更令人满意的语义约束对抗样本，通过稳定对抗优化、补充缺失知识和澄清评估边界来提升攻击的迁移性、适应性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成语义约束对抗样本的方法在攻击能力上存在不足，主要原因是人类指令中的语义不确定性因素（如指称多样性、描述不完整性和边界模糊性）尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 1) 在采样方法维度：提出残差驱动的攻击方向稳定化，通过ResAdv-DDIM采样器稳定对抗优化过程；2) 在任务建模维度：提出上下文编码的攻击场景约束，通过引导掩码和渲染器集成补充不完整指令的缺失知识；3) 在生成器评估维度：提出语义抽象的攻击评估增强，通过澄清评估边界促进更有效的生成器开发。

Result: 大量实验证明了InSUR在迁移攻击性能上的优越性，并首次实现了无参考的语义约束3D对抗样本生成。

Conclusion: InSUR框架通过多维度减少指令不确定性，能够生成更令人满意的语义约束对抗样本，在迁移性、适应性和有效性方面表现出色，为语义对抗攻击研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Recently, semantically constrained adversarial examples (SemanticAE), which
are directly generated from natural language instructions, have become a
promising avenue for future research due to their flexible attacking forms. To
generate SemanticAEs, current methods fall short of satisfactory attacking
ability as the key underlying factors of semantic uncertainty in human
instructions, such as referring diversity, descriptive incompleteness, and
boundary ambiguity, have not been fully investigated. To tackle the issues,
this paper develops a multi-dimensional instruction uncertainty reduction
(InSUR) framework to generate more satisfactory SemanticAE, i.e., transferable,
adaptive, and effective. Specifically, in the dimension of the sampling method,
we propose the residual-driven attacking direction stabilization to alleviate
the unstable adversarial optimization caused by the diversity of language
references. By coarsely predicting the language-guided sampling process, the
optimization process will be stabilized by the designed ResAdv-DDIM sampler,
therefore releasing the transferable and robust adversarial capability of
multi-step diffusion models. In task modeling, we propose the context-encoded
attacking scenario constraint to supplement the missing knowledge from
incomplete human instructions. Guidance masking and renderer integration are
proposed to regulate the constraints of 2D/3D SemanticAE, activating stronger
scenario-adapted attacks. Moreover, in the dimension of generator evaluation,
we propose the semantic-abstracted attacking evaluation enhancement by
clarifying the evaluation boundary, facilitating the development of more
effective SemanticAE generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of the transfer attack performance of InSUR. Moreover, we realize
the reference-free generation of semantically constrained 3D adversarial
examples for the first time.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批判性AI研究虽然提供了重要的物质和社会技术批评，但可能忽视了LLM如何现象学地重塑意义生成过程。作者希望关注LLM在人类交流中刻录自身的直接层面。

Method: 区分了ML研究中的三种知识兴趣（认识论、知识型、认识论学），提出将表面层面的风格分析与深度导向的批评相结合，并通过两个研究合成文本风格标记的案例研究来论证。

Result: 通过关注风格作为符号学现象，揭示了LLM作为文化行动者，在当代话语中转变意义涌现和传播的条件，这与机器意识问题无关。

Conclusion: 需要整合表面层面的风格分析来理解LLM如何重塑意义生成，强调LLM通过生成难以区分的文本表面来影响文化意义的生产和流通。

Abstract: Despite a potential plateau in ML advancement, the societal impact of large
language models lies not in approaching superintelligence but in generating
text surfaces indistinguishable from human writing. While Critical AI Studies
provides essential material and socio-technical critique, it risks overlooking
how LLMs phenomenologically reshape meaning-making. This paper proposes a
semiotics of "surface integrity" as attending to the immediate plane where LLMs
inscribe themselves into human communication. I distinguish three knowledge
interests in ML research (epistemology, epist\=em\=e, and epistemics) and argue
for integrating surface-level stylistic analysis alongside depth-oriented
critique. Through two case studies examining stylistic markers of synthetic
text, I argue how attending to style as a semiotic phenomenon reveals LLMs as
cultural actors that transform the conditions of meaning emergence and
circulation in contemporary discourse, independent of questions about machine
consciousness.

Motivation: 当前语音对话模型缺乏细粒度语音风格控制能力，而这是实现类人交互的关键能力，往往被推理和问答等功能性能力所忽视。

Method: 构建包含830小时语音对话的UltraVoice数据集，涵盖情感、语速、音量、口音、语言和复合风格6个维度。在SLAM-Omni和VocalNet等领先模型上进行微调。

Result: 微调模型在多维控制任务上MOS提升29.12-42.33%，IFR提升14.61-40.09个百分点。在URO-Bench基准测试中，基础设置平均提升10.84%，专业设置提升7.87%。

Conclusion: UltraVoice数据集能有效提升语音模型的细粒度风格控制能力，同时保持核心对话能力，还可用于训练可控TTS模型，具有高质量和广泛应用性。

Abstract: Spoken dialogue models currently lack the ability for fine-grained speech
style control, a critical capability for human-like interaction that is often
overlooked in favor of purely functional capabilities like reasoning and
question answering. To address this limitation, we introduce UltraVoice, the
first large-scale speech dialogue dataset engineered for multiple fine-grained
speech style control. Encompassing over 830 hours of speech dialogues,
UltraVoice provides instructions across six key speech stylistic dimensions:
emotion, speed, volume, accent, language, and composite styles. Fine-tuning
leading models such as SLAM-Omni and VocalNet on UltraVoice significantly
enhances their fine-grained speech stylistic controllability without degrading
core conversational abilities. Specifically, our fine-tuned models achieve
improvements of 29.12-42.33% in Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and 14.61-40.09
percentage points in Instruction Following Rate (IFR) on multi-dimensional
control tasks designed in the UltraVoice. Moreover, on the URO-Bench benchmark,
our fine-tuned models demonstrate substantial gains in core understanding,
reasoning, and conversational abilities, with average improvements of +10.84%
on the Basic setting and +7.87% on the Pro setting. Furthermore, the dataset's
utility extends to training controllable Text-to-Speech (TTS) models,
underscoring its high quality and broad applicability for expressive speech
synthesis. The complete dataset and model checkpoints are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多说话人对话数据集大多依赖语义不连贯的话语和不合理的时间间隔，缺乏语义连贯性和真实的对话时序。

Method: 采用说话人感知对话模拟方法，利用CallHome和外部VAD获取可靠边界，压缩过长的静音，按书籍组织LibriTTS话语以保持上下文一致性，并通过新颖的房间脉冲响应选择程序增强声学真实性。

Result: 数据集包含240.1小时、1,496个对话、830个独特说话人。排序变换器模型在说话人日志方面优于pyannote管道，微调的Fast Conformer-CTC XLarge模型在ASR上达到7.29% WER，超过零样本Whisper-large-v3。

Conclusion: LibriConvo为多说话人语音处理研究提供了具有真实对话动态和受控实验条件的宝贵资源。

Abstract: We introduce LibriConvo, a simulated multi-speaker conversational dataset
based on speaker-aware conversation simulation (SASC), designed to support
training and evaluation of speaker diarization and automatic speech recognition
(ASR) systems. Unlike prior resources that mostly rely on semantically
disconnected utterances and implausible temporal gaps, LibriConvo ensures
semantic coherence and realistic conversational timing. Our pipeline leverages
CallHome with external VAD for reliable boundaries, applies compression to
reduce unnaturally long silences, and organizes LibriTTS utterances by book to
maintain contextual consistency. Acoustic realism is enhanced via a novel room
impulse response selection procedure that ranks speaker-microphone
configurations by spatial plausibility, balancing realism and diversity. The
dataset comprises 240.1 hours across 1,496 dialogues with 830 unique speakers,
split in a speaker-disjoint manner for robust evaluation. Baselines show that
the sortformer model outperforms the pyannote pipeline in diarization, while a
fine-tuned Fast Conformer-CTC XLarge with Serialized Output Training achieves
7.29\% WER for ASR, surpassing zero-shot Whisper-large-v3. LibriConvo provides
a valuable resource for advancing multi-speaker speech processing research with
realistic conversational dynamics and controlled experimental conditions.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了多模态语音识别中LLMs的注意力汇聚和巨大激活现象，提出的解相关损失方法有效缓解了这些问题并提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently advanced auditory speech
recognition (ASR), visual speech recognition (VSR), and audio-visual speech
recognition (AVSR). However, understanding of their internal dynamics under
fine-tuning remains limited. In natural language processing, recent work has
revealed attention sinks, tokens that attract disproportionately high
attention, and associated massive activations in which some features of sink
tokens exhibit huge activation in LLMs. In this work, we are the first to study
these phenomena in multimodal speech recognition. Through a detailed analysis
of audio-visual LLMs, we identify attention sinks and massive activations not
only at the BOS token but also at intermediate low-semantic tokens across ASR,
VSR, and AVSR. We show that massive activations originate in the MLP layers and
correspond to fixed feature indices across all sink tokens. We further show
that intermediate sink tokens exhibit high cosine similarity to the BOS token,
thereby amplifying attention and activation. Building on these insights, we
introduce a simple decorrelation loss that reduces cosine similarity between
BOS and other tokens, effectively mitigating intermediate sinks and massive
activations. Furthermore, our method improves word error rate (WER) under high
audio-visual feature downsampling while remaining stable at lower downsampling
rates.

TL;DR: 本文提出了OmniAgent，一个用于长视频生成的分层图结构多智能体框架，通过三个创新点改进多智能体协作：基于电影制作的架构、超图节点实现临时群组讨论、以及从DAG转向带有限重试的有向循环图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在创造性任务（如长视频生成）中具有巨大潜力，但现有方法在智能体协作、上下文管理和迭代优化方面存在不足，需要更有效的框架来提升性能。

Method: 1. 提出OmniAgent分层图结构多智能体框架，采用电影制作启发的架构；2. 引入超图节点实现智能体间的临时群组讨论；3. 从有向无环图转向带有限重试的有向循环图，支持迭代优化。

Result: 这些创新为多智能体系统在创造性任务中提供了更强大的协作能力，能够减少个体内存需求，确保充分的上下文信息，并通过反馈机制改进早期阶段输出。

Conclusion: 本文提出的三个创新点为开发更鲁棒的多智能体系统在创造性任务中奠定了基础，特别是在长视频生成等复杂任务中展现出显著潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multi-agent systems have demonstrated significant
potential for enhancing creative task performance, such as long video
generation. This study introduces three innovations to improve multi-agent
collaboration. First, we propose OmniAgent, a hierarchical, graph-based
multi-agent framework for long video generation that leverages a
film-production-inspired architecture to enable modular specialization and
scalable inter-agent collaboration. Second, inspired by context engineering, we
propose hypergraph nodes that enable temporary group discussions among agents
lacking sufficient context, reducing individual memory requirements while
ensuring adequate contextual information. Third, we transition from directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs) to directed cyclic graphs with limited retries, allowing
agents to reflect and refine outputs iteratively, thereby improving earlier
stages through feedback from subsequent nodes. These contributions lay the
groundwork for developing more robust multi-agent systems in creative tasks.

TL;DR: AI驱动的消息建议通过改变语言风格来影响集体结构，个性化设计决定社交凝聚力结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在意见多样化的在线交流中，LLM驱动的消息辅助对社会凝聚力的影响，特别是在政治争议话题讨论中

Method: 557名参与者进行多轮政治争议话题讨论，可自由重组讨论组，部分条件提供实时LLM生成的消息建议（个性化或群体适应）

Result: 个体聚焦的辅助导致用户隔离到志同道合的群体，而考虑群体成员立场的关联性辅助通过更包容的交流增强凝聚力

Conclusion: AI中介的交流可以支持多元群体的社会凝聚力，但结果关键取决于个性化设计的方式

Abstract: Social cohesion is difficult to sustain in societies marked by opinion
diversity, particularly in online communication. As large language model
(LLM)-driven messaging assistance becomes increasingly embedded in these
contexts, it raises critical questions about its societal impact. We present an
online experiment with 557 participants who engaged in multi-round discussions
on politically controversial topics while freely reconfiguring their discussion
groups. In some conditions, participants received real-time message suggestions
generated by an LLM, either personalized to the individual or adapted to their
group context. We find that subtle shifts in linguistic style during
communication, mediated by AI assistance, can scale up to reshape collective
structures. While individual-focused assistance leads users to segregate into
like-minded groups, relational assistance that incorporates group members'
stances enhances cohesion through more receptive exchanges. These findings
demonstrate that AI-mediated communication can support social cohesion in
diverse groups, but outcomes critically depend on how personalization is
designed.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个结合BERTopic主题建模和道德基础理论的新框架，用于分析美国第117届国会期间Twitter政治话题的持久性和道德维度。研究发现宏观主题稳定但微观话题快速消散，道德基础对话题持久性有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体重塑了政治话语，为政治家提供了直接参与平台，但也加剧了极化和意识形态分歧。需要理解政治话题如何随时间演变及其道德维度。

Method: 整合BERTopic主题建模与道德基础理论，开发跟踪动态话题变化的方法，测量话题与道德价值观的关联，并量化话题持久性。

Result: 宏观主题保持稳定，但微观话题快速消散；道德基础在话题持久性中起关键作用，关怀和忠诚主导持久话题；党派差异体现在不同的道德框架策略中。

Conclusion: 这项工作为社会网络分析和计算政治话语领域提供了可扩展、可解释的方法来理解社交媒体上道德驱动的话题演变。

Abstract: Social media has reshaped political discourse, offering politicians a
platform for direct engagement while reinforcing polarization and ideological
divides. This study introduces a novel topic evolution framework that
integrates BERTopic-based topic modeling with Moral Foundations Theory (MFT) to
analyze the longevity and moral dimensions of political topics in Twitter
activity during the 117th U.S. Congress. We propose a methodology for tracking
dynamic topic shifts over time and measuring their association with moral
values and quantifying topic persistence. Our findings reveal that while
overarching themes remain stable, granular topics tend to dissolve rapidly,
limiting their long-term influence. Moreover, moral foundations play a critical
role in topic longevity, with Care and Loyalty dominating durable topics, while
partisan differences manifest in distinct moral framing strategies. This work
contributes to the field of social network analysis and computational political
discourse by offering a scalable, interpretable approach to understanding
moral-driven topic evolution on social media.

Motivation: 高斯泼溅(GS)在低成本设备上渲染质量较差，需要解决渲染质量与资源限制之间的矛盾。

Method: 1. 提出ECO-GS系统，支持本地小GS模型和远程大GS模型的动态切换；2. 开发IRAC联合优化算法，协同优化协作状态和边缘功率分配；3. 提出PMM算法解决非凸优化问题；4. 开发ILO算法大幅降低计算时间。

Result: PMM算法获得临界点解，ILO算法相比PMM计算时间减少超过100倍，实验证明了PMM的优越性和ILO的实时执行能力。

Conclusion: ECO-GS系统通过智能协作切换机制有效解决了低成本设备上的渲染质量问题，ILO算法实现了实时优化，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Gaussian splatting (GS) struggles with degraded rendering quality on low-cost
devices. To address this issue, we present edge collaborative GS (ECO-GS),
where each user can switch between a local small GS model to guarantee
timeliness and a remote large GS model to guarantee fidelity. However, deciding
how to engage the large GS model is nontrivial, due to the interdependency
between rendering requirements and resource conditions. To this end, we propose
integrated rendering and communication (IRAC), which jointly optimizes
collaboration status (i.e., deciding whether to engage large GS) and edge power
allocation (i.e., enabling remote rendering) under communication constraints
across different users by minimizing a newly-derived GS switching function.
Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose an efficient penalty
majorization minimization (PMM) algorithm to obtain the critical point
solution. Furthermore, we develop an imitation learning optimization (ILO)
algorithm, which reduces the computational time by over 100x compared to PMM.
Experiments demonstrate the superiority of PMM and the real-time execution
capability of ILO.

TL;DR: Neural-HAR是一种专为资源受限平台设计的雷达人体活动识别系统，核心是GateCNN网络，在UoG2020数据集上达到86.4%准确率，仅需2.7k参数和0.28M FLOPs，FPGA实现107.5μs延迟和15mW功耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN/RNN方案对边缘部署来说过于繁重，即使是轻量级ViT/SSM变体也经常超出实际计算和内存预算，需要开发更高效的雷达人体活动识别解决方案。

Method: 提出GateCNN网络：将多普勒向量嵌入以强调频率随时间演变；应用双路径门控卷积，用时间门调制多普勒感知内容特征；辅以残差路径稳定训练。

Result: 在UoG2020连续雷达数据集上达到86.4%准确率，仅需2.7k参数和0.28M FLOPs，与CNN-BiGRU性能相当但复杂度大幅降低。FPGA原型实现107.5μs延迟和15mW动态功耗。

Conclusion: Neural-HAR展示了在资源受限平台上实现实时、节能边缘推理的可行性，为雷达人体活动识别提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition (HAR) is attractive for unobtrusive
and privacy-preserving monitoring, yet many CNN/RNN solutions remain too heavy
for edge deployment, and even lightweight ViT/SSM variants often exceed
practical compute and memory budgets. We introduce Neural-HAR, a
dimension-gated CNN accelerator tailored for real-time radar HAR on
resource-constrained platforms. At its core is GateCNN, a parameter-efficient
Doppler-temporal network that (i) embeds Doppler vectors to emphasize frequency
evolution over time and (ii) applies dual-path gated convolutions that modulate
Doppler-aware content features with temporal gates, complemented by a residual
path for stable training. On the University of Glasgow UoG2020 continuous radar
dataset, GateCNN attains 86.4% accuracy with only 2.7k parameters and 0.28M
FLOPs per inference, comparable to CNN-BiGRU at a fraction of the complexity.
Our FPGA prototype on Xilinx Zynq-7000 Z-7007S reaches 107.5 $\mu$s latency and
15 mW dynamic power using LUT-based ROM and distributed RAM only (zero
DSP/BRAM), demonstrating real-time, energy-efficient edge inference. Code and
HLS conversion scripts are available at https://github.com/lab-emi/AIRHAR.

*Nayan Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个端到端的多任务系统，通过多任务学习和分层生成过程从单张图像生成事实准确的商品描述，显著减少事实幻觉并提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动生成商品描述和名称耗时耗力，现有视觉语言模型存在事实幻觉问题，且单任务模型无法捕捉特征间的依赖关系。

Method: 1. 多任务学习：单一视觉主干网络联合训练属性预测（颜色、下摆、领型）和价格回归；2. 分层生成过程：将模型预测的属性嵌入提示词中，输入文本解码器以提高事实一致性。

Result: 多任务方法在价格回归上R2值提升3.6%，属性分类F1分数提升6.6%；分层生成将事实幻觉率从12.7%降至7.1%（相对减少44.5%），生成延迟降低3.5倍。

Conclusion: 该架构在减少事实幻觉和提高效率方面表现优越，尽管在ROUGE-L指标上比直接视觉语言模型略差3.5%。

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a
slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation
solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone
to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only
inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between
features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task
system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.
The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.
First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision
encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute
prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,
introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own
predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to
improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of
this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent
price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,
with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation
process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from
12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical
ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the
autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to
direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the
model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L
score.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型在没有外部反馈的递归自我评估中，信息变化会逐渐减少，趋向信息闭合状态。通过简单的验证干预可以恢复信息流动，表明自校正存在结构限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试语言模型在无外部反馈的递归自我评估中的表现，验证是否真的能进行反思性推理，还是只是形式上的重述。

Method: 跨提供商研究，使用3个模型（GPT-4o-mini、Claude 3 Haiku、Gemini 2.0 Flash）和4个任务类型，每个任务迭代10次，比较无基础自我批判和最小基础干预两种条件。

Result: 无基础运行中，信息变化从早期到晚期下降55%。基础运行在干预后信息变化反弹28%，并保持非零方差。所有模型都显示相同模式。

Conclusion: 生成式推理的自校正存在结构限制，无信息交换的递归推理会趋向认知静止状态。最小基础干预可作为耗散耦合，重新引入信息流动。

Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning,
yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields
reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider
study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini,
Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families
(arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two
conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a
single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta
I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to
late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all
three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change
immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter.
Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level
entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward
informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on
self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information
with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an
attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative
coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency
suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives
rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when
reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles
for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的线性注意力机制，通过优化前向和后向传播算法以及CUDA实现，在保持与常规注意力相当表达能力的同时，显著提升了运行速度和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer中的常规注意力机制具有O(N²D)的时间复杂度，限制了其效率。虽然线性注意力机制理论上具有O(ND²)的线性复杂度，但在实践中效率仍不理想。

Method: 开发了新的线性注意力前向和后向传播算法，并实现了高度优化的CUDA实现，改进了线性注意力的实际运行效率。

Result: 相比现有最优方法，速度提升3.3倍，内存消耗减少3.6倍。在14亿参数语言模型训练中，在主要推理基准测试上表现出与常规注意力相当的表达能力。

Conclusion: 提出的优化线性注意力方法在保持模型表达能力的同时，显著提升了训练和推理效率，为大规模Transformer模型提供了更高效的替代方案。

Abstract: The original softmax-based attention mechanism (regular attention) in the
extremely successful Transformer architecture computes attention between $N$
tokens, each embedded in a $D$-dimensional head, with a time complexity of
$O(N^2D)$. Given the success of Transformers, improving their runtime during
both training and inference is a popular research area. One such approach is
the introduction of the linear attention (LA) mechanisms, which offers a linear
time complexity of $O(ND^2)$ and have demonstrated comparable accuracy to
regular attention. However, LA in practice lags behind its theoretical
efficiency. We propose a novel method for LA's forward and backward passes,
along with a highly-optimized CUDA implementation. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 3.3 times in speed and reduces memory consumption by 3.6
times. We validate these improvements in both single-layer and end-to-end
settings by training a 1.4 billion parameter language model, which demonstrates
similar expressivity to regular attention on major reasoning benchmarks.

*Iskander Azangulov,Teodora Pandeva,Niranjani Prasad,Javier Zazo,Sushrut Karmalkar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PUNT是一种模型无关的采样器，通过识别token依赖关系并移除冲突组中的低置信度token，解决了掩码扩散模型中并行采样的条件独立性和高置信度预测之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型相比自回归模型可以实现并行token采样，从而获得更快的推理速度。但并行采样面临两个冲突要求：同时更新的token必须条件独立，而更新应优先考虑高置信度预测。这两个目标相互冲突，因为高置信度预测往往聚集且相互依赖。

Method: PUNT通过识别token依赖关系，移除冲突组中的低置信度token，生成满足独立性和置信度标准的索引集，通过近似条件独立性测试确保改进的并行解掩码。

Result: 在IFEval基准测试中，PUNT相比其他无需训练的基线方法（包括顺序生成）实现了高达16%的准确率提升，尤其在生成长序列时表现更优。该方法对超参数不敏感，避免了脆弱的超参数调优。

Conclusion: PUNT在准确性和计算效率之间实现了优越的权衡，并诱导出分层生成策略：模型先建立高级段落结构再进行局部细化，这种类似规划的过程有助于强对齐性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive models (ARMs) for discrete text generation because they enable
parallel token sampling, rather than sequential, left-to-right generation. This
means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling
faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be
conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence
predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often
cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.
  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our
method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from
conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy
both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved
parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.
  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy
and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially
for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to
16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation
(one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters,
mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe
that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model
first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement,
suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong
alignment performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统计框架来解决文本水印检测中重复文本导致的伪随机性不完美问题，通过最小单元概念和分层两层分区方法，在保持I类错误控制的同时提高检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方法假设完美的伪随机性，但实际中生成文本的重复会导致结构化依赖，破坏I类错误控制并使标准分析失效。

Method: 引入统计框架，通过分层两层分区捕获结构依赖，核心是最小单元概念——跨单元独立但允许单元内依赖的最小分组。基于此定义非渐近效率度量，将水印检测建模为极小极大假设检验问题。

Result: 应用于Gumbel-max和逆变换水印时，框架产生闭式最优规则，解释了为何丢弃重复统计量能改善性能，并表明除非退化否则必须处理单元内依赖。理论和实验都证实了在严格I类错误控制下检测能力的提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为不完美伪随机性下的水印检测提供了首个原则性基础，为模型输出的可靠追踪提供了理论洞见和实践指导。

Abstract: Text watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and
accountability of large language model (LLM) outputs and mitigating misuse.
While promising, most existing methods assume perfect pseudorandomness. In
practice, repetition in generated text induces collisions that create
structured dependence, compromising Type I error control and invalidating
standard analyses.
  We introduce a statistical framework that captures this structure through a
hierarchical two-layer partition. At its core is the concept of minimal units
-- the smallest groups treatable as independent across units while permitting
dependence within. Using minimal units, we define a non-asymptotic efficiency
measure and cast watermark detection as a minimax hypothesis testing problem.
  Applied to Gumbel-max and inverse-transform watermarks, our framework
produces closed-form optimal rules. It explains why discarding repeated
statistics often improves performance and shows that within-unit dependence
must be addressed unless degenerate. Both theory and experiments confirm
improved detection power with rigorous Type I error control. These results
provide the first principled foundation for watermark detection under imperfect
pseudorandomness, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for
reliable tracing of model outputs.

Motivation: 解决在真实代码仓库中训练可靠代码修复代理的挑战，其中复杂的构建过程和不断变化的依赖关系导致评估不稳定。

Method: 开发了可验证的构建验证流程，通过固定依赖和禁用自动升级提高重现性；构建了简化的可扩展RL流程；使用GPT-4.1轨迹监督微调Qwen3-32B，并在简化环境中应用RL。

Result: SFT模型性能与GPT-4.1相当但尺寸缩小56倍；RL在匹配训练测试条件下带来7-20%绝对提升；"思考模式"表现持平或更差；SFT和RL模型在环境间泛化失败。

Conclusion: 训练测试环境匹配对于构建可靠的现实世界代码修复代理至关重要，模型在环境间缺乏泛化能力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real
repositories, where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation
unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix
build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning
dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced
a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL).
Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and
applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model
distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller,
and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions.
"Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models
failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of
matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 终身知识编辑需要在不完全重训练的情况下持续更新LLMs中的过时知识，但现有方法在编辑过程中会累积错误，导致编辑准确性和泛化能力逐渐下降。

Method: 结合神经元功能归因识别知识通用神经元和知识特定神经元，引入熵引导的动态稀疏掩码定位目标知识相关神经元，实现精确的神经元级知识编辑。

Result: 数千次连续编辑实验表明，NMKE在维持高编辑成功率和保留模型泛化能力方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NMKE通过细粒度的神经元级编辑策略，有效解决了终身知识编辑中的错误累积问题，提升了编辑精度和模型稳定性。

Abstract: Lifelong knowledge editing enables continuous, precise updates to outdated
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without computationally expensive
full retraining. However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout
the editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and
generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked
Knowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines
neuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron
functional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with
knowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and
knowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further
introduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to
the target knowledge. This strategy enables precise neuron-level knowledge
editing with fewer parameter modifications. Experimental results from thousands
of sequential edits demonstrate that NMKE outperforms existing methods in
maintaining high editing success rates and preserving model general
capabilities in lifelong editing.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为"独裁者客户端"的新型恶意攻击者类别，能够在联邦学习中完全消除其他客户端的贡献，同时保留自己的贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性引入了安全漏洞，恶意客户端可能操纵训练过程。本文旨在定义和分析这种新型攻击威胁。

Method: 提出了具体的攻击策略，系统分析了独裁者客户端对学习过程的影响，并探讨了多个独裁者客户端协作、独立行动或背叛等复杂场景。

Result: 理论分析和实证评估表明，独裁者客户端能够有效控制全局模型，消除其他客户端的贡献。在计算机视觉和自然语言处理基准测试中得到了验证。

Conclusion: 独裁者客户端构成了联邦学习中的严重安全威胁，需要开发相应的防御机制来应对这种新型攻击。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized
model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared
model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of
FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or
manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a
novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants
capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the
server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies
that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the
learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple
dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or
form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these
settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global
model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex
scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by
empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC)，一种基于掩码语言模型的有损文本压缩方法，通过存储最小化的排名修正来实现连续率失真控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在有损压缩领域的应用，在重建保真度和压缩比之间进行权衡，利用LLM作为强大的概率模型。

Method: 使用掩码语言模型作为解压缩器，允许模型预测掩码内容，仅当模型预测错误时存储基于排名的最小修正，创建提供连续率失真控制的残差通道。

Result: EPC在精确比特计算和率失真分析评估中始终优于预测掩码基线，以显著更低的比特率提供更优的保真度，更有效地利用模型内在知识。

Conclusion: EPC证明了基于语言模型的有损文本压缩的有效性，通过残差通道实现连续率失真控制，在压缩效率和重建质量方面表现优异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve near-optimal lossless compression by
acting as powerful probability models. We investigate their use in the lossy
domain, where reconstruction fidelity is traded for higher compression ratios.
This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text codec
that leverages a Masked Language Model (MLM) as a decompressor. Instead of
storing a subset of original tokens, EPC allows the model to predict masked
content and stores minimal, rank-based corrections only when the model's top
prediction is incorrect. This creates a residual channel that offers continuous
rate-distortion control. We compare EPC to a simpler Predictive Masking (PM)
baseline and a transform-based Vector Quantisation with a Residual Patch
(VQ+RE) approach. Through an evaluation that includes precise bit accounting
and rate-distortion analysis, we demonstrate that EPC consistently dominates
PM, offering superior fidelity at a significantly lower bit rate by more
efficiently utilising the model's intrinsic knowledge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Concept Walk是一个在激活空间中追踪模型内部概念立场演变的框架，通过将推理步骤投影到概念方向来区分装饰性推理和忠实推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有思维链追踪并不总是反映模型内部计算的真实情况，可能导致从业者误将装饰性推理视为真实推理，需要更好的监督方法。

Method: 在激活空间中操作，将每个推理步骤投影到从对比数据学习的概念方向上，观察推理痕迹是否影响结果或被丢弃。

Result: 在Qwen 3-4B模型的安全领域研究中发现，'简单'情况下被扰乱的思维链会被快速忽略（装饰性推理），而'困难'情况下扰动会持续改变内部激活（忠实推理）。

Conclusion: Concept Walk提供了通过概念特定内部动态重新检验忠实性的方法，帮助识别何时可以信任推理痕迹，何时可能误导从业者。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language
models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of
internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may
misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a
general framework for tracing how a model's internal stance evolves with
respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept
Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the
concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe
whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we
apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in
'easy' cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative
reasoning, whereas in 'hard' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in
internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is
methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through
concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can
be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners.

*Zirui Pang,Hao Zheng,Zhijie Deng,Ling Li,Zixin Zhong,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为平滑梯度上升（SGA）的LLM遗忘方法，通过将遗忘数据与多个构造的正常数据相结合，解决了传统梯度上升（GA）方法的不稳定性问题，在保持模型效用的同时实现更稳定的遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度上升（GA）方法在LLM遗忘中存在严重的不稳定性，会导致模型效用急剧下降。需要一种更稳定的遗忘方法来平衡遗忘效果和模型性能。

Method: 提出SGA方法，通过可调平滑率将遗忘数据与多个构造的正常数据相结合，从仅学习遗忘数据扩展到联合学习遗忘和正常数据，实现更稳定的遗忘。

Result: 在TOFU、Harry Potter和MUSE-NEWS三个基准测试中，SGA在所有指标上均优于原始GA方法，并在多个关键指标上达到所有基线方法的前2名性能。

Conclusion: SGA方法通过平滑机制有效解决了GA的不稳定性问题，在保持模型效用的同时实现了更稳定的LLM遗忘，并提供了最优平滑率的理论指导。

Abstract: LLM unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models
to forget hazardous/undesired knowledge at low cost while preserving as much
model utility as possible. Among existing techniques, the most straightforward
method is performing Gradient Ascent (GA) w.r.t. the forget data, thereby
forcing the model to unlearn the forget dataset. However, GA suffers from
severe instability, as it drives updates in a divergent direction, often
resulting in drastically degraded model utility. To address this issue, we
propose Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA). SGA combines the forget data with
multiple constructed normal data through a tunable smoothing rate. Intuitively,
this extends GA from learning solely on the forget data to jointly learning
across both forget and normal data, enabling more stable unlearning while
better preserving model utility. Theoretically, we provide the theoretical
guidance on the selection of the optimal smoothing rate. Empirically, we
evaluate SGA on three benchmarks: TOFU, Harry Potter, and MUSE-NEWS.
Experimental results demonstrate that SGA consistently outperforms the original
Gradient Ascent (GA) method across all metrics and achieves top-2 performance
among all baseline methods on several key metrics.

*Ren Yin,Takashi Ishida,Masashi Sugiyama*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于互补标签的可扩展监督框架，用于评估和训练前沿AI系统，无需真实标签，利用人类专家的领域知识提供弱信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在复杂任务上超越人类专家，获取高质量人类监督变得困难。人类专家通常只精通狭窄领域，无法评估超人类任务的正确性，但能提供互补标签指出错误选项。

Method: 从互补标签推导出无偏的top-1准确率估计器，量化所需互补标签数量；引入两种估计器结合稀缺的普通标签和丰富的互补标签；提供有限样本偏差保证。

Result: 实证表明，使用互补标签可以在没有真实标签的情况下评估大语言模型的输出；能够训练AI系统在分区人类监督下表现更好。

Conclusion: 提出的框架为评估前沿AI系统提供了可行的替代方案，利用人类专家的领域特定知识提供弱监督信号，实现可扩展的监督。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human
performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human
supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our
focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains.
Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single
narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI
systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise,
humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an
option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is
not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease.
Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that
enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the
ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from
complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to
match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to
combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide
finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed
estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large
language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We
further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how
we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with
this partitioned human supervision. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页代理无法有效适应新环境，缺乏对环境结构和动态的认知，导致执行计划效率低下。

Method: 使用认知地图构建、行动模拟、评论家分析和浏览器执行的分层架构，无需网站特定的LLM微调。

Result: 在WebArena-Lite基准测试中达到63%成功率，优于之前最先进方法的53.9%。

Conclusion: 模块化架构中的世界模型、分层规划器和前瞻重规划器对系统性能都有重要贡献。

Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively
adapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which
they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the
structure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we
introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action
Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a
model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in
cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a
lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner
proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in
cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and
update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On
the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%
success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous
systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning.
Ablations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and
look-ahead-based replanner confirming their complementary roles within the
design of our system

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TALE是一种推理时算法，通过直接优化任务特定验证性能来修剪整个Transformer层，无需重新训练即可在减少计算成本的同时提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在修剪Transformer层时通常需要重新训练，且不能保证在减少计算成本的同时提高任务性能。TALE旨在通过直接优化任务特定验证性能来实现无重训练的层修剪。

Method: TALE在推理时根据任务特定验证性能直接修剪整个Transformer层，无需重新训练。该方法还可在微调过程中应用以获得额外性能提升。

Result: 在9个任务和5个模型上的评估显示，TALE在所有基准测试中一致提高准确性同时减少计算成本。互信息分析表明某些层作为瓶颈会降低任务相关表示质量。

Conclusion: TALE的选择性层移除解决了瓶颈层问题，产生更小、更快、更准确的模型，同时提供对Transformer可解释性的新见解，并在准确性和效率之间提供灵活的用户控制。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Tale, Task-Aware Layer Elimination, an
inference-time algorithm that prunes entire transformer layers in an LLM by
directly optimizing task-specific validation performance. We evaluate TALE on 9
tasks and 5 models, including LLaMA 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Mistral
7B, and Lucie 7B, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Unlike prior
approaches, TALE requires no retraining and consistently improves accuracy
while reducing computational cost across all benchmarks. Furthermore, applying
TALE during finetuning leads to additional performance gains. Finally, TALE
provides flexible user control over trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
Mutual information analysis shows that certain layers act as bottlenecks,
degrading task-relevant representations. Tale's selective layer removal
remedies this problem, producing smaller, faster, and more accurate models that
are also faster to fine-tune while offering new insights into transformer
interpretability.

*Saeed Najafi,Alona Fyshe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的基于最大边际似然(MML)的偏好优化方法MMPO，用于对齐大语言模型与人类偏好，相比传统的RLHF方法更简单稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准的RLHF方法复杂且不稳定，需要寻找更简单有效的大语言模型对齐方法。

Method: 通过最大边际似然估计重新构建对齐问题，使用偏好对作为样本进行近似，无需显式奖励模型和熵最大化。

Result: 在135M到8B参数的模型上，MMPO在超参数β方面更稳定，在偏好对齐方面表现竞争性或更优，同时更好地保留了基础模型的通用语言能力。

Conclusion: MMPO通过梯度更新中的隐式偏好优化实现了改进的性能，为LLM对齐提供了一种更简单有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial, but
standard methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are
often complex and unstable. In this work, we propose a new, simpler approach
that recasts alignment through the lens of Maximum Marginal Likelihood (MML)
estimation. Our new MML based Preference Optimization (MMPO) maximizes the
marginal log-likelihood of a preferred text output, using the preference pair
as samples for approximation, and forgoes the need for both an explicit reward
model and entropy maximization. We theoretically demonstrate that MMPO
implicitly performs preference optimization, producing a weighted gradient that
naturally up-weights chosen responses over rejected ones. Across models ranging
from 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable
with respect to the hyperparameter $\beta$ compared to alternative baselines,
and 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better
preserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of
ablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed
attributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient
updates.

Motivation: 研究语言模型执行组合任务的能力，这些任务结合了上下文示例中展示的基本技能，这比标准设置更具挑战性。

Method: 对多个开源语言模型进行系统实验，使用语言和逻辑任务来探索组合能力，并通过理论分析验证结果。

Result: 简单任务示例对性能有负面影响的惊人发现，模型普遍难以正确识别和组装技能，即使使用思维链示例。

Conclusion: 示例与组合步骤的对齐至关重要，这一见解启发了改进的探测任务方法，其性能提升为研究提供了积极支持。

Abstract: Composing basic skills from simple tasks to accomplish composite tasks is
crucial for modern intelligent systems. We investigate the in-context
composition ability of language models to perform composite tasks that combine
basic skills demonstrated in in-context examples. This is more challenging than
the standard setting, where skills and their composition can be learned in
training. We conduct systematic experiments on various representative
open-source language models, utilizing linguistic and logical tasks designed to
probe composition abilities. The results reveal that simple task examples can
have a surprising negative impact on the performance, because the models
generally struggle to recognize and assemble the skills correctly, even with
Chain-of-Thought examples. Theoretical analysis further shows that it is
crucial to align examples with the corresponding steps in the composition. This
inspires a method for the probing tasks, whose improved performance provides
positive support for our insights.

Motivation: 现有强化学习研究主要关注密集模型，而MoE架构的RL训练研究不足，且MoE训练存在不稳定性问题。

Method: 设计基于路由器logits的重新缩放策略来优化离策略RL中的重要性采样权重，降低梯度方差。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法显著提高了MoE模型的收敛稳定性和最终性能。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了针对MoE架构的RL算法创新的潜力，为大规模专家模型的高效训练提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have substantially improved
the training of large-scale language models, leading to significant gains in
generation quality and reasoning ability. However, most existing research
focuses on dense models, while RL training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures remains underexplored. To address the instability commonly
observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize
importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a
rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient
variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the
final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic
innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction
for efficient training of large-scale expert models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为GSPO算法中的序列级权重提供信息论解释，帮助理解其经验特性如方差减少和训练稳定性。

Method: 通过数学推导建立GSPO序列权重与困惑度比值、交叉熵变化之间的等价关系，并在数学推理任务上进行实验验证。

Result: 证明了GSPO的序列权重$s(\theta) = (\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$可等价表示为$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$和$\exp(\Delta H)$，验证了方差预测。

Conclusion: 信息论视角为理解GSPO算法提供了有价值的理论框架，解释了其通过几何平均实现对数域方差减少和在混合专家模型中保持训练稳定性的机制。

Abstract: We provide a new perspective on GSPO's length-normalized importance ratios by
establishing their connection to information-theoretic quantities. We show that
GSPO's sequence-level weight $s(\theta) =
(\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$ can be equivalently expressed
as the inverse perplexity ratio
$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$ and as the exponential
cross-entropy change $\exp(\Delta H)$. While the perplexity-entropy
relationship follows from standard definitions, this observation provides a
useful lens for understanding GSPO: the algorithm weights policy gradient
updates by perplexity ratios, offering an information-theoretic interpretation
of the importance weights. This perspective helps explain GSPO's empirical
properties, including log-domain variance reduction through geometric averaging
and stability in training mixture-of-experts models. We validate the
mathematical equivalences and variance predictions through controlled
experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续预训练缩放定律通常假设固定的预训练预算，这限制了它们预测在不同token-per-parameter(PTPP)下训练模型的适应结果的能力。

Method: 开发PTPP感知的自适应缩放定律，使预训练预算成为显式变量，并在多语言设置（英语/阿拉伯语→法语）上进行验证。

Result: 在早期阶段（PTPP={15,31}）训练的PTPP感知公式能够预测PTPP=279时的目标损失，并在多个指标上优于PTPP不可知的基线方法。

Conclusion: PTPP感知缩放定律不仅能准确预测自适应损失，还能在实际应用中用于规划重放比例和自适应token预算，在计算限制下满足目标和遗忘约束。

Abstract: Continual pre-training (CPT) for domain adaptation must balance target-domain
gains with stability on the base domain. Existing CPT scaling laws typically
assume a fixed pre-training budget, which limits their ability to forecast
adaptation outcomes for models trained at different tokens-per-parameter
(PTPP). We present \emph{PTPP-aware} adaptation scaling laws that make the
pre-training budget an explicit variable, enabling accurate \emph{prediction}
of adaptation loss at unseen \ptpp. On a multilingual setup (English/Arabic
$\rightarrow$ French), PTPP-aware formulations trained on early stages
(\ptpp{}=\{15,31\}) predict target loss at \ptpp{}=279 and outperform a
PTPP-agnostic \dcpt{} transfer baseline on metrics (Huber-on-log,
MAE$_\mathrm{rel}$, calibration slope); full diagnostics (RMSE, MAPE) are in
the appendix. Beyond forecasting, we show a practical use case: planning replay
ratios and adaptation token budgets that satisfy target and forgetting
constraints under compute limits.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that
integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text
recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for
Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model,
trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions
from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to
extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer
model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5
languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our
architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is
evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and
translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates
promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for
translating text directly from images.

Conclusion: 将变分推断集成到掩码扩散中具有重要价值，VMD增强了生成质量和依赖感知能力。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for
discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked
diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens
that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when
dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among
tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that
introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through
controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD
successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to
capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku
puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves
global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality
and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational
inference into masked diffusion. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性，允许组合和调整其他线性判别嵌入方法，提出的混合方法在监督多类分类问题中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The performance of machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms
generally depends on data representation. That is why, much of the current
effort in performing machine learning algorithms goes into the design of
preprocessing frameworks and data transformations able to support effective
machine learning. The method proposed in this work consists of a hybrid linear
feature extraction scheme to be used in supervised multi-class classification
problems. Inspired by two recent linear discriminant methods: robust sparse
linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsitybased
discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), we propose a unifying
criterion that is able to retain the advantages of these two powerful methods.
The resulting transformation relies on sparsity-promoting techniques both to
select the features that most accurately represent the data and to preserve the
row-sparsity consistency property of samples from the same class. The linear
transformation and the orthogonal matrix are estimated using an iterative
alternating minimization scheme based on steepest descent gradient method and
different initialization schemes. The proposed framework is generic in the
sense that it allows the combination and tuning of other linear discriminant
embedding methods. According to the experiments conducted on several datasets
including faces, objects, and digits, the proposed method was able to
outperform competing methods in most cases.

Abstract: Generative modeling has emerged as a powerful paradigm for representation
learning, but its direct applicability to challenging fields like medical
imaging remains limited: mere generation, without task alignment, fails to
provide a robust foundation for clinical use. We propose MAGIC-Flow, a
conditional multiscale normalizing flow architecture that performs generation
and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a
hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian
determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures
exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility
enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an
interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels,
MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled
class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and
discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using
metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it
addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and
modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates

*Siddharth Jain,Shyamgopal Karthik,Vineet Gandhi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用预训练模型库进行知识转移的方法，通过数据分区让模型自主扮演学生或教师角色，在图像分类、语义分割和视频显著性预测等任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型在深度学习领域普遍存在，但不同模型设计选择导致泛化行为存在差异。现有模型库中不同模型掌握着互补的数据特定洞察，可以作为模型改进的辅助资源。

Method: 引入数据分区策略，让预训练模型自主选择扮演学生（寻求知识）或教师（传授知识）角色。支持双向知识转移、跨架构知识转移以及多模型间的知识转移。

Result: 在图像分类中，ViT-B通过双向知识转移性能提升约1.4%；语义分割中所有评估指标均得到提升；视频显著性预测达到新的最先进水平；多模型知识转移使所有参与模型性能显著改善。

Conclusion: 利用公开模型库作为辅助改进源是有效的，提出的自主知识转移策略在多个任务中均能显著提升模型性能，证明了模型间知识互补的价值。

Abstract: Pretrained models are ubiquitous in the current deep learning landscape,
offering strong results on a broad range of tasks. Recent works have shown that
models differing in various design choices exhibit categorically diverse
generalization behavior, resulting in one model grasping distinct data-specific
insights unavailable to the other. In this paper, we propose to leverage large
publicly available model repositories as an auxiliary source of model
improvements. We introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models
autonomously adopt either the role of a student, seeking knowledge, or that of
a teacher, imparting knowledge. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In image classification, we
improved the performance of ViT-B by approximately 1.4% through bidirectional
knowledge transfer with ViT-T. For semantic segmentation, our method boosted
all evaluation metrics by enabling knowledge transfer both within and across
backbone architectures. In video saliency prediction, our approach achieved a
new state-of-the-art. We further extend our approach to knowledge transfer
between multiple models, leading to considerable performance improvements for
all model participants.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出使用康威生命游戏替代传统dropout进行正则化，通过动态单元失活机制在CIFAR-10数据集上取得与传统dropout相当的性能，同时提供更好的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统dropout技术存在静态性和缺乏可解释性的局限，需要一种更动态、可解释的正则化方法。

Method: 将神经网络单元表示为生命游戏网格中的细胞，应用游戏规则动态失活单元，形成适应训练数据的空间模式。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，该方法与传统dropout技术性能相当，同时通过演化模式可视化提供网络行为洞察。

Conclusion: 基于生命游戏的动态单元失活是有效的正则化替代方案，特别适用于深层架构，能增强不同dropout技术的性能。

Abstract: Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and
improving the generalization performance of neural networks. Dropout, a widely
used regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to
introduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its
effectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of
interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization
by substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata
with simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce
dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units
as cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units. This
approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the
training data, potentially enhancing the network's ability to generalize. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing
that dynamic unit deactivation using GoL achieves comparable performance to
traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the network's
behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns. Furthermore, our
discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper
architectures, demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different
dropout techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LAMP是一个数据高效的3D生成框架，通过线性仿射混合参数化形状实现可控、可解释的3D几何生成，支持插值、外推和物理性能优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量训练数据，在可控性和泛化性方面存在局限，需要开发数据效率高且可控的3D生成方法。

Method: 首先通过共享初始化对齐SDF解码器，然后在对齐权重空间中求解参数约束的混合问题，并通过线性度不匹配检测几何有效性。

Result: LAMP在DrivAerNet++和BlendedNet基准测试中表现出色，仅需100个样本即可实现可控插值，支持100%参数差异的外推，并优于条件自编码器和DNI基线。

Conclusion: LAMP推进了可控、数据高效且安全的3D生成，适用于设计探索、数据集生成和性能驱动优化。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D geometries that satisfy specific parameter
constraints has broad applications in design and engineering. However, current
methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with
controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of
Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and
interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF)
decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then
synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in
the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety
metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP
on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that
LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100
samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond
training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed
parameters. LAMP significantly outperforms conditional autoencoder and Deep
Network Interpolation (DNI) baselines in both extrapolation and data
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LAMP advances controllable,
data-efficient, and safe 3D generation for design exploration, dataset
generation, and performance-driven optimization.

TL;DR: S-Chain是首个大规模医学视觉推理数据集，包含12,000张专家标注的医学图像和结构化视觉链式思维(SV-CoT)，通过边界框明确连接视觉区域与推理步骤，支持16种语言，显著提升医学视觉语言模型的解释性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学视觉语言模型缺乏透明地对齐文本推理与视觉证据的能力，需要大规模专家级数据集来支持逐步推理和精确视觉定位。

Method: 构建S-Chain数据集，包含专家标注的医学图像、边界框和结构化视觉CoT；使用该数据集对现有医学和通用VLMs进行基准测试；研究其与检索增强生成的协同作用；提出加强视觉证据与推理对齐的新机制。

Result: SV-CoT监督显著提高了模型的可解释性、定位保真度和鲁棒性；揭示了领域知识与视觉定位在自回归推理中的交互作用；新机制改善了可靠性和效率。

Conclusion: S-Chain为医学推理建立了新的基准，为构建更可信和可解释的医学视觉语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only
accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales
and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise
in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset
has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce
S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical
images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly
linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16
languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability.
Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med,
LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that
SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity,
and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with
retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual
grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new
mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning,
improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark
for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and
explainable medical VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在结构工程任务中，当数据有限时，将物理定律嵌入深度学习模型特别有用。该研究旨在利用PINNs预测小型意大利面桥梁的重量，这对于理解简化结构模型的载荷极限和潜在失效模式具有重要意义。

Method: 提出了标准PINNs和新型物理信息Kolmogorov Arnold网络(PIKAN)架构，将通用函数逼近理论与物理洞察相结合。结构参数通过手动或计算机视觉方法收集，数据集包含15个真实桥梁并扩充至100个样本。

Conclusion: PINNs能够为轻量级桥梁设计提供可靠的结构重量估计，有助于早期失效分析，并提供了基于网络的参数输入和预测界面。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their
ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly
useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to
explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti
bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure
modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates
physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In
addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics
Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function
approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided
as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision
methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and
our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based
interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can
offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may
help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.

TL;DR: T-REGS是一个基于最小生成树长度的自监督学习正则化框架，能够同时缓解维度塌陷并促进表示分布的均匀性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习需要避免维度塌陷和增强分布均匀性，现有方法在这两方面存在不足。

Method: 提出T-REGS框架，利用最小生成树长度作为正则化项，在任意紧致黎曼流形上分析其理论性质。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明T-REGS能有效提升表示质量，在合成数据和经典SSL基准测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: T-REGS是一个简单有效的正则化方法，能同时解决维度塌陷和分布不均匀问题。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to
input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have
highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding
dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional
subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this
work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on
the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation.
We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously
mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on
arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data
and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at
enhancing representation quality.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过让SWE代理在代码库中引入功能时意外破坏测试来生成高质量、多样化bug的新方法，相比传统方法更贴近真实开发过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量bug对于训练下一代基于语言模型的软件工程代理至关重要，现有方法通过故意引入局部扰动生成bug，会产生分布外效应且不反映真实开发过程。

Method: 指导SWE代理在代码库中引入新功能，在此过程中可能意外破坏测试，从而产生bug。这种方法更贴近人类开发者的编辑模式。

Result: 新方法生成的bug在监督微调中提供更高效的训练数据，仅用1200个bug就比其他数据集3000个bug表现好2%。训练出的FrogBoss和FrogMini模型在SWE-bench Verified上分别达到54.6%和45.3%的pass@1准确率。

Conclusion: 通过模拟真实开发过程生成bug的方法比传统方法更有效，能够训练出在软件工程基准测试上达到最先进水平的模型。

Abstract: High quality bugs are key to training the next generation of language model
based software engineering (SWE) agents. We introduce a novel method for
synthetic generation of difficult and diverse bugs. Our method instructs SWE
Agents to introduce a feature into the codebase whereby they may
unintentionally break tests, resulting in bugs. Prior approaches often induce
an out-of-distribution effect by generating bugs intentionally (e.g. by
introducing local perturbation to existing code), which does not reflect
realistic development processes. We perform qualitative analysis to demonstrate
that our approach for generating bugs more closely reflects the patterns found
in human-authored edits. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our
bugs provide more efficient training data for supervised fine-tuning,
outperforming other bug datasets by 2% with half the training data (1.2k vs. 3k
bugs). We train on our newly generated bugs in addition to existing bug
datasets to get FrogBoss a state-of-the-art 32B parameter model on SWE-bench
Verified with a pass@1 of 54.6% and FrogMini a state-of-the-art 14B model on
SWE-bench Verified with a pass@1 of 45.3% on SWE-bench Verified averaged over

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CIF机制在某些语言（如英语和法语）中由于缺乏细粒度指导而导致稳定性下降，需要改进对齐质量。

Method: M-CIF通过逐步蒸馏字符和音素级监督到子词表示中，实现多级对齐，增强声学-文本对齐的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验显示M-CIF相比Paraformer基线显著降低WER，在CommonVoice德语上降低4.21%，法语上降低3.05%。

Conclusion: 音素和字符层对于增强渐进式CIF对齐至关重要，多尺度监督能有效提升不同语言的识别性能。

Abstract: The Continuous Integrate-and-Fire (CIF) mechanism provides effective
alignment for non-autoregressive (NAR) speech recognition. This mechanism
creates a smooth and monotonic mapping from acoustic features to target tokens,
achieving performance on Mandarin competitive with other NAR approaches.
However, without finer-grained guidance, its stability degrades in some
languages such as English and French. In this paper, we propose Multi-scale CIF
(M-CIF), which performs multi-level alignment by integrating character and
phoneme level supervision progressively distilled into subword representations,
thereby enhancing robust acoustic-text alignment. Experiments show that M-CIF
reduces WER compared to the Paraformer baseline, especially on CommonVoice by
4.21% in German and 3.05% in French. To further investigate these gains, we
define phonetic confusion errors (PE) and space-related segmentation errors
(SE) as evaluation metrics. Analysis of these metrics across different M-CIF
settings reveals that the phoneme and character layers are essential for
enhancing progressive CIF alignment.

TL;DR: ISA-Bench是一个评估大型音频语言模型指令敏感性的动态基准，从指令描述、输出格式和任务组合三个维度进行分析。研究发现现有LALMs存在显著的指令敏感性，通过微调Qwen2-Audio可以改善指令遵循性能，但会引发灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型对指令表述方式高度敏感，影响指令遵循率和任务性能，但缺乏系统评估这种敏感性的基准。

Method: 构建ISA-Bench基准，从三个维度评估指令敏感性：指令描述、输出格式和任务组合。评估开源和专有LALMs，并通过微调Qwen2-Audio在复杂指令变体数据集上来缓解指令敏感性问题。

Result: 实验显示即使最先进的LALMs也存在显著指令敏感性，导致基础音频理解任务性能下降。微调后指令遵循性能显著提升，但引发了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: ISA-Bench为评估和改进LALMs的指令敏感性提供了标准化基础，强调了实际应用中指令鲁棒音频理解的重要性。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), which couple acoustic perception with
large language models (LLMs) to extract and understand diverse information from
audio, have attracted intense interest from both academic and industrial
communities. However, existing LALMs are highly sensitive to how instructions
are phrased, affecting both (i) instruction-following rates and (ii) task
performance. Yet, no existing benchmarks offer a systematic and comprehensive
evaluation of this sensitivity. We introduce ISA-Bench, a dynamic benchmark
evaluating instruction sensitivity for LALMs along three axes: instruction
description, output format, and task composition. We assess recent open-source
and proprietary LALMs using ISA-Bench, profiling both compliance and accuracy
under controlled instruction variations. Experimental results reveal that even
state-of-the-art LALMs suffer significant instruction sensitivity, leading to
degraded performance on fundamental audio understanding tasks. To mitigate this
issue, we fine-tune Qwen2-Audio on a specifically constructed complex
instruction-variant dataset, achieving a marked improvement in
instruction-following performance. However, this also induces nontrivial
catastrophic forgetting: the model loses some previously mastered task
capabilities when exposed to new instruction styles. Our benchmark provides a
standardized basis for assessing and improving instruction sensitivity in
LALMs, underscoring the need for instruction-robust audio understanding in
real-world pipelines.

*Sergio Rojas-Galeano*

Main category: cs.HC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM的方法来解决IVR系统中用户意图路由的问题，通过生成合成IVR结构和用户意图数据，比较了两种提示设计的性能，发现扁平化路径表示比描述性层次菜单具有更高的路由准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统触摸式IVR系统的僵化性导致用户体验不佳，需要更直接的语言交互方式。虽然语音技术是必要的，但关键挑战在于将用户表达意图路由到IVR菜单路径，而真实IVR数据的稀缺限制了这一领域的研究进展。

Method: 使用三个不同的LLM模型：1）合成23节点真实IVR结构，2）生成920个用户意图（230个基础意图和690个增强意图），3）执行路由任务。评估了两种提示设计：描述性层次菜单和扁平化路径表示。

Result: 扁平化路径在基础数据集上达到89.13%的准确率，显著高于描述性格式的81.30%。数据增强引入了语言噪声，略微降低了性能。混淆矩阵分析表明，表现不佳的路由可能反映了菜单设计的冗余性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了LLM能够通过更流畅、无缝的用户体验实现IVR路由，将客户服务从触摸式菜单向前推进了一步，为改善IVR系统提供了概念验证。

Abstract: Widespread frustration with rigid touch-tone Interactive Voice Response (IVR)
systems for customer service underscores the need for more direct and intuitive
language interaction. While speech technologies are necessary, the key
challenge lies in routing intents from user phrasings to IVR menu paths, a task
where Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong potential. Progress, however, is
limited by data scarcity, as real IVR structures and interactions are often
proprietary. We present a novel LLM-based methodology to address this gap.
Using three distinct models, we synthesized a realistic 23-node IVR structure,
generated 920 user intents (230 base and 690 augmented), and performed the
routing task. We evaluate two prompt designs: descriptive hierarchical menus
and flattened path representations, across both base and augmented datasets.
Results show that flattened paths consistently yield higher accuracy, reaching
89.13% on the base dataset compared to 81.30% with the descriptive format,
while augmentation introduces linguistic noise that slightly reduces
performance. Confusion matrix analysis further suggests that low-performing
routes may reflect not only model limitations but also redundancies in menu
design. Overall, our findings demonstrate proof-of-concept that LLMs can enable
IVR routing through a smoother, more seamless user experience -- moving
customer service one step ahead of touch-tone menus.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在搜救、消防等高危任务中，人机团队的信任至关重要。当团队成员分布在不同位置时，机器人拒绝立即改变优先级可能会损害用户信任，需要研究如何缓解这种信任破坏。

Method: 采用基于计算机的研究方法，38名参与者与机器人队友一起玩互动消防游戏，在机器人拒绝立即帮助时制造信任违反场景，比较提供解释与不提供解释两种情况下的信任动态变化。

Result: 当机器人提供拒绝帮助的解释时，信任随时间推移能更好恢复，尽管初始信任下降与无解释基线条件相当。信任在任务期间会显著波动，特别是在机器人不立即响应用户请求时。

Conclusion: 在人机协作任务中，机器人不立即响应用户请求会造成信任违反，但通过提供充分的解释，这种信任破坏可以在很大程度上得到缓解和恢复。

Abstract: Mobile robots with some degree of autonomy could deliver significant
advantages in high-risk missions such as search and rescue and firefighting.
Integrated into a human-robot team (HRT), robots could work effectively to help
search hazardous buildings. User trust is a key enabler for HRT, but during a
mission, trust can be damaged. With distributed situation awareness, such as
when team members are working in different locations, users may be inclined to
doubt a robot's integrity if it declines to immediately change its priorities
on request. In this paper, we present the results of a computer-based study
investigating on-mission trust dynamics in a high-stakes human-robot teaming
scenario. Participants (n = 38) played an interactive firefighting game
alongside a robot teammate, where a trust violation occurs owing to the robot
declining to help the user immediately. We find that when the robot provides an
explanation for declining to help, trust better recovers over time, albeit
following an initial drop that is comparable to a baseline condition where an
explanation for refusal is not provided. Our findings indicate that trust can
vary significantly during a mission, notably when robots do not immediately
respond to user requests, but that this trust violation can be largely
ameliorated over time if adequate explanation is provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统数码相机动态范围有限的问题，通过融合不同曝光图像来重现人眼能感知的宽亮度范围自然场景。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络融合欠曝光和过曝光的LDR图像，欠曝光图像保留亮部细节，过曝光图像保留暗部信息，网络学习融合互补信息。采用无监督训练，不依赖真实HDR数据，并引入定制化损失函数优化性能。

Result: 在MEF-SSIM指标评估下，该方法相比现有融合方法获得了更优的视觉质量。

Conclusion: 提出的深度学习多曝光融合方法能够有效生成高质量HDR图像，且无需真实HDR训练数据，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging aims to reproduce the wide range of
brightness levels present in natural scenes, which the human visual system can
perceive but conventional digital cameras often fail to capture due to their
limited dynamic range. To address this limitation, we propose a deep
learning-based multi-exposure fusion approach for HDR image generation. The
method takes a set of differently exposed Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images,
typically an underexposed and an overexposed image, and learns to fuse their
complementary information using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The
underexposed image preserves details in bright regions, while the overexposed
image retains information in dark regions; the network effectively combines
these to reconstruct a high-quality HDR output. The model is trained in an
unsupervised manner, without relying on ground-truth HDR images, making it
practical for real-world applications where such data is unavailable. We
evaluate our results using the Multi-Exposure Fusion Structural Similarity
Index Measure (MEF-SSIM) and demonstrate that our approach achieves superior
visual quality compared to existing fusion methods. A customized loss function
is further introduced to improve reconstruction fidelity and optimize model
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低光图像增强方法要么忽略频域信息的重要性，要么无法有效促进信息传播和流动，限制了性能提升。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：第一阶段恢复低光图像的振幅改善亮度，第二阶段恢复相位信息细化结构；开发频率-空间交互块融合互补信息；构建信息交换模块关联两阶段。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉结果和定量指标方面均取得优异性能，同时保持良好的模型效率。

Conclusion: FSIDNet通过频率-空间交互和两阶段架构有效提升了低光图像增强性能，证明了频域信息在LLIE中的重要性。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims at improving the perception or
interpretability of an image captured in an environment with poor illumination.
With the advent of deep learning, the LLIE technique has achieved significant
breakthroughs. However, existing LLIE methods either ignore the important role
of frequency domain information or fail to effectively promote the propagation
and flow of information, limiting the LLIE performance. In this paper, we
develop a novel frequency-spatial interaction-driven network (FSIDNet) for LLIE
based on two-stage architecture. To be specific, the first stage is designed to
restore the amplitude of low-light images to improve the lightness, and the
second stage devotes to restore phase information to refine fine-grained
structures. Considering that Frequency domain and spatial domain information
are complementary and both favorable for LLIE, we further develop two
frequency-spatial interaction blocks which mutually amalgamate the
complementary spatial and frequency information to enhance the capability of
the model. In addition, we construct the Information Exchange Module (IEM) to
associate two stages by adequately incorporating cross-stage and cross-scale
features to effectively promote the propagation and flow of information in the
two-stage network structure. Finally, we conduct experiments on several widely
used benchmark datasets (i.e., LOL-Real, LSRW-Huawei, etc.), which demonstrate
that our method achieves the excellent performance in terms of visual results

TL;DR: 使用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)生成合成颈椎X光片，在临床图灵测试中专家无法区分真实与合成图像，为医学影像机器学习提供了可扩展的隐私保护数据解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经外科机器学习面临高质量医学影像数据集稀缺的挑战，合成数据提供了一种可扩展且保护隐私的解决方案。

Method: 基于4,963张颈椎X光片训练DDPM模型，通过训练/验证损失和Frechet inception距离监控性能，并让6名神经放射科医生和2名脊柱专科神经外科医生进行盲法临床图灵测试。

Result: 专家正确识别真实图像的准确率仅为29%，真实图像与合成图像的真实性评分无显著差异，最近邻分析显示无记忆化现象，生成了20,063张合成X光片数据集。

Conclusion: DDPM生成的颈椎X光片在真实性和质量上与真实临床图像统计上无法区分，为机器学习在标志点定位、分割和分类等应用提供了大规模神经影像数据集的新方法。

Abstract: Machine learning in neurosurgery is limited by challenges in assembling
large, high-quality imaging datasets. Synthetic data offers a scalable,
privacy-preserving solution. We evaluated the feasibility of generating
realistic lateral cervical spine radiographs using a denoising diffusion
probabilistic model (DDPM) trained on 4,963 images from the Cervical Spine
X-ray Atlas. Model performance was monitored via training/validation loss and
Frechet inception distance, and synthetic image quality was assessed in a
blinded "clinical Turing test" with six neuroradiologists and two
spine-fellowship trained neurosurgeons. Experts reviewed 50 quartets containing
one real and three synthetic images, identifying the real image and rating
realism on a 4-point Likert scale. Experts correctly identified the real image
in 29% of trials (Fleiss' kappa=0.061). Mean realism scores were comparable
between real (3.323) and synthetic images (3.228, 3.258, and 3.320; p=0.383,
0.471, 1.000). Nearest-neighbor analysis found no evidence of memorization. We
also provide a dataset of 20,063 synthetic radiographs. These results
demonstrate that DDPM-generated cervical spine X-rays are statistically
indistinguishable in realism and quality from real clinical images, offering a
novel approach to creating large-scale neuroimaging datasets for ML
applications in landmarking, segmentation, and classification.

TL;DR: TraceTrans是一个新颖的可变形图像翻译模型，用于术后预测，能生成与目标分布对齐的图像，同时明确显示与术前输入的空间对应关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像翻译方法主要关注匹配目标分布，但忽略了源图像与翻译图像之间的空间对应关系，导致结构不一致和幻觉问题，这在临床应用中尤其影响可靠性和可解释性。

Method: 采用编码器进行特征提取，双解码器分别预测空间变形和合成翻译图像。预测的变形场对生成输出施加空间约束，确保与源的解剖一致性。

Result: 在医学美容和脑MRI数据集上的广泛实验表明，TraceTrans能提供准确且可解释的术后预测结果。

Conclusion: TraceTrans具有可靠的临床部署潜力，能够生成解剖一致且可解释的术后预测图像。

Abstract: Image-to-image translation models have achieved notable success in converting
images across visual domains and are increasingly used for medical tasks such
as predicting post-operative outcomes and modeling disease progression.
However, most existing methods primarily aim to match the target distribution
and often neglect spatial correspondences between the source and translated
images. This limitation can lead to structural inconsistencies and
hallucinations, undermining the reliability and interpretability of the
predictions. These challenges are accentuated in clinical applications by the
stringent requirement for anatomical accuracy. In this work, we present
TraceTrans, a novel deformable image translation model designed for
post-operative prediction that generates images aligned with the target
distribution while explicitly revealing spatial correspondences with the
pre-operative input. The framework employs an encoder for feature extraction
and dual decoders for predicting spatial deformations and synthesizing the
translated image. The predicted deformation field imposes spatial constraints
on the generated output, ensuring anatomical consistency with the source.
Extensive experiments on medical cosmetology and brain MRI datasets demonstrate
that TraceTrans delivers accurate and interpretable post-operative predictions,
highlighting its potential for reliable clinical deployment.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的事件引导视频帧插值框架，通过目标自适应事件采样和重要性映射来解决曝光无关场景下的插值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件引导方法在处理严重低帧率模糊视频时，由于缺乏时间约束而难以产生满意结果，特别是在未知动态曝光条件下。

Method: 采用目标自适应事件采样(TES)在目标时间戳和未知曝光时间周围采样事件，以及目标自适应重要性映射(TIM)生成考虑时间邻近性和空间相关性的重要性图。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在曝光无关视频帧插值场景中具有有效性。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架通过自适应事件采样和特征融合机制，成功解决了曝光无关视频帧插值的挑战。

Abstract: Exposure-agnostic video frame interpolation (VFI) is a challenging task that
aims to recover sharp, high-frame-rate videos from blurry, low-frame-rate
inputs captured under unknown and dynamic exposure conditions. Event cameras
are sensors with high temporal resolution, making them especially advantageous
for this task. However, existing event-guided methods struggle to produce
satisfactory results on severely low-frame-rate blurry videos due to the lack
of temporal constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel event-guided
framework for exposure-agnostic VFI, addressing this limitation through two key
components: a Target-adaptive Event Sampling (TES) and a Target-adaptive
Importance Mapping (TIM). Specifically, TES samples events around the target
timestamp and the unknown exposure time to better align them with the
corresponding blurry frames. TIM then generates an importance map that
considers the temporal proximity and spatial relevance of consecutive features
to the target. Guided by this map, our framework adaptively blends consecutive
features, allowing temporally aligned features to serve as the primary cues
while spatially relevant ones offer complementary support. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in exposure-agnostic VFI scenarios.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的弱引用表达学习范式(WREL)用于遥感图像分割，通过结合少量精确引用表达和大量类别名称作为弱引用表达，在有限标注条件下实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感图像中的高质量引用表达获取困难，因为存在大量小尺寸、密集分布的目标和复杂背景，需要解决标注成本高的问题。

Method: 提出LRB-WREL方法，集成可学习参考库(LRB)通过样本特定的提示嵌入来细化弱引用表达，结合使用动态调度EMA更新的师生优化框架来稳定训练。

Result: 在新建基准上的大量实验表明，WREL和LRB-WREL能够接近甚至超过使用完全标注引用表达训练的模型性能。

Conclusion: 混合引用训练在理论上具有可证明的性能上限，WREL为遥感图像分割提供了一种有效的弱监督学习解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (RRSIS) aims to segment instances
in remote sensing images according to referring expressions. Unlike Referring
Image Segmentation on general images, acquiring high-quality referring
expressions in the remote sensing domain is particularly challenging due to the
prevalence of small, densely distributed objects and complex backgrounds. This
paper introduces a new learning paradigm, Weakly Referring Expression Learning
(WREL) for RRSIS, which leverages abundant class names as weakly referring
expressions together with a small set of accurate ones to enable efficient
training under limited annotation conditions. Furthermore, we provide a
theoretical analysis showing that mixed-referring training yields a provable
upper bound on the performance gap relative to training with fully annotated
referring expressions, thereby establishing the validity of this new setting.
We also propose LRB-WREL, which integrates a Learnable Reference Bank (LRB) to
refine weakly referring expressions through sample-specific prompt embeddings
that enrich coarse class-name inputs. Combined with a teacher-student
optimization framework using dynamically scheduled EMA updates, LRB-WREL
stabilizes training and enhances cross-modal generalization under noisy weakly
referring supervision. Extensive experiments on our newly constructed benchmark
with varying weakly referring data ratios validate both the theoretical
insights and the practical effectiveness of WREL and LRB-WREL, demonstrating
that they can approach or even surpass models trained with fully annotated
referring expressions.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了USF-MAE，首个基于超声数据的自监督掩码自编码基础模型，在370,000张超声图像上预训练，在三个下游分类任务中优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像解读面临噪声高、操作者依赖性强、视野有限等挑战，现有深度学习方法受限于标注数据稀缺和与非医学图像的领域差距。

Method: 使用视觉Transformer编码器-解码器架构，通过重建掩码图像块从无标签数据学习模态特定表示，在46个开源数据集的370,000张超声图像上预训练。

Result: 在三个公开下游分类基准测试中，USF-MAE持续优于传统CNN和ViT基线，F1分数分别为81.6%、79.6%和82.4%，展现了强大的跨解剖结构泛化能力。

Conclusion: USF-MAE证明了自监督预训练在超声图像分析中的有效性，无需标注数据即可学习丰富的表示，性能接近甚至超过监督基础模型。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is one of the most widely used diagnostic modalities,
offering real-time, radiation-free assessment across diverse clinical domains.
However, interpretation of ultrasound images remains challenging due to high
noise levels, operator dependence, and limited field of view, resulting in
substantial inter-observer variability. Current Deep Learning approaches are
hindered by the scarcity of large labeled datasets and the domain gap between
general and sonographic images, which limits the transferability of models
pretrained on non-medical data. To address these challenges, we introduce the
Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE),
the first large-scale self-supervised MAE framework pretrained exclusively on
ultrasound data. The model was pre-trained on 370,000 2D and 3D ultrasound
images curated from 46 open-source datasets, collectively termed OpenUS-46,
spanning over twenty anatomical regions. This curated dataset has been made
publicly available to facilitate further research and reproducibility. Using a
Vision Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, USF-MAE reconstructs masked
image patches, enabling it to learn rich, modality-specific representations
directly from unlabeled data. The pretrained encoder was fine-tuned on three
public downstream classification benchmarks: BUS-BRA (breast cancer), MMOTU-2D
(ovarian tumors), and GIST514-DB (gastrointestinal stromal tumors). Across all
tasks, USF-MAE consistently outperformed conventional CNN and ViT baselines,
achieving F1-scores of 81.6%, 79.6%, and 82.4%, respectively. Despite not using
labels during pretraining, USF-MAE approached the performance of the supervised
foundation model UltraSam on breast cancer classification and surpassed it on
the other tasks, demonstrating strong cross-anatomical generalization.

TL;DR: 本文改进了第一阶运动模型(FOMM)，通过用全局旋转替换雅可比变换来处理头部旋转问题，同时降低了40%-80%的比特率，并通过先进的归一化技术稳定了对抗训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FOMM模型虽然计算复杂度适中且比特率低，但由于采用图像扭曲方式生成面部动画，在处理强烈头部运动（特别是头部旋转）时存在局限性。

Method: 1) 用全局旋转替换FOMM中的雅可比变换来处理头部旋转；2) 在判别器中应用最先进的归一化技术来稳定对抗训练；3) 使用LPIPS和DISTS指标评估性能。

Result: 改进后的系统在头部旋转项目上表现更好，P帧比特率降低了40%-80%，同时生成了视觉上更吸引人的视频。

Conclusion: 通过全局旋转替换和判别器归一化技术，成功优化了FOMM模型，显著提高了处理头部旋转的能力并大幅降低了比特率。

Abstract: First Order Motion Model is a generative model that animates human heads
based on very little motion information derived from keypoints. It is a
promising solution for video communication because first it operates at very
low bitrate and second its computational complexity is moderate compared to
other learning based video codecs. However, it has strong limitations by
design. Since it generates facial animations by warping source-images, it fails
to recreate videos with strong head movements. This works concentrates on one
specific kind of head movements, namely head rotations. We show that replacing
the Jacobian transformations in FOMM by a global rotation helps the system to
perform better on items with head-rotations while saving 40% to 80% of bitrate
on P-frames. Moreover, we apply state-of-the-art normalization techniques to
the discriminator to stabilize the adversarial training which is essential for
generating visually appealing videos. We evaluate the performance by the
learned metics LPIPS and DISTS to show the success our optimizations.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
capabilities in various automation domains, particularly Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) operations, have garnered increasing attention. Current research
remains predominantly constrained to small-scale UAV applications, with most
studies focusing on isolated components such as path planning for toy drones,
while lacking comprehensive investigation of medium- and long-range UAV systems
in real-world operational contexts. Larger UAV platforms introduce distinct
challenges, including stringent requirements for airport-based take-off and
landing procedures, adherence to complex regulatory frameworks, and specialized
operational capabilities with elevated mission expectations. This position
paper presents the Next-Generation LLM for UAV (NeLV) system -- a comprehensive
demonstration and automation roadmap for integrating LLMs into multi-scale UAV
operations. The NeLV system processes natural language instructions to
orchestrate short-, medium-, and long-range UAV missions through five key
technical components: (i) LLM-as-Parser for instruction interpretation, (ii)
Route Planner for Points of Interest (POI) determination, (iii) Path Planner
for waypoint generation, (iv) Control Platform for executable trajectory
implementation, and (v) UAV monitoring. We demonstrate the system's feasibility
through three representative use cases spanning different operational scales:
multi-UAV patrol, multi-POI delivery, and multi-hop relocation. Beyond the
current implementation, we establish a five-level automation taxonomy that
charts the evolution from current LLM-as-Parser capabilities (Level 1) to fully
autonomous LLM-as-Autopilot systems (Level 5), identifying technical
prerequisites and research challenges at each stage.

TL;DR: VITA-E是一个新颖的具身交互框架，通过双模型架构实现行为并发和实时中断处理，提升VLA模型的交互灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型受限于僵化的静态交互范式，无法同时观察、聆听、说话和行动，也难以处理实时用户中断，这阻碍了无缝的具身协作。

Method: 采用双模型架构，两个并行VLA实例分别作为"主动模型"和"待机模型"，实现并发多任务处理；提出"模型即控制器"范式，通过特殊令牌直接控制系统行为。

Result: 在物理人形平台上验证，VITA-E能可靠处理复杂交互场景，在紧急停止和语音中断方面达到极高成功率，并能成功执行并发语音和动作。

Conclusion: 该框架代表了向更自然、更强大的具身助手迈出的重要一步，兼容多种双系统VLA模型。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are often constrained by a rigid,
static interaction paradigm, which lacks the ability to see, hear, speak, and
act concurrently as well as handle real-time user interruptions dynamically.
This hinders seamless embodied collaboration, resulting in an inflexible and
unresponsive user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce
VITA-E, a novel embodied interaction framework designed for both behavioral
concurrency and nearly real-time interruption. The core of our approach is a
dual-model architecture where two parallel VLA instances operate as an ``Active
Model'' and a ``Standby Model'', allowing the embodied agent to observe its
environment, listen to user speech, provide verbal responses, and execute
actions, all concurrently and interruptibly, mimicking human-like multitasking
capabilities. We further propose a ``model-as-controller'' paradigm, where we
fine-tune the VLM to generate special tokens that serve as direct system-level
commands, coupling the model's reasoning with the system's behavior.
Experiments conducted on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that VITA-E
can reliably handle complex interactive scenarios. Our framework is compatible
with various dual-system VLA models, achieving an extremely high success rate
on emergency stops and speech interruptions while also successfully performing
concurrent speech and action. This represents a significant step towards more
natural and capable embodied assistants.

Motivation: 当前主流的基于图像的害虫计数方法在处理害虫遮挡情况时存在局限性，需要一种能够改善害虫分布、使被遮挡个体可见的新方法。

Method: 开发了基于机械臂的自动搅拌系统，设计了六种代表性搅拌轨迹（圆形、方形、三角形、螺旋形、四个小圆形和随机线），并通过比较不同轨迹的计数误差和置信度选择最优轨迹，最后提出基于计数置信度的闭环控制系统实现自适应速度搅拌。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够有效改善害虫分布，提高计数准确性，特别是在处理害虫遮挡情况时表现优异。

Conclusion: 这是首个专门研究动态液体环境中不同搅拌轨迹对物体计数影响并实现自适应速度搅拌的研究，为解决害虫遮挡问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate monitoring of pest population dynamics is crucial for informed
decision-making in precision agriculture. Currently, mainstream image-based
pest counting methods primarily rely on image processing combined with machine
learning or deep learning for pest counting. However, these methods have
limitations and struggle to handle situations involving pest occlusion. To
address this issue, this paper proposed a robotic stirring method with
trajectory optimization and adaptive speed control for accurate pest counting
in water traps. First, we developed an automated stirring system for pest
counting in yellow water traps based on a robotic arm. Stirring alters the
distribution of pests in the yellow water trap, making some of the occluded
individuals visible for detection and counting. Then, we investigated the
impact of different stirring trajectories on pest counting performance and
selected the optimal trajectory for pest counting. Specifically, we designed
six representative stirring trajectories, including circle, square, triangle,
spiral, four small circles, and random lines, for the robotic arm to stir. And
by comparing the overall average counting error and counting confidence of
different stirring trajectories across various pest density scenarios, we
determined the optimal trajectory. Finally, we proposed a counting
confidence-driven closed-loop control system to achieve adaptive-speed
stirring. It uses changes in pest counting confidence between consecutive
frames as feedback to adjust the stirring speed. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study dedicated to investigating the effects of different
stirring trajectories on object counting in the dynamic liquid environment and
to implement adaptive-speed stirring for this type of task. Experimental
results show ...

Motivation: 弥合机器人感知中的差距，特别是在日本语境下的人机交互场景中，需要更丰富的物体属性标注来提升多模态感知性能。

Method: 使用包含类别、颜色、形状、大小、材料和空间关系等属性的综合模板，构建J-ORA数据集，并在专有和开源视觉语言模型上进行广泛评估。

Result: 详细物体属性的加入显著提升了多模态感知性能，但专有和开源VLMs之间仍存在差距。不同VLMs在理解物体功能和上下文关系方面表现出不同能力。

Conclusion: 丰富的上下文敏感属性标注对于在动态环境中推进机器人感知至关重要，J-ORA数据集为此提供了重要支持。

Abstract: We introduce J-ORA, a novel multimodal dataset that bridges the gap in robot
perception by providing detailed object attribute annotations within Japanese
human-robot dialogue scenarios. J-ORA is designed to support three critical
perception tasks, object identification, reference resolution, and next-action
prediction, by leveraging a comprehensive template of attributes (e.g.,
category, color, shape, size, material, and spatial relations). Extensive
evaluations with both proprietary and open-source Vision Language Models (VLMs)
reveal that incorporating detailed object attributes substantially improves
multimodal perception performance compared to without object attributes.
Despite the improvement, we find that there still exists a gap between
proprietary and open-source VLMs. In addition, our analysis of object
affordances demonstrates varying abilities in understanding object
functionality and contextual relationships across different VLMs. These
findings underscore the importance of rich, context-sensitive attribute
annotations in advancing robot perception in dynamic environments. See project

Abstract: Self-balancing exoskeletons offer a promising mobility solution for
individuals with lower-limb disabilities. For reliable long-term operation,
these exoskeletons require a perception system that is effective in changing
environments. In this work, we introduce LT-Exosense, a vision-centric,
multi-session mapping system designed to support long-term (semi)-autonomous
navigation for exoskeleton users. LT-Exosense extends single-session mapping
capabilities by incrementally fusing spatial knowledge across multiple
sessions, detecting environmental changes, and updating a persistent global
map. This representation enables intelligent path planning, which can adapt to
newly observed obstacles and can recover previous routes when obstructions are
removed. We validate LT-Exosense through several real-world experiments,
demonstrating a scalable multi-session map that achieves an average
point-to-point error below 5 cm when compared to ground-truth laser scans. We
also illustrate the potential application of adaptive path planning in
dynamically changing indoor environments.

Motivation: 现有方法通常仅使用语义模型来塑造奖励函数，无法在状态表示中直接嵌入语义特征。该方法旨在通过融合高级场景理解和低级控制信号，使智能体学习更鲁棒且可解释的驾驶规则。

Method: 提出BLIP-FusePPO框架，将VLM生成的语义嵌入与几何状态、LiDAR观测和PID控制反馈直接融合到智能体观测空间中，采用包含语义对齐、车道保持精度、障碍物避让和速度调节的混合奖励函数。

Conclusion: BLIP-FusePPO通过直接嵌入语义特征到状态表示中，减少了昂贵的运行时推理，确保语义指导始终可用，提高了策略学习的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining-driven
Fused State Representation in Proximal Policy Optimization (BLIP-FusePPO), a
novel multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) framework for autonomous
lane-keeping (LK), in which semantic embeddings generated by a vision-language
model (VLM) are directly fused with geometric states, LiDAR observations, and
Proportional-Integral-Derivative-based (PID) control feedback within the agent
observation space. The proposed method lets the agent learn driving rules that
are aware of their surroundings and easy to understand by combining high-level
scene understanding from the VLM with low-level control and spatial signals.
Our architecture brings together semantic, geometric, and control-aware
representations to make policy learning more robust. A hybrid reward function
that includes semantic alignment, LK accuracy, obstacle avoidance, and speed
regulation helps learning to be more efficient and generalizable. Our method is
different from the approaches that only use semantic models to shape rewards.
Instead, it directly embeds semantic features into the state representation.
This cuts down on expensive runtime inference and makes sure that semantic
guidance is always available. The simulation results show that the proposed
model is better at LK stability and adaptability than the best vision-based and
multimodal RL baselines in a wide range of difficult driving situations. We
make our code publicly available.

calibration algorithm-designed for 'handheld camera' robot arm
configurations-ensures that the end effector can be precisely positioned, with
a success rate exceeding 90%. The active leveling system, driven by the
STM32F103ZET6 main control chip and JY901S inertial measurement data, can
stabilize the irrigation platform on slopes up to 10 degrees, with a response
time of 1.8 seconds. Experimental results across three simulated agricultural
environments (standard greenhouse, hilly terrain, complex lighting) demonstrate
a 30-50% reduction in water consumption compared to conventional flood
irrigation, with water use efficiency exceeding 92% in all test cases.

Result: 在机器人狗上验证，序列化输入提升了感知和控制性能，模型尺寸合理，在开放区域GNSS航向估计稳健，但在高楼附近可靠性下降。

Conclusion: Seq-DeepIPC成功将端到端导航扩展到腿式机器人，展示了时序感知系统的优势，为未来研究提供了开源代码支持。

Abstract: We present Seq-DeepIPC, a sequential end-to-end perception-to-control model
for legged robot navigation in realworld environments. Seq-DeepIPC advances
intelligent sensing for autonomous legged navigation by tightly integrating
multi-modal perception (RGB-D + GNSS) with temporal fusion and control. The
model jointly predicts semantic segmentation and depth estimation, giving
richer spatial features for planning and control. For efficient deployment on
edge devices, we use EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder, reducing computation while
maintaining accuracy. Heading estimation is simplified by removing the noisy
IMU and instead computing the bearing angle directly from consecutive GNSS
positions. We collected a larger and more diverse dataset that includes both
road and grass terrains, and validated Seq-DeepIPC on a robot dog. Comparative
and ablation studies show that sequential inputs improve perception and control
in our models, while other baselines do not benefit. Seq-DeepIPC achieves
competitive or better results with reasonable model size; although GNSS-only
heading is less reliable near tall buildings, it is robust in open areas.
Overall, Seq-DeepIPC extends end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to
more versatile and temporally-aware systems. To support future research, we
will release the codes to our GitHub repository at
https://github.com/oskarnatan/Seq-DeepIPC.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需标记物的手术机器人本体感知方法，仅使用轻量级立体RGB摄像头和基于transformer的深度学习模型，实现被无菌覆盖物遮挡的手术机器人精确定位。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对完全覆盖无菌布的手术机器人实现无标记本体感知的演示，减少了设置复杂性，增强了安全性，为模块化和自主机器人手术铺平了道路。

Abstract: Despite their mechanical sophistication, surgical robots remain blind to
their surroundings. This lack of spatial awareness causes collisions, system
recoveries, and workflow disruptions, issues that will intensify with the
introduction of distributed robots with independent interacting arms. Existing
tracking systems rely on bulky infrared cameras and reflective markers,
providing only limited views of the surgical scene and adding hardware burden
in crowded operating rooms. We present a marker-free proprioception method that
enables precise localisation of surgical robots under their sterile draping
despite associated obstruction of visual cues. Our method solely relies on
lightweight stereo-RGB cameras and novel transformer-based deep learning
models. It builds on the largest multi-centre spatial robotic surgery dataset
to date (1.4M self-annotated images from human cadaveric and preclinical in
vivo studies). By tracking the entire robot and surgical scene, rather than
individual markers, our approach provides a holistic view robust to occlusions,
supporting surgical scene understanding and context-aware control. We
demonstrate an example of potential clinical benefits during in vivo breathing
compensation with access to tissue dynamics, unobservable under state of the
art tracking, and accurately locate in multi-robot systems for future
intelligent interaction. In addition, and compared with existing systems, our
method eliminates markers and improves tracking visibility by 25%. To our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of marker-free proprioception for
fully draped surgical robots, reducing setup complexity, enhancing safety, and
paving the way toward modular and autonomous robotic surgery.

Abstract: The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing
diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable
evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally
constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to
reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train
and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models
trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments.
As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify,
since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of
execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework
that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale
simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging
advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and
differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video
demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts.
Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated
VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from
crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup,
resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To
measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along
multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy
generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously
evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot
manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's
robotics landscape.

Conclusion: UrbanVLA框架成功解决了城市微移动导航的挑战，通过视觉-语言-动作对齐和两阶段训练实现了大规模城市环境下的可靠导航性能。

Abstract: Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable
navigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon
route instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic
and unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation
methods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective
urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills:
low-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and
high-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we
propose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework
designed for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy
route waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently
plans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels
of navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories
parsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on
a mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety
and adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA
surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban.
Furthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both
scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world
uncertainties.
