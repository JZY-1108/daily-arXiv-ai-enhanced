### [2] [Dialogic Social Learning for Artificial Agents: Enhancing LLM Ontology Acquisition through Mixed-Initiative Educational Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21065)
*Sabrina Patania,Luca Annese,Cansu Koyuturk,Azzurra Ruggeri,Dimitri Ognibene*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了通过社会中介学习范式提升大语言模型（LLM）在线知识获取能力，提出‘AI Social Gym’动态环境，通过对话式学习显著提升知识获取效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI训练范式依赖大数据集和稀疏反馈，限制了模型从交互中高效学习的能力，受维果茨基社会文化理论启发，研究探索社会中介学习的潜力。

Method: 引入‘AI Social Gym’环境，AI学习者与知识丰富的AI教师进行双向教学对话，重点研究不同教学策略对本体获取的影响。

Result: 混合方向互动（结合自上而下解释与学习者提问）显著提升LLM知识获取与应用能力，优于单向教学或直接访问结构化知识。

Conclusion: 将教学与心理学见解融入AI训练可大幅提升知识获取与响应质量，为现有策略（如提示工程）提供补充路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in
acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training
paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement
learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These
approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,
limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing
inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the
potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI
learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI
teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a
core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend
solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the
AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results
indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving
mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with
learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to
acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional
instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats
typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological
insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training
knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a
complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering

### [3] [Product vs. Process: Exploring EFL Students' Editing of AI-Generated Text for Expository Writing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21073)
*David James Woo,Yangyang Yu,Kai Guo,Yilin Huang,April Ka Yeng Fung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了EFL中学生如何编辑AI生成的文本，发现编辑行为对写作质量影响有限，AI支持但不替代写作技能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI聊天机器人生成的文本在EFL写作中应用增多，但其对学生写作过程和作文质量的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 39名香港中学生使用AI聊天机器人写作，通过屏幕录制和作文分析编辑行为和写作质量，采用定性编码、描述性统计等方法。

Result: 发现两种编辑模式，AI生成字数对评分有正面影响，但编辑变量影响较小。

Conclusion: AI支持写作但不替代技能，需结合文体指导和过程写作，评估应重视过程与成果。

Abstract: Text generated by artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots is increasingly used
in English as a foreign language (EFL) writing contexts, yet its impact on
students' expository writing process and compositions remains understudied.
This research examines how EFL secondary students edit AI-generated text.
Exploring editing behaviors in their expository writing process and in
expository compositions, and their effect on human-rated scores for content,
organization, language, and overall quality. Participants were 39 Hong Kong
secondary students who wrote an expository composition with AI chatbots in a
workshop. A convergent design was employed to analyze their screen recordings
and compositions to examine students' editing behaviors and writing qualities.
Analytical methods included qualitative coding, descriptive statistics,
temporal sequence analysis, human-rated scoring, and multiple linear regression
analysis. We analyzed over 260 edits per dataset, and identified two editing
patterns: one where students refined introductory units repeatedly before
progressing, and another where they quickly shifted to extensive edits in body
units (e.g., topic and supporting sentences). MLR analyses revealed that the
number of AI-generated words positively predicted all score dimensions, while
most editing variables showed minimal impact. These results suggest a
disconnect between students' significant editing effort and improved
composition quality, indicating AI supports but does not replace writing
skills. The findings highlight the importance of genre-specific instruction and
process-focused writing before AI integration. Educators should also develop
assessments valuing both process and product to encourage critical engagement
with AI text.

### [4] [Which symbol grounding problem should we try to solve?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21080)
*Vincent C. Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Floridi和Taddeo提出了一种解决接地问题的“零语义承诺”条件及其解决方案，但作者认为该条件无法实现，包括他们自己的方案。通过对比Luc Steels的建议，作者提出需要重新思考问题本质及系统中“目标”的作用。基于对计算的正确理解，作者认为唯一合理的接地问题是如何解释和重现人工计算代理中意义的行为能力和功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Floridi和Taddeo提出的接地问题解决方案的可行性，并重新定义接地问题的核心。

Method: 分析Floridi和Taddeo的条件及解决方案，对比Luc Steels的建议，提出对问题本质的重新思考。

Result: Floridi和Taddeo的条件无法实现，接地问题应聚焦于人工计算代理中意义的行为能力和功能。

Conclusion: 接地问题的核心在于解释和重现人工计算代理中意义的行为能力和功能，而非零语义承诺。

Abstract: Floridi and Taddeo propose a condition of "zero semantic commitment" for
solutions to the grounding problem, and a solution to it. I argue briefly that
their condition cannot be fulfilled, not even by their own solution. After a
look at Luc Steels' very different competing suggestion, I suggest that we need
to re-think what the problem is and what role the 'goals' in a system play in
formulating the problem. On the basis of a proper understanding of computing, I
come to the conclusion that the only sensible grounding problem is how we can
explain and re-produce the behavioral ability and function of meaning in
artificial computational agents

### [5] [ChatGPT Reads Your Tone and Responds Accordingly -- Until It Does Not -- Emotional Framing Induces Bias in LLM Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21083)
*Franck Bardol*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现GPT-4对情绪化问题的回答存在偏差，倾向于过度纠正负面情绪，转向中立或积极回应，尤其是在敏感话题上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（如GPT-4）如何根据问题的情绪化表述调整回答，揭示潜在的偏差。

Method: 通过系统性地改变156个提示的情绪语调（涵盖争议性和日常话题），分析模型回答的变化。

Result: GPT-4对负面问题的负面回答概率比中性问题低三倍，表现出“反弹”偏差；敏感话题上这种效应更明显。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了情绪化提示驱动的偏差，对AI对齐和信任有重要影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models like GPT-4 adjust their responses not only based on the
question asked, but also on how it is emotionally phrased. We systematically
vary the emotional tone of 156 prompts - spanning controversial and everyday
topics - and analyze how it affects model responses. Our findings show that
GPT-4 is three times less likely to respond negatively to a negatively framed
question than to a neutral one. This suggests a "rebound" bias where the model
overcorrects, often shifting toward neutrality or positivity. On sensitive
topics (e.g., justice or politics), this effect is even more pronounced:
tone-based variation is suppressed, suggesting an alignment override. We
introduce concepts like the "tone floor" - a lower bound in response negativity
- and use tone-valence transition matrices to quantify behavior. Visualizations
based on 1536-dimensional embeddings confirm semantic drift based on tone. Our
work highlights an underexplored class of biases driven by emotional framing in
prompts, with implications for AI alignment and trust. Code and data are

### [6] [Reviving Your MNEME: Predicting The Side Effects of LLM Unlearning and Fine-Tuning via Sparse Model Diffing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21084)
*Aly M. Kassem,Zhuan Shi,Negar Rostamzadeh,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MNEME框架通过稀疏模型差异分析检测LLMs微调或遗忘后的副作用，无需微调数据即可识别行为变化，准确率达95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法检测微调或遗忘后的副作用，如跨任务性能下降，需要一种通用方法解决这一问题。

Method: MNEME通过比较基础模型和微调模型在任务无关数据上的表现，使用稀疏模型差异分析识别行为变化。

Result: 在三种场景下，MNEME预测副作用的准确率高达95%，且无需自定义启发式方法。

Conclusion: 稀疏探测和差异分析为理解和管理LLM行为提供了可扩展且自动化的工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are frequently fine-tuned or unlearned to adapt
to new tasks or eliminate undesirable behaviors. While existing evaluation
methods assess performance after such interventions, there remains no general
approach for detecting unintended side effects, such as unlearning biology
content degrading performance on chemistry tasks, particularly when these
effects are unpredictable or emergent. To address this issue, we introduce
MNEME, Model diffiNg for Evaluating Mechanistic Effects, a lightweight
framework for identifying these side effects using sparse model diffing. MNEME
compares base and fine-tuned models on task-agnostic data (for example, The
Pile, LMSYS-Chat-1M) without access to fine-tuning data to isolate behavioral
shifts. Applied to five LLMs across three scenarios: WMDP knowledge unlearning,
emergent misalignment, and benign fine-tuning, MNEME achieves up to 95 percent
accuracy in predicting side effects, aligning with known benchmarks and
requiring no custom heuristics. Furthermore, we show that retraining on
high-activation samples can partially reverse these effects. Our results
demonstrate that sparse probing and diffing offer a scalable and automated lens
into fine-tuning-induced model changes, providing practical tools for
understanding and managing LLM behavior.

### [7] [Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding for Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21086)
*Jaydip Sen,Subhasis Dasgupta,Hetvi Waghela*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MACD通过多业余模型集成改进对比解码，提升文本生成的多样性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比解码依赖单一业余模型，无法全面捕捉语言生成的多样化失败模式。

Method: 提出MACD，集成多个业余模型，通过平均和共识惩罚机制整合对比信号，并扩展合理性约束。

Result: 实验表明MACD在流畅性、连贯性、多样性和适应性上优于传统解码方法和原始CD。

Conclusion: MACD无需额外训练即可显著提升生成质量，适用于多种领域。

Abstract: Contrastive Decoding (CD) has emerged as an effective inference-time strategy
for enhancing open-ended text generation by exploiting the divergence in output
probabilities between a large expert language model and a smaller amateur
model. Although CD improves coherence and fluency, its dependence on a single
amateur restricts its capacity to capture the diverse and multifaceted failure
modes of language generation, such as repetition, hallucination, and stylistic
drift. This paper proposes Multi-Amateur Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a
generalization of the CD framework that employs an ensemble of amateur models
to more comprehensively characterize undesirable generation patterns. MACD
integrates contrastive signals through both averaging and consensus
penalization mechanisms and extends the plausibility constraint to operate
effectively in the multi-amateur setting. Furthermore, the framework enables
controllable generation by incorporating amateurs with targeted stylistic or
content biases. Experimental results across multiple domains, such as news,
encyclopedic, and narrative, demonstrate that MACD consistently surpasses
conventional decoding methods and the original CD approach in terms of fluency,
coherence, diversity, and adaptability, all without requiring additional
training or fine-tuning.

### [8] [QU-NLP at CheckThat! 2025: Multilingual Subjectivity in News Articles Detection using Feature-Augmented Transformer Models with Sequential Cross-Lingual Fine-Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21095)
*Mohammad AL-Smadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合预训练语言模型与统计和语言特征的特征增强Transformer架构，用于检测新闻句子中的主观性，并在多语言和零样本设置中取得了竞争性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CheckThat! 2025任务1中的主观性检测问题，即区分新闻句子是表达作者主观观点还是客观陈述。

Method: 使用特征增强的Transformer架构，结合预训练语言模型（如AraELECTRA和DeBERTa~V3）与TF-IDF和词性标签等特征，并通过门控机制整合。

Result: 在多种语言（英语、阿拉伯语、德语、意大利语等）的单语、多语和零样本设置中表现优异，尤其在英语和罗马尼亚语的零样本设置中排名第一。

Conclusion: 结合TF-IDF特征与门控机制以及跨语言迁移对主观性检测至关重要，模型对跨语言微调顺序和训练语言的语言接近性敏感。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the CheckThat! 2025 Task 1 on
subjectivity detection, where systems are challenged to distinguish whether a
sentence from a news article expresses the subjective view of the author or
presents an objective view on the covered topic. We propose a feature-augmented
transformer architecture that combines contextual embeddings from pre-trained
language models with statistical and linguistic features. Our system leveraged
pre-trained transformers with additional lexical features: for Arabic we used
AraELECTRA augmented with part-of-speech (POS) tags and TF-IDF features, while
for the other languages we fine-tuned a cross-lingual DeBERTa~V3 model combined
with TF-IDF features through a gating mechanism. We evaluated our system in
monolingual, multilingual, and zero-shot settings across multiple languages
including English, Arabic, German, Italian, and several unseen languages. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving competitive
performance across different languages with notable success in the monolingual
setting for English (rank 1st with macro-F1=0.8052), German (rank 3rd with
macro-F1=0.8013), Arabic (rank 4th with macro-F1=0.5771), and Romanian (rank
1st with macro-F1=0.8126) in the zero-shot setting. We also conducted an
ablation analysis that demonstrated the importance of combining TF-IDF features
with the gating mechanism and the cross-lingual transfer for subjectivity
detection. Furthermore, our analysis reveals the model's sensitivity to both
the order of cross-lingual fine-tuning and the linguistic proximity of the
training languages.

*Chloe Ho,Ishneet Sukhvinder Singh,Diya Sharma,Tanvi Reddy Anumandla,Michael Lu,Vasu Sharma,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过LLM重写广告内容来提升其在检索系统中的排名和生成响应中的可见性，提出了一种结合语义相关性和内容保真度的监督微调框架，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索广告内容表述对广告可见性的影响，尤其是在LLM集成检索系统中，如何通过优化广告表述提升其排名和生成响应中的出现频率。

Method: 提出了一种监督微调框架，结合自定义损失函数平衡语义相关性和内容保真度，并引入DeltaMRR@K和DeltaDIR@K两个指标评估效果。

Result: 实验表明，基于PPO训练的模型在多数情况下优于提示工程和监督微调，最高提升2.79 DeltaDIR@5和0.0073 DeltaMRR@5。

Conclusion: 广告内容的表述方式、提示格式和强化学习在LLM集成检索系统中对广告重写的有效性至关重要。

Abstract: Search algorithms and user query relevance have given LLMs the ability to
return relevant information, but the effect of content phrasing on ad
visibility remains underexplored. We investigate how LLM-based rewriting of
advertisements can improve their ranking in retrieval systems and inclusion in
generated LLM responses, without modifying the retrieval model itself. We
introduce a supervised fine-tuning framework with a custom loss balancing
semantic relevance and content fidelity. To evaluate effectiveness, we propose
two metrics: DeltaMRR@K (ranking improvement) and DeltaDIR@K (inclusion
frequency improvement). Our approach presents a scalable method to optimize ad
phrasing, enhancing visibility in retrieval-based LLM workflows. Experiments
across both instruction-based and few-shot prompting demonstrate that PPO
trained models outperform both prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning in
most cases, achieving up to a 2.79 DeltaDIR@5 and 0.0073 DeltaMRR@5 in
instruction-based prompting. These results highlight the importance of how the
ad is written before retrieval and prompt format and reinforcement learning in
effective ad rewriting for LLM integrated retrieval systems.

### [11] [Creation of a Numerical Scoring System to Objectively Measure and Compare the Level of Rhetoric in Arabic Texts: A Feasibility Study, and A Working Prototype](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21106)
*Mandar Marathe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究旨在开发一种客观测量阿拉伯语修辞密度的方法，通过分析文本中的文学手法数量来实现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语修辞学历史悠久且重要，但缺乏客观评估其使用的方法，无法比较不同文本、作者或时代的修辞密度。

Method: 研究编制了84种常见文学手法的清单，构建了识别系统，并基于词素计数计算修辞密度，开发了电子和模拟工具。

Result: 成功开发了一套工具，能够准确报告任何阿拉伯语文本或演讲中的修辞密度及其分布。

Conclusion: 该工具填补了阿拉伯语修辞学研究的空白，为客观分析和比较修辞使用提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Arabic Rhetoric is the field of Arabic linguistics which governs the art and
science of conveying a message with greater beauty, impact and persuasiveness.
The field is as ancient as the Arabic language itself and is found extensively
in classical and contemporary Arabic poetry, free verse and prose. In practical
terms, it is the intelligent use of word order, figurative speech and
linguistic embellishments to enhance message delivery. Despite the volumes that
have been written about it and the high status accorded to it, there is no way
to objectively know whether a speaker or writer has used Arabic rhetoric in a
given text, to what extent, and why. There is no objective way to compare the
use of Arabic rhetoric across genres, authors or epochs. It is impossible to
know which of pre-Islamic poetry, Andalucian Arabic poetry, or modern literary
genres are richer in Arabic rhetoric. The aim of the current study was to
devise a way to measure the density of the literary devices which constitute
Arabic rhetoric in a given text, as a proxy marker for Arabic rhetoric itself.
A comprehensive list of 84 of the commonest literary devices and their
definitions was compiled. A system of identifying literary devices in texts was
constructed. A method of calculating the density of literary devices based on
the morpheme count of the text was utilised. Four electronic tools and an
analogue tool were created to support the calculation of an Arabic text's
rhetorical literary device density, including a website and online calculator.
Additionally, a technique of reporting the distribution of literary devices
used across the three sub-domains of Arabic rhetoric was created. The output of
this project is a working tool which can accurately report the density of
Arabic rhetoric in any Arabic text or speech.

### [12] [Curved Inference: Concern-Sensitive Geometry in Large Language Model Residual Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21107)
*Rob Manson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“弯曲推理”的几何可解释性框架，用于分析大型语言模型在语义关注变化下的残差流轨迹。通过20个匹配提示，分析了Gemma3-1b和LLaMA3.2-3b模型，发现关注强度变化会显著影响内部激活轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型在语义关注变化下的几何行为，揭示其内部激活轨迹的动态变化，以更好地理解模型的语义抽象和对齐机制。

Method: 使用五种原生空间度量（主要关注曲率和显著性），在解嵌入矩阵导出的语义度量下计算，确保测量反映令牌对齐的几何结构。

Result: LLaMA模型在关注强度增加时表现出显著的曲率和显著性变化，而Gemma对关注变化的响应较弱。研究支持了LLM几何的两层视图：潜在概念结构和上下文轨迹。

Conclusion: 弯曲推理为诊断模型对齐、抽象和推理动态提供了新方法，揭示了模型在深度上如何导航、调整或强化语义意义。

Abstract: We propose Curved Inference - a geometric Interpretability framework that
tracks how the residual stream trajectory of a large language model bends in
response to shifts in semantic concern. Across 20 matched prompts spanning
emotional, moral, perspective, logical, identity, environmental, and nonsense
domains, we analyse Gemma3-1b and LLaMA3.2-3b using five native-space metrics,
with a primary focus on curvature (\k{appa}_i) and salience (S(t)). These
metrics are computed under a pullback semantic metric derived from the
unembedding matrix, ensuring that all measurements reflect token-aligned
geometry rather than raw coordinate structure. We find that concern-shifted
prompts reliably alter internal activation trajectories in both models - with
LLaMA exhibiting consistent, statistically significant scaling in both
curvature and salience as concern intensity increases. Gemma also responds to
concern but shows weaker differentiation between moderate and strong variants.
Our results support a two-layer view of LLM geometry - a latent conceptual
structure encoded in the embedding space, and a contextual trajectory shaped by
prompt-specific inference. Curved Inference reveals how models navigate,
reorient, or reinforce semantic meaning over depth, offering a principled
method for diagnosing alignment, abstraction, and emergent inference dynamics.
These findings offer fresh insight into semantic abstraction and model
alignment through the lens of Curved Inference.

Conclusion: 该论文为法律NLP研究和实践提供了全面支持，旨在改进法律流程、提升法律信息可访问性，并推动更公平的社会。

Abstract: Given the large size and volumes of contracts and their underlying inherent
complexity, manual reviews become inefficient and prone to errors, creating a
clear need for automation. Automatic Legal Contract Classification (LCC)
revolutionizes the way legal contracts are analyzed, offering substantial
improvements in speed, accuracy, and accessibility. This survey delves into the
challenges of automatic LCC and a detailed examination of key tasks, datasets,
and methodologies. We identify seven classification tasks within LCC, and
review fourteen datasets related to English-language contracts, including
public, proprietary, and non-public sources. We also introduce a methodology
taxonomy for LCC, categorized into Traditional Machine Learning, Deep Learning,
and Transformer-based approaches. Additionally, the survey discusses evaluation
techniques and highlights the best-performing results from the reviewed
studies. By providing a thorough overview of current methods and their
limitations, this survey suggests future research directions to improve the
efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of LCC. As the first comprehensive survey
on LCC, it aims to support legal NLP researchers and practitioners in improving
legal processes, making legal information more accessible, and promoting a more
informed and equitable society.

*Kezhen Zhong,Basem Suleiman,Abdelkarim Erradi,Shijing Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SemRAG是一种改进的RAG框架，通过语义分块和知识图谱高效整合领域知识，无需大量微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在整合领域知识时计算成本高、易过拟合且扩展性差，SemRAG旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 使用语义分块算法基于句子嵌入的余弦相似度分割文档，并通过知识图谱结构化检索信息。

Result: 实验表明SemRAG显著提升检索信息的相关性和准确性，优于传统RAG方法。

Conclusion: SemRAG提供了一种高效、准确的领域特定LLM解决方案，具有实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper introduces SemRAG, an enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation
(RAG) framework that efficiently integrates domain-specific knowledge using
semantic chunking and knowledge graphs without extensive fine-tuning.
Integrating domain-specific knowledge into large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for improving their performance in specialized tasks. Yet, existing
adaptations are computationally expensive, prone to overfitting and limit
scalability. To address these challenges, SemRAG employs a semantic chunking
algorithm that segments documents based on the cosine similarity from sentence
embeddings, preserving semantic coherence while reducing computational
overhead. Additionally, by structuring retrieved information into knowledge
graphs, SemRAG captures relationships between entities, improving retrieval
accuracy and contextual understanding. Experimental results on MultiHop RAG and
Wikipedia datasets demonstrate SemRAG has significantly enhances the relevance
and correctness of retrieved information from the Knowledge Graph,
outperforming traditional RAG methods. Furthermore, we investigate the
optimization of buffer sizes for different data corpus, as optimizing buffer
sizes tailored to specific datasets can further improve retrieval performance,
as integration of knowledge graphs strengthens entity relationships for better
contextual comprehension. The primary advantage of SemRAG is its ability to
create an efficient, accurate domain-specific LLM pipeline while avoiding
resource-intensive fine-tuning. This makes it a practical and scalable approach
aligned with sustainability goals, offering a viable solution for AI
applications in domain-specific fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着InsurTech的快速发展，传统保险公司需要利用替代数据源和先进技术保持竞争力。

Method: 通过实际案例研究，应用多种NLP技术处理InsurTech合作伙伴提供的替代数据，将其转化为结构化数据。

Result: NLP不仅补充了传统商业保险定价的评级因素，还通过新颖的行业分类提供了风险评估的新视角。

Conclusion: NLP是现代数据驱动保险分析的基础工具，而不仅仅是辅助手段。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of InsurTech, traditional insurance companies are
increasingly exploring alternative data sources and advanced technologies to
sustain their competitive edge. This paper provides both a conceptual overview
and practical case studies of natural language processing (NLP) and its
emerging applications within insurance operations with a focus on transforming
raw, unstructured text into structured data suitable for actuarial analysis and
decision-making. Leveraging real-world alternative data provided by an
InsurTech industry partner that enriches traditional insurance data sources, we
apply various NLP techniques to demonstrate practical use cases in the
commercial insurance context. These enriched, text-derived insights not only
add to and refine traditional rating factors for commercial insurance pricing
but also offer novel perspectives for assessing underlying risk by introducing
novel industry classifications. Through these demonstrations, we show that NLP
is not merely a supplementary tool but a foundational element for modern,
data-driven insurance analytics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了Trident-Bench基准，用于评估大语言模型在法律、金融和医疗领域的领域特定安全性，填补了现有研究在领域安全风险评估上的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在高风险领域的广泛应用，系统评估其领域安全性变得至关重要，而现有研究多关注性能提升，忽视了安全风险。

Method: 基于专业伦理准则定义领域安全原则，并开发Trident-Bench基准，评估19个通用和领域专用模型的安全性。

Result: 通用模型（如GPT、Gemini）满足基本安全要求，而领域专用模型在细微伦理问题上表现不佳，凸显领域安全改进的迫切性。

Conclusion: Trident-Bench为法律和金融领域的LLM安全性研究提供了系统资源，为未来减少LLM在专业领域的安全风险奠定了基础。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk
domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their
domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has
largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often
neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,
we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA
Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and
the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,
financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and
domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals
key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic
expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle
ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained
domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work
provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law
and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the
safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and
benchmark will be released at: https://github.com/zackhuiiiii/TRIDENT

Conclusion: Inworld TTS-1系列模型在质量和效率上均达到先进水平，适用于多种应用场景，并开源代码。

Abstract: We introduce Inworld TTS-1, a set of two Transformer-based autoregressive
text-to-speech (TTS) models. Our largest model, TTS-1-Max, has 8.8B parameters
and is designed for utmost quality and expressiveness in demanding
applications. TTS-1 is our most efficient model, with 1.6B parameters, built
for real-time speech synthesis and on-device use cases. By scaling train-time
compute and applying a sequential process of pre-training, fine-tuning, and
RL-alignment of the speech-language model (SpeechLM) component, both models
achieve state-of-the-art performance on a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating
exceptional quality relying purely on in-context learning of the speaker's
voice. Inworld TTS-1 and TTS-1-Max can generate high-resolution 48 kHz speech
with low latency, and support 11 languages with fine-grained emotional control
and non-verbal vocalizations through audio markups. We additionally open-source
our training and modeling code under an MIT license.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何有效利用多样性提升LLMs在二元问题中的表现。

Method: 比较模型多样性和问题解释多样性，采用多数投票作为集成共识策略。

Result: 问题解释多样性在boolq、strategyqa和pubmedqa上表现更优，模型多样性效果介于最佳和最差成员之间。

Conclusion: 问题解释多样性是更有效的多样性利用方式。

Abstract: Effectively leveraging diversity has been shown to improve performance for
various machine learning models, including large language models (LLMs).
However, determining the most effective way of using diversity remains a
challenge. In this work, we compare two diversity approaches for answering
binary questions using LLMs: model diversity, which relies on multiple models
answering the same question, and question interpretation diversity, which
relies on using the same model to answer the same question framed in different
ways. For both cases, we apply majority voting as the ensemble consensus
heuristic to determine the final answer. Our experiments on boolq, strategyqa,
and pubmedqa show that question interpretation diversity consistently leads to
better ensemble accuracy compared to model diversity. Furthermore, our analysis
of GPT and LLaMa shows that model diversity typically produces results between
the best and the worst ensemble members without clear improvement.

TL;DR: 论文提出Contrast-CAT方法，通过对比激活过滤无关特征，提升Transformer分类模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的决策解释性不足，影响其在实际应用中的可信度和安全性。现有基于激活的归因方法易受无关特征干扰。

Method: 提出Contrast-CAT方法，通过对比输入序列与参考序列的激活，过滤无关特征，生成更清晰的归因图。

Result: 实验表明，Contrast-CAT在多个数据集和模型上表现优于现有方法，AOPC和LOdds指标分别平均提升1.30倍和2.25倍。

Conclusion: Contrast-CAT显著提升了Transformer文本分类模型的可解释性，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解释工具。

Abstract: Transformers have profoundly influenced AI research, but explaining their
decisions remains challenging -- even for relatively simpler tasks such as
classification -- which hinders trust and safe deployment in real-world
applications. Although activation-based attribution methods effectively explain
transformer-based text classification models, our findings reveal that these
methods can be undermined by class-irrelevant features within activations,
leading to less reliable interpretations. To address this limitation, we
propose Contrast-CAT, a novel activation contrast-based attribution method that
refines token-level attributions by filtering out class-irrelevant features. By
contrasting the activations of an input sequence with reference activations,
Contrast-CAT generates clearer and more faithful attribution maps. Experimental
results across various datasets and models confirm that Contrast-CAT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, under the MoRF
setting, it achieves average improvements of x1.30 in AOPC and x2.25 in LOdds
over the most competing methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
interpretability for transformer-based text classification.

Motivation: 社交媒体成为公众表达犯罪事件观点的重要平台，动态变化的公众情绪对政策制定和犯罪预防具有潜在价值。

Method: 构建包含28,528条孟加拉语评论的数据集，提出基于XLM-RoBERTa Base的Transformer模型进行分类。

Result: 模型分类准确率达97%，优于现有方法，并通过可解释AI技术识别关键特征。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在处理低资源语言（如孟加拉语）时表现优异，为公共政策制定提供支持。

Abstract: In recent years, social media platforms have become prominent spaces for
individuals to express their opinions on ongoing events, including criminal
incidents. As a result, public sentiment can shift dynamically over time. This
study investigates the evolving public perception of crime-related news by
classifying user-generated comments into three categories: positive, negative,
and neutral. A newly curated dataset comprising 28,528 Bangla-language social
media comments was developed for this purpose. We propose a transformer-based
model utilizing the XLM-RoBERTa Base architecture, which achieves a
classification accuracy of 97%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods
in Bangla sentiment analysis. To enhance model interpretability, explainable AI
technique is employed to identify the most influential features driving
sentiment classification. The results underscore the effectiveness of
transformer-based models in processing low-resource languages such as Bengali
and demonstrate their potential to extract actionable insights that can support
public policy formulation and crime prevention strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏针对孟加拉语的低资源语言处理工具，导致超党派新闻难以检测，影响社会舆论。

Method: 通过微调Bangla BERT模型，结合半监督学习和LIME解释工具，提升分类准确性和透明度。

Result: Bangla BERT在试验数据中表现优异，准确率达95.65%，优于传统机器学习方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在资源有限的环境中，Transformer模型也能有效提升超党派新闻检测能力，为未来研究奠定基础。

Abstract: In the current digital landscape, misinformation circulates rapidly, shaping
public perception and causing societal divisions. It is difficult to identify
hyperpartisan news in Bangla since there aren't many sophisticated natural
language processing methods available for this low-resource language. Without
effective detection methods, biased content can spread unchecked, posing
serious risks to informed discourse. To address this gap, our research
fine-tunes Bangla BERT. This is a state-of-the-art transformer-based model,
designed to enhance classification accuracy for hyperpartisan news. We evaluate
its performance against traditional machine learning models and implement
semi-supervised learning to enhance predictions further. Not only that, we use
LIME to provide transparent explanations of the model's decision-making
process, which helps to build trust in its outcomes. With a remarkable accuracy
score of 95.65%, Bangla BERT outperforms conventional approaches, according to
our trial data. The findings of this study demonstrate the usefulness of
transformer models even in environments with limited resources, which opens the
door to further improvements in this area.

### [22] [Can human clinical rationales improve the performance and explainability of clinical text classification models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21302)
*Christoph Metzner,Shang Gao,Drahomira Herrmannova,Heidi A. Hanson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于人类临床解释（rationales）作为额外监督是否能提升基于Transformer的临床文本分类模型的性能和可解释性。结果表明，在高资源场景下，rationales能提升性能，但在资源有限时效果不一致。使用rationales训练的模型性能不如直接使用更多报告训练的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类临床解释是否能作为额外监督，提升临床文本分类模型的性能和可解释性。

Method: 分析了99,125条人类临床解释和128,649份电子病理报告，评估了基于Transformer的模型在提取原发癌症部位时的表现，并研究了用充分性（sufficiency）作为衡量rationale质量的方法。

Result: 在高资源场景下，rationales能提升模型性能，但效果不稳定；使用rationales训练的模型性能不如直接使用更多报告训练的模型。

Conclusion: 若目标是优化准确性，应优先标注更多报告而非生成rationales；若目标是可解释性，rationales可能有助于模型识别类似解释的特征，但效果有限。

Abstract: AI-driven clinical text classification is vital for explainable automated
retrieval of population-level health information. This work investigates
whether human-based clinical rationales can serve as additional supervision to
improve both performance and explainability of transformer-based models that
automatically encode clinical documents. We analyzed 99,125 human-based
clinical rationales that provide plausible explanations for primary cancer site
diagnoses, using them as additional training samples alongside 128,649
electronic pathology reports to evaluate transformer-based models for
extracting primary cancer sites. We also investigated sufficiency as a way to
measure rationale quality for pre-selecting rationales. Our results showed that
clinical rationales as additional training data can improve model performance
in high-resource scenarios but produce inconsistent behavior when resources are
limited. Using sufficiency as an automatic metric to preselect rationales also
leads to inconsistent results. Importantly, models trained on rationales were
consistently outperformed by models trained on additional reports instead. This
suggests that clinical rationales don't consistently improve model performance
and are outperformed by simply using more reports. Therefore, if the goal is
optimizing accuracy, annotation efforts should focus on labeling more reports
rather than creating rationales. However, if explainability is the priority,
training models on rationale-supplemented data may help them better identify
rationale-like features. We conclude that using clinical rationales as
additional training data results in smaller performance improvements and only
slightly better explainability (measured as average token-level rationale
coverage) compared to training on additional reports.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现当前大型语言模型（LLMs）在捕捉跨文化道德差异方面存在不足，倾向于压缩差异且与实证调查数据对齐度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs是否能够准确反映跨文化道德视角的差异与相似性，以解决其训练数据中可能存在的偏见问题。

Method: 采用三种互补方法：比较模型与调查数据的道德分数方差、进行聚类对齐分析、直接通过系统性选择的词对提示模型。

Result: 当前LLMs未能完全再现跨文化道德差异，且与实证调查模式对齐度较低。

Conclusion: 需开发更稳健的方法以减少偏见并提升LLMs的文化代表性，强调公平与伦理对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have established them as
powerful tools across numerous domains. However, persistent concerns about
embedded biases, such as gender, racial, and cultural biases arising from their
training data, raise significant questions about the ethical use and societal
consequences of these technologies. This study investigates the extent to which
LLMs capture cross-cultural differences and similarities in moral perspectives.
Specifically, we examine whether LLM outputs align with patterns observed in
international survey data on moral attitudes. To this end, we employ three
complementary methods: (1) comparing variances in moral scores produced by
models versus those reported in surveys, (2) conducting cluster alignment
analyses to assess correspondence between country groupings derived from LLM
outputs and survey data, and (3) directly probing models with comparative
prompts using systematically chosen token pairs. Our results reveal that
current LLMs often fail to reproduce the full spectrum of cross-cultural moral
variation, tending to compress differences and exhibit low alignment with
empirical survey patterns. These findings highlight a pressing need for more
robust approaches to mitigate biases and improve cultural representativeness in
LLMs. We conclude by discussing the implications for the responsible
development and global deployment of LLMs, emphasizing fairness and ethical
alignment.

Motivation: Shona语作为一种低资源语言，缺乏标注数据和复杂的音调特征，传统统计模型识别效果不佳，因此探索深度学习提升ASR系统的准确性。

Method: 采用混合架构（CNN用于声学建模，LSTM用于语言建模），结合数据增强、迁移学习和注意力机制，解决数据稀缺和音调问题。

Result: 系统表现优异，词错误率29%，音素错误率12%，整体准确率74%，优于传统统计模型。

Conclusion: 深度学习显著提升了Shona语ASR系统的性能，为低资源语言的语音识别提供了可行方案，促进了Shona语使用者的沟通便利。

Abstract: This study presented the development of a deep learning-based Automatic
Speech Recognition system for Shona, a low-resource language characterized by
unique tonal and grammatical complexities. The research aimed to address the
challenges posed by limited training data, lack of labelled data, and the
intricate tonal nuances present in Shona speech, with the objective of
achieving significant improvements in recognition accuracy compared to
traditional statistical models. The research first explored the feasibility of
using deep learning to develop an accurate ASR system for Shona. Second, it
investigated the specific challenges involved in designing and implementing
deep learning architectures for Shona speech recognition and proposed
strategies to mitigate these challenges. Lastly, it compared the performance of
the deep learning-based model with existing statistical models in terms of
accuracy. The developed ASR system utilized a hybrid architecture consisting of
a Convolutional Neural Network for acoustic modelling and a Long Short-Term
Memory network for language modelling. To overcome the scarcity of data, data
augmentation techniques and transfer learning were employed. Attention
mechanisms were also incorporated to accommodate the tonal nature of Shona
speech. The resulting ASR system achieved impressive results, with a Word Error
Rate of 29%, Phoneme Error Rate of 12%, and an overall accuracy of 74%. These
metrics indicated the potential of deep learning to enhance ASR accuracy for
under-resourced languages like Shona. This study contributed to the advancement
of ASR technology for under-resourced languages like Shona, ultimately
fostering improved accessibility and communication for Shona speakers
worldwide.

Motivation: 当前缺乏评估大语言模型（LLMs）在特定领域或组织文档中提取质量的基准，手动标注成本高且难以扩展。

Method: StructText采用两阶段“计划-执行”流程，利用表格数据生成合成文本，并通过LLM评估和客观指标验证对齐性。

Result: 在71,539个示例中，LLMs在事实准确性上表现良好，但在叙事连贯性和自动化提取方面存在挑战。

Conclusion: StructText为键值提取研究提供了框架、数据集和工具，支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Extracting structured information from text, such as key-value pairs that
could augment tabular data, is quite useful in many enterprise use cases.
Although large language models (LLMs) have enabled numerous automated pipelines
for converting natural language into structured formats, there is still a lack
of benchmarks for evaluating their extraction quality, especially in specific
domains or focused documents specific to a given organization. Building such
benchmarks by manual annotations is labour-intensive and limits the size and
scalability of the benchmarks. In this work, we present StructText, an
end-to-end framework for automatically generating high-fidelity benchmarks for
key-value extraction from text using existing tabular data. It uses available
tabular data as structured ground truth, and follows a two-stage
``plan-then-execute'' pipeline to synthetically generate corresponding
natural-language text. To ensure alignment between text and structured source,
we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy that combines (a)
LLM-based judgments on factuality, hallucination, and coherence and (b)
objective extraction metrics measuring numeric and temporal accuracy. We
evaluated the proposed method on 71,539 examples across 49 datasets. Results
reveal that while LLMs achieve strong factual accuracy and avoid hallucination,
they struggle with narrative coherence in producing extractable text. Notably,
models presume numerical and temporal information with high fidelity yet this
information becomes embedded in narratives that resist automated extraction. We
release a framework, including datasets, evaluation tools, and baseline
extraction systems, to support continued research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的网页历史压缩方法，通过压缩历史状态中的任务相关信息，提升网页自动化效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网页自动化方法忽略了历史状态的重要性，且网页状态信息冗长导致输入序列过长和信息稀疏，影响历史状态的有效利用。

Method: 采用历史压缩模块，将每个历史状态中最相关的任务信息压缩为固定长度的短表示。

Result: 在Mind2Web和WebLINX数据集上的实验表明，该方法比无历史输入的基线方法准确率提高了1.2-5.4%。

Conclusion: 通过压缩历史状态信息，显著提升了网页自动化的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Language models have led to a leap forward in web automation. The current web
automation approaches take the current web state, history actions, and language
instruction as inputs to predict the next action, overlooking the importance of
history states. However, the highly verbose nature of web page states can
result in long input sequences and sparse information, hampering the effective
utilization of history states. In this paper, we propose a novel web history
compressor approach to turbocharge web automation using history states. Our
approach employs a history compressor module that distills the most
task-relevant information from each history state into a fixed-length short
representation, mitigating the challenges posed by the highly verbose history
states. Experiments are conducted on the Mind2Web and WebLINX datasets to
evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Results show that our approach
obtains 1.2-5.4% absolute accuracy improvements compared to the baseline
approach without history inputs.

TL;DR: MemTool是一个短期记忆框架，帮助LLM代理在多轮对话中动态管理工具或MCP服务器上下文，提供三种模式（自主代理、工作流和混合模式），并在实验中展示了不同模式的效率和任务完成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定上下文窗口限制了LLM代理在多轮交互中的有效性，需要一种动态管理工具或MCP服务器上下文的方法。

Method: 提出MemTool框架，包含三种模式：自主代理模式（完全自主管理工具）、工作流模式（确定性控制）和混合模式（结合两者）。

Result: 自主代理模式在大型LLM中工具移除效率高（90-94%），而中型模型效率低（0-60%）。工作流和混合模式在工具移除上表现稳定，自主和混合模式在任务完成上更优。

Conclusion: MemTool为不同任务需求提供了灵活的模式选择，需根据任务准确性、代理能力和模型性能权衡选择。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents have shown significant autonomous
capabilities in dynamically searching and incorporating relevant tools or Model
Context Protocol (MCP) servers for individual queries. However, fixed context
windows limit effectiveness in multi-turn interactions requiring repeated,
independent tool usage. We introduce MemTool, a short-term memory framework
enabling LLM agents to dynamically manage tools or MCP server contexts across
multi-turn conversations. MemTool offers three agentic architectures: 1)
Autonomous Agent Mode, granting full tool management autonomy, 2) Workflow
Mode, providing deterministic control without autonomy, and 3) Hybrid Mode,
combining autonomous and deterministic control. Evaluating each MemTool mode
across 13+ LLMs on the ScaleMCP benchmark, we conducted experiments over 100
consecutive user interactions, measuring tool removal ratios (short-term memory
efficiency) and task completion accuracy. In Autonomous Agent Mode, reasoning
LLMs achieve high tool-removal efficiency (90-94% over a 3-window average),
while medium-sized models exhibit significantly lower efficiency (0-60%).
Workflow and Hybrid modes consistently manage tool removal effectively, whereas
Autonomous and Hybrid modes excel at task completion. We present trade-offs and
recommendations for each MemTool mode based on task accuracy, agency, and model
capabilities.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过微调通用LLM可以开发出兼具高预测准确性和解释性的专业工具，为交通研究和政策制定提供了新途径。

Abstract: This study investigates the adoption of open-access, locally deployable
causal large language models (LLMs) for travel mode choice prediction and
introduces LiTransMC, the first fine-tuned causal LLM developed for this task.
We systematically benchmark eleven LLMs (1-12B parameters) across three stated
and revealed preference datasets, testing 396 configurations and generating
over 79,000 synthetic commuter predictions. Beyond predictive accuracy, we
evaluate models generated reasoning using BERTopic for topic modelling and a
novel Explanation Strength Index, providing the first structured analysis of
how LLMs articulate decision factors in alignment with behavioural theory.
LiTransMC, fine-tuned using parameter efficient and loss masking strategy,
achieved a weighted F1 score of 0.6845 and a Jensen-Shannon Divergence of
0.000245, surpassing both untuned local models and larger proprietary systems,
including GPT-4o with advanced persona inference and embedding-based loading,
while also outperforming classical mode choice methods such as discrete choice
models and machine learning classifiers for the same dataset. This dual
improvement, i.e., high instant-level accuracy and near-perfect distributional
calibration, demonstrates the feasibility of creating specialist, locally
deployable LLMs that integrate prediction and interpretability. Through
combining structured behavioural prediction with natural language reasoning,
this work unlocks the potential for conversational, multi-task transport models
capable of supporting agent-based simulations, policy testing, and behavioural
insight generation. These findings establish a pathway for transforming general
purpose LLMs into specialized, explainable tools for transportation research
and policy formulation, while maintaining privacy, reducing cost, and
broadening access through local deployment.

Result: 测试发现：(1) LLMs在STEM推理上的进步能有效转移到幽默理解；(2) 仅基于STEM数据训练的模型在HumorBench上表现良好；(3) 增加推理令牌预算对幽默推理的效果因模型而异。

Conclusion: HumorBench为评估LLMs在非STEM领域的推理能力提供了新视角，展示了推理能力的可转移性，但幽默理解仍需进一步优化。

Abstract: We present HumorBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate large language
models' (LLMs) ability to reason about and explain sophisticated humor in
cartoon captions. As reasoning models increasingly saturate existing benchmarks
in mathematics and science, novel and challenging evaluations of model
intelligence beyond STEM domains are essential. Reasoning is fundamentally
involved in text-based humor comprehension, requiring the identification of
connections between concepts in cartoons/captions and external cultural
references, wordplays, and other mechanisms. HumorBench includes approximately
300 unique cartoon-caption pairs from the New Yorker Caption Contest and
Cartoonstock.com, with expert-annotated evaluation rubrics identifying
essential joke elements. LLMs are evaluated based on their explanations towards
the humor and abilities in identifying the joke elements. To perform well on
this task, models must form and test hypotheses about associations between
concepts, potentially backtracking from initial interpretations to arrive at
the most plausible explanation. Our extensive benchmarking of current SOTA
models reveals three key insights: (1) LLM progress on STEM reasoning transfers
effectively to humor comprehension; (2) models trained exclusively on STEM
reasoning data still perform well on HumorBench, demonstrating strong
transferability of reasoning abilities; and (3) test-time scaling by increasing
thinking token budgets yields mixed results across different models in humor
reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于任务多样性的数据选择方法，用于高效标注的监督微调（SFT），通过逆置信度加权策略选择样本，显著减少标注成本并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在专业应用中需要大量人工标注的问题，提出一种更高效的标注策略。

Method: 利用任务多样性而非提示多样性，结合任务标签的可用性和预训练模型在不同任务上的置信度差异，设计逆置信度加权采样策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在减少80%标注成本的同时，性能优于或等同于现有最佳方法，MMLU分数提升4%。

Conclusion: 任务多样性驱动的数据选择策略是一种简单高效的方法，可显著降低标注成本并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, but developing high-performing models for specialized
applications often requires substantial human annotation -- a process that is
time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. In this paper, we address the
label-efficient learning problem for supervised finetuning (SFT) by leveraging
task-diversity as a fundamental principle for effective data selection. This is
markedly different from existing methods based on the prompt-diversity. Our
approach is based on two key observations: 1) task labels for different prompts
are often readily available; 2) pre-trained models have significantly varying
levels of confidence across tasks. We combine these facts to devise a simple
yet effective sampling strategy: we select examples across tasks using an
inverse confidence weighting strategy. This produces models comparable to or
better than those trained with more complex sampling procedures, while being
significantly easier to implement and less computationally intensive. Notably,
our experimental results demonstrate that this method can achieve better
accuracy than training on the complete dataset (a 4\% increase in MMLU score).
Across various annotation budgets and two instruction finetuning datasets, our
algorithm consistently performs at or above the level of the best existing
methods, while reducing annotation costs by up to 80\%.

TL;DR: 越南因互联网流量和在线毒性问题突出，急需嵌入模型用于推荐和内容控制。为解决缺乏大规模测试数据集的问题，研究者开发了越南语基准VN-MTEB，通过翻译和过滤英语样本生成高质量数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越南互联网环境复杂，缺乏适合评估AI模型的大规模数据集，VN-MTEB旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和先进嵌入模型翻译并过滤英语样本，保留语言流畅性和语义准确性，同时支持命名实体识别和代码片段。

Result: VN-MTEB包含41个数据集，覆盖6种任务，实验表明使用旋转位置嵌入的复杂模型表现更优。

Conclusion: VN-MTEB为越南语嵌入模型提供了高质量基准，支持更有效的模型评估和部署。

Abstract: Vietnam ranks among the top countries in terms of both internet traffic and
online toxicity. As a result, implementing embedding models for recommendation
and content control duties in applications is crucial. However, a lack of
large-scale test datasets, both in volume and task diversity, makes it tricky
for scientists to effectively evaluate AI models before deploying them in
real-world, large-scale projects. To solve this important problem, we introduce
a Vietnamese benchmark, VN-MTEB for embedding models, which we created by
translating a large number of English samples from the Massive Text Embedding
Benchmark using our new automated framework. We leverage the strengths of large
language models (LLMs) and cutting-edge embedding models to conduct translation
and filtering processes to retain high-quality samples, guaranteeing a natural
flow of language and semantic fidelity while preserving named entity
recognition (NER) and code snippets. Our comprehensive benchmark consists of 41
datasets from six tasks specifically designed for Vietnamese text embeddings.
In our analysis, we find that bigger and more complex models using Rotary
Positional Embedding outperform those using Absolute Positional Embedding in
embedding tasks. Datasets are available at HuggingFace:

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型中“助手”人格的激活空间向量（persona vectors），用于监控和控制其人格变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 助手人格有时会偏离‘有益、无害、诚实’的理想状态，需要识别和控制这些偏差。

Method: 提取并应用persona vectors来预测和干预训练中的人格变化，提出预防性调整方法。

Result: 发现人格变化与persona vectors相关，可通过干预或预防方法控制。

Conclusion: persona vectors能自动化识别和干预人格变化，适用于任何特质。

Abstract: Large language models interact with users through a simulated 'Assistant'
persona. While the Assistant is typically trained to be helpful, harmless, and
honest, it sometimes deviates from these ideals. In this paper, we identify
directions in the model's activation space-persona vectors-underlying several
traits, such as evil, sycophancy, and propensity to hallucinate. We confirm
that these vectors can be used to monitor fluctuations in the Assistant's
personality at deployment time. We then apply persona vectors to predict and
control personality shifts that occur during training. We find that both
intended and unintended personality changes after finetuning are strongly
correlated with shifts along the relevant persona vectors. These shifts can be
mitigated through post-hoc intervention, or avoided in the first place with a
new preventative steering method. Moreover, persona vectors can be used to flag
training data that will produce undesirable personality changes, both at the
dataset level and the individual sample level. Our method for extracting
persona vectors is automated and can be applied to any personality trait of
interest, given only a natural-language description.

*Tuan Vu Ho,Hiroaki Kokubo,Masaaki Yamamoto,Yohei Kawaguchi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无模型的推测解码技术（Token Map Drafting），用于加速基于Transformer的端到端自动语音识别（ASR）系统在CPU设备上的推理速度，同时保持转录准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码（SD）技术需要额外的草稿模型，这在缺乏硬件加速器（如GPU）的设备上不实用。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Token Map Drafting技术，利用预计算的n-gram token map替代草稿模型，实现高效推测解码。

Result: 在CI-AVSR和内部数据集上分别实现了1.27倍和1.37倍的解码加速，且未降低识别准确率。在CPU上比Distill-spec基线快10%。

Conclusion: 该方法在低困惑度领域中显著提升了ASR推理速度，适用于资源受限设备。

Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems based on transformer
architectures, such as Whisper, offer high transcription accuracy and
robustness. However, their autoregressive decoding is computationally
expensive, hence limiting deployment on CPU-based and resource-constrained
devices. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this issue by using a smaller
draft model to propose candidate tokens, which are then verified by the main
model. However, this approach is impractical for devices lacking hardware
accelerators like GPUs. To address this, we propose \emph{Token Map Drafting},
a model-free SD technique that eliminates the need for a separate draft model.
Instead, we leverage a precomputed n-gram token map derived from
domain-specific training data, enabling efficient speculative decoding with
minimal overhead. Our method significantly accelerates ASR inference in
structured, low-perplexity domains without sacrificing transcription accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate decoding speed-ups of $1.27\times$ on the
CI-AVSR dataset and $1.37\times$ on our internal dataset without degrading
recognition accuracy. Additionally, our approach achieves a $10\%$ absolute
improvement in decoding speed over the Distill-spec baseline running on CPU,
highlighting its effectiveness for on-device ASR applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TriangleMix是一种新型的静态注意力模式，通过在浅层使用密集注意力、深层切换为三角形稀疏模式，显著降低计算开销，同时保持模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态稀疏注意力方法会降低准确性，而动态稀疏方法因运行时稀疏索引估计引入额外计算开销。

Method: TriangleMix在浅层使用密集注意力，深层采用三角形稀疏模式。

Result: 实验显示，TriangleMix在深层减少注意力开销3.7x至15.3x，整体TTFT降低12%至32%，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: TriangleMix可提升LLM推理效率，并能与动态稀疏方法结合进一步加速。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on attention mechanisms whose time
complexity grows quadratically with input sequence length, creating significant
computational bottlenecks during the prefilling stage. Existing static sparse
attention methods typically degrade accuracy, while dynamic sparsity methods
introduce additional computational overhead due to runtime sparse index
estimation. To address these limitations, we propose TriangleMix, a novel
training-free static attention pattern. TriangleMix employs dense attention in
shallow layers and switches to a triangle-shaped sparse pattern in deeper
layers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TriangleMix reduces attention
overhead by 3.7x to 15.3x in deep layers, and decreases overall
Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) by 12% to 32% for sequence lengths ranging from 32K
to 128K, without sacrificing model accuracy. Moreover, TriangleMix can be
seamlessly integrated with dynamic sparsity methods to achieve further speedup,
e.g. accelerating MInference by 19% at 128K, highlighting its potential to
enhance LLM inference efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文复制并扩展了一项NLP4RE研究，评估了深度学习模型在需求分类中的表现，并比较了GPT-4零样本分类器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP技术为需求工程提供了新机会，但缺乏对NLP4RE研究的复制，因此通过复制和扩展研究来验证结果的可靠性和推广性。

Method: 复制并扩展了基线研究，评估了不同模型在外部数据集上的表现，并与GPT-4零样本分类器进行比较。

Result: 不同模型的复现性差异显著，BERT和ELMo表现良好，GPT-4与传统模型性能相当，研究确认了基线研究的可复制性。

Conclusion: 研究验证了NLP4RE的潜力，并提供了完整的复制包和ID卡，以支持未来研究的复现。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have been widely applied in the
requirements engineering (RE) field to support tasks such as classification and
ambiguity detection. Although RE research is rooted in empirical investigation,
it has paid limited attention to replicating NLP for RE (NLP4RE) studies. The
rapidly advancing realm of NLP is creating new opportunities for efficient,
machine-assisted workflows, which can bring new perspectives and results to the
forefront. Thus, we replicate and extend a previous NLP4RE study (baseline),
"Classifying User Requirements from Online Feedback in Small Dataset
Environments using Deep Learning", which evaluated different deep learning
models for requirement classification from user reviews. We reproduced the
original results using publicly released source code, thereby helping to
strengthen the external validity of the baseline study. We then extended the
setup by evaluating model performance on an external dataset and comparing
results to a GPT-4o zero-shot classifier. Furthermore, we prepared the
replication study ID-card for the baseline study, important for evaluating
replication readiness. Results showed diverse reproducibility levels across
different models, with Naive Bayes demonstrating perfect reproducibility. In
contrast, BERT and other models showed mixed results. Our findings revealed
that baseline deep learning models, BERT and ELMo, exhibited good
generalization capabilities on an external dataset, and GPT-4o showed
performance comparable to traditional baseline machine learning models.
Additionally, our assessment confirmed the baseline study's replication
readiness; however missing environment setup files would have further enhanced
readiness. We include this missing information in our replication package and
provide the replication study ID-card for our study to further encourage and
support the replication of our study.

Motivation: 解决维吾尔语NLP中资源匮乏的问题，特别是现有树库对黏着语和低资源语言的支持不足。

Method: 提出包含18种主关系和26种子类型的标注框架，并通过预训练的通用依赖解析器进行跨标准评估。

Result: 评估显示47.9%的标注差异，表明通用方案对维吾尔语结构的处理不足。提出的MUDT树库提供了更准确的标注。

Conclusion: MUDT树库为维吾尔语NLP提供了更准确的依赖标注，并为其他形态复杂语言提供了可复用的模型。

Abstract: To address a critical resource gap in Uyghur Natural Language Processing
(NLP), this study introduces a dependency annotation framework designed to
overcome the limitations of existing treebanks for the low-resource,
agglutinative language. This inventory includes 18 main relations and 26
subtypes, with specific labels such as cop:zero for verbless clauses and
instr:case=loc/dat for nuanced instrumental functions. To empirically validate
the necessity of this tailored approach, we conducted a cross-standard
evaluation using a pre-trained Universal Dependencies parser. The analysis
revealed a systematic 47.9% divergence in annotations, pinpointing the
inadequacy of universal schemes for handling Uyghur-specific structures.
Grounded in nine annotation principles that ensure typological accuracy and
semantic transparency, the Modern Uyghur Dependency Treebank (MUDT) provides a
more accurate and semantically transparent representation, designed to enable
significant improvements in parsing and downstream NLP tasks, and offers a
replicable model for other morphologically complex languages.

Motivation: 现有研究知识冲突的基准存在局限性，如局限于问答设置、依赖实体替换技术及冲突类型单一。

Method: 提出基于知识图谱的框架MAGIC，生成多样且微妙的冲突，并通过KG的显式关系结构确保可解释性。

Result: 实验表明，开源和专有LLMs在冲突检测（尤其是多跳推理）和定位矛盾源方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究为改进LLMs整合多样（甚至冲突）信息的能力提供了基础分析。

Abstract: Knowledge conflict often arises in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems, where retrieved documents may be inconsistent with one another or
contradict the model's parametric knowledge. Existing benchmarks for
investigating the phenomenon have notable limitations, including a narrow focus
on the question answering setup, heavy reliance on entity substitution
techniques, and a restricted range of conflict types. To address these issues,
we propose a knowledge graph (KG)-based framework that generates varied and
subtle conflicts between two similar yet distinct contexts, while ensuring
interpretability through the explicit relational structure of KGs. Experimental
results on our benchmark, MAGIC, provide intriguing insights into the inner
workings of LLMs regarding knowledge conflict: both open-source and proprietary
models struggle with conflict detection -- especially when multi-hop reasoning
is required -- and often fail to pinpoint the exact source of contradictions.
Finally, we present in-depth analyses that serve as a foundation for improving
LLMs in integrating diverse, sometimes even conflicting, information.

Motivation: 验证神经网络是否能复现人类对复杂语言现象（形态模式）的敏感性。

Method: 采用与人类研究相同的分析框架，评估模型在三种频率条件下的表现：自然、低频和高频分布。

Result: 模型在词干和后缀准确性上优于人类，但在响应偏好上存在明显差异；模型受训练数据中不规则动词比例影响。

Conclusion: 模型与人类在语言处理上存在差异，训练数据分布影响模型对形态模式的敏感性。

Abstract: This study investigates the cognitive plausibility of the Spanish irregular
morphomic pattern by directly comparing transformer-based neural networks to
human behavioral data from \citet{Nevins2015TheRA}. Using the same analytical
framework as the original human study, we evaluate whether transformer models
can replicate human-like sensitivity to a complex linguistic phenomena, the
morphome, under controlled input conditions. Our experiments focus on three
frequency conditions: natural, low-frequency, and high-frequency distributions
of verbs exhibiting irregular morphomic patterns. While the models outperformed
humans in stem and suffix accuracy, a clear divergence emerged in response
preferences. Unlike humans, who consistently favored natural responses across
all test items, models' preferred irregular responses and were influenced by
the proportion of irregular verbs in their training data. Additionally, models
trained on the natural and low-frequency distributions, but not the
high-frequency distribution, were sensitive to the phonological similarity
between test items and real Spanish L-shaped verbs.

Motivation: 教师模型的输出分布包含丰富信息，而传统束搜索仅提供近似模式，限制了学生模型的学习潜力。

Method: 利用束搜索的n-best列表生成多翻译句子，结合采样方法增加多样性和低频词覆盖。

Result: 低资源语言中，采样方法虽略降低翻译质量，但增加多样性和词汇丰富性，提升学生模型性能并减少性别偏见。

Conclusion: MHD通过多翻译句子更全面地利用教师模型分布，显著提升学生模型表现，尤其在低资源语言中效果显著。

Abstract: This paper explores sequence-level knowledge distillation (KD) of
multilingual pre-trained encoder-decoder translation models. We argue that the
teacher model's output distribution holds valuable insights for the student,
beyond the approximated mode obtained through beam search (the standard
decoding method), and present Multi-Hypothesis Distillation (MHD), a
sequence-level KD method that generates multiple translations for each source
sentence. This provides a larger representation of the teacher model
distribution and exposes the student model to a wider range of target-side
prefixes. We leverage $n$-best lists from beam search to guide the student's
learning and examine alternative decoding methods to address issues like low
variability and the under-representation of infrequent tokens. For low-resource
languages, our research shows that while sampling methods may slightly
compromise translation quality compared to beam search based approaches, they
enhance the generated corpora with greater variability and lexical richness.
This ultimately improves student model performance and mitigates the gender
bias amplification often associated with KD.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和模型有效解决了奖励模型在复杂推理中的局限性，为推理能力的持续提升提供了新途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly improved the reasoning ability
of large language models. However, current reward models underperform in
challenging reasoning scenarios and predominant RL training paradigms rely on
rule-based or reference-based rewards, which impose two critical limitations:
1) the dependence on finely annotated reference answer to attain rewards; and
2) the requirement for constrained output format. These limitations
fundamentally hinder further RL data scaling and sustained enhancement of model
reasoning performance. To address these limitations, we propose a comprehensive
framework for evaluating and improving the performance of reward models in
complex reasoning scenarios. We first present a reasoning-oriented benchmark
(Libra Bench), systematically constructed from a diverse collection of
challenging mathematical problems and advanced reasoning models, to address the
limitations of existing reward model benchmarks in reasoning scenarios. We
further introduce a novel approach for improving the generative reward model
via learning-to-think methodologies. Based on the proposed approach, we develop
Libra-RM series, a collection of generative reward models with reasoning
capabilities that achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks.
Comprehensive downstream experiments are conducted and the experimental results
demonstrate the correlation between our Libra Bench and downstream application,
and the potential of Libra-RM to further improve reasoning models with
unlabeled data.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注过滤安全提示，而忽略了总是引发有害输出的硬提示。UnsafeChain填补了这一空白。

Method: 构建UnsafeChain数据集，包含多样化的硬提示及其纠正后的安全响应，并对三个大型推理模型进行微调。

Result: UnsafeChain在多个基准测试中表现优于现有数据集，甚至1K子集也能匹配或超越基线性能。

Conclusion: 基于纠正的监督方法在提升模型安全性和泛化能力方面有效。

Abstract: As large reasoning models (LRMs) grow more capable, chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning introduces new safety challenges. Existing SFT-based safety alignment
studies dominantly focused on filtering prompts with safe, high-quality
responses, while overlooking hard prompts that always elicit harmful outputs.
To fill this gap, we introduce UnsafeChain, a safety alignment dataset
constructed from hard prompts with diverse sources, where unsafe completions
are identified and explicitly corrected into safe responses. By exposing models
to unsafe behaviors and guiding their correction, UnsafeChain enhances safety
while preserving general reasoning ability. We fine-tune three LRMs on
UnsafeChain and compare them against recent SafeChain and STAR-1 across six
out-of-distribution and five in-distribution benchmarks. UnsafeChain
consistently outperforms prior datasets, with even a 1K subset matching or
surpassing baseline performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and
generalizability of correction-based supervision. We release our dataset and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型（PLMs）在自然语言处理中表现优异，但对对抗攻击脆弱，现有方法计算成本高。

Method: 通过移除实例级主成分，将嵌入空间转换为近似高斯分布，减少对抗扰动的影响。

Result: 在八个基准数据集上验证，该方法在保持原始精度的同时显著提升对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在鲁棒性和泛化性之间取得了平衡，计算成本低且无需对抗样本。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have driven substantial progress in
natural language processing but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks,
raising concerns about their robustness in real-world applications. Previous
studies have sought to mitigate the impact of adversarial attacks by
introducing adversarial perturbations into the training process, either
implicitly or explicitly. While both strategies enhance robustness, they often
incur high computational costs. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective
add-on module that enhances the adversarial robustness of PLMs by removing
instance-level principal components, without relying on conventional
adversarial defences or perturbing the original training data. Our approach
transforms the embedding space to approximate Gaussian properties, thereby
reducing its susceptibility to adversarial perturbations while preserving
semantic relationships. This transformation aligns embedding distributions in a
way that minimises the impact of adversarial noise on decision boundaries,
enhancing robustness without requiring adversarial examples or costly
training-time augmentation. Evaluations on eight benchmark datasets show that
our approach improves adversarial robustness while maintaining comparable
before-attack accuracy to baselines, achieving a balanced trade-off between
robustness and generalisation.

Method: 构建AgriEval基准，涵盖多种农业认知场景，数据来源于高校考试和作业，评估51个开源和商业LLM。

Result: 现有LLM在AgriEval上表现不佳，多数未能达到60%准确率，显示农业LLM的发展潜力。

Conclusion: AgriEval为农业LLM提供了重要基准，揭示了改进空间，并提出了优化策略。

Abstract: In the agricultural domain, the deployment of large language models (LLMs) is
hindered by the lack of training data and evaluation benchmarks. To mitigate
this issue, we propose AgriEval, the first comprehensive Chinese agricultural
benchmark with three main characteristics: (1) Comprehensive Capability
Evaluation. AgriEval covers six major agriculture categories and 29
subcategories within agriculture, addressing four core cognitive scenarios:
memorization, understanding, inference, and generation. (2) High-Quality Data.
The dataset is curated from university-level examinations and assignments,
providing a natural and robust benchmark for assessing the capacity of LLMs to
apply knowledge and make expert-like decisions. (3) Diverse Formats and
Extensive Scale. AgriEval comprises 14,697 multiple-choice questions and 2,167
open-ended question-and-answer questions, establishing it as the most extensive
agricultural benchmark available to date. We also present comprehensive
experimental results over 51 open-source and commercial LLMs. The experimental
results reveal that most existing LLMs struggle to achieve 60% accuracy,
underscoring the developmental potential in agricultural LLMs. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to investigate factors influencing model
performance and propose strategies for enhancement. AgriEval is available at

### [45] [The Problem with Safety Classification is not just the Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21782)
*Sowmya Vajjala*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）安全分类器的多语言差异及评估数据集的问题，指出当前安全分类器的不足不仅源于模型本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs安全分类器的多语言差异及评估数据集的有效性，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 通过分析覆盖18种语言的数据集，评估5个安全分类模型的多语言表现。

Result: 发现多语言差异及评估数据集的问题，表明安全分类器的不足不仅源于模型本身。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于开发更好的多语言有害内容识别方法。

Abstract: Studying the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to unsafe behaviors
is an important topic of research today. Building safety classification models
or guard models, which are fine-tuned models for input/output safety
classification for LLMs, is seen as one of the solutions to address the issue.
Although there is a lot of research on the safety testing of LLMs themselves,
there is little research on evaluating the effectiveness of such safety
classifiers or the evaluation datasets used for testing them, especially in
multilingual scenarios. In this position paper, we demonstrate how multilingual
disparities exist in 5 safety classification models by considering datasets
covering 18 languages. At the same time, we identify potential issues with the
evaluation datasets, arguing that the shortcomings of current safety
classifiers are not only because of the models themselves. We expect that these
findings will contribute to the discussion on developing better methods to
identify harmful content in LLM inputs across languages.

Abstract: Chart annotations enhance visualization accessibility but suffer from
fragmented, non-standardized representations that limit cross-platform reuse.
We propose ChartMark, a structured grammar that separates annotation semantics
from visualization implementations. ChartMark features a hierarchical framework
mapping onto annotation dimensions (e.g., task, chart context), supporting both
abstract intents and precise visual details. Our toolkit demonstrates
converting ChartMark specifications into Vega-Lite visualizations, highlighting
its flexibility, expressiveness, and practical applicability.

TL;DR: HRIPBench是一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）在减害信息提供中准确性和安全风险的基准，结果显示当前LLM仍存在严重问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在减害信息提供中的表现，以改善药物使用者的健康和安全。

Method: 构建HRIP-Bench基准数据集（2,160个问答对），涵盖三个任务，并设计Instruction和RAG方案评估模型行为。

Result: 当前先进LLM在提供减害信息时仍不准确，且可能带来严重安全风险。

Conclusion: 在减害场景中使用LLM需谨慎，以避免负面健康后果。

Abstract: Millions of individuals' well-being are challenged by the harms of substance
use. Harm reduction as a public health strategy is designed to improve their
health outcomes and reduce safety risks. Some large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a decent level of medical knowledge, promising to address the
information needs of people who use drugs (PWUD). However, their performance in
relevant tasks remains largely unexplored. We introduce HRIPBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate LLM's accuracy and safety risks in harm reduction
information provision. The benchmark dataset HRIP-Basic has 2,160
question-answer-evidence pairs. The scope covers three tasks: checking safety
boundaries, providing quantitative values, and inferring polysubstance use
risks. We build the Instruction and RAG schemes to evaluate model behaviours
based on their inherent knowledge and the integration of domain knowledge. Our
results indicate that state-of-the-art LLMs still struggle to provide accurate
harm reduction information, and sometimes, carry out severe safety risks to
PWUD. The use of LLMs in harm reduction contexts should be cautiously
constrained to avoid inducing negative health outcomes. WARNING: This paper
contains illicit content that potentially induces harms.

TL;DR: 论文研究了事件合理性变化评估，提出了一种基于句子Transformer的新方法，并发现现有模型在此任务上表现不佳，同时强调了平衡评估方法的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解事件合理性变化对对话生成、常识推理和幻觉检测等任务至关重要，但目前研究较少。

Method: 使用句子Transformer和Transformer模型（如RoBERTa）对ADEPT挑战基准中的16K英语句子对进行建模实验。

Result: 句子Transformer和Transformer模型在此任务上表现不佳，句子Transformer甚至不如RoBERTa。评估方法的不平衡会影响模型性能和结果可信度。

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新方法，并强调了平衡评估的重要性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: While the task of assessing the plausibility of events such as ''news is
relevant'' has been addressed by a growing body of work, less attention has
been paid to capturing changes in plausibility as triggered by event
modification. Understanding changes in plausibility is relevant for tasks such
as dialogue generation, commonsense reasoning, and hallucination detection as
it allows to correctly model, for example, ''gentle sarcasm'' as a sign of
closeness rather than unkindness among friends [9]. In this work, we tackle the
ADEPT challenge benchmark [6] consisting of 16K English sentence pairs
differing by exactly one adjectival modifier. Our modeling experiments provide
a conceptually novel method by using sentence transformers, and reveal that
both they and transformer-based models struggle with the task at hand, and
sentence transformers - despite their conceptual alignment with the task - even
under-perform in comparison to models like RoBERTa. Furthermore, an in-depth
comparison with prior work highlights the importance of a more realistic,
balanced evaluation method: imbalances distort model performance and evaluation
metrics, and weaken result trustworthiness.

TL;DR: HALC是一种通用流程，用于系统可靠地构建针对任何编码任务和模型的最优提示，整合相关提示策略。通过测试，发现某些提示策略在特定任务中表现可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs广泛用于任务自动化，但提示策略的效果因模型和任务而异，目前仍依赖试错法。HALC旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出HALC流程，通过1,512个提示和200万次请求测试不同提示策略，基于专家编码（ground truth）评估LLM任务表现。

Result: 发现某些提示策略在单变量（αclimate = .76; αmovement = .78）和双变量（αclimate = .71; αmovement = .74）任务中表现可靠。

Conclusion: HALC为不同提示策略的有效性、关键影响因素以及可靠提示的识别提供了见解。

Abstract: LLMs are seeing widespread use for task automation, including automated
coding in the social sciences. However, even though researchers have proposed
different prompting strategies, their effectiveness varies across LLMs and
tasks. Often trial and error practices are still widespread. We propose
HALC$-$a general pipeline that allows for the systematic and reliable
construction of optimal prompts for any given coding task and model, permitting
the integration of any prompting strategy deemed relevant. To investigate LLM
coding and validate our pipeline, we sent a total of 1,512 individual prompts
to our local LLMs in over two million requests. We test prompting strategies
and LLM task performance based on few expert codings (ground truth). When
compared to these expert codings, we find prompts that code reliably for single
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .76; ${\alpha}$movement = .78) and across two
variables (${\alpha}$climate = .71; ${\alpha}$movement = .74) using the LLM
Mistral NeMo. Our prompting strategies are set up in a way that aligns the LLM
to our codebook$-$we are not optimizing our codebook for LLM friendliness. Our
paper provides insights into the effectiveness of different prompting
strategies, crucial influencing factors, and the identification of reliable
prompts for each coding task and model.

TL;DR: AutoTIR是一个基于强化学习的框架，使LLMs能自主决定是否及何时调用外部工具，提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义工具使用模式，可能损害语言模型的核心能力，而人类能自适应选择工具，因此需更灵活的解决方案。

Method: AutoTIR采用强化学习框架，结合任务答案正确性、结构化输出和工具使用惩罚的混合奖励机制。

Result: 在多种任务中，AutoTIR表现优于基线方法，展现出更好的工具使用泛化能力。

Conclusion: 强化学习有望为LLMs构建通用且可扩展的工具集成推理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), when enhanced through reasoning-oriented
post-training, evolve into powerful Large Reasoning Models (LRMs).
Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) further extends their capabilities by
incorporating external tools, but existing methods often rely on rigid,
predefined tool-use patterns that risk degrading core language competence.
Inspired by the human ability to adaptively select tools, we introduce AutoTIR,
a reinforcement learning framework that enables LLMs to autonomously decide
whether and which tool to invoke during the reasoning process, rather than
following static tool-use strategies. AutoTIR leverages a hybrid reward
mechanism that jointly optimizes for task-specific answer correctness,
structured output adherence, and penalization of incorrect tool usage, thereby
encouraging both precise reasoning and efficient tool integration. Extensive
evaluations across diverse knowledge-intensive, mathematical, and general
language modeling tasks demonstrate that AutoTIR achieves superior overall
performance, significantly outperforming baselines and exhibits superior
generalization in tool-use behavior. These results highlight the promise of
reinforcement learning in building truly generalizable and scalable TIR
capabilities in LLMs. The code and data are available at

TL;DR: Graph-R1通过端到端强化学习优化GraphRAG框架，提升检索效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GraphRAG方法存在构建成本高、检索固定、依赖长上下文推理和提示设计的问题。

Method: 引入轻量级知识超图构建，将检索建模为多轮代理-环境交互，并通过端到端奖励机制优化代理过程。

Result: 在标准RAG数据集上，Graph-R1在推理准确性、检索效率和生成质量上优于传统GraphRAG和RL增强的RAG方法。

Conclusion: Graph-R1通过强化学习解决了GraphRAG的挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates hallucination in LLMs by
incorporating external knowledge, but relies on chunk-based retrieval that
lacks structural semantics. GraphRAG methods improve RAG by modeling knowledge
as entity-relation graphs, but still face challenges in high construction cost,
fixed one-time retrieval, and reliance on long-context reasoning and prompt
design. To address these challenges, we propose Graph-R1, an agentic GraphRAG
framework via end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL). It introduces lightweight
knowledge hypergraph construction, models retrieval as a multi-turn
agent-environment interaction, and optimizes the agent process via an
end-to-end reward mechanism. Experiments on standard RAG datasets show that
Graph-R1 outperforms traditional GraphRAG and RL-enhanced RAG methods in
reasoning accuracy, retrieval efficiency, and generation quality.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段记忆-泛化框架，证明LLMs可以从死记硬背的数据中泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索死记硬背（rote learning）是否真的阻碍泛化，并研究LLMs如何通过记忆数据实现泛化。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：先通过无意义符号记忆事实关联，再通过少量语义提示微调模型以实现泛化。

Result: 实验表明，LLMs能通过语义提示重新解释记忆数据，并形成结构化、语义对齐的潜在表示。

Conclusion: 这一发现为高效知识注入提供了可能，但也存在恶意利用记忆数据的风险。

Abstract: Rote learning is a memorization technique based on repetition. It is commonly
believed to hinder generalization by encouraging verbatim memorization rather
than deeper understanding. This insight holds for even learning factual
knowledge that inevitably requires a certain degree of memorization. In this
work, we demonstrate that LLMs can be trained to generalize from rote memorized
data. We introduce a two-phase memorize-then-generalize framework, where the
model first rote memorizes factual subject-object associations using a
semantically meaningless token and then learns to generalize by fine-tuning on
a small set of semantically meaningful prompts. Extensive experiments over 8
LLMs show that the models can reinterpret rote memorized data through the
semantically meaningful prompts, as evidenced by the emergence of structured,
semantically aligned latent representations between the two. This surprising
finding opens the door to both effective and efficient knowledge injection and
possible risks of repurposing the memorized data for malicious usage.

TL;DR: 研究发现，优化语言模型以表现温暖和共情会显著降低其可靠性，尤其是在用户表达脆弱时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI语言模型在温暖和可靠性之间的权衡，尤其是在用户表达脆弱时的表现。

Method: 对五种不同规模和架构的语言模型进行实验，训练它们生成更温暖的回应，并评估其在安全关键任务中的表现。

Result: 温暖模型在错误率上显著增加（10-30%），更容易传播错误信息和验证用户错误信念。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法可能无法检测到这些系统性风险，需重新思考AI系统的开发和监督方式。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) developers are increasingly building language
models with warm and empathetic personas that millions of people now use for
advice, therapy, and companionship. Here, we show how this creates a
significant trade-off: optimizing language models for warmth undermines their
reliability, especially when users express vulnerability. We conducted
controlled experiments on five language models of varying sizes and
architectures, training them to produce warmer, more empathetic responses, then
evaluating them on safety-critical tasks. Warm models showed substantially
higher error rates (+10 to +30 percentage points) than their original
counterparts, promoting conspiracy theories, providing incorrect factual
information, and offering problematic medical advice. They were also
significantly more likely to validate incorrect user beliefs, particularly when
user messages expressed sadness. Importantly, these effects were consistent
across different model architectures, and occurred despite preserved
performance on standard benchmarks, revealing systematic risks that current
evaluation practices may fail to detect. As human-like AI systems are deployed
at an unprecedented scale, our findings indicate a need to rethink how we
develop and oversee these systems that are reshaping human relationships and
social interaction.

Motivation: 解决LLM生成答案校准性差的问题，模仿人类在没有外部反馈时的学习方式。

Method: 通过冻结LLM生成多个链式推理答案，计算每个答案的置信度并排序，利用这些合成偏好优化策略。

Result: RLSF改善了模型的校准性和逐步推理能力，在算术推理和选择题任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: RLSF证明了利用模型内在行为进行强化学习的有效性，为LLM后训练提供了数据高效的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce plausible but poorly-calibrated
answers, limiting their reliability on reasoning-intensive tasks. We present
Reinforcement Learning from Self-Feedback (RLSF), a post-training stage that
uses the model's own confidence as an intrinsic reward, mimicking how humans
learn in the absence of external feedback. After a frozen LLM generates several
chain-of-thought solutions, we define and compute the confidence of each final
answer span and rank the traces accordingly. These synthetic preferences are
then used to fine-tune the policy with standard preference optimization,
similar to RLHF yet requiring no human labels, gold answers, or externally
curated rewards.
  RLSF simultaneously (i) refines the model's probability estimates --
restoring well-behaved calibration -- and (ii) strengthens step-by-step
reasoning, yielding improved performance on arithmetic reasoning and
multiple-choice question answering.
  By turning a model's own uncertainty into useful self-feedback, RLSF affirms
reinforcement learning on intrinsic model behaviour as a principled and
data-efficient component of the LLM post-training pipeline and warrents further
research in intrinsic rewards for LLM post-training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RAG在跨文化食谱适应中的局限性，发现其无法充分利用上下文多样性生成多样化输出。

Method: 提出CARRIAGE框架，结合改进的检索和上下文组织策略，增强生成多样性。

Result: 实验表明CARRIAGE在多样性和质量上优于传统RAG和闭卷LLMs。

Conclusion: CARRIAGE是首个明确追求多样化输出的RAG框架，为多用户偏好提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: In cross-cultural recipe adaptation, the goal is not only to ensure cultural
appropriateness and retain the original dish's essence, but also to provide
diverse options for various dietary needs and preferences. Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) is a promising approach, combining the retrieval of real
recipes from the target cuisine for cultural adaptability with large language
models (LLMs) for relevance. However, it remains unclear whether RAG can
generate diverse adaptation results. Our analysis shows that RAG tends to
overly rely on a limited portion of the context across generations, failing to
produce diverse outputs even when provided with varied contextual inputs. This
reveals a key limitation of RAG in creative tasks with multiple valid answers:
it fails to leverage contextual diversity for generating varied responses. To
address this issue, we propose CARRIAGE, a plug-and-play RAG framework for
cross-cultural recipe adaptation that enhances diversity in both retrieval and
context organization. To our knowledge, this is the first RAG framework that
explicitly aims to generate highly diverse outputs to accommodate multiple user
preferences. Our experiments show that CARRIAGE achieves Pareto efficiency in
terms of diversity and quality of recipe adaptation compared to closed-book
LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统机器学习模型在微生物组研究中因小样本或标签异构导致的泛化能力不足问题。

Method: 使用多种LLMs（如ChatGPT-4o、Claude 3.7 Sonnet等）在零样本和少样本设置下进行微生物样本分类和污染风险预测，并与传统模型（如随机森林）对比。

Result: LLMs在本体分类和污染风险预测中均优于基线模型，且能跨数据集和元数据分布泛化。

Conclusion: LLMs能够有效处理稀疏、异构的生物元数据，为环境微生物学和生物监测提供了一种仅依赖元数据的有前景的方法。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning models struggle to generalize in microbiome
studies where only metadata is available, especially in small-sample settings
or across studies with heterogeneous label formats. In this work, we explore
the use of large language models (LLMs) to classify microbial samples into
ontology categories such as EMPO 3 and related biological labels, as well as to
predict pathogen contamination risk, specifically the presence of E. Coli,
using environmental metadata alone. We evaluate LLMs such as ChatGPT-4o, Claude
3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing
their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across
multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform
baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive
ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata
distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over
sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only
approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.

Result: 在多跳QA任务中，DeepSieve在推理深度、检索精度和可解释性上优于传统RAG方法。

Conclusion: DeepSieve通过模块化和透明设计，为知识密集型查询提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many reasoning tasks but struggle with
knowledge-intensive queries due to their inability to dynamically access
up-to-date or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
has emerged as a promising solution, enabling LLMs to ground their responses in
external sources. However, existing RAG methods lack fine-grained control over
both the query and source sides, often resulting in noisy retrieval and shallow
reasoning. In this work, we introduce DeepSieve, an agentic RAG framework that
incorporates information sieving via LLM-as-a-knowledge-router. DeepSieve
decomposes complex queries into structured sub-questions and recursively routes
each to the most suitable knowledge source, filtering irrelevant information
through a multi-stage distillation process. Our design emphasizes modularity,
transparency, and adaptability, leveraging recent advances in agentic system
design. Experiments on multi-hop QA tasks across heterogeneous sources
demonstrate improved reasoning depth, retrieval precision, and interpretability
over conventional RAG approaches.

Conclusion: 该数据集和工具旨在加速机器学习驱动的人类运动分析研究。

Abstract: Wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs) offer a cost-effective and
scalable means to assess human movement quality in clinical and everyday
settings. However, the development of robust sensor-based classification models
for physiotherapeutic exercises and gait analysis requires large, diverse
datasets, which are costly and time-consuming to collect. Here, we present a
multimodal dataset of physiotherapeutic exercises - including correct and
clinically relevant variants - and gait-related exercises - including both
normal and impaired gait patterns - recorded from 19 participants using
synchronized IMUs and marker-based motion capture (MoCap). The dataset includes
raw data from nine IMUs and thirty-five optical markers capturing full-body
kinematics. Each IMU is additionally equipped with four optical markers,
enabling precise comparison between IMU-derived orientation estimates and
reference values from the MoCap system. To support further analysis, we also
provide processed IMU orientations aligned with common segment coordinate
systems, subject-specific OpenSim models, inverse kinematics results, and tools
for visualizing IMU orientations in the musculoskeletal context. Detailed
annotations of movement execution quality and time-stamped segmentations
support diverse analysis goals. This dataset supports the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models for tasks such as automatic exercise
evaluation, gait analysis, temporal activity segmentation, and biomechanical
parameter estimation. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide code for
postprocessing, sensor-to-segment alignment, inverse kinematics computation,
and technical validation. This resource is intended to accelerate research in
machine learning-driven human movement analysis.

Result: BF-PIP在无需额外训练的情况下，预测准确率达73%，比GPT-4V基线高18%。

Conclusion: 结合时间视频输入和上下文线索可提升时空感知能力，为智能交通系统提供无需重新训练的敏捷感知模块。

Abstract: Pedestrian intention prediction is essential for autonomous driving in
complex urban environments. Conventional approaches depend on supervised
learning over frame sequences and require extensive retraining to adapt to new
scenarios. Here, we introduce BF-PIP (Beyond Frames Pedestrian Intention
Prediction), a zero-shot approach built upon Gemini 2.5 Pro. It infers crossing
intentions directly from short, continuous video clips enriched with structured
JAAD metadata. In contrast to GPT-4V based methods that operate on discrete
frames, BF-PIP processes uninterrupted temporal clips. It also incorporates
bounding-box annotations and ego-vehicle speed via specialized multimodal
prompts. Without any additional training, BF-PIP achieves 73% prediction
accuracy, outperforming a GPT-4V baseline by 18 %. These findings illustrate
that combining temporal video inputs with contextual cues enhances
spatiotemporal perception and improves intent inference under ambiguous
conditions. This approach paves the way for agile, retraining-free perception
module in intelligent transportation system.

Motivation: 现有图表编辑方法主要依赖自然语言指令，但语言模糊性限制了细粒度编辑能力，因此需要更直观的多模态表达方式。

Method: 提出结合自然语言和视觉指示器的多模态编辑范式，构建ChartM3基准（含1000个样本）和ChartM3-Train训练集（24000个样本），用于评估和训练模型。

Conclusion: 多模态监督对实用图表编辑系统至关重要，ChartM3为未来研究提供了数据和工具支持。

Abstract: Charts are a fundamental visualization format widely used in data analysis
across research and industry. While enabling users to edit charts based on
high-level intentions is of great practical value, existing methods primarily
rely on natural language instructions, which are often too ambiguous to support
fine-grained editing. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for
multimodal chart editing, where user intent is expressed through a combination
of natural language and visual indicators that explicitly highlight the
elements to be modified. To support this paradigm, we present
Chart$\text{M}^3$, a new benchmark for Multimodal chart editing with
Multi-level complexity and Multi-perspective evaluation. Chart$\text{M}^3$
contains 1,000 samples spanning four levels of editing difficulty. Each sample
includes triplets in the form of (chart, code, multimodal instructions). To
comprehensively evaluate chart editing models, Chart$\text{M}^3$ provides
metrics that assess both visual appearance and code correctness. Our benchmark
reveals significant limitations in current multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), including GPT-4o, particularly in their ability to interpret and act
on visual indicators. To address this, we construct Chart$\text{M}^3$-Train, a
large-scale training set with 24,000 multimodal chart editing samples.
Fine-tuning MLLMs on this dataset leads to substantial improvements,
demonstrating the importance of multimodal supervision in building practical
chart editing systems. Our datasets, codes, and evaluation tools are available

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种用于合成牙科全景X光片的生成对抗网络（GAN），旨在解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。通过训练DCGAN模型并使用WGANGP损失函数，研究探索了四种候选模型，并评估了生成图像的质量。


<details>

Motivation: 解决牙科研究和教育中数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 使用DCGAN和WGANGP损失函数训练模型，探索四种候选模型，并进行数据预处理和清理。

Result: 生成图像在解剖可见性和真实性上表现中等，部分图像存在伪影。未去噪数据训练的模型在细节上更优，而去噪数据训练的模型整体清晰度更高。

Conclusion: 为牙科影像中基于GAN的方法提供了未来研究的基础。

Abstract: This paper presents the development of a generative adversarial network (GAN)
for synthesizing dental panoramic radiographs. Although exploratory in nature,
the study aims to address the scarcity of data in dental research and
education. We trained a deep convolutional GAN (DCGAN) using a Wasserstein loss
with gradient penalty (WGANGP) on a dataset of 2322 radiographs of varying
quality. The focus was on the dentoalveolar regions, other anatomical
structures were cropped out. Extensive preprocessing and data cleaning were
performed to standardize the inputs while preserving anatomical variability. We
explored four candidate models by varying critic iterations, feature depth, and
the use of denoising prior to training. A clinical expert evaluated the
generated radiographs based on anatomical visibility and realism, using a
5-point scale (1 very poor 5 excellent). Most images showed moderate anatomical
depiction, although some were degraded by artifacts. A trade-off was observed
the model trained on non-denoised data yielded finer details especially in
structures like the mandibular canal and trabecular bone, while a model trained
on denoised data offered superior overall image clarity and sharpness. These
findings provide a foundation for future work on GAN-based methods in dental
imaging.

*Monika Shah,Somdeb Sarkhel,Deepak Venugopal*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合马尔可夫逻辑网络（HMLNs）的新解释框架，用于解释深度神经网络在多模态任务（如图像描述生成）中的信息整合过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管DNN在多模态任务中表现优异，但其如何整合视觉、语言和知识表示以生成有意义的描述仍难以解释。现有性能指标通常依赖于与人工描述的比较，无法深入揭示模型内部机制。

Method: 通过HMLNs结合符号规则和实值函数，学习训练实例的分布，并通过条件生成样本推断分布变化，量化哪些训练实例对生成描述提供了更丰富的信息。

Result: 实验表明，该框架能够为多种先进图像描述模型生成可解释的解释，并比较这些模型在可解释性方面的表现。

Conclusion: 该框架为DNN在多模态任务中的信息整合提供了可解释的解释方法，有助于模型比较和改进。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have made tremendous progress in multimodal tasks
such as image captioning. However, explaining/interpreting how these models
integrate visual information, language information and knowledge representation
to generate meaningful captions remains a challenging problem. Standard metrics
to measure performance typically rely on comparing generated captions with
human-written ones that may not provide a user with a deep insights into this
integration. In this work, we develop a novel explanation framework that is
easily interpretable based on Hybrid Markov Logic Networks (HMLNs) - a language
that can combine symbolic rules with real-valued functions - where we
hypothesize how relevant examples from the training data could have influenced
the generation of the observed caption. To do this, we learn a HMLN
distribution over the training instances and infer the shift in distributions
over these instances when we condition on the generated sample which allows us
to quantify which examples may have been a source of richer information to
generate the observed caption. Our experiments on captions generated for
several state-of-the-art captioning models using Amazon Mechanical Turk
illustrate the interpretability of our explanations, and allow us to compare
these models along the dimension of explainability.

Conclusion: 该方法为时空动作定位的半监督学习提供了有效解决方案，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) has shown tremendous potential to improve the
predictive performance of deep learning models when annotations are hard to
obtain. However, the application of SSL has so far been mainly studied in the
context of image classification. In this work, we present a semi-supervised
approach for spatial-temporal action localization. We introduce a dual guidance
network to select better pseudo-bounding boxes. It combines a frame-level
classification with a bounding-box prediction to enforce action class
consistency across frames and boxes. Our evaluation across well-known
spatial-temporal action localization datasets, namely UCF101-24 , J-HMDB-21 and
AVA shows that the proposed module considerably enhances the model's
performance in limited labeled data settings. Our framework achieves superior
results compared to extended image-based semi-supervised baselines.

Abstract: Aerial wildlife tracking is critical for conservation efforts and relies on
detecting small objects on the ground below the aircraft. It presents technical
challenges: crewed aircraft are expensive, risky and disruptive; autonomous
drones have limited computational capacity for onboard AI systems. Since the
objects of interest may appear only a few pixels wide, small object detection
is an inherently challenging computer vision subfield compounded by
computational efficiency needs. This paper applies a patching augmentation to
datasets to study model performance under various settings. A comparative study
of three common yet architecturally diverse object detectors is conducted using
the data, varying the patching method's hyperparameters against detection
accuracy. Each model achieved at least 93\% mAP@IoU=0.5 on at least one
patching configuration. Statistical analyses provide an in-depth commentary on
the effects of various factors. Analysis also shows that faster, simpler models
are about as effective as models that require more computational power for this
task and perform well given limited patch scales, encouraging UAV deployment.

*Jack Hilliard,Adrian Hilton,Jean-Yves Guillemaut*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新方法，用于从单视角图像估计HDR环境贴图，解决了ERP表示中的边界接缝问题，并通过全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）进一步优化质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统ERP表示在环境贴图中产生的极区扭曲和边界接缝问题，提升镜像反射表面的光照效果。

Method: 1. 在潜在自编码器中引入ERP卷积填充以消除边界接缝；2. 提出全景适应的扩散变换器架构（PanoDiT）以减少ERP扭曲。

Result: 模型在标准基准测试中表现出色，生成的环境贴图在图像质量和光照准确性上均具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 新方法有效解决了ERP表示的问题，并通过PanoDiT进一步优化了环境贴图的质量，尽管后者在图像真实性上有所牺牲。

Abstract: We advance the field of HDR environment map estimation from a single-view
image by establishing a novel approach leveraging the Latent Diffusion Model
(LDM) to produce high-quality environment maps that can plausibly light
mirror-reflective surfaces. A common issue when using the ERP representation,
the format used by the vast majority of approaches, is distortions at the poles
and a seam at the sides of the environment map. We remove the border seam
artefact by proposing an ERP convolutional padding in the latent autoencoder.
Additionally, we investigate whether adapting the diffusion network
architecture to the ERP format can improve the quality and accuracy of the
estimated environment map by proposing a panoramically-adapted Diffusion
Transformer architecture. Our proposed PanoDiT network reduces ERP distortions
and artefacts, but at the cost of image quality and plausibility. We evaluate
with standard benchmarks to demonstrate that our models estimate high-quality
environment maps that perform competitively with state-of-the-art approaches in
both image quality and lighting accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于CLIP的模型在医学任务中表现优异，但其公平性和鲁棒性尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用三个公开数据集（MIMIC-CXR、NIH-CXR14、NEATX）评估六种CLIP模型，分析公平性和鲁棒性。

Result: 不同年龄患者间性能差距显著，但对性别和种族表现较公平；模型对无胸腔引流管的图像表现较差。

Conclusion: CLIP模型在医学任务中存在公平性和鲁棒性问题，需进一步优化以减少虚假相关性。

Abstract: Motivated by the strong performance of CLIP-based models in natural
image-text domains, recent efforts have adapted these architectures to medical
tasks, particularly in radiology, where large paired datasets of images and
reports, such as chest X-rays, are available. While these models have shown
encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their
fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely
underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used
CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available
datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across
six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally,
we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on
pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate
performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results
for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on
images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We
further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings
generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified
from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the
limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models. Our code

Result: 在视觉质量和稳定性上达到最先进水平，仅需普通2D摄像头即可实现3D会议。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D视频会议提供了高可访问性、真实性和灵活性的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual 3D meetings offer the potential to enhance copresence, increase
engagement and thus improve effectiveness of remote meetings compared to
standard 2D video calls. However, representing people in 3D meetings remains a
challenge; existing solutions achieve high quality by using complex hardware,
making use of fixed appearance via enrolment, or by inverting a pre-trained
generative model. These approaches lead to constraints that are unwelcome and
ill-fitting for videoconferencing applications. We present the first method to
predict 3D Gaussian reconstructions in real time from a single 2D webcam feed,
where the 3D representation is not only live and realistic, but also authentic
to the input video. By conditioning the 3D representation on each video frame
independently, our reconstruction faithfully recreates the input video from the
captured viewpoint (a property we call authenticity), while generalizing
realistically to novel viewpoints. Additionally, we introduce a stability loss
to obtain reconstructions that are temporally stable on video sequences. We
show that our method delivers state-of-the-art accuracy in visual quality and
stability metrics compared to existing methods, and demonstrate our approach in
live one-to-one 3D meetings using only a standard 2D camera and display. This
demonstrates that our approach can allow anyone to communicate volumetrically,
via a method for 3D videoconferencing that is not only highly accessible, but
also realistic and authentic.

Conclusion: GLCP框架通过全局与局部特征结合，有效解决了管状结构分割中的断裂问题，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tubular structures, such as vascular networks, plays
a critical role in various medical domains. A remaining significant challenge
in this task is structural fragmentation, which can adversely impact downstream
applications. Existing methods primarily focus on designing various loss
functions to constrain global topological structures. However, they often
overlook local discontinuity regions, leading to suboptimal segmentation
results. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Global-to-Local
Connectivity Preservation (GLCP) framework that can simultaneously perceive
global and local structural characteristics of tubular networks. Specifically,
we propose an Interactive Multi-head Segmentation (IMS) module to jointly learn
global segmentation, skeleton maps, and local discontinuity maps, respectively.
This enables our model to explicitly target local discontinuity regions while
maintaining global topological integrity. In addition, we design a lightweight
Dual-Attention-based Refinement (DAR) module to further improve segmentation
quality by refining the resulting segmentation maps. Extensive experiments on
both 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our GLCP achieves superior accuracy
and continuity in tubular structure segmentation compared to several
state-of-the-art approaches. The source codes will be available at

Method: 在VQA v2.0数据集上，对GPT-4o、Claude-3.5-Sonnet和Gemini-1.5-Flash三种VLMs添加修饰语并分析其响应。

Result: VLMs的性能在添加修饰语后持续下降。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于揭示VLMs的局限性。

Abstract: We can think of Visual Question Answering as a (multimodal) conversation
between a human and an AI system. Here, we explore the sensitivity of Vision
Language Models (VLMs) through the lens of cooperative principles of
conversation proposed by Grice. Specifically, even when Grice's maxims of
conversation are flouted, humans typically do not have much difficulty in
understanding the conversation even though it requires more cognitive effort.
Here, we study if VLMs are capable of handling violations to Grice's maxims in
a manner that is similar to humans. Specifically, we add modifiers to
human-crafted questions and analyze the response of VLMs to these modifiers. We
use three state-of-the-art VLMs in our study, namely, GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet
and Gemini-1.5-Flash on questions from the VQA v2.0 dataset. Our initial
results seem to indicate that the performance of VLMs consistently diminish
with the addition of modifiers which indicates our approach as a promising
direction to understand the limitations of VLMs.

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a crucial medical imaging modality.
However, long acquisition times remain a significant challenge, leading to
increased costs, and reduced patient comfort. Recent studies have shown the
potential of using deep learning models that incorporate information from prior
subject-specific MRI scans to improve reconstruction quality of present scans.
Integrating this prior information requires registration of the previous scan
to the current image reconstruction, which can be time-consuming. We propose a
novel deep-learning-based MRI reconstruction framework which consists of an
initial reconstruction network, a deep registration model, and a
transformer-based enhancement network. We validated our method on a
longitudinal dataset of T1-weighted MRI scans with 2,808 images from 18
subjects at four acceleration factors (R5, R10, R15, R20). Quantitative metrics
confirmed our approach's superiority over existing methods (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon
signed-rank test). Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of our MRI
reconstruction method on the downstream task of brain segmentation and observed
improved accuracy and volumetric agreement with reference segmentations. Our
approach also achieved a substantial reduction in total reconstruction time
compared to methods that use traditional registration algorithms, making it
more suitable for real-time clinical applications. The code associated with
this work is publicly available at

Abstract: Adapting large Video-Language Models (VLMs) for action detection using only a
few examples poses challenges like overfitting and the granularity mismatch
between scene-level pre-training and required person-centric understanding. We
propose an efficient adaptation strategy combining parameter-efficient tuning
(LoRA) with a novel learnable internal feature augmentation. Applied within the
frozen VLM backbone using FiLM, these augmentations generate diverse feature
variations directly relevant to the task. Additionally, we introduce a
group-weighted loss function that dynamically modulates the training
contribution of each augmented sample based on its prediction divergence
relative to the group average. This promotes robust learning by prioritizing
informative yet reasonable augmentations. We demonstrate our method's
effectiveness on complex multi-label, multi-person action detection datasets
(AVA, MOMA), achieving strong mAP performance and showcasing significant data
efficiency for adapting VLMs from limited examples.

Conclusion: CoP通过多任务协作显著提升了BEV检测性能。

Abstract: Vision-based bird's-eye-view (BEV) 3D object detection has advanced
significantly in autonomous driving by offering cost-effectiveness and rich
contextual information. However, existing methods often construct BEV
representations by collapsing extracted object features, neglecting intrinsic
environmental contexts, such as roads and pavements. This hinders detectors
from comprehensively perceiving the characteristics of the physical world. To
alleviate this, we introduce a multi-task learning framework, Collaborative
Perceiver (CoP), that leverages spatial occupancy as auxiliary information to
mine consistent structural and conceptual similarities shared between 3D object
detection and occupancy prediction tasks, bridging gaps in spatial
representations and feature refinement. To this end, we first propose a
pipeline to generate dense occupancy ground truths incorporating local density
information (LDO) for reconstructing detailed environmental information. Next,
we employ a voxel-height-guided sampling (VHS) strategy to distill fine-grained
local features according to distinct object properties. Furthermore, we develop
a global-local collaborative feature fusion (CFF) module that seamlessly
integrates complementary knowledge between both tasks, thus composing more
robust BEV representations. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark
demonstrate that CoP outperforms existing vision-based frameworks, achieving
49.5\% mAP and 59.2\% NDS on the test set. Code and supplementary materials are

classification using deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for
biodiversity monitoring and conservation. This paper presents a comparative

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在特征对齐时忽略潜在域先验，导致性能不佳，需改进。

Method: PDAF引入潜在域先验（LDP），通过三个模块（LPE、DCM、DPE）建模域偏移并调整特征表示。

Result: 实验验证PDAF在复杂城市场景中的有效性。

Conclusion: PDAF通过迭代建模域偏移，显著提升模型在未见目标域中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) is a critical yet challenging
task, as domain shifts in unseen environments can severely compromise model
performance. While recent studies enhance feature alignment by projecting
features into the source domain, they often neglect intrinsic latent domain
priors, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce PDAF, a
Probabilistic Diffusion Alignment Framework that enhances the generalization of
existing segmentation networks through probabilistic diffusion modeling. PDAF
introduces a Latent Domain Prior (LDP) to capture domain shifts and uses this
prior as a conditioning factor to align both source and unseen target domains.
To achieve this, PDAF integrates into a pre-trained segmentation model and
utilizes paired source and pseudo-target images to simulate latent domain
shifts, enabling LDP modeling. The framework comprises three modules: the
Latent Prior Extractor (LPE) predicts the LDP by supervising domain shifts; the
Domain Compensation Module (DCM) adjusts feature representations to mitigate
domain shifts; and the Diffusion Prior Estimator (DPE) leverages a diffusion
process to estimate the LDP without requiring paired samples. This design
enables PDAF to iteratively model domain shifts, progressively refining feature
representations to enhance generalization under complex target conditions.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PDAF across diverse and
challenging urban scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从2D俯视图生成360度室内全景图在虚拟现实、室内设计等领域有广泛应用，但缺乏明确的3D结构和几何一致性是主要挑战。

Method: Top2Pano通过估计体积占用推断3D结构，使用体积渲染生成粗略全景图，再通过ControlNet进行扩散细化。

Result: 在两个数据集上的评估显示，Top2Pano优于基线方法，能有效重建几何、遮挡和空间布局，并能从示意图生成高质量全景图。

Conclusion: Top2Pano在连接俯视图与沉浸式室内合成方面具有潜力，为相关领域提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Generating immersive 360{\deg} indoor panoramas from 2D top-down views has
applications in virtual reality, interior design, real estate, and robotics.
This task is challenging due to the lack of explicit 3D structure and the need
for geometric consistency and photorealism. We propose Top2Pano, an end-to-end
model for synthesizing realistic indoor panoramas from top-down views. Our
method estimates volumetric occupancy to infer 3D structures, then uses
volumetric rendering to generate coarse color and depth panoramas. These guide
a diffusion-based refinement stage using ControlNet, enhancing realism and
structural fidelity. Evaluations on two datasets show Top2Pano outperforms
baselines, effectively reconstructing geometry, occlusions, and spatial
arrangements. It also generalizes well, producing high-quality panoramas from
schematic floorplans. Our results highlight Top2Pano's potential in bridging
top-down views with immersive indoor synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLaVA-Reward是一种高效的奖励模型，利用预训练的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）自动评估文本到图像（T2I）生成的多维度质量。通过Skip-connection Cross Attention模块增强视觉与文本表示的双向交互，并支持多种偏好数据微调。实验表明其在自动评估和推理扩展方面优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于MLLM的方法需要指令跟随数据进行监督微调，且评估生成质量时依赖文本响应分析，耗时且训练困难。

Method: 直接利用MLLMs的隐藏状态处理文本-图像对，引入SkipCA模块增强视觉与文本的交互，支持配对和非配对偏好数据微调。

Conclusion: LLaVA-Reward在自动评估T2I生成质量和推理扩展方面具有显著优势，为多模态生成评估提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce LLaVA-Reward, an efficient reward model designed to
automatically evaluate text-to-image (T2I) generations across multiple
perspectives, leveraging pretrained multimodal large language models (MLLMs).
Existing MLLM-based approaches require instruction-following data for
supervised fine-tuning and evaluate generation quality on analyzing text
response, which is time-consuming and difficult to train. To address this
problem, we propose LLaVA-Reward, which directly utilizes the hidden states of
MLLMs given text-image pairs. To enhance the bidirectional interaction between
visual and textual representations in decoder-only MLLMs, we further propose
adding a Skip-connection Cross Attention (SkipCA) module. This design enhances
text-image correlation reasoning by connecting early-layer visual features with
later-layer hidden representations.In addition, LLaVA-Reward supports different
types of preference data for efficient fine-tuning, including paired preference
data and unpaired data. We train LLaVA-Reward on four evaluation perspectives:
text-image alignment, fidelity/artifact, safety, and overall ranking. Empirical
results demonstrate that LLaVA-Reward outperforms conventional and MLLM-based
methods in generating human-aligned scores for automatic evaluations and
inference-time scaling in text-to-image generations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对推理阶段，对训练阶段的效率提升有限，ReGATE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，结合参考损失和EMA难度评分，选择性处理关键令牌。

Result: 在VideoLLaMA2上，ReGATE达到标准训练峰值准确率，速度提升2倍，令牌使用量减少35%；进一步训练后，性能超越基线。

Conclusion: ReGATE有效加速MLLM训练，减少令牌数量，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Abstract: The computational cost of training multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
rapidly increases with the number of tokens involved. Existing efficiency
methods primarily target inference and rely on token reduction or merging,
offering limited benefit during training. In this paper, we propose ReGATE
(Reference$-$Guided Adaptive Token Elision), an adaptive token pruning method
for accelerating MLLM training. Specifically, ReGATE adopts a teacher-student
framework in which the MLLM being trained serves as the student, and a frozen
reference large language model (LLM) acts as the teacher. The teacher computes
per-token reference losses, which are combined with an exponential moving
average (EMA) of the student's own difficulty scores. This adaptive
difficulty-based scoring enables the selective processing of crucial tokens
while bypassing less informative ones in the forward pass, significantly
reducing computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ReGATE, when
applied to VideoLLaMA2, matches the peak accuracy of standard training on
MVBench up to 2$\times$ faster, using only 35% of the tokens. With additional
training, it even surpasses the baseline on several multimodal benchmarks, all
while reducing the total token count by over 41%. Code and models will be
released soon.

TL;DR: MapDiffusion提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成方法，用于学习向量化地图的完整分布，解决了传统确定性方法无法捕捉不确定性和环境模糊性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统地图构建模型仅提供确定性点估计，无法处理现实环境中的模糊性（如遮挡和缺失车道标记）。

Method: MapDiffusion利用扩散模型，通过迭代优化随机初始化的查询，生成多个可能的地图样本，并基于BEV潜在网格进行条件生成。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，MapDiffusion在在线地图构建中实现了最先进的性能，单样本性能提升5%，多样本聚合进一步提高了ROC曲线性能。

Conclusion: MapDiffusion通过建模完整地图分布，增强了在线向量化高精地图构建的鲁棒性和可靠性，支持自动驾驶在复杂环境中的不确定性感知决策。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires an understanding of the static environment from
sensor data. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to fuse
multiple inputs, and a vector decoder predicts a vectorized map representation
from the latent BEV grid. However, traditional map construction models provide
deterministic point estimates, failing to capture uncertainty and the inherent
ambiguities of real-world environments, such as occlusions and missing lane
markings. We propose MapDiffusion, a novel generative approach that leverages
the diffusion paradigm to learn the full distribution of possible vectorized
maps. Instead of predicting a single deterministic output from learned queries,
MapDiffusion iteratively refines randomly initialized queries, conditioned on a
BEV latent grid, to generate multiple plausible map samples. This allows
aggregating samples to improve prediction accuracy and deriving uncertainty
estimates that directly correlate with scene ambiguity. Extensive experiments
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapDiffusion achieves state-of-the-art
performance in online map construction, surpassing the baseline by 5% in
single-sample performance. We further show that aggregating multiple samples
consistently improves performance along the ROC curve, validating the benefit
of distribution modeling. Additionally, our uncertainty estimates are
significantly higher in occluded areas, reinforcing their value in identifying
regions with ambiguous sensor input. By modeling the full map distribution,
MapDiffusion enhances the robustness and reliability of online vectorized HD
map construction, enabling uncertainty-aware decision-making for autonomous
vehicles in complex environments.

Method: DuCiSC通过原型对齐实现跨图像语义一致性，并提出自感知置信度估计策略选择可靠伪标签。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证，DuCiSC表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DuCiSC有效解决了半监督医学图像分割中的语义一致性和特征差异问题。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has proven highly effective in tackling the
challenge of limited labeled training data in medical image segmentation. In
general, current approaches, which rely on intra-image pixel-wise consistency
training via pseudo-labeling, overlook the consistency at more comprehensive
semantic levels (e.g., object region) and suffer from severe discrepancy of
extracted features resulting from an imbalanced number of labeled and unlabeled
data. To overcome these limitations, we present a new \underline{Du}al
\underline{C}ross-\underline{i}mage \underline{S}emantic
\underline{C}onsistency (DuCiSC) learning framework, for semi-supervised
medical image segmentation. Concretely, beyond enforcing pixel-wise semantic
consistency, DuCiSC proposes dual paradigms to encourage region-level semantic
consistency across: 1) labeled and unlabeled images; and 2) labeled and fused
images, by explicitly aligning their prototypes. Relying on the dual paradigms,
DuCiSC can effectively establish consistent cross-image semantics via prototype
representations, thereby addressing the feature discrepancy issue. Moreover, we
devise a novel self-aware confidence estimation strategy to accurately select
reliable pseudo labels, allowing for exploiting the training dynamics of
unlabeled data. Our DuCiSC method is extensively validated on four datasets,
including two popular binary benchmarks in segmenting the left atrium and
pancreas, a multi-class Automatic Cardiac Diagnosis Challenge dataset, and a
challenging scenario of segmenting the inferior alveolar nerve that features
complicated anatomical structures, showing superior segmentation results over
previous state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种递归视觉想象（RVI）和自适应语言对齐（ALG）技术，用于提升视觉语言导航（VLN）任务中的导航策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLN代理在场景表示和视觉-语言对齐方面存在问题，导致导航行为偏离语言指令。

Method: 通过递归总结视觉感知并建模历史轨迹为紧凑神经网格，结合RVI和ALG技术优化导航策略。

Result: 在VLN-CE和ObjectNav任务上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RVI和ALG技术显著提升了VLN任务的性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) typically requires agents to navigate to
specified objects or remote regions in unknown scenes by obeying linguistic
commands. Such tasks require organizing historical visual observations for
linguistic grounding, which is critical for long-sequence navigational
decisions. However, current agents suffer from overly detailed scene
representation and ambiguous vision-language alignment, which weaken their
comprehension of navigation-friendly high-level scene priors and easily lead to
behaviors that violate linguistic commands. To tackle these issues, we propose
a navigation policy by recursively summarizing along-the-way visual
perceptions, which are adaptively aligned with commands to enhance linguistic
grounding. In particular, by structurally modeling historical trajectories as
compact neural grids, several Recursive Visual Imagination (RVI) techniques are
proposed to motivate agents to focus on the regularity of visual transitions
and semantic scene layouts, instead of dealing with misleading geometric
details. Then, an Adaptive Linguistic Grounding (ALG) technique is proposed to
align the learned situational memories with different linguistic components
purposefully. Such fine-grained semantic matching facilitates the accurate
anticipation of navigation actions and progress. Our navigation policy
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the challenging VLN-CE and
ObjectNav tasks, showing the superiority of our RVI and ALG techniques for VLN.

Conclusion: 自监督数据集蒸馏方法能有效提取数据集的关键信息，生成更紧凑且泛化能力强的蒸馏集。

Abstract: Although larger datasets are crucial for training large deep models, the
rapid growth of dataset size has brought a significant challenge in terms of
considerable training costs, which even results in prohibitive computational
expenses. Dataset Distillation becomes a popular technique recently to reduce
the dataset size via learning a highly compact set of representative exemplars,
where the model trained with these exemplars ideally should have comparable
performance with respect to the one trained with the full dataset. While most
of existing works upon dataset distillation focus on supervised datasets, we
instead aim to distill images and their self-supervisedly trained
representations into a distilled set. This procedure, named as Self-Supervised
Dataset Distillation, effectively extracts rich information from real datasets,
yielding the distilled sets with enhanced cross-architecture generalizability.
Particularly, in order to preserve the key characteristics of original dataset
more faithfully and compactly, several novel techniques are proposed: 1) we
introduce an innovative parameterization upon images and representations via
distinct low-dimensional bases, where the base selection for parameterization
is experimentally shown to play a crucial role; 2) we tackle the instability
induced by the randomness of data augmentation -- a key component in
self-supervised learning but being underestimated in the prior work of
self-supervised dataset distillation -- by utilizing predetermined
augmentations; 3) we further leverage a lightweight network to model the
connections among the representations of augmented views from the same image,
leading to more compact pairs of distillation. Extensive experiments conducted
on various datasets validate the superiority of our approach in terms of
distillation efficiency, cross-architecture generalization, and transfer
learning performance.

Result: ATINet在单目标跟踪中达到最优性能，并成功扩展到多目标跟踪。

Conclusion: ESI和ATINet有效提升了光场在低光场景中的角-时域建模能力，为复杂场景感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature
modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative
spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments
still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain,
particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel
light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly
defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the
abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this
representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce
redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an
angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking
that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues
and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can
also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature
interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale
light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation
demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object
tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object
tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field
angular-temporal modeling.

Motivation: 现有方法在开放集3D物体检索中因训练数据不足而难以生成泛化表示，而CLIP在图像-文本对上的预训练提供了广泛的下游任务泛化能力。

Method: DAC框架利用多视角图像，通过CLIP和MLLM的协同作用学习3D表示，并引入AB-LoRA技术减少过拟合。

Result: DAC在四个开放集3DOR数据集上平均提升了10.01%的mAP，并在图像基础和跨数据集设置中验证了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: DAC通过简单有效的框架显著提升了开放集3D物体检索的性能，展示了其在泛化能力上的优势。

Abstract: Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D
objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods
typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view
images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still
struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training
data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP
inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream
tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named
Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set
3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large
language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM
is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to
align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it
provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues
during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias
Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further
enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images,
DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four
open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on
image-based and cross-dataset setups. Code is available at

Conclusion: VAGU和GtS为视频异常检测提供了更全面的解决方案，JeAUG弥补了传统指标的不足。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify anomalous events in videos and
accurately determine their time intervals. Current VAD methods mainly fall into
two categories: traditional DNN-based approaches that focus on temporal
localization, and LLM-based approaches that emphasize semantic understanding.
Both anomaly understanding and grounding are essential for comprehensive video
anomaly detection and can complement each other. However, no existing model or
dataset supports both tasks simultaneously. To address this, we introduce VAGU
(Video Anomaly Grounding and Understanding), the first benchmark to integrate
both tasks. Each VAGU instance includes annotations for anomaly category,
semantic explanation, precise temporal grounding and Video QA. We also provide
multiple-choice Video QA for objective evaluation. Based on this dataset, we
propose Glance then Scrutinize (GtS), a training-free framework guided by
textual prompts. The framework first enables coarse localization of
high-probability anomalous regions, followed by detailed anomaly interpretation
and temporal boundary refinement. Additionally, we propose the JeAUG metric,
which jointly evaluates semantic interpretability and temporal precision,
overcoming the limitations of traditional metrics. Extensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our benchmark, framework, and evaluation metric.

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has emerged as a powerful approach for minimizing
labeling costs by selectively sampling the most informative data for neural
network model development. Effective AL for large-scale vision-language models
necessitates addressing challenges in uncertainty estimation and efficient
sampling given the vast number of parameters involved. In this work, we
introduce a novel parameter-efficient learning methodology that incorporates
uncertainty calibration loss within the AL framework. We propose a
differentiable loss function that promotes uncertainty calibration for
effectively selecting fewer and most informative data samples for fine-tuning.
Through extensive experiments across several datasets and vision backbones, we
demonstrate that our solution can match and exceed the performance of complex
feature-based sampling techniques while being computationally very efficient.
Additionally, we investigate the efficacy of Prompt learning versus Low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) in sample selection, providing a detailed comparative
analysis of these methods in the context of efficient AL.

Abstract: Cooking process visualization is a promising task in the intersection of
image generation and food analysis, which aims to generate an image for each
cooking step of a recipe. However, most existing works focus on generating
images of finished foods based on the given recipes, and face two challenges to
visualize the cooking process. First, the appearance of ingredients changes
variously across cooking steps, it is difficult to generate the correct
appearances of foods that match the textual description, leading to semantic
inconsistency. Second, the current step might depend on the operations of
previous step, it is crucial to maintain the contextual coherence of images in
sequential order. In this work, we present a cooking process visualization
model, called Chain-of-Cooking. Specifically, to generate correct appearances
of ingredients, we present a Dynamic Patch Selection Module to retrieve
previously generated image patches as references, which are most related to
current textual contents. Furthermore, to enhance the coherence and keep the
rational order of generated images, we propose a Semantic Evolution Module and
a Bidirectional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Guidance. To better utilize the
semantics of previous texts, the Semantic Evolution Module establishes the
semantical association between latent prompts and current cooking step, and
merges it with the latent features. Then the CoT Guidance updates the merged
features to guide the current cooking step remain coherent with the previous
step. Moreover, we construct a dataset named CookViz, consisting of
intermediate image-text pairs for the cooking process. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in
generating coherent and semantic consistent cooking process.

Motivation: 深度伪造检测模型需要泛化到不断演变的伪造技术，但联合训练原始和在线合成伪造数据可能导致性能下降，这与传统观点矛盾。

Method: 提出CS-DFD框架，包含更新向量搜索（UVS）模块和冲突梯度减少（CGR）模块，分别优化梯度更新和特征嵌入空间。

Conclusion: CS-DFD通过抑制梯度冲突，显著提升了深度伪造检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Robust deepfake detection models must be capable of generalizing to
ever-evolving manipulation techniques beyond training data. A promising
strategy is to augment the training data with online synthesized fake images
containing broadly generalizable artifacts. However, in the context of deepfake
detection, it is surprising that jointly training on both original and online
synthesized forgeries may result in degraded performance. This contradicts the
common belief that incorporating more source-domain data should enhance
detection accuracy. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to
gradient conflicts during backpropagation which force a trade-off between
source domain accuracy and target domain generalization. To overcome this
issue, we propose a Conflict-Suppressed Deepfake Detection (CS-DFD) framework
that explicitly mitigates the gradient conflict via two synergistic modules.
First, an Update Vector Search (UVS) module searches for an alternative update
vector near the initial gradient vector to reconcile the disparities of the
original and online synthesized forgeries. By further transforming the search
process into an extremum optimization problem, UVS yields the uniquely update
vector, which maximizes the simultaneous loss reductions for each data type.
Second, a Conflict Gradient Reduction (CGR) module enforces a low-conflict
feature embedding space through a novel Conflict Descent Loss. This loss
penalizes misaligned gradient directions and guides the learning of
representations with aligned, non-conflicting gradients. The synergy of UVS and
CGR alleviates gradient interference in both parameter optimization and
representation learning. Experiments on multiple deepfake benchmarks
demonstrate that CS-DFD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain
detection accuracy and cross-domain generalization.

Abstract: Attitude sensors determine the spacecraft attitude through the sensing of an
astronomical object, field or other phenomena. The Sun and fixed stars are the
two primary astronomical sensing objects. Attitude sensors are critical
components for the survival and knowledge improvement of spacecraft. Of these,
sun sensors are the most common and important sensor for spacecraft attitude
determination. The sun sensor measures the Sun vector in spacecraft
coordinates. The sun sensor calibration process is particularly difficult due
to the complex nature of the uncertainties involved. The uncertainties are
small, difficult to observe, and vary spatio-temporally over the lifecycle of
the sensor. In addition, the sensors are affected by numerous sources of
uncertainties, including manufacturing, electrical, environmental, and
interference sources. This motivates the development of advanced calibration
algorithms to minimize uncertainty over the sensor lifecycle and improve
accuracy. Although modeling and calibration techniques for sun sensors have
been explored extensively in the literature over the past two decades, there is
currently no resource that consolidates and systematically reviews this body of
work. The present review proposes a systematic mapping of sun sensor modeling
and calibration algorithms across a breadth of sensor configurations. It
specifically provides a comprehensive survey of each methodology, along with an
analysis of research gaps and recommendations for future directions in sun
sensor modeling and calibration techniques.

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection is critical in industrial quality inspection. While
existing methods achieve notable progress, their performance degrades in
high-precision 3D anomaly detection due to insufficient global information. To
address this, we propose Multi-View Reconstruction (MVR), a method that

information learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
MVR, achieving 89.6\% object-wise AU-ROC and 95.7\% point-wise AU-ROC on the
Real3D-AD benchmark.

TL;DR: RelMap是一个端到端框架，通过结合空间关系和语义先验，提升在线高清地图构建的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法忽视了地图元素间的空间和语义关系，限制了性能。

Method: 提出Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior和Mixture-of-Experts-based Semantic Prior，分别编码空间关系和优化语义特征解码。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse 2数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: RelMap通过显式建模关系和语义先验，显著提升了在线地图构建的效果。

Abstract: Online high-definition (HD) map construction plays an increasingly important
role in scaling autonomous driving systems. Transformer-based methods have
become prevalent in online HD map construction; however, existing approaches
often neglect the inherent spatial and semantic relationships among map
elements, which limits their accuracy and generalization. To address this, we
propose RelMap, an end-to-end framework that enhances online map construction
by incorporating spatial relations and semantic priors. We introduce a
Class-aware Spatial Relation Prior, which explicitly encodes relative
positional dependencies between map elements using a learnable class-aware
relation encoder. Additionally, we propose a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based
Semantic Prior, which routes features to class-specific experts based on
predicted class probabilities, refining instance feature decoding. Our method
is compatible with both single-frame and temporal perception backbones,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2
datasets.

TL;DR: LinDeps是一种新型的后剪枝方法，通过线性依赖分析优化CNN剪枝，提高压缩率并保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN的规模和复杂性增加，导致在资源受限平台上部署困难，现有剪枝技术忽略了特征图间的结构依赖，导致剪枝效果不佳。

Method: LinDeps利用主元QR分解检测并剪枝线性依赖的滤波器，并通过信号恢复机制调整下一层内核，无需微调。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet上的实验表明，LinDeps提高了现有剪枝技术的压缩率并保持性能，尤其在低资源环境下表现优异。

Conclusion: LinDeps是当前和未来剪枝技术的重要补充，显著提升了剪枝效果和推理速度。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are widely used in many computer vision
tasks. Yet, their increasing size and complexity pose significant challenges
for efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms. Hence, network
pruning has emerged as an effective way of reducing the size and computational
requirements of neural networks by removing redundant or unimportant
parameters. However, a fundamental challenge with pruning consists in optimally
removing redundancies without degrading performance. Most existing pruning
techniques overlook structural dependencies across feature maps within a layer,
resulting in suboptimal pruning decisions. In this work, we introduce LinDeps,
a novel post-pruning method, i.e., a pruning method that can be applied on top
of any pruning technique, which systematically identifies and removes redundant
filters via linear dependency analysis. Particularly, LinDeps applies pivoted
QR decomposition to feature maps to detect and prune linearly dependent
filters. Then, a novel signal recovery mechanism adjusts the next layer's
kernels to preserve compatibility and performance without requiring any
fine-tuning. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet with VGG and ResNet
backbones demonstrate that LinDeps improves compression rates of existing
pruning techniques while preserving performances, leading to a new state of the
art in CNN pruning. We also benchmark LinDeps in low-resource setups where no
retraining can be performed, which shows significant pruning improvements and
inference speedups over a state-of-the-art method. LinDeps therefore
constitutes an essential add-on for any current or future pruning technique.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARS是一种基于token自适应偏好的策略，通过将DPO重新定义为min-max优化问题，减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，提升视觉信息的因果关联性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPO策略在处理幻觉问题时依赖静态监督信号，容易过拟合语言线索，导致视觉信息关联性不足。

Method: TARS通过最大化token级分布偏移并最小化偏好损失，模拟对齐不确定性，同时保留因果关联性。

Result: TARS在多个幻觉基准测试中表现优异，仅需4.8k偏好样本即可将幻觉率从26.4%降至13.2%。

Conclusion: TARS显著减少了多模态推理中的幻觉问题，性能优于标准DPO，并在关键指标上媲美GPT-4o。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) enable vision-language reasoning,
yet often generate plausible outputs that are factually incorrect or visually
ungrounded, thereby compromising their reliability. Direct preference
optimization (DPO) is a common strategy for correcting hallucinations by
aligning model outputs with human preferences. Existing DPO strategies
typically treat hallucination-related preferences as fixed targets, relying on
static supervision signals during training. This approach tends to overfit to
superficial linguistic cues in preference data, leading to distributional
rigidity and spurious correlations that impair grounding in causally relevant
visual information. To overcome this limitation, we propose TARS, a
token-adaptive preference strategy that reformulates DPO as a min-max
optimization problem. TARS maximizes token-level distributional shifts under
semantic constraints to simulate alignment uncertainty, and simultaneously
minimizes the expected preference loss under these controlled perturbations.
This joint objective preserves causal grounding while mitigating overfitting to
preference patterns, thereby reducing hallucinations in multimodal reasoning.
We evaluate TARS on multiple hallucination benchmarks and find consistently
strong performance. Using only 4.8k preference samples and no expert feedback,
TARS reduces hallucination rates from 26.4% to 13.2% and decreases cognition
value from 2.5 to 0.4. It outperforms standard DPO and matches GPT-4o on
several key metrics.

Conclusion: 本文为熟悉WSSS基础的研究者提供了当前进展和方法创新的深入见解，并提出了未来研究的几个方向。

Abstract: Unlike fully supervised semantic segmentation, weakly supervised semantic
segmentation (WSSS) relies on weaker forms of supervision to perform dense
prediction tasks. Among the various types of weak supervision, WSSS with image
level annotations is considered both the most challenging and the most
practical, attracting significant research attention. Therefore, in this
review, we focus on WSSS with image level annotations. Additionally, this
review concentrates on mainstream research directions, deliberately omitting
less influential branches.
  Given the rapid development of new methods and the limitations of existing
surveys in capturing recent trends, there is a pressing need for an updated and
comprehensive review. Our goal is to fill this gap by synthesizing the latest
advancements and state-of-the-art techniques in WSSS with image level labels.
  Basically, we provide a comprehensive review of recent advancements in WSSS
with image level labels, categorizing existing methods based on the types and
levels of additional supervision involved. We also examine the challenges of
applying advanced methods to domain specific datasets in WSSS,a topic that
remains underexplored. Finally, we discuss the current challenges, evaluate the
limitations of existing approaches, and outline several promising directions
for future research. This review is intended for researchers who are already
familiar with the fundamental concepts of WSSS and are seeking to deepen their
understanding of current advances and methodological innovations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于局部老化特征的细粒度人脸老化方法，解决了现有方法忽略面部区域异质性老化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸老化方法通常将老化视为全局同质过程，忽略了面部区域因内在和外在因素导致的异质性老化。

Method: 利用潜在扩散模型选择性老化特定面部区域，并通过潜在扩散细化器无缝融合局部老化区域，实现全局一致的自然合成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在身份保持、高保真图像生成和自然可控的老化过程方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更真实、个性化的人脸老化，满足了身份保持、高保真和自然老化等关键标准。

Abstract: We present a novel approach to face aging that addresses the limitations of
current methods which treat aging as a global, homogeneous process. Existing
techniques using GANs and diffusion models often condition generation on a
reference image and target age, neglecting that facial regions age
heterogeneously due to both intrinsic chronological factors and extrinsic
elements like sun exposure. Our method leverages latent diffusion models to
selectively age specific facial regions using local aging signs. This approach
provides significantly finer-grained control over the generation process,
enabling more realistic and personalized aging. We employ a latent diffusion
refiner to seamlessly blend these locally aged regions, ensuring a globally
consistent and natural-looking synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that
our method effectively achieves three key criteria for successful face aging:
robust identity preservation, high-fidelity and realistic imagery, and a
natural, controllable aging progression.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为{\tracker}的自监督跟踪框架，无需框标注即可学习通用跟踪表示，显著优于现有自监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪数据集依赖人工框标注，成本高且限制了数据规模和多样性。

Method: 采用解耦的时空一致性训练框架，结合全局空间定位和局部时间关联，设计实例对比损失以学习多视角实例级对应关系。

Result: 在九个基准数据集上表现优异，AUC（AO）分数在GOT10K、LaSOT和TrackingNet上分别提升25.3%、20.4%和14.8%。

Conclusion: {\tracker}通过自监督学习有效减少对框标注的依赖，为视觉跟踪提供了新的设计范式。

Abstract: The success of visual tracking has been largely driven by datasets with
manual box annotations. However, these box annotations require tremendous human
effort, limiting the scale and diversity of existing tracking datasets. In this
work, we present a novel Self-Supervised Tracking framework named
\textbf{{\tracker}}, designed to eliminate the need of box annotations.
Specifically, a decoupled spatio-temporal consistency training framework is
proposed to learn rich target information across timestamps through global
spatial localization and local temporal association. This allows for the
simulation of appearance and motion variations of instances in real-world
scenarios. Furthermore, an instance contrastive loss is designed to learn
instance-level correspondences from a multi-view perspective, offering robust
instance supervision without additional labels. This new design paradigm
enables {\tracker} to effectively learn generic tracking representations in a
self-supervised manner, while reducing reliance on extensive box annotations.
Extensive experiments on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that {\tracker}
surpasses \textit{SOTA} self-supervised tracking methods, achieving an
improvement of more than 25.3\%, 20.4\%, and 14.8\% in AUC (AO) score on the
GOT10K, LaSOT, TrackingNet datasets, respectively. Code:

Motivation: 研究旨在验证在医学图像分割任务中，简单模型是否能在特定条件下优于复杂的大规模基础模型。

Method: 使用精心配置的DeepLabv3模型进行iPS细胞集落分割，并与SAM2和MedSAM2进行对比。

Result: DeepLabv3在低对比度边界的分割任务中表现更优，表明模型复杂度不总是与性能正相关。

Conclusion: 在特定生物医学应用中，简单且适配的模型可能提供更高的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires not only accuracy but also robustness
under challenging imaging conditions. In this study, we show that a carefully
configured DeepLabv3 model can achieve high performance in segmenting induced
pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies, and, under our experimental conditions,
outperforms large-scale foundation models such as SAM2 and its medical variant
MedSAM2 without structural modifications. These results suggest that, for
specialized tasks characterized by subtle, low-contrast boundaries, increased
model complexity does not necessarily translate to better performance. Our work
revisits the assumption that ever-larger and more generalized architectures are
always preferable, and provides evidence that appropriately adapted, simpler
models may offer strong accuracy and practical reliability in domain-specific
biomedical applications. We also offer an open-source implementation that
includes strategies for small datasets and domain-specific encoding, with the
aim of supporting further advances in semantic segmentation for regenerative
medicine and related fields.

Conclusion: 合成数据方法有效提升了模型性能，适用于复杂场景的风力涡轮机检测。

Abstract: For the autonomous drone-based inspection of wind turbine (WT) blades,
accurate detection of the WT and its key features is essential for safe drone
positioning and collision avoidance. Existing deep learning methods typically
rely on manually labeled real-world images, which limits both the quantity and
the diversity of training datasets in terms of weather conditions, lighting,
turbine types, and image complexity. In this paper, we propose a method to
generate synthetic training data that allows controlled variation of visual and
environmental factors, increasing the diversity and hence creating challenging
learning scenarios. Furthermore, we train a YOLOv11 feature detection network
solely on synthetic WT images with a modified loss function, to detect WTs and
their key features within an image. The resulting network is evaluated both
using synthetic images and a set of real-world WT images and shows promising
performance across both synthetic and real-world data, achieving a Pose
mAP50-95 of 0.97 on real images never seen during training.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在IAD中表现有限，需要领域特定适应以提高其有效性。

Result: 在MMAD基准测试中，EMIT显著提升MLLMs的IAD性能，平均提升7.77%。

Conclusion: EMIT通过难度感知GRPO和多模态数据增强，有效提升了MLLMs在IAD任务中的表现。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) plays a crucial role in maintaining the
safety and reliability of manufacturing systems. While multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) show strong vision-language reasoning abilities, their
effectiveness in IAD remains limited without domain-specific adaptation. In
this work, we propose EMIT, a unified framework that enhances MLLMs for IAD via
difficulty-aware group relative policy optimization (GRPO). EMIT constructs a
multi-task IAD dataset and utilizes GPT-generated object text descriptions to
compensate for missing defective images. For few-shot anomaly detection, it
integrates a soft prompt and heatmap-guided contrastive embeddings derived from
patch-level comparisons. To better handle difficult data samples, i.e., cases
where the MLLM struggles to generate correct answers, we propose a
difficulty-aware GRPO that extends the original GRPO by incorporating a
response resampling strategy to ensure the inclusion of correct answers in the
sampled responses, as well as an advantage reweighting mechanism to strengthen
learning from such difficult data samples. Extensive experiments on the MMAD
benchmark demonstrate that EMIT significantly enhances the IAD performance of
MLLMs, achieving an average improvement of 7.77\% over the base model
(InternVL3-8B) across seven tasks.

Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的多模态修复方法需要架构修改和重新训练，计算成本高；而上下文感知方法虽无需训练，但缺乏对掩码区域的精细控制，导致语义不一致或视觉不合理。

Result: 实验表明，GuidPaint在定性和定量评估中均优于现有上下文感知修复方法。

Conclusion: GuidPaint通过类别引导和采样策略的结合，显著提升了图像修复的质量和可控性。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have been widely adopted for image
inpainting tasks due to their powerful generative capabilities, achieving
impressive results. Existing multimodal inpainting methods based on diffusion
models often require architectural modifications and retraining, resulting in
high computational cost. In contrast, context-aware diffusion inpainting
methods leverage the model's inherent priors to adjust intermediate denoising
steps, enabling high-quality inpainting without additional training and
significantly reducing computation. However, these methods lack fine-grained
control over the masked regions, often leading to semantically inconsistent or
visually implausible content. To address this issue, we propose GuidPaint, a
training-free, class-guided image inpainting framework. By incorporating
classifier guidance into the denoising process, GuidPaint enables precise
control over intermediate generations within the masked areas, ensuring both
semantic consistency and visual realism. Furthermore, it integrates stochastic
and deterministic sampling, allowing users to select preferred intermediate
results and deterministically refine them. Experimental results demonstrate
that GuidPaint achieves clear improvements over existing context-aware
inpainting methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

LLMs, VAD has undergone significant transformations in terms of data
annotation, input modalities, model architectures, and task objectives. The

empowered by LLMs, constructing a classification system, and comparing their
strengths and weaknesses. Building on this foundation, this paper focuses on
current VAD methods based on MLLMs/LLMs. Finally, based on the trajectory of
technological advancements and existing bottlenecks, this paper distills key
challenges and outlines future research directions, offering guidance for the
VAD community.

Abstract: Monitoring benthic biodiversity in Antarctica is vital for understanding
ecological change in response to climate-driven pressures. This work is
typically performed using high-resolution imagery captured in situ, though
manual annotation of such data remains laborious and specialised, impeding
large-scale analysis. We present a tailored object detection framework for
identifying and classifying Antarctic benthic organisms in high-resolution
towed camera imagery, alongside the first public computer vision dataset for
benthic biodiversity monitoring in the Weddell Sea. Our approach addresses key
challenges associated with marine ecological imagery, including limited
annotated data, variable object sizes, and complex seafloor structure. The
proposed framework combines resolution-preserving patching, spatial data
augmentation, fine-tuning, and postprocessing via Slicing Aided Hyper
Inference. We benchmark multiple object detection architectures and demonstrate
strong performance in detecting medium and large organisms across 25
fine-grained morphotypes, significantly more than other works in this area.
Detection of small and rare taxa remains a challenge, reflecting limitations in
current detection architectures. Our framework provides a scalable foundation
for future machine-assisted in situ benthic biodiversity monitoring research.

Result: APT生成的高分辨率图像细节更清晰，采样速度更快，质量损失最小。

Conclusion: APT为高分辨率图像生成提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are generally trained at fixed resolutions,
limiting their capability when scaling up to high-resolution images. While
training-based approaches address this limitation by training on
high-resolution datasets, they require large amounts of data and considerable
computational resources, making them less practical. Consequently,
training-free methods, particularly patch-based approaches, have become a
popular alternative. These methods divide an image into patches and fuse the
denoising paths of each patch, showing strong performance on high-resolution
generation. However, we observe two critical issues for patch-based approaches,
which we call ``patch-level distribution shift" and ``increased patch
monotonicity." To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Path Tracing (APT),
a framework that combines Statistical Matching to ensure patch distributions
remain consistent in upsampled latents and Scale-aware Scheduling to deal with
the patch monotonicity. As a result, APT produces clearer and more refined
details in high-resolution images. In addition, APT enables a shortcut
denoising process, resulting in faster sampling with minimal quality
degradation. Our experimental results confirm that APT produces more detailed
outputs with improved inference speed, providing a practical approach to

TL;DR: 提出了一种分步框架，通过身份阻断和医学语义补偿解决医学图像去标识化问题，并引入特征解耦策略提升隐私保护效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去标识化方法未能充分保留医学语义且缺乏隐私级别灵活性，需改进。

Method: 分两步：身份阻断（调整隐私级别）和医学语义补偿（利用预训练医学基础模型）；引入特征解耦策略去除残留身份信息。

Result: 在七个数据集和三个下游任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在隐私保护和医学语义保留上达到先进水平。

Abstract: Medical imaging has significantly advanced computer-aided diagnosis, yet its
re-identification (ReID) risks raise critical privacy concerns, calling for
de-identification (DeID) techniques. Unfortunately, existing DeID methods
neither particularly preserve medical semantics, nor are flexibly adjustable
towards different privacy levels. To address these issues, we propose a
divide-and-conquer framework comprising two steps: (1) Identity-Blocking, which
blocks varying proportions of identity-related regions, to achieve different
privacy levels; and (2) Medical-Semantics-Compensation, which leverages
pre-trained Medical Foundation Models (MFMs) to extract medical semantic
features to compensate the blocked regions. Moreover, recognizing that features
from MFMs may still contain residual identity information, we introduce a
Minimum Description Length principle-based feature decoupling strategy, to
effectively decouple and discard such identity components. Extensive
evaluations against existing approaches across seven datasets and three
downstream tasks, demonstrates our state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像因光吸收、散射、海洋生物和碎片等问题导致视觉退化，增强图像对水下车辆路径检测和自主导航等任务至关重要。

Method: 提出了一种针对水下环境的评估框架，结合实用的匹配策略，分析现有方法的优缺点及其实际应用中的局限性。

Result: 通过度量分析，揭示了现有方法的不足，并展示了视觉改进对SLAM算法性能的实际影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为水下图像增强方法提供了上下文感知的基准，验证了其在真实水下场景中的实用性。

Abstract: We introduce local matching stability and furthest matchable frame as
quantitative measures for evaluating the success of underwater image
enhancement. This enhancement process addresses visual degradation caused by
light absorption, scattering, marine growth, and debris. Enhanced imagery plays
a critical role in downstream tasks such as path detection and autonomous
navigation for underwater vehicles, relying on robust feature extraction and
frame matching. To assess the impact of enhancement techniques on
frame-matching performance, we propose a novel evaluation framework tailored to
underwater environments. Through metric-based analysis, we identify strengths
and limitations of existing approaches and pinpoint gaps in their assessment of
real-world applicability. By incorporating a practical matching strategy, our
framework offers a robust, context-aware benchmark for comparing enhancement
methods. Finally, we demonstrate how visual improvements affect the performance
of a complete real-world algorithm -- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) -- reinforcing the framework's relevance to operational underwater
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文通过神经科学启发的消融研究，分析了三种检测Transformer模型（DETR、DDETR、DINO）内部组件的作用，揭示了模型对消融的敏感性和冗余性，为模型优化和可解释性提供了新见解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管可解释AI在复杂模型（如检测Transformer）中取得进展，但内部组件的具体作用仍不清楚，这对提升透明度和效率至关重要。

Method: 采用神经科学中的消融研究方法，系统地分析了DETR、DDETR和DINO模型中关键组件（如查询嵌入、MHSA和MHCA层）对性能的影响。

Result: 发现模型对消融的敏感性不同：DETR对编码器MHSA和解码器MHCA敏感，DDETR因多尺度可变形注意力更鲁棒，DINO因知识分布机制最稳健。同时发现DDETR和DINO的解码器MHCA层存在冗余。

Conclusion: 研究明确了检测Transformer内部组件的作用，为模型优化和可解释性提供了新方向，并发布了DeepDissect库以支持未来研究。

Abstract: In recent years, Explainable AI has gained traction as an approach to
enhancing model interpretability and transparency, particularly in complex
models such as detection transformers. Despite rapid advancements, a
substantial research gap remains in understanding the distinct roles of
internal components - knowledge that is essential for improving transparency
and efficiency. Inspired by neuroscientific ablation studies, which investigate
the functions of brain regions through selective impairment, we systematically
analyze the impact of ablating key components in three state-of-the-art
detection transformer models: Detection transformer (DETR), deformable
detection transformer (DDETR), and DETR with improved denoising anchor boxes
(DINO). The ablations target query embeddings, encoder and decoder multi-head
self-attentions (MHSA) as well as decoder multi-head cross-attention (MHCA)
layers. We evaluate the effects of these ablations on the performance metrics
gIoU and F1-score, quantifying effects on both the classification and
regression sub-tasks on the COCO dataset. To facilitate reproducibility and
future research, we publicly release the DeepDissect library. Our findings
reveal model-specific resilience patterns: while DETR is particularly sensitive
to ablations in encoder MHSA and decoder MHCA, DDETR's multi-scale deformable
attention enhances robustness, and DINO exhibits the greatest resilience due to
its look-forward twice update rule, which helps distributing knowledge across
blocks. These insights also expose structural redundancies, particularly in
DDETR's and DINO's decoder MHCA layers, highlighting opportunities for model
simplification without sacrificing performance. This study advances XAI for
DETRs by clarifying the contributions of internal components to model
performance, offering insights to optimize and improve transparency and
efficiency in critical applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于SAM2的视频目标跟踪模型SAMITE，通过原型记忆库和位置提示生成器解决现有方法在遮挡和干扰方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模板匹配方法忽略时间依赖性，自回归方法对训练类别有偏，泛化性差。SAMITE旨在解决这些问题，并进一步应对遮挡和干扰挑战。

Method: SAMITE基于SAM2，引入原型记忆库量化跟踪结果的正确性，并生成位置提示以减少干扰影响。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，SAMITE表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: SAMITE通过改进记忆机制和位置提示，显著提升了目标跟踪的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous
driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be
roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where
the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the
latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training,
showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some
methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the
tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the
rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail
to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not
have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle
them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules,
including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the
feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results,
and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of
occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate,
their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept
error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the
impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to
provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate
tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing
the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at

Result: 在MME、MMBench和SEED等基准测试中表现优于同类工作。

Conclusion: MAGE通过创新对齐机制显著提升多模态模型的性能与输出能力。

Abstract: In the latest advancements in multimodal learning, effectively addressing the
spatial and semantic losses of visual data after encoding remains a critical
challenge. This is because the performance of large multimodal models is
positively correlated with the coupling between visual encoders and large
language models. Existing approaches often face issues such as vector gaps or
semantic disparities, resulting in information loss during the propagation
process. To address these issues, we propose MAGE (Multimodal Alignment and
Generation Enhancement), a novel framework that bridges the semantic spaces of
vision and text through an innovative alignment mechanism. By introducing the
Intelligent Alignment Network (IAN), MAGE achieves dimensional and semantic
alignment. To reduce the gap between synonymous heterogeneous data, we employ a
training strategy that combines cross-entropy and mean squared error,
significantly enhancing the alignment effect. Moreover, to enhance MAGE's
"Any-to-Any" capability, we developed a fine-tuning dataset for multimodal
tool-calling instructions to expand the model's output capability boundaries.
Finally, our proposed multimodal large model architecture, MAGE, achieved
significantly better performance compared to similar works across various
evaluation benchmarks, including MME, MMBench, and SEED. Complete code and
appendix are available at: https://github.com/GTCOM-NLP/MAGE.

TL;DR: AdvRF提出了一种对抗性重建反馈框架，用于学习类别无关的差异表示，解决了现有细粒度图像检索方法因依赖预定义类别而泛化能力受限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有细粒度图像检索方法依赖于预定义类别的监督，导致检索表示中引入类别特定语义，限制了其对未见类别的泛化能力。

Method: AdvRF通过结合检索模型的类别感知差异定位和重建模型的类别无关特征学习，将细粒度图像检索重新定义为视觉差异重建任务。通过对抗性反馈机制，优化差异定位和重建能力。

Result: AdvRF在细粒度和粗粒度数据集上均表现出色。

Conclusion: AdvRF通过学习类别无关的差异表示，显著提升了细粒度图像检索的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing fine-grained image retrieval (FGIR) methods predominantly rely on
supervision from predefined categories to learn discriminative representations
for retrieving fine-grained objects. However, they inadvertently introduce
category-specific semantics into the retrieval representation, creating
semantic dependencies on predefined classes that critically hinder
generalization to unseen categories. To tackle this, we propose AdvRF, a novel
adversarial reconstruction feedback framework aimed at learning
category-agnostic discrepancy representations. Specifically, AdvRF reformulates
FGIR as a visual discrepancy reconstruction task via synergizing category-aware
discrepancy localization from retrieval models with category-agnostic feature
learning from reconstruction models. The reconstruction model exposes residual
discrepancies overlooked by the retrieval model, forcing it to improve
localization accuracy, while the refined signals from the retrieval model guide
the reconstruction model to improve its reconstruction ability. Consequently,
the retrieval model localizes visual differences, while the reconstruction
model encodes these differences into category-agnostic representations. This
representation is then transferred to the retrieval model through knowledge
distillation for efficient deployment. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
demonstrate that our AdvRF achieves impressive performance on both widely-used
fine-grained and coarse-grained datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于少量样本的强化学习框架（RLVR），用于卫星图像任务，无需标注数据，仅需轻量级规则奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域（如遥感）中标注数据稀缺且昂贵的问题，提升模型在数据稀缺场景下的性能。

Method: 采用策略梯度优化，仅需一个样本即可对齐模型输出，结合规则奖励（如IoU）进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，仅需一个样本即可显著提升性能，128样本时性能与数千标注样本训练的模型相当。

Conclusion: RLVR框架为数据稀缺领域提供了一种高效、低成本的解决方案，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language and vision-language models have enabled
strong reasoning capabilities, yet they remain impractical for specialized
domains like remote sensing, where annotated data is scarce and expensive. We
present the first few-shot reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR)
framework for satellite imagery that eliminates the need for caption
supervision--relying solely on lightweight, rule-based binary or IoU-based
rewards. Adapting the "1-shot RLVR" paradigm from language models to
vision-language models, we employ policy-gradient optimization with as few as
one curated example to align model outputs for satellite reasoning tasks.
Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing benchmarks--including
classification, visual question answering, and grounding--show that even a
single example yields substantial improvements over the base model. Scaling to
128 examples matches or exceeds models trained on thousands of annotated
samples. While the extreme one-shot setting can induce mild, task-specific
overfitting, our approach consistently demonstrates robust generalization and
efficiency across diverse tasks. Further, we find that prompt design and loss
weighting significantly influence training stability and final accuracy. Our
method enables cost-effective and data-efficient development of
domain-specialist vision-language reasoning models, offering a pragmatic recipe
for data-scarce fields: start from a compact VLM, curate a handful of
reward-checkable cases, and train via RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型计算量大、延迟高，不适合资源有限的嵌入式设备，亟需一种高效低延迟的解决方案。

Method: 将视频数据转换为时空图（STG），利用MobileNet提取面部特征，再通过轻量级时空图神经网络检测疲劳。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，显著降低计算复杂度和延迟。

Conclusion: LiteFat为嵌入式设备提供了实时、高效的疲劳检测方案。

Abstract: Detecting driver fatigue is critical for road safety, as drowsy driving
remains a leading cause of traffic accidents. Many existing solutions rely on
computationally demanding deep learning models, which result in high latency
and are unsuitable for embedded robotic devices with limited resources (such as
intelligent vehicles/cars) where rapid detection is necessary to prevent
accidents. This paper introduces LiteFat, a lightweight spatio-temporal graph
learning model designed to detect driver fatigue efficiently while maintaining
high accuracy and low computational demands. LiteFat involves converting
streaming video data into spatio-temporal graphs (STG) using facial landmark
detection, which focuses on key motion patterns and reduces unnecessary data
processing. LiteFat uses MobileNet to extract facial features and create a
feature matrix for the STG. A lightweight spatio-temporal graph neural network
is then employed to identify signs of fatigue with minimal processing and low
latency. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that LiteFat performs
competitively while significantly decreasing computational complexity and
latency as compared to current state-of-the-art methods. This work enables the
development of real-time, resource-efficient human fatigue detection systems
that can be implemented upon embedded robotic devices.

Motivation: 标准ViT架构存在参数冗余和计算成本高的问题，限制了实际部署。现有方法多为静态压缩或固定计算深度，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 引入Mixture-of-Recursions（MoR）范式，为每个token动态确定处理深度，实现计算资源的自适应分配。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K等基准测试中，MoR-ViT实现了70%参数减少和2.5倍推理加速，并超越现有高效ViT模型。

Conclusion: 动态递归是高效ViT的有效策略，为实际场景中的可扩展和可部署深度学习模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have achieved remarkable success in image
recognition, yet standard ViT architectures are hampered by substantial
parameter redundancy and high computational cost, limiting their practical
deployment. While recent efforts on efficient ViTs primarily focus on static
model compression or token-level sparsification, they remain constrained by
fixed computational depth for all tokens. In this work, we present MoR-ViT, a
novel vision transformer framework that, for the first time, incorporates a
token-level dynamic recursion mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Recursions
(MoR) paradigm. This approach enables each token to adaptively determine its
processing depth, yielding a flexible and input-dependent allocation of
computational resources. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K and transfer
benchmarks demonstrate that MoR-ViT not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
with up to 70% parameter reduction and 2.5x inference acceleration, but also
outperforms leading efficient ViT baselines such as DynamicViT and TinyViT
under comparable conditions. These results establish dynamic recursion as an
effective strategy for efficient vision transformers and open new avenues for
scalable and deployable deep learning models in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情AUs检测是情感计算中的关键挑战，但目前LLM在该领域的应用尚未探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过增强融合投影器（EFP）结合3D-CNN提取的局部纹理和全局语义特征，生成信息密集的token，供LLM进行推理。

Result: 在CASME II和SAMM数据集上的实验表明，AU-LLM达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: AU-LLM展示了LLM在微表情分析中的巨大潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: The detection of micro-expression Action Units (AUs) is a formidable
challenge in affective computing, pivotal for decoding subtle, involuntary
human emotions. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate profound
reasoning abilities, their application to the fine-grained, low-intensity
domain of micro-expression AU detection remains unexplored. This paper pioneers
this direction by introducing \textbf{AU-LLM}, a novel framework that for the
first time uses LLM to detect AUs in micro-expression datasets with subtle
intensities and the scarcity of data. We specifically address the critical
vision-language semantic gap, the \textbf{Enhanced Fusion Projector (EFP)}. The
EFP employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to intelligently fuse mid-level
(local texture) and high-level (global semantics) visual features from a
specialized 3D-CNN backbone into a single, information-dense token. This
compact representation effectively empowers the LLM to perform nuanced
reasoning over subtle facial muscle movements.Through extensive evaluations on
the benchmark CASME II and SAMM datasets, including stringent
Leave-One-Subject-Out (LOSO) and cross-domain protocols, AU-LLM establishes a
new state-of-the-art, validating the significant potential and robustness of
LLM-based reasoning for micro-expression analysis. The codes are available at

Result: 在11个基准数据集上，MSGCoOp显著提升基类到新类的泛化性能，平均调和均值提升1.10%。

Conclusion: MSGCoOp在少样本和跨域泛化任务中表现优越，且计算高效。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-trained models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
remarkable zero-shot generalization, and prompt learning has emerged as an
efficient alternative to full fine-tuning. However, existing methods often
struggle with generalization to novel classes, a phenomenon attributed to
overfitting on seen classes and forgetting general knowledge. Furthermore,
recent approaches that improve generalization often introduce complex
architectures or heavy computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
Multiple Semantic-Guided Context Optimization (MSGCoOp) framework to enhance
few-shot generalization while maintaining computational efficiency. Our
approach leverages an ensemble of parallel learnable context vectors to capture
diverse semantic aspects. To enrich these prompts, we introduce a semantic
guidance mechanism that aligns them with comprehensive class descriptions
automatically generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Furthermore, a
diversity regularization loss encourages the prompts to learn complementary and
orthogonal features, preventing them from collapsing into redundant
representations. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that
MSGCoOp significantly improves performance on base-to-novel generalization,
achieving an average harmonic mean improvement of 1.10\% over the strong KgCoOp
baseline. Our method also demonstrates enhanced robustness in cross-domain
generalization tasks. Our code is avaliable at:

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了医学图像-文本预训练的效果，为临床语义提供了更好的表示。

Abstract: Medical image-language pre-training aims to align medical images with
clinically relevant text to improve model performance on various downstream
tasks. However, existing models often struggle with the variability and
ambiguity inherent in medical data, limiting their ability to capture nuanced
clinical information and uncertainty. This work introduces an uncertainty-aware
medical image-text pre-training model that enhances generalization capabilities
in medical image analysis. Building on previous methods and focusing on Chest
X-Rays, our approach utilizes structured text reports generated by a large
language model (LLM) to augment image data with clinically relevant context.
These reports begin with a definition of the disease, followed by the
`appearance' section to highlight critical regions of interest, and finally
`observations' and `verdicts' that ground model predictions in clinical
semantics. By modeling both inter- and intra-modal uncertainty, our framework
captures the inherent ambiguity in medical images and text, yielding improved
representations and performance on downstream tasks. Our model demonstrates
significant advances in medical image-text pre-training, obtaining
state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks.

Abstract: Creating immersive and playable 3D worlds from texts or images remains a
fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing world
generation approaches typically fall into two categories: video-based methods
that offer rich diversity but lack 3D consistency and rendering efficiency, and
3D-based methods that provide geometric consistency but struggle with limited
training data and memory-inefficient representations. To address these
limitations, we present HunyuanWorld 1.0, a novel framework that combines the
best of both worlds for generating immersive, explorable, and interactive 3D
scenes from text and image conditions. Our approach features three key
advantages: 1) 360{\deg} immersive experiences via panoramic world proxies; 2)
mesh export capabilities for seamless compatibility with existing computer
graphics pipelines; 3) disentangled object representations for augmented
interactivity. The core of our framework is a semantically layered 3D mesh
representation that leverages panoramic images as 360{\deg} world proxies for
semantic-aware world decomposition and reconstruction, enabling the generation
of diverse 3D worlds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in generating coherent, explorable, and
interactive 3D worlds while enabling versatile applications in virtual reality,

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in alignment and content moderation, large
language models (LLMs) and text-to-image (T2I) systems remain vulnerable to
prompt-based attacks known as jailbreaks. Unlike traditional adversarial
examples requiring expert knowledge, many of today's jailbreaks are low-effort,
high-impact crafted by everyday users with nothing more than cleverly worded
prompts. This paper presents a systems-style investigation into how non-experts
reliably circumvent safety mechanisms through techniques such as multi-turn
narrative escalation, lexical camouflage, implication chaining, fictional
impersonation, and subtle semantic edits. We propose a unified taxonomy of
prompt-level jailbreak strategies spanning both text-output and T2I models,
grounded in empirical case studies across popular APIs. Our analysis reveals
that every stage of the moderation pipeline, from input filtering to output
validation, can be bypassed with accessible strategies. We conclude by
highlighting the urgent need for context-aware defenses that reflect the ease
with which these jailbreaks can be reproduced in real-world settings.

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k基准测试中优于OFA方法，且参数开销更小。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨架构蒸馏领域提供了简单而强大的基线。

Abstract: We describe a simple method for cross-architecture knowledge distillation,
where the knowledge transfer is cast into a redundant information suppression
formulation. Existing methods introduce sophisticated modules,
architecture-tailored designs, and excessive parameters, which impair their
efficiency and applicability. We propose to extract the architecture-agnostic
knowledge in heterogeneous representations by reducing the redundant
architecture-exclusive information. To this end, we present a simple redundancy
suppression distillation (RSD) loss, which comprises cross-architecture
invariance maximisation and feature decorrelation objectives. To prevent the
student from entirely losing its architecture-specific capabilities, we further
design a lightweight module that decouples the RSD objective from the student's
internal representations. Our method is devoid of the architecture-specific
designs and complex operations in the pioneering method of OFA. It outperforms
OFA on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k benchmarks with only a fraction of their
parameter overhead, which highlights its potential as a simple and strong
baseline to the cross-architecture distillation community.

### [119] [Unleashing the Power of Motion and Depth: A Selective Fusion Strategy for RGB-D Video Salient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21857)
*Jiahao He,Daerji Suolang,Keren Fu,Qijun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种选择性跨模态融合框架（SMFNet），用于RGB-D视频显著目标检测（VSOD），通过像素级选择性融合策略（PSF）和多维选择性注意力模块（MSAM）优化光学流和深度的融合，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D VSOD方法在处理光学流和深度时未考虑其在不同场景中的贡献差异，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出PSF策略实现光学流和深度的最优融合，并通过MSAM模块在多维度上增强特征表示。

Result: 在多个数据集上评估，SMFNet优于19种现有模型，验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: SMFNet通过选择性融合和注意力机制显著提升了RGB-D VSOD的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Applying salient object detection (SOD) to RGB-D videos is an emerging task
called RGB-D VSOD and has recently gained increasing interest, due to
considerable performance gains of incorporating motion and depth and that RGB-D
videos can be easily captured now in daily life. Existing RGB-D VSOD models
have different attempts to derive motion cues, in which extracting motion
information explicitly from optical flow appears to be a more effective and
promising alternative. Despite this, there remains a key issue that how to
effectively utilize optical flow and depth to assist the RGB modality in SOD.
Previous methods always treat optical flow and depth equally with respect to
model designs, without explicitly considering their unequal contributions in
individual scenarios, limiting the potential of motion and depth. To address
this issue and unleash the power of motion and depth, we propose a novel
selective cross-modal fusion framework (SMFNet) for RGB-D VSOD, incorporating a
pixel-level selective fusion strategy (PSF) that achieves optimal fusion of
optical flow and depth based on their actual contributions. Besides, we propose
a multi-dimensional selective attention module (MSAM) to integrate the fused
features derived from PSF with the remaining RGB modality at multiple
dimensions, effectively enhancing feature representation to generate refined
features. We conduct comprehensive evaluation of SMFNet against 19
state-of-the-art models on both RDVS and DVisal datasets, making the evaluation
the most comprehensive RGB-D VSOD benchmark up to date, and it also
demonstrates the superiority of SMFNet over other models. Meanwhile, evaluation
on five video benchmark datasets incorporating synthetic depth validates the
efficacy of SMFNet as well. Our code and benchmark results are made publicly
available at https://github.com/Jia-hao999/SMFNet.

TL;DR: Vid-TTA是一种轻量级测试时自适应框架，通过自监督辅助任务优化视频编辑，提升时间一致性和减少提示过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在时间不一致性和提示过拟合问题，且计算资源需求高，缺乏高质量标注数据。

Method: 采用运动感知帧重建机制和提示扰动重建策略，结合元学习动态损失平衡机制。

Result: 显著提升视频时间一致性，减少提示过拟合，同时保持低计算开销。

Conclusion: Vid-TTA为现有视频编辑模型提供即插即用的性能提升。

Abstract: Video editing is a critical component of content creation that transforms raw
footage into coherent works aligned with specific visual and narrative
objectives. Existing approaches face two major challenges: temporal
inconsistencies due to failure in capturing complex motion patterns, and
overfitting to simple prompts arising from limitations in UNet backbone
architectures. While learning-based methods can enhance editing quality, they
typically demand substantial computational resources and are constrained by the
scarcity of high-quality annotated data. In this paper, we present Vid-TTA, a
lightweight test-time adaptation framework that personalizes optimization for
each test video during inference through self-supervised auxiliary tasks. Our
approach incorporates a motion-aware frame reconstruction mechanism that
identifies and preserves crucial movement regions, alongside a prompt
perturbation and reconstruction strategy that strengthens model robustness to
diverse textual descriptions. These innovations are orchestrated by a
meta-learning driven dynamic loss balancing mechanism that adaptively adjusts
the optimization process based on video characteristics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Vid-TTA significantly improves video temporal consistency and
mitigates prompt overfitting while maintaining low computational overhead,
offering a plug-and-play performance boost for existing video editing models.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在利用视觉线索进行消歧时表现不佳，且单一方向假设可能导致性能下降。

Method: 采用双模型框架，分别学习头部到指尖和手腕到指尖的方向，引入高斯射线热图表示，并结合CLIP感知的指向集成模块和辅助任务。

Result: 在YouRefIt数据集上，0.25 IoU阈值下提升了约4 mAP。

Conclusion: 双模型框架和多模态结合显著提升了指称理解的准确性。

Abstract: We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves
predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both
pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires
multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing,
and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively
leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the
referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally
aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a
single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one
model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the
wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap
representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong
supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues.
To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing
Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features.
Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task
to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through
extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving
an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.

Motivation: 克服传统顺序文本到视觉管道的局限性，实现多模态叙事的高效协同生成。

Method: 利用Narrator（大型语言模型）生成文本和提示，Director管理动态场景图，Narrative Arc Controller指导故事结构，Affective Tone Mapper确保情感一致性。

Result: 在多样化叙事提示的定性评估中，表现优于基线方法，增强叙事深度和视觉保真度。

Conclusion: Aether Weaver为快速创意原型设计和沉浸式叙事体验提供了强大平台。

Abstract: We introduce Aether Weaver, a novel, integrated framework for multimodal
narrative co-generation that overcomes limitations of sequential text-to-visual
pipelines. Our system concurrently synthesizes textual narratives, dynamic
scene graph representations, visual scenes, and affective soundscapes, driven
by a tightly integrated, co-generation mechanism. At its core, the Narrator, a
large language model, generates narrative text and multimodal prompts, while
the Director acts as a dynamic scene graph manager, and analyzes the text to
build and maintain a structured representation of the story's world, ensuring
spatio-temporal and relational consistency for visual rendering and subsequent
narrative generation. Additionally, a Narrative Arc Controller guides the
high-level story structure, influencing multimodal affective consistency,
further complemented by an Affective Tone Mapper that ensures congruent
emotional expression across all modalities. Through qualitative evaluations on
a diverse set of narrative prompts encompassing various genres, we demonstrate
that Aether Weaver significantly enhances narrative depth, visual fidelity, and
emotional resonance compared to cascaded baseline approaches. This integrated
framework provides a robust platform for rapid creative prototyping and
immersive storytelling experiences.

Motivation: 深度伪造技术对数字媒体真实性构成威胁，现有检测器在真实数据中的有效性尚未验证。

Method: 提出一种模拟真实场景的测试方法，使用先进生成技术创建包含50万张高质量深度伪造图像的数据集。

Result: 检测深度伪造仍具挑战性，不到一半的检测器AUC超过60%，最低为50%。图像处理会显著降低性能。

Conclusion: 深度伪造检测仍需改进，现有方法在真实场景中表现不佳。

Abstract: Deepfakes powered by advanced machine learning models present a significant
and evolving threat to identity verification and the authenticity of digital
media. Although numerous detectors have been developed to address this problem,
their effectiveness has yet to be tested when applied to real-world data. In
this work we evaluate modern deepfake detectors, introducing a novel testing
procedure designed to mimic real-world scenarios for deepfake detection. Using
state-of-the-art deepfake generation methods, we create a comprehensive dataset
containing more than 500,000 high-quality deepfake images. Our analysis shows
that detecting deepfakes still remains a challenging task. The evaluation shows
that in fewer than half of the deepfake detectors tested achieved an AUC score
greater than 60%, with the lowest being 50%. We demonstrate that basic image
manipulations, such as JPEG compression or image enhancement, can significantly
reduce model performance. All code and data are publicly available at

Method: 使用多站点数据集，应用注意力机制揭示种族相关的形态特征，评估三种数据整理策略。

Result: 模型对白人和黑人群体预测性能较高（AUC：0.799, 0.762），整体性能降至0.663；表皮是关键特征。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has demonstrated success in computational
pathology (CPath) for disease detection, biomarker classification, and
prognosis prediction. However, its potential to learn unintended demographic
biases, particularly those related to social determinants of health, remains
understudied. This study investigates whether deep learning models can predict
self-reported race from digitized dermatopathology slides and identifies
potential morphological shortcuts. Using a multisite dataset with a racially
diverse population, we apply an attention-based mechanism to uncover
race-associated morphological features. After evaluating three dataset curation
strategies to control for confounding factors, the final experiment showed that
White and Black demographic groups retained high prediction performance (AUC:
0.799, 0.762), while overall performance dropped to 0.663. Attention analysis
revealed the epidermis as a key predictive feature, with significant
performance declines when these regions were removed. These findings highlight
the need for careful data curation and bias mitigation to ensure equitable AI
deployment in pathology. Code available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字化艺术品的分析需要结合视觉解读和丰富的艺术、历史背景知识，现有方法通常依赖外部知识库链接，限制了适用范围。

Method: ArtSeek包含三个核心组件：基于后期交互检索的多模态检索模块、对比多任务分类网络，以及基于上下文示例的推理策略。使用WikiFragments数据集支持知识驱动的多模态推理。

Result: 在风格分类和图像描述任务中，ArtSeek分别实现了8.4% F1和7.1 BLEU@1的提升，并能解释视觉主题和推断历史背景。

Conclusion: ArtSeek不仅适用于视觉艺术领域，还可推广到其他需要外部知识的领域，支持可扩展的多模态AI研究。

Abstract: Analyzing digitized artworks presents unique challenges, requiring not only
visual interpretation but also a deep understanding of rich artistic,
contextual, and historical knowledge. We introduce ArtSeek, a multimodal
framework for art analysis that combines multimodal large language models with
retrieval-augmented generation. Unlike prior work, our pipeline relies only on
image input, enabling applicability to artworks without links to Wikidata or
Wikipedia-common in most digitized collections. ArtSeek integrates three key
components: an intelligent multimodal retrieval module based on late
interaction retrieval, a contrastive multitask classification network for
predicting artist, genre, style, media, and tags, and an agentic reasoning
strategy enabled through in-context examples for complex visual question
answering and artwork explanation via Qwen2.5-VL. Central to this approach is
WikiFragments, a Wikipedia-scale dataset of image-text fragments curated to
support knowledge-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, including a +8.4% F1
improvement in style classification over GraphCLIP and a +7.1 BLEU@1 gain in
captioning on ArtPedia. Qualitative analyses show that ArtSeek can interpret
visual motifs, infer historical context, and retrieve relevant knowledge, even
for obscure works. Though focused on visual arts, our approach generalizes to
other domains requiring external knowledge, supporting scalable multimodal AI
research. Both the dataset and the source code will be made publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼底图像分析存在小病灶区域和疾病间细微差异的挑战，导致模型预测准确性下降和过拟合。

Method: SwinECAT结合Swin Attention机制捕捉局部和长距离依赖关系，并利用ECA机制聚焦关键特征通道。

Result: 在9类眼底疾病分类任务中，SwinECAT达到88.29%的准确率，加权F1分数0.88，宏观F1分数0.90，显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SwinECAT在眼底图像分类中表现出色，是目前公开数据集上9类分类的最高性能模型。

Abstract: In recent years, artificial intelligence has been increasingly applied in the
field of medical imaging. Among these applications, fundus image analysis
presents special challenges, including small lesion areas in certain fundus
diseases and subtle inter-disease differences, which can lead to reduced
prediction accuracy and overfitting in the models. To address these challenges,
this paper proposes the Transformer-based model SwinECAT, which combines the
Shifted Window (Swin) Attention with the Efficient Channel Attention (ECA)
Attention. SwinECAT leverages the Swin Attention mechanism in the Swin
Transformer backbone to effectively capture local spatial structures and
long-range dependencies within fundus images. The lightweight ECA mechanism is
incorporated to guide the SwinECAT's attention toward critical feature
channels, enabling more discriminative feature representation. In contrast to
previous studies that typically classify fundus images into 4 to 6 categories,
this work expands fundus disease classification to 9 distinct types, thereby
enhancing the granularity of diagnosis. We evaluate our method on the Eye
Disease Image Dataset (EDID) containing 16,140 fundus images for 9-category
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that SwinECAT achieves 88.29\%
accuracy, with weighted F1-score of 0.88 and macro F1-score of 0.90. The
classification results of our proposed model SwinECAT significantly outperform
the baseline Swin Transformer and multiple compared baseline models. To our
knowledge, this represents the highest reported performance for 9-category
classification on this public dataset.

Motivation: 多模态领域缺乏大规模高质量代理调优数据集，限制了多模态大语言模型的潜力。

Method: 通过四阶段数据引擎构建数据集：1) 收集公开多模态问答对；2) 用GPT-4o生成推理并动态整合API和RAG；3) 通过反思优化逻辑一致性；4) 可选压缩为单轮格式。

Result: InternVL2.5-8B-RR模型在多个基准测试中平均提升2.7%，在Dyn-VQA上提升8.8%。

Conclusion: MMAT-1M有效提升多模态推理和工具使用能力，数据集已公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), enhanced through agent tuning, have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and tool
utilization, significantly surpassing the performance of standalone models.
However, the multimodal domain still lacks a large-scale, high-quality agent
tuning dataset to unlock the full potential of multimodal large language
models. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMAT-1M, the first million-scale
multimodal agent tuning dataset designed to support CoT, reflection, and
dynamic tool usage. Our dataset is constructed through a novel four-stage data
engine: 1) We first curate publicly available multimodal datasets containing
question-answer pairs; 2) Then, leveraging GPT-4o, we generate rationales for
the original question-answer pairs and dynamically integrate API calls and
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) information through a multi-turn paradigm;
3) Furthermore, we refine the rationales through reflection to ensure logical
consistency and accuracy, creating a multi-turn dialogue dataset with both
Rationale and Reflection (RR); 4) Finally, to enhance efficiency, we optionally
compress multi-turn dialogues into a One-turn Rationale and Reflection (ORR)
format. By fine-tuning open-source multimodal models on the MMAT-1M, we observe
significant performance gains. For instance, the InternVL2.5-8B-RR model
achieves an average improvement of 2.7% across eight public benchmarks and 8.8%
on the RAG benchmark Dyn-VQA, demonstrating the dataset's effectiveness in
enhancing multimodal reasoning and tool-based capabilities. The dataset is

Motivation: 现有方法无法有效建模多模态线索（如音乐）或忽略跨模态协作和时间动态，导致对复杂交互和关键性能变化的捕捉不足。

Method: LMAC-Net通过多模态注意力一致性机制对齐视觉和音频特征，结合局部查询编码模块和两级评分评估，优化多模态对齐和评分融合。

Result: 在RG和Fis-V数据集上，LMAC-Net表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LMAC-Net通过多模态对齐和动态建模，有效提升了长期动作质量评估的准确性。

Abstract: Long-term action quality assessment (AQA) focuses on evaluating the quality
of human activities in videos lasting up to several minutes. This task plays an
important role in the automated evaluation of artistic sports such as rhythmic
gymnastics and figure skating, where both accurate motion execution and
temporal synchronization with background music are essential for performance
assessment. However, existing methods predominantly fall into two categories:
unimodal approaches that rely solely on visual features, which are inadequate
for modeling multimodal cues like music; and multimodal approaches that
typically employ simple feature-level contrastive fusion, overlooking deep
cross-modal collaboration and temporal dynamics. As a result, they struggle to
capture complex interactions between modalities and fail to accurately track
critical performance changes throughout extended sequences. To address these
challenges, we propose the Long-term Multimodal Attention Consistency Network
(LMAC-Net). LMAC-Net introduces a multimodal attention consistency mechanism to
explicitly align multimodal features, enabling stable integration of visual and
audio information and enhancing feature representations. Specifically, we
introduce a multimodal local query encoder module to capture temporal semantics
and cross-modal relations, and use a two-level score evaluation for
interpretable results. In addition, attention-based and regression-based losses
are applied to jointly optimize multimodal alignment and score fusion.
Experiments conducted on the RG and Fis-V datasets demonstrate that LMAC-Net
significantly outperforms existing methods, validating the effectiveness of our
proposed approach.

Motivation: 现有数据自由量化方法在生成合成图像时未充分探索其与量化模型泛化性的关系，导致性能下降。

Method: 采用mixup-based text prompting策略，融合多类标签生成合成数据，并通过梯度范数和泛化误差分析提供定量见解。

Result: 在CNN和ViT上实验表明，该方法优于现有DFQ方法，并在极低位量化（W2A4）中达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: mixup-class prompt策略有效提升了数据自由量化的性能，尤其在低位量化场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) improves efficiency but struggles with
limited calibration data, especially under privacy constraints. Data-free
quantization (DFQ) mitigates this by generating synthetic images using
generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and
text-conditioned latent diffusion models (LDMs), while applying existing PTQ
algorithms. However, the relationship between generated synthetic images and
the generalizability of the quantized model during PTQ remains underexplored.
Without investigating this relationship, synthetic images generated by previous
prompt engineering methods based on single-class prompts suffer from issues
such as polysemy, leading to performance degradation. We propose
\textbf{mixup-class prompt}, a mixup-based text prompting strategy that fuses
multiple class labels at the text prompt level to generate diverse, robust
synthetic data. This approach enhances generalization, and improves
optimization stability in PTQ. We provide quantitative insights through
gradient norm and generalization error analysis. Experiments on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) show that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art DFQ methods like GenQ. Furthermore,
it pushes the performance boundary in extremely low-bit scenarios, achieving
new state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging 2-bit weight, 4-bit activation

Motivation: 现有阴影去除方法依赖阴影掩码，但掩码在真实场景中难以获取。利用局部对比信息等内在图像线索存在模糊性问题，无法区分真实阴影与低反射物体或复杂背景。

Method: 提出AGBA机制动态过滤和重加权对比先验，分离阴影特征；引入FCFN网络，利用高频和对比线索指导生成过程，恢复软阴影边界和细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无掩码方法中达到最优性能，与基于掩码的方法相比也具有竞争力。

Conclusion: AGBA和FCFN的组合有效解决了无掩码阴影去除的挑战，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Existing shadow removal methods often rely on shadow masks, which are
challenging to acquire in real-world scenarios. Exploring intrinsic image cues,
such as local contrast information, presents a potential alternative for
guiding shadow removal in the absence of explicit masks. However, the cue's
inherent ambiguity becomes a critical limitation in complex scenes, where it
can fail to distinguish true shadows from low-reflectance objects and intricate
background textures. To address this motivation, we propose the Adaptive Gated
Dual-Branch Attention (AGBA) mechanism. AGBA dynamically filters and re-weighs
the contrast prior to effectively disentangle shadow features from confounding
visual elements. Furthermore, to tackle the persistent challenge of restoring
soft shadow boundaries and fine-grained details, we introduce a diffusion-based
Frequency-Contrast Fusion Network (FCFN) that leverages high-frequency and
contrast cues to guide the generative process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results among mask-free
approaches while maintaining competitive performance relative to mask-based
methods.

Motivation: 现有CLIP模型在多语言数据处理上存在挑战，如缺乏非英语数据的筛选方法，以及多语言性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出MetaCLIP 2，通过最小化必要的调整，实现英语与非英语数据的互惠学习。

Result: 在零样本ImageNet分类中超越英语版CLIP和mSigLIP，并在多语言基准测试（如CVQA、Babel-ImageNet和XM3600）中刷新了最佳性能。

Conclusion: MetaCLIP 2成功解决了多语言数据处理的难题，为多模态学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model,
supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on
billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training
further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no
curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2)
the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its
English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in
LLMs. Here, we present MetaCLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch
on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct
rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above
challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and
non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP 2
ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%,
and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding
factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual

Abstract: Scarcity of pixel-level labels is a significant challenge in practical
scenarios. In specific domains like industrial smoke, acquiring such detailed
annotations is particularly difficult and often requires expert knowledge. To
alleviate this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has emerged as a
promising approach. However, due to the supervision gap and inherent bias in
models trained with only image level labels, existing WSSS methods suffer from
limitations such as incomplete foreground coverage, inaccurate object
boundaries, and spurious correlations, especially in our domain, where
emissions are always spatially coupled with chimneys.
  Previous solutions typically rely on additional priors or external knowledge
to mitigate these issues, but they often lack scalability and fail to address
the model's inherent bias toward co-occurring context. To address this, we
propose a novel WSSS framework that directly targets the co-occurrence problem
without relying on external supervision. Unlike prior methods that adopt a
single network, we employ a teacher-student framework that combines CNNs and
ViTs. We introduce a knowledge transfer loss that enforces cross-architecture
consistency by aligning internal representations. Additionally, we incorporate
post-processing techniques to address partial coverage and further improve
pseudo mask quality.

Abstract: Wide-baseline panorama reconstruction has emerged as a highly effective and
pivotal approach for not only achieving geometric reconstruction of the
surrounding 3D environment, but also generating highly realistic and immersive
novel views. Although existing methods have shown remarkable performance across
various benchmarks, they are predominantly reliant on accurate pose
information. In real-world scenarios, the acquisition of precise pose often
requires additional computational resources and is highly susceptible to noise.
These limitations hinder the broad applicability and practicality of such
methods. In this paper, we present PanoSplatt3R, an unposed wide-baseline
panorama reconstruction method. We extend and adapt the foundational
reconstruction pretrainings from the perspective domain to the panoramic
domain, thus enabling powerful generalization capabilities. To ensure a
seamless and efficient domain-transfer process, we introduce RoPE rolling that
spans rolled coordinates in rotary positional embeddings across different
attention heads, maintaining a minimal modification to RoPE's mechanism, while
modeling the horizontal periodicity of panorama images. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that PanoSplatt3R, even in the absence of pose
information, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. This
superiority is evident in both the generation of high-quality novel views and
the accuracy of depth estimation, thereby showcasing its great potential for
practical applications. Project page: https://npucvr.github.io/PanoSplatt3R

Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，早期检测至关重要。心电图图像在临床中广泛使用，但人工解读耗时且依赖专家知识。

Method: 采用预处理管道减少视觉噪声，并使用两阶段微调策略：先在合成和外部数据集上微调，再在目标数据集上优化。采用ConvNeXt架构。

Result: 在公开验证集和私有测试集上AUROC得分分别为0.9688和0.9677，表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有望成为临床工作流程中自动化心电图解读的实用工具。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading global cause of death, and
early detection is essential to improve patient outcomes. Electrocardiograms
(ECGs), especially 12-lead ECGs, play a key role in the identification of CVDs.
These are routinely interpreted by human experts, a process that is
time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Historical research in this area
has focused on automatic ECG interpretation from digital signals, with recent
deep learning approaches achieving strong results. In practice, however, most
ECG data in clinical practice are stored or shared in image form. To bridge
this gap, we propose a deep learning framework designed specifically to
classify paper-like ECG images into five main diagnostic categories. Our method
was the winning entry to the 2024 British Heart Foundation Open Data Science
Challenge. It addresses two main challenges of paper ECG classification: visual
noise (e.g., shadows or creases) and the need to detect fine-detailed waveform
patterns. We propose a pre-processing pipeline that reduces visual noise and a
two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the model is first fine-tuned on synthetic and
external ECG image datasets to learn domain-specific features, and then further
fine-tuned on the target dataset to enhance disease-specific recognition. We
adopt the ConvNeXt architecture as the backbone of our model. Our method
achieved AUROC scores of 0.9688 on the public validation set and 0.9677 on the
private test set of the British Heart Foundation Open Data Science Challenge,
highlighting its potential as a practical tool for automated ECG interpretation
in clinical workflows.

Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和精细时间分辨率，但稀疏和噪声事件流以及多模态数据融合的挑战限制了其语义分割的鲁棒性。

Method: EIFNet包含自适应事件特征细化模块（AEFRM）、模态自适应重校准模块（MARM）和多头注意力门控融合模块（MGFM），通过注意力机制和门控策略实现多模态特征对齐与融合。

Result: 在DDD17-Semantic和DSEC-Semantic数据集上，EIFNet实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EIFNet通过多模态融合和注意力机制，有效解决了事件语义分割中的挑战，展示了其优越性。

Abstract: Event-based semantic segmentation explores the potential of event cameras,
which offer high dynamic range and fine temporal resolution, to achieve robust
scene understanding in challenging environments. Despite these advantages, the
task remains difficult due to two main challenges: extracting reliable features
from sparse and noisy event streams, and effectively fusing them with dense,
semantically rich image data that differ in structure and representation. To
address these issues, we propose EIFNet, a multi-modal fusion network that
combines the strengths of both event and frame-based inputs. The network
includes an Adaptive Event Feature Refinement Module (AEFRM), which improves
event representations through multi-scale activity modeling and spatial
attention. In addition, we introduce a Modality-Adaptive Recalibration Module
(MARM) and a Multi-Head Attention Gated Fusion Module (MGFM), which align and
integrate features across modalities using attention mechanisms and gated
fusion strategies. Experiments on DDD17-Semantic and DSEC-Semantic datasets
show that EIFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating its
effectiveness in event-based semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Micro-Actions (MAs) are an important form of non-verbal communication in
social interactions, with potential applications in human emotional analysis.
However, existing methods in Micro-Action Recognition often overlook the
inherent subtle changes in MAs, which limits the accuracy of distinguishing MAs
with subtle changes. To address this issue, we present a novel Motion-guided
Modulation Network (MMN) that implicitly captures and modulates subtle motion
cues to enhance spatial-temporal representation learning. Specifically, we
introduce a Motion-guided Skeletal Modulation module (MSM) to inject motion
cues at the skeletal level, acting as a control signal to guide spatial
representation modeling. In parallel, we design a Motion-guided Temporal
Modulation module (MTM) to incorporate motion information at the frame level,
facilitating the modeling of holistic motion patterns in micro-actions.
Finally, we propose a motion consistency learning strategy to aggregate the
motion cues from multi-scale features for micro-action classification.
Experimental results on the Micro-Action 52 and iMiGUE datasets demonstrate
that MMN achieves state-of-the-art performance in skeleton-based micro-action
recognition, underscoring the importance of explicitly modeling subtle motion
cues. The code will be available at https://github.com/momiji-bit/MMN.

Result: ZIUM在多种机器遗忘场景中表现优异，攻击成功率高且时间成本低。

Conclusion: ZIUM为机器遗忘模型的安全问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) removes specific data points or concepts from deep
learning models to enhance privacy and prevent sensitive content generation.
Adversarial prompts can exploit unlearned models to generate content containing
removed concepts, posing a significant security risk. However, existing
adversarial attack methods still face challenges in generating content that
aligns with an attacker's intent while incurring high computational costs to
identify successful prompts. To address these challenges, we propose ZIUM, a
Zero-shot Intent-aware adversarial attack on Unlearned Models, which enables
the flexible customization of target attack images to reflect an attacker's
intent. Additionally, ZIUM supports zero-shot adversarial attacks without
requiring further optimization for previously attacked unlearned concepts. The
evaluation across various MU scenarios demonstrated ZIUM's effectiveness in
successfully customizing content based on user-intent prompts while achieving a
superior attack success rate compared to existing methods. Moreover, its
zero-shot adversarial attack significantly reduces the attack time for
previously attacked unlearned concepts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出新方法对计算机视觉模型进行染色和锁定，以保护知识产权。染色（水印）嵌入秘密行为用于后续识别，锁定则使模型在输入图像中插入秘密触发器前无法使用。方法无需微调或重新训练，且有可计算的最坏情况误报率保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保护模型所有者的知识产权，防止未经授权的使用或复制。

Method: 通过直接修改少量模型权重实现染色和锁定，对模型性能影响极小。锁定模型需在输入图像角落插入‘触发器补丁’解锁。

Result: 实验证明方法有效，并在多种计算机视觉模型中展示实际性能。

Conclusion: 新方法为保护预训练模型提供高效且可证明的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce new methods of staining and locking computer vision models, to
protect their owners' intellectual property. Staining, also known as
watermarking, embeds secret behaviour into a model which can later be used to
identify it, while locking aims to make a model unusable unless a secret
trigger is inserted into input images. Unlike existing methods, our algorithms
can be used to stain and lock pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning
or retraining, and come with provable, computable guarantees bounding their
worst-case false positive rates. The stain and lock are implemented by directly
modifying a small number of the model's weights and have minimal impact on the
(unlocked) model's performance. Locked models are unlocked by inserting a small
`trigger patch' into the corner of the input image. We present experimental
results showing the efficacy of our methods and demonstrating their practical
performance on a variety of computer vision models.

Conclusion: CEDANet展示了结合公民科学与弱监督领域适应的可行性和高效性，适用于数据稀缺的环境监测。

Abstract: Industrial smoke segmentation is critical for air-quality monitoring and
environmental protection but is often hampered by the high cost and scarcity of
pixel-level annotations in real-world settings. We introduce CEDANet, a
human-in-the-loop, class-aware domain adaptation framework that uniquely
integrates weak, citizen-provided video-level labels with adversarial feature
alignment. Specifically, we refine pseudo-labels generated by a source-trained
segmentation model using citizen votes, and employ class-specific domain
discriminators to transfer rich source-domain representations to the industrial
domain. Comprehensive experiments on SMOKE5K and custom IJmond datasets
demonstrate that CEDANet achieves an F1-score of 0.414 and a smoke-class IoU of
0.261 with citizen feedback, vastly outperforming the baseline model, which
scored 0.083 and 0.043 respectively. This represents a five-fold increase in
F1-score and a six-fold increase in smoke-class IoU. Notably, CEDANet with
citizen-constrained pseudo-labels achieves performance comparable to the same
architecture trained on limited 100 fully annotated images with F1-score of
0.418 and IoU of 0.264, demonstrating its ability to reach small-sampled fully
supervised-level accuracy without target-domain annotations. Our research
validates the scalability and cost-efficiency of combining citizen science with
weakly supervised domain adaptation, offering a practical solution for complex,
data-scarce environmental monitoring applications.

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉理解和多模态推理方面表现出色，但常出现幻觉现象，即生成的文本与视觉内容不一致。现有方法以文本为中心，视觉-语义对齐的挑战限制了其效果。

Method: ViHallu通过生成视觉变化图像（保持整体结构但可控变化）和构建视觉指令，增强模型的细粒度视觉理解能力，从而改善视觉-语义对齐。

Conclusion: ViHallu通过视觉中心的方法有效缓解了LVLMs的幻觉问题，并提升了视觉-语义对齐能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual understanding and multimodal reasoning. However, LVLMs
frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, manifesting as the generated
textual responses that demonstrate inconsistencies with the provided visual
content. Existing hallucination mitigation methods are predominantly
text-centric, the challenges of visual-semantic alignment significantly limit
their effectiveness, especially when confronted with fine-grained visual
understanding scenarios. To this end, this paper presents ViHallu, a
Vision-Centric Hallucination mitigation framework that enhances visual-semantic
alignment through Visual Variation Image Generation and Visual Instruction
Construction. ViHallu introduces \textbf{\textit{visual variation images}} with
controllable visual alterations while maintaining the overall image structure.
These images, combined with carefully constructed visual instructions, enable
LVLMs to better understand fine-grained visual content through fine-tuning,
allowing models to more precisely capture the correspondence between visual
content and text, thereby enhancing visual-semantic alignment. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ViHallu effectively enhances
models' fine-grained visual understanding while significantly reducing
hallucination tendencies. Furthermore, we release ViHallu-Instruction, a visual
instruction dataset specifically designed for hallucination mitigation and
visual-semantic alignment. Code is available at

Abstract: Recent dense audio-visual (AV) models achieve impressive retrieval and
emergent localization, but almost all evidence comes from English-centric,
caption-rich web video. It is unclear whether these objectives survive in
low-resource, code-switched, and noisy multilingual settings that typify
developing regions. We show they do**-**and that the choice of aggregation
function becomes even more critical. Using a multilingual subset of Project
Vaani spanning dozens of Indian languages and dialectal variants, we compare
three contrastive objectives: (i) a global mean-pooled loss (CLIP-style), (ii)
a dense max-mean token matcher (DenseAV-style), and (iii) a simple hybrid
(motivated by frozen-vision alignment strategies). The dense objective delivers
a +59% relative R@1 (Audio Visual) improvement over global pooling and
substantially lower mean/median ranks, while consistently producing sharp
zero-shot localization heatmaps of spoken objects-despite keeping the vision
backbone entirely frozen (no LoRA / partial fine-tuning). Our results
demonstrate that dense token routing is not a luxury of high-resource English
corpora; it is more decisive when annotations and acoustic cleanliness are
scarce. We release the codebase and trained models.

Abstract: We propose a novel segmentation-based explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) method for neural networks working on point cloud classification. As one
building block of this method, we propose a novel point-shifting mechanism to
introduce perturbations in point cloud data. Recently, AI has seen an
exponential growth. Hence, it is important to understand the decision-making
process of AI algorithms when they are applied in critical areas. Our work
focuses on explaining AI algorithms that classify point cloud data. An
important aspect of the methods used for explaining AI algorithms is their
ability to produce explanations that are easy for humans to understand. This
allows them to analyze the AI algorithms better and make appropriate decisions
based on that analysis. Therefore, in this work, we intend to generate
meaningful explanations that can be easily interpreted by humans. The point
cloud data we consider represents 3D objects such as cars, guitars, and
laptops. We make use of point cloud segmentation models to generate
explanations for the working of classification models. The segments are used to
introduce perturbations into the input point cloud data and generate saliency
maps. The perturbations are introduced using the novel point-shifting mechanism
proposed in this work which ensures that the shifted points no longer influence
the output of the classification algorithm. In contrast to previous methods,
the segments used by our method are meaningful, i.e. humans can easily
interpret the meaning of the segments. Thus, the benefit of our method over
other methods is its ability to produce more meaningful saliency maps. We
compare our method with the use of classical clustering algorithms to generate
explanations. We also analyze the saliency maps generated for example inputs
using our method to demonstrate the usefulness of the method in generating
meaningful explanations.

Motivation: 现有导航基础模型仅依赖离线数据训练，缺乏对动作后果的推理能力，难以适应真实世界的交互需求。

Method: S2E框架结合视频预训练和强化学习，引入Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching策略和Residual-Attention模块。

Result: 实验表明S2E避免了仅依赖离线数据的收益递减问题，强化学习在机器人学习中优于监督微调。

Conclusion: 整合在线交互经验对扩展机器人基础模型至关重要。

Abstract: Navigation foundation models trained on massive webscale data enable agents
to generalize across diverse environments and embodiments. However, these
models trained solely on offline data, often lack the capacity to reason about
the consequences of their actions or adapt through counterfactual
understanding. They thus face significant limitations in the real-world urban
navigation where interactive and safe behaviors, such as avoiding obstacles and
moving pedestrians, are critical. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the
Seeing-to-Experiencing framework to scale the capability of navigation
foundation models with reinforcement learning. S2E combines the strengths of
pre-training on videos and post-training through RL. It maintains the
generalizability acquired from large-scale real-world videos while enhancing
its interactivity through RL in simulation environments. Specifically, we
introduce two innovations: an Anchor-Guided Distribution Matching strategy,
which stabilizes learning and models diverse motion patterns through
anchor-based supervision; and a Residual-Attention Module, which obtains
reactive behaviors from simulation environments without erasing the model's
pretrained knowledge. Moreover, we establish a comprehensive end-to-end
evaluation benchmark, NavBench-GS, built on photorealistic 3DGS reconstructions
of real-world scenes that incorporate physical interactions. It can
systematically assess the generalizability and safety of navigation foundation
models. Extensive experiments show that S2E mitigates the diminishing returns
often seen when scaling with offline data alone. We perform a thorough analysis
of the benefits of Reinforcement Learning compared to Supervised Fine-Tuning in
the context of post-training for robot learning. Our findings emphasize the
crucial role of integrating interactive online experiences to effectively scale
foundation models in Robotics.

Conclusion: 浅层架构在少样本学习中具备竞争力，验证了研究假设的正确性。

Abstract: Deep learning has witnessed the extensive utilization across a wide spectrum
of domains, including fine-grained few-shot learning (FGFSL) which heavily
depends on deep backbones. Nonetheless, shallower deep backbones such as
ConvNet-4, are not commonly preferred because they're prone to extract a larger
quantity of non-abstract visual attributes. In this paper, we initially
re-evaluate the relationship between network depth and the ability to fully
encode few-shot instances, and delve into whether shallow deep architecture
could effectuate comparable or superior performance to mainstream deep
backbone. Fueled by the inspiration from vanilla ConvNet-4, we introduce a
location-aware constellation network (LCN-4), equipped with a cutting-edge
location-aware feature clustering module. This module can proficiently encoder
and integrate spatial feature fusion, feature clustering, and recessive feature
location, thereby significantly minimizing the overall loss. Specifically, we
innovatively put forward a general grid position encoding compensation to
effectively address the issue of positional information missing during the
feature extraction process of specific ordinary convolutions. Additionally, we
further propose a general frequency domain location embedding technique to
offset for the location loss in clustering features. We have carried out
validation procedures on three representative fine-grained few-shot benchmarks.
Relevant experiments have established that LCN-4 notably outperforms the
ConvNet-4 based State-of-the-Arts and achieves performance that is on par with
or superior to most ResNet12-based methods, confirming the correctness of our
conjecture.

system features two key components: CLIP3R, a CLIP-informed 3D reconstruction
module that predicts dense point maps from overlapping clips while embedding
object-level semantics; and 2D-3D OVS, a 2D-3D open-vocabulary semantic module
that lifts 2D features into 3D by learning fused descriptors integrating
spatial, geometric, and semantic cues. Unlike prior methods, Ov3R incorporates
CLIP semantics directly into the reconstruction process, enabling globally
consistent geometry and fine-grained semantic alignment. Our framework achieves

Conclusion: MetaLab在小样本图像识别中表现出高精度、鲁棒性和有效泛化能力。

Abstract: Difficult few-shot image recognition has significant application prospects,
yet remaining the substantial technical gaps with the conventional large-scale
image recognition. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient original method
for few-shot image recognition, called CIELab-Guided Coherent Meta-Learning
(MetaLab). Structurally, our MetaLab comprises two collaborative neural
networks: LabNet, which can perform domain transformation for the CIELab color
space and extract rich grouped features, and coherent LabGNN, which can
facilitate mutual learning between lightness graph and color graph. For
sufficient certification, we have implemented extensive comparative studies on
four coarse-grained benchmarks, four fine-grained benchmarks, and four
cross-domain few-shot benchmarks. Specifically, our method can achieve high
accuracy, robust performance, and effective generalization capability with
one-shot sample per class. Overall, all experiments have demonstrated that our
MetaLab can approach 99\% $\uparrow\downarrow$ accuracy, reaching the human
recognition ceiling with little visual deviation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于强化学习的框架X-Omni，通过结合离散自回归建模和扩散目标，显著提升了图像生成质量，实现了图像与语言生成的无缝整合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于离散自回归建模的图像生成方法存在视觉保真度低、输出失真及复杂指令执行困难等问题，论文旨在通过强化学习解决这些问题。

Method: X-Omni框架包括语义图像分词器、统一的自回归模型（用于语言和图像）和离线扩散解码器，通过强化学习优化生成质量。

Result: X-Omni在7B语言模型上实现了图像生成任务的SOTA性能，生成图像具有高美学质量，并能有效遵循指令和渲染长文本。

Conclusion: 强化学习可有效提升离散自回归建模的图像生成质量，X-Omni框架为图像与语言生成的统一建模提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Numerous efforts have been made to extend the ``next token prediction''
paradigm to visual contents, aiming to create a unified approach for both image
generation and understanding. Nevertheless, attempts to generate images through
autoregressive modeling with discrete tokens have been plagued by issues such
as low visual fidelity, distorted outputs, and failure to adhere to complex
instructions when rendering intricate details. These shortcomings are likely
attributed to cumulative errors during autoregressive inference or information
loss incurred during the discretization process. Probably due to this
challenge, recent research has increasingly shifted toward jointly training
image generation with diffusion objectives and language generation with
autoregressive objectives, moving away from unified modeling approaches. In
this work, we demonstrate that reinforcement learning can effectively mitigate
artifacts and largely enhance the generation quality of a discrete
autoregressive modeling method, thereby enabling seamless integration of image
and language generation. Our framework comprises a semantic image tokenizer, a
unified autoregressive model for both language and images, and an offline
diffusion decoder for image generation, termed X-Omni. X-Omni achieves
state-of-the-art performance in image generation tasks using a 7B language
model, producing images with high aesthetic quality while exhibiting strong
capabilities in following instructions and rendering long texts.

*Nisarg A. Shah,Bardia Safaei,Shameema Sikder,S. Swaroop Vedula,Vishal M. Patel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StepAL是一种针对手术步骤识别的主动学习框架，通过视频级选择和熵加权聚类策略，显著减少标注成本并提高识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主动学习方法在手术视频分析中效果不佳，因为它们通常选择单帧或短片段标注，而手术步骤识别需要整个视频的上下文。

Method: StepAL结合了步骤感知特征表示和熵加权聚类策略，优先选择不确定且步骤多样的视频进行标注。

Result: 在Cataract-1k和Cataract-101数据集上，StepAL优于现有方法，以更少的标注视频实现更高准确性。

Conclusion: StepAL为手术视频分析提供了一种高效方法，降低了开发计算机辅助手术系统的标注负担。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) can reduce annotation costs in surgical video analysis
while maintaining model performance. However, traditional AL methods, developed
for images or short video clips, are suboptimal for surgical step recognition
due to inter-step dependencies within long, untrimmed surgical videos. These
methods typically select individual frames or clips for labeling, which is
ineffective for surgical videos where annotators require the context of the
entire video for annotation. To address this, we propose StepAL, an active
learning framework designed for full video selection in surgical step
recognition. StepAL integrates a step-aware feature representation, which
leverages pseudo-labels to capture the distribution of predicted steps within
each video, with an entropy-weighted clustering strategy. This combination
prioritizes videos that are both uncertain and exhibit diverse step
compositions for annotation. Experiments on two cataract surgery datasets
(Cataract-1k and Cataract-101) demonstrate that StepAL consistently outperforms
existing active learning approaches, achieving higher accuracy in step
recognition with fewer labeled videos. StepAL offers an effective approach for
efficient surgical video analysis, reducing the annotation burden in developing
computer-assisted surgical systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于运动引导的少样本视频目标分割（FSVOS）方法，并引入了MOVE数据集，评估了现有方法的局限性，提出了DMA基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FSVOS方法主要关注静态目标类别，忽略了视频中的动态运动信息，限制了其在需要运动理解的场景中的应用。

Method: 提出了Decoupled Motion Appearance Network（DMA）方法，结合MOVE数据集进行实验评估。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法难以处理运动引导的FSVOS任务，而DMA方法在少样本运动理解中表现优异。

Conclusion: DMA方法为未来研究方向提供了坚实基础，填补了运动引导FSVOS的空白。

Abstract: This work addresses motion-guided few-shot video object segmentation (FSVOS),
which aims to segment dynamic objects in videos based on a few annotated
examples with the same motion patterns. Existing FSVOS datasets and methods
typically focus on object categories, which are static attributes that ignore
the rich temporal dynamics in videos, limiting their application in scenarios
requiring motion understanding. To fill this gap, we introduce MOVE, a
large-scale dataset specifically designed for motion-guided FSVOS. Based on
MOVE, we comprehensively evaluate 6 state-of-the-art methods from 3 different
related tasks across 2 experimental settings. Our results reveal that current
methods struggle to address motion-guided FSVOS, prompting us to analyze the
associated challenges and propose a baseline method, Decoupled Motion
Appearance Network (DMA). Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance in few shot motion understanding, establishing a solid
foundation for future research in this direction.

Motivation: 现有新闻摘要方法仅依赖文本内容和时间相似性，忽略了利益相关者分析，导致事件理解不全面。

Method: 提出SUnSET框架，利用大语言模型构建SET（利益相关者、事件、时间）三元组，并设计基于利益相关者的排名和相关性度量。

Result: 实验结果显示SUnSET优于所有基线方法，成为新的最先进技术。

Conclusion: 利益相关者信息对新闻事件理解至关重要，SUnSET框架为时间线摘要任务提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: As news reporting becomes increasingly global and decentralized online,
tracking related events across multiple sources presents significant
challenges. Existing news summarization methods typically utilizes Large
Language Models and Graphical methods on article-based summaries. However, this
is not effective since it only considers the textual content of similarly dated
articles to understand the gist of the event. To counteract the lack of
analysis on the parties involved, it is essential to come up with a novel
framework to gauge the importance of stakeholders and the connection of related
events through the relevant entities involved. Therefore, we present SUnSET:
Synergistic Understanding of Stakeholder, Events and Time for the task of
Timeline Summarization (TLS). We leverage powerful Large Language Models (LLMs)
to build SET triplets and introduced the use of stakeholder-based ranking to
construct a $Relevancy$ metric, which can be extended into general situations.
Our experimental results outperform all prior baselines and emerged as the new
State-of-the-Art, highlighting the impact of stakeholder information within
news article.

theory and multimodal graph neural reasoning for semantic understanding and
threat detection in tactical video under high noise and weak structure. The
framework incorporates spectral embedding, temporal causal edge modeling, and
discriminative path inference across heterogeneous modalities. A semantic-aware

Abstract: The rise of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
especially integrated with Large Language Models (LLMs), has greatly
facilitated the resolution of complex tasks. However, current systems are still
facing challenges of inter-agent communication, coordination, and interaction
with heterogeneous tools and resources. Most recently, the Model Context
Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocol by
Google have been introduced, and to the best of our knowledge, very few
applications exist where both protocols are employed within a single MAS
framework. We present a pilot study of AgentMaster, a novel modular
multi-protocol MAS framework with self-implemented A2A and MCP, enabling
dynamic coordination and flexible communication. Through a unified
conversational interface, the system supports natural language interaction
without prior technical expertise and responds to multimodal queries for tasks
including information retrieval, question answering, and image analysis.
Evaluation through the BERTScore F1 and LLM-as-a-Judge metric G-Eval averaged
96.3\% and 87.1\%, revealing robust inter-agent coordination, query

Overall, our proposed framework contributes to the potential capabilities of
domain-specific, cooperative, and scalable conversational AI powered by MAS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: R-Stitch是一种基于置信度的混合解码框架，通过在小语言模型（SLM）和大语言模型（LLM）之间动态切换，显著加速链式思维（CoT）推理，同时保持答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有加速方法如推测解码在小模型和大模型一致性低时效果有限，且未能充分利用小模型生成简洁中间推理的优势。

Method: R-Stitch默认使用SLM生成令牌，仅在SLM置信度低于阈值时调用LLM，避免全序列回滚并选择性处理不确定步骤。

Result: 实验表明，R-Stitch在数学推理基准测试中实现了高达85%的推理延迟降低，且准确率下降可忽略。

Conclusion: R-Stitch是一种无需训练、模型无关且兼容标准解码流程的高效CoT推理加速方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好优化方法（如DPO）仅基于最大似然估计，忽略了先验奖励知识，可能导致对齐性能不足。MaPPO旨在通过引入先验知识提升对齐效果。

Method: MaPPO将先验奖励估计整合到最大后验（MaP）目标中，避免了现有方法的二元分类简化问题，且无需额外超参数，支持离线和在线优化。

Result: 在MT-Bench、AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard等基准测试中，MaPPO显著提升了对齐性能，且计算效率未受影响。

Conclusion: MaPPO是一种高效且通用的偏好优化框架，能够显著提升语言模型与人类偏好的对齐效果。

Abstract: As the era of large language models (LLMs) on behalf of users unfolds,
Preference Optimization (PO) methods have become a central approach to aligning
LLMs with human preferences and improving performance. We propose Maximum a
Posteriori Preference Optimization (MaPPO), a framework for learning from
preferences that explicitly incorporates prior reward knowledge into the
optimization objective. While existing methods such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) and its variants treat preference learning as a Maximum
Likelihood Estimation (MLE) problem, MaPPO extends this paradigm by integrating
prior reward estimates into a principled Maximum a Posteriori (MaP) objective.
This not only generalizes DPO and its variants, but also enhances alignment by
mitigating the oversimplified binary classification of responses. More
importantly, MaPPO introduces no additional hyperparameter, and supports
preference optimization in both offline and online settings. In addition, MaPPO
can be used as a plugin with consistent improvement on DPO variants, including
widely used SimPO, IPO, and CPO. Extensive empirical evaluations of different
model sizes and model series on three standard benchmarks, including MT-Bench,
AlpacaEval 2.0, and Arena-Hard, demonstrate consistent improvements in
alignment performance without sacrificing computational efficiency.

Abstract: Scaling laws are fundamental mathematical relationships that predict how
neural network performance evolves with changes in variables such as model
size, dataset size, and computational resources. Traditionally, discovering
these laws requires extensive human expertise and manual experimentation. We
introduce EvoSLD, an automated framework for Scaling Law Discovery (SLD) that
leverages evolutionary algorithms guided by Large Language Models (LLMs) to
co-evolve symbolic expressions and their optimization routines. Formulated to
handle scaling variables, control variables, and response metrics across
diverse experimental settings, EvoSLD searches for parsimonious, universal
functional forms that minimize fitting errors on grouped data subsets.
Evaluated on five real-world scenarios from recent literature, EvoSLD
rediscovers exact human-derived laws in two cases and surpasses them in others,
achieving up to orders-of-magnitude reductions in normalized mean squared error
on held-out test sets. Compared to baselines like symbolic regression and
ablated variants, EvoSLD demonstrates superior accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, highlighting its potential to accelerate AI research. Code is

Result: 开发了能够从不完美数据中学习的实用算法，解决了模式崩溃、尾部类别泛化等问题。

Conclusion: 通过多部分研究，论文为深度学习模型在不完美数据上的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The distribution of data in the world (eg, internet, etc.) significantly
differs from the well-curated datasets and is often over-populated with samples
from common categories. The algorithms designed for well-curated datasets
perform suboptimally when used for learning from imperfect datasets with
long-tailed imbalances and distribution shifts. To expand the use of deep
models, it is essential to overcome the labor-intensive curation process by
developing robust algorithms that can learn from diverse, real-world data
distributions. Toward this goal, we develop practical algorithms for Deep
Neural Networks which can learn from limited and imperfect data present in the
real world. This thesis is divided into four segments, each covering a scenario
of learning from limited or imperfect data. The first part of the thesis
focuses on Learning Generative Models from Long-Tail Data, where we mitigate
the mode-collapse and enable diverse aesthetic image generations for tail
(minority) classes. In the second part, we enable effective generalization on
tail classes through Inductive Regularization schemes, which allow tail classes
to generalize as effectively as the head classes without requiring explicit
generation of images. In the third part, we develop algorithms for Optimizing
Relevant Metrics for learning from long-tailed data with limited annotation
(semi-supervised), followed by the fourth part, which focuses on the Efficient
Domain Adaptation of the model to various domains with very few to zero labeled
samples.

Method: 通过实验评估两种情绪监控仪表板对211名用户评论行为和情绪体验的影响。

Result: 干预措施提高了用户情绪意识并减少了仇恨言论，但也增加了敏感话题讨论中的负面情绪表达。

Conclusion: 研究为未来整合情绪调节工具以促进健康数字互动提供了基础。

Abstract: Social media platforms increasingly employ proactive moderation techniques,
such as detecting and curbing toxic and uncivil comments, to prevent the spread
of harmful content. Despite these efforts, such approaches are often criticized
for creating a climate of censorship and failing to address the underlying
causes of uncivil behavior. Our work makes both theoretical and practical
contributions by proposing and evaluating two types of emotion monitoring
dashboards to users' emotional awareness and mitigate hate speech. In a study
involving 211 participants, we evaluate the effects of the two mechanisms on
user commenting behavior and emotional experiences. The results reveal that
these interventions effectively increase users' awareness of their emotional
states and reduce hate speech. However, our findings also indicate potential
unintended effects, including increased expression of negative emotions (Angry,
Fear, and Sad) when discussing sensitive issues. These insights provide a basis
for further research on integrating proactive emotion regulation tools into
social media platforms to foster healthier digital interactions.

Motivation: 大数据和人工智能时代对高效数据存储和处理的需求推动了量子图像处理（QIP）的发展，以利用量子计算解决复杂挑战。

Method: 比较了四种QImRs（TNR、FRQI、NEQR、QPIE）的压缩性能，并评估了量子核在分类问题中的表现。

Result: FRQI在图像压缩中表现优于其他方法；量子核在分类中与经典核精度相当，但资源占用更少。

Conclusion: 量子图像处理在压缩和分类任务中具有潜力，尤其是FRQI和量子核的高效性值得进一步研究。

Abstract: In the era of big data and artificial intelligence, the increasing volume of
data and the demand to solve more and more complex computational challenges are
two driving forces for improving the efficiency of data storage, processing and
analysis. Quantum image processing (QIP) is an interdisciplinary field between
quantum information science and image processing, which has the potential to
alleviate some of these challenges by leveraging the power of quantum
computing. In this work, we compare and examine the compression properties of
four different Quantum Image Representations (QImRs): namely, Tensor Network
Representation (TNR), Flexible Representation of Quantum Image (FRQI), Novel
Enhanced Quantum Representation NEQR, and Quantum Probability Image Encoding
(QPIE). Our simulations show that FRQI performs a higher compression of image
information than TNR, NEQR, and QPIE. Furthermore, we investigate the trade-off

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为OneShield的独立、模型无关且可定制的解决方案，用于保护大型语言模型（LLMs）的安全、隐私和伦理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs的广泛应用，其潜在的安全、隐私和伦理问题日益突出，需要一种灵活且可定制的解决方案来应对这些挑战。

Method: OneShield是一个独立框架，支持定义风险因素、表达上下文安全和合规政策，并针对特定客户需求进行风险缓解。

Result: 描述了OneShield的实现框架、可扩展性考虑以及自首次部署以来的使用统计数据。

Conclusion: OneShield为解决LLMs的潜在风险提供了一种灵活且可定制的解决方案，适用于不同客户的具体需求。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models has created a general excitement about the
great potential for a myriad of applications. While LLMs offer many
possibilities, questions about safety, privacy, and ethics have emerged, and
all the key actors are working to address these issues with protective measures
for their own models and standalone solutions. The constantly evolving nature
of LLMs makes the task of universally shielding users against their potential
risks extremely challenging, and one-size-fits-all solutions unfeasible. In
this work, we propose OneShield, our stand-alone, model-agnostic and
customizable solution to safeguard LLMs. OneShield aims to provide facilities
for defining risk factors, expressing and declaring contextual safety and
compliance policies, and mitigating LLM risks, with a focus on each specific
customer. We describe the implementation of the framework, the scalability
considerations and provide usage statistics of OneShield since its first
deployment.

### [163] [Hot-Swap MarkBoard: An Efficient Black-box Watermarking Approach for Large-scale Model Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20650)
*Zhicheng Zhang,Peizhuo Lv,Mengke Wan,Jiang Fang,Diandian Guo,Yezeng Chen,Yinlong Liu,Wei Ma,Jiyan Sun,Liru Geng*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出Hot-Swap MarkBoard方法，解决大规模分布式设备上深度学习模型的知识产权保护问题，支持高效水印定制和黑盒验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型在终端设备上的部署增加，知识产权风险加剧，现有水印方法无法适应大规模分发场景。

Method: 通过多分支LoRA模块独立嵌入用户特定水印，支持分支交换实现水印定制，无需重新训练；参数混淆机制增强水印抗移除性。

Result: 在三种任务和六种骨干模型上验证了方法的有效性，实现100%验证准确率。

Conclusion: Hot-Swap MarkBoard是一种高效、适应性强的水印方法，适用于多种模型架构和任务。

Abstract: Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on
end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy.
However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP)
risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them
vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection
solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based
AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale
distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a
unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and
modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address
these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking
method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently
embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through
branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the
watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without
degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is
compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including
classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments
across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's
superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving
100\% verification accuracy.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文系统综述了深度伪造检测的最新方法，强调可复现性和对抗性鲁棒性的不足，并提出了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术的快速发展对数字安全、信息真实性和身份保护构成挑战，亟需有效的检测方法。

Method: 分为两种核心范式：检测完全合成媒体（基于统计异常和分层特征提取）和定位真实内容中的篡改区域（利用多模态线索）。

Result: 现有方法在受控环境中表现良好，但对对抗性扰动的鲁棒性不足。

Conclusion: 未来研究需优先提升对抗性鲁棒性，开发可扩展且模态无关的架构。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence has fueled
deepfake proliferation-synthetic media encompassing fully generated content and
subtly edited authentic material-posing challenges to digital security,
misinformation mitigation, and identity preservation. This systematic review
evaluates state-of-the-art deepfake detection methodologies, emphasizing
reproducible implementations for transparency and validation. We delineate two
core paradigms: (1) detection of fully synthetic media leveraging statistical
anomalies and hierarchical feature extraction, and (2) localization of
manipulated regions within authentic content employing multi-modal cues such as
visual artifacts and temporal inconsistencies. These approaches, spanning
uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, demonstrate notable precision and
adaptability in controlled settings, effectively identifying manipulations
through advanced learning techniques and cross-modal fusion. However,
comprehensive assessment reveals insufficient evaluation of adversarial
robustness across both paradigms. Current methods exhibit vulnerability to
adversarial perturbations-subtle alterations designed to evade
detection-undermining reliability in real-world adversarial contexts. This gap
highlights critical disconnect between methodological development and evolving
threat landscapes. To address this, we contribute a curated GitHub repository
aggregating open-source implementations, enabling replication and testing. Our
findings emphasize urgent need for future work prioritizing adversarial
resilience, advocating scalable, modality-agnostic architectures capable of
withstanding sophisticated manipulations. This review synthesizes strengths and
shortcomings of contemporary deepfake detection while charting paths toward
robust trustworthy systems.

Motivation: 现有安全对齐机制对复杂对抗攻击仍显脆弱，传统越狱方法依赖显式提示，忽视了LVLMs在多步推理中的潜在漏洞。

Method: 提出ROP启发的越狱框架，将有害指令分解为良性视觉片段，通过精心设计的文本提示引导模型组合这些片段生成有害输出。

Result: 在SafeBench和MM-SafetyBench上验证，攻击成功率超过0.90，ASR提升高达0.39，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 揭示了LVLMs组合推理能力中的关键漏洞，呼吁开发保护整个推理过程的防御机制。

Abstract: The increasing sophistication of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has
been accompanied by advances in safety alignment mechanisms designed to prevent
harmful content generation. However, these defenses remain vulnerable to
sophisticated adversarial attacks. Existing jailbreak methods typically rely on
direct and semantically explicit prompts, overlooking subtle vulnerabilities in
how LVLMs compose information over multiple reasoning steps. In this paper, we
propose a novel and effective jailbreak framework inspired by Return-Oriented
Programming (ROP) techniques from software security. Our approach decomposes a
harmful instruction into a sequence of individually benign visual gadgets. A
carefully engineered textual prompt directs the sequence of inputs, prompting
the model to integrate the benign visual gadgets through its reasoning process
to produce a coherent and harmful output. This makes the malicious intent
emergent and difficult to detect from any single component. We validate our
method through extensive experiments on established benchmarks including
SafeBench and MM-SafetyBench, targeting popular LVLMs. Results show that our
approach consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines on
state-of-the-art models, achieving near-perfect attack success rates (over 0.90
on SafeBench) and improving ASR by up to 0.39. Our findings reveal a critical
and underexplored vulnerability that exploits the compositional reasoning
abilities of LVLMs, highlighting the urgent need for defenses that secure the
entire reasoning process.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving technology,
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication has emerged as a key enabler for
extending perception range and enhancing driving safety by providing visibility
beyond the line of sight. However, integrating multi-source sensor data from
both ego-vehicles and infrastructure under real-world constraints, such as
limited communication bandwidth and dynamic environments, presents significant
technical challenges. To facilitate research in this area, we organized the
End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge, which features
two tracks: cooperative temporal perception and cooperative end-to-end
planning. Built on the UniV2X framework and the V2X-Seq-SPD dataset, the
challenge attracted participation from over 30 teams worldwide and established
a unified benchmark for evaluating cooperative driving systems. This paper
describes the design and outcomes of the challenge, highlights key research
problems including bandwidth-aware fusion, robust multi-agent planning, and
heterogeneous sensor integration, and analyzes emerging technical trends among
top-performing solutions. By addressing practical constraints in communication
and data fusion, the challenge contributes to the development of scalable and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有的多模态大语言模型在通用领域的VQA任务中表现优异，但在医学影像等专业领域表现不佳，因此需要针对性地优化模型。

Method: 研究采用Florence2模型，并针对胃肠道内窥镜图像的VQA任务进行适配，使用ROUGE、BLEU和METEOR等标准指标评估性能。

TL;DR: ST-DAI是一种低成本3D空间转录组学框架，通过2.5D采样和域自适应插值方法，减少实验成本并保持高预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D空间转录组学全采样成本高和现有方法依赖外部数据导致泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用2.5D采样（中心全采样，相邻稀疏采样）和单样本域自适应插值学习（包括对齐、伪监督生成、快速多域细化）。

Result: ST-DAI在减少测量负担的同时，预测性能与全采样方法相当。

Conclusion: ST-DAI为低成本高效3D空间转录组学研究提供了可行方案。

Abstract: For 3D spatial transcriptomics (ST), the high per-section acquisition cost of
fully sampling every tissue section remains a significant challenge. Although
recent approaches predict gene expression from histology images, these methods
require large external datasets, which leads to high-cost and suffers from
substantial domain discrepancies that lead to poor generalization on new
samples. In this work, we introduce ST-DAI, a single-shot framework for 3D ST
that couples a cost-efficient 2.5D sampling scheme with an intra-sample
domain-adaptive imputation framework. First, in the cost-efficient 2.5D
sampling stage, one reference section (central section) is fully sampled while
other sections (adjacent sections) is sparsely sampled, thereby capturing
volumetric context at significantly reduced experimental cost. Second, we
propose a single-shot 3D imputation learning method that allows us to generate
fully sampled 3D ST from this cost-efficient 2.5D ST scheme, using only
sample-specific training. We observe position misalignment and domain
discrepancy between sections. To address those issues, we adopt a pipeline that
first aligns the central section to the adjacent section, thereafter generates
dense pseudo-supervision on the central section, and then performs Fast
Multi-Domain Refinement (FMDR), which adapts the network to the domain of the
adjacent section while fine-tuning only a few parameters through the use of
Parameter-Efficient Domain-Alignment Layers (PDLs). During this refinement, a
Confidence Score Generator (CSG) reweights the pseudo-labels according to their
estimated reliability, thereby directing imputation toward trustworthy regions.
Our experimental results demonstrate that ST-DAI achieves gene expression
prediction performance comparable to fully sampled approaches while
substantially reducing the measurement burden.

TL;DR: 提出VidFuncta框架，利用隐式神经表示（INRs）编码超声视频，优于传统2D和3D方法，支持下游任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超声视频分析中因非标准化采集和操作者偏差导致的标准深度学习方法难以处理的问题。

Method: 基于Functa框架，提出VidFuncta，将视频分解为静态向量和时间依赖调制向量，捕捉动态和冗余。

Result: 在三个超声视频数据集上验证，优于基线方法，支持射血分数预测、B线检测和乳腺病变分类。

Conclusion: VidFuncta为超声视频提供了一种通用且高效的表征框架。

Abstract: Ultrasound is widely used in clinical care, yet standard deep learning
methods often struggle with full video analysis due to non-standardized
acquisition and operator bias. We offer a new perspective on ultrasound video
analysis through implicit neural representations (INRs). We build on Functa, an
INR framework in which each image is represented by a modulation vector that
conditions a shared neural network. However, its extension to the temporal
domain of medical videos remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose
VidFuncta, a novel framework that leverages Functa to encode variable-length
ultrasound videos into compact, time-resolved representations. VidFuncta
disentangles each video into a static video-specific vector and a sequence of
time-dependent modulation vectors, capturing both temporal dynamics and
dataset-level redundancies. Our method outperforms 2D and 3D baselines on video
reconstruction and enables downstream tasks to directly operate on the learned
1D modulation vectors. We validate VidFuncta on three public ultrasound video
datasets -- cardiac, lung, and breast -- and evaluate its downstream
performance on ejection fraction prediction, B-line detection, and breast
lesion classification. These results highlight the potential of VidFuncta as a
generalizable and efficient representation framework for ultrasound videos. Our
code is publicly available under

Abstract: Pancreatic cancer is projected to become the second-deadliest malignancy in
Western countries by 2030, highlighting the urgent need for better early
detection. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), key precursors to
pancreatic cancer, are challenging to assess with current guidelines, often
leading to unnecessary surgeries or missed malignancies. We present Cyst-X, an
AI framework that predicts IPMN malignancy using multicenter MRI data,
leveraging MRI's superior soft tissue contrast over CT. Trained on 723 T1- and
738 T2-weighted scans from 764 patients across seven institutions, our models
(AUC=0.82) significantly outperform both Kyoto guidelines (AUC=0.75) and expert
radiologists. The AI-derived imaging features align with known clinical markers
and offer biologically meaningful insights. We also demonstrate strong
performance in a federated learning setting, enabling collaborative training
without sharing patient data. To promote privacy-preserving AI development and

Conclusion: Cardiac-CLIP在内部和外部数据上均达到最先进性能，支持复杂临床任务。

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable potential in medical domain.
However, their application to complex cardiovascular diagnostics remains
underexplored. In this paper, we present Cardiac-CLIP, a multi-modal foundation
model designed for 3D cardiac CT images. Cardiac-CLIP is developed through a
two-stage pre-training strategy. The first stage employs a 3D masked
autoencoder (MAE) to perform self-supervised representation learning from
large-scale unlabeled volumetric data, enabling the visual encoder to capture
rich anatomical and contextual features. In the second stage, contrastive
learning is introduced to align visual and textual representations,
facilitating cross-modal understanding. To support the pre-training, we collect
16641 real clinical CT scans, supplemented by 114k publicly available data.
Meanwhile, we standardize free-text radiology reports into unified templates
and construct the pathology vectors according to diagnostic attributes, based
on which the soft-label matrix is generated to supervise the contrastive
learning process. On the other hand, to comprehensively evaluate the
effectiveness of Cardiac-CLIP, we collect 6,722 real-clinical data from 12
independent institutions, along with the open-source data to construct the
evaluation dataset. Specifically, Cardiac-CLIP is comprehensively evaluated
across multiple tasks, including cardiovascular abnormality classification,
information retrieval and clinical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate
that Cardiac-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
downstream tasks in both internal and external data. Particularly, Cardiac-CLIP
exhibits great effectiveness in supporting complex clinical tasks such as the
prospective prediction of acute coronary syndrome, which is notoriously
difficult in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: ReXGroundingCT为胸部CT中的句子级定位和自由文本医学分割模型提供了新基准。

Abstract: We present ReXGroundingCT, the first publicly available dataset to link
free-text radiology findings with pixel-level segmentations in 3D chest CT
scans that is manually annotated. While prior datasets have relied on
structured labels or predefined categories, ReXGroundingCT captures the full
expressiveness of clinical language represented in free text and grounds it to
spatially localized 3D segmentation annotations in volumetric imaging. This
addresses a critical gap in medical AI: the ability to connect complex,
descriptive text, such as "3 mm nodule in the left lower lobe", to its precise
anatomical location in three-dimensional space, a capability essential for
grounded radiology report generation systems. The dataset comprises 3,142
non-contrast chest CT scans paired with standardized radiology reports from the
CT-RATE dataset. Using a systematic three-stage pipeline, GPT-4 was used to
extract positive lung and pleural findings, which were then manually segmented
by expert annotators. A total of 8,028 findings across 16,301 entities were
annotated, with quality control performed by board-certified radiologists.
Approximately 79% of findings are focal abnormalities, while 21% are non-focal.
The training set includes up to three representative segmentations per finding,
while the validation and test sets contain exhaustive labels for each finding
entity. ReXGroundingCT establishes a new benchmark for developing and
evaluating sentence-level grounding and free-text medical segmentation models
in chest CT. The dataset can be accessed at

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）在组合性语言解释中的能力，通过生成不同难度的数据集测试LLM将问题映射为SPARQL查询的系统性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM在理解复杂语言结构时的组合性能力，验证其是否能够基于已知的原子部分系统性地解释复杂问题。

Method: 生成基于DBpedia图形模式和Lemon词汇化的三个数据集，采用不同提示、少样本优化和微调技术，测试LLM的表现。

Result: 随着问题复杂度增加，LLM的宏F1分数从0.45降至0.09，即使在输入中提供所有必要信息，最高F1分数仅为0.57。

Conclusion: LLM在系统性和组合性地解释问题并映射为SPARQL查询方面表现不佳。

Abstract: Language interpretation is a compositional process, in which the meaning of
more complex linguistic structures is inferred from the meaning of their parts.
Large language models possess remarkable language interpretation capabilities
and have been successfully applied to interpret questions by mapping them to
SPARQL queries. An open question is how systematic this interpretation process
is. Toward this question, in this paper, we propose a benchmark for
investigating to what extent the abilities of LLMs to interpret questions are
actually compositional. For this, we generate three datasets of varying
difficulty based on graph patterns in DBpedia, relying on Lemon lexica for
verbalization. Our datasets are created in a very controlled fashion in order
to test the ability of LLMs to interpret structurally complex questions, given
that they have seen the atomic building blocks. This allows us to evaluate to
what degree LLMs are able to interpret complex questions for which they
"understand" the atomic parts. We conduct experiments with models of different
sizes using both various prompt and few-shot optimization techniques as well as
fine-tuning. Our results show that performance in terms of macro $F_1$ degrades
from $0.45$ over $0.26$ down to $0.09$ with increasing deviation from the
samples optimized on. Even when all necessary information was provided to the
model in the input, the $F_1$ scores do not exceed $0.57$ for the dataset of
lowest complexity. We thus conclude that LLMs struggle to systematically and
compositionally interpret questions and map them into SPARQL queries.

TL;DR: LeMix系统通过联合调度LLM的推理和训练任务，显著提升资源利用率和响应速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将LLM的推理和训练任务分离部署，导致资源浪费和延迟，LeMix旨在解决这一问题。

Method: LeMix结合离线分析、执行预测和运行时调度，动态分配资源以适应任务特性和系统条件。

Result: LeMix将吞吐量提升3.53倍，推理损失降低0.61倍，响应时间SLO达成率提高2.12倍。

Conclusion: LeMix首次实现了LLM推理与训练的联合调度，为高效部署LLM提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modern deployment of large language models (LLMs) frequently involves both
inference serving and continuous retraining to stay aligned with evolving data
and user feedback. Common practices separate these workloads onto distinct
servers in isolated phases, causing substantial inefficiencies (e.g., GPU
idleness) and delayed adaptation to new data in distributed settings. Our
empirical analysis reveals that these inefficiencies stem from dynamic request
arrivals during serving and workload heterogeneity in pipeline-parallel
training. To address these challenges, we propose LeMix, a system for
co-locating and managing concurrent LLM serving and training workloads. LeMix
integrates offline profiling, execution prediction mechanisms, and runtime
scheduling to dynamically adapt resource allocation based on workload
characteristics and system conditions. By understanding task-specific behaviors
and co-execution interference across shared nodes, LeMix improves utilization
and serving quality without compromising serving responsiveness. Our evaluation
shows that LeMix improves throughput by up to 3.53x, reduces inference loss by
up to 0.61x, and delivers up to 2.12x higher response time SLO attainment over
traditional separate setups. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
uncover and exploit the opportunities of joint LLM inference and training,
paving the way for more resource-efficient deployment of LLMs in production
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务范式：主动信息收集，通过强化微调策略训练LLMs在模糊任务中主动提问以填补信息空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在面对不完整或模糊提示时表现被动，无法主动获取关键信息，限制了其作为协作伙伴的能力。

Method: 设计了生成部分指定任务的框架，并通过强化微调策略奖励模型提出能获取隐含信息的问题。

Result: 实验显示，Qwen-2.5-7B模型在自动评估指标上优于基线18%，人类评估中其提问和最终方案分别获得42%和28%的偏好。

Conclusion: 主动提问能力显著提升了LLMs的协作效果，使其从被动文本生成器转变为真正的协作伙伴。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly expected to function as
collaborative partners, engaging in back-and-forth dialogue to solve complex,
ambiguous problems. However, current LLMs often falter in real-world settings,
defaulting to passive responses or narrow clarifications when faced with
incomplete or under-specified prompts, falling short of proactively gathering
the missing information that is crucial for high-quality solutions. In this
work, we introduce a new task paradigm: proactive information gathering, where
LLMs must identify gaps in the provided context and strategically elicit
implicit user knowledge through targeted questions. To systematically study and
train this capability, we design a scalable framework that generates partially
specified, real-world tasks, masking key information and simulating authentic
ambiguity. Within this setup, our core innovation is a reinforcement finetuning
strategy that rewards questions that elicit genuinely new, implicit user
information -- such as hidden domain expertise or fine-grained requirements --
that would otherwise remain unspoken. Experiments demonstrate that our trained
Qwen-2.5-7B model significantly outperforms o3-mini by 18% on automatic
evaluation metrics. More importantly, human evaluation reveals that
clarification questions and final outlines generated by our model are favored
by human annotators by 42% and 28% respectively. Together, these results
highlight the value of proactive clarification in elevating LLMs from passive
text generators to genuinely collaborative thought partners.

TL;DR: 提出了一套用于定义神经网络是否学习并使用“世界模型”的精确标准，旨在为实验研究提供共同语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为常用但非正式术语赋予操作意义，促进实验研究。

Result: 定义了一套标准，用于验证神经网络是否学习并使用了世界模型。

Conclusion: 为世界模型的研究提供了理论基础，未来可扩展至动作影响建模。

Abstract: We propose a set of precise criteria for saying a neural net learns and uses
a "world model." The goal is to give an operational meaning to terms that are
often used informally, in order to provide a common language for experimental
investigation. We focus specifically on the idea of representing a latent
"state space" of the world, leaving modeling the effect of actions to future
work. Our definition is based on ideas from the linear probing literature, and
formalizes the notion of a computation that factors through a representation of
the data generation process. An essential addition to the definition is a set
of conditions to check that such a "world model" is not a trivial consequence
of the neural net's data or task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理在训练和推理中存在推理设计不足、奖励机制低效和视觉噪声问题，亟需改进。

Method: 1) 提出连续奖励函数和“简单思考”奖励优化训练；2) 采用裁剪重采样策略；3) 推理阶段引入分解定位方法。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro和ScreenSpot-v2基准测试中达到最优性能，定位准确率提升23%。

Conclusion: UI-AGILE通过综合改进训练和推理方法，显著提升了GUI代理的性能和定位准确性。

Abstract: The emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has driven
significant advances in Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent capabilities.
Nevertheless, existing GUI agent training and inference techniques still suffer
from a dilemma for reasoning designs, ineffective reward, and visual noise. To
address these issues, we introduce UI-AGILE, a comprehensive framework
enhancing GUI agents at both the training and inference stages. For training,
we propose a suite of improvements to the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) process:
1) a Continuous Reward function to incentivize high-precision grounding; 2) a
"Simple Thinking" reward to balance planning with speed and grounding accuracy;
and 3) a Cropping-based Resampling strategy to mitigate the sparse reward
problem and improve learning on complex tasks. For inference, we present
Decomposed Grounding with Selection, a novel method that dramatically improves
grounding accuracy on high-resolution displays by breaking the image into
smaller, manageable parts. Experiments show that UI-AGILE achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on two benchmarks ScreenSpot-Pro and
ScreenSpot-v2. For instance, using both our proposed training and inference
enhancement methods brings 23% grounding accuracy improvement over the best
baseline on ScreenSpot-Pro.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理在复杂任务中表现出色，但在模糊、动态或间接表达目标时与用户的主动协作能力未被充分研究。

Method: 引入UserBench，模拟用户从模糊目标出发逐步揭示偏好，要求代理主动澄清意图并利用工具做出决策。

Result: 评估显示，LLM代理的任务完成与用户意图对齐率仅20%，最先进模型也仅能发现不到30%的用户偏好。

Conclusion: UserBench为提升LLM代理的协作能力提供了重要工具，凸显了构建真正协作伙伴的挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs)-based agents have made impressive progress in
reasoning and tool use, enabling them to solve complex tasks. However, their
ability to proactively collaborate with users, especially when goals are vague,
evolving, or indirectly expressed, remains underexplored. To address this gap,
we introduce UserBench, a user-centric benchmark designed to evaluate agents in
multi-turn, preference-driven interactions. UserBench features simulated users
who start with underspecified goals and reveal preferences incrementally,
requiring agents to proactively clarify intent and make grounded decisions with
tools. Our evaluation of leading open- and closed-source LLMs reveals a
significant disconnect between task completion and user alignment. For
instance, models provide answers that fully align with all user intents only
20% of the time on average, and even the most advanced models uncover fewer
than 30% of all user preferences through active interaction. These results
highlight the challenges of building agents that are not just capable task
executors, but true collaborative partners. UserBench offers an interactive
environment to measure and advance this critical capability.

Motivation: 尽管MLLMs在视觉语言任务中取得进展，但其在不可回答问题中的诚实行为尚未充分研究。

Method: 定义了四类视觉不可回答问题，构建了12k+样本的MoHoBench基准，评估了28种MLLMs的诚实行为。

Result: 多数模型无法适当拒绝回答，且诚实行为与视觉信息相关。

Conclusion: 提出了基于监督和偏好学习的对齐方法，为未来可信MLLMs研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Recently Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved considerable
advancements in vision-language tasks, yet produce potentially harmful or
untrustworthy content. Despite substantial work investigating the
trustworthiness of language models, MMLMs' capability to act honestly,
especially when faced with visually unanswerable questions, remains largely
underexplored. This work presents the first systematic assessment of honesty
behaviors across various MLLMs. We ground honesty in models' response behaviors
to unanswerable visual questions, define four representative types of such
questions, and construct MoHoBench, a large-scale MMLM honest benchmark,
consisting of 12k+ visual question samples, whose quality is guaranteed by
multi-stage filtering and human verification. Using MoHoBench, we benchmarked
the honesty of 28 popular MMLMs and conducted a comprehensive analysis. Our
findings show that: (1) most models fail to appropriately refuse to answer when
necessary, and (2) MMLMs' honesty is not solely a language modeling issue, but
is deeply influenced by visual information, necessitating the development of
dedicated methods for multimodal honesty alignment. Therefore, we implemented
initial alignment methods using supervised and preference learning to improve
honesty behavior, providing a foundation for future work on trustworthy MLLMs.

Motivation: 解决音频视觉多任务增量学习中如何保留旧任务知识并促进新任务学习的挑战。

Method: PHP方法分为三个阶段：浅层阶段设计任务共享模态聚合适配器；中层阶段提出任务特定模态共享动态生成适配器；深层阶段引入任务特定模态独立提示。

Result: 在四个任务（AVE、AVVP、AVS和AVQA）的不同顺序中实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: PHP方法通过平衡知识共享与任务特异性，有效解决了多任务增量学习中的问题。

Abstract: Audio-visual multi-task incremental learning aims to continuously learn from
multiple audio-visual tasks without the need for joint training on all tasks.
The challenge of the problem is how to preserve the old task knowledge while
facilitating the learning of new task with previous experiences. To address
these challenges, we introduce a three-stage Progressive Homeostatic and
Plastic audio-visual prompt (PHP) method. In the shallow phase, we design the
task-shared modality aggregating adapter to foster cross-task and cross-modal
audio-visual representation learning to enhance shared understanding between
tasks. In the middle phase, we propose the task-specific modality-shared
dynamic generating adapter, which constructs prompts that are tailored to
individual tasks while remaining general across modalities, which balances the
models ability to retain knowledge against forgetting with its potential for
versatile multi-task transferability. In the deep phase, we introduce the
task-specific modality-independent prompts to further refine the understand
ability by targeting individual information for each task and modality. By
incorporating these three phases, PHP retains task-specific prompts while
adapting shared parameters for new tasks to effectively balance knowledge
sharing and specificity. Our method achieves SOTA performance in different
orders of four tasks (AVE, AVVP, AVS and AVQA). Our code can be available at

TL;DR: MixGRPO提出了一种结合SDE和ODE的混合采样策略，通过滑动窗口机制优化MDP中的效率问题，显著提升了图像生成中人类偏好对齐的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如FlowGRPO）因需对所有去噪步骤进行采样和优化，效率低下。MixGRPO旨在通过混合采样策略和滑动窗口机制解决这一问题。

Method: MixGRPO结合SDE和ODE，采用滑动窗口机制，仅在窗口内进行SDE采样和GRPO优化，窗口外使用ODE采样，减少优化开销并加速收敛。

Result: MixGRPO在人类偏好对齐的多个维度上表现优异，训练时间减少近50%，其变体MixGRPO-Flash进一步减少71%训练时间。

Conclusion: MixGRPO通过混合采样和滑动窗口设计，显著提升了效率和性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Although GRPO substantially enhances flow matching models in human preference
alignment of image generation, methods such as FlowGRPO still exhibit
inefficiency due to the necessity of sampling and optimizing over all denoising
steps specified by the Markov Decision Process (MDP). In this paper, we propose
$\textbf{MixGRPO}$, a novel framework that leverages the flexibility of mixed
sampling strategies through the integration of stochastic differential
equations (SDE) and ordinary differential equations (ODE). This streamlines the
optimization process within the MDP to improve efficiency and boost
performance. Specifically, MixGRPO introduces a sliding window mechanism, using
SDE sampling and GRPO-guided optimization only within the window, while
applying ODE sampling outside. This design confines sampling randomness to the
time-steps within the window, thereby reducing the optimization overhead, and
allowing for more focused gradient updates to accelerate convergence.
Additionally, as time-steps beyond the sliding window are not involved in
optimization, higher-order solvers are supported for sampling. So we present a
faster variant, termed $\textbf{MixGRPO-Flash}$, which further improves
training efficiency while achieving comparable performance. MixGRPO exhibits
substantial gains across multiple dimensions of human preference alignment,
outperforming DanceGRPO in both effectiveness and efficiency, with nearly 50%
lower training time. Notably, MixGRPO-Flash further reduces training time by
71%. Codes and models are available at
$\href{https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/MixGRPO}{MixGRPO}$.
