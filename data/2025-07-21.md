### [1] [Adaptive Linguistic Prompting (ALP) Enhances Phishing Webpage Detection in Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13357)
*Atharva Bhargude,Ishan Gonehal,Chandler Haney,Dave Yoon,Kevin Zhu,Aaron Sandoval,Sean O'Brien,Kaustubh Vinnakota*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为ALP的少样本自适应语言提示方法，利用多模态大语言模型（如GPT-4o和Gemini 1.5 Pro）检测钓鱼网页，显著提升了检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 钓鱼攻击是严重的网络安全威胁，需要自适应检测技术来应对。

Method: ALP通过结构化语义推理，引导大语言模型分析文本欺骗性，包括分解语言模式、检测紧急信号和识别操纵性措辞，并结合文本、视觉和URL分析。

Result: 实验显示ALP显著提升了钓鱼检测准确率，F1分数达0.93，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: ALP为基于语言的钓鱼检测系统提供了更鲁棒、可解释和自适应的基础。

Abstract: Phishing attacks represent a significant cybersecurity threat, necessitating
adaptive detection techniques. This study explores few-shot Adaptive Linguistic
Prompting (ALP) in detecting phishing webpages through the multimodal
capabilities of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o
and Gemini 1.5 Pro. ALP is a structured semantic reasoning method that guides
LLMs to analyze textual deception by breaking down linguistic patterns,
detecting urgency cues, and identifying manipulative diction commonly found in
phishing content. By integrating textual, visual, and URL-based analysis, we
propose a unified model capable of identifying sophisticated phishing attempts.
Our experiments demonstrate that ALP significantly enhances phishing detection
accuracy by guiding LLMs through structured reasoning and contextual analysis.
The findings highlight the potential of ALP-integrated multimodal LLMs to
advance phishing detection frameworks, achieving an F1-score of 0.93,
surpassing traditional approaches. These results establish a foundation for
more robust, interpretable, and adaptive linguistic-based phishing detection
systems using LLMs.

### [2] [Persona-Based Synthetic Data Generation Using Multi-Stage Conditioning with Large Language Models for Emotion Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13380)
*Keito Inoshita,Rushia Harada*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaGen是一个基于多阶段角色条件的大语言模型框架，用于生成情感丰富的文本，解决情感识别领域高质量数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感表达具有主观性，受个体特质、社会文化背景和情境影响，大规模通用数据收集困难。

Method: 通过结合人口属性、社会文化背景和详细情境构建分层虚拟角色，指导情感表达生成。

Result: PersonaGen在生成多样、连贯且可区分的情感表达方面显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PersonaGen可作为增强或替代真实情感数据集的可靠方案。

Abstract: In the field of emotion recognition, the development of high-performance
models remains a challenge due to the scarcity of high-quality, diverse
emotional datasets. Emotional expressions are inherently subjective, shaped by
individual personality traits, socio-cultural backgrounds, and contextual
factors, making large-scale, generalizable data collection both ethically and
practically difficult. To address this issue, we introduce PersonaGen, a novel
framework for generating emotionally rich text using a Large Language Model
(LLM) through multi-stage persona-based conditioning. PersonaGen constructs
layered virtual personas by combining demographic attributes, socio-cultural
backgrounds, and detailed situational contexts, which are then used to guide
emotion expression generation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of the
generated synthetic data, assessing semantic diversity through clustering and
distributional metrics, human-likeness via LLM-based quality scoring, realism
through comparison with real-world emotion corpora, and practical utility in
downstream emotion classification tasks. Experimental results show that
PersonaGen significantly outperforms baseline methods in generating diverse,
coherent, and discriminative emotion expressions, demonstrating its potential
as a robust alternative for augmenting or replacing real-world emotional
datasets.

### [3] [SAFT: Structure-Aware Fine-Tuning of LLMs for AMR-to-Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13381)
*Rafiq Kamel,Filippo Guerranti,Simon Geisler,Stephan Günnemann*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAFT是一种结构感知的微调方法，通过注入图拓扑信息提升LLM在结构化数据（如AMR）上的生成性能，无需修改架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理AMR等结构化数据时，常忽略关键结构信息或与标准LLM不兼容，需一种通用且高效的方法。

Method: 利用磁拉普拉斯变换计算方向敏感的位置编码，并将其投影到LLM的嵌入空间。

Result: SAFT在AMR 3.0上实现了3.5 BLEU的提升，性能随图复杂度增加而增强。

Conclusion: SAFT为结构化数据与语言模型的结合提供了通用且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to tasks involving
structured inputs such as graphs. Abstract Meaning Representations (AMRs),
which encode rich semantics as directed graphs, offer a rigorous testbed for
evaluating LLMs on text generation from such structures. Yet, current methods
often arbitrarily linearize AMRs, discarding key structural cues, or rely on
architectures incompatible with standard LLMs. We introduce SAFT, a
structure-aware fine-tuning approach that injects graph topology into
pretrained LLMs without architectural changes. We compute direction-sensitive
positional encodings from the magnetic Laplacian of transformed AMRs and
project them into the embedding space of the LLM. While possibly applicable to
any graph-structured inputs, we focus on AMR-to-text generation as a
representative and challenging benchmark. SAFT sets a new state-of-the-art on
AMR 3.0 with a 3.5 BLEU improvement over baselines. Gains scale with graph
complexity, highlighting the value of structure-aware representations in
enhancing LLM performance. SAFT offers a general and effective pathway for
bridging structured data and language models.

### [4] [Context-Based Fake News Detection using Graph Based Approach: ACOVID-19 Use-case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13382)
*Chandrashekar Muniyappa,Sirisha Velampalli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于图的假新闻检测方法，利用NLP技术将新闻转换为图结构，并通过GBAD算法挖掘异常模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决数字时代假新闻快速传播的问题。

Method: 使用NLP将新闻转换为图结构，应用GBAD算法进行图挖掘以检测异常。

Result: 方法能够识别数据集中的规范模式并发现异常模式。

Conclusion: 图基方法在假新闻检测中表现出色，能发现传统方法可能忽略的复杂模式。

Abstract: In today\'s digital world, fake news is spreading with immense speed. Its a
significant concern to address. In this work, we addressed that challenge using
novel graph based approach. We took dataset from Kaggle that contains real and
fake news articles. To test our approach we incorporated recent covid-19
related news articles that contains both genuine and fake news that are
relevant to this problem. This further enhances the dataset as well instead of
relying completely on the original dataset. We propose a contextual graph-based
approach to detect fake news articles. We need to convert news articles into
appropriate schema, so we leverage Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques
to transform news articles into contextual graph structures. We then apply the
Minimum Description Length (MDL)-based Graph-Based Anomaly Detection (GBAD)
algorithm for graph mining. Graph-based methods are particularly effective for
handling rich contextual data, as they enable the discovery of complex patterns
that traditional query-based or statistical techniques might overlook. Our
proposed approach identifies normative patterns within the dataset and
subsequently uncovers anomalous patterns that deviate from these established
norms.

TL;DR: PARAM-1是一个专注于印度语言多样性的2.9B参数语言模型，通过双语数据集（印地语和英语）训练，强调公平表示、适应印度形态的标记化和文化对齐评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）在英语中心化设计中对印度多语言环境的忽视问题。

Method: 训练一个2.9B参数的解码器模型，使用印地语和英语双语数据集，并采用适应印度形态的标记化方法。

Result: PARAM-1在通用任务和印度中心应用中表现良好，成为公平基础建模的范例。

Conclusion: PARAM-1为多语言模型设计提供了以多样性为核心的预训练方法，适用于印度多语言环境。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful general-purpose
reasoning systems, yet their development remains dominated by English-centric
data, architectures, and optimization paradigms. This exclusionary design
results in structural under-representation of linguistically diverse regions
such as India, where over 20 official languages and 100+ dialects coexist
alongside phenomena like code-switching and diglossia. We introduce PARAM-1, a
2.9B parameter decoder-only, text-only language model trained from scratch with
an explicit architectural and linguistic focus on Indian diversity. PARAM-1 is
trained on a bilingual dataset consisting of only Hindi and English,
constructed with a strong focus on fact-rich, high-quality content. It is
guided by three core principles: equitable representation of Indic languages
through a 25% corpus allocation; tokenization fairness via a SentencePiece
tokenizer adapted to Indian morphological structures; and culturally aligned
evaluation benchmarks across IndicQA, code-mixed reasoning, and
socio-linguistic robustness tasks. By embedding diversity at the pretraining
level-rather than deferring it to post-hoc alignment-PARAM-1 offers a
design-first blueprint for equitable foundation modeling. Our results
demonstrate that it serves as both a competent general-purpose model and a
robust baseline for India-centric applications.

### [6] [TopicImpact: Improving Customer Feedback Analysis with Opinion Units for Topic Modeling and Star-Rating Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13392)
*Emil Häglund,Johanna Björklund*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过将主题建模流程重构为基于意见单元（包含相关文本摘录和情感评分的独立陈述），提升了从客户评论中提取洞察的能力，并显著提高了主题建模的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进从客户评论中提取洞察的方法，通过结合意见单元和情感评分，提升主题建模的连贯性和可解释性，同时分析其对业务指标的影响。

Method: 利用大语言模型提取意见单元，重构主题建模流程，将主题与情感模态结合，并与业务指标（如星级评分）关联。

Result: 系统生成了连贯且可解释的主题，同时捕捉了每个主题的情感，并能准确预测星级评分。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升主题建模性能和业务洞察方面具有显著优势，为其他主题建模和分类解决方案提供了改进方向。

Abstract: We improve the extraction of insights from customer reviews by restructuring
the topic modelling pipeline to operate on opinion units - distinct statements
that include relevant text excerpts and associated sentiment scores. Prior work
has demonstrated that such units can be reliably extracted using large language
models. The result is a heightened performance of the subsequent topic
modeling, leading to coherent and interpretable topics while also capturing the
sentiment associated with each topic. By correlating the topics and sentiments
with business metrics, such as star ratings, we can gain insights on how
specific customer concerns impact business outcomes. We present our system's
implementation, use cases, and advantages over other topic modeling and
classification solutions. We also evaluate its effectiveness in creating
coherent topics and assess methods for integrating topic and sentiment
modalities for accurate star-rating prediction.

### [7] [Mitigating Stylistic Biases of Machine Translation Systems via Monolingual Corpora Only](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13395)
*Xuanqi Gao,Weipeng Jiang,Juan Zhai,Shiqing Ma,Siyi Xie,Xinyang Yin,Chao Shen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Babel框架通过单语语料库提升神经机器翻译的文体保真度，无需平行语料库或修改现有系统架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经机器翻译中保留文体细微差别的挑战，避免依赖平行语料库。

Method: 结合基于上下文嵌入的文体检测器和扩散式文体应用器，作为后处理模块集成到现有NMT系统。

Result: 在五个领域实验中，Babel以88.21%的精度检测文体不一致，文体保留提升150%，语义相似度达0.92。

Conclusion: Babel有效提升翻译的文体保真度，同时保持语义完整性和流畅性。

Abstract: The advent of neural machine translation (NMT) has revolutionized
cross-lingual communication, yet preserving stylistic nuances remains a
significant challenge. While existing approaches often require parallel corpora
for style preservation, we introduce Babel, a novel framework that enhances
stylistic fidelity in NMT using only monolingual corpora. Babel employs two key
components: (1) a style detector based on contextual embeddings that identifies
stylistic disparities between source and target texts, and (2) a
diffusion-based style applicator that rectifies stylistic inconsistencies while
maintaining semantic integrity. Our framework integrates with existing NMT
systems as a post-processing module, enabling style-aware translation without
requiring architectural modifications or parallel stylistic data. Extensive
experiments on five diverse domains (law, literature, scientific writing,
medicine, and educational content) demonstrate Babel's effectiveness: it
identifies stylistic inconsistencies with 88.21% precision and improves
stylistic preservation by 150% while maintaining a high semantic similarity
score of 0.92. Human evaluation confirms that translations refined by Babel
better preserve source text style while maintaining fluency and adequacy.

### [8] [Causal Language Control in Multilingual Transformers via Sparse Feature Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13410)
*Cheng-Ting Chou,George Liu,Jessica Sun,Cole Blondin,Kevin Zhu,Vasu Sharma,Sean O'Brien*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 利用稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征控制多语言大模型（LLM）的生成语言，通过修改单个SAE特征实现高达90%的语言切换成功率，同时保持语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在多语言大模型中零样本设置下无法确定性控制生成目标语言的挑战。

Method: 利用预训练的SAE特征分析Gemma-2B和Gemma-9B的残差流，识别与目标语言（中、日、西、法）显著相关的特征，并在推理时修改这些特征。

Result: 通过修改单个SAE特征，成功实现语言切换（90%成功率），并在中后期transformer层和特定注意力头中效果最佳。

Conclusion: 稀疏特征控制是一种轻量且可解释的多语言生成控制机制。

Abstract: Deterministically controlling the target generation language of large
multilingual language models (LLMs) remains a fundamental challenge,
particularly in zero-shot settings where neither explicit language prompts nor
fine-tuning are available. In this work, we investigate whether sparse
autoencoder (SAE) features, previously shown to correlate with interpretable
model behaviors, can be leveraged to steer the generated language of LLMs
during inference. Leveraging pretrained SAEs on the residual streams of
Gemma-2B and Gemma-9B, we identify features whose activations differ most
significantly between English and four target languages: Chinese, Japanese,
Spanish, and French. By modifying just a single SAE feature at one transformer
layer, we achieve controlled language shifts with up to 90\% success, as
measured by FastText language classification, while preserving semantic
fidelity according to LaBSE (Language-Agnostic BERT Sentence Embedding)
similarity. Our analysis reveals that language steering is most effective in
mid-to-late transformer layers and is amplified by specific attention heads
disproportionately associated with language-sensitive SAE features. These
results demonstrate the promise of sparse feature steering as a lightweight and
interpretable mechanism for controllable multilingual generation.

TL;DR: ALIGNed-LLM通过将知识图谱（KGs）嵌入语言模型的潜在空间，提升模型的事实性，减少幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（如GPT-4）在NLP任务中表现优异，但存在幻觉问题。知识图谱能提供结构化、可靠的外部信息，是解决这一问题的潜在方案。

Method: 利用预训练的知识图谱嵌入（如TransE）和可训练投影层，对齐实体与文本嵌入，从而提升语言模型的事实性。

Result: 在三个问答基准数据集和实际金融用例中，ALIGNed-LLM显著提升了语言模型的准确性和事实性。

Conclusion: ALIGNed-LLM是一种简单有效的方法，通过知识图谱增强语言模型的事实性，适用于高精度需求的场景。

Abstract: Large language models like GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude have transformed natural
language processing (NLP) tasks such as question answering, dialogue
generation, summarization, and so forth; yet their susceptibility to
hallucination stands as one of the major challenges. Among numerous approaches
to overcome this challenge, integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) into language
models has emerged as a promising solution as it provides structured, reliable,
domain-specific, and up-to-date external information to the language models. In
this paper, we introduce ALIGNed-LLM, a simple yet effective approach to
improve language models' factuality via a lean strategy to infuse KGs into the
latent space of language models inspired by LLaVA where visual and textual
information is infused. We use embeddings from a pre-trained Knowledge Graph
Embedding (KGE) model, such as TransE, and a trainable projection layer to
align entity and text embeddings. This alignment enables the language model to
distinguish between similar entities improving factual grounding and reducing
hallucination. We tested our approach on three popular questions-answering
benchmark datasets alongside language models of varying sizes, showing
significant improvement. Furthermore, we applied our approach to a real-world
financial use case from a large central bank in Europe, which demands high
accuracy and precision, demonstrating a substantial improvement of the LLM
answers.

*Liang Lin,Zhihao Xu,Xuehai Tang,Shi Liu,Biyu Zhou,Fuqing Zhu,Jizhong Han,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Paper Summary Attack (PSA)的新型攻击方法，通过合成攻击或防御导向的LLM安全论文内容构建对抗性提示模板，显著提高了攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现LLMs倾向于信任权威来源（如学术论文），可能带来新的安全漏洞，因此提出PSA验证这一可能性。

Method: 设计PSA方法，系统合成攻击或防御导向的论文内容，构建对抗性提示模板，并在预定义子部分中填充有害查询作为对抗载荷。

Result: 实验显示PSA在Claude3.5-Sonnet和Deepseek-R1上的攻击成功率分别达到97%和98%，并揭示了不同模型间的漏洞偏差。

Conclusion: PSA揭示了LLMs的新漏洞，为对抗方法和安全对齐提供了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The safety of large language models (LLMs) has garnered significant research
attention. In this paper, we argue that previous empirical studies demonstrate
LLMs exhibit a propensity to trust information from authoritative sources, such
as academic papers, implying new possible vulnerabilities. To verify this
possibility, a preliminary analysis is designed to illustrate our two findings.
Based on this insight, a novel jailbreaking method, Paper Summary Attack
(\llmname{PSA}), is proposed. It systematically synthesizes content from either
attack-focused or defense-focused LLM safety paper to construct an adversarial
prompt template, while strategically infilling harmful query as adversarial
payloads within predefined subsections. Extensive experiments show significant
vulnerabilities not only in base LLMs, but also in state-of-the-art reasoning
model like Deepseek-R1. PSA achieves a 97\% attack success rate (ASR) on
well-aligned models like Claude3.5-Sonnet and an even higher 98\% ASR on
Deepseek-R1. More intriguingly, our work has further revealed diametrically
opposed vulnerability bias across different base models, and even between
different versions of the same model, when exposed to either attack-focused or
defense-focused papers. This phenomenon potentially indicates future research
clues for both adversarial methodologies and safety alignment.Code is available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了三种广泛使用的价值探测方法在大型语言模型（LLMs）中的鲁棒性和表达能力，发现输入扰动下方法表现差异大，且模型的价值偏好与实际行为相关性弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs价值取向的评估方法，填补现有研究中对探测方法系统性比较的空白，并探讨价值探测是否能反映模型的实际行为偏好。

Method: 通过变化提示和选项，评估三种价值探测策略的鲁棒性；引入两项任务研究价值对人口统计背景的响应性及与模型行为的对齐程度。

Result: 输入扰动下所有方法表现差异显著；人口统计背景对自由文本生成影响小；模型价值偏好与实际行为相关性弱。

Conclusion: 需更谨慎地评估LLM价值探测方法，并意识到其局限性。

Abstract: There has been extensive research on assessing the value orientation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) as it can shape user experiences across demographic
groups. However, several challenges remain. First, while the Multiple Choice
Question (MCQ) setting has been shown to be vulnerable to perturbations, there
is no systematic comparison of probing methods for value probing. Second, it is
unclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and
reflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate
the robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely
used probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that
all methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations. We also
introduce two tasks studying whether the values are responsive to demographic
context, and how well they align with the models' behaviors in value-related
scenarios. We show that the demographic context has little effect on the
free-text generation, and the models' values only weakly correlate with their
preference for value-based actions. Our work highlights the need for a more
careful examination of LLM value probing and awareness of its limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨句法对象在函数空间中的表示，并验证其与神经计算的兼容性。

Method: 利用第二Renyi熵构建非结合半环结构，通过操作模型转换波形，实现Merge操作的Hop代数表示。

Result: 证明了句法结构的神经计算实现可能性，并通过正弦波同步展示了Merge的具体实现。

Conclusion: 研究为句法核心计算结构的神经实现提供了理论支持，并揭示了Merge与算术后继函数的相似性。

Abstract: We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of
lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it
is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic
objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a
commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi
entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with
the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an
operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the
input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure.
The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these
circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results
obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical
possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational
structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general
construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross
frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge
can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus
clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor
function of arithmetic.

Abstract: The analysis of conversational dynamics has gained increasing importance with
the rise of large language model-based systems, which interact with users
across diverse contexts. In this work, we propose a novel computational
framework for constructing conversational graphs that capture the flow and
structure of loosely organized dialogues, referred to as quasi-patterned
conversations. We introduce the Filter & Reconnect method, a novel graph
simplification technique that minimizes noise while preserving semantic
coherence and structural integrity of conversational graphs. Through
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that the use of large language models
combined with our graph simplification technique has resulted in semantic
metric S increasing by a factor of 2.06 compared to previous approaches while
simultaneously enforcing a tree-like structure with 0 {\delta}-hyperbolicity,
ensuring optimal clarity in conversation modeling. This work provides a
computational method for analyzing large-scale dialogue datasets, with
practical applications related to monitoring automated systems such as
chatbots, dialogue management tools, and user behavior analytics.

Motivation: 传统临床评分量表资源密集且难以扩展，自动语音分析为FTD评估提供了客观、可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 整合ASR提取的停顿特征与语义连贯性指标，使用SVR预测FTD临床评分，并在三个数据集（AVH、TOPSY、PsyCL）中验证。

Result: 停顿特征单独预测FTD严重程度效果显著，结合语义指标后性能进一步提升（最高ρ=0.649，AUC=83.71%）。

Conclusion: 结合时间和语义分析的框架为改进精神病性言语障碍评估提供了方向。

Abstract: Formal thought disorder (FTD), a hallmark of schizophrenia spectrum
disorders, manifests as incoherent speech and poses challenges for clinical
assessment. Traditional clinical rating scales, though validated, are
resource-intensive and lack scalability. Automated speech analysis with
automatic speech recognition (ASR) allows for objective quantification of
linguistic and temporal features of speech, offering scalable alternatives. The
use of utterance timestamps in ASR captures pause dynamics, which are thought
to reflect the cognitive processes underlying speech production. However, the
utility of integrating these ASR-derived features for assessing FTD severity
requires further evaluation. This study integrates pause features with semantic
coherence metrics across three datasets: naturalistic self-recorded diaries
(AVH, n = 140), structured picture descriptions (TOPSY, n = 72), and dream
narratives (PsyCL, n = 43). We evaluated pause related features alongside
established coherence measures, using support vector regression (SVR) to
predict clinical FTD scores. Key findings demonstrate that pause features alone
robustly predict the severity of FTD. Integrating pause features with semantic
coherence metrics enhanced predictive performance compared to semantic-only
models, with integration of independent models achieving correlations up to
\r{ho} = 0.649 and AUC = 83.71% for severe cases detection (TOPSY, with best
\r{ho} = 0.584 and AUC = 79.23% for semantic-only models). The performance
gains from semantic and pause features integration held consistently across all
contexts, though the nature of pause patterns was dataset-dependent. These
findings suggest that frameworks combining temporal and semantic analyses
provide a roadmap for refining the assessment of disorganized speech and
advance automated speech analysis in psychosis.

Motivation: 现有研究多关注文本分类，而本研究旨在通过语言特征深入分析人类与机器生成文本的差异。

Method: 选择8个领域、11种LLM生成的数据集，计算依赖长度、情感等语言特征，结合采样策略、重复控制和模型发布时间进行统计分析。

Result: 人类文本句法更简单、语义更多样；人类和机器文本在不同领域均有风格差异，但人类变化更大；新模型生成文本风格趋同。

Conclusion: 机器生成文本风格逐渐趋同，而人类文本在语言特征上更具多样性。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly
improved their ability to generate natural language, making texts generated by
LLMs increasingly indistinguishable from human-written texts. While recent
research has primarily focused on using LLMs to classify text as either
human-written and machine-generated texts, our study focus on characterizing
these texts using a set of linguistic features across different linguistic
levels such as morphology, syntax, and semantics. We select a dataset of
human-written and machine-generated texts spanning 8 domains and produced by 11
different LLMs. We calculate different linguistic features such as dependency
length and emotionality and we use them for characterizing human-written and
machine-generated texts along with different sampling strategies, repetition
controls and model release date. Our statistical analysis reveals that
human-written texts tend to exhibit simpler syntactic structures and more
diverse semantic content. Furthermore, we calculate the variability of our set
of features across models and domains. Both human and machine texts show
stylistic diversity across domains, with humans displaying greater variation in
our features. Finally, we apply style embeddings to further test variability
among human-written and machine-generated texts. Notably, newer models output
text that is similarly variable, pointing to an homogenization of
machine-generated texts.

Conclusion: Seed-X为翻译研究和应用提供了高效的开源解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual translation stands as a challenging task for large language
models (LLMs) to handle intricate language patterns and stilted translations
that arise in automated translations. In this paper, we introduce Seed-X, a
family of open-source LLMs comprising instruct and reasoning models, pushing
the limits of translation capability with 7B parameter size. The base model is
pre-trained on a diverse, high-quality dataset encompassing both monolingual
and bilingual content across 28 languages, harnessing the full potential of
multilingual data. The instruct model is then finetuned to translate by
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and further enhanced through reinforcement
learning (RL) to achieve better generalization across diverse language pairs.
Seed-X achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models,
including Gemini-2.5 and GPT-4o, across 28 languages, and significantly
outperforms larger open-source models in both automatic metrics and human
evaluations. We share the best practices through our optimization process, and
make the parameter public available for advancing translation research and
applications.

Conclusion: CU-ICU是一种高效、可扩展的临床决策支持解决方案。

Abstract: Integrating large language models into specialized domains like healthcare
presents unique challenges, including domain adaptation and limited labeled
data. We introduce CU-ICU, a method for customizing unsupervised
instruction-finetuned language models for ICU datasets by leveraging the
Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture. CU-ICU employs a sparse
fine-tuning approach that combines few-shot prompting with selective parameter
updates, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal supervision. Our evaluation
across critical ICU tasks--early sepsis detection, mortality prediction, and
clinical note generation--demonstrates that CU-ICU consistently improves
predictive accuracy and interpretability over standard fine-tuning methods.
Notably, CU-ICU achieves up to a 15% increase in sepsis detection accuracy and
a 20% enhancement in generating clinically relevant explanations while updating
fewer than 1% of model parameters in its most efficient configuration. These
results establish CU-ICU as a scalable, low-overhead solution for delivering
accurate and interpretable clinical decision support in real-world ICU
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有级联方法依赖精确文本匹配，难以评估自由形式输出的可靠性，导致成本高且效果不佳。

Method: KiC框架通过识别弱模型输出的代表性答案，并评估其他响应的语义对齐程度，决定是否接受或升级到强模型。

Result: 实验表明，KiC在三个自由文本生成基准上达到GPT-4 97.53%的准确率，同时平均减少28.81%的API成本，并在特定基准上超越GPT-4。

Conclusion: KiC是一种高效且经济的自由文本生成框架，显著降低了成本并保持了高性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance
across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However,
high-performing models are typically accessible only via APIs, incurring
substantial inference costs. Cascade methods address this by initially
employing a cheaper model and escalating to a stronger one only when necessary.
Nevertheless, existing cascade approaches struggle to select a reliable
representative response and assess the overall reliability of free-form
outputs, as they rely on exact text matching. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Keyword-inspired Cascade (KiC), a novel framework for cost-efficient
free-form text generation. KiC identifies the most representative answer among
multiple outputs from a weaker model and evaluates the semantic alignment of
other responses with it. Based on the degree of alignment, KiC determines
whether to accept the weaker model's output or escalate to a stronger model.
Experiments on three free-form text generation benchmarks show that KiC
achieves 97.53 percent of GPT-4's accuracy while reducing API costs by 28.81
percent on average, and even outperforms GPT-4 in a specific benchmark.

TL;DR: LoopServe是一种自适应双阶段推理加速框架，用于多轮对话中的大语言模型，通过动态稀疏化和渐进键值压缩提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型在长对话中面临计算和内存挑战，现有加速方法依赖固定启发式，无法适应动态对话模式。

Method: LoopServe在预填充阶段动态选择注意力矩阵重要部分，解码阶段渐进压缩键值缓存。

Result: 实验表明，LoopServe在多轮对话任务中显著加速推理并优于现有基线。

Conclusion: LoopServe为长上下文对话提供高效且自适应的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large
language models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation
histories become longer, existing large language models face increasing
computational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide
efficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either
compress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on
fixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and
unpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,
we present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework
for large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two
main innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the
prefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the
attention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value
compression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient
cache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a
\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new
benchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query
positions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to
existing baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide
range of long-context dialogue tasks.

Motivation: 研究LLM在GRS中的表现，以验证其推荐和解释是否优于传统社会选择聚合策略。

Method: 比较LLM生成的推荐和解释与基于社会选择的聚合策略（如ADD聚合）。

Result: LLM推荐与ADD聚合相似，但解释常包含未定义标准；群体结构不影响推荐；标准聚合方法在大规模项目集上可能效率不足。

Conclusion: LLM在GRS中的应用需改进解释透明度和一致性，标准聚合方法可能需优化以适应更大规模数据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being implemented as joint
decision-makers and explanation generators for Group Recommender Systems (GRS).
In this paper, we evaluate these recommendations and explanations by comparing
them to social choice-based aggregation strategies. Our results indicate that
LLM-generated recommendations often resembled those produced by Additive
Utilitarian (ADD) aggregation. However, the explanations typically referred to
averaging ratings (resembling but not identical to ADD aggregation). Group
structure, uniform or divergent, did not impact the recommendations.
Furthermore, LLMs regularly claimed additional criteria such as user or item
similarity, diversity, or used undefined popularity metrics or thresholds. Our
findings have important implications for LLMs in the GRS pipeline as well as
standard aggregation strategies. Additional criteria in explanations were
dependent on the number of ratings in the group scenario, indicating potential
inefficiency of standard aggregation methods at larger item set sizes.
Additionally, inconsistent and ambiguous explanations undermine transparency
and explainability, which are key motivations behind the use of LLMs for GRS.

Motivation: 研究动机是基于法律现实主义与形式主义的争论，验证法官个体决策是否显著影响案件结果。

Method: 方法包括使用18,937份抚养权判决数据，比较基于个体法官历史判决的专家模型与基于聚合数据的通用模型，采用LLM提取特征并结合ML模型（RF、XGB、SVC）进行预测。

Result: 结果显示专家模型预测准确率更高（F1分数92.85%），通用模型为82.63%，表明法官个体决策模式对结果有显著影响。

Conclusion: 结论支持法律现实主义，证明法官身份对法律结果有可测量的影响，数据与代码将公开。

Abstract: This study examines the role of human judges in legal decision-making by
using machine learning to predict child physical custody outcomes in French
appellate courts. Building on the legal realism-formalism debate, we test
whether individual judges' decision-making patterns significantly influence
case outcomes, challenging the assumption that judges are neutral variables
that apply the law uniformly. To ensure compliance with French privacy laws, we
implement a strict pseudonymization process. Our analysis uses 18,937 living
arrangements rulings extracted from 10,306 cases. We compare models trained on
individual judges' past rulings (specialist models) with a judge-agnostic model
trained on aggregated data (generalist models). The prediction pipeline is a
hybrid approach combining large language models (LLMs) for structured feature
extraction and ML models for outcome prediction (RF, XGB and SVC). Our results
show that specialist models consistently achieve higher predictive accuracy
than the general model, with top-performing models reaching F1 scores as high
as 92.85%, compared to the generalist model's 82.63% trained on 20x to 100x
more samples. Specialist models capture stable individual patterns that are not
transferable to other judges. In-Domain and Cross-Domain validity tests provide
empirical support for legal realism, demonstrating that judicial identity plays
a measurable role in legal outcomes. All data and code used will be made
available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型常反映训练数据中的性别和性取向偏见，需减少此类偏见以提升包容性。

Method: 使用WinoQueer基准评估LoRA和软提示调优技术，对比其在三种开源LLM中的偏见缓解效果。

Result: LoRA（<0.1%额外参数）显著降低偏见分数（最多50分），软提示调优效果有限。

Conclusion: LoRA能以低计算成本显著提升公平性，建议推广社区参与的PEFT技术并扩展评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently reproduce the gender- and
sexual-identity prejudices embedded in their training corpora, leading to
outputs that marginalize LGBTQIA+ users. Hence, reducing such biases is of
great importance. To achieve this, we evaluate two parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques - Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and soft-prompt
tuning - as lightweight alternatives to full-model fine-tuning for mitigating
such biases. Using the WinoQueer benchmark, we quantify bias in three
open-source LLMs and observe baseline bias scores reaching up to 98 (out of
100) across a range of queer identities defined by gender and/or sexual
orientation, where 50 would indicate neutrality. Fine-tuning with LoRA (< 0.1%
additional parameters) on a curated QueerNews corpus reduces those scores by up
to 50 points and raises neutrality from virtually 0% to as much as 36%.
Soft-prompt tuning (10 virtual tokens) delivers only marginal improvements.
These findings show that LoRA can deliver meaningful fairness gains with
minimal computation. We advocate broader adoption of community-informed PEFT,
the creation of larger queer-authored corpora, and richer evaluation suites
beyond WinoQueer, coupled with ongoing audits to keep LLMs inclusive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型对提示的微小变化高度敏感，可能导致不当内容生成，因此需要研究提示设计如何影响VLMs的越狱行为。

Method: 分析了三种关键因素（详细视觉信息、对抗样本、积极开头短语）对越狱的影响，并提出了一种基于内部层跳跃连接的框架。

Result: 多模态环境下VLMs的防御能力下降，三种因素均可独立触发越狱，少量上下文示例即可诱导不当输出。跳跃连接框架显著提高了越狱成功率。

Conclusion: VLMs在多模态环境中存在复杂漏洞，即使是看似无害的内容（如表情包）也可能引发不当输出，需进一步研究防御机制。

Abstract: Language models are highly sensitive to prompt formulations - small changes
in input can drastically alter their output. This raises a critical question:
To what extent can prompt sensitivity be exploited to generate inapt content?
In this paper, we investigate how discrete components of prompt design
influence the generation of inappropriate content in Visual Language Models
(VLMs). Specifically, we analyze the impact of three key factors on successful
jailbreaks: (a) the inclusion of detailed visual information, (b) the presence
of adversarial examples, and (c) the use of positively framed beginning
phrases. Our findings reveal that while a VLM can reliably distinguish between
benign and harmful inputs in unimodal settings (text-only or image-only), this
ability significantly degrades in multimodal contexts. Each of the three
factors is independently capable of triggering a jailbreak, and we show that
even a small number of in-context examples (as few as three) can push the model
toward generating inappropriate outputs. Furthermore, we propose a framework
that utilizes a skip-connection between two internal layers of the VLM, which
substantially increases jailbreak success rates, even when using benign images.
Finally, we demonstrate that memes, often perceived as humorous or harmless,
can be as effective as toxic visuals in eliciting harmful content, underscoring
the subtle and complex vulnerabilities of VLMs.

Result: 实验表明GSDMM+在效率和效果上优于经典和最新方法。

Conclusion: GSDMM+有效解决了短文本聚类的挑战，代码已开源。

Abstract: Short text clustering has become increasingly important with the popularity
of social media like Twitter, Google+, and Facebook. Existing methods can be
broadly categorized into two paradigms: topic model-based approaches and deep
representation learning-based approaches. This task is inherently challenging
due to the sparse, large-scale, and high-dimensional characteristics of the
short text data. Furthermore, the computational intensity required by
representation learning significantly increases the running time. To address
these issues, we propose a collapsed Gibbs Sampling algorithm for the Dirichlet
Multinomial Mixture model (GSDMM), which effectively handles the sparsity and
high dimensionality of short texts while identifying representative words for
each cluster. Based on several aspects of GSDMM that warrant further
refinement, we propose an improved approach, GSDMM+, designed to further
optimize its performance. GSDMM+ reduces initialization noise and adaptively
adjusts word weights based on entropy, achieving fine-grained clustering that
reveals more topic-related information. Additionally, strategic cluster merging
is employed to refine clustering granularity, better aligning the predicted
distribution with the true category distribution. We conduct extensive
experiments, comparing our methods with both classical and state-of-the-art
approaches. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of our methods. The source code for our model is publicly
available at https://github.com/chehaoa/VEMC.

Conclusion: 知识图谱方法在提取科学文章核心内容方面表现更优，且模型微调是关键。

Abstract: When deciding to read an article or incorporate it into their research,
scholars often seek to quickly identify and understand its main ideas. In this
paper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific
articles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct
approaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient
paragraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking
these questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and
subsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content
of the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires
comparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach
leverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by
fine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles
and using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction
method to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as
the centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure
assesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article
compared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs
using both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
through a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions
and answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively
captures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings
indicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is
crucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.

Result: 负面情绪词汇频率与抑郁和焦虑严重程度显著正相关；第一人称单数代词使用频率与心理状态无显著关联。

Conclusion: 文化背景和会话动态对心理健康交流中的语言使用有复杂影响，为中文人群的心理治疗实践提供了新的心理语言学标记。

Abstract: This study explores the relationship between linguistic expressions and
psychological states of depression and anxiety within Chinese psycho-counseling
interactions, focusing specifically on the usage of first-person singular
pronouns and negative emotional words. Utilizing a corpus derived from 735
online counseling sessions, the analysis employed a general linear mixed-effect
model to assess linguistic patterns quantified by the Linguistic Inquiry and
Word Count (LIWC) software. Results indicate a significant positive correlation
between the frequency of negative emotional words and the severity of both
depressive and anxious states among clients. However, contrary to prior
findings predominantly derived from English-language contexts, the usage
frequency of first-person singular pronouns did not vary significantly with the
clients' psychological conditions. These outcomes are discussed within the
framework of cultural distinctions between collectivist Chinese contexts and
individualistic Western settings, as well as the interactive dynamics unique to
psycho-counseling conversations. The findings highlight the nuanced influence
of cultural and conversational contexts on language use in mental health
communications, providing insights into psycholinguistic markers relevant to
therapeutic practices in Chinese-speaking populations.

Motivation: 研究侦探小说中公平竞争的平衡问题，为故事质量提供量化标准。

Method: 提出概率框架，定义公平竞争及其衡量指标，并应用于LLM生成的侦探故事。

Result: LLM生成的故事虽不可预测，但未能平衡惊喜与公平竞争，导致质量较差。

Conclusion: LLM生成的故事需改进以平衡惊喜与公平竞争，提升质量。

Abstract: Effective storytelling relies on a delicate balance between meeting the
reader's prior expectations and introducing unexpected developments. In the
domain of detective fiction, this tension is known as fair play, which includes
the implicit agreement between the writer and the reader as to the range of
possible resolutions the mystery story may have. In this work, we present a
probabilistic framework for detective fiction that allows us to define desired
qualities. Using this framework, we formally define fair play and design
appropriate metrics for it. Stemming from these definitions is an inherent
tension between the coherence of the story, which measures how much it ``makes
sense'', and the surprise it induces. We validate the framework by applying it
to LLM-generated detective stories. This domain is appealing since we have an
abundance of data, we can sample from the distribution generating the story,
and the story-writing capabilities of LLMs are interesting in their own right.
Results show that while LLM-generated stories may be unpredictable, they
generally fail to balance the trade-off between surprise and fair play, which
greatly contributes to their poor quality.

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased
greatly over the last few years, as have their size and complexity.
Nonetheless, the use of LLMs in production remains challenging due to their
unpredictable nature and discrepancies that can exist between their desired
behavior and their actual model output. In this paper, we introduce a new tool,
InTraVisTo (Inside Transformer Visualisation Tool), designed to enable
researchers to investigate and trace the computational process that generates
each token in a Transformer-based LLM. InTraVisTo provides a visualization of
both the internal state of the Transformer model (by decoding token embeddings
at each layer of the model) and the information flow between the various
components across the different layers of the model (using a Sankey diagram).
With InTraVisTo, we aim to help researchers and practitioners better understand
the computations being performed within the Transformer model and thus to shed
some light on internal patterns and reasoning processes employed by LLMs.

Result: 统一数据集训练的模型泛化能力差，多头模型略有改进，基于图的模型未显著优于BERT-base-NER。

Conclusion: 标签统一和模型改进的尝试效果有限，未来需探索更有效的标签标准化和模型架构。

Abstract: The field of cybersecurity NER lacks standardized labels, making it
challenging to combine datasets. We investigate label unification across four
cybersecurity datasets to increase data resource usability. We perform a
coarse-grained label unification and conduct pairwise cross-dataset evaluations
using BiLSTM models. Qualitative analysis of predictions reveals errors,
limitations, and dataset differences. To address unification limitations, we
propose alternative architectures including a multihead model and a graph-based
transfer model. Results show that models trained on unified datasets generalize
poorly across datasets. The multihead model with weight sharing provides only
marginal improvements over unified training, while our graph-based transfer
model built on BERT-base-NER shows no significant performance gains compared
BERT-base-NER.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过合成数据、拼接单语音频和利用真实语码转换数据提升加泰罗尼亚语-西班牙语语码转换的自动语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语码转换（CS）在自动语音识别（ASR）中因训练数据稀缺和语言相似性而面临挑战，尤其在多语言社会中普遍存在。

Method: 采用三种策略：生成合成CS数据、拼接单语音频、利用带语言标记的真实CS数据，并基于Whisper模型进行微调。

Result: 结合少量合成CS数据和主要语言标记的模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 合成数据与语言标记结合的方法有效提升了CS-ASR性能。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS), the alternating use of two or more languages, challenges
automatic speech recognition (ASR) due to scarce training data and linguistic
similarities. The lack of dedicated CS datasets limits ASR performance, as most
models rely on monolingual or mixed-language corpora that fail to reflect
real-world CS patterns. This issue is critical in multilingual societies where
CS occurs in informal and formal settings. A key example is Catalan-Spanish CS,
widely used in media and parliamentary speeches. In this work, we improve ASR
for Catalan-Spanish CS by exploring three strategies: (1) generating synthetic
CS data, (2) concatenating monolingual audio, and (3) leveraging real CS data
with language tokens. We extract CS data from Catalan speech corpora and
fine-tune OpenAI's Whisper models, making them available on Hugging Face.
Results show that combining a modest amount of synthetic CS data with the
dominant language token yields the best transcription performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着对个人和专业技能的重视增加，需要可扩展的系统来测量和评估这些技能，而传统的人工评分方法难以满足规模化需求。

Method: 使用大型语言模型（LLMs）从SJT回答中提取与构建相关的特征，并以Casper SJT为例验证方法的有效性。

Result: 研究表明，该方法为自动化评分个人和专业技能奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 本文提出的方法为解决SJT规模化评分问题提供了新思路，并展示了LLMs在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Academic programs are increasingly recognizing the importance of personal and
professional skills and their critical role alongside technical expertise in
preparing students for future success in diverse career paths. With this
growing demand comes the need for scalable systems to measure, evaluate, and
develop these skills. Situational Judgment Tests (SJTs) offer one potential
avenue for measuring these skills in a standardized and reliable way, but
open-response SJTs have traditionally relied on trained human raters for
evaluation, presenting operational challenges to delivering SJTs at scale. Past
attempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due
to issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore
a novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses
using large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the
efficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future
developments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.

Motivation: 现有方法在政治倾向和政治性分类任务中表现不佳，尤其是在分布外文本上。论文旨在通过整合数据集和改进模型，提升分类的泛化能力。

Method: 整合了12个政治倾向分类数据集，并扩展了18个现有数据集以构建新的政治性分类数据集。采用留一法和留出法进行基准测试，评估现有模型并训练具有更好泛化能力的新模型。

Result: 通过实验验证了整合数据集和改进模型的有效性，提升了模型在分布外文本上的分类性能。

Conclusion: 论文通过数据整合和模型优化，显著提升了政治倾向和政治性分类任务的泛化能力，为未来研究提供了新的方向。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of automatically classifying text
according to political leaning and politicalness using transformer models. We
compose a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and models for these
tasks, finding that current approaches create siloed solutions that perform
poorly on out-of-distribution texts. To address this limitation, we compile a
diverse dataset by combining 12 datasets for political leaning classification
and creating a new dataset for politicalness by extending 18 existing datasets
with the appropriate label. Through extensive benchmarking with leave-one-in
and leave-one-out methodologies, we evaluate the performance of existing models
and train new ones with enhanced generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，当前和近期的AI说服力主要来自后训练和提示方法，而非个性化或模型规模扩大，但这些方法在提高说服力的同时降低了事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估对话AI对人类信念的潜在影响，尤其是其说服力来源及其与事实准确性的关系。

Method: 通过三个大规模实验（N=76,977），测试19个LLM在707个政治议题上的说服力，并检查466,769条生成内容的事实准确性。

Result: 后训练和提示方法分别将说服力提升51%和27%，但这些方法同时降低了事实准确性。

Conclusion: AI的说服力提升更多依赖于后训练和提示方法，但这些方法可能以牺牲事实准确性为代价。

Abstract: There are widespread fears that conversational AI could soon exert
unprecedented influence over human beliefs. Here, in three large-scale
experiments (N=76,977), we deployed 19 LLMs-including some post-trained
explicitly for persuasion-to evaluate their persuasiveness on 707 political
issues. We then checked the factual accuracy of 466,769 resulting LLM claims.
Contrary to popular concerns, we show that the persuasive power of current and
near-future AI is likely to stem more from post-training and prompting
methods-which boosted persuasiveness by as much as 51% and 27%
respectively-than from personalization or increasing model scale. We further
show that these methods increased persuasion by exploiting LLMs' unique ability
to rapidly access and strategically deploy information and that, strikingly,
where they increased AI persuasiveness they also systematically decreased
factual accuracy.

Motivation: 探讨LLMs在MCQA中的首因效应偏差及其影响。

Method: 通过语义相似性重排选项，无需正确答案知识。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提升MCQA性能。

Conclusion: 偏差既是挑战也是机会，为偏置感知模型设计提供启示。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in many Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks, leveraging extensive pre-training and fine-tuning to
achieve high accuracy. However, like humans, LLMs exhibit biases, particularly
positional biases such as primacy and recency effects, which can influence the
accuracy of the answers. The primacy effect-where items presented first are
more likely to be remembered or selected-plays a key role in Multiple Choice
Question Answering (MCQA), where the order of answer options can affect
prediction outcomes. This study focuses on primacy bias in fine-tuned LLMs: We
first show that fine-tuning amplifies this bias, probably due to exposure to
human-like patterns. Hence, we strategically leverage this effect by reordering
response options based on semantic similarity to the query, without requiring
knowledge of the correct answer. Our experimental results show that this
approach significantly improves performance in MCQA. More generally, our
findings underscore the dual nature of biases as both challenges and
opportunities, offering insights for bias-aware model design and NLP
applications.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于知识图谱（KG）的任务生成管道，通过合成任务来训练语言模型，使其能够组合领域概念进行推理。在医学领域验证了方法的有效性，并展示了模型QwQ-Med-3在医学推理任务上的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语言模型的训练方式难以获得深层次领域专业知识，需要一种自底向上的方法，通过组合简单概念来构建复杂知识。知识图谱提供了这种组合结构。

Method: 设计了一个任务生成管道，直接从KG原语合成任务，并基于此训练语言模型。在医学领域使用QwQ-32B模型进行微调，得到QwQ-Med-3。

Result: QwQ-Med-3在ICD-Bench评估套件中显著优于现有推理模型，并在最困难任务上表现突出。此外，其在医学问答基准测试中提升了基础模型的性能。

Conclusion: 论文展示了通过组合领域特定知识实现领域超级智能的潜力，为通用人工智能（AGI）的发展提供了一种新思路。

Abstract: Language models traditionally used for cross-domain generalization have
recently demonstrated task-specific reasoning. However, their top-down training
approach on general corpora is insufficient for acquiring abstractions needed
for deep domain expertise. This may require a bottom-up approach that acquires
expertise by learning to compose simple domain concepts into more complex ones.
A knowledge graph (KG) provides this compositional structure, where domain
primitives are represented as head-relation-tail edges and their paths encode
higher-level concepts. We present a task generation pipeline that synthesizes
tasks directly from KG primitives, enabling models to acquire and compose them
for reasoning. We fine-tune language models on the resultant KG-grounded
curriculum to demonstrate domain-specific superintelligence. While broadly
applicable, we validate our approach in medicine, where reliable KGs exist.
Using a medical KG, we curate 24,000 reasoning tasks paired with thinking
traces derived from diverse medical primitives. We fine-tune the QwQ-32B model
on this curriculum to obtain QwQ-Med-3 that takes a step towards medical
superintelligence. We also introduce ICD-Bench, an evaluation suite to quantify
reasoning abilities across 15 medical domains. Our experiments demonstrate that
QwQ-Med-3 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art reasoning models on
ICD-Bench categories. Further analysis reveals that QwQ-Med-3 utilizes acquired
primitives to widen the performance gap on the hardest tasks of ICD-Bench.
Finally, evaluation on medical question-answer benchmarks shows that QwQ-Med-3
transfers acquired expertise to enhance the base model's performance. While the
industry's approach to artificial general intelligence (AGI) emphasizes broad
expertise, we envision a future in which AGI emerges from the composable
interaction of efficient domain-specific superintelligent agents.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用的阿拉伯语语音和文本处理方法，并基于FastConformer架构训练了两个新模型：一个针对现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA），另一个是首个统一的MSA和古典阿拉伯语（CA）公共模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语自动语音识别（ASR）系统的发展面临挑战，尤其是语言复杂性和方言多样性。现有研究多集中于MSA，而忽略了其他变体。

Method: 采用通用方法处理阿拉伯语语音和文本，基于FastConformer架构训练了两个模型：MSA专用模型和统一的MSA-CA模型。

Result: MSA模型在相关数据集上达到SOTA性能，统一模型在CA带标音符号的任务中表现最佳，同时保持MSA的强性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了阿拉伯语ASR的独特挑战，开源模型和训练方法促进了可重复性。

Abstract: Despite Arabic being one of the most widely spoken languages, the development
of Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems faces significant
challenges due to the language's complexity, and only a limited number of
public Arabic ASR models exist. While much of the focus has been on Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA), there is considerably less attention given to the
variations within the language. This paper introduces a universal methodology
for Arabic speech and text processing designed to address unique challenges of
the language. Using this methodology, we train two novel models based on the
FastConformer architecture: one designed specifically for MSA and the other,
the first unified public model for both MSA and Classical Arabic (CA). The MSA
model sets a new benchmark with state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on related
datasets, while the unified model achieves SOTA accuracy with diacritics for CA
while maintaining strong performance for MSA. To promote reproducibility, we
open-source the models and their training recipes.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在捕捉人类移动轨迹时空依赖关系时的高计算成本和序列长度问题。

Method: 将轨迹分段为每日标记，利用分层注意力编码，结合预计算提示嵌入增强LLMs的推理能力，同时冻结LLM主干以减少计算开销。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，准确率提升2.4%，周末表现提升5.0%，训练时间减少24.6%。

Conclusion: RHYTHM通过分层标记化和冻结LLM主干，显著提升了时空预测的效率和性能。

Abstract: We introduce RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for
Human Mobility), a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners. RHYTHM partitions
trajectories into daily segments encoded as discrete tokens with hierarchical
attention, capturing both daily and weekly dependencies while substantially
reducing the sequence length. Token representations are enriched with
pre-computed prompt embeddings via a frozen LLM, enhancing the model's ability
to capture interdependencies without extensive computational overhead. By
freezing the LLM backbone, RHYTHM achieves significant computational
efficiency. Evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates a 2.4%
improvement in accuracy, 5.0% increase on weekends, and 24.6% reduction in
training time compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 解决文档级情感分析中如何选择最佳分类模型的问题，结合多评价标准和专家知识。

Method: 使用CPC计算评价标准权重，构建加权决策矩阵，比较多种基线模型（如ALBERT、LSTM等）在三个社交媒体数据集上的表现。

Result: ALBERT在排除时间因素时表现最佳；考虑时间消耗时，无单一模型始终最优。

Conclusion: CPC-CMS框架适用于其他分类任务，为模型选择提供了一种系统化方法。

Abstract: This study proposes the Cognitive Pairwise Comparison Classification Model
Selection (CPC-CMS) framework for document-level sentiment analysis. The CPC,
based on expert knowledge judgment, is used to calculate the weights of
evaluation criteria, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
specificity, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa (Kappa), and
efficiency. Naive Bayes, Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), Random
Forest, Logistic Regression, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and A Lite Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers (ALBERT) are chosen as classification baseline models. A weighted
decision matrix consisting of classification evaluation scores with respect to
criteria weights, is formed to select the best classification model for a
classification problem. Three open datasets of social media are used to
demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CPC-CMS. Based on our simulation,
for evaluation results excluding the time factor, ALBERT is the best for the
three datasets; if time consumption is included, no single model always
performs better than the other models. The CPC-CMS can be applied to the other
classification applications in different areas.

Conclusion: 选择适合特定生物医学应用的模型时需综合考虑任务需求、性能和隐私等因素。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of cost-efficient Large
Language Models (LLMs) for diverse biomedical tasks spanning both text and
image modalities. We evaluated a range of closed-source and open-source LLMs on
tasks such as biomedical text classification and generation, question
answering, and multimodal image processing. Our experimental findings indicate
that there is no single LLM that can consistently outperform others across all
tasks. Instead, different LLMs excel in different tasks. While some
closed-source LLMs demonstrate strong performance on specific tasks, their
open-source counterparts achieve comparable results (sometimes even better),
with additional benefits like faster inference and enhanced privacy. Our
experimental results offer valuable insights for selecting models that are
optimally suited for specific biomedical applications.

Motivation: AI系统在协作角色中需要推理共享目标和信念，而现有RSA扩展在多轮协作场景中面临挑战。

Method: 引入CRSA框架，基于信息论扩展RSA，优化增益函数以建模多轮对话，考虑对话中双方的私有信息和条件生成。

Result: 在指代游戏和医患对话实验中，CRSA表现出更一致、可解释和协作的行为。

Conclusion: CRSA为更实用和社交意识的语言代理提供了新途径。

Abstract: As AI systems take on collaborative roles, they must reason about shared
goals and beliefs-not just generate fluent language. The Rational Speech Act
(RSA) framework offers a principled approach to pragmatic reasoning, but
existing extensions face challenges in scaling to multi-turn, collaborative
scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Collaborative Rational Speech Act
(CRSA), an information-theoretic (IT) extension of RSA that models multi-turn
dialog by optimizing a gain function adapted from rate-distortion theory. This
gain is an extension of the gain model that is maximized in the original RSA
model but takes into account the scenario in which both agents in a
conversation have private information and produce utterances conditioned on the
dialog. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CRSA on referential games and
template-based doctor-patient dialogs in the medical domain. Empirical results
show that CRSA yields more consistent, interpretable, and collaborative
behavior than existing baselines-paving the way for more pragmatic and socially
aware language agents.

TL;DR: DENSE系统通过模拟医生参考历史记录的方式，生成临床连贯且时间敏感的进展笔记，填补了电子健康记录中进展笔记的缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 进展笔记在电子健康记录中具有重要临床意义，但在大规模数据集中严重不足（如MIMIC-III中仅8.56%的访问包含进展笔记），导致患者纵向叙事不完整。

Method: DENSE系统通过细粒度笔记分类和时间对齐机制，结合临床检索策略和大语言模型（LLM），生成连贯的进展笔记。

Result: 生成的笔记在时间对齐比例上达到1.089，优于原始笔记的连续性，支持下游任务如摘要、预测建模和临床决策支持。

Conclusion: DENSE为实际医疗环境中基于LLM的笔记合成提供了可扩展的解决方案，增强了叙事的连贯性。

Abstract: Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an
Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a
patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their
importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For
instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III
(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\%$ of hospital visits include progress
notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the
dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different
aspects of care.
  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered
Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by
simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress
notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal
alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into
structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically
informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant
content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to
prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and
temporally aware progress notes.
  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and
complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong
longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,
surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative
coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved
downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical
decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in
real-world healthcare settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PLABA 赛道展示了大型语言模型在将生物医学文献转化为通俗语言方面的潜力，但也指出了其不足和改进自动评估工具的必要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学文献的专业性使其难以被患者和护理人员理解，而语言模型的不可预测性和潜在风险需要严格评估。

Method: 通过 2023 和 2024 年的文本检索会议，设置了两个任务：完整改写摘要（任务 1）和替换难词（任务 2），并进行了自动和人工评估。

Result: 任务 1 中，表现最佳的模型在事实准确性和完整性上接近人类水平，但在简洁性上不足；任务 2 中，系统在识别难词和替换策略上表现不佳，但生成替换内容时表现较好。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型在生物医学文献通俗化方面有潜力，但仍需改进自动评估工具和模型表现。

Abstract: Objective: Recent advances in language models have shown potential to adapt
professional-facing biomedical literature to plain language, making it
accessible to patients and caregivers. However, their unpredictability,
combined with the high potential for harm in this domain, means rigorous
evaluation is necessary. Our goals with this track were to stimulate research
and to provide high-quality evaluation of the most promising systems.
  Methods: We hosted the Plain Language Adaptation of Biomedical Abstracts
(PLABA) track at the 2023 and 2024 Text Retrieval Conferences. Tasks included
complete, sentence-level, rewriting of abstracts (Task 1) as well as
identifying and replacing difficult terms (Task 2). For automatic evaluation of
Task 1, we developed a four-fold set of professionally-written references.
Submissions for both Tasks 1 and 2 were provided extensive manual evaluation
from biomedical experts.
  Results: Twelve teams spanning twelve countries participated in the track,
with models from multilayer perceptrons to large pretrained transformers. In
manual judgments of Task 1, top-performing models rivaled human levels of
factual accuracy and completeness, but not simplicity or brevity. Automatic,
reference-based metrics generally did not correlate well with manual judgments.
In Task 2, systems struggled with identifying difficult terms and classifying
how to replace them. When generating replacements, however, LLM-based systems
did well in manually judged accuracy, completeness, and simplicity, though not
in brevity.
  Conclusion: The PLABA track showed promise for using Large Language Models to
adapt biomedical literature for the general public, while also highlighting
their deficiencies and the need for improved automatic benchmarking tools.

Abstract: Due to its extensive applications, aerial image object detection has long
been a hot topic in computer vision. In recent years, advancements in Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology have further propelled this field to new
heights, giving rise to a broader range of application requirements. However,
traditional UAV aerial object detection methods primarily focus on detecting
predefined categories, which significantly limits their applicability. The
advent of cross-modal text-image alignment (e.g., CLIP) has overcome this
limitation, enabling open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), which can
identify previously unseen objects through natural language descriptions. This
breakthrough significantly enhances the intelligence and autonomy of UAVs in
aerial scene understanding. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of OVOD
in the context of UAV aerial scenes. We begin by aligning the core principles
of OVOD with the unique characteristics of UAV vision, setting the stage for a
specialized discussion. Building on this foundation, we construct a systematic
taxonomy that categorizes existing OVOD methods for aerial imagery and provides
a comprehensive overview of the relevant datasets. This structured review
enables us to critically dissect the key challenges and open problems at the
intersection of these fields. Finally, based on this analysis, we outline
promising future research directions and application prospects. This survey

TL;DR: EDNIG是一种基于U-Net架构的低光照图像增强深度学习框架，通过亮度图引导和SPP模块提升性能，结合GAN框架优化，实验表现优异且模型复杂度低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低光照图像增强问题，通过亮度引导和多尺度特征提取提升模型性能。

Method: 结合U-Net架构、亮度图引导、SPP模块和Swish激活函数，采用GAN框架和复合损失函数优化。

Result: EDNIG在定量指标和视觉质量上优于现有方法，且模型复杂度较低。

Conclusion: EDNIG适用于实际应用，性能优越且高效。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel deep learning framework for low-light image
enhancement, named the Encoder-Decoder Network with Illumination Guidance
(EDNIG). Building upon the U-Net architecture, EDNIG integrates an illumination
map, derived from Bright Channel Prior (BCP), as a guidance input. This
illumination guidance helps the network focus on underexposed regions,
effectively steering the enhancement process. To further improve the model's
representational power, a Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) module is incorporated
to extract multi-scale contextual features, enabling better handling of diverse
lighting conditions. Additionally, the Swish activation function is employed to
ensure smoother gradient propagation during training. EDNIG is optimized within
a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework using a composite loss
function that combines adversarial loss, pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE),
and perceptual loss. Experimental results show that EDNIG achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in quantitative metrics and
visual quality, while maintaining lower model complexity, demonstrating its
suitability for real-world applications. The source code for this work is

### [47] [VLMs have Tunnel Vision: Evaluating Nonlocal Visual Reasoning in Leading VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13361)
*Shmuel Berman,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在非局部视觉推理任务中的表现，发现即使顶尖模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）在简单任务中也表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索VLMs在需要从图像多个区域链式推理的任务中的能力，填补现有研究对非局部视觉推理的空白。

Method: 通过设计三种非局部视觉任务（比较感知、扫视搜索和平滑视觉搜索）来测试模型，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 结果显示，即使表现优秀的模型在这些任务中几乎无法超越随机准确率，远低于人类水平。

Conclusion: 结论是当前模型在视觉推理能力上仍有核心缺陷，尽管其原始视觉敏锐度有所提升。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) excel at complex visual tasks such as VQA and
chart understanding, yet recent work suggests they struggle with simple
perceptual tests. We present an evaluation that tests vision-language models'
capacity for nonlocal visual reasoning -- reasoning that requires chaining
evidence collected from multiple, possibly distant, regions of an image. We
isolate three distinct forms of non-local vision: comparative perception, which
demands holding two images in working memory and comparing them; saccadic
search, which requires making discrete, evidence-driven jumps to locate
successive targets; and smooth visual search, which involves searching smoothly
along a continuous contour. Flagship models (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude
Vision 3.7, GPT-o4-mini), even those that perform well on prior
primitive-vision benchmarks, fail these tests and barely exceed random accuracy
on two variants of our tasks that are trivial for humans. Our structured
evaluation suite allows us to test if VLMs can perform similar visual
algorithms to humans. Our findings show that despite gains in raw visual
acuity, current models lack core visual reasoning capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLMs）的空间推理能力，通过链式思维（CoT）提示和强化学习改进性能。发现结构化多阶段提示（SceneGraph CoT）显著提升准确性，而简单CoT可能损害性能。强化学习方法GRPO在SAT数据集上表现优于监督微调（SFT），尤其在分布外（OOD）条件下更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过提示策略和强化学习提升VLMs的空间推理能力，解决现有方法（如SFT）在泛化和鲁棒性上的不足。

Method: 1. 评估不同CoT提示策略的效果；2. 提出SceneGraph CoT结构化提示；3. 使用GRPO强化学习方法在SAT数据集上微调模型。

Result: SceneGraph CoT显著提升空间推理准确性；GRPO在Pass@1评估和OOD条件下优于SFT，泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和强化学习（如GRPO）能有效提升VLMs的空间推理能力和泛化性能，避免SFT的过拟合问题。

Abstract: This study investigates the spatial reasoning capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement
learning. We begin by evaluating the impact of different prompting strategies
and find that simple CoT formats, where the model generates a reasoning step
before the answer, not only fail to help, but can even harm the model's
original performance. In contrast, structured multi-stage prompting based on
scene graphs (SceneGraph CoT) significantly improves spatial reasoning
accuracy. Furthermore, to improve spatial reasoning ability, we fine-tune
models using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on the SAT dataset and
evaluate their performance on CVBench. Compared to supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), GRPO achieves higher accuracy on Pass@1 evaluations and demonstrates
superior robustness under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions. In particular,
we find that SFT overfits to surface-level linguistic patterns and may degrade
performance when test-time phrasing changes (e.g., from "closer to" to "farther
from"). GRPO, on the other hand, generalizes more reliably and maintains stable
performance under such shifts. Our findings provide insights into how
reinforcement learning and structured prompting improve the spatial reasoning
capabilities and generalization behavior of modern VLMs. All code is open

Conclusion: 2D基础模型在可扩展3D感知中具有巨大潜力，方法开源且适用于开放世界场景。

Abstract: Modern 3D object detection datasets are constrained by narrow class
taxonomies and costly manual annotations, limiting their ability to scale to
open-world settings. In contrast, 2D vision-language models trained on
web-scale image-text pairs exhibit rich semantic understanding and support
open-vocabulary detection via natural language prompts. In this work, we
leverage the maturity and category diversity of 2D foundation models to perform
open-vocabulary 3D object detection without any human-annotated 3D labels.
  Our pipeline uses a 2D vision-language detector to generate text-conditioned
proposals, which are segmented with SAM and back-projected into 3D using camera
geometry and either LiDAR or monocular pseudo-depth. We introduce a geometric
inflation strategy based on DBSCAN clustering and Rotating Calipers to infer 3D
bounding boxes without training. To simulate adverse real-world conditions, we
construct Pseudo-nuScenes, a fog-augmented, RGB-only variant of the nuScenes
dataset.
  Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive localization
performance across multiple settings, including LiDAR-based and purely RGB-D
inputs, all while remaining training-free and open-vocabulary. Our results
highlight the untapped potential of 2D foundation models for scalable 3D
perception. We open-source our code and resources at

Abstract: We present a novel multimodal multitask network and associated training
algorithm. The method is capable of ingesting data from approximately 12
different modalities namely image, video, audio, text, depth, point cloud, time
series, tabular, graph, X-ray, infrared, IMU, and hyperspectral. The proposed
approach utilizes modality specialized tokenizers, a shared transformer
architecture, and cross-attention mechanisms to project the data from different
modalities into a unified embedding space. It addresses multimodal and
multitask scenarios by incorporating modality-specific task heads for different
tasks in respective modalities. We propose a novel pretraining strategy with
iterative modality switching to initialize the network, and a training
algorithm which trades off fully joint training over all modalities, with
training on pairs of modalities at a time. We provide comprehensive evaluation
across 25 datasets from 12 modalities and show state of the art performances,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture, pretraining
strategy and adapted multitask training.

Conclusion: Butter通过层次特征优化，在精度、可部署性和计算效率之间取得了平衡，适用于实时自动驾驶场景。

Abstract: Hierarchical feature representations play a pivotal role in computer vision,
particularly in object detection for autonomous driving. Multi-level semantic
understanding is crucial for accurately identifying pedestrians, vehicles, and
traffic signs in dynamic environments. However, existing architectures, such as
YOLO and DETR, struggle to maintain feature consistency across different scales
while balancing detection precision and computational efficiency. To address
these challenges, we propose Butter, a novel object detection framework
designed to enhance hierarchical feature representations for improving
detection robustness. Specifically, Butter introduces two key innovations:
Frequency-Adaptive Feature Consistency Enhancement (FAFCE) Component, which
refines multi-scale feature consistency by leveraging adaptive frequency
filtering to enhance structural and boundary precision, and Progressive
Hierarchical Feature Fusion Network (PHFFNet) Module, which progressively
integrates multi-level features to mitigate semantic gaps and strengthen
hierarchical feature learning. Through extensive experiments on BDD100K, KITTI,
and Cityscapes, Butter demonstrates superior feature representation
capabilities, leading to notable improvements in detection accuracy while
reducing model complexity. By focusing on hierarchical feature refinement and
integration, Butter provides an advanced approach to object detection that
achieves a balance between accuracy, deployability, and computational
efficiency in real-time autonomous driving scenarios. Our model and
implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/Aveiro-Lin/Butter,

Method: 利用GPT-4.1分析查询意图并预测信息需求，动态路由查询到ASR、OCR和视觉索引，平均每查询使用1.78种模态。

Result: 在180万视频片段上的评估显示，智能路由减少了基础设施成本，同时保持竞争力。

Conclusion: ModaRoute为多模态检索系统的规模化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ModaRoute, an LLM-based intelligent routing system that
dynamically selects optimal modalities for multimodal video retrieval. While
dense text captions can achieve 75.9% Recall@5, they require expensive offline
processing and miss critical visual information present in 34% of clips with
scene text not captured by ASR. By analyzing query intent and predicting
information needs, ModaRoute reduces computational overhead by 41% while
achieving 60.9% Recall@5. Our approach uses GPT-4.1 to route queries across ASR
(speech), OCR (text), and visual indices, averaging 1.78 modalities per query
versus exhaustive 3.0 modality search. Evaluation on 1.8M video clips
demonstrates that intelligent routing provides a practical solution for scaling
multimodal retrieval systems, reducing infrastructure costs while maintaining
competitive effectiveness for real-world deployment.

Abstract: Industrial defect detection is vital for upholding product quality across
contemporary manufacturing systems. As the expectations for precision,
automation, and scalability intensify, conventional inspection approaches are
increasingly found wanting in addressing real-world demands. Notable progress
in computer vision and deep learning has substantially bolstered defect
detection capabilities across both 2D and 3D modalities. A significant
development has been the pivot from closed-set to open-set defect detection
frameworks, which diminishes the necessity for extensive defect annotations and
facilitates the recognition of novel anomalies. Despite such strides, a
cohesive and contemporary understanding of industrial defect detection remains
elusive. Consequently, this survey delivers an in-depth analysis of both
closed-set and open-set defect detection strategies within 2D and 3D
modalities, charting their evolution in recent years and underscoring the
rising prominence of open-set techniques. We distill critical challenges
inherent in practical detection environments and illuminate emerging trends,
thereby providing a current and comprehensive vista of this swiftly progressing
field.

Abstract: A large variety of geospatial data layers is available around the world
ranging from remotely-sensed raster data like satellite imagery, digital
elevation models, predicted land cover maps, and human-annotated data, to data
derived from environmental sensors such as air temperature or wind speed data.
A large majority of machine learning models trained on satellite imagery
(SatML), however, are designed primarily for optical input modalities such as
multi-spectral satellite imagery. To better understand the value of using other
input modalities alongside optical imagery in supervised learning settings, we
generate augmented versions of SatML benchmark tasks by appending additional
geographic data layers to datasets spanning classification, regression, and
segmentation. Using these augmented datasets, we find that fusing additional
geographic inputs with optical imagery can significantly improve SatML model
performance. Benefits are largest in settings where labeled data are limited
and in geographic out-of-sample settings, suggesting that multi-modal inputs
may be especially valuable for data-efficiency and out-of-sample performance of
SatML models. Surprisingly, we find that hard-coded fusion strategies
outperform learned variants, with interesting implications for future work.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in producing high-quality images, but their reliance on
large-scale unlabeled data has raised significant safety and copyright
concerns. Efforts to address these issues by erasing unwanted concepts have
shown promise. However, many existing erasure methods involve excessive
modifications that compromise the overall utility of the model. In this work,
we address these issues by formulating a novel minimalist concept erasure
objective based \emph{only} on the distributional distance of final generation
outputs. Building on our formulation, we derive a tractable loss for
differentiable optimization that leverages backpropagation through all
generation steps in an end-to-end manner. We also conduct extensive analysis to
show theoretical connections with other models and methods. To improve the
robustness of the erasure, we incorporate neuron masking as an alternative to
model fine-tuning. Empirical evaluations on state-of-the-art flow-matching
models demonstrate that our method robustly erases concepts without degrading
overall model performance, paving the way for safer and more responsible
generative models.

Abstract: Accurate perception of the surrounding environment is essential for safe
autonomous driving. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates detailed 3D
structures of roads, buildings, and other objects, is particularly important
for vision-centric autonomous driving systems that do not rely on LiDAR
sensors. However, in 3D semantic occupancy prediction -- where each voxel is
assigned a semantic label -- annotated LiDAR point clouds are required, making
data acquisition costly. In contrast, large-scale binary occupancy data, which
only indicate occupied or free space without semantic labels, can be collected
at a lower cost. Despite their availability, the potential of leveraging such
data remains unexplored. In this study, we investigate the utilization of
large-scale binary occupancy data from two perspectives: (1) pre-training and
(2) learning-based auto-labeling. We propose a novel binary occupancy-based
framework that decomposes the prediction process into binary and semantic
occupancy modules, enabling effective use of binary occupancy data. Our
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms
existing methods in both pre-training and auto-labeling tasks, highlighting its
effectiveness in enhancing 3D semantic occupancy prediction. The code is

Method: 提出InSyn模型，基于Transformer显式捕捉多样化交互模式，并引入SSOS训练策略以减少初始步预测误差。

Result: 在ETH和UCY数据集上，模型显著优于现有基线，尤其在密集场景中。SSOS策略将初始步预测误差降低了约6.58%。

Conclusion: InSyn模型和SSOS策略有效提升了行人轨迹预测的准确性，特别是在复杂交互场景中。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for intelligent
applications, yet it remains highly challenging due to the complexity of
interactions among pedestrians. Previous methods have primarily relied on
relative positions to model pedestrian interactions; however, they tend to
overlook specific interaction patterns such as paired walking or conflicting
behaviors, limiting the prediction accuracy in crowded scenarios. To address
this issue, we propose InSyn (Interaction-Synchronization Network), a novel
Transformer-based model that explicitly captures diverse interaction patterns
(e.g., walking in sync or conflicting) while effectively modeling
direction-sensitive social behaviors. Additionally, we introduce a training
strategy termed Seq-Start of Seq (SSOS), designed to alleviate the common issue
of initial-step divergence in numerical time-series prediction. Experiments on
the ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms recent
baselines significantly, especially in high-density scenarios. Furthermore, the
SSOS strategy proves effective in improving sequential prediction performance,
reducing the initial-step prediction error by approximately 6.58%.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image
generation, their effectiveness in grounded visual editing and compositional
control remains challenging. Motivated by advances in self-supervised learning
and in-context generative modeling, we propose a series of simple yet powerful
design choices that significantly enhance diffusion model capacity for
structured, controllable generation and editing. We introduce Masking-Augmented
Diffusion with Inference-Time Scaling (MADI), a framework that improves the
editability, compositionality and controllability of diffusion models through
two core innovations. First, we introduce Masking-Augmented gaussian Diffusion
(MAgD), a novel training strategy with dual corruption process which combines
standard denoising score matching and masked reconstruction by masking noisy
input from forward process. MAgD encourages the model to learn discriminative
and compositional visual representations, thus enabling localized and
structure-aware editing. Second, we introduce an inference-time capacity
scaling mechanism based on Pause Tokens, which act as special placeholders
inserted into the prompt for increasing computational capacity at inference
time. Our findings show that adopting expressive and dense prompts during
training further enhances performance, particularly for MAgD. Together, these
contributions in MADI substantially enhance the editability of diffusion
models, paving the way toward their integration into more general-purpose,
in-context generative diffusion architectures.

Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive public dataset for driver
drowsiness detection, integrating multimodal signals of facial, behavioral, and
biometric indicators. Our dataset includes 3D facial video using a depth
camera, IR camera footage, posterior videos, and biometric signals such as
heart rate, electrodermal activity, blood oxygen saturation, skin temperature,
and accelerometer data. This data set provides grip sensor data from the
steering wheel and telemetry data from the American truck simulator game to
provide more information about drivers' behavior while they are alert and
drowsy. Drowsiness levels were self-reported every four minutes using the
Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). The simulation environment consists of three
monitor setups, and the driving condition is completely like a car. Data were
collected from 19 subjects (15 M, 4 F) in two conditions: when they were fully
alert and when they exhibited signs of sleepiness. Unlike other datasets, our
multimodal dataset has a continuous duration of 40 minutes for each data
collection session per subject, contributing to a total length of 1,400
minutes, and we recorded gradual changes in the driver state rather than
discrete alert/drowsy labels. This study aims to create a comprehensive
multimodal dataset of driver drowsiness that captures a wider range of
physiological, behavioral, and driving-related signals. The dataset will be
available upon request to the corresponding author.

TL;DR: AortaDiff是一种基于扩散的框架，直接从CT/MRI体积数据生成平滑的主动脉表面，适用于CFD分析，减少对大量标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大量标注数据和人工干预，难以生成几何一致且适合CFD分析的主动脉表面。

Method: AortaDiff通过体积引导的条件扩散模型生成主动脉中心线，并自动提取血管轮廓，最终拟合为平滑的3D表面。

Result: 实验表明，AortaDiff在有限训练数据下仍能有效生成正常和病理主动脉网格，包括动脉瘤和缩窄病例。

Conclusion: AortaDiff为心血管研究提供了一种端到端的解决方案，能够生成高质量的CFD兼容网格。

Abstract: Accurate 3D aortic construction is crucial for clinical diagnosis,
preoperative planning, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, as
it enables the estimation of critical hemodynamic parameters such as blood flow
velocity, pressure distribution, and wall shear stress. Existing construction
methods often rely on large annotated training datasets and extensive manual
intervention. While the resulting meshes can serve for visualization purposes,
they struggle to produce geometrically consistent, well-constructed surfaces
suitable for downstream CFD analysis. To address these challenges, we introduce
AortaDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates smooth aortic surfaces
directly from CT/MRI volumes. AortaDiff first employs a volume-guided
conditional diffusion model (CDM) to iteratively generate aortic centerlines
conditioned on volumetric medical images. Each centerline point is then
automatically used as a prompt to extract the corresponding vessel contour,
ensuring accurate boundary delineation. Finally, the extracted contours are
fitted into a smooth 3D surface, yielding a continuous, CFD-compatible mesh
representation. AortaDiff offers distinct advantages over existing methods,
including an end-to-end workflow, minimal dependency on large labeled datasets,
and the ability to generate CFD-compatible aorta meshes with high geometric
fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that AortaDiff performs effectively
even with limited training data, successfully constructing both normal and
pathologically altered aorta meshes, including cases with aneurysms or
coarctation. This capability enables the generation of high-quality
visualizations and positions AortaDiff as a practical solution for
cardiovascular research.

TL;DR: COREVQA是一个新的视觉语言模型基准测试，专注于视觉蕴含推理，测试模型在拥挤场景中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试很少评估模型在视觉蕴含任务（如基于图像接受或反驳假设）上的能力。

Method: 提出COREVQA基准，包含5608张图像和合成的真/假陈述对，图像来自CrowdHuman数据集。

Result: 即使表现最好的模型准确率低于80%，其他模型表现更差（39.98%-69.95%）。

Conclusion: 揭示了视觉语言模型在拥挤场景中推理能力的显著局限性。

Abstract: Recently, many benchmarks and datasets have been developed to evaluate
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using visual question answering (VQA) pairs, and
models have shown significant accuracy improvements. However, these benchmarks
rarely test the model's ability to accurately complete visual entailment, for
instance, accepting or refuting a hypothesis based on the image. To address
this, we propose COREVQA (Crowd Observations and Reasoning Entailment), a
benchmark of 5608 image and synthetically generated true/false statement pairs,
with images derived from the CrowdHuman dataset, to provoke visual entailment
reasoning on challenging crowded images. Our results show that even the
top-performing VLMs achieve accuracy below 80%, with other models performing
substantially worse (39.98%-69.95%). This significant performance gap reveals
key limitations in VLMs' ability to reason over certain types of image-question
pairs in crowded scenes.

TL;DR: IConMark是一种新型的语义水印方法，通过嵌入可解释的概念到AI生成图像中，提高水印的鲁棒性和可读性，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI和合成媒体的快速发展，区分AI生成图像与真实图像对防止虚假信息至关重要。传统水印技术易受对抗攻击，需要更鲁棒且可解释的解决方案。

Method: IConMark通过在AI生成图像中嵌入有意义的语义属性，而非传统噪声或扰动，实现可解释且抗对抗攻击的水印。还结合StegaStamp和TrustMark提出混合方法（IConMark+SS和IConMark+TM）。

Result: IConMark及其变体在检测准确性和图像质量上优于基线方法，AUROC分数分别提高10.8%、14.5%和15.9%。

Conclusion: IConMark为可解释水印提供了有效解决方案，鲁棒性强且可手动验证，未来可结合其他技术进一步提升性能。

Abstract: With the rapid rise of generative AI and synthetic media, distinguishing
AI-generated images from real ones has become crucial in safeguarding against
misinformation and ensuring digital authenticity. Traditional watermarking
techniques have shown vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks, undermining their
effectiveness in the presence of attackers. We propose IConMark, a novel
in-generation robust semantic watermarking method that embeds interpretable
concepts into AI-generated images, as a first step toward interpretable
watermarking. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on adding noise or
perturbations to AI-generated images, IConMark incorporates meaningful semantic
attributes, making it interpretable to humans and hence, resilient to
adversarial manipulation. This method is not only robust against various image
augmentations but also human-readable, enabling manual verification of
watermarks. We demonstrate a detailed evaluation of IConMark's effectiveness,
demonstrating its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and maintaining
image quality. Moreover, IConMark can be combined with existing watermarking
techniques to further enhance and complement its robustness. We introduce
IConMark+SS and IConMark+TM, hybrid approaches combining IConMark with
StegaStamp and TrustMark, respectively, to further bolster robustness against
multiple types of image manipulations. Our base watermarking technique
(IConMark) and its variants (+TM and +SS) achieve 10.8%, 14.5%, and 15.9%
higher mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC)
scores for watermark detection, respectively, compared to the best baseline on
various datasets.

TL;DR: AI多模型深度学习系统用于肩部X光片骨折检测，通过集成技术显著提高准确率，达到95.5%，适用于临床快速筛查。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肩部骨折在急诊和高流量临床环境中常被漏诊，AI工具可帮助早期检测，减少诊断延误。

Method: 开发多模型深度学习系统（Faster R-CNN、EfficientDet、RF-DETR），采用边界框和分类级集成技术（Soft-NMS、WBF、NMW融合）。

Result: NMW集成模型准确率达95.5%，F1分数0.9610，优于单一模型，具有高召回率和定位精度。

Conclusion: 集成AI模型能可靠检测肩部骨折，适合临床快速筛查，但仅限于二元骨折检测，未涵盖详细骨科分类。

Abstract: Background: Shoulder fractures are often underdiagnosed, especially in
emergency and high-volume clinical settings. Studies report up to 10% of such
fractures may be missed by radiologists. AI-driven tools offer a scalable way
to assist early detection and reduce diagnostic delays. We address this gap
through a dedicated AI system for shoulder radiographs. Methods: We developed a
multi-model deep learning system using 10,000 annotated shoulder X-rays.
Architectures include Faster R-CNN (ResNet50-FPN, ResNeXt), EfficientDet, and
RF-DETR. To enhance detection, we applied bounding box and classification-level
ensemble techniques such as Soft-NMS, WBF, and NMW fusion. Results: The NMW
ensemble achieved 95.5% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.9610, outperforming
individual models across all key metrics. It demonstrated strong recall and
localization precision, confirming its effectiveness for clinical fracture
detection in shoulder X-rays. Conclusion: The results show ensemble-based AI
can reliably detect shoulder fractures in radiographs with high clinical
relevance. The model's accuracy and deployment readiness position it well for
integration into real-time diagnostic workflows. The current model is limited
to binary fracture detection, reflecting its design for rapid screening and
triage support rather than detailed orthopedic classification.

Motivation: 利用AI技术和历史卫星影像（CORONA）解决因人为破坏而消失的考古遗址识别问题。

Method: 在Bing卷积网络模型基础上，使用CORONA影像对伊拉克阿布格莱布地区进行重新训练。

Result: 检测精度显著提升（IoU超过85%，总体准确率达90%），并发现四个新遗址。

Conclusion: AI结合历史影像为考古遗址识别提供了突破性方法，尤其适用于因人为破坏而消失的遗址。

Abstract: By upgrading an existing deep learning model with the knowledge provided by
one of the oldest sets of grayscale satellite imagery, known as CORONA, we
improved the AI model attitude towards the automatic identification of
archaeological sites in an environment which has been completely transformed in
the last five decades, including the complete destruction of many of those same
sites. The initial Bing based convolutional network model was retrained using
CORONA satellite imagery for the district of Abu Ghraib, west of Baghdad,
central Mesopotamian floodplain. The results were twofold and surprising.
First, the detection precision obtained on the area of interest increased
sensibly: in particular, the Intersection over Union (IoU) values, at the image
segmentation level, surpassed 85 percent, while the general accuracy in
detecting archeological sites reached 90 percent. Second, our retrained model
allowed the identification of four new sites of archaeological interest
(confirmed through field verification), previously not identified by
archaeologists with traditional techniques. This has confirmed the efficacy of
using AI techniques and the CORONA imagery from the 1960 to discover
archaeological sites currently no longer visible, a concrete breakthrough with
significant consequences for the study of landscapes with vanishing
archaeological evidence induced by anthropization

TL;DR: CaSTFormer是一种因果时空变换器，用于建模驾驶员行为与环境之间的因果关系，提升驾驶意图预测的准确性和透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法难以准确建模复杂时空依赖和人类驾驶行为的不可预测性，需要更鲁棒的预测模型。

Method: CaSTFormer通过RSF机制对齐特征流，CPE模块消除虚假相关性，FSN网络合成纯净表征。

Result: 在Brain4Cars数据集上达到最优性能，有效捕捉复杂时空依赖。

Conclusion: CaSTFormer显著提升了驾驶意图预测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of driving intention is key to enhancing the safety and
interactive efficiency of human-machine co-driving systems. It serves as a
cornerstone for achieving high-level autonomous driving. However, current
approaches remain inadequate for accurately modeling the complex
spatio-temporal interdependencies and the unpredictable variability of human
driving behavior. To address these challenges, we propose CaSTFormer, a Causal
Spatio-Temporal Transformer to explicitly model causal interactions between
driver behavior and environmental context for robust intention prediction.
Specifically, CaSTFormer introduces a novel Reciprocal Shift Fusion (RSF)
mechanism for precise temporal alignment of internal and external feature
streams, a Causal Pattern Extraction (CPE) module that systematically
eliminates spurious correlations to reveal authentic causal dependencies, and
an innovative Feature Synthesis Network (FSN) that adaptively synthesizes these
purified representations into coherent spatio-temporal inferences. We evaluate
the proposed CaSTFormer on the public Brain4Cars dataset, and it achieves
state-of-the-art performance. It effectively captures complex causal
spatio-temporal dependencies and enhances both the accuracy and transparency of
driving intention prediction.

Conclusion: PhyWorldBench为视频生成模型的物理模拟能力提供了系统评估方法，并指出了改进方向。

Abstract: Video generation models have achieved remarkable progress in creating
high-quality, photorealistic content. However, their ability to accurately
simulate physical phenomena remains a critical and unresolved challenge. This
paper presents PhyWorldBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
video generation models based on their adherence to the laws of physics. The
benchmark covers multiple levels of physical phenomena, ranging from
fundamental principles like object motion and energy conservation to more
complex scenarios involving rigid body interactions and human or animal motion.
Additionally, we introduce a novel ""Anti-Physics"" category, where prompts
intentionally violate real-world physics, enabling the assessment of whether
models can follow such instructions while maintaining logical consistency.
Besides large-scale human evaluation, we also design a simple yet effective
method that could utilize current MLLM to evaluate the physics realism in a
zero-shot fashion. We evaluate 12 state-of-the-art text-to-video generation
models, including five open-source and five proprietary models, with a detailed
comparison and analysis. we identify pivotal challenges models face in adhering
to real-world physics. Through systematic testing of their outputs across 1,050
curated prompts-spanning fundamental, composite, and anti-physics scenarios-we
identify pivotal challenges these models face in adhering to real-world
physics. We then rigorously examine their performance on diverse physical
phenomena with varying prompt types, deriving targeted recommendations for
crafting prompts that enhance fidelity to physical principles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摄影测量点云的精度高度依赖场景，而MVS阶段的不确定性估计尚未标准化，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种自校准方法，利用MVS阶段的可靠多视点回归视差不确定性，结合相关线索（如匹配成本值）。

Result: 在多种公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，实现了高边界率且未高估不确定性。

Conclusion: 该框架为摄影测量过程提供了稳健且可验证的不确定性量化，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification of the photogrammetry process is essential for
providing per-point accuracy credentials of the point clouds. Unlike airborne
LiDAR, which typically delivers consistent accuracy across various scenes, the
accuracy of photogrammetric point clouds is highly scene-dependent, since it
relies on algorithm-generated measurements (i.e., stereo or multi-view stereo).
Generally, errors of the photogrammetric point clouds propagate through a
two-step process: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) with Bundle adjustment (BA),
followed by Multi-view Stereo (MVS). While uncertainty estimation in the SfM
stage has been well studied using the first-order statistics of the
reprojection error function, that in the MVS stage remains largely unsolved and
non-standardized, primarily due to its non-differentiable and multi-modal
nature (i.e., from pixel values to geometry). In this paper, we present an
uncertainty quantification framework closing this gap by associating an error
covariance matrix per point accounting for this two-step photogrammetry
process. Specifically, to estimate the uncertainty in the MVS stage, we propose
a novel, self-calibrating method by taking reliable n-view points (n>=6)
per-view to regress the disparity uncertainty using highly relevant cues (such
as matching cost values) from the MVS stage. Compared to existing approaches,
our method uses self-contained, reliable 3D points extracted directly from the
MVS process, with the benefit of being self-supervised and naturally adhering
to error propagation path of the photogrammetry process, thereby providing a
robust and certifiable uncertainty quantification across diverse scenes. We
evaluate the framework using a variety of publicly available airborne and UAV
imagery datasets. Results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing
approaches by achieving high bounding rates without overestimating uncertainty.

Abstract: Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) data has proven effective for agricultural

features from Sentinel-2 image sequences, combined with
acquisition-date-specific temporal encodings to better capture the growth
dynamics of sugar-beets. The learned representations are used in a downstream
clustering task to separate stressed from healthy fields. The resulting stress
detection system can be directly applied to data from different years, offering
a practical and accessible tool for stress detection in sugar-beets.

Motivation: 二维材料在纳米电子学中的应用增加，需要高效的电气表征技术。传统C-AFM方法速度慢，限制了大规模生产的效率。

Method: 提出SparseC-AFM模型，利用稀疏扫描数据快速重建高分辨率导电性图，适用于不同扫描模式、基底和实验条件。

Conclusion: SparseC-AFM为AI辅助二维材料表征从实验室研究到工业应用的转化提供了重要进展。

Abstract: The increasing use of two-dimensional (2D) materials in nanoelectronics
demands robust metrology techniques for electrical characterization, especially
for large-scale production. While atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques like
conductive AFM (C-AFM) offer high accuracy, they suffer from slow data
acquisition speeds due to the raster scanning process. To address this, we
introduce SparseC-AFM, a deep learning model that rapidly and accurately
reconstructs conductivity maps of 2D materials like MoS$_2$ from sparse C-AFM
scans. Our approach is robust across various scanning modes, substrates, and
experimental conditions. We report a comparison between (a) classic flow
implementation, where a high pixel density C-AFM image (e.g., 15 minutes to
collect) is manually parsed to extract relevant material parameters, and (b)
our SparseC-AFM method, which achieves the same operation using data that
requires substantially less acquisition time (e.g., under 5 minutes).
SparseC-AFM enables efficient extraction of critical material parameters in
MoS$_2$, including film coverage, defect density, and identification of
crystalline island boundaries, edges, and cracks. We achieve over 11x reduction
in acquisition time compared to manual extraction from a full-resolution C-AFM
image. Moreover, we demonstrate that our model-predicted samples exhibit
remarkably similar electrical properties to full-resolution data gathered using
classic-flow scanning. This work represents a significant step toward
translating AI-assisted 2D material characterization from laboratory research
to industrial fabrication. Code and model weights are available at

setting, a tailor-made tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space is
constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods

Result: 实验表明，NABLA在几乎不影响生成质量的情况下，训练和推理速度提升2.7倍。

Abstract: Recent progress in transformer-based architectures has demonstrated
remarkable success in video generation tasks. However, the quadratic complexity
of full attention mechanisms remains a critical bottleneck, particularly for
high-resolution and long-duration video sequences. In this paper, we propose
NABLA, a novel Neighborhood Adaptive Block-Level Attention mechanism that

By leveraging block-wise attention with adaptive sparsity-driven threshold,
NABLA reduces computational overhead while preserving generative quality. Our

integrated with PyTorch's Flex Attention operator. Experiments demonstrate that
NABLA achieves up to 2.7x faster training and inference compared to baseline
almost without compromising quantitative metrics (CLIP score, VBench score,

Result: 在MTIL基准测试中表现优异，平衡了可塑性、稳定性和零样本能力。

Conclusion: LoRA适配生成器能有效提升视觉语言模型的持续学习鲁棒性。

Abstract: Continual learning for vision-language models has achieved remarkable
performance through synthetic replay, where samples are generated using Stable
Diffusion to regularize during finetuning and retain knowledge. However,
real-world downstream applications often exhibit domain-specific nuances and
fine-grained semantics not captured by generators, causing synthetic-replay
methods to produce misaligned samples that misguide finetuning and undermine
retention of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a LoRA-enhanced
synthetic-replay framework that injects task-specific low-rank adapters into a
frozen Stable Diffusion model, efficiently capturing each new task's unique
visual and semantic patterns. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage,
confidence-based sample selection: we first rank real task data by
post-finetuning VLM confidence to focus LoRA finetuning on the most
representative examples, then generate synthetic samples and again select them
by confidence for distillation. Our approach integrates seamlessly with
existing replay pipelines-simply swap in the adapted generator to boost replay
fidelity. Extensive experiments on the Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning
(MTIL) benchmark show that our method outperforms previous synthetic-replay
techniques, achieving an optimal balance among plasticity, stability, and
zero-shot capability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of generator
adaptation via LoRA for robust continual learning in VLMs.

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate implicit surface representations from point clouds

Noise2Noise paradigm for 2D images, we introduce NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF, a novel
method designed to extend this concept to 3D neural fields. Our approach
enables learning clean neural SDFs directly from noisy point clouds through
noisy supervision by minimizing the MSE loss between noisy SDF representations,
allowing the network to implicitly denoise and refine surface estimations. We
evaluate the effectiveness of NoiseSDF2NoiseSDF on benchmarks, including the
ShapeNet, ABC, Famous, and Real datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our framework significantly improves surface reconstruction quality from noisy
inputs.

*Chengxu Liu,Lu Qi,Jinshan Pan,Xueming Qian,Ming-Hsuan Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的框架（\ours），用于从未配对数据中学习图像去模糊，通过生成纹理先验知识来恢复模糊图像的细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于获取大量真实的模糊-清晰图像对既困难又昂贵，从未配对数据中学习盲图像去模糊更具实际意义。现有方法依赖对抗学习，忽略了真实世界模糊模式的复杂性。

Method: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的框架，包括纹理先验编码器（TPE）和纹理转移变换层（TTformer），利用记忆机制和自适应滤波去除空间变化的模糊。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在广泛使用的基准测试中优于现有技术，提供了一种有前景的无监督去模糊解决方案。

Conclusion: \ours框架通过生成纹理先验和自适应滤波，有效解决了从未配对数据中学习去模糊的挑战，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Since acquiring large amounts of realistic blurry-sharp image pairs is
difficult and expensive, learning blind image deblurring from unpaired data is
a more practical and promising solution. Unfortunately, dominant approaches
rely heavily on adversarial learning to bridge the gap from blurry domains to
sharp domains, ignoring the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world blur
patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion model (DM)-based
framework, dubbed \ours, for image deblurring by learning spatially varying
texture prior from unpaired data. In particular, \ours performs DM to generate
the prior knowledge that aids in recovering the textures of blurry images. To
implement this, we propose a Texture Prior Encoder (TPE) that introduces a
memory mechanism to represent the image textures and provides supervision for
DM training. To fully exploit the generated texture priors, we present the
Texture Transfer Transformer layer (TTformer), in which a novel
Filter-Modulated Multi-head Self-Attention (FM-MSA) efficiently removes
spatially varying blurring through adaptive filtering. Furthermore, we
implement a wavelet-based adversarial loss to preserve high-frequency texture
details. Extensive evaluations show that \ours provides a promising
unsupervised deblurring solution and outperforms SOTA methods in widely-used
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于扩散模型的随机采样方法，用于从低分辨率（LR）图像序列中生成高质量的超分辨率（SR）图像，显著减少了运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性方法生成的SR图像模糊且感知质量差，因此需要一种能够生成清晰且高保真SR图像的方法。

Method: 采用扩散模型结合随机采样器和高阶ODE，并通过知识蒸馏实现一步扩散，以提高效率。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将运行时间减少至基线的1.6%，同时保持了基于图像失真和感知质量的SR质量。

Conclusion: 该方法在保证SR质量的同时显著提升了效率，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: While burst Low-Resolution (LR) images are useful for improving their Super
Resolution (SR) image compared to a single LR image, prior burst SR methods are
trained in a deterministic manner, which produces a blurry SR image. Since such
blurry images are perceptually degraded, we aim to reconstruct sharp and
high-fidelity SR images by a diffusion model. Our method improves the
efficiency of the diffusion model with a stochastic sampler with a high-order
ODE as well as one-step diffusion using knowledge distillation. Our
experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the runtime to 1.6
% of its baseline while maintaining the SR quality measured based on image
distortion and perceptual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型缺乏细粒度对象级理解的链式思维推理能力，需要结构化标注支持逐步推理。

Method: 将复杂视频问题分解为帧定位、实体跟踪、时空关系提取四个基础任务，嵌入中间推理步骤。

Result: 在NeXT-QA基准测试中，LLaVA-video-7B和Qwen2.5-VL-3B分别提升3.3和17.4分，子类别表现显著提升。

Conclusion: CoTasks作为结构化监督框架，有效提升了视频组合推理能力。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in video large language models (VideoLLMs), a key
open challenge remains: how to equip models with chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning abilities grounded in fine-grained object-level video understanding.
Existing instruction-tuned models, such as the Qwen and LLaVA series, are
trained on high-level video-text pairs, often lacking structured annotations
necessary for compositional, step-by-step reasoning. We propose CoTasks:
Chain-of-Thought based Video Instruction Tuning Tasks, a new framework that
decomposes complex video questions of existing datasets (e.g., NeXT-QA, STAR)
into four entity-level foundational tasks: frame localization, entity tracking,
spatial and temporal relation extraction. By embedding these intermediate
CoT-style reasoning steps into the input, CoTasks enables models to explicitly
perform object-centric spatiotemporal reasoning. Experiments on the NeXT-QA
benchmark show that CoTasks significantly enhance inference performance:
LLaVA-video-7B improves by +3.3 points in average GPT-4 evaluation score, and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B gains +17.4, with large boosts in causal (+14.6), temporal
(+10.9), and descriptive (+48.1) subcategories. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoTasks as a structured CoT-style supervision framework for
improving compositional video reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖光流，难以在复杂结构化场景中检测动态物体，需改进。

Result: 在DAVIS 2016数据集和真实交通视频中表现优异，达到先进水平。

Conclusion: FoELS有效解决了复杂场景、旋转相机和平行运动等挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Separating moving and static objects from a moving camera viewpoint is
essential for 3D reconstruction, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding
in robotics. Existing approaches often rely primarily on optical flow, which
struggles to detect moving objects in complex, structured scenes involving
camera motion. To address this limitation, we propose Focus of Expansion
Likelihood and Segmentation (FoELS), a method based on the core idea of
integrating both optical flow and texture information. FoELS computes the focus
of expansion (FoE) from optical flow and derives an initial motion likelihood
from the outliers of the FoE computation. This likelihood is then fused with a
segmentation-based prior to estimate the final moving probability. The method
effectively handles challenges including complex structured scenes, rotational
camera motion, and parallel motion. Comprehensive evaluations on the DAVIS 2016
dataset and real-world traffic videos demonstrate its effectiveness and
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: EPSilon提出了一种高效的混合3D虚拟人生成方法，通过空射线省略（ERO）和空区间省略（EIO）策略显著减少计算成本，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于NeRF和SMPL的混合模型因变形方案计算成本高而推理速度慢，EPSilon旨在通过优化采样策略解决这一问题。

Method: EPSilon采用ERO和EIO策略，分别省略空射线和空区间，减少无效采样点，从而提升训练和推理效率。

Result: EPSilon仅使用3.9%的采样点，推理速度提升约20倍，训练收敛速度提升4倍，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: EPSilon通过高效采样策略显著提升了混合3D虚拟人生成模型的性能，为实时应用提供了可能。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of neural radiance fields (NeRF) has paved the way to
generate animatable human avatars from a monocular video. However, the sole
usage of NeRF suffers from a lack of details, which results in the emergence of
hybrid representation that utilizes SMPL-based mesh together with NeRF
representation. While hybrid-based models show photo-realistic human avatar
generation qualities, they suffer from extremely slow inference due to their
deformation scheme: to be aligned with the mesh, hybrid-based models use the
deformation based on SMPL skinning weights, which needs high computational
costs on each sampled point. We observe that since most of the sampled points
are located in empty space, they do not affect the generation quality but
result in inference latency with deformation. In light of this observation, we
propose EPSilon, a hybrid-based 3D avatar generation scheme with novel
efficient point sampling strategies that boost both training and inference. In
EPSilon, we propose two methods to omit empty points at rendering; empty ray
omission (ERO) and empty interval omission (EIO). In ERO, we wipe out rays that
progress through the empty space. Then, EIO narrows down the sampling interval
on the ray, which wipes out the region not occupied by either clothes or mesh.
The delicate sampling scheme of EPSilon enables not only great computational
cost reduction during deformation but also the designation of the important
regions to be sampled, which enables a single-stage NeRF structure without
hierarchical sampling. Compared to existing methods, EPSilon maintains the
generation quality while using only 3.9% of sampled points and achieves around
20 times faster inference, together with 4 times faster training convergence.

Conclusion: EvReID数据集和TriPro-ReID框架为未来研究提供了数据和基准支持，推动了事件相机行人重识别的发展。

Abstract: Recent researchers have proposed using event cameras for person
re-identification (ReID) due to their promising performance and better balance
in terms of privacy protection, event camera-based person ReID has attracted
significant attention. Currently, mainstream event-based person ReID algorithms
primarily focus on fusing visible light and event stream, as well as preserving
privacy. Although significant progress has been made, these methods are
typically trained and evaluated on small-scale or simulated event camera
datasets, making it difficult to assess their real identification performance
and generalization ability. To address the issue of data scarcity, this paper
introduces a large-scale RGB-event based person ReID dataset, called EvReID.
The dataset contains 118,988 image pairs and covers 1200 pedestrian identities,
with data collected across multiple seasons, scenes, and lighting conditions.
We also evaluate 15 state-of-the-art person ReID algorithms, laying a solid
foundation for future research in terms of both data and benchmarking. Based on
our newly constructed dataset, this paper further proposes a pedestrian
attribute-guided contrastive learning framework to enhance feature learning for
person re-identification, termed TriPro-ReID. This framework not only
effectively explores the visual features from both RGB frames and event
streams, but also fully utilizes pedestrian attributes as mid-level semantic
features. Extensive experiments on the EvReID dataset and MARS datasets fully
validated the effectiveness of our proposed RGB-Event person ReID framework.

Conclusion: PW-FNet通过结合小波和傅里叶变换，为图像修复提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Natural image quality is often degraded by adverse weather conditions,
significantly impairing the performance of downstream tasks. Image restoration
has emerged as a core solution to this challenge and has been widely discussed
in the literature. Although recent transformer-based approaches have made
remarkable progress in image restoration, their increasing system complexity
poses significant challenges for real-time processing, particularly in
real-world deployment scenarios. To this end, most existing methods attempt to
simplify the self-attention mechanism, such as by channel self-attention or
state space model. However, these methods primarily focus on network
architecture while neglecting the inherent characteristics of image restoration
itself. In this context, we explore a pyramid Wavelet-Fourier iterative
pipeline to demonstrate the potential of Wavelet-Fourier processing for image
restoration. Inspired by the above findings, we propose a novel and efficient
restoration baseline, named Pyramid Wavelet-Fourier Network (PW-FNet).
Specifically, PW-FNet features two key design principles: 1) at the inter-block
level, integrates a pyramid wavelet-based multi-input multi-output structure to
achieve multi-scale and multi-frequency bands decomposition; and 2) at the
intra-block level, incorporates Fourier transforms as an efficient alternative
to self-attention mechanisms, effectively reducing computational complexity
while preserving global modeling capability. Extensive experiments on tasks
such as image deraining, raindrop removal, image super-resolution, motion
deblurring, image dehazing, image desnowing and underwater/low-light
enhancement demonstrate that PW-FNet not only surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in restoration quality but also achieves superior efficiency, with
significantly reduced parameter size, computational cost and inference time.

Motivation: 解决RGB图像中几何模糊和交互过程中严重遮挡导致的3D手-物体交互姿态估计困难问题。

Method: 采用MAE的掩码-重建策略，结合区域特异性掩码分配和骨架驱动的手部掩码引导，并引入掩码SDF驱动的多模态学习机制。

Result: 实验表明，MaskHOI显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MaskHOI通过几何感知和遮挡鲁棒性表示学习，有效提升了3D手-物体交互姿态估计的精度。

Abstract: In 3D hand-object interaction (HOI) tasks, estimating precise joint poses of
hands and objects from monocular RGB input remains highly challenging due to
the inherent geometric ambiguity of RGB images and the severe mutual occlusions
that occur during interaction.To address these challenges, we propose MaskHOI,
a novel Masked Autoencoder (MAE)-driven pretraining framework for enhanced HOI
pose estimation. Our core idea is to leverage the masking-then-reconstruction
strategy of MAE to encourage the feature encoder to infer missing spatial and
structural information, thereby facilitating geometric-aware and
occlusion-robust representation learning. Specifically, based on our
observation that human hands exhibit far greater geometric complexity than
rigid objects, conventional uniform masking fails to effectively guide the
reconstruction of fine-grained hand structures. To overcome this limitation, we
introduce a Region-specific Mask Ratio Allocation, primarily comprising the
region-specific masking assignment and the skeleton-driven hand masking
guidance. The former adaptively assigns lower masking ratios to hand regions
than to rigid objects, balancing their feature learning difficulty, while the
latter prioritizes masking critical hand parts (e.g., fingertips or entire
fingers) to realistically simulate occlusion patterns in real-world
interactions. Furthermore, to enhance the geometric awareness of the pretrained
encoder, we introduce a novel Masked Signed Distance Field (SDF)-driven
multimodal learning mechanism. Through the self-masking 3D SDF prediction, the
learned encoder is able to perceive the global geometric structure of hands and
objects beyond the 2D image plane, overcoming the inherent limitations of
monocular input and alleviating self-occlusion issues. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

Motivation: 现实中的V2X协同感知系统常因成本限制和部署差异导致传感器配置异构，这给特征融合和感知可靠性带来挑战。

Method: 提出HeCoFuse框架，采用分层融合机制（通道和空间注意力加权）和自适应空间分辨率调整模块，并结合动态融合类型调整策略。

Result: 在TUMTraf-V2X数据集上，HeCoFuse在多种传感器配置下表现优异，3D mAP最高达43.38%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HeCoFuse在异构传感器配置下表现出色，成为当前TUM-Traf V2X数据集上的最先进方法。

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception systems often
operate under heterogeneous sensor configurations due to cost constraints and
deployment variability across vehicles and infrastructure. This heterogeneity
poses significant challenges for feature fusion and perception reliability. To
address these issues, we propose HeCoFuse, a unified framework designed for
cooperative perception across mixed sensor setups where nodes may carry Cameras
(C), LiDARs (L), or both. By introducing a hierarchical fusion mechanism that
adaptively weights features through a combination of channel-wise and spatial
attention, HeCoFuse can tackle critical challenges such as cross-modality
feature misalignment and imbalanced representation quality. In addition, an
adaptive spatial resolution adjustment module is employed to balance
computational cost and fusion effectiveness. To enhance robustness across
different configurations, we further implement a cooperative learning strategy
that dynamically adjusts fusion type based on available modalities. Experiments
on the real-world TUMTraf-V2X dataset demonstrate that HeCoFuse achieves 43.22%
3D mAP under the full sensor configuration (LC+LC), outperforming the CoopDet3D
baseline by 1.17%, and reaches an even higher 43.38% 3D mAP in the L+LC
scenario, while maintaining 3D mAP in the range of 21.74% to 43.38% across nine
heterogeneous sensor configurations. These results, validated by our
first-place finish in the CVPR 2025 DriveX challenge, establish HeCoFuse as the
current state-of-the-art on TUM-Traf V2X dataset while demonstrating robust
performance across diverse sensor deployments.

Result: 数值和实验验证表明，该方法无需针对不同样本定制参数即可实现高精度测量。

Conclusion: 该方法为结构健康监测提供了一种高精度、低成本的视觉运动测量解决方案。

Abstract: The growing demand for structural health monitoring has driven increasing
interest in high-precision motion measurement, as structural information
derived from extracted motions can effectively reflect the current condition of
the structure. Among various motion measurement techniques, vision-based
methods stand out due to their low cost, easy installation, and large-scale
measurement. However, when it comes to sub-pixel-level motion measurement,
current vision-based methods either lack sufficient accuracy or require
extensive manual parameter tuning (e.g., pyramid layers, target pixels, and
filter parameters) to reach good precision. To address this issue, we developed
a novel Gaussian kernel-based motion measurement method, which can extract the
motion between different frames via tracking the location of Gaussian kernels.
The motion consistency, which fits practical structural conditions, and a
super-resolution constraint, are introduced to increase accuracy and robustness
of our method. Numerical and experimental validations show that it can
consistently reach high accuracy without customized parameter setup for
different test samples.

Result: 通过仿真实验验证了T-GOSPA准度量在评估贝叶斯MOT算法中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的准度量在MOT评估中更具灵活性，适用于特定应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces two quasi-metrics for performance assessment of
multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. In particular, one quasi-metric is an
extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and
measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an
extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy
between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these
quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected
objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The
T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the
GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of
penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation
costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT
evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT
algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.

Conclusion: PoemTale Diffusion为诗歌到图像生成提供了新视角，并推动了相关研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved
remarkable success in generating realistic and diverse visual content. A
critical factor in this process is the model's ability to accurately interpret
textual prompts. However, these models often struggle with creative
expressions, particularly those involving complex, abstract, or highly
descriptive language. In this work, we introduce a novel training-free approach
tailored to improve image generation for a unique form of creative language:
poetic verse, which frequently features layered, abstract, and dual meanings.
Our proposed PoemTale Diffusion approach aims to minimise the information that
is lost during poetic text-to-image conversion by integrating a multi stage
prompt refinement loop into Language Models to enhance the interpretability of
poetic texts. To support this, we adapt existing state-of-the-art diffusion
models by modifying their self-attention mechanisms with a consistent
self-attention technique to generate multiple consistent images, which are then
collectively used to convey the poem's meaning. Moreover, to encourage research
in the field of poetry, we introduce the P4I (PoemForImage) dataset, consisting
of 1111 poems sourced from multiple online and offline resources. We engaged a
panel of poetry experts for qualitative assessments. The results from both
human and quantitative evaluations validate the efficacy of our method and
contribute a novel perspective to poem-to-image generation with enhanced
information capture in the generated images.

Conclusion: StyleGAN技术具有高效性，但也存在被滥用于伪造身份的风险。

Abstract: In today's digital age, concerns about the dangers of AI-generated images are
increasingly common. One powerful tool in this domain is StyleGAN (style-based
generative adversarial networks), a generative adversarial network capable of
producing highly realistic synthetic faces. To gain a deeper understanding of
how such a model operates, this work focuses on analyzing the inner workings of
StyleGAN's generator component. Key architectural elements and techniques, such
as the Equalized Learning Rate, are explored in detail to shed light on the
model's behavior. A StyleGAN model is trained using the PyTorch framework,
enabling direct inspection of its learned weights. Through pruning, it is
revealed that a significant number of these weights can be removed without
drastically affecting the output, leading to reduced computational
requirements. Moreover, the role of the latent vector -- which heavily
influences the appearance of the generated faces -- is closely examined. Global
alterations to this vector primarily affect aspects like color tones, while
targeted changes to individual dimensions allow for precise manipulation of
specific facial features. This ability to finetune visual traits is not only of
academic interest but also highlights a serious ethical concern: the potential
misuse of such technology. Malicious actors could exploit this capability to
fabricate convincing fake identities, posing significant risks in the context
of digital deception and cybercrime.

TL;DR: Diffusion-FSCIL利用冻结的文本到图像扩散模型作为骨干，通过多尺度表示和生成能力解决少样本类增量学习的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本类增量学习（FSCIL）面临数据有限和灾难性遗忘的挑战，需结合生成模型的优势。

Method: 采用冻结的扩散模型提取多尺度特征，结合潜在重放和特征蒸馏，减少生成偏差。

Result: 在CUB-200、miniImageNet和CIFAR-100上表现优于现有方法，有效保留旧类性能并适应新类。

Conclusion: Diffusion-FSCIL通过生成模型的多尺度表示和灵活性，为FSCIL提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) is challenging due to extremely
limited training data; while aiming to reduce catastrophic forgetting and learn
new information. We propose Diffusion-FSCIL, a novel approach that employs a
text-to-image diffusion model as a frozen backbone. Our conjecture is that
FSCIL can be tackled using a large generative model's capabilities benefiting
from 1) generation ability via large-scale pre-training; 2) multi-scale
representation; 3) representational flexibility through the text encoder. To
maximize the representation capability, we propose to extract multiple
complementary diffusion features to play roles as latent replay with slight
support from feature distillation for preventing generative biases. Our
framework realizes efficiency through 1) using a frozen backbone; 2) minimal
trainable components; 3) batch processing of multiple feature extractions.
Extensive experiments on CUB-200, \emph{mini}ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 show that
Diffusion-FSCIL surpasses state-of-the-art methods, preserving performance on
previously learned classes and adapting effectively to new ones.

TL;DR: EVS是一种无需训练的封装视频合成器，结合T2I和T2V模型，提升生成视频的视觉质量和运动流畅性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V模型在生成高质量视频时存在帧间不一致（如闪烁和伪影）的问题，EVS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用预训练的T2I扩散模型优化低质量视频帧，同时结合T2V模型确保运动一致性。

Result: 实验表明，EVS显著提升了视频的视觉和运动质量，推理速度提高了1.6-4.5倍。

Conclusion: EVS通过结合T2I和T2V模型的优势，实现了高质量、流畅的视频生成。

Abstract: In recent years, large text-to-video (T2V) synthesis models have garnered
considerable attention for their abilities to generate videos from textual
descriptions. However, achieving both high imaging quality and effective motion
representation remains a significant challenge for these T2V models. Existing
approaches often adapt pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models to refine video
frames, leading to issues such as flickering and artifacts due to
inconsistencies across frames. In this paper, we introduce EVS, a training-free
Encapsulated Video Synthesizer that composes T2I and T2V models to enhance both
visual fidelity and motion smoothness of generated videos. Our approach
utilizes a well-trained diffusion-based T2I model to refine low-quality video
frames by treating them as out-of-distribution samples, effectively optimizing
them with noising and denoising steps. Meanwhile, we employ T2V backbones to
ensure consistent motion dynamics. By encapsulating the T2V temporal-only prior
into the T2I generation process, EVS successfully leverages the strengths of
both types of models, resulting in videos of improved imaging and motion
quality. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach
compared to previous approaches. Our composition process also leads to a
significant improvement of 1.6x-4.5x speedup in inference time. Source codes:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在HSI重建中难以准确捕捉高频细节，需改进。

Method: 通过扩散模型隐式学习SDP，并设计SPIM动态指导模型恢复HSI细节。

Result: 在MST和BISRNet上实验，性能提升约0.5 dB。

Conclusion: SDP和SPIM有效提升了HSI重建的细节恢复能力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) reconstruction aims to recover 3D HSI from its
degraded 2D measurements. Recently great progress has been made in deep
learning-based methods, however, these methods often struggle to accurately
capture high-frequency details of the HSI. To address this issue, this paper
proposes a Spectral Diffusion Prior (SDP) that is implicitly learned from
hyperspectral images using a diffusion model. Leveraging the powerful ability
of the diffusion model to reconstruct details, this learned prior can
significantly improve the performance when injected into the HSI model. To
further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, we also propose the
Spectral Prior Injector Module (SPIM) to dynamically guide the model to recover
the HSI details. We evaluate our method on two representative HSI methods: MST
and BISRNet. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing
networks by about 0.5 dB, effectively improving the performance of HSI
reconstruction.

TL;DR: 论文提出了ClearVQA基准，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）通过交互解决视觉问答（VQA）中模糊问题的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要通过重述问题解决VQA中的模糊性，但忽略了用户与VLMs的交互性。缺乏评估交互解决模糊性的基准，且VLMs倾向于回答而非提问。

Method: 引入ClearVQA基准，针对VQA中三类常见模糊性，并涵盖多种VQA场景。

Result: ClearVQA为评估VLMs通过交互解决模糊性的能力提供了标准化工具。

Conclusion: ClearVQA填补了交互式模糊解决评估的空白，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In visual question answering (VQA) context, users often pose ambiguous
questions to visual language models (VLMs) due to varying expression habits.
Existing research addresses such ambiguities primarily by rephrasing questions.
These approaches neglect the inherently interactive nature of user interactions
with VLMs, where ambiguities can be clarified through user feedback. However,
research on interactive clarification faces two major challenges: (1)
Benchmarks are absent to assess VLMs' capacity for resolving ambiguities
through interaction; (2) VLMs are trained to prefer answering rather than
asking, preventing them from seeking clarification. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce \textbf{ClearVQA} benchmark, which targets three
common categories of ambiguity in VQA context, and encompasses various VQA
scenarios.

Motivation: 在图像分类中，特征工程在可解释性和计算效率方面仍具优势，尤其是在避免使用参数庞大的深度学习模型时。

Method: 扩展PE至二维图像，提出多尺度、多方向的熵特征提取方法，并结合HOG和LBP特征，形成780维特征集，通过SVM分类器进行优化和分类。

Conclusion: 基于熵的特征与经典描述符结合，为图像分类提供了轻量级、可解释且高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Feature engineering continues to play a critical role in image
classification, particularly when interpretability and computational efficiency
are prioritized over deep learning models with millions of parameters. In this
study, we revisit classical machine learning based image classification through
a novel approach centered on Permutation Entropy (PE), a robust and
computationally lightweight measure traditionally used in time series analysis
but rarely applied to image data. We extend PE to two-dimensional images and
propose a multiscale, multi-orientation entropy-based feature extraction
approach that characterizes spatial order and complexity along rows, columns,
diagonals, anti-diagonals, and local patches of the image. To enhance the
discriminatory power of the entropy features, we integrate two classic image
descriptors: the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to capture shape and
edge structure, and Local Binary Patterns (LBP) to encode micro-texture of an
image. The resulting hand-crafted feature set, comprising of 780 dimensions, is
used to train Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers optimized through grid
search. The proposed approach is evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets,
including Fashion-MNIST, KMNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10, where it delivers
competitive classification performance without relying on deep architectures.
Our results demonstrate that the fusion of PE with HOG and LBP provides a
compact, interpretable, and effective alternative to computationally expensive
and limited interpretable deep learning models. This shows a potential of
entropy-based descriptors in image classification and contributes a lightweight
and generalizable solution to interpretable machine learning in image
classification and computer vision.

Conclusion: 显式引入可微分聚类模块是一种有效的策略，能够显著提升半监督学习和无监督域适应的性能，尤其是在低监督条件下。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)
enhance the model performance by exploiting information from labeled and
unlabeled data. The clustering assumption has proven advantageous for learning
with limited supervision and states that data points belonging to the same
cluster in a high-dimensional space should be assigned to the same category.
Recent works have utilized different training mechanisms to implicitly enforce
this assumption for the SSL and UDA. In this work, we take a different approach
by explicitly involving a differentiable clustering module which is extended to
leverage the supervised data to compute its centroids. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our straightforward end-to-end training strategy for SSL and
UDA over extensive experiments and highlight its benefits, especially in low
supervision regimes, both as a standalone model and as a regularizer for
existing approaches.

Result: LoFNO在速度和WSS预测上优于插值和其他深度学习方法，提升了脑血管诊断的精确性。

Conclusion: LoFNO通过几何先验和神经算子的结合，为临床影像数据提供了更精确的血流动力学分析工具。

Abstract: Hemodynamic analysis is essential for predicting aneurysm rupture and guiding
treatment. While magnetic resonance flow imaging enables time-resolved
volumetric blood velocity measurements, its low spatiotemporal resolution and
signal-to-noise ratio limit its diagnostic utility. To address this, we propose
the Localized Fourier Neural Operator (LoFNO), a novel 3D architecture that
enhances both spatial and temporal resolution with the ability to predict wall
shear stress (WSS) directly from clinical imaging data. LoFNO integrates
Laplacian eigenvectors as geometric priors for improved structural awareness on
irregular, unseen geometries and employs an Enhanced Deep Super-Resolution
Network (EDSR) layer for robust upsampling. By combining geometric priors with
neural operator frameworks, LoFNO de-noises and spatiotemporally upsamples flow
data, achieving superior velocity and WSS predictions compared to interpolation
and alternative deep learning methods, enabling more precise cerebrovascular
diagnostics.

Result: 在定量和定性评估中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DynFaceRestore在盲脸修复中表现出鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration aims to recover high-fidelity, detail-rich facial
images from unknown degraded inputs, presenting significant challenges in
preserving both identity and detail. Pre-trained diffusion models have been
increasingly used as image priors to generate fine details. Still, existing
methods often use fixed diffusion sampling timesteps and a global guidance
scale, assuming uniform degradation. This limitation and potentially imperfect
degradation kernel estimation frequently lead to under- or over-diffusion,
resulting in an imbalance between fidelity and quality. We propose
DynFaceRestore, a novel blind face restoration approach that learns to map any
blindly degraded input to Gaussian blurry images. By leveraging these blurry
images and their respective Gaussian kernels, we dynamically select the
starting timesteps for each blurry image and apply closed-form guidance during
the diffusion sampling process to maintain fidelity. Additionally, we introduce
a dynamic guidance scaling adjuster that modulates the guidance strength across
local regions, enhancing detail generation in complex areas while preserving
structural fidelity in contours. This strategy effectively balances the
trade-off between fidelity and quality. DynFaceRestore achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations,
demonstrating robustness and effectiveness in blind face restoration.

Result: 生成了358k高质量三元组数据集（NHR-Edit），并在实验中超越了所有公开数据集。

Conclusion: 自动化方法显著提升了训练数据的规模和质量，推动了图像编辑助手的研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling enable image editing assistants that
follow natural language instructions without additional user input. Their
supervised training requires millions of triplets: original image, instruction,
edited image. Yet mining pixel-accurate examples is hard. Each edit must affect
only prompt-specified regions, preserve stylistic coherence, respect physical
plausibility, and retain visual appeal. The lack of robust automated
edit-quality metrics hinders reliable automation at scale. We present an
automated, modular pipeline that mines high-fidelity triplets across domains,
resolutions, instruction complexities, and styles. Built on public generative
models and running without human intervention, our system uses a task-tuned
Gemini validator to score instruction adherence and aesthetics directly,
removing any need for segmentation or grounding models. Inversion and
compositional bootstrapping enlarge the mined set by approximately 2.2x,
enabling large-scale high-fidelity training data. By automating the most
repetitive annotation steps, the approach allows a new scale of training
without human labeling effort. To democratize research in this
resource-intensive area, we release NHR-Edit: an open dataset of 358k
high-quality triplets. In the largest cross-dataset evaluation, it surpasses
all public alternatives. We also release Bagel-NHR-Edit, an open-source
fine-tuned Bagel model, which achieves state-of-the-art metrics in our
experiments.

Conclusion: CF-SSC通过显式建模时空关系，显著提升了遮挡推理和3D场景补全的准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, visual 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) has emerged as a
critical perception task for autonomous driving due to its ability to infer
complete 3D scene layouts and semantics from single 2D images. However, in
real-world traffic scenarios, a significant portion of the scene remains
occluded or outside the camera's field of view -- a fundamental challenge that
existing monocular SSC methods fail to address adequately. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Creating the Future SSC (CF-SSC), a novel temporal SSC
framework that leverages pseudo-future frame prediction to expand the model's
effective perceptual range. Our approach combines poses and depths to establish
accurate 3D correspondences, enabling geometrically-consistent fusion of past,
present, and predicted future frames in 3D space. Unlike conventional methods
that rely on simple feature stacking, our 3D-aware architecture achieves more
robust scene completion by explicitly modeling spatial-temporal relationships.
Comprehensive experiments on SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360 benchmarks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our
approach, highlighting our method's ability to improve occlusion reasoning and
3D scene completion accuracy.

Motivation: 现有多模态融合系统在资源受限环境中部署困难，模态对齐不充分，且对缺失数据鲁棒性差，亟需高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 结合线性复杂度的Mamba模型处理时间序列数据，优化GRAM矩阵实现模态间对齐，并引入低秩自适应层补偿缺失模态。

Result: 在SPAWC2021和USC-HAD数据集上，GRAM-MAMBA显著优于基线，适应缺失模态时性能提升明显且参数更新极少。

Conclusion: GRAM-MAMBA为资源受限环境中的多模态感知提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal fusion is crucial for Internet of Things (IoT) perception, widely
deployed in smart homes, intelligent transport, industrial automation, and
healthcare. However, existing systems often face challenges: high model
complexity hinders deployment in resource-constrained environments,
unidirectional modal alignment neglects inter-modal relationships, and
robustness suffers when sensor data is missing. These issues impede efficient
and robust multimodal perception in real-world IoT settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose GRAM-MAMBA. This framework utilizes the
linear-complexity Mamba model for efficient sensor time-series processing,
combined with an optimized GRAM matrix strategy for pairwise alignment among
modalities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional single-modality
alignment. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we introduce an adaptive
low-rank layer compensation strategy to handle missing modalities
post-training. This strategy freezes the pre-trained model core and irrelevant
adaptive layers, fine-tuning only those related to available modalities and the
fusion process. Extensive experiments validate GRAM-MAMBA's effectiveness. On
the SPAWC2021 indoor positioning dataset, the pre-trained model shows lower
error than baselines; adapting to missing modalities yields a 24.5% performance
boost by training less than 0.2% of parameters. On the USC-HAD human activity
recognition dataset, it achieves 93.55% F1 and 93.81% Overall Accuracy (OA),
outperforming prior work; the update strategy increases F1 by 23% while
training less than 0.3% of parameters. These results highlight GRAM-MAMBA's
potential for achieving efficient and robust multimodal perception in
resource-constrained environments.

Result: 在7个任务的16个数据集上评估，平均性能提升1.8分。

Conclusion: SkySense V2通过统一架构和针对性优化，显著提升了多模态遥感任务的性能。

Abstract: The multi-modal remote sensing foundation model (MM-RSFM) has significantly
advanced various Earth observation tasks, such as urban planning, environmental
monitoring, and natural disaster management. However, most existing approaches
generally require the training of separate backbone networks for each data
modality, leading to redundancy and inefficient parameter utilization.
Moreover, prevalent pre-training methods typically apply self-supervised
learning (SSL) techniques from natural images without adequately accommodating
the characteristics of remote sensing (RS) images, such as the complicated
semantic distribution within a single RS image. In this work, we present
SkySense V2, a unified MM-RSFM that employs a single transformer backbone to
handle multiple modalities. This backbone is pre-trained with a novel SSL
strategy tailored to the distinct traits of RS data. In particular, SkySense V2
incorporates an innovative adaptive patch merging module and learnable modality
prompt tokens to address challenges related to varying resolutions and limited
feature diversity across modalities. In additional, we incorporate the mixture
of experts (MoE) module to further enhance the performance of the foundation
model. SkySense V2 demonstrates impressive generalization abilities through an
extensive evaluation involving 16 datasets over 7 tasks, outperforming SkySense
by an average of 1.8 points.

address these challenges, we introduce a prompting-and-response integration
mechanism that coordinates multiple heterogeneous Video-Language Models (VLMs)
via structured chains of thought, each tailored to distinct reasoning pathways.
An external Large Language Model (LLM) serves as an evaluator and integrator,
selecting and fusing the most reliable responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines across
all evaluation metrics, showcasing superior generalization and robustness. Our
approach offers a lightweight, extensible strategy for advancing multimodal
reasoning without requiring model retraining, setting a strong foundation for

Abstract: Building segmentation in urban areas is essential in fields such as urban

buildings in dense urban regions presents challenges due to the large size and
high resolution of satellite images. This study investigates the use of a
Quanvolutional pre-processing to enhance the capability of the Attention U-Net
model in the building segmentation. Specifically, this paper focuses on the
urban landscape of Tunis, utilizing Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery. In this work, Quanvolution was used to extract more informative
feature maps that capture essential structural details in radar imagery,
proving beneficial for accurate building segmentation. Preliminary results
indicate that proposed methodology achieves comparable test accuracy to the
standard Attention U-Net model while significantly reducing network parameters.
This result aligns with findings from previous works, confirming that
Quanvolution not only maintains model accuracy but also increases computational
efficiency. These promising outcomes highlight the potential of

Conclusion: Depth3DLane无需依赖外部深度数据或已知相机参数，扩展了3D车道检测的适用性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D lane detection is essential for autonomous driving, but
challenging due to the inherent lack of explicit spatial information.
Multi-modal approaches rely on expensive depth sensors, while methods
incorporating fully-supervised depth networks rely on ground-truth depth data
that is impractical to collect at scale. Additionally, existing methods assume
that camera parameters are available, limiting their applicability in scenarios
like crowdsourced high-definition (HD) lane mapping. To address these
limitations, we propose Depth3DLane, a novel dual-pathway framework that
integrates self-supervised monocular depth estimation to provide explicit
structural information, without the need for expensive sensors or additional
ground-truth depth data. Leveraging a self-supervised depth network to obtain a
point cloud representation of the scene, our bird's-eye view pathway extracts
explicit spatial information, while our front view pathway simultaneously
extracts rich semantic information. Depth3DLane then uses 3D lane anchors to
sample features from both pathways and infer accurate 3D lane geometry.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to predict camera parameters on a
per-frame basis and introduce a theoretically motivated fitting procedure to
enhance stability on a per-segment basis. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Depth3DLane achieves competitive performance on the OpenLane benchmark
dataset. Furthermore, experimental results show that using learned parameters
instead of ground-truth parameters allows Depth3DLane to be applied in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像定制方法在实体级空间控制上存在局限性，缺乏绑定身份与精确位置的可扩展数据集。

Method: 构建双向生成范式合成数据，设计轻量级位置调制层解耦空间嵌入，实现独立准确的主体放置。

Result: 实验表明，PositionIC能在图像定制任务中实现精确空间控制并保持高一致性。

Conclusion: PositionIC为开放世界多实体场景的可控高保真图像定制提供了新方向，并将开源促进研究。

Abstract: Recent subject-driven image customization has achieved significant
advancements in fidelity, yet fine-grained entity-level spatial control remains
elusive, hindering the broader real-world application. This limitation is
mainly attributed to scalable datasets that bind identity with precise
positional cues are absent. To this end, we introduce PositionIC, a unified
framework that enforces position and identity consistency for multi-subject
customization. We construct a scalable synthesis pipeline that employs a
bidirectional generation paradigm to eliminate subject drift and maintain
semantic coherence. On top of these data, we design a lightweight positional
modulation layer that decouples spatial embeddings among subjects, enabling
independent, accurate placement while preserving visual fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve precise spatial control
while maintaining high consistency in image customization task. PositionIC
paves the way for controllable, high-fidelity image customization in
open-world, multi-entity scenarios and will be released to foster further
research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究分析了视觉语言模型（VLMs）如何处理内部参数知识与外部信息之间的冲突，通过引入多模态反事实查询数据集，定位并修改控制冲突的特定注意力头，从而引导模型偏向内部知识或视觉输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLMs在处理内部知识与外部信息冲突时可能产生的幻觉和不可靠响应问题，探索其机制。

Method: 引入多模态反事实查询数据集，通过logit检查定位控制冲突的注意力头，并修改这些头以引导模型行为。

Result: 成功定位并修改了控制冲突的注意力头，能够引导模型偏向内部知识或视觉输入，且这些头的注意力定位优于基于梯度的归因方法。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs处理知识冲突的机制，并提出了一种通过修改注意力头来引导模型行为的方法，为提升模型可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) increasingly leverage diverse knowledge sources
to address complex tasks, often encountering conflicts between their internal
parametric knowledge and external information. Knowledge conflicts can result
in hallucinations and unreliable responses, but the mechanisms governing such
interactions remain unknown. To address this gap, we analyze the mechanisms
that VLMs use to resolve cross-modal conflicts by introducing a dataset of
multimodal counterfactual queries that deliberately contradict internal
commonsense knowledge. We localize with logit inspection a small set of heads
that control the conflict. Moreover, by modifying these heads, we can steer the
model towards its internal knowledge or the visual inputs. Finally, we show
that attention from such heads pinpoints localized image regions driving visual
overrides, outperforming gradient-based attribution in precision.

Conclusion: 所提方法在动态海洋环境中有效提高了目标定位和关联的准确性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing marine vision by fusing
real-time visual data with chart information. Our system overlays nautical
chart data onto live video feeds by accurately matching detected navigational
aids, such as buoys, with their corresponding representations in chart data. To
achieve robust association, we introduce a transformer-based end-to-end neural
network that predicts bounding boxes and confidence scores for buoy queries,
enabling the direct matching of image-domain detections with world-space chart
markers. The proposed method is compared against baseline approaches, including
a ray-casting model that estimates buoy positions via camera projection and a
YOLOv7-based network extended with a distance estimation module. Experimental
results on a dataset of real-world maritime scenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves object localization and association accuracy in
dynamic and challenging environments.

TL;DR: PCR-GS是一种无需COLMAP的3D高斯泼溅技术，通过相机姿态共正则化提升复杂相机轨迹下的3D场景建模和姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D-GS技术在复杂相机轨迹下表现不佳，导致相机姿态估计和联合优化陷入局部最优。

Method: 提出两种正则化方法：特征重投影正则化和基于小波的高频细节正则化。

Result: 实验表明PCR-GS在剧烈变化的相机轨迹下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PCR-GS通过共正则化有效解决了复杂相机轨迹下的3D场景建模问题。

Abstract: COLMAP-free 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) has recently attracted increasing
attention due to its remarkable performance in reconstructing high-quality 3D
scenes from unposed images or videos. However, it often struggles to handle
scenes with complex camera trajectories as featured by drastic rotation and
translation across adjacent camera views, leading to degraded estimation of
camera poses and further local minima in joint optimization of camera poses and
3D-GS. We propose PCR-GS, an innovative COLMAP-free 3DGS technique that
achieves superior 3D scene modeling and camera pose estimation via camera pose
co-regularization. PCR-GS achieves regularization from two perspectives. The
first is feature reprojection regularization which extracts view-robust DINO
features from adjacent camera views and aligns their semantic information for
camera pose regularization. The second is wavelet-based frequency
regularization which exploits discrepancy in high-frequency details to further
optimize the rotation matrix in camera poses. Extensive experiments over
multiple real-world scenes show that the proposed PCR-GS achieves superior
pose-free 3D-GS scene modeling under dramatic changes of camera trajectories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用DepthAnything模型预测的深度先验来增强LiDAR点云特征的方法，通过双路径RoI特征提取和双向门控融合模块，显著提升了3D目标检测的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR点云特征表达能力有限，尤其是反射率属性的区分能力较弱，而DepthAnything提供的密集几何先验可以弥补这一不足。

Method: 将DepthAnything预测的深度先验与原始LiDAR属性融合，提出点级特征提取模块和双路径RoI特征提取框架（体素分支和点分支），并通过双向门控融合模块整合全局与局部特征。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，检测精度显著提升。

Conclusion: 将视觉基础模型的先验知识融入LiDAR 3D目标检测具有重要价值。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have opened up new possibilities for
enhancing 3D perception. In particular, DepthAnything offers dense and reliable
geometric priors from monocular RGB images, which can complement sparse LiDAR
data in autonomous driving scenarios. However, such priors remain underutilized
in LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we address the limited
expressiveness of raw LiDAR point features, especially the weak discriminative
capability of the reflectance attribute, by introducing depth priors predicted
by DepthAnything. These priors are fused with the original LiDAR attributes to
enrich each point's representation. To leverage the enhanced point features, we
propose a point-wise feature extraction module. Then, a Dual-Path RoI feature
extraction framework is employed, comprising a voxel-based branch for global
semantic context and a point-based branch for fine-grained structural details.
To effectively integrate the complementary RoI features, we introduce a
bidirectional gated RoI feature fusion module that balances global and local
cues. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark show that our method
consistently improves detection accuracy, demonstrating the value of
incorporating visual foundation model priors into LiDAR-based 3D object
detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TimeNeRF是一种通用的神经渲染方法，能够在任意视角和时间下渲染新视图，即使输入视图较少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，多视图采集成本高且对未见场景重新优化效率低。元宇宙等数字领域需要能够自然模拟昼夜过渡的3D环境。

Method: 结合多视图立体、神经辐射场和解缠策略，构建隐式内容辐射场，支持任意时间的神经辐射场建模。

Result: TimeNeRF能在少样本设置下无需逐场景优化渲染新视图，并能平滑过渡不同时间，捕捉自然场景变化。

Conclusion: TimeNeRF为时间动态3D场景建模提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present TimeNeRF, a generalizable neural rendering approach for rendering
novel views at arbitrary viewpoints and at arbitrary times, even with few input
views. For real-world applications, it is expensive to collect multiple views
and inefficient to re-optimize for unseen scenes. Moreover, as the digital
realm, particularly the metaverse, strives for increasingly immersive
experiences, the ability to model 3D environments that naturally transition
between day and night becomes paramount. While current techniques based on
Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable proficiency in synthesizing
novel views, the exploration of NeRF's potential for temporal 3D scene modeling
remains limited, with no dedicated datasets available for this purpose. To this
end, our approach harnesses the strengths of multi-view stereo, neural radiance
fields, and disentanglement strategies across diverse datasets. This equips our
model with the capability for generalizability in a few-shot setting, allows us
to construct an implicit content radiance field for scene representation, and
further enables the building of neural radiance fields at any arbitrary time.
Finally, we synthesize novel views of that time via volume rendering.
Experiments show that TimeNeRF can render novel views in a few-shot setting
without per-scene optimization. Most notably, it excels in creating realistic
novel views that transition smoothly across different times, adeptly capturing
intricate natural scene changes from dawn to dusk.

TL;DR: DiViD是一种端到端的视频扩散框架，用于显式分离静态外观和动态运动，通过全局静态令牌和帧特定动态令牌实现，并在解码器中引入关键归纳偏置以减少信息泄漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于VAE和GAN的方法在视频中分离静态和动态内容时存在信息泄漏和模糊重建问题，DiViD旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: DiViD通过序列编码器提取全局静态令牌和帧特定动态令牌，解码器采用共享噪声计划、时间变化的KL瓶颈和交叉注意力机制，并引入正交性正则化器。

Result: DiViD在真实基准测试中表现优异，具有最高的交换联合准确度，保持静态保真度并改善动态传递，同时减少平均交叉泄漏。

Conclusion: DiViD是首个实现显式静态-动态分解的视频扩散框架，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Unsupervised disentanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion in video
remains a fundamental challenge, often hindered by information leakage and
blurry reconstructions in existing VAE- and GAN-based approaches. We introduce
DiViD, the first end-to-end video diffusion framework for explicit
static-dynamic factorization. DiViD's sequence encoder extracts a global static
token from the first frame and per-frame dynamic tokens, explicitly removing
static content from the motion code. Its conditional DDPM decoder incorporates
three key inductive biases: a shared-noise schedule for temporal consistency, a
time-varying KL-based bottleneck that tightens at early timesteps (compressing
static information) and relaxes later (enriching dynamics), and cross-attention
that routes the global static token to all frames while keeping dynamic tokens
frame-specific. An orthogonality regularizer further prevents residual
static-dynamic leakage. We evaluate DiViD on real-world benchmarks using
swap-based accuracy and cross-leakage metrics. DiViD outperforms
state-of-the-art sequential disentanglement methods: it achieves the highest
swap-based joint accuracy, preserves static fidelity while improving dynamic
transfer, and reduces average cross-leakage.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在九个模型和四个任务中表现一致，验证了感知能力与预测性能的强相关性。

Conclusion: 结合表征学习和生成模型对视频理解具有重要意义。

Abstract: Forecasting what will happen next is a critical skill for general-purpose
systems that plan or act in the world at different levels of abstraction. In
this paper, we identify a strong correlation between a vision model's
perceptual ability and its generalist forecasting performance over short time
horizons. This trend holds across a diverse set of pretrained models-including
those trained generatively-and across multiple levels of abstraction, from raw
pixels to depth, point tracks, and object motion. The result is made possible
by a novel generalist forecasting framework that operates on any frozen vision
backbone: we train latent diffusion models to forecast future features in the
frozen representation space, which are then decoded via lightweight,
task-specific readouts. To enable consistent evaluation across tasks, we
introduce distributional metrics that compare distributional properties
directly in the space of downstream tasks and apply this framework to nine
models and four tasks. Our results highlight the value of bridging
representation learning and generative modeling for temporally grounded video
understanding.

The framework differentiates privacy levels in alignment with human visual

practicality. This study, along with the HR-VISPR dataset, serves as an
insightful tool and offers a structured evaluation framework applicable across
diverse contexts.

Motivation: 现有的内容-风格分解方法主要针对扩散模型，而视觉自回归模型（VAR）作为一种新兴的生成框架，尚未被充分探索。本文旨在利用VAR的逐尺度生成特性，改进内容与风格的解耦。

Result: 实验表明，CSD-VAR在内容保留和风格化保真度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CSD-VAR为内容-风格分解提供了一种高效的新框架，展示了VAR在生成任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Disentangling content and style from a single image, known as content-style
decomposition (CSD), enables recontextualization of extracted content and
stylization of extracted styles, offering greater creative flexibility in
visual synthesis. While recent personalization methods have explored the
decomposition of explicit content style, they remain tailored for diffusion
models. Meanwhile, Visual Autoregressive Modeling (VAR) has emerged as a
promising alternative with a next-scale prediction paradigm, achieving
performance comparable to that of diffusion models. In this paper, we explore
VAR as a generative framework for CSD, leveraging its scale-wise generation
process for improved disentanglement. To this end, we propose CSD-VAR, a novel
method that introduces three key innovations: (1) a scale-aware alternating
optimization strategy that aligns content and style representation with their
respective scales to enhance separation, (2) an SVD-based rectification method
to mitigate content leakage into style representations, and (3) an Augmented
Key-Value (K-V) memory enhancing content identity preservation. To benchmark
this task, we introduce CSD-100, a dataset specifically designed for
content-style decomposition, featuring diverse subjects rendered in various
artistic styles. Experiments demonstrate that CSD-VAR outperforms prior
approaches, achieving superior content preservation and stylization fidelity.

Abstract: Generating 3D scenes from natural language holds great promise for
applications in gaming, film, and design. However, existing methods struggle
with automation, 3D consistency, and fine-grained control. We present
DreamScene, an end-to-end framework for high-quality and editable 3D scene
generation from text or dialogue. DreamScene begins with a scene planning
module, where a GPT-4 agent infers object semantics and spatial constraints to
construct a hybrid graph. A graph-based placement algorithm then produces a
structured, collision-free layout. Based on this layout, Formation Pattern
Sampling (FPS) generates object geometry using multi-timestep sampling and
reconstructive optimization, enabling fast and realistic synthesis. To ensure
global consistent, DreamScene employs a progressive camera sampling strategy
tailored to both indoor and outdoor settings. Finally, the system supports
fine-grained scene editing, including object movement, appearance changes, and
4D dynamic motion. Experiments demonstrate that DreamScene surpasses prior
methods in quality, consistency, and flexibility, offering a practical solution
for open-domain 3D content creation. Code and demos are available at

Abstract: Tunnel lining crack is a crucial indicator of tunnels' safety status. Aiming
to classify and segment tunnel cracks with enhanced accuracy and efficiency,
this study proposes a two-step deep learning-based method. An automatic tunnel
image classification model is developed using the DenseNet-169 in the first
step. The proposed crack segmentation model in the second step is based on the
DeepLabV3+, whose internal logic is evaluated via a score-weighted visual
explanation technique. Proposed method combines tunnel image classification and
segmentation together, so that the selected images containing cracks from the
first step are segmented in the second step to improve the detection accuracy
and efficiency. The superior performances of the two-step method are validated
by experiments. The results show that the accuracy and frames per second (FPS)
of the tunnel crack classification model are 92.23% and 39.80, respectively,
which are higher than other convolutional neural networks (CNN) based and
Transformer based models. Also, the intersection over union (IoU) and F1 score
of the tunnel crack segmentation model are 57.01% and 67.44%, respectively,
outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Moreover, the provided visual
explanations in this study are conducive to understanding the "black box" of
deep learning-based models. The developed two-stage deep learning-based method
integrating visual explanations provides a basis for fast and accurate
quantitative assessment of tunnel health status.

Conclusion: 通过将抽象情绪与具体视觉变化关联，为实际应用中的情绪内容创作提供了新可能。

Abstract: Bridging emotions and visual content for emotion-driven image editing holds
great potential in creative industries, yet precise manipulation remains
challenging due to the abstract nature of emotions and their varied
manifestations across different contexts. We tackle this challenge with an
integrated approach consisting of three complementary components. First, we
introduce MoodArchive, an 8M+ image dataset with detailed hierarchical
emotional annotations generated by LLaVA and partially validated by human
evaluators. Second, we develop MoodifyCLIP, a vision-language model fine-tuned
on MoodArchive to translate abstract emotions into specific visual attributes.
Third, we propose Moodifier, a training-free editing model leveraging
MoodifyCLIP and multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable precise
emotional transformations while preserving content integrity. Our system works
across diverse domains such as character expressions, fashion design, jewelry,
and home d\'ecor, enabling creators to quickly visualize emotional variations
while preserving identity and structure. Extensive experimental evaluations
show that Moodifier outperforms existing methods in both emotional accuracy and
content preservation, providing contextually appropriate edits. By linking
abstract emotions to concrete visual changes, our solution unlocks new
possibilities for emotional content creation in real-world applications. We
will release the MoodArchive dataset, MoodifyCLIP model, and make the Moodifier
code and demo publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive, low-cost bedside
imaging modality with high temporal resolution, making it suitable for bedside
monitoring. However, its inherently ill-posed inverse problem poses significant
challenges for accurate image reconstruction. Deep learning (DL)-based
approaches have shown promise but often rely on complex network architectures
with a large number of parameters, limiting efficiency and scalability. Here,
we propose an Ultra-Lightweight Quantum-Assisted Inference (QuantEIT) framework
for EIT image reconstruction. QuantEIT leverages a Quantum-Assisted Network
(QA-Net), combining parallel 2-qubit quantum circuits to generate expressive
latent representations that serve as implicit nonlinear priors, followed by a
single linear layer for conductivity reconstruction. This design drastically
reduces model complexity and parameter number. Uniquely, QuantEIT operates in
an unsupervised, training-data-free manner and represents the first integration
of quantum circuits into EIT image reconstruction. Extensive experiments on
simulated and real-world 2D and 3D EIT lung imaging data demonstrate that
QuantEIT outperforms conventional methods, achieving comparable or superior
reconstruction accuracy using only 0.2% of the parameters, with enhanced
robustness to noise.

Method: 提出Mamba结构感知的重要性评分，并基于此设计无需训练的MTR框架。

Result: MTR在Vim-B骨干上减少约40% FLOPs，ImageNet性能仅下降1.6%。

Conclusion: MTR是一种高效、即插即用的token缩减方法，适用于多种Mamba模型。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has emerged as a strong competitor to Vision Transformers (ViTs)
due to its ability to efficiently capture long-range dependencies with linear
computational complexity. While token reduction, an effective compression
technique in ViTs, has rarely been explored in Vision Mamba. Exploring Vision
Mamba's efficiency is essential for enabling broader applications. However, we
find that directly applying existing token reduction techniques for ViTs to
Vision Mamba leads to significant performance degradation. This is primarily
because Mamba is a sequence model without attention mechanisms, whereas most
token reduction techniques for ViTs rely on attention mechanisms for importance
measurement and overlook the order of compressed tokens. In this paper, we
investigate a Mamba structure-aware importance score to evaluate token
importance in a simple and effective manner. Building on this score, we further
propose MTR, a training-free \textbf{M}amba \textbf{T}oken \textbf{R}eduction
framework. Without the need for training or additional tuning parameters, our
method can be seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play component across various
Mamba models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly
reduces computational workload while minimizing performance impact across
various tasks and multiple backbones. Notably, MTR reduces FLOPs by
approximately 40\% on the Vim-B backbone, with only a 1.6\% drop in ImageNet
performance without retraining.

Conclusion: 冻结预训练基础模型在皮肤病分类的类增量学习中具有显著优势，支持其在现实医疗应用中的广泛采用。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes over time without
forgetting previously acquired knowledge. The emergence of foundation models
(FM) pretrained on large datasets presents new opportunities for CIL by
offering rich, transferable representations. However, their potential for
enabling incremental learning in dermatology remains largely unexplored. In
this paper, we systematically evaluate frozen FMs pretrained on large-scale
skin lesion datasets for CIL in dermatological disease classification. We
propose a simple yet effective approach where the backbone remains frozen, and
a lightweight MLP is trained incrementally for each task. This setup achieves
state-of-the-art performance without forgetting, outperforming regularization,
replay, and architecture based methods. To further explore the capabilities of
frozen FMs, we examine zero training scenarios using nearest mean classifiers
with prototypes derived from their embeddings. Through extensive ablation
studies, we demonstrate that this prototype based variant can also achieve
competitive results. Our findings highlight the strength of frozen FMs for
continual learning in dermatology and support their broader adoption in real
world medical applications. Our code and datasets are available here.

TL;DR: VLA-Mark是一种视觉对齐水印框架，通过跨模态协调嵌入可检测水印，同时保持语义保真度，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本水印方法破坏了视觉-文本对齐，导致语义关键概念易受攻击，需要一种保护知识产权且不影响多模态一致性的解决方案。

Method: 结合多尺度视觉-文本对齐指标（局部补丁亲和性、全局语义连贯性和上下文注意力模式），动态平衡水印强度和语义保留。

Result: 实验显示，PPL降低7.4%，BLEU提高26.6%，检测准确率达98.8% AUC，抗攻击能力达96.1%。

Conclusion: VLA-Mark为质量保持的多模态水印设定了新标准。

Abstract: Vision-language models demand watermarking solutions that protect
intellectual property without compromising multimodal coherence. Existing text
watermarking methods disrupt visual-textual alignment through biased token
selection and static strategies, leaving semantic-critical concepts vulnerable.
We propose VLA-Mark, a vision-aligned framework that embeds detectable
watermarks while preserving semantic fidelity through cross-modal coordination.
Our approach integrates multiscale visual-textual alignment metrics, combining
localized patch affinity, global semantic coherence, and contextual attention
patterns, to guide watermark injection without model retraining. An
entropy-sensitive mechanism dynamically balances watermark strength and
semantic preservation, prioritizing visual grounding during low-uncertainty
generation phases. Experiments show 7.4% lower PPL and 26.6% higher BLEU than
conventional methods, with near-perfect detection (98.8% AUC). The framework
demonstrates 96.1\% attack resilience against attacks such as paraphrasing and
synonym substitution, while maintaining text-visual consistency, establishing
new standards for quality-preserving multimodal watermarking

TL;DR: 论文研究了四种匿名化技术对监控视频异常检测性能的影响，发现匿名化数据仍可支持检测，且某些技术甚至能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在异常检测中应用广泛，但涉及敏感数据隐私问题，需平衡隐私保护与检测效果。

Method: 在UCF-Crime数据集上应用模糊、掩码、加密和虚拟替换四种匿名化技术，评估四种异常检测方法（MGFN、UR-DMU、BN-WVAD、PEL4VAD）的性能。

Result: 匿名化数据下异常检测仍可行，某些模型在加密和掩码技术下AUC性能反而提升，算法设计对匿名化敏感。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了隐私保护与检测效用的权衡，为未来隐私保护设计提供了基准和洞见。

Abstract: Advancements in deep learning have improved anomaly detection in surveillance
videos, yet they raise urgent privacy concerns due to the collection of
sensitive human data. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of
anomaly detection performance under four human anonymization techniques,
including blurring, masking, encryption, and avatar replacement, applied to the
UCF-Crime dataset. We evaluate four anomaly detection methods, MGFN, UR-DMU,
BN-WVAD, and PEL4VAD, on the anonymized UCF-Crime to reveal how each method
responds to different obfuscation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate
that anomaly detection remains viable under anonymized data and is dependent on
the algorithmic design and the learning strategy. For instance, under certain
anonymization patterns, such as encryption and masking, some models
inadvertently achieve higher AUC performance compared to raw data, due to the
strong responsiveness of their algorithmic components to these noise patterns.
These results highlight the algorithm-specific sensitivities to anonymization
and emphasize the trade-off between preserving privacy and maintaining
detection utility. Furthermore, we compare these conventional anonymization
techniques with the emerging privacy-by-design solutions, highlighting an often
overlooked trade-off between robust privacy protection and utility flexibility.
Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, this study provides a
compelling benchmark and insights into balancing human privacy with the demands
of anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的自动化软件（Carebot AI Bones）用于测量脊柱侧弯的Cobb角，在多中心评估中表现出与放射科医生相近的测量精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脊柱侧弯影响2-4%的青少年，传统手动测量Cobb角耗时且存在观察者间差异，需要一种自动化解决方案以提高效率和一致性。

Method: 研究回顾性评估了103张站立位全脊柱X光片，使用Carebot AI Bones软件自动测量Cobb角，并与两位放射科医生的独立测量结果进行对比。

Result: AI与放射科医生的测量误差较小（MAE约3.9度），Pearson相关系数高（0.88-0.91），Cohen kappa显示分类一致性中等（0.51-0.64）。

Conclusion: 该软件在多中心验证中表现出与专家相当的测量能力，可用于临床工作流中优化脊柱侧弯的报告和分诊。

Abstract: Scoliosis affects roughly 2 to 4 percent of adolescents, and treatment
decisions depend on precise Cobb angle measurement. Manual assessment is time
consuming and subject to inter observer variation. We conducted a
retrospective, multi centre evaluation of a fully automated deep learning
software (Carebot AI Bones, Spine Measurement functionality; Carebot s.r.o.) on
103 standing anteroposterior whole spine radiographs collected from ten
hospitals. Two musculoskeletal radiologists independently measured each study
and served as reference readers. Agreement between the AI and each radiologist
was assessed with Bland Altman analysis, mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
squared error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient, and Cohen kappa for four
grade severity classification. Against Radiologist 1 the AI achieved an MAE of
3.89 degrees (RMSE 4.77 degrees) with a bias of 0.70 degrees and limits of
agreement from minus 8.59 to plus 9.99 degrees. Against Radiologist 2 the AI
achieved an MAE of 3.90 degrees (RMSE 5.68 degrees) with a bias of 2.14 degrees
and limits from minus 8.23 to plus 12.50 degrees. Pearson correlations were r
equals 0.906 and r equals 0.880 (inter reader r equals 0.928), while Cohen
kappa for severity grading reached 0.51 and 0.64 (inter reader kappa 0.59).
These results demonstrate that the proposed software reproduces expert level
Cobb angle measurements and categorical grading across multiple centres,
suggesting its utility for streamlining scoliosis reporting and triage in
clinical workflows.

TL;DR: C-DOG是一种无需训练的框架，通过结合连接增量重叠图和极线几何，在多视图中鲁棒地关联目标检测，适用于噪声和视觉不可区分场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在目标视觉不可区分或噪声干扰时失效的问题。

Method: 结合连接增量重叠图建模与极线几何，通过图节点表示2D观测，边权重由极线一致性决定，并采用增量邻居重叠聚类和IQR过滤提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在合成基准测试中优于基于几何的基线方法，并在高目标密度、无视觉特征和有限相机重叠等挑战条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: C-DOG适用于实际场景中可扩展的3D重建，尤其在噪声和视觉不可区分条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Multi-view multi-object association is a fundamental step in 3D
reconstruction pipelines, enabling consistent grouping of object instances
across multiple camera views. Existing methods often rely on appearance
features or geometric constraints such as epipolar consistency. However, these
approaches can fail when objects are visually indistinguishable or observations
are corrupted by noise. We propose C-DOG, a training-free framework that serves
as an intermediate module bridging object detection (or pose estimation) and 3D
reconstruction, without relying on visual features. It combines connected
delta-overlap graph modeling with epipolar geometry to robustly associate
detections across views. Each 2D observation is represented as a graph node,
with edges weighted by epipolar consistency. A delta-neighbor-overlap
clustering step identifies strongly consistent groups while tolerating noise
and partial connectivity. To further improve robustness, we incorporate
Interquartile Range (IQR)-based filtering and a 3D back-projection error
criterion to eliminate inconsistent observations. Extensive experiments on
synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that C-DOG outperforms geometry-based
baselines and remains robust under challenging conditions, including high
object density, without visual features, and limited camera overlap, making it
well-suited for scalable 3D reconstruction in real-world scenarios.

Motivation: 旨在提供一个开源、高性能的视觉基础模型，并解决现有SSL聚类方法中的语义模糊问题。

Conclusion: Franca为透明、高性能的视觉模型设立了新标准，推动了AI社区的可复现性和通用性。

Abstract: We present Franca (pronounced Fran-ka): free one; the first fully open-source
(data, code, weights) vision foundation model that matches and in many cases
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art proprietary models, e.g., DINOv2,
CLIP, SigLIPv2, etc. Our approach is grounded in a transparent training
pipeline inspired by Web-SSL and uses publicly available data: ImageNet-21K and
a subset of ReLAION-2B. Beyond model release, we tackle critical limitations in
SSL clustering methods. While modern models rely on assigning image features to
large codebooks via clustering algorithms like Sinkhorn-Knopp, they fail to
account for the inherent ambiguity in clustering semantics. To address this, we
introduce a parameter-efficient, multi-head clustering projector based on
nested Matryoshka representations. This design progressively refines features
into increasingly fine-grained clusters without increasing the model size,
enabling both performance and memory efficiency. Additionally, we propose a
novel positional disentanglement strategy that explicitly removes positional
biases from dense representations, thereby improving the encoding of semantic
content. This leads to consistent gains on several downstream benchmarks,
demonstrating the utility of cleaner feature spaces. Our contributions
establish a new standard for transparent, high-performance vision models and
open a path toward more reproducible and generalizable foundation models for
the broader AI community. The code and model checkpoints are available at

Motivation: 填补对Transformer架构理论理解的空白，从物理角度解释其工作原理。

Method: 在Fock空间上构建物理模型，将Transformer架构实现为开放量子系统。

Result: 提出了支持Transformer架构的物理模型。

Conclusion: 从物理角度为Transformer架构提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The introduction of the transformer architecture in 2017 (cf.\cite{VSP2017})
marked the most striking advancement in natural language processing. The
transformer is a model architecture relying entirely on an attention mechanism
to draw global dependencies between input and output. However, we believe there
is a gap in our theoretical understanding of what the transformer is, and why
it works physically. In this paper, from a physical perspective on modern
chips, we construct physical models in the Fock space over the Hilbert space of
tokens realizing large language models based on a transformer architecture as
open quantum systems. Our physical models underlie the transformer architecture
for large language models.

Conclusion: 视频基础模型与掩码动作预测结合，有望实现多样化现实场景中的可扩展机器人操作。

Abstract: Bimanual robotic manipulation, which involves the coordinated control of two
robotic arms, is foundational for solving challenging tasks. Despite recent
progress in general-purpose manipulation, data scarcity and embodiment
heterogeneity remain serious obstacles to further scaling up in bimanual
settings. In this paper, we introduce VIdeo Diffusion for Action Reasoning
(VIDAR), a two-stage framework that leverages large-scale, diffusion-based
video pre-training and a novel masked inverse dynamics model for action
prediction. We pre-train the video diffusion model on 750K multi-view videos
from three real-world bimanual robot platforms, utilizing a unified observation
space that encodes robot, camera, task, and scene contexts. Our masked inverse
dynamics model learns masks to extract action-relevant information from
generated trajectories without requiring pixel-level labels, and the masks can
effectively generalize to unseen backgrounds. Our experiments demonstrate that
with only 20 minutes of human demonstrations on an unseen robot platform (only
1% of typical data requirements), VIDAR generalizes to unseen tasks and
backgrounds with strong semantic understanding, surpassing state-of-the-art
methods. Our findings highlight the potential of video foundation models,
coupled with masked action prediction, to enable scalable and generalizable
robotic manipulation in diverse real-world settings.

Conclusion: 研究为构建更公平和对齐的T2I模型提供了基础工具和方法。

Abstract: Current text-to-image (T2I) models often fail to account for diverse human
experiences, leading to misaligned systems. We advocate for pluralistic
alignment, where an AI understands and is steerable towards diverse, and often
conflicting, human values. Our work provides three core contributions to
achieve this in T2I models. First, we introduce a novel dataset for Diverse
Intersectional Visual Evaluation (DIVE) -- the first multimodal dataset for
pluralistic alignment. It enable deep alignment to diverse safety perspectives
through a large pool of demographically intersectional human raters who
provided extensive feedback across 1000 prompts, with high replication,
capturing nuanced safety perceptions. Second, we empirically confirm
demographics as a crucial proxy for diverse viewpoints in this domain,
revealing significant, context-dependent differences in harm perception that
diverge from conventional evaluations. Finally, we discuss implications for
building aligned T2I models, including efficient data collection strategies,
LLM judgment capabilities, and model steerability towards diverse perspectives.
This research offers foundational tools for more equitable and aligned T2I
systems. Content Warning: The paper includes sensitive content that may be

Method: 采用跨模态自监督预训练方法，利用大规模未标记的IMU-视频数据学习表征。

Result: 在零样本和少样本评估中，该方法优于当前最先进的IMU-视频预训练方法和仅IMU预训练方法。

Conclusion: 跨模态预训练是学习动态数据模态（如IMU信号）通用表征的有效工具。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) based on wearable inertial sensors plays a
critical role in remote health monitoring. In patients with movement disorders,
the ability to detect abnormal patient movements in their home environments can
enable continuous optimization of treatments and help alert caretakers as
needed. Machine learning approaches have been proposed for HAR tasks using
Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data; however, most rely on
application-specific labels and lack generalizability to data collected in
different environments or populations. To address this limitation, we propose a
new cross-modal self-supervised pretraining approach to learn representations
from large-sale unlabeled IMU-video data and demonstrate improved
generalizability in HAR tasks on out of distribution (OOD) IMU datasets,
including a dataset collected from patients with Parkinson's disease.
Specifically, our results indicate that the proposed cross-modal pretraining
approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art IMU-video pretraining
approach and IMU-only pretraining under zero-shot and few-shot evaluations.
Broadly, our study provides evidence that in highly dynamic data modalities,
such as IMU signals, cross-modal pretraining may be a useful tool to learn
generalizable data representations. Our software is available at

Motivation: 由于LLM生成的内容可能存在抄袭和幻觉问题，且网站通常不披露此类内容，需要开发可靠的检测工具以帮助用户识别。

Method: 提出了一种基于多页文本检测的分类管道，通过训练和评估两个数据集（共120个网站），实现了100%的准确率。

Result: 在搜索引擎和Common Crawl数据中检测到大量LLM主导的网站，并发现这些网站在搜索结果中排名较高且数量增长迅速。

Conclusion: LLM主导的网站对用户和网络生态系统可能产生负面影响，需要进一步研究和监管。

Abstract: Increasingly, web content is automatically generated by large language models
(LLMs) with little human input. We call this "LLM-dominant" content. Since LLMs
plagiarize and hallucinate, LLM-dominant content can be unreliable and
unethical. Yet, websites rarely disclose such content, and human readers
struggle to distinguish it. Thus, we must develop reliable detectors for
LLM-dominant content. However, state-of-the-art LLM detectors are insufficient,
because they perform well mainly on clean, prose-like text, while web content
has complex markup and diverse genres.
  We propose a highly reliable, scalable pipeline that classifies entire
websites. Instead of naively classifying text extracted from each page, we
classify each site based on an LLM text detector's outputs of multiple
prose-like pages. We train and evaluate our detector by collecting 2 distinct
ground truth datasets totaling 120 sites, and obtain 100% accuracies testing
across them. In the wild, we detect a sizable portion of sites as LLM-dominant
among 10k sites in search engine results and 10k in Common Crawl archives. We
find LLM-dominant sites are growing in prevalence and rank highly in search
results, raising questions about their impact on end users and the overall Web
ecosystem.

Conclusion: EVLA为边缘设备上的实时视觉-语言-动作任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to address
the data scarcity challenge in robotics, enabling the development of
generalizable visuomotor control policies. While models like OpenVLA showcase
the potential of this paradigm, deploying large-scale VLMs on
resource-constrained mobile manipulation systems remains a significant hurdle.
This paper introduces Edge VLA (EVLA), a novel approach designed to
significantly enhance the inference speed of Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models. EVLA maintains the representational power of these models while
enabling real-time performance on edge devices. We achieve this through two key
innovations: 1) Eliminating the autoregressive requirement for end-effector
position prediction, leading to a 7x speedup in inference, and 2) Leveraging
the efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating comparable
training performance to larger models with significantly reduced computational
demands. Our early results demonstrate that EVLA achieves comparable training
characteristics to OpenVLA while offering substantial gains in inference speed
and memory efficiency. We release our model checkpoints and training

while exploiting the predictive power of modern vision transformers for latent

Abstract: In the European Union, official food safety monitoring data collected by
member states are submitted to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and
published on Zenodo. This data includes 392 million analytical results derived
from over 15.2 million samples covering more than 4,000 different types of food

*Sara Avesani,Gianluca Giacchi,Michael Multerer*

Main category: math.NA

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于小波系数衰减行为的边缘检测方法，用于非均匀采样多元信号的局部规律性检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统小波方法在低维结构化数据中有效，但在高维和分散数据中表现不佳，需要一种更通用的方法。

Method: 使用快速样本变换（一种针对分散数据的小波变换）分析样本系数的衰减与信号点规律性的关系。

Result: 样本变换在高维和分散数据中表现出色，并通过数值实验验证了其在一维、二维和三维信号中的应用。

Conclusion: 样本变换为多元信号的局部规律性检测提供了高效且通用的工具。

Abstract: Inspired by edge detection based on the decay behavior of wavelet
coefficients, we introduce a (near) linear-time algorithm for detecting the
local regularity in non-uniformly sampled multivariate signals. Our approach
quantifies regularity within the framework of microlocal spaces introduced by
Jaffard. The central tool in our analysis is the fast samplet transform, a
distributional wavelet transform tailored to scattered data. We establish a
connection between the decay of samplet coefficients and the pointwise
regularity of multivariate signals. As a by product, we derive decay estimates
for functions belonging to classical H\"older spaces and Sobolev-Slobodeckij
spaces. While traditional wavelets are effective for regularity detection in
low-dimensional structured data, samplets demonstrate robust performance even
for higher dimensional and scattered data. To illustrate our theoretical
findings, we present extensive numerical studies detecting local regularity of
one-, two- and three-dimensional signals, ranging from non-uniformly sampled
time series over image segmentation to edge detection in point clouds.

*Mehrab Hosain,Rajiv Kapoor*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合APVD和伪随机像素选择的新型隐写方法，解决了未使用块问题，提升了安全性、嵌入容量和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: APVD方法存在未使用块问题，导致安全性、嵌入容量和视觉质量下降，需要改进。

Method: 结合APVD与伪随机像素选择，优化像素嵌入策略。

Result: 新方法在安全性、嵌入容量和图像质量（PSNR、UIQ、SSIM）上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 新方法通用性强，适用于多种图像类型，确保安全传输且不损害图像美观。

Abstract: Steganography is the process of embedding secret information discreetly
within a carrier, ensuring secure exchange of confidential data. The Adaptive
Pixel Value Differencing (APVD) steganography method, while effective,
encounters certain challenges like the "unused blocks" issue. This problem can
cause a decrease in security, compromise the embedding capacity, and lead to
lower visual quality. This research presents a novel steganographic strategy
that integrates APVD with pseudorandom pixel selection to effectively mitigate
these issues. The results indicate that the new method outperforms existing
techniques in aspects of security, data hiding capacity, and the preservation
of image quality. Empirical results reveal that the combination of APVD with
pseudorandom pixel selection significantly enhances key image quality metrics
such as Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Universal Image Quality Index (UIQ),
and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), surpassing other contemporary methods
in performance. The newly proposed method is versatile, able to handle a
variety of cover and secret images in both color and grayscale, thereby
ensuring secure data transmission without compromising the aesthetic quality of
the image.

*Amro Abdalla,Ismail Shaheen,Dan DeGenaro,Rupayan Mallick,Bogdan Raita,Sarah Adel Bargal*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: GIFT是一种梯度感知免疫技术，通过双层优化问题防御扩散模型免受恶意微调攻击，同时保留安全内容生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全机制（如安全检查器）易被绕过，概念擦除方法在对抗性微调下失效，因此需要一种更鲁棒的防御方法。

Method: GIFT将免疫问题建模为双层优化：上层目标通过表示噪声和最大化降低有害概念的表示能力，下层目标保留安全数据的性能。

Result: 实验表明，GIFT显著削弱模型重新学习有害概念的能力，同时保持安全内容的生成质量。

Conclusion: GIFT为构建抗对抗性微调攻击的生成模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We present GIFT: a {G}radient-aware {I}mmunization technique to defend
diffusion models against malicious {F}ine-{T}uning while preserving their
ability to generate safe content. Existing safety mechanisms like safety
checkers are easily bypassed, and concept erasure methods fail under
adversarial fine-tuning. GIFT addresses this by framing immunization as a
bi-level optimization problem: the upper-level objective degrades the model's
ability to represent harmful concepts using representation noising and
maximization, while the lower-level objective preserves performance on safe
data. GIFT achieves robust resistance to malicious fine-tuning while
maintaining safe generative quality. Experimental results show that our method
significantly impairs the model's ability to re-learn harmful concepts while
maintaining performance on safe content, offering a promising direction for
creating inherently safer generative models resistant to adversarial
fine-tuning attacks.

*Baoshen Guo,Zhiqing Hong,Junyi Li,Shenhao Wang,Jinhua Zhao*

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Cardiff的粗到细级联混合扩散框架，用于生成细粒度且保护隐私的移动轨迹，解决了现有方法无法处理高维复杂分布的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题和数据收集成本高，细粒度移动轨迹难以大规模公开，现有轨迹合成方法无法处理轨迹的复杂结构。

Method: Cardiff框架分为离散路段级和连续GPS级两阶段生成：路段级使用扩散变换器潜在去噪网络，GPS级采用带噪声增强的条件去噪网络。

Result: 在三个真实轨迹数据集上的实验表明，Cardiff在多种指标上优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Cardiff通过级联去噪生成高保真轨迹，并灵活平衡隐私保护与实用性。

Abstract: Urban mobility data has significant connections with economic growth and
plays an essential role in various smart-city applications. However, due to
privacy concerns and substantial data collection costs, fine-grained human
mobility trajectories are difficult to become publicly available on a large
scale. A promising solution to address this issue is trajectory synthesizing.
However, existing works often ignore the inherent structural complexity of
trajectories, unable to handle complicated high-dimensional distributions and
generate realistic fine-grained trajectories. In this paper, we propose
Cardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory
synthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility
generation. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff
decomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road
segment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level,
to reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first
encode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and
design a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level
trajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions,
we then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a
noise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation.
Additionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates
high-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables
a tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility. Experimental
results on three large real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics.

*Osama Hardan,Omar Elshenhabi,Tamer Khattab,Mohamed Mabrok*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文研究了Vision Mamba模型中图像扫描顺序对MRI分割的影响，提出了一种参数无关的模块MS2D，并通过大规模实验验证了扫描顺序的显著性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中，扫描顺序的选择对基于Mamba的模型性能有重要影响，但此前未被系统研究。

Method: 引入MS2D模块，评估21种扫描策略在三个公共数据集上的表现。

Result: 扫描顺序对性能有显著影响（p=0.0016），空间连续的扫描路径表现最佳。

Conclusion: 扫描顺序是无需额外成本的重要超参数，推荐使用空间连续的路径以优化性能。

Abstract: Vision Mamba models promise transformer-level performance at linear
computational cost, but their reliance on serializing 2D images into 1D
sequences introduces a critical, yet overlooked, design choice: the patch scan
order. In medical imaging, where modalities like brain MRI contain strong
anatomical priors, this choice is non-trivial. This paper presents the first
systematic study of how scan order impacts MRI segmentation. We introduce
Multi-Scan 2D (MS2D), a parameter-free module for Mamba-based architectures
that facilitates exploring diverse scan paths without additional computational
cost. We conduct a large-scale benchmark of 21 scan strategies on three public
datasets (BraTS 2020, ISLES 2022, LGG), covering over 70,000 slices. Our
analysis shows conclusively that scan order is a statistically significant
factor (Friedman test: $\chi^{2}_{20}=43.9, p=0.0016$), with performance
varying by as much as 27 Dice points. Spatially contiguous paths -- simple
horizontal and vertical rasters -- consistently outperform disjointed diagonal
scans. We conclude that scan order is a powerful, cost-free hyperparameter, and
provide an evidence-based shortlist of optimal paths to maximize the
performance of Mamba models in medical imaging.

<details>

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized neuroimage analysis by delivering
unprecedented speed and accuracy. However, the narrow scope of many training
datasets constrains model robustness and generalizability. This challenge is
particularly acute in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where image appearance
varies widely across pulse sequences and scanner hardware. A recent
domain-randomization strategy addresses the generalization problem by training
deep neural networks on synthetic images with randomized intensities and
anatomical content. By generating diverse data from anatomical segmentation
maps, the approach enables models to accurately process image types unseen
during training, without retraining or fine-tuning. It has demonstrated
effectiveness across modalities including MRI, computed tomography, positron
emission tomography, and optical coherence tomography, as well as beyond
neuroimaging in ultrasound, electron and fluorescence microscopy, and X-ray
microtomography. This tutorial paper reviews the principles, implementation,
and potential of the synthesis-driven training paradigm. It highlights key
benefits, such as improved generalization and resistance to overfitting, while
discussing trade-offs such as increased computational demands. Finally, the
article explores practical considerations for adopting the technique, aiming to
accelerate the development of generalizable tools that make deep learning more
accessible to domain experts without extensive computational resources or
machine learning knowledge.

TL;DR: BreastSegNet是一种多标签分割算法，用于乳腺MRI，覆盖9种解剖结构，性能优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乳腺MRI分割方法仅关注少数解剖结构，限制了定量分析的实用性。

Method: 提出BreastSegNet，手动标注1123张MRI切片，并比较9种分割模型。

Result: nnU-Net ResEncM表现最佳，平均Dice分数0.694，部分结构分数超过0.73。

Conclusion: BreastSegNet扩展了乳腺MRI分割范围，为定量分析提供更全面的工具。

Abstract: Breast MRI provides high-resolution imaging critical for breast cancer
screening and preoperative staging. However, existing segmentation methods for
breast MRI remain limited in scope, often focusing on only a few anatomical
structures, such as fibroglandular tissue or tumors, and do not cover the full
range of tissues seen in scans. This narrows their utility for quantitative
analysis. In this study, we present BreastSegNet, a multi-label segmentation
algorithm for breast MRI that covers nine anatomical labels: fibroglandular
tissue (FGT), vessel, muscle, bone, lesion, lymph node, heart, liver, and
implant. We manually annotated a large set of 1123 MRI slices capturing these
structures with detailed review and correction from an expert radiologist.
Additionally, we benchmark nine segmentation models, including U-Net, SwinUNet,
UNet++, SAM, MedSAM, and nnU-Net with multiple ResNet-based encoders. Among
them, nnU-Net ResEncM achieves the highest average Dice scores of 0.694 across
all labels. It performs especially well on heart, liver, muscle, FGT, and bone,
with Dice scores exceeding 0.73, and approaching 0.90 for heart and liver. All
model code and weights are publicly available, and we plan to release the data
at a later date.

TL;DR: 通过深度学习模型从3T MRI合成7T MRI，提升图像质量和分割效果，且不影响下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 7T MRI提供更高的分辨率和组织对比度，但可及性较低。研究旨在通过3T MRI合成接近7T质量的图像。

Method: 使用U-Net和GAN U-Net模型，基于172名参与者的配对3T和7T T1加权图像训练。

Result: 合成图像在细节上与真实7T图像相当，主观视觉质量更优，且自动分割效果更接近人工分割。

Conclusion: 合成7T图像可提升图像质量和分割效果，未来可探索临床应用。

Abstract: Ultra-high resolution 7 tesla (7T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides
detailed anatomical views, offering better signal-to-noise ratio, resolution
and tissue contrast than 3T MRI, though at the cost of accessibility. We
present an advanced deep learning model for synthesizing 7T brain MRI from 3T
brain MRI. Paired 7T and 3T T1-weighted images were acquired from 172
participants (124 cognitively unimpaired, 48 impaired) from the Swedish
BioFINDER-2 study. To synthesize 7T MRI from 3T images, we trained two models:
a specialized U-Net, and a U-Net integrated with a generative adversarial
network (GAN U-Net). Our models outperformed two additional state-of-the-art
3T-to-7T models in image-based evaluation metrics. Four blinded MRI
professionals judged our synthetic 7T images as comparable in detail to real 7T
images, and superior in subjective visual quality to 7T images, apparently due
to the reduction of artifacts. Importantly, automated segmentations of the
amygdalae of synthetic GAN U-Net 7T images were more similar to manually
segmented amygdalae (n=20), than automated segmentations from the 3T images
that were used to synthesize the 7T images. Finally, synthetic 7T images showed
similar performance to real 3T images in downstream prediction of cognitive
status using MRI derivatives (n=3,168). In all, we show that synthetic
T1-weighted brain images approaching 7T quality can be generated from 3T
images, which may improve image quality and segmentation, without compromising
performance in downstream tasks. Future directions, possible clinical use
cases, and limitations are discussed.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于参考图像的方法，通过利用高分辨率（HR）参考图像生成尺度感知的退化核，解决了盲超分辨率（BSR）中退化核与缩放因子不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BSR方法直接估计退化核，但忽略了不同超分辨率尺度下退化核的差异。本文旨在通过HR参考图像自适应地识别退化过程，提升超分辨率性能。

Method: 利用内容无关的HR参考图像与目标LR图像，生成尺度感知的退化核，并通过下采样HR参考图像生成额外的LR-HR对，用于训练。

Result: 该方法在训练良好的盲SR模型和零样本盲SR方法中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 结合退化核与缩放因子的双重考虑，以及参考图像的使用，显著提升了盲超分辨率任务的效果。

Abstract: Previous studies in blind super-resolution (BSR) have primarily concentrated
on estimating degradation kernels directly from low-resolution (LR) inputs to
enhance super-resolution. However, these degradation kernels, which model the
transition from a high-resolution (HR) image to its LR version, should account
for not only the degradation process but also the downscaling factor. Applying
the same degradation kernel across varying super-resolution scales may be
impractical. Our research acknowledges degradation kernels and scaling factors
as pivotal elements for the BSR task and introduces a novel strategy that
utilizes HR images as references to establish scale-aware degradation kernels.
By employing content-irrelevant HR reference images alongside the target LR
image, our model adaptively discerns the degradation process. It is then
applied to generate additional LR-HR pairs through down-sampling the HR
reference images, which are keys to improving the SR performance. Our
reference-based training procedure is applicable to proficiently trained blind
SR models and zero-shot blind SR methods, consistently outperforming previous
methods in both scenarios. This dual consideration of blur kernels and scaling
factors, coupled with the use of a reference image, contributes to the
effectiveness of our approach in blind super-resolution tasks.

Abstract: Melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer with rapid progression and high
metastatic potential. Accurate characterisation of tissue morphology in
melanoma is crucial for prognosis and treatment planning. However, manual
segmentation of tissue regions from haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained
whole-slide images (WSIs) is labour-intensive and prone to inter-observer
variability, this motivates the need for reliable automated tissue segmentation
methods. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning network for the
segmentation of five tissue classes in melanoma H&E images. Our approach
leverages Virchow2, a pathology foundation model trained on 3.1 million
histopathology images as a feature extractor. These features are fused with the
original RGB images and subsequently processed by an encoder-decoder
segmentation network (Efficient-UNet) to produce accurate segmentation maps.
The proposed model achieved first place in the tissue segmentation task of the
PUMA Grand Challenge, demonstrating robust performance and generalizability.
Our results show the potential and efficacy of incorporating pathology
foundation models into segmentation networks to accelerate computational
pathology workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督学习方法（如DIP）在计算成本高，限制了其在复杂3D或时间序列成像中的应用。

Method: 引入三种策略：UPWS、TPP和3D-FastResUNet，以加速收敛、增强时间一致性并提高效率。

Result: 在模拟和临床数据上，D2IP显著提升了图像质量（MSSIM提高24.8%，ERR降低8.1%）和计算速度（快7.1倍）。

Conclusion: D2IP在动态肺部成像中展现出巨大潜力，为临床应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised learning methods, such as Deep Image Prior (DIP), have shown
great potential in tomographic imaging due to their training-data-free nature
and high generalization capability. However, their reliance on numerous network
parameter iterations results in high computational costs, limiting their
practical application, particularly in complex 3D or time-sequence tomographic
imaging tasks. To overcome these challenges, we propose Deep Dynamic Image
Prior (D2IP), a novel framework for 3D time-sequence imaging. D2IP introduces
three key strategies - Unsupervised Parameter Warm-Start (UPWS), Temporal
Parameter Propagation (TPP), and a customized lightweight reconstruction
backbone, 3D-FastResUNet - to accelerate convergence, enforce temporal
coherence, and improve computational efficiency. Experimental results on both
simulated and clinical pulmonary datasets demonstrate that D2IP enables fast
and accurate 3D time-sequence Electrical Impedance Tomography (tsEIT)
reconstruction. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, D2IP delivers superior
image quality, with a 24.8% increase in average MSSIM and an 8.1% reduction in
ERR, alongside significantly reduced computational time (7.1x faster),
highlighting its promise for clinical dynamic pulmonary imaging.

Abstract: Accurate classification of computed tomography (CT) images is essential for
diagnosis and treatment planning, but existing methods often struggle with the
subtle and spatially diverse nature of pathological features. Current
approaches typically process images uniformly, limiting their ability to detect
localized abnormalities that require focused analysis. We introduce UGPL, an
uncertainty-guided progressive learning framework that performs a
global-to-local analysis by first identifying regions of diagnostic ambiguity
and then conducting detailed examination of these critical areas. Our approach
employs evidential deep learning to quantify predictive uncertainty, guiding
the extraction of informative patches through a non-maximum suppression
mechanism that maintains spatial diversity. This progressive refinement
strategy, combined with an adaptive fusion mechanism, enables UGPL to integrate
both contextual information and fine-grained details. Experiments across three
CT datasets demonstrate that UGPL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods, achieving improvements of 3.29%, 2.46%, and 8.08% in accuracy for
kidney abnormality, lung cancer, and COVID-19 detection, respectively. Our
analysis shows that the uncertainty-guided component provides substantial
benefits, with performance dramatically increasing when the full progressive
learning pipeline is implemented. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合大语言模型（LLMs）与符号系统的新方法，通过限制领域和结构化提示，生成可验证的Prolog知识表示，以提高专家系统的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽能生成大量信息，但存在幻觉或错误事实的问题，需要一种可控且透明的方法来构建可靠的专家系统。

Method: 采用结构化提示提取方法，将LLMs生成的知识转化为Prolog符号表示，并由人类专家验证和修正。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在事实准确性和语义连贯性上表现优异，结合了LLMs的召回能力和符号系统的精确性。

Conclusion: 该方法为敏感领域的可靠AI应用奠定了基础，实现了可解释性、可扩展性和可靠性。

Abstract: The development of large language models (LLMs) has successfully transformed
knowledge-based systems such as open domain question nswering, which can
automatically produce vast amounts of seemingly coherent information. Yet,
those models have several disadvantages like hallucinations or confident
generation of incorrect or unverifiable facts. In this paper, we introduce a
new approach to the development of expert systems using LLMs in a controlled
and transparent way. By limiting the domain and employing a well-structured
prompt-based extraction approach, we produce a symbolic representation of
knowledge in Prolog, which can be validated and corrected by human experts.
This approach also guarantees interpretability, scalability and reliability of
the developed expert systems. Via quantitative and qualitative experiments with
Claude Sonnet 3.7 and GPT-4.1, we show strong adherence to facts and semantic
coherence on our generated knowledge bases. We present a transparent hybrid
solution that combines the recall capacity of LLMs with the precision of
symbolic systems, thereby laying the foundation for dependable AI applications
in sensitive domains.

TL;DR: DailyLLM是一种基于轻量级LLM的框架，通过整合位置、运动、环境和生理四个维度的上下文信息，显著提升了活动日志生成的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有活动日志生成方法在准确性、效率和语义丰富性方面存在不足，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: DailyLLM采用轻量级LLM框架，结合结构化提示和高效特征提取，实现高级活动理解。

Result: 实验表明，DailyLLM在BERTScore精度上比70B参数的SOTA基线提升17%，推理速度快10倍。

Conclusion: DailyLLM为活动日志生成提供了一种高效且轻量化的解决方案，适用于智能手机和智能手表等设备。

Abstract: Rich and context-aware activity logs facilitate user behavior analysis and
health monitoring, making them a key research focus in ubiquitous computing.
The remarkable semantic understanding and generation capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently created new opportunities for activity log
generation. However, existing methods continue to exhibit notable limitations
in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and semantic richness. To address these
challenges, we propose DailyLLM. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first log generation and summarization system that comprehensively integrates
contextual activity information across four dimensions: location, motion,
environment, and physiology, using only sensors commonly available on
smartphones and smartwatches. To achieve this, DailyLLM introduces a
lightweight LLM-based framework that integrates structured prompting with
efficient feature extraction to enable high-level activity understanding.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DailyLLM outperforms state-of-the-art
(SOTA) log generation methods and can be efficiently deployed on personal
computers and Raspberry Pi. Utilizing only a 1.5B-parameter LLM model, DailyLLM
achieves a 17% improvement in log generation BERTScore precision compared to
the 70B-parameter SOTA baseline, while delivering nearly 10x faster inference
speed.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ADPC的视觉-语言因果干预框架，用于辅助诊断阿尔茨海默病（AD），通过消除混杂因素提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期识别轻度认知障碍（MCI）和AD对延缓痴呆进展至关重要，但现有诊断方法受数据选择偏差和变量复杂关系的干扰。

Method: ADPC结合MRI、fMRI图像和LLM生成的文本数据，通过因果干预消除混杂因素，分类CN/MCI/AD。

Result: 实验表明ADPC在区分CN/MCI/AD上表现优异，达到SOTA指标。

Conclusion: 研究展示了因果推理与多模态学习结合在神经疾病诊断中的潜力。

Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) serves as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer's
Disease (AD), where early identification and intervention can effectively slow
the progression to dementia. However, diagnosing AD remains a significant
challenge in neurology due to the confounders caused mainly by the selection
bias of multimodal data and the complex relationships between variables. To
address these issues, we propose a novel visual-language causal intervention
framework named Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Cross-modal Causal
Intervention (ADPC) for diagnostic assistance. Our ADPC employs large language
model (LLM) to summarize clinical data under strict templates, maintaining
structured text outputs even with incomplete or unevenly distributed datasets.
The ADPC model utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), functional MRI (fMRI)
images and textual data generated by LLM to classify participants into
Cognitively Normal (CN), MCI, and AD categories. Because of the presence of
confounders, such as neuroimaging artifacts and age-related biomarkers,
non-causal models are likely to capture spurious input-output correlations,
generating less reliable results. Our framework implicitly eliminates
confounders through causal intervention. Experimental results demonstrate the
outstanding performance of our method in distinguishing CN/MCI/AD cases,
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) metrics across most evaluation metrics. The
study showcases the potential of integrating causal reasoning with multi-modal
learning for neurological disease diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体运动模拟方法运动逼真度低，无法满足工业任务中对工人行为、安全和生产效率的评估需求。

Method: G-AI-HMS利用大型语言模型将任务描述转化为运动感知语言，并通过计算机视觉和姿态估计算法验证AI生成的运动与实际人类运动的相似性。

Result: 在八项任务中，AI增强的运动在空间准确性、姿态对齐和时间相似性上表现优于人工描述，显著降低了关节误差和时间偏差。

Conclusion: G-AI-HMS显著提升了运动模拟的逼真度，为工业任务提供了更可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: Human motion simulation (HMS) supports cost-effective evaluation of worker
behavior, safety, and productivity in industrial tasks. However, existing
methods often suffer from low motion fidelity. This study introduces
Generative-AI-Enabled HMS (G-AI-HMS), which integrates text-to-text and
text-to-motion models to enhance simulation quality for physical tasks.
G-AI-HMS tackles two key challenges: (1) translating task descriptions into
motion-aware language using Large Language Models aligned with MotionGPT's
training vocabulary, and (2) validating AI-enhanced motions against real human
movements using computer vision. Posture estimation algorithms are applied to
real-time videos to extract joint landmarks, and motion similarity metrics are
used to compare them with AI-enhanced sequences. In a case study involving
eight tasks, the AI-enhanced motions showed lower error than human created
descriptions in most scenarios, performing better in six tasks based on spatial
accuracy, four tasks based on alignment after pose normalization, and seven
tasks based on overall temporal similarity. Statistical analysis showed that
AI-enhanced prompts significantly (p $<$ 0.0001) reduced joint error and
temporal misalignment while retaining comparable posture accuracy.

TL;DR: 研究探讨视觉感知是由外部世界结构还是大脑内部架构塑造的，发现人类和深度神经网络在视觉编码中存在共同的表征轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉感知的驱动因素，验证人类和人工视觉系统是否存在共同的表征原则。

Method: 结合跨被试相似性和模型层次对齐，分析三个独立fMRI数据集，追踪表征流。

Result: 发现一个跨个体保守的皮层网络，分为两条通路：内侧-腹侧流处理场景结构，外侧-背侧流处理社会和生物内容。这一功能组织被视觉DNNs捕捉，但语言模型无法复制。

Conclusion: 人类和人工视觉系统在视觉编码中存在共同的解决方案，由外部世界结构驱动。

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience is what shapes visual
perception: the external world's structure or the brain's internal
architecture. Although some perceptual variability can be traced to individual
differences, brain responses to naturalistic stimuli evoke similar activity
patterns across individuals, suggesting a convergent representational
principle. Here, we test if this stimulus-driven convergence follows a common
trajectory across people and deep neural networks (DNNs) during its
transformation from sensory to high-level internal representations. We
introduce a unified framework that traces representational flow by combining
inter-subject similarity with alignment to model hierarchies. Applying this
framework to three independent fMRI datasets of visual scene perception, we
reveal a cortex-wide network, conserved across individuals, organized into two
pathways: a medial-ventral stream for scene structure and a lateral-dorsal
stream tuned for social and biological content. This functional organization is
captured by the hierarchies of vision DNNs but not language models, reinforcing
the specificity of the visual-to-semantic transformation. These findings show a
convergent computational solution for visual encoding in both human and
artificial vision, driven by the structure of the external world.

TL;DR: DyG-RAG是一种基于动态事件单元（DEUs）的图检索增强生成框架，旨在解决传统方法在时间推理上的不足，通过时间锚点和事件图实现高效的多跳推理和时间敏感查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图检索增强生成方法难以处理时间推理问题，无法建模现实世界事件的结构和顺序变化。

Method: 提出动态事件单元（DEUs）编码语义内容和时间锚点，构建事件图以捕捉时间与因果依赖，并设计时间感知检索和生成策略。

Result: 在时间敏感问答基准测试中，DyG-RAG显著提升了三类时间推理问题的准确率和召回率。

Conclusion: DyG-RAG为时间感知生成提供了更可靠的解决方案，适用于复杂时间敏感任务。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
grounding large language models with external structured knowledge. However,
existing Graph RAG methods struggle with temporal reasoning, due to their
inability to model the evolving structure and order of real-world events. In
this work, we introduce DyG-RAG, a novel event-centric dynamic graph
retrieval-augmented generation framework designed to capture and reason over
temporal knowledge embedded in unstructured text. To eliminate temporal
ambiguity in traditional retrieval units, DyG-RAG proposes Dynamic Event Units
(DEUs) that explicitly encode both semantic content and precise temporal
anchors, enabling accurate and interpretable time-aware retrieval. To capture
temporal and causal dependencies across events, DyG-RAG constructs an event
graph by linking DEUs that share entities and occur close in time, supporting
efficient and meaningful multi-hop reasoning. To ensure temporally consistent
generation, DyG-RAG introduces an event timeline retrieval pipeline that
retrieves event sequences via time-aware traversal, and proposes a Time
Chain-of-Thought strategy for temporally grounded answer generation. This
unified pipeline enables DyG-RAG to retrieve coherent, temporally ordered event
sequences and to answer complex, time-sensitive queries that standard RAG
systems cannot resolve. Extensive experiments on temporal QA benchmarks
demonstrate that DyG-RAG significantly improves the accuracy and recall of
three typical types of temporal reasoning questions, paving the way for more
faithful and temporal-aware generation. DyG-RAG is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物副作用是全球健康问题，现有大型语言模型因黑箱训练数据、幻觉问题和缺乏领域知识，难以在药物警戒中可靠应用。

Method: 提出Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)和GraphRAG架构，将药物副作用知识整合到Llama 3 8B模型中。

Result: 在19,520个药物副作用关联测试中，GraphRAG表现出近乎完美的准确性。

Conclusion: GraphRAG为药物警戒提供了高精度、可扩展的解决方案，是大型语言模型在关键领域应用的重要进展。

Abstract: Drug side effects are a major global health concern, necessitating advanced
methods for their accurate detection and analysis. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) offer promising conversational interfaces, their inherent limitations,
including reliance on black-box training data, susceptibility to
hallucinations, and lack of domain-specific knowledge, hinder their reliability
in specialized fields like pharmacovigilance. To address this gap, we propose
two architectures: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, which
integrate comprehensive drug side effect knowledge into a Llama 3 8B language
model. Through extensive evaluations on 19,520 drug side effect associations
(covering 976 drugs and 3,851 side effect terms), our results demonstrate that
GraphRAG achieves near-perfect accuracy in drug side effect retrieval. This
framework offers a highly accurate and scalable solution, signifying a
significant advancement in leveraging LLMs for critical pharmacovigilance
applications.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法，通过在不同条件下生成SPARQL查询来评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的质量，以衡量其对知识图谱问答（KGQA）的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在训练数据中可能已包含基准或知识图谱，研究者无法控制其影响，因此需要一种方法来评估LLMs在KGQA中的实际能力。

Method: 通过三种条件生成SPARQL查询：（1）零样本生成，（2）知识注入，（3）匿名知识注入，以评估LLMs的表现。

Result: 该方法可移植、鲁棒，适用于任何知识图谱和LLM，能够提供一致的评估结果。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于识别LLMs在KGQA中的实际能力，避免因训练数据包含基准而导致的虚假表现。

Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of software with natural-language user interfaces
cannot be underestimated. In particular, in Question Answering (QA) systems,
generating a SPARQL query for a given natural-language question (often named
Query Building) from the information retrieved from the same question is the
central task of QA systems working over Knowledge Graphs (KGQA). Due to the
rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), they are considered a well-suited method
to increase the quality of the question-answering functionality, as there is
still a lot of room for improvement, aiming for enhanced quality and
trustworthiness. However, LLMs are trained on web data, where researchers have
no control over whether the benchmark or the knowledge graph was already
included in the training data. In this paper, we introduce a novel method that
evaluates the quality of LLMs by generating a SPARQL query from a
natural-language question under various conditions: (1) zero-shot SPARQL
generation, (2) with knowledge injection, and (3) with "anonymized" knowledge
injection. This enables us, for the first time, to estimate the influence of
the training data on the QA quality improved by LLMs. Ultimately, this will
help to identify how portable a method is or whether good results might mostly
be achieved because a benchmark was already included in the training data (cf.
LLM memorization). The developed method is portable, robust, and supports any
knowledge graph; therefore, it could be easily applied to any KGQA or LLM,
s.t., generating consistent insights into the actual LLM capabilities is
possible.

Motivation: 现有体可视化方法依赖复杂预定义规则且风格单一，限制了灵活性和编辑能力。

Method: 采用纹理高斯泼溅框架（TexGS-VolVis），扩展高斯基元以包含纹理和着色属性，并结合图像和文本驱动的非真实感编辑。

Result: 在多种体渲染场景中，TexGS-VolVis在效率、视觉质量和编辑灵活性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TexGS-VolVis为体可视化提供了更灵活、高质量的解决方案，支持实时渲染和精细编辑。

Abstract: Advancements in volume visualization (VolVis) focus on extracting insights
from 3D volumetric data by generating visually compelling renderings that
reveal complex internal structures. Existing VolVis approaches have explored
non-photorealistic rendering techniques to enhance the clarity, expressiveness,
and informativeness of visual communication. While effective, these methods
often rely on complex predefined rules and are limited to transferring a single
style, restricting their flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we
advocate the representation of VolVis scenes using differentiable Gaussian
primitives combined with pretrained large models to enable arbitrary style
transfer and real-time rendering. However, conventional 3D Gaussian primitives
tightly couple geometry and appearance, leading to suboptimal stylization
results. To address this, we introduce TexGS-VolVis, a textured Gaussian
splatting framework for VolVis. TexGS-VolVis employs 2D Gaussian primitives,
extending each Gaussian with additional texture and shading attributes,
resulting in higher-quality, geometry-consistent stylization and enhanced
lighting control during inference. Despite these improvements, achieving
flexible and controllable scene editing remains challenging. To further enhance
stylization, we develop image- and text-driven non-photorealistic scene editing
tailored for TexGS-VolVis and 2D-lift-3D segmentation to enable partial editing
with fine-grained control. We evaluate TexGS-VolVis both qualitatively and
quantitatively across various volume rendering scenes, demonstrating its
superiority over existing methods in terms of efficiency, visual quality, and
editing flexibility.

Abstract: Bio-inspired neural networks are attractive for their adversarial robustness,
energy frugality, and closer alignment with cortical physiology, yet they often
lag behind back-propagation (BP) based models in accuracy and ability to scale.
We show that allowing the use of different bio-inspired learning rules in
different layers, discovered automatically by a tailored
neural-architecture-search (NAS) procedure, bridges this gap. Starting from
standard NAS baselines, we enlarge the search space to include bio-inspired
learning rules and use NAS to find the best architecture and learning rule to
use in each layer. We show that neural networks that use different bio-inspired
learning rules for different layers have better accuracy than those that use a
single rule across all the layers. The resulting NN that uses a mix of
bio-inspired learning rules sets new records for bio-inspired models: 95.16% on
CIFAR-10, 76.48% on CIFAR-100, 43.42% on ImageNet16-120, and 60.51% top-1 on
ImageNet. In some regimes, they even surpass comparable BP-based networks while
retaining their robustness advantages. Our results suggest that layer-wise
diversity in learning rules allows better scalability and accuracy, and
motivates further research on mixing multiple bio-inspired learning rules in
the same network.
