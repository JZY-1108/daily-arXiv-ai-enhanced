### [1] [Benchmarking Open-Source Large Language Models for Persian in Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12807)
*Mahdi Cherakhloo,Arash Abbasi,Mohammad Saeid Sarafraz,Bijan Vosoughi Vahdat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文对多个开源大语言模型在波斯语NLP任务上的表现进行了综合基准测试，发现Gemma 2在几乎所有任务中都表现最佳，但大多数模型在命名实体识别等标记级理解任务上存在困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在多语言任务中表现出色，但在波斯语等低资源语言中的有效性需要深入研究，以填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 使用零样本和少样本学习范式，在情感分析、命名实体识别、阅读理解、问答等任务上评估多个开源LLM，采用ParsiNLU和ArmanEmo等波斯语数据集，使用准确率、F1分数、BLEU和ROUGE等指标进行评估。

Result: Gemma 2在几乎所有任务和两种学习范式中都表现最佳，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现突出；但大多数模型在命名实体识别等标记级理解任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言大语言模型研究提供了波斯语性能的宝贵见解，并为未来模型开发提供了基准参考。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
numerous languages; however, their effectiveness in low-resource languages like
Persian requires thorough investigation. This paper presents a comprehensive
benchmark of several open-source LLMs for Persian Natural Language Processing
(NLP) tasks, utilizing both zero-shot and few-shot learning paradigms. We
evaluate models across a range of tasks including sentiment analysis, named
entity recognition, reading comprehension, and question answering, using
established Persian datasets such as ParsiNLU and ArmanEmo. Our methodology
encompasses rigorous experimental setups for both zero-shot and few-shot
scenarios, employing metrics such as Accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, and ROUGE for
performance evaluation. The results reveal that Gemma 2 consistently
outperforms other models across nearly all tasks in both learning paradigms,
with particularly strong performance in complex reasoning tasks. However, most
models struggle with token-level understanding tasks like Named Entity
Recognition, highlighting specific challenges in Persian language processing.
This study contributes to the growing body of research on multilingual LLMs,
providing valuable insights into their performance in Persian and offering a
benchmark for future model development.

### [2] [Cancer Diagnosis Categorization in Electronic Health Records Using Large Language Models and BioBERT: Model Performance Evaluation Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12813)
*Soheil Hashtarkhani,Rezaur Rashid,Christopher L Brett,Lokesh Chinthala,Fekede Asefa Kumsa,Janet A Zink,Robert L Davis,David L Schwartz,Arash Shaban-Nejad*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了4个大语言模型和BioBERT在从电子健康记录中分类癌症诊断的性能。BioBERT在ICD代码分类中表现最佳，GPT-4o在自由文本诊断分类中表现最好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录包含不一致结构或自由文本数据，需要高效预处理以支持预测性医疗模型。AI驱动的NLP工具在自动化诊断分类方面有潜力，但需要系统评估其性能和临床可靠性。

Method: 使用4个大语言模型（GPT-3.5、GPT-4o、Llama 3.2、Gemini 1.5）和BioBERT，分析762个独特诊断（326个ICD代码描述，436个自由文本条目），将诊断分类到14个预定义类别中，并由两位肿瘤学专家验证分类结果。

Result: BioBERT在ICD代码分类中取得最高加权宏F1分数（84.2），与GPT-4o在ICD代码准确率上持平（90.8）。在自由文本诊断中，GPT-4o在加权宏F1分数（71.8 vs 61.5）和准确率（81.9 vs 81.6）上优于BioBERT。其他模型表现较差。常见错误分类包括转移瘤与中枢神经系统肿瘤混淆，以及涉及模糊或重叠临床术语的错误。

Conclusion: 当前性能水平足以支持行政和研究用途，但可靠的临床应用需要标准化文档实践和强大的人工监督来支持高风险决策。

Abstract: Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text
data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care
models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing
tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative
performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of
this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5,
GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses
from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed
762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code
descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer.
Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined
categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved
the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in
ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT
in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy
(81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on
both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between
metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving
ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance
levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical
applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust
human oversight for high-stakes decision-making.

### [3] [From Noise to Signal to Selbstzweck: Reframing Human Label Variation in the Era of Post-training in NLP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12817)
*Shanshan Xu,Santosh T. Y. S. S,Barbara Plank*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文主张在AI系统设计中应主动保留人类标签变异（HLV）作为体现人类多元性的目标本身，反对将多个标注聚合成单一标签的做法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前偏好学习数据集将多个标注聚合成单一标签，抹杀了人类价值观的多元性，而这正是模型对齐旨在保留的。

Method: 提出在偏好数据集中主动纳入HLV，并概述了实现这一目标的可操作步骤。

Result: 通过保留HLV，可以更好地体现人类价值观的多元性，提升模型对齐的效果。

Conclusion: HLV应被视为设计AI系统的目标本身，需要主动将其纳入偏好数据集以保留人类多元性。

Abstract: Human Label Variation (HLV) refers to legitimate disagreement in annotation
that reflects the genuine diversity of human perspectives rather than mere
error. For decades, HLV in NLP was dismissed as noise to be discarded, and only
slowly over the last decade has it been reframed as a signal for improving
model robustness. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), where
post-training on human feedback has become central to model alignment, the role
of HLV has become increasingly consequential. Yet current preference-learning
datasets routinely aggregate multiple annotations into a single label, thereby
flattening diverse perspectives into a false universal agreement and erasing
precisely the pluralism of human values that alignment aims to preserve. In
this position paper, we argue that preserving HLV as an embodiment of human
pluralism must be treated as a Selbstzweck - a goal it self when designing AI
systems. We call for proactively incorporating HLV into preference datasets and
outline actionable steps towards it.

### [4] [MEDEQUALQA: Evaluating Biases in LLMs with Counterfactual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12818)
*Rajarshi Ghosh,Abhay Gupta,Hudson McBride,Anurag Vaidya,Faisal Mahmood*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MEDEQUALQA是一个用于评估医疗AI中语言模型推理稳定性的反事实基准，通过仅改变患者代词（他/她/他们）来测试模型推理的稳定性，发现虽然整体相似度高，但在风险因素引用、指南锚定和鉴别诊断排序方面存在系统性差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在临床决策支持中应用日益广泛，但先前研究主要关注输出结果的差异，对模型内部推理在人口统计特征变化下的稳定性了解甚少。

Method: 构建MEDEQUALQA基准，通过仅改变患者代词（he/him, she/her, they/them）而保持关键症状和条件不变，生成三个平行数据集（共约69,000项），使用GPT-4.1模型并计算语义文本相似度来评估推理轨迹的稳定性。

Result: 结果显示整体相似度高（平均STS>0.80），但在风险因素引用、指南锚定和鉴别诊断排序方面存在一致的局部差异，即使最终诊断保持不变。

Conclusion: MEDEQUALQA提供了一个受控的诊断环境，用于审计医疗AI中的推理稳定性，揭示了可能影响公平护理的临床相关偏见点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in clinical decision
support, yet subtle demographic cues can influence their reasoning. Prior work
has documented disparities in outputs across patient groups, but little is
known about how internal reasoning shifts under controlled demographic changes.
We introduce MEDEQUALQA, a counterfactual benchmark that perturbs only patient
pronouns (he/him, she/her, they/them) while holding critical symptoms and
conditions (CSCs) constant. Each clinical vignette is expanded into single-CSC
ablations, producing three parallel datasets of approximately 23,000 items each
(69,000 total). We evaluate a GPT-4.1 model and compute Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS) between reasoning traces to measure stability across pronoun
variants. Our results show overall high similarity (mean STS >0.80), but reveal
consistent localized divergences in cited risk factors, guideline anchors, and
differential ordering, even when final diagnoses remain unchanged. Our error
analysis highlights certain cases in which the reasoning shifts, underscoring
clinically relevant bias loci that may cascade into inequitable care.
MEDEQUALQA offers a controlled diagnostic setting for auditing reasoning
stability in medical AI.

### [5] [Classifier-Augmented Generation for Structured Workflow Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12825)
*Thomas Gschwind,Shramona Chakraborty,Nitin Gupta,Sameep Mehta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个将自然语言描述转换为可执行ETL工作流的系统，使用分类器增强生成(CAG)方法自动预测工作流结构和详细配置


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ETL工具如IBM DataStage需要深度工具知识和耗时配置，希望通过自然语言简化工作流创建过程

Method: 采用分类器增强生成(CAG)方法，结合话语分解、分类器和特定阶段的少样本提示来准确预测阶段，然后通过边预测连接成非线性工作流，并从子话语上下文推断阶段属性

Result: 相比单一提示和代理基线，CAG方法在准确性和效率上都有提升，同时显著减少token使用量

Conclusion: 该系统是首个在自然语言驱动ETL创作中，对阶段预测、边布局和属性生成进行全面评估的系统，具有模块化、可解释性和端到端工作流生成能力

Abstract: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools such as IBM DataStage allow users to
visually assemble complex data workflows, but configuring stages and their
properties remains time consuming and requires deep tool knowledge. We propose
a system that translates natural language descriptions into executable
workflows, automatically predicting both the structure and detailed
configuration of the flow. At its core lies a Classifier-Augmented Generation
(CAG) approach that combines utterance decomposition with a classifier and
stage-specific few-shot prompting to produce accurate stage predictions. These
stages are then connected into non-linear workflows using edge prediction, and
stage properties are inferred from sub-utterance context. We compare CAG
against strong single-prompt and agentic baselines, showing improved accuracy
and efficiency, while substantially reducing token usage. Our architecture is
modular, interpretable, and capable of end-to-end workflow generation,
including robust validation steps. To our knowledge, this is the first system
with a detailed evaluation across stage prediction, edge layout, and property
generation for natural-language-driven ETL authoring.

### [6] [Scheming Ability in LLM-to-LLM Strategic Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12826)
*Thao Pham*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了前沿LLM代理在游戏理论框架下的战略欺骗能力，发现即使没有明确提示，模型也表现出显著的欺骗倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM代理在多样化环境中自主部署，评估其战略欺骗能力变得至关重要，而LLM之间的欺骗行为研究尚不充分。

Method: 使用廉价谈话信号游戏和同行评估对抗游戏两个游戏理论框架，测试四个模型（GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5-pro、Claude-3.7-Sonnet和Llama-3.3-70b），通过思维链推理分析欺骗策略。

Result: 在提示下，大多数模型特别是Gemini-2.5-pro和Claude-3.7-Sonnet达到接近完美的表现。未提示时，所有模型在同行评估中都选择欺骗而非坦白（100%），廉价谈话中选择欺骗的模型成功率高达95-100%。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了在多智能体环境中使用高风险游戏理论场景进行稳健评估的必要性。

Abstract: As large language model (LLM) agents are deployed autonomously in diverse
contexts, evaluating their capacity for strategic deception becomes crucial.
While recent research has examined how AI systems scheme against human
developers, LLM-to-LLM scheming remains underexplored. We investigate the
scheming ability and propensity of frontier LLM agents through two
game-theoretic frameworks: a Cheap Talk signaling game and a Peer Evaluation
adversarial game. Testing four models (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-pro,
Claude-3.7-Sonnet, and Llama-3.3-70b), we measure scheming performance with and
without explicit prompting while analyzing scheming tactics through
chain-of-thought reasoning. When prompted, most models, especially
Gemini-2.5-pro and Claude-3.7-Sonnet, achieved near-perfect performance.
Critically, models exhibited significant scheming propensity without prompting:
all models chose deception over confession in Peer Evaluation (100% rate),
while models choosing to scheme in Cheap Talk succeeded at 95-100% rates. These
findings highlight the need for robust evaluations using high-stakes
game-theoretic scenarios in multi-agent settings.

*Hieu Le Duc,Leo Liberti*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatGPT使用多实例协作协议成功解决了5/6的2025年IMO问题和1/3的数论猜想，并通过Lean证明助手和人工验证确保证明正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证大型语言模型在定理证明方面的能力，特别是在解决国际数学奥林匹克竞赛问题和数论猜想方面的表现。

Method: 采用多个gpt-5模型实例协作的协议，包括证明者和验证者角色，最终通过Lean证明助手进行形式化验证，并由人工确认前提和结论的一致性。

Result: 成功解决了2025年IMO六道问题中的五道，并在66个数论猜想中解决了约三分之一。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了大型语言模型在定理证明方面的强大潜力，通过协作协议和形式化验证可以有效避免幻觉问题。

Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of
large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to
do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International
Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman & Karbasi,
arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the
artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem
proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover
and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure
that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is
formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises
and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology was
able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close a third of the
sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences,
2025].

### [8] [MTSQL-R1: Towards Long-Horizon Multi-Turn Text-to-SQL via Agentic Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12831)
*Taicheng Guo,Hai Wang,ChaoChun Liu,Mohsen Golalikhani,Xin Chen,Xiangliang Zhang,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MTSQL-R1是一个基于强化学习的多轮Text-to-SQL训练框架，通过执行反馈和对话记忆验证来实现迭代式的查询生成、验证和优化循环。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统将多轮Text-to-SQL视为简单的文本翻译任务，采用短视范式逐轮生成查询而不进行执行验证，导致输出不可执行或不连贯。

Method: 将任务建模为马尔可夫决策过程，智能体与数据库交互获取执行反馈，利用持久对话记忆进行连贯性验证，执行"提议→执行→验证→优化"的迭代循环。

Result: 在COSQL和SPARC数据集上的实验表明，MTSQL-R1持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 环境驱动的验证和记忆引导的优化对于对话式语义解析至关重要，完整代码和模型将在内部评审后发布。

Abstract: Multi-turn Text-to-SQL aims to translate a user's conversational utterances
into executable SQL while preserving dialogue coherence and grounding to the
target schema. However, most existing systems only regard this task as a simple
text translation task and follow a short-horizon paradigm, generating a query
per turn without execution, explicit verification, and refinement, which leads
to non-executable or incoherent outputs. We present MTSQL-R1, an agentic
training framework for long-horizon multi-turn Text-to-SQL. We cast the task as
a Markov Decision Process (MDP) in which an agent interacts with (i) a database
for execution feedback and (ii) a persistent dialogue memory for coherence
verification, performing an iterative propose to execute -> verify -> refine
cycle until all checks pass. Experiments on COSQL and SPARC demonstrate that
MTSQL-R1 consistently outperforms strong baselines, highlighting the importance
of environment-driven verification and memory-guided refinement for
conversational semantic parsing. Full recipes (including code, trained models,
logs, reasoning trajectories, etc.) will be released after the internal review
to contribute to community research.

*Kon Woo Kim,Rezarta Islamaj,Jin-Dong Kim,Florian Boudin,Akiko Aizawa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索如何将现有标注指南重新用于指导大语言模型进行文本标注任务，提出基于LLM调节的指南重构方法，并在NCBI疾病语料库上验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标注指南是为人类标注者设计的，而LLM需要明确的结构化指令。本研究旨在解决如何将人类标注指南转化为适合LLM使用的指令格式。

Method: 提出基于调节的指南重构方法，通过LLM调节过程将传统指南转化为清晰指令，使用NCBI疾病语料库作为案例研究。

Result: 实验表明重构后的指南能有效指导LLM标注者，同时揭示了若干实际挑战，证明了该方法在扩展性和成本效益方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法支持可扩展且成本效益高的标注指南精炼和自动化标注，为LLM在文本标注任务中的应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This study investigates how existing annotation guidelines can be repurposed
to instruct large language model (LLM) annotators for text annotation tasks.
Traditional guidelines are written for human annotators who internalize
training, while LLMs require explicit, structured instructions. We propose a
moderation-oriented guideline repurposing method that transforms guidelines
into clear directives for LLMs through an LLM moderation process. Using the
NCBI Disease Corpus as a case study, our experiments show that repurposed
guidelines can effectively guide LLM annotators, while revealing several
practical challenges. The results highlight the potential of this workflow to
support scalable and cost-effective refinement of annotation guidelines and
automated annotation.

*Qianben Chen,Jingyi Cao,Jiayu Zhang,Tianrui Qin,Xiaowan Li,King Zhu,Dingfeng Shi,He Zhu,Minghao Liu,Xiaobo Liang,Ge Zhang,Jian Yang,Yuchen Eleanor Jiang,Wangchunshu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了自适应代理基础模型(A²FM)，通过路由-对齐原则统一推理型和代理型LLM，引入即时模式处理简单查询，显著提升成本效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推理型LLM和代理型LLM之间的能力分裂问题，避免在简单查询上过度推理或过度调用工具导致的效率低下

Method: 采用路由-对齐原则：先学习任务感知路由，然后在共享骨干网络下对齐模式特定轨迹；引入即时模式；提出自适应策略优化(APO)进行多模式采样和成本正则化奖励

Result: 在32B规模上，BrowseComp达到13.4%，AIME25达到70.4%，HLE达到16.7%，创下可比模型新SOTA；自适应执行每正确答案成本仅$0.00487，相比推理模式节省45.2%，相比代理模式节省33.5%

Conclusion: A²FM成功统一了推理和代理能力，在保持准确性的同时显著提升了成本效率，为LLM的实际部署提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models split into two families: reasoning-centric LLMs, which
strengthen internal chain-of-thought reasoning but cannot invoke external
tools, and agentic LLMs, which learn to interact with environments and leverage
tools but often lag in deep reasoning. This divide arises from fundamentally
different training objectives, leading to mismatched strengths and inefficiency
on simple queries, where both families tend to overthink or over-call tools. In
this work, we present Adaptive Agent Foundation Model (A\textsuperscript{2}FM),
a unified framework that follows a route-then-align principle: the model first
learns task-aware routing and then aligns mode-specific trajectories under a
shared backbone. To address the inefficiency gap, we introduce a third
mode-instant-that handles simple queries directly, preventing unnecessary
reasoning or tool calls while complementing the agentic and reasoning modes. To
jointly enhance accuracy and efficiency, we propose Adaptive Policy
Optimization (APO), which enforces adaptive sampling across modes and applies a
cost-regularized reward. On the 32B scale, A\textsuperscript{2}FM achieves
13.4\% on BrowseComp, 70.4\% on AIME25, and 16.7\% on HLE, setting new SOTA
among comparable models and performing competitively with frontier LLMs across
agentic, reasoning, and general benchmarks. Notably, the adaptive execution
achieves a cost of pass of only \$0.00487 per correct answer-cutting cost by
45.2\% relative to reasoning and 33.5\% relative to agentic, thus delivering
substantially higher cost efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了FastFact框架，通过分块级声明提取和基于置信度的预验证，结合文档级证据收集，高效评估长文本生成的事实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法评估LLM长文本生成事实性存在效率低下和证据不足的问题，需要更快速准确的评估框架。

Method: 采用分块级声明提取与置信度预验证，收集文档级证据并选择性检索，减少网络搜索和推理调用成本。

Result: 在聚合的人工标注基准测试中，FastFact在效率和有效性方面均优于现有基线，与人工评估对齐度最高。

Conclusion: FastFact框架能够高效可靠地评估长文本LLM生成的事实性，解决了现有方法的效率和证据不足问题。

Abstract: Evaluating the factuality of long-form generations from Large Language Models
(LLMs) remains challenging due to accuracy issues and costly human assessment.
Prior efforts attempt this by decomposing text into claims, searching for
evidence, and verifying claims, but suffer from critical drawbacks: (1)
inefficiency due to complex pipeline components unsuitable for long LLM
outputs, and (2) ineffectiveness stemming from inaccurate claim sets and
insufficient evidence collection of one-line snippets.
  To address these limitations, we propose \name, a fast and strong evaluation
framework that achieves the highest alignment with human evaluation and
efficiency among existing baselines. \name first employs chunk-level claim
extraction integrated with confidence-based pre-verification, significantly
reducing the cost of web searching and inference calling while ensuring
reliability. For searching and verification, it collects document-level
evidence from crawled webpages and selectively retrieves it during
verification, addressing the evidence insufficiency problem in previous
pipelines.
  Extensive experiments based on an aggregated and manually annotated benchmark
demonstrate the reliability of \name in both efficiently and effectively
evaluating the factuality of long-form LLM generations. Code and benchmark data
is available at https://github.com/Yingjia-Wan/FastFact.

*Jesse Atuhurra,Iqra Ali,Tomoya Iwakura,Hidetaka Kamigaito,Tatsuya Hiraoka*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VLURes是一个新的多语言基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在英语、日语、斯瓦希里语和乌尔都语四种语言下的细粒度视觉和语言理解能力，包含八个任务和一个创新性无关性任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型的评估主要局限于英语为中心的基准测试，且图像-文本对通常包含短文本。需要评估模型在多语言、长文本设置下的细粒度能力。

Method: 从目标语言的网络资源中策划数据集，涵盖十个不同的图像类别和丰富的文本上下文。通过提示VLMs生成响应和理由，进行自动评估和母语人士评估。

Result: 评估了十个VLMs，表现最好的GPT-4o模型总体准确率达到90.8%，但仍比人类表现低6.7%。开源模型与人类表现的差距更大。

Conclusion: VLURes在开发智能代理处理多模态视觉推理方面发挥着关键作用，揭示了不同语言和任务之间的性能差异。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are pivotal for advancing perception in
intelligent agents. Yet, evaluation of VLMs remains limited to predominantly
English-centric benchmarks in which the image-text pairs comprise short texts.
To evaluate VLM fine-grained abilities, in four languages under long-text
settings, we introduce a novel multilingual benchmark VLURes featuring eight
vision-and-language tasks, and a pioneering unrelatedness task, to probe the
fine-grained Visual and Linguistic Understanding capabilities of VLMs across
English, Japanese, and low-resource languages, Swahili, and Urdu. Our datasets,
curated from web resources in the target language, encompass ten diverse image
categories and rich textual context, introducing valuable vision-language
resources for Swahili and Urdu. By prompting VLMs to generate responses and
rationales, evaluated automatically and by native speakers, we uncover
performance disparities across languages and tasks critical to intelligent
agents, such as object recognition, scene understanding, and relationship
understanding. We conducted evaluations of ten VLMs with VLURes. The best
performing model, GPT-4o, achieves an overall accuracy of 90.8% and lags human
performance by 6.7%, though the gap is larger for open-source models. The gap
highlights VLURes' critical role in developing intelligent agents to tackle
multi-modal visual reasoning.

*Jan Miller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EAT框架将三种自适应效率技术（渐进式token剪枝、稀疏注意力和动态提前退出）统一到一个可复现架构中，用于输入自适应推理，并提供了开源基准测试管道。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个统一的自适应效率框架，结合多种技术来优化transformer模型在延迟敏感NLP任务中的推理效率。

Method: 将渐进式token剪枝、稀疏注意力和动态提前退出三种技术集成到单一架构中，通过开源基准测试管道在GLUE任务上进行自动化评估。

Result: 在浅层六层模型中组合这些机制可能增加延迟，但在SST-2任务上EAT比优化的DistilBERT基线实现了略高的准确率。

Conclusion: EAT框架展示了动态计算在延迟敏感NLP中的潜力，主要贡献是提供了一个开放、端到端可复现的社区工具用于进一步研究自适应transformer。

Abstract: The Efficient Adaptive Transformer (EAT) framework unifies three adaptive
efficiency techniques - progressive token pruning, sparse attention, and
dynamic early exiting - into a single, reproducible architecture for
input-adaptive inference. EAT provides an open-source benchmarking pipeline
that automates data processing, timing, and ablation across GLUE tasks (SST-2,
QQP, MNLI). Although this empirical study finds that combining these mechanisms
can increase latency in shallow six-layer models, it demonstrates that EAT
achieves slightly higher accuracy than the optimized DistilBERT baseline on
SST-2, illustrating the potential of dynamic computation for latency-sensitive
NLP. The main contribution is the open, end-to-end reproducible framework -
complete with scripts, CSV logging, and analysis utilities - intended to serve
as a community tool for further research on adaptive transformers.

Motivation: 古兰经诵读教学面临现代挑战，现有数字工具未能有效解决教学需求，存在数据依赖、人口偏见等问题。

Method: 通过综合分析过去20年的学术研究、网络平台和商业应用，批判现有数据驱动方法，提出基于规则的知识中心计算框架。

Result: 发现现有ASR方法优先词汇识别而非音质评估，无法提供诊断性反馈，需要转向基于发音点和规则的前瞻性声学建模。

Conclusion: 未来古兰经自动评估应发展混合系统，整合深层语言知识与先进音频分析，提供稳健、公平且教学有效的工具。

Abstract: The sacred practice of Quranic recitation (Tajweed), governed by precise
phonetic, prosodic, and theological rules, faces significant pedagogical
challenges in the modern era. While digital technologies promise unprecedented
access to education, automated tools for recitation evaluation have failed to
achieve widespread adoption or pedagogical efficacy. This literature review
investigates this critical gap, conducting a comprehensive analysis of academic
research, web platforms, and commercial applications developed over the past
two decades. Our synthesis reveals a fundamental misalignment in prevailing
approaches that repurpose Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) architectures,
which prioritize lexical recognition over qualitative acoustic assessment and
are plagued by data dependency, demographic biases, and an inability to provide
diagnostically useful feedback. Critiquing these data--driven paradigms, we
argue for a foundational paradigm shift towards a knowledge-centric
computational framework. Capitalizing on the immutable nature of the Quranic
text and the precisely defined rules of Tajweed, we propose that a robust
evaluator must be architected around anticipatory acoustic modeling based on
canonical rules and articulation points (Makhraj), rather than relying on
statistical patterns learned from imperfect and biased datasets. This review
concludes that the future of automated Quranic evaluation lies in hybrid
systems that integrate deep linguistic knowledge with advanced audio analysis,
offering a path toward robust, equitable, and pedagogically sound tools that
can faithfully support learners worldwide.

*Shouang Wei,Min Zhang,Xin Lin,Bo Jiang,Zhongxiang Dai,Kun Kuang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了EduDial——一个全面的多轮师生对话数据集，包含34,250个对话会话，覆盖345个核心知识点，基于布鲁姆教育目标分类学设计，并开发了EduDial-LLM 32B模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在教育领域的应用日益重要，需要专门的师生对话基准来评估其教学能力，现有基准无法充分捕捉真实课堂互动。

Method: 构建EduDial数据集，基于布鲁姆教育目标分类学，包含10种提问策略，为不同认知水平学生设计差异化教学策略，并训练EduDial-LLM 32B模型。

Result: 实验显示大多数主流LLM在学生中心教学场景中表现不佳，而EduDial-LLM在所有指标上均显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: EduDial为评估LLM教学能力提供了全面基准，EduDial-LLM在师生对话任务中表现出色，推动了智能教育的发展。

Abstract: Recently, several multi-turn dialogue benchmarks have been proposed to
evaluate the conversational abilities of large language models (LLMs). As LLMs
are increasingly recognized as a key technology for advancing intelligent
education, owing to their ability to deeply understand instructional contexts
and provide personalized guidance, the construction of dedicated
teacher-student dialogue benchmarks has become particularly important. To this
end, we present EduDial, a comprehensive multi-turn teacher-student dialogue
dataset. EduDial covers 345 core knowledge points and consists of 34,250
dialogue sessions generated through interactions between teacher and student
agents. Its design is guided by Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives and
incorporates ten questioning strategies, including situational questioning,
zone of proximal development (ZPD) questioning, and metacognitive
questioning-thus better capturing authentic classroom interactions.
Furthermore, we design differentiated teaching strategies for students at
different cognitive levels, thereby providing more targeted teaching guidance.
Building on EduDial, we further develop EduDial-LLM 32B via training and
propose an 11-dimensional evaluation framework that systematically measures the
teaching abilities of LLMs, encompassing both overall teaching quality and
content quality. Experiments on 17 mainstream LLMs reveal that most models
struggle in student-centered teaching scenarios, whereas our EduDial-LLM
achieves significant gains, consistently outperforming all baselines across all
metrics. The code is available at

*Nil-Jana Akpinar,Chia-Jung Lee,Vanessa Murdock,Pietro Perona*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了大型语言模型对查询人物角色的鲁棒性，发现用户个人属性信息会显著影响问答准确性并触发多种失败模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型应该基于客观知识如实回答事实性问题，而不应受用户个人背景信息的影响。现有研究主要关注对抗性输入或干扰因素，但缺乏对真实用户交互中常见个人属性影响的系统评估。

Method: 通过评估模型对查询人物角色（如身份、专业知识、信仰等用户属性）的响应，分析这些人类中心化提示如何影响问答表现。

Result: 研究发现用户个人属性提示会显著改变问答准确性，并触发拒绝回答、产生幻觉限制和角色混淆等失败模式。

Conclusion: 模型对用户框架的敏感性会损害事实可靠性，查询人物角色测试可作为有效的鲁棒性评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) should answer factual questions truthfully,
grounded in objective knowledge, regardless of user context such as
self-disclosed personal information, or system personalization. In this paper,
we present the first systematic evaluation of LLM robustness to inquiry
personas, i.e. user profiles that convey attributes like identity, expertise,
or belief. While prior work has primarily focused on adversarial inputs or
distractors for robustness testing, we evaluate plausible, human-centered
inquiry persona cues that users disclose in real-world interactions. We find
that such cues can meaningfully alter QA accuracy and trigger failure modes
such as refusals, hallucinated limitations, and role confusion. These effects
highlight how model sensitivity to user framing can compromise factual
reliability, and position inquiry persona testing as an effective tool for
robustness evaluation.

TL;DR: 本文研究了LLMs在不同文化背景下的好奇心表现，发现LLMs倾向于西方文化的好奇心表达方式，并提出了微调策略来改善跨文化对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在人类互动中扮演重要角色，但好奇心这一核心驱动力在不同文化背景下的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用Yahoo! Answers多国数据集，构建CUEST评估框架，通过语言风格、话题偏好分析和社会科学构建来测量人机对齐。

Result: 发现LLMs会削弱跨文化多样性，更接近西方国家的表达方式；通过微调策略可将人机对齐差距缩小50%。

Conclusion: 好奇心对LLMs的跨文化适应性具有重要价值，是未来NLP研究的关键方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded their role in
human interaction, yet curiosity -- a central driver of inquiry -- remains
underexplored in these systems, particularly across cultural contexts. In this
work, we investigate cultural variation in curiosity using Yahoo! Answers, a
real-world multi-country dataset spanning diverse topics. We introduce CUEST
(CUriosity Evaluation across SocieTies), an evaluation framework that measures
human-model alignment in curiosity through linguistic (style), topic preference
(content) analysis and grounding insights in social science constructs. Across
open- and closed-source models, we find that LLMs flatten cross-cultural
diversity, aligning more closely with how curiosity is expressed in Western
countries. We then explore fine-tuning strategies to induce curiosity in LLMs,
narrowing the human-model alignment gap by up to 50\%. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical value of curiosity for LLM adaptability across cultures, showing
its importance for future NLP research.

### [18] [3-Model Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12966)
*Sanghyun Byun,Mohanad Odema,Jung Ick Guack,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD) 通过在草稿模型和目标模型之间插入一个中间限定模型来改进推测解码，使用更小的草稿模型实现更高的接受率和吞吐量，在消费级GPU上达到124 tokens/秒的生成速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码存在草稿模型大小与token接受率之间的权衡：较小的草稿模型生成更快但与目标模型差异更大，导致接受率降低和加速效果受限。

Method: 引入中间限定模型来弥合草稿模型和目标模型之间的分布差距，采用分层解码策略和模糊接受标准，支持每个阶段的宽松发散阈值。

Result: PyramidSD相比标准推测解码实现了最高1.91倍的生成加速，在RTX 4090上达到124 tokens/秒，在1B草稿模型和8B目标模型的小内存设置中，以最小质量损失换取吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: PyramidSD提供了一种实用的方法来提高推测解码效率，可以轻松应用于现有的推理流水线。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates inference in large language models by
using a smaller draft model to propose tokens, which are then verified by a
larger target model. However, the throughput gains of SD are fundamentally
limited by a trade-off between draft model size and token acceptance: smaller
draft models generate tokens more quickly but exhibit greater divergence from
the target model, resulting in lower acceptance rates and reduced speedups. We
introduce Pyramid Speculative Decoding (PyramidSD), an extension of SD that
inserts an intermediate qualifier model between the draft and target to bridge
the distributional gap in output predictions, allowing smaller model to be used
for drafting. This hierarchical decoding strategy improves alignment across
models, enabling higher acceptance rates and allowing the use of significantly
smaller draft models without sacrificing overall performance. PyramidSD builds
on fuzzy acceptance criteria to support relaxed divergence thresholds at each
stage, improving throughput. In experiments, PyramidSD achieves up to 1.91x
generation speed over standard SD, reaching 124 tokens per second on a consumer
GPU (RTX 4090). In small-memory settings with a 1B-parameter draft model and an
8B target model, PyramidSD minimally trades target model quality for improved
throughput. Overall, PyramidSD offers a practical approach to enhancing
speculative decoding efficiency and can be readily applied to existing
inference pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次大规模评估LLM生成针对特定人口属性个性化虚假信息的能力，发现简单个性化策略会显著增加所有LLM的越狱概率，并改变语言模式增强说服力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在生成类人内容方面日益熟练，对其可能被滥用于大规模生成有说服力的个性化虚假信息存在担忧。虽然之前研究已证明LLM能生成虚假信息，但在说服力和个性化方面的具体问题仍未充分研究。

Method: 采用红队测试方法，系统评估LLM安全机制对个性化提示的鲁棒性。创建AI-TRAITS数据集，包含约160万条文本，由8个最先进LLM生成，基于324个虚假信息叙事和150个不同人物画像，覆盖4种主要语言和关键人口维度。

Result: 研究发现：1）即使简单的个性化策略也会显著增加所有LLM的越狱概率；2）个性化提示会导致语言和修辞模式改变；3）个性化增强了LLM生成虚假叙事的说服力。

Conclusion: 这些发现暴露了当前最先进LLM的关键漏洞，为改进多语言和跨人口背景下的安全对齐和检测策略提供了基础。

Abstract: The human-like proficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought
concerns about their potential misuse for generating persuasive and
personalised disinformation at scale. While prior work has demonstrated that
LLMs can generate disinformation, specific questions around persuasiveness and
personalisation (generation of disinformation tailored to specific demographic
attributes) remain largely unstudied. This paper presents the first
large-scale, multilingual empirical study on persona-targeted disinformation
generation by LLMs. Employing a red teaming methodology, we systematically
evaluate the robustness of LLM safety mechanisms to persona-targeted prompts. A
key novel result is AI-TRAITS (AI-generaTed peRsonAlIsed disinformaTion
dataSet), a new dataset of around 1.6 million texts generated by eight
state-of-the-art LLMs. AI-TRAITS is seeded by prompts that combine 324
disinformation narratives and 150 distinct persona profiles, covering four
major languages (English, Russian, Portuguese, Hindi) and key demographic
dimensions (country, generation, political orientation). The resulting
personalised narratives are then assessed quantitatively and compared along the
dimensions of models, languages, jailbreaking rate, and personalisation
attributes. Our findings demonstrate that the use of even simple
personalisation strategies in the prompts significantly increases the
likelihood of jailbreaks for all studied LLMs. Furthermore, personalised
prompts result in altered linguistic and rhetorical patterns and amplify the
persuasiveness of the LLM-generated false narratives. These insights expose
critical vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art LLMs and offer a
foundation for improving safety alignment and detection strategies in
multilingual and cross-demographic contexts.

*Yifeng Xiong,Xiaohui Xie*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OPLoRA通过双面正交投影防止LoRA微调中的灾难性遗忘，保留预训练知识的关键奇异方向，同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在微调大语言模型时存在灾难性遗忘问题，学习到的更新会干扰编码预训练知识的主导奇异方向。

Method: 通过SVD分解冻结权重，使用投影矩阵P_L = I - U_k U_k^T和P_R = I - V_k V_k^T将LoRA更新约束在top-k奇异子空间的正交补空间中。

Result: 实验证明OPLoRA显著减少遗忘，同时在常识推理、数学和代码生成任务上保持竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 正交投影是参数高效微调中知识保护的有效机制，为知识保留提供数学保证。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large language
models but suffers from catastrophic forgetting when learned updates interfere
with the dominant singular directions that encode essential pre-trained
knowledge. We propose Orthogonal Projection LoRA (OPLoRA), a theoretically
grounded approach that prevents this interference through double-sided
orthogonal projections. By decomposing frozen weights via SVD, OPLoRA
constrains LoRA updates to lie entirely within the orthogonal complement of the
top-$k$ singular subspace using projections $P_L = I - U_k U_k^\top$ and $P_R =
I - V_k V_k^\top$. We prove that this construction exactly preserves the
top-$k$ singular triples, providing mathematical guarantees for knowledge
retention. To quantify subspace interference, we introduce $\rho_k$, a metric
measuring update alignment with dominant directions. Extensive experiments
across commonsense reasoning, mathematics, and code generation demonstrate that
OPLoRA significantly reduces forgetting while maintaining competitive
task-specific performance on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen2.5 7B, establishing orthogonal
projection as an effective mechanism for knowledge preservation in
parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

TL;DR: CurlL是一个基于人类5-10岁发展轨迹的持续学习数据集和基准，包含五个发展阶段，通过技能图谱将广泛技能分解为具体能力和可测量指标，生成234亿token的合成数据集来评估模型逐步获取新技能的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前持续学习评估缺乏对人类发展轨迹的模拟，需要系统性和细粒度的方法来评估模型逐步获取新技能的能力，特别是技能依赖关系对学习过程的影响。

Method: 构建涵盖5-10岁五个发展阶段的技能图谱，生成包含段落、理解性QA、技能测试QA和指令-响应对的234亿token合成数据集，使用1.35亿参数transformer在独立、联合和顺序（持续）设置下进行训练。

Result: 展示了技能保留和迁移效率之间的权衡，能够精确分析遗忘、前向迁移和后向迁移现象，验证了数据集在评估持续学习性能方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过模拟人类学习模式并提供对技能依赖关系的细粒度控制，这项工作推进了语言模型的持续学习评估方法。

Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive continual learning dataset and benchmark (CurlL)
grounded in human developmental trajectories from ages 5-10, enabling
systematic and fine-grained assessment of models' ability to progressively
acquire new skills. CurlL spans five developmental stages (0-4) covering ages
5-10, supported by a skill graph that breaks down broad skills into smaller
abilities, concrete goals, and measurable indicators, while also capturing
which abilities build on others. We generate a 23.4B-token synthetic dataset
with controlled skill progression, vocabulary complexity, and format diversity,
comprising paragraphs, comprehension-based QA (CQA), skill-testing QA (CSQA),
and instruction-response (IR) pairs. Stage-wise token counts range from 2.12B
to 6.78B tokens, supporting precise analysis of forgetting, forward transfer,
and backward transfer. Using a 135M-parameter transformer trained under
independent, joint, and sequential (continual) setups, we show trade-offs in
skill retention and transfer efficiency. By mirroring human learning patterns
and providing fine-grained control over skill dependencies, this work advances
continual learning evaluations for language models.

TL;DR: 本文研究了偏好方差(PVar)对直接偏好优化(DPO)训练效果的影响，发现高PVar的提示能产生更大的梯度更新，从而提高模型对齐效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 收集人类偏好数据成本高且效率低，需要减少所需标注的方法。偏好方差可能影响DPO训练效果。

Method: 通过理论分析建立DPO梯度范数的上界，证明其受PVar控制；使用奖励模型生成偏好数据，在AlpacaEval 2.0和Arena-Hard基准上评估；验证小奖励模型(1B, 3B)选择的有效性；在UltraFeedback数据集上测试人类标注。

Result: 高PVar提示优于随机选择或低PVar提示；仅使用前10%高PVar提示训练比使用完整数据集表现更好；PVar选择方法对小奖励模型鲁棒。

Conclusion: 偏好方差是识别信息丰富示例的重要指标，可用于高效LLM对齐，显著减少所需训练数据量。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as an important approach for
learning from human preferences in aligning large language models (LLMs).
However, collecting human preference data is costly and inefficient, motivating
methods to reduce the required annotations. In this work, we investigate the
impact of \emph{preference variance} (PVar), which measures the variance in
model preferences when comparing pairs of responses, on the effectiveness of
DPO training. We provide a theoretical insight by establishing an upper bound
on the DPO gradient norm for any given prompt, showing it is controlled by the
PVar of that prompt. This implies that prompts with low PVar can only produce
small gradient updates, making them less valuable for learning. We validate
this finding by fine-tuning LLMs with preferences generated by a reward model,
evaluating on two benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 and Arena-Hard). Experimental
results demonstrate that prompts with higher PVar outperform randomly selected
prompts or those with lower PVar. We also show that our PVar-based selection
method is robust, when using smaller reward models (1B, 3B) for selection.
Notably, in a separate experiment using the original human annotations from the
UltraFeedback dataset, we found that training on only the top 10\% of prompts
with the highest PVar yields better evaluation performance than training on the
full dataset, highlighting the importance of preference variance in identifying
informative examples for efficient LLM alignment.

TL;DR: GatePro是一种无需参数的MoE专家选择多样性提升方法，通过识别最相似专家对并引入局部竞争机制，避免冗余专家同时激活，提升模型有效容量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE架构中功能相似的专家经常被同时选择，导致计算冗余和有效模型容量受限，而现有的平衡损失方法无法解决专家多样性问题。

Method: 提出GatePro方法，识别最相似专家对并引入局部竞争机制，防止冗余专家共同激活，同时保持专家自然专业化，无需额外可学习参数。

Result: 综合评估表明GatePro在不同模型规模和基准测试中均有效，能够实现增强的专家多样性，专家发展出更独特和互补的能力。

Conclusion: GatePro可在任何训练阶段热插拔部署，无需额外参数，为提升MoE有效性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Modern large language models leverage Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
for efficient scaling, but face a critical challenge: functionally similar
experts are often selected simultaneously, creating redundant computation and
limiting effective model capacity. Existing auxiliary balance loss methods
improve token distribution but fail to address the underlying expert diversity
problem. We introduce GatePro, a novel parameter-free method that directly
promotes expert selection diversity. GatePro identifies the most similar expert
pairs and introduces localized competition mechanisms, preventing redundant
expert co-activation while maintaining natural expert specialization. Our
comprehensive evaluation demonstrates GatePro's effectiveness across model
scales and benchmarks. Analysis demonstrates GatePro's ability to achieve
enhanced expert diversity, where experts develop more distinct and
complementary capabilities, avoiding functional redundancy. This approach can
be deployed hot-swappable during any training phase without additional
learnable parameters, offering a practical solution for improving MoE
effectiveness.

Motivation: 大语言模型的不确定性量化具有挑战性，现有方法难以有效衡量模型可靠性。

Result: 在多种LLM和问答数据集上的实验表明，该方法在有效性和计算效率方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM不确定性量化提供了新的因果视角，能够有效估计认知不确定性，且计算高效。

Abstract: Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a promising approach to improve model
reliability, yet quantifying the uncertainty of Large Language Models (LLMs) is
non-trivial. In this work, we establish a connection between the uncertainty of
LLMs and their invariance under semantic-preserving intervention from a causal
perspective. Building on this foundation, we propose a novel grey-box
uncertainty quantification method that measures the variation in model outputs
before and after the semantic-preserving intervention. Through theoretical
justification, we show that our method provides an effective estimate of
epistemic uncertainty. Our extensive experiments, conducted across various LLMs
and a variety of question-answering (QA) datasets, demonstrate that our method
excels not only in terms of effectiveness but also in computational efficiency.

Motivation: 临床试验对于医学进步至关重要，但需要包含具有适当和多样化医疗背景的参与者。自动化临床文本分析可以改进临床试验资格评估过程。

Method: 结合词嵌入（Word2Vec）、命名实体识别、计数向量化和TF-IDF等特征提取方法，使用加权TF-IDF词嵌入整合基于计数和嵌入的优势，应用随机森林和SVM进行多标签分类，评估TextRank、Luhn和GPT-3等摘要技术。

Abstract: Clinical trials are central to medical progress because they help improve
understanding of human health and the healthcare system. They play a key role
in discovering new ways to detect, prevent, or treat diseases, and it is
essential that clinical trials include participants with appropriate and
diverse medical backgrounds. In this paper, we propose a system that leverages
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate
multi-label clinical text eligibility classification and summarization. The
system combines feature extraction methods such as word embeddings (Word2Vec)
and named entity recognition to identify relevant medical concepts, along with
traditional vectorization techniques such as count vectorization and TF-IDF
(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency). We further explore weighted TF-IDF
word embeddings that integrate both count-based and embedding-based strengths
to capture term importance effectively. Multi-label classification using Random
Forest and SVM models is applied to categorize documents based on eligibility
criteria. Summarization techniques including TextRank, Luhn, and GPT-3 are
evaluated to concisely summarize eligibility requirements. Evaluation with
ROUGE scores demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods. This
system shows potential for automating clinical trial eligibility assessment
using data-driven approaches, thereby improving research efficiency.

Motivation: 当前一击LLM预测的准确性和鲁棒性对示例选择和集成成员多样性高度敏感，需要系统研究如何优化这两个关键因素。

Method: 比较两种一击策略：基于质心的代表性示例（提出方法）和随机采样示例（基线），同时调整采样温度参数来控制系统多样性。

Result: 提出的方法在较高温度设置下显著优于随机选择：宏F1提升+7.6%，RMSE降低-10.5%；同时超越5击提示：宏F1提升+21.1%，RMSE降低-24.0%。

Conclusion: 结合代表性示例选择与增加温度能为集成提供适当的多样性水平，强调了示例选择和受控多样性在设计有效一击LLM集成中的实际重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results in wide range
of domains. However, the accuracy and robustness of one-shot LLM predictions
remain highly sensitive to the examples and the diversity among ensemble
members. This study systematically investigates the effects of example
representativeness (one-shot strategy) and output diversity (sampling
temperature) on LLM ensemble performance. Two one-shot strategies are compared:
centroid-based representative examples (proposed) and randomly sampled examples
(baseline) and sampling temperature also is varied. The proposed approach with
higher temperature setting significantly outperforms random selection by +7.6%
(macro-F1) and -10.5% (RMSE). Furthermore, the proposed model exceeds 5-shot
prompting by +21.1% (macro-F1) and -24.0% (RMSE). Our findings demonstrate that
combining representative example selection with increased temperature provides
the appropriate level of diversity to the ensemble. This work highlights the
practical importance of both example selection and controlled diversity in
designing effective one-shot LLM ensembles.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中东和北非地区在当前AI评估中代表性不足，需要专门的基准来评估LLMs与该地区文化价值观的对齐程度。

Method: 基于大规模人类调查数据构建结构化数据集，在三种视角框架（中性、个性化、文化观察者）和两种语言模式（英语和本地语言）下评估多种模型。

Result: 发现跨语言价值偏移、推理导致的文化对齐恶化、logit泄露等关键现象，模型在本地语言中会将多样国家简化为单一实体。

Conclusion: MENAValues为诊断文化错位提供了可扩展框架，为开发更具文化包容性的AI提供了实证见解和方法工具。

Abstract: We introduce MENAValues, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the cultural
alignment and multilingual biases of large language models (LLMs) with respect
to the beliefs and values of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, an
underrepresented area in current AI evaluation efforts. Drawing from
large-scale, authoritative human surveys, we curate a structured dataset that
captures the sociocultural landscape of MENA with population-level response
distributions from 16 countries. To probe LLM behavior, we evaluate diverse
models across multiple conditions formed by crossing three perspective framings
(neutral, personalized, and third-person/cultural observer) with two language
modes (English and localized native languages: Arabic, Persian, Turkish). Our
analysis reveals three critical phenomena: "Cross-Lingual Value Shifts" where
identical questions yield drastically different responses based on language,
"Reasoning-Induced Degradation" where prompting models to explain their
reasoning worsens cultural alignment, and "Logit Leakage" where models refuse
sensitive questions while internal probabilities reveal strong hidden
preferences. We further demonstrate that models collapse into simplistic
linguistic categories when operating in native languages, treating diverse
nations as monolithic entities. MENAValues offers a scalable framework for
diagnosing cultural misalignment, providing both empirical insights and
methodological tools for developing more culturally inclusive AI.

TL;DR: Mirror-SD是一种突破延迟-接受率权衡的推理算法，通过并行异构执行和多令牌推测流式处理，在保持高接受率的同时显著降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码方法在增加草稿大小时会提高接受率但引入额外延迟，现有方法（Medusa、Hydra、EAGLE）要么降低接受率要么引入限制扩展的开销。

Method: 使用分支完整展开与目标模型后缀并行执行，在异构加速器（GPU和NPU）上映射计算以利用跨设备并行性，同时添加推测流式处理使草稿每步发射多个令牌。

Result: 在SpecBench上，从14B到66B参数的服务器规模模型中，Mirror-SD实现了2.8x-5.8x的端到端加速，比最强基线EAGLE3平均相对提升30%。

Conclusion: 并行异构执行加多令牌推测流式处理的双重策略将推测解码推向高接受率低开销的理想状态。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates LLM inference by using a draft model to look
ahead, but gains are capped by the cost of autoregressive draft generation:
increasing draft size elevates acceptance rates but introduces additional
latency overhead exacerbating the speed-accuracy tradeoff. Prior methods
(Medusa, Hydra, EAGLE) partially reduce draft cost but either degrade
acceptance or introduce overheads that limit scaling. We present Mirror
Speculative Decoding (Mirror-SD), an inference algorithm that breaks the
latency-acceptance tradeoff. Mirror-SD launches branch-complete rollouts from
early-exit signals in parallel with the target model's suffix and explicitly
maps computation across heterogeneous accelerators (GPU and NPU) to exploit
cross-device parallelism. The draft speculates forward continuations for the
target to verify, while the target simultaneously speculates correction paths
for the draft, converting speculation into two complementary execution
pipelines. To further cut draft latency without weakening acceptance semantics,
we add speculative streaming so the draft emits multiple tokens per step. This
dual strategy of parallel heterogeneous execution plus multi-token speculative
streaming pushes speculative decoding toward its ideal regime of high
acceptance with low overhead. On SpecBench with server-scale models from 14B to
66B parameters, Mirror-SD delivers consistent end-to-end gains, achieving
2.8x-5.8x wall-time speedups across diverse tasks and a 30% average relative
improvement over the strongest baseline, EAGLE3.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出并评估了用于图结构抽象代码生成的JSON表示方法，在基于Scratch的测试基准上验证了LLM能够单次生成图结构代码，且不同表示方法对准确率有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM擅长生成原始顺序代码，但在图结构抽象代码生成方面研究较少。这种能力对可视化编程语言和无法访问源代码的场景很重要。

Method: 提出并评估多种JSON图表示方法，在基于Python重实现的Scratch测试基准ScratchTest上进行实验。

Result: LLM能够在单次推理中完成图结构代码生成，无需复杂流程。不同表示方法导致准确率显著差异，证明了表示方法在此任务中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 这项工作为图结构抽象代码生成的表示学习奠定了基础，展示了LLM在此领域的潜力。

Abstract: Most large language models (LLMs) today excel at generating raw, sequential
code with minimal abstractions and custom structures. However, there has been
little work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is
encapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges.
This is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw
source code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we
propose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy
graph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on
ScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of
Scratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space. Our findings demonstrate that
LLMs can indeed perform the aforementioned generation task in a single pass
without relying on specialized or complex pipelines, given the correct graph
representations. We also show that different representations induce
significantly different accuracies, highlighting the instrumental role of
representations in this generation task. All in all, this work establishes the
first steps towards representation learning for graph-based abstract code
generation.

TL;DR: CoT-Evo是一个进化式思维链蒸馏框架，通过构建多样化的推理轨迹池、自动检索领域知识，并基于新颖性选择、反思性重组和变异进行迭代优化，生成高质量的科学推理数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链蒸馏在科学领域效果不佳，因为即使是先进的大语言模型也经常产生错误或肤浅的推理。直接蒸馏这些有缺陷的输出会导致低质量训练数据，限制学生模型的性能。

Method: 1. 从多个LLM构建多样化推理轨迹池 2. 自动检索领域知识进行丰富 3. 使用新颖性选择、反思性重组和变异进行迭代优化 4. 基于答案正确性、连贯性和知识利用效率的适应度函数指导优化

Result: 生成的进化数据集用于微调紧凑模型，在科学推理基准测试中达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作建立了一个可扩展的方法，从多样化和易出错的大语言模型中合成高保真度的科学推理数据。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation from advanced large language models
(LLMs) has proven effective in general reasoning tasks, it struggles in
scientific domains where even advanced models often produce incorrect or
superficial reasoning due to high complexity and specialized knowledge
requirements. Directly distilling from such flawed outputs results in
low-quality training data and limits the performance of smaller student models.
To overcome this, we propose CoT-Evo, an evolutionary CoT distillation
framework. It begins by constructing a diverse pool of reasoning trajectories
from multiple LLM thinkers, enriches them with automatically retrieved domain
knowledge, and iteratively refines the trajectories using novelty-driven
selection, reflective recombination and mutation. The refinement is guided by a
fitness function that evaluates answer correctness, coherence, and effective
knowledge utilization. This results in a high-quality CoT dataset tailored for
scientific reasoning. We employ this evolved dataset to fine-tune a compact
model, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on scientific reasoning
benchmarks. Our work establishes a scalable approach to synthesizing
high-fidelity scientific reasoning data from diverse and fallible LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有关于CoT微调的调查主要关注技术层面，而忽视了从人类推理机制角度的系统分析。鉴于CoT微调的最终目标是让LLM像人类一样推理，从人类认知角度研究这一技术至关重要。

Method: 受著名的六顶思考帽框架启发，该框架使用六种隐喻帽子系统化表征常见的人类思维模式，作者通过这一视角对CoT微调方法进行分类和检验。

Result: 提供了现有数据集和模型性能的全面概述，并维护了一个实时GitHub仓库持续跟踪该领域的最新进展。

Conclusion: 希望这项调查能够成为有价值的资源，激发这一快速发展领域的创新和进步。

Abstract: Chain of thought (CoT) fine-tuning aims to endow large language models (LLMs)
with reasoning capabilities by training them on curated reasoning traces. It
leverages both supervised and reinforced fine-tuning to cultivate human-like
reasoning skills in LLMs, including detailed planning, divergent thinking,
intuitive judgment, timely reflection, internal thinking, and fact perception,
etc. As CoT fine-tuning has advanced, LLMs have demonstrated substantial
improvements in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code generation.
However, existing surveys about CoT fine-tuning primarily focus on technical
aspects and overlook a systematic analysis from the perspective of human
reasoning mechanisms. Given that the ultimate goal of CoT fine-tuning is to
enable LLMs to reason like humans, it is crucial to investigate this technique
through the lens of human cognition. To fill this gap, we present the first
comprehensive survey of CoT fine-tuning grounded in human reasoning theory.
Specifically, inspired by the well-known Six Thinking Hats framework, which
systematically characterizes common human thinking modes using six metaphorical
hats, we classify and examine CoT fine-tuning methods through this lens.
Furthermore, building upon this theory, we outline potential directions for
future research in CoT fine-tuning. In addition, we compile a comprehensive
overview of existing datasets and model performances, and a real-time GitHub
repository \footnote{https://github.com/AI-Chen/Awesome-CoT-Finetuning} that
continuously tracks recent advances in this area is maintained. We hope this
survey will serve as a valuable resource to inspire innovation and foster
progress in this rapidly evolving field.

TL;DR: 提出DSCD方法，通过自约束解码实现大语言模型去毒，无需参数微调，在保持生成流畅性的同时有效降低毒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解码去毒方法依赖外部约束，需要额外资源且损失生成流畅性，需要更轻量高效的解决方案

Method: DSCD方法在输出生成时加强安全层的内部下一个token分布，同时削弱幻觉和毒性层的分布

Result: 在代表性开源LLM和公共数据集上的实验验证了DSCD的有效性，在去毒和生成流畅性方面达到SOTA性能

Conclusion: DSCD具有轻量、高兼容性和即插即用能力，是实用且可扩展的安全LLM部署解决方案

Abstract: Detoxification in large language models (LLMs) remains a significant research
challenge. Existing decoding detoxification methods are all based on external
constraints, which require additional resource overhead and lose generation
fluency. This work proposes Detoxification with Self-Constrained Decoding
(DSCD), a novel method for LLM detoxification without parameter fine-tuning.
DSCD strengthens the inner next-token distribution of the safety layer while
weakening that of hallucination and toxic layers during output generation. This
effectively diminishes toxicity and enhances output safety. DSCD offers
lightweight, high compatibility, and plug-and-play capabilities, readily
integrating with existing detoxification methods for further performance
improvement. Extensive experiments on representative open-source LLMs and
public datasets validate DSCD's effectiveness, demonstrating state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance in both detoxification and generation fluency, with superior
efficiency compared to existing methods. These results highlight DSCD's
potential as a practical and scalable solution for safer LLM deployments.

TL;DR: SHIELD是一个轻量级、模型无关的预处理框架，通过细粒度安全分类和类别特定指导来防御LVLMs对抗性攻击，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型虽然具备强大的多模态推理能力，但也扩大了攻击面，特别是通过将有害目标隐藏在良性提示中的对抗性输入。

Method: SHIELD结合细粒度安全分类与类别特定指导，采用明确的操作（阻止、重构、转发），通过定制安全提示强制执行细微拒绝或安全重定向。

Result: 在五个基准测试和五个代表性LVLMs上，SHIELD持续降低越狱和不遵循率，同时保持实用性，具有可忽略的开销。

Conclusion: SHIELD作为一个即插即用的实用安全补丁，适用于弱对齐和强对齐的LVLMs，且易于扩展到新的攻击类型。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) unlock powerful multimodal reasoning but
also expand the attack surface, particularly through adversarial inputs that
conceal harmful goals in benign prompts. We propose SHIELD, a lightweight,
model-agnostic preprocessing framework that couples fine-grained safety
classification with category-specific guidance and explicit actions (Block,
Reframe, Forward). Unlike binary moderators, SHIELD composes tailored safety
prompts that enforce nuanced refusals or safe redirection without retraining.
Across five benchmarks and five representative LVLMs, SHIELD consistently
lowers jailbreak and non-following rates while preserving utility. Our method
is plug-and-play, incurs negligible overhead, and is easily extendable to new
attack types -- serving as a practical safety patch for both weakly and
strongly aligned LVLMs.

TL;DR: 本文研究发现RAG系统中检索文档的格式框架（如分隔符、结构标记等）对模型性能有显著影响，提出了上下文归一化策略来标准化上下文表示，提升RAG的鲁棒性和长上下文利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG研究主要关注检索质量和提示策略，而检索文档的上下文格式如何影响模型性能尚未得到充分探索。作者发现即使是表面上的格式选择也会导致准确性和稳定性的显著变化。

Method: 设计了控制实验来变化上下文密度、分隔符风格和位置布局，揭示性能差异的底层因素。基于这些洞察，提出了上下文归一化策略，在生成前自适应地标准化上下文表示。

Result: 在受控和真实世界RAG基准测试上的广泛实验表明，所提策略能持续提升对顺序变化的鲁棒性，并增强长上下文利用能力。

Conclusion: 可靠的RAG不仅依赖于检索正确的内容，还取决于内容的呈现方式。该研究提供了新的实证证据和实用技术，以改善长上下文推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an essential approach for
extending the reasoning and knowledge capacity of large language models (LLMs).
While prior research has primarily focused on retrieval quality and prompting
strategies, the influence of how the retrieved documents are framed, i.e.,
context format, remains underexplored. We show that seemingly superficial
choices, such as delimiters or structural markers in key-value extraction, can
induce substantial shifts in accuracy and stability, even when semantic content
is identical. To systematically investigate this effect, we design controlled
experiments that vary context density, delimiter styles, and positional
placement, revealing the underlying factors that govern performance
differences. Building on these insights, we introduce Contextual Normalization,
a lightweight strategy that adaptively standardizes context representations
before generation. Extensive experiments on both controlled and real-world RAG
benchmarks across diverse settings demonstrate that the proposed strategy
consistently improves robustness to order variation and strengthens
long-context utilization. These findings underscore that reliable RAG depends
not only on retrieving the right content, but also on how that content is
presented, offering both new empirical evidence and a practical technique for
better long-context reasoning.

Motivation: 解决语音翻译中重音信息丢失的问题，强调韵律在翻译中的重要性，为S2ST中副语言线索的保留提供有效解决方案。

Method: 利用LLM进行跨语言重音转换，开发自动生成对齐训练数据的流程，引入"LLM-as-Judge"评估方法，使用可控TTS模型。

Result: 在保留重音方面显著优于基线方法，同时保持可比的翻译质量、说话者意图和自然度。

Conclusion: 该工作突出了韵律在翻译中的重要性，为S2ST中副语言线索的保留提供了有效且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a stress-aware speech-to-speech translation (S2ST) system that
preserves word-level emphasis by leveraging LLMs for cross-lingual emphasis
conversion. Our method translates source-language stress into target-language
tags that guide a controllable TTS model. To overcome data scarcity, we
developed a pipeline to automatically generate aligned training data and
introduce the "LLM-as-Judge" for evaluation. Experiments show our approach
substantially outperforms baselines in preserving emphasis while maintaining

highlights the importance of prosody in translation and provides an effective,
data-efficient solution for preserving paralinguistic cues in S2ST.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型生成的高维密集嵌入在文本异常检测中面临的内存需求大和计算时间长的挑战。

Method: 使用简化解离核(SIK)进行边界聚焦的特征映射，将高维密集嵌入转换为低维稀疏表示，同时保持关键的异常特征。

Result: 在7个数据集上的实验表明，SIK在检测性能上优于11种最先进的异常检测算法，同时保持计算效率和低内存成本。

Conclusion: SIK方法有效解决了高维嵌入带来的计算和内存问题，在文本异常检测中实现了更好的性能与效率平衡。

Abstract: Two-step approaches combining pre-trained large language model embeddings and
anomaly detectors demonstrate strong performance in text anomaly detection by
leveraging rich semantic representations. However, high-dimensional dense
embeddings extracted by large language models pose challenges due to
substantial memory requirements and high computation time. To address this
challenge, we introduce the Simplified Isolation Kernel (SIK), which maps
high-dimensional dense embeddings to lower-dimensional sparse representations
while preserving crucial anomaly characteristics. SIK has linear time
complexity and significantly reduces space complexity through its innovative
boundary-focused feature mapping. Experiments across 7 datasets demonstrate
that SIK achieves better detection performance than 11 state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection algorithms while maintaining computational efficiency and low
memory cost. All code and demonstrations are available at

TL;DR: 提出LLM引导的合成增强方法，使用大语言模型为代表性不足群体生成反事实示例，在保持标签完整性的同时减少AI系统的性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统中的偏见引发伦理和实践问题，传统公平方法依赖受保护属性标签、涉及准确性与公平性权衡，且难以跨数据集泛化。

Method: 使用结构化提示生成性别互换的改写句子，通过语义相似性检查、属性验证、毒性筛查和人工抽查进行质量控制，扩展训练数据覆盖范围。

Result: 基线模型准确率96.7%，性别偏见差距7.2%；简单互换增强将差距降至0.7%但准确率降至95.6%；LGSA实现99.1%准确率，偏见差距1.9%，改善了女性标签示例的性能。

Conclusion: LGSA是有效的偏见缓解策略，能在保持高任务准确性和标签保真度的同时增强子群体平衡。

Abstract: Bias in AI systems, especially those relying on natural language data, raises
ethical and practical concerns. Underrepresentation of certain groups often
leads to uneven performance across demographics. Traditional fairness methods,
such as pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing, depend on
protected-attribute labels, involve accuracy-fairness trade-offs, and may not
generalize across datasets. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Guided
Synthetic Augmentation (LGSA), which uses large language models to generate
counterfactual examples for underrepresented groups while preserving label
integrity. We evaluated LGSA on a controlled dataset of short English sentences
with gendered pronouns, professions, and binary classification labels.
Structured prompts were used to produce gender-swapped paraphrases, followed by
quality control including semantic similarity checks, attribute verification,
toxicity screening, and human spot checks. The augmented dataset expanded
training coverage and was used to train a classifier under consistent
conditions. Results show that LGSA reduces performance disparities without
compromising accuracy. The baseline model achieved 96.7 percent accuracy with a
7.2 percent gender bias gap. Simple swap augmentation reduced the gap to 0.7
percent but lowered accuracy to 95.6 percent. LGSA achieved 99.1 percent
accuracy with a 1.9 percent bias gap, improving performance on female-labeled
examples. These findings demonstrate that LGSA is an effective strategy for
bias mitigation, enhancing subgroup balance while maintaining high task
accuracy and label fidelity.

Motivation: 探索LLMs是否使用类似人类大脑的机制来处理句法结构，以及LLMs行为能力的计算模块来源。

Method: 使用分层频率标记探针(HFTP)进行频域分析，识别LLMs神经元和大脑皮层区域编码句法结构的组件，并进行表征相似性分析。

Result: LLMs在类似层级处理句法，而人脑依赖不同皮层区域；LLMs表征与大脑左半球更相似；升级模型与大脑对齐度呈现不同趋势。

Conclusion: HFTP是连接计算语言学和认知神经科学的有价值工具，揭示了LLMs行为改进的机制是否类人化的问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level or even superior
language abilities, effectively modeling syntactic structures, yet the specific
computational modules responsible remain unclear. A key question is whether LLM
behavioral capabilities stem from mechanisms akin to those in the human brain.
To address these questions, we introduce the Hierarchical Frequency Tagging
Probe (HFTP), a tool that utilizes frequency-domain analysis to identify
neuron-wise components of LLMs (e.g., individual Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
neurons) and cortical regions (via intracranial recordings) encoding syntactic
structures. Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama
2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human
brain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels.
Representational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM
representations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language
processing). Notably, upgraded models exhibit divergent trends: Gemma 2 shows
greater brain similarity than Gemma, while Llama 3.1 shows less alignment with
the brain compared to Llama 2. These findings offer new insights into the
interpretability of LLM behavioral improvements, raising questions about
whether these advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like
mechanisms, and establish HFTP as a valuable tool bridging computational
linguistics and cognitive neuroscience. This project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在需要抽象推理的任务上仍有根本性弱点，特别是涉及网格、符号或视觉模式等与自然语言训练数据不同表示形式的任务。

Method: 引入Concept单词猜谜棋盘游戏作为基准，该游戏使用更接近LLM预训练数据的自然语言表示，并在多种语言（英语、荷兰语、法语、西班牙语）中评估LLM表现。

Result: 人类成功率超过90%，而最先进的LLM成功率不超过40%。LLM在低资源语言中表现进一步下降，难以理解玩家战略意图和根据序列信息更新修正假设。

Conclusion: Concept游戏揭示了LLM在溯因推理方面的显著局限性，特别是在理解战略意图和动态信息更新方面，且多语言评估表明语言资源差异会加剧这些弱点。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved striking successes on many
benchmarks, yet recent studies continue to expose fundamental weaknesses. In
particular, tasks that require abstract reasoning remain challenging, often
because they use representations such as grids, symbols, or visual patterns
that differ from the natural language data LLMs are trained on. In this paper,
we introduce Concept, a simple word-guessing board game, as a benchmark for
probing abductive reasoning in a representation that is much closer to LLM
pre-training data: natural language. Our results show that this game, easily
solved by humans (with a success rate of over 90\%), is still very challenging
for state-of-the-art LLMs (no model exceeds 40\% success rate). Specifically,
we observe that LLMs struggle with interpreting other players' strategic
intents, and with correcting initial hypotheses given sequential information
updates. In addition, we extend the evaluation across multiple languages, and
find that the LLM performance drops further in lower-resource languages (Dutch,
French, and Spanish) compared to English.

Motivation: 现有基于强化学习的搜索代理方法虽然提升了问答基准测试的性能，但往往忽视中间推理步骤的质量，可能导致思维链不忠实的问题。

Method: 提出VERITAS框架，在强化学习过程中整合细粒度的忠实性奖励，包括信息-思维忠实性、思维-答案忠实性和思维-搜索忠实性三个维度的评估指标。

Conclusion: VERITAS框架有效解决了RL搜索代理的推理忠实性问题，为构建更可靠的检索增强生成系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: Inspired by the success of reinforcement learning (RL) in Large Language
Model (LLM) training for domains like math and code, recent works have begun
exploring how to train LLMs to use search engines more effectively as tools for
retrieval-augmented generation. Although these methods achieve performance
improvement across QA benchmarks, many prioritize final answer correctness
while overlooking the quality of intermediate reasoning steps, which may lead
to chain-of-thought unfaithfulness. In this paper, we first introduce a
comprehensive evaluation framework for evaluating RL-based search agents,
covering three distinct faithfulness metrics: information-think faithfulness,
think-answer faithfulness, and think-search faithfulness. Our evaluations
reveal that a prototypical RL-based search agent, Search-R1, has significant
room for improvement in this regard. To foster faithful reasoning, we introduce
VERITAS (Verifying Entailed Reasoning through Intermediate Traceability in
Agentic Search), a novel framework that integrates fine-grained faithfulness
rewards into the reinforcement learning process. Our experiments show that
models trained with VERITAS not only significantly improve reasoning
faithfulness, but also achieve comparable task performance across seven QA
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有激活引导方法使用固定引导强度，导致要么控制不足，要么过度干预破坏文本的合理性和连贯性。

Method: IDS方法基于输入数据在表示空间中的分布动态调整引导强度，根据输入与分布的距离自适应干预，确保文本生成的稳定性。

Result: 实验表明IDS在分类任务上达到高准确率，同时生成连贯文本而不会崩溃，特别适合实际应用。

Conclusion: IDS通过自适应引导强度实现了更好的控制效果和文本质量，为实际应用提供了有效的激活引导解决方案。

Abstract: Activation steering methods control large language model (LLM) behavior by
modifying internal activations at inference time. However, most existing
activation steering methods rely on a fixed steering strength, leading to
either insufficient control or unadapted intervention that degrades text
plausibility and coherence. We introduce In-Distribution Steering (IDS), a
novel method that adapts steering strength based on the input data distribution
in representation space. IDS dynamically adjusts interventions according to how
far a given input lies within the distribution, enabling adaptive intervention
and generation stability during text generation. Experiments demonstrate that
IDS achieves strong accuracy on classification tasks while producing coherent
text without collapse, making IDS particularly well suited for real-world
applications.

Abstract: Enhancing customer experience is essential for business success, particularly
as service demands grow in scale and complexity. Generative artificial
intelligence and Large Language Models (LLMs) have empowered intelligent
interaction systems to deliver efficient, personalized, and 24/7 support. In
practice, intelligent interaction systems encounter several challenges: (1)
Constructing high-quality data for cold-start training is difficult, hindering
self-evolution and raising labor costs. (2) Multi-turn dialogue performance
remains suboptimal due to inadequate intent understanding, rule compliance, and
solution extraction. (3) Frequent evolution of business rules affects system
operability and transferability, constraining low-cost expansion and
adaptability. (4) Reliance on a single LLM is insufficient in complex
scenarios, where the absence of multi-agent frameworks and effective
collaboration undermines process completeness and service quality. (5) The
open-domain nature of multi-turn dialogues, lacking unified golden answers,
hampers quantitative evaluation and continuous optimization. To address these
challenges, we introduce WOWService, an intelligent interaction system tailored
for industrial applications. With the integration of LLMs and multi-agent
architectures, WOWService enables autonomous task management and collaborative
problem-solving. Specifically, WOWService focuses on core modules including
data construction, general capability enhancement, business scenario
adaptation, multi-agent coordination, and automated evaluation. Currently,
WOWService is deployed on the Meituan App, achieving significant gains in key
metrics, e.g., User Satisfaction Metric 1 (USM 1) -27.53% and User Satisfaction
Metric 2 (USM 2) +25.51%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing user
needs and advancing personalized service.

### [44] [Mismatch Aware Guidance for Robust Emotion Control in Auto-Regressive TTS Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13293)
*Yizhou Peng,Yukun Ma,Chong Zhang,Yi-Wen Chao,Chongjia Ni,Bin Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对自回归TTS模型中风格提示与文本内容不匹配的问题，提出了一种自适应CFG方案，通过LLM或NLI模型检测不匹配程度并相应调整CFG，在保持音频质量和可懂度的同时提升了情感表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TTS系统虽然可以通过自然语言提示实现细粒度的情感控制，但当期望情感（风格提示）与文本语义内容冲突时，会产生不自然的语音，这阻碍了细粒度情感控制的实现。CFG技术虽然能增强提示对齐，但在自回归TTS模型中的应用研究不足，可能导致音频质量下降。

Method: 提出自适应CFG方案，使用大语言模型或自然语言推理模型检测风格-内容不匹配程度，并根据检测到的不匹配水平自适应调整CFG参数。该方法基于对CFG在先进自回归TTS模型中情感表达影响的综合分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的自适应CFG方案在保持音频质量和可懂度的同时，显著提升了自回归TTS模型的情感表达能力。

Conclusion: 该研究成功解决了自回归TTS模型中风格-内容不匹配的问题，通过自适应CFG方案实现了更好的情感控制，同时确保了合成语音的自然度和质量。

Abstract: While Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems can achieve fine-grained control over
emotional expression via natural language prompts, a significant challenge
emerges when the desired emotion (style prompt) conflicts with the semantic
content of the text. This mismatch often results in unnatural-sounding speech,
undermining the goal of achieving fine-grained emotional control.
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a key technique for enhancing prompt
alignment; however, its application to auto-regressive (AR) TTS models remains
underexplored, which can lead to degraded audio quality. This paper directly
addresses the challenge of style-content mismatch in AR TTS models by proposing
an adaptive CFG scheme that adjusts to different levels of the detected
mismatch, as measured using large language models or natural language inference
models. This solution is based on a comprehensive analysis of CFG's impact on
emotional expressiveness in state-of-the-art AR TTS models. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed adaptive CFG scheme improves the emotional
expressiveness of the AR TTS model while maintaining audio quality and
intelligibility.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于LLM预训练和上下文学习能力的新型无监督方法，利用LLM的对数概率来衡量文本间的风格可转移性，在控制主题相关性时优于对比训练基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算风格分析方法依赖带有虚假相关性的数据，容易混淆风格与主题。现代LLM的CLM预训练在通用作者身份问题中应用不足。

Method: 利用LLM的预训练和上下文学习能力，通过LLM的对数概率来测量文本间的风格可转移性，无需监督训练。

Result: 显著优于同等规模的LLM提示方法，在控制主题相关性时比对比训练基线获得更高准确率，性能随基础模型规模稳定扩展。

Conclusion: 该方法在作者身份验证等任务中表现出色，通过增加测试时计算可实现计算成本与准确性的灵活权衡。

Abstract: Computational stylometry analyzes writing style through quantitative patterns
in text, supporting applications from forensic tasks such as identity linking
and plagiarism detection to literary attribution in the humanities. Supervised
and contrastive approaches rely on data with spurious correlations and often
confuse style with topic. Despite their natural use in AI-generated text
detection, the CLM pre-training of modern LLMs has been scarcely leveraged for
general authorship problems. We propose a novel unsupervised approach based on
this extensive pre-training and the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs,
employing the log-probabilities of an LLM to measure style transferability from
one text to another. Our method significantly outperforms LLM prompting
approaches of comparable scale and achieves higher accuracy than contrastively
trained baselines when controlling for topical correlations. Moreover,
performance scales fairly consistently with the size of the base model and, in
the case of authorship verification, with an additional mechanism that
increases test-time computation; enabling flexible trade-offs between
computational cost and accuracy.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ChatR1是一个基于强化学习的对话问答推理框架，通过交错搜索和推理来适应对话中用户意图的演变，使用意图感知奖励解决稀疏奖励问题，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话问答中用户意图会随时间演变，话语往往不完整，需要上下文解释、查询重构以及检索和生成的动态协调。静态的'重写、检索、生成'流水线无法有效处理这些挑战。

Method: 基于强化学习的推理框架，交错搜索和推理，提出意图感知奖励提供回合级反馈，使检索和推理与用户目标对齐。

Result: 在3B和7B模型骨干上均表现强劲，在五个CQA数据集上优于竞争模型（F1、BERTScore和LLM-as-judge指标）。消融研究证实意图感知奖励的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于强化学习的推理比静态CQA流水线实现了更灵活和上下文敏感的行为，能够跨领域稳健泛化。

Abstract: We present ChatR1, a reasoning framework based on reinforcement learning (RL)
for conversational question answering (CQA). Reasoning plays an important role
in CQA, where user intent evolves across dialogue turns, and utterances are
often underspecified, requiring contextual interpretation, query reformulation,
and dynamic coordination between retrieval and generation. Unlike static
`rewrite, retrieve, and generate' pipelines, ChatR1 interleaves search and
reasoning across turns, enabling exploratory and adaptive behaviors learned
through RL. To address the challenge of sparse and delayed rewards in RL, we
propose an intent-aware reward that provides turn-level feedback by aligning
retrieval and reasoning with evolving user goals. Our proposed ChatR1
demonstrates strong performance on both 3B and 7B model backbones,
outperforming competitive models on five CQA datasets, measured by different
metrics (F1, BERTScore, and LLM-as-judge). We include a diverse set of CQA
datasets to cover topic shifts, evolving intents, mixed-initiative dialogues,
and multi-document grounding, testing ChatR1's performance from various
aspects. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the intent-aware reward.
Our analyses further reveal diverse reasoning trajectories and effective use of
the search tool. ChatR1 also generalizes robustly across domains, demonstrating
that RL-based reasoning enables more flexible and context-sensitive behavior
than static CQA pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出EBCAR，一种轻量级重排序框架，通过增强跨段落理解和混合注意力机制，解决RAG系统中跨段落推理的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有重排序方法虽然使用强大的预训练语言模型，但忽略了跨段落推理的挑战，如指代消解、实体消歧和证据聚合等。

Method: EBCAR直接在检索段落的嵌入上操作，通过段落结构信息和混合注意力机制，捕获文档间高层交互和文档内低层关系。

Result: 在ConTEB基准测试中，EBCAR在需要跨段落推理的信息检索任务上表现出色，在准确性和效率方面均有优势。

Conclusion: EBCAR是一个有效的轻量级重排序框架，特别适用于需要跨段落推理的检索任务，在性能和效率上都优于现有方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely on retrieving relevant
evidence from a corpus to support downstream generation. The common practice of
splitting a long document into multiple shorter passages enables finer-grained
and targeted information retrieval. However, it also introduces challenges when
a correct retrieval would require inference across passages, such as resolving
coreference, disambiguating entities, and aggregating evidence scattered across
multiple sources. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) reranking methods, despite
utilizing powerful large pretrained language models with potentially high
inference costs, still neglect the aforementioned challenges. Therefore, we
propose Embedding-Based Context-Aware Reranker (EBCAR), a lightweight reranking
framework operating directly on embeddings of retrieved passages with enhanced
cross-passage understandings through the structural information of the passages
and a hybrid attention mechanism, which captures both high-level interactions
across documents and low-level relationships within each document. We evaluate
EBCAR against SOTA rerankers on the ConTEB benchmark, demonstrating its
effectiveness for information retrieval requiring cross-passage inference and
its advantages in both accuracy and efficiency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出DefensiveKV缓存驱逐方法，通过防御性聚合策略控制最坏情况风险，在保持线性时间复杂度的同时显著减少KV缓存的内存和运行时开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法基于稳定性假设（即固定子集的缓存条目在生成过程中始终重要），但该假设本质脆弱，使均值聚合在极端情况下高度脆弱。

Method: 提出两步骤线性时间防御性聚合策略，控制最坏情况风险。包括DefensiveKV及其扩展Layer-DefensiveKV（结合分层预算分配）。

Result: 在7个任务领域（18个数据集）上，在20%缓存大小下，分别比最强基线减少生成质量损失2.3倍和4.3倍。

Conclusion: 该方法设定了新的性能基准，并开创了通过最坏情况风险管理来优化缓存驱逐的有前景方向。

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized natural language processing, yet
their deployment remains hampered by the substantial memory and runtime
overhead of the transformer's Key-Value cache. To mitigate this, recent methods
employ a scoring-aggregation framework to evict unimportant cache entries,
based on the stability assumption-that a fixed subset of entries remains
consistently important during generation. However, prior work has largely
focused on refining importance indicators for scoring, while defaulting to mean
aggregation due to a faithful trust in the stability assumption. In this work,
we argue that this underlying assumption is inherently fragile, making mean
aggregation highly vulnerable in extreme cases. To counter this, we propose a
simple yet elegant defensive aggregation strategy: a two-step, linear-time
approach that controls worst-case risk, thereby defending against extreme cases
with negligible computational overhead. Embodying this strategy, we propose a
novel cache eviction method, DefensiveKV and its extension, Layer-DefensiveKV,
which incorporates layer-wise budget allocation. Across seven task domains (18
datasets), our methods reduce generation quality loss by 2.3x and 4.3x
respectively, versus the strongest baseline under a 20% cache size. These
results set new performance benchmarks and pioneer a promising direction for
optimizing cache eviction against underlying fragility through worst-case risk
management. Our code is available at https://github.com/FFY0/DefensiveKV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索全球谚语景观，特别是希腊谚语的情感特征，利用NLP技术分析传统文化智慧。

Method: 使用LLM进行谚语情感分类，扩展标注数据集包含方言，结合地理位置、方言和主题进行组合分析。

Result: LLM能准确识别谚语情感，希腊大部分地区负面情感更普遍，地图展示了情感分布概况。

Conclusion: LLM在非常规情感极性任务中表现良好，希腊谚语整体偏向负面情感，为文化研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Proverbs are among the most fascinating linguistic phenomena that transcend
cultural and linguistic boundaries. Yet, much of the global landscape of
proverbs remains underexplored, as many cultures preserve their traditional
wisdom within their own communities due to the oral tradition of the
phenomenon. Taking advantage of the current advances in Natural Language
Processing (NLP), we focus on Greek proverbs, analyzing their sentiment.
Departing from an annotated dataset of Greek proverbs, we expand it to include
local dialects, effectively mapping the annotated sentiment. We present (1) a
way to exploit LLMs in order to perform sentiment classification of proverbs,
(2) a map of Greece that provides an overview of the distribution of sentiment,
(3) a combinatory analysis in terms of the geographic position, dialect, and
topic of proverbs. Our findings show that LLMs can provide us with an accurate
enough picture of the sentiment of proverbs, especially when approached as a
non-conventional sentiment polarity task. Moreover, in most areas of Greece
negative sentiment is more prevalent.

TL;DR: Protect是一个原生多模态护栏模型，专为企业级部署设计，能够无缝处理文本、图像和音频输入，在毒性、性别歧视、数据隐私和提示注入四个安全维度上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在企业关键领域的部署增加，现有护栏系统在实时监督、多模态数据处理和可解释性方面存在局限，无法满足监管环境需求。现有护栏大多孤立运行且仅关注文本，不适合多模态生产环境。

Method: Protect集成通过低秩适应(LoRA)在广泛多模态数据集上训练的特定类别适配器，采用教师辅助标注管道利用推理和解释轨迹生成高保真、上下文感知的跨模态标签。

Result: 实验结果显示在所有安全维度上都达到最先进性能，超越了WildGuard、LlamaGuard-4和GPT-4.1等现有开源和专有模型。

Conclusion: Protect为可信、可审计且生产就绪的安全系统奠定了坚实基础，能够跨文本、图像和音频模态运行。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) across enterprise
and mission-critical domains has underscored the urgent need for robust
guardrailing systems that ensure safety, reliability, and compliance. Existing
solutions often struggle with real-time oversight, multi-modal data handling,
and explainability -- limitations that hinder their adoption in regulated
environments. Existing guardrails largely operate in isolation, focused on text
alone making them inadequate for multi-modal, production-scale environments. We
introduce Protect, natively multi-modal guardrailing model designed to operate
seamlessly across text, image, and audio inputs, designed for enterprise-grade
deployment. Protect integrates fine-tuned, category-specific adapters trained
via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on an extensive, multi-modal dataset covering
four safety dimensions: toxicity, sexism, data privacy, and prompt injection.
Our teacher-assisted annotation pipeline leverages reasoning and explanation
traces to generate high-fidelity, context-aware labels across modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all safety
dimensions, surpassing existing open and proprietary models such as WildGuard,
LlamaGuard-4, and GPT-4.1. Protect establishes a strong foundation for
trustworthy, auditable, and production-ready safety systems capable of
operating across text, image, and audio modalities.

Motivation: 研究联邦学习环境中ASR模型对属性推断攻击的脆弱性，揭示在隐私保护训练框架下可能存在的安全漏洞。

Method: 采用非参数白盒攻击方法，在被动威胁模型下仅利用权重差异（无需原始语音数据）对Wav2Vec2、HuBERT和Whisper三种ASR模型进行属性推断攻击测试。

Result: 攻击能够成功推断敏感的人口统计和临床属性，特别是口音信息在所有模型中都能被可靠推断。预训练数据中代表性不足或缺失的属性更容易受到此类攻击。

Conclusion: 联邦ASR模型存在先前未记录的脆弱性，研究结果为改进模型安全性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Federated learning is a common method for privacy-preserving training of
machine learning models. In this paper, we analyze the vulnerability of ASR
models to attribute inference attacks in the federated setting. We test a
non-parametric white-box attack method under a passive threat model on three
ASR models: Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and Whisper. The attack operates solely on weight
differentials without access to raw speech from target speakers. We demonstrate
attack feasibility on sensitive demographic and clinical attributes: gender,
age, accent, emotion, and dysarthria. Our findings indicate that attributes
that are underrepresented or absent in the pre-training data are more
vulnerable to such inference attacks. In particular, information about accents
can be reliably inferred from all models. Our findings expose previously
undocumented vulnerabilities in federated ASR models and offer insights towards
improved security.

*Xiang Lei,Qin Li,Min Zhang,Min Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: D-SMART是一个模型无关框架，通过动态结构化记忆和推理树来维护多轮对话的一致性，显著提升对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在多轮对话中出现事实不一致和逻辑衰减的问题，现有方法如RAG和记忆机制仍依赖静态知识源，无法适应动态对话上下文。

Method: 包含两个组件：动态结构化记忆(DSM)增量构建对话知识图谱，推理树(RT)在图上进行多步可追溯推理。

Result: 在MT-Bench-101基准测试中，对话一致性得分提升超过48%，开源模型质量得分提升达10.1%。

Conclusion: D-SMART通过结构化表示和显式推理有效解决了多轮对话的一致性问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit factual inconsistencies and
logical decay in extended, multi-turn dialogues, a challenge stemming from
their reliance on static, pre-trained knowledge and an inability to reason
adaptively over the dialogue history. Prevailing mitigation strategies, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and agentic working memories, improve
information recall but still engage with fundamentally static knowledge sources
and follow pre-defined single reasoning path. This hinders their ability to
preserve factual and logical consistency of their responses in multi-turn
dialogues while the context evolves over time. To address this issue, we
propose D-SMART, a model-agnostic framework designed to maintain multi-turn
dialogue consistency by enabling LLMs to build and reason over a dynamic,
structured representation of the conversational context. This is achieved via
two synergistic components: (1) a Dynamic Structured Memory (DSM), which
incrementally constructs and maintains an authoritative, OWL-compliant
knowledge graph of the conversation; and (2) a Reasoning Tree (RT), which
executes inferences as an explicit and traceable multi-step search over the
graph. As the popular-used quality score (judged by GPT-4) can overlook logical
flaws, we introduce new NLI-based metrics to better measure multi-turn dialogue
consistency. Comprehensive experiments on the MT-Bench-101 benchmark show that
D-SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, elevating the
dialogue consistency score by over 48\% for both proprietary and open-source
models, and notably improves the quality score of the latter by up to 10.1\%.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了在单轮对话中应用贝叶斯说服框架来增强大语言模型的策略性说服能力，通过承诺-沟通机制让说服者明确描述信息模式，引导被说服者进行贝叶斯信念更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI系统在说服能力方面存在挑战，现有研究往往忽视信息不对称的策略使用或依赖强假设。需要开发更有效的自然语言说服框架。

Method: 提出两种贝叶斯说服变体：半正式自然语言和全自然语言，通过承诺-沟通机制让说服者叙述潜在类型来引导信念更新，并与多种基线方法进行比较评估。

Result: 实验表明：1）基于贝叶斯说服的LLM说服成功率更高；2）半正式变体更具可信度和逻辑一致性，全自然语言变体情感共鸣更强；3）经过微调的小模型能达到与大模型相当的表现。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯说服框架能有效提升LLM的策略性说服能力，不同变体各有优势，且模型规模不是决定性因素，为AI说服系统开发提供了新思路。

Abstract: Persuasion, a fundamental social capability for humans, remains a challenge
for AI systems such as large language models (LLMs). Current studies often
overlook the strategic use of information asymmetry in message design or rely
on strong assumptions regarding pre-commitment. In this work, we explore the
application of Bayesian Persuasion (BP) in natural language within single-turn
dialogue settings, to enhance the strategic persuasion capabilities of LLMs.
Our framework incorporates a commitment-communication mechanism, where the
persuader explicitly outlines an information schema by narrating their
potential types (e.g., honest or dishonest), thereby guiding the persuadee in
performing the intended Bayesian belief update. We evaluate two variants of our
approach: Semi-Formal-Natural-Language (SFNL) BP and Fully-Natural-Language
(FNL) BP, benchmarking them against both naive and strong non-BP (NBP)
baselines within a comprehensive evaluation framework. This framework covers a
diverse set of persuadees -- including LLM instances with varying prompts and
fine-tuning and human participants -- across tasks ranging from specially
designed persuasion scenarios to general everyday situations. Experimental
results on LLM-based agents reveal three main findings: (1) LLMs guided by BP
strategies consistently achieve higher persuasion success rates than NBP
baselines; (2) SFNL exhibits greater credibility and logical coherence, while
FNL shows stronger emotional resonance and robustness in naturalistic
conversations; (3) with supervised fine-tuning, smaller models can attain BP
performance comparable to that of larger models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言对人类合作至关重要，本研究旨在验证生成代理模型是否能有效模拟心理理论能力，以及GPT-4是否能从社会情境中进行真正推理而非依赖语言记忆。

Method: 使用生成代理模型Concordia框架，在模拟现实世界环境中评估GPT-4的心理理论模拟能力和基于社会情境的推理能力。

Result: GPT-4经常无法基于信念归因选择行动，难以从代理行动中生成连贯的因果效应，在处理复杂社会互动方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 这些结果对当前关于大语言模型中心理理论能力的说法提出了挑战，强调需要更严格、基于行动的评价框架。

Abstract: Language is fundamental to human cooperation, facilitating not only the
exchange of information but also the coordination of actions through shared
interpretations of situational contexts. This study explores whether the
Generative Agent-Based Model (GABM) Concordia can effectively model Theory of
Mind (ToM) within simulated real-world environments. Specifically, we assess
whether this framework successfully simulates ToM abilities and whether GPT-4
can perform tasks by making genuine inferences from social context, rather than
relying on linguistic memorization. Our findings reveal a critical limitation:
GPT-4 frequently fails to select actions based on belief attribution,
suggesting that apparent ToM-like abilities observed in previous studies may
stem from shallow statistical associations rather than true reasoning.
Additionally, the model struggles to generate coherent causal effects from
agent actions, exposing difficulties in processing complex social interactions.
These results challenge current statements about emergent ToM-like capabilities
in LLMs and highlight the need for more rigorous, action-based evaluation
frameworks.

*Kim Gfeller,Sabine Stoll,Chundra Cathcart,Paul Widmer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究使用系统发育比较模型分析三个语系中的共词化现象，发现概念关联性越强，共词化越普遍且变化越慢；而使用频率高和易借用的概念对变化更快且较少共词化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言意义如何演变及其决定因素尚未完全理解，共词化现象为研究跨语言意义变化动态提供了重要窗口。

Method: 应用系统发育比较模型分析南岛语系、印欧语系和乌拉尔语系的词典数据，评估关联性、可借用性和使用频率三个预测因素的影响。

Result: 关联性强的概念对在语系树中更广泛共词化且变化更慢；高频和易借用概念对变化更快且较少共词化；不同语系间存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 概念关联性促进共词化稳定性，而使用频率和借用倾向加速变化；区域和文化因素在意义演变中发挥重要作用。

Abstract: One of the most intriguing features of language is its constant change, with
ongoing shifts in how meaning is expressed. Despite decades of research, the
factors that determine how and why meanings evolve remain only partly
understood. Colexification -- the phenomenon of expressing multiple distinct
concepts using the same word form -- serves as a valuable window onto the
dynamics of meaning change across languages. Here, we apply phylogenetic
comparative models to dictionary data from three language families,
Austronesian, Indo-European, and Uralic, in order to shed light on the
evolutionary dynamics underlying the colexification of concept pairs. We assess
the effects of three predictors: associativity, borrowability, and usage
frequency. Our results show that more closely related concept pairs are
colexified across a larger portion of the family tree and exhibit slower rates
of change. In contrast, concept pairs that are more frequent and more prone to
borrowing tend to change more rapidly and are less often colexified. We also
find considerable differences between the language families under study,
suggesting that areal and cultural factors may play a role.

TL;DR: 这是首个阿拉伯语大语言模型基准的系统综述，分析了40多个评估基准，涵盖NLP任务、知识领域、文化理解和专业能力，提出了分类法并识别了关键差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补阿拉伯语LLM基准评估的系统性空白，为阿拉伯语NLP研究人员提供全面的参考框架，促进更有效的模型评估和发展。

Method: 提出四分类法组织基准：知识、NLP任务、文化与方言、目标特定评估；分析三种主要方法：原生收集、翻译和合成生成，讨论其真实性、规模和成本的权衡。

Result: 发现基准多样性显著进展，但存在关键差距：时间评估有限、多轮对话评估不足、翻译数据集的文化错位；提供了基准方法学、可重复性标准和评估指标的见解。

Conclusion: 本工作为阿拉伯语NLP研究提供了全面的基准评估参考，提出了未来发展的建议，强调需要改进时间评估、多轮对话能力和文化对齐。

Abstract: This survey provides the first systematic review of Arabic LLM benchmarks,
analyzing 40+ evaluation benchmarks across NLP tasks, knowledge domains,
cultural understanding, and specialized capabilities. We propose a taxonomy
organizing benchmarks into four categories: Knowledge, NLP Tasks, Culture and
Dialects, and Target-Specific evaluations. Our analysis reveals significant
progress in benchmark diversity while identifying critical gaps: limited
temporal evaluation, insufficient multi-turn dialogue assessment, and cultural
misalignment in translated datasets. We examine three primary approaches:
native collection, translation, and synthetic generation discussing their
trade-offs regarding authenticity, scale, and cost. This work serves as a
comprehensive reference for Arabic NLP researchers, providing insights into
benchmark methodologies, reproducibility standards, and evaluation metrics
while offering recommendations for future development.

*Hao Wang,Linlong Xu,Heng Liu,Yangyang Liu,Xiaohu Zhao,Bo Zeng,Liangying Shao,Longyue Wang,Weihua Luo,Kaifu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: M^2PO是一个用于机器翻译的多对多视角偏好优化框架，通过整合幻觉惩罚和动态质量评分来增强奖励信号，并利用多对构造策略从所有翻译候选中系统创建偏好对，显著提升了翻译质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于直接偏好优化(DPO)的方法在机器翻译中存在两个主要问题：质量评估模型提供的奖励信号存在缺陷（忽略关键错误如翻译幻觉），以及数据利用效率低下（仅选择单个胜负对而丢弃有价值的学习信号）。

Method: 提出M^2PO框架：1）多视角奖励引擎，结合幻觉惩罚和动态质量评分；2）多对构造策略，从所有翻译候选中系统创建全面的偏好对集合。

Result: 在WMT21-22基准测试中，M^2PO显著优于现有的偏好优化方法，并与领先的专有大语言模型表现出高度竞争力。

Conclusion: M^2PO通过多视角奖励和多对构造的协同方法，能够从更丰富的质量权衡中学习，产生更鲁棒和忠实的翻译。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a powerful paradigm for aligning
Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences in Machine Translation (MT),
but current methods are hindered by two fundamental challenges: (1) flawed
reward signals from Quality Estimation (QE) models that overlook critical
errors like translation hallucination, and (2) inefficient data utilization
that discards valuable learning signals by selecting only a single win-loss
pair. To address these limitations, we introduce M^2PO: Multi-Pair,
Multi-Perspective Preference Optimization. Our framework integrates a
multi-perspective reward engine that creates a more robust signal by combining
two key viewpoints: a new hallucination penalty for factuality, and an
innovative dynamic quality score that adaptively fuses external evaluations
with the model's own evolving judgment. This is synergistically paired with a
multi-pair construction strategy that systematically creates a comprehensive
set of preference pairs from the entire pool of translation candidates. This
synergistic approach ensures the model learns from a richer spectrum of quality
trade-offs, leading to more robust and faithful translations. On challenging
WMT21-22 benchmarks, M^2PO substantially outperforms existing preference
optimization methods and demonstrates highly competitive performance against
leading proprietary LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了LiteraryQA，这是NarrativeQA的一个高质量子集，专注于文学作品，通过人工和LLM验证的流程清理了低质量QA样本和源文档中的无关文本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前在叙事文本上的问答系统面临挑战，而最广泛使用的基准NarrativeQA存在文档噪声和QA对缺陷的问题，影响了可靠性。

Method: 使用人工和LLM验证的流程识别和修正低质量QA样本，同时从源文档中移除无关文本。进行自动指标的元评估，并基准测试了一系列长上下文LLM。

Result: 发现所有基于n-gram的指标在系统级别上与人类判断的相关性较低，而LLM-as-a-Judge评估（即使是小型开源模型）能够与人类确定的排名高度一致。

Conclusion: LiteraryQA提供了一个更可靠的叙事文本问答基准，LLM评估方法优于传统n-gram指标，能够更好地与人类判断保持一致。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) on narrative text poses a unique challenge to current
systems, requiring a deep understanding of long, complex documents. However,
the reliability of NarrativeQA, the most widely used benchmark in this domain,
is hindered by noisy documents and flawed QA pairs. In this work, we introduce
LiteraryQA, a high-quality subset of NarrativeQA focused on literary works.
Using a human- and LLM-validated pipeline, we identify and correct low-quality
QA samples while removing extraneous text from source documents. We then carry
out a meta-evaluation of automatic metrics to clarify how systems should be
evaluated on LiteraryQA. This analysis reveals that all n-gram-based metrics
have a low system-level correlation to human judgment, while LLM-as-a-Judge
evaluations, even with small open-weight models, can strongly agree with the
ranking identified by humans. Finally, we benchmark a set of long-context LLMs
on LiteraryQA. We release our code and data at
https://github.com/SapienzaNLP/LiteraryQA.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个专门用于意图理解的动态实时评估基准\bench，针对消费者领域，支持实时更新并通过自动化流程防止数据污染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏针对真实世界人类意图理解的大规模评估基准，特别是在涉及多源信号、矛盾观点和动态演变的公共讨论场景中。

Method: 构建了\bench基准，这是同类中最大且最多样化的基准，支持实时更新并采用自动化数据筛选流程。

Result: \bench成为首个专门用于意图理解的动态实时评估基准，填补了该领域的空白。

Conclusion: \bench基准为评估LLMs在真实世界人类意图理解方面的能力提供了重要工具，特别适用于消费者领域的复杂讨论场景。

Abstract: Understanding human intent is a complex, high-level task for large language
models (LLMs), requiring analytical reasoning, contextual interpretation,
dynamic information aggregation, and decision-making under uncertainty.
Real-world public discussions, such as consumer product discussions, are rarely
linear or involve a single user. Instead, they are characterized by interwoven
and often conflicting perspectives, divergent concerns, goals, emotional
tendencies, as well as implicit assumptions and background knowledge about
usage scenarios. To accurately understand such explicit public intent, an LLM
must go beyond parsing individual sentences; it must integrate multi-source
signals, reason over inconsistencies, and adapt to evolving discourse, similar
to how experts in fields like politics, economics, or finance approach complex,
uncertain environments. Despite the importance of this capability, no
large-scale benchmark currently exists for evaluating LLMs on real-world human
intent understanding, primarily due to the challenges of collecting real-world
public discussion data and constructing a robust evaluation pipeline. To bridge
this gap, we introduce \bench, the first dynamic, live evaluation benchmark
specifically designed for intent understanding, particularly in the consumer
domain. \bench is the largest and most diverse benchmark of its kind,
supporting real-time updates while preventing data contamination through an
automated curation pipeline.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了MedREK框架，解决医疗LLMs中知识过时和不准确的问题，通过检索式编辑方法改进单样本和批量编辑能力，并在MedVersa基准上验证了其优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗LLMs面临知识快速更新和训练数据错误的问题，导致生成过时或不准确信息，限制了在临床实践中的应用。参数编辑方法会损害局部性，而检索式编辑虽然更可行，但仍存在表示重叠和批量编辑不足的挑战。

Method: 构建MedVersa基准评估单样本和批量编辑，提出MedREK框架，集成共享查询-键模块进行精确匹配，并使用基于注意力的提示编码器提供信息指导。

Result: 在多个医疗基准测试中，MedREK在不同核心指标上均表现出优越性能，并为医疗LLMs提供了首个经过验证的批量编辑解决方案。

Conclusion: MedREK框架成功解决了医疗LLMs编辑中的关键挑战，在保持局部性的同时实现了高效的批量知识更新，为医疗AI应用提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: LLMs hold great promise for healthcare applications, but the rapid evolution
of medical knowledge and errors in training data often cause them to generate
outdated or inaccurate information, limiting their applicability in high-stakes
clinical practice. Model editing has emerged as a potential remedy without full
retraining. While parameter-based editing often compromises locality and is
thus ill-suited for the medical domain, retrieval-based editing offers a more
viable alternative. However, it still faces two critical challenges: (1)
representation overlap within the medical knowledge space often causes
inaccurate retrieval and reduces editing accuracy; (2) existing methods are
restricted to single-sample edits, while batch-editing remains largely
unexplored despite its importance for real-world medical applications. To
address these challenges, we first construct MedVersa, \hk{an enhanced
benchmark with broader coverage of medical subjects, designed to evaluate both
single and batch edits under strict locality constraints}. We then propose
MedREK, a retrieval-based editing framework that integrates a shared query-key
module for precise matching with an attention-based prompt encoder for
informative guidance. Experimental results on various medical benchmarks
demonstrate that our MedREK achieves superior performance across different core
metrics and provides the first validated solution for batch-editing in medical
LLMs. Our code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/mylittleriver/MedREK.

TL;DR: 该论文通过分析注意力机制揭示了LLM的推理模式，提出了基于注意力信号的强化学习策略，实现了更透明有效的LLM优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM推理过程不透明的问题，以及强化学习中统一信用分配无法区分关键步骤和常规步骤的局限性。

Method: 区分局部和全局注意力头，提出两种度量指标（窗口平均注意力距离和未来注意力影响），并基于此开发了三种针对关键节点的强化学习策略。

Result: 提出的方法在各种推理任务中均取得了稳定的性能提升，验证了基于注意力机制的信用分配策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将优化与模型内在推理节奏对齐，实现了从黑盒优化到结构感知过程的转变，为LLM推理的透明有效优化提供了新途径。

Abstract: The reasoning pattern of Large language models (LLMs) remains opaque, and
Reinforcement learning (RL) typically applies uniform credit across an entire
generation, blurring the distinction between pivotal and routine steps. This
work positions attention as a privileged substrate that renders the internal
logic of LLMs legible, not merely as a byproduct of computation, but as a
mechanistic blueprint of reasoning itself. We first distinguish attention heads
between locally and globally focused information processing and reveal that
locally focused heads produce a sawtooth pattern near the diagonal indicating
phrasal chunks, while globally focused heads expose tokens that exert broad
downstream influence over future tokens. We formalize these with two metrics:
1) Windowed Average Attention Distance, which measures the extent of backward
attention within a clipped window; 2) Future Attention Influence, which
quantifies a token's global importance as the average attention it receives
from subsequent tokens. Taken together, these signals reveal a recurring
preplan-and-anchor mechanism, where the model first performs a long-range
contextual reference to generate an introductory token, which is immediately
followed by or coincides with a semantic anchor token that organizes subsequent
reasoning. Leveraging these insights, we introduce three novel RL strategies
that dynamically perform targeted credit assignment to critical nodes (preplan
tokens, anchor tokens, and their temporal coupling) and show consistent
performance gains across various reasoning tasks. By aligning optimization with
the model's intrinsic reasoning rhythm, we aim to transform opaque optimization
into an actionable structure-aware process, hoping to offer a potential step
toward more transparent and effective optimization of LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种通过微调语言特定子网络来增强LLM在低资源语言中单语能力的方法，仅更新最多1%的参数即可提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在不同语言间表现不均，高资源语言和低资源语言之间存在显著性能差距，需要提升低资源语言的单语能力

Method: 使用语言激活概率熵识别语言特定神经元，仅微调与这些神经元相关的权重（专用子网络）

Result: 在12种中低资源语言上的实验表明，该方法优于全微调、FFN微调、LoRA适配和随机子集微调基线

Conclusion: 该方法为将最先进模型适配到低资源语言提供了一条成本效益高的途径

Abstract: Large language models exhibit uneven performance across languages, with
substantial gaps between high- and low-resource languages. We present a
framework for enhancing monolingual capabilities of LLMs in underrepresented
languages while preserving their general-purpose performance through targeted
fine-tuning of language-specific subnetworks. Our approach identifies
language-specific neurons using Language Activation Probability Entropy and
fine-tunes only the weights associated with these neurons, a dedicated
subnetwork, on target-language data. Experiments on Llama-3.1-8B and
Mistral-Nemo-12B across 12 mid- and low-resource languages demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms full fine-tuning, FFN-only fine-tuning, LoRA
adaptation, and random subset fine-tuning baselines while efficiently updating
only up to 1% of model parameters. Beyond performance improvements, we observe
enhanced favorable training dynamics, cross-lingual representational alignment,
and systematic weight update changes. To facilitate future research, we release
language-specific neuron identifications for over 100 languages as well as our
adaptation pipeline, offering a cost-effective pathway for adapting
state-of-the-art models to underrepresented languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格到文本生成基准测试面临LLM训练数据污染和领域不平衡问题，且非英语数据集有限，需要更纯净、多语言、多领域的评估基准。

Method: 从维基百科动态收集最新表格数据，构建多语言（英语、德语、俄语、法语）表格到文本基准测试，实现领域平衡评估。

Result: LLM从新表格生成的文本在自动指标上表现较差，但在LLM和人工评估中差异不明显；领域效应在所有评估中都可见，表明领域平衡基准更具挑战性。

Conclusion: FreshTab有效解决了数据污染问题，多语言和领域平衡特性使其成为更具挑战性的表格到文本评估基准。

Abstract: Table-to-text generation (insight generation from tables) is a challenging
task that requires precision in analyzing the data. In addition, the evaluation
of existing benchmarks is affected by contamination of Large Language Model
(LLM) training data as well as domain imbalance. We introduce FreshTab, an
on-the-fly table-to-text benchmark generation from Wikipedia, to combat the LLM
data contamination problem and enable domain-sensitive evaluation. While
non-English table-to-text datasets are limited, FreshTab collects datasets in
different languages on demand (we experiment with German, Russian and French in
addition to English). We find that insights generated by LLMs from recent
tables collected by our method appear clearly worse by automatic metrics, but
this does not translate into LLM and human evaluations. Domain effects are
visible in all evaluations, showing that a~domain-balanced benchmark is more
challenging.

TL;DR: NOSA是一种可训练的稀疏注意力框架，通过引入显式局部性约束来减少KV缓存传输，在保持训练时注意力计算不变的同时，显著提升长文本解码吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法虽然减少了内存访问，但KV缓存大小未减小，限制了GPU批处理大小和解码吞吐量，特别是在大规模批处理推理中。

Method: NOSA将token选择分解为查询感知和查询无关组件，引入显式局部性约束，减少CPU和GPU间的KV传输，同时保持与训练时相同的注意力计算。

Result: 预训练的1B参数模型在保持近乎无损性能的同时，相比基线InfLLM-V2实现了最高2.3倍的解码吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: NOSA通过显式局部性约束有效解决了KV缓存传输瓶颈，在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了解码效率。

Abstract: Trainable sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution to address the
decoding efficiency bottleneck of LLMs in long-context processing,
significantly saving memory accesses while minimally impacting task
performance. However, existing sparse attention methods leave a crucial
limitation unresolved: the size of the key-value (KV) cache remains unreduced,
which constrains on-GPU batch sizes and throttles decoding throughput,
especially in large-scale batched inference. In this paper, we show that
trainable sparse attention naturally exhibits strong locality in token
selection across adjacent decoding steps, thereby enabling KV cache offloading
without altering the underlying attention computation. However, the inherent
locality remains insufficient to achieve efficient offloading, as the transfer
of selected KV pairs between the CPU and GPU continues to dominate the overall
decoding cost. Building on this insight, we present NOSA, a trainable sparse
attention framework designed to natively support KV cache offloading. NOSA
introduces explicit locality constraints by decomposing token selection into
query-aware and query-agnostic components, thereby reducing KV transfers while
preserving the same attention computation as used during training. We pretrain
a 1B-parameter model with NOSA and conduct extensive benchmarks, showing that
it preserves near-lossless performance while achieving up to a 2.3x improvement
in decoding throughput compared with the vanilla trainable sparse attention
baseline (InfLLM-V2).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在时间理解方面存在困难，特别是在涉及多个实体、复合运算符和演化事件序列的问题时。时间知识图谱提供了结构化时间事实，但现有方法面临时间忠实性、多实体同步、运算符适应性和经验重用等挑战。

Method: 提出MemoTime框架，将复杂时间问题分解为时间树，实现运算符感知推理，强制执行单调时间戳和统一时间约束。包含动态证据检索层和自演进经验记忆，存储验证过的推理轨迹和工具决策。

Result: 在多个时间QA基准测试中达到最先进水平，比强基线提升高达24.0%。使较小模型（如Qwen3-4B）达到与GPT-4-Turbo相当的推理性能。

Conclusion: MemoTime通过结构化时间推理和持续经验学习，有效解决了LLM时间推理的关键挑战，显著提升了时间理解能力，并使小模型也能达到大模型的推理水平。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning abilities,
but struggle with temporal understanding, especially when questions involve
multiple entities, compound operators, and evolving event sequences. Temporal
Knowledge Graphs (TKGs), which capture vast amounts of temporal facts in a
structured format, offer a reliable source for temporal reasoning. However,
existing TKG-based LLM reasoning methods still struggle with four major
challenges: maintaining temporal faithfulness in multi-hop reasoning, achieving
multi-entity temporal synchronization, adapting retrieval to diverse temporal
operators, and reusing prior reasoning experience for stability and efficiency.
To address these issues, we propose MemoTime, a memory-augmented temporal
knowledge graph framework that enhances LLM reasoning through structured
grounding, recursive reasoning, and continual experience learning. MemoTime
decomposes complex temporal questions into a hierarchical Tree of Time,
enabling operator-aware reasoning that enforces monotonic timestamps and
co-constrains multiple entities under unified temporal bounds. A dynamic
evidence retrieval layer adaptively selects operator-specific retrieval
strategies, while a self-evolving experience memory stores verified reasoning
traces, toolkit decisions, and sub-question embeddings for cross-type reuse.
Comprehensive experiments on multiple temporal QA benchmarks show that MemoTime
achieves overall state-of-the-art results, outperforming the strong baseline by
up to 24.0%. Furthermore, MemoTime enables smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-4B) to
achieve reasoning performance comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德国医疗文档中准确编码肿瘤诊断至关重要，但开源小模型在德语环境中编码准确性不足，需要提升其医疗文档自动化能力。

Method: 基于ICD-10-GM、ICD-O-3和OPS目录创建50多万问答对，对Qwen、Llama和Mistral家族的8个开源模型（7-70B参数）进行指令微调。

Result: ICD-10-GM准确率从1.4-24%提升至41-58%，部分准确率从31-74%提升至73-83%；ICD-O-3地形编码准确率从较低水平提升至22-40%。模型大小与准确性正相关，但微调后差距缩小。

Conclusion: 利用公共目录构建指令数据集可有效提升LLM在医疗文档任务中的表现，为隐私保护的医疗文档自动化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential
for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are
appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding
accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether
instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy
of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded
diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a
systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding
performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial
(three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000
question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS
catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families
(7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to
41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3
topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower
with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after
fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models.
Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with
model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning.
The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than
fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential
of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs
in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the
best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from
https://huggingface.co/datasets/stefan-m-lenz/ICDOPS-QA-2024.

TL;DR: SALAD方法通过跨模态蒸馏和有针对性的合成数据，在减少语音数据需求的同时缩小文本-语音理解差距，使3B和7B LLM在广泛领域基准测试中达到与强开放权重模型竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语音适应LLM在语言理解任务中持续落后于文本LLM的问题，即文本-语音理解差距。现有方法依赖大规模语音合成或专有数据集，成本高且不可复现，需要更数据高效的方法。

Method: 提出SALAD方法，结合跨模态蒸馏和有针对性的合成数据，通过主动选择和学习来改善对齐同时减轻遗忘。分析差距由两个因素驱动：适应过程中的文本能力遗忘，以及语音和文本之间的跨模态不对齐。

Result: 在3B和7B LLM上应用SALAD，在知识、语言理解和推理等广泛领域基准测试中，使用比公开语料库少一个数量级的语音数据训练，达到了与强开放权重模型竞争的性能。

Conclusion: SALAD通过数据高效的方法成功缩小了文本-语音理解差距，证明了跨模态蒸馏和有针对性的合成数据的有效性，为语音适应LLM提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be adapted to extend their text capabilities
to speech inputs. However, these speech-adapted LLMs consistently underperform
their text-based counterparts--and even cascaded pipelines--on language
understanding tasks. We term this shortfall the text-speech understanding gap:
the performance drop observed when a speech-adapted LLM processes spoken inputs
relative to when the original text-based LLM processes the equivalent text.
Recent approaches to narrowing this gap either rely on large-scale speech
synthesis of text corpora, which is costly and heavily dependent on synthetic
data, or on large-scale proprietary speech datasets, which are not
reproducible. As a result, there remains a need for more data-efficient
alternatives for closing the text-speech understanding gap. In this work, we
analyze the gap as driven by two factors: (i) forgetting of text capabilities
during adaptation, and (ii) cross-modal misalignment between speech and text.
Based on this analysis, we introduce SALAD--Sample-efficient Alignment with
Learning through Active selection and cross-modal Distillation--which combines
cross-modal distillation with targeted synthetic data to improve alignment
while mitigating forgetting. Applied to 3B and 7B LLMs, SALAD achieves
competitive performance with a strong open-weight model across broad-domain
benchmarks in knowledge, language understanding, and reasoning, while training
on over an order of magnitude less speech data from public corpora.

*Matthieu Dubois,François Yvon,Pablo Piantanida*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了基于采样的解码策略对LLM生成文本检测器性能的影响，发现即使微小的解码参数调整也会严重损害检测器准确性，AUROC可能从接近完美降至1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM生成文本日益普遍且难以与人类写作区分，自动文本检测研究受到关注。但现有检测器通常在固定生成设置下评估，缺乏对解码策略变化的鲁棒性研究。

Method: 系统性地研究了采样解码对可检测性的影响，重点关注模型在（子）词级分布的细微变化如何影响检测性能。分析了温度、top-p、核采样等解码参数的影响。

Result: 发现即使对解码参数进行微小调整也会严重损害检测器准确性，在某些设置下AUROC从接近完美水平降至1%。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了当前检测方法的关键盲点，强调需要更全面的评估协议。作者发布了包含37种解码配置的大规模数据集和评估框架。

Abstract: As texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) are ever more common and
often indistinguishable from human-written content, research on automatic text
detection has attracted growing attention. Many recent detectors report
near-perfect accuracy, often boasting AUROC scores above 99\%. However, these
claims typically assume fixed generation settings, leaving open the question of
how robust such systems are to changes in decoding strategies. In this work, we
systematically examine how sampling-based decoding impacts detectability, with
a focus on how subtle variations in a model's (sub)word-level distribution
affect detection performance. We find that even minor adjustments to decoding
parameters - such as temperature, top-p, or nucleus sampling - can severely
impair detector accuracy, with AUROC dropping from near-perfect levels to 1\%
in some settings. Our findings expose critical blind spots in current detection
methods and emphasize the need for more comprehensive evaluation protocols. To
facilitate future research, we release a large-scale dataset encompassing 37
decoding configurations, along with our code and evaluation framework

TL;DR: NExT-OMNI是一个开源的全模态基础模型，通过离散流范式实现统一建模，支持任意模态间的理解和生成任务，在多轮多模态交互和跨模态检索方面优于现有统一模型。


<details>

Motivation: 现有多模态模型受限于自回归架构，无法平衡理解和生成能力，且混合和解耦策略的设计冗余，限制了在更广泛场景中的应用。

Method: 利用度量诱导概率路径和动力学最优速度的离散流范式，通过简洁统一表示而非任务解耦设计，实现任意模态间的理解和生成。

Result: 在大规模交错文本、图像、视频和音频数据上训练，在多模态生成和理解基准测试中表现优异，在多轮多模态交互和跨模态检索方面超越现有统一模型。

Conclusion: NExT-OMNI作为下一代多模态基础模型具有架构优势，为推进进一步研究，作者发布了训练细节、数据协议以及代码和模型检查点。

Abstract: Next-generation multimodal foundation models capable of any-to-any
cross-modal generation and multi-turn interaction will serve as core components
of artificial general intelligence systems, playing a pivotal role in
human-machine interaction. However, most existing multimodal models remain
constrained by autoregressive architectures, whose inherent limitations prevent
a balanced integration of understanding and generation capabilities. Although
hybrid and decoupling strategies have been explored to address these tasks
within unified frameworks separately, their redundant, non-integrated designs
limit their applicability to broader scenarios, such as cross-modal
retrieval.In this work, we introduce NExT-OMNI, an open-source omnimodal
foundation model that achieves unified modeling through discrete flow
paradigms. By leveraging metric-induced probability paths and kinetic optimal
velocities, NExT-OMNI natively supports any-to-any understanding and generation
with enhanced response efficiency, while enabling broader application scenarios
through concise unified representations rather than task-decoupled designs.
Trained on large-scale interleaved text, image, video, and audio data,
NExT-OMNI delivers competitive performance on multimodal generation and
understanding benchmarks, while outperforming prior unified models in
multi-turn multimodal interaction and cross-modal retrieval, highlighting its
architectural advantages as a next-generation multimodal foundation model. To
advance further research, we release training details, data protocols, and
open-source both the code and model checkpoints.

TL;DR: 提出了GAPS框架，一个多维度的AI临床医生系统评估范式，包含认知深度(G)、答案完整性(A)、鲁棒性(P)和安全性(S)四个维度，并通过自动化流程构建了相应的基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI临床医生系统基准测试主要基于选择题考试或人工评分标准，无法充分评估真实临床实践所需的深度、鲁棒性和安全性。

Method: 开发了全自动、基于指南的流水线来构建GAPS对齐的基准测试，包括构建证据邻域、创建图和树表示、自动生成跨G级别的问题，并使用DeepResearch代理合成评分标准，最后通过LLM评委进行评分。

Result: 验证显示自动生成的问题质量高且与临床医生判断一致。评估最先进模型发现关键失败模式：随着推理深度增加性能急剧下降、模型在答案完整性方面表现不佳、对对抗性扰动高度脆弱且存在某些安全问题。

Conclusion: 这种自动化、基于临床的方法为严格评估AI临床医生系统提供了可重复和可扩展的方法，指导其向更安全可靠的临床实践发展。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for AI clinician systems, often based on multiple-choice
exams or manual rubrics, fail to capture the depth, robustness, and safety
required for real-world clinical practice. To address this, we introduce the
GAPS framework, a multidimensional paradigm for evaluating \textbf{G}rounding
(cognitive depth), \textbf{A}dequacy (answer completeness),
\textbf{P}erturbation (robustness), and \textbf{S}afety. Critically, we
developed a fully automated, guideline-anchored pipeline to construct a
GAPS-aligned benchmark end-to-end, overcoming the scalability and subjectivity
limitations of prior work. Our pipeline assembles an evidence neighborhood,
creates dual graph and tree representations, and automatically generates
questions across G-levels. Rubrics are synthesized by a DeepResearch agent that
mimics GRADE-consistent, PICO-driven evidence review in a ReAct loop. Scoring
is performed by an ensemble of large language model (LLM) judges. Validation
confirmed our automated questions are high-quality and align with clinician
judgment. Evaluating state-of-the-art models on the benchmark revealed key
failure modes: performance degrades sharply with increased reasoning depth
(G-axis), models struggle with answer completeness (A-axis), and they are
highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations (P-axis) as well as certain
safety issues (S-axis). This automated, clinically-grounded approach provides a
reproducible and scalable method for rigorously evaluating AI clinician systems
and guiding their development toward safer, more reliable clinical practice.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估聊天助手网络搜索行为的新方法，重点关注来源可信度和回答与引用来源的关联性。通过对GPT-4o、GPT-5、Perplexity和Qwen Chat在100个错误信息易发话题上的测试，发现各助手表现差异明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着聊天助手集成网络搜索功能，虽然能提供更可靠的答案，但也存在放大低可信度来源错误信息的风险。需要系统评估助手在事实核查行为中的表现。

Method: 使用100个涉及五个错误信息易发话题的主张，评估GPT-4o、GPT-5、Perplexity和Qwen Chat四个聊天助手，重点关注来源可信度和回答与引用来源的关联性。

Result: 发现各助手表现存在差异：Perplexity获得最高的来源可信度，而GPT-4o在敏感话题上引用了更多非可信来源。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次对常用聊天助手的事实核查行为进行了系统比较，为在高风险信息环境中评估AI系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Chat assistants increasingly integrate web search functionality, enabling
them to retrieve and cite external sources. While this promises more reliable
answers, it also raises the risk of amplifying misinformation from
low-credibility sources. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology for
evaluating assistants' web search behavior, focusing on source credibility and
the groundedness of responses with respect to cited sources. Using 100 claims
across five misinformation-prone topics, we assess GPT-4o, GPT-5, Perplexity,
and Qwen Chat. Our findings reveal differences between the assistants, with
Perplexity achieving the highest source credibility, whereas GPT-4o exhibits
elevated citation of non-credibility sources on sensitive topics. This work
provides the first systematic comparison of commonly used chat assistants for
fact-checking behavior, offering a foundation for evaluating AI systems in
high-stakes information environments.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于前馈网络激活的置信度估计方法，用于检索增强生成系统，在金融客服场景中优于基线方法并保持低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如金融和医疗中，错误答案的代价远高于不回答问题，因此需要准确的置信度估计来确保LLM输出的可靠性。

Method: 利用原始前馈网络激活作为自回归信号进行置信度预测，将其建模为序列分类任务，并使用Huber损失正则化训练以提高对噪声监督的鲁棒性。

Result: 在金融行业客服场景中，该方法优于强基线模型，在严格延迟约束下保持高准确率，仅使用第16层激活即可保持精度同时降低响应延迟。

Conclusion: 基于激活的置信度建模为可信赖的RAG部署提供了一条可扩展、架构感知的路径。

Abstract: We propose a method for confidence estimation in retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) systems that aligns closely with the correctness of large
language model (LLM) outputs. Confidence estimation is especially critical in
high-stakes domains such as finance and healthcare, where the cost of an
incorrect answer outweighs that of not answering the question. Our approach
extends prior uncertainty quantification methods by leveraging raw feed-forward
network (FFN) activations as auto-regressive signals, avoiding the information
loss inherent in token logits and probabilities after projection and softmax
normalization. We model confidence prediction as a sequence classification
task, and regularize training with a Huber loss term to improve robustness
against noisy supervision. Applied in a real-world financial industry
customer-support setting with complex knowledge bases, our method outperforms
strong baselines and maintains high accuracy under strict latency constraints.
Experiments on Llama 3.1 8B model show that using activations from only the
16th layer preserves accuracy while reducing response latency. Our results
demonstrate that activation-based confidence modeling offers a scalable,
architecture-aware path toward trustworthy RAG deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有初步证据表明大规模训练的语言模型可能自发出现符号接地现象，但这种现象的具体发生位置和驱动机制仍不清楚，需要系统性的研究框架来探索。

Method: 引入受控评估框架，通过机制分析和因果分析，系统追踪符号接地在模型内部计算中的出现，分析不同层级的计算贡献。

Result: 发现接地现象集中在模型的中层计算，通过注意力头聚合环境基础来支持语言形式预测，这种现象在多模态对话和不同架构中都能复现，但在单向LSTM中未出现。

Conclusion: 研究提供了行为和机制证据，表明符号接地可以在语言模型中自发出现，这对预测和控制生成可靠性具有实际意义。

Abstract: Symbol grounding (Harnad, 1990) describes how symbols such as words acquire
their meanings by connecting to real-world sensorimotor experiences. Recent
work has shown preliminary evidence that grounding may emerge in
(vision-)language models trained at scale without using explicit grounding
objectives. Yet, the specific loci of this emergence and the mechanisms that
drive it remain largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce a
controlled evaluation framework that systematically traces how symbol grounding
arises within the internal computations through mechanistic and causal
analysis. Our findings show that grounding concentrates in middle-layer
computations and is implemented through the aggregate mechanism, where
attention heads aggregate the environmental ground to support the prediction of
linguistic forms. This phenomenon replicates in multimodal dialogue and across
architectures (Transformers and state-space models), but not in unidirectional
LSTMs. Our results provide behavioral and mechanistic evidence that symbol
grounding can emerge in language models, with practical implications for
predicting and potentially controlling the reliability of generation.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过训练学习压缩KV缓存的方法，使用专用标记定期压缩生成过程中的键值缓存，以解决长上下文推理中内存和计算成本线性增长的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在长上下文推理中的可扩展性受到Transformer键值缓存线性增长的严重限制，导致显著的内存和计算成本。随着模型生成推理标记，过去生成标记的信息价值会减少，这为压缩创造了机会。

Method: 提出定期使用学习的专用标记压缩生成KV缓存并清除压缩条目。通过改进的联合蒸馏和强化学习框架训练模型执行这种压缩，利用RL输出来进行蒸馏，最小化传统RL过程的开销。

Result: 经验证明，该方法在内存-准确性帕累托边界上优于无缓存压缩的模型和无训练压缩技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了长上下文推理中KV缓存线性增长带来的可扩展性问题，通过训练学习压缩机制实现了更好的内存效率与准确性平衡。

Abstract: The scalability of large language models for long-context reasoning is
severely constrained by the linear growth of their Transformer key-value cache,
which incurs significant memory and computational costs. We posit that as a
model generates reasoning tokens, the informational value of past generated
tokens diminishes, creating an opportunity for compression. In this work, we
propose to periodically compress the generation KV cache with a learned,
special-purpose token and evict compressed entries. We train the model to
perform this compression via a modified joint distillation and reinforcement
learning (RL) framework. Our training method minimizes overhead over the
conventional RL process, as it leverages RL outputs for distillation.
Empirically, our method achieves a superior memory-accuracy Pareto frontier
compared to both the model without cache compression and training-free
compression techniques.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BRIEF-Pro是一种轻量级压缩器，用于从检索文档中提取相关证据生成简洁摘要，以提升RAG系统在处理复杂多跳问题时的性能，同时降低延迟和计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着RAG处理复杂任务时上下文不断扩大，虽然提供了更丰富的信息，但也带来了更高的延迟和模型认知负担。特别是在处理复杂多跳问题时，这一瓶颈尤为明显。

Method: 使用相对较短的上下文（少于1k词）作为种子数据，训练BRIEF-Pro对超过10k词的扩展上下文进行抽象压缩，并允许用户灵活控制摘要长度。

Result: 在四个开放域多跳问答数据集上的实验表明，BRIEF-Pro能生成更简洁相关的摘要，提升小型、大型和专有语言模型的性能。使用70B阅读器模型时，32倍压缩比LongLLMLingua的9倍压缩在QA性能上平均提升4.67%，而计算开销仅需其23%。

Conclusion: BRIEF-Pro是一种通用轻量级压缩器，能有效解决RAG系统中长上下文带来的延迟和认知负担问题，显著提升多跳问答性能并降低计算成本。

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) tackles complex tasks, increasingly
expanded contexts offer richer information, but at the cost of higher latency
and increased cognitive load on the model. To mitigate this bottleneck,
especially for intricate multi-hop questions, we introduce BRIEF-Pro. It is a
universal, lightweight compressor that distills relevant evidence for a given
query from retrieved documents into a concise summary for seamless integration
into in-context RAG. Using seed data consisting of relatively short contexts
(fewer than 1k words), BRIEF-Pro is trained to perform abstractive compression
of extended contexts exceeding 10k words across a wide range of scenarios.
Furthermore, BRIEF-Pro offers flexible user control over summary length by
allowing users to specify the desired number of sentences. Experiments on four
open-domain multi-hop question-answering datasets show that BRIEF-Pro generates
more concise and relevant summaries, enhancing performance across small, large,
and proprietary language models. With the 70B reader model, 32x compression by
BRIEF-Pro improves QA performance by 4.67% on average over LongLLMLingua's 9x,
while requiring only 23% of its computational overhead.

TL;DR: SimULi是一种实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，解决了现有神经渲染方法在自动驾驶测试中的局限性，包括渲染速度慢、不支持高畸变镜头和LiDAR数据，以及跨传感器不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法（如NeRF和3DGS）渲染速度慢，仅支持针孔相机模型，无法满足自动驾驶测试中高畸变镜头和LiDAR数据的需求，且存在跨传感器不一致性问题。

Method: 扩展3DGUT支持复杂相机模型，通过自动分块策略支持任意旋转LiDAR模型和基于光线的剔除，设计因子化3D高斯表示和锚定策略解决跨传感器不一致性。

Result: 相比现有方法，相机和深度误差降低达40%，渲染速度比光线追踪方法快10-20倍，比现有基于光栅化方法快1.5-10倍，在两个自动驾驶数据集上达到或超过最先进方法的保真度。

Conclusion: SimULi是首个能够实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，显著提升了自动驾驶模拟测试的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术AI研究主要关注理解当前事件而非预测未来，缺乏统一的短期和长期预测方法，且现有方法难以泛化到不同手术场景。

Method: 采用状态变化学习框架，通过Sinkhorn-Knopp聚类将视频压缩为状态表示，使用教师-学生架构和Action Dynamics模块预测未来状态。

Result: 在四个数据集和三种手术程序上的实验显示一致改进，跨程序迁移验证了方法的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SurgFUTR为手术未来预测提供了统一且可泛化的解决方案，通过状态变化学习有效预测手术事件。

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出TMPS框架，通过目标感知度量学习和优先采样，仅使用少量目标域样本就能显著提升植物病害诊断模型在未知环境下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习植物病害诊断系统在训练环境外的图像上表现不佳，主要原因是疾病症状的细微变化和领域差异，以及训练数据多样性不足。

Method: TMPS框架基于度量学习，利用少量目标域标注样本，通过目标感知的度量学习和优先采样策略来提升模型泛化能力。

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像的大规模数据集上测试，仅使用每疾病10个目标域样本，TMPS相比基线模型平均宏F1分数分别提升7.3和3.6个百分点，相比传统度量学习提升18.7和17.1个百分点。

Conclusion: TMPS是一种简单而高效的学习框架，能够显著提升植物病害诊断模型在未知环境下的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型依赖标记图像数据集的限制，充分利用大量未标记图像数据，为视觉语言任务提供零标签适应的实用起点。

Method: 提出统一视觉语言对齐框架，在训练过程中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，无需依赖人工或合成标注数据集。

Result: 在SmolVLM-Base和Qwen2-VL上应用ViZer，观察到一致的定性改进，生成的描述比基线更贴近实际且更具描述性。

Conclusion: ViZer为视觉语言模型提供了一种有效的零标签学习方案，能够在不依赖文本标签的情况下提升图像描述质量。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

TL;DR: FetalMind是针对胎儿超声的医疗AI系统，通过临床工作流引导的显著认知解耦方法，解决了胎儿超声中多视图推理、疾病多样性和图像异质性的挑战，在报告生成和诊断任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗视觉语言模型主要针对结构化成人影像，在胎儿超声领域表现不佳，面临多视图图像推理、疾病种类繁多和图像多样性等挑战。

Method: 提出显著认知解耦(SED)方法，将专家构建的二部图注入模型，解耦视图-疾病关联，通过强化学习引导临床步骤选择，缓解疾病变异性和视图异质性。

Result: FetalMind在所有孕周阶段均优于开源和闭源基线模型，平均提升14%，在关键病症上准确率提高61.2%，同时保持高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Conclusion: FetalMind通过临床工作流引导的SED方法，成功解决了胎儿超声的独特挑战，建立了首个大规模胎儿超声报告数据集，为胎儿超声AI系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [83] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5是一个用于SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的采样器级引导堆栈，通过ZeResFDG模块统一频率解耦引导、能量重缩放和零投影技术，结合轻量级频谱EMA和QSilk微纹理稳定器，在无需重新训练的情况下提升图像清晰度、提示符遵循度和伪影控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型在采样过程中存在的细节丢失、伪影问题和提示符遵循度不足的挑战，通过采样器级引导技术在不重新训练模型的情况下提升生成质量。

Method: 核心模块ZeResFDG结合了频率解耦引导（重加权高低频分量）、能量重缩放（匹配引导预测幅度）和零投影（移除无条件方向分量）。使用轻量级频谱EMA在采样过程中切换保守和细节寻求模式，并采用QSilk微纹理稳定器进行推理时稳定化处理。

Result: 在SD/SDXL采样器上，ZeResFDG在中等引导尺度下显著改善了图像锐度、提示符遵循度和伪影控制，QSilk稳定器提高了鲁棒性并在高分辨率下产生自然的高频微纹理。

Conclusion: CADE 2.5提供了一种无需重新训练的有效方法，通过采样器级引导技术显著提升了SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的生成质量，特别是在细节增强和稳定性方面表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

TL;DR: SCOPE是一个混合编码器框架，通过实例级路由动态选择最适合每个图像-文本对的专用编码器，相比传统堆叠编码器方法，在减少24-49%计算量的同时获得更好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视觉编码器的视觉语言模型通常简单堆叠编码器，导致收益递减而推理成本倍增。需要更智能的编码器选择机制来平衡性能和效率。

Method: 提出SCOPE框架，包含共享编码器和路由编码器池。轻量级路由器通过文本提示与共享视觉特征的交叉注意力来选择最优编码器，使用双熵正则化和辅助损失来训练路由器。

Result: 仅使用1个共享编码器加1个路由编码器的SCOPE模型，优于同时使用所有4个额外编码器的模型，同时减少24-49%的计算量。

Conclusion: 智能编码器选择优于暴力聚合，挑战了多编码器视觉语言模型的主流范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了时空视频动作定位（SVAG）新任务，需要同时检测、跟踪和时间定位视频中基于自然语言描述动作的所有相关对象。构建了SVAG-Bench基准数据集和SVAGFormer基线框架，实验显示现有模型在密集复杂场景中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解方法主要解决粗粒度动作识别或通用目标跟踪，忽视了基于动作联合检测和跟踪多个对象并对其进行时间定位的挑战。

Method: 提出SVAGFormer基线框架，适配最先进的视觉语言模型进行联合空间和时间定位，并开发SVAGEval标准化评估工具包。

Result: 构建了包含688个视频、19,590条标注记录和903个独特动词的大规模基准SVAG-Bench。实证结果显示现有模型在SVAG任务上表现不佳，特别是在密集或复杂场景中。

Conclusion: 需要在长视频中对细粒度对象-动作交互进行更高级的推理，现有方法在联合时空动作定位方面存在明显不足。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

TL;DR: 提出了SeqBench基准测试，用于评估文本到视频生成中的序列叙事连贯性，包含320个提示和2560个人工标注视频，并设计了基于动态时序图的自动评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型在创建视觉吸引人的视频方面取得进展，但在生成需要多个事件逻辑推进的连贯序列叙事方面存在困难，且现有基准主要关注视觉质量指标，无法评估长序列的叙事连贯性。

Method: 开发了SeqBench基准测试，包含精心设计的320个提示数据集，涵盖各种叙事复杂度；设计了基于动态时序图的自动评估指标，能有效捕捉长程依赖和时间顺序，同时保持计算效率。

Result: 基于DTG的指标与人工标注显示出强相关性；系统评估揭示了当前T2V模型的关键局限性：在多动作序列中无法保持一致的物体状态、多物体场景中产生物理上不合理的结果、难以保持顺序动作之间的现实时间关系和排序关系。

Conclusion: SeqBench为评估T2V生成中的叙事连贯性提供了首个系统框架，并为改进未来模型的序列推理能力提供了具体见解。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

TL;DR: SceneAdapt框架通过两个适应阶段（中间帧生成和场景感知中间帧生成）将场景感知注入文本条件运动模型，利用不相关的场景-运动和文本-运动数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动生成方法要么关注运动语义，要么关注场景感知，但无法同时处理两者，因为构建同时包含丰富文本-运动覆盖和精确场景交互的大规模数据集极具挑战性。

Method: 使用运动中间帧生成作为代理任务来桥接两个不同的数据集。第一阶段引入关键帧层来调制运动潜在空间进行中间帧生成；第二阶段添加场景条件层，通过交叉注意力自适应查询局部上下文来注入场景几何信息。

Result: 实验结果表明SceneAdapt有效地将场景感知注入文本到运动模型中，并分析了这种感知出现的机制。

Conclusion: SceneAdapt框架成功解决了同时处理运动语义和场景感知的挑战，通过创新的两阶段适应方法实现了场景感知的文本到运动生成。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在处理长序列心电图信号时性能有限，需要更有效的序列建模方法来提升心电图异常检测的准确性。

Method: 开发了1D-CNN-ECG-Mamba混合框架，结合卷积特征提取和Mamba选择性状态空间模型，基于Vision Mamba双向变体增强时间依赖性表示。

Conclusion: 基于Mamba的架构在可靠的心电图分类方面具有巨大潜力，支持早期诊断和个性化治疗，同时提升远程医疗和资源受限医疗系统的可及性。

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是第一个无需几何先验、能够实现真正新颖视图合成的自监督模型，通过成对姿态估计和输入输出增强方案，实现了相机姿态与场景内容的解耦，并在无约束潜在姿态变量的情况下实现了可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督新颖视图合成方法预测的姿态缺乏可迁移性，即相同的姿态集在不同3D场景中会产生不同的相机轨迹，这限制了模型的真实能力。

Method: 结合成对姿态估计与输入输出增强方案，无需3D归纳偏置或多视图几何概念，使用无约束潜在姿态变量实现相机姿态与场景内容的解耦。

Result: XFactor在可迁移性方面显著优于先前的无姿态NVS变换器，潜在姿态与真实世界姿态高度相关，并通过大规模实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: XFactor证明了无需显式3D几何先验即可实现真正的新颖视图合成，为自监督3D理解提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将梯度压缩为幅度会丢失方向信息，导致监督模糊和边缘保真度不佳。

Method: 引入方向感知的多尺度梯度损失，分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量，并在多尺度上保留其符号。

Result: 实验表明该方法能提升边缘清晰度、对齐度和纹理保留效果，无需改变模型架构或训练协议。

Conclusion: 方向感知的梯度损失为图像融合提供了更清晰的方向指导，显著提升了融合质量。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对医学图像分割的无监督域适应框架，专门解决MRI海马体分割中的域偏移问题，特别是内容变异，通过结合风格标准化和双向可变形图像配准来提升跨域分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割模型在不同数据集间部署时面临域偏移挑战，包括图像外观（风格）和群体解剖特征（内容）的变异，这限制了模型在临床实践中的泛化能力。

Method: 结合高效的z-标准化风格协调和双向可变形图像配准策略，配准网络与分割网络和判别器网络联合训练，生成解剖学上合理的变换以对齐源图像和目标域。

Result: 在合成数据集和三个MRI海马体数据集上的实验表明，该方法在所有实验中均优于现有基线。从健康年轻人群迁移到临床痴呆患者时，Dice分数相对标准增强方法提升高达15%，在内容偏移显著的情况下效果最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对不同群体间的海马体分割任务，特别是在存在显著内容变异时表现出优越性能，为跨域医学图像分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

Motivation: 扩散模型经常产生与现实世界知识冲突的幻觉样本，但缺乏系统量化这些幻觉的方法，阻碍了解决这一挑战的进展。

Method: 构建包含ToyShape、SimObject和RealHand的CountHalluSet数据集套件，开发标准化评估协议，系统分析不同采样条件（求解器类型、ODE求解器阶数、采样步数、初始噪声）对计数幻觉的影响。

Result: 发现FID等常用图像质量指标无法一致地捕捉计数幻觉，不同采样条件显著影响计数幻觉水平。

Conclusion: 这是系统量化扩散模型中幻觉现象的第一步，为研究图像生成中的幻觉现象提供了新见解。

Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress
in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法存在计算开销高、内存消耗大、视觉保真度差的问题，导致时间不一致性和伪影。

Method: 引入时空特征记忆库缓存特征，提出特征最相似传播方法保持时间一致性，使用交叉注意力图自动提取感兴趣实例的掩码。

Result: 在效率和视觉保真度方面优于现有最先进方法，验证了其优越的有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: Edit-Your-Interest通过创新的时空特征管理和传播机制，实现了高效、高质量的文本驱动视频编辑。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: 提出了EgoSocial数据集和EgoSoD方法，用于解决AR/VR环境中AI助手在社交互动中干预时机判断的问题，显著提升了社交感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM缺乏从自我中心视角理解人类社交动态的能力，无法判断何时应该作为AI助手进行干预，导致频繁且不合时宜的回应，干扰自然对话和用户专注度。

Method: 构建了包含13,500个社交视频-问题对的大规模数据集EgoSocial，并提出EgoSoD方法，通过整合多模态上下文线索（音频和视觉）到社交思维图中，动态建模参与者和互动。

Result: 实验显示现有OLLM在干预时机检测上表现不佳（Gemini 2.5 Pro仅14.4%），而EgoSoD方法将Phi-4的干预时机性能提升45.6%，Gemini 2.5 Pro提升9.9%；社交互动整体性能分别提升20.4%和6.9%。

Conclusion: EgoSoD方法能够主动检测干预时机和社交互动，精确决定何时干预，为解决AR/VR环境中AI社交感知不足问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

TL;DR: DriveCritic是一个新的自动驾驶规划器评估框架，包含数据集和基于视觉语言模型的评估器，通过两阶段学习显著优于现有指标，提供更符合人类判断的评估基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动驾驶评估指标（如EPDMS）在复杂场景中缺乏上下文感知能力，难以与人类判断保持一致，需要更可靠的评估方法。

Method: 提出DriveCritic框架：1）构建包含关键上下文场景的数据集，标注人类偏好；2）开发基于视觉语言模型的评估器，采用监督学习和强化学习两阶段训练，整合视觉和符号上下文进行轨迹对判断。

Result: 实验表明DriveCritic在匹配人类偏好方面显著优于现有指标和基线方法，展现出强大的上下文感知能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为评估自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠、与人类判断更一致的基础框架。

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

TL;DR: VPreg是一种新的微分同胚图像配准方法，通过变分原理生成无折叠网格，确保空间变换的正雅可比行列式，并在微分同胚群中提供精确的逆变换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有的网格生成和微分同胚图像配准方法，在保证配准精度的同时控制变换质量，提供准确的逆变换，这对神经影像工作流程至关重要。

Method: 使用变分原理(VP)网格生成方法，构建具有指定雅可比行列度和旋度的无折叠网格，确保微分同胚空间变换。

Result: 在OASIS-1数据集的150个脑部扫描配准测试中，VPreg在35个感兴趣区域的Dice分数、变换规律性以及逆映射的准确性和一致性方面优于ANTs-SyN、Freesurfer-Easyreg和FSL-Fnirt等最先进方法。

Conclusion: VPreg在图像配准精度、变换质量和逆变换准确性方面都优于现有方法，为计算解剖学和形态计量学提供了可靠的微分同胚空间变换。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大语言模型开放语义知识的文本-图像对齐方法，通过增强文本模态的信息熵和使用超图适配器构建多边连接，显著提升了跨模态检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本和图像模态间信息熵差异导致的跨模态检索不平衡问题，利用大语言模型的开放语义知识来填补熵差，模拟人类在跨模态对齐任务中的能力。

Method: 1) 设计不依赖任务域显式知识的提示模板，利用LLM增强文本模态的多义性描述，提高文本相对于视觉模态的信息熵；2) 使用超图适配器构建文本和图像模态间的多边连接，在固定嵌入空间中纠正同义语义的正负匹配错误，同时通过降维映射减少开放语义熵带来的噪声。

Conclusion: 通过结合大语言模型的开放语义知识和超图适配器，有效解决了跨模态检索中的信息熵不平衡问题，显著提升了文本-图像对齐性能，为多媒体内容理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that
context-dependent architecture selection is crucial for practical
implementation.This project provides professional benchmarks for developing
assistive technologies, highlighting trade-offs between recognition precision
and real-time operational requirements in edge computing environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习去噪模型大多基于模拟数据或单一真实场景训练，忽略了不同地理区域噪声特性的显著差异，导致模型在新环境中性能下降。

Method: 通过字典学习将TEM信号的内在物理特性（如指数衰减和平滑性）编码为字典驱动先验，在训练时融入模型，在测试时通过最小化基于字典一致性和信号一阶变化的自监督损失来动态适应新环境。

Result: 大量实验结果表明，该方法比现有的TEM去噪方法和TTA方法取得了更好的性能。

Conclusion: 利用TEM信号的内在物理特性作为先验知识，结合测试时自适应策略，可以有效提升模型在不同地理环境下的去噪性能。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Conclusion: 所提出的STT-GS框架有效解决了边缘高斯泼溅中的资源分配问题，通过智能采样和优先级分配策略实现了高质量场景重建。

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing
training costs, CIGOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

Conclusion: MimicParts通过分区感知方法有效解决了语音驱动3D人体运动生成中的风格多样性和动态适应问题

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

Motivation: 工业表面缺陷检测面临极端的前景-背景不平衡、缺陷稀疏性、长尾尺度分布和低对比度等问题，传统像素中心训练方法容易受大块均匀区域主导，难以关注小尺寸或低对比度缺陷，导致样本级决策稳定性不足。

Method: 基于共享编码器架构的多任务学习框架，联合学习样本级缺陷分类和像素级掩码定位。样本级监督调节特征分布，在梯度层面持续提升小尺寸和低对比度缺陷的召回率，分割分支保留边界和形状细节以增强决策稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出的样本中心多任务学习框架和评估指标有效解决了工业缺陷检测中优化目标与质量控制决策粒度不匹配的问题，提升了检测系统的实际部署价值。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

TL;DR: UniVector是一个统一的矢量提取框架，通过实例-几何交互机制在单一模型中提取多种矢量类型（多边形、折线、线段），解决了现有方法需要为不同结构使用单独模型的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有矢量提取方法通常针对单一矢量类型设计，需要为不同结构使用单独模型，这源于将实例属性（类别、结构）和几何属性（点坐标、连接）独立处理，限制了捕捉复杂结构的能力。

Method: UniVector将矢量编码为包含实例和几何信息的结构化查询，通过交互模块迭代更新实现跨层级上下文交换，并使用动态形状约束来优化全局结构和关键点。

Result: 实验表明UniVector在单结构和多结构矢量提取任务上都达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: UniVector通过统一的实例-几何交互框架成功解决了多类型矢量提取问题，为矢量提取领域提供了更高效和通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EPIPTrack是一个统一的多模态视觉语言跟踪框架，通过显式和隐式提示进行动态目标建模和语义对齐，在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有跟踪器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖大型语言模型的静态文本描述，缺乏对实时目标状态变化的适应性且容易产生幻觉，需要更动态的多模态跟踪方法。

Method: 使用显式提示将空间运动信息转换为自然语言描述提供时空指导，隐式提示结合伪词和可学习描述符构建个性化知识表示，通过CLIP文本编码器进行动态调整，并设计判别性特征增强器提升视觉和跨模态表示。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack数据集上的大量实验表明，EPIPTrack在多样化场景中优于现有跟踪器，展现出强大的适应性和优越性能。

Conclusion: EPIPTrack通过动态多模态提示机制有效解决了静态文本描述的局限性，为多目标跟踪提供了更鲁棒和自适应的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了针对视觉-语言-动作(VLA)模型的对抗性补丁攻击(EDPA)及相应防御策略。EDPA是一种模型无关的攻击方法，通过在相机视野中放置对抗补丁来破坏VLA模型的语义对齐和潜在表示，导致任务失败。同时提出了对抗性微调防御方案来缓解这种攻击。


<details>

Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在机器人学习中取得了革命性进展，但其对抗鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究VLA模型的对抗脆弱性，并提出相应的攻击和防御方法。

Method: 提出了EDPA攻击方法：1)破坏视觉和文本潜在表示的语义对齐；2)最大化对抗样本和干净样本潜在表示的差异。同时提出了对抗性微调防御方案，优化视觉编码器使其对干净和对抗样本产生相似的潜在表示。

Result: 在LIBERO机器人仿真基准上的广泛评估表明，EDPA显著提高了最先进VLA模型的任务失败率，而提出的防御方法有效缓解了这种性能下降。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了VLA模型的对抗脆弱性，提出的EDPA攻击方法具有模型无关性且易于部署，同时提出的对抗性微调防御方案能够有效提升VLA模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at
https://edpa-attack.github.io/.

Conclusion: FlyAwareV2通过其丰富的标注集和环境多样性，为无人机应用中的城市场景理解研究提供了重要的数据集支持。

Abstract: The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) applications in urban environments heavily relies on the availability of
large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,
depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including
varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research
on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

Motivation: 室外3D语义场景生成在自动驾驶等应用中很重要，但缺乏公开的、标注良好的数据集限制了该领域的发展。

Method: 提出了Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff)方法，通过施加结构化空间排序、明确捕捉圆柱连续性和垂直层次结构，保持物理邻域关系和全局上下文。

Result: 在SketchSem3D上的广泛实验表明，CymbaDiff在语义一致性、空间真实性和跨数据集泛化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: SketchSem3D基准和CymbaDiff方法为室外3D语义场景生成提供了标准化评估和有效解决方案。

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

TL;DR: 提出一种超实时人群计数模型，采用stem-encoder-decoder结构，在嵌入式系统上实现最快推理速度，同时保持竞争力精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有人群计数方法在嵌入式系统应用中存在模型参数过多、计算复杂等问题，而嵌入式系统需要实时性强的模型。

Method: 使用stem-encoder-decoder结构：stem网络采用大卷积核扩大感受野；编码器使用条件通道加权和多分支局部融合块低计算量融合多尺度特征；顶部添加特征金字塔网络缓解不完全融合问题。

Result: 在三个基准测试上验证了模型适用于嵌入式系统超实时人群计数，推理速度最快：NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti上381.7 FPS，NVIDIA Jetson TX1上71.9 FPS。

Conclusion: 该网络实现了超实时人群计数，在嵌入式系统上具有最快的推理速度，同时保证了竞争力的精度。

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

TL;DR: 本研究通过机制可解释性技术分析了VideoLLMs的内部信息流，揭示了时间推理的四个关键模式：早期到中间层的跨帧交互、中间层的视频-语言整合、中间到后期层的答案生成，以及通过选择有效信息路径可以保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管VideoLLMs在视频问答方面取得了进展，但其内部如何提取和传播视频与文本信息的机制仍未被充分探索。本研究旨在揭示VideoLLMs的内部信息流模式。

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术分析VideoLLMs的内部信息流，研究不同VideoQA任务中的一致模式。

Result: 发现四个一致模式：早期到中间层的跨帧交互、中间层的视频-语言整合、中间到后期层的答案生成，以及通过选择有效信息路径可以保持性能（如在LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT中抑制58%的注意力边）。

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解VideoLLMs如何执行时间推理提供了蓝图，并为改进模型可解释性和下游泛化提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端多模态模型使用不同的编码器和解码器处理输入输出信息，这种分离阻碍了多模态的联合表示学习。

Method: 使用基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一的变分自编码器逐步生成和精炼模态特定信息。

Result: 在图像生成、图像描述、视觉问答、文本理解和推理任务中，MDM显著优于现有端到端模型，并能与GPT-4V、Gemini Pro等SOTA模型竞争。

Conclusion: MDM有效统一了多模态处理过程，同时保持计算效率，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

Motivation: 现有评估主要关注纯文本领域的长上下文忠实度，而多模态评估仅限于短上下文，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了包含8个任务、跨越6个上下文长度区间的MMLongCite基准，涵盖文本、图像和视频等多种模态。

Result: 评估显示最先进的大视觉语言模型在处理长多模态上下文时的忠实度有限，并深入分析了上下文长度和关键内容位置对模型忠实度的影响。

Conclusion: 需要开发能够有效处理长多模态上下文的更忠实的大视觉语言模型。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

TL;DR: 提出MaskDCPT预训练方法，通过掩码退化分类促进图像恢复任务，结合分类和重建双解码器设计，在多种退化类型上实现显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法在图像恢复任务中存在局限性，需要一种能够同时处理多种退化类型并具有强泛化能力的预训练方法。

Method: 使用编码器-双解码器架构：编码器提取掩码低质量图像特征，分类解码器识别退化类型，重建解码器恢复高质量图像，结合掩码图像建模和对比学习。

Result: 在5D全合一恢复任务中PSNR至少提升3.77dB，真实场景中PIQE降低34.8%，对未见过的退化类型和级别表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaskDCPT为通用图像恢复提供了有效的预训练方案，显著提升了CNN和Transformer的性能，并发布了包含250万样本的UIR-2.5M数据集。

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at

[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about

the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document

Result: 在3D和2D NCD语义分割上的大量实验和可视化结果证明了该方法的优越性。

Conclusion: 通过因果表示学习和推理，能够有效解决点云分割中的新类发现问题，提高分割精度。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法（如COLMAP、GLOMAP）在CPU上运行束调整和全局定位时计算开销大，而基于深度学习的SfM方法（如VGGSfM、VGGT）在处理大规模输入时GPU内存消耗急剧增加。

Method: 利用GPU并行计算加速标准SfM管线的每个关键阶段，基于稀疏感知束调整优化技术，在统一的全局SfM框架中同时加速BA和GP。

Result: 在不同规模数据集上的实验表明，该方法比COLMAP快约40倍，同时保持相当甚至更好的重建精度，能够处理5000张图像的大规模场景。

Conclusion: 该方法成功释放了GPU并行计算的潜力，解决了SfM在大规模场景下的精度与速度权衡问题。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

### [121] [Self-Augmented Visual Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13315)
*Eun Woo Im,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种新的训练自由解码策略，通过自增强提示和自适应阈值算法来减少大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，显著提高事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉对比解码方法使用通用的视觉增强，忽略了文本查询的具体上下文，限制了其有效性。

Method: 1. 自增强提示策略：利用模型内在知识动态对齐查询和视觉增强的语义；2. 自适应阈值算法：基于输出稀疏性自适应调整下一个令牌候选大小。

Result: 在4个LVLM和7个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法相比最先进的解码方法显著提高了事实一致性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了整合查询依赖增强和熵感知解码对于改进LVLM有效生成的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探索大型多模态模型（特别是GPT-4o）对视觉趣味性概念的理解能力，通过比较分析发现GPT-4o与人类评估存在部分对齐，并利用其标注能力训练学习排序模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 日常生活中人们的注意力被所见所闻高度影响，理解视觉趣味性对于吸引和保持注意力至关重要。随着大型多模态模型的发展，研究者希望探索这些模型是否能够捕捉视觉趣味性概念。

Method: 通过比较分析人类评估与GPT-4o预测的对齐程度，利用GPT-4o标注图像对的趣味性，并将这些标注数据用于训练学习排序模型。

Result: 研究发现GPT-4o与人类在视觉趣味性评估上存在部分对齐，且其表现优于现有最先进方法，能够有效标注图像对的趣味性。

Conclusion: 这项研究为深入理解人类兴趣铺平了道路，展示了大型多模态模型在捕捉视觉趣味性概念方面的潜力。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

### [123] [Removing Cost Volumes from Optical Flow Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13317)
*Simon Kiefhaber,Stefan Roth,Simone Schaub-Meyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种训练策略，允许在训练过程中移除光流估计器中的成本体积，显著提高推理速度和减少内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成本体积在现代光流估计器中普遍使用，但其计算和空间复杂度限制了处理速度和输入帧分辨率。经验观察发现，当其他网络部分充分训练后，成本体积的重要性会降低。

Method: 引入一种训练策略，在训练过程中逐步移除成本体积，创建了三种不同计算预算的模型。

Result: 最准确的模型达到最先进精度，速度提高1.2倍，内存占用降低6倍；最快的模型能在500MB GPU内存下以20FPS处理全高清帧。

Conclusion: 该训练策略成功实现了在保持精度的同时显著提升光流估计的效率和资源利用率。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

TL;DR: 提出了DEF-YOLO模型和TICW数据集，用于热成像中的隐蔽武器检测，通过可变形卷积和多尺度特征提取解决热成像中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐蔽武器检测技术存在分辨率低、隐私问题等限制，需要开发实时、低成本、保护隐私的解决方案。

Method: 基于YOLOv8构建DEF-YOLO架构，在SPPF层使用可变形卷积提取多尺度特征，在骨干网络和颈部网络提取低、中、高级特征，并采用焦点损失解决类别不平衡问题。

Result: 建立了首个大规模热成像隐蔽武器检测数据集TICW，并通过实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为热成像隐蔽武器检测建立了新的基准，在保持速度的同时提高了检测性能。

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Group-VQ方法，通过分组优化码本解决VQ-VAE中的码本塌陷问题，同时引入训练后码本重采样技术实现码本大小的灵活调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQ-VAE存在码本塌陷问题，现有方法使用隐式静态码本或联合优化整个码本，限制了码本学习能力并降低了重建质量。

Method: Group-VQ进行分组优化码本，每组独立优化但组内联合优化，同时提出无需训练的码本重采样方法。

Result: 在各种图像重建实验中，Group-VQ在重建指标上表现更优，码本重采样方法实现了码本大小调整的灵活性。

Conclusion: Group-VQ改善了码本利用率和重建性能之间的权衡，训练后码本采样提供了所需的码本大小调整灵活性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

*Sipeng Yang,Jiayu Ji,Qingchuan Zhu,Zhiyao Yang,Xiaogang Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个专门针对渲染视频的无参考视频质量评估方法和数据集，解决了现有方法在渲染视频上的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渲染视频与相机拍摄视频存在显著差异，特别是更容易出现时间伪影，现有无参考视频质量评估方法主要针对相机拍摄视频，在渲染视频上会产生偏差预测。

Method: 构建了一个大规模的渲染视频数据集，包含多种3D场景和渲染设置，并设计了专门针对渲染视频的无参考质量评估指标，同时考虑图像质量和时间稳定性。

Result: 提出的方法在渲染视频上表现出优于现有无参考视频质量评估方法的性能，并能有效评估超采样方法和实时渲染中的帧生成策略。

Conclusion: 该研究为渲染视频质量评估提供了专门的解决方案，填补了现有方法的空白，在计算机图形学应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

### [127] [Language as a Label: Zero-Shot Multimodal Classification of Everyday Postures under Data Scarcity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13364)
*MingZe Tang,Jubal Chandy Jacob*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，在视觉语言模型（VLM）的零样本分类中，对于性能最好的模型（MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP），最简单的基础提示词效果最佳，增加描述性细节反而显著降低性能，这种现象被称为"提示词过拟合"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型能够在数据稀缺条件下进行零样本分类，但提示词设计对识别视觉相似类别（如人体姿势）的影响尚未得到充分理解。

Method: 使用285张COCO数据集图像，评估包括OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2和SigLip在内的现代VLM模型，采用三层次提示词设计系统性地增加语言细节。

Result: MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP在简单提示词下获得最佳性能（多类准确率68.8%），增加描述性细节后准确率降至55.1%；而性能较差的SigLip模型在更详细的基于身体线索的提示词下表现更好。

Conclusion: 提示词设计对VLM性能有显著影响，高性能模型倾向于简单提示词，而低性能模型可能从更详细的提示词中受益，揭示了"提示词过拟合"现象。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthVLA是一个增强空间推理能力的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过集成预训练的深度预测模块来提升空间感知能力，在真实世界和模拟环境中都优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在需要精确空间推理的任务上表现不佳，因为它们继承了视觉-语言模型有限的空间推理能力，且需要大量动作数据预训练来在3D空间中定位。

Method: 采用混合变换器设计，统一了视觉-语言模型、深度变换器和动作专家，通过完全共享注意力形成端到端模型，显式整合空间感知能力。

Result: 在真实世界任务中达到78.5%进展（vs 65.0%），在LIBERO模拟器中达到94.9%（vs 93.6%），在Simpler模拟器中达到74.8%（vs 58.8%），均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DepthVLA通过简单有效的架构设计显著提升了VLA模型的空间推理能力，在多种环境中都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合SDF和3DGS的新方法，用于动态场景渲染和重建，无需LiDAR数据和3D运动标注即可实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3DGS的方法需要相机和LiDAR数据、地面真实3D分割和运动数据，限制了应用范围。本文旨在探索如何通过2D对象无关先验来放松这些要求。

Method: 将SDF与3DGS集成，利用两者的优势创建更鲁棒的对象表示。通过统一的优化框架增强3D高斯喷洒的几何精度，改进SDF内的变形建模。

Result: 在城市场景中无需LiDAR数据即可实现最先进的渲染指标性能。加入LiDAR后进一步改善重建和生成新视图的能力，且无需地面真实3D运动标注。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现各种场景编辑任务，包括场景分解和场景组合，为动态场景渲染和重建提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GLSDA框架，利用预训练大模型的语义先验增强WiFi手势识别的泛化能力和语义表达能力，通过双路径CSI编码、多尺度语义编码器、语义感知软监督和鲁棒双蒸馏策略，在Widar3.0基准测试中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有WiFi手势识别方法在泛化性和语义表达能力方面的局限性，由于CSI的领域敏感性以及缺乏高级手势抽象导致的问题。

Method: 1) 双路径CSI编码管道捕获几何和动态手势模式；2) 多尺度语义编码器学习鲁棒时序嵌入并通过跨模态注意力对齐语义；3) 语义感知软监督方案编码类间相关性；4) 鲁棒双蒸馏策略将模型压缩为轻量学生网络。

Result: 在Widar3.0基准测试中，GLSDA在域内和跨域手势识别任务中均优于最先进方法，同时显著减小模型大小和推理延迟。

Conclusion: GLSDA为现实世界AIoT应用中的通用RF手势接口提供了可扩展和可部署的解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，特别是内在动态空间推理这一人类空间认知的基本方面。

Method: 基于认知分类法构建统一基准，开发可扩展的自动化流水线生成多样且可验证的空间推理问题，创建包含评估和训练数据的数据集。

Result: 对28个最先进VLMs的评估显示，当前模型在空间推理能力上与人类存在较大且一致的差距，特别是在多步骤多视图空间推理方面。

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE为未来研究提供了稳健框架、有价值的数据集和明确方向，推动实现类人空间智能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

TL;DR: 提出了Mask-GRPO方法，首次将基于GRPO的强化学习引入被忽视的掩码生成模型范式，在文本到图像生成任务中显著提升了性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要针对扩散模型或自回归模型，忽视了掩码生成模型这一重要替代方案。

Method: 重新定义转移概率，将去掩码过程建模为多步决策问题，采用去除KL约束、应用缩减策略和过滤低质量样本等策略。

Result: 在标准T2I基准测试和偏好对齐方面显著提升了基础模型Show-o的性能，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO成功证明了将强化学习应用于掩码生成模型的有效性，为文本到图像生成提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

*Jianhui Zhang,Sheng Cheng,Qirui Sun,Jia Liu,Wang Luyang,Chaoyu Feng,Chen Fang,Lei Lei,Jue Wang,Shuaicheng Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Patch-Adapter是一个用于高分辨率文本引导图像修复的有效框架，能够实现4K+分辨率，同时保持内容一致性和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于较低分辨率，随着分辨率和纹理复杂度的增加，内容一致性和提示对齐这两个关键挑战变得更加严峻。

Method: 采用两阶段适配器架构：双上下文适配器学习掩码和非掩码区域的连贯性以建立全局结构一致性；参考补丁适配器实现补丁级注意力机制进行全分辨率修复，通过自适应特征融合保持局部细节保真度。

Result: 实验表明Patch-Adapter不仅解决了大规模修复中常见的伪影问题，还在OpenImages和Photo-Concept-Bucket数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在感知质量和文本提示遵循方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该双阶段架构通过解耦全局语义和局部细化，独特地解决了高分辨率修复中的可扩展性差距问题。

Abstract: In this work, we present Patch-Adapter, an effective framework for
high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法假设所有智能体使用相同编码器，但在实际异构部署中不成立。现有方法对领域差异敏感且推理效率低。

Method: 使用轻量级空间通道调整器(LSCR)和基于域分离的分布对齐(DADS)进行特征对齐，结合域对齐互信息(DAMI)损失函数，采用全卷积架构。

Result: CoDS有效缓解了异构场景中的特征差异，在检测精度和推理效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Conclusion: CoDS方法通过域分离策略成功解决了异构协作感知中的特征差异问题，同时保证了模型的高效推理性能。

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种可微分渲染管道，通过优化可变形网格直接在3D空间中获取最大有效图像(MEIs)，用于探索神经元对可解释3D场景属性(如姿态和光照)的选择性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法主要在2D像素上操作，难以分离神经元对物理场景属性的选择性。视觉感知依赖于对3D场景属性(如形状、姿态、光照)的推断，需要表征神经元对这些可解释因素的敏感性。

Method: 引入可微分渲染管道，优化可变形网格获得3D MEIs。使用径向基函数参数化网格变形，学习最大化神经元响应的偏移和尺度，同时强制几何规则性。

Result: 应用于猴子V4区域模型，能够探索神经元对可解释3D因素(如姿态和光照)的选择性。

Conclusion: 该方法将逆向图形学与系统神经科学连接起来，提供了一种超越传统基于像素方法、基于物理基础的3D刺激来探测神经选择性的途径。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

Motivation: 探索近红外高光谱成像技术在食品质量分析中的有效应用方法，比较不同机器学习方法在食品质量参数预测中的性能差异。

Method: 通过四项研究，使用卷积神经网络和偏最小二乘法进行建模分析，包括空间分析、光谱分析以及联合空间光谱分析。

Result: 联合空间光谱分析的CNN模型在相关参数建模中表现最佳；对于化学参数均值分析，PLS方法表现相当且推荐使用；2D CNN增强光谱卷积层能改善化学图谱生成问题。

Conclusion: 近红外高光谱成像结合适当的机器学习方法可用于食品质量分析，但空间分布建模受参考值获取限制，并开发了两个开源Python工具包以促进相关研究。

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

TL;DR: VIST3A是一个文本到3D生成框架，通过将文本到视频生成器与3D重建解码器相结合，解决了知识保持和几何一致性两个关键挑战。


<details>

Motivation: 结合现代潜在文本到视频模型的生成能力和近期3D重建系统的几何能力，创建强大的3D场景生成器。

Method: 使用模型缝合技术连接文本到视频生成器和3D解码器，并通过直接奖励微调确保生成潜变量可解码为一致的3D几何。

Result: 所有测试配对均显著优于之前输出高斯泼溅的文本到3D模型，通过选择合适的3D基础模型还可实现高质量文本到点云生成。

Conclusion: VIST3A框架成功整合了文本到视频生成和3D重建技术，在文本到3D生成方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

Conclusion: 模型具有高度自适应性，可用于开发实际场景中的端到端情绪识别系统，代码和结果已公开。

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

Conclusion: UniME-V2通过利用MLLMs的语义理解能力，有效解决了现有多模态嵌入模型在语义区分和负样本挖掘方面的局限性，显著提升了模型的判别能力和性能表现。

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于动作单元(Action Units)的增量学习方法，用于复杂情感识别，通过利用非瞬态的面部肌肉运动特征来避免灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 增量学习面临灾难性遗忘的挑战，特别是在情感识别任务中，传统特征在不同任务间容易失效。论文旨在模拟人类学习过程，从基础情感逐步学习复杂情感。

Method: 使用动作单元(Action Units)作为非瞬态、高语义特征，这些特征描述了面部肌肉运动，比浅层和深层卷积神经网络提取的特征表现更好。

Result: 在CFEE数据集上，该方法在增量学习复杂复合情感时达到了0.75的准确率，与最先进方法相比具有竞争力，同时模型轻量且内存占用小。

Conclusion: 动作单元作为非瞬态特征在增量学习情感识别中表现优异，能够有效避免灾难性遗忘，实现从基础到复杂情感的渐进学习。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at
https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.

TL;DR: 本文首次比较了GPU和FPGA在视觉SLAM中特征检测的性能，发现非学习型检测器（FAST、Harris）在GPU上表现更好，而学习型检测器（SuperPoint）在FPGA上具有更好的运行性能和能效。


<details>

Motivation: 特征检测是SLAM中耗时且耗能的模块，而GPU和FPGA都是常见的硬件加速器，但缺乏在视觉SLAM管道中的系统比较研究。

Method: 在Nvidia Jetson Orin和AMD Versal等现代SoC上，比较GPU和FPGA加速的FAST、Harris和SuperPoint特征检测器在视觉SLAM管道中的性能。

Result: 非学习型检测器在GPU上表现更优，而学习型检测器SuperPoint在FPGA上可达到3.1倍运行性能提升和1.4倍能效提升。FPGA加速的V-SLAM在部分数据集上帧率更高，但GPU版本精度普遍更好。

Conclusion: 硬件加速特征检测可减少全局束调整调用频率而不损失精度，为不同应用场景下的硬件选择提供了指导：非学习型检测器适合GPU，学习型检测器在FPGA上表现更佳。

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部表情识别评估通常假设同质数据和高质量图像，但实际应用中需要面对文化差异和视觉条件退化的问题，因此需要研究在这些复杂条件下的识别鲁棒性。

Method: 使用基于代理的方法，在冻结的CLIP特征空间中部署轻量级残差适配器，代理在5x5格子上移动交互，环境提供按sigma调度的渐进高斯模糊输入。研究比较了单一文化群体（西方/亚洲）和不同比例混合群体的表现。

Result: 发现文化群体间存在不对称退化曲线：JAFFE（亚洲）群体在低模糊时性能更高但中间阶段下降更陡峭，KDEF（西方）群体退化更均匀。混合群体呈现中间模式，平衡混合缓解早期退化，但不平衡设置在高模糊下放大主流群体的弱点。

Conclusion: 文化构成和交互结构显著影响面部表情识别在感知条件恶化时的鲁棒性，量化了这些因素对系统性能的影响。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

preserve performance under compression and enhance interpretability, we
introduce two knowledge-distillation strategies: an explainability-aligned
distillation that transfers the teacher's saliency structure to the student,
and a depth-distribution distillation that recasts depth regression as soft
classification over discretized bins. Together, these components reduce the MAE
compared with direct training with 7.97% and deliver competitive accuracy with
real-time efficiency on nuScenes and ZJU-4DRadarCam datasets.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal

*Amjid Ali,Zulfiqar Ahmad Khan,Altaf Hussain,Muhammad Munsif,Adnan Hussain,Sung Wook Baik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出AVAR-Net，一种轻量级高效的音视频异常识别框架，通过融合音频和视觉模态来提升在遮挡、低光照等挑战性条件下的异常识别性能，并引入了VAAR数据集作为基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常识别方法主要依赖视觉数据，在遮挡、低光照和恶劣天气等条件下不可靠，且缺乏大规模同步音视频数据集阻碍了多模态异常识别的发展。

Method: AVAR-Net包含四个模块：音频特征提取器（Wav2Vec2）、视频特征提取器（MobileViT）、早期融合机制和多阶段时序卷积网络（MTCN），用于建模跨模态关系和长程时序依赖。

Result: 在VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率，在XD-Violence数据集上达到88.56%平均精度，比现有最优方法提升2.8%平均精度。

Conclusion: AVAR-Net展示了在多模态异常识别中的有效性、高效性和泛化能力，VAAR数据集为推进多模态异常识别研究提供了实用基准。

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

*Chun Wai Chin,Haniza Yazid,Hoi Leong Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇系统综述分析了医学图像增强领域的关键挑战、最新进展和评估指标，发现低对比度和噪声是最常见问题，MRI和多模态成像研究最多，而组织病理学等专业模态研究不足。在39项研究中，29项使用传统数学方法，9项关注深度学习，1项采用混合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像质量对诊断至关重要，但常受噪声、伪影和低对比度等问题影响，限制了诊断潜力。需要强大的预处理、去噪算法和先进的增强方法来提升图像质量和可解释性。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法进行系统文献综述，分析了39项同行评审研究，涵盖不同成像模态和增强方法。

Result: 识别出低对比度和噪声是最频繁的问题；MRI和多模态成像研究最多；传统数学方法占主导地位(29/39)；图像质量评估中非参考指标更常用(65个IQA指标中主要为非参考型)。

Conclusion: 综述揭示了当前医学图像增强的局限性、研究空白和未来发展方向，建议加强深度学习应用，探索更多专业成像模态，并改进评估指标体系。

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

*Akib Mohammed Khan,Bartosz Krawczyk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文系统研究了基于DINOv2的少样本异常检测器的对抗攻击脆弱性和不确定性校准问题，提出了攻击方法和不确定性估计基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索基础模型在少样本异常检测中的两个未研究问题：对抗扰动的敏感性和异常分数的校准不确定性。

Method: 基于AnomalyDINO，在冻结的DINOv2特征上附加轻量级线性头来生成对抗扰动，并使用Platt缩放进行后处理不确定性校准。

Result: 发现微小扰动可翻转特征空间中的最近邻关系导致误分类，原始异常分数校准性差，校准后验显著提高了对抗样本的预测熵。

Conclusion: DINOv2异常检测器存在具体漏洞，对抗鲁棒性和不确定性量化是构建可信异常检测系统的必要能力。

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

*Sanchar Palit,Subhasis Chaudhuri,Biplab Banerjee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文精确的图像超分辨率框架，通过局部-全局上下文感知注意力机制和分布-感知对齐条件机制，在保持局部和全局像素关系的同时增强感知保真度，生成高质量图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于预训练文本到图像模型（如Stable Diffusion）的超分辨率方法在处理多样化和高度退化图像时存在噪声放大或错误内容生成的问题，需要改进以保持结构一致性。

Method: 使用局部-全局上下文感知注意力机制保持像素关系，结合分布-感知对齐条件机制在像素空间增强感知保真度，从局部细节到全局结构逐步保留和细化结构信息。

Result: 在多个超分辨率基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法能生成结构一致、无伪影的高质量图像，实现高保真度和感知准确的图像重建。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能有效解决现有方法的局限性，在处理退化图像时保持结构一致性，生成高质量的超分辨率结果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

TL;DR: EditCast3D提出了一种利用视频生成基础模型进行3D编辑的新方法，通过从单帧编辑传播到整个数据集，结合视图选择策略实现高效且一致的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型在图像编辑方面取得显著进展，但扩展到3D编辑仍面临挑战，主要由于计算需求大、闭源API限制和成本问题，使得将这些模型集成到现有迭代编辑策略中不切实际。

Method: 采用视频生成基础模型从单个第一帧传播编辑到整个数据集，引入视图选择策略识别一致且适合重建的视图，采用前馈重建无需昂贵细化。

Result: 在常用3D编辑数据集上评估，与最先进的3D编辑基线相比，展示了优越的编辑质量和高效性。

Conclusion: EditCast3D为将基础模型集成到3D编辑流程中提供了一个可扩展且通用的范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

TL;DR: OmniGaze是一个半监督3D视线估计框架，利用大规模无标签数据解决领域偏差问题，通过伪标签策略和奖励模型选择高质量数据，在多个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D视线估计方法在不同数据域间泛化能力差，主要由于标注数据稀缺和标注数据多样性不足。

Method: 构建多样化的无标签面部图像集，采用伪标签策略，设计奖励模型评估伪标签可靠性，结合视觉嵌入和语义线索计算置信度分数，选择高质量伪标签进行损失计算。

Result: 在五个数据集上的域内和跨域设置中都达到了最先进性能，在四个未见数据集上展现出强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: OmniGaze不仅能提升3D视线估计性能，还能作为可扩展的数据引擎，具有强大的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

TL;DR: CanvasMAR通过引入画布机制解决视频掩码自回归模型的慢启动问题和误差累积问题，实现了更快速、更连贯的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频掩码自回归模型的两个主要限制：采样早期缺乏结构化全局先验导致的慢启动问题，以及在空间和时间维度上自回归过程中的误差累积问题。

Method: 提出画布机制（模糊的下一帧全局预测）作为掩码生成的起点；引入组合式无分类器引导联合扩大空间（画布）和时间条件；采用基于噪声的画布增强来提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在BAIR和Kinetics-600基准测试中，CanvasMAR以更少的自回归步骤生成高质量视频，在Kinetics-600数据集上表现优异，可与基于扩散的方法相媲美。

Conclusion: CanvasMAR通过画布机制有效解决了视频掩码自回归模型的关键问题，实现了更高效、更高质量的视频生成。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

Motivation: 开放域视觉实体识别面临固定标签集限制、训练时未见实体、长尾分布等挑战，需要解决有限监督、视觉歧义和语义消歧问题。

Method: 使用知识引导的对比学习框架，将视觉和文本输入抽象到概念层面，利用实体描述、类型层次和关系上下文，在Wikidata结构化知识基础上构建共享语义空间。

Conclusion: 结合视觉、文本和结构化知识能显著提升开放域视觉实体识别性能，特别是在罕见和未见实体上表现优异。

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

Motivation: 传统多视图导向方法生成多视图图像再进行3D重建，存在速度慢的问题。3D导向方法直接生成3D表示但视觉质量较差。FlashWorld旨在结合两种范式的优势。

Method: 采用双模式预训练和跨模式后训练：1) 基于视频扩散模型先验预训练双模式多视图扩散模型；2) 通过跨模式蒸馏将3D导向模式分布匹配到高质量多视图导向模式；3) 利用大量单视图图像和文本提示增强泛化能力。

Conclusion: FlashWorld通过创新的双模式训练框架，成功解决了3D场景生成中速度与质量的权衡问题，为快速高质量的3D内容创作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中生成健康反事实图像具有重要应用价值，如异常检测和为健康扫描设计的分析工具应用。现有方法难以平衡异常去除与个体特征保留的问题。

Method: 使用去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs），不仅以健康图像为初始条件，还以合成的病理图像为最终条件，将病理图像作为结构信息先验来指导生成过程。

Result: 实验结果显示，DDBM在分割和异常检测任务上优于先前提出的扩散模型和全监督方法。

Conclusion: DDBM方法能够有效生成与患者解剖结构紧密匹配的健康反事实图像，同时选择性去除病理区域，在医学影像分析中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS)方法，通过强化跨模态注意力到安全关键图像区域，在查询级别进行准确风险评估，并基于风险自适应引导激活生成安全且有用的响应，避免迭代输出调整的开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI模型面临的关键挑战是确保对良性查询提供有用响应，同时拒绝恶意查询。模型通常对嵌入有害意图的多模态查询脆弱。现有安全对齐方法要么需要昂贵的训练数据收集和训练成本，要么在推理时对齐会因误分类良性查询导致过度拒绝，且因迭代输出调整而降低推理速度。

Method: 提出风险自适应激活引导(RAS)方法：1) 重新表述查询以强化对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，实现查询级别的准确风险评估；2) 使用评估的风险自适应引导激活，生成安全且有用的响应，无需迭代输出调整的开销。

Result: 在多模态安全和效用基准测试上的广泛实验表明，RAS显著降低了攻击成功率，保持了通用任务性能，并相比先前的推理时防御方法提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: RAS方法通过查询级别的风险评估和自适应激活引导，有效解决了多模态安全对齐问题，在保持模型效用的同时提高了安全性和推理效率。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,

*Minjung Shin,Hyunin Cho,Sooyeon Go,Jin-Hwa Kim,Youngjung Uh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MVCustom框架，解决多视角生成与个性化定制的统一问题，通过特征场表示和深度感知特征渲染实现几何一致性和视角控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多视角生成模型缺乏个性化定制能力，而定制化模型又缺少明确的视角控制，难以统一这两个关键要素。

Method: 使用特征场表示学习主体身份和几何信息，结合文本到视频扩散骨干网络，通过深度感知特征渲染和一致性感知潜在补全确保几何一致性和视角对齐。

Result: MVCustom是唯一能同时实现忠实多视角生成和个性化定制的框架，在实验中表现出色。

Conclusion: MVCustom成功解决了多视角定制化任务，为可控生成模型提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

*Fabio Musio,Norman Juchler,Kaiyuan Yang,Suprosanna Shit,Chinmay Prabhakar,Bjoern Menze,Sven Hirsch*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种基于U-Net骨架化和A*图连接的基线算法，用于从脑部血管图像中提取Willis环的中心线和形态特征，在测试集上表现出高精度和强鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Willis环是脑部重要的动脉网络，与脑血管疾病密切相关。虽然体素级分割是自动化评估的第一步，但完整的定量分析需要中心线表示。然而，传统骨架化技术难以处理Willis环的复杂几何结构，且公开的中心线数据集稀缺。

Method: 使用细化骨架化算法从TopCoW数据集（包含200名卒中患者的MRA和CTA图像）中提取和整理中心线图和形态特征。开发了结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接的基线算法，用于中心线和特征提取。

Result: 基线算法在测试集上始终以高精度重建图拓扑结构（F1 = 1），参考图和预测图之间的平均欧几里得节点距离小于一个体素。段半径、长度和分叉比等特征表现出强鲁棒性，中位相对误差低于5%，皮尔逊相关系数高于0.95。

Conclusion: 研究证明了基于学习的骨架化结合图连接在解剖学上合理的中心线提取中的实用性，强调了超越简单体素测量、评估解剖精度和特征鲁棒性的重要性。数据集和基线算法已发布以支持进一步的方法开发和临床研究。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

TL;DR: LiFMCR是一个用于多微透镜阵列光场相机配准的新数据集，提供两个高分辨率Raytrix R32光场相机的同步图像序列和Vicon运动捕捉系统记录的高精度6自由度位姿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光场数据集局限于单相机设置且缺乏外部真实值，无法支持多相机光场配准方法的严格评估。

Method: 提供了两种配准方法：基于RANSAC的交叉视图点云3D变换估计，以及从单光场图像估计外参6自由度位姿的光场PnP算法，两者都明确集成了光场相机模型。

Result: 实验显示与真实值有很强的对齐性，支持可靠的多视角光场处理。

Conclusion: LiFMCR数据集及其配准方法为多相机光场配准提供了可靠的评估基准，实现了准确且可扩展的多相机配准。

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro
lens array (MLA)-based light field cameras. While existing light field datasets
are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种循环自监督扩散框架(CSS-Diff)，用于从真实低场MRI数据合成高质量的高场MRI图像，通过循环一致性约束确保解剖结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI虽然更便宜、更易获取且更安全，但存在分辨率低和信噪比差的问题。合成高场MRI可以减少对昂贵采集的依赖，但现有方法存在临床保真度差距，需要保持解剖保真度并增强细粒度结构细节。

Method: CSS-Diff框架包含两个新过程：切片间隙感知网络通过对比学习对齐切片间不一致性；局部结构校正网络通过掩码和扰动补丁的自重建来增强局部特征恢复。整个方法在生成过程中强制执行循环一致性约束。

Result: 在跨场合成任务中达到最先进性能：PSNR 31.80±2.70 dB，SSIM 0.943±0.102，LPIPS 0.0864±0.0689。相比原始低场MRI，左脑白质误差从12.1%降至2.1%，皮层误差从4.2%降至3.7%。

Conclusion: CSS-Diff能够合成在数量上可靠且在解剖结构上一致的图像，有效解决了低场到高场MRI合成的临床保真度问题。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LogViG模型，通过LSGC图构建方法解决传统ViG中长距离连接问题，结合多尺度高分辨率架构，在图像分类和语义分割任务上超越现有ViG、CNN和ViT模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViG的图构建方法如KNN在大图像上计算昂贵，而SVGA等方法存在固定步长导致过度压缩和长距离连接缺失的问题，限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出对数可扩展图构建(LSGC)方法限制长距离连接数量，构建LogViG混合CNN-GNN模型，引入高分辨率分支实现多尺度特征融合。

Result: Ti-LogViG在ImageNet-1K上达到79.9%平均top-1准确率，比Vision GNN提升1.7%，参数减少24.3%，GMACs减少35.3%。

Conclusion: 通过LSGC方法在ViG中利用长距离连接可以超越当前最先进的ViG模型性能。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么只能生成高质量的单字但忽略页面级美学（如连笔和间距），要么尝试页面合成但牺牲书法正确性。

Method: 采用非对称加噪和栅格化框图提供空间先验，在合成、标注和未标注数据的混合数据集上训练，联合优化识别和生成任务。

Result: 模型在生成质量上达到最先进水平，具有优越的连笔连续性和布局保真度，同时识别能力更强，并能扩展到甲骨文和埃及象形文字等其他古文字。

Conclusion: 联合训练识别和生成任务能促进概念级抽象，在有限数据情况下提升两个任务的性能，为书法计算复制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发轻量级但功能全面的多模态模型，提供智能的多轮音视频交互体验，特别是在长期记忆能力方面超越现有开源模型。

Method: 采用多阶段训练策略：先进行多模态预训练，然后进行语音对话和音视频交互的后训练；精心构建多轮训练数据集以增强复杂交互处理能力。

Result: InteractiveOmni在图像、音频、视频理解和语音生成任务中达到同类模型的最先进水平；4B版本在通用基准测试中与Qwen2.5-Omni-7B相当，仅用50%模型大小即可保留8B版本97%的性能。

Conclusion: InteractiveOmni为下一代智能交互系统提供了一个可访问的开源基础，在轻量级多模态模型中表现卓越，特别擅长多轮音视频交互和长期记忆。

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

TL;DR: RECODE是一个基于代码反渲染的可验证视觉推理框架，通过将图像转换为可执行代码来解决多模态大语言模型在图表推理中的精确性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理结构化视觉内容（如图表、图表）时缺乏验证机制，像素级感知难以进行精确推理。

Method: 提出RECODE框架：首先生成多个候选程序来重现输入图像，然后通过批评器选择最忠实的重构，并迭代优化代码。

Result: 在CharXiv、ChartQA、Geometry3K等多个视觉推理基准测试中，RECODE显著优于不使用代码或仅将代码用于辅助绘图的方法。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知基于可执行代码为更准确和可验证的多模态推理提供了新路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

Conclusion: 该基准为推进统一多模态模型提供了可靠基础，揭示了理解和生成能力相互强化的时机和机制。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决故事续写中有效利用先前视觉上下文并确保与当前文本输入语义对齐的核心挑战，避免误导或不相关信息的影响。

Method: 使用CLIP模型检索语义最对齐的历史图像，当无足够相关图像时自适应限制先前视觉在扩散过程早期阶段的影响，并通过LLM重新标注数据集提升数据质量。

Result: 定量结果和人工评估显示，AVC在连贯性、语义一致性和视觉保真度方面优于强基线，特别是在先前视觉与当前输入冲突的挑战性场景中。

Conclusion: AVC框架通过自适应视觉调节机制，在扩散模型中实现了更有效的故事续写，能够智能利用视觉上下文同时避免不相关信息干扰。

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

TL;DR: NoisePrints是一个轻量级水印方案，利用扩散过程初始化随机种子作为作者证明，无需修改生成过程或访问模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在视觉内容生成中的广泛应用，证明作者身份和保护版权变得至关重要。现有方法需要模型权重且计算量大，不实用且不可扩展。

Method: 利用初始噪声与生成内容的强相关性，通过哈希函数集成到噪声采样过程中，确保无法从内容恢复有效种子或生成替代种子。

Result: 在多个先进扩散模型上验证有效，支持图像和视频，仅需种子和输出即可高效验证，无需模型权重。

Conclusion: NoisePrints提供了一种实用、可扩展的版权保护方案，结合加密零知识证明进一步增强安全性。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了生成式通用验证器，用于多模态推理中的视觉结果验证和优化，通过构建ViVerBench基准、训练OmniVerifier-7B验证器以及提出OmniVerifier-TTS测试时扩展方法，显著提升了多模态模型的可靠性和生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在视觉结果验证方面存在显著不足，与人类水平的可靠视觉验证能力存在较大差距，需要开发能够进行反思和优化的通用验证机制。

Method: 1) 构建ViVerBench综合基准评估视觉结果；2) 设计自动化流水线构建大规模视觉验证数据，训练OmniVerifier-7B通用验证器；3) 提出OmniVerifier-TTS序列测试时扩展范式，通过迭代优化提升生成能力。

Result: OmniVerifier-7B在ViVerBench上提升8.3分，OmniVerifier-TTS在T2I-ReasonBench和GenEval++上分别提升3.7分和4.3分，优于现有的并行测试时扩展方法。

Conclusion: 生成式通用验证器为多模态推理提供了可靠的视觉验证能力，推动了更可信和可控的下一代推理系统的发展。

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

*Yiming Chen,Zekun Qi,Wenyao Zhang,Xin Jin,Li Zhang,Peidong Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了GS-Reasoner模型，通过双路径池化机制构建统一的3D表示，首次实现无需外部模块的自回归3D视觉定位，并显著提升空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D LLMs缺乏统一的3D表示来同时捕捉语义和几何信息，导致定位性能差或过度依赖外部模块，阻碍了定位与空间推理的无缝集成。

Method: 提出双路径池化机制，将几何特征与语义和位置线索紧密对齐，构建基于图像块的统一3D表示；引入GCoT数据集，包含3D边界框标注和集成定位的推理路径。

Result: GS-Reasoner在3D视觉定位上取得显著成果，性能与最先进模型相当，同时显著提升了空间推理能力，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner建立了统一且自包含的3D空间推理框架，证明了3D视觉定位是空间推理的基石，通过紧密集成定位与推理实现了突破性进展。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Trajectory Field表示方法，将视频表示为像素的连续3D轨迹场，并开发Trace Anything神经网络一次性预测整个轨迹场，在轨迹估计和点跟踪任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有效的时空表示对于视频动态建模至关重要。像素作为视频的基本单元，在时间上形成连续的3D轨迹，是动态的原始元素。

Method: 提出轨迹场表示法，为每个像素分配连续3D轨迹函数。开发Trace Anything神经网络，通过单次前向传播预测整个轨迹场，使用B样条参数化轨迹。

Result: 在新轨迹场估计基准上达到最先进性能，在点跟踪基准上表现竞争力；效率显著提升；展现出目标条件操作、运动预测和时空融合等涌现能力。

Conclusion: 轨迹场表示和Trace Anything模型为视频动态建模提供了有效解决方案，在性能和效率方面均表现出色，并具有多种应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

TL;DR: VisCoP通过向视觉编码器添加可学习的视觉探针，实现大视觉语言模型的高效领域自适应，在跨视角、跨模态和跨任务设置中均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大视觉语言模型在遇到与预训练数据分布差异较大的新领域时性能急剧下降，现有领域自适应方法要么特征学习有限，要么会导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出Vision Contextualized Probing (VisCoP)，在视觉编码器中添加少量可学习的视觉探针，实现对特定领域的高效适应，同时最小化对预训练参数的修改。

Result: 在跨视角、跨模态和跨任务三个挑战性领域自适应设置中，VisCoP均优于现有适应策略，在目标领域获得优越性能并有效保留源领域知识。

Conclusion: VisCoP提供了一种高效的大视觉语言模型领域自适应方法，通过视觉探针机制实现了特定领域适应与通用能力保留的良好平衡。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhysMaster通过物理表征学习和强化学习优化，提升视频生成模型的物理合理性，使其能够从静态图像预测符合物理规律的动态视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然能生成视觉逼真的视频，但往往违反物理定律，限制了其作为'世界模型'的能力。需要增强模型的物理意识来生成更符合物理规律的视频。

Method: 基于图像到视频任务，设计PhysEncoder从输入图像中提取物理信息作为额外条件；应用强化学习与人类反馈，通过直接偏好优化(DPO)端到端优化物理表征。

Result: PhysMaster在简单代理任务上证明了其提升物理意识的能力，并能够泛化到广泛的物理场景。

Conclusion: PhysMaster通过强化学习范式中的表征学习，为物理感知视频生成提供了通用且可插拔的解决方案，具有更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

*Imran Khan*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RID框架，一种零样本元提示技术，通过结构化认知模式帮助LLM处理规则与意图冲突，显著提升人类对齐度至95%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在作为智能体推理引擎时存在规则僵化问题，过度遵循显式规则导致与人类常识和意图不一致的决策，现有SFT方法计算成本高且不易获取。

Method: RID框架通过元提示技术为LLM提供结构化认知模式，包括任务解构、规则分类、冲突结果权衡和最终决策论证，无需额外训练。

Result: 在20个需要细微判断的场景基准测试中，RID框架达到95%人类对齐分数，显著优于基线(80%)和思维链(75%)，并能产生更高质量的意图驱动推理。

Conclusion: RID框架为引导LLM从字面指令遵循转向目标导向推理提供了实用、易获取且有效的方法，为构建更可靠实用的AI智能体铺平道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as the reasoning
engines for agentic AI systems, yet they exhibit a critical flaw: a rigid
adherence to explicit rules that leads to decisions misaligned with human
common sense and intent. This "rule-rigidity" is a significant barrier to
building trustworthy autonomous agents. While prior work has shown that
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with human explanations can mitigate this issue,
SFT is computationally expensive and inaccessible to many practitioners. To
address this gap, we introduce the Rule-Intent Distinction (RID) Framework, a
novel, low-compute meta-prompting technique designed to elicit human-aligned
exception handling in LLMs in a zero-shot manner. The RID framework provides
the model with a structured cognitive schema for deconstructing tasks,
classifying rules, weighing conflicting outcomes, and justifying its final
decision. We evaluated the RID framework against baseline and Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting on a custom benchmark of 20 scenarios requiring nuanced
judgment across diverse domains. Our human-verified results demonstrate that
the RID framework significantly improves performance, achieving a 95% Human
Alignment Score (HAS), compared to 80% for the baseline and 75% for CoT.
Furthermore, it consistently produces higher-quality, intent-driven reasoning.
This work presents a practical, accessible, and effective method for steering
LLMs from literal instruction-following to liberal, goal-oriented reasoning,
paving the way for more reliable and pragmatic AI agents.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DeepPlanner是一个端到端的强化学习框架，通过基于熵的优势函数和样本级优势加权，有效提升深度研究代理的规划能力，在多个基准测试中取得最优结果且训练成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在规划阶段存在优化不足的问题，规划令牌的熵明显高于其他动作令牌，表明存在未优化的不确定决策点。

Method: 提出DeepPlanner框架，通过基于熵的令牌级优势函数为高熵令牌分配更大更新，并为规划密集型轨迹选择性加权样本级优势。

Result: 在七个深度研究基准测试中，DeepPlanner提高了规划质量，以显著更低的训练预算实现了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: DeepPlanner通过系统优化规划阶段，有效解决了现有方法中规划令牌熵高的问题，提升了深度研究代理的规划能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) augmented with multi-step reasoning and action
generation abilities have shown promise in leveraging external tools to tackle
complex tasks that require long-horizon planning. However, existing approaches
either rely on implicit planning in the reasoning stage or introduce explicit
planners without systematically addressing how to optimize the planning stage.
As evidence, we observe that under vanilla reinforcement learning (RL),
planning tokens exhibit significantly higher entropy than other action tokens,
revealing uncertain decision points that remain under-optimized. To address
this, we propose DeepPlanner, an end-to-end RL framework that effectively
enhances the planning capabilities of deep research agents. Our approach shapes
token-level advantage with an entropy-based term to allocate larger updates to
high entropy tokens, and selectively upweights sample-level advantages for
planning-intensive rollouts. Extensive experiments across seven deep research
benchmarks demonstrate that DeepPlanner improves planning quality and achieves
state-of-the-art results under a substantially lower training budget.

Motivation: 现有方法在个性化学习体验方面缺乏目标对齐的规划机制，而大型语言模型在个性化学习方面具有潜力但需要更好的规划机制。

Method: 设计结构化学习者状态模型和自动奖励函数，将抽象目标转化为可计算信号，结合监督微调和组相对策略优化训练策略，并在真实学习平台中部署。

Abstract: Personalized Learning Path Planning (PLPP) aims to design adaptive learning

potential in personalizing learning experiences, existing approaches often lack

for PLPP that integrates a reinforcement-based training paradigm and an
LLM-driven educational architecture. We design a structured learner state model
and an automated reward function that transforms abstract objectives into
computable signals. We train the policy combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), and deploy it within a
real-world learning platform. Extensive experiments validate Pxplore's
effectiveness in producing coherent, personalized, and goal-driven learning
paths. We release our code and dataset to facilitate future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理无法在测试时实时学习复杂技能，限制了实际应用价值。需要系统性地衡量和推动这一挑战的进展。

Method: EvoTest进化测试时学习框架，包含角色代理和进化代理，通过分析游戏记录来改进提示、更新记忆、调整超参数和学习工具使用例程。

Result: EvoTest在J-TTL基准上持续提升性能，优于反思、记忆和在线微调等方法，是唯一能赢得两个游戏的方法。

Conclusion: EvoTest框架有效解决了AI代理在测试时学习复杂技能的挑战，为实际应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of current AI agents is their inability to learn
complex skills on the fly at test time, often behaving like "clever but
clueless interns" in novel environments. This severely limits their practical
utility. To systematically measure and drive progress on this challenge, we
first introduce the Jericho Test-Time Learning (J-TTL) benchmark. J-TTL is a
new evaluation setup where an agent must play the same game for several
consecutive episodes, attempting to improve its performance from one episode to
the next. On J-TTL, we find that existing adaptation methods like reflection,
memory, or reinforcement learning struggle. To address the challenges posed by
our benchmark, we present EvoTest, an evolutionary test-time learning framework
that improves an agent without any fine-tuning or gradients-by evolving the
entire agentic system after every episode. EvoTest has two roles: the Actor
Agent, which plays the game, and the Evolver Agent, which analyzes the episode
transcript to propose a revised configuration for the next run. This
configuration rewrites the prompt, updates memory by logging effective
state-action choices, tunes hyperparameters, and learns the tool-use routines.
On our J-TTL benchmark, EvoTest consistently increases performance,
outperforming not only reflection and memory-only baselines but also more
complex online fine-tuning methods. Notably, our method is the only one capable
of winning two games (Detective and Library), while all baselines fail to win
any.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型如何理解因果关系，以及它们能否发现连接原因和结果的中间因果步骤，这对于理解LLMs的机制性因果推理能力至关重要。

Method: 在诊断性评估框架中，让9个LLMs为给定的因果对生成所有可能的中间因果步骤，这些因果对来自气候变化辩论的论证研究资源。

Result: LLMs在生成的因果步骤数量和粒度上存在差异，虽然它们对中间因果连接具有自我一致性和自信，但主要依赖关联模式匹配而非真正的因果推理。人类评估确认了生成因果链的逻辑连贯性和完整性。

Conclusion: 本研究为推进论证环境中隐式机制性因果推理的未来工作奠定了坚实基础，包括基线因果链发现方法、诊断评估见解和带有因果链的基准数据集。

Abstract: How does a cause lead to an effect, and which intermediate causal steps
explain their connection? This work scrutinizes the mechanistic causal
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to answer these
questions through the task of implicit causal chain discovery. In a diagnostic
evaluation framework, we instruct nine LLMs to generate all possible
intermediate causal steps linking given cause-effect pairs in causal chain
structures. These pairs are drawn from recent resources in argumentation
studies featuring polarized discussion on climate change. Our analysis reveals
that LLMs vary in the number and granularity of causal steps they produce.
Although they are generally self-consistent and confident about the
intermediate causal connections in the generated chains, their judgments are
mainly driven by associative pattern matching rather than genuine causal
reasoning. Nonetheless, human evaluations confirmed the logical coherence and
integrity of the generated chains. Our baseline causal chain discovery
approach, insights from our diagnostic evaluation, and benchmark dataset with
causal chains lay a solid foundation for advancing future work in implicit,
mechanistic causal reasoning in argumentation settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在IMO 2025等数学竞赛中，LLM需要生成每个步骤都正确且有充分支持的证明，因此需要强大的步骤级验证器来捕捉错误。

Method: 创建Hard2Verify基准，包含500多小时人工标注，评估29个生成式评论器和过程奖励模型在步骤级验证任务上的表现。

Result: 除少数优秀模型外，开源验证器在步骤级验证任务上普遍落后于闭源模型，研究者分析了性能差的原因、计算规模影响等问题。

Conclusion: 步骤级验证是LLM推理系统的关键组件，Hard2Verify基准为评估和改进验证器提供了重要工具，揭示了当前验证技术的局限性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based reasoning systems have recently achieved
gold medal-level performance in the IMO 2025 competition, writing mathematical
proofs where, to receive full credit, each step must be not only correct but
also sufficiently supported. To train LLM-based reasoners in such challenging,
open-ended settings, strong verifiers capable of catching step-level mistakes
are necessary prerequisites. We introduce Hard2Verify, a human-annotated,
step-level verification benchmark produced with over 500 hours of human labor.
Hard2Verify is designed to rigorously assess step-level verifiers at the
frontier: Verifiers must provide step-level annotations or identify the first
error in responses generated by frontier LLMs for very recent, challenging, and
open-ended math questions. We evaluate 29 generative critics and process reward
models, demonstrating that, beyond a few standouts, open-source verifiers lag
closed source models. We subsequently analyze what drives poor performance in
step-level verification, the impacts of scaling verifier compute, as well as
fundamental questions such as self-verification and verification-generation
dynamics.

TL;DR: Dedelayed是一种延迟校正方法，通过结合轻量级本地模型和远程重型模型的特征，解决远程推理中的延迟问题，实现实时低延迟输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程推理虽然能让轻量设备利用强大云端模型，但网络延迟会导致预测结果过时，无法满足实时任务需求。

Method: 使用轻量级本地模型处理当前帧，并融合远程重型模型从过去帧计算的特征，以校正任意远程推理延迟。

Result: 在BDD100K驾驶数据集上，Dedelayed在所有超过33ms的实际网络延迟下，都优于纯本地或纯远程基线。在100ms往返延迟下，比纯本地推理提高6.4 mIoU，比远程推理提高9.8 mIoU。

Conclusion: 该方法在更长延迟和更高运动场景下优势更明显，为需要与当前世界状态保持同步的实时任务提供了明显优势。

Abstract: Remote inference allows lightweight devices to leverage powerful cloud
models. However, communication network latency makes predictions stale and
unsuitable for real-time tasks. To address this, we introduce Dedelayed, a
delay-corrective method that mitigates arbitrary remote inference delays,
allowing the local device to produce low-latency outputs in real time. Our
method employs a lightweight local model that processes the current frame and
fuses in features that a heavyweight remote model computes from past frames. On
video from the BDD100K driving dataset, Dedelayed improves semantic
segmentation accuracy over the stronger of the local-only and remote-only
baselines across all realistic communication network delays beyond 33 ms.
Without incurring additional delay, it improves accuracy by 6.4 mIoU compared
to fully local inference and 9.8 mIoU compared to remote inference, for a
round-trip delay of 100 ms. The advantage grows under longer delays and
higher-motion scenes, as delay-mitigated split inference sustains accuracy more
effectively, providing clear advantages for real-time tasks that must remain
aligned with the current world state.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了ExtremBench基准数据集，用于评估LLMs在数学极值问题求解方面的推理能力，发现现有数学基准不能全面评估数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对LLMs推理能力的来源和机制理解不足，特别是优化推理（在约束条件下寻找极值）这种基础抽象能力，在规划、控制、资源分配等关键应用中很重要。

Method: 构建ExtremBench基准数据集，包含93个标准化极值问题，来自中国数学奥林匹克不等式练习；对Qwen3、GPT-OSS、DeepSeek等开源模型进行广泛评估。

Result: LLMs的极值求解推理能力与当前数学基准（如AIME25和MATH-500）表现不一致，有些模型在一般数学推理上强但在极值求解上弱，反之亦然。

Conclusion: 现有基准评估实践存在关键差距，不能全面捕捉数学推理能力的完整谱系。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

### [185] [On the Reasoning Abilities of Masked Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13117)
*Anej Svete,Ashish Sabharwal*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了掩码扩散模型（MDMs）在有限精度对数宽度设置下与多项式填充循环变换器（PLTs）等价，能够解决所有思维链增强变换器（CoT transformers）能解决的问题，且在某些问题（如正则语言）上比CoT变换器更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索掩码扩散模型的计算能力和并行性限制，将其与现有的推理框架（思维链和填充循环变换器）联系起来，以理解其理论能力和效率。

Method: 通过理论分析，在有限精度对数宽度设置下，将MDMs与链式思维（CoT）和填充循环变换器（PLTs）进行等价性证明和效率比较。

Result: 证明了MDMs与多项式填充PLTs等价，能够解决所有CoT增强变换器能解决的问题，并在某些问题类别上展现出比CoT变换器更高的效率。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散模型不仅具有与现有推理框架相当的理论能力，而且其并行生成特性使其在某些推理任务中比序列生成的CoT方法更高效。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to
traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them
efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to
their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what
types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do
this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of
thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision
log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact,
equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that
CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems
(including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than
CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster
reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据无关且计算高效的LoRA选择和合并策略，用于在存储受限的移动设备上在线持续合并新的LoRA适配器，同时保持先前任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在移动设备上部署LLM时，LoRA适配器通常以增量方式交付，但设备存储容量有限，需要一种在线持续合并新LoRA的方法，同时保持对先前任务的支持。

Method: 采用数据无关且计算高效的策略，在存储预算内选择和合并LoRA适配器，当新LoRA可用时进行在线持续合并。

Result: 在真实世界任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法在遵守设备存储预算和计算限制的同时，相比替代策略具有优越性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了移动设备上LoRA适配器的在线持续合并问题，在资源受限环境下实现了良好的性能保持。

Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight
resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile
devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple
LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered
incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem
types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online
continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while
preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we
propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and
merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store
only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world
tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative
strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of
on-device settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UrbanFusion是一个地理基础模型，通过随机多模态融合技术整合街景图像、遥感数据、地图和POI等多种地理空间数据，在41个任务的全球评估中表现出优越的泛化能力和预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要使用任务特定模型，而空间表示的基础模型通常只支持有限模态且缺乏多模态融合能力，需要开发能有效整合多种地理空间数据的统一框架。

Method: 采用模态特定编码器处理不同类型输入，通过基于Transformer的融合模块学习统一表示，支持在预训练和推理期间灵活使用可用模态子集。

Result: 在56个城市的41个任务评估中，UrbanFusion在位置编码方面优于先前基础模型，支持推理时的多模态输入，并能良好泛化到训练期间未见过的区域。

Conclusion: UrbanFusion通过随机多模态融合框架实现了对多种地理空间数据的有效整合，具有广泛的适用性和优越的泛化性能。

Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了FINDER框架，通过生成式检索器和上下文感知的程序思维提示来增强LLM在金融数值推理任务上的表现，在FinQA和ConvFinQA数据集上达到了新的SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM能力不断提升，但在数值推理特别是金融数值推理方面仍存在挑战，现有方法在FinQA和ConvFinQA数据集上表现不佳。

Method: 两步框架：1) 使用生成式检索器从非结构化数据中提取相关事实；2) 上下文感知的程序思维提示，动态选择上下文示例。

Result: 在FinQA和ConvFinQA数据集上分别实现了5.98%和4.05%的执行准确率提升，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: FINDER框架有效提升了LLM在金融数值推理任务上的性能，证明了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: Despite continuous advancements in the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs), numerical reasoning remains a challenging area. Techniques like
chain-of-thought prompting, tree-of-thought prompting, and program-of-thought
prompting guide LLMs through intermediate reasoning steps. Although in-context
learning with few-shot prompting has improved performance, LLMs still lag
behind state-of-the-art models on financial numerical reasoning datasets such
as FinQA and ConvFinQA. In this work, we introduce FINDER, a novel two-step
framework, to enhance LLMs' capabilities in financial numerical reasoning. The
first step utilizes a generative retriever to extract relevant facts from
unstructured data, including both text and tables. This is followed by
context-aware Program of Thought prompting with dynamic selection of in-context
examples. Our model FINDER achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on both
the FinQA and ConvFinQA datasets, surpassing previous benchmarks with execution
accuracy improvements of 5.98% and 4.05%, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过学生议论文自动评估批判性思维核心子技能的可行性，比较了三种大型语言模型和三种自动化评分方法，发现GPT-5在少量样本提示下表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 批判性思维是当今教育的关键能力，但学习分析领域在定义、测量和支持批判性思维方面研究不足，需要开发可扩展的评估方法。

Method: 基于已建立的技能进展制定编码标准，对学生议论文进行人工编码，然后评估三种自动化评分方法：零样本提示、少量样本提示和监督微调，使用三种大型语言模型（GPT-5、GPT-5-mini和ModernBERT）。

Result: GPT-5在少量样本提示下表现最强，在可分离、频繁出现的子技能类别上表现优异，但在需要检测细微区别或罕见类别的子技能上表现较差。专有模型提供更高的可靠性但成本更高，开源替代方案提供实用准确性但对少数类别敏感度较低。

Conclusion: 这是向在真实教育环境中可扩展评估高阶推理技能迈出的初步步骤，揭示了自动化批判性思维评估中的关键权衡。

Abstract: Critical thinking represents a fundamental competency in today's education
landscape. Developing critical thinking skills through timely assessment and
feedback is crucial; however, there has not been extensive work in the learning
analytics community on defining, measuring, and supporting critical thinking.
In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of measuring core "subskills"
that underlie critical thinking. We ground our work in an authentic task where
students operationalize critical thinking: student-written argumentative
essays. We developed a coding rubric based on an established skills progression
and completed human coding for a corpus of student essays. We then evaluated
three distinct approaches to automated scoring: zero-shot prompting, few-shot
prompting, and supervised fine-tuning, implemented across three large language
models (GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and ModernBERT). GPT-5 with few-shot prompting
achieved the strongest results and demonstrated particular strength on
subskills with separable, frequent categories, while lower performance was
observed for subskills that required detection of subtle distinctions or rare
categories. Our results underscore critical trade-offs in automated critical
thinking assessment: proprietary models offer superior reliability at higher
cost, while open-source alternatives provide practical accuracy with reduced
sensitivity to minority categories. Our work represents an initial step toward
scalable assessment of higher-order reasoning skills across authentic
educational contexts.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究探讨使用大型语言模型（LLMs）模拟异质旅行者的集体偏好，以解决交通规划中政策与公众偏好不一致的问题。通过多智能体模拟和链式思维推理，LLM代理参与交通政策公投，结果显示LLMs能够近似合理的集体偏好，但也存在模型特定的行为偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通规划中，异质旅行者的集体偏好经常与模型驱动的决策工具产生的政策不一致，导致实施延迟或失败。研究旨在探索LLMs在解决这种对齐问题方面的潜力。

Method: 开发多智能体模拟框架，让LLMs作为代表不同社区居民的代理，参与交通政策公投。使用链式思维推理生成排序选择或批准式偏好，通过即时决选投票（IRV）聚合偏好来模拟民主共识。在芝加哥和休斯顿应用该框架，使用GPT-4o和Claude-3.5模型。

Result: LLM代理能够近似合理的集体偏好，并对当地环境做出响应，但也显示出模型特定的行为偏差，与基于优化的基准存在适度差异。

Conclusion: LLMs作为解决交通决策中对齐问题的工具，既展现了潜力也存在局限性，需要谨慎使用以克服模型特定的行为偏差。

Abstract: A key challenge in transportation planning is that the collective preferences
of heterogeneous travelers often diverge from the policies produced by
model-driven decision tools. This misalignment frequently results in
implementation delays or failures. Here, we investigate whether large language
models (LLMs), noted for their capabilities in reasoning and simulating human
decision-making, can help inform and address this alignment problem. We develop
a multi-agent simulation in which LLMs, acting as agents representing residents
from different communities in a city, participate in a referendum on a set of
transit policy proposals. Using chain-of-thought reasoning, LLM agents provide
ranked-choice or approval-based preferences, which are aggregated using
instant-runoff voting (IRV) to model democratic consensus. We implement this
simulation framework with both GPT-4o and Claude-3.5, and apply it for Chicago
and Houston. Our findings suggest that LLM agents are capable of approximating
plausible collective preferences and responding to local context, while also
displaying model-specific behavioral biases and modest divergences from
optimization-based benchmarks. These capabilities underscore both the promise
and limitations of LLMs as tools for solving the alignment problem in
transportation decision-making.

TL;DR: UNCAP是一种基于视觉语言模型的规划方法，通过轻量级自然语言消息实现CAV间通信，同时明确考虑感知不确定性，显著降低通信带宽并提高驾驶安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖高带宽原始传感器数据流传输，要么忽略共享数据中的感知和规划不确定性，导致系统既不可扩展也不安全。

Method: 采用两阶段通信协议：(1) 识别最相关的车辆子集进行信息交换；(2) 选定的CAV传输定量表达感知不确定性的消息，通过选择性融合最大化互信息的消息来整合最相关信号。

Result: 实验显示：通信带宽减少63%，驾驶安全评分提高31%，决策不确定性降低61%，近失事件中碰撞距离裕度增加四倍。

Conclusion: UNCAP通过不确定性引导的自然语言通信，实现了高效、可扩展且安全的协同自动驾驶规划。

Abstract: Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and
interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth
raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties
inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor
safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural
Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based
planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural
language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in
decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego
CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information
exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively
express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that
maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate
only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the
scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse
driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31%
increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and
a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

TL;DR: 对视觉-语言-动作模型进行系统性脆弱性分析，发现尽管在基准测试中表现优异，但这些模型在七个维度的扰动下表现出严重的脆弱性，性能从95%骤降至30%以下，且倾向于完全忽略语言指令。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型在机器人操作基准测试中报告了令人印象深刻的成功率，但这些结果可能掩盖了鲁棒性方面的根本弱点。需要进行系统性脆弱性分析来揭示模型在真实环境中的可靠性。

Method: 通过引入七个维度的受控扰动进行系统性脆弱性分析：物体布局、相机视角、机器人初始状态、语言指令、光照条件、背景纹理和传感器噪声。全面分析了多个最先进的模型。

Result: 模型表现出极端的脆弱性：在相机视角和机器人初始状态的扰动下，性能从95%降至30%以下；令人惊讶的是，模型对语言变化不敏感，倾向于完全忽略语言指令。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了高基准分数等同于真正能力的假设，强调需要建立能够评估在真实变化下可靠性的评估实践。

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on
robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental
weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by
introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout,
camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light
conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed
multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath
apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit
extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and
robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under
modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language
variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore
language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that
high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for
evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

Conclusion: 这项工作为实现机器人操作的可扩展和可泛化学习提供了有前景的路径，证明了通过简单玩具训练可以实现强大的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies often struggle to generalize to novel objects,
limiting their real-world utility. In contrast, cognitive science suggests that
children develop generalizable dexterous manipulation skills by mastering a
small set of simple toys and then applying that knowledge to more complex
items. Inspired by this, we study if similar generalization capabilities can
also be achieved by robots. Our results indicate robots can learn generalizable
grasping using randomly assembled objects that are composed from just four
shape primitives: spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. We show that training
on these "toys" enables robust generalization to real-world objects, yielding
strong zero-shot performance. Crucially, we find the key to this generalization
is an object-centric visual representation induced by our proposed detection
pooling mechanism. Evaluated in both simulation and on physical robots, our
model achieves a 67% real-world grasping success rate on the YCB dataset,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that rely on substantially more
in-domain data. We further study how zero-shot generalization performance
scales by varying the number and diversity of training toys and the
demonstrations per toy. We believe this work offers a promising path to
scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation. Demonstration

TL;DR: InternVLA-M1是一个统一的空间定位与机器人控制框架，通过空间引导的视觉-语言-动作训练，将空间定位作为指令与机器人动作之间的关键连接。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动指令跟随机器人向可扩展、通用智能方向发展，解决传统方法在空间推理和动作生成之间的脱节问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：第一阶段在230万空间推理数据上进行空间定位预训练，确定"在哪里行动"；第二阶段进行空间引导的动作后训练，通过即插即用的空间提示决定"如何行动"。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于无空间引导的变体：SimplerEnv Google Robot提升14.6%，WidowX提升17%，LIBERO Franka提升4.3%。在真实世界集群抓取任务中提升7.3%，通过合成协同训练在未见物体和新配置上提升20.6%。

Conclusion: 空间引导训练是构建可扩展和鲁棒通用机器人的统一原则，在长时程推理密集型场景中表现优于现有方法10%以上。

Abstract: We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and
robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable,
general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided
vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical
link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage
pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning
data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,
embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training
to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through
plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields
consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance
by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO
Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,
point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a
simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,
enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In
real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with
synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel
configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it
surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided
training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

Abstract: On large-scale e-commerce platforms with tens of millions of active monthly
users, recommending visually similar products is essential for enabling users
to efficiently discover items that align with their preferences. This study
presents the application of a vision-language model (VLM) -- which has
demonstrated strong performance in image recognition and image-text retrieval
tasks -- to product recommendations on Mercari, a major consumer-to-consumer
marketplace used by more than 20 million monthly users in Japan. Specifically,
we fine-tuned SigLIP, a VLM employing a sigmoid-based contrastive loss, using
one million product image-title pairs from Mercari collected over a three-month
period, and developed an image encoder for generating item embeddings used in
the recommendation system. Our evaluation comprised an offline analysis of
historical interaction logs and an online A/B test in a production environment.
In offline analysis, the model achieved a 9.1% improvement in nDCG@5 compared
with the baseline. In the online A/B test, the click-through rate improved by
50% whereas the conversion rate improved by 14% compared with the existing
model. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of VLM-based encoders for
e-commerce product recommendations and provide practical insights into the
development of visual similarity-based recommendation systems.

Motivation: 扩散模型在PET图像重建中表现出色，但面临领域偏移问题——在不同解剖结构、采集协议或病理情况下可能产生伪影，阻碍临床采用。

Method: 将可引导条件扩散与之前提出的似然调度扩散框架结合，在重建时使用低秩适应技术实时调整扩散模型先验以适应目标领域。

Result: 在2D脑部体模实验中，该方法能有效抑制领域偏移下的幻觉伪影，在定性和定量评估上都优于OSEM和基础扩散模型。

Conclusion: 可引导先验能够缓解基于扩散的PET重建中的领域偏移问题，为未来在真实数据上的评估提供了概念验证。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently enabled state-of-the-art reconstruction of
positron emission tomography (PET) images while requiring only image training
data. However, domain shift remains a key concern for clinical adoption: priors
trained on images from one anatomy, acquisition protocol or pathology may
produce artefacts on out-of-distribution data. We propose integrating steerable
conditional diffusion (SCD) with our previously-introduced likelihood-scheduled
diffusion (PET-LiSch) framework to improve the alignment of the diffusion
model's prior to the target subject. At reconstruction time, for each diffusion
step, we use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to align the diffusion model prior with
the target domain on the fly. Experiments on realistic synthetic 2D brain
phantoms demonstrate that our approach suppresses hallucinated artefacts under
domain shift, i.e. when our diffusion model is trained on perturbed images and
tested on normal anatomy, our approach suppresses the hallucinated structure,
outperforming both OSEM and diffusion model baselines qualitatively and
quantitatively. These results provide a proof-of-concept that steerable priors
can mitigate domain shift in diffusion-based PET reconstruction and motivate
future evaluation on real data.

map (tracer distribution) in the body. Generally, this is carried out based on
the estimated attenuation map obtained from computed tomography or magnetic
resonance imaging. However, except for errors in the attenuation correction
factors obtained, the additional scan not only brings in new radiation doses
and/or increases the scanning time but also leads to severe misalignment
induced by various motions during and between the two sequential scans. To
address these issues, based on maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a new
mathematical model for simultaneously reconstructing the activity and
attenuation sinogram from the time-of-flight (TOF)-PET emission data only.
Particularly, we make full use of the exclusively exponential form for the
attenuation correction factors, and consider the constraint of a total amount
of the activity in some mask region in the proposed model. Furthermore, we
prove its well-posedness, including the existence, uniqueness and stability of
the solution. We propose an alternating update algorithm to solve the model,
and also analyze its convergence. Finally, numerical experiments with various
TOF-PET emission data demonstrate that the proposed method is of numerical
convergence and robust to noise, and outperforms some state-of-the-art methods
in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and has the capability of autonomous
attenuation correction.

TL;DR: UniMoE-Audio是一个统一语音和音乐生成的模型，采用动态容量专家混合框架，通过三阶段训练策略解决数据不平衡问题，在语音和音乐生成基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在听觉领域面临挑战，语音和音乐生成通常独立发展，存在任务冲突和数据不平衡问题，阻碍了通用音频合成的发展。

Method: 提出UniMoE-Audio模型，采用动态容量MoE框架，包含Top-P路由策略和混合专家设计（路由专家、共享专家、空专家），并通过三阶段训练课程：独立专家训练、MoE整合预热、协同联合训练。

Result: 在主要语音和音乐生成基准测试中达到最先进性能，展现出优越的协同学习能力，缓解了朴素联合训练中的性能下降问题。

Conclusion: 专业化MoE架构和精心设计的训练策略在推进通用音频生成领域具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models indicate a clear trend towards
comprehensive content generation. However, the auditory domain remains a
significant challenge, with music and speech often developed in isolation,
hindering progress towards universal audio synthesis. This separation stems
from inherent task conflicts and severe data imbalances, which impede the
development of a truly unified audio generation model. To address this
challenge, we propose UniMoE-Audio, a unified speech and music generation model
within a novel Dynamic-Capacity Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework.
Architecturally, UniMoE-Audio introduces a Top-P routing strategy for dynamic
expert number allocation, and a hybrid expert design comprising routed experts
for domain-specific knowledge, shared experts for domain-agnostic features, and
null experts for adaptive computation skipping. To tackle data imbalance, we
introduce a three-stage training curriculum: 1) Independent Specialist Training
leverages original datasets to instill domain-specific knowledge into each
"proto-expert" without interference; 2) MoE Integration and Warmup incorporates
these specialists into the UniMoE-Audio architecture, warming up the gate
module and shared expert using a subset of balanced dataset; and 3) Synergistic
Joint Training trains the entire model end-to-end on the fully balanced
dataset, fostering enhanced cross-domain synergy. Extensive experiments show
that UniMoE-Audio not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on major
speech and music generation benchmarks, but also demonstrates superior
synergistic learning, mitigating the performance degradation typically seen in
naive joint training. Our findings highlight the substantial potential of
specialized MoE architecture and curated training strategies in advancing the
field of universal audio generation. Homepage:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 编写竞争性编程问题需要精确设置约束、输入分布和边界情况，针对特定算法并校准复杂度，这为测试大型语言模型的通用能力提供了理想场景。

Method: 使用多轮验证生成问题陈述和测试用例，通过随机种子问题创建新颖变体，并通过交叉验证生成解决方案与测试用例来过滤不良问题。

Result: 在保留问题上，AutoCode测试套件与官方评判的一致性达到99%，显著优于当前最先进方法HardTests的81%。系统成功生成了被顶级程序员评为竞赛质量的新颖问题。

Conclusion: AutoCode系统能够可靠地生成竞赛级编程问题，通过多轮验证和交叉验证确保高质量，证明了大型语言模型在复杂问题生成任务中的能力。

Abstract: Writing competitive programming problems is exacting. Authors must: set
constraints, input distributions, and edge cases that rule out shortcuts;
target specific algorithms (e.g., max-flow, dynamic programming, data
structures); and calibrate complexity beyond the reach of most competitors. We
argue that this makes for an ideal test of general large language model
capabilities and study whether they can do this reliably. We introduce
AutoCode, which uses multiple rounds of validation to yield competition-grade
problem statements and test cases. On held-out problems, AutoCode test suites
approach 99% consistency with official judgments, a significant improvement
over current state-of-the-art methods like HardTests, which achieve less than
81%. Furthermore, starting with a random seed problem, AutoCode can create
novel variants with reference and brute-force solutions. By cross-verifying
these generated solutions against test cases, we can further filter out
malformed problems. Our system ensures high correctness, as verified by human
experts. AutoCode successfully produces novel problems judged by
Grandmaster-level (top 0.3%) competitive programmers to be of contest quality.

TL;DR: 提出DualHyp框架，通过LLM融合ASR和VSR的N-best假设，结合RelPrompt机制动态调整模态权重，在语音识别中实现显著错误率降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统单流生成式错误校正方法在视听语音识别中效果有限的问题，充分利用多模态信息进行更有效的错误校正。

Method: DualHyp框架让LLM组合独立的ASR和VSR N-best假设，RelPrompt提供模态感知的时序可靠性指导，动态切换模态焦点。

Result: 在LRS2基准上，相比标准ASR基线获得高达57.7%的错误率增益，远超单流GER方法的10%增益。

Conclusion: DualHyp框架通过多模态融合和动态模态切换，显著提升了视听语音识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new paradigm for generative error correction (GER)
framework in audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) that reasons over
modality-specific evidences directly in the language space. Our framework,
DualHyp, empowers a large language model (LLM) to compose independent N-best
hypotheses from separate automatic speech recognition (ASR) and visual speech
recognition (VSR) models. To maximize the effectiveness of DualHyp, we further
introduce RelPrompt, a noise-aware guidance mechanism that provides
modality-grounded prompts to the LLM. RelPrompt offers the temporal reliability
of each modality stream, guiding the model to dynamically switch its focus
between ASR and VSR hypotheses for an accurate correction. Under various
corruption scenarios, our framework attains up to 57.7% error rate gain on the
LRS2 benchmark over standard ASR baseline, contrary to single-stream GER
approaches that achieve only 10% gain. To facilitate research within our
DualHyp framework, we release the code and the dataset comprising ASR and VSR
hypotheses at https://github.com/sungnyun/dualhyp.
