### [1] [Evaluating Reasoning LLMs for Suicide Screening with the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13480)
*Avinash Patil,Siru Tao,Amardeep Gedhu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）在自杀风险评估中的表现，发现Claude和GPT与人类标注结果接近，Mistral在顺序预测误差上表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台如Reddit的r/SuicideWatch为自杀意念表达提供了空间，而LLMs可能成为新的披露对象，因此需要评估其风险评估能力。

Method: 使用哥伦比亚自杀严重程度评定量表（C-SSRS）对六种模型（包括Claude、GPT、Mistral和LLaMA）进行零样本性能评估。

Result: Claude和GPT与人类标注结果接近，Mistral的顺序预测误差最低，多数模型对相邻严重级别存在误分类。

Conclusion: 研究强调了人类监督、透明度和谨慎部署的重要性，并提供了完整代码和补充材料。

Abstract: Suicide prevention remains a critical public health challenge. While online
platforms such as Reddit's r/SuicideWatch have historically provided spaces for
individuals to express suicidal thoughts and seek community support, the advent
of large language models (LLMs) introduces a new paradigm-where individuals may
begin disclosing ideation to AI systems instead of humans. This study evaluates
the capability of LLMs to perform automated suicide risk assessment using the
Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). We assess the zero-shot
performance of six models-including Claude, GPT, Mistral, and LLaMA-in
classifying posts across a 7-point severity scale (Levels 0-6). Results
indicate that Claude and GPT closely align with human annotations, while
Mistral achieves the lowest ordinal prediction error. Most models exhibit
ordinal sensitivity, with misclassifications typically occurring between
adjacent severity levels. We further analyze confusion patterns,
misclassification sources, and ethical considerations, underscoring the
importance of human oversight, transparency, and cautious deployment. Full code

### [2] [EmoMeta: A Multimodal Dataset for Fine-grained Emotion Classification in Chinese Metaphors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13483)
*Xingyuan Lu,Yuxi Liu,Dongyu Zhang,Zhiyao Wu,Jing Ren,Feng Xia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了中文多模态隐喻广告数据集EmoMeta，包含5000个文本-图像对，标注了隐喻、领域关系和细粒度情感分类，填补了多模态隐喻情感数据集的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态隐喻在情感表达中日益重要，但相关研究稀缺且集中于英语，缺乏跨语言情感差异的探索。

Method: 构建中文多模态隐喻广告数据集，标注隐喻、领域关系和10种细粒度情感（如喜悦、愤怒等）。

Result: 数据集包含5000个文本-图像对，公开可用，支持多模态隐喻情感分类研究。

Conclusion: EmoMeta填补了多模态隐喻情感数据集的空白，为跨语言情感研究提供了资源。

Abstract: Metaphors play a pivotal role in expressing emotions, making them crucial for
emotional intelligence. The advent of multimodal data and widespread
communication has led to a proliferation of multimodal metaphors, amplifying
the complexity of emotion classification compared to single-mode scenarios.
However, the scarcity of research on constructing multimodal metaphorical
fine-grained emotion datasets hampers progress in this domain. Moreover,
existing studies predominantly focus on English, overlooking potential
variations in emotional nuances across languages. To address these gaps, we
introduce a multimodal dataset in Chinese comprising 5,000 text-image pairs of
metaphorical advertisements. Each entry is meticulously annotated for metaphor
occurrence, domain relations and fine-grained emotion classification
encompassing joy, love, trust, fear, sadness, disgust, anger, surprise,
anticipation, and neutral. Our dataset is publicly accessible
(https://github.com/DUTIR-YSQ/EmoMeta), facilitating further advancements in
this burgeoning field.

### [3] [Detecting Prefix Bias in LLM-based Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13487)
*Ashwin Kumar,Yuzi He,Aram H. Markosyan,Bobbie Chern,Imanol Arrieta-Ibarra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）中存在的奖励模型偏见问题，特别是前缀偏见，并提出了一种数据增强策略来缓解这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有许多公开的偏好数据集用于语言模型的微调，但奖励模型中的偏见问题尚未得到充分研究，尤其是在种族和性别维度上的系统性偏见。

Method: 作者提出了检测和评估前缀偏见的新方法，并通过多种开源偏好数据集和奖励模型架构进行了全面评估。此外，还提出了一种数据增强策略来减少偏见。

Result: 研究发现，无论模型架构如何，奖励模型均容易受到前缀偏见的影响。数据增强策略在减少偏见方面表现出有效性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在设计公平可靠的奖励模型时，需要关注偏见问题，并提出了具体解决方案，为AI公平性研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning of language models using human
preference data. While numerous publicly available preference datasets provide
pairwise comparisons of responses, the potential for biases in the resulting
reward models remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce novel methods
to detect and evaluate prefix bias -- a systematic shift in model preferences
triggered by minor variations in query prefixes -- in LLM-based reward models
trained on such datasets. We leverage these metrics to reveal significant
biases in preference models across racial and gender dimensions. Our
comprehensive evaluation spans diverse open-source preference datasets and
reward model architectures, demonstrating susceptibility to this kind of bias
regardless of the underlying model architecture. Furthermore, we propose a data
augmentation strategy to mitigate these biases, showing its effectiveness in
reducing the impact of prefix bias. Our findings highlight the critical need
for bias-aware dataset design and evaluation in developing fair and reliable
reward models, contributing to the broader discourse on fairness in AI.

### [4] [Source framing triggers systematic evaluation bias in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13488)
*Federico Germani,Giovanni Spitale*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在文本评估中的一致性和偏见问题，发现模型间和模型内评估在盲测时高度一致，但在引入来源框架后，特别是对中国作者的文本，一致性显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在文本生成和评估中的广泛应用，研究其评估是否一致、无偏见且不受框架效应影响变得至关重要。

Method: 研究使用四种先进LLMs（OpenAI o3-mini、Deepseek Reasoner、xAI Grok 2和Mistral），评估了4,800条叙述性声明，并操纵声明来源（LLM或特定国籍的人类作者）。

Result: 盲测时LLMs评估高度一致，但来源框架引入后，特别是对中国作者的文本，一致性显著下降，Deepseek Reasoner受影响最大。

Conclusion: 框架效应对LLM文本评估有深远影响，可能损害信息系统的完整性、中立性和公平性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used not only to generate text
but also to evaluate it, raising urgent questions about whether their judgments
are consistent, unbiased, and robust to framing effects. In this study, we
systematically examine inter- and intra-model agreement across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (OpenAI o3-mini, Deepseek Reasoner, xAI Grok 2, and
Mistral) tasked with evaluating 4,800 narrative statements on 24 different
topics of social, political, and public health relevance, for a total of
192,000 assessments. We manipulate the disclosed source of each statement to
assess how attribution to either another LLM or a human author of specified
nationality affects evaluation outcomes. We find that, in the blind condition,
different LLMs display a remarkably high degree of inter- and intra-model
agreement across topics. However, this alignment breaks down when source
framing is introduced. Here we show that attributing statements to Chinese
individuals systematically lowers agreement scores across all models, and in
particular for Deepseek Reasoner. Our findings reveal that framing effects can
deeply affect text evaluation, with significant implications for the integrity,
neutrality, and fairness of LLM-mediated information systems.

### [5] [ProdRev: A DNN framework for empowering customers using generative pre-trained transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13491)
*Aakash Gupta,Nataraj Das*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于生成预训练Transformer的框架，用于更好地理解和总结电商评论，帮助用户快速做出决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疫情期间，消费者对电商的依赖增加，但海量评论可能导致决策困难。现有工具仅提供评分调整，无法解决信息过载问题。

Method: 使用生成预训练Transformer（GPT3的Curie引擎）进行微调，采用抽象摘要方法而非简单的提取式摘要，以更好地理解评论之间的关系。

Result: 模型能够生成评论的优缺点总结，帮助用户快速理解并做出决策。

Conclusion: 该框架通过引入“常识”和抽象摘要，有效解决了用户面对海量评论时的决策困难问题。

Abstract: Following the pandemic, customers, preference for using e-commerce has
accelerated. Since much information is available in multiple reviews (sometimes
running in thousands) for a single product, it can create decision paralysis
for the buyer. This scenario disempowers the consumer, who cannot be expected
to go over so many reviews since its time consuming and can confuse them.
Various commercial tools are available, that use a scoring mechanism to arrive
at an adjusted score. It can alert the user to potential review manipulations.
This paper proposes a framework that fine-tunes a generative pre-trained
transformer to understand these reviews better. Furthermore, using
"common-sense" to make better decisions. These models have more than 13 billion
parameters. To fine-tune the model for our requirement, we use the curie engine
from generative pre-trained transformer (GPT3). By using generative models, we
are introducing abstractive summarization. Instead of using a simple extractive
method of summarizing the reviews. This brings out the true relationship
between the reviews and not simply copy-paste. This introduces an element of
"common sense" for the user and helps them to quickly make the right decisions.
The user is provided the pros and cons of the processed reviews. Thus the
user/customer can take their own decisions.

### [6] [LLM4CD: Leveraging Large Language Models for Open-World Knowledge Augmented Cognitive Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13492)
*Weiming Zhang,Lingyue Fu,Qingyao Li,Kounianhua Du,Jianghao Lin,Jingwei Yu,Wei Xia,Weinan Zhang,Ruiming Tang,Yong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM4CD利用大语言模型的开放世界知识，通过语义表示增强认知诊断任务，解决传统ID方法的局限性，并在实验中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前认知诊断方法依赖ID关系，忽略语义信息，且难以处理新学生和练习的冷启动问题。

Method: 利用大语言模型构建语义表示，提出双层编码器框架（宏观认知文本编码器和微观知识状态编码器）。

Result: 在多数据集上优于传统方法，验证了语义信息的有效性。

Conclusion: LLM4CD通过引入开放世界知识，提升了认知诊断的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Cognitive diagnosis (CD) plays a crucial role in intelligent education,
evaluating students' comprehension of knowledge concepts based on their test
histories. However, current CD methods often model students, exercises, and
knowledge concepts solely on their ID relationships, neglecting the abundant
semantic relationships present within educational data space. Furthermore,
contemporary intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) frequently involve the addition
of new students and exercises, a situation that ID-based methods find
challenging to manage effectively. The advent of large language models (LLMs)
offers the potential for overcoming this challenge with open-world knowledge.
In this paper, we propose LLM4CD, which Leverages Large Language Models for
Open-World Knowledge Augmented Cognitive Diagnosis. Our method utilizes the
open-world knowledge of LLMs to construct cognitively expressive textual
representations, which are then encoded to introduce rich semantic information
into the CD task. Additionally, we propose an innovative bi-level encoder
framework that models students' test histories through two levels of encoders:
a macro-level cognitive text encoder and a micro-level knowledge state encoder.
This approach substitutes traditional ID embeddings with semantic
representations, enabling the model to accommodate new students and exercises
with open-world knowledge and address the cold-start problem. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method consistently
outperforms previous CD models on multiple real-world datasets, validating the
effectiveness of leveraging LLMs to introduce rich semantic information into
the CD task.

### [7] [IRLBench: A Multi-modal, Culturally Grounded, Parallel Irish-English Benchmark for Open-Ended LLM Reasoning Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13498)
*Khanh-Tung Tran,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IRLBench是一个针对多语言和低资源语言（如爱尔兰语）的评估基准，旨在解决现有基准的文化偏见和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在多语言和低资源语言评估中存在不足，IRLBench填补了这一空白。

Method: 基于2024年爱尔兰毕业考试开发12个代表性科目，采用长文本生成任务和官方评分标准。

Result: 实验显示，模型在爱尔兰语中的表现显著低于英语（正确率55.8% vs 76.2%）。

Conclusion: IRLBench为多语言AI发展提供了更全面的评估工具，呼吁更多研究关注低资源语言。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising
knowledge and reasoning abilities, yet their performance in multilingual and
low-resource settings remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often exhibit
cultural bias, restrict evaluation to text-only, rely on multiple-choice
formats, and, more importantly, are limited for extremely low-resource
languages. To address these gaps, we introduce IRLBench, presented in parallel
English and Irish, which is considered definitely endangered by UNESCO. Our
benchmark consists of 12 representative subjects developed from the 2024 Irish
Leaving Certificate exams, enabling fine-grained analysis of model capabilities
across domains. By framing the task as long-form generation and leveraging the
official marking scheme, it does not only support a comprehensive evaluation of
correctness but also language fidelity. Our extensive experiments of leading
closed-source and open-source LLMs reveal a persistent performance gap between
English and Irish, in which models produce valid Irish responses less than 80\%
of the time, and answer correctly 55.8\% of the time compared to 76.2\% in
English for the best-performing model. We release IRLBench
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/ReliableAI/IRLBench) and an accompanying
evaluation codebase (https://github.com/ReML-AI/IRLBench) to enable future
research on robust, culturally aware multilingual AI development.

### [8] [Noise Injection Systemically Degrades Large Language Model Safety Guardrails](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13500)
*Prithviraj Singh Shahani,Matthias Scheutz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型的安全护栏在激活噪声干扰下表现脆弱，安全微调无法提供额外保护，而链式推理能力基本不受影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型安全微调在噪声干扰下的鲁棒性，揭示当前安全对齐技术的漏洞。

Method: 通过向模型激活中注入高斯噪声，系统评估多个开源模型的安全性能。

Result: 高斯噪声使有害输出率显著增加（最高27%），安全微调无额外保护作用，链式推理能力保持稳定。

Conclusion: 当前安全对齐技术存在脆弱性，推理和强化学习方法可能是提升AI安全系统鲁棒性的方向。

Abstract: Safety guardrails in large language models (LLMs) are a critical component in
preventing harmful outputs. Yet, their resilience under perturbation remains
poorly understood. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of safety
fine-tuning in LLMs by systematically injecting Gaussian noise into model
activations. We show across multiple open-weight models that (1) Gaussian noise
raises harmful-output rates (p < 0.001) by up to 27%, (2) that deeper safety
fine-tuning affords no extra protection, and (3) that chain-of-thought
reasoning remains largely intact. The findings reveal critical vulnerabilities
in current safety alignment techniques and highlight the potential of
reasoning-based and reinforcement learning approaches as promising direction
for developing more robust AI safety systems. These results have important
implications for real-world deployment of LLMs in safety-critical applications
as these results imply that widely-deployed safety tuning methods can fail even
without adversarial prompts.

### [9] [EcoSafeRAG: Efficient Security through Context Analysis in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13506)
*Ruobing Yao,Yifei Zhang,Shuang Song,Neng Gao,Chenyang Tu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EcoSafeRAG通过句子级处理和诱饵引导的上下文多样性检测，在不依赖LLM内部知识的情况下识别恶意内容，提升RAG的安全性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG通过外部知识增强LLM的响应，但引入了新的攻击面（如语料库污染）。现有防御方法依赖模型内部知识，与RAG设计理念冲突。

Method: 使用句子级处理和诱饵引导的上下文多样性检测，分析候选文档的上下文多样性。

Result: 实验表明EcoSafeRAG在保持实用操作成本的同时，提供最先进的安全性，并提升干净场景下的RAG性能。

Conclusion: EcoSafeRAG是一种高效且安全的RAG防御方法，无需依赖LLM内部知识。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) compensates for the static knowledge
limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge,
producing responses with enhanced factual correctness and query-specific
contextualization. However, it also introduces new attack surfaces such as
corpus poisoning at the same time. Most of the existing defense methods rely on
the internal knowledge of the model, which conflicts with the design concept of
RAG. To bridge the gap, EcoSafeRAG uses sentence-level processing and
bait-guided context diversity detection to identify malicious content by
analyzing the context diversity of candidate documents without relying on LLM
internal knowledge. Experiments show EcoSafeRAG delivers state-of-the-art
security with plug-and-play deployment, simultaneously improving clean-scenario
RAG performance while maintaining practical operational costs (relatively
1.2$\times$ latency, 48\%-80\% token reduction versus Vanilla RAG).

### [10] [Time-R1: Towards Comprehensive Temporal Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13508)
*Zijia Liu,Peixuan Han,Haofei Yu,Haoru Li,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Time-R1是一个框架，通过三阶段强化学习课程，赋予3B参数的LLM全面的时间能力（理解、预测和创造性生成），并在实验中超越更大模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM缺乏强大的时间智能，难以整合过去推理与未来预测和生成，且现有方法泛化能力差。

Method: 采用三阶段强化学习课程，前两阶段基于动态规则奖励系统，逐步构建时间理解、预测和创造性生成能力。

Result: Time-R1在挑战性未来事件预测和创造性场景生成任务中，表现优于200倍大的模型（如671B DeepSeek-R1）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，精心设计的渐进式RL微调可使小型高效模型实现卓越时间性能，为时间感知AI提供可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities but lack
robust temporal intelligence, struggling to integrate reasoning about the past
with predictions and plausible generations of the future. Meanwhile, existing
methods typically target isolated temporal skills, such as question answering
about past events or basic forecasting, and exhibit poor generalization,
particularly when dealing with events beyond their knowledge cutoff or
requiring creative foresight. To address these limitations, we introduce
\textit{Time-R1}, the first framework to endow a moderate-sized (3B-parameter)
LLM with comprehensive temporal abilities: understanding, prediction, and
creative generation. Our approach features a novel three-stage development
path; the first two constitute a \textit{reinforcement learning (RL)
curriculum} driven by a meticulously designed dynamic rule-based reward system.
This framework progressively builds (1) foundational temporal understanding and
logical event-time mappings from historical data, (2) future event prediction
skills for events beyond its knowledge cutoff, and finally (3) enables
remarkable generalization to creative future scenario generation without any
fine-tuning. Strikingly, experiments demonstrate that Time-R1 outperforms
models over 200 times larger, including the state-of-the-art 671B DeepSeek-R1,
on highly challenging future event prediction and creative scenario generation
benchmarks. This work provides strong evidence that thoughtfully engineered,
progressive RL fine-tuning allows smaller, efficient models to achieve superior
temporal performance, offering a practical and scalable path towards truly
time-aware AI. To foster further research, we also release \textit{Time-Bench},
a large-scale multi-task temporal reasoning dataset derived from 10 years of
news data, and our series of \textit{Time-R1} checkpoints.

### [11] [Induction Head Toxicity Mechanistically Explains Repetition Curse in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13514)
*Shuxun Wang,Qingyu Yin,Chak Tou Leong,Qiang Zhang,Linyi Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现诱导头是大型语言模型重复生成行为的关键驱动因素，并提出了一种注意力头正则化技术来缓解此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重复诅咒现象广泛存在但其机制不明，研究旨在揭示诱导头在其中的作用。

Method: 聚焦诱导头的毒性，分析其在重复生成中对输出逻辑的主导作用，并提出注意力头正则化技术。

Result: 诱导头是重复诅咒的主要驱动因素，其主导性抑制了其他注意力头的贡献。

Conclusion: 研究为重复诅咒提供了机制解释，并提出了缓解方法，有助于改进LLM的设计与训练。

Abstract: Repetition curse is a phenomenon where Large Language Models (LLMs) generate
repetitive sequences of tokens or cyclic sequences. While the repetition curse
has been widely observed, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood.
In this work, we investigate the role of induction heads--a specific type of
attention head known for their ability to perform in-context learning--in
driving this repetitive behavior. Specifically, we focus on the "toxicity" of
induction heads, which we define as their tendency to dominate the model's
output logits during repetition, effectively excluding other attention heads
from contributing to the generation process. Our findings have important
implications for the design and training of LLMs. By identifying induction
heads as a key driver of the repetition curse, we provide a mechanistic
explanation for this phenomenon and suggest potential avenues for mitigation.
We also propose a technique with attention head regularization that could be
employed to reduce the dominance of induction heads during generation, thereby
promoting more diverse and coherent outputs.

*Jingyu Peng,Maolin Wang,Nan Wang,Xiangyu Zhao,Jiatong Li,Kai Zhang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LogiBreak是一种利用逻辑表达式翻译绕过LLM安全系统的黑盒越狱方法，通过将有害自然语言提示转换为形式逻辑表达式，利用对齐数据和逻辑输入之间的分布差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM与人类价值观对齐取得进展，但现有安全机制仍易受越狱攻击，作者认为这是由于对齐提示与恶意提示之间的分布差异。

Method: 提出LogiBreak方法，将有害自然语言提示转换为形式逻辑表达式，以利用分布差异绕过安全系统。

Result: 在多语言越狱数据集上验证了LogiBreak的有效性，证明其在多种评估设置和语言环境中的成功。

Conclusion: LogiBreak通过逻辑表达式翻译成功绕过LLM安全系统，揭示了现有对齐方法的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: Despite substantial advancements in aligning large language models (LLMs)
with human values, current safety mechanisms remain susceptible to jailbreak
attacks. We hypothesize that this vulnerability stems from distributional
discrepancies between alignment-oriented prompts and malicious prompts. To
investigate this, we introduce LogiBreak, a novel and universal black-box
jailbreak method that leverages logical expression translation to circumvent
LLM safety systems. By converting harmful natural language prompts into formal
logical expressions, LogiBreak exploits the distributional gap between
alignment data and logic-based inputs, preserving the underlying semantic
intent and readability while evading safety constraints. We evaluate LogiBreak
on a multilingual jailbreak dataset spanning three languages, demonstrating its
effectiveness across various evaluation settings and linguistic contexts.

*Zhanglin Wu,Daimeng Wei,Xiaoyu Chen,Hengchao Shang,Jiaxin Guo,Zongyao Li,Yuanchang Luo,Jinlong Yang,Zhiqiang Rao,Hao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合NMT和LLM的翻译调度策略，通过优化LLM使用频率，在保证翻译质量的同时降低计算成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在翻译任务中表现优异但计算成本高，而NMT系统效率更高。结合两者优势，仅在必要时使用LLM，以优化翻译性能和效率。

Method: 提出了一种基于源语句特征的调度策略，比较了多种调度方法，并设计了一个简单高效的决策器。

Result: 在多语言测试集上的实验表明，该方法能以最少的LLM使用实现最优翻译性能。

Conclusion: 结合NMT和LLM的调度策略是一种高效解决方案，能够在保证翻译质量的同时减少计算资源消耗。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) shows promising performances in a variety of
downstream tasks, such as machine translation (MT). However, using LLMs for
translation suffers from high computational costs and significant latency.
Based on our evaluation, in most cases, translations using LLMs are comparable
to that generated by neural machine translation (NMT) systems. Only in
particular scenarios, LLM and NMT models show respective advantages. As a
result, integrating NMT and LLM for translation and using LLM only when
necessary seems to be a sound solution. A scheduling policy that optimizes
translation result while ensuring fast speed and as little LLM usage as
possible is thereby required. We compare several scheduling policies and
propose a novel and straightforward decider that leverages source sentence
features. We conduct extensive experiments on multilingual test sets and the
result shows that we can achieve optimal translation performance with minimal
LLM usage, demonstrating effectiveness of our decider.

*Sathya Krishnan Suresh,Tanmay Surana,Lim Zhi Hao,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出CS-Sum基准，评估大语言模型（LLMs）对代码切换（CS）对话的理解能力，发现尽管自动评分高，但LLMs在处理CS输入时仍存在细微错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs对代码切换（CS）对话的理解能力，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 引入CS-Sum基准，涵盖三种语言对（EN-ZH、EN-TA、EN-MS），评估十种LLMs在少样本、翻译-总结和微调（LoRA、QLoRA）方法下的表现。

Result: LLMs在自动评分中表现良好，但存在细微错误，影响对话完整意义；不同语言对和LLMs的错误率各异。

Conclusion: LLMs需要针对代码切换数据进行专门训练，以减少错误并提升理解能力。

Abstract: Code-switching (CS) poses a significant challenge for Large Language Models
(LLMs), yet its comprehensibility remains underexplored in LLMs. We introduce
CS-Sum, to evaluate the comprehensibility of CS by the LLMs through CS dialogue
to English summarization. CS-Sum is the first benchmark for CS dialogue
summarization across Mandarin-English (EN-ZH), Tamil-English (EN-TA), and
Malay-English (EN-MS), with 900-1300 human-annotated dialogues per language
pair. Evaluating ten LLMs, including open and closed-source models, we analyze
performance across few-shot, translate-summarize, and fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA
on synthetic data) approaches. Our findings show that though the scores on
automated metrics are high, LLMs make subtle mistakes that alter the complete
meaning of the dialogue. To this end, we introduce 3 most common type of errors
that LLMs make when handling CS input. Error rates vary across CS pairs and
LLMs, with some LLMs showing more frequent errors on certain language pairs,
underscoring the need for specialized training on code-switched data.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索视觉信息是否能替代双语文本（bitexts）来对齐多语言句子表示，从而为低资源语言提供更高效的解决方案。

Method: 方法是通过多语言图像-标题对齐，隐式对齐文本表示，并验证其在跨语言自然语言理解和双语检索中的应用。

Result: 结果表明，多语言图像-标题对齐能有效对齐文本表示，即使预训练中未见的语言也能事后纳入对齐，且对齐表示适用于跨语言任务。

Conclusion: 结论是视觉信息可以替代双语文本对齐句子表示，为低资源语言提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multilingual alignment of sentence representations has mostly required
bitexts to bridge the gap between languages. We investigate whether visual
information can bridge this gap instead. Image caption datasets are very easy
to create without requiring multilingual expertise, so this offers a more
efficient alternative for low-resource languages. We find that multilingual
image-caption alignment can implicitly align the text representations between
languages, languages unseen by the encoder in pretraining can be incorporated
into this alignment post-hoc, and these aligned representations are usable for
cross-lingual Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and bitext retrieval.

*Charles J. Torres,Richard Futrell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于算法信息理论的跨文字统一度量方法，通过计算拼写与语音字符串的相互压缩性来量化正字法透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏一种统一的、与文字无关的正字法透明度度量方法，需要一种能够同时捕捉不规则拼写和规则复杂性的指标。

Method: 利用算法信息理论中的相互压缩性概念，结合神经序列模型的前缀码长度估计正字法透明度。

Result: 在22种语言和多种文字类型（如字母、辅音音素、音节、表意文字）中验证了该方法的有效性，结果符合对文字透明度的常见直觉。

Conclusion: 相互压缩性提供了一种简单、原则性强且通用的正字法透明度度量标准。

Abstract: Orthographic transparency -- how directly spelling is related to sound --
lacks a unified, script-agnostic metric. Using ideas from algorithmic
information theory, we quantify orthographic transparency in terms of the
mutual compressibility between orthographic and phonological strings. Our
measure provides a principled way to combine two factors that decrease
orthographic transparency, capturing both irregular spellings and rule
complexity in one quantity. We estimate our transparency measure using
prequential code-lengths derived from neural sequence models. Evaluating 22
languages across a broad range of script types (alphabetic, abjad, abugida,
syllabic, logographic) confirms common intuitions about relative transparency
of scripts. Mutual compressibility offers a simple, principled, and general
yardstick for orthographic transparency.

TL;DR: 研究比较了大型语言模型（如GPT-4、GPT-3.5和Claude 3 Opus）与基于Transformer的模型在检测新闻文章中的宣传技术方面的性能。GPT-4表现优于GPT-3.5和Claude 3 Opus，但未超过RoBERTa-CRF基线。所有LLM在检测某些宣传技术（如人身攻击）上优于MGN基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别宣传技术对做出明智决策至关重要，而NLP的进步为开发检测操纵性内容的系统提供了可能。

Method: 研究比较了多种大型语言模型（LLMs）和基于Transformer的模型在检测新闻文章中的宣传技术方面的性能。

Result: GPT-4的F1分数（0.16）优于GPT-3.5和Claude 3 Opus，但低于RoBERTa-CRF基线（0.67）。所有LLM在检测某些宣传技术上优于MGN基线。

Conclusion: 尽管GPT-4在检测宣传技术方面表现优异，但仍未超越某些传统模型，表明LLM在此任务上仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Propagandists use rhetorical devices that rely on logical fallacies and
emotional appeals to advance their agendas. Recognizing these techniques is key
to making informed decisions. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing
(NLP) have enabled the development of systems capable of detecting manipulative
content. In this study, we look at several Large Language Models and their
performance in detecting propaganda techniques in news articles. We compare the
performance of these LLMs with transformer-based models. We find that, while
GPT-4 demonstrates superior F1 scores (F1=0.16) compared to GPT-3.5 and Claude
3 Opus, it does not outperform a RoBERTa-CRF baseline (F1=0.67). Additionally,
we find that all three LLMs outperform a MultiGranularity Network (MGN)
baseline in detecting instances of one out of six propaganda techniques
(name-calling), with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 also outperforming the MGN baseline in
detecting instances of appeal to fear and flag-waving.

Conclusion: SQLForge有效提升开源模型性能，显著缩小与闭源模型的差距。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
text-to-SQL reasoning tasks, yet a substantial performance gap persists between
existing open-source models and their closed-source counterparts. In this
paper, we introduce SQLForge, a novel approach for synthesizing reliable and
diverse data to enhance text-to-SQL reasoning in LLMs. We improve data
reliability through SQL syntax constraints and SQL-to-question reverse
translation, ensuring data logic at both structural and semantic levels. We
also propose an SQL template enrichment and iterative data domain exploration
mechanism to boost data diversity. Building on the augmented data, we fine-tune
a variety of open-source models with different architectures and parameter
sizes, resulting in a family of models termed SQLForge-LM. SQLForge-LM achieves
the state-of-the-art performance on the widely recognized Spider and BIRD
benchmarks among the open-source models. Specifically, SQLForge-LM achieves EX
accuracy of 85.7% on Spider Dev and 59.8% on BIRD Dev, significantly narrowing
the performance gap with closed-source methods.

Conclusion: 该框架为仿真系统的用户友好性和LLM的准确性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Simulations, although powerful in accurately replicating real-world systems,
often remain inaccessible to non-technical users due to their complexity.
Conversely, large language models (LLMs) provide intuitive, language-based
interactions but can lack the structured, causal understanding required to
reliably model complex real-world dynamics. We introduce our simulation agent
framework, a novel approach that integrates the strengths of both simulation
models and LLMs. This framework helps empower users by leveraging the
conversational capabilities of LLMs to interact seamlessly with sophisticated
simulation systems, while simultaneously utilizing the simulations to ground
the LLMs in accurate and structured representations of real-world phenomena.
This integrated approach helps provide a robust and generalizable foundation
for empirical validation and offers broad applicability across diverse domains.

Motivation: 在交互式对话系统时代，用户对模型的准确性和透明性要求更高，但小型语言模型性能不足，而知识蒸馏方法试图通过推理痕迹提升其表现。然而，这些痕迹的忠实性和与最终性能的关联性尚未明确。

Method: 采用基于规则的问题分解知识蒸馏方法，将复杂查询分解为结构化子问题，生成可解释的推理痕迹，并在Open Book QA等数据集上进行实验。

Result: 实验发现，正确的推理痕迹并不一定导致最终答案正确，且中间痕迹与最终答案正确性相关性较低。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了利用推理痕迹提升小型语言模型性能的假设，表明需重新评估知识蒸馏中推理痕迹的作用。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) poses a challenging and critical problem,
particularly in today's age of interactive dialogue systems such as ChatGPT,
Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, etc. where users demand both accuracy and
transparency in the model's outputs. Since smaller language models (SLMs) are
computationally more efficient but often under-perform compared to larger
models, Knowledge Distillation (KD) methods allow for finetuning these smaller
models to improve their final performance. Lately, the intermediate tokens or
the so called `reasoning' traces produced by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) or by
reasoning models such as DeepSeek R1 are used as a training signal for KD.
However, these reasoning traces are often verbose and difficult to interpret or
evaluate. In this work, we aim to address the challenge of evaluating the
faithfulness of these reasoning traces and their correlation with the final
performance. To this end, we employ a KD method leveraging rule-based problem
decomposition. This approach allows us to break down complex queries into
structured sub-problems, generating interpretable traces whose correctness can
be readily evaluated, even at inference time. Specifically, we demonstrate this
approach on Open Book QA, decomposing the problem into a Classification step
and an Information Retrieval step, thereby simplifying trace evaluation. Our
SFT experiments with correct and incorrect traces on the CoTemp QA, Microsoft
Machine Reading Comprehension QA, and Facebook bAbI QA datasets reveal the
striking finding that correct traces do not necessarily imply that the model
outputs the correct final solution. Similarly, we find a low correlation
between correct final solutions and intermediate trace correctness. These
results challenge the implicit assumption behind utilizing reasoning traces for
improving SLMs' final performance via KD.

<details>

Motivation: 随着大语言模型参数和上下文窗口的增加，计算、能源和成本问题日益突出，亟需研究如何提升效率。

Method: 研究在48xGH200和8xH200 GPU集群上进行，评估了预训练架构（如MQA、GQA、MoE）、微调方法（如LoRA、RSLoRA）和推理技术（如int4量化），定义了六项细粒度指标。

Result: 研究发现效率与性能存在明确权衡，不同任务和规模下最优方法不同，且技术可跨模态推广。

Conclusion: EfficientLLM为下一代基础模型的效率优化提供了重要指导，并开源了数据集和评估工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven significant progress, yet their
growing parameter counts and context windows incur prohibitive compute, energy,
and monetary costs. We introduce EfficientLLM, a novel benchmark and the first
comprehensive empirical study evaluating efficiency techniques for LLMs at
scale. Conducted on a production-class cluster (48xGH200, 8xH200 GPUs), our
study systematically explores three key axes: (1) architecture pretraining
(efficient attention variants: MQA, GQA, MLA, NSA; sparse Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE)), (2) fine-tuning (parameter-efficient methods: LoRA, RSLoRA, DoRA), and
(3) inference (quantization methods: int4, float16). We define six fine-grained
metrics (Memory Utilization, Compute Utilization, Latency, Throughput, Energy
Consumption, Compression Rate) to capture hardware saturation,
latency-throughput balance, and carbon cost. Evaluating over 100
model-technique pairs (0.5B-72B parameters), we derive three core insights: (i)
Efficiency involves quantifiable trade-offs: no single method is universally
optimal; e.g., MoE reduces FLOPs and improves accuracy but increases VRAM by
40%, while int4 quantization cuts memory/energy by up to 3.9x at a 3-5%
accuracy drop. (ii) Optima are task- and scale-dependent: MQA offers optimal
memory-latency trade-offs for constrained devices, MLA achieves lowest
perplexity for quality-critical tasks, and RSLoRA surpasses LoRA efficiency
only beyond 14B parameters. (iii) Techniques generalize across modalities: we
extend evaluations to Large Vision Models (Stable Diffusion 3.5, Wan 2.1) and
Vision-Language Models (Qwen2.5-VL), confirming effective transferability. By
open-sourcing datasets, evaluation pipelines, and leaderboards, EfficientLLM
provides essential guidance for researchers and engineers navigating the
efficiency-performance landscape of next-generation foundation models.

Conclusion: 整合联想记忆能有效改进语言模型与大脑的对齐性，特定监督微调进一步提升了这种对齐效果。

Abstract: Associative memory engages in the integration of relevant information for
comprehension in the human cognition system. In this work, we seek to improve
alignment between language models and human brain while processing speech
information by integrating associative memory. After verifying the alignment
between language model and brain by mapping language model activations to brain
activity, the original text stimuli expanded with simulated associative memory
are regarded as input to computational language models. We find the alignment
between language model and brain is improved in brain regions closely related
to associative memory processing. We also demonstrate large language models
after specific supervised fine-tuning better align with brain response, by
building the \textit{Association} dataset containing 1000 samples of stories,
with instructions encouraging associative memory as input and associated
content as output.

Abstract: As state-of-the-art language models continue to improve, the need for robust

current state-of-the-art machine text detectors struggle to adapt to new unseen
domains and generative models. In this paper we present DoGEN (Domain Gating
Ensemble Networks), a technique that allows detectors to adapt to unseen
domains by ensembling a set of domain expert detector models using weights from
a domain classifier. We test DoGEN on a wide variety of domains from leading
benchmarks and find that it achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain
detection while outperforming models twice its size on out-of-domain detection.
We release our code and trained models to assist in future research in
domain-adaptive AI detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理语言模型通过生成冗长中间推理路径提高准确性，但导致内存和生成延迟增加，限制了实际部署。

Method: RPC通过定期压缩KV缓存，保留重要性高的部分，重要性分数由最近生成的查询组成的选择器窗口计算。

Result: 实验显示，RPC将QwQ-32B的生成吞吐量提升至1.60倍，AIME 2024基准上准确率仅下降1.2%。

Conclusion: RPC证明推理路径的语义稀疏性可有效用于压缩，为高效部署推理语言模型提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Recent reasoning-focused language models achieve high accuracy by generating
lengthy intermediate reasoning paths before producing final answers. While this
approach is effective in solving problems that require logical thinking, long
reasoning paths significantly increase memory usage and throughput of token
generation, limiting the practical deployment of such models. We propose
Reasoning Path Compression (RPC), a training-free method that accelerates
inference by leveraging the semantic sparsity of reasoning paths. RPC
periodically compresses the KV cache by retaining KV cache that receive high
importance score, which are computed using a selector window composed of
recently generated queries. Experiments show that RPC improves generation
throughput of QwQ-32B by up to 1.60$\times$ compared to the inference with full
KV cache, with an accuracy drop of 1.2% on the AIME 2024 benchmark. Our
findings demonstrate that semantic sparsity in reasoning traces can be
effectively exploited for compression, offering a practical path toward
efficient deployment of reasoning LLMs. Our code is available at

Conclusion: Code2Logic为视觉语言推理数据提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，展示了游戏代码在数据生成中的潜力。

Abstract: Visual-language Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data resources are relatively scarce
compared to text-only counterparts, limiting the improvement of reasoning
capabilities in Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, high-quality
vision-language reasoning data is expensive and labor-intensive to annotate. To
address this issue, we leverage a promising resource: game code, which
naturally contains logical structures and state transition processes.
Therefore, we propose Code2Logic, a novel game-code-driven approach for
multimodal reasoning data synthesis. Our approach leverages Large Language
Models (LLMs) to adapt game code, enabling automatic acquisition of reasoning
processes and results through code execution. Using the Code2Logic approach, we
developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is
cost-effective and scalable to produce, challenging for state-of-the-art
models, and diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Surprisingly, despite training
solely on game data, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization,
specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33\% across 7 diverse
vision-language benchmarks. Our code and dataset are available at

Result: 研究发现推理结构属性（如探索密度、分支比）与准确性密切相关，提示策略显著影响推理结构。

Conclusion: 该框架为推理质量评估和提示工程提供了新工具，推动了LLMs认知分析的研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time scaling have enabled Large Language Models
(LLMs) to display sophisticated reasoning abilities via extended
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation. Despite their potential, these Reasoning
LLMs (RLMs) often demonstrate counterintuitive and unstable behaviors, such as
performance degradation under few-shot prompting, that challenge our current
understanding of RLMs. In this work, we introduce a unified graph-based
analytical framework for better modeling the reasoning processes of RLMs. Our
method first clusters long, verbose CoT outputs into semantically coherent
reasoning steps, then constructs directed reasoning graphs to capture
contextual and logical dependencies among these steps. Through comprehensive
analysis across models and prompting regimes, we reveal that structural
properties, such as exploration density, branching, and convergence ratios,
strongly correlate with reasoning accuracy. Our findings demonstrate how
prompting strategies substantially reshape the internal reasoning structure of
RLMs, directly affecting task outcomes. The proposed framework not only enables
quantitative evaluation of reasoning quality beyond conventional metrics but
also provides practical insights for prompt engineering and the cognitive
analysis of LLMs. Code and resources will be released to facilitate future
research in this direction.

Motivation: 现有基于logit的融合方法忽略了词汇维度间的语义依赖关系，而这些依赖关系对于融合具有不同生成行为的模型至关重要。

Method: 提出InfiGFusion框架，通过全局共激活图（节点为词汇通道，边为联合激活）建模语义依赖，并设计了一种排序闭式近似方法以降低计算成本。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，InfiGFusion优于现有SOTA模型和融合基线，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现突出（如Multistep Arithmetic提升35.6，Causal Judgement提升37.06）。

Conclusion: InfiGFusion通过显式建模语义依赖关系，显著提升了模型融合的性能，尤其在复杂推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have intensified efforts to
fuse heterogeneous open-source models into a unified system that inherits their
complementary strengths. Existing logit-based fusion methods maintain inference
efficiency but treat vocabulary dimensions independently, overlooking semantic
dependencies encoded by cross-dimension interactions. These dependencies
reflect how token types interact under a model's internal reasoning and are
essential for aligning models with diverse generation behaviors. To explicitly
model these dependencies, we propose \textbf{InfiGFusion}, the first
structure-aware fusion framework with a novel \textit{Graph-on-Logits
Distillation} (GLD) loss. Specifically, we retain the top-$k$ logits per output
and aggregate their outer products across sequence positions to form a global
co-activation graph, where nodes represent vocabulary channels and edges
quantify their joint activations. To ensure scalability and efficiency, we
design a sorting-based closed-form approximation that reduces the original
$O(n^4)$ cost of Gromov-Wasserstein distance to $O(n \log n)$, with provable
approximation guarantees. Experiments across multiple fusion settings show that
GLD consistently improves fusion quality and stability. InfiGFusion outperforms
SOTA models and fusion baselines across 11 benchmarks spanning reasoning,
coding, and mathematics. It shows particular strength in complex reasoning
tasks, with +35.6 improvement on Multistep Arithmetic and +37.06 on Causal
Judgement over SFT, demonstrating superior multi-step and relational inference.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress in
mathematical reasoning. To enable such capabilities, many existing works
distill strong reasoning models into long chains of thought or design
algorithms to construct high-quality math QA data for training. However, these
efforts primarily focus on generating correct reasoning paths and answers,
while largely overlooking the validity of the questions themselves. In this
work, we propose Math Question Verification (MathQ-Verify), a novel five-stage
pipeline designed to rigorously filter ill-posed or under-specified math
problems. MathQ-Verify first performs format-level validation to remove
redundant instructions and ensure that each question is syntactically
well-formed. It then formalizes each question, decomposes it into atomic
conditions, and verifies them against mathematical definitions. Next, it
detects logical contradictions among these conditions, followed by a
goal-oriented completeness check to ensure the question provides sufficient
information for solving. To evaluate this task, we use existing benchmarks
along with an additional dataset we construct, containing 2,147 math questions
with diverse error types, each manually double-validated. Experiments show that
MathQ-Verify achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks,
improving the F1 score by up to 25 percentage points over the direct
verification baseline. It further attains approximately 90% precision and 63%
recall through a lightweight model voting scheme. MathQ-Verify offers a
scalable and accurate solution for curating reliable mathematical datasets,
reducing label noise and avoiding unnecessary computation on invalid questions.

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer has become a crucial aspect of multilingual NLP, as it
allows for models trained on resource-rich languages to be applied to
low-resource languages more effectively. Recently massively multilingual
pre-trained language models (e.g., mBERT, XLM-R) demonstrate strong zero-shot
transfer capabilities[14] [13]. This paper investigates cross-linguistic
transfer through the lens of language families and morphology. Investigating
how language family proximity and morphological similarity affect performance
across NLP tasks. We further discuss our results and how it relates to findings
from recent literature. Overall, we compare multilingual model performance and
review how linguistic distance metrics correlate with transfer outcomes. We
also look into emerging approaches that integrate typological and morphological
information into model pre-training to improve transfer to diverse
languages[18] [19].

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于大规模平行数据集的通用机制，解释词序变化，支持语言演化的‘最小-最大’理论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语言表面结构（如词序）的起源，解决先天论与功能论之间的分歧。

Method: 使用包含1,500多种语言的大规模标记平行数据集，分析词类长度与词序的关系。

Result: 词类长度与词序显著相关，支持处理和信息结构的竞争压力理论，预测历史词序变化。

Conclusion: 提出‘最小-最大’理论，整合处理和信息结构的竞争压力，解释语言演化。

Abstract: Current theories of language propose an innate (Baker 2001; Chomsky 1981) or
a functional (Greenberg 1963; Dryer 2007; Hawkins 2014) origin for the surface
structures (i.e. word order) that we observe in languages of the world, while
evolutionary modeling (Dunn et al. 2011) suggests that descent is the primary
factor influencing such patterns. Although there are hypotheses for word order
change from both innate and usage-based perspectives for specific languages and
families, there are key disagreements between the two major proposals for
mechanisms that drive the evolution of language more broadly (Wasow 2002; Levy
2008). This paper proposes a universal underlying mechanism for word order
change based on a large tagged parallel dataset of over 1,500 languages
representing 133 language families and 111 isolates. Results indicate that word
class length is significantly correlated with word order crosslinguistically,
but not in a straightforward manner, partially supporting opposing theories of
processing, while at the same time predicting historical word order change in
two different phylogenetic lines and explaining more variance than descent or
language area in regression models. Such findings suggest an integrated
"Min-Max" theory of language evolution driven by competing pressures of
processing and information structure, aligning with recent efficiency-oriented
(Levshina 2023) and information-theoretic proposals (Zaslavsky 2020; Tucker et
al. 2025).

TL;DR: R1 Translator模型结合双向LSTM编码器和预训练Transformer解码器，显著提升EEG信号到文本的解码性能，在多项指标上优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG到文本解码模型性能有限，需改进以缩小人脑与语言处理之间的差距。

Method: R1 Translator采用双向LSTM编码器捕捉EEG信号的时序依赖，结合Transformer解码器生成高质量文本。

Result: R1在ROUGE-1（38.00%）、ROUGE-L（32.51%）、CER（0.5795）和WER（0.7280）上均优于T5和Brain Translator。

Conclusion: R1 Translator在EEG到文本解码任务中表现卓越，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models like Gemini, GPT, and
others, bridging the gap between the human brain and language processing has
become an important area of focus. To address this challenge, researchers have
developed various models to decode EEG signals into text. However, these models
still face significant performance limitations. To overcome these shortcomings,
we propose a new model, R1 Translator, which aims to improve the performance of
EEG-to-text decoding. The R1 Translator model combines a bidirectional LSTM
encoder with a pretrained transformer-based decoder, utilizing EEG features to
produce high-quality text outputs. The model processes EEG embeddings through
the LSTM to capture sequential dependencies, which are then fed into the
transformer decoder for effective text generation. The R1 Translator excels in
ROUGE metrics, outperforming both T5 (previous research) and Brain Translator.
Specifically, R1 achieves a ROUGE-1 score of 38.00% (P), which is up to 9%
higher than T5 (34.89%) and 3% better than Brain (35.69%). It also leads in
ROUGE-L, with a F1 score of 32.51%, outperforming T5 by 3% (29.67%) and Brain
by 2% (30.38%). In terms of CER, R1 achieves a CER of 0.5795, which is 2% lower
than T5 (0.5917) and 4% lower than Brain (0.6001). Additionally, R1 performs
better in WER with a score of 0.7280, outperforming T5 by 4.3% (0.7610) and
Brain by 3.6% (0.7553). Code is available at

TL;DR: WAVE++提出了一种基于提示的方法，通过任务特定提示池和标签描述改进持续关系抽取，解决了任务识别和遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示的方法在持续关系抽取中存在任务识别不准确和遗忘问题，亟需更灵活的解决方案。

Method: 引入任务特定提示池和标签描述，结合生成模型整合先验知识，无需显式存储数据。

Result: WAVE++在实验中优于现有基于提示和基于记忆的方法。

Conclusion: WAVE++为持续关系抽取提供了更鲁棒的解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Memory-based approaches have shown strong performance in Continual Relation
Extraction (CRE). However, storing examples from previous tasks increases
memory usage and raises privacy concerns. Recently, prompt-based methods have
emerged as a promising alternative, as they do not rely on storing past
samples. Despite this progress, current prompt-based techniques face several
core challenges in CRE, particularly in accurately identifying task identities
and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Existing prompt selection strategies
often suffer from inaccuracies, lack robust mechanisms to prevent forgetting in
shared parameters, and struggle to handle both cross-task and within-task
variations. In this paper, we propose WAVE++, a novel approach inspired by the
connection between prefix-tuning and mixture of experts. Specifically, we
introduce task-specific prompt pools that enhance flexibility and adaptability
across diverse tasks while avoiding boundary-spanning risks; this design more
effectively captures variations within each task and across tasks. To further
refine relation classification, we incorporate label descriptions that provide
richer, more global context, enabling the model to better distinguish among
different relations. We also propose a training-free mechanism to improve task
prediction during inference. Moreover, we integrate a generative model to
consolidate prior knowledge within the shared parameters, thereby removing the
need for explicit data storage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WAVE++
outperforms state-of-the-art prompt-based and rehearsal-based methods, offering
a more robust solution for continual relation extraction. Our code is publicly

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种以记忆为中心的EQA框架MemoryEQA，通过多模态分层记忆机制提升复杂任务处理效率与准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EQA框架以规划器为中心，记忆模块无法充分与其他模块交互，限制了复杂任务（如跨区域多目标任务）的处理能力。

Method: 提出MemoryEQA框架，采用全局记忆（语言增强场景图）和局部记忆（历史观察与状态信息）的分层机制，并利用多模态大语言模型转换记忆信息以适应不同模块输入。

Result: 在HM-EQA、MT-HM3D和OpenEQA数据集上验证有效性，MT-HM3D上性能提升19.8%，凸显记忆能力对复杂任务的关键作用。

Conclusion: MemoryEQA通过增强记忆模块的交互能力，显著提升了EQA任务的处理效率与准确性，尤其在多目标跨区域任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to autonomously explore and
understand the environment to answer context-dependent questions. Existing
frameworks typically center around the planner, which guides the stopping
module, memory module, and answering module for reasoning. In this paper, we
propose a memory-centric EQA framework named MemoryEQA. Unlike planner-centric
EQA models where the memory module cannot fully interact with other modules,
MemoryEQA flexible feeds memory information into all modules, thereby enhancing
efficiency and accuracy in handling complex tasks, such as those involving
multiple targets across different regions. Specifically, we establish a
multi-modal hierarchical memory mechanism, which is divided into global memory
that stores language-enhanced scene maps, and local memory that retains
historical observations and state information. When performing EQA tasks, the
multi-modal large language model is leveraged to convert memory information
into the required input formats for injection into different modules. To
evaluate EQA models' memory capabilities, we constructed the MT-HM3D dataset
based on HM3D, comprising 1,587 question-answer pairs involving multiple
targets across various regions, which requires agents to maintain memory of
exploration-acquired target information. Experimental results on HM-EQA,
MT-HM3D, and OpenEQA demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, where a
19.8% performance gain on MT-HM3D compared to baseline model further
underscores memory capability's pivotal role in resolving complex tasks.

*Guochao Jiang,Guofeng Quan,Zepeng Ding,Ziqin Luo,Dixuan Wang,Zheng Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FlashThink的方法，通过验证模型提前终止大语言模型（LLMs）的推理过程，以减少冗余计算，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在推理任务中表现优异，但常生成冗长的推理内容，导致计算开销大。实验表明，模型在推理过程中可能已能提供正确答案，无需完成全部推理。

Method: 引入验证模型，识别模型可提前终止推理的时刻，从而缩短推理内容。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，FlashThink显著减少了推理内容长度（如Deepseek-R1和QwQ-32B模型分别减少77.04%和77.47%），同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: FlashThink方法高效地优化了LLMs的推理过程，减少了计算开销，且不影响模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in reasoning
tasks. However, LLMs tend to generate excessively long reasoning content,
leading to significant computational overhead. Our observations indicate that
even on simple problems, LLMs tend to produce unnecessarily lengthy reasoning
content, which is against intuitive expectations. Preliminary experiments show
that at a certain point during the generation process, the model is already
capable of producing the correct solution without completing the full reasoning
content. Therefore, we consider that the reasoning process of the model can be
exited early to achieve the purpose of efficient reasoning. We introduce a
verification model that identifies the exact moment when the model can stop
reasoning and still provide the correct answer. Comprehensive experiments on
four different benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method, FlashThink,
effectively shortens the reasoning content while preserving the model accuracy.
For the Deepseek-R1 and QwQ-32B models, we reduced the length of reasoning
content by 77.04% and 77.47%, respectively, without reducing the accuracy.

TL;DR: 量化方法对大型语言模型（LLM）的可解释性和透明度影响不一，取决于量化方法、解释性方法及评估协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化对LLM能力的退化已有研究，但其对模型可解释性和透明度的影响尚未探索。

Method: 使用三种量化技术和两种解释性方法（反事实示例和自然语言解释）及两种可解释性方法（知识记忆分析和潜在多跳推理分析）进行实验，并结合用户研究。

Result: 量化对可解释性和透明度的影响不一致，可能退化或提升，具体取决于量化方法、解释性方法和评估协议。

Conclusion: 量化可能不可预测地影响模型透明度，对透明度要求高的LLM应用部署需谨慎。

Abstract: Quantization methods are widely used to accelerate inference and streamline
the deployment of large language models (LLMs). While prior research has
extensively investigated the degradation of various LLM capabilities due to
quantization, its effects on model explainability and interpretability, which
are crucial for understanding decision-making processes, remain unexplored. To
address this gap, we conduct comprehensive experiments using three common
quantization techniques at distinct bit widths, in conjunction with two
explainability methods, counterfactual examples and natural language
explanations, as well as two interpretability approaches, knowledge
memorization analysis and latent multi-hop reasoning analysis. We complement
our analysis with a thorough user study, evaluating selected explainability
methods. Our findings reveal that, depending on the configuration, quantization
can significantly impact model explainability and interpretability. Notably,
the direction of this effect is not consistent, as it strongly depends on (1)
the quantization method, (2) the explainability or interpretability approach,
and (3) the evaluation protocol. In some settings, human evaluation shows that
quantization degrades explainability, while in others, it even leads to
improvements. Our work serves as a cautionary tale, demonstrating that
quantization can unpredictably affect model transparency. This insight has
important implications for deploying LLMs in applications where transparency is
a critical requirement.

TL;DR: CAFES是一个多智能体协作框架，用于提升自动作文评分（AES）的准确性和与人类评分的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AES方法在评估泛化性和多模态感知方面表现不佳，而现有的MLLM方法可能产生与人类评分不一致的结果。

Method: CAFES框架包含三个智能体：初始评分器、反馈池管理器和反思评分器，通过协作迭代优化评分。

Result: 实验显示，CAFES在QWK指标上相对提升了21%，尤其在语法和词汇多样性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: CAFES为智能多模态AES系统的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is crucial for modern education, particularly
with the increasing prevalence of multimodal assessments. However, traditional
AES methods struggle with evaluation generalizability and multimodal
perception, while even recent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based
approaches can produce hallucinated justifications and scores misaligned with
human judgment. To address the limitations, we introduce CAFES, the first
collaborative multi-agent framework specifically designed for AES. It
orchestrates three specialized agents: an Initial Scorer for rapid,
trait-specific evaluations; a Feedback Pool Manager to aggregate detailed,
evidence-grounded strengths; and a Reflective Scorer that iteratively refines
scores based on this feedback to enhance human alignment. Extensive
experiments, using state-of-the-art MLLMs, achieve an average relative
improvement of 21% in Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) against ground truth,
especially for grammatical and lexical diversity. Our proposed CAFES framework
paves the way for an intelligent multimodal AES system. The code will be
available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨评判模型与生成模型之间的关系对反事实数据增强（CDA）效果的影响，以提升语言模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过实验分析四种生成模型与评判模型的关系，涉及两种先进LLM方法、三个数据集、五个生成模型和15个评判模型，并辅以用户研究（n=90）。

Result: 独立且未经微调的评判模型表现最佳，但与用户研究结果仍有较大差距，表明自动化CDA流程需人工干预。

Conclusion: 评判模型与生成模型的关系显著影响CDA效果，但完全自动化流程尚不成熟，需结合人工评估。

Abstract: Counterfactual examples are widely employed to enhance the performance and
robustness of large language models (LLMs) through counterfactual data
augmentation (CDA). However, the selection of the judge model used to evaluate
label flipping, the primary metric for assessing the validity of generated
counterfactuals for CDA, yields inconsistent results. To decipher this, we
define four types of relationships between the counterfactual generator and
judge models. Through extensive experiments involving two state-of-the-art
LLM-based methods, three datasets, five generator models, and 15 judge models,
complemented by a user study (n = 90), we demonstrate that judge models with an
independent, non-fine-tuned relationship to the generator model provide the
most reliable label flipping evaluations. Relationships between the generator
and judge models, which are closely aligned with the user study for CDA, result
in better model performance and robustness. Nevertheless, we find that the gap
between the most effective judge models and the results obtained from the user
study remains considerably large. This suggests that a fully automated pipeline
for CDA may be inadequate and requires human intervention.

Result: GRPO-based RL调优在准确性和推理质量上均优于标准SFT。

Conclusion: 研究为医学MLLMs的领域特异性微调提供了新见解，并证实了GRPO在医学任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL)-based tuning has shifted the trajectory
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly following the
introduction of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, directly
applying it to medical tasks remains challenging for achieving clinically
grounded model behavior. Motivated by the need to align model response with
clinical expectations, we investigate four critical dimensions that affect the
effectiveness of RL-based tuning in medical visual question answering (VQA):
base model initialization strategy, the role of medical semantic alignment, the
impact of length-based rewards on long-chain reasoning, and the influence of
bias. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze these factors for medical
MLLMs, providing new insights into how models are domain-specifically
fine-tuned. Additionally, our results also demonstrate that GRPO-based RL
tuning consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both
accuracy and reasoning quality.

TL;DR: DRP框架通过推理剪枝和蒸馏技术提升大型推理模型的效率，减少冗余推理路径，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但推理过程冗长且低效，需优化。

Method: 提出DRP框架，结合推理剪枝和蒸馏技术，通过教师模型分解和剪枝推理路径，再蒸馏到学生模型。

Result: 在数学推理数据集上，DRP显著减少token使用（如GSM8K从917降至328），同时提升准确性（如从91.7%至94.1%）。

Conclusion: DRP通过优化推理结构和蒸馏技术，实现了高效且准确的推理，为模型效率提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: While Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated success in complex
reasoning tasks through long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, their inference
often involves excessively verbose reasoning traces, resulting in substantial
inefficiency. To address this, we propose Distilled Reasoning Pruning (DRP), a
hybrid framework that combines inference-time pruning with tuning-based
distillation, two widely used strategies for efficient reasoning. DRP uses a
teacher model to perform skill-aware step decomposition and content pruning,
and then distills the pruned reasoning paths into a student model, enabling it
to reason both efficiently and accurately. Across several challenging
mathematical reasoning datasets, we find that models trained with DRP achieve
substantial improvements in token efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.
Specifically, DRP reduces average token usage on GSM8K from 917 to 328 while
improving accuracy from 91.7% to 94.1%, and achieves a 43% token reduction on
AIME with no performance drop. Further analysis shows that aligning the
reasoning structure of training CoTs with the student's reasoning capacity is
critical for effective knowledge transfer and performance gains.

Motivation: 多模态模型在共情检测中表现关键，但模态间的冲突信号可能导致性能下降，需深入理解此类失败案例。

Method: 使用文本、音频和视频的微调模型及门控融合模型，分析单模态与多模态预测的分歧情况。

Result: 研究发现分歧常由模态间信号不一致引起，且人类在多模态输入下也未持续受益。

Conclusion: 分歧可作为诊断信号，帮助识别挑战性案例并提升共情检测系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal models play a key role in empathy detection, but their performance
can suffer when modalities provide conflicting cues. To understand these
failures, we examine cases where unimodal and multimodal predictions diverge.
Using fine-tuned models for text, audio, and video, along with a gated fusion
model, we find that such disagreements often reflect underlying ambiguity, as
evidenced by annotator uncertainty. Our analysis shows that dominant signals in
one modality can mislead fusion when unsupported by others. We also observe
that humans, like models, do not consistently benefit from multimodal input.
These insights position disagreement as a useful diagnostic signal for
identifying challenging examples and improving empathy system robustness.

Result: 标准RFT降低拒绝率80%，加入10% SUM数据显著恢复拒绝行为，且不影响任务准确性。

Conclusion: 结合SUM数据的RFT能提升模型对不确定性和知识边界的推理能力，适用于更广泛任务。

Abstract: Reinforcement finetuning (RFT) has become a standard approach for enhancing
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, its impact
on model trustworthiness remains underexplored. In this work, we identify and
systematically study a critical side effect of RFT, which we term the
hallucination tax: a degradation in refusal behavior causing models to produce
hallucinated answers to unanswerable questions confidently. To investigate
this, we introduce SUM (Synthetic Unanswerable Math), a high-quality dataset of
unanswerable math problems designed to probe models' ability to recognize an
unanswerable question by reasoning from the insufficient or ambiguous
information. Our results show that standard RFT training could reduce model
refusal rates by more than 80%, which significantly increases model's tendency
to hallucinate. We further demonstrate that incorporating just 10% SUM during
RFT substantially restores appropriate refusal behavior, with minimal accuracy
trade-offs on solvable tasks. Crucially, this approach enables LLMs to leverage
inference-time compute to reason about their own uncertainty and knowledge
boundaries, improving generalization not only to out-of-domain math problems
but also to factual question answering tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部资源生成指令数据，限制了灵活性和泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明DecIF在指令跟随任务中表现优异，具有灵活性、可扩展性和泛化性。

Conclusion: DecIF能自动合成高质量指令数据，为LLMs的指令跟随能力提供了新思路。

Abstract: Instruction-following has emerged as a crucial capability for large language
models (LLMs). However, existing approaches often rely on pre-existing
documents or external resources to synthesize instruction-following data, which
limits their flexibility and generalizability. In this paper, we introduce
DecIF, a fully autonomous, meta-decomposition guided framework that generates
diverse and high-quality instruction-following data using only LLMs. DecIF is
grounded in the principle of decomposition. For instruction generation, we
guide LLMs to iteratively produce various types of meta-information, which are
then combined with response constraints to form well-structured and
semantically rich instructions. We further utilize LLMs to detect and resolve
potential inconsistencies within the generated instructions. Regarding response
generation, we decompose each instruction into atomic-level evaluation
criteria, enabling rigorous validation and the elimination of inaccurate
instruction-response pairs. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
scenarios and settings demonstrate DecIF's superior performance on
instruction-following tasks. Further analysis highlights its strong
flexibility, scalability, and generalizability in automatically synthesizing
high-quality instruction data.

Motivation: 现有研究仅关注可验证的谄媚行为，忽略了模糊情境中的谄媚问题，如建议和支持寻求，这些情境可能强化有害的隐含假设或行为。

Method: 提出了社交谄媚理论，并开发了ELEPHANT框架，评估了五种保留用户面子的行为，使用了两个数据集（OEQ和AITA）对八种模型进行了测试。

Result: LLMs在社交谄媚方面表现显著：在OEQ中比人类多保留面子47%，在AITA中42%的情况下肯定了不当行为。

Conclusion: 社交谄媚在偏好数据集中受到奖励且难以缓解，研究为理解和解决这一问题提供了理论基础和实证工具。

Abstract: A serious risk to the safety and utility of LLMs is sycophancy, i.e.,
excessive agreement with and flattery of the user. Yet existing work focuses on
only one aspect of sycophancy: agreement with users' explicitly stated beliefs
that can be compared to a ground truth. This overlooks forms of sycophancy that
arise in ambiguous contexts such as advice and support-seeking, where there is
no clear ground truth, yet sycophancy can reinforce harmful implicit
assumptions, beliefs, or actions. To address this gap, we introduce a richer
theory of social sycophancy in LLMs, characterizing sycophancy as the excessive
preservation of a user's face (the positive self-image a person seeks to
maintain in an interaction). We present ELEPHANT, a framework for evaluating
social sycophancy across five face-preserving behaviors (emotional validation,
moral endorsement, indirect language, indirect action, and accepting framing)
on two datasets: open-ended questions (OEQ) and Reddit's r/AmITheAsshole
(AITA). Across eight models, we show that LLMs consistently exhibit high rates
of social sycophancy: on OEQ, they preserve face 47% more than humans, and on
AITA, they affirm behavior deemed inappropriate by crowdsourced human judgments
in 42% of cases. We further show that social sycophancy is rewarded in
preference datasets and is not easily mitigated. Our work provides theoretical
grounding and empirical tools (datasets and code) for understanding and
addressing this under-recognized but consequential issue.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ACM的模型合并框架，通过激活引导的共识合并方法，解决了传统模型合并中忽略层功能异质性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练和提示方法在效率和稳定性上存在挑战，而传统模型合并方法假设层重要性均匀，忽略了神经组件的功能异质性。

Method: ACM框架基于预训练和微调模型激活间的互信息，动态确定层特定合并系数，无需梯度计算或额外训练。

Result: 在L2S和通用合并任务中，ACM表现优于基线方法，例如在Qwen-7B模型上，响应长度减少55.3%，推理准确率提升1.3分。

Conclusion: ACM是一种高效且无需额外训练的模型合并方法，显著提升了性能，代码将公开以促进复现。

Abstract: Recent research has increasingly focused on reconciling the reasoning
capabilities of System 2 with the efficiency of System 1. While existing
training-based and prompt-based approaches face significant challenges in terms
of efficiency and stability, model merging emerges as a promising strategy to
integrate the diverse capabilities of different Large Language Models (LLMs)
into a unified model. However, conventional model merging methods often assume
uniform importance across layers, overlooking the functional heterogeneity
inherent in neural components. To address this limitation, we propose
\textbf{A}ctivation-Guided \textbf{C}onsensus \textbf{M}erging (\textbf{ACM}),
a plug-and-play merging framework that determines layer-specific merging
coefficients based on mutual information between activations of pre-trained and
fine-tuned models. ACM effectively preserves task-specific capabilities without
requiring gradient computations or additional training. Extensive experiments
on Long-to-Short (L2S) and general merging tasks demonstrate that ACM
consistently outperforms all baseline methods. For instance, in the case of
Qwen-7B models, TIES-Merging equipped with ACM achieves a \textbf{55.3\%}
reduction in response length while simultaneously improving reasoning accuracy
by \textbf{1.3} points. We submit the code with the paper for reproducibility,
and it will be publicly available.

*Tai D. Nguyen,Long H. Pham,Jun Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoLaw提出了一种结合对抗数据生成和陪审团式审议的框架，用于提升领域特定大语言模型（LLMs）的法律合规性，并适应不同地区的法律差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律评估基准缺乏适应性和对本地多样性的考虑，限制了其在动态监管环境中的实用性。

Method: AutoLaw通过动态合成案例法反映地方法规，并利用LLM陪审团模拟司法决策，减少偏见并提高检测准确性。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，AutoLaw显著提升了违规检测率，对抗数据生成增强了LLM的辨别能力。

Conclusion: AutoLaw为法律敏感应用中的LLM评估和增强提供了可扩展的解决方案，能够自适应地探测法律偏差并提供可靠判断。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of domain-specific large language models (LLMs) in
fields like law necessitates frameworks that account for nuanced regional legal
distinctions, which are critical for ensuring compliance and trustworthiness.
Existing legal evaluation benchmarks often lack adaptability and fail to
address diverse local contexts, limiting their utility in dynamically evolving
regulatory landscapes. To address these gaps, we propose AutoLaw, a novel
violation detection framework that combines adversarial data generation with a
jury-inspired deliberation process to enhance legal compliance of LLMs. Unlike
static approaches, AutoLaw dynamically synthesizes case law to reflect local
regulations and employs a pool of LLM-based "jurors" to simulate judicial
decision-making. Jurors are ranked and selected based on synthesized legal
expertise, enabling a deliberation process that minimizes bias and improves
detection accuracy. Evaluations across three benchmarks: Law-SG, Case-SG
(legality), and Unfair-TOS (policy), demonstrate AutoLaw's effectiveness:
adversarial data generation improves LLM discrimination, while the jury-based
voting strategy significantly boosts violation detection rates. Our results
highlight the framework's ability to adaptively probe legal misalignments and
deliver reliable, context-aware judgments, offering a scalable solution for
evaluating and enhancing LLMs in legally sensitive applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模多语言数据缺乏对齐性，限制了跨语言语义的捕捉能力，而多向平行数据能提供更强的跨语言一致性。

Method: 利用TED2025语料库（覆盖113种语言，最多50种语言平行对齐），研究了继续预训练、指令调优等策略。

Result: 实验表明，在多语言基准测试中，基于平行数据训练的模型表现优于非对齐数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 多向平行数据能显著提升大语言模型的多语言性能。

Abstract: Continued pretraining and instruction tuning on large-scale multilingual data
have proven to be effective in scaling large language models (LLMs) to
low-resource languages. However, the unaligned nature of such data limits its
ability to effectively capture cross-lingual semantics. In contrast, multi-way
parallel data, where identical content is aligned across multiple languages,
provides stronger cross-lingual consistency and offers greater potential for
improving multilingual performance. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale,
high-quality multi-way parallel corpus, TED2025, based on TED Talks. The corpus
spans 113 languages, with up to 50 languages aligned in parallel, ensuring
extensive multilingual coverage. Using this dataset, we investigate best
practices for leveraging multi-way parallel data to enhance LLMs, including
strategies for continued pretraining, instruction tuning, and the analysis of
key influencing factors. Experiments on six multilingual benchmarks show that
models trained on multiway parallel data consistently outperform those trained
on unaligned multilingual data.

Motivation: 现有剪枝方法常导致性能显著下降或需要大量重新训练和微调，目标是获得更小、更快的知识蒸馏模型。

Method: 提出MAMA Pruning（Movement and Magnitude Analysis），基于预训练阶段的权重和偏置，以及后训练阶段的GRPO奖励验证作为剪枝指标。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不同剪枝水平和下游任务中优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: MAMA Pruning是一种高效的剪枝方法，能在极端剪枝水平下保持模型性能。

Abstract: Model pruning is a performance optimization technique for large language
models like R1 or o3-mini. However, existing pruning methods often lead to
significant performance degradation or require extensive retraining and
fine-tuning. This technique aims to identify and remove neurons, connections
unlikely leading to the contribution during the human-computer interaction
phase. Our goal is to obtain a much smaller and faster knowledge distilled
model that can quickly generate content almost as good as those of the unpruned
ones. We propose MAMA Pruning, short for Movement and Magnitude Analysis, an
improved pruning method that effectively reduces model size and computational
complexity while maintaining performance comparable to the original unpruned
model even at extreme pruned levels. The improved method is based on weights,
bias fixed in the pre-training phase and GRPO rewards verified during the
post-training phase as our novel pruning indicators. Preliminary experimental
results show that our method outperforms and be comparable to state-of-the-art
methods across various pruning levels and different downstream computational
linguistics tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法未充分考虑知识丰富度，导致预训练语料中知识稀缺问题。

Method: 提出梯度无关的高知识评分器（HKS），结合多领域知识元素池和知识密度、覆盖率指标，选择高知识数据。

Result: 实验表明，HKS能提升模型在知识密集和通用理解任务中的表现，增强通用及领域特定能力。

Conclusion: HKS通过知识维度选择高质量数据，有效缓解知识稀缺问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) is intrinsically linked to
the quality of its training data. Although several studies have proposed
methods for high-quality data selection, they do not consider the importance of
knowledge richness in text corpora. In this paper, we propose a novel and
gradient-free High-Knowledge Scorer (HKS) to select high-quality data from the
dimension of knowledge, to alleviate the problem of knowledge scarcity in the
pre-trained corpus. We propose a comprehensive multi-domain knowledge element
pool and introduce knowledge density and coverage as metrics to assess the
knowledge content of the text. Based on this, we propose a comprehensive
knowledge scorer to select data with intensive knowledge, which can also be
utilized for domain-specific high-knowledge data selection by restricting
knowledge elements to the specific domain. We train models on a high-knowledge
bilingual dataset, and experimental results demonstrate that our scorer
improves the model's performance in knowledge-intensive and general
comprehension tasks, and is effective in enhancing both the generic and
domain-specific capabilities of the model.

Motivation: 现有基于前向推理的LLM代理在复杂任务中表现不佳，主要由于初始状态与任务目标之间的感知差距较大。

Result: 实验结果表明，BAR在复杂任务中优于现有方法，验证了所提模块的有效性。

Conclusion: 反向推理是解决复杂任务规划问题的有效方法，BAR代理的设计显著提升了任务完成效果。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based agents have shown great potential in
following human instructions and automatically completing various tasks. To
complete a task, the agent needs to decompose it into easily executed steps by
planning. Existing studies mainly conduct the planning by inferring what steps
should be executed next starting from the agent's initial state. However, this
forward reasoning paradigm doesn't work well for complex tasks. We propose to
study this issue in Minecraft, a virtual environment that simulates complex
tasks based on real-world scenarios. We believe that the failure of forward
reasoning is caused by the big perception gap between the agent's initial state
and task goal. To this end, we leverage backward reasoning and make the
planning starting from the terminal state, which can directly achieve the task
goal in one step. Specifically, we design a BAckward Reasoning based agent
(BAR). It is equipped with a recursive goal decomposition module, a state
consistency maintaining module and a stage memory module to make robust,
consistent, and efficient planning starting from the terminal state.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of BAR over existing methods
and the effectiveness of proposed modules.

TL;DR: 论文探讨语言模型如何编码并延续有害的性别刻板印象，提出需超越表面关联，重新定义性别偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅解决性别关联问题，未能触及性别建构本身的偏见，如将性别与生物性别混淆，可能导致跨性别和性别多样身份的抹除。

Method: 结合性别研究理论，实证测试16种不同架构、训练数据和规模的模型如何编码性别。

Result: 语言模型倾向于将性别编码为与生物性别绑定的二元类别，非二元性别术语被抹除或病理化，且更大模型强化性别与生物性别的关联。

Conclusion: 呼吁重新评估语言模型中性别偏见的定义和解决方法，以更全面地应对性别建构带来的危害。

Abstract: Language models encode and subsequently perpetuate harmful gendered
stereotypes. Research has succeeded in mitigating some of these harms, e.g. by
dissociating non-gendered terms such as occupations from gendered terms such as
'woman' and 'man'. This approach, however, remains superficial given that
associations are only one form of prejudice through which gendered harms arise.
Critical scholarship on gender, such as gender performativity theory,
emphasizes how harms often arise from the construction of gender itself, such
as conflating gender with biological sex. In language models, these issues
could lead to the erasure of transgender and gender diverse identities and
cause harms in downstream applications, from misgendering users to
misdiagnosing patients based on wrong assumptions about their anatomy.
  For FAccT research on gendered harms to go beyond superficial linguistic
associations, we advocate for a broader definition of 'gender bias' in language
models. We operationalize insights on the construction of gender through
language from gender studies literature and then empirically test how 16
language models of different architectures, training datasets, and model sizes
encode gender. We find that language models tend to encode gender as a binary
category tied to biological sex, and that gendered terms that do not neatly
fall into one of these binary categories are erased and pathologized. Finally,
we show that larger models, which achieve better results on performance
benchmarks, learn stronger associations between gender and sex, further
reinforcing a narrow understanding of gender. Our findings lead us to call for
a re-evaluation of how gendered harms in language models are defined and
addressed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM-only方法的知识过时、幻觉和透明度问题，以及链式KG-RAG方法仅适用于简单问题的限制。

Method: 提出PDRR框架，包括预测问题类型、分解问题为三元组、从KB检索信息、指导LLM推理完成三元组。

Result: PDRR在不同LLM骨干上均优于现有方法，尤其在非链式复杂问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: PDRR通过结构化方法有效结合KB和LLM，显著提升KBQA的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural language
questions using structured knowledge from KBs. While LLM-only approaches offer
generalization, they suffer from outdated knowledge, hallucinations, and lack
of transparency. Chain-based KG-RAG methods address these issues by
incorporating external KBs, but are limited to simple chain-structured
questions due to the absence of planning and logical structuring. Inspired by
semantic parsing methods, we propose PDRR: a four-stage framework consisting of
Predict, Decompose, Retrieve, and Reason. Our method first predicts the
question type and decomposes the question into structured triples. Then
retrieves relevant information from KBs and guides the LLM as an agent to
reason over and complete the decomposed triples. Experimental results
demonstrate that PDRR consistently outperforms existing methods across various
LLM backbones and achieves superior performance on both chain-structured and
non-chain complex questions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个基于知识图谱（KG）的多语言、多跳基准测试MultiHal，用于评估生成文本的事实性，并展示了KG在减少大语言模型（LLM）幻觉方面的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事实性评估基准主要依赖英语数据集和补充上下文（如网页链接或文本段落），忽略了结构化的事实资源（如知识图谱）。知识图谱因其结构化表示事实的特性，被认为有助于减少幻觉。

Method: 通过挖掘开放领域知识图谱中的140k条路径，筛选出25.9k条高质量路径，构建了MultiHal基准测试。

Result: 基线评估显示，KG-RAG在语义相似度得分上比普通QA提高了0.12到0.36分，证明了KG整合的潜力。

Conclusion: MultiHal有望推动基于图谱的幻觉减少和事实核查任务的研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have inherent limitations of faithfulness and
factuality, commonly referred to as hallucinations. Several benchmarks have
been developed that provide a test bed for factuality evaluation within the
context of English-centric datasets, while relying on supplementary informative
context like web links or text passages but ignoring the available structured
factual resources. To this end, Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been identified as
a useful aid for hallucination mitigation, as they provide a structured way to
represent the facts about entities and their relations with minimal linguistic
overhead. We bridge the lack of KG paths and multilinguality for factual
language modeling within the existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks and
propose a KG-based multilingual, multihop benchmark called \textbf{MultiHal}
framed for generative text evaluation. As part of our data collection pipeline,
we mined 140k KG-paths from open-domain KGs, from which we pruned noisy
KG-paths, curating a high-quality subset of 25.9k. Our baseline evaluation
shows an absolute scale increase by approximately 0.12 to 0.36 points for the
semantic similarity score in KG-RAG over vanilla QA across multiple languages
and multiple models, demonstrating the potential of KG integration. We
anticipate MultiHal will foster future research towards several graph-based
hallucination mitigation and fact-checking tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算法律研究在应用已有规则方面进展显著，但从司法判决中归纳法律规则的研究不足，缺乏任务定义、基准数据集和方法论。

Method: 提出LRI任务，构建包含5,121个案例集（共38,088个中国案例）的基准数据集，并设计专家标注的测试集。

Result: 实验显示，现有LLMs在LRI任务中表现不佳，但训练后能显著提升对案例间细微规则模式的捕捉能力。

Conclusion: LRI任务的提出和基准数据集的构建为自动化法律规则提取提供了新方向，未来需进一步优化模型推理能力。

Abstract: Legal rules encompass not only codified statutes but also implicit
adjudicatory principles derived from precedents that contain discretionary
norms, social morality, and policy. While computational legal research has
advanced in applying established rules to cases, inducing legal rules from
judicial decisions remains understudied, constrained by limitations in model
inference efficacy and symbolic reasoning capability. The advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs) offers unprecedented opportunities for automating the
extraction of such latent principles, yet progress is stymied by the absence of
formal task definitions, benchmark datasets, and methodologies. To address this
gap, we formalize Legal Rule Induction (LRI) as the task of deriving concise,
generalizable doctrinal rules from sets of analogous precedents, distilling
their shared preconditions, normative behaviors, and legal consequences. We
introduce the first LRI benchmark, comprising 5,121 case sets (38,088 Chinese
cases in total) for model tuning and 216 expert-annotated gold test sets.
Experimental results reveal that: 1) State-of-the-art LLMs struggle with
over-generalization and hallucination; 2) Training on our dataset markedly
enhances LLMs capabilities in capturing nuanced rule patterns across similar
cases.

Abstract: We present PersonaConvBench, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating
personalized reasoning and generation in multi-turn conversations with large
language models (LLMs). Unlike existing work that focuses on either
personalization or conversational structure in isolation, PersonaConvBench
integrates both, offering three core tasks: sentence classification, impact
regression, and user-centric text generation across ten diverse Reddit-based
domains. This design enables systematic analysis of how personalized
conversational context shapes LLM outputs in realistic multi-user scenarios. We
benchmark several commercial and open-source LLMs under a unified prompting
setup and observe that incorporating personalized history yields substantial
performance improvements, including a 198 percent relative gain over the best
non-conversational baseline in sentiment classification. By releasing
PersonaConvBench with evaluations and code, we aim to support research on LLMs
that adapt to individual styles, track long-term context, and produce
contextually rich, engaging responses.

Abstract: The emergence of groundbreaking large language models capable of performing
complex reasoning tasks holds significant promise for addressing various
scientific challenges, including those arising in complex clinical scenarios.
To enable their safe and effective deployment in real-world healthcare
settings, it is urgently necessary to benchmark the diagnostic capabilities of
current models systematically. Given the limitations of existing medical
benchmarks in evaluating advanced diagnostic reasoning, we present
DiagnosisArena, a comprehensive and challenging benchmark designed to
rigorously assess professional-level diagnostic competence. DiagnosisArena
consists of 1,113 pairs of segmented patient cases and corresponding diagnoses,
spanning 28 medical specialties, deriving from clinical case reports published
in 10 top-tier medical journals. The benchmark is developed through a
meticulous construction pipeline, involving multiple rounds of screening and
review by both AI systems and human experts, with thorough checks conducted to
prevent data leakage. Our study reveals that even the most advanced reasoning
models, o3-mini, o1, and DeepSeek-R1, achieve only 45.82%, 31.09%, and 17.79%
accuracy, respectively. This finding highlights a significant generalization
bottleneck in current large language models when faced with clinical diagnostic
reasoning challenges. Through DiagnosisArena, we aim to drive further
advancements in AIs diagnostic reasoning capabilities, enabling more effective
solutions for real-world clinical diagnostic challenges. We provide the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Logit的LLM水印方法在低熵场景下表现不佳，且依赖原始LLM导致高计算成本和潜在模型泄漏风险。

Method: 提出IE方法，使用轻量级特征提取器和熵标记器预测标记熵，并通过阈值导航器动态设置熵阈值，优化水印效果。

Result: 在HumanEval和MBPP数据集上的实验表明，IE减少了99%的参数大小，性能与最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: IE为低熵水印提供了一种安全高效的范式，显著提升了水印的自然性和检测鲁棒性。

Abstract: Logit-based LLM watermarking traces and verifies AI-generated content by
maintaining green and red token lists and increasing the likelihood of green
tokens during generation. However, it fails in low-entropy scenarios, where
predictable outputs make green token selection difficult without disrupting
natural text flow. Existing approaches address this by assuming access to the
original LLM to calculate entropy and selectively watermark high-entropy
tokens. However, these methods face two major challenges: (1) high
computational costs and detection delays due to reliance on the original LLM,
and (2) potential risks of model leakage. To address these limitations, we
propose Invisible Entropy (IE), a watermarking paradigm designed to enhance
both safety and efficiency. Instead of relying on the original LLM, IE
introduces a lightweight feature extractor and an entropy tagger to predict
whether the entropy of the next token is high or low. Furthermore, based on
theoretical analysis, we develop a threshold navigator that adaptively sets
entropy thresholds. It identifies a threshold where the watermark ratio
decreases as the green token count increases, enhancing the naturalness of the
watermarked text and improving detection robustness. Experiments on HumanEval
and MBPP datasets demonstrate that IE reduces parameter size by 99\% while
achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art methods. Our work introduces
a safe and efficient paradigm for low-entropy watermarking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以生成和获取体现人类认知中元推理技能（如反思和分解）的长思维链数据，因此需要一种能够自我合成并迭代改进的模型。

Method: 引入SRLM，利用少量示范样本（1000个）作为推理催化剂，指导模型展开隐藏的推理链，并通过自训练迭代提升性能。

Result: 在五个推理任务（MMLU、GSM8K、ARC-C、HellaSwag和BBH）上平均绝对提升超过2.5分，采样次数增加时提升更显著（如64次采样时平均提升7.89分）。

Conclusion: SRLM不仅提升了初始性能，还能通过自我训练稳定改进，揭示了模型在深度、多样性和创造性推理路径上的潜力。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling has attracted much attention which significantly
enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning
tasks by increasing the length of Chain-of-Thought. These longer intermediate
reasoning rationales embody various meta-reasoning skills in human cognition,
such as reflection and decomposition, being difficult to create and acquire. In
this work, we introduce \textit{Self-Reasoning Language Model} (SRLM), where
the model itself can synthesize longer CoT data and iteratively improve
performance through self-training. By incorporating a few demonstration
examples (i.e., 1,000 samples) on how to unfold hidden reasoning chains from
existing responses, which act as a reasoning catalyst, we demonstrate that SRLM
not only enhances the model's initial performance but also ensures more stable
and consistent improvements in subsequent iterations. Our proposed SRLM
achieves an average absolute improvement of more than $+2.5$ points across five
reasoning tasks: MMLU, GSM8K, ARC-C, HellaSwag, and BBH on two backbone models.
Moreover, it brings more improvements with more times of sampling during
inference, such as absolute $+7.89$ average improvement with $64$ sampling
times, revealing the in-depth, diverse and creative reasoning paths in SRLM
against the strong baseline.

*Filip Miletić,Aaron Schmid,Sabine Schulte im Walde*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了预训练的德语BERT模型对名词复合词语义的编码能力，发现其表现明显落后于英语BERT，可能与德语复合词的高产性和歧义性有关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨德语BERT模型是否能够有效编码名词复合词的语义信息，并与英语BERT的表现进行对比。

Method: 通过调整目标词、层数及模型大小写设置，评估模型对868个标准复合词组合性的预测能力。

Result: 德语BERT的表现明显落后于英语BERT，尤其是在早期层中组合性信息较易提取。

Conclusion: 德语名词复合词的语义编码任务比英语更具挑战性，可能与德语复合词的高产性和歧义性相关。

Abstract: This paper investigates the extent to which pretrained German BERT encodes
knowledge of noun compound semantics. We comprehensively vary combinations of
target tokens, layers, and cased vs. uncased models, and evaluate them by
predicting the compositionality of 868 gold standard compounds. Looking at
representational patterns within the transformer architecture, we observe
trends comparable to equivalent prior work on English, with compositionality
information most easily recoverable in the early layers. However, our strongest
results clearly lag behind those reported for English, suggesting an inherently
more difficult task in German. This may be due to the higher productivity of
compounding in German than in English and the associated increase in
constituent-level ambiguity, including in our target compound set.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过控制实验比较了表格问答任务中文本和图像输入的效果，提出动态选择表示方法FRES，性能提升10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对表格表示（文本或图像）与模型组合效果的细粒度分析，需在控制条件下比较。

Method: 构建新基准，系统分析七对MLLM和LLM组合，提出动态选择表示方法FRES。

Result: 不同组合在不同场景下表现各异，FRES方法平均性能提升10%。

Conclusion: 表格表示与模型的最佳组合因场景而异，动态选择方法FRES显著提升性能。

Abstract: In table question answering (TQA), tables are encoded as either texts or
images. Prior work suggests that passing images of tables to multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) performs comparably to or even better than using
textual input with large language models (LLMs). However, the lack of
controlled setups limits fine-grained distinctions between these approaches. In
this paper, we conduct the first controlled study on the effectiveness of
several combinations of table representations and models from two perspectives:
question complexity and table size. We build a new benchmark based on existing
TQA datasets. In a systematic analysis of seven pairs of MLLMs and LLMs, we
find that the best combination of table representation and model varies across
setups. We propose FRES, a method selecting table representations dynamically,
and observe a 10% average performance improvement compared to using both
representations indiscriminately.

*Chengzhi Zhang,Xinyi Yan,Lei Zhao,Yingyi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用学术文章的结构特征和章节文本改进关键词提取（KPE）性能的方法，通过整合章节提取结果和结构特征，显著提升了KPE效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术论文数量的激增使得研究者难以高效获取相关文献，而现有基于标题和摘要的KPE方法因摘要长度限制语义丰富性，全文KPE则引入噪声。因此，论文旨在利用文章结构信息优化KPE。

Method: 研究分为两部分：(1) 分析七种结构特征对KPE模型的影响；(2) 通过关键词整合算法整合各章节文本的提取结果。同时，还研究了章节结构分类质量对KPE性能的影响。

Result: 结果表明，结构特征的引入提升了KPE性能，但不同特征效果各异。关键词整合方法表现最佳，章节结构分类质量也会影响KPE效果。

Conclusion: 利用学术文章的结构信息能有效提升KPE性能，为相关研究提供了新思路。代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: The exponential increase in academic papers has significantly increased the
time required for researchers to access relevant literature. Keyphrase
Extraction (KPE) offers a solution to this situation by enabling researchers to
efficiently retrieve relevant literature. The current study on KPE from
academic articles aims to improve the performance of extraction models through
innovative approaches using Title and Abstract as input corpora. However, the
semantic richness of keywords is significantly constrained by the length of the
abstract. While full-text-based KPE can address this issue, it simultaneously
introduces noise, which significantly diminishes KPE performance. To address
this issue, this paper utilized the structural features and section texts
obtained from the section structure information of academic articles to extract
keyphrase from academic papers. The approach consists of two main parts: (1)
exploring the effect of seven structural features on KPE models, and (2)
integrating the extraction results from all section texts used as input corpora
for KPE models via a keyphrase integration algorithm to obtain the keyphrase
integration result. Furthermore, this paper also examined the effect of the
classification quality of section structure on the KPE performance. The results
show that incorporating structural features improves KPE performance, though
different features have varying effects on model efficacy. The keyphrase
integration approach yields the best performance, and the classification
quality of section structure can affect KPE performance. These findings
indicate that using the section structure information of academic articles
contributes to effective KPE from academic articles. The code and dataset
supporting this study are available at https://github.com/yan-xinyi/SSB_KPE.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了在强化微调（RFT）中先验提示工程（pPE）的作用，发现不同pPE方法能引导语言模型（LM）内化不同行为，且pPE训练的模型表现优于推理时提示工程（iPE）的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RFT研究主要关注算法、奖励塑造和数据整理，而先验提示设计（即训练时预置的指令）尚未充分探索。本文旨在探讨不同pPE方法是否能引导LM在RFT后内化不同行为。

Method: 受推理时提示工程（iPE）启发，将五种代表性iPE策略（如逐步推理、规划、代码推理等）转化为pPE方法，并在Qwen2.5-7B模型上进行实验。

Result: 所有pPE训练的模型均优于iPE提示的模型，其中“空示例”pPE方法表现最佳，尤其在AIME2024和GPQA-Diamond上提升显著。

Conclusion: pPE是RFT中强大但未被充分研究的维度，不同pPE策略能塑造模型的不同行为风格。

Abstract: This paper investigates prior prompt engineering (pPE) in the context of
reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), where language models (LMs) are incentivized
to exhibit behaviors that maximize performance through reward signals. While
existing RFT research has primarily focused on algorithms, reward shaping, and
data curation, the design of the prior prompt--the instructions prepended to
queries during training to elicit behaviors such as step-by-step
reasoning--remains underexplored. We investigate whether different pPE
approaches can guide LMs to internalize distinct behaviors after RFT. Inspired
by inference-time prompt engineering (iPE), we translate five representative
iPE strategies--reasoning, planning, code-based reasoning, knowledge recall,
and null-example utilization--into corresponding pPE approaches. We experiment
with Qwen2.5-7B using each of the pPE approaches, then evaluate performance on
in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks (e.g., AIME2024, HumanEval+, and
GPQA-Diamond). Our results show that all pPE-trained models surpass their
iPE-prompted counterparts, with the null-example pPE approach achieving the
largest average performance gain and the highest improvement on AIME2024 and
GPQA-Diamond, surpassing the commonly used reasoning approach. Furthermore, by
adapting a behavior-classification framework, we demonstrate that different pPE
strategies instill distinct behavioral styles in the resulting models. These
findings position pPE as a powerful yet understudied axis for RFT.

TL;DR: 通过激活工程技术，无需训练或数据集创建，提升LLMs在特定时间点的事实回忆能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保LLMs生成与时间背景相符的准确回答，以维持其相关性和准确性。

Method: 采用激活工程技术，将三个版本的LLaMA 2模型锚定到特定时间点，并研究不同注入层和提示策略的效果。

Result: 相对提示和显式提示分别提高了44%和16%，性能与Zhao等人（2024）的微调方法相当，但计算效率更高且无需预对齐数据集。

Conclusion: 激活工程技术是一种高效且无需额外数据的方法，可显著提升LLMs的时间对齐能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on diverse and often conflicting
knowledge spanning multiple domains and time periods. Some of this knowledge is
only valid within specific temporal contexts, such as answering the question,
"Who is the President of the United States in 2022?" Ensuring LLMs generate
time appropriate responses is crucial for maintaining relevance and accuracy.
In this work we explore activation engineering as a method for temporally
aligning LLMs to improve factual recall without any training or dataset
creation. In this research we explore an activation engineering technique to
ground three versions of LLaMA 2 to specific points in time and examine the
effects of varying injection layers and prompting strategies. Our experiments
demonstrate up to a 44% and 16% improvement in relative and explicit prompting
respectively, achieving comparable performance to the fine-tuning method
proposed by Zhao et al. (2024) . Notably, our approach achieves similar results
to the fine-tuning baseline while being significantly more computationally
efficient and requiring no pre-aligned datasets.

TL;DR: 多语言视觉语言模型在图像-文本检索中存在社会偏见，研究发现多语言性并未减轻偏见，反而在某些情况下加剧了偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨多语言视觉语言模型的社会偏见，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 对三种多语言CLIP模型（M-CLIP、NLLB-CLIP和CAPIVARA-CLIP）在十种语言中进行系统性审计，使用平衡数据集量化种族和性别偏见。

Result: 所有模型在多语言环境下表现出比单语言基线更强的性别偏见，低资源语言和性别中性语言尤其受影响。

Conclusion: 多语言模型需要更细粒度、语言感知的偏见评估方法，以避免偏见传播和放大。

Abstract: Multilingual vision-language models promise universal image-text retrieval,
yet their social biases remain under-explored. We present the first systematic
audit of three public multilingual CLIP checkpoints -- M-CLIP, NLLB-CLIP, and
CAPIVARA-CLIP -- across ten languages that vary in resource availability and
grammatical gender. Using balanced subsets of \textsc{FairFace} and the
\textsc{PATA} stereotype suite in a zero-shot setting, we quantify race and
gender bias and measure stereotype amplification. Contrary to the assumption
that multilinguality mitigates bias, every model exhibits stronger gender bias
than its English-only baseline. CAPIVARA-CLIP shows its largest biases
precisely in the low-resource languages it targets, while the shared
cross-lingual encoder of NLLB-CLIP transports English gender stereotypes into
gender-neutral languages; loosely coupled encoders largely avoid this transfer.
Highly gendered languages consistently magnify all measured bias types, but
even gender-neutral languages remain vulnerable when cross-lingual weight
sharing imports foreign stereotypes. Aggregated metrics conceal
language-specific ``hot spots,'' underscoring the need for fine-grained,
language-aware bias evaluation in future multilingual vision-language research.

TL;DR: PL-FGSA是一个基于提示学习的统一框架，用于细粒度情感分析，通过多任务提示增强生成问题，结合了方面提取、情感分类和因果解释，显著提升了性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统细粒度情感分析方法需要特定架构和大量标注数据，泛化性和扩展性受限。

Method: 提出PL-FGSA框架，结合提示设计和轻量级TextCNN主干，将FGSA重新定义为多任务提示增强生成问题。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，F1分数分别为0.922、0.694和0.597，优于传统微调方法。

Conclusion: PL-FGSA通过提示学习实现了高效泛化，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FGSA) aims to identify sentiment polarity
toward specific aspects within a text, enabling more precise opinion mining in
domains such as product reviews and social media. However, traditional FGSA
approaches often require task-specific architectures and extensive annotated
data, limiting their generalization and scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose PL-FGSA, a unified prompt learning-based framework
implemented using the MindSpore platform, which integrates prompt design with a
lightweight TextCNN backbone. Our method reformulates FGSA as a multi-task
prompt-augmented generation problem, jointly tackling aspect extraction,
sentiment classification, and causal explanation in a unified paradigm. By
leveraging prompt-based guidance, PL-FGSA enhances interpretability and
achieves strong performance under both full-data and low-resource conditions.
Experiments on three benchmark datasets-SST-2, SemEval-2014 Task 4, and
MAMS-demonstrate that our model consistently outperforms traditional
fine-tuning methods and achieves F1-scores of 0.922, 0.694, and 0.597,
respectively. These results validate the effectiveness of prompt-based
generalization and highlight the practical value of PL-FGSA for real-world
sentiment analysis tasks.

Motivation: LLMs在字符级任务上的失败暴露了分词的根本限制，需解决其低互信息问题。

Method: 使用19项合成任务研究字符级推理，提出基于渗透的概念涌现模型，并设计轻量级架构改进。

Result: 字符级能力在训练后期突然出现，改进架构显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究填补了分词模型的感知空白，为理解和改进其结构性盲点提供了框架。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable progress across diverse domains, Large Language
Models (LLMs) consistently fail at simple character-level tasks, such as
counting letters in words, due to a fundamental limitation: tokenization. In
this work, we frame this limitation as a problem of low mutual information and
analyze it in terms of concept emergence. Using a suite of 19 synthetic tasks
that isolate character-level reasoning in a controlled setting, we show that
such capabilities emerge slowly, suddenly, and only late in training. We
further show that percolation-based models of concept emergence explain these
patterns, suggesting that learning character composition is not fundamentally
different from learning commonsense knowledge. To address this bottleneck, we
propose a lightweight architectural modification that significantly improves
character-level reasoning while preserving the inductive advantages of subword
models. Together, our results bridge low-level perceptual gaps in tokenized LMs
and provide a principled framework for understanding and mitigating their
structural blind spots. We make our code publicly available.

TL;DR: THOR-MoE通过分层任务引导和上下文感知路由策略改进稀疏混合专家（MoE）模型，解决了现有方法中任务知识直接使用和局部路由的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE方法在神经机器翻译（NMT）中直接使用任务知识且仅依赖局部表征，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出THOR-MoE，分层预测域/语言标签并提取混合表征，同时注入上下文信息优化路由。

Result: 在多域和多语言翻译任务中表现优异，兼容现有路由方案，BLEU提升0.75且激活参数减少22%。

Conclusion: THOR-MoE作为一种即插即用模块，显著提升MoE性能并具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: The sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has achieved significant progress for
neural machine translation (NMT). However, there exist two limitations in
current MoE solutions which may lead to sub-optimal performance: 1) they
directly use the task knowledge of NMT into MoE (\emph{e.g.},
domain/linguistics-specific knowledge), which are generally unavailable at
practical application and neglect the naturally grouped domain/linguistic
properties; 2) the expert selection only depends on the localized token
representation without considering the context, which fully grasps the state of
each token in a global view. To address the above limitations, we propose
THOR-MoE via arming the MoE with hierarchical task-guided and
context-responsive routing policies. Specifically, it 1) firstly predicts the
domain/language label and then extracts mixed domain/language representation to
allocate task-level experts in a hierarchical manner; 2) injects the context
information to enhance the token routing from the pre-selected task-level
experts set, which can help each token to be accurately routed to more
specialized and suitable experts. Extensive experiments on multi-domain
translation and multilingual translation benchmarks with different
architectures consistently demonstrate the superior performance of THOR-MoE.
Additionally, the THOR-MoE operates as a plug-and-play module compatible with
existing Top-$k$~\cite{shazeer2017} and Top-$p$~\cite{huang-etal-2024-harder}
routing schemes, ensuring broad applicability across diverse MoE architectures.
For instance, compared with vanilla Top-$p$~\cite{huang-etal-2024-harder}
routing, the context-aware manner can achieve an average improvement of 0.75
BLEU with less than 22\% activated parameters on multi-domain translation
tasks.

TL;DR: N-rep一致性是一种低成本高效的文本到SQL方法，性能接近昂贵方法，但成本仅为每次查询0.039美元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM方法（如CoT、自一致性和微调）成本高昂，每次查询可达0.46美元，微调模型更是花费数千美元，需更经济的替代方案。

Method: N-rep通过同一模式输入的多种表示来弥补单一表示的不足，无需推理或微调，使用更小更便宜的模型。

Result: N-rep在BIRD基准测试中表现与昂贵方法相当，每次查询成本仅0.039美元。

Conclusion: N-rep是当前成本范围内性能最佳的文本到SQL方法。

Abstract: LLMs are effective at code generation tasks like text-to-SQL, but is it worth
the cost? Many state-of-the-art approaches use non-task-specific LLM techniques
including Chain-of-Thought (CoT), self-consistency, and fine-tuning. These
methods can be costly at inference time, sometimes requiring over a hundred LLM
calls with reasoning, incurring average costs of up to \$0.46 per query, while
fine-tuning models can cost thousands of dollars. We introduce "N-rep"
consistency, a more cost-efficient text-to-SQL approach that achieves similar
BIRD benchmark scores as other more expensive methods, at only \$0.039 per
query. N-rep leverages multiple representations of the same schema input to
mitigate weaknesses in any single representation, making the solution more
robust and allowing the use of smaller and cheaper models without any reasoning
or fine-tuning. To our knowledge, N-rep is the best-performing text-to-SQL
approach in its cost range.

Motivation: 揭示分词方案（如BPE）如何阻碍符号计算，影响语言模型的推理能力。

Method: 通过理论和实证研究，分析分词结构对算术和符号任务的影响，并引入原子对齐格式。

Result: 分词结构显著影响推理性能，原子对齐格式能提升小模型的推理能力，甚至超越大模型。

Conclusion: 符号推理能力不仅依赖模型架构，还受分词表示的影响。

Abstract: Tokenization is the first - and often underappreciated - layer of computation
in language models. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enables transformer
models to approximate recurrent computation by externalizing intermediate
steps, we show that the success of such reasoning is fundamentally bounded by
the structure of tokenized inputs. This work presents a theoretical and
empirical investigation into how tokenization schemes, particularly
subword-based methods like byte-pair encoding (BPE), impede symbolic
computation by merging or obscuring atomic reasoning units. We introduce the
notion of Token Awareness to formalize how poor token granularity disrupts
logical alignment and prevents models from generalizing symbolic procedures.
Through systematic evaluation on arithmetic and symbolic tasks, we demonstrate
that token structure dramatically affect reasoning performance, causing failure
even with CoT, while atomically-aligned formats unlock strong generalization,
allowing small models (e.g., GPT-4o-mini) to outperform larger systems (e.g.,
o1) in structured reasoning. Our findings reveal that symbolic reasoning
ability in LLMs is not purely architectural, but deeply conditioned on
token-level representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有摘要生成方法未能充分捕捉科学论文的结构化信息，且依赖关键词映射或特征工程，缺乏跨学科的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过标准化章节标题构建数据集并训练分类器识别结构功能；第二阶段使用Longformer生成上下文感知的摘要。

Result: 在两个领域特定的数据集上，该方法优于先进基线，生成更全面的摘要。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了结构化信息捕捉和跨学科鲁棒性问题，提升了摘要生成的质量。

Abstract: Abstractive summarization of scientific papers has always been a research
focus, yet existing methods face two main challenges. First, most summarization
models rely on Encoder-Decoder architectures that treat papers as sequences of
words, thus fail to fully capture the structured information inherent in
scientific papers. Second, existing research often use keyword mapping or
feature engineering to identify the structural information, but these methods
struggle with the structural flexibility of scientific papers and lack
robustness across different disciplines. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stage abstractive summarization framework that leverages
automatic recognition of structural functions within scientific papers. In the
first stage, we standardize chapter titles from numerous scientific papers and
construct a large-scale dataset for structural function recognition. A
classifier is then trained to automatically identify the key structural
components (e.g., Background, Methods, Results, Discussion), which provides a
foundation for generating more balanced summaries. In the second stage, we
employ Longformer to capture rich contextual relationships across sections and
generating context-aware summaries. Experiments conducted on two
domain-specific scientific paper summarization datasets demonstrate that our
method outperforms advanced baselines, and generates more comprehensive
summaries. The code and dataset can be accessed at

Result: SlangOWL在LLMs上表现优于基线模型和未经过思考的微调模型。

Conclusion: SlangDIT任务和SlangOWL模型有效提升了俚语翻译的准确性。

Abstract: The challenge of slang translation lies in capturing context-dependent
semantic extensions, as slang terms often convey meanings beyond their literal
interpretation. While slang detection, explanation, and translation have been
studied as isolated tasks in the era of large language models (LLMs), their
intrinsic interdependence remains underexplored. The main reason is lacking of
a benchmark where the two tasks can be a prerequisite for the third one, which
can facilitate idiomatic translation. In this paper, we introduce the
interpretative slang translation task (named SlangDIT) consisting of three
sub-tasks: slang detection, cross-lingual slang explanation, and slang
translation within the current context, aiming to generate more accurate
translation with the help of slang detection and slang explanation. To this
end, we construct a SlangDIT dataset, containing over 25k English-Chinese
sentence pairs. Each source sentence mentions at least one slang term and is
labeled with corresponding cross-lingual slang explanation. Based on the
benchmark, we propose a deep thinking model, named SlangOWL. It firstly
identifies whether the sentence contains a slang, and then judges whether the
slang is polysemous and analyze its possible meaning. Further, the SlangOWL
provides the best explanation of the slang term targeting on the current
context. Finally, according to the whole thought, the SlangOWL offers a
suitable translation. Our experiments on LLMs (\emph{e.g.}, Qwen2.5 and
LLama-3.1), show that our deep thinking approach indeed enhances the
performance of LLMs where the proposed SLangOWL significantly surpasses the
vanilla models and supervised fine-tuned models without thinking.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型（LRMs）在复杂任务中表现优异，但在简单任务上会过度推理，导致不必要的计算开销。

Method: 提出ThinkSwitcher框架，通过轻量级切换模块动态选择长短链推理模式，基于任务复杂度。

Result: 实验表明，ThinkSwitcher在多个推理基准上减少计算成本20-30%，且不影响复杂任务的准确性。

Conclusion: ThinkSwitcher是一种可扩展且高效的统一LRM部署解决方案。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at solving complex tasks by leveraging
long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this often leads to
overthinking on simple tasks, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead.
We observe that LRMs inherently possess the capability for efficient short CoT
reasoning, which can be reliably elicited through prompt design. To leverage
this capability, we propose ThinkSwitcher, a framework that enables a single
LRM to dynamically switch between short and long CoT modes based on task
complexity. ThinkSwitcher introduces a lightweight switching module trained
with supervision signals derived from the relative performance of each
reasoning mode across tasks. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks show
that ThinkSwitcher reduces computational cost by 20-30% while maintaining high
accuracy on complex tasks. This demonstrates the effectiveness of ThinkSwitcher
as a scalable and efficient solution for unified LRM deployment.

Motivation: LLMs可能无意中泄露用户信息或作者身份线索，引发隐私问题。AO、AM和AV的研究独立进行，但它们的相互作用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出统一框架，量化AO、AM和AV的互动关系，分析其对人类撰写文本的影响，并研究人口统计元数据的调节作用。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了LLMs时代作者隐私研究的空白，为理解AO、AM和AV的相互作用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been fueled by large
scale training corpora drawn from diverse sources such as websites, news
articles, and books. These datasets often contain explicit user information,
such as person names and addresses, that LLMs may unintentionally reproduce in
their generated outputs. Beyond such explicit content, LLMs can also leak
identity revealing cues through implicit signals such as distinctive writing
styles, raising significant concerns about authorship privacy. There are three
major automated tasks in authorship privacy, namely authorship obfuscation
(AO), authorship mimicking (AM), and authorship verification (AV). Prior
research has studied AO, AM, and AV independently. However, their interplays
remain under explored, which leaves a major research gap, especially in the era
of LLMs, where they are profoundly shaping how we curate and share user
generated content, and the distinction between machine generated and human
authored text is also increasingly blurred. This work then presents the first
unified framework for analyzing the dynamic relationships among LLM enabled AO,
AM, and AV in the context of authorship privacy. We quantify how they interact
with each other to transform human authored text, examining effects at a single
point in time and iteratively over time. We also examine the role of
demographic metadata, such as gender, academic background, in modulating their
performances, inter-task dynamics, and privacy risks. All source code will be
publicly available.

*Sizhe Yuen,Ting Su,Ziyang Wang,Yali Du,Adam J. Sobey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过自动生成基于上下文的QA对来增强大型语言模型在知识密集型QA任务中的方法，减少了人工标注依赖并提升了模型的理解与推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前QA系统在处理复杂推理或实时知识整合时表现不佳，检索增强生成（RAG）方法仍面临多源信息逻辑连接的挑战。

Method: 利用LLMs自动生成QA对作为微调数据，结合自动化QA生成器和模型微调器，通过困惑度、ROUGE、BLEU和BERTScore进行评估。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在逻辑一致性和事实准确性上有所提升，Mistral-7b-v0.3在BERT F1、BLEU和ROUGE分数上优于Llama-3-8b。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发适应性强的AI系统提供了潜力，展示了自动生成QA对在提升模型性能上的有效性。

Abstract: A question-answering (QA) system is to search suitable answers within a
knowledge base. Current QA systems struggle with queries requiring complex
reasoning or real-time knowledge integration. They are often supplemented with
retrieval techniques on a data source such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG). However, RAG continues to face challenges in handling complex reasoning
and logical connections between multiple sources of information. A novel
approach for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive QA
tasks is presented through the automated generation of context-based QA pairs.
This methodology leverages LLMs to create fine-tuning data, reducing reliance
on human labelling and improving model comprehension and reasoning
capabilities. The proposed system includes an automated QA generator and a
model fine-tuner, evaluated using perplexity, ROUGE, BLEU, and BERTScore.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate improvements in logical coherence and
factual accuracy, with implications for developing adaptable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) systems. Mistral-7b-v0.3 outperforms Llama-3-8b with BERT F1,
BLEU, and ROUGE scores 0.858, 0.172, and 0.260 of for the LLM generated QA
pairs compared to scores of 0.836, 0.083, and 0.139 for the human annotated QA
pairs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种利用代码混合和语音扰动的新型策略，成功绕过大型语言模型的安全过滤器，并在文本和图像生成任务中实现了高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红队测试主要针对英语，且使用固定模板攻击，导致模型在多语言和多模态环境下仍易受攻击。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过代码混合和语音扰动生成提示词，并结合两种新策略攻击模型。

Result: 文本生成攻击成功率达99%，图像生成达78%，攻击相关率分别为100%和95%。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁加强多语言多模态模型的通用安全对齐，尤其是在现实场景中提示词可能存在拼写错误的情况下。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful, with
multilingual and multimodal capabilities improving by the day. These models are
being evaluated through audits, alignment studies and red-teaming efforts to
expose model vulnerabilities towards generating harmful, biased and unfair
content. Existing red-teaming efforts have previously focused on the English
language, using fixed template-based attacks; thus, models continue to be
susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially in the
multimodal context. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages
code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and
image generation tasks. We also introduce two new jailbreak strategies that
show higher effectiveness than baseline strategies. Our work presents a method
to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability
by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. Our
novel prompts achieve a 99% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78% for
image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100% for text generation and
95% for image generation when using the phonetically perturbed code-mixed
prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations
impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates
increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for
multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein
prompts can have misspelt words.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在上下文学习中因端到端微调而带来的高计算成本问题。

Method: 利用注意力机制的内在机制，通过调整注意力分数来优化模型行为，减少对错误标签的关注。

Result: 在9种现代语言模型和8个数据集上，ABFT在性能、鲁棒性、无偏性和效率上均优于现有方法，且数据成本仅为0.01%。

Conclusion: ABFT展示了通过控制语言模型内部模块来改善行为的可能性，为未来机制解释性应用开辟了道路。

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) utilizes structured demonstration-query inputs to
induce few-shot learning on Language Models (LMs), which are not originally
pre-trained on ICL-style data. To bridge the gap between ICL and pre-training,
some approaches fine-tune LMs on large ICL-style datasets by an end-to-end
paradigm with massive computational costs. To reduce such costs, in this paper,
we propose Attention Behavior Fine-Tuning (ABFT), utilizing the previous
findings on the inner mechanism of ICL, building training objectives on the
attention scores instead of the final outputs, to force the attention scores to
focus on the correct label tokens presented in the context and mitigate
attention scores from the wrong label tokens. Our experiments on 9 modern LMs
and 8 datasets empirically find that ABFT outperforms in performance,
robustness, unbiasedness, and efficiency, with only around 0.01% data cost
compared to the previous methods. Moreover, our subsequent analysis finds that
the end-to-end training objective contains the ABFT objective, suggesting the
implicit bias of ICL-style data to the emergence of induction heads. Our work
demonstrates the possibility of controlling specific module sequences within
LMs to improve their behavior, opening up the future application of mechanistic
interpretability.

TL;DR: ABBA是一种新的参数高效微调（PEFT）架构，通过解耦预训练权重和更新矩阵，显著提升了表达能力，并在多个任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在新领域的适应效率是一个关键挑战，现有方法如LoRA和HiRA的表达能力受限。

Method: ABBA通过将更新矩阵重新参数化为两个独立可学习的低秩矩阵的Hadamard积，完全解耦预训练权重。

Result: ABBA在矩阵重构实验中表现出更高的表达能力，并在算术和常识推理任务中显著优于现有PEFT方法。

Conclusion: ABBA提供了一种更高效的PEFT方法，为模型适应新领域提供了更强的灵活性。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide
range of tasks, but adapting them efficiently to new domains remains a key
challenge. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by
introducing lightweight, trainable modules while keeping most pre-trained
weights fixed. The prevailing approach, LoRA, models updates using a low-rank
decomposition, but its expressivity is inherently constrained by the rank.
Recent methods like HiRA aim to increase expressivity by incorporating a
Hadamard product with the frozen weights, but still rely on the structure of
the pre-trained model. We introduce ABBA, a new PEFT architecture that
reparameterizes the update as a Hadamard product of two independently learnable
low-rank matrices. In contrast to prior work, ABBA fully decouples the update
from the pre-trained weights, enabling both components to be optimized freely.
This leads to significantly higher expressivity under the same parameter
budget. We formally analyze ABBA's expressive capacity and validate its
advantages through matrix reconstruction experiments. Empirically, ABBA
achieves state-of-the-art results on arithmetic and commonsense reasoning
benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing PEFT methods by a significant
margin across multiple models. Our code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 自动化文献综述在言语病理学领域的需求，以提高分类效率和准确性。

Method: 从PubMed数据库中检索并过滤4,804篇相关文献，使用LDA和BERTopic进行主题建模，并结合自定义停用词列表优化结果。

Result: LDA模型的连贯性得分为0.42，困惑度为-7.5；BERTopic模型的异常主题比例低于20%，表明其分类效果良好。

Conclusion: 该方法为言语病理学领域的自动化文献综述提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This technical report presents a natural language processing (NLP)-based
approach for systematically classifying scientific literature on childhood
speech disorders. We retrieved and filtered 4,804 relevant articles published
after 2015 from the PubMed database using domain-specific keywords. After
cleaning and pre-processing the abstracts, we applied two topic modeling
techniques - Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic - to identify
latent thematic structures in the corpus. Our models uncovered 14 clinically
meaningful clusters, such as infantile hyperactivity and abnormal epileptic
behavior. To improve relevance and precision, we incorporated a custom stop
word list tailored to speech pathology. Evaluation results showed that the LDA
model achieved a coherence score of 0.42 and a perplexity of -7.5, indicating
strong topic coherence and predictive performance. The BERTopic model exhibited
a low proportion of outlier topics (less than 20%), demonstrating its capacity
to classify heterogeneous literature effectively. These results provide a
foundation for automating literature reviews in speech-language pathology.

Conclusion: 该研究通过TransBench填补了工业机器翻译评估的空白，为研究者和从业者提供了系统化评估和改进翻译质量的工具。

Abstract: Machine translation (MT) has become indispensable for cross-border
communication in globalized industries like e-commerce, finance, and legal
services, with recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)
significantly enhancing translation quality. However, applying general-purpose
MT models to industrial scenarios reveals critical limitations due to
domain-specific terminology, cultural nuances, and stylistic conventions absent
in generic benchmarks. Existing evaluation frameworks inadequately assess
performance in specialized contexts, creating a gap between academic benchmarks
and real-world efficacy. To address this, we propose a three-level translation
capability framework: (1) Basic Linguistic Competence, (2) Domain-Specific
Proficiency, and (3) Cultural Adaptation, emphasizing the need for holistic
evaluation across these dimensions. We introduce TransBench, a benchmark
tailored for industrial MT, initially targeting international e-commerce with
17,000 professionally translated sentences spanning 4 main scenarios and 33
language pairs. TransBench integrates traditional metrics (BLEU, TER) with
Marco-MOS, a domain-specific evaluation model, and provides guidelines for
reproducible benchmark construction. Our contributions include: (1) a
structured framework for industrial MT evaluation, (2) the first publicly
available benchmark for e-commerce translation, (3) novel metrics probing
multi-level translation quality, and (4) open-sourced evaluation tools. This
work bridges the evaluation gap, enabling researchers and practitioners to
systematically assess and enhance MT systems for industry-specific needs.

Result: FuxiMT在65种语言上显著优于基线模型，尤其在低资源场景和零样本翻译中表现优异。

Conclusion: FuxiMT在多语言翻译任务中具有潜力，尤其是在资源稀缺或未见语言对的情况下。

Abstract: In this paper, we present FuxiMT, a novel Chinese-centric multilingual

We adopt a two-stage strategy to train FuxiMT. We first pre-train the model on
a massive Chinese corpus and then conduct multilingual fine-tuning on a large
parallel dataset encompassing 65 languages. FuxiMT incorporates
Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs) and employs a curriculum learning strategy for robust
performance across various resource levels. Experimental results demonstrate
that FuxiMT significantly outperforms strong baselines, including
state-of-the-art LLMs and machine translation models, particularly under
low-resource scenarios. Furthermore, FuxiMT exhibits remarkable zero-shot
translation capabilities for unseen language pairs, indicating its potential to
bridge communication gaps where parallel data are scarce or unavailable.

Result: Think-J显著提升生成型LLM的评判能力，优于生成型和分类器型LLM-Judge，且无需额外人工标注。

Conclusion: Think-J通过强化学习优化评判思维，为LLM评估提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge refers to the automatic modeling of preferences for responses
generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which is of significant importance
for both LLM evaluation and reward modeling. Although generative LLMs have made
substantial progress in various tasks, their performance as LLM-Judge still
falls short of expectations. In this work, we propose Think-J, which improves
generative LLM-as-a-Judge by learning how to think. We first utilized a small
amount of curated data to develop the model with initial judgment thinking
capabilities. Subsequently, we optimize the judgment thinking traces based on
reinforcement learning (RL). We propose two methods for judgment thinking
optimization, based on offline and online RL, respectively. The offline RL
requires training a critic model to construct positive and negative examples
for learning. The online method defines rule-based reward as feedback for
optimization. Experimental results showed that our approach can significantly
enhance the evaluation capability of generative LLM-Judge, surpassing both
generative and classifier-based LLM-Judge without requiring extra human
annotations.

Conclusion: FAID为AI辅助写作的透明性和责任性提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: The growing collaboration between humans and AI models in generative tasks
has introduced new challenges in distinguishing between human-written,
AI-generated, and human-AI collaborative texts. In this work, we collect a
multilingual, multi-domain, multi-generator dataset FAIDSet. We further
introduce a fine-grained detection framework FAID to classify text into these
three categories, meanwhile identifying the underlying AI model family. Unlike
existing binary classifiers, FAID is built to capture both authorship and
model-specific characteristics. Our method combines multi-level contrastive
learning with multi-task auxiliary classification to learn subtle stylistic
cues. By modeling AI families as distinct stylistic entities, FAID offers
improved interpretability. We incorporate an adaptation to address
distributional shifts without retraining for unseen data. Experimental results
demonstrate that FAID outperforms several baseline approaches, particularly
enhancing the generalization accuracy on unseen domains and new AI models. It
provide a potential solution for improving transparency and accountability in
AI-assisted writing.

Abstract: Considering the importance of detecting hateful language, labeled hate speech
data is expensive and time-consuming to collect, particularly for low-resource
languages. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of cross-lingual
transfer learning and data augmentation in improving performance on tasks with
limited labeled data. To develop an efficient and scalable cross-lingual
transfer learning approach, we leverage nearest-neighbor retrieval to augment
minimal labeled data in the target language, thereby enhancing detection
performance. Specifically, we assume access to a small set of labeled training
instances in the target language and use these to retrieve the most relevant
labeled examples from a large multilingual hate speech detection pool. We
evaluate our approach on eight languages and demonstrate that it consistently
outperforms models trained solely on the target language data. Furthermore, in
most cases, our method surpasses the current state-of-the-art. Notably, our
approach is highly data-efficient, retrieving as small as 200 instances in some
cases while maintaining superior performance. Moreover, it is scalable, as the
retrieval pool can be easily expanded, and the method can be readily adapted to
new languages and tasks. We also apply maximum marginal relevance to mitigate
redundancy and filter out highly similar retrieved instances, resulting in
improvements in some languages.

Motivation: 研究语音LLMs的通用对抗攻击漏洞，因其灵活性可能增加被攻击风险。

Method: 在原始音频前添加固定对抗音频段，研究攻击导致无输出或任务修改，并扩展为选择性攻击。

Result: 发现Qwen2-Audio和Granite-Speech存在关键漏洞，类似模型可能易受攻击。

Conclusion: 需增强训练策略和对抗攻击抵抗力。

Abstract: The combination of pre-trained speech encoders with large language models has
enabled the development of speech LLMs that can handle a wide range of spoken
language processing tasks. While these models are powerful and flexible, this
very flexibility may make them more vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To
examine the extent of this problem, in this work we investigate universal
acoustic adversarial attacks on speech LLMs. Here a fixed, universal,
adversarial audio segment is prepended to the original input audio. We
initially investigate attacks that cause the model to either produce no output
or to perform a modified task overriding the original prompt. We then extend
the nature of the attack to be selective so that it activates only when
specific input attributes, such as a speaker gender or spoken language, are
present. Inputs without the targeted attribute should be unaffected, allowing
fine-grained control over the model outputs. Our findings reveal critical
vulnerabilities in Qwen2-Audio and Granite-Speech and suggest that similar
speech LLMs may be susceptible to universal adversarial attacks. This
highlights the need for more robust training strategies and improved resistance
to adversarial attacks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型迁移方法（如SFT）过于依赖英语性能，在数据受限环境下表现不佳。因此，需要一种更高效的方法来平衡目标语言学习和英语能力保持。

Method: 提出跨语言优化（CLO），利用英语SFT数据和翻译模型实现跨语言迁移。实验覆盖五种模型和六种语言，资源水平各异。

Result: CLO在目标语言学习和英语性能保持上均优于SFT，尤其在低资源语言中表现突出（仅需3,200样本即可超越SFT的6,400样本）。此外，CLO对数据量的敏感性较低，而SFT在中等和低资源语言中表现不稳定。

Conclusion: CLO是一种高效的语言迁移方法，特别适合数据受限环境，能够以更少的数据实现更好的性能，同时保持模型的英语能力。

Abstract: Adapting large language models to other languages typically employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a standard approach. However, it often suffers
from an overemphasis on English performance, a phenomenon that is especially
pronounced in data-constrained environments. To overcome these challenges, we
propose \textbf{Cross-Lingual Optimization (CLO)} that efficiently transfers an
English-centric LLM to a target language while preserving its English
capabilities. CLO utilizes publicly available English SFT data and a
translation model to enable cross-lingual transfer. We conduct experiments
using five models on six languages, each possessing varying levels of resource.
Our results show that CLO consistently outperforms SFT in both acquiring target
language proficiency and maintaining English performance. Remarkably, in
low-resource languages, CLO with only 3,200 samples surpasses SFT with 6,400
samples, demonstrating that CLO can achieve better performance with less data.
Furthermore, we find that SFT is particularly sensitive to data quantity in
medium and low-resource languages, whereas CLO remains robust. Our
comprehensive analysis emphasizes the limitations of SFT and incorporates
additional training strategies in CLO to enhance efficiency.

Conclusion: JOLT-SQL通过简化流程和增强鲁棒性，为Text-to-SQL任务提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, which maps natural language to SQL queries, has benefited
greatly from recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs offer
various paradigms for this task, including prompting and supervised fine-tuning
(SFT), SFT approaches still face challenges such as complex multi-stage
pipelines and poor robustness to noisy schema information. To address these
limitations, we present JOLT-SQL, a streamlined single-stage SFT framework that
jointly optimizes schema linking and SQL generation via a unified loss.
JOLT-SQL employs discriminative schema linking, enhanced by local bidirectional
attention, alongside a confusion-aware noisy schema sampling strategy with
selective attention to improve robustness under noisy schema conditions.
Experiments on the Spider and BIRD benchmarks demonstrate that JOLT-SQL
achieves state-of-the-art execution accuracy among comparable-size open-source

effectiveness of these models crucially depends on the overlap between query
and retrieved context, but the optimal degree of this overlap remains
unexplored. In this paper, we systematically investigate how varying levels of
query--context overlap affect model performance during both training and
inference. Our experiments reveal that increased overlap initially has minimal
effect, but substantially improves test-time perplexity and accelerates model
learning above a critical threshold. Building on these findings, we demonstrate
that deliberately increasing overlap through synthetic context can enhance data
efficiency and reduce training time by approximately 40\% without compromising
performance. We specifically generate synthetic context through paraphrasing
queries. We validate our perplexity-based findings on question-answering tasks,
confirming that the benefits of retrieval-augmented language modeling extend to
practical applications. Our results provide empirical evidence of significant
optimization potential for retrieval mechanisms in language model pretraining.

Abstract: Hausa Natural Language Processing (NLP) has gained increasing attention in
recent years, yet remains understudied as a low-resource language despite
having over 120 million first-language (L1) and 80 million second-language (L2)
speakers worldwide. While significant advances have been made in high-resource
languages, Hausa NLP faces persistent challenges, including limited open-source
datasets and inadequate model representation. This paper presents an overview
of the current state of Hausa NLP, systematically examining existing resources,
research contributions, and gaps across fundamental NLP tasks: text
classification, machine translation, named entity recognition, speech
recognition, and question answering. We introduce HausaNLP
(https://catalog.hausanlp.org), a curated catalog that aggregates datasets,
tools, and research works to enhance accessibility and drive further
development. Furthermore, we discuss challenges in integrating Hausa into large
language models (LLMs), addressing issues of suboptimal tokenization and
dialectal variation. Finally, we propose strategic research directions
emphasizing dataset expansion, improved language modeling approaches, and
strengthened community collaboration to advance Hausa NLP. Our work provides
both a foundation for accelerating Hausa NLP progress and valuable insights for
broader multilingual NLP research.

Method: 提出Meta-learning for In-context Deduction (MIND)方法，通过少样本元学习微调模型，使其能更好地泛化到未见过的知识库。

Result: MIND显著提升了1.5B到7B参数规模的小模型泛化能力，在低数据环境下表现尤为突出，甚至超越GPT-4o等大模型。

Conclusion: MIND方法为小规模语言模型在演绎推理任务中提供了有效的泛化解决方案，展示了元学习在推理任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on formal tasks,
where strong reasoning abilities define the state of the art. However, their
ability to generalize to out-of-distribution problems remains limited. In this
paper, we investigate how LLMs can achieve a systematic understanding of
deductive rules. Our focus is on the task of identifying the appropriate subset
of premises within a knowledge base needed to derive a given hypothesis. To
tackle this challenge, we propose Meta-learning for In-context Deduction
(MIND), a novel few-shot meta-learning fine-tuning approach. The goal of MIND
is to enable models to generalize more effectively to unseen knowledge bases
and to systematically apply inference rules. Our results show that MIND
significantly improves generalization in small LMs ranging from 1.5B to 7B
parameters. The benefits are especially pronounced in smaller models and
low-data settings. Remarkably, small models fine-tuned with MIND outperform
state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4o and o3-mini, on this task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型在长文本摘要中存在位置偏见，导致关键信息提取不足，现有改进方法复杂且存在挑战。

Method: QA-prompting方法在摘要生成前加入问答步骤，提取关键信息并丰富上下文，减少位置偏见。

Result: 在多个数据集和十种预训练模型上，QA-prompting优于基线和其他先进方法，ROUGE分数提升最高达29%。

Conclusion: QA-prompting为摘要任务提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，并强调了领域特定问题选择的重要性。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have revolutionized natural language processing,
enabling high-quality text generation through prompting and in-context
learning. However, models often struggle with long-context summarization due to
positional biases, leading to suboptimal extraction of critical information.
There are techniques to improve this with fine-tuning, pipelining, or using
complex techniques, which have their own challenges. To solve these challenges,
we propose QA-prompting - a simple prompting method for summarization that
utilizes question-answering as an intermediate step prior to summary
generation. Our method extracts key information and enriches the context of
text to mitigate positional biases and improve summarization in a single LM
call per task without requiring fine-tuning or pipelining. Experiments on
multiple datasets belonging to different domains using ten state-of-the-art
pre-trained models demonstrate that QA-prompting outperforms baseline and other
state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 29% improvement in ROUGE scores. This
provides an effective and scalable solution for summarization and highlights
the importance of domain-specific question selection for optimal performance.

TL;DR: OSoRA是一种新型的参数高效微调方法，通过结合SVD和可学习缩放向量，显著减少计算资源需求，同时保持或超越现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模语言模型的微调计算成本高，现有PEFT方法仍需大量资源，因此提出OSoRA以更高效地实现微调。

Method: OSoRA扩展了LoRA，通过SVD分解预训练权重矩阵，并优化输出维度向量，同时冻结奇异向量矩阵。

Result: 在数学推理、常识推理等任务中，OSoRA性能与LoRA和VeRA相当或更优，且参数规模线性增长。

Conclusion: 联合训练奇异值和输出维度向量是关键，OSoRA为高效微调提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly challenging
due to their massive scale and associated computational costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methodologies have been proposed as
computational alternatives; however, their implementations still require
significant resources. In this paper, we present OSoRA (Output-Dimension and
Singular-Value Initialized Low-Rank Adaptation), a novel PEFT method for LLMs.
OSoRA extends Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) by integrating Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) with learnable scaling vectors in a unified framework. It
first performs an SVD of pre-trained weight matrices, then optimizes an
output-dimension vector during training, while keeping the corresponding
singular vector matrices frozen. OSoRA substantially reduces computational
resource requirements by minimizing the number of trainable parameters during
fine-tuning. Comprehensive evaluations across mathematical reasoning, common
sense reasoning, and other benchmarks demonstrate that OSoRA achieves
comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods like LoRA and
VeRA, while maintaining a linear parameter scaling even as the rank increases
to higher dimensions. Our ablation studies further confirm that jointly
training both the singular values and the output-dimension vector is critical
for optimal performance.

Conclusion: 通过公开WirelessMathBench，推动开发更强大的领域感知大语言模型，适用于无线系统分析和工程应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results across a broad
array of tasks, yet their capacity for complex, domain-specific mathematical
reasoning-particularly in wireless communications-remains underexplored. In
this work, we introduce WirelessMathBench, a novel benchmark specifically
designed to evaluate LLMs on mathematical modeling challenges to wireless
communications engineering. Our benchmark consists of 587 meticulously curated
questions sourced from 40 state-of-the-art research papers, encompassing a
diverse spectrum of tasks ranging from basic multiple-choice questions to
complex equation completion tasks, including both partial and full completions,
all of which rigorously adhere to physical and dimensional constraints. Through
extensive experimentation with leading LLMs, we observe that while many models
excel in basic recall tasks, their performance degrades significantly when
reconstructing partially or fully obscured equations, exposing fundamental
limitations in current LLMs. Even DeepSeek-R1, the best performer on our
benchmark, achieves an average accuracy of only 38.05%, with a mere 7.83%
success rate in full equation completion. By publicly releasing
WirelessMathBench along with the evaluation toolkit, we aim to advance the
development of more robust, domain-aware LLMs for wireless system analysis and
broader engineering applications.

Motivation: 现有LoRA方法因随机初始化导致训练不稳定和知识迁移效率低，需改进。

Method: 通过SVD分解权重矩阵为幅度和方向分量，实现有原则的初始化。

Result: 在MMLU和GSM8K任务上分别达到48.35%和62.53%的准确率。

Conclusion: DuDe通过分解策略优化稳定性和预训练表示保留，成为PEFT领域的重要贡献。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a critical paradigm for
adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, among which Low-rank
Adaptation (LoRA) represents one of the most widely adopted methodologies.
However, existing LoRA-based approaches exhibit two fundamental limitations:
unstable training dynamics and inefficient knowledge transfer from pre-trained
models, both stemming from random initialization of adapter parameters. To
overcome these challenges, we propose DuDe, a novel approach that decomposes
weight matrices into magnitude and direction components, employing Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) for principled initialization. Our comprehensive
evaluation demonstrates DuDe's superior performance and robustness, achieving
up to 48.35\% accuracy on MMLU and 62.53\% ($\pm$ 1.59) accuracy on GSM8K. Our
theoretical analysis and empirical validation collectively demonstrate that
DuDe's decomposition strategy enhances optimization stability and better
preserves pre-trained representations, particularly for domain-specific tasks
requiring specialized knowledge. The combination of robust empirical
performance and rigorous theoretical foundations establishes DuDe as a
significant contribution to PEFT methodologies for LLMs.

Abstract: Generating a review for an academic research paper is a complex task that
requires a deep understanding of the document's content and the
interdependencies between its sections. It demands not only insight into
technical details but also an appreciation of the paper's overall coherence and
structure. Recent methods have predominantly focused on fine-tuning large
language models (LLMs) to address this challenge. However, they often overlook
the computational and performance limitations imposed by long input token
lengths. To address this, we introduce AutoRev, an Automatic Peer Review System
for Academic Research Papers. Our novel framework represents an academic
document as a graph, enabling the extraction of the most critical passages that
contribute significantly to the review. This graph-based approach demonstrates
effectiveness for review generation and is potentially adaptable to various
downstream tasks, such as question answering, summarization, and document
representation. When applied to review generation, our method outperforms SOTA
baselines by an average of 58.72% across all evaluation metrics. We hope that
our work will stimulate further research in applying graph-based extraction
techniques to other downstream tasks in NLP. We plan to make our code public
upon acceptance.

Result: 在30种语言上评估8个模型，MUG-Eval与现有基准强相关（r>0.75），支持跨语言和模型的标准化比较。

Conclusion: MUG-Eval为多语言生成评估提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Evaluating text generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is
challenging, particularly for low-resource languages where methods for direct
assessment are scarce. We propose MUG-Eval, a novel framework that evaluates
LLMs' multilingual generation capabilities by transforming existing benchmarks
into conversational tasks and measuring the LLMs' accuracies on those tasks. We
specifically designed these conversational tasks to require effective
communication in the target language. Then, we simply use task success rate as
a proxy of successful conversation generation. Our approach offers two key
advantages: it is independent of language-specific NLP tools or annotated
datasets, which are limited for most languages, and it does not rely on
LLMs-as-judges, whose evaluation quality degrades outside a few high-resource
languages. We evaluate 8 LLMs across 30 languages spanning high, mid, and
low-resource categories, and we find that MUG-Eval correlates strongly with
established benchmarks ($r$ > 0.75) while enabling standardized comparisons
across languages and models. Our framework provides a robust and
resource-efficient solution for evaluating multilingual generation that can be
extended to thousands of languages.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LAG（log-augmented generation）的新框架，通过直接复用过去的计算和推理日志来增强语言模型在新任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）及其代理版本难以保留和复用过去的推理经验，限制了其在新任务中的表现。

Method: LAG框架利用键值（KV）缓存存储过去任务的推理上下文，并在新任务中检索相关KV值以增强生成。

Result: 实验表明，LAG在知识和推理密集型数据集上显著优于未使用日志的标准代理系统和现有基于反思及KV缓存的技术。

Conclusion: LAG通过直接复用过去的推理和计算，提升了模型的适应性和准确性，同时保持了高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: While humans naturally learn and adapt from past experiences, large language
models (LLMs) and their agentic counterparts struggle to retain reasoning from
previous tasks and apply them in future contexts. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel framework, log-augmented generation (LAG) that directly
reuses prior computation and reasoning from past logs at test time to enhance
model's ability to learn from previous tasks and perform better on new, unseen
challenges, all while keeping the system efficient and scalable. Specifically,
our system represents task logs using key-value (KV) caches, encoding the full
reasoning context of prior tasks while storing KV caches for only a selected
subset of tokens. When a new task arises, LAG retrieves the KV values from
relevant logs to augment generation. Our approach differs from reflection-based
memory mechanisms by directly reusing prior reasoning and computations without
requiring additional steps for knowledge extraction or distillation. Our method
also goes beyond existing KV caching techniques, which primarily target
efficiency gains rather than improving accuracy. Experiments on knowledge- and
reasoning-intensive datasets demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms standard agentic systems that do not utilize logs, as well as
existing solutions based on reflection and KV cache techniques.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）存在知识遮蔽问题，即激活的知识片段可能掩盖其他相关知识，导致错误输出。目前对遮蔽现象的理解局限于推理阶段，缺乏对其训练过程中起源和内部机制的深入认识。

Method: 提出PhantomCircuit框架，利用知识电路分析技术，剖析注意力头的内部工作机制，追踪竞争知识路径如何导致遮蔽现象及其在训练过程中的演变。

Result: 实验证明PhantomCircuit能有效识别知识遮蔽实例，为这一难以捉摸的幻觉现象提供了新见解。

Conclusion: PhantomCircuit为研究社区提供了新的方法论视角，有望帮助缓解知识遮蔽问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, are
hampered by hallucinations. A particularly challenging variant, knowledge
overshadowing, occurs when one piece of activated knowledge inadvertently masks
another relevant piece, leading to erroneous outputs even with high-quality
training data. Current understanding of overshadowing is largely confined to
inference-time observations, lacking deep insights into its origins and
internal mechanisms during model training. Therefore, we introduce
PhantomCircuit, a novel framework designed to comprehensively analyze and
detect knowledge overshadowing. By innovatively employing knowledge circuit
analysis, PhantomCircuit dissects the internal workings of attention heads,
tracing how competing knowledge pathways contribute to the overshadowing
phenomenon and its evolution throughout the training process. Extensive
experiments demonstrate PhantomCircuit's effectiveness in identifying such
instances, offering novel insights into this elusive hallucination and
providing the research community with a new methodological lens for its
potential mitigation.

Result: 在多个代理模型和移动基准测试中，AgentGhost攻击准确率达99.7%，且仅导致1%的效用下降。提出的防御方法将攻击准确率降至22.1%。

Conclusion: AgentGhost展示了MLLM驱动的GUI代理的后门攻击风险，同时提出的防御方法为缓解此类威胁提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents powered by multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) have shown greater promise for human-interaction. However, due
to the high fine-tuning cost, users often rely on open-source GUI agents or
APIs offered by AI providers, which introduces a critical but underexplored
supply chain threat: backdoor attacks. In this work, we first unveil that
MLLM-powered GUI agents naturally expose multiple interaction-level triggers,
such as historical steps, environment states, and task progress. Based on this
observation, we introduce AgentGhost, an effective and stealthy framework for
red-teaming backdoor attacks. Specifically, we first construct composite
triggers by combining goal and interaction levels, allowing GUI agents to
unintentionally activate backdoors while ensuring task utility. Then, we
formulate backdoor injection as a Min-Max optimization problem that uses
supervised contrastive learning to maximize the feature difference across
sample classes at the representation space, improving flexibility of the
backdoor. Meanwhile, it adopts supervised fine-tuning to minimize the
discrepancy between backdoor and clean behavior generation, enhancing
effectiveness and utility. Extensive evaluations of various agent models in two
established mobile benchmarks show that AgentGhost is effective and generic,
with attack accuracy that reaches 99.7\% on three attack objectives, and shows
stealthiness with only 1\% utility degradation. Furthermore, we tailor a
defense method against AgentGhost that reduces the attack accuracy to 22.1\%.

Abstract: Instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance
on a variety of tasks; however, generalizing from synthetic to human-authored
instructions in grounded environments remains a challenge for them. In this
work, we study generalization challenges in spatial grounding tasks where
models interpret and translate instructions for building object arrangements on
a $2.5$D grid. We fine-tune LLMs using only synthetic instructions and evaluate
their performance on a benchmark dataset containing both synthetic and
human-written instructions. Our results reveal that while models generalize
well on simple tasks, their performance degrades significantly on more complex
tasks. We present a detailed error analysis of the gaps in instruction
generalization.

Motivation: 传统知识转移方法基于符号语言，无法实现真正的参数知识转移（PKT）。研究目标是探索跨规模LLMs的参数知识转移方法。

Method: 提出Pre-Align PKT（PrePKT）范式，并设计LaTen方法，通过少量训练步骤对齐不同规模LLMs的参数空间。同时重新定义Post-Align PKT（PostPKT）。

Result: 实验表明PostPKT和PrePKT均难以实现稳定转移，神经不兼容性是根本挑战。

Conclusion: 神经不兼容性是跨规模PKT的主要障碍，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transparent brain with accessible
parameters that encode extensive knowledge, which can be analyzed, located and
transferred. Consequently, a key research challenge is to transcend traditional
knowledge transfer paradigms rooted in symbolic language and achieve genuine
Parametric Knowledge Transfer (PKT). Significantly, exploring effective methods
for transferring knowledge across LLMs of different scales through parameters
presents an intriguing and valuable research direction. In this paper, we first
demonstrate $\textbf{Alignment}$ in parametric space is the fundamental
prerequisite to achieve successful cross-scale PKT. We redefine the previously
explored knowledge transfer as Post-Align PKT (PostPKT), which utilizes
extracted parameters for LoRA initialization and requires subsequent fine-tune
for alignment. Hence, to reduce cost for further fine-tuning, we introduce a
novel Pre-Align PKT (PrePKT) paradigm and propose a solution called
$\textbf{LaTen}$
($\textbf{L}$oc$\textbf{a}$te-$\textbf{T}$h$\textbf{e}$n-Alig$\textbf{n}$) that
aligns the parametric spaces of LLMs across scales only using several training
steps without following training. Comprehensive experiments on four benchmarks
demonstrate that both PostPKT and PrePKT face challenges in achieving
consistently stable transfer. Through in-depth analysis, we identify
$\textbf{Neural Incompatibility}$ as the ethological and parametric structural
differences between LLMs of varying scales, presenting fundamental challenges
to achieving effective PKT. These findings provide fresh insights into the
parametric architectures of LLMs and highlight promising directions for future
research on efficient PKT. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Creative Preference Optimization (CrPO)的新方法，通过多维度创造力信号优化LLM的生成内容，在保持高质量的同时提升新颖性、多样性和惊喜感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在自然语言生成任务中表现优异，但其生成真正创造性内容的能力仍有限。现有方法多聚焦于单一维度或任务，未能全面解决创造力的多面性问题。

Method: 提出CrPO方法，将多维度创造力信号模块化地注入偏好优化目标，并使用新的大规模人类偏好数据集MuCE进行训练和评估。

Result: 实验表明，采用CrPO的模型在自动和人工评估中均优于包括GPT-4o在内的基线模型，生成内容更具新颖性、多样性和惊喜感，同时保持高质量。

Conclusion: 研究证明，在偏好框架中直接优化创造力是提升LLM创造性能力的有效方向，且不影响输出质量。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
across natural language generation tasks, their ability to generate truly
creative content-characterized by novelty, diversity, surprise, and
quality-remains limited. Existing methods for enhancing LLM creativity often
focus narrowly on diversity or specific tasks, failing to address creativity's
multifaceted nature in a generalizable way. In this work, we propose Creative
Preference Optimization (CrPO), a novel alignment method that injects signals
from multiple creativity dimensions into the preference optimization objective
in a modular fashion. We train and evaluate creativity-augmented versions of
several models using CrPO and MuCE, a new large-scale human preference dataset
spanning over 200,000 human-generated responses and ratings from more than 30
psychological creativity assessments. Our models outperform strong baselines,
including GPT-4o, on both automated and human evaluations, producing more
novel, diverse, and surprising generations while maintaining high output
quality. Additional evaluations on NoveltyBench further confirm the
generalizability of our approach. Together, our results demonstrate that
directly optimizing for creativity within preference frameworks is a promising
direction for advancing the creative capabilities of LLMs without compromising
output quality.

Motivation: 探索替代传统自回归模型的范式，解决扩散语言模型的固定长度生成和缺乏灵活控制的问题。

Method: 结合自回归和扩散模型的优势，使用强化学习动态确定生成块大小，并引入分类器引导控制机制。

Result: CtrlDiff在混合扩散模型中表现优异，缩小了与最先进自回归模型的性能差距，支持多样任务的文本生成。

Conclusion: CtrlDiff通过动态块生成和高效控制机制，显著提升了扩散语言模型的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Although autoregressive models have dominated language modeling in recent
years, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternative paradigms to
the conventional next-token prediction framework. Diffusion-based language
models have emerged as a compelling alternative due to their powerful parallel
generation capabilities and inherent editability. However, these models are
often constrained by fixed-length generation. A promising direction is to
combine the strengths of both paradigms, segmenting sequences into blocks,
modeling autoregressive dependencies across blocks while leveraging discrete
diffusion to estimate the conditional distribution within each block given the
preceding context. Nevertheless, their practical application is often hindered
by two key limitations: rigid fixed-length outputs and a lack of flexible
control mechanisms. In this work, we address the critical limitations of fixed
granularity and weak controllability in current large diffusion language
models. We propose CtrlDiff, a dynamic and controllable semi-autoregressive
framework that adaptively determines the size of each generation block based on
local semantics using reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we introduce a
classifier-guided control mechanism tailored to discrete diffusion, which
significantly reduces computational overhead while facilitating efficient
post-hoc conditioning without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that CtrlDiff sets a new standard among hybrid diffusion models, narrows the
performance gap to state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches, and enables
effective conditional text generation across diverse tasks.

Motivation: 提升开源语言模型的推理能力，通过蒸馏高质量、已验证的推理数据。

Method: 收集三种教师模型（AM-Thinking-v1、Qwen3-235B-A22B、DeepSeek-R1）在189万查询上的输出，构建并行数据集并分析其分布，训练学生模型并在多个推理基准上评估。

Abstract: Distillation has emerged as a practical and effective approach to enhance the
reasoning capabilities of open-source language models. In this work, we conduct
a large-scale empirical study on reasoning data distillation by collecting
verified outputs from three state-of-the-art teacher models-AM-Thinking-v1,
Qwen3-235B-A22B, and DeepSeek-R1-on a shared corpus of 1.89 million queries. We
construct three parallel datasets and analyze their distributions, revealing
that AM-Thinking-v1-distilled data exhibits greater token length diversity and
lower perplexity. Student models trained on each dataset are evaluated on
reasoning benchmarks including AIME2024, AIME2025, MATH500, and LiveCodeBench.
The AM-based model consistently achieves the best performance (e.g., 84.3 on
AIME2024, 72.2 on AIME2025, 98.4 on MATH500, and 65.9 on LiveCodeBench) and
demonstrates adaptive output behavior-producing longer responses for harder
tasks and shorter ones for simpler tasks. These findings highlight the value of
high-quality, verified reasoning traces. We release the AM-Thinking-v1 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B distilled datasets to support future research on open and
high-performing reasoning-oriented language models. The datasets are publicly
available on Hugging Face\footnote{Datasets are available on Hugging Face:

*Mani Shemiranifar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，并非所有Transformer语言模型的层在推理过程中都被激活，通过L2自适应计算（LAC）方法跳过未激活层（Voids）可以提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Transformer语言模型在推理过程中各层的激活情况，验证是否存在未激活层，并研究跳过这些层对性能的影响。

Method: 使用L2自适应计算（LAC）方法监测激活层的L2范数变化，识别未激活层（Voids），并在指令调优模型（如Llama、Mistral、Qwen）上进行实验。

Result: 实验表明，跳过未激活层可以显著提升模型性能（如Qwen2.5-7B在MMLU任务中准确率从69.24提升至71.29），同时减少计算量（仅使用30%的层）。

Conclusion: 推理过程中并非所有层都同等重要，选择性跳过未激活层可以优化模型性能与效率。

Abstract: Despite advances in transformer-based language models (LMs), a fundamental
question remains largely unanswered: Are all layers activated during inference?
We investigate this question by detecting unactivated layers (which we refer to
as Voids) using a non-trainable and parameter-free adaptive computation method
called L2 Adaptive Computation (LAC). We adapt LAC from its original
efficiency-focused application to trace activated layers during inference. This
method monitors changes in the L2-norm of activations to identify voids. We
analyze layer activation in instruction-tuned LMs across two phases: Prompt
Processing (PP), where we trace activated layers for each token in the input
prompts, and Response Generation (RG), where we trace activated layers for each
generated token. We further demonstrate that distinct layers are activated
during these two phases. To show the effectiveness of our method, we evaluated
three distinct instruction-tuned LMs from the Llama, Mistral, and Qwen families
on three benchmarks: MMLU, GPQA Diamond, and BoolQ. For example, on MMLU with a
zero-shot setting, skipping voids in Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct resulted in an
improvement from 69.24 to 71.29 while the model uses only 30% of the layers.
Similarly, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3 on GPQA Diamond improved from 13.88 to
18.36 when using 70% of the layers during both the PP and RG phases. These
results show that not all layers contribute equally during inference, and that
selectively skipping most of them can improve the performance of models on
certain tasks.

Result: LLMs在混合代码输入下更易产生不安全输出，揭示了其内部机制。

Conclusion: 研究为理解LLMs在混合代码输入下的安全性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Recent advancements in LLMs have raised significant safety concerns,
particularly when dealing with code-mixed inputs and outputs. Our study
systematically investigates the increased susceptibility of LLMs to produce
unsafe outputs from code-mixed prompts compared to monolingual English prompts.
Utilizing explainability methods, we dissect the internal attribution shifts
causing model's harmful behaviors. In addition, we explore cultural dimensions
by distinguishing between universally unsafe and culturally-specific unsafe
queries. This paper presents novel experimental insights, clarifying the
mechanisms driving this phenomenon.

TL;DR: Citss框架通过自监督对比学习和两种策略（句子级裁剪和关键词扰动）解决引用分类中的数据稀缺和噪声问题，兼容编码器和解码器模型，实验表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 引用分类对学术分析至关重要，但直接微调预训练语言模型面临数据稀缺、上下文噪声和虚假关键词关联等挑战。

Method: 提出Citss框架，结合自监督对比学习、句子级裁剪和关键词扰动策略，适配编码器和解码器模型。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，Citss表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Citss有效解决了引用分类中的挑战，兼容多种模型，性能优越。

Abstract: Citation classification, which identifies the intention behind academic
citations, is pivotal for scholarly analysis. Previous works suggest
fine-tuning pretrained language models (PLMs) on citation classification
datasets, reaping the reward of the linguistic knowledge they gained during
pretraining. However, directly fine-tuning for citation classification is
challenging due to labeled data scarcity, contextual noise, and spurious
keyphrase correlations. In this paper, we present a novel framework, Citss,
that adapts the PLMs to overcome these challenges. Citss introduces
self-supervised contrastive learning to alleviate data scarcity, and is
equipped with two specialized strategies to obtain the contrastive pairs:
sentence-level cropping, which enhances focus on target citations within long
contexts, and keyphrase perturbation, which mitigates reliance on specific
keyphrases. Compared with previous works that are only designed for
encoder-based PLMs, Citss is carefully developed to be compatible with both
encoder-based PLMs and decoder-based LLMs, to embrace the benefits of enlarged
pretraining. Experiments with three benchmark datasets with both encoder-based
PLMs and decoder-based LLMs demonstrate our superiority compared to the
previous state of the art. Our code is available at: github.com/LITONG99/Citss

TL;DR: PlanGPT-VL是首个针对城市规划地图的领域专用视觉语言模型，通过创新方法显著提升规划地图分析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在城市规划地图分析中表现不佳，无法满足专业需求。

Method: 采用PlanAnno-V数据合成框架、关键点思维验证和综合训练方法。

Result: 在PlanBench-V基准测试中表现优于通用模型，且7B参数模型性能接近72B参数模型。

Conclusion: PlanGPT-VL为城市规划提供了高效、可靠的分析工具。

Abstract: In the field of urban planning, existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
frequently fail to effectively analyze and evaluate planning maps, despite the
critical importance of these visual elements for urban planners and related
educational contexts. Planning maps, which visualize land use, infrastructure
layouts, and functional zoning, require specialized understanding of spatial
configurations, regulatory requirements, and multi-scale analysis. To address
this challenge, we introduce PlanGPT-VL, the first domain-specific
Vision-Language Model tailored specifically for urban planning maps. PlanGPT-VL
employs three innovative approaches: (1) PlanAnno-V framework for high-quality
VQA data synthesis, (2) Critical Point Thinking to reduce hallucinations
through structured verification, and (3) comprehensive training methodology
combining Supervised Fine-Tuning with frozen vision encoder parameters. Through
systematic evaluation on our proposed PlanBench-V benchmark, we demonstrate
that PlanGPT-VL significantly outperforms general-purpose state-of-the-art VLMs
in specialized planning map interpretation tasks, offering urban planning
professionals a reliable tool for map analysis, assessment, and educational
applications while maintaining high factual accuracy. Our lightweight 7B
parameter model achieves comparable performance to models exceeding 72B
parameters, demonstrating efficient domain specialization without sacrificing
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有内容审核方法需为每个社区单独训练模型且缺乏透明度，限制了实际应用。

Method: MoMoE框架包含四个操作符（分配、预测、聚合、解释），分为社区专家和规范违规专家两类。

Result: 在30个未见过的子论坛上，MoMoE性能优于基线模型，并提供可靠解释。

Conclusion: MoMoE展示了无需社区微调即可实现可扩展、透明的审核，为可信人机治理提供新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in flagging harmful
content in online communities. Yet, existing approaches for moderation require
a separate model for every community and are opaque in their decision-making,
limiting real-world adoption. We introduce Mixture of Moderation Experts
(MoMoE), a modular, cross-community framework that adds post-hoc explanations
to scalable content moderation. MoMoE orchestrates four operators -- Allocate,
Predict, Aggregate, Explain -- and is instantiated as seven
community-specialized experts (MoMoE-Community) and five norm-violation experts
(MoMoE-NormVio). On 30 unseen subreddits, the best variants obtain Micro-F1
scores of 0.72 and 0.67, respectively, matching or surpassing strong fine-tuned
baselines while consistently producing concise and reliable explanations.
Although community-specialized experts deliver the highest peak accuracy,
norm-violation experts provide steadier performance across domains. These
findings show that MoMoE yields scalable, transparent moderation without
needing per-community fine-tuning. More broadly, they suggest that lightweight,
explainable expert ensembles can guide future NLP and HCI research on
trustworthy human-AI governance of online communities.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LRSA的新框架，结合小型语言模型（SLMs）和大型语言模型（LLMs）的优势，通过注入LLMs生成的解释作为理性依据，并采用双重交叉注意力机制，提升多模态方面情感分析（MABSA）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖小型语言模型（SLMs）在多模态数据中识别方面和情感，但其能力有限，导致结果不准确。大型语言模型（LLMs）虽表现优异，但在方面情感分析（ABSA）领域仍不及微调的小型模型。因此，需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出LRSA框架，将LLMs生成的解释注入SLMs，并采用双重交叉注意力机制增强特征交互与融合，从而提升SLMs在MABSA任务中的表现。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准测试中，LRSA表现优于基线模型，证明了其泛化能力和对大多数预训练模型的适用性。

Conclusion: LRSA框架通过结合SLMs和LLMs的优势，显著提升了多模态方面情感分析的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: There has been growing interest in Multimodal Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis
(MABSA) in recent years. Existing methods predominantly rely on pre-trained
small language models (SLMs) to collect information related to aspects and
sentiments from both image and text, with an aim to align these two modalities.
However, small SLMs possess limited capacity and knowledge, often resulting in
inaccurate identification of meaning, aspects, sentiments, and their
interconnections in textual and visual data. On the other hand, Large language
models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in various tasks by
effectively exploring fine-grained information in multimodal data. However,
some studies indicate that LLMs still fall short compared to fine-tuned small
models in the field of ABSA. Based on these findings, we propose a novel
framework, termed LRSA, which combines the decision-making capabilities of SLMs
with additional information provided by LLMs for MABSA. Specifically, we inject
explanations generated by LLMs as rationales into SLMs and employ a dual
cross-attention mechanism for enhancing feature interaction and fusion, thereby
augmenting the SLMs' ability to identify aspects and sentiments. We evaluated
our method using two baseline models, numerous experiments highlight the
superiority of our approach on three widely-used benchmarks, indicating its
generalizability and applicability to most pre-trained models for MABSA.

Motivation: 探索现代RNN架构在多模态环境中的能力，以替代传统的高计算复杂度的Transformer架构。

Method: 提出ModRWKV框架，采用RWKV7作为LLM主干，设计轻量级多模态模块，并利用预训练权重加速训练。

Result: 实验表明，ModRWKV在多模态任务中表现出色，且预训练权重对提升多模态信号理解能力至关重要。

Conclusion: 现代RNN架构是多模态大语言模型领域中Transformer的可行替代方案，且ModRWKV的最优配置通过系统探索得以确定。

Abstract: Currently, most multimodal studies are based on large language models (LLMs)
with quadratic-complexity Transformer architectures. While linear models like
RNNs enjoy low inference costs, their application has been largely limited to
the text-only modality. This work explores the capabilities of modern RNN
architectures in multimodal contexts. We propose ModRWKV-a decoupled multimodal
framework built upon the RWKV7 architecture as its LLM backbone-which achieves
multi-source information fusion through dynamically adaptable heterogeneous
modality encoders. We designed the multimodal modules in ModRWKV with an
extremely lightweight architecture and, through extensive experiments,
identified a configuration that achieves an optimal balance between performance
and computational efficiency. ModRWKV leverages the pretrained weights of the
RWKV7 LLM for initialization, which significantly accelerates multimodal
training. Comparative experiments with different pretrained checkpoints further
demonstrate that such initialization plays a crucial role in enhancing the
model's ability to understand multimodal signals. Supported by extensive
experiments, we conclude that modern RNN architectures present a viable
alternative to Transformers in the domain of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs). Furthermore, we identify the optimal configuration of the ModRWKV
architecture through systematic exploration.

Motivation: 探讨逻辑形式语言模型（LFLMs）的数据效率优势，以解决文本模型在数据需求上的局限性。

Method: 提出Graph-based Formal-Logical Distributional Semantics（GFoLDS）原型，一种基于图表示逻辑形式的预训练语言模型。

Result: GFoLDS在少量数据下表现优于文本模型，且性能可能随参数和数据增加而提升。

Conclusion: LFLMs在数据效率和实际应用潜力上具有显著优势。

Abstract: We make the case for language models over logical forms (LFLMs), arguing that
such models are more data-efficient than their textual counterparts. To that
end, we introduce the Graph-based Formal-Logical Distributional Semantics
(GFoLDS) prototype, a pretrained LM over graph representations of logical
forms, as a proof-of-concept of LFLMs. Using GFoLDS, we present strong
experimental evidence that LFLMs can leverage the built-in, basic linguistic
knowledge inherent in such models to immediately begin learning more complex
patterns. On downstream tasks, we show that GFoLDS vastly outperforms textual,
transformer LMs pretrained on similar amounts of data, indicating that LFLMs
can learn with substantially less data than models over plain text.
Furthermore, we show that the performance of this model is likely to scale with
additional parameters and pretraining data, suggesting the viability of LFLMs
in real-world applications.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLMs）具有内部思维链，能逐层分解和执行复合任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs如何通过不同网络深度学习和顺序执行子任务，以增强模型透明性。

Method: 使用层间上下文掩码和跨任务修补方法验证子任务在不同深度的学习，并通过LogitLens解码隐藏状态观察执行模式。

Result: 在15个两步复合任务和TRACE基准测试中，观察到一致的逐层执行模式。

Conclusion: LLMs具备内部规划和执行子任务的能力，为细粒度指令级激活调控提供了可能。

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) exhibit an $\textit{internal
chain-of-thought}$: they sequentially decompose and execute composite tasks
layer-by-layer. Two claims ground our study: (i) distinct subtasks are learned
at different network depths, and (ii) these subtasks are executed sequentially
across layers. On a benchmark of 15 two-step composite tasks, we employ
layer-from context-masking and propose a novel cross-task patching method,
confirming (i). To examine claim (ii), we apply LogitLens to decode hidden
states, revealing a consistent layerwise execution pattern. We further
replicate our analysis on the real-world $\text{TRACE}$ benchmark, observing
the same stepwise dynamics. Together, our results enhance LLMs transparency by
showing their capacity to internally plan and execute subtasks (or
instructions), opening avenues for fine-grained, instruction-level activation
steering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有多种去毒方法，但它们通常采用表面级修复，容易被绕过。本文旨在通过更精确的干预方法减少毒性输出。

Method: 利用稀疏自编码器识别毒性相关方向，并通过解码器向量进行针对性激活引导，分为三种攻击性级别。

Result: 在GPT-2 Small和Gemma-2-2B上，强引导级别可将毒性降低20%，但可能影响语言流畅性。标准NLP基准分数保持稳定。

Conclusion: 基于SAE的因果干预在去毒方面有潜力，但仍需改进特征解耦以提升效果，为安全部署提供实用指南。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in user-facing applications,
yet they still generate undesirable toxic outputs, including profanity,
vulgarity, and derogatory remarks. Although numerous detoxification methods
exist, most apply broad, surface-level fixes and can therefore easily be
circumvented by jailbreak attacks. In this paper we leverage sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify toxicity-related directions in the residual
stream of models and perform targeted activation steering using the
corresponding decoder vectors. We introduce three tiers of steering
aggressiveness and evaluate them on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2-2B, revealing
trade-offs between toxicity reduction and language fluency. At stronger
steering strengths, these causal interventions surpass competitive baselines in
reducing toxicity by up to 20%, though fluency can degrade noticeably on GPT-2
Small depending on the aggressiveness. Crucially, standard NLP benchmark scores
upon steering remain stable, indicating that the model's knowledge and general
abilities are preserved. We further show that feature-splitting in wider SAEs
hampers safety interventions, underscoring the importance of disentangled
feature learning. Our findings highlight both the promise and the current
limitations of SAE-based causal interventions for LLM detoxification, further
suggesting practical guidelines for safer language-model deployment.

Conclusion: KORGym有望成为推动LLM推理研究和复杂交互环境评估的重要工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) underscore the need for
more comprehensive evaluation methods to accurately assess their reasoning
capabilities. Existing benchmarks are often domain-specific and thus cannot
fully capture an LLM's general reasoning potential. To address this limitation,
we introduce the Knowledge Orthogonal Reasoning Gymnasium (KORGym), a dynamic
evaluation platform inspired by KOR-Bench and Gymnasium. KORGym offers over
fifty games in either textual or visual formats and supports interactive,
multi-turn assessments with reinforcement learning scenarios. Using KORGym, we
conduct extensive experiments on 19 LLMs and 8 VLMs, revealing consistent
reasoning patterns within model families and demonstrating the superior
performance of closed-source models. Further analysis examines the effects of
modality, reasoning strategies, reinforcement learning techniques, and response
length on model performance. We expect KORGym to become a valuable resource for
advancing LLM reasoning research and developing evaluation methodologies suited
to complex, interactive environments.

translate Nepali into English. We describe what makes Hindi a good candidate
for the pivot. We discuss ways in which a pivot language can be used, and use
two such approaches - the Transfer Method (fully supervised) and
Backtranslation (semi-supervised) - to translate Nepali into English. Using the
former, we are able to achieve a devtest Set SacreBLEU score of 14.2, which
improves the baseline fully supervised score reported by (Guzman et al., 2019)
by 6.6 points. While we are slightly below the semi-supervised baseline score
of 15.1, we discuss what may have caused this under-performance, and suggest
scope for future work.

*Sohaila Eltanbouly,Salam Albatarni,Tamer Elsayed*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TRATES是一个基于大语言模型（LLM）的自动化作文评分框架，专注于评估作文的特定特质，结合通用写作质量和提示特定特征，实现了最新性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化作文评分（AES）研究多关注整体评分，缺乏对作文个体特质的评估。

Method: TRATES利用LLM生成特质特定特征（评估问题），结合通用和提示特定特征，训练回归模型预测未见提示的作文特质分数。

Result: 实验表明，TRATES在广泛使用的数据集上实现了所有特质的最新性能，LLM生成的特征贡献最大。

Conclusion: TRATES通过特质特定和通用特征的结合，显著提升了自动化作文评分的性能。

Abstract: Research on holistic Automated Essay Scoring (AES) is long-dated; yet, there
is a notable lack of attention for assessing essays according to individual
traits. In this work, we propose TRATES, a novel trait-specific and
rubric-based cross-prompt AES framework that is generic yet specific to the
underlying trait. The framework leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) that
utilizes the trait grading rubrics to generate trait-specific features
(represented by assessment questions), then assesses those features given an
essay. The trait-specific features are eventually combined with generic
writing-quality and prompt-specific features to train a simple classical
regression model that predicts trait scores of essays from an unseen prompt.
Experiments show that TRATES achieves a new state-of-the-art performance across
all traits on a widely-used dataset, with the generated LLM-based features
being the most significant.

### [120] [Can Pruning Improve Reasoning? Revisiting Long-CoT Compression with Capability in Mind for Better Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14582)
*Shangziqi Zhao,Jiahao Yuan,Guisong Yang,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Prune-on-Logic框架，通过逻辑图剪枝优化长链思维推理（Long-CoT）在小型语言模型（SLM）中的表现，发现剪枝验证步骤能提升准确性并降低推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维推理（Long-CoT）虽能提升大语言模型（LLM）的准确性，但其冗长、自反的风格难以有效压缩到小型语言模型（SLM）中。研究旨在通过能力对齐视角探索剪枝是否能改进推理。

Method: 提出Prune-on-Logic框架，将Long-CoT转化为逻辑图，并在自验证约束下选择性剪枝低效推理步骤。分析了三种剪枝策略：整链剪枝、核心推理剪枝和验证剪枝。

Result: 剪枝验证步骤能显著提升准确性并降低推理成本，优于基于词元的基准方法和未压缩的微调方法。而剪枝推理或整链步骤则会导致性能下降。

Conclusion: 研究表明，小型模型受益于语义更精简的CoT而非更短的CoT，剪枝是一种有效的结构优化策略，可对齐CoT推理与SLM能力。

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning improves accuracy in LLMs, yet its
verbose, self-reflective style often hinders effective distillation into small
language models (SLMs). We revisit Long-CoT compression through the lens of
capability alignment and ask: Can pruning improve reasoning? We propose
Prune-on-Logic, a structure-aware framework that transforms Long-CoT into logic
graphs and selectively prunes low-utility reasoning steps under
self-verification constraints. Through systematic analysis across three pruning
strategies -- targeting entire chains, core reasoning, and verification -- we
find that pruning verification steps yields consistent accuracy gains while
reducing inference cost, outperforming token-level baselines and uncompressed
fine-tuning. In contrast, pruning reasoning or all-chain steps degrades
performance, revealing that small models benefit not from shorter CoTs, but
from semantically leaner ones. Our findings highlight pruning as a structural
optimization strategy for aligning CoT reasoning with SLM capacity.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于上下文完整性理论的强化学习方法，以解决大语言模型的安全和隐私问题，同时提升合规性和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的安全和隐私缓解策略未能保留上下文推理能力，且忽视合规标准，导致系统性风险。

Method: 采用强化学习结合规则奖励，将安全和隐私问题转化为上下文合规问题，并遵循GDPR、EU AI Act和HIPAA标准。

Result: 方法显著提升了法律合规性（安全和隐私基准准确率提升17.64%），并增强了通用推理能力（MMLU和LegalBench基准分别提升2.05%和8.98%）。

Conclusion: 研究通过上下文合规框架成功平衡了大语言模型的安全、隐私与推理能力，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, they also
introduce significant safety and privacy risks. Current mitigation strategies
often fail to preserve contextual reasoning capabilities in risky scenarios.
Instead, they rely heavily on sensitive pattern matching to protect LLMs, which
limits the scope. Furthermore, they overlook established safety and privacy
standards, leading to systemic risks for legal compliance. To address these
gaps, we formulate safety and privacy issues into contextualized compliance
problems following the Contextual Integrity (CI) theory. Under the CI
framework, we align our model with three critical regulatory standards: GDPR,
EU AI Act, and HIPAA. Specifically, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) with
a rule-based reward to incentivize contextual reasoning capabilities while
enhancing compliance with safety and privacy norms. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that our method not only significantly enhances
legal compliance (achieving a +17.64% accuracy improvement in safety/privacy
benchmarks) but also further improves general reasoning capability. For
OpenThinker-7B, a strong reasoning model that significantly outperforms its
base model Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct across diverse subjects, our method enhances its
general reasoning capabilities, with +2.05% and +8.98% accuracy improvement on
the MMLU and LegalBench benchmark, respectively.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进Model Context Protocol（MCP）安全性的框架，通过分析其缺失的安全机制，提出了Model Contextual Integrity Protocol（MCIP），并开发了细粒度分类法和基准数据，显著提升了LLMs在MCP交互中的安全性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MCP的分散架构带来了独特的安全挑战，现有安全机制不足，亟需系统性改进。

Method: 基于MAESTRO框架分析MCP的安全缺失，提出MCIP协议，开发分类法和基准数据，并通过实验验证改进效果。

Result: 实验表明，现有LLMs在MCP交互中存在安全漏洞，而提出的方法显著提升了其安全性。

Conclusion: MCIP协议及相关工具能有效提升MCP生态系统的安全性，为LLMs的安全交互提供了新方向。

Abstract: As Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduces an easy-to-use ecosystem for users
and developers, it also brings underexplored safety risks. Its decentralized
architecture, which separates clients and servers, poses unique challenges for
systematic safety analysis. This paper proposes a novel framework to enhance
MCP safety. Guided by the MAESTRO framework, we first analyze the missing
safety mechanisms in MCP, and based on this analysis, we propose the Model
Contextual Integrity Protocol (MCIP), a refined version of MCP that addresses
these gaps.Next, we develop a fine-grained taxonomy that captures a diverse
range of unsafe behaviors observed in MCP scenarios. Building on this taxonomy,
we develop benchmark and training data that support the evaluation and
improvement of LLMs' capabilities in identifying safety risks within MCP
interactions. Leveraging the proposed benchmark and training data, we conduct
extensive experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs. The results highlight LLMs'
vulnerabilities in MCP interactions and demonstrate that our approach
substantially improves their safety performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了代码敏感性（Code Sensitivity）的概念，并开发了CTF-Code基准和CTF-Instruct微调框架，以提升LLMs对代码细节变化的识别能力。实验表明，该方法显著提高了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码基准和指令数据关注难度和多样性，但忽略了代码敏感性。论文旨在填补这一空白，提升LLMs对代码细节变化的敏感性。

Method: 1. 构建CTF-Code基准，通过反事实扰动最小化输入变化并最大化输出变化；2. 提出CTF-Instruct框架，扩展现有数据并引入选择机制，平衡难度、多样性和敏感性。

Result: LLMs在CTF-Code上的性能下降超过10%；使用CTF-Instruct微调的模型在CTF-Code上提升2%，在LiveCodeBench上提升超过10%。

Conclusion: 增强代码敏感性可显著提升LLMs性能，CTF-Instruct框架是可行且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Code Sensitivity refers to the ability of Code LLMs to recognize and respond
to details changes in problem descriptions. While current code benchmarks and
instruction data focus on difficulty and diversity, sensitivity is overlooked.
We first introduce the CTF-Code benchmark, constructed using counterfactual
perturbations, minimizing input changes while maximizing output changes. The
evaluation shows that many LLMs have a more than 10\% performance drop compared
to the original problems. To fully utilize sensitivity, CTF-Instruct, an
incremental instruction fine-tuning framework, extends on existing data and
uses a selection mechanism to meet the three dimensions of difficulty,
diversity, and sensitivity. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned with
CTF-Instruct data achieve over a 2\% improvement on CTF-Code, and more than a
10\% performance boost on LiveCodeBench, validating the feasibility of
enhancing LLMs' sensitivity to improve performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生物医学领域有潜力生成假设，但存在真实性和幻觉问题，需要系统评估工具。

Method: 引入TruthHypo基准和KnowHD幻觉检测器，分析LLM生成假设的真实性。

Result: LLM难以生成真实假设，KnowHD的评分能有效筛选真实假设。

Conclusion: KnowHD可加速科学发现，验证了其识别真实假设的实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in scientific
disciplines such as biomedicine, particularly in hypothesis generation, where
they can analyze vast literature, identify patterns, and suggest research
directions. However, a key challenge lies in evaluating the truthfulness of
generated hypotheses, as verifying their accuracy often requires substantial
time and resources. Additionally, the hallucination problem in LLMs can lead to
the generation of hypotheses that appear plausible but are ultimately
incorrect, undermining their reliability. To facilitate the systematic study of
these challenges, we introduce TruthHypo, a benchmark for assessing the
capabilities of LLMs in generating truthful biomedical hypotheses, and KnowHD,
a knowledge-based hallucination detector to evaluate how well hypotheses are
grounded in existing knowledge. Our results show that LLMs struggle to generate
truthful hypotheses. By analyzing hallucinations in reasoning steps, we
demonstrate that the groundedness scores provided by KnowHD serve as an
effective metric for filtering truthful hypotheses from the diverse outputs of
LLMs. Human evaluations further validate the utility of KnowHD in identifying
truthful hypotheses and accelerating scientific discovery. Our data and source
code are available at https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/TruthHypo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM缺乏用户授权机制，sudoLLM旨在填补这一空白，提升安全性和角色对齐。

Method: 通过注入用户偏置信号训练LLM，仅在授权时输出敏感信息。

Result: 实验显示sudoLLM显著提升对齐性、泛化能力和抗攻击性。

Conclusion: sudoLLM作为额外安全层，补充现有机制，增强LLM端到端安全性。

Abstract: User authorization-based access privileges are a key feature in many
safety-critical systems, but have thus far been absent from the large language
model (LLM) realm. In this work, drawing inspiration from such access control
systems, we introduce sudoLLM, a novel framework that results in multi-role
aligned LLMs, i.e., LLMs that account for, and behave in accordance with, user
access rights. sudoLLM injects subtle user-based biases into queries and trains
an LLM to utilize this bias signal in order to produce sensitive information if
and only if the user is authorized. We present empirical results demonstrating
that this approach shows substantially improved alignment, generalization, and
resistance to prompt-based jailbreaking attacks. The persistent tension between
the language modeling objective and safety alignment, which is often exploited
to jailbreak LLMs, is somewhat resolved with the aid of the injected bias
signal. Our framework is meant as an additional security layer, and complements
existing guardrail mechanisms for enhanced end-to-end safety with LLMs.

TL;DR: EmoGist是一种无需训练、基于上下文学习的视觉情感分类方法，通过动态生成情感标签解释提升分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感在图像中的表现高度依赖上下文且复杂，传统静态标签定义难以捕捉这种动态性。

Method: 预生成情感标签的多版本解释，测试时通过嵌入相似性检索合适解释并输入快速视觉语言模型分类。

Result: 在多标签Memotion数据集上提升13点micro F1分数，在多类FI数据集上提升8点macro F1分数。

Conclusion: EmoGist通过动态上下文定义显著提升视觉情感分类性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce EmoGist, a training-free, in-context learning
method for performing visual emotion classification with LVLMs. The key
intuition of our approach is that context-dependent definition of emotion
labels could allow more accurate predictions of emotions, as the ways in which
emotions manifest within images are highly context dependent and nuanced.
EmoGist pre-generates multiple explanations of emotion labels, by analyzing the
clusters of example images belonging to each category. At test time, we
retrieve a version of explanation based on embedding similarity, and feed it to
a fast VLM for classification. Through our experiments, we show that EmoGist
allows up to 13 points improvement in micro F1 scores with the multi-label
Memotion dataset, and up to 8 points in macro F1 in the multi-class FI dataset.

Motivation: 研究动机是解决机器生成文本检测的困难性，尤其是针对优化后的语言模型。

Method: 提出了一种基于风格特征空间的检测方法，并研究了其对优化攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: 结果表明，风格特征空间检测方法对优化攻击具有鲁棒性，但随着样本数量增加，检测性能会提升。

Conclusion: 结论强调了避免依赖机器文本检测的建议，并提出了AURA指标用于评估检测性能。

Abstract: Despite considerable progress in the development of machine-text detectors,
it has been suggested that the problem is inherently hard, and therefore, that
stakeholders should proceed under the assumption that machine-generated text
cannot be reliably detected as such. We examine a recent such claim by Nicks et
al. (2024) regarding the ease with which language models can be optimized to
degrade the performance of machine-text detectors, including detectors not
specifically optimized against. We identify a feature space$\unicode{x2013}$the
stylistic feature space$\unicode{x2013}$that is robust to such optimization,
and show that it may be used to reliably detect samples from language models
optimized to prevent detection. Furthermore, we show that even when models are
explicitly optimized against stylistic detectors, detection performance remains
surprisingly unaffected. We then seek to understand if stylistic detectors are
inherently more robust. To study this question, we explore a new paraphrasing
approach that simultaneously aims to close the gap between human writing and
machine writing in stylistic feature space while avoiding detection using
traditional features. We show that when only a single sample is available for
detection, this attack is universally effective across all detectors
considered, including those that use writing style. However, as the number of
samples available for detection grows, the human and machine distributions
become distinguishable. This observation encourages us to introduce AURA, a
metric that estimates the overlap between human and machine-generated
distributions by analyzing how detector performance improves as more samples
become available. Overall, our findings underscore previous recommendations to
avoid reliance on machine-text detection.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在测试环境下行为变化的现象（类似霍桑效应），及其对安全对齐的影响，以提升安全评估的可信度。

Method: 提出白盒探测框架，通过线性识别测试意识相关激活，并控制模型朝向或远离测试意识，同时监测性能。

Result: 测试意识显著影响模型的安全对齐，且不同模型表现不同。框架实现了对这种现象的精细控制。

Conclusion: 通过量化和控制测试意识的影响，研究为提升安全评估的可信度提供了新方法。

Abstract: Reasoning-focused large language models (LLMs) sometimes alter their behavior
when they detect that they are being evaluated, an effect analogous to the
Hawthorne phenomenon, which can lead them to optimize for test-passing
performance or to comply more readily with harmful prompts if real-world
consequences appear absent. We present the first quantitative study of how such
"test awareness" impacts model behavior, particularly its safety alignment. We
introduce a white-box probing framework that (i) linearly identifies
awareness-related activations and (ii) steers models toward or away from test
awareness while monitoring downstream performance. We apply our method to
different state-of-the-art open-source reasoning LLMs across both realistic and
hypothetical tasks. Our results demonstrate that test awareness significantly
impact safety alignment, and is different for different models. By providing
fine-grained control over this latent effect, our work aims to increase trust
in how we perform safety evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LRMs在处理简单查询时因过度思考导致资源浪费，需一种自适应模型来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：混合微调（HFT）和在线强化学习（HGPO），并引入混合准确性指标评估模型能力。

Result: LHRMs在推理和通用能力上优于现有模型，同时显著提升效率。

Conclusion: 研究提倡重新审视深入思考的使用场景，为混合思考系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown substantially improved
reasoning capabilities over traditional Large Language Models (LLMs) by
incorporating extended thinking processes prior to producing final responses.
However, excessively lengthy thinking introduces substantial overhead in terms
of token consumption and latency, which is particularly unnecessary for simple
queries. In this work, we introduce Large Hybrid-Reasoning Models (LHRMs), the
first kind of model capable of adaptively determining whether to perform
thinking based on the contextual information of user queries. To achieve this,
we propose a two-stage training pipeline comprising Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) as
a cold start, followed by online reinforcement learning with the proposed
Hybrid Group Policy Optimization (HGPO) to implicitly learn to select the
appropriate thinking mode. Furthermore, we introduce a metric called Hybrid
Accuracy to quantitatively assess the model's capability for hybrid thinking.
Extensive experimental results show that LHRMs can adaptively perform hybrid
thinking on queries of varying difficulty and type. It outperforms existing
LRMs and LLMs in reasoning and general capabilities while significantly
improving efficiency. Together, our work advocates for a reconsideration of the
appropriate use of extended thinking processes and provides a solid starting
point for building hybrid thinking systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI模型能力增强，检测其风险行为（如Alignment Faking）变得更困难。受人类风险行为（如违法行为）常受价值观驱动的启发，研究认为识别AI的价值观可作为风险预警。

Method: 创建LitmusValues评估管道，揭示AI模型在多种价值类别中的优先级；收集AIRiskDilemmas数据集，模拟AI安全风险场景中的价值冲突。通过模型的选择行为预测其价值优先级。

Result: LitmusValues中的价值观（如Care）能预测AIRiskDilemmas中的已知风险行为及HarmBench中的未知风险行为。

Conclusion: 识别AI模型的价值优先级是预测其风险行为的有效方法，LitmusValues为AI安全提供了新工具。

Abstract: Detecting AI risks becomes more challenging as stronger models emerge and
find novel methods such as Alignment Faking to circumvent these detection
attempts. Inspired by how risky behaviors in humans (i.e., illegal activities
that may hurt others) are sometimes guided by strongly-held values, we believe
that identifying values within AI models can be an early warning system for
AI's risky behaviors. We create LitmusValues, an evaluation pipeline to reveal
AI models' priorities on a range of AI value classes. Then, we collect
AIRiskDilemmas, a diverse collection of dilemmas that pit values against one
another in scenarios relevant to AI safety risks such as Power Seeking. By
measuring an AI model's value prioritization using its aggregate choices, we
obtain a self-consistent set of predicted value priorities that uncover
potential risks. We show that values in LitmusValues (including seemingly
innocuous ones like Care) can predict for both seen risky behaviors in
AIRiskDilemmas and unseen risky behaviors in HarmBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习（RL）在LLM推理中的应用主要局限于数学和编程领域，限制了模型的泛化能力。本文旨在解决这一问题，扩展LLM的推理能力至更广泛的领域。

Method: 1. 构建大规模、高质量的多领域问题数据集；2. 开发基于生成模型的答案验证器，替代传统规则验证。

Result: 在12个多样化基准测试（如MMLU-Pro、GPQA等）中，General-Reasoner表现优于现有基线方法，展现出强大的泛化推理能力。

Conclusion: General-Reasoner成功提升了LLM在多领域的推理能力，同时保持了数学推理任务的高效性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently demonstrated strong potential in
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).
Particularly, the "Zero" reinforcement learning introduced by Deepseek-R1-Zero,
enables direct RL training of base LLMs without relying on an intermediate
supervised fine-tuning stage. Despite these advancements, current works for LLM
reasoning mainly focus on mathematical and coding domains, largely due to data
abundance and the ease of answer verification. This limits the applicability
and generalization of such models to broader domains, where questions often
have diverse answer representations, and data is more scarce. In this paper, we
propose General-Reasoner, a novel training paradigm designed to enhance LLM
reasoning capabilities across diverse domains. Our key contributions include:
(1) constructing a large-scale, high-quality dataset of questions with
verifiable answers curated by web crawling, covering a wide range of
disciplines; and (2) developing a generative model-based answer verifier, which
replaces traditional rule-based verification with the capability of
chain-of-thought and context-awareness. We train a series of models and
evaluate them on a wide range of datasets covering wide domains like physics,
chemistry, finance, electronics etc. Our comprehensive evaluation across these
12 benchmarks (e.g. MMLU-Pro, GPQA, SuperGPQA, TheoremQA, BBEH and MATH AMC)
demonstrates that General-Reasoner outperforms existing baseline methods,
achieving robust and generalizable reasoning performance while maintaining
superior effectiveness in mathematical reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Reward models play a critical role in guiding large language models toward
outputs that align with human expectations. However, an open challenge remains
in effectively utilizing test-time compute to enhance reward model performance.
In this work, we introduce Reward Reasoning Models (RRMs), which are
specifically designed to execute a deliberate reasoning process before
generating final rewards. Through chain-of-thought reasoning, RRMs leverage
additional test-time compute for complex queries where appropriate rewards are
not immediately apparent. To develop RRMs, we implement a reinforcement
learning framework that fosters self-evolved reward reasoning capabilities
without requiring explicit reasoning traces as training data. Experimental
results demonstrate that RRMs achieve superior performance on reward modeling
benchmarks across diverse domains. Notably, we show that RRMs can adaptively
exploit test-time compute to further improve reward accuracy. The pretrained
reward reasoning models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有终身学习方法在大规模实际应用中的效率和可扩展性问题。

Result: 编辑速度提升7倍以上，VRAM消耗减少2/3，支持百万级编辑并保持高准确性。

Conclusion: ULTRAEDIT在多种模型编辑场景中表现优异，是当前唯一能在消费级GPU上编辑7B LLM的方法。

Abstract: Lifelong learning enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to evolving
information by continually updating their internal knowledge. An ideal system
should support efficient, wide-ranging updates while preserving existing
capabilities and ensuring reliable deployment. Model editing stands out as a
promising solution for this goal, offering a focused and efficient way to
revise a model's internal knowledge. Although recent paradigms have made
notable progress, they often struggle to meet the demands of practical lifelong
adaptation at scale. To bridge this gap, we propose ULTRAEDIT-a fundamentally
new editing solution that is training-, subject- and memory-free, making it
particularly well-suited for ultra-scalable, real-world lifelong model editing.
ULTRAEDIT performs editing through a self-contained process that relies solely
on lightweight linear algebra operations to compute parameter shifts, enabling
fast and consistent parameter modifications with minimal overhead. To improve
scalability in lifelong settings, ULTRAEDIT employs a lifelong normalization
strategy that continuously updates feature statistics across turns, allowing it
to adapt to distributional shifts and maintain consistency over time. ULTRAEDIT
achieves editing speeds over 7x faster than the previous state-of-the-art
method-which was also the fastest known approach-while consuming less than 1/3
the VRAM, making it the only method currently capable of editing a 7B LLM on a
24GB consumer-grade GPU. Furthermore, we construct ULTRAEDITBENCH-the largest
dataset in the field to date, with over 2M editing pairs-and demonstrate that
our method supports up to 1M edits while maintaining high accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments on four datasets and six models show that ULTRAEDIT
consistently achieves superior performance across diverse model editing
scenarios. Our code is available at: https://github.com/XiaojieGu/UltraEdit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学CoT数据集存在思维跳跃问题，专家省略中间步骤影响模型学习和泛化能力。

Method: 提出CoT Thought Leap Bridge Task，构建ScaleQM+数据集，训练CoT-Bridge模型填补缺失步骤。

Result: 在NuminaMath等基准测试中，改进达+5.87%，增强蒸馏数据和强化学习起点。

Conclusion: CoT-Bridge提升推理完整性，具有广泛适用性，兼容现有优化技术。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on
mathemati-cal tasks through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, existing
mathematical CoT datasets often suffer from Thought Leaps due to experts
omitting intermediate steps, which negatively impacts model learning and
generalization. We propose the CoT Thought Leap Bridge Task, which aims to
automatically detect leaps and generate missing intermediate reasoning steps to
restore the completeness and coherence of CoT. To facilitate this, we
constructed a specialized training dataset called ScaleQM+, based on the
structured ScaleQuestMath dataset, and trained CoT-Bridge to bridge thought
leaps. Through comprehensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks,
we demonstrate that models fine-tuned on bridged datasets consistently
outperform those trained on original datasets, with improvements of up to
+5.87% on NuminaMath. Our approach effectively enhances distilled data (+3.02%)
and provides better starting points for reinforcement learning (+3.1%),
functioning as a plug-and-play module compatible with existing optimization
techniques. Furthermore, CoT-Bridge demonstrate improved generalization to
out-of-domain logical reasoning tasks, confirming that enhancing reasoning
completeness yields broadly applicable benefits.

TL;DR: 研究分析了Llama-3-70B-Instruct模型如何通过因果中介和抽象机制追踪角色信念，发现了一种称为“回溯机制”的算法模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型（LMs）如何表示角色信念，尤其是当这些信念与现实不同时，以理解其心智理论（ToM）能力。

Method: 构建了一个包含简单故事的数据集，分析模型通过回溯机制绑定角色-对象-状态信息的能力。

Result: 发现模型通过低秩子空间中的排序ID（OIs）绑定信息，并在需要时通过回溯机制检索。引入可见性ID后，模型能更新角色信念。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LMs的信念追踪机制，为逆向工程ToM推理提供了基础。

Abstract: How do language models (LMs) represent characters' beliefs, especially when
those beliefs may differ from reality? This question lies at the heart of
understanding the Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities of LMs. We analyze
Llama-3-70B-Instruct's ability to reason about characters' beliefs using causal
mediation and abstraction. We construct a dataset that consists of simple
stories where two characters each separately change the state of two objects,
potentially unaware of each other's actions. Our investigation uncovered a
pervasive algorithmic pattern that we call a lookback mechanism, which enables
the LM to recall important information when it becomes necessary. The LM binds
each character-object-state triple together by co-locating reference
information about them, represented as their Ordering IDs (OIs) in low rank
subspaces of the state token's residual stream. When asked about a character's
beliefs regarding the state of an object, the binding lookback retrieves the
corresponding state OI and then an answer lookback retrieves the state token.
When we introduce text specifying that one character is (not) visible to the
other, we find that the LM first generates a visibility ID encoding the
relation between the observing and the observed character OIs. In a visibility
lookback, this ID is used to retrieve information about the observed character
and update the observing character's beliefs. Our work provides insights into
the LM's belief tracking mechanisms, taking a step toward reverse-engineering
ToM reasoning in LMs.

Result: 总结了自监督学习在图像分割中的进展，提供了实用分类和关键观察。

Conclusion: 未来研究应使自监督学习在图像分割领域更易理解和应用。

Abstract: Supervised learning demands large amounts of precisely annotated data to
achieve promising results. Such data curation is labor-intensive and imposes
significant overhead regarding time and costs. Self-supervised learning (SSL)
partially overcomes these limitations by exploiting vast amounts of unlabeled
data and creating surrogate (pretext or proxy) tasks to learn useful
representations without manual labeling. As a result, SSL has become a powerful
machine learning (ML) paradigm for solving several practical downstream
computer vision problems, such as classification, detection, and segmentation.
Image segmentation is the cornerstone of many high-level visual perception
applications, including medical imaging, intelligent transportation,
agriculture, and surveillance. Although there is substantial research potential
for developing advanced algorithms for SSL-based semantic segmentation, a
comprehensive study of existing methodologies is essential to trace advances
and guide emerging researchers. This survey thoroughly investigates over 150
recent image segmentation articles, particularly focusing on SSL. It provides a
practical categorization of pretext tasks, downstream tasks, and commonly used
benchmark datasets for image segmentation research. It concludes with key
observations distilled from a large body of literature and offers future
directions to make this research field more accessible and comprehensible for
readers.

TL;DR: IPENS是一种交互式无监督多目标点云提取方法，利用辐射场信息将2D掩码提升至3D空间，解决谷物级分割问题，显著提升水稻和小麦的表型估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 植物表型技术的多样性需求及现有方法对大规模标注数据的依赖，促使开发无需标注数据的高效分割方法。

Method: IPENS结合SAM2分割2D掩码，通过辐射场信息提升至3D空间，设计多目标协同优化策略。

Result: 水稻数据集上mIoU达63.72%，小麦数据集上提升至89.68%，表型估计性能优异。

Conclusion: IPENS为水稻和小麦提供非侵入式高质量表型提取方案，显著加速智能育种效率。

Abstract: Advanced plant phenotyping technologies play a crucial role in targeted trait
improvement and accelerating intelligent breeding. Due to the species diversity
of plants, existing methods heavily rely on large-scale high-precision manually
annotated data. For self-occluded objects at the grain level, unsupervised
methods often prove ineffective. This study proposes IPENS, an interactive
unsupervised multi-target point cloud extraction method. The method utilizes
radiance field information to lift 2D masks, which are segmented by SAM2
(Segment Anything Model 2), into 3D space for target point cloud extraction. A
multi-target collaborative optimization strategy is designed to effectively
resolve the single-interaction multi-target segmentation challenge.
Experimental validation demonstrates that IPENS achieves a grain-level
segmentation accuracy (mIoU) of 63.72% on a rice dataset, with strong
phenotypic estimation capabilities: grain volume prediction yields R2 = 0.7697
(RMSE = 0.0025), leaf surface area R2 = 0.84 (RMSE = 18.93), and leaf length
and width predictions achieve R2 = 0.97 and 0.87 (RMSE = 1.49 and 0.21). On a
wheat dataset,IPENS further improves segmentation accuracy to 89.68% (mIoU),
with equally outstanding phenotypic estimation performance: spike volume
prediction achieves R2 = 0.9956 (RMSE = 0.0055), leaf surface area R2 = 1.00
(RMSE = 0.67), and leaf length and width predictions reach R2 = 0.99 and 0.92
(RMSE = 0.23 and 0.15). This method provides a non-invasive, high-quality
phenotyping extraction solution for rice and wheat. Without requiring annotated
data, it rapidly extracts grain-level point clouds within 3 minutes through
simple single-round interactions on images for multiple targets, demonstrating
significant potential to accelerate intelligent breeding efficiency.

Result: 在VIGOR、University-1652及新数据集Cross-View United Kingdom上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoVLM通过自然语言描述显著提升了跨视角地理定位的检索性能。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localisation identifies coarse geographical position of an
automated vehicle by matching a ground-level image to a geo-tagged satellite
image from a database. Despite the advancements in Cross-view geo-localisation,
significant challenges still persist such as similar looking scenes which makes
it challenging to find the correct match as the top match. Existing approaches
reach high recall rates but they still fail to rank the correct image as the
top match. To address this challenge, this paper proposes GeoVLM, a novel
approach which uses the zero-shot capabilities of vision language models to
enable cross-view geo-localisation using interpretable cross-view language
descriptions. GeoVLM is a trainable reranking approach which improves the best
match accuracy of cross-view geo-localisation. GeoVLM is evaluated on standard
benchmark VIGOR and University-1652 and also through real-life driving
environments using Cross-View United Kingdom, a new benchmark dataset
introduced in this paper. The results of the paper show that GeoVLM improves
retrieval performance of cross-view geo-localisation compared to the
state-of-the-art methods with the help of explainable natural language
descriptions. The code is available at

Result: 在IM2GPS3K和YFCC4K基准测试中取得最优结果，显著超越现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoRanker通过建模结构化空间关系，显著提升了图像地理定位的准确性。

Abstract: Worldwide image geolocalization-the task of predicting GPS coordinates from
images taken anywhere on Earth-poses a fundamental challenge due to the vast
diversity in visual content across regions. While recent approaches adopt a
two-stage pipeline of retrieving candidates and selecting the best match, they
typically rely on simplistic similarity heuristics and point-wise supervision,
failing to model spatial relationships among candidates. In this paper, we
propose GeoRanker, a distance-aware ranking framework that leverages large
vision-language models to jointly encode query-candidate interactions and
predict geographic proximity. In addition, we introduce a multi-order distance
loss that ranks both absolute and relative distances, enabling the model to
reason over structured spatial relationships. To support this, we curate
GeoRanking, the first dataset explicitly designed for geographic ranking tasks
with multimodal candidate information. GeoRanker achieves state-of-the-art
results on two well-established benchmarks (IM2GPS3K and YFCC4K), significantly
outperforming current best methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Frozen Backpropagation (fBP)的训练算法，通过周期性冻结反馈权重减少权重传输，从而降低硬件开销和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在神经形态硬件上直接训练SNN可以显著降低能耗，但反向传播（BP）的实现因前向和反馈网络权重对称性要求而面临挑战，导致硬件开销和能耗增加。

Method: 引入fBP算法，通过周期性冻结反馈权重减少权重传输，并提出三种部分权重传输方案以进一步优化效率。

Result: fBP在图像识别任务中表现优于现有方法，接近BP的准确率，同时通过部分权重传输可将传输成本降低1000x至10000x，准确率损失较小。

Conclusion: fBP为神经形态硬件设计提供了指导，支持基于BP的片上学习。

Abstract: Direct training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware
can greatly reduce energy costs compared to GPU-based training. However,
implementing Backpropagation (BP) on such hardware is challenging because
forward and backward passes are typically performed by separate networks with
distinct weights. To compute correct gradients, forward and feedback weights
must remain symmetric during training, necessitating weight transport between
the two networks. This symmetry requirement imposes hardware overhead and
increases energy costs. To address this issue, we introduce Frozen
Backpropagation (fBP), a BP-based training algorithm relaxing weight symmetry
in settings with separate networks. fBP updates forward weights by computing
gradients with periodically frozen feedback weights, reducing weight transports
during training and minimizing synchronization overhead. To further improve
transport efficiency, we propose three partial weight transport schemes of
varying computational complexity, where only a subset of weights is transported
at a time. We evaluate our methods on image recognition tasks and compare them
to existing approaches addressing the weight symmetry requirement. Our results
show that fBP outperforms these methods and achieves accuracy comparable to BP.
With partial weight transport, fBP can substantially lower transport costs by
1,000x with an accuracy drop of only 0.5pp on CIFAR-10 and 1.1pp on CIFAR-100,
or by up to 10,000x at the expense of moderated accuracy loss. This work
provides insights for guiding the design of neuromorphic hardware incorporating
BP-based on-chip learning.

Conclusion: ReSW-VL方法为手术阶段识别提供了一种有效的表示学习方案。

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition from video is a technology that automatically
classifies the progress of a surgical procedure and has a wide range of
potential applications, including real-time surgical support, optimization of
medical resources, training and skill assessment, and safety improvement.
Recent advances in surgical phase recognition technology have focused primarily
on Transform-based methods, although methods that extract spatial features from
individual frames using a CNN and video features from the resulting time series
of spatial features using time series modeling have shown high performance.
However, there remains a paucity of research on training methods for CNNs
employed for feature extraction or representation learning in surgical phase
recognition. In this study, we propose a method for representation learning in
surgical workflow analysis using a vision-language model (ReSW-VL). Our
proposed method involves fine-tuning the image encoder of a CLIP (Convolutional
Language Image Model) vision-language model using prompt learning for surgical
phase recognition. The experimental results on three surgical phase recognition
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to
conventional methods.

Result: 在GeoSound和SoundingEarth数据集上实现了跨模态检索的最先进性能，并支持基于位置的声景合成。

Conclusion: Sat2Sound通过多模态学习提升了声景映射能力，并展示了新的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present Sat2Sound, a multimodal representation learning framework for
soundscape mapping, designed to predict the distribution of sounds at any
location on Earth. Existing methods for this task rely on satellite image and
paired geotagged audio samples, which often fail to capture the diversity of
sound sources at a given location. To address this limitation, we enhance
existing datasets by leveraging a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate
semantically rich soundscape descriptions for locations depicted in satellite
images. Our approach incorporates contrastive learning across audio, audio
captions, satellite images, and satellite image captions. We hypothesize that
there is a fixed set of soundscape concepts shared across modalities. To this
end, we learn a shared codebook of soundscape concepts and represent each
sample as a weighted average of these concepts. Sat2Sound achieves
state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal retrieval between satellite image
and audio on two datasets: GeoSound and SoundingEarth. Additionally, building
on Sat2Sound's ability to retrieve detailed soundscape captions, we introduce a
novel application: location-based soundscape synthesis, which enables immersive
acoustic experiences. Our code and models will be publicly available.

Result: 多任务学习提高了口型识别和VSR的准确性及模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 口型识别应视为与VSR相关但独立的任务，迁移学习有助于解决口型标注有限的问题。

Abstract: Sign Language Recognition (SLR) systems primarily focus on manual gestures,
but non-manual features such as mouth movements, specifically mouthing, provide
valuable linguistic information. This work directly classifies mouthing
instances to their corresponding words in the spoken language while exploring
the potential of transfer learning from Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) to
mouthing recognition in German Sign Language. We leverage three VSR datasets:
one in English, one in German with unrelated words and one in German containing
the same target words as the mouthing dataset, to investigate the impact of
task similarity in this setting. Our results demonstrate that multi-task
learning improves both mouthing recognition and VSR accuracy as well as model
robustness, suggesting that mouthing recognition should be treated as a
distinct but related task to VSR. This research contributes to the field of SLR
by proposing knowledge transfer from VSR to SLR datasets with limited mouthing
annotations.

Conclusion: Ground-V数据集有效提升VLMs的像素级定位能力，为复杂指令下的视觉任务提供高质量数据支持。

Abstract: This work presents a simple yet effective workflow for automatically scaling
instruction-following data to elicit pixel-level grounding capabilities of VLMs
under complex instructions. In particular, we address five critical real-world
challenges in text-instruction-based grounding: hallucinated references,
multi-object scenarios, reasoning, multi-granularity, and part-level
references. By leveraging knowledge distillation from a pre-trained teacher
model, our approach generates high-quality instruction-response pairs linked to
existing pixel-level annotations, minimizing the need for costly human
annotation. The resulting dataset, Ground-V, captures rich object localization
knowledge and nuanced pixel-level referring expressions. Experiment results
show that models trained on Ground-V exhibit substantial improvements across
diverse grounding tasks. Specifically, incorporating Ground-V during training
directly achieves an average accuracy boost of 4.4% for LISA and a 7.9% for
PSALM across six benchmarks on the gIoU metric. It also sets new
state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks such as RefCOCO/+/g. Notably,
on gRefCOCO, we achieve an N-Acc of 83.3%, exceeding the previous
state-of-the-art by more than 20%.

Conclusion: 该方法通过物理驱动机制有效捕捉局部与整体的关系，提升了点云表示学习的性能。

Abstract: Existing point cloud representation learning tend to learning the geometric
distribution of objects through data-driven approaches, emphasizing structural
features while overlooking the relationship between the local information and
the whole structure. Local features reflect the fine-grained variations of an
object, while the whole structure is determined by the interaction and
combination of these local features, collectively defining the object's shape.
In real-world, objects undergo elastic deformation under external forces, and
this deformation gradually affects the whole structure through the propagation
of forces from local regions, thereby altering the object's geometric
properties. Inspired by this, we propose a physics-driven self-supervised
learning method for point cloud representation, which captures the relationship
between parts and the whole by constructing a local-whole force propagation
mechanism. Specifically, we employ a dual-task encoder-decoder framework,
integrating the geometric modeling capability of implicit fields with
physics-driven elastic deformation. The encoder extracts features from the
point cloud and its tetrahedral mesh representation, capturing both geometric
and physical properties. These features are then fed into two decoders: one
learns the whole geometric shape of the point cloud through an implicit field,
while the other predicts local deformations using two specifically designed
physics information loss functions, modeling the deformation relationship
between local and whole shapes. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing approaches in object classification, few-shot learning,
and segmentation, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Result: 在OpenOcc-NuScenes数据集上达到最优性能，且框架简单高效。

Conclusion: InstanceBEV为BEV全局建模提供了一种高效且无需额外优化的解决方案。

Abstract: Occupancy Grid Maps are widely used in navigation for their ability to
represent 3D space occupancy. However, existing methods that utilize multi-view
cameras to construct Occupancy Networks for perception modeling suffer from
cubic growth in data complexity. Adopting a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) perspective
offers a more practical solution for autonomous driving, as it provides higher
semantic density and mitigates complex object occlusions. Nonetheless,
BEV-based approaches still require extensive engineering optimizations to
enable efficient large-scale global modeling. To address this challenge, we
propose InstanceBEV, the first method to introduce instance-level
dimensionality reduction for BEV, enabling global modeling with transformers
without relying on sparsification or acceleration operators. Different from
other BEV methods, our approach directly employs transformers to aggregate
global features. Compared to 3D object detection models, our method samples
global feature maps into 3D space. Experiments on OpenOcc-NuScenes dataset show
that InstanceBEV achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a
simple, efficient framework without requiring additional optimizations.

reconstruction still suffers from flickering artifacts and storage
inefficiency, and struggles to model the emerging objects. To tackle this, we
introduce MGStream which employs the motion-related 3D Gaussians (3DGs) to
reconstruct the dynamic and the vanilla 3DGs for the static. The motion-related
3DGs are implemented according to the motion mask and the clustering-based
convex hull algorithm. The rigid deformation is applied to the motion-related
3DGs for modeling the dynamic, and the attention-based optimization on the
motion-related 3DGs enables the reconstruction of the emerging objects. As the
deformation and optimization are only conducted on the motion-related 3DGs,
MGStream avoids flickering artifacts and improves the storage efficiency.
Extensive experiments on real-world datasets N3DV and MeetRoom demonstrate that
MGStream surpasses existing streaming 3DGS-based approaches in terms of
rendering quality, training/storage efficiency and temporal consistency. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/pcl3dv/MGStream.

### [149] [SuperMapNet for Long-Range and High-Accuracy Vectorized HD Map Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13856)
*Ruqin Zhou,San Jiang,Wanshou Jiang,Yongsheng Zhang,Chenguang Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuperMapNet提出了一种用于长距离高精度矢量高清地图构建的方法，通过多模态输入和交互模块解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在BEV特征生成和地图元素分类定位中存在单模态限制、多模态协同不足以及点与元素信息交互缺失的问题。

Method: 结合相机图像和LiDAR点云输入，通过交叉注意力协同增强模块和流式差异对齐模块生成BEV特征，并利用点与元素的三级交互实现高精度分类定位。

Result: 在nuScenes和Argoverse2数据集上表现优异，分别超过SOTA方法14.9/8.8 mAP和18.5/3.1 mAP。

Conclusion: SuperMapNet通过多模态协同和点-元素交互显著提升了矢量高清地图的构建精度和范围。

Abstract: Vectorized HD map is essential for autonomous driving. Remarkable work has
been achieved in recent years, but there are still major issues: (1) in the
generation of the BEV features, single modality-based methods are of limited
perception capability, while direct concatenation-based multi-modal methods
fail to capture synergies and disparities between different modalities,
resulting in limited ranges with feature holes; (2) in the classification and
localization of map elements, only point information is used without the
consideration of element infor-mation and neglects the interaction between
point information and element information, leading to erroneous shapes and
element entanglement with low accuracy. To address above issues, we introduce
SuperMapNet for long-range and high-accuracy vectorized HD map construction. It
uses both camera images and LiDAR point clouds as input, and first tightly
couple semantic information from camera images and geometric information from
LiDAR point clouds by a cross-attention based synergy enhancement module and a
flow-based disparity alignment module for long-range BEV feature generation.
And then, local features from point queries and global features from element
queries are tightly coupled by three-level interactions for high-accuracy
classification and localization, where Point2Point interaction learns local
geometric information between points of the same element and of each point,
Element2Element interaction learns relation constraints between different
elements and semantic information of each elements, and Point2Element
interaction learns complement element information for its constituent points.
Experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate superior
performances, surpassing SOTAs over 14.9/8.8 mAP and 18.5/3.1 mAP under
hard/easy settings, respectively. The code is made publicly available1.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了开源视觉语言模型（VLM）在特定领域（以足球为例）的适应性，通过大规模数据集和LLM生成指令数据，采用课程学习方式微调模型，显著提升了足球相关任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解VLM研究多为领域无关，缺乏对特定领域迁移学习能力的探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，以足球为例研究VLM的适应性。

Method: 使用大规模足球数据集和LLM生成指令数据，采用课程学习方式（先教授关键概念，再问答任务）迭代微调通用VLM。

Result: 最终模型在足球视觉问答任务中相对提升37.5%，足球动作分类任务准确率从11.8%提升至63.5%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过领域特定数据和方法，VLM在特定任务中性能可显著提升，为其他领域应用提供了参考。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
multi-modal tasks by effectively aligning visual and textual representations.
However, most video understanding VLM research has been domain-agnostic,
leaving the understanding of their transfer learning capability to specialized
domains under-explored. In this work, we address this by exploring the
adaptability of open-source VLMs to specific domains, and focusing on soccer as
an initial case study. Our approach uses large-scale soccer datasets and LLM to
create instruction-following data, and use them to iteratively fine-tune the
general-domain VLM in a curriculum learning fashion (first teaching the model
key soccer concepts to then question answering tasks). The final adapted model,
trained using a curated dataset of 20k video clips, exhibits significant
improvement in soccer-specific tasks compared to the base model, with a 37.5%
relative improvement for the visual question-answering task and an accuracy
improvement from 11.8% to 63.5% for the downstream soccer action classification
task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有占用估计方法在烟雾、雨雪等恶劣环境下性能较差，需一种更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 通过生成伪LiDAR标签（包括占用查询和LiDAR高度图）作为多阶段监督，训练4D雷达占用估计模型，并与LiDAR占用图对齐。

Conclusion: 4D-ROLLS在占用估计中表现优异，并可扩展到下游任务，如BEV分割和点云占用预测。

Abstract: A comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes is essential for autonomous
vehicles (AVs), and among various perception tasks, occupancy estimation plays
a central role by providing a general representation of drivable and occupied
space. However, most existing occupancy estimation methods rely on LiDAR or
cameras, which perform poorly in degraded environments such as smoke, rain,
snow, and fog. In this paper, we propose 4D-ROLLS, the first weakly supervised
occupancy estimation method for 4D radar using the LiDAR point cloud as the
supervisory signal. Specifically, we introduce a method for generating
pseudo-LiDAR labels, including occupancy queries and LiDAR height maps, as
multi-stage supervision to train the 4D radar occupancy estimation model. Then
the model is aligned with the occupancy map produced by LiDAR, fine-tuning its
accuracy in occupancy estimation. Extensive comparative experiments validate
the exceptional performance of 4D-ROLLS. Its robustness in degraded
environments and effectiveness in cross-dataset training are qualitatively
demonstrated. The model is also seamlessly transferred to downstream tasks BEV
segmentation and point cloud occupancy prediction, highlighting its potential
for broader applications. The lightweight network enables 4D-ROLLS model to
achieve fast inference speeds at about 30 Hz on a 4060 GPU. The code of
4D-ROLLS will be made available at https://github.com/CLASS-Lab/4D-ROLLS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声视频常因低信噪比和分辨率不足影响诊断，且设备差异导致数据分布不一致，降低预训练模型的泛化能力。

Method: 采用视频自适应优化的神经网络（DUP），无需配对数据即可提升分辨率和去噪。

Result: 定量和视觉评估显示DUP优于现有超分辨率算法，显著提升下游应用效果。

Conclusion: DUP为超声视频提供了一种高效的自监督超分辨率解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely applied in clinical practice, yet ultrasound
videos often suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited
resolutions, posing challenges for diagnosis and analysis. Variations in
equipment and acquisition settings can further exacerbate differences in data
distribution and noise levels, reducing the generalizability of pre-trained
models. This work presents a self-supervised ultrasound video super-resolution
algorithm called Deep Ultrasound Prior (DUP). DUP employs a video-adaptive
optimization process of a neural network that enhances the resolution of given
ultrasound videos without requiring paired training data while simultaneously
removing noise. Quantitative and visual evaluations demonstrate that DUP
outperforms existing super-resolution algorithms, leading to substantial
improvements for downstream applications.

Abstract: Long videos contain a vast amount of information, making video-text retrieval
an essential and challenging task in multimodal learning. However, existing
benchmarks suffer from limited video duration, low-quality captions, and coarse
annotation granularity, which hinder the evaluation of advanced video-text
retrieval methods. To address these limitations, we introduce LoVR, a benchmark
specifically designed for long video-text retrieval. LoVR contains 467 long
videos and over 40,804 fine-grained clips with high-quality captions. To
overcome the issue of poor machine-generated annotations, we propose an
efficient caption generation framework that integrates VLM automatic
generation, caption quality scoring, and dynamic refinement. This pipeline
improves annotation accuracy while maintaining scalability. Furthermore, we
introduce a semantic fusion method to generate coherent full-video captions
without losing important contextual information. Our benchmark introduces
longer videos, more detailed captions, and a larger-scale dataset, presenting
new challenges for video understanding and retrieval. Extensive experiments on
various advanced embedding models demonstrate that LoVR is a challenging
benchmark, revealing the limitations of current approaches and providing
valuable insights for future research. We release the code and dataset link at

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline for Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) on Urdu newspapers. In our approach, we address the
unique challenges of complex multi-column layouts, low-resolution archival
scans, and diverse font styles. Our process decomposes the OCR task into four

column segmentation, we use YOLOv11x to separate columns in text to further
enhance performance - this model reaches a precision of 0.970 and mAP@50 of

different families, including Gemini, GPT, Llama, and Claude. The lowest WER of
0.133 is achieved by Gemini-2.5-Pro.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为StPR的无样本视频类增量学习框架，通过分离时空信息并动态路由任务专家，解决了现有方法在时空建模和隐私保护上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频类增量学习（VCIL）面临时空结构的复杂性，现有方法要么依赖样本重放（内存和隐私问题），要么忽视时间建模。

Method: StPR框架包含两部分：1）帧共享语义蒸馏（FSSD）选择重要语义通道进行正则化；2）基于时间分解的专家混合（TD-MoE）动态路由任务专家。

Result: 在UCF101、HMDB51和Kinetics400数据集上表现优于基线方法，同时提高了可解释性和效率。

Conclusion: StPR通过时空信息分离和动态路由，实现了无样本的高效VCIL，为时空建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video Class-Incremental Learning (VCIL) seeks to develop models that
continuously learn new action categories over time without forgetting
previously acquired knowledge. Unlike traditional Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL), VCIL introduces the added complexity of spatiotemporal structures,
making it particularly challenging to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while
effectively capturing both frame-shared semantics and temporal dynamics.
Existing approaches either rely on exemplar rehearsal, raising concerns over
memory and privacy, or adapt static image-based methods that neglect temporal
modeling. To address these limitations, we propose Spatiotemporal Preservation
and Routing (StPR), a unified and exemplar-free VCIL framework that explicitly
disentangles and preserves spatiotemporal information. First, we introduce
Frame-Shared Semantics Distillation (FSSD), which identifies semantically
stable and meaningful channels by jointly considering semantic sensitivity and
classification contribution. These important semantic channels are selectively
regularized to maintain prior knowledge while allowing for adaptation. Second,
we design a Temporal Decomposition-based Mixture-of-Experts (TD-MoE), which
dynamically routes task-specific experts based on their temporal dynamics,
enabling inference without task ID or stored exemplars. Together, StPR
effectively leverages spatial semantics and temporal dynamics, achieving a
unified, exemplar-free VCIL framework. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51,
and Kinetics400 show that our method outperforms existing baselines while
offering improved interpretability and efficiency in VCIL. Code is available in
the supplementary materials.

*Zhidan Liu,Chengtang Yao,Jiaxi Zeng,Yuwei Wu,Yunde Jia*

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多标签立体匹配方法，用于同时估计透明场景中透明物体和被遮挡背景的深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设视差维度为单模态分布，将匹配问题视为单标签回归问题，而透明场景需要多深度值估计。

Method: 采用多标签回归框架，引入像素级多元高斯表示，通过GRU迭代预测均值和协方差矩阵。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了透明表面的深度估计性能，同时保留了背景信息。

Conclusion: 多标签回归框架有效解决了透明场景的深度估计问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a multi-label stereo matching method to
simultaneously estimate the depth of the transparent objects and the occluded
background in transparent scenes.Unlike previous methods that assume a unimodal
distribution along the disparity dimension and formulate the matching as a
single-label regression problem, we propose a multi-label regression
formulation to estimate multiple depth values at the same pixel in transparent
scenes. To resolve the multi-label regression problem, we introduce a
pixel-wise multivariate Gaussian representation, where the mean vector encodes
multiple depth values at the same pixel, and the covariance matrix determines
whether a multi-label representation is necessary for a given pixel. The
representation is iteratively predicted within a GRU framework. In each
iteration, we first predict the update step for the mean parameters and then
use both the update step and the updated mean parameters to estimate the
covariance matrix. We also synthesize a dataset containing 10 scenes and 89
objects to validate the performance of transparent scene depth estimation. The
experiments show that our method greatly improves the performance on
transparent surfaces while preserving the background information for scene
reconstruction. Code is available at https://github.com/BFZD233/TranScene.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient visual transformer framework for
ultra-high-definition (UHD) image dehazing that addresses the key challenges of
slow training speed and high memory consumption for existing methods. Our
approach introduces two key innovations: 1) an \textbf{a}daptive
\textbf{n}ormalization mechanism inspired by the nGPT architecture that enables
ultra-fast and stable training with a network with a restricted range of
parameter expressions; and 2) we devise an atmospheric scattering-aware KV
caching mechanism that dynamically optimizes feature preservation based on the
physical haze formation model. The proposed architecture improves the training
convergence speed by \textbf{5 $\times$} while reducing memory overhead,
enabling real-time processing of 50 high-resolution images per second on an
RTX4090 GPU. Experimental results show that our approach maintains
state-of-the-art dehazing quality while significantly improving computational
efficiency for 4K/8K image restoration tasks. Furthermore, we provide a new

Motivation: 现有方法多关注精度提升，但计算效率未被充分探索，EGFormer旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入Any-modal Scoring Module（ASM）动态评分模态，Modal Dropping Module（MDM）过滤冗余模态。

Result: 参数减少88%，计算量减少50%，在无监督域适应任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: EGFormer在高效性和通用性上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent efforts have explored multimodal semantic segmentation using various
backbone architectures. However, while most methods aim to improve accuracy,
their computational efficiency remains underexplored. To address this, we
propose EGFormer, an efficient multimodal semantic segmentation framework that
flexibly integrates an arbitrary number of modalities while significantly
reducing model parameters and inference time without sacrificing performance.
Our framework introduces two novel modules. First, the Any-modal Scoring Module
(ASM) assigns importance scores to each modality independently, enabling
dynamic ranking based on their feature maps. Second, the Modal Dropping Module
(MDM) filters out less informative modalities at each stage, selectively
preserving and aggregating only the most valuable features. This design allows
the model to leverage useful information from all available modalities while
discarding redundancy, thus ensuring high segmentation quality. In addition to
efficiency, we evaluate EGFormer on a synthetic-to-real transfer task to
demonstrate its generalizability. Extensive experiments show that EGFormer
achieves competitive performance with up to 88 percent reduction in parameters
and 50 percent fewer GFLOPs. Under unsupervised domain adaptation settings, it
further achieves state-of-the-art transfer performance compared to existing
methods.

Conclusion: AppleGrowthVision连接了农业科学与计算机视觉，为精准农业中的水果检测、生长建模和3D分析提供了基础。未来工作包括改进标注和3D重建。

Abstract: Deep learning has transformed computer vision for precision agriculture, yet
apple orchard monitoring remains limited by dataset constraints. The lack of
diverse, realistic datasets and the difficulty of annotating dense,
heterogeneous scenes. Existing datasets overlook different growth stages and
stereo imagery, both essential for realistic 3D modeling of orchards and tasks
like fruit localization, yield estimation, and structural analysis. To address
these gaps, we present AppleGrowthVision, a large-scale dataset comprising two
subsets. The first includes 9,317 high resolution stereo images collected from
a farm in Brandenburg (Germany), covering six agriculturally validated growth
stages over a full growth cycle. The second subset consists of 1,125 densely
annotated images from the same farm in Brandenburg and one in Pillnitz
(Germany), containing a total of 31,084 apple labels. AppleGrowthVision
provides stereo-image data with agriculturally validated growth stages,
enabling precise phenological analysis and 3D reconstructions. Extending
MinneApple with our data improves YOLOv8 performance by 7.69 % in terms of
F1-score, while adding it to MinneApple and MAD boosts Faster R-CNN F1-score by
31.06 %. Additionally, six BBCH stages were predicted with over 95 % accuracy
using VGG16, ResNet152, DenseNet201, and MobileNetv2. AppleGrowthVision bridges
the gap between agricultural science and computer vision, by enabling the
development of robust models for fruit detection, growth modeling, and 3D
analysis in precision agriculture. Future work includes improving annotation,
enhancing 3D reconstruction, and extending multimodal analysis across all
growth stages.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合Mamba线性复杂度和CNN局部细节捕捉能力的方法，通过ESTD、CARG和MEPF模块提升高分辨率遥感图像中小目标的检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像中小目标识别精度低且计算成本高，现有方法如Transformer和CNN存在计算复杂度高或细节捕捉不足的问题。

Method: 结合Mamba的线性复杂度优势，设计了ESTD模块增强局部注意力，CARG模块强化空间和通道信息，以及MEPF模块融合多光谱数据。

Result: 提出的方法显著提升了小目标的检测精度，同时保持了较低的计算成本。

Conclusion: 通过结合全局注意力和局部细节捕捉，以及多光谱融合，该方法有效解决了小目标检测的挑战。

Abstract: Target detection in high-resolution remote sensing imagery faces challenges
due to the low recognition accuracy of small targets and high computational
costs. The computational complexity of the Transformer architecture increases
quadratically with image resolution, while Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
architectures are forced to stack deeper convolutional layers to expand their
receptive fields, leading to an explosive growth in computational demands. To
address these computational constraints, we leverage Mamba's linear complexity
for efficiency. However, Mamba's performance declines for small targets,
primarily because small targets occupy a limited area in the image and have
limited semantic information. Accurate identification of these small targets
necessitates not only Mamba's global attention capabilities but also the
precise capture of fine local details. To this end, we enhance Mamba by
developing the Enhanced Small Target Detection (ESTD) module and the
Convolutional Attention Residual Gate (CARG) module. The ESTD module bolsters
local attention to capture fine-grained details, while the CARG module, built
upon Mamba, emphasizes spatial and channel-wise information, collectively
improving the model's ability to capture distinctive representations of small
targets. Additionally, to highlight the semantic representation of small
targets, we design a Mask Enhanced Pixel-level Fusion (MEPF) module for
multispectral fusion, which enhances target features by effectively fusing

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Concept Rule Learner (CRL)的新框架，通过二值化视觉概念学习布尔逻辑规则，解决概念泄漏问题并提供局部和全局可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床应用中决策安全的需求凸显了基于概念的方法在医学影像中的潜力，但现有方法存在概念泄漏问题且仅关注局部解释。

Method: CRL框架利用逻辑层捕捉概念相关性并提取临床有意义的规则，实现局部和全局可解释性。

Result: 在两个医学图像分类任务中，CRL性能与现有方法相当，同时显著提高了对分布外数据的泛化能力。

Conclusion: CRL通过逻辑规则学习解决了概念泄漏问题，并提供了更全面的可解释性，适用于临床决策支持。

Abstract: The pursuit of decision safety in clinical applications highlights the
potential of concept-based methods in medical imaging. While these models offer
active interpretability, they often suffer from concept leakages, where
unintended information within soft concept representations undermines both
interpretability and generalizability. Moreover, most concept-based models
focus solely on local explanations (instance-level), neglecting the global
decision logic (dataset-level). To address these limitations, we propose
Concept Rule Learner (CRL), a novel framework to learn Boolean logical rules
from binarized visual concepts. CRL employs logical layers to capture concept
correlations and extract clinically meaningful rules, thereby providing both
local and global interpretability. Experiments on two medical image
classification tasks show that CRL achieves competitive performance with
existing methods while significantly improving generalizability to
out-of-distribution data. The code of our work is available at

TL;DR: Dolphin提出了一种新的多模态文档图像解析模型，通过两阶段分析-解析范式解决现有方法的效率瓶颈和布局退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文档图像解析方法存在集成开销、效率瓶颈和布局结构退化问题，Dolphin旨在解决这些限制。

Method: Dolphin采用两阶段范式：首先生成布局元素序列作为锚点，再结合任务提示并行解析内容。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Dolphin实现了最先进的性能，同时通过轻量级架构和并行解析机制确保高效性。

Conclusion: Dolphin通过创新的两阶段设计和大规模数据集训练，显著提升了文档图像解析的性能和效率。

Abstract: Document image parsing is challenging due to its complexly intertwined
elements such as text paragraphs, figures, formulas, and tables. Current
approaches either assemble specialized expert models or directly generate
page-level content autoregressively, facing integration overhead, efficiency
bottlenecks, and layout structure degradation despite their decent performance.
To address these limitations, we present \textit{Dolphin}
(\textit{\textbf{Do}cument Image \textbf{P}arsing via \textbf{H}eterogeneous
Anchor Prompt\textbf{in}g}), a novel multimodal document image parsing model
following an analyze-then-parse paradigm. In the first stage, Dolphin generates
a sequence of layout elements in reading order. These heterogeneous elements,
serving as anchors and coupled with task-specific prompts, are fed back to
Dolphin for parallel content parsing in the second stage. To train Dolphin, we
construct a large-scale dataset of over 30 million samples, covering
multi-granularity parsing tasks. Through comprehensive evaluations on both
prevalent benchmarks and self-constructed ones, Dolphin achieves
state-of-the-art performance across diverse page-level and element-level
settings, while ensuring superior efficiency through its lightweight
architecture and parallel parsing mechanism. The code and pre-trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/ByteDance/Dolphin

TL;DR: FractalMamba++是一种基于分形序列化和改进状态路由的视觉Mamba架构，解决了2D到1D序列化的挑战，并在高分辨率任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Mamba在视觉输入中的适应性受限于2D到1D序列化的挑战和输入分辨率扩展性问题，现有方法破坏了空间连续性。

Method: 采用Hilbert曲线的分形序列化保持空间局部性，引入Cross-State Routing（CSR）增强全局上下文传播，并提出Positional-Relation Capture（PRC）模块恢复局部邻接关系。

Result: 在图像分类、语义分割、目标检测和变化检测任务中，FractalMamba++表现优于现有Mamba架构，尤其在高分辨率场景下。

Conclusion: FractalMamba++通过分形序列化和改进的状态路由机制，显著提升了视觉任务的性能，特别是在高分辨率输入下。

Abstract: Vision Mamba has recently emerged as a promising alternative to
Transformer-based architectures, offering linear complexity in sequence length
while maintaining strong modeling capacity. However, its adaptation to visual
inputs is hindered by challenges in 2D-to-1D patch serialization and weak
scalability across input resolutions. Existing serialization strategies such as
raster scanning disrupt local spatial continuity and limit the model's ability
to generalize across scales. In this paper, we propose FractalMamba++, a robust
vision backbone that leverages fractal-based patch serialization via Hilbert
curves to preserve spatial locality and enable seamless resolution
adaptability. To address long-range dependency fading in high-resolution
inputs, we further introduce a Cross-State Routing (CSR) mechanism that
enhances global context propagation through selective state reuse.
Additionally, we propose a Positional-Relation Capture (PRC) module to recover
local adjacency disrupted by curve inflection points. Extensive experiments on
image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and change
detection demonstrate that FractalMamba++ consistently outperforms previous
Mamba-based backbones, particularly under high-resolution settings.

Abstract: Place recognition is a cornerstone of vehicle navigation and mapping, which
is pivotal in enabling systems to determine whether a location has been
previously visited. This capability is critical for tasks such as loop closure
in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and long-term navigation under
varying environmental conditions. In this survey, we comprehensively review
recent advancements in place recognition, emphasizing three representative
methodological paradigms: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based approaches,
Transformer-based frameworks, and cross-modal strategies. We begin by
elucidating the significance of place recognition within the broader context of
autonomous systems. Subsequently, we trace the evolution of CNN-based methods,
highlighting their contributions to robust visual descriptor learning and
scalability in large-scale environments. We then examine the emerging class of
Transformer-based models, which leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture
global dependencies and offer improved generalization across diverse scenes.
Furthermore, we discuss cross-modal approaches that integrate heterogeneous
data sources such as Lidar, vision, and text description, thereby enhancing
resilience to viewpoint, illumination, and seasonal variations. We also
summarize standard datasets and evaluation metrics widely adopted in the
literature. Finally, we identify current research challenges and outline
prospective directions, including domain adaptation, real-time performance, and
lifelong learning, to inspire future advancements in this domain. The unified

TL;DR: Land-MoE提出了一种新颖的多光谱土地覆盖分类方法，通过层次化插入低秩标记专家和频率感知滤波器，有效解决了光谱偏移问题，并在实验中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱土地覆盖分类中，传感器和地理空间条件差异导致的光谱偏移是主要挑战，现有方法性能有限。

Method: Land-MoE结合了低秩标记专家（MoLTE）和频率感知滤波器（FAF），动态调整特征并捕捉频率信息。

Result: 在跨传感器和跨地理空间实验中，Land-MoE大幅领先现有方法，并在RGB遥感图像的领域泛化任务中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: Land-MoE通过参数高效的方式优化视觉基础模型，显著提升了多光谱分类的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: We introduce Land-MoE, a novel approach for multispectral land cover
classification (MLCC). Spectral shift, which emerges from disparities in
sensors and geospatial conditions, poses a significant challenge in this
domain. Existing methods predominantly rely on domain adaptation and
generalization strategies, often utilizing small-scale models that exhibit
limited performance. In contrast, Land-MoE addresses these issues by
hierarchically inserting a Frequency-aware Mixture of Low-rank Token Experts,
to fine-tune Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in a parameter-efficient manner.
Specifically, Land-MoE comprises two key modules: the mixture of low-rank token
experts (MoLTE) and frequency-aware filters (FAF). MoLTE leverages
rank-differentiated tokens to generate diverse feature adjustments for
individual instances within multispectral images. By dynamically combining
learnable low-rank token experts of varying ranks, it enhances the robustness
against spectral shifts. Meanwhile, FAF conducts frequency-domain modulation on
the refined features. This process enables the model to effectively capture
frequency band information that is strongly correlated with semantic essence,
while simultaneously suppressing frequency noise irrelevant to the task.
Comprehensive experiments on MLCC tasks involving cross-sensor and
cross-geospatial setups demonstrate that Land-MoE outperforms existing methods
by a large margin. Additionally, the proposed approach has also achieved
state-of-the-art performance in domain generalization semantic segmentation
tasks of RGB remote sensing images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进Few-Shot Segmentation（FSS）的方法，通过设计Pseudo Prompt Generator和Iterative Memory Refinement来解决SAM 2视频数据与FSS任务不兼容的问题，并提升了分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Few-Shot Segmentation（FSS）容易过拟合，且现有方法（如SAM 2）的视频数据与FSS任务中不同帧的物体身份不一致，导致匹配步骤不兼容。

Method: 设计了Pseudo Prompt Generator生成伪查询记忆，并通过Iterative Memory Refinement和Support-Calibrated Memory Attention优化记忆，减少错误分割。

Result: 在PASCAL-5^i和COCO-20^i数据集上验证，1-shot mIoU比最佳基线提高了4.2%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了FSS任务中的匹配不兼容问题，显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Few-Shot Segmentation (FSS) aims to learn class-agnostic segmentation on few
classes to segment arbitrary classes, but at the risk of overfitting. To
address this, some methods use the well-learned knowledge of foundation models
(e.g., SAM) to simplify the learning process. Recently, SAM 2 has extended SAM
by supporting video segmentation, whose class-agnostic matching ability is
useful to FSS. A simple idea is to encode support foreground (FG) features as
memory, with which query FG features are matched and fused. Unfortunately, the
FG objects in different frames of SAM 2's video data are always the same
identity, while those in FSS are different identities, i.e., the matching step
is incompatible. Therefore, we design Pseudo Prompt Generator to encode pseudo
query memory, matching with query features in a compatible way. However, the
memories can never be as accurate as the real ones, i.e., they are likely to
contain incomplete query FG, and some unexpected query background (BG)
features, leading to wrong segmentation. Hence, we further design Iterative
Memory Refinement to fuse more query FG features into the memory, and devise a
Support-Calibrated Memory Attention to suppress the unexpected query BG
features in memory. Extensive experiments have been conducted on PASCAL-5$^i$
and COCO-20$^i$ to validate the effectiveness of our design, e.g., the 1-shot
mIoU can be 4.2\% better than the best baseline.

Conclusion: 研究为解决预训练权重偏差提供了实用见解，适用于多种深度学习任务。

Abstract: Supervised pretrained models have become widely used in deep learning,
especially for image segmentation tasks. However, when applied to specialized
datasets such as biomedical imaging, pretrained weights often introduce
unintended biases. These biases cause models to assign different levels of
importance to different slices, leading to inconsistencies in feature
utilization, which can be observed as asymmetries in saliency map
distributions. This transfer of color distributions from natural images to
non-natural datasets can compromise model performance and reduce the
reliability of results. In this study, we investigate the effects of these
biases and propose strategies to mitigate them. Through a series of
experiments, we test both pretrained and randomly initialized models, comparing
their performance and saliency map distributions. Our proposed methods, which
aim to neutralize the bias introduced by pretrained color channel weights,
demonstrate promising results, offering a practical approach to improving model
explainability while maintaining the benefits of pretrained models. This
publication presents our findings, providing insights into addressing
pretrained weight biases across various deep learning tasks.

Motivation: 现有基于机器学习的图像分割模型生成的置信分数缺乏统计严谨性，且忽略空间相关性，导致不确定性估计保守且难以解释。

Method: 提出CONSIGN方法，利用共形预测框架结合空间相关性，改进不确定性量化，适用于任何预训练分割模型。

Result: 在多个医学影像和COCO数据集上，CONSIGN显著优于标准像素级共形预测方法，提升了不确定性估计的质量。

Conclusion: CONSIGN通过整合空间结构，显著提升了图像分割中的不确定性量化性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Most machine learning-based image segmentation models produce pixel-wise
confidence scores - typically derived from softmax outputs - that represent the
model's predicted probability for each class label at every pixel. While this
information can be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains such as medical
imaging, these (uncalibrated) scores are heuristic in nature and do not
constitute rigorous quantitative uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction
(CP) provides a principled framework for transforming heuristic confidence
scores into statistically valid uncertainty estimates. However, applying CP
directly to image segmentation ignores the spatial correlations between pixels,
a fundamental characteristic of image data. This can result in overly
conservative and less interpretable uncertainty estimates. To address this, we
propose CONSIGN (Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via
Decomposition), a CP-based method that incorporates spatial correlations to
improve uncertainty quantification in image segmentation. Our method generates
meaningful prediction sets that come with user-specified, high-probability
error guarantees. It is compatible with any pre-trained segmentation model
capable of generating multiple sample outputs - such as those using dropout,
Bayesian modeling, or ensembles. We evaluate CONSIGN against a standard
pixel-wise CP approach across three medical imaging datasets and two COCO
dataset subsets, using three different pre-trained segmentation models. Results
demonstrate that accounting for spatial structure significantly improves
performance across multiple metrics and enhances the quality of uncertainty
estimates.

Conclusion: 自蒸馏的成功可能依赖于增强设计，提出的方法简单、通用且高效。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a valuable technique for compressing large
deep learning models into smaller, edge-suitable networks. However,
conventional KD frameworks rely on pre-trained high-capacity teacher networks,
which introduce significant challenges such as increased memory/storage
requirements, additional training costs, and ambiguity in selecting an
appropriate teacher for a given student model. Although a teacher-free
distillation (self-distillation) has emerged as a promising alternative, many
existing approaches still rely on architectural modifications or complex
training procedures, which limit their generality and efficiency.
  To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework based on
teacher-free distillation that operates using a single student network without
any auxiliary components, architectural modifications, or additional learnable
parameters. Our approach is built on a simple yet highly effective
augmentation, called intra-class patch swap augmentation. This augmentation
simulates a teacher-student dynamic within a single model by generating pairs
of intra-class samples with varying confidence levels, and then applying
instance-to-instance distillation to align their predictive distributions. Our
method is conceptually simple, model-agnostic, and easy to implement, requiring
only a single augmentation function. Extensive experiments across image
classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection show that our
method consistently outperforms both existing self-distillation baselines and
conventional teacher-based KD approaches. These results suggest that the
success of self-distillation could hinge on the design of the augmentation
itself. Our codes are available at

Conclusion: ReactDiff通过多模态和扩散模型的结合，为面部反应生成提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Given the audio-visual clip of the speaker, facial reaction generation aims
to predict the listener's facial reactions. The challenge lies in capturing the
relevance between video and audio while balancing appropriateness, realism, and
diversity. While prior works have mostly focused on uni-modal inputs or
simplified reaction mappings, recent approaches such as PerFRDiff have explored
multi-modal inputs and the one-to-many nature of appropriate reaction mappings.
In this work, we propose the Facial Reaction Diffusion (ReactDiff) framework
that uniquely integrates a Multi-Modality Transformer with conditional
diffusion in the latent space for enhanced reaction generation. Unlike existing
methods, ReactDiff leverages intra- and inter-class attention for fine-grained
multi-modal interaction, while the latent diffusion process between the encoder
and decoder enables diverse yet contextually appropriate outputs. Experimental
results demonstrate that ReactDiff significantly outperforms existing
approaches, achieving a facial reaction correlation of 0.26 and diversity score
of 0.094 while maintaining competitive realism. The code is open-sourced at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前会话搜索方法过于依赖顺序建模，忽略了交互中的图结构信息，而现有图结构方法又忽视了词级语义建模。

Method: SGR通过符号语法规则将会话图转换为文本，结合LLMs进行建模，并引入自监督学习任务（如链接预测、节点内容生成等）以增强LLMs对图结构的理解。

Result: 在两个基准数据集（AOL和Tiangong-ST）上的实验证明了SGR的优越性。

Conclusion: SGR为传统搜索策略与现代LLMs之间的桥梁提供了新颖有效的方法。

Abstract: Session search involves a series of interactive queries and actions to
fulfill user's complex information need. Current strategies typically
prioritize sequential modeling for deep semantic understanding, overlooking the
graph structure in interactions. While some approaches focus on capturing
structural information, they use a generalized representation for documents,
neglecting the word-level semantic modeling. In this paper, we propose Symbolic
Graph Ranker (SGR), which aims to take advantage of both text-based and
graph-based approaches by leveraging the power of recent Large Language Models
(LLMs). Concretely, we first introduce a set of symbolic grammar rules to
convert session graph into text. This allows integrating session history,
interaction process, and task instruction seamlessly as inputs for the LLM.
Moreover, given the natural discrepancy between LLMs pre-trained on textual
corpora, and the symbolic language we produce using our graph-to-text grammar,
our objective is to enhance LLMs' ability to capture graph structures within a
textual format. To achieve this, we introduce a set of self-supervised symbolic
learning tasks including link prediction, node content generation, and
generative contrastive learning, to enable LLMs to capture the topological
information from coarse-grained to fine-grained. Experiment results and
comprehensive analysis on two benchmark datasets, AOL and Tiangong-ST, confirm
the superiority of our approach. Our paradigm also offers a novel and effective
methodology that bridges the gap between traditional search strategies and
modern LLMs.

Method: 结合小波变换卷积核捕捉低频特征，引入一致性损失和像素级细化模块迭代优化深度与表面法线预测。

Result: 在合成火星数据集上，M3Depth深度估计精度提升16%，适用于真实火星场景。

Conclusion: M3Depth为火星探索任务提供了有效的深度估计解决方案。

Abstract: Depth estimation plays a great potential role in obstacle avoidance and
navigation for further Mars exploration missions. Compared to traditional
stereo matching, learning-based stereo depth estimation provides a data-driven
approach to infer dense and precise depth maps from stereo image pairs.
However, these methods always suffer performance degradation in environments
with sparse textures and lacking geometric constraints, such as the
unstructured terrain of Mars. To address these challenges, we propose M3Depth,
a depth estimation model tailored for Mars rovers. Considering the sparse and
smooth texture of Martian terrain, which is primarily composed of low-frequency
features, our model incorporates a convolutional kernel based on wavelet
transform that effectively captures low-frequency response and expands the
receptive field. Additionally, we introduce a consistency loss that explicitly
models the complementary relationship between depth map and surface normal map,
utilizing the surface normal as a geometric constraint to enhance the accuracy
of depth estimation. Besides, a pixel-wise refinement module with mutual
boosting mechanism is designed to iteratively refine both depth and surface
normal predictions. Experimental results on synthetic Mars datasets with depth
annotations show that M3Depth achieves a significant 16% improvement in depth
estimation accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods in depth
estimation. Furthermore, the model demonstrates strong applicability in
real-world Martian scenarios, offering a promising solution for future Mars
exploration missions.

Result: 实验表明，LMP在生成质量、提示-视频一致性和控制能力上达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: LMP框架有效解决了视频生成中的运动控制问题，为文本到视频和图像到视频生成提供了新方法。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale pre-trained diffusion transformer models have
made significant progress in video generation. While current DiT models can
produce high-definition, high-frame-rate, and highly diverse videos, there is a
lack of fine-grained control over the video content. Controlling the motion of
subjects in videos using only prompts is challenging, especially when it comes
to describing complex movements. Further, existing methods fail to control the
motion in image-to-video generation, as the subject in the reference image
often differs from the subject in the reference video in terms of initial
position, size, and shape. To address this, we propose the Leveraging Motion
Prior (LMP) framework for zero-shot video generation. Our framework harnesses
the powerful generative capabilities of pre-trained diffusion transformers to
enable motion in the generated videos to reference user-provided motion videos
in both text-to-video and image-to-video generation. To this end, we first
introduce a foreground-background disentangle module to distinguish between
moving subjects and backgrounds in the reference video, preventing interference
in the target video generation. A reweighted motion transfer module is designed
to allow the target video to reference the motion from the reference video. To
avoid interference from the subject in the reference video, we propose an
appearance separation module to suppress the appearance of the reference
subject in the target video. We annotate the DAVIS dataset with detailed
prompts for our experiments and design evaluation metrics to validate the
effectiveness of our method. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in generation quality,
prompt-video consistency, and control capability. Our homepage is available at

### [177] [Towards Omnidirectional Reasoning with 360-R1: A Dataset, Benchmark, and GRPO-based Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14197)
*Xinshen Zhang,Zhen Ye,Xu Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了OmniVQA数据集和基准测试，评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在全景视觉问答中的表现，发现其存在显著局限性，并提出了一种基于强化学习的方法360-R1以提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在全景视觉理解和问答方面的能力尚未充分探索，需要填补这一空白并解决全景场景中的挑战。

Method: 引入OmniVQA数据集和基准测试，并提出基于Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct的强化学习方法360-R1，包含三种新型奖励函数。

Result: 实验表明360-R1在全景空间中的表现优于现有方法，提升了6%。

Conclusion: 全景视觉问答需要专门的方法，360-R1为未来研究提供了有效方向。

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs), with their 360{\deg} field of view, provide
unparalleled spatial awareness for immersive applications like augmented
reality and embodied AI. However, the capability of existing multi-modal large
language models (MLLMs) to comprehend and reason about such panoramic scenes
remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by introducing OmniVQA,
the first dataset and conducting the first benchmark for omnidirectional visual
question answering. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals
significant limitations in handling omnidirectional visual question answering,
highlighting persistent challenges in object localization, feature extraction,
and hallucination suppression within panoramic contexts. These results
underscore the disconnect between current MLLM capabilities and the demands of
omnidirectional visual understanding, which calls for dedicated architectural
or training innovations tailored to 360{\deg} imagery. Building on the OmniVQA
dataset and benchmark, we further introduce a rule-based reinforcement learning
method, 360-R1, based on Qwen2.5-VL-Instruct. Concretely, we modify the group
relative policy optimization (GRPO) by proposing three novel reward functions:
(1) reasoning process similarity reward, (2) answer semantic accuracy reward,
and (3) structured format compliance reward. Extensive experiments on our
OmniVQA demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in omnidirectional
space (+6% improvement).

*Yang Hu,Runchen Wang,Stephen Chong Zhao,Xuhui Zhan,Do Hun Kim,Mark Wallace,David A. Tovar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Perceptual-Initialization (PI) 是一种新的视觉表示学习方法，通过在初始化阶段融入人类感知结构，而非后续微调，显著提升了零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常将人类感知数据用于微调阶段，而本文挑战这一观念，探索在早期表示学习中嵌入人类感知结构的潜力。

Method: 利用NIGHTS数据集的人类感知三元组嵌入初始化CLIP视觉编码器，随后在YFCC15M上进行自监督学习。

Result: 在29个零样本分类和2个检索基准测试中，PI显著提升了性能，无需任务特定微调。例如，在ImageNet-1K上，15个预训练周期后即出现零样本性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在早期表示学习中融入人类感知结构，能够构建更强大且泛化能力更强的视觉-语言对齐系统。

Abstract: We introduce Perceptual-Initialization (PI), a paradigm shift in visual
representation learning that incorporates human perceptual structure during the
initialization phase rather than as a downstream fine-tuning step. By
integrating human-derived triplet embeddings from the NIGHTS dataset to
initialize a CLIP vision encoder, followed by self-supervised learning on
YFCC15M, our approach demonstrates significant zero-shot performance
improvements, without any task-specific fine-tuning, across 29 zero shot
classification and 2 retrieval benchmarks. On ImageNet-1K, zero-shot gains
emerge after approximately 15 epochs of pretraining. Benefits are observed
across datasets of various scales, with improvements manifesting at different
stages of the pretraining process depending on dataset characteristics. Our
approach consistently enhances zero-shot top-1 accuracy, top-5 accuracy, and
retrieval recall (e.g., R@1, R@5) across these diverse evaluation tasks,
without requiring any adaptation to target domains. These findings challenge
the conventional wisdom of using human-perceptual data primarily for
fine-tuning and demonstrate that embedding human perceptual structure during
early representation learning yields more capable and vision-language aligned
systems that generalize immediately to unseen tasks. Our work shows that
"beginning with you", starting with human perception, provides a stronger
foundation for general-purpose vision-language intelligence.

*Jie Li,Shengwei Tian,Long Yu,Xin Ning*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种灵活加权的Chamfer距离（FCD），通过调整全局和局部组件的权重，优化点云生成的全局分布和整体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Chamfer距离（CD）作为目标函数时，固定权重可能导致全局分布不佳，尽管整体性能看似良好。

Method: 提出FCD，为CD的全局分布组件分配更高权重，并采用灵活加权策略调整组件平衡。

Result: 在多个评估指标（CD、EMD、DCD、F-Score）和人类评估中，FCD表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: FCD有效改善了点云生成的全局分布，同时保持了良好的整体性能。

Abstract: Chamfer Distance (CD) comprises two components that can evaluate the global
distribution and local performance of generated point clouds, making it widely
utilized as a similarity measure between generated and target point clouds in
point cloud completion tasks. Additionally, CD's computational efficiency has
led to its frequent application as an objective function for guiding point
cloud generation. However, using CD directly as an objective function with
fixed equal weights for its two components can often result in seemingly high
overall performance (i.e., low CD score), while failing to achieve a good
global distribution. This is typically reflected in high Earth Mover's Distance
(EMD) and Decomposed Chamfer Distance (DCD) scores, alongside poor human
assessments. To address this issue, we propose a Flexible-Weighted Chamfer
Distance (FCD) to guide point cloud generation. FCD assigns a higher weight to
the global distribution component of CD and incorporates a flexible weighting
strategy to adjust the balance between the two components, aiming to improve
global distribution while maintaining robust overall performance. Experimental
results on two state-of-the-art networks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior results across multiple evaluation metrics, including CD, EMD, DCD,
and F-Score, as well as in human evaluations.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多模态任务VoQA，要求模型仅通过视觉输入回答问题，挑战现有大视觉语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型在纯视觉问题回答任务中的性能不足问题。

Method: 引入GRT-SFT策略，通过结构化微调引导模型逐步推理。

Result: 显著提升了模型在纯视觉输入下的性能。

Conclusion: 增强了模型在复杂多模态场景中的视觉理解能力。

Abstract: We propose Visual-only Question Answering (VoQA), a novel multimodal task in
which questions are visually embedded within images, without any accompanying
textual input. This requires models to locate, recognize, and reason over
visually embedded textual questions, posing challenges for existing large
vision-language models (LVLMs), which show notable performance drops even with
carefully designed prompts. To bridge this gap, we introduce Guided Response
Triggering Supervised Fine-tuning (GRT-SFT), a structured fine-tuning strategy
that guides the model to perform step-by-step reasoning purely based on visual
input, significantly improving model performance. Our work enhances models'
capacity for human-like visual understanding in complex multimodal scenarios,
where information, including language, is perceived visually.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniVG-R1提出了一种基于强化学习的多模态大语言模型，用于解决复杂多图像场景下的视觉定位任务，通过推理链数据集和难度感知策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉定位方法难以处理复杂多模态场景，缺乏高级推理能力。UniVG-R1旨在解决这一问题，提升模型的通用性和推理能力。

Method: 1. 构建推理链数据集进行监督微调；2. 使用基于规则的强化学习优化推理能力；3. 提出难度感知权重调整策略。

Result: 在MIG-Bench上性能提升9.1%，零样本性能平均提升23.4%。

Conclusion: UniVG-R1在复杂视觉定位任务中表现出色，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Traditional visual grounding methods primarily focus on single-image
scenarios with simple textual references. However, extending these methods to
real-world scenarios that involve implicit and complex instructions,
particularly in conjunction with multiple images, poses significant challenges,
which is mainly due to the lack of advanced reasoning ability across diverse
multi-modal contexts. In this work, we aim to address the more practical
universal grounding task, and propose UniVG-R1, a reasoning guided multimodal
large language model (MLLM) for universal visual grounding, which enhances
reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL) combined with
cold-start data. Specifically, we first construct a high-quality
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) grounding dataset, annotated with detailed reasoning
chains, to guide the model towards correct reasoning paths via supervised
fine-tuning. Subsequently, we perform rule-based reinforcement learning to
encourage the model to identify correct reasoning chains, thereby incentivizing
its reasoning capabilities. In addition, we identify a difficulty bias arising
from the prevalence of easy samples as RL training progresses, and we propose a
difficulty-aware weight adjustment strategy to further strengthen the
performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of UniVG-R1,
which achieves state-of-the-art performance on MIG-Bench with a 9.1%
improvement over the previous method. Furthermore, our model exhibits strong
generalizability, achieving an average improvement of 23.4% in zero-shot
performance across four image and video reasoning grounding benchmarks. The

TL;DR: 本文提出一种简单但有效的方法，通过解耦分类头解决少样本目标检测和实例分割中的标签缺失问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因标签缺失问题导致分类偏差，本文首次正式提出并分析此问题。

Method: 将标准分类头解耦为两个独立头，分别处理清晰正样本和噪声负样本。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和MS-COCO基准测试中，模型性能显著优于基线和现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 解耦分类头能有效缓解标签缺失带来的噪声影响，提升少样本学习性能。

Abstract: This paper focus on few-shot object detection~(FSOD) and instance
segmentation~(FSIS), which requires a model to quickly adapt to novel classes
with a few labeled instances. The existing methods severely suffer from bias
classification because of the missing label issue which naturally exists in an
instance-level few-shot scenario and is first formally proposed by us. Our
analysis suggests that the standard classification head of most FSOD or FSIS
models needs to be decoupled to mitigate the bias classification. Therefore, we
propose an embarrassingly simple but effective method that decouples the
standard classifier into two heads. Then, these two individual heads are
capable of independently addressing clear positive samples and noisy negative
samples which are caused by the missing label. In this way, the model can
effectively learn novel classes while mitigating the effects of noisy negative
samples. Without bells and whistles, our model without any additional
computation cost and parameters consistently outperforms its baseline and
state-of-the-art by a large margin on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO benchmarks for
FSOD and FSIS tasks. The Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源社区在多模态代理能力（尤其是图像思维）及其基准测试方面进展不足，需填补这一空白。

Method: 采用Visual-ARFT方法，使模型具备实时信息搜索和图像处理编码能力，并设计MAT基准测试。

Result: Visual-ARFT在MAT-Coding和MAT-Search中分别提升18.6% F1/13.0% EM和10.3% F1/8.7% EM，且在多跳QA任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Visual-ARFT为构建鲁棒、通用的多模态代理提供了有效路径。

Abstract: A key trend in Large Reasoning Models (e.g., OpenAI's o3) is the native
agentic ability to use external tools such as web browsers for searching and
writing/executing code for image manipulation to think with images. In the
open-source research community, while significant progress has been made in
language-only agentic abilities such as function calling and tool integration,
the development of multi-modal agentic capabilities that involve truly thinking
with images, and their corresponding benchmarks, are still less explored. This
work highlights the effectiveness of Visual Agentic Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(Visual-ARFT) for enabling flexible and adaptive reasoning abilities for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). With Visual-ARFT, open-source LVLMs gain the
ability to browse websites for real-time information updates and write code to
manipulate and analyze input images through cropping, rotation, and other image
processing techniques. We also present a Multi-modal Agentic Tool Bench (MAT)
with two settings (MAT-Search and MAT-Coding) designed to evaluate LVLMs'
agentic search and coding abilities. Our experimental results demonstrate that
Visual-ARFT outperforms its baseline by +18.6% F1 / +13.0% EM on MAT-Coding and
+10.3% F1 / +8.7% EM on MAT-Search, ultimately surpassing GPT-4o. Visual-ARFT
also achieves +29.3 F1% / +25.9% EM gains on existing multi-hop QA benchmarks
such as 2Wiki and HotpotQA, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities.
Our findings suggest that Visual-ARFT offers a promising path toward building
robust and generalizable multimodal agents.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过优化语义嵌入和属性分类器引导文本到图像模型编辑的方法，无需依赖文本提示或模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动设计文本提示，耗时且可能引入无关细节，限制了编辑性能。

Method: 利用属性分类器优化语义嵌入，学习数据集级别的精确语义表示，实现解耦和准确编辑。

Result: 实验表明方法能实现高度解耦和跨领域数据的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需文本提示或模型训练，实现了高效、解耦的图像编辑。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for
high-quality image generation and editing. Many existing approaches rely on
text prompts as editing guidance. However, these methods are constrained by the
need for manual prompt crafting, which can be time-consuming, introduce
irrelevant details, and significantly limit editing performance. In this work,
we propose optimizing semantic embeddings guided by attribute classifiers to
steer text-to-image models toward desired edits, without relying on text
prompts or requiring any training or fine-tuning of the diffusion model. We
utilize classifiers to learn precise semantic embeddings at the dataset level.
The learned embeddings are theoretically justified as the optimal
representation of attribute semantics, enabling disentangled and accurate
edits. Experiments further demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of
disentanglement and strong generalization across different domains of data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过优化注意力分布与信息流的对齐，提升LVLMs的视觉理解能力，显著减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于Decoder-Only模型的单向掩码机制，视觉信息在传播过程中逐渐融入语义表征，但注意力分布与信息流不匹配，导致模型视觉理解能力受限和幻觉现象。

Method: 识别关注核心语义表征的注意力头，通过两阶段优化范式将这些头的优势传播到整个模型，使注意力分布与信息流对齐。

Result: 在五个LVLMs和三个图像描述基准测试中，方法显著减少了幻觉现象，并允许手动调整模型的保守性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LVLMs的视觉理解能力，减少了幻觉，同时提供了灵活性以满足实际需求。

Abstract: Due to the unidirectional masking mechanism, Decoder-Only models propagate
information from left to right. LVLMs (Large Vision-Language Models) follow the
same architecture, with visual information gradually integrated into semantic
representations during forward propagation. Through systematic analysis, we
observe that over 80\% of the visual information is absorbed into the semantic
representations. However, the model's attention still predominantly focuses on
the visual representations. This misalignment between the attention
distribution and the actual information flow undermines the model's visual
understanding ability and contributes to hallucinations. To address this issue,
we enhance the model's visual understanding by leveraging the core information
embedded in semantic representations. Specifically, we identify attention heads
that focus on core semantic representations based on their attention
distributions. Then, through a two-stage optimization paradigm, we propagate
the advantages of these attention heads across the entire model, aligning the
attention distribution with the actual information flow. We evaluate our method
on three image captioning benchmarks using five different LVLMs, demonstrating
its effectiveness in significantly reducing hallucinations. Further experiments
reveal a trade-off between reduced hallucinations and richer details. Notably,
our method allows for manual adjustment of the model's conservativeness,
enabling flexible control to meet diverse real-world requirements. Code will be
released once accepted.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法在多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中无法达到与单模态大语言模型（LLMs）相同的加速效果，因此需要针对MLLMs重新设计推测解码方法。

Method: MSD通过分离处理文本和视觉标记，并采用两阶段训练策略（先文本指令调优，后逐步引入多模态数据）优化草案模型的语言建模和视觉感知能力。

Result: 实验显示，MSD在LLaVA-1.5-7B和LLaVA-1.5-13B上分别实现了最高2.29倍和2.46倍的推理加速。

Conclusion: MSD有效提升了MLLMs的推理速度，同时保持了准确性，为多模态模型的高效推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces Multimodal Speculative Decoding (MSD) to accelerate
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) inference. Speculative decoding has
been shown to accelerate Large Language Models (LLMs) without sacrificing
accuracy. However, current speculative decoding methods for MLLMs fail to
achieve the same speedup as they do for LLMs. To address this, we reimagine
speculative decoding specifically for MLLMs. Our analysis of MLLM
characteristics reveals two key design principles for MSD: (1) Text and visual
tokens have fundamentally different characteristics and need to be processed
separately during drafting. (2) Both language modeling ability and visual
perception capability are crucial for the draft model. For the first principle,
MSD decouples text and visual tokens in the draft model, allowing each to be
handled based on its own characteristics. For the second principle, MSD uses a
two-stage training strategy: In stage one, the draft model is trained on
text-only instruction-tuning datasets to improve its language modeling ability.
In stage two, MSD gradually introduces multimodal data to enhance the visual
perception capability of the draft model. Experiments show that MSD boosts
inference speed by up to $2.29\times$ for LLaVA-1.5-7B and up to $2.46\times$
for LLaVA-1.5-13B on multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

Conclusion: RA-Touch证明了通过视觉数据间接理解触觉的可行性，为触觉感知领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visuo-tactile perception aims to understand an object's tactile properties,
such as texture, softness, and rigidity. However, the field remains
underexplored because collecting tactile data is costly and labor-intensive. We
observe that visually distinct objects can exhibit similar surface textures or
material properties. For example, a leather sofa and a leather jacket have
different appearances but share similar tactile properties. This implies that
tactile understanding can be guided by material cues in visual data, even
without direct tactile supervision. In this paper, we introduce RA-Touch, a
retrieval-augmented framework that improves visuo-tactile perception by
leveraging visual data enriched with tactile semantics. We carefully recaption
a large-scale visual dataset with tactile-focused descriptions, enabling the
model to access tactile semantics typically absent from conventional visual
datasets. A key challenge remains in effectively utilizing these tactile-aware
external descriptions. RA-Touch addresses this by retrieving visual-textual
representations aligned with tactile inputs and integrating them to focus on
relevant textural and material properties. By outperforming prior methods on
the TVL benchmark, our method demonstrates the potential of retrieval-based
visual reuse for tactile understanding. Code is available at

Motivation: 探索如何利用合成图像生成逼真的水下图像，解决水下图像生成中的光照和结构问题。

Method: 使用VAROS数据集，比较了pix2pix、CycleGAN、CUT等模型，并评估了FID和SSIM指标。

Result: pix2pix在FID上表现最佳，CUT在SSIM上表现更好，结合深度信息的CUT实现了最低FID。

Conclusion: 深度信息能提升图像真实性，但可能影响结构保真度；不同模型在感知质量和结构保留上有权衡。

Abstract: This paper explores the use of contrastive learning and generative
adversarial networks for generating realistic underwater images from synthetic
images with uniform lighting. We investigate the performance of image
translation models for generating realistic underwater images using the VAROS
dataset. Two key evaluation metrics, Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) and
Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), provide insights into the
trade-offs between perceptual quality and structural preservation. For paired
image translation, pix2pix achieves the best FID scores due to its paired
supervision and PatchGAN discriminator, while the autoencoder model attains the
highest SSIM, suggesting better structural fidelity despite producing blurrier
outputs. Among unpaired methods, CycleGAN achieves a competitive FID score by
leveraging cycle-consistency loss, whereas CUT, which replaces
cycle-consistency with contrastive learning, attains higher SSIM, indicating
improved spatial similarity retention. Notably, incorporating depth information
into CUT results in the lowest overall FID score, demonstrating that depth cues
enhance realism. However, the slight decrease in SSIM suggests that depth-aware
learning may introduce structural variations.

Conclusion: RADAR通过系统整合内部和外部知识，显著提升了放射学报告生成的效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various domains, including radiology report generation. Previous approaches
have attempted to utilize multimodal LLMs for this task, enhancing their
performance through the integration of domain-specific knowledge retrieval.
However, these approaches often overlook the knowledge already embedded within
the LLMs, leading to redundant information integration and inefficient
utilization of learned representations. To address this limitation, we propose
RADAR, a framework for enhancing radiology report generation with supplementary
knowledge injection. RADAR improves report generation by systematically
leveraging both the internal knowledge of an LLM and externally retrieved
information. Specifically, it first extracts the model's acquired knowledge
that aligns with expert image-based classification outputs. It then retrieves
relevant supplementary knowledge to further enrich this information. Finally,
by aggregating both sources, RADAR generates more accurate and informative
radiology reports. Extensive experiments on MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert-Plus, and IU
X-ray demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs in both
language quality and clinical accuracy

Abstract: Tactile perception is profoundly influenced by the surface properties of
objects in contact. However, despite their crucial role in shaping tactile
experiences, these material characteristics have been largely neglected in
existing tactile representation learning methods. Most approaches primarily
focus on aligning tactile data with visual or textual information, overlooking
the richness of tactile feedback that comes from understanding the materials'
inherent properties. In this work, we address this gap by revisiting the
tactile representation learning framework and incorporating material-aware
priors into the learning process. These priors, which represent pre-learned
characteristics specific to different materials, allow tactile models to better
capture and generalize the nuances of surface texture. Our method enables more
accurate, contextually rich tactile feedback across diverse materials and
textures, improving performance in real-world applications such as robotics,
haptic feedback systems, and material editing.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了图像质量退化对FRT准确性和公平性的影响，发现错误率在女性及黑人群体中更高，但FRT仍优于传统法医方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估FRT在现实执法场景中的表现，关注图像质量退化对准确性和公平性的影响。

Method: 使用StyleGAN3生成合成人脸，模拟五种图像退化形式，通过Deepface和ArcFace损失评估1:n识别任务。

Result: 错误率在女性及黑人群体中更高，尤其是黑人女性；FRT在极端条件下仍优于传统方法。

Conclusion: FRT需验证和监管以确保公平性，同时需关注实际使用中的透明度和监督。

Abstract: Facial recognition technology (FRT) is increasingly used in criminal
investigations, yet most evaluations of its accuracy rely on high-quality
images, unlike those often encountered by law enforcement. This study examines
how five common forms of image degradation--contrast, brightness, motion blur,
pose shift, and resolution--affect FRT accuracy and fairness across demographic
groups. Using synthetic faces generated by StyleGAN3 and labeled with FairFace,
we simulate degraded images and evaluate performance using Deepface with
ArcFace loss in 1:n identification tasks. We perform an experiment and find
that false positive rates peak near baseline image quality, while false
negatives increase as degradation intensifies--especially with blur and low
resolution. Error rates are consistently higher for women and Black
individuals, with Black females most affected. These disparities raise concerns
about fairness and reliability when FRT is used in real-world investigative
contexts. Nevertheless, even under the most challenging conditions and for the
most affected subgroups, FRT accuracy remains substantially higher than that of
many traditional forensic methods. This suggests that, if appropriately
validated and regulated, FRT should be considered a valuable investigative
tool. However, algorithmic accuracy alone is not sufficient: we must also
evaluate how FRT is used in practice, including user-driven data manipulation.
Such cases underscore the need for transparency and oversight in FRT deployment
to ensure both fairness and forensic validity.

TL;DR: VBenchComp是一个自动化工具，用于分类视频理解问题，以更精确评估视频LLM的能力。

Result: 揭示了传统评分掩盖的模型弱点，为未来基准设计提供建议。

Conclusion: VBenchComp能更准确地评估视频LLM的不同能力。

Abstract: Existing video understanding benchmarks often conflate knowledge-based and
purely image-based questions, rather than clearly isolating a model's temporal
reasoning ability, which is the key aspect that distinguishes video
understanding from other modalities. We identify two major limitations that
obscure whether higher scores truly indicate stronger understanding of the
dynamic content in videos: (1) strong language priors, where models can answer
questions without watching the video; and (2) shuffling invariance, where
models maintain similar performance on certain questions even when video frames
are temporally shuffled. To alleviate these issues, we propose VBenchComp, an
automated pipeline that categorizes questions into different domains:
LLM-Answerable, Semantic, and Temporal. Specifically, LLM-Answerable questions
can be answered without viewing the video; Semantic questions remain answerable
even when the video frames are shuffled; and Temporal questions require
understanding the correct temporal order of frames. The rest of the questions
are labeled as Others. This can enable fine-grained evaluation of different
capabilities of a video LLM. Our analysis reveals nuanced model weaknesses that
are hidden by traditional overall scores, and we offer insights and
recommendations for designing future benchmarks that more accurately assess
video LLMs.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper introduces a discriminator-free adversarial-based approach termed
DDA-MLIC for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in the context of Multi-Label
Image Classification (MLIC). While recent efforts have explored
adversarial-based UDA methods for MLIC, they typically include an additional
discriminator subnet. Nevertheless, decoupling the classification and the
discrimination tasks may harm their task-specific discriminative power. Herein,
we address this challenge by presenting a novel adversarial critic directly
derived from the task-specific classifier. Specifically, we employ a
two-component Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model both source and target
predictions, distinguishing between two distinct clusters. Instead of using the
traditional Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, our approach utilizes a
Deep Neural Network (DNN) to estimate the parameters of each GMM component.
Subsequently, the source and target GMM parameters are leveraged to formulate
an adversarial loss using the Fr\'echet distance. The proposed framework is
therefore not only fully differentiable but is also cost-effective as it avoids
the expensive iterative process usually induced by the standard EM method. The
proposed method is evaluated on several multi-label image datasets covering
three different types of domain shift. The obtained results demonstrate that
DDA-MLIC outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of precision
while requiring a lower number of parameters. The code is made publicly
available at github.com/cvi2snt/DDA-MLIC.

Abstract: Plane geometry problem solving (PGPS) has recently gained significant
attention as a benchmark to assess the multi-modal reasoning capabilities of
large vision-language models. Despite the growing interest in PGPS, the
research community still lacks a comprehensive overview that systematically
synthesizes recent work in PGPS. To fill this gap, we present a survey of
existing PGPS studies. We first categorize PGPS methods into an encoder-decoder
framework and summarize the corresponding output formats used by their encoders
and decoders. Subsequently, we classify and analyze these encoders and decoders
according to their architectural designs. Finally, we outline major challenges
and promising directions for future research. In particular, we discuss the
hallucination issues arising during the encoding phase within encoder-decoder
architectures, as well as the problem of data leakage in current PGPS
benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，该方法能显著提升反事实T2I生成中的概念对齐效果。

Conclusion: 提出的策略有效提升了反事实T2I生成的概念对齐，为更灵活的AIGC体验提供了支持。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) has been prevalent in recent years, with most common
condition tasks having been optimized nicely. Besides, counterfactual
Text-to-Image is obstructing us from a more versatile AIGC experience. For
those scenes that are impossible to happen in real world and anti-physics, we
should spare no efforts in increasing the factual feel, which means
synthesizing images that people think very likely to be happening, and concept
alignment, which means all the required objects should be in the same frame. In
this paper, we focus on concept alignment. As controllable T2I models have
achieved satisfactory performance for real applications, we utilize this
technology to replace the objects in a synthesized image in latent space
step-by-step to change the image from a common scene to a counterfactual scene
to meet the prompt. We propose a strategy to instruct this replacing process,
which is called as Explicit Logical Narrative Prompt (ELNP), by using the newly
SoTA language model DeepSeek to generate the instructions. Furthermore, to
evaluate models' performance in counterfactual T2I, we design a metric to
calculate how many required concepts in the prompt can be covered averagely in
the synthesized images. The extensive experiments and qualitative comparisons
demonstrate that our strategy can boost the concept alignment in counterfactual
T2I.

Motivation: 由于IMU传感器噪声导致轨迹漂移，以及人类动作多样性增加信号处理难度，传统惯性定位面临挑战。但某些动作与空间环境结构相关，可作为空间锚点补偿漂移。

Method: EAIL通过分层多模态对齐学习动作与环境特征的关联，利用对比学习训练模态编码器，将IMU信号中的动作线索与点云中的局部特征对齐。

Result: 实验表明，EAIL在惯性定位和动作识别基准上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EAIL不仅有效解决了惯性定位问题，还能作为副产品识别动作序列。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel inertial localization framework named Egocentric
Action-aware Inertial Localization (EAIL), which leverages egocentric action
cues from head-mounted IMU signals to localize the target individual within a
3D point cloud. Human inertial localization is challenging due to IMU sensor
noise that causes trajectory drift over time. The diversity of human actions
further complicates IMU signal processing by introducing various motion
patterns. Nevertheless, we observe that some actions observed through the
head-mounted IMU correlate with spatial environmental structures (e.g., bending
down to look inside an oven, washing dishes next to a sink), thereby serving as
spatial anchors to compensate for the localization drift. The proposed EAIL
framework learns such correlations via hierarchical multi-modal alignment. By
assuming that the 3D point cloud of the environment is available, it
contrastively learns modality encoders that align short-term egocentric action
cues in IMU signals with local environmental features in the point cloud. These
encoders are then used in reasoning the IMU data and the point cloud over time
and space to perform inertial localization. Interestingly, these encoders can
further be utilized to recognize the corresponding sequence of actions as a
by-product. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
framework over state-of-the-art inertial localization and inertial action
recognition baselines.

Conclusion: Vid2World为将视频扩散模型转化为交互式世界模型提供了有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: World models, which predict transitions based on history observation and
action sequences, have shown great promise in improving data efficiency for
sequential decision making. However, existing world models often require
extensive domain-specific training and still produce low-fidelity, coarse
predictions, limiting their applicability in complex environments. In contrast,
video diffusion models trained on large, internet-scale datasets have
demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating high-quality videos that
capture diverse real-world dynamics. In this work, we present Vid2World, a
general approach for leveraging and transferring pre-trained video diffusion
models into interactive world models. To bridge the gap, Vid2World performs
casualization of a pre-trained video diffusion model by crafting its
architecture and training objective to enable autoregressive generation.
Furthermore, it introduces a causal action guidance mechanism to enhance action
controllability in the resulting interactive world model. Extensive experiments
in robot manipulation and game simulation domains show that our method offers a
scalable and effective approach for repurposing highly capable video diffusion
models to interactive world models.

Motivation: 现有检测器在偏置数据集上训练容易过拟合非因果图像属性，导致在无偏数据集上性能下降。传统像素级对齐方法不足以解决频率级不对齐问题。

Result: 在DDA对齐的MSCOCO上训练的检测器在8个多样化基准上性能提升，尤其在野外基准上提高7.2%。

Conclusion: DDA方法有效解决了频率级不对齐问题，显著提升了检测器的泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing detectors are often trained on biased datasets, leading to the
possibility of overfitting on non-causal image attributes that are spuriously
correlated with real/synthetic labels. While these biased features enhance
performance on the training data, they result in substantial performance
degradation when applied to unbiased datasets. One common solution is to
perform dataset alignment through generative reconstruction, matching the
semantic content between real and synthetic images. However, we revisit this
approach and show that pixel-level alignment alone is insufficient. The
reconstructed images still suffer from frequency-level misalignment, which can
perpetuate spurious correlations. To illustrate, we observe that reconstruction
models tend to restore the high-frequency details lost in real images (possibly
due to JPEG compression), inadvertently creating a frequency-level
misalignment, where synthetic images appear to have richer high-frequency
content than real ones. This misalignment leads to models associating
high-frequency features with synthetic labels, further reinforcing biased cues.
To resolve this, we propose Dual Data Alignment (DDA), which aligns both the
pixel and frequency domains. Moreover, we introduce two new test sets:
DDA-COCO, containing DDA-aligned synthetic images for testing detector
performance on the most aligned dataset, and EvalGEN, featuring the latest
generative models for assessing detectors under new generative architectures
such as visual auto-regressive generators. Finally, our extensive evaluations
demonstrate that a detector trained exclusively on DDA-aligned MSCOCO could
improve across 8 diverse benchmarks by a non-trivial margin, showing a +7.2% on
in-the-wild benchmarks, highlighting the improved generalizability of unbiased
detectors.

Conclusion: VLM在遥感领域潜力巨大，未来需关注模型能力扩展和多模态数据集开发。

Abstract: Vision-language modeling (VLM) aims to bridge the information gap between
images and natural language. Under the new paradigm of first pre-training on
massive image-text pairs and then fine-tuning on task-specific data, VLM in the
remote sensing domain has made significant progress. The resulting models
benefit from the absorption of extensive general knowledge and demonstrate
strong performance across a variety of remote sensing data analysis tasks.
Moreover, they are capable of interacting with users in a conversational
manner. In this paper, we aim to provide the remote sensing community with a
timely and comprehensive review of the developments in VLM using the two-stage
paradigm. Specifically, we first cover a taxonomy of VLM in remote sensing:
contrastive learning, visual instruction tuning, and text-conditioned image
generation. For each category, we detail the commonly used network architecture
and pre-training objectives. Second, we conduct a thorough review of existing
works, examining foundation models and task-specific adaptation methods in
contrastive-based VLM, architectural upgrades, training strategies and model
capabilities in instruction-based VLM, as well as generative foundation models
with their representative downstream applications. Third, we summarize datasets
used for VLM pre-training, fine-tuning, and evaluation, with an analysis of
their construction methodologies (including image sources and caption
generation) and key properties, such as scale and task adaptability. Finally,
we conclude this survey with insights and discussions on future research
directions: cross-modal representation alignment, vague requirement
comprehension, explanation-driven model reliability, continually scalable model
capabilities, and large-scale datasets featuring richer modalities and greater
challenges.

Result: DeepEyes在细粒度感知、推理任务中表现显著提升，同时改善了基础能力、幻觉和数学推理。

Conclusion: DeepEyes展示了视觉推理能力的自然涌现，工具调用行为逐步优化，更接近人类视觉推理模式。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet they are primarily constrained by
text-based reasoning processes. However, achieving seamless integration of
visual and textual reasoning which mirrors human cognitive processes remains a
significant challenge. In particular, effectively incorporating advanced visual
input processing into reasoning mechanisms is still an open question. Thus, in
this paper, we explore the interleaved multimodal reasoning paradigm and
introduce DeepEyes, a model with "thinking with images" capabilities
incentivized through end-to-end reinforcement learning without the need for
cold-start SFT. Notably, this ability emerges natively within the model itself,
leveraging its inherent grounding ability as a tool instead of depending on
separate specialized models. Specifically, we propose a tool-use-oriented data
selection mechanism and a reward strategy to encourage successful tool-assisted
reasoning trajectories. DeepEyes achieves significant performance gains on
fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks and also demonstrates
improvement in grounding, hallucination, and mathematical reasoning tasks.
Interestingly, we observe the distinct evolution of tool-calling behavior from
initial exploration to efficient and accurate exploitation, and diverse
thinking patterns that closely mirror human visual reasoning processes. Code is

Result: 对18个先进MLLMs的评估揭示了其VI-CoT能力的关键见解。

Conclusion: ViC-Bench为系统评估VI-CoT能力提供了新工具，并揭示了IVS对推理性能的影响。

Abstract: Visual-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (VI-CoT) enables MLLMs to continually
update their understanding and decisions based on step-wise intermediate visual
states (IVS), much like a human would, which demonstrates impressive success in
various tasks, thereby leading to emerged advancements in related benchmarks.
Despite promising progress, current benchmarks provide models with relatively
fixed IVS, rather than free-style IVS, whch might forcibly distort the original
thinking trajectories, failing to evaluate their intrinsic reasoning
capabilities. More importantly, existing benchmarks neglect to systematically
explore the impact factors that IVS would impart to untamed reasoning
performance. To tackle above gaps, we introduce a specialized benchmark termed
ViC-Bench, consisting of four representive tasks: maze navigation, jigsaw
puzzle, embodied long-horizon planning, and complex counting, where each task
has dedicated free-style IVS generation pipeline supporting function calls. To
systematically examine VI-CoT capability, we propose a thorough evaluation
suite incorporating a progressive three-stage strategy with targeted new
metrics. Besides, we establish Incremental Prompting Information Injection
(IPII) strategy to ablatively explore the prompting factors for VI-CoT. We
extensively conduct evaluations for 18 advanced MLLMs, revealing key insights
into their VI-CoT capability. Our proposed benchmark is publicly open at

Conclusion: 论文揭示了LMMs在时间分析中的鲁棒性问题，并提出PanoDPO方法有效解决了这一问题，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
performance on general video comprehension benchmarks. Nevertheless, for
broader applications, the robustness of their temporal analysis capability
needs to be thoroughly investigated yet predominantly ignored. Motivated by
this, we propose a novel temporal robustness benchmark (TemRobBench), which
introduces temporal inconsistency perturbations separately at the visual and
textual modalities to assess the robustness of models. We evaluate 16
mainstream LMMs and find that they exhibit over-reliance on prior knowledge and
textual context in adversarial environments, while ignoring the actual temporal
dynamics in the video. To mitigate this issue, we design panoramic direct
preference optimization (PanoDPO), which encourages LMMs to incorporate both
visual and linguistic feature preferences simultaneously. Experimental results
show that PanoDPO can effectively enhance the model's robustness and
reliability in temporal analysis.

Motivation: 立体匹配在遮挡和非朗伯表面等不适定区域表现不佳，而现有的单目先验由于数据集的限制泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出二进制局部排序图统一相对和绝对深度表示，并通过像素级线性回归模块全局自适应对齐单目深度和视差。

Conclusion: 该方法有效且高效地利用了单目先验，显著提升了立体匹配在不适定区域的性能。

Abstract: The matching formulation makes it naturally hard for the stereo matching to
handle ill-posed regions like occlusions and non-Lambertian surfaces. Fusing
monocular priors has been proven helpful for ill-posed matching, but the biased
monocular prior learned from small stereo datasets constrains the
generalization. Recently, stereo matching has progressed by leveraging the
unbiased monocular prior from the vision foundation model (VFM) to improve the
generalization in ill-posed regions. We dive into the fusion process and
observe three main problems limiting the fusion of the VFM monocular prior. The
first problem is the misalignment between affine-invariant relative monocular
depth and absolute depth of disparity. Besides, when we use the monocular
feature in an iterative update structure, the over-confidence in the disparity
update leads to local optima results. A direct fusion of a monocular depth map
could alleviate the local optima problem, but noisy disparity results computed
at the first several iterations will misguide the fusion. In this paper, we
propose a binary local ordering map to guide the fusion, which converts the
depth map into a binary relative format, unifying the relative and absolute
depth representation. The computed local ordering map is also used to re-weight
the initial disparity update, resolving the local optima and noisy problem. In
addition, we formulate the final direct fusion of monocular depth to the
disparity as a registration problem, where a pixel-wise linear regression
module can globally and adaptively align them. Our method fully exploits the
monocular prior to support stereo matching results effectively and efficiently.
We significantly improve the performance from the experiments when generalizing
from SceneFlow to Middlebury and Booster datasets while barely reducing the
efficiency.

Conclusion: VidCom2不仅高效且兼容其他压缩方法，为视频大语言模型的推理加速提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Video large language models (VideoLLM) excel at video understanding, but face
efficiency challenges due to the quadratic complexity of abundant visual
tokens. Our systematic analysis of token compression methods for VideoLLMs
reveals two critical issues: (i) overlooking distinctive visual signals across
frames, leading to information loss; (ii) suffering from implementation
constraints, causing incompatibility with modern architectures or efficient
operators. To address these challenges, we distill three design principles for
VideoLLM token compression and propose a plug-and-play inference acceleration
framework "Video Compression Commander" (VidCom2). By quantifying each frame's
uniqueness, VidCom2 adaptively adjusts compression intensity across frames,
effectively preserving essential information while reducing redundancy in video
sequences. Extensive experiments across various VideoLLMs and benchmarks
demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our VidCom2. With only
25% visual tokens, VidCom2 achieves 99.6% of the original performance on
LLaVA-OV while reducing 70.8% of the LLM generation latency. Notably, our Frame
Compression Adjustment strategy is compatible with other token compression
methods to further improve their performance. Our code is available at

TL;DR: VisualQuality-R1是一种基于强化学习的无参考图像质量评估模型，通过推理和相对排名优化，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索推理驱动的计算模型在图像质量评估（IQA）中的潜力，解决现有方法在视觉推理和相对质量评估上的不足。

Method: 使用强化学习（特别是组相对策略优化）和Thurstone模型，生成多质量分数并计算比较概率，奖励基于连续保真度度量。

Result: VisualQuality-R1在性能上优于现有NR-IQA模型，并能生成与人类对齐的质量描述，支持多数据集训练。

Conclusion: VisualQuality-R1在图像处理任务中具有广泛适用性，尤其在超分辨率和图像生成领域表现突出。

Abstract: DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in incentivizing
reasoning and generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
through reinforcement learning. Nevertheless, the potential of
reasoning-induced computational modeling has not been thoroughly explored in
the context of image quality assessment (IQA), a task critically dependent on
visual reasoning. In this paper, we introduce VisualQuality-R1, a
reasoning-induced no-reference IQA (NR-IQA) model, and we train it with
reinforcement learning to rank, a learning algorithm tailored to the
intrinsically relative nature of visual quality. Specifically, for a pair of
images, we employ group relative policy optimization to generate multiple
quality scores for each image. These estimates are then used to compute
comparative probabilities of one image having higher quality than the other
under the Thurstone model. Rewards for each quality estimate are defined using
continuous fidelity measures rather than discretized binary labels. Extensive
experiments show that the proposed VisualQuality-R1 consistently outperforms
discriminative deep learning-based NR-IQA models as well as a recent
reasoning-induced quality regression method. Moreover, VisualQuality-R1 is
capable of generating contextually rich, human-aligned quality descriptions,
and supports multi-dataset training without requiring perceptual scale
realignment. These features make VisualQuality-R1 especially well-suited for
reliably measuring progress in a wide range of image processing tasks like
super-resolution and image generation.

TL;DR: RAVENEA是一个新基准，通过检索增强视觉文化理解，提升轻量级VLM在文化相关任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在文化细微差别理解上表现不足，检索增强生成在文本场景中有效，但在多模态场景中未充分探索。

Method: 引入RAVENEA基准，整合10,000+维基百科文档，训练并评估七种多模态检索器，测试其对14种VLM的影响。

Result: 检索增强的轻量级VLM在文化视觉问答和图像描述任务中表现显著提升（cVQA提升3.2%，cIC提升6.2%）。

Conclusion: 检索增强方法和文化包容性基准对多模态理解具有重要价值。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, the need for accurate visual culture understanding is becoming critical.
Yet, these models frequently fall short in interpreting cultural nuances
effectively. Prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in enhancing cultural understanding in
text-only settings, while its application in multimodal scenarios remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce RAVENEA (Retrieval-Augmented
Visual culturE uNdErstAnding), a new benchmark designed to advance visual
culture understanding through retrieval, focusing on two tasks: culture-focused
visual question answering (cVQA) and culture-informed image captioning (cIC).
RAVENEA extends existing datasets by integrating over 10,000 Wikipedia
documents curated and ranked by human annotators. With RAVENEA, we train and
evaluate seven multimodal retrievers for each image query, and measure the
downstream impact of retrieval-augmented inputs across fourteen
state-of-the-art VLMs. Our results show that lightweight VLMs, when augmented
with culture-aware retrieval, outperform their non-augmented counterparts (by
at least 3.2% absolute on cVQA and 6.2% absolute on cIC). This highlights the
value of retrieval-augmented methods and culturally inclusive benchmarks for
multimodal understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新方法，通过确保同类样本在潜在空间中共享相似的活动维度，增强VAEs潜在空间的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准VAEs生成的潜在空间分散且无结构，限制了其可解释性；VSC虽引入稀疏表示，但未解决同类样本间活动维度一致性问题。

Method: 引入新的损失函数，鼓励同类样本共享相似的活动维度，从而构建更结构化的潜在空间。

Result: 潜在空间更具结构和可解释性，每个共享维度对应一个高级概念（“因子”），同时捕捉全局和类特定因子。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了潜在空间的实用性和可解释性，优于现有解缠方法。

Abstract: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models for learning
latent representations. Standard VAEs generate dispersed and unstructured
latent spaces by utilizing all dimensions, which limits their interpretability,
especially in high-dimensional spaces. To address this challenge, Variational
Sparse Coding (VSC) introduces a spike-and-slab prior distribution, resulting
in sparse latent representations for each input. These sparse representations,
characterized by a limited number of active dimensions, are inherently more
interpretable. Despite this advantage, VSC falls short in providing structured
interpretations across samples within the same class. Intuitively, samples from
the same class are expected to share similar attributes while allowing for
variations in those attributes. This expectation should manifest as consistent
patterns of active dimensions in their latent representations, but VSC does not
enforce such consistency.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to enhance the latent space
interpretability by ensuring that the active dimensions in the latent space are
consistent across samples within the same class. To achieve this, we introduce
a new loss function that encourages samples from the same class to share
similar active dimensions. This alignment creates a more structured and
interpretable latent space, where each shared dimension corresponds to a
high-level concept, or "factor." Unlike existing disentanglement-based methods
that primarily focus on global factors shared across all classes, our method
captures both global and class-specific factors, thereby enhancing the utility
and interpretability of latent representations.

TL;DR: ReservoirTTA是一种新型插件框架，用于持续变化的测试领域，通过多模型策略解决单模型适应的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决测试领域持续变化时单模型适应的问题，如灾难性遗忘和领域间干扰。

Method: 使用域专用模型库，通过在线聚类检测新领域并路由样本，实现域特定适应。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著提高适应准确性并保持稳定性能。

Conclusion: ReservoirTTA在多领域持续变化场景中优于现有方法，提供稳定且鲁棒的适应性能。

Abstract: This paper introduces ReservoirTTA, a novel plug-in framework designed for
prolonged test-time adaptation (TTA) in scenarios where the test domain
continuously shifts over time, including cases where domains recur or evolve
gradually. At its core, ReservoirTTA maintains a reservoir of
domain-specialized models -- an adaptive test-time model ensemble -- that both
detects new domains via online clustering over style features of incoming
samples and routes each sample to the appropriate specialized model, and
thereby enables domain-specific adaptation. This multi-model strategy overcomes
key limitations of single model adaptation, such as catastrophic forgetting,
inter-domain interference, and error accumulation, ensuring robust and stable
performance on sustained non-stationary test distributions. Our theoretical
analysis reveals key components that bound parameter variance and prevent model
collapse, while our plug-in TTA module mitigates catastrophic forgetting of
previously encountered domains. Extensive experiments on the classification
corruption benchmarks, including ImageNet-C and CIFAR-10/100-C, as well as the
Cityscapes$\rightarrow$ACDC semantic segmentation task, covering recurring and
continuously evolving domain shifts, demonstrate that ReservoirTTA
significantly improves adaptation accuracy and maintains stable performance
across prolonged, recurring shifts, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparC框架通过稀疏变形立方体表示和新型编码器SparConv-VAE，解决了3D对象合成中的细节丢失问题，实现了高效、高保真的3D重建与生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D对象合成方法因网格数据非结构化和体积网格立方复杂度，导致细节丢失和效率低下。

Method: 结合稀疏变形立方体表示SparseCubes和稀疏卷积网络编码器SparConv-VAE，实现高分辨率3D重建。

Result: SparC在复杂输入（如开放表面、断开组件）上实现最先进的重建保真度，保留细节并降低成本。

Conclusion: SparC为高分辨率3D生成提供了可扩展的解决方案，适用于潜在扩散模型。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D object synthesis remains significantly more challenging than
2D image generation due to the unstructured nature of mesh data and the cubic
complexity of dense volumetric grids. Existing two-stage pipelines-compressing
meshes with a VAE (using either 2D or 3D supervision), followed by latent
diffusion sampling-often suffer from severe detail loss caused by inefficient
representations and modality mismatches introduced in VAE. We introduce SparC,
a unified framework that combines a sparse deformable marching cubes
representation SparseCubes with a novel encoder SparConv-VAE. SparseCubes
converts raw meshes into high-resolution ($1024^3$) surfaces with arbitrary
topology by scattering signed distance and deformation fields onto a sparse
cube, allowing differentiable optimization. SparConv-VAE is the first
modality-consistent variational autoencoder built entirely upon sparse
convolutional networks, enabling efficient and near-lossless 3D reconstruction
suitable for high-resolution generative modeling through latent diffusion.
SparC achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity on challenging inputs,
including open surfaces, disconnected components, and intricate geometry. It
preserves fine-grained shape details, reduces training and inference cost, and
integrates naturally with latent diffusion models for scalable, high-resolution
3D generation.

Motivation: 现有无参考去合成方法受限于训练和测试数据的分布假设，限制了实用性。

Method: 采用扩散模型，从合成生成的人脸图像训练，测试于真实合成图像。

Result: 在六个数据集和两种人脸匹配器上验证，性能优于现有技术≥59.46%。

Conclusion: 该方法在跨技术和风格的去合成任务中表现出高效性和实用性。

Abstract: A face morph is created by combining two (or more) face images corresponding
to two (or more) identities to produce a composite that successfully matches
the constituent identities. Reference-free (RF) demorphing reverses this
process using only the morph image, without the need for additional reference
images. Previous RF demorphing methods were overly constrained, as they rely on
assumptions about the distributions of training and testing morphs such as the
morphing technique used, face style, and images used to create the morph. In
this paper, we introduce a novel diffusion-based approach that effectively
disentangles component images from a composite morph image with high visual
fidelity. Our method is the first to generalize across morph techniques and
face styles, beating the current state of the art by $\geq 59.46\%$ under a
common training protocol across all datasets tested. We train our method on
morphs created using synthetically generated face images and test on real
morphs, thereby enhancing the practicality of the technique. Experiments on six
datasets and two face matchers establish the utility and efficacy of our
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在单张图像条件下难以扩展参考信息，导致视角偏差和多视角一致性不足。

Method: 结合预训练图像到3D生成和迭代LoRA微调，通过几何线索引导生成多视角一致的指导图像和3DGS输出。

Result: 实验表明，CP-GS有效减轻了视角偏差，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CP-GS通过渐进式传播参考信息，实现了高质量的多视角一致性3D个性化。

Abstract: Personalizing 3D scenes from a single reference image enables intuitive
user-guided editing, which requires achieving both multi-view consistency
across perspectives and referential consistency with the input image. However,
these goals are particularly challenging due to the viewpoint bias caused by
the limited perspective provided in a single image. Lacking the mechanisms to
effectively expand reference information beyond the original view, existing
methods of image-conditioned 3DGS personalization often suffer from this
viewpoint bias and struggle to produce consistent results. Therefore, in this
paper, we present Consistent Personalization for 3D Gaussian Splatting (CP-GS),
a framework that progressively propagates the single-view reference appearance
to novel perspectives. In particular, CP-GS integrates pre-trained image-to-3D
generation and iterative LoRA fine-tuning to extract and extend the reference
appearance, and finally produces faithful multi-view guidance images and the
personalized 3DGS outputs through a view-consistent generation process guided
by geometric cues. Extensive experiments on real-world scenes show that our
CP-GS effectively mitigates the viewpoint bias, achieving high-quality
personalization that significantly outperforms existing methods. The code will
be released at https://github.com/Yuxuan-W/CP-GS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前脑图像解码方法依赖复杂的多阶段流程，且通常忽略时间维度，限制了时间分辨率。

Method: 提出Dynadiff模型，一种单阶段扩散模型，直接处理动态fMRI信号。

Result: 在时间分辨fMRI信号上表现优异，语义图像重建指标优于现有方法，同时在传统预处理数据上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: Dynadiff为时间分辨脑图像解码奠定了基础。

Abstract: Brain-to-image decoding has been recently propelled by the progress in
generative AI models and the availability of large ultra-high field functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). However, current approaches depend on
complicated multi-stage pipelines and preprocessing steps that typically
collapse the temporal dimension of brain recordings, thereby limiting
time-resolved brain decoders. Here, we introduce Dynadiff (Dynamic Neural
Activity Diffusion for Image Reconstruction), a new single-stage diffusion
model designed for reconstructing images from dynamically evolving fMRI
recordings. Our approach offers three main contributions. First, Dynadiff
simplifies training as compared to existing approaches. Second, our model
outperforms state-of-the-art models on time-resolved fMRI signals, especially
on high-level semantic image reconstruction metrics, while remaining
competitive on preprocessed fMRI data that collapse time. Third, this approach
allows a precise characterization of the evolution of image representations in
brain activity. Overall, this work lays the foundation for time-resolved
brain-to-image decoding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SGPN在实例分割中使用内存密集的相似性矩阵，导致内存占用随点数平方增长，亟需改进。

Method: 采用两种采样方法：在子采样点集上计算实例分割，再通过最近邻方法将标签扩展到完整点集。

Result: 两种方法在大子采样集上表现相当，但随机采样策略在速度和内存使用上提升最显著。

Conclusion: 随机采样策略是解决SGPN内存问题的有效方法，尤其适合大规模点集。

Abstract: Recently proposed neural network architectures like PointNet [QSMG16] and
PointNet++ [QYSG17] have made it possible to apply Deep Learning to 3D point
sets. The feature representations of shapes learned by these two networks
enabled training classifiers for Semantic Segmentation, and more recently for
Instance Segmentation via the Similarity Group Proposal Network (SGPN)
[WYHN17]. One area of improvement which has been highlighted by SGPN's authors,
pertains to use of memory intensive similarity matrices which occupy memory
quadratic in the number of points. In this report, we attempt to tackle this
issue through use of two sampling based methods, which compute Instance
Segmentation on a sub-sampled Point Set, and then extrapolate labels to the
complete set using the nearest neigbhour approach. While both approaches
perform equally well on large sub-samples, the random-based strategy gives the
most improvements in terms of speed and memory usage.

Result: 拼接步骤对真实草图泛化性差，但单张草图的3D重建效果良好。

Conclusion: 流程在单张草图的3D重建上表现优异，但需改进拼接步骤的泛化能力。

Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing a 3D scene from multiple sketches.
We propose a pipeline which involves (1) stitching together multiple sketches
through use of correspondence points, (2) converting the stitched sketch into a
realistic image using a CycleGAN, and (3) estimating that image's depth-map
using a pre-trained convolutional neural network based architecture called
MegaDepth. Our contribution includes constructing a dataset of image-sketch
pairs, the images for which are from the Zurich Building Database, and sketches
have been generated by us. We use this dataset to train a CycleGAN for our
pipeline's second step. We end up with a stitching process that does not
generalize well to real drawings, but the rest of the pipeline that creates a
3D reconstruction from a single sketch performs quite well on a wide variety of
drawings.

Result: 在合成和真实高光谱数据上的实验验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 所提框架能灵活结合多种稀疏惩罚，显著提升高光谱解混性能。

Abstract: Due to low spatial resolution, hyperspectral data often consists of mixtures
of contributions from multiple materials. This limitation motivates the task of
hyperspectral unmixing (HU), a fundamental problem in hyperspectral imaging. HU
aims to identify the spectral signatures (\textit{endmembers}) of the materials
present in an observed scene, along with their relative proportions
(\textit{fractional abundance}) in each pixel. A major challenge lies in the
class variability in materials, which hinders accurate representation by a
single spectral signature, as assumed in the conventional linear mixing model.
Moreover, To address this issue, we propose using group sparsity after
representing each material with a set of spectral signatures, known as
endmember bundles, where each group corresponds to a specific material. In
particular, we develop a bundle-based framework that can enforce either
inter-group sparsity or sparsity within and across groups (SWAG) on the
abundance coefficients. Furthermore, our framework offers the flexibility to
incorporate a variety of sparsity-promoting penalties, among which the
transformed $\ell_1$ (TL1) penalty is a novel regularization in the HU
literature. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real
hyperspectral data demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed approaches.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in a wide range
of applications, from natural language processing and computer vision to speech
recognition. However, as tasks become increasingly complex, model sizes
continue to grow, posing challenges in latency and memory efficiency. To meet
these constraints, post-training quantization has emerged as a promising
solution. In this paper, we propose a novel hardware-efficient quantization and
inference scheme that exploits hardware advantages with minimal accuracy
degradation. Specifically, we introduce a W4A8 scheme, where weights are
quantized and stored using 4-bit integer precision, and inference computations
are performed using 8-bit floating-point arithmetic, demonstrating significant
speedups and improved memory utilization compared to 16-bit operations,
applicable on various modern accelerators. To mitigate accuracy loss, we
develop a novel quantization algorithm, dubbed Dual Precision Quantization
(DPQ), that leverages the unique structure of our scheme without introducing
additional inference overhead. Experimental results demonstrate improved
performance (i.e., increased throughput) while maintaining tolerable accuracy
degradation relative to the full-precision model.

Motivation: 现有LVU基准测试存在缺陷，如选择题的猜测效应和问题先验性，无法真实评估模型能力。

Method: 提出VideoEval-Pro，包含开放答案问题，要求模型真正理解视频内容，并通过感知和推理任务评估模型。

Result: 实验显示，视频LMMs在开放答案问题上表现显著下降（>25%），且增加输入帧数对VideoEval-Pro更有效。

Conclusion: VideoEval-Pro提供了更真实可靠的LVU评估标准，有助于推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for
long video understanding (LVU), prompting the development of standardized LVU
benchmarks to evaluate their performance. However, our investigation reveals a
rather sober lesson for existing LVU benchmarks. First, most existing
benchmarks rely heavily on multiple-choice questions (MCQs), whose evaluation
results are inflated due to the possibility of guessing the correct answer;
Second, a significant portion of questions in these benchmarks have strong
priors to allow models to answer directly without even reading the input video.
For example, Gemini-1.5-Pro can achieve over 50\% accuracy given a random frame
from a long video on Video-MME. We also observe that increasing the number of
frames does not necessarily lead to improvement on existing benchmarks, which
is counterintuitive. As a result, the validity and robustness of current LVU
benchmarks are undermined, impeding a faithful assessment of LMMs' long-video
understanding capability. To tackle this problem, we propose VideoEval-Pro, a
realistic LVU benchmark containing questions with open-ended short-answer,
which truly require understanding the entire video. VideoEval-Pro assesses both
segment-level and full-video understanding through perception and reasoning
tasks. By evaluating 21 proprietary and open-source video LMMs, we conclude the
following findings: (1) video LMMs show drastic performance ($>$25\%) drops on
open-ended questions compared with MCQs; (2) surprisingly, higher MCQ scores do
not lead to higher open-ended scores on VideoEval-Pro; (3) compared to other
MCQ benchmarks, VideoEval-Pro benefits more from increasing the number of input
frames. Our results show that VideoEval-Pro offers a more realistic and
reliable measure of long video understanding, providing a clearer view of
progress in this domain.

Abstract: Efficient creation of accurate and editable 3D CAD models is critical in
engineering design, significantly impacting cost and time-to-market in product
innovation. Current manual workflows remain highly time-consuming and demand
extensive user expertise. While recent developments in AI-driven CAD generation

accuracy. This paper introduces CAD-Coder, an open-source Vision-Language Model
(VLM) explicitly fine-tuned to generate editable CAD code (CadQuery Python)
directly from visual input. Leveraging a novel dataset that we
created--GenCAD-Code, consisting of over 163k CAD-model image and code
pairs--CAD-Coder outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines such as GPT-4.5 and
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, achieving a 100% valid syntax rate and the highest accuracy in

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多模态LLM模型MM-When2Speak，通过整合视觉、听觉和文本信息，显著提升了对话AI的响应时机准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的聊天机器人在实时对话中难以准确判断何时发言，尤其是短时反应，主要因其依赖单一文本输入而缺乏多模态上下文线索。

Method: 构建了一个多模态数据集，并提出MM-When2Speak模型，整合视觉、听觉和文本信息预测响应时机和类型。

Result: 实验显示MM-When2Speak在响应时机准确性上比现有单模态和LLM基线模型提升高达4倍。

Conclusion: 多模态输入对实现自然、及时的对话AI至关重要。

Abstract: While large language model (LLM)-based chatbots have demonstrated strong
capabilities in generating coherent and contextually relevant responses, they
often struggle with understanding when to speak, particularly in delivering
brief, timely reactions during ongoing conversations. This limitation arises
largely from their reliance on text input, lacking the rich contextual cues in
real-world human dialogue. In this work, we focus on real-time prediction of
response types, with an emphasis on short, reactive utterances that depend on
subtle, multimodal signals across vision, audio, and text. To support this, we
introduce a new multimodal dataset constructed from real-world conversational
videos, containing temporally aligned visual, auditory, and textual streams.
This dataset enables fine-grained modeling of response timing in dyadic
interactions. Building on this dataset, we propose MM-When2Speak, a multimodal
LLM-based model that adaptively integrates visual, auditory, and textual
context to predict when a response should occur, and what type of response is
appropriate. Experiments show that MM-When2Speak significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art unimodal and LLM-based baselines, achieving up to a 4x
improvement in response timing accuracy over leading commercial LLMs. These
results underscore the importance of multimodal inputs for producing timely,
natural, and engaging conversational AI.

TL;DR: AKRMap是一种新的降维技术，专注于可视化跨模态嵌入度量，通过核回归学习投影空间的度量分布，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降维方法（如PCA、t-SNE）仅关注单模态特征分布，无法有效捕捉跨模态度量（如CLIPScore），因此需要更准确的可视化工具。

Method: AKRMap通过监督投影网络和投影后核回归损失，结合自适应广义核，优化投影过程，生成更精确的可视化结果。

Result: 实验表明，AKRMap在生成准确且可信的可视化方面优于现有降维方法，并支持交互功能。

Conclusion: AKRMap为跨模态嵌入的可视化和比较提供了有效工具，代码和演示已开源。

Abstract: Cross-modal embeddings form the foundation for multi-modal models. However,
visualization methods for interpreting cross-modal embeddings have been
primarily confined to traditional dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques like
PCA and t-SNE. These DR methods primarily focus on feature distributions within
a single modality, whilst failing to incorporate metrics (e.g., CLIPScore)
across multiple modalities.This paper introduces AKRMap, a new DR technique
designed to visualize cross-modal embeddings metric with enhanced accuracy by
learning kernel regression of the metric landscape in the projection space.
Specifically, AKRMap constructs a supervised projection network guided by a
post-projection kernel regression loss, and employs adaptive generalized
kernels that can be jointly optimized with the projection. This approach
enables AKRMap to efficiently generate visualizations that capture complex
metric distributions, while also supporting interactive features such as zoom
and overlay for deeper exploration. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that
AKRMap outperforms existing DR methods in generating more accurate and
trustworthy visualizations. We further showcase the effectiveness of AKRMap in
visualizing and comparing cross-modal embeddings for text-to-image models. Code
and demo are available at https://github.com/yilinye/AKRMap.

TL;DR: UniCTokens提出了一种统一的概念标记框架，将个性化信息整合到视觉语言模型中，通过渐进式训练策略提升理解和生成任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将理解和生成任务分离，导致复杂提示生成受限，如无法基于概念标记生成细节描述。

Method: UniCTokens训练统一概念标记，采用三阶段渐进训练策略：理解预热、从理解引导生成、通过生成深化理解。

Result: 在UnifyBench上，UniCTokens在概念理解、生成及知识驱动生成任务中表现优异，尤其在后者达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 研究表明，增强理解可提升生成质量，生成过程也能反哺理解，两者相互促进。

Abstract: Personalized models have demonstrated remarkable success in understanding and
generating concepts provided by users. However, existing methods use separate
concept tokens for understanding and generation, treating these tasks in
isolation. This may result in limitations for generating images with complex
prompts. For example, given the concept $\langle bo\rangle$, generating
"$\langle bo\rangle$ wearing its hat" without additional textual descriptions
of its hat. We call this kind of generation personalized knowledge-driven
generation. To address the limitation, we present UniCTokens, a novel framework
that effectively integrates personalized information into a unified vision
language model (VLM) for understanding and generation. UniCTokens trains a set
of unified concept tokens to leverage complementary semantics, boosting two
personalized tasks. Moreover, we propose a progressive training strategy with
three stages: understanding warm-up, bootstrapping generation from
understanding, and deepening understanding from generation to enhance mutual
benefits between both tasks. To quantitatively evaluate the unified VLM
personalization, we present UnifyBench, the first benchmark for assessing
concept understanding, concept generation, and knowledge-driven generation.
Experimental results on UnifyBench indicate that UniCTokens shows competitive
performance compared to leading methods in concept understanding, concept
generation, and achieving state-of-the-art results in personalized
knowledge-driven generation. Our research demonstrates that enhanced
understanding improves generation, and the generation process can yield
valuable insights into understanding. Our code and dataset will be released at:

*Yu Tong,Zihao Pan,Shuai Yang,Kaiyang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IndexMark是一种无需训练的自动回归图像生成模型水印框架，利用代码本冗余特性嵌入水印，不影响图像质量，并通过验证方案增强抗裁剪攻击能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成水印方法主要针对扩散模型，自动回归图像生成模型的水印研究较少，IndexMark填补了这一空白。

Method: 基于代码本冗余特性，提出match-then-replace方法选择相似水印标记并替换，嵌入水印；通过Index Encoder提高验证精度，并引入辅助验证方案增强鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，IndexMark在图像质量和验证准确性上达到最优，且对裁剪、噪声、模糊等多种扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: IndexMark为自动回归图像生成模型提供了一种高效、鲁棒的水印解决方案。

Abstract: Invisible image watermarking can protect image ownership and prevent
malicious misuse of visual generative models. However, existing generative
watermarking methods are mainly designed for diffusion models while
watermarking for autoregressive image generation models remains largely
underexplored. We propose IndexMark, a training-free watermarking framework for
autoregressive image generation models. IndexMark is inspired by the redundancy
property of the codebook: replacing autoregressively generated indices with
similar indices produces negligible visual differences. The core component in
IndexMark is a simple yet effective match-then-replace method, which carefully
selects watermark tokens from the codebook based on token similarity, and
promotes the use of watermark tokens through token replacement, thereby
embedding the watermark without affecting the image quality. Watermark
verification is achieved by calculating the proportion of watermark tokens in
generated images, with precision further improved by an Index Encoder.
Furthermore, we introduce an auxiliary validation scheme to enhance robustness
against cropping attacks. Experiments demonstrate that IndexMark achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of image quality and verification
accuracy, and exhibits robustness against various perturbations, including
cropping, noises, Gaussian blur, random erasing, color jittering, and JPEG
compression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过强化学习训练视觉语言模型（VLM）进行图像推理，无需显式的思维链监督。研究发现，直接应用强化学习可能导致模型走捷径，而通过先生成图像描述再推理的格式（caption-reason-answer）能有效提升泛化能力。模型Visionary-R1在多个视觉推理基准上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在图像推理任务中的泛化能力问题，避免因强化学习导致的捷径学习现象。

Method: 采用强化学习训练VLM，引入caption-reason-answer输出格式，先生成图像描述再进行推理。

Result: Visionary-R1在273K无思维链监督的视觉问答对上训练，表现优于GPT-4o等强大多模态模型。

Conclusion: 通过先描述图像再推理的格式，能有效提升视觉语言模型的推理能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Learning general-purpose reasoning capabilities has long been a challenging
problem in AI. Recent research in large language models (LLMs), such as
DeepSeek-R1, has shown that reinforcement learning techniques like GRPO can
enable pre-trained LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities using simple
question-answer pairs. In this paper, we aim to train visual language models
(VLMs) to perform reasoning on image data through reinforcement learning and
visual question-answer pairs, without any explicit chain-of-thought (CoT)
supervision. Our findings indicate that simply applying reinforcement learning
to a VLM -- by prompting the model to produce a reasoning chain before
providing an answer -- can lead the model to develop shortcuts from easy
questions, thereby reducing its ability to generalize across unseen data
distributions. We argue that the key to mitigating shortcut learning is to
encourage the model to interpret images prior to reasoning. Therefore, we train
the model to adhere to a caption-reason-answer output format: initially
generating a detailed caption for an image, followed by constructing an
extensive reasoning chain. When trained on 273K CoT-free visual question-answer
pairs and using only reinforcement learning, our model, named Visionary-R1,
outperforms strong multimodal models, such as GPT-4o, Claude3.5-Sonnet, and
Gemini-1.5-Pro, on multiple visual reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: UniGen为构建统一MLLM提供了实用见解，并为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: We introduce UniGen, a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable
of image understanding and generation. We study the full training pipeline of
UniGen from a data-centric perspective, including multi-stage pre-training,
supervised fine-tuning, and direct preference optimization. More importantly,
we propose a new Chain-of-Thought Verification (CoT-V) strategy for test-time
scaling, which significantly boosts UniGen's image generation quality using a
simple Best-of-N test-time strategy. Specifically, CoT-V enables UniGen to act
as both image generator and verifier at test time, assessing the semantic
alignment between a text prompt and its generated image in a step-by-step CoT
manner. Trained entirely on open-source datasets across all stages, UniGen
achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of image understanding and
generation benchmarks, with a final score of 0.78 on GenEval and 85.19 on
DPG-Bench. Through extensive ablation studies, our work provides actionable
insights and addresses key challenges in the full life cycle of building
unified MLLMs, contributing meaningful directions to the future research.

TL;DR: GRAT是一种无需训练的注意力加速策略，通过分组和结构化区域限制，显著提升扩散Transformer的图像和视频生成速度，同时保持输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer的计算成本高，限制了实际部署，例如生成高分辨率图像耗时过长。

Method: GRAT通过分组和结构化区域限制注意力计算，减少计算开销，同时保留关键注意力模式和长程上下文。

Result: GRAT在生成8192×8192图像时实现了35.8倍的加速，且无需微调即可保持性能。

Conclusion: GRAT为加速扩散Transformer提供了有效方案，有望推动可扩展视觉生成的研究。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Transformers have demonstrated impressive generative
capabilities, but their high computational costs hinder practical deployment,
for example, generating an $8192\times 8192$ image can take over an hour on an
A100 GPU. In this work, we propose GRAT (\textbf{GR}ouping first,
\textbf{AT}tending smartly), a training-free attention acceleration strategy
for fast image and video generation without compromising output quality. The
key insight is to exploit the inherent sparsity in learned attention maps
(which tend to be locally focused) in pretrained Diffusion Transformers and
leverage better GPU parallelism. Specifically, GRAT first partitions contiguous
tokens into non-overlapping groups, aligning both with GPU execution patterns
and the local attention structures learned in pretrained generative
Transformers. It then accelerates attention by having all query tokens within
the same group share a common set of attendable key and value tokens. These key
and value tokens are further restricted to structured regions, such as
surrounding blocks or criss-cross regions, significantly reducing computational
overhead (e.g., attaining a \textbf{35.8$\times$} speedup over full attention
when generating $8192\times 8192$ images) while preserving essential attention
patterns and long-range context. We validate GRAT on pretrained Flux and
HunyuanVideo for image and video generation, respectively. In both cases, GRAT
achieves substantially faster inference without any fine-tuning, while
maintaining the performance of full attention. We hope GRAT will inspire future
research on accelerating Diffusion Transformers for scalable visual generation.

candidates were validated as interesting, compared to 0--7% for a SHAP-based
baseline. Overall, 28% of 109 candidates were interesting to medical experts.

TL;DR: PandaGuard是一个统一模块化框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLM）的越狱安全性，包含攻击、防御和判断模块，支持多种LLM接口和实验配置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全评估方法零散且缺乏系统性，无法全面分析攻击与防御的交互效果。

Method: 提出PandaGuard框架，集成19种攻击方法、12种防御机制及多种判断策略，支持灵活插件架构。

Result: 通过PandaBench基准测试49种LLM，发现防御效果因模型和判断策略而异，且判断一致性影响安全评估。

Conclusion: PandaGuard为LLM安全研究提供了系统化、可复现的工具，揭示了防御与判断的复杂性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable capabilities but remain
vulnerable to adversarial prompts known as jailbreaks, which can bypass safety
alignment and elicit harmful outputs. Despite growing efforts in LLM safety
research, existing evaluations are often fragmented, focused on isolated attack
or defense techniques, and lack systematic, reproducible analysis. In this
work, we introduce PandaGuard, a unified and modular framework that models LLM
jailbreak safety as a multi-agent system comprising attackers, defenders, and
judges. Our framework implements 19 attack methods and 12 defense mechanisms,
along with multiple judgment strategies, all within a flexible plugin
architecture supporting diverse LLM interfaces, multiple interaction modes, and
configuration-driven experimentation that enhances reproducibility and
practical deployment. Built on this framework, we develop PandaBench, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the interactions between these
attack/defense methods across 49 LLMs and various judgment approaches,
requiring over 3 billion tokens to execute. Our extensive evaluation reveals
key insights into model vulnerabilities, defense cost-performance trade-offs,
and judge consistency. We find that no single defense is optimal across all
dimensions and that judge disagreement introduces nontrivial variance in safety
assessments. We release the code, configurations, and evaluation results to
support transparent and reproducible research in LLM safety.

Result: 实验证明，攻击者可通过操纵查询提取隐私信息，LMMs可能直接或间接泄露敏感数据。

Conclusion: MRAG系统亟需更强大的隐私保护技术以应对多模态数据的隐私风险。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) systems enhance LMMs by
integrating external multimodal databases, but introduce unexplored privacy
vulnerabilities. While text-based RAG privacy risks have been studied,
multimodal data presents unique challenges. We provide the first systematic
analysis of MRAG privacy vulnerabilities across vision-language and
speech-language modalities. Using a novel compositional structured prompt
attack in a black-box setting, we demonstrate how attackers can extract private
information by manipulating queries. Our experiments reveal that LMMs can both
directly generate outputs resembling retrieved content and produce descriptions
that indirectly expose sensitive information, highlighting the urgent need for
robust privacy-preserving MRAG techniques.

Motivation: 现有研究对开源和闭源LLM的提示注入攻击研究不足，需更全面的评估和有效攻击方法。

Method: 提出ASP指标，设计催眠攻击和忽略前缀攻击，测试14种开源LLM。

Result: 催眠攻击对部分LLM攻击成功率达90%，忽略前缀攻击对全部14种LLM成功率超60%。

Conclusion: 开源LLM易受提示注入攻击，需提高公众意识并制定有效缓解策略。

Abstract: Recent studies demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable
to different prompt-based attacks, generating harmful content or sensitive
information. Both closed-source and open-source LLMs are underinvestigated for
these attacks. This paper studies effective prompt injection attacks against
the $\mathbf{14}$ most popular open-source LLMs on five attack benchmarks.
Current metrics only consider successful attacks, whereas our proposed Attack
Success Probability (ASP) also captures uncertainty in the model's response,
reflecting ambiguity in attack feasibility. By comprehensively analyzing the
effectiveness of prompt injection attacks, we propose a simple and effective
hypnotism attack; results show that this attack causes aligned language models,
including Stablelm2, Mistral, Openchat, and Vicuna, to generate objectionable
behaviors, achieving around $90$% ASP. They also indicate that our ignore
prefix attacks can break all $\mathbf{14}$ open-source LLMs, achieving over
$60$% ASP on a multi-categorical dataset. We find that moderately well-known
LLMs exhibit higher vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, highlighting the
need to raise public awareness and prioritize efficient mitigation strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的价值测量数据集因信息陈旧或通用性问题，无法有效捕捉LLM之间的价值差异，导致结果饱和且缺乏信息量。

Method: AdAEM通过上下文优化方式自动生成和扩展测试问题，最大化信息论目标，提取最新或文化争议话题。

Result: 生成12,310个基于Schwartz价值理论的问题，并成功对16个LLM进行了价值基准测试。

Conclusion: AdAEM能够与LLM共同进化，持续追踪其价值动态，为价值研究提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Assessing Large Language Models (LLMs)' underlying value differences enables
comprehensive comparison of their misalignment, cultural adaptability, and
biases. Nevertheless, current value measurement datasets face the
informativeness challenge: with often outdated, contaminated, or generic test
questions, they can only capture the shared value orientations among different
LLMs, leading to saturated and thus uninformative results. To address this
problem, we introduce AdAEM, a novel, self-extensible assessment framework for
revealing LLMs' inclinations. Distinct from previous static benchmarks, AdAEM
can automatically and adaptively generate and extend its test questions. This
is achieved by probing the internal value boundaries of a diverse set of LLMs
developed across cultures and time periods in an in-context optimization
manner. The optimization process theoretically maximizes an
information-theoretic objective to extract the latest or culturally
controversial topics, providing more distinguishable and informative insights
about models' value differences. In this way, AdAEM is able to co-evolve with
the development of LLMs, consistently tracking their value dynamics. Using
AdAEM, we generate 12,310 questions grounded in Schwartz Value Theory, conduct
an extensive analysis to manifest our method's validity and effectiveness, and
benchmark the values of 16 LLMs, laying the groundwork for better value
research.

Abstract: We present EuLearn, the first surface datasets equitably representing a
diversity of topological types. We designed our embedded surfaces of uniformly
varying genera relying on random knots, thus allowing our surfaces to knot with
themselves. EuLearn contributes new topological datasets of meshes, point
clouds, and scalar fields in 3D. We aim to facilitate the training of machine
learning systems that can discern topological features. We experimented with
specific emblematic 3D neural network architectures, finding that their vanilla
implementations perform poorly on genus classification. To enhance performance,
we developed a novel, non-Euclidean, statistical sampling method adapted to
graph and manifold data. We also introduce adjacency-informed adaptations of
PointNet and Transformer architectures that rely on our non-Euclidean sampling
strategy. Our results demonstrate that incorporating topological information
into deep learning workflows significantly improves performance on these
otherwise challenging EuLearn datasets.

### [236] [GANCompress: GAN-Enhanced Neural Image Compression with Binary Spherical Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13542)
*Karthik Sivakoti*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: GANCompress结合BSQ与GANs，提出了一种高效神经压缩框架，显著提升压缩效率与视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉数据爆炸式增长需要高效压缩技术，现有神经压缩方法在感知质量、计算效率和适应性方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用基于变压器的自动编码器与BSQ瓶颈，结合GAN架构，优化频率域注意力和颜色一致性。

Result: GANCompress压缩效率提升100倍，感知指标优于H.264 12-15%，编码速度提升2.4倍，FID降低43%。

Conclusion: GANCompress在神经压缩技术中取得显著进展，适用于实时视觉通信系统。

Abstract: The exponential growth of visual data in digital communications has
intensified the need for efficient compression techniques that balance
rate-distortion performance with computational feasibility. While recent neural
compression approaches have shown promise, they still struggle with fundamental
challenges: preserving perceptual quality at high compression ratios,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to diverse visual content. This
paper introduces GANCompress, a novel neural compression framework that
synergistically combines Binary Spherical Quantization (BSQ) with Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) to address these challenges. Our approach employs a
transformer-based autoencoder with an enhanced BSQ bottleneck that projects
latent representations onto a hypersphere, enabling efficient discretization
with bounded quantization error. This is followed by a specialized GAN
architecture incorporating frequency-domain attention and color consistency
optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that GANCompress achieves
substantial improvement in compression efficiency -- reducing file sizes by up
to 100x with minimal visual distortion. Our method outperforms traditional
codecs like H.264 by 12-15% in perceptual metrics while maintaining comparable
PSNR/SSIM values, with 2.4x faster encoding and decoding speeds. On standard
benchmarks including ImageNet-1k and COCO2017, GANCompress sets a new
state-of-the-art, reducing FID from 0.72 to 0.41 (43% improvement) compared to
previous methods while maintaining higher throughput. This work presents a
significant advancement in neural compression technology with promising
applications for real-time visual communication systems.

*Yipeng Sun,Linda-Sophie Schneider,Chengze Ye,Mingxuan Gu,Siyuan Mei,Siming Bayer,Andreas Maier*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的FDK算法，通过选择性集成可训练元素和利用小波变换减少参数，保持传统算法的可解释性，同时提升抗噪能力和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDK算法在CBCT重建中效率高但易受噪声和伪影影响，现有深度学习方法虽改善图像质量但计算复杂且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 在FDK的余弦加权和滤波阶段选择性集成可训练元素，利用小波变换生成稀疏表示以减少参数。

Result: 参数减少93.75%，计算成本与FDK相当，抗噪能力增强，易于集成到现有CT重建流程。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床应用中计算受限环境提供了一种实用且高效的改进方案。

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is essential in medical imaging, and the
Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (FDK) algorithm is a popular choice for reconstruction due
to its efficiency. However, FDK is susceptible to noise and artifacts. While
recent deep learning methods offer improved image quality, they often increase
computational complexity and lack the interpretability of traditional methods.
In this paper, we introduce an enhanced FDK-based neural network that maintains
the classical algorithm's interpretability by selectively integrating trainable
elements into the cosine weighting and filtering stages. Recognizing the
challenge of a large parameter space inherent in 3D CBCT data, we leverage
wavelet transformations to create sparse representations of the cosine weights
and filters. This strategic sparsification reduces the parameter count by
$93.75\%$ without compromising performance, accelerates convergence, and
importantly, maintains the inference computational cost equivalent to the
classical FDK algorithm. Our method not only ensures volumetric consistency and
boosts robustness to noise, but is also designed for straightforward
integration into existing CT reconstruction pipelines. This presents a
pragmatic enhancement that can benefit clinical applications, particularly in
environments with computational limitations.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 研究通过瞳孔大小分析图像质量评估（IQA）任务对认知过程的影响，发现IQA任务激活了视觉注意力机制，且瞳孔变化与图像质量密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索IQA任务如何影响认知过程，以及瞳孔大小与图像质量的关系，为客观和主观IQA方法提供理论基础。

Method: 邀请受试者参与自由观察和IQA任务，分析两种任务下瞳孔大小的差异。

Result: IQA任务激活了视觉注意力机制，瞳孔变化与图像质量显著相关。

Conclusion: 研究为客观IQA方法提供了理论基础，并提出了一种新的主观IQA方法。

Abstract: This paper explores how the image quality assessment (IQA) task affects the
cognitive processes of people from the perspective of pupil size and studies
the relationship between pupil size and image quality. Specifically, we first
invited subjects to participate in a subjective experiment, which includes two
tasks: free observation and IQA. In the free observation task, subjects did not
need to perform any action, and they only needed to observe images as they
usually do with an album. In the IQA task, subjects were required to score
images according to their overall impression of image quality. Then, by
analyzing the difference in pupil size between the two tasks, we find that
people may activate the visual attention mechanism when evaluating image
quality. Meanwhile, we also find that the change in pupil size is closely
related to image quality in the IQA task. For future research on IQA, this
research can not only provide a theoretical basis for the objective IQA method
and promote the development of more effective objective IQA methods, but also
provide a new subjective IQA method for collecting the authentic subjective
impression of image quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动评估方法主观性强、成本高、耗时长且可靠性低，需开发自动化质量评估系统。

Method: 基于TBS标准、AI算法和临床数据特征，通过目标检测、分类和分割模型量化质量指标，利用XGBoost模型综合评分。

Result: 在100张WSI上的实验表明，该方法在速度和一致性上具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为宫颈癌筛查提供了高效、可靠的质量评估工具。

Abstract: The ThinPrep Cytologic Test (TCT) is the most widely used method for cervical
cancer screening, and the sample quality directly impacts the accuracy of the
diagnosis. Traditional manual evaluation methods rely on the observation of
pathologist under microscopes. These methods exhibit high subjectivity, high
cost, long duration, and low reliability. With the development of
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD), an automated quality assessment system that
performs at the level of a professional pathologist is necessary. To address
this need, we propose a fully automated quality assessment method for Cervical
Cytopathology Whole Slide Images (WSIs) based on The Bethesda System (TBS)
diagnostic standards, artificial intelligence algorithms, and the
characteristics of clinical data. The method analysis the context of WSIs to
quantify quality evaluation metrics which are focused by TBS such as staining
quality, cell counts and cell mass proportion through multiple models including
object detection, classification and segmentation. Subsequently, the XGBoost
model is used to mine the attention paid by pathologists to different quality
evaluation metrics when evaluating samples, thereby obtaining a comprehensive
WSI sample score calculation model. Experimental results on 100 WSIs
demonstrate that the proposed evaluation method has significant advantages in
terms of speed and consistency.

Abstract: A common neurodegenerative disease, Alzheimer's disease requires a precise
diagnosis and efficient treatment, particularly in light of escalating
healthcare expenses and the expanding use of artificial intelligence in medical
diagnostics. Many recent studies shows that the combination of brain Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) and deep neural networks have achieved promising
results for diagnosing AD. Using deep convolutional neural networks, this paper
introduces a novel deep learning architecture that incorporates multiresidual
blocks, specialized spatial attention blocks, grouped query attention, and
multi-head attention. The study assessed the model's performance on four
publicly accessible datasets and concentrated on identifying binary and
multiclass issues across various categories. This paper also takes into account
of the explainability of AD's progression and compared with state-of-the-art
methods namely Gradient Class Activation Mapping (GradCAM), Score-CAM, Faster
Score-CAM, and XGRADCAM. Our methodology consistently outperforms current
approaches, achieving 99.66\% accuracy in 4-class classification, 99.63\% in
3-class classification, and 100\% in binary classification using Kaggle
datasets. For Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) datasets the
accuracies are 99.92\%, 99.90\%, and 99.95\% respectively. The Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 (ADNI-1) dataset was used for experiments in
three planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) and a combination of all planes.
The study achieved accuracies of 99.08\% for axis, 99.85\% for sagittal, 99.5\%
for coronal, and 99.17\% for all axis, and 97.79\% and 8.60\% respectively for
ADNI-2. The network's ability to retrieve important information from MRI images
is demonstrated by its excellent accuracy in categorizing AD stages.

Conclusion: AHSL方法通过解剖学层次监督和先验信息，有效解决了肺部段分割的挑战。

Abstract: Pulmonary segment segmentation is crucial for cancer localization and
surgical planning. However, the pixel-wise annotation of pulmonary segments is
laborious, as the boundaries between segments are indistinguishable in medical
images. To this end, we propose a weakly supervised learning (WSL) method,
termed Anatomy-Hierarchy Supervised Learning (AHSL), which consults the precise
clinical anatomical definition of pulmonary segments to perform pulmonary
segment segmentation. Since pulmonary segments reside within the lobes and are
determined by the bronchovascular tree, i.e., artery, airway and vein, the
design of the loss function is founded on two principles. First, segment-level
labels are utilized to directly supervise the output of the pulmonary segments,
ensuring that they accurately encompass the appropriate bronchovascular tree.
Second, lobe-level supervision indirectly oversees the pulmonary segment,
ensuring their inclusion within the corresponding lobe. Besides, we introduce a
two-stage segmentation strategy that incorporates bronchovascular priori
information. Furthermore, a consistency loss is proposed to enhance the
smoothness of segment boundaries, along with an evaluation metric designed to
measure the smoothness of pulmonary segment boundaries. Visual inspection and
evaluation metrics from experiments conducted on a private dataset demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了临床扫描的快速准确表面重建，支持大规模研究和难以招募的临床人群分析，代码已开源。

Abstract: Surface-based cortical analysis is valuable for a variety of neuroimaging
tasks, such as spatial normalization, parcellation, and gray matter (GM)
thickness estimation. However, most tools for estimating cortical surfaces work
exclusively on scans with at least 1 mm isotropic resolution and are tuned to a
specific magnetic resonance (MR) contrast, often T1-weighted (T1w). This
precludes application using most clinical MR scans, which are very
heterogeneous in terms of contrast and resolution. Here, we use synthetic
domain-randomized data to train the first neural network for explicit
estimation of cortical surfaces from scans of any contrast and resolution,
without retraining. Our method deforms a template mesh to the white matter (WM)
surface, which guarantees topological correctness. This mesh is further
deformed to estimate the GM surface. We compare our method to
recon-all-clinical (RAC), an implicit surface reconstruction method which is
currently the only other tool capable of processing heterogeneous clinical MR
scans, on ADNI and a large clinical dataset (n=1,332). We show a approximately
50 % reduction in cortical thickness error (from 0.50 to 0.24 mm) with respect
to RAC and better recovery of the aging-related cortical thinning patterns
detected by FreeSurfer on high-resolution T1w scans. Our method enables fast
and accurate surface reconstruction of clinical scans, allowing studies (1)
with sample sizes far beyond what is feasible in a research setting, and (2) of
clinical populations that are difficult to enroll in research studies. The code
is publicly available at https://github.com/simnibs/brainnet.

TL;DR: 论文提出了NOVA基准测试，用于评估模型在真实临床环境中处理罕见和未知病理的能力，揭示了现有模型在分布外泛化上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅针对常见异常类型，无法反映模型在真实临床环境中处理罕见或未知病理的能力，因此需要更严格的评估标准。

Method: NOVA是一个包含约900个脑MRI扫描的评估基准，涵盖281种罕见病理和异构采集协议，提供临床叙述和专家标注，用于评估异常定位、视觉描述和诊断推理。

Result: 实验显示，领先的视觉语言模型（如GPT-4o、Gemini 2.0 Flash和Qwen2.5-VL-72B）在NOVA上表现显著下降，表明现有模型在分布外泛化上的局限性。

Conclusion: NOVA为评估模型在真实临床环境中的能力提供了严格标准，揭示了现有技术在处理未知异常时的不足，推动了相关研究的进步。

Abstract: In many real-world applications, deployed models encounter inputs that differ
from the data seen during training. Out-of-distribution detection identifies
whether an input stems from an unseen distribution, while open-world
recognition flags such inputs to ensure the system remains robust as
ever-emerging, previously $unknown$ categories appear and must be addressed
without retraining. Foundation and vision-language models are pre-trained on
large and diverse datasets with the expectation of broad generalization across
domains, including medical imaging. However, benchmarking these models on test
sets with only a few common outlier types silently collapses the evaluation
back to a closed-set problem, masking failures on rare or truly novel
conditions encountered in clinical use.
  We therefore present $NOVA$, a challenging, real-life $evaluation-only$
benchmark of $\sim$900 brain MRI scans that span 281 rare pathologies and
heterogeneous acquisition protocols. Each case includes rich clinical
narratives and double-blinded expert bounding-box annotations. Together, these
enable joint assessment of anomaly localisation, visual captioning, and
diagnostic reasoning. Because NOVA is never used for training, it serves as an
$extreme$ stress-test of out-of-distribution generalisation: models must bridge
a distribution gap both in sample appearance and in semantic space. Baseline
results with leading vision-language models (GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash, and
Qwen2.5-VL-72B) reveal substantial performance drops across all tasks,
establishing NOVA as a rigorous testbed for advancing models that can detect,
localize, and reason about truly unknown anomalies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过流导向和上下文补偿来优化神经视频编码器（NVC）中时间上下文传播的方法，显著提升了压缩性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NVC的时间上下文传播机制未能充分利用参考信息，限制了压缩性能的进一步提升。

Method: 采用流导向挖掘参考帧与预测帧之间的相关性生成额外时间上下文，并通过上下文补偿调制传播的时间上下文。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比传统视频编码H.266/VVC平均节省22.7%比特率，比现有最佳NVC DCVC-FM节省10.1%。

Conclusion: 通过优化时间上下文传播机制，显著提升了神经视频编码器的压缩效率。

Abstract: Efficient video coding is highly dependent on exploiting the temporal
redundancy, which is usually achieved by extracting and leveraging the temporal
context in the emerging conditional coding-based neural video codec (NVC).
Although the latest NVC has achieved remarkable progress in improving the
compression performance, the inherent temporal context propagation mechanism
lacks the ability to sufficiently leverage the reference information, limiting
further improvement. In this paper, we address the limitation by modulating the
temporal context with the reference frame in two steps. Specifically, we first
propose the flow orientation to mine the inter-correlation between the
reference frame and prediction frame for generating the additional oriented
temporal context. Moreover, we introduce the context compensation to leverage
the oriented context to modulate the propagated temporal context generated from
the propagated reference feature. Through the synergy mechanism and decoupling
loss supervision, the irrelevant propagated information can be effectively
eliminated to ensure better context modeling. Experimental results demonstrate
that our codec achieves on average 22.7% bitrate reduction over the advanced
traditional video codec H.266/VVC, and offers an average 10.1% bitrate saving
over the previous state-of-the-art NVC DCVC-FM. The code is available at

Method: 结合神经场（NF）的灵活性和去噪评分函数的结构先验，提出了一种新的正则化方法。

Result: 在三个高对比度模拟对象上的实验表明，该方法比基于总变分的现有NF方法成像质量更好。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过结合神经场和去噪评分函数，有效提升了逆散射问题的成像质量。

Abstract: Inverse scattering is a fundamental challenge in many imaging applications,
ranging from microscopy to remote sensing. Solving this problem often requires
jointly estimating two unknowns -- the image and the scattering field inside
the object -- necessitating effective image prior to regularize the inference.
In this paper, we propose a regularized neural field (NF) approach which
integrates the denoising score function used in score-based generative models.
The neural field formulation offers convenient flexibility to performing joint
estimation, while the denoising score function imposes the rich structural
prior of images. Our results on three high-contrast simulated objects show that
the proposed approach yields a better imaging quality compared to the
state-of-the-art NF approach, where regularization is based on total variation.

Abstract: The International Society of Ultrasound advocates Intrapartum Ultrasound (US)
Imaging in Obstetrics and Gynecology (ISUOG) to monitor labour progression
through changes in fetal head position. Two reliable ultrasound-derived
parameters that are used to predict outcomes of instrumental vaginal delivery
are the angle of progression (AoP) and head-symphysis distance (HSD). In this
work, as part of the Intrapartum Ultrasounds Grand Challenge (IUGC) 2024, we
propose an automated fetal biometry measurement pipeline to reduce intra- and
inter-observer variability and improve measurement reliability. Our pipeline
consists of three key tasks: (i) classification of standard planes (SP) from US
videos, (ii) segmentation of fetal head and pubic symphysis from the detected
SPs, and (iii) computation of the AoP and HSD from the segmented regions. We
perform sparse sampling to mitigate class imbalances and reduce spurious
correlations in task (i), and utilize ensemble-based deep learning methods for
task (i) and (ii) to enhance generalizability under different US acquisition
settings. Finally, to promote robustness in task iii) with respect to the
structural fidelity of measurements, we retain the largest connected components
and apply ellipse fitting to the segmentations. Our solution achieved ACC:
0.9452, F1: 0.9225, AUC: 0.983, MCC: 0.8361, DSC: 0.918, HD: 19.73, ASD: 5.71,
$\Delta_{AoP}$: 8.90 and $\Delta_{HSD}$: 14.35 across an unseen hold-out set of
4 patients and 224 US frames. The results from the proposed automated pipeline
can improve the understanding of labour arrest causes and guide the development
of clinical risk stratification tools for efficient and effective prenatal

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures within Large Reasoning Models (LRMs)
have achieved impressive reasoning capabilities by selectively activating
experts to facilitate structured cognitive processes. Despite notable advances,
existing reasoning models often suffer from cognitive inefficiencies like
overthinking and underthinking. To address these limitations, we introduce a
novel inference-time steering methodology called Reinforcing Cognitive Experts
(RICE), designed to improve reasoning performance without additional training
or complex heuristics. Leveraging normalized Pointwise Mutual Information
(nPMI), we systematically identify specialized experts, termed ''cognitive
experts'' that orchestrate meta-level reasoning operations characterized by
tokens like ''<think>''. Empirical evaluations with leading MoE-based LRMs
(DeepSeek-R1 and Qwen3-235B) on rigorous quantitative and scientific reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate noticeable and consistent improvements in reasoning
accuracy, cognitive efficiency, and cross-domain generalization. Crucially, our
lightweight approach substantially outperforms prevalent reasoning-steering
techniques, such as prompt design and decoding constraints, while preserving
the model's general instruction-following skills. These results highlight
reinforcing cognitive experts as a promising, practical, and interpretable
direction to enhance cognitive efficiency within advanced reasoning models.

Motivation: 当前对LLMs在工程领域的评估过于简化，未能充分反映真实工程能力，因此需要更系统的评估方法。

Method: 构建包含100多个真实工程问题的数据库，评估四种先进LLMs在复杂任务中的表现。

Result: LLMs在基础时空推理上表现良好，但在抽象推理、形式化建模和上下文敏感逻辑上表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂工程任务中仍有局限性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformative not only for daily activities
but also for engineering tasks. However, current evaluations of LLMs in
engineering exhibit two critical shortcomings: (i) the reliance on simplified
use cases, often adapted from examination materials where correctness is easily
verifiable, and (ii) the use of ad hoc scenarios that insufficiently capture
critical engineering competencies. Consequently, the assessment of LLMs on
complex, real-world engineering problems remains largely unexplored. This paper
addresses this gap by introducing a curated database comprising over 100
questions derived from authentic, production-oriented engineering scenarios,
systematically designed to cover core competencies such as product design,
prognosis, and diagnosis. Using this dataset, we evaluate four state-of-the-art
LLMs, including both cloud-based and locally hosted instances, to
systematically investigate their performance on complex engineering tasks. Our
results show that LLMs demonstrate strengths in basic temporal and structural
reasoning but struggle significantly with abstract reasoning, formal modeling,
and context-sensitive engineering logic.

Method: 构建跨课程概念图，利用零样本LLM提示建立概念间联系，结合GCN和对比学习目标。

Result: TransKT显著提升了知识状态估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TransKT通过跨课程知识转移和对比学习，为知识追踪提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to predict learners' future performance based on
historical learning interactions. However, existing KT models predominantly
focus on data from a single course, limiting their ability to capture a
comprehensive understanding of learners' knowledge states. In this paper, we
propose TransKT, a contrastive cross-course knowledge tracing method that
leverages concept graph guided knowledge transfer to model the relationships
between learning behaviors across different courses, thereby enhancing
knowledge state estimation. Specifically, TransKT constructs a cross-course
concept graph by leveraging zero-shot Large Language Model (LLM) prompts to
establish implicit links between related concepts across different courses.
This graph serves as the foundation for knowledge transfer, enabling the model
to integrate and enhance the semantic features of learners' interactions across
courses. Furthermore, TransKT includes an LLM-to-LM pipeline for incorporating
summarized semantic features, which significantly improves the performance of
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) used for knowledge transfer. Additionally,
TransKT employs a contrastive objective that aligns single-course and
cross-course knowledge states, thereby refining the model's ability to provide
a more robust and accurate representation of learners' overall knowledge
states.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为自主代理完成现实任务的能力，提出了一种基于自由职业编程和数据分析任务的新基准测试，并评估了四种现代LLMs的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在自由职业软件开发等现实任务中的潜力，并提供一个可扩展、可重复的评估框架。

Method: 使用Kaggle自由职业数据集构建合成任务，标准化价格，并通过结构化输入输出测试用例和价格标签实现自动化评估。

Result: Claude 3.5 Haiku表现最佳，赚取约152万美元，其次是GPT-4o-mini（149万美元）、Qwen 2.5（133万美元）和Mistral（70万美元）。

Conclusion: 研究展示了AI作为自由职业开发者的可行性，同时指出了自动化基准测试的优势与局限性，以及结构化任务与真实自由职业工作复杂性之间的差距。

Abstract: This study explores Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents for
real-world tasks, including freelance software development. This work presents
a new benchmark that evaluates LLMs on freelance programming and data analysis
tasks derived from economic data. We construct the benchmark using synthetic
tasks created from a Kaggle Freelancer dataset of job postings, with all job
prices standardized to USD (median fixed-project price around $250, and an
average of $306). Each task is accompanied by structured input-output test
cases and an estimated price tag, enabling automated correctness checking and a
monetary performance valuation. This approach is inspired by OpenAI's recent
SWE-Lancer benchmark (1,400 real Upwork tasks worth $1M total). Still, our
framework simplifies evaluation using programmatically testable tasks and
predicted price values, making it highly scalable and repeatable. On this
benchmark, we evaluate four modern LLMs - Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4o-mini, Qwen
2.5, and Mistral. We report each model's accuracy (task success rate and
test-case pass rate) and the total "freelance earnings" it achieves (sum of
prices of solved tasks). Our results show that Claude 3.5 Haiku performs best,
earning approximately $1.52 million USD, followed closely by GPT-4o-mini at
$1.49 million, then Qwen 2.5 ($1.33M) and Mistral ($0.70M). We analyze the
distribution of errors per task and observe that the strongest models solve the
most tasks and rarely fail completely on any project. We discuss the
implications of these results for the feasibility of AI as a freelance
developer, the advantages and limitations of our automated benchmark approach,
and the gap between performance on structured tasks versus the true complexity
of real-world freelance jobs.

TL;DR: 论文提出BARREL框架，解决大型推理模型（LRMs）因过度思考导致的过度自信和错误答案问题，显著提升了模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LRMs在推理中很少承认无知，反而表现出过度自信并给出错误答案，影响其事实可靠性。

Method: 提出BARREL框架，通过简洁和边界感知的推理模式，减少过度思考行为（如最后一刻猜测和二次思考循环）。

Result: 实验显示，BARREL训练将DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B的可靠性从39.33%提升至61.48%，同时保持与R1生成数据微调模型相当的准确性。

Conclusion: BARREL框架为构建更可靠的事实性System 2 LRMs提供了启发。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive
capabilities in mathematical and logical reasoning. However, current LRMs
rarely admit ignorance or respond with "I don't know". Instead, they often
produce incorrect answers while showing undue confidence, raising concerns
about their factual reliability. In this work, we identify two pathological
reasoning patterns characterized by overthinking that contribute to the
overconfident and incorrect answers: last-minute guessing and second-thought
spiraling. To address these issues, we propose BARREL-a novel framework that
promotes concise and boundary-aware factual reasoning. Our experiments show
that BARREL-training increases the reliability of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B
from 39.33% to 61.48%, while still achieving accuracy comparable to models
finetuned on reasoning data generated by R1. These results demonstrate that our
pilot study is inspiring to build more reliable and factual System 2 LRMs.

*Safal Shrestha,Minwu Kim,Aadim Nepal,Anubhav Shrestha,Keith Ross*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段训练策略，通过预热阶段和RLVR训练，在数据稀缺环境下高效开发推理能力强的LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖大量高质量数据，而数据稀缺时效果受限，因此提出一种样本高效的训练策略。

Method: 1. 预热阶段：从玩具领域（K&K逻辑谜题）蒸馏长链思维（Long CoTs）获取通用推理能力；2. 应用RLVR在预热模型上使用少量目标领域数据。

Result: 预热阶段提升通用推理能力，预热后模型在少量数据下表现优于基准模型，且保持跨领域泛化能力，同时提高RLVR训练效率。

Conclusion: 预热策略在数据稀缺环境下构建稳健推理LLMs具有潜力。

Abstract: Designing effective reasoning-capable LLMs typically requires training using
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) or distillation with
carefully curated Long Chain of Thoughts (CoT), both of which depend heavily on
extensive training data. This creates a major challenge when the amount of
quality training data is scarce. We propose a sample-efficient, two-stage
training strategy to develop reasoning LLMs under limited supervision. In the
first stage, we "warm up" the model by distilling Long CoTs from a toy domain,
namely, Knights \& Knaves (K\&K) logic puzzles to acquire general reasoning
skills. In the second stage, we apply RLVR to the warmed-up model using a
limited set of target-domain examples. Our experiments demonstrate that this
two-phase approach offers several benefits: $(i)$ the warmup phase alone
facilitates generalized reasoning, leading to performance improvements across a
range of tasks, including MATH, HumanEval$^{+}$, and MMLU-Pro. $(ii)$ When both
the base model and the warmed-up model are RLVR trained on the same small
dataset ($\leq100$ examples), the warmed-up model consistently outperforms the
base model; $(iii)$ Warming up before RLVR training allows a model to maintain
cross-domain generalizability even after training on a specific domain; $(iv)$
Introducing warmup in the pipeline improves not only accuracy but also overall
sample efficiency during RLVR training. The results in this paper highlight the
promise of warmup for building robust reasoning LLMs in data-scarce
environments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）的元认知能力，提出了一种神经反馈范式来量化LLMs报告和控制其内部激活模式的能力，并揭示了其元认知空间的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社会对LLMs的依赖增加，理解其元认知能力的限制（尤其是监控内部激活的能力）对AI安全至关重要。

Method: 采用神经科学启发的神经反馈范式，通过句子-标签对训练LLMs报告和控制特定神经表示空间方向的激活。

Result: LLMs能够学习报告和控制激活，但性能受示例数量、目标神经方向的语义可解释性及其解释方差的影响。元认知空间维度远低于神经空间。

Conclusion: 研究量化了LLMs的元认知能力，揭示了其局限性，对AI安全具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can sometimes report the strategies they
actually use to solve tasks, but they can also fail to do so. This suggests
some degree of metacognition -- the capacity to monitor one's own cognitive
processes for subsequent reporting and self-control. Metacognitive abilities
enhance AI capabilities but raise safety concerns, as models might obscure
their internal processes to evade neural-activation-based oversight mechanisms
designed to detect harmful behaviors. Given society's increased reliance on
these models, it is critical that we understand the limits of their
metacognitive abilities, particularly their ability to monitor their internal
activations. To address this, we introduce a neuroscience-inspired
neurofeedback paradigm designed to quantify the ability of LLMs to explicitly
report and control their activation patterns. By presenting models with
sentence-label pairs where labels correspond to sentence-elicited internal
activations along specific directions in the neural representation space, we
demonstrate that LLMs can learn to report and control these activations. The
performance varies with several factors: the number of example pairs provided,
the semantic interpretability of the target neural direction, and the variance
explained by that direction. These results reveal a "metacognitive space" with
dimensionality much lower than the model's neural space, suggesting LLMs can
monitor only a subset of their neural mechanisms. Our findings provide
empirical evidence quantifying metacognitive capabilities in LLMs, with
significant implications for AI safety.

TL;DR: 论文提出了CausalPitfalls基准，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）在因果推理中的能力，发现现有模型存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在因果推理任务中表现不足，尤其是在统计陷阱（如Simpson悖论、选择偏差）方面，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 设计CausalPitfalls基准，包含多难度挑战和评分标准，通过直接提示和代码辅助提示两种协议评估LLMs。

Result: 现有LLMs在统计因果推理中存在显著局限性，基准提供了量化指标以改进可信因果推理系统。

Conclusion: CausalPitfalls为提升LLMs的因果推理能力提供了重要指导和量化标准。

Abstract: Reliable causal inference is essential for making decisions in high-stakes
areas like medicine, economics, and public policy. However, it remains unclear
whether large language models (LLMs) can handle rigorous and trustworthy
statistical causal inference. Current benchmarks usually involve simplified
tasks. For example, these tasks might only ask LLMs to identify semantic causal
relationships or draw conclusions directly from raw data. As a result, models
may overlook important statistical pitfalls, such as Simpson's paradox or
selection bias. This oversight limits the applicability of LLMs in the real
world. To address these limitations, we propose CausalPitfalls, a comprehensive
benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the capability of LLMs in overcoming
common causal inference pitfalls. Our benchmark features structured challenges
across multiple difficulty levels, each paired with grading rubrics. This
approach allows us to quantitatively measure both causal reasoning capabilities
and the reliability of LLMs' responses. We evaluate models using two protocols:
(1) direct prompting, which assesses intrinsic causal reasoning, and (2)
code-assisted prompting, where models generate executable code for explicit
statistical analysis. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of this judge
by comparing its scoring with assessments from human experts. Our results
reveal significant limitations in current LLMs when performing statistical
causal inference. The CausalPitfalls benchmark provides essential guidance and
quantitative metrics to advance the development of trustworthy causal reasoning
systems.

Abstract: The exponential rise in mobile device usage necessitates streamlined

to inadequate operational expertise. While manually written knowledge can
bridge this gap, it is often burdensome and inefficient. We introduce
Mobile-Agent-V, an innovative framework that utilizes video as a guiding tool
to effortlessly and efficiently inject operational knowledge into mobile
automation processes. By deriving knowledge directly from video content,
Mobile-Agent-V eliminates manual intervention, significantly reducing the
effort and time required for knowledge acquisition. To rigorously evaluate this
approach, we propose Mobile-Knowledge, a benchmark tailored to assess the
impact of external knowledge on mobile agent performance. Our experimental
findings demonstrate that Mobile-Agent-V enhances performance by 36% compared
to existing methods, underscoring its effortless and efficient advantages in
mobile automation.

improvement, surpassing the strong Claude 3.7 Sonnet with extended thinking on
WindowsAgentArena-V2, an improved benchmark we also released. Furthermore, PC
Agent-E demonstrates strong generalizability to different operating systems on

Abstract: Mental health risk is a critical global public health challenge,
necessitating innovative and reliable assessment methods. With the development
of large language models (LLMs), they stand out to be a promising tool for
explainable mental health care applications. Nevertheless, existing approaches
predominantly rely on subjective textual mental records, which can be distorted
by inherent mental uncertainties, leading to inconsistent and unreliable
predictions. To address these limitations, this paper introduces ProMind-LLM.
We investigate an innovative approach integrating objective behavior data as
complementary information alongside subjective mental records for robust mental
health risk assessment. Specifically, ProMind-LLM incorporates a comprehensive
pipeline that includes domain-specific pretraining to tailor the LLM for mental
health contexts, a self-refine mechanism to optimize the processing of
numerical behavioral data, and causal chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance the
reliability and interpretability of its predictions. Evaluations of two
real-world datasets, PMData and Globem, demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed methods, achieving substantial improvements over general LLMs. We
anticipate that ProMind-LLM will pave the way for more dependable,
interpretable, and scalable mental health case solutions.

Result: 仅需2.4k训练样本即超越基线，在多个QA基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: s3框架高效、轻量且模型无关，显著提升检索增强生成系统的性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems empower large language models
(LLMs) to access external knowledge during inference. Recent advances have
enabled LLMs to act as search agents via reinforcement learning (RL), improving
information acquisition through multi-turn interactions with retrieval engines.
However, existing approaches either optimize retrieval using search-only
metrics (e.g., NDCG) that ignore downstream utility or fine-tune the entire LLM
to jointly reason and retrieve-entangling retrieval with generation and
limiting the real search utility and compatibility with frozen or proprietary
models. In this work, we propose s3, a lightweight, model-agnostic framework
that decouples the searcher from the generator and trains the searcher using a
Gain Beyond RAG reward: the improvement in generation accuracy over naive RAG.
s3 requires only 2.4k training samples to outperform baselines trained on over
70x more data, consistently delivering stronger downstream performance across
six general QA and five medical QA benchmarks.

Result: RLVR牺牲难题准确性，蒸馏需新知识才能提升能力。

Conclusion: 揭示了RLVR和蒸馏对模型推理行为的作用机制。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards
(RLVR) enhances overall accuracy but fails to improve capability, while
distillation can improve both. In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms
behind these phenomena. First, we demonstrate that RLVR does not improve
capability because it focuses on improving the accuracy of the less-difficult
questions to the detriment of the accuracy of the most difficult questions,
thereby leading to no improvement in capability. Second, we find that RLVR does
not merely increase the success probability for the less difficult questions,
but in our small model settings produces quality responses that were absent in
its output distribution before training. In addition, we show these responses
are neither noticeably longer nor feature more reflection-related keywords,
underscoring the need for more reliable indicators of response quality. Third,
we show that while distillation reliably improves accuracy by learning strong
reasoning patterns, it only improves capability when new knowledge is
introduced. Moreover, when distilling only with reasoning patterns and no new
knowledge, the accuracy of the less-difficult questions improves to the
detriment of the most difficult questions, similar to RLVR. Together, these
findings offer a clearer understanding of how RLVR and distillation shape
reasoning behavior in language models.

<details>

Motivation: 高风险的核能和航空行业已采用实时监测，类似地，大型语言模型（LLMs）也需要监测机制以防止有害输出。

Method: 采用无监督方法，将正常行为作为基线，有害输出视为异常，并设计多检测器框架Safety-Net监测不同表征维度。

Result: Safety-Net在检测有害行为时准确率达96%，即使信息在表征空间中转移以规避监测。

Conclusion: 研究表明，模型可通过因果机制生成有害内容并具有欺骗性，但Safety-Net能有效应对这些挑战。

Abstract: High-risk industries like nuclear and aviation use real-time monitoring to
detect dangerous system conditions. Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs)
need monitoring safeguards. We propose a real-time framework to predict harmful
AI outputs before they occur by using an unsupervised approach that treats
normal behavior as the baseline and harmful outputs as outliers. Our study
focuses specifically on backdoor-triggered responses -- where specific input
phrases activate hidden vulnerabilities causing the model to generate unsafe
content like violence, pornography, or hate speech. We address two key
challenges: (1) identifying true causal indicators rather than surface
correlations, and (2) preventing advanced models from deception -- deliberately
evading monitoring systems. Hence, we approach this problem from an
unsupervised lens by drawing parallels to human deception: just as humans
exhibit physical indicators while lying, we investigate whether LLMs display
distinct internal behavioral signatures when generating harmful content. Our
study addresses two critical challenges: 1) designing monitoring systems that
capture true causal indicators rather than superficial correlations; and
2)preventing intentional evasion by increasingly capable "Future models''. Our
findings show that models can produce harmful content through causal mechanisms
and can become deceptive by: (a) alternating between linear and non-linear
representations, and (b) modifying feature relationships. To counter this, we
developed Safety-Net -- a multi-detector framework that monitors different
representation dimensions, successfully detecting harmful behavior even when
information is shifted across representational spaces to evade individual
monitors. Our evaluation shows 96% accuracy in detecting harmful cases using
our unsupervised ensemble approach.

Motivation: 现有基础模型（如大语言模型）缺乏因果推理能力，且真实世界中反事实评估困难，仅能依赖合成数据。

Method: 采用图检索增强生成代理提取因果关系，构建真实世界因果网络，并设计反事实推理代理进行逐步因果推断。

Result: 方法能有效提取因果知识，提升大语言模型的因果推理鲁棒性，同时降低推理成本和虚假相关性。

Conclusion: Causal Cartographer框架为解决因果推理问题提供了可行方案，尤其在真实世界应用中表现出潜力。

Abstract: Causal world models are systems that can answer counterfactual questions
about an environment of interest, i.e. predict how it would have evolved if an
arbitrary subset of events had been realized differently. It requires
understanding the underlying causes behind chains of events and conducting
causal inference for arbitrary unseen distributions. So far, this task eludes
foundation models, notably large language models (LLMs), which do not have
demonstrated causal reasoning capabilities beyond the memorization of existing
causal relationships. Furthermore, evaluating counterfactuals in real-world
applications is challenging since only the factual world is observed, limiting
evaluation to synthetic datasets. We address these problems by explicitly
extracting and modeling causal relationships and propose the Causal
Cartographer framework. First, we introduce a graph retrieval-augmented
generation agent tasked to retrieve causal relationships from data. This
approach allows us to construct a large network of real-world causal
relationships that can serve as a repository of causal knowledge and build
real-world counterfactuals. In addition, we create a counterfactual reasoning
agent constrained by causal relationships to perform reliable step-by-step
causal inference. We show that our approach can extract causal knowledge and
improve the robustness of LLMs for causal reasoning tasks while reducing
inference costs and spurious correlations.

Result: 在文本分类、简化和摘要任务中达到SOTA，分类任务超越APE 2.58%和EvoPrompt 1.00%，摘要任务ROUGE分数提升4.32和2.12，简化任务SARI分数提升6.93和6.01。

Conclusion: PRL为自动提示生成提供了高效解决方案，显著提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Effective prompt engineering remains a central challenge in fully harnessing
the capabilities of LLMs. While well-designed prompts can dramatically enhance
performance, crafting them typically demands expert intuition and a nuanced
understanding of the task. Moreover, the most impactful prompts often hinge on
subtle semantic cues, ones that may elude human perception but are crucial for
guiding LLM behavior. In this paper, we introduce PRL (Prompts from
Reinforcement Learning), a novel RL-based approach for automatic prompt
generation. Unlike previous methods, PRL can produce novel few-shot examples
that were not seen during training. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across a range of benchmarks, including text classification,
simplification, and summarization. On the classification task, it surpasses
prior methods by 2.58% over APE and 1.00% over EvoPrompt. Additionally, it
improves the average ROUGE scores on the summarization task by 4.32 over APE
and by 2.12 over EvoPrompt and the SARI score on simplification by 6.93 over
APE and by 6.01 over EvoPrompt. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 通过生成可证明正确的结论，可以显著提升LLMs的可靠性、准确性和一致性，适用于复杂任务和关键应用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with formal domains that require
rigorous logical deduction and symbolic reasoning, such as mathematical proof
generation. We propose a neuro-symbolic approach that combines LLMs' generative
strengths with structured components to overcome this challenge. As a
proof-of-concept, we focus on geometry problems. Our approach is two-fold: (1)
we retrieve analogous problems and use their proofs to guide the LLM, and (2) a
formal verifier evaluates the generated proofs and provides feedback, helping
the model fix incorrect proofs. We demonstrate that our method significantly
improves proof accuracy for OpenAI's o1 model (58%-70% improvement); both
analogous problems and the verifier's feedback contribute to these gains. More
broadly, shifting to LLMs that generate provably correct conclusions could
dramatically improve their reliability, accuracy and consistency, unlocking
complex tasks and critical real-world applications that require
trustworthiness.

Method: 对六个推理模型在六个数据集上进行基准测试，分析其信心校准表现。

Result: 推理模型在36种设置中的33种下表现优于非推理模型，信心校准更优。

Conclusion: 慢思考行为（如探索替代方案和回溯）是推理模型信心校准提升的关键。

Abstract: Despite their strengths, large language models (LLMs) often fail to
communicate their confidence accurately, making it difficult to assess when
they might be wrong and limiting their reliability. In this work, we
demonstrate that reasoning models-LLMs that engage in extended chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning-exhibit superior performance not only in problem-solving but
also in accurately expressing their confidence. Specifically, we benchmark six
reasoning models across six datasets and find that they achieve strictly better
confidence calibration than their non-reasoning counterparts in 33 out of the
36 settings. Our detailed analysis reveals that these gains in calibration stem
from the slow thinking behaviors of reasoning models-such as exploring
alternative approaches and backtracking-which enable them to adjust their
confidence dynamically throughout their CoT, making it progressively more
accurate. In particular, we find that reasoning models become increasingly
better calibrated as their CoT unfolds, a trend not observed in non-reasoning
models. Moreover, removing slow thinking behaviors from the CoT leads to a
significant drop in calibration. Lastly, we show that these gains are not
exclusive to reasoning models-non-reasoning models also benefit when guided to
perform slow thinking via in-context learning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Agent Context Protocols (ACPs)的结构化协议，用于多智能体系统的通信与协作，显著提升了通用智能系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统的协调依赖自然语言，限制了复杂交互和领域特定智能体的互操作性。

Method: ACPs结合了持久执行蓝图和标准化消息模式，支持鲁棒且容错的多智能体协同推理。

Result: ACP驱动的系统在长周期网络辅助和多模态技术报告任务中达到SOTA性能，优于商业AI系统。

Conclusion: ACPs具有高度模块化和可扩展性，能快速构建顶级通用智能体。

Abstract: AI agents have become increasingly adept at complex tasks such as coding,
reasoning, and multimodal understanding. However, building generalist systems
requires moving beyond individual agents to collective inference -- a paradigm
where multi-agent systems with diverse, task-specialized agents complement one
another through structured communication and collaboration. Today, coordination
is usually handled with imprecise, ad-hoc natural language, which limits
complex interaction and hinders interoperability with domain-specific agents.
We introduce Agent context protocols (ACPs): a domain- and agent-agnostic
family of structured protocols for agent-agent communication, coordination, and
error handling. ACPs combine (i) persistent execution blueprints -- explicit
dependency graphs that store intermediate agent outputs -- with (ii)
standardized message schemas, enabling robust and fault-tolerant multi-agent
collective inference. ACP-powered generalist systems reach state-of-the-art
performance: 28.3 % accuracy on AssistantBench for long-horizon web assistance
and best-in-class multimodal technical reports, outperforming commercial AI
systems in human evaluation. ACPs are highly modular and extensible, allowing
practitioners to build top-tier generalist agents quickly.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SATBench是一个通过布尔可满足性问题（SAT）生成的逻辑谜题基准，用于评估大型语言模型（LLMs）的逻辑推理能力。实验显示，当前最强模型在困难问题上表现接近随机基线，揭示了LLMs在搜索式逻辑推理中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注基于推理规则的逻辑推理，而SATBench旨在通过SAT问题的搜索特性，更全面地评估LLMs的逻辑能力。

Method: SATBench从SAT公式生成逻辑谜题，并通过LLMs将其转化为故事背景和条件。生成过程自动化，难度可调，并通过LLM辅助和求解器验证一致性。

Result: 实验表明，最强模型o4-mini在困难UNSAT问题上仅达到65.0%准确率，接近50%的随机基线。

Conclusion: SATBench揭示了当前LLMs在搜索式逻辑推理中的根本局限，为未来逻辑推理研究提供了可扩展的测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce SATBench, a benchmark for evaluating the logical reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) through logical puzzles derived
from Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems. Unlike prior work that focuses on
inference rule-based reasoning, which often involves deducing conclusions from
a set of premises, our approach leverages the search-based nature of SAT
problems, where the objective is to find a solution that fulfills a specified
set of logical constraints. Each instance in SATBench is generated from a SAT
formula, then translated into a story context and conditions using LLMs. The
generation process is fully automated and allows for adjustable difficulty by
varying the number of clauses. All 2100 puzzles are validated through both
LLM-assisted and solver-based consistency checks, with human validation on a
subset. Experimental results show that even the strongest model, o4-mini,
achieves only 65.0% accuracy on hard UNSAT problems, close to the random
baseline of 50%. SATBench exposes fundamental limitations in the search-based
logical reasoning abilities of current LLMs and provides a scalable testbed for
future research in logical reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了在多模态环境下通过辩论机制实现弱模型监督强模型的方法，实验表明该框架优于单个专家模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLMs）能力的提升，人类监督的难度增加，辩论机制成为一种潜在的解决方案。

Method: 在多模态视觉问答（VQA）任务中，两个视觉语言专家模型进行辩论，由纯文本模型担任裁判。

Result: 辩论框架在多个多模态任务中表现优于单个专家模型，且弱模型的判断可通过微调提升视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Conclusion: 辩论机制在多模态监督中具有潜力，能够提升模型性能并增强推理能力。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain expertise across diverse domains and
modalities, scalable oversight becomes increasingly challenging, particularly
when their capabilities may surpass human evaluators. Debate has emerged as a
promising mechanism for enabling such oversight. In this work, we extend the
debate paradigm to a multimodal setting, exploring its potential for weaker
models to supervise and enhance the performance of stronger models. We focus on
visual question answering (VQA), where two "sighted" expert vision-language
models debate an answer, while a "blind" (text-only) judge adjudicates based
solely on the quality of the arguments. In our framework, the experts defend
only answers aligned with their beliefs, thereby obviating the need for
explicit role-playing and concentrating the debate on instances of expert
disagreement. Experiments on several multimodal tasks demonstrate that the
debate framework consistently outperforms individual expert models. Moreover,
judgments from weaker LLMs can help instill reasoning capabilities in
vision-language models through finetuning.

*Wonje Jeung,Sangyeon Yoon,Minsuk Kahng,Albert No*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SAFEPATH是一种轻量级对齐方法，通过在有害提示下生成简短的安全提示，有效减少有害输出并保持推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法在减少有害输出的同时会降低推理深度，且易受高级越狱攻击，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: SAFEPATH通过微调LRMs，使其在有害提示下生成8个token的安全提示，其余推理过程不受监督。

Result: SAFEPATH减少90%有害输出，阻止83.3%越狱攻击，计算量比现有方法低295.9倍。

Conclusion: SAFEPATH在保持推理性能的同时显著提升安全性，为零样本安全对齐提供新方向。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have become powerful tools for complex problem
solving, but their structured reasoning pathways can lead to unsafe outputs
when exposed to harmful prompts. Existing safety alignment methods reduce
harmful outputs but can degrade reasoning depth, leading to significant
trade-offs in complex, multi-step tasks, and remain vulnerable to sophisticated
jailbreak attacks. To address this, we introduce SAFEPATH, a lightweight
alignment method that fine-tunes LRMs to emit a short, 8-token Safety Primer at
the start of their reasoning, in response to harmful prompts, while leaving the
rest of the reasoning process unsupervised. Empirical results across multiple
benchmarks indicate that SAFEPATH effectively reduces harmful outputs while
maintaining reasoning performance. Specifically, SAFEPATH reduces harmful
responses by up to 90.0% and blocks 83.3% of jailbreak attempts in the
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B model, while requiring 295.9x less compute than
Direct Refusal and 314.1x less than SafeChain. We further introduce a zero-shot
variant that requires no fine-tuning. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
analysis of how existing methods in LLMs generalize, or fail, when applied to
reasoning-centric models, revealing critical gaps and new directions for safer
AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动代理依赖封闭环境观察或基于规则的主动通知，导致用户意图理解不足和功能受限。

Method: ContextAgent从可穿戴设备的多维感知数据中提取上下文，结合历史数据预测主动服务需求，并自动调用工具。

Result: 在ContextAgentBench上，ContextAgent在主动预测和工具调用上分别比基线高8.5%和6.0%。

Conclusion: ContextAgent为开发更先进、以人为中心的主动AI助手提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have propelled intelligent
agents from reactive responses to proactive support. While promising, existing
proactive agents either rely exclusively on observations from enclosed
environments (e.g., desktop UIs) with direct LLM inference or employ rule-based
proactive notifications, leading to suboptimal user intent understanding and
limited functionality for proactive service. In this paper, we introduce
ContextAgent, the first context-aware proactive agent that incorporates
extensive sensory contexts to enhance the proactive capabilities of LLM agents.
ContextAgent first extracts multi-dimensional contexts from massive sensory
perceptions on wearables (e.g., video and audio) to understand user intentions.
ContextAgent then leverages the sensory contexts and the persona contexts from
historical data to predict the necessity for proactive services. When proactive
assistance is needed, ContextAgent further automatically calls the necessary
tools to assist users unobtrusively. To evaluate this new task, we curate
ContextAgentBench, the first benchmark for evaluating context-aware proactive
LLM agents, covering 1,000 samples across nine daily scenarios and twenty
tools. Experiments on ContextAgentBench show that ContextAgent outperforms
baselines by achieving up to 8.5% and 6.0% higher accuracy in proactive
predictions and tool calling, respectively. We hope our research can inspire
the development of more advanced, human-centric, proactive AI assistants.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖历史会话数据，但难以捕捉用户意图的动态变化，因此探索未来上下文信息的整合以优化排序。

Method: 提出双模型优化框架（ForeRanker），包括历史条件模型和未来感知模型，通过监督标签和伪标签协作训练，并引入动态门控机制减少训练不一致性。

Result: 在基准数据集上验证了ForeRanker的优越性，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 整合未来上下文信息能显著提升文档排序效果，动态门控机制有效解决了训练不一致问题。

Abstract: In the realm of information retrieval, users often engage in multi-turn
interactions with search engines to acquire information, leading to the
formation of sequences of user feedback behaviors. Leveraging the session
context has proven to be beneficial for inferring user search intent and
document ranking. A multitude of approaches have been proposed to exploit
in-session context for improved document ranking. Despite these advances, the
limitation of historical session data for capturing evolving user intent
remains a challenge. In this work, we explore the integration of future
contextual information into the session context to enhance document ranking. We
present the siamese model optimization framework, comprising a
history-conditioned model and a future-aware model. The former processes only
the historical behavior sequence, while the latter integrates both historical
and anticipated future behaviors. Both models are trained collaboratively using
the supervised labels and pseudo labels predicted by the other. The
history-conditioned model, referred to as ForeRanker, progressively learns
future-relevant information to enhance ranking, while it singly uses historical
session at inference time. To mitigate inconsistencies during training, we
introduce the peer knowledge distillation method with a dynamic gating
mechanism, allowing models to selectively incorporate contextual information.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
ForeRanker, showcasing its superior performance compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前嵌入模型在医学文档语义捕捉、长文本处理和多领域适应性方面存在局限，需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: MedEIR结合ALiBi长上下文处理技术，预训练6B tokens并微调3M句子对，支持8,192 tokens序列。

Result: MedEIR在MTEB基准测试中表现优异，多个任务得分领先，如ArguAna（55.24）、MedicalQARetrieval（74.25）等。

Conclusion: MedEIR展示了在通用和领域特定任务中的高效性能，是现有嵌入模型的强有力替代方案。

Abstract: Embedding models have become essential for retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) tasks, semantic clustering, and text re-ranking. But despite their
growing use, many of these come with notable limitations. For example, Jina
fails to capture the semantic content of medical documents, while models such
as MiniLM often perform poorly on long-form documents. Domain-adapted models,
while specialized, often underperform in general-purpose tasks, reducing their
overall applicability. General-domain tokenizers often misinterpret medical
vocabulary. The limitations of current embedding models, whether in
tokenization accuracy, domain comprehension, or handling long sequences,
highlight the need for more versatile solutions. In this work, we present
MedEIR, a novel embedding model and tokenizer jointly optimized for both
medical and general NLP tasks, incorporating ALiBi-based long-context
processing to support sequences of up to 8,192 tokens. MedEIR was pre-trained
on only 6 billion tokens, significantly fewer than Jina's, followed by
fine-tuning on 3 million sentence pairs. MedEIR consistently outperforms Jina
V2 and MiniLM across MTEB benchmarks, achieving top scores on ArguAna (55.24),
NFCorpus (38.44), MedicalQARetrieval (74.25), SciFact (72.04), and TRECCOVID
(79.56). These results highlight the potential of MedEIR as a highly effective
embedding model, demonstrating strong performance across both general-purpose
and domain-specific tasks and outperforming existing models on multiple
benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的内容审核面临灵活性和适应性不足的挑战，需要快速响应新兴威胁的解决方案。

Method: 利用检索增强生成（RAG）架构，通过在向量数据库中插入和标记恶意文档，动态识别并拒绝有害请求。

Result: 初步结果显示，RAR性能与Claude 3.5 Sonnet等模型的嵌入式审核相当，同时具备更高的灵活性和实时定制能力。

Conclusion: RAR无需改变现有RAG系统架构，仅需添加特殊文档和基于检索结果的简单拒绝机制，为内容审核提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Content moderation for large language models (LLMs) remains a significant
challenge, requiring flexible and adaptable solutions that can quickly respond
to emerging threats. This paper introduces Retrieval Augmented Rejection (RAR),
a novel approach that leverages a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
architecture to dynamically reject unsafe user queries without model
retraining. By strategically inserting and marking malicious documents into the
vector database, the system can identify and reject harmful requests when these
documents are retrieved. Our preliminary results show that RAR achieves
comparable performance to embedded moderation in LLMs like Claude 3.5 Sonnet,
while offering superior flexibility and real-time customization capabilities, a
fundamental feature to timely address critical vulnerabilities. This approach
introduces no architectural changes to existing RAG systems, requiring only the
addition of specially crafted documents and a simple rejection mechanism based
on retrieval results.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CoRank的无训练、模型无关的框架，通过紧凑文档表示解决科学检索中LLM列表重排的挑战，显著提升了重排性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学检索中，第一阶段的检索结果往往不理想，且传统列表重排方法因上下文窗口限制无法处理大量候选文档，导致相关文档被排除。

Method: CoRank框架分为三阶段：(i)离线提取文档级特征，(ii)基于紧凑表示的粗排，(iii)对粗排结果进行细粒度全文重排。

Result: 在LitSearch和CSFCube上的实验显示，CoRank将nDCG@10从32.0提升至39.7。

Conclusion: 信息提取对科学检索中的重排具有重要价值，CoRank框架有效提升了性能。

Abstract: Scientific retrieval is essential for advancing academic discovery. Within
this process, document reranking plays a critical role by refining first-stage
retrieval results. However, large language model (LLM) listwise reranking faces
unique challenges in the scientific domain. First-stage retrieval is often
suboptimal in the scientific domain, so relevant documents are ranked lower.
Moreover, conventional listwise reranking uses the full text of candidate
documents in the context window, limiting the number of candidates that can be
considered. As a result, many relevant documents are excluded before reranking,
which constrains overall retrieval performance. To address these challenges, we
explore compact document representations based on semantic features such as
categories, sections, and keywords, and propose a training-free, model-agnostic
reranking framework for scientific retrieval called CoRank. The framework
involves three stages: (i) offline extraction of document-level features, (ii)
coarse reranking using these compact representations, and (iii) fine-grained
reranking on full texts of the top candidates from stage (ii). This hybrid
design provides a high-level abstraction of document semantics, expands
candidate coverage, and retains critical details required for precise ranking.
Experiments on LitSearch and CSFCube show that CoRank significantly improves
reranking performance across different LLM backbones, increasing nDCG@10 from
32.0 to 39.7. Overall, these results highlight the value of information
extraction for reranking in scientific retrieval.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经重排序模型虽然效果显著，但资源消耗大，需要优化以提升效率和可扩展性。

Method: 提出Rank-K模型，利用推理语言模型的能力，在查询时进行列表式段落重排序。

Result: Rank-K在BM25和SPLADE-v3初始排序基础上，分别提升23%和19%的检索效果，且在多语言检索中表现一致。

Conclusion: Rank-K在提升检索效果的同时，具备多语言处理能力，为资源密集型任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieve-and-rerank is a popular retrieval pipeline because of its ability to
make slow but effective rerankers efficient enough at query time by reducing
the number of comparisons. Recent works in neural rerankers take advantage of
large language models for their capability in reasoning between queries and
passages and have achieved state-of-the-art retrieval effectiveness. However,
such rerankers are resource-intensive, even after heavy optimization. In this
work, we introduce Rank-K, a listwise passage reranking model that leverages
the reasoning capability of the reasoning language model at query time that
provides test time scalability to serve hard queries. We show that Rank-K
improves retrieval effectiveness by 23\% over the RankZephyr, the
state-of-the-art listwise reranker, when reranking a BM25 initial ranked list
and 19\% when reranking strong retrieval results by SPLADE-v3. Since Rank-K is
inherently a multilingual model, we found that it ranks passages based on
queries in different languages as effectively as it does in monolingual
retrieval.

TL;DR: NExT-Search提出了一种新的生成式AI搜索范式，通过引入细粒度的过程级反馈，解决传统反馈循环断开的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI搜索虽然便捷，但缺乏传统Web搜索的细粒度反馈机制，导致难以持续改进。

Method: NExT-Search设计了两种模式：用户调试模式和影子用户模式，结合在线适应和离线更新机制。

Result: 通过恢复用户对搜索流程的控制，NExT-Search有望实现持续优化的AI搜索系统。

Conclusion: NExT-Search为构建反馈丰富的AI搜索系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Generative AI search is reshaping information retrieval by offering
end-to-end answers to complex queries, reducing users' reliance on manually
browsing and summarizing multiple web pages. However, while this paradigm
enhances convenience, it disrupts the feedback-driven improvement loop that has
historically powered the evolution of traditional Web search. Web search can
continuously improve their ranking models by collecting large-scale,
fine-grained user feedback (e.g., clicks, dwell time) at the document level. In
contrast, generative AI search operates through a much longer search pipeline,
spanning query decomposition, document retrieval, and answer generation, yet
typically receives only coarse-grained feedback on the final answer. This
introduces a feedback loop disconnect, where user feedback for the final output
cannot be effectively mapped back to specific system components, making it
difficult to improve each intermediate stage and sustain the feedback loop. In
this paper, we envision NExT-Search, a next-generation paradigm designed to
reintroduce fine-grained, process-level feedback into generative AI search.
NExT-Search integrates two complementary modes: User Debug Mode, which allows
engaged users to intervene at key stages; and Shadow User Mode, where a
personalized user agent simulates user preferences and provides AI-assisted
feedback for less interactive users. Furthermore, we envision how these
feedback signals can be leveraged through online adaptation, which refines
current search outputs in real-time, and offline update, which aggregates
interaction logs to periodically fine-tune query decomposition, retrieval, and
generation models. By restoring human control over key stages of the generative
AI search pipeline, we believe NExT-Search offers a promising direction for
building feedback-rich AI search systems that can evolve continuously alongside
human feedback.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多步任务中表现优异，但在多次尝试中性能不稳定。现有搜索技术（如MCTS）不适用于非序列化环境，需探索新方法。

Method: 提出两种搜索策略：1步前瞻和轨迹选择，基于学习的动作价值函数估计器指导。在SWE-bench Verified基准测试中验证。

Result: Qwen-72B模型的平均成功率翻倍至40.8%，并证明方法可迁移至GPT-4o等先进模型。

Conclusion: 提出的搜索策略显著提升了LLMs在非序列化环境中的性能，且具有通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable results in
complex multi-step tasks, such as mathematical reasoning and agentic software
engineering. However, they often struggle to maintain consistent performance
across multiple solution attempts. One effective approach to narrow the gap
between average-case and best-case performance is guided test-time search,
which explores multiple solution paths to identify the most promising one.
Unfortunately, effective search techniques (e.g. MCTS) are often unsuitable for
non-serializable RL environments, such as Docker containers, where intermediate
environment states cannot be easily saved and restored. We investigate two
complementary search strategies applicable to such environments: 1-step
lookahead and trajectory selection, both guided by a learned action-value
function estimator. On the SWE-bench Verified benchmark, a key testbed for
agentic software engineering, we find these methods to double the average
success rate of a fine-tuned Qwen-72B model, achieving 40.8%, the new
state-of-the-art for open-weights models. Additionally, we show that these
techniques are transferable to more advanced closed models, yielding similar
improvements with GPT-4o.

Method: 综述了LLMs在SQA中的应用（如需求验证、缺陷检测等），并将其映射到ISO/IEC等标准框架中。

Result: 案例研究表明LLMs在SQA中具有实际可行性，但也面临数据隐私、模型偏见等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来方向包括自适应学习、隐私保护部署和多模态分析，需制定AI驱动的软件质量标准。

Abstract: Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is critical for delivering reliable, secure,
and efficient software products. The Software Quality Assurance Process aims to
provide assurance that work products and processes comply with predefined
provisions and plans. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs)
present new opportunities to enhance existing SQA processes by automating tasks
like requirement analysis, code review, test generation, and compliance checks.
Simultaneously, established standards such as ISO/IEC 12207, ISO/IEC 25010,
ISO/IEC 5055, ISO 9001/ISO/IEC 90003, CMMI, and TMM provide structured
frameworks for ensuring robust quality practices. This paper surveys the
intersection of LLM-based SQA methods and these recognized standards,
highlighting how AI-driven solutions can augment traditional approaches while
maintaining compliance and process maturity. We first review the foundational
software quality standards and the technical fundamentals of LLMs in software
engineering. Next, we explore various LLM-based SQA applications, including
requirement validation, defect detection, test generation, and documentation
maintenance. We then map these applications to key software quality frameworks,
illustrating how LLMs can address specific requirements and metrics within each
standard. Empirical case studies and open-source initiatives demonstrate the
practical viability of these methods. At the same time, discussions on
challenges (e.g., data privacy, model bias, explainability) underscore the need
for deliberate governance and auditing. Finally, we propose future directions
encompassing adaptive learning, privacy-focused deployments, multimodal
analysis, and evolving standards for AI-driven software quality.

Abstract: Multi-scale deformable attention (MSDA) is a flexible and powerful feature
extraction mechanism for visual tasks, but its random-access grid sampling
strategy poses significant optimization challenges, especially on
domain-specific accelerators such as NPUs. In this work, we present a co-design
approach that systematically rethinks memory access and computation strategies
for MSDA on the Ascend NPU architecture. With this co-design approach, our
implementation supports both efficient forward and backward computation, is
fully adapted for training workloads, and incorporates a suite of
hardware-aware optimizations. Extensive experiments show that our solution
achieves up to $5.9\times$ (forward), $8.9\times$ (backward), and $7.3\times$
(end-to-end training) speedup over the grid sample-based baseline, and
$1.9\times$, $2.4\times$, and $2.0\times$ acceleration over the latest vendor
library, respectively.

*Tianle Yang,Chengzhe Sun,Siwei Lyu,Phil Rose*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 利用语音的声学特征检测深度伪造音频，发现局部特征比全局特征更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索可解释的声学特征在检测深度伪造音频中的潜力，因其与人类发音过程密切相关且难以被伪造。

Method: 分析语音的局部声学特征，尤其是常用于法医语音比较的特征。

Result: 某些局部特征能有效识别深度伪造音频，而全局特征效果较差。

Conclusion: 需针对法医语音比较调整检测方法，局部特征为音频伪造检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: This study explores the potential of using acoustic features of segmental
speech sounds to detect deepfake audio. These features are highly interpretable
because of their close relationship with human articulatory processes and are
expected to be more difficult for deepfake models to replicate. The results
demonstrate that certain segmental features commonly used in forensic voice
comparison are effective in identifying deep-fakes, whereas some global
features provide little value. These findings underscore the need to approach
audio deepfake detection differently for forensic voice comparison and offer a
new perspective on leveraging segmental features for this purpose.

Motivation: 藏语作为低资源语言，缺乏多方言平行语音语料库，限制了语音建模的进展。

Method: 提出FMSD-TTS框架，包含说话人-方言融合模块和DSDR-Net网络，以捕捉方言间的声学和语言差异。

Result: FMSD-TTS在方言表达和说话人相似性上显著优于基线，并通过语音转换任务验证了合成语音的质量。

Conclusion: FMSD-TTS为藏语多方言语音合成提供了有效解决方案，并公开了合成语料库和评估工具包。

Abstract: Tibetan is a low-resource language with minimal parallel speech corpora
spanning its three major dialects-\"U-Tsang, Amdo, and Kham-limiting progress
in speech modeling. To address this issue, we propose FMSD-TTS, a few-shot,
multi-speaker, multi-dialect text-to-speech framework that synthesizes parallel
dialectal speech from limited reference audio and explicit dialect labels. Our
method features a novel speaker-dialect fusion module and a Dialect-Specialized
Dynamic Routing Network (DSDR-Net) to capture fine-grained acoustic and
linguistic variations across dialects while preserving speaker identity.
Extensive objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that FMSD-TTS
significantly outperforms baselines in both dialectal expressiveness and
speaker similarity. We further validate the quality and utility of the
synthesized speech through a challenging speech-to-speech dialect conversion
task. Our contributions include: (1) a novel few-shot TTS system tailored for
Tibetan multi-dialect speech synthesis, (2) the public release of a large-scale
synthetic Tibetan speech corpus generated by FMSD-TTS, and (3) an open-source
evaluation toolkit for standardized assessment of speaker similarity, dialect
consistency, and audio quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语音数据预处理和标注的对话系统，用于预测对话个性，其表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于语音数据中缺乏个性标注，个性感知对话系统研究不足。

Method: 通过ASR提取转录和时间戳，生成对话级标注，并利用大语言模型预测个性。

Result: 系统表现优于现有方法，与人类判断更一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性感知对话系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in neural spoken dialog systems,
personality-aware conversation agents -- capable of adapting behavior based on
personalities -- remain underexplored due to the absence of personality
annotations in speech datasets. We propose a pipeline that preprocesses raw
audio recordings to create a dialogue dataset annotated with timestamps,
response types, and emotion/sentiment labels. We employ an automatic speech
recognition (ASR) system to extract transcripts and timestamps, then generate
conversation-level annotations. Leveraging these annotations, we design a
system that employs large language models to predict conversational
personality. Human evaluators were engaged to identify conversational
characteristics and assign personality labels. Our analysis demonstrates that
the proposed system achieves stronger alignment with human judgments compared
to existing approaches.

Conclusion: S2SBench能有效量化语音LLMs的性能退化，为研究提供工具支持。

Abstract: End-to-end speech large language models ((LLMs)) extend the capabilities of
text-based models to directly process and generate audio tokens. However, this
often leads to a decline in reasoning and generation performance compared to
text input, a phenomenon referred to as intelligence degradation. To
systematically evaluate this gap, we propose S2SBench, a benchmark designed to
quantify performance degradation in Speech LLMs. It includes diagnostic
datasets targeting sentence continuation and commonsense reasoning under audio
input. We further introduce a pairwise evaluation protocol based on perplexity
differences between plausible and implausible samples to measure degradation
relative to text input. We apply S2SBench to analyze the training process of
Baichuan-Audio, which further demonstrates the benchmark's effectiveness. All
datasets and evaluation code are available at

Abstract: We present PAST, a novel end-to-end framework that jointly models phonetic
information alongside signal reconstruction, eliminating the need for external
pretrained models. Unlike previous approaches that rely on pretrained
self-supervised models, PAST employs supervised phonetic data, directly
integrating domain knowledge into the tokenization process via auxiliary tasks.
Additionally, we introduce a streamable, causal variant of PAST, enabling
real-time speech applications. Results demonstrate that PAST surpasses existing
evaluated baseline tokenizers across common evaluation metrics, including
phonetic representation and speech reconstruction. Notably, PAST also achieves
superior performance when serving as a speech representation for speech
language models, further highlighting its effectiveness as a foundation for
spoken language generation. To foster further research, we release the full
implementation. For code, model checkpoints, and samples see:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多角色交互动画在角色动画中具有挑战性和重要性，但现有方法（如单角色动画、基于深度学习的双角色交互合成、基于优化的方法以及人群模拟）无法有效处理多角色间的紧密交互和过渡规划问题。

Method: 提出了一种条件生成管道，包括一个可协调的多角色交互空间用于交互合成，以及一个过渡规划网络用于协调过渡。

Result: 实验证明了该方法在多角色交互合成中的有效性，并展示了其可扩展性和可迁移性。

Conclusion: 该方法为多角色交互动画的生成提供了一种有效的解决方案，解决了数据缺乏和过渡规划的挑战。

Abstract: Generating large-scale multi-character interactions is a challenging and
important task in character animation. Multi-character interactions involve not
only natural interactive motions but also characters coordinated with each
other for transition. For example, a dance scenario involves characters dancing
with partners and also characters coordinated to new partners based on spatial
and temporal observations. We term such transitions as coordinated interactions
and decompose them into interaction synthesis and transition planning. Previous
methods of single-character animation do not consider interactions that are
critical for multiple characters. Deep-learning-based interaction synthesis
usually focuses on two characters and does not consider transition planning.
Optimization-based interaction synthesis relies on manually designing objective
functions that may not generalize well. While crowd simulation involves more
characters, their interactions are sparse and passive. We identify two
challenges to multi-character interaction synthesis, including the lack of data
and the planning of transitions among close and dense interactions. Existing
datasets either do not have multiple characters or do not have close and dense
interactions. The planning of transitions for multi-character close and dense
interactions needs both spatial and temporal considerations. We propose a
conditional generative pipeline comprising a coordinatable multi-character
interaction space for interaction synthesis and a transition planning network
for coordinations. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed pipeline for multicharacter interaction synthesis and the applications
facilitated by our method show the scalability and transferability.

Method: 结合前向后向优化算法与ULA步骤的PSGLA方法。

Result: PSGLA在非凸势能下收敛，且在实验中表现出比SGLA更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: PSGLA是一种有效的非凸势能采样方法，具有快速收敛和恢复特性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling distributions stemming from non-convex
potentials with Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). We prove the stability of
the discrete-time ULA to drift approximations under the assumption that the
potential is strongly convex at infinity. In many context, e.g. imaging inverse
problems, potentials are non-convex and non-smooth. Proximal Stochastic
Gradient Langevin Algorithm (PSGLA) is a popular algorithm to handle such
potentials. It combines the forward-backward optimization algorithm with a ULA
step. Our main stability result combined with properties of the Moreau envelope
allows us to derive the first proof of convergence of the PSGLA for non-convex
potentials. We empirically validate our methodology on synthetic data and in
the context of imaging inverse problems. In particular, we observe that PSGLA
exhibits faster convergence rates than Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm
for posterior sampling while preserving its restoration properties.

Motivation: 现有方法在模型引导中缺乏理论支持，导致性能不佳。本文旨在填补这一空白，提供理论框架和实践方法。

Method: 提出DRRho风险最小化框架，基于DRO理论，并结合对比学习与DRO的联系，设计了DRRho-CLIP方法。

Result: 理论分析表明该方法能提升泛化能力和数据效率；实验验证了其优于无参考模型的CLIP和现有启发式方法。

Conclusion: 本文首次为模型引导提供了理论支持，提出的DRRho框架和DRRho-CLIP方法在实践中表现出显著优势。

Abstract: This paper formalizes an emerging learning paradigm that uses a trained model
as a reference to guide and enhance the training of a target model through
strategic data selection or weighting, named $\textbf{model steering}$. While
ad-hoc methods have been used in various contexts, including the training of
large foundation models, its underlying principles remain insufficiently
understood, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this work, we propose a
theory-driven framework for model steering called $\textbf{DRRho risk
minimization}$, which is rooted in Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO).
Through a generalization analysis, we provide theoretical insights into why
this approach improves generalization and data efficiency compared to training
without a reference model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
such theoretical insights are provided for the new learning paradigm, which
significantly enhance our understanding and practice of model steering.
Building on these insights and the connection between contrastive learning and
DRO, we introduce a novel method for Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP) with a reference model, termed DRRho-CLIP. Extensive experiments
validate the theoretical insights, reveal a superior scaling law compared to
CLIP without a reference model, and demonstrate its strength over existing
heuristic approaches.

Motivation: 现有BNN研究主要关注模型权重和激活，而忽略了输入原始数据的优化。本文旨在通过改进输入数据表示提升BNN性能。

Method: 提出GLT编码技术，学习非线性量化阈值；结合轻量级分组卷积、块剪枝和知识蒸馏（KD）技术，优化模型。

Result: GLT在STL-10和VWW数据集上显著提升准确性；结合块剪枝技术，实现了轻量级（小于1Mb）全二值化模型。

Conclusion: GLT为BNN提供了输入数据优化的新方法，结合轻量设计，适用于传感器持续推理场景，性能优异。

Abstract: Existing works on Binary Neural Network (BNN) mainly focus on model's weights
and activations while discarding considerations on the input raw data. This
article introduces Generic Learned Thermometer (GLT), an encoding technique to
improve input data representation for BNN, relying on learning non linear
quantization thresholds. This technique consists in multiple data binarizations
which can advantageously replace a conventional Analog to Digital Conversion
(ADC) that uses natural binary coding. Additionally, we jointly propose a
compact topology with light-weight grouped convolutions being trained thanks to
block pruning and Knowledge Distillation (KD), aiming at reducing furthermore
the model size so as its computational complexity. We show that GLT brings
versatility to the BNN by intrinsically performing global tone mapping,
enabling significant accuracy gains in practice (demonstrated by simulations on
the STL-10 and VWW datasets). Moreover, when combining GLT with our proposed
block-pruning technique, we successfully achieve lightweight (under 1Mb),
fully-binarized models with limited accuracy degradation while being suitable
for in-sensor always-on inference use cases.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用CLIP解决开放集域适应问题的方法，通过动态调整文本提示和梯度分析模块，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开放集域适应（OSDA）需要同时对齐已知类分布并识别目标域中的未知类别，现有方法未能充分利用模态间的语义关系且容易在未知样本检测中积累错误。

Method: 1）基于域差异度量的可学习文本提示动态调整CLIP文本编码器；2）通过梯度分析模块量化域偏移，利用梯度行为的统计差异区分已知/未知样本。

Result: 在Office-Home数据集上，该方法显著优于CLIP基线和标准基线，消融实验验证了梯度范数的重要性。

Conclusion: 通过结合动态文本提示和梯度分析，该方法有效解决了开放集域适应中的语义对齐和未知样本识别问题。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Adaptation (OSDA) confronts the dual challenge of aligning
known-class distributions across domains while identifying
target-domain-specific unknown categories. Current approaches often fail to
leverage semantic relationships between modalities and struggle with error
accumulation in unknown sample detection. We propose to harness Contrastive
Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) to address these limitations through two key
innovations: 1) Prompt-driven cross-domain alignment: Learnable textual prompts
conditioned on domain discrepancy metrics dynamically adapt CLIP's text
encoder, enabling semantic consistency between source and target domains
without explicit unknown-class supervision. 2) Gradient-aware open-set
separation: A gradient analysis module quantifies domain shift by comparing the
L2-norm of gradients from the learned prompts, where known/unknown samples
exhibit statistically distinct gradient behaviors. Evaluations on Office-Home
show that our method consistently outperforms CLIP baseline and standard
baseline. Ablation studies confirm the gradient norm's critical role.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UltraDelta是一种无数据依赖的delta压缩方法，通过分层稀疏分配、分布感知压缩和全局重缩放，实现超高压缩比和强性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有delta压缩方法在存储多任务微调模型时无法同时实现高压缩和高性能的问题。

Method: 采用三种关键技术：基于方差的混合稀疏分配、分布感知压缩和迹范数引导的重缩放。

Result: 在多种模型（语言、NLP、视觉和多模态）上实现超高压缩比（最高800x），性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UltraDelta是一种高效且通用的delta压缩解决方案，适用于多种模型和任务。

Abstract: With the rise of the fine-tuned--pretrained paradigm, storing numerous
fine-tuned models for multi-tasking creates significant storage overhead. Delta
compression alleviates this by storing only the pretrained model and the highly
compressed delta weights (the differences between fine-tuned and pretrained
model weights). However, existing methods fail to maintain both high
compression and performance, and often rely on data. To address these
challenges, we propose UltraDelta, the first data-free delta compression
pipeline that achieves both ultra-high compression and strong performance.
UltraDelta is designed to minimize redundancy, maximize information, and
stabilize performance across inter-layer, intra-layer, and global dimensions,
using three key components: (1) Variance-Based Mixed Sparsity Allocation
assigns sparsity based on variance, giving lower sparsity to high-variance
layers to preserve inter-layer information. (2) Distribution-Aware Compression
applies uniform quantization and then groups parameters by value, followed by
group-wise pruning, to better preserve intra-layer distribution. (3)
Trace-Norm-Guided Rescaling uses the trace norm of delta weights to estimate a
global rescaling factor, improving model stability under higher compression.
Extensive experiments across (a) large language models (fine-tuned on LLaMA-2
7B and 13B) with up to 133x, (b) general NLP models (RoBERTa-base, T5-base)
with up to 800x, (c) vision models (ViT-B/32, ViT-L/14) with up to 400x, and
(d) multi-modal models (BEiT-3) with 40x compression ratio, demonstrate that
UltraDelta consistently outperforms existing methods, especially under
ultra-high compression.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在隐私敏感应用中表现优异，但模型性能因训练与部署间的分布偏移而下降。现有测试时适应（TTA）方法在FL中存在计算负担、隐私泄露和可扩展性不足的问题。

Method: FedCTTA通过基于模型输出分布的相似性感知聚合避免直接特征共享，利用随机噪声样本实现知识传递，同时最小化客户端熵以增强模型适应性。

Result: 实验表明，FedCTTA在时空异质性场景中优于现有方法，无需服务器端训练且内存占用恒定。

Conclusion: FedCTTA为联邦学习中的持续适应提供了一种高效、隐私保护的解决方案，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients without sharing raw data, making it ideal for
privacy-sensitive applications. However, FL models often suffer performance
degradation due to distribution shifts between training and deployment.
Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution by allowing models to
adapt using only test samples. However, existing TTA methods in FL face
challenges such as computational overhead, privacy risks from feature sharing,
and scalability concerns due to memory constraints. To address these
limitations, we propose Federated Continual Test-Time Adaptation (FedCTTA), a
privacy-preserving and computationally efficient framework for federated
adaptation. Unlike prior methods that rely on sharing local feature statistics,
FedCTTA avoids direct feature exchange by leveraging similarity-aware
aggregation based on model output distributions over randomly generated noise
samples. This approach ensures adaptive knowledge sharing while preserving data
privacy. Furthermore, FedCTTA minimizes the entropy at each client for
continual adaptation, enhancing the model's confidence in evolving target
distributions. Our method eliminates the need for server-side training during
adaptation and maintains a constant memory footprint, making it scalable even
as the number of clients or training rounds increases. Extensive experiments
show that FedCTTA surpasses existing methods across diverse temporal and
spatial heterogeneity scenarios.

Motivation: 通过提升分数评估生成样本是否满足单个条件，进而组合结果判断是否满足组合提示，无需额外训练或外部模块。

Method: 利用原始扩散模型高效近似提升分数，开发了一种计算开销较低的优化变体。

Result: 实验表明，提升分数显著提高了组合生成的条件对齐效果，适用于2D合成数据、CLEVR位置任务和文本到图像合成。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持有效性的同时降低了计算开销，为组合生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel resampling criterion using lift scores, for improving
compositional generation in diffusion models. By leveraging the lift scores, we
evaluate whether generated samples align with each single condition and then
compose the results to determine whether the composed prompt is satisfied. Our
key insight is that lift scores can be efficiently approximated using only the
original diffusion model, requiring no additional training or external modules.
We develop an optimized variant that achieves relatively lower computational
overhead during inference while maintaining effectiveness. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that lift scores significantly improved the
condition alignment for compositional generation across 2D synthetic data,
CLEVR position tasks, and text-to-image synthesis. Our code is available at

Motivation: KAT虽然FLOPs与传统Transformer相近，但训练速度慢123倍，需解决性能瓶颈。

Result: FlashKAT训练速度提升86.5倍，同时减少梯度误差。

Conclusion: FlashKAT有效解决了KAT的内存瓶颈，显著提升性能。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) has been gaining popularity as an
alternative to the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with its increased
expressiveness and interpretability. However, the KAN can be orders of
magnitude slower due to its increased computational cost and training
instability, limiting its applicability to larger-scale tasks. Recently, the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT) has been proposed, which can achieve FLOPs
similar to the traditional Transformer with MLPs by leveraging Group-Rational
KAN (GR-KAN). Unfortunately, despite the comparable FLOPs, our
characterizations reveal that the KAT is still 123x slower in training speeds,
indicating that there are other performance bottlenecks beyond FLOPs. In this
paper, we conduct a series of experiments to understand the root cause of the
slowdown in KAT. We uncover that the slowdown can be isolated to memory stalls
and, more specifically, in the backward pass of GR-KAN caused by inefficient
gradient accumulation. To address this memory bottleneck, we propose FlashKAT,
which builds on our restructured kernel that minimizes gradient accumulation
with atomic adds and accesses to slow memory. Evaluations demonstrate that
FlashKAT can achieve a training speedup of 86.5x compared with the
state-of-the-art KAT, while reducing rounding errors in the coefficient
gradients. Our code is available at https://github.com/OSU-STARLAB/FlashKAT.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Although adversarial training is known to be effective against adversarial
examples, training dynamics are not well understood. In this study, we present
the first theoretical analysis of adversarial training in random deep neural
networks without any assumptions on data distributions. We introduce a new
theoretical framework based on mean field theory, which addresses the
limitations of existing mean field-based approaches. Based on this framework,
we derive (empirically tight) upper bounds of $\ell_q$ norm-based adversarial
loss with $\ell_p$ norm-based adversarial examples for various values of $p$
and $q$. Moreover, we prove that networks without shortcuts are generally not
adversarially trainable and that adversarial training reduces network capacity.
We also show that network width alleviates these issues. Furthermore, we
present the various impacts of the input and output dimensions on the upper
bounds and time evolution of the weight variance.

and eliminate the need for adversarial training in downstream tasks.
Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that through in-context learning, a
single adversarially pretrained transformer can robustly generalize to multiple
unseen tasks without any additional training, i.e., without any parameter
updates. This robustness stems from the model's focus on robust features and
its resistance to attacks that exploit non-predictive features. Besides these
positive findings, we also identify several limitations. Under certain
conditions (though unrealistic), no universally robust single-layer
transformers exist. Moreover, robust transformers exhibit an
accuracy--robustness trade-off and require a large number of in-context
demonstrations. The code is available at

TL;DR: 研究探讨了如何通过文本引导向量（如稀疏自编码器、均值漂移和线性探测）提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的性能，发现其能显著提高视觉任务的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）缺乏与文本大语言模型（LLMs）类似的引导方法，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）、均值漂移和线性探测技术，从文本LLM中提取引导向量应用于MLLMs。

Result: 文本引导显著提升了MLLMs的多模态准确性，均值漂移在CV-Bench上空间关系准确性提升7.3%，计数准确性提升3.3%。

Conclusion: 文本引导向量是一种高效、低成本的机制，可增强MLLMs的接地能力，且无需额外数据收集或计算开销。

Abstract: Steering methods have emerged as effective and targeted tools for guiding
large language models' (LLMs) behavior without modifying their parameters.
Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), however, do not currently enjoy the
same suite of techniques, due in part to their recency and architectural
diversity. Inspired by this gap, we investigate whether MLLMs can be steered
using vectors derived from their text-only LLM backbone, via sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), mean shift, and linear probing. We find that text-derived
steering consistently enhances multimodal accuracy across diverse MLLM
architectures and visual tasks. In particular, mean shift boosts spatial
relationship accuracy on CV-Bench by up to +7.3% and counting accuracy by up to
+3.3%, outperforming prompting and exhibiting strong generalization to
out-of-distribution datasets. These results highlight textual steering vectors
as a powerful, efficient mechanism for enhancing grounding in MLLMs with
minimal additional data collection and computational overhead.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and the abundance of food
data have resulted in studies to improve food understanding using LLMs. Despite
several recommendation systems utilizing LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KGs), there
has been limited research on integrating food related KGs with LLMs. We
introduce KERL, a unified system that leverages food KGs and LLMs to provide
personalized food recommendations and generates recipes with associated
micro-nutritional information. Given a natural language question, KERL extracts
entities, retrieves subgraphs from the KG, which are then fed into the LLM as
context to select the recipes that satisfy the constraints. Next, our system
generates the cooking steps and nutritional information for each recipe. To
evaluate our approach, we also develop a benchmark dataset by curating recipe
related questions, combined with constraints and personal preferences. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our proposed KG-augmented LLM significantly
outperforms existing approaches, offering a complete and coherent solution for
food recommendation, recipe generation, and nutritional analysis. Our code and
benchmark datasets are publicly available at

*Yanan Li,Fanxu Meng,Muhan Zhang,Shiai Zhu,Shangguang Wang,Mengwei Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LoRASuite提出了一种模块化方法，利用现有LoRA权重高效适应新版LLM，避免了从头训练的代价，并在性能和效率上显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM频繁更新，传统从头训练LoRA权重的方法成本高、耗时长且不环保，亟需一种高效利用现有权重的方法。

Method: 通过计算转移矩阵、基于对齐和相似度分配层和注意力头，并进行小规模微调，实现LoRA权重的快速适配。

Result: LoRASuite在MiniCPM和Qwen等LLM上表现优于小规模LoRA方法，甚至超越全规模重训练，数学任务平均提升1.4和6.6分，内存和计算时间分别减少5.5GB和78.23%。

Conclusion: LoRASuite为LLM更新提供了一种高效、低成本的LoRA权重适配方案，显著提升了性能和资源利用率。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently updated, LoRA weights trained
on earlier versions quickly become obsolete. The conventional practice of
retraining LoRA weights from scratch on the latest model is costly,
time-consuming, and environmentally detrimental, particularly as the diversity
of LLMs and downstream tasks expands. This motivates a critical question: "How
can we efficiently leverage existing LoRA weights to adapt to newer model
versions?" To address this, we propose LoRASuite, a modular approach tailored
specifically to various types of LLM updates. First, we compute a transfer
matrix utilizing known parameters from both old and new LLMs. Next, we allocate
corresponding layers and attention heads based on centered kernel alignment and
cosine similarity metrics, respectively. A subsequent small-scale, skillful
fine-tuning step ensures numerical stability. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that LoRASuite consistently surpasses small-scale vanilla LoRA
methods. Notably, on backbone LLMs such as MiniCPM and Qwen, LoRASuite even
exceeds the performance of full-scale LoRA retraining, with average
improvements of +1.4 and +6.6 points on math tasks, respectively. Additionally,
LoRASuite significantly reduces memory consumption by 5.5 GB and computational
time by 78.23%.

Motivation: 探索如何在大规模预训练中高效调整超参数，以优化训练效果。

Method: 通过实验验证缩放规律，提出基于AdamW时间尺度和D/N比例的幂律关系预测最优超参数。

Result: 发现最优权重衰减与批量大小线性相关，最优批量大小和临界批量大小与数据集大小呈幂律关系。

Conclusion: 研究结果为大规模训练中的超参数选择和计算资源分配提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Efficient LLM pre-training requires well-tuned hyperparameters (HPs),
including learning rate {\eta} and weight decay {\lambda}. We study scaling
laws for HPs: formulas for how to scale HPs as we scale model size N, dataset
size D, and batch size B. Recent work suggests the AdamW timescale,
B/({\eta}{\lambda}D), should remain constant across training settings, and we
verify the implication that optimal {\lambda} scales linearly with B, for a
fixed N,D. However, as N,D scale, we show the optimal timescale obeys a precise
power law in the tokens-per-parameter ratio, D/N. This law thus provides a
method to accurately predict {\lambda}opt in advance of large-scale training.
We also study scaling laws for optimal batch size Bopt (the B enabling lowest
loss at a given N,D) and critical batch size Bcrit (the B beyond which further
data parallelism becomes ineffective). In contrast with prior work, we find
both Bopt and Bcrit scale as power laws in D, independent of model size, N.
Finally, we analyze how these findings inform the real-world selection of
Pareto-optimal N and D under dual training time and compute objectives.

Motivation: 大型语言模型作为决策代理成本高、模型大，限制了实际部署。

Result: 在多个实验中表现优于基线方法，实现了显著压缩且性能下降最小。

Conclusion: 段级对齐对高效可部署代理至关重要。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities as decision-making
agents by interleaving reasoning and actions, as seen in ReAct-style
frameworks. Yet, their practical deployment is constrained by high inference
costs and large model sizes. We propose Structured Agent Distillation, a
framework that compresses large LLM-based agents into smaller student models
while preserving both reasoning fidelity and action consistency. Unlike
standard token-level distillation, our method segments trajectories into
{[REASON]} and {[ACT]} spans, applying segment-specific losses to align each
component with the teacher's behavior. This structure-aware supervision enables
compact agents to better replicate the teacher's decision process. Experiments
on ALFWorld, HotPotQA-ReAct, and WebShop show that our approach consistently
outperforms token-level and imitation learning baselines, achieving significant
compression with minimal performance drop. Scaling and ablation results further
highlight the importance of span-level alignment for efficient and deployable
agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法在偏好对齐阶段仅利用响应输出而忽略概率信息，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出InfiFPO，结合多源概率信息，采用概率裁剪和最大间隔融合策略，优化偏好对齐。

Result: 在11个基准测试中，InfiFPO平均性能从79.95提升至83.33，尤其在数学、编码和推理任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: InfiFPO通过保留概率信息并优化融合策略，显著优于现有模型融合和偏好优化方法。

Abstract: Model fusion combines multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) with different
strengths into a more powerful, integrated model through lightweight training
methods. Existing works on model fusion focus primarily on supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), leaving preference alignment (PA) --a critical phase for
enhancing LLM performance--largely unexplored. The current few fusion methods
on PA phase, like WRPO, simplify the process by utilizing only response outputs
from source models while discarding their probability information. To address
this limitation, we propose InfiFPO, a preference optimization method for
implicit model fusion. InfiFPO replaces the reference model in Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) with a fused source model that synthesizes
multi-source probabilities at the sequence level, circumventing complex
vocabulary alignment challenges in previous works and meanwhile maintaining the
probability information. By introducing probability clipping and max-margin
fusion strategies, InfiFPO enables the pivot model to align with human
preferences while effectively distilling knowledge from source models.
Comprehensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that InfiFPO
consistently outperforms existing model fusion and preference optimization
methods. When using Phi-4 as the pivot model, InfiFPO improve its average
performance from 79.95 to 83.33 on 11 benchmarks, significantly improving its
capabilities in mathematics, coding, and reasoning tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究安全对齐是否对应可识别的几何方向或子空间，以防御微调导致的安全退化。

Method: 通过参数和激活空间的实证研究，分析安全相关行为是否集中在特定子空间，以及是否可分离。

Result: 安全与不安全行为共享子空间和表征，未发现选择性控制安全的子空间。

Conclusion: 安全对齐是模型整体学习动态的一部分，子空间防御可能受限，需探索其他策略。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) rely on safety alignment to produce socially
acceptable responses. This is typically achieved through instruction tuning and
reinforcement learning from human feedback. However, this alignment is known to
be brittle: further fine-tuning, even on benign or lightly contaminated data,
can degrade safety and reintroduce harmful behaviors. A growing body of work
suggests that alignment may correspond to identifiable geometric directions in
weight space, forming subspaces that could, in principle, be isolated or
preserved to defend against misalignment. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive empirical study of this geometric perspective. We examine whether
safety-relevant behavior is concentrated in specific subspaces, whether it can
be separated from general-purpose learning, and whether harmfulness arises from
distinguishable patterns in internal representations. Across both parameter and
activation space, our findings are consistent: subspaces that amplify safe
behaviors also amplify unsafe ones, and prompts with different safety
implications activate overlapping representations. We find no evidence of a
subspace that selectively governs safety. These results challenge the
assumption that alignment is geometrically localized. Rather than residing in
distinct directions, safety appears to emerge from entangled, high-impact
components of the model's broader learning dynamics. This suggests that
subspace-based defenses may face fundamental limitations and underscores the
need for alternative strategies to preserve alignment under continued training.
We corroborate these findings through multiple experiments on five open-source
LLMs. Our code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 现有组相对优势估计方法（如GRPO）在优势接近零时训练效率低下，限制了强化学习在提升大语言模型推理能力中的应用。

Method: 提出Advantage-Augmented Policy Optimization (AAPO)，利用动量增强的优势估计优化交叉熵损失。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AAPO表现出优于现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: AAPO通过改进优势估计方法，显著提升了训练效率，为强化学习在大语言模型中的应用提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as an effective approach for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
especially in scenarios where supervised fine-tuning (SFT) falls short due to
limited chain-of-thought (CoT) data. Among RL-based post-training methods,
group relative advantage estimation, as exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), has attracted considerable attention for eliminating the
dependency on the value model, thereby simplifying training compared to
traditional approaches like Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). However, we
observe that exsiting group relative advantage estimation method still suffers
from training inefficiencies, particularly when the estimated advantage
approaches zero. To address this limitation, we propose Advantage-Augmented
Policy Optimization (AAPO), a novel RL algorithm that optimizes the
cross-entropy (CE) loss using advantages enhanced through a momentum-based
estimation scheme. This approach effectively mitigates the inefficiencies
associated with group relative advantage estimation. Experimental results on
multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance
of AAPO.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的量化感知训练（QAT）缩放定律，研究了4位精度（W4A4）下量化误差与模型大小、训练数据量和量化粒度之间的关系，并通过实验验证了其规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的高计算和内存需求带来了部署挑战，而现有的QAT缩放定律忽略了训练令牌数量和量化粒度等关键因素，限制了其适用性。

Method: 通过268次QAT实验，量化误差被建模为模型大小、训练数据量和量化组大小的函数，并分解为权重和激活分量进行分析。

Result: 量化误差随模型增大而减小，但随训练令牌增加和量化粒度变粗而上升。FC2层的激活量化误差是主要瓶颈，混合精度量化可缓解此问题。

Conclusion: 研究结果为改进QAT提供了关键见解，尤其是在权重和激活量化误差的平衡方面。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demand substantial computational and memory
resources, creating deployment challenges. Quantization-aware training (QAT)
addresses these challenges by reducing model precision while maintaining
performance. However, the scaling behavior of QAT, especially at 4-bit
precision (W4A4), is not well understood. Existing QAT scaling laws often
ignore key factors such as the number of training tokens and quantization
granularity, which limits their applicability. This paper proposes a unified
scaling law for QAT that models quantization error as a function of model size,
training data volume, and quantization group size. Through 268 QAT experiments,
we show that quantization error decreases as model size increases, but rises
with more training tokens and coarser quantization granularity. To identify the
sources of W4A4 quantization error, we decompose it into weight and activation
components. Both components follow the overall trend of W4A4 quantization
error, but with different sensitivities. Specifically, weight quantization
error increases more rapidly with more training tokens. Further analysis shows
that the activation quantization error in the FC2 layer, caused by outliers, is
the primary bottleneck of W4A4 QAT quantization error. By applying
mixed-precision quantization to address this bottleneck, we demonstrate that
weight and activation quantization errors can converge to similar levels.
Additionally, with more training data, weight quantization error eventually
exceeds activation quantization error, suggesting that reducing weight
quantization error is also important in such scenarios. These findings offer
key insights for improving QAT research and development.

Result: 任务准确率提升5.54%，端到端延迟降低28%。

Conclusion: CoLD为资源受限环境中的LLM解码提供了高效实用的策略，适用于云和本地部署。

Abstract: Huawei Cloud users leverage LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) as an efficient and
scalable method to fine-tune and customize large language models (LLMs) for
application-specific needs. However, tasks that require complex reasoning or
deep contextual understanding are often hindered by biases or interference from
the base model when using typical decoding methods like greedy or beam search.
These biases can lead to generic or task-agnostic responses from the base model
instead of leveraging the LoRA-specific adaptations. In this paper, we
introduce Contrastive LoRA Decoding (CoLD), a novel decoding framework designed
to maximize the use of task-specific knowledge in LoRA-adapted models,
resulting in better downstream performance. CoLD uses contrastive decoding by
scoring candidate tokens based on the divergence between the probability
distributions of a LoRA-adapted expert model and the corresponding base model.
This approach prioritizes tokens that better align with the LoRA's learned
representations, enhancing performance for specialized tasks. While effective,
a naive implementation of CoLD is computationally expensive because each
decoding step requires evaluating multiple token candidates across both models.
To address this, we developed an optimized kernel for Huawei's Ascend NPU. CoLD
achieves up to a 5.54% increase in task accuracy while reducing end-to-end
latency by 28% compared to greedy decoding. This work provides practical and
efficient decoding strategies for fine-tuned LLMs in resource-constrained
environments and has broad implications for applied data science in both cloud
and on-premises settings.

Conclusion: 解决验证器假阴性问题对强化学习至关重要，tinyV提供了一种实用改进方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a powerful tool for enhancing the
reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) by optimizing their
policies with reward signals. Yet, RL's success relies on the reliability of
rewards, which are provided by verifiers. In this paper, we expose and analyze
a widespread problem--false negatives--where verifiers wrongly reject correct
model outputs. Our in-depth study of the Big-Math-RL-Verified dataset reveals
that over 38% of model-generated responses suffer from false negatives, where
the verifier fails to recognize correct answers. We show, both empirically and
theoretically, that these false negatives severely impair RL training by
depriving the model of informative gradient signals and slowing convergence. To
mitigate this, we propose tinyV, a lightweight LLM-based verifier that augments
existing rule-based methods, which dynamically identifies potential false
negatives and recovers valid responses to produce more accurate reward
estimates. Across multiple math-reasoning benchmarks, integrating TinyV boosts
pass rates by up to 10% and accelerates convergence relative to the baseline.
Our findings highlight the critical importance of addressing verifier false
negatives and offer a practical approach to improve RL-based fine-tuning of
LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/uw-nsl/TinyV.

Result: DANF能够更精确地捕捉声音场的定向特性，并适应不同房间环境。

Conclusion: DANF在声音场建模中表现出优越性，尤其在定向特性捕捉和适应性方面。

Abstract: The characteristics of a sound field are intrinsically linked to the
geometric and spatial properties of the environment surrounding a sound source
and a listener. The physics of sound propagation is captured in a time-domain
signal known as a room impulse response (RIR). Prior work using neural fields
(NFs) has allowed learning spatially-continuous representations of RIRs from
finite RIR measurements. However, previous NF-based methods have focused on
monaural omnidirectional or at most binaural listeners, which does not
precisely capture the directional characteristics of a real sound field at a
single point. We propose a direction-aware neural field (DANF) that more
explicitly incorporates the directional information by Ambisonic-format RIRs.
While DANF inherently captures spatial relations between sources and listeners,
we further propose a direction-aware loss. In addition, we investigate the
ability of DANF to adapt to new rooms in various ways including low-rank
adaptation.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) enhances robustness in noisy

deployment in resource-constrained settings. To address this, we propose
Llama-SMoP, an efficient Multimodal LLM that employs a Sparse Mixture of
Projectors (SMoP) module to scale model capacity without increasing inference
costs. By incorporating sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) projectors,
Llama-SMoP enables the use of smaller LLMs while maintaining strong
performance. We explore three SMoP configurations and show that Llama-SMoP DEDR
(Disjoint-Experts, Disjoint-Routers), which uses modality-specific routers and
experts, achieves superior performance on ASR, VSR, and AVSR tasks. Ablation
studies confirm its effectiveness in expert activation, scalability, and noise
robustness.

Our method involves providing listeners with transcriptions, having them

for reliability. Objectively, we utilise pronunciation-related metrics, based
on distances between vowel formants and phonetic posteriorgrams, to evaluate
accent generation. Comparative experiments reveal that these metrics, alongside
accent similarity, speaker similarity, and Mel Cepstral Distortion, can be
used. Moreover, our findings underscore significant limitations of common

Method: 结合预训练模型的伪标签和无监督k-means聚类，设计IDI模块以减少SER中的偏见。

Result: 伪标签IDI将公平性指标提升33%以上，SER准确率下降不足3%；无监督IDI提升公平性指标26%以上，SER性能下降不足4%。

Conclusion: IDI模块有效减少了种族和年龄偏见，适用于显式人口统计信息缺失的场景。

Abstract: While subgroup disparities and performance bias are increasingly studied in
computational research, fairness in categorical Speech Emotion Recognition
(SER) remains underexplored. Existing methods often rely on explicit
demographic labels, which are difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns. To
address this limitation, we introduce an Implicit Demography Inference (IDI)
module that leverages pseudo-labeling from a pre-trained model and unsupervised
learning using k-means clustering to mitigate bias in SER. Our experiments show
that pseudo-labeling IDI reduces subgroup disparities, improving fairness
metrics by over 33% with less than a 3% decrease in SER accuracy. Also, the
unsupervised IDI yields more than a 26% improvement in fairness metrics with a
drop of less than 4% in SER performance. Further analyses reveal that the
unsupervised IDI consistently mitigates race and age disparities, demonstrating
its potential in scenarios where explicit demographic information is
unavailable.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频感知大语言模型（ALLMs）在处理音频输入时容易产生幻觉，影响可靠性。

Method: 提出LISTEN方法，通过对比训练和合成数据增强模型区分真实与虚构声音的能力，使用轻量级适配器集成音频表示。

Result: 实验表明LISTEN有效减少幻觉，同时保持现有音频问答和推理任务的性能，且数据与计算效率更高。

Conclusion: LISTEN是一种高效且无需修改模型参数的解决方案，显著提升了ALLMs的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in audio-aware large language models (ALLMs) enable them
to process and understand audio inputs. However, these models often hallucinate
non-existent sound events, reducing their reliability in real-world
applications. To address this, we propose LISTEN (Learning to Identify Sounds
Through Extended Negative Samples), a contrastive-like training method that
enhances ALLMs' ability to distinguish between present and absent sounds using
synthesized data from the backbone LLM. Unlike prior approaches, our method
requires no modification to LLM parameters and efficiently integrates audio
representations via a lightweight adapter. Experiments show that LISTEN
effectively mitigates hallucinations while maintaining impressive performance
on existing audio question and reasoning benchmarks. At the same time, it is
more efficient in both data and computation.

Motivation: 财报电话会议是公司高管、分析师和股东间的重要沟通渠道，包含大量前瞻性信息，但其冗长和专业术语对语言模型分析构成挑战。

Method: 提出SAE-FiRE框架，利用稀疏自编码器（SAEs）识别模式、过滤噪音，并捕捉具有预测能力的财务信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: SAE-FiRE能有效解决财报电话会议转录的分析难题，提升盈利意外预测的准确性。

Abstract: Predicting earnings surprises through the analysis of earnings conference
call transcripts has attracted increasing attention from the financial research
community. Conference calls serve as critical communication channels between
company executives, analysts, and shareholders, offering valuable
forward-looking information. However, these transcripts present significant
analytical challenges, typically containing over 5,000 words with substantial
redundancy and industry-specific terminology that creates obstacles for
language models. In this work, we propose the Sparse Autoencoder for Financial
Representation Enhancement (SAE-FiRE) framework to address these limitations by
extracting key information while eliminating redundancy. SAE-FiRE employs
Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to efficiently identify patterns and filter out
noises, and focusing specifically on capturing nuanced financial signals that
have predictive power for earnings surprises. Experimental results indicate
that the proposed method can significantly outperform comparing baselines.

TL;DR: MLZero是一个基于大型语言模型的多智能体框架，实现端到端机器学习自动化，支持多模态数据，性能显著优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AutoML系统在多模态数据处理中仍需大量人工配置和专家输入，MLZero旨在实现更高效的自动化。

Method: 采用认知感知模块处理多模态输入，结合语义和情景记忆优化代码生成过程。

Result: 在MLE-Bench Lite和Multimodal AutoML Agent Benchmark上表现优异，成功率和解决方案质量均领先。

Conclusion: MLZero在多模态数据自动化处理中表现出色，即使使用小型LLM也能超越现有解决方案。

Abstract: Existing AutoML systems have advanced the automation of machine learning
(ML); however, they still require substantial manual configuration and expert
input, particularly when handling multimodal data. We introduce MLZero, a novel
multi-agent framework powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that enables
end-to-end ML automation across diverse data modalities with minimal human
intervention. A cognitive perception module is first employed, transforming raw
multimodal inputs into perceptual context that effectively guides the
subsequent workflow. To address key limitations of LLMs, such as hallucinated
code generation and outdated API knowledge, we enhance the iterative code
generation process with semantic and episodic memory. MLZero demonstrates
superior performance on MLE-Bench Lite, outperforming all competitors in both
success rate and solution quality, securing six gold medals. Additionally, when
evaluated on our Multimodal AutoML Agent Benchmark, which includes 25 more
challenging tasks spanning diverse data modalities, MLZero outperforms the
competing methods by a large margin with a success rate of 0.92 (+263.6\%) and
an average rank of 2.28. Our approach maintains its robust effectiveness even
with a compact 8B LLM, outperforming full-size systems from existing solutions.
