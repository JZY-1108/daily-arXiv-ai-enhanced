### [1] [A2HCoder: An LLM-Driven Coding Agent for Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10904)
*Jie Lei,Ruofan Jia,J. Andrew Zhang,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: A2HCoder是一个基于大语言模型的分层算法到HDL编码代理，旨在解决算法设计与硬件实现之间的鸿沟，通过模块化和逐步翻译提升可靠性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无线通信系统对超低延迟和功耗的严格要求，导致算法设计与硬件实现之间存在显著差距，传统方法需要大量专业知识和手动开发。

Method: A2HCoder采用分层框架，水平维度分解算法为模块化功能块，垂直维度逐步翻译并利用外部工具链调试和合成。

Result: 在5G无线通信领域的实际部署中验证了A2HCoder的实用性、可靠性和部署效率。

Conclusion: A2HCoder通过结构化方法显著减少幻觉问题，确保硬件级正确性，为算法到硬件的敏捷翻译提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In wireless communication systems, stringent requirements such as ultra-low
latency and power consumption have significantly increased the demand for
efficient algorithm-to-hardware deployment. However, a persistent and
substantial gap remains between algorithm design and hardware implementation.
Bridging this gap traditionally requires extensive domain expertise and
time-consuming manual development, due to fundamental mismatches between
high-level programming languages like MATLAB and hardware description languages
(HDLs) such as Verilog-in terms of memory access patterns, data processing
manners, and datatype representations. To address this challenge, we propose
A2HCoder: a Hierarchical Algorithm-to-HDL Coding Agent, powered by large
language models (LLMs), designed to enable agile and reliable
algorithm-to-hardware translation. A2HCoder introduces a hierarchical framework
that enhances both robustness and interpretability while suppressing common
hallucination issues in LLM-generated code. In the horizontal dimension,
A2HCoder decomposes complex algorithms into modular functional blocks,
simplifying code generation and improving consistency. In the vertical
dimension, instead of relying on end-to-end generation, A2HCoder performs
step-by-step, fine-grained translation, leveraging external toolchains such as
MATLAB and Vitis HLS for debugging and circuit-level synthesis. This structured
process significantly mitigates hallucinations and ensures hardware-level
correctness. We validate A2HCoder through a real-world deployment case in the
5G wireless communication domain, demonstrating its practicality, reliability,
and deployment efficiency.

### [2] [PersonaTwin: A Multi-Tier Prompt Conditioning Framework for Generating and Evaluating Personalized Digital Twins](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10906)
*Sihan Chen,John P. Lalor,Yi Yang,Ahmed Abbasi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PersonaTwin是一个多层次的提示条件框架，通过整合人口统计、行为和心理测量数据构建自适应数字孪生，显著提升了LLM在用户模拟中的多维度和公平性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型（LLM）难以捕捉用户的多维细微差异，因此需要一种更精准的用户建模方法。

Method: 提出PersonaTwin框架，结合多种数据源，并通过医疗健康领域的8,500人数据集进行系统评估。

Result: 实验显示PersonaTwin在仿真保真度和公平性上表现优异，下游模型训练效果接近真实用户数据。

Conclusion: PersonaTwin为个性化数字用户建模和行为分析提供了高效工具，展现了LLM数字孪生方法的潜力。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) afford new possibilities for user modeling
and approximation of human behaviors, they often fail to capture the
multidimensional nuances of individual users. In this work, we introduce
PersonaTwin, a multi-tier prompt conditioning framework that builds adaptive
digital twins by integrating demographic, behavioral, and psychometric data.
Using a comprehensive data set in the healthcare context of more than 8,500
individuals, we systematically benchmark PersonaTwin against standard LLM
outputs, and our rigorous evaluation unites state-of-the-art text similarity
metrics with dedicated demographic parity assessments, ensuring that generated
responses remain accurate and unbiased. Experimental results show that our
framework produces simulation fidelity on par with oracle settings. Moreover,
downstream models trained on persona-twins approximate models trained on
individuals in terms of prediction and fairness metrics across both
GPT-4o-based and Llama-based models. Together, these findings underscore the
potential for LLM digital twin-based approaches in producing realistic and
emotionally nuanced user simulations, offering a powerful tool for personalized
digital user modeling and behavior analysis.

Abstract: We present gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, two open-weight reasoning models
that push the frontier of accuracy and inference cost. The models use an
efficient mixture-of-expert transformer architecture and are trained using
large-scale distillation and reinforcement learning. We optimize the models to

*Jiaxin Pei,Soumya Vadlamannati,Liang-Kang Huang,Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro,Xinyu Hua*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究构建了一个计算框架，从新闻文章中自动提取公司风险因素，实验表明微调预训练语言模型优于零样本或少样本提示的LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别公司风险对投资者和金融市场至关重要，但现有方法效率不足。

Method: 提出包含七个方面的风险分类框架，标注744篇新闻文章，并比较多种机器学习模型。

Result: 微调预训练模型在多数风险因素上表现优于LLMs，分析27.7万篇新闻文章展示了其实际价值。

Conclusion: 从新闻中识别风险因素能为公司和行业运营提供深入洞察。

Abstract: Identifying risks associated with a company is important to investors and the
well-being of the overall financial market. In this study, we build a
computational framework to automatically extract company risk factors from news
articles. Our newly proposed schema comprises seven distinct aspects, such as
supply chain, regulations, and competitions. We sample and annotate 744 news
articles and benchmark various machine learning models. While large language
models have achieved huge progress in various types of NLP tasks, our
experiment shows that zero-shot and few-shot prompting state-of-the-art LLMs
(e.g. LLaMA-2) can only achieve moderate to low performances in identifying
risk factors. And fine-tuned pre-trained language models are performing better
on most of the risk factors. Using this model, we analyze over 277K Bloomberg
news articles and demonstrate that identifying risk factors from news could
provide extensive insight into the operations of companies and industries.

### [5] [Rule2Text: A Framework for Generating and Evaluating Natural Language Explanations of Knowledge Graph Rules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10971)
*Nasim Shirvani-Mahdavi,Chengkai Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Rule2Text框架利用LLM为知识图谱的逻辑规则生成自然语言解释，提升可解释性和可用性。通过实验验证，结合人类评估和LLM自动评估，优化了模型性能，并开源了代码和数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱的逻辑规则复杂且难以解释，Rule2Text旨在通过自然语言生成改善其可访问性和实用性。

Method: 使用多种LLM（如Gemini 2.0 Flash）和提示策略（如零样本、少样本等），结合人类评估和LLM自动评估，优化模型性能并微调开源模型Zephyr。

Result: 微调后解释质量显著提升，尤其在领域特定数据集中表现突出。LLM自动评估与人类评估高度一致。

Conclusion: Rule2Text成功提升了知识图谱规则的可解释性，并通过开源工具支持更广泛的应用。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) can be enhanced through rule mining; however, the
resulting logical rules are often difficult for humans to interpret due to
their inherent complexity and the idiosyncratic labeling conventions of
individual KGs. This work presents Rule2Text, a comprehensive framework that
leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate natural language
explanations for mined logical rules, thereby improving KG accessibility and
usability. We conduct extensive experiments using multiple datasets, including
Freebase variants (FB-CVT-REV, FB+CVT-REV, and FB15k-237) as well as the
ogbl-biokg dataset, with rules mined using AMIE 3.5.1. We systematically
evaluate several LLMs across a comprehensive range of prompting strategies,
including zero-shot, few-shot, variable type incorporation, and
Chain-of-Thought reasoning. To systematically assess models' performance, we
conduct a human evaluation of generated explanations on correctness and
clarity. To address evaluation scalability, we develop and validate an
LLM-as-a-judge framework that demonstrates strong agreement with human
evaluators. Leveraging the best-performing model (Gemini 2.0 Flash), LLM judge,
and human-in-the-loop feedback, we construct high-quality ground truth
datasets, which we use to fine-tune the open-source Zephyr model. Our results
demonstrate significant improvements in explanation quality after fine-tuning,
with particularly strong gains in the domain-specific dataset. Additionally, we
integrate a type inference module to support KGs lacking explicit type
information. All code and data are publicly available at
https://github.com/idirlab/KGRule2NL.

### [6] [Improving Text Style Transfer using Masked Diffusion Language Models with Inference-time Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10995)
*Tejomay Kishor Padole,Suyash P Awate,Pushpak Bhattacharyya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于验证器的推理时间缩放方法，用于提升掩码扩散语言模型（MDM）的生成质量，并在文本风格转换任务中验证其优于自回归语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型（MDM）因其可扩展性和训练简便性成为离散数据生成的前沿方法，但如何进一步提升其生成质量是研究重点。

Method: 提出一种基于验证器的推理时间缩放方法，结合预训练嵌入模型的软值验证器，优化MDM的去噪过程。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在文本风格转换任务中显著提升生成质量，且优于现有分类器自由引导方法。

Conclusion: MDM结合验证器方法在离散数据生成任务中具有优越性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDMs) have recently gained traction as a
viable generative framework for natural language. This can be attributed to its
scalability and ease of training compared to other diffusion model paradigms
for discrete data, establishing itself as the state-of-the-art
non-autoregressive generator for discrete data. Diffusion models, in general,
have shown excellent ability to improve the generation quality by leveraging
inference-time scaling either by increasing the number of denoising steps or by
using external verifiers on top of the outputs of each step to guide the
generation. In this work, we propose a verifier-based inference-time scaling
method that aids in finding a better candidate generation during the denoising
process of the MDM. Our experiments demonstrate the application of MDMs for
standard text-style transfer tasks and establish MDMs as a better alternative
to autoregressive language models. Additionally, we show that a simple
soft-value-based verifier setup for MDMs using off-the-shelf pre-trained
embedding models leads to significant gains in generation quality even when
used on top of typical classifier-free guidance setups in the existing
literature.

### [7] [SproutBench: A Benchmark for Safe and Ethical Large Language Models for Youth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11009)
*Wenpeng Xing,Lanyi Wei,Haixiao Hu,Rongchang Li,Mohan Li,Changting Lin,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出当前AI安全框架未充分考虑未成年人需求，提出SproutBench评估套件，揭示LLMs在儿童和青少年中的安全隐患，并提出改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI安全框架主要针对成人，忽视了未成年人在认知、情感和社交方面的独特脆弱性，亟需重新评估。

Method: 开发SproutBench评估套件，包含1,283个针对不同年龄段（0-18岁）的对抗性提示，测试LLMs的安全性。

Result: 评估47种LLMs发现显著安全隐患，如情感依赖和隐私风险，并揭示安全性与风险预防之间的相关性。

Conclusion: 研究为儿童中心AI设计和部署提供实用指南，强调需改进现有安全框架。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of large language models (LLMs) in applications
targeting children and adolescents necessitates a fundamental reassessment of
prevailing AI safety frameworks, which are largely tailored to adult users and
neglect the distinct developmental vulnerabilities of minors. This paper
highlights key deficiencies in existing LLM safety benchmarks, including their
inadequate coverage of age-specific cognitive, emotional, and social risks
spanning early childhood (ages 0--6), middle childhood (7--12), and adolescence
(13--18). To bridge these gaps, we introduce SproutBench, an innovative
evaluation suite comprising 1,283 developmentally grounded adversarial prompts
designed to probe risks such as emotional dependency, privacy violations, and
imitation of hazardous behaviors. Through rigorous empirical evaluation of 47
diverse LLMs, we uncover substantial safety vulnerabilities, corroborated by
robust inter-dimensional correlations (e.g., between Safety and Risk
Prevention) and a notable inverse relationship between Interactivity and Age
Appropriateness. These insights yield practical guidelines for advancing
child-centric AI design and deployment.

TL;DR: 研究通过小规模Transformer模型和合成多语言数据集，揭示了跨语言知识迁移中模型如何形成统一或分离的事实表示，并提出调控迁移水平的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在跨语言知识迁移中表现不佳，常产生幻觉，研究旨在探索其成因和动态机制。

Method: 训练小型Transformer模型于合成多语言数据集，分析模型学习阶段及统一表示的形成，并通过数据分布和分词调控迁移水平。

Result: 发现统一表示对跨语言迁移至关重要，其程度受事实与语言互信息及语言提取难度影响，并提出相关调控方法和可视化指标。

Conclusion: 研究为理解预训练动态提供了新视角，并提出了改进LLMs跨语言迁移的新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) struggle with cross-lingual knowledge transfer:
they hallucinate when asked in one language about facts expressed in a
different language during training. This work introduces a controlled setting
to study the causes and dynamics of this phenomenon by training small
Transformer models from scratch on synthetic multilingual datasets. We identify
a learning phase wherein a model develops either separate or unified
representations of the same facts across languages, and show that unification
is essential for cross-lingual transfer. We also show that the degree of
unification depends on mutual information between facts and training data
language, and on how easy it is to extract that language. Based on these
insights, we develop methods to modulate the level of cross-lingual transfer by
manipulating data distribution and tokenization, and we introduce metrics and
visualizations to formally characterize their effects on unification. Our work
shows how controlled settings can shed light on pre-training dynamics and
suggests new directions for improving cross-lingual transfer in LLMs.

### [9] [Hell or High Water: Evaluating Agentic Recovery from External Failures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11027)
*Andrew Wang,Sophia Hager,Adi Asija,Daniel Khashabi,Nicholas Andrews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究语言模型代理在复杂任务中应对计划失败的能力，发现其难以适应环境反馈并制定备用计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型代理在计划失败时如何寻找替代方案，以应对现实世界中的复杂问题。

Method: 设计了一个专门的规划基准测试，通过函数调用组合解决问题，并引入外部失败（如函数不可用）来观察代理的适应能力。

Result: 语言模型代理难以根据环境反馈调整计划，即使搜索空间受限，仍无法有效执行备用方案。

Conclusion: 当前生成模型在适应性和规划能力上存在挑战，未来研究需关注模型规模和搜索空间优化的方向。

Abstract: As language model agents are applied to real world problems of increasing
complexity, they will be expected to formulate plans across large search
spaces. If those plans fail for reasons beyond their control, how well do
language agents search for alternative ways to achieve their goals? We devise a
specialized agentic planning benchmark to study this question. Each planning
problem is solved via combinations of function calls. The agent searches for
relevant functions from a set of over four thousand possibilities, and observes
environmental feedback in the form of function outputs or error messages. Our
benchmark confronts the agent with external failures in its workflow, such as
functions that suddenly become unavailable. At the same time, even with the
introduction of these failures, we guarantee that the task remains solvable.
Ideally, an agent's performance on the planning task should not be affected by
the presence of external failures. Overall, we find that language agents
struggle to formulate and execute backup plans in response to environment
feedback. While state-of-the-art models are often able to identify the correct
function to use in the right context, they struggle to adapt to feedback from
the environment and often fail to pursue alternate courses of action, even when
the search space is artificially restricted. We provide a systematic analysis
of the failures of both open-source and commercial models, examining the
effects of search space size, as well as the benefits of scaling model size in
our setting. Our analysis identifies key challenges for current generative
models as well as promising directions for future work.

### [10] [BIPOLAR: Polarization-based granular framework for LLM bias evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11061)
*Martin Pavlíček,Tomáš Filip,Petr Sosík*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种可重用、细粒度且与主题无关的框架，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）中与极化相关的偏见，并通过俄罗斯-乌克兰战争的案例研究验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在下游任务中表现出偏见，尤其是在敏感话题上。尽管已有偏见检测和缓解技术的进展，但某些挑战仍未充分探索。

Method: 结合极化敏感的情感指标与合成的平衡数据集，使用预定义的语义类别评估LLMs的偏见。

Result: 研究发现LLMs对乌克兰表现出更积极的情感倾向，且在不同语义类别中存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 该框架支持自动化数据集生成和细粒度偏见评估，适用于多种极化驱动场景，并与其他偏见评估策略正交。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to exhibit biases in downstream tasks,
especially when dealing with sensitive topics such as political discourse,
gender identity, ethnic relations, or national stereotypes. Although
significant progress has been made in bias detection and mitigation techniques,
certain challenges remain underexplored. This study proposes a reusable,
granular, and topic-agnostic framework to evaluate polarisation-related biases
in LLM (both open-source and closed-source). Our approach combines
polarisation-sensitive sentiment metrics with a synthetically generated
balanced dataset of conflict-related statements, using a predefined set of
semantic categories.
  As a case study, we created a synthetic dataset that focusses on the
Russia-Ukraine war, and we evaluated the bias in several LLMs: Llama-3,
Mistral, GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.0. Beyond aggregate bias scores, with
a general trend for more positive sentiment toward Ukraine, the framework
allowed fine-grained analysis with considerable variation between semantic
categories, uncovering divergent behavioural patterns among models. Adaptation
to prompt modifications showed further bias towards preconceived language and
citizenship modification.
  Overall, the framework supports automated dataset generation and fine-grained
bias assessment, is applicable to a variety of polarisation-driven scenarios
and topics, and is orthogonal to many other bias-evaluation strategies.

Abstract: Abstract meaning representation (AMR) is a semantic formalism used to
represent the meaning of sentences as directed acyclic graphs. In this paper,
we describe how real digital dictionaries can be embedded into AMR directed
graphs (digraphs), using state-of-the-art pre-trained large language models.
Then, we reduce those graphs in a confluent manner, i.e. with transformations
that preserve their circuit space. Finally, the properties of these reduces
digraphs are analyzed and discussed in relation to the symbol grounding
problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂任务中表现出色，但其在现实应用中的可靠性研究有限。本文旨在探索LLM在动态行业环境中的可靠部署。

Method: 引入RAMP框架，结合迭代规划、工具调用、验证和反思机制，并配备长期记忆存储（客户特定事实和过去查询的知识库）。

Result: 在88个评估查询中，准确性提高了28个百分点；在模糊查询中，通过多次验证/反思迭代，召回率提升了约20个百分点，用户满意度更高。

Conclusion: RAMP框架为动态行业环境中可靠部署LLM系统提供了实用见解，展示了迭代验证和记忆存储的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enabled the development of AI
agents that can plan and interact with tools to complete complex tasks.
However, literature on their reliability in real-world applications remains
limited. In this paper, we introduce a multi-agent framework for a marketing
task: audience curation. To solve this, we introduce a framework called RAMP
that iteratively plans, calls tools, verifies the output, and generates
suggestions to improve the quality of the audience generated. Additionally, we
equip the model with a long-term memory store, which is a knowledge base of
client-specific facts and past queries. Overall, we demonstrate the use of LLM
planning and memory, which increases accuracy by 28 percentage points on a set
of 88 evaluation queries. Moreover, we show the impact of iterative
verification and reflection on more ambiguous queries, showing progressively
better recall (roughly +20 percentage points) with more verify/reflect
iterations on a smaller challenge set, and higher user satisfaction. Our
results provide practical insights for deploying reliable LLM-based systems in
dynamic, industry-facing environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM基准测试缺乏自然且耗时的人类问题，MoNaCo旨在解决这一问题，提供更接近真实信息查询场景的测试数据。

Method: 通过分解注释流程，手动生成并回答大量自然且耗时的问题，构建MoNaCo基准测试。

Result: 前沿LLMs在MoNaCo上的最高F1得分为61.2%，表现受限于低召回率和幻觉问题。

Conclusion: MoNaCo突显了需要更好的推理模型以应对现实世界复杂问题的需求，并提供了跟踪进展的有效资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are emerging as a go-to tool for querying
information. However, current LLM benchmarks rarely feature natural questions
that are both information-seeking as well as genuinely time-consuming for
humans. To address this gap we introduce MoNaCo, a benchmark of 1,315 natural
and complex questions that require dozens, and at times hundreds, of
intermediate steps to solve -- far more than any existing QA benchmark. To
build MoNaCo, we developed a decomposed annotation pipeline to elicit and
manually answer natural time-consuming questions at scale. Frontier LLMs
evaluated on MoNaCo achieve at most 61.2% F1, hampered by low recall and
hallucinations. Our results underscore the need for reasoning models that
better handle the complexity and sheer breadth of real-world
information-seeking questions -- with MoNaCo providing an effective resource
for tracking such progress. The MONACO benchmark, codebase, prompts and models
predictions are publicly available at: https://tomerwolgithub.github.io/monaco

Motivation: 现有模型在预测人类移动模式方面表现优异，但其对模式背后原因或语义的理解能力尚不明确。

Method: MobQA通过自然语言问答评估LLMs，问题类型包括事实检索、多选推理和自由解释，需时空和语义推理。

Abstract: This paper presents MobQA, a benchmark dataset designed to evaluate the
semantic understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for human
mobility data through natural language question answering.
  While existing models excel at predicting human movement patterns, it remains
unobvious how much they can interpret the underlying reasons or semantic
meaning of those patterns. MobQA provides a comprehensive evaluation framework
for LLMs to answer questions about diverse human GPS trajectories spanning
daily to weekly granularities. It comprises 5,800 high-quality question-answer
pairs across three complementary question types: factual retrieval (precise

on factual retrieval but significant limitations in semantic reasoning and

model effectiveness. These findings demonstrate the achievements and
limitations of state-of-the-art LLMs for semantic mobility

*Anusha M D,Deepthi Vikram,Bharathi Raja Chakravarthi,Parameshwar R Hegde*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究为低资源德拉威语Tulu构建了首个社交媒体混合代码的冒犯性语言识别基准数据集，并评估了多种深度学习模型，发现BiGRU模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tulu作为一种低资源语言，缺乏计算资源，但其数字存在感逐渐增强，因此需要构建冒犯性语言识别的基准数据集。

Method: 从YouTube评论中收集并标注了3,845条混合代码的Tulu内容，评估了GRU、LSTM、BiGRU、BiLSTM、CNN、注意力机制及transformer模型。

Result: BiGRU模型表现最佳（准确率82%，宏F1分数0.81），而transformer模型表现不佳。

Conclusion: 为Tulu及其他低资源混合代码语言的NLP研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Tulu, a low-resource Dravidian language predominantly spoken in southern
India, has limited computational resources despite its growing digital
presence. This study presents the first benchmark dataset for Offensive
Language Identification (OLI) in code-mixed Tulu social media content,
collected from YouTube comments across various domains. The dataset, annotated
with high inter-annotator agreement (Krippendorff's alpha = 0.984), includes
3,845 comments categorized into four classes: Not Offensive, Not Tulu,
Offensive Untargeted, and Offensive Targeted. We evaluate a suite of deep
learning models, including GRU, LSTM, BiGRU, BiLSTM, CNN, and attention-based
variants, alongside transformer architectures (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa). The BiGRU
model with self-attention achieves the best performance with 82% accuracy and a
0.81 macro F1-score. Transformer models underperform, highlighting the
limitations of multilingual pretraining in code-mixed, under-resourced
contexts. This work lays the foundation for further NLP research in Tulu and
similar low-resource, code-mixed languages.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种个性化干扰项生成方法，通过分析学生的答题记录生成定制化干扰项，以更准确地诊断个体学生的误解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的干扰项生成方法只能捕捉群体层面的错误模式，无法满足个体学生的诊断需求。

Method: 采用无训练的两阶段框架：第一阶段通过蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS）从学生错误答案中恢复推理轨迹；第二阶段基于此轨迹生成个性化干扰项。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在140名学生中生成个性化干扰项效果最佳，并能推广到群体层面。

Conclusion: 该方法具有鲁棒性和适应性，为个性化教育评估提供了新思路。

Abstract: Distractors, incorrect but plausible answer choices in multiple-choice
questions (MCQs), play a critical role in educational assessment by diagnosing
student misconceptions. Recent work has leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to generate shared, group-level distractors by learning common error patterns
across large student populations. However, such distractors often fail to
capture the diverse reasoning errors of individual students, limiting their
diagnostic effectiveness. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of
personalized distractor generation, which aims to generate tailored distractors
based on individual misconceptions inferred from each student's past
question-answering (QA) records, ensuring every student receives options that
effectively exposes their specific reasoning errors. While promising, this task
is challenging because each student typically has only a few QA records, which
often lack the student's underlying reasoning processes, making training-based
group-level approaches infeasible. To overcome this, we propose a training-free
two-stage framework. In the first stage, we construct a student-specific
misconception prototype by applying Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to recover
the student's reasoning trajectories from past incorrect answers. In the second
stage, this prototype guides the simulation of the student's reasoning on new
questions, enabling the generation of personalized distractors that align with
the student's recurring misconceptions. Experiments show that our approach
achieves the best performance in generating plausible, personalized distractors
for 140 students, and also effectively generalizes to group-level settings,
highlighting its robustness and adaptability.

Motivation: 现有的多语言语音翻译模型参数量大，推理效率与性能难以平衡，尤其在本地部署场景下。

Method: 基于Whisper Medium模型，改进为whisperM2M，并集成KVSPN模块，结合推测采样和知识蒸馏技术。

Result: 在六种流行语言上实现SOTA性能，推理速度提升40%，无BLEU分数损失；结合蒸馏方法，速度提升2.6倍且性能更优。

Conclusion: Parasitic Dual-Scale Approach在多语言语音翻译中实现了高效与高性能的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advancements in speech-to-text translation have led to the development
of multilingual models capable of handling multiple language pairs
simultaneously. However, these unified models often suffer from large parameter
sizes, making it challenging to balance inference efficiency and performance,
particularly in local deployment scenarios. We propose an innovative Parasitic
Dual-Scale Approach, which combines an enhanced speculative sampling method
with model compression and knowledge distillation techniques. Building on the
Whisper Medium model, we enhance it for multilingual speech translation into
whisperM2M, and integrate our novel KVSPN module, achieving state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance across six popular languages with improved inference
efficiency. KVSPN enables a 40\% speedup with no BLEU score degradation.
Combined with distillation methods, it represents a 2.6$\times$ speedup over
the original Whisper Medium with superior performance.

Motivation: 检测社交媒体上的多模态虚假信息具有挑战性，现有方法未能捕捉事件级结构和时间动态。

Method: E-CaTCH通过聚类帖子为伪事件，提取文本和视觉特征，使用自注意力和跨模态注意力对齐特征，并通过时间窗口和LSTM建模时间动态。

Result: 在多个数据集上，E-CaTCH表现优于现有方法，并展示了跨数据集的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: E-CaTCH为多模态虚假信息检测提供了高效、可解释的解决方案，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Detecting multimodal misinformation on social media remains challenging due
to inconsistencies between modalities, changes in temporal patterns, and
substantial class imbalance. Many existing methods treat posts independently
and fail to capture the event-level structure that connects them across time
and modality. We propose E-CaTCH, an interpretable and scalable framework for
robustly detecting misinformation. If needed, E-CaTCH clusters posts into
pseudo-events based on textual similarity and temporal proximity, then
processes each event independently. Within each event, textual and visual
features are extracted using pre-trained BERT and ResNet encoders, refined via
intra-modal self-attention, and aligned through bidirectional cross-modal
attention. A soft gating mechanism fuses these representations to form
contextualized, content-aware embeddings of each post. To model temporal
evolution, E-CaTCH segments events into overlapping time windows and uses a
trend-aware LSTM, enhanced with semantic shift and momentum signals, to encode
narrative progression over time. Classification is performed at the event
level, enabling better alignment with real-world misinformation dynamics. To
address class imbalance and promote stable learning, the model integrates
adaptive class weighting, temporal consistency regularization, and hard-example
mining. The total loss is aggregated across all events. Extensive experiments
on Fakeddit, IND, and COVID-19 MISINFOGRAPH demonstrate that E-CaTCH
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Cross-dataset evaluations
further demonstrate its robustness, generalizability, and practical
applicability across diverse misinformation scenarios.

Motivation: 传统RAG方法在多跳问答任务中因忽略知识的结构关联而受限，而GraphRAG方法则过度依赖结构信息。HGRAG旨在平衡结构和语义信息的利用。

Method: 构建实体超图，节点为细粒度实体，超边为粗粒度段落；设计超图检索方法，结合实体和段落相似性；通过检索增强模块优化结果。

Result: 在基准数据集上，HGRAG在问答性能上优于现有方法，检索效率提升6倍。

Conclusion: HGRAG通过超图整合结构和语义信息，有效提升了多跳问答任务的性能和效率。

Abstract: Multi-hop question answering (MHQA) requires integrating knowledge scattered
across multiple passages to derive the correct answer. Traditional
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods primarily focus on coarse-grained
textual semantic similarity and ignore structural associations among dispersed
knowledge, which limits their effectiveness in MHQA tasks. GraphRAG methods
address this by leveraging knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture structural
associations, but they tend to overly rely on structural information and
fine-grained word- or phrase-level retrieval, resulting in an underutilization
of textual semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG approach called
HGRAG for MHQA that achieves cross-granularity integration of structural and
semantic information via hypergraphs. Structurally, we construct an entity
hypergraph where fine-grained entities serve as nodes and coarse-grained
passages as hyperedges, and establish knowledge association through shared
entities. Semantically, we design a hypergraph retrieval method that integrates
fine-grained entity similarity and coarse-grained passage similarity via
hypergraph diffusion. Finally, we employ a retrieval enhancement module, which
further refines the retrieved results both semantically and structurally, to
obtain the most relevant passages as context for answer generation with the
LLM. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in QA performance, and achieves a
6$\times$ speedup in retrieval efficiency.

Result: LLMs在形态复杂任务中表现差，英语类似特征任务表现较好；分词预处理有助提升。

Conclusion: 需改进语言特定分词器，提升LLMs对低资源语言的语言学推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in reasoning tasks,
but their performance on linguistics puzzles remains consistently poor. These
puzzles, often derived from Linguistics Olympiad (LO) contests, provide a
minimal contamination environment to assess LLMs' linguistic reasoning
abilities across low-resource languages. This work analyses LLMs' performance
on 629 problems across 41 low-resource languages by labelling each with
linguistically informed features to unveil weaknesses. Our analyses show that
LLMs struggle with puzzles involving higher morphological complexity and
perform better on puzzles involving linguistic features that are also found in
English. We also show that splitting words into morphemes as a pre-processing
step improves solvability, indicating a need for more informed and
language-specific tokenisers. These findings thus offer insights into some
challenges in linguistic reasoning and modelling of low-resource languages.

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in specific domain like tourism

persistent issues like hallucinations. We propose $\textbf{L}$able-Free
$\textbf{E}$valuation of LLM on $\textbf{T}$ourism using Expert
$\textbf{T}$ree-$\textbf{o}$f-$\textbf{T}$hought (LETToT), a framework that
leverages expert-derived reasoning structures-instead of labeled data-to access
LLMs in tourism. First, we iteratively refine and validate hierarchical ToT
components through alignment with generic quality dimensions and expert
feedback. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our systematically optimized
expert ToT with 4.99-14.15\% relative quality gains over baselines. Second, we
apply LETToT's optimized expert ToT to evaluate models of varying scales
(32B-671B parameters), revealing: (1) Scaling laws persist in specialized
domains (DeepSeek-V3 leads), yet reasoning-enhanced smaller models (e.g.,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B) close this gap; (2) For sub-72B models, explicit
reasoning architectures outperform counterparts in accuracy and conciseness
($p<0.05$). Our work established a scalable, label-free paradigm for
domain-specific LLM evaluation, offering a robust alternative to conventional
annotated benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展到其他语言和安全关键分类任务，为毒性检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting toxic content using language models is crucial yet challenging.
While substantial progress has been made in English, toxicity detection in
French remains underdeveloped, primarily due to the lack of culturally
relevant, large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce TOXIFRENCH, a new
public benchmark of 53,622 French online comments, constructed via a
semi-automated annotation pipeline that reduces manual labeling to only 10%
through high-confidence LLM-based pre-annotation and human verification. Then,
we benchmark a broad range of models and uncover a counterintuitive insight:
Small Language Models (SLMs) outperform many larger models in robustness and
generalization under the toxicity detection task. Motivated by this finding, we
propose a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy using a dynamic
weighted loss that progressively emphasizes the model's final decision,
significantly improving faithfulness. Our fine-tuned 4B model achieves
state-of-the-art performance, improving its F1 score by 13% over its baseline
and outperforming LLMs such as GPT-40 and Gemini-2.5. Further evaluation on a
cross-lingual toxicity benchmark demonstrates strong multilingual ability,
suggesting that our methodology can be effectively extended to other languages
and safety-critical classification tasks.

Motivation: 探讨LLM在心理健康问题回答中的情绪表达差异，为模型选择提供依据。

Conclusion: LLM的选择对心理健康应用至关重要，因其情绪表达差异可能显著影响用户体验和效果。

Abstract: Depression, anxiety, and stress are widespread mental health concerns that
increasingly drive individuals to seek information from Large Language Models
(LLMs). This study investigates how eight LLMs (Claude Sonnet, Copilot, Gemini
Pro, GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Llama, Mixtral, and Perplexity) reply to twenty
pragmatic questions about depression, anxiety, and stress when those questions
are framed for six user profiles (baseline, woman, man, young, old, and
university student). The models generated 2,880 answers, which we scored for
sentiment and emotions using state-of-the-art tools. Our analysis revealed that
optimism, fear, and sadness dominated the emotional landscape across all
outputs, with neutral sentiment maintaining consistently high values.
Gratitude, joy, and trust appeared at moderate levels, while emotions such as
anger, disgust, and love were rarely expressed. The choice of LLM significantly
influenced emotional expression patterns. Mixtral exhibited the highest levels
of negative emotions including disapproval, annoyance, and sadness, while Llama
demonstrated the most optimistic and joyful responses. The type of mental
health condition dramatically shaped emotional responses: anxiety prompts
elicited extraordinarily high fear scores (0.974), depression prompts generated
elevated sadness (0.686) and the highest negative sentiment, while
stress-related queries produced the most optimistic responses (0.755) with
elevated joy and trust. In contrast, demographic framing of queries produced
only marginal variations in emotional tone. Statistical analyses confirmed
significant model-specific and condition-specific differences, while
demographic influences remained minimal. These findings highlight the critical
importance of model selection in mental health applications, as each LLM
exhibits a distinct emotional signature that could significantly impact user
experience and outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的安全机制导致模型过度拒绝良性指令，影响生产应用中的实用性。

Method: 提出SafeConstellations方法，通过分析嵌入空间中的轨迹模式，选择性引导模型行为。

Result: 方法将过度拒绝率降低73%，对实用性影响最小。

Conclusion: SafeConstellations为减少过度拒绝提供了一种原则性方法，同时保持模型通用性。

Abstract: LLMs increasingly exhibit over-refusal behavior, where safety mechanisms
cause models to reject benign instructions that superficially resemble harmful
content. This phenomena diminishes utility in production applications that
repeatedly rely on common prompt templates or applications that frequently rely
on LLMs for specific tasks (e.g. sentiment analysis, language translation).
Through comprehensive evaluation, we demonstrate that LLMs still tend to refuse
responses to harmful instructions when those instructions are reframed to
appear as benign tasks. Our mechanistic analysis reveal that LLMs follow
distinct "constellation" patterns in embedding space as representations
traverse layers, with each task maintaining consistent trajectories that shift
predictably between refusal and non-refusal cases. We introduce
SafeConstellations, an inference-time trajectory-shifting approach that tracks
task-specific trajectory patterns and guides representations toward non-refusal
pathways. By selectively guiding model behavior only on tasks prone to
over-refusal, and by preserving general model behavior, our method reduces
over-refusal rates by up to 73% with minimal impact on utility-offering a
principled approach to mitigating over-refusals.

Conclusion: SGSimEval为ASG提供了更全面的评估方法，未来可进一步优化内容和参考文献生成。

Abstract: The growing interest in automatic survey generation (ASG), a task that
traditionally required considerable time and effort, has been spurred by recent
advances in large language models (LLMs). With advancements in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the rising popularity of multi-agent
systems (MASs), synthesizing academic surveys using LLMs has become a viable
approach, thereby elevating the need for robust evaluation methods in this
domain. However, existing evaluation methods suffer from several limitations,
including biased metrics, a lack of human preference, and an over-reliance on
LLMs-as-judges. To address these challenges, we propose SGSimEval, a
comprehensive benchmark for Survey Generation with Similarity-Enhanced
Evaluation that evaluates automatic survey generation systems by integrating
assessments of the outline, content, and references, and also combines
LLM-based scoring with quantitative metrics to provide a multifaceted
evaluation framework. In SGSimEval, we also introduce human preference metrics
that emphasize both inherent quality and similarity to humans. Extensive
experiments reveal that current ASG systems demonstrate human-comparable
superiority in outline generation, while showing significant room for
improvement in content and reference generation, and our evaluation metrics
maintain strong consistency with human assessments.

across various tasks. The study measures the trade-offs between model
compression and task performance, analyzing key evaluation metrics, namely
accuracy, inference latency, and throughput (total output tokens generated per
second), providing insights into the suitability of low-bit quantization for
real-world deployment. Using the results, users can then make suitable
decisions based on the specifications that need to be met. We discuss the pros
and cons of GSQ and GPTQ techniques on models of different sizes, which also
serve as a benchmark for future experiments.

Abstract: The proliferation of high-quality text from Large Language Models (LLMs)
demands reliable and efficient detection methods. While existing training-free
approaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and
overlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this
work, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel
paradigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency
domain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the
global Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier
Transform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits
significantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the
larger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the
suppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text. Based on this key insight, we
construct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the
global DFT: DFT total energy. We also propose an enhanced version,
SpecDetect++, which incorporates a sampling discrepancy mechanism to further
boost robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms the state-of-the-art model while running in nearly half the time.
Our work introduces a new, efficient, and interpretable pathway for
LLM-generated text detection, showing that classical signal processing
techniques offer a surprisingly powerful solution to this modern challenge.

Abstract: Automated feedback generation has the potential to enhance students' learning
progress by providing timely and targeted feedback. Moreover, it can assist
teachers in optimizing their time, allowing them to focus on more strategic and
personalized aspects of teaching. To generate high-quality, information-rich
formative feedback, it is essential first to extract relevant indicators, as
these serve as the foundation upon which the feedback is constructed. Teachers
often employ feedback criteria grids composed of various indicators that they
evaluate systematically. This study examines the initial phase of extracting
such indicators from students' submissions of a language learning course using
the large language model Llama 3.1. Accordingly, the alignment between
indicators generated by the LLM and human ratings across various feedback
criteria is investigated. The findings demonstrate statistically significant
strong correlations, even in cases involving unanticipated combinations of
indicators and criteria. The methodology employed in this paper offers a
promising foundation for extracting indicators from students' submissions using
LLMs. Such indicators can potentially be utilized to auto-generate explainable
and transparent formative feedback in future research.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）对提示的微小变化高度敏感，需要系统性评估提升鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 在统一实验框架下评估5种方法，测试了8个模型和52个任务，涵盖微调和上下文学习范式。

Result: 研究比较了不同方法的有效性，并扩展到前沿模型（如GPT-4.1和DeepSeek V3）。

Conclusion: 研究为实际应用中提升LLM的稳定性和可靠性提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to subtle, non-semantic
variations in prompt phrasing and formatting. In this work, we present the
first systematic evaluation of 5 methods for improving prompt robustness within
a unified experimental framework. We benchmark these techniques on 8 models
from Llama, Qwen and Gemma families across 52 tasks from Natural Instructions
dataset. Our evaluation covers robustness methods from both fine-tuned and
in-context learning paradigms, and tests their generalization against multiple
types of distribution shifts. Finally, we extend our analysis to GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek V3 to assess frontier models' current robustness to format
perturbations. Our findings offer actionable insights into the relative
effectiveness of these robustness methods, enabling practitioners to make
informed decisions when aiming for stable and reliable LLM performance in
real-world applications. Code:

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合推理与检索增强生成（RAG）的轻量级语言模型架构，适用于资源受限或隐私敏感环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统依赖大规模模型和外部API，难以满足高性能和隐私保护需求。

Method: 采用密集检索器与微调的Qwen2.5-Instruct模型，结合合成查询生成和推理轨迹，优化文档压缩与数据设计。

Result: 在特定领域微调显著提升答案准确性和一致性，接近前沿模型性能，适合本地部署。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境提供高效解决方案，代码开源支持跨领域复现与适配。

Abstract: This technical report details a novel approach to combining reasoning and
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) within a single, lean language model
architecture. While existing RAG systems typically rely on large-scale models
and external APIs, our work addresses the increasing demand for performant and
privacy-preserving solutions deployable in resource-constrained or secure
environments. Building on recent developments in test-time scaling and
small-scale reasoning models, we develop a retrieval augmented conversational
agent capable of interpreting complex, domain-specific queries using a
lightweight backbone model. Our system integrates a dense retriever with
fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Instruct models, using synthetic query generation and
reasoning traces derived from frontier models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) over a
curated corpus, in this case, the NHS A-to-Z condition pages. We explore the
impact of summarisation-based document compression, synthetic data design, and
reasoning-aware fine-tuning on model performance. Evaluation against both
non-reasoning and general-purpose lean models demonstrates that our
domain-specific fine-tuning approach yields substantial gains in answer
accuracy and consistency, approaching frontier-level performance while
remaining feasible for local deployment. All implementation details and code
are publicly released to support reproducibility and adaptation across domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于梯度优化的新方法，通过掩码输入生成神经网络的解释性说明，适用于文本和图像输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着神经网络模型的发展，对其预测结果的可解释性需求增加，需要一种无需专门训练模型即可生成解释的方法。

Method: 使用梯度优化和新的正则化方案，掩码输入中与预测无关的部分，确保解释的充分性、全面性和紧凑性。

Result: 方法在文本和图像分类任务中均生成高质量解释，证明其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需专门模型即可实现解释生成，为模型可解释性和理由提取领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Concurrent to the rapid progress in the development of neural-network based
models in areas like natural language processing and computer vision, the need
for creating explanations for the predictions of these black-box models has
risen steadily. We propose a new method to generate extractive explanations for
predictions made by neural networks, that is based on masking parts of the
input which the model does not consider to be indicative of the respective
class. The masking is done using gradient-based optimization combined with a
new regularization scheme that enforces sufficiency, comprehensiveness and
compactness of the generated explanation, three properties that are known to be
desirable from the related field of rationale extraction in natural language
processing. In this way, we bridge the gap between model interpretability and
rationale extraction, thereby proving that the latter of which can be performed
without training a specialized model, only on the basis of a trained
classifier. We further apply the same method to image inputs and obtain high
quality explanations for image classifications, which indicates that the
conditions proposed for rationale extraction in natural language processing are
more broadly applicable to different input types.

TL;DR: 提出一种端到端的可微训练范式，用于稳定训练基于Transformer的分类器，同时生成输入标记的相关性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法中训练不稳定和效率低的问题，并扩展为生成类别相关的解释。

Method: 简化传统的三玩家游戏框架，让单一模型同时扮演选择器、分类器和互补分类器的角色。

Result: 训练更高效稳定，生成的解释与人类标注对齐度显著提升，达到最新水平。

Conclusion: 该方法在稳定性和解释质量上优于现有方法，无需显式监督即可实现高性能。

Abstract: We propose an end-to-end differentiable training paradigm for stable training
of a rationalized transformer classifier. Our approach results in a single
model that simultaneously classifies a sample and scores input tokens based on
their relevance to the classification. To this end, we build on the widely-used
three-player-game for training rationalized models, which typically relies on
training a rationale selector, a classifier and a complement classifier. We
simplify this approach by making a single model fulfill all three roles,
leading to a more efficient training paradigm that is not susceptible to the
common training instabilities that plague existing approaches. Further, we
extend this paradigm to produce class-wise rationales while incorporating
recent advances in parameterizing and regularizing the resulting rationales,
thus leading to substantially improved and state-of-the-art alignment with
human annotations without any explicit supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过简单方法调整语言模型的价值观系统，避免依赖大量训练数据。

Method: 构建价值观调查问题作为基准，微调模型回答这些问题，并评估其在领域内和领域外任务中的行为变化。

Result: 微调不仅改变了模型对调查问题的回答，还显著影响了其在情境化任务中的行为。

Conclusion: 简单的方法可以有效调整语言模型的价值观系统，实现下游任务中的价值对齐。

Abstract: Large language models implicitly encode preferences over human values, yet
steering them often requires large training data. In this work, we investigate
a simple approach: Can we reliably modify a model's value system in downstream
behavior by training it to answer value survey questions accordingly? We first
construct value profiles of several open-source LLMs by asking them to rate a
series of value-related descriptions spanning 20 distinct human values, which
we use as a baseline for subsequent experiments. We then investigate whether
the value system of a model can be governed by fine-tuning on the value
surveys. We evaluate the effect of finetuning on the model's behavior in two
ways; first, we assess how answers change on in-domain, held-out survey
questions. Second, we evaluate whether the model's behavior changes in
out-of-domain settings (situational scenarios). To this end, we construct a
contextualized moral judgment dataset based on Reddit posts and evaluate
changes in the model's behavior in text-based adventure games. We demonstrate
that our simple approach can not only change the model's answers to in-domain
survey questions, but also produces substantial shifts (value alignment) in
implicit downstream task behavior.

TL;DR: HumorPlanSearch通过模块化流程（包括策略搜索、幽默思维链、知识图谱、新颖性过滤和迭代修订）提升LLM生成幽默的上下文敏感性和喜剧质量，实验显示HGS提升15.4%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的幽默常显得泛泛、重复或不合适，因为幽默依赖于文化背景和即时语境。

Method: 提出HumorPlanSearch，包含Plan-Search、Humor Chain-of-Thought、知识图谱、新颖性过滤和迭代修订五个模块。

Result: 实验表明，完整流程（知识图谱+修订）使HGS均值提升15.4%（p < 0.05）。

Conclusion: HumorPlanSearch通过强调上下文，推动AI幽默向更具连贯性、适应性和文化敏感性的方向发展。

Abstract: Automated humor generation with Large Language Models (LLMs) often yields
jokes that feel generic, repetitive, or tone-deaf because humor is deeply
situated and hinges on the listener's cultural background, mindset, and
immediate context. We introduce HumorPlanSearch, a modular pipeline that
explicitly models context through: (1) Plan-Search for diverse, topic-tailored
strategies; (2) Humor Chain-of-Thought (HuCoT) templates capturing cultural and
stylistic reasoning; (3) a Knowledge Graph to retrieve and adapt
high-performing historical strategies; (4) novelty filtering via semantic
embeddings; and (5) an iterative judge-driven revision loop. To evaluate
context sensitivity and comedic quality, we propose the Humor Generation Score
(HGS), which fuses direct ratings, multi-persona feedback, pairwise win-rates,
and topic relevance. In experiments across nine topics with feedback from 13
human judges, our full pipeline (KG + Revision) boosts mean HGS by 15.4 percent
(p < 0.05) over a strong baseline. By foregrounding context at every stage from
strategy planning to multi-signal evaluation, HumorPlanSearch advances
AI-driven humor toward more coherent, adaptive, and culturally attuned comedy.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在区分反性别歧视言论与性别歧视言论时的困难，发现模型常将反性别歧视言论误判为有害内容，尤其是在政治敏感事件中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化内容审核系统可能误判反性别歧视言论，导致边缘化声音被压制，影响民主辩论。

Method: 分析了五个LLMs对英国2022年涉及女性议员的推文的分类表现，重点关注高显著性触发事件。

Result: 模型常将反性别歧视言论误判为有害，尤其在政治敏感事件中，错误率较高。

Conclusion: 建议审核设计超越二元分类，整合人工审核，并在训练数据中明确包含反言论，以保护数字政治空间中的抵抗言论。

Abstract: Anti-sexist speech, i.e., public expressions that challenge or resist
gendered abuse and sexism, plays a vital role in shaping democratic debate
online. Yet automated content moderation systems, increasingly powered by large
language models (LLMs), may struggle to distinguish such resistance from the
sexism it opposes. This study examines how five LLMs classify sexist,
anti-sexist, and neutral political tweets from the UK, focusing on
high-salience trigger events involving female Members of Parliament in the year
2022. Our analysis show that models frequently misclassify anti-sexist speech
as harmful, particularly during politically charged events where rhetorical
styles of harm and resistance converge. These errors risk silencing those who
challenge sexism, with disproportionate consequences for marginalised voices.
We argue that moderation design must move beyond binary harmful/not-harmful
schemas, integrate human-in-the-loop review during sensitive events, and
explicitly include counter-speech in training data. By linking feminist
scholarship, event-based analysis, and model evaluation, this work highlights
the sociotechnical challenges of safeguarding resistance speech in digital
political spaces.

TL;DR: CoDiEmb框架通过任务专用目标、动态采样器和模型融合策略，解决了信息检索（IR）和语义文本相似性（STS）联合训练中的负迁移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联合训练IR和STS任务时，负迁移问题导致性能下降，需要一种系统化解耦任务特定学习信号的方法。

Method: CoDiEmb采用任务专用目标、动态采样器平衡更新、delta引导的模型融合策略，以及高效的单阶段训练流程。

Result: 在15个基准测试中，CoDiEmb不仅缓解了任务间性能冲突，还提升了嵌入空间的几何特性。

Conclusion: CoDiEmb为统一文本嵌入学习提供了一种有效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning unified text embeddings that excel across diverse downstream tasks
is a central goal in representation learning, yet negative transfer remains a
persistent obstacle. This challenge is particularly pronounced when jointly
training a single encoder for Information Retrieval (IR) and Semantic Textual
Similarity (STS), two essential but fundamentally disparate tasks for which
naive co-training typically yields steep performance trade-offs. We argue that
resolving this conflict requires systematically decoupling task-specific
learning signals throughout the training pipeline. To this end, we introduce
CoDiEmb, a unified framework that reconciles the divergent requirements of IR
and STS in a collaborative yet distinct manner. CoDiEmb integrates three key
innovations for effective joint optimization: (1) Task-specialized objectives
paired with a dynamic sampler that forms single-task batches and balances
per-task updates, thereby preventing gradient interference. For IR, we employ a
contrastive loss with multiple positives and hard negatives, augmented by
cross-device sampling. For STS, we adopt order-aware objectives that directly
optimize correlation and ranking consistency. (2) A delta-guided model fusion
strategy that computes fine-grained merging weights for checkpoints by
analyzing each parameter's deviation from its pre-trained initialization,
proving more effective than traditional Model Soups. (3) An efficient,
single-stage training pipeline that is simple to implement and converges
stably. Extensive experiments on 15 standard IR and STS benchmarks across three
base encoders validate CoDiEmb. Our results and analysis demonstrate that the
framework not only mitigates cross-task trade-offs but also measurably improves
the geometric properties of the embedding space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感分析多基于纯文本，但营销理论指出客户评价受额外参考点影响，因此研究补充信息对LLM情感分析的影响。

Method: 比较自然语言和JSON格式提示，使用3B参数的轻量级模型，在Yelp的餐厅和夜生活类别上进行实验。

Result: JSON提示性能优于基线，Macro-F1提升1.6%和4%，RMSE降低16%和9.1%，且性能提升源于真实上下文推理。

Conclusion: 结构化提示可使小模型实现竞争性性能，为资源受限场景提供实用替代方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now widely used across many fields,
including marketing research. Sentiment analysis, in particular, helps firms
understand consumer preferences. While most NLP studies classify sentiment from
review text alone, marketing theories, such as prospect theory and
expectation--disconfirmation theory, point out that customer evaluations are
shaped not only by the actual experience but also by additional reference
points. This study therefore investigates how the content and format of such
supplementary information affect sentiment analysis using LLMs. We compare
natural language (NL) and JSON-formatted prompts using a lightweight 3B
parameter model suitable for practical marketing applications. Experiments on
two Yelp categories (Restaurant and Nightlife) show that the JSON prompt with
additional information outperforms all baselines without fine-tuning: Macro-F1
rises by 1.6% and 4% while RMSE falls by 16% and 9.1%, respectively, making it
deployable in resource-constrained edge devices. Furthermore, a follow-up
analysis confirms that performance gains stem from genuine contextual reasoning
rather than label proxying. This work demonstrates that structured prompting
can enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance, offering a
practical alternative to large-scale model deployment.

TL;DR: 研究探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否表现出物种主义偏见，发现其能识别物种主义言论但很少谴责，且在道德权衡中更倾向于人类而非动物。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs广泛应用，研究其伦理倾向至关重要，尤其是对非人类动物的物种主义偏见。

Method: 通过三个范式研究：SpeciesismBench基准测试、心理学测量比较人类与模型反应、文本生成任务。

Result: LLMs能识别物种主义言论但很少谴责，在权衡中更倾向于人类，但在认知能力相等时无物种偏好。

Conclusion: 需将非人类道德主体纳入AI公平性框架，以减少物种主义偏见。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more widely deployed, it is crucial to
examine their ethical tendencies. Building on research on fairness and
discrimination in AI, we investigate whether LLMs exhibit speciesist bias --
discrimination based on species membership -- and how they value non-human
animals. We systematically examine this issue across three paradigms: (1)
SpeciesismBench, a 1,003-item benchmark assessing recognition and moral
evaluation of speciesist statements; (2) established psychological measures
comparing model responses with those of human participants; (3) text-generation
tasks probing elaboration on, or resistance to, speciesist rationalizations. In
our benchmark, LLMs reliably detected speciesist statements but rarely
condemned them, often treating speciesist attitudes as morally acceptable. On
psychological measures, results were mixed: LLMs expressed slightly lower
explicit speciesism than people, yet in direct trade-offs they more often chose
to save one human over multiple animals. A tentative interpretation is that
LLMs may weight cognitive capacity rather than species per se: when capacities
were equal, they showed no species preference, and when an animal was described
as more capable, they tended to prioritize it over a less capable human. In
open-ended text generation tasks, LLMs frequently normalized or rationalized
harm toward farmed animals while refusing to do so for non-farmed animals.
These findings suggest that while LLMs reflect a mixture of progressive and
mainstream human views, they nonetheless reproduce entrenched cultural norms
around animal exploitation. We argue that expanding AI fairness and alignment
frameworks to explicitly include non-human moral patients is essential for
reducing these biases and preventing the entrenchment of speciesist attitudes
in AI systems and the societies they influence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 认知科学与神经科学长期面临区分语言表征与概念意义表征的挑战，语言模型中也存在类似问题。

Method: 通过两个神经指标研究：大脑激活水平（针对语言处理）和跨模态意义一致性（量化大脑区域对同一概念的反应一致性）。

Result: 实验表明，语言模型在意义一致性更强的大脑区域预测信号更好，即使这些区域对语言处理不敏感。

Conclusion: 语言模型可能内在地表征跨模态概念意义。

Abstract: Cognitive science and neuroscience have long faced the challenge of
disentangling representations of language from representations of conceptual
meaning. As the same problem arises in today's language models (LMs), we
investigate the relationship between LM--brain alignment and two neural
metrics: (1) the level of brain activation during processing of sentences,
targeting linguistic processing, and (2) a novel measure of meaning consistency
across input modalities, which quantifies how consistently a brain region
responds to the same concept across paradigms (sentence, word cloud, image)
using an fMRI dataset (Pereira et al., 2018). Our experiments show that both
language-only and language-vision models predict the signal better in more
meaning-consistent areas of the brain, even when these areas are not strongly
sensitive to language processing, suggesting that LMs might internally
represent cross-modal conceptual meaning.

Method: 采用多智能体框架模拟医患对话，引入自适应提问机制和树状记忆结构动态更新信息。

Result: 在DAIC-WOZ数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效提升心理健康评估的自动化和准确性。

Abstract: Mental health assessment is crucial for early intervention and effective
treatment, yet traditional clinician-based approaches are limited by the
shortage of qualified professionals. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
have sparked growing interest in automated psychological assessment, yet most
existing approaches are constrained by their reliance on static text analysis,
limiting their ability to capture deeper and more informative insights that
emerge through dynamic interaction and iterative questioning. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose a multi-agent framework for mental health evaluation
that simulates clinical doctor-patient dialogues, with specialized agents
assigned to questioning, adequacy evaluation, scoring, and updating. We
introduce an adaptive questioning mechanism in which an evaluation agent
assesses the adequacy of user responses to determine the necessity of
generating targeted follow-up queries to address ambiguity and missing
information. Additionally, we employ a tree-structured memory in which the root
node encodes the user's basic information, while child nodes (e.g., topic and
statement) organize key information according to distinct symptom categories
and interaction turns. This memory is dynamically updated throughout the
interaction to reduce redundant questioning and further enhance the information
extraction and contextual tracking capabilities. Experimental results on the
DAIC-WOZ dataset illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which
achieves better performance than existing approaches.

Result: 实验显示，DR. SAF减少49.27%的响应token，提升6.59倍token效率，训练时间减少5倍。

Conclusion: DR. SAF在资源有限环境下高效，极端训练中甚至超越传统模型。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved
their capabilities on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought
(CoT). However, this approach often results in substantial redundancy,
impairing computational efficiency and causing significant delays in real-time
applications. To improve the efficiency, current methods often rely on
human-defined difficulty priors, which do not align with the LLM's self-awared
difficulty, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamic
Reasoning-Boundary Self-Awareness Framework (DR. SAF), which enables models to
dynamically assess and adjust their reasoning depth in response to problem
complexity. DR. SAF integrates three key components: Boundary Self-Awareness
Alignment, Adaptive Reward Management, and a Boundary Preservation Mechanism.
These components allow models to optimize their reasoning processes, balancing
efficiency and accuracy without compromising performance. Our experimental
results demonstrate that DR. SAF achieves a 49.27% reduction in total response
tokens with minimal loss in accuracy. The framework also delivers a 6.59x gain
in token efficiency and a 5x reduction in training time, making it well-suited
to resource-limited settings. During extreme training, DR. SAF can even surpass
traditional instruction-based models in token efficiency with more than 16%
accuracy improvement.

Motivation: 开发更接近人类听觉处理的语音表示学习模型，以高效处理多种语音任务。

Method: 第一阶段将原始音频转换为基于人类耳蜗的时频表示，提取离散的耳蜗标记；第二阶段对耳蜗标记应用自回归序列模型。

Result: AuriStream学习到有意义的音素和单词表示，并在SUPERB语音任务中表现优异，同时能生成可解码的音频延续。

Conclusion: AuriStream为语音表示学习提供了一个高效的两阶段框架，推动了更接近人类听觉的模型发展。

Abstract: We introduce AuriStream, a biologically inspired model for encoding speech
via a two-stage framework inspired by the human auditory processing hierarchy.
The first stage transforms raw audio into a time-frequency representation based
on the human cochlea, from which we extract discrete \textbf{cochlear tokens}.
The second stage applies an autoregressive sequence model over the cochlear
tokens. AuriStream learns meaningful phoneme and word representations, and
state-of-the-art lexical semantics. AuriStream shows competitive performance on
diverse downstream SUPERB speech tasks. Complementing AuriStream's strong
representational capabilities, it generates continuations of audio which can be
visualized in a spectrogram space and decoded back into audio, providing
insights into the model's predictions. In summary, we present a two-stage
framework for speech representation learning to advance the development of more
human-like models that efficiently handle a range of speech-based tasks.

Motivation: 现有视觉蕴含数据集规模小且稀疏，手动创建耗时费力。

Method: 利用SNLI文本前提通过Stable Diffusion生成图像，构建合成数据集，并通过CLIP特征向量训练视觉蕴含分类器进行评估。

Result: 合成数据在SNLI-VE和SICK-VTE数据集上仅导致F-score轻微下降（0.686 vs 0.703；0.384 vs 0.400）。

Conclusion: 合成数据在数据稀缺时是训练视觉蕴含模型的有效替代方案。

Abstract: In this paper we present and validate a new synthetic dataset for training
visual entailment models. Existing datasets for visual entailment are small and
sparse compared to datasets for textual entailment. Manually creating datasets
is labor-intensive. We base our synthetic dataset on the SNLI dataset for
textual entailment. We take the premise text from SNLI as input prompts in a
generative image model, Stable Diffusion, creating an image to replace each
textual premise. We evaluate our dataset both intrinsically and extrinsically.
For extrinsic evaluation, we evaluate the validity of the generated images by
using them as training data for a visual entailment classifier based on CLIP
feature vectors. We find that synthetic training data only leads to a slight
drop in quality on SNLI-VE, with an F-score 0.686 compared to 0.703 when
trained on real data. We also compare the quality of our generated training
data to original training data on another dataset: SICK-VTE. Again, there is
only a slight drop in F-score: from 0.400 to 0.384. These results indicate that
in settings with data sparsity, synthetic data can be a promising solution for
training visual entailment models.

baseline models, we demonstrate that TinyTim V1 produces a statistically
distinct generative profile characterized by high lexical diversity and low
semantic coherence. These findings are interpreted through theories of
creativity and complex problem-solving, arguing that such specialized models
can function as divergent knowledge sources within more extensive creative
architectures, powering automated discovery mechanisms in diverse settings.

*Samantha Aziz,Oleg Komogortsev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于潜在噪声自编码器的隐私增强机制，保护用户视线数据隐私，同时保持数据可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视线数据在跨会话使用中的隐私问题，防止未经同意的用户重识别。

Method: 使用潜在噪声自编码器，平衡隐私与数据实用性，保留生理合理的视线模式。

Result: 显著降低生物识别可能性，同时最小化实用性损失。

Conclusion: 该机制为视线数据隐私保护提供了有效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a privacy-enhancing mechanism for gaze signals using a
latent-noise autoencoder that prevents users from being re-identified across
play sessions without their consent, while retaining the usability of the data
for benign tasks. We evaluate privacy-utility trade-offs across biometric
identification and gaze prediction tasks, showing that our approach
significantly reduces biometric identifiability with minimal utility
degradation. Unlike prior methods in this direction, our framework retains
physiologically plausible gaze patterns suitable for downstream use, which
produces favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work advances privacy in
gaze-based systems by providing a usable and effective mechanism for protecting
sensitive gaze data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视频语言理解领域已有广泛研究，但针对VTG-MLLMs的全面综述仍稀缺，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用三维分类法：1) MLLMs的功能角色；2) 训练范式；3) 视频特征处理技术。

Result: VTG-MLLMs在性能和多任务、多领域泛化能力上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 本文总结了VTG-MLLMs的现状，指出了现有局限并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The recent advancement in video temporal grounding (VTG) has significantly
enhanced fine-grained video understanding, primarily driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). With superior multimodal comprehension and reasoning
abilities, VTG approaches based on MLLMs (VTG-MLLMs) are gradually surpassing
traditional fine-tuned methods. They not only achieve competitive performance
but also excel in generalization across zero-shot, multi-task, and multi-domain
settings. Despite extensive surveys on general video-language understanding,
comprehensive reviews specifically addressing VTG-MLLMs remain scarce. To fill
this gap, this survey systematically examines current research on VTG-MLLMs
through a three-dimensional taxonomy: 1) the functional roles of MLLMs,
highlighting their architectural significance; 2) training paradigms, analyzing
strategies for temporal reasoning and task adaptation; and 3) video feature
processing techniques, which determine spatiotemporal representation
effectiveness. We further discuss benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and
summarize empirical findings. Finally, we identify existing limitations and
propose promising research directions. For additional resources and details,

TL;DR: VSF是一种通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号来动态抑制不需要内容的方法，适用于少步扩散和流匹配图像生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如CFG、NASA和NAG在负提示引导上存在不足，VSF旨在更高效地抑制不需要的内容。

Method: VSF通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号实现动态抑制，计算开销小，兼容多种架构。

Result: 实验表明VSF在少步模型中显著优于现有方法，且在非少步模型中也能与CFG竞争。

Conclusion: VSF是一种高效且通用的负提示引导方法，适用于多种图像生成任务。

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in

### [48] [Relative Pose Regression with Pose Auto-Encoders: Enhancing Accuracy and Data Efficiency for Retail Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10933)
*Yoli Shavit,Yosi Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于相机姿态自动编码器（PAE）的相对姿态回归（RPR）方法，用于改进单图像绝对姿态回归（APR）的定位精度，无需额外存储图像或姿态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代零售环境中，精确的相机定位对提升客户体验、优化库存管理和实现自主操作至关重要。现有的APR方法虽然有效，但结合视觉和空间场景先验的方法通常更准确。

Method: 扩展PAE至RPR任务，提出一种新的重定位方案，利用PAE-based RPR优化APR预测，无需额外数据存储。

Result: 实验表明，PAE-based RPR优于等效架构的图像RPR模型，且在室内基准测试中显著提升APR定位精度。仅用30%数据训练时，性能仍具竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了零售部署中的数据收集负担，同时保持高精度定位。

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for modern retail environments,
enabling enhanced customer experiences, streamlined inventory management, and
autonomous operations. While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image
offers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial
scene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs)
have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we
extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel
re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR,
without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce
PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based
RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement
strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on
indoor benchmarks. Notably, our method is shown to achieve competitive
performance even when trained with only 30% of the data, substantially reducing
the data collection burden for retail deployment. Our code and pre-trained
models are available at: https://github.com/yolish/camera-pose-auto-encoders

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViPE是一种高效视频处理引擎，用于从无约束视频中估计相机参数和深度图，支持多种场景和相机模型，性能优于现有基线，并开源了大规模标注数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决野外视频中3D标注数据获取困难的问题，推动空间AI系统的发展。

Method: ViPE通过处理无约束视频，估计相机内参、运动和密集深度图，支持多种相机模型和场景。

Result: ViPE在TUM/KITTI基准上性能提升18%/50%，运行速度3-5FPS，并标注了包含100K真实视频和1M AI生成视频的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: ViPE及其开源数据集有望加速空间AI系统的开发。

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide
range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on
large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from
in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a
handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE
efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric
depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios,
including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports
various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We
have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing
uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and
runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to
annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around
100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K
panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with
accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the
annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI
systems.

*Qi Liu,Yabei Li,Hongsong Wang,Lei He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出HQ-OV3D框架，专注于生成高质量伪标签，提升开放词汇3D检测的几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统封闭集3D检测无法满足开放世界应用需求，现有开放词汇方法忽视几何质量。

Method: 框架包含IMCV提案生成器和ACA去噪器，利用跨模态几何一致性和标注类几何先验。

Result: 在新型类别上mAP提升7.37%，伪标签质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HQ-OV3D可作为独立检测器或高质量伪标签生成器，提升开放词汇检测性能。

Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of
open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D
detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of
pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language
models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of
pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,
remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality
Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and
refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework
comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal
Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate
high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)
Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors
from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to
the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our
approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating
the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D
can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also
as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary
detection or annotation pipelines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏3D语义高斯泼溅的协作3D语义占据预测方法，解决了现有方法的高通信成本或依赖深度估计的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在协作场景中面临高通信成本或依赖深度估计的局限性，需要一种更高效且不依赖额外监督的解决方案。

Method: 通过共享和融合中间高斯基元，实现跨代理融合、几何与语义联合编码，以及稀疏对象中心消息传递。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU指标上分别比单代理感知和基线协作方法提升8.42、3.28点和5.11、22.41点，通信量减少至34.6%时仍保持性能优势。

Conclusion: 该方法在协作感知中显著提升了性能，同时降低了通信成本，适用于有限通信预算的场景。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information,
overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in
single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D
semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur
high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth
estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to
collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first
approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D
semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian
primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based
cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent
Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which
reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and
sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while
reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods
by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU,
respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our
method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6%
communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited
communication budgets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的面部超分辨率方法IDFSR，通过身份解耦和拟合技术，在极端退化场景下提升身份一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在极端退化（如8倍以上缩放）下难以恢复真实且身份一致的面部图像，常产生幻觉效果。

Method: IDFSR采用三种关键设计：1）掩蔽低分辨率图像中的面部区域；2）对齐参考图像以提供风格指导；3）利用真实图像的ID嵌入进行细粒度建模。

Result: IDFSR在极端退化条件下显著优于现有方法，尤其在身份一致性上表现突出。

Conclusion: IDFSR通过身份解耦和拟合技术，有效解决了极端退化下的面部超分辨率问题。

Abstract: In recent years, face super-resolution (FSR) methods have achieved remarkable
progress, generally maintaining high image fidelity and identity (ID)
consistency under standard settings. However, in extreme degradation scenarios
(e.g., scale $> 8\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often
severely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models
to reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to
generate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images
lacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
FSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID
restoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.
Our approach involves three key designs: 1) \textbf{Masking} the facial region
in the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)
\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style
guidance; 3) Leveraging \textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)
images for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first
pretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing
it to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity
embeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform
lightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID
images. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID
information, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual
quality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate
that the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under
extreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID
consistency.

Abstract: Accurate identification of wood species plays a critical role in ecological
monitoring, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable forest management.
Traditional classification approaches relying on macroscopic and microscopic
inspection are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge. In this study, we
explore the application of deep learning to automate the classification of ten
wood species commonly found in Vietnam. A custom image dataset was constructed
from field-collected wood samples, and five state-of-the-art convolutional
neural network architectures--ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileViT, MobileNetV3,
and ShuffleNetV2--were evaluated. Among these, ShuffleNetV2 achieved the best
balance between classification performance and computational efficiency, with
an average accuracy of 99.29\% and F1-score of 99.35\% over 20 independent
runs. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight deep learning
models for real-time, high-accuracy species identification in
resource-constrained environments. Our work contributes to the growing field of
ecological informatics by providing scalable, image-based solutions for
automated wood classification and forest biodiversity assessment.

Abstract: This paper presents NIRMAL Pooling, a novel pooling layer for Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) that integrates adaptive max pooling with non-linear
activation function for image classification tasks. The acronym NIRMAL stands
for Non-linear Activation, Intermediate Aggregation, Reduction, Maximum,
Adaptive, and Localized. By dynamically adjusting pooling parameters based on
desired output dimensions and applying a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation post-pooling, NIRMAL Pooling improves robustness and feature
expressiveness. We evaluated its performance against standard Max Pooling on
three benchmark datasets: MNIST Digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR-10. NIRMAL
Pooling achieves test accuracies of 99.25% (vs. 99.12% for Max Pooling) on
MNIST Digits, 91.59% (vs. 91.44%) on MNIST Fashion, and 70.49% (vs. 68.87%) on
CIFAR-10, demonstrating consistent improvements, particularly on complex
datasets. This work highlights the potential of NIRMAL Pooling to enhance CNN
performance in diverse image recognition tasks, offering a flexible and
reliable alternative to traditional pooling methods.

Motivation: 随着智能手机和VR/AR技术的普及，环境中可能出现更多与虚拟元素连接的物体，检测这些物体是触发后续交互的第一步。

Method: 提出了一种名为“方向直方图形状”的新特征描述符，用于描述Artcode的拓扑结构，并构建了检测系统。

Result: 实验表明，该特征描述符能有效表示拓扑结构，系统在Artcode检测中表现良好。

Conclusion: 尽管是初步尝试，但该研究为拓扑物体检测开辟了新方向，并可能激发更多应用。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and resurgence of VR/AR techniques, it
is expected that our everyday environment may soon be decorating with objects
connecting with virtual elements. Alerting to the presence of these objects is
therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and
triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a
special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and
machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform
appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this
problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,
a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but
geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with
this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of
orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an
Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate
the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature
vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature
vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the
system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial
attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects
like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark
potential applications of topological object detection.

Motivation: 理解纺织增强复合材料的多尺度结构对预测其机械性能至关重要，尤其是嵌套行为对刚度、渗透性和损伤容限的影响。

Method: 采用低分辨率CT进行原位压实实验，利用3D-UNet对材料相进行语义分割，并通过两点相关函数分析空间结构。

Result: 模型的分割性能优异（IoU为0.822，F1分数为0.902），提取的几何特征与显微图像验证结果一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为从工业CT数据中提取关键几何特征提供了可靠途径，并为复合材料预成型体的逆向建模和描述符分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is
essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting --
characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local
interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining
mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance.
This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile
reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT).
In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking
configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A
tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill
phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of
50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822
and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using
the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction
of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong
agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust
approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT
data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based
structural analysis of composite preforms.

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses
a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the
diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a
complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection,
Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using
OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000
frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather
scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This
dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to
perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video
frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected
potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and
frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly
web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under
challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road
assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the
website. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable,
offering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing
regions, making the system automated. iWatchRoad is available at

Conclusion: IPG在对抗性补丁防御和实际应用（如自动驾驶、安全系统和医学影像）中具有潜力，能提升AI模型在动态高风险环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

TL;DR: MedAtlas是一个新的医疗AI基准框架，旨在评估大语言模型在真实医疗推理任务中的表现，支持多轮对话、多模态图像交互和多任务集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医疗多模态基准通常局限于单图像、单轮任务，无法反映临床实践中的多模态交互和纵向特性，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: MedAtlas框架包含多轮对话、多模态图像交互、多任务集成和高临床保真度，支持四种核心任务，并提供专家标注的金标准和两种新评估指标。

Result: 现有多模态模型在多阶段临床推理中表现不佳，MedAtlas揭示了显著的性能差距。

Conclusion: MedAtlas为开发稳健可信的医疗AI提供了一个具有挑战性的评估平台。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical
decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse
real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a
major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited
to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image
integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive
nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce
MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language
models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four
key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction,
multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core
tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn
question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease
diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates
temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging
modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to
perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas
provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose
two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation
Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal
substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas
establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of
robust and trustworthy medical AI.

TL;DR: FastFOD-Net是一种基于深度学习的FOD增强框架，显著提升了临床MRI数据的分析效率和准确性，并在多种神经系统疾病中验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床单壳低角度分辨率MRI数据生成可靠FOD的挑战，推动深度学习在扩散MRI增强中的临床应用。

Method: 采用加速的端到端深度学习框架FastFOD-Net，优化FOD估计，提升训练和推理效率。

Result: FastFOD-Net在健康对照和六种神经系统疾病中表现出色，分析速度比前代快60倍，且结果与高质量研究数据相当。

Conclusion: FastFOD-Net有望加速临床神经科学研究，提升疾病鉴别和连接组分析的可靠性，推动深度学习在扩散MRI中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling
technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key
step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability
and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and
the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs
from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and
low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially
be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement
techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been
assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their
clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement
framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders.
This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with
superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical
use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most
comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential
of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering
diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability
in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample
size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread
adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for
diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of
real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with
high-quality research acquisitions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在多模态任务中表现优异，但仍受限于数据质量、复杂任务表现不足及评估方法不完善，需借助外部工具提升。

Method: 通过四个维度分析外部工具的作用：数据获取与标注、任务表现提升、评估方法改进、当前局限与未来方向。

Result: 外部工具能显著提升MLLMs的性能和可靠性，尤其在数据质量和复杂任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: 外部工具对MLLMs的发展具有变革性潜力，未来需进一步探索其应用与优化。

Abstract: By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the
generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various
multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general
intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data,
poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation
protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs
across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external
tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with
external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a
promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance.
Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools:
(1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality
multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on
challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate
evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of
tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the
transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities,
offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了ORBIT基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型在对象属性推理上的表现，发现现有模型在复杂推理和真实图像上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉问答基准在对象属性推理上存在局限性，缺乏代表性和复杂性，因此需要系统性评估框架。

Method: 引入包含三种图像类型、三种推理复杂度和四种对象属性的评估框架，并开发ORBIT基准测试（360张图像和1,080个问题）。

Result: 在零样本设置下，12个先进视觉语言模型表现显著低于人类，最佳模型准确率仅40%，尤其在真实图像和复杂推理上表现差。

Conclusion: ORBIT揭示了现有模型的局限性，呼吁开发更可扩展的基准测试方法和更强的推理模型。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress on many
popular visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, it remains unclear whether
they abstract and reason over depicted objects. Inspired by human object
categorisation, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognising
low-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current VQA benchmarks
consider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically
blend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of
reasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic
evaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning
levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by
prior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this
benchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object
properties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based
questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings
reveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing
model only reaching 40\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic
(photographic) images, counterfactual reasoning about physical and functional
properties, and higher counts. ORBIT points to the need to develop methods for
scalable benchmarking, generalize annotation guidelines, and explore additional
reasoning VLMs. We make the ORBIT benchmark and the experimental code available
to support such endeavors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于高光谱成像（HSI）的方法，通过选择信息量最大的波段来减少视觉模糊，提高对弱势道路使用者（VRU）的识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决汽车感知系统在RGB图像中因同色异谱现象导致的视觉模糊问题，从而提升对VRU的识别和道路安全。

Method: 结合信息论技术（联合互信息最大化、相关性分析）和图像质量指标（对比信噪比），选择最具信息量的HSI波段，并重构伪彩色图像进行对比。

Result: 选定的HSI波段（497 nm、607 nm、895 nm）显著提高了VRU与背景的区分度，各项指标（欧氏距离、SAM、T²、CIE ΔE）均优于RGB图像。

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化光谱输入，显著减少了同色异谱混淆，为ADAS和自动驾驶的下游感知任务提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) is a critical safety challenge for
automotive perception systems, particularly under visual ambiguity caused by
metamerism, a phenomenon where distinct materials appear similar in RGB
imagery. This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this
limitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum,
especially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent
high-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that
integrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information
maximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image
quality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally
informative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we
identify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\pm$27 nm) and
reconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB.
Quantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual
separability of VRU from the background. The selected HSI bands yield
improvements of 70.24%, 528.46%, 1206.83%, and 246.62% for dissimilarity
(Euclidean, SAM, $T^2$) and perception (CIE $\Delta E$) metrics, consistently
outperforming RGB and confirming a marked reduction in metameric confusion. By
providing a spectrally optimized input, our method enhances VRU separability,
establishing a robust foundation for downstream perception tasks in Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), ultimately
contributing to improved road safety.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVCtrl是一种轻量级控制适配器，通过时空双缓存策略减少冗余计算，显著提升图像和视频生成的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet虽然能提供精确的空间-时间控制，但引入了高延迟和冗余计算，尤其是在视频生成中。

Method: 提出EVCtrl，采用时空双缓存策略：空间上分区网络为全局和局部功能区域，时间上选择性跳过不必要的去噪步骤。

Result: 在CogVideo-Controlnet和Wan2.1-Controlnet上分别实现2.16和2.05倍的加速，生成质量几乎无下降。

Conclusion: EVCtrl无需重新训练模型即可高效提升可控生成效率，适用于图像和视频生成。

Abstract: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training
probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful
content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling,
practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise
specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants
precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases
latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and
denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce
EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead
without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual
caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we
first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained
control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A
locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the
control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.
For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to
improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,
Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image
and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it
achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and
Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation
quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在无障碍领域的模拟能力，填补低视力人群视觉感知模拟的研究空白。

Method: 通过调查40名低视力参与者构建基准数据集，利用GPT-4o生成模拟代理，评估其与参与者原始回答的一致性。

Result: 仅提供视觉信息或示例图像响应时一致性较低（0.59），结合两者后显著提高（0.70）。单一组合示例优于单独使用，额外示例无显著提升。

Conclusion: 结合视觉信息和示例图像响应能有效提升VLMs模拟低视力人群视觉感知的准确性，但需注意避免过度推断。

Abstract: Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of
general human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving
capabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation
capabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent
to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when
interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey
study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed
vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and
recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct
prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant,
varying the included information on vision information and example image
responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and
participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer
beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in
low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants'
responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example
image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both
significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single
example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers
significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while
additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).

Motivation: 当前缺乏开放数据集来全面评估和优化VLMs在建筑安全检查中的应用，现有数据集规模小且监督性强，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 构建包含10,000张图像的数据集，标注了图像描述、安全违规视觉问答（VQA）和建筑元素视觉定位三个任务。

Result: 评估显示现有VLMs在零样本和少样本设置下表现良好，但仍需进一步训练以适应实际工地场景。

Conclusion: ConstructionSite 10k为研究者提供了训练和评估新VLMs的基准，推动了建筑安全检查技术的发展。

Abstract: Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector
identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language
Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting
safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open
datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction
safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets,
limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In
this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction
site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image
captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and
construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current
state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make
them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers
to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques,
providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.

Conclusion: 多模态LLMs在文档欺诈检测中具有潜力，需任务特定微调。

Abstract: Document fraud poses a significant threat to industries reliant on secure and
verifiable documentation, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study
investigates the efficacy of state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models
(LLMs)-including OpenAI O1, OpenAI 4o, Gemini Flash (thinking), Deepseek Janus,
Grok, Llama 3.2 and 4, Qwen 2 and 2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, and Claude 3.5 and
3.7 Sonnet-in detecting fraudulent documents. We benchmark these models against
each other and prior work on document fraud detection techniques using a
standard dataset with real transactional documents. Through prompt optimization
and detailed analysis of the models' reasoning processes, we evaluate their
ability to identify subtle indicators of fraud, such as tampered text,
misaligned formatting, and inconsistent transactional sums. Our results reveal
that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot
generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution
datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance.
Notably, model size and advanced reasoning capabilities show limited
correlation with detection accuracy, suggesting task-specific fine-tuning is
critical. This study underscores the potential of multi-modal LLMs in enhancing
document fraud detection systems and provides a foundation for future research
into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies.

Conclusion: MedSAMix通过自动优化融合策略，有效提升医学图像分割的性能和泛化能力，为临床应用提供了灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising
paradigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing
great potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has
been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various
fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned
variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data
that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional
shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range
of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a
training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both
generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical
image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that
rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we
propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal
layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we
develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and
generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and
multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical
segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias
and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and
generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37%
on multi-task evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D VL数据集缺乏多视角推理和丰富的上下文对齐，限制了模型对远距离对象的深度理解。

Method: 提出MV-ScanQA数据集（68%问题需多视角推理）和TripAlign预训练语料库（1M三元组），并开发LEGO方法，将2D LVLMs知识迁移至3D领域。

Result: LEGO在MV-ScanQA和现有3D密集描述与问答基准上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MV-ScanQA和TripAlign填补了3D VL数据集的空白，LEGO方法展示了多视角推理的潜力。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D vision-language (3D VL) learning is hindered by several
limitations in existing 3D VL datasets: they rarely necessitate reasoning
beyond a close range of objects in single viewpoint, and annotations often link
instructions to single objects, missing richer contextual alignments between
multiple objects. This significantly curtails the development of models capable
of deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address
these challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset
where 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple
views (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously
testing multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of
models for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a
large-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M <2D
view, set of 3D objects, text> triplets that explicitly aligns groups of
contextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded
multi-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object
annotations. We further develop LEGO, a baseline method for the multi-view
reasoning challenge in MV-ScanQA, transferring knowledge from pre-trained 2D
LVLMs to 3D domain with TripAlign. Empirically, LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the proposed MV-ScanQA, but
also on existing benchmarks for 3D dense captioning and question answering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BMI是2型糖尿病的已知风险因素，但瘦人和肥胖人群中糖尿病的存在与缺失表明，详细的身体成分分析可能揭示腹部表型。

Method: 通过AI对临床CT影像进行分割和随机森林分类，结合SHAP分析，识别不同BMI亚组（瘦、超重、肥胖）中的糖尿病相关腹部特征。

Result: 随机森林模型的AUC为0.72-0.74，发现脂肪肌肉、年龄、内脏和皮下脂肪、胰腺大小等是共同特征。

Conclusion: 腹部特征对2型糖尿病的影响在不同体重人群中可能一致。

Abstract: Purpose: Although elevated BMI is a well-known risk factor for type 2
diabetes, the disease's presence in some lean adults and absence in others with
obesity suggests that detailed body composition may uncover abdominal
phenotypes of type 2 diabetes. With AI, we can now extract detailed
measurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D
clinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define
body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using
large-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal
patterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full
cohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese
(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms
abdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through
segmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random
forest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection
through SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns
(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences
(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.
There were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal
muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or
fat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of
14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be
consistent across weight classes.

Result: 实验表明，HierOctFusion在形状质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierOctFusion通过分层生成和语义特征传播，显著提升了3D内容生成的效果。

Abstract: 3D content generation remains a fundamental yet challenging task due to the
inherent structural complexity of 3D data. While recent octree-based diffusion
models offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality through
hierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existing
methods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring their
semantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistic
high-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-world
objects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited for
layered generation. Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion,
a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchical
feature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures.
Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injects
part-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic features
to propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole.
Additionally, we construct a 3D dataset with part category annotations using a
pre-trained segmentation model to facilitate training and evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate that HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality and
efficiency compared to prior methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于残差的双向扩散模型（RBDM），实现雾图和去雾图之间的双向转换，通过双马尔可夫链和统一评分函数提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度去雾方法仅关注去雾，缺乏雾图和去雾图之间的双向转换能力。

Method: 设计双马尔可夫链实现残差平滑转换，通过扰动和噪声预测学习条件分布，引入统一评分函数降低计算成本。

Result: RBDM在15步采样内实现双向转换，性能优于或媲美现有方法。

Conclusion: RBDM成功解决了双向转换问题，并在小数据集上表现优异。

Abstract: Current deep dehazing methods only focus on removing haze from hazy images,
lacking the capability to translate between hazy and haze-free images. To
address this issue, we propose a residual-based efficient bidirectional
diffusion model (RBDM) that can model the conditional distributions for both
dehazing and haze generation. Firstly, we devise dual Markov chains that can
effectively shift the residuals and facilitate bidirectional smooth transitions
between them. Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at
individual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to
simultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance
performance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our
method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of
entire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional
transitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or
at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有谣言检测方法常忽略图像内容及多尺度上下文关系，导致关键信息丢失。

Method: 设计SCLIP编码器生成统一语义嵌入，引入跨模态多尺度对齐模块和尺度感知融合网络。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MICC方法有效且具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing rumor detection methods often neglect the content within images as
well as the inherent relationships between contexts and images across different
visual scales, thereby resulting in the loss of critical information pertinent
to rumor identification. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel
cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the
Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC).
Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic
embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive
pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product
similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is
introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics,
guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck
principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance
matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a
scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated
multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive
weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal
relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two
real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a
substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches
in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical
applications.

Conclusion: EM-B3DM通过半监督学习和创新模型设计，有效解决了真实世界去雾难题。

Abstract: Existing dehazing methods deal with real-world haze images with difficulty,
especially scenes with thick haze. One of the main reasons is the lack of
real-world paired data and robust priors. To avoid the costly collection of
paired hazy and clear images, we propose an efficient semi-supervised image
dehazing method via Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge
Diffusion Models (EM-B3DM) with a two-stage learning scheme. In the first
stage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired
hazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then
modeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the
structural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In
the second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired
hazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing.
Additionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution
block (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the
model's representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
EM-B3DM achieves superior or at least comparable performance to
state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 解决源自由目标检测（SFOD）中因伪标签噪声导致的训练崩溃问题，特别是在遥感图像中密集对象和复杂背景的挑战。

Result: VG-DETR在源自由遥感检测任务中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: VG-DETR通过VFM的语义先验和双级对齐策略，有效解决了SFOD中的伪标签噪声问题，提升了检测器的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge
domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and
transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which
limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection
(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain
adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training
paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse
caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense
objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain
annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision
foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised
framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision
Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner,
leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise
while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we
introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's
semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated
pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from
low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and
quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,
which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and
image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and
similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further
enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in
source-free remote sensing detection tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法在视觉内容评估中存在结果不精确和损失计算效率低的问题，限制了模型对关键指标的关注。

Method: 提出IOVQA，通过整数标签（范围[10,50]）和目标掩码策略（仅关注标签前两位数）优化模型训练。

Result: 实验表明，IOVQA显著提升模型在VQA任务中的准确性和一致性，在VQualA 2025挑战赛中排名第三。

Conclusion: 整数标签优化方法有效，为视觉语言模型在定量评估场景中的优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to
assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become
increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency
assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer
from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus
of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose
IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to
enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation
of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation
mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's
output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability,
and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also
introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first
two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the
critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the
Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's
accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025
GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work
highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during
fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative
evaluation scenarios.

Motivation: 连续类别发现（CCD）面临无标签数据中新类别的自动发现与灾难性遗忘的挑战，现有方法难以平衡新类发现与分类，且易累积错误。

Method: IDOD方法包含独立多样性模块（对比损失训练）、联合发现模块（单阶段新类发现）和正交性模块（正交原型生成与低存储重放）。

Result: 在细粒度数据集上，IDOD优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IDOD有效解决了CCD中的矛盾与错误累积问题，同时降低了存储需求。

Abstract: Continuous category discovery (CCD) aims to automatically discover novel
categories in continuously arriving unlabeled data. This is a challenging
problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the
newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery
and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the
process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use
knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more
storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based
Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes
independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module,
and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment,
the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing
only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage
novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact.
Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal
prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead
via representative representation replay. Experimental results show that on
challenging fine-grained datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 现有适配器方法在视觉和文本模态对齐时未能捕捉类别与图像样本的一对多关联，且难以处理未知类别。

Method: 引入可学习的属性提示作为桥梁，在双曲空间中投影类别、属性和图像，并通过层次正则化学习潜在语义层次。

Result: 在四个少样本任务上表现优于其他微调方法，尤其在已知类别适应和未知类别泛化方面。

Conclusion: LatHAdapter通过利用潜在语义层次结构，显著提升了少样本分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Adapter-based approaches have garnered attention for fine-tuning pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on few-shot classification tasks. These methods
strive to develop a lightweight module that better aligns visual and (category)
textual representations, thereby enhancing performance on downstream few-shot
learning tasks. However, existing adapters generally learn/align (category)
textual-visual modalities via explicit spatial proximity in the underlying
embedding space, which i) fails to capture the inherent one-to-many
associations between categories and image samples and ii) struggles to
establish accurate associations between the unknown categories and images. To
address these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we
develop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs
on downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to
exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it
to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process.
Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts
as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories,
attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and
employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of
them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among
categories, learnable attributes, and image samples. Extensive experiments on
four challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently
outperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known
classes and generalizing to unknown classes.

Result: GVT在视频重建、动作识别和压缩任务中表现优异，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GVT通过生成式2D高斯策略显著提升了视频标记化的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing
tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and
patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly
allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in
low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging
without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this
work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video
tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We
first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a
set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian
Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D
Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp.,
lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information
content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding
per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a
Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into
static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across
different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a
compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction,
while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression
using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality,
outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers
comparable compression performance.

Conclusion: CHARM3R通过优化深度估计，显著提升了单目3D检测器在相机高度变化下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera
height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing
methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data
augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by
first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art
(SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset
with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary
factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove
and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean
depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under
camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust
Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the
model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than
$45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at

Abstract: Many everyday tasks ranging from fixing appliances, cooking recipes to car

multi-step. Despite growing interest in AI agents, there is a scarcity of
dialogue-video datasets grounded for real world task assistance. In this paper,
we propose a simple yet effective approach that transforms single-person

effort required for human-assisted data collection. Using this technique, we
build HowToDIV, a large-scale dataset containing 507 conversations, 6636
question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in
cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation
where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while
observing user's surrounding through a camera and microphone equipped wearable

through Gemma-3 model for future research on this new task of dialogues for

Conclusion: UAV-VL-R1通过GRPO增强逻辑灵活性，适用于资源受限的无人机平台，解决了航拍图像推理的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong
generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often
degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features
high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints.
These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured
aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a
lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained
using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning
through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model
training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question
answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples
covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting,
transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results
show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which
is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT
improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical
tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical
flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires
only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with
INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了轻量化人体姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric
understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose
estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate
predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose
estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful
teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation.
However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully
explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we
propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for
human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human
joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so
as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the
student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided
Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human
pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of
the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model.
The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose

TL;DR: 提出轻量级不确定性模态建模（UMM）框架，解决多模态缺失问题，提升行人重识别在自动驾驶中的鲁棒性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中行人重识别面临多模态输入不确定或缺失的挑战，现有方法计算开销大，难以实用。

Method: 结合多模态令牌映射器、合成模态增强策略和跨模态线索交互学习器，利用CLIP的视觉-语言对齐能力。

Result: UMM在不确定模态条件下表现出强鲁棒性、泛化能力和计算效率。

Conclusion: UMM为自动驾驶场景中的行人重识别提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception
systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must
identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe
navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or
missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual
descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches.
While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling
capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in
resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a
multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and
cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified
feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract
complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM
leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs
efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency
under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution
for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出Talking-Critic多模态奖励模型和TLPO框架，解决音频驱动肖像动画中多维度偏好对齐问题，并引入大规模数据集Talking-NSQ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在多维度（如动作自然性、唇同步准确性和视觉质量）上对齐人类偏好，且缺乏高质量标注数据集。

Method: 1. 提出Talking-Critic奖励模型学习人类对齐的奖励函数；2. 构建Talking-NSQ数据集；3. 设计TLPO框架，通过专家模块分步优化多维度偏好。

Result: Talking-Critic在人类偏好评分上显著优于现有方法；TLPO在唇同步、动作自然性和视觉质量上均大幅提升。

Conclusion: Talking-Critic和TLPO有效解决了多维度偏好对齐问题，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with
fine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion
naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the
difficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often
conflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
datasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we
first introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns
human-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy
multidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a
large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K
preference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert
Preference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based
portrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO
decouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused
across timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained
enhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments
demonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in
aligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial
improvements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and
visual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations. Ours project page:

Conclusion: DeCLIP为开放词汇密集感知任务提供了坚实基础，显著提升了局部判别性和空间一致性。

Abstract: Dense visual perception tasks have been constrained by their reliance on
predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios
where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like
CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to
dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in
local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that
CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from
spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack
local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we
propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the
self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features
respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling
semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity
cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel,
the content features are aligned with image crop representations and
constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation
for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and
segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D
object pose estimation.} Code is available at

Motivation: 虽然VLM在检索和零样本迁移中表现优异，但其对齐可能隐含社会刻板印象，标准准确性指标难以察觉。本研究旨在揭示这种潜在的性别关联。

Method: 收集220张按感知性别分类的面部照片和150条描述职业与活动的语句，计算图像和文本嵌入的余弦相似度，定义性别关联分数，并通过置信区间和标签交换模型验证。

Result: 研究提供了视觉语言空间中性别关联的详细映射，揭示了模型在职业描述中的性别偏见，并提出了稳健的评估框架。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型可能隐含性别偏见，需通过专门设计的评估框架加以识别和纠正。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) align images and text in a shared representation
space that is useful for retrieval and zero-shot transfer. Yet, this alignment
can encode and amplify social stereotypes in subtle ways that are not obvious
from standard accuracy metrics. In this study, we test whether the contrastive
vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places
embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe
occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split
by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed
across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic
labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute
unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for
every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the
difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean
cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger
association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association
with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling
images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate
bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the
level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were
present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender
associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by
uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation
framework.

Result: 实验证明该方法在域泛化点云分割任务中具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过关注几何不变信息，显著提升了3D语义分割的泛化性能。

Abstract: Domain generalization in 3D segmentation is a critical challenge in deploying
models to unseen environments. Current methods mitigate the domain shift by
augmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns
global geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level
distribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning
framework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for
domain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level
Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric
properties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties
of each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly,
Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D
distribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the
model to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve
generalization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the
state-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在组合图像检索中需要额外训练排序模型，且Chain-of-Thought（CoT）技术在该任务中应用有限。

Result: 在CIR基准测试中，PMTFR优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PMTFR框架在监督式CIR任务中表现出色，代码将公开。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it
requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual
instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to
use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this
often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language
models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual
information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing
works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve
satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work,
we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with
Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple
but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching
Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities.
Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT
data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain
refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without
relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive
experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.

Result: SAEs提取的特征具有语义意义，提升泛化能力，并支持可控生成；在扩散模型中实现语义操控，多模态LLMs中揭示跨模态共享表示。

Conclusion: SAEs在视觉模型中具有潜力，可提升可解释性、泛化能力和可控性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting
the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct
activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable
features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite
their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual
domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational
power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our
experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful,
improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation
across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal
LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE
features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover
the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we
demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder
manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering
human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on
multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared
representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a
foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong
potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the
visual domain.

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模块协同，显著提升了单目内窥镜组织重建的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction
significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by
enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular
endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,
including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent
endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To
overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue
reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with
temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework
incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust
initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in
conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth
estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel
correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on
LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from
physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of
the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module
is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated
signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied
to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED,
with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness
and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: With the advancement of generative models, facial image editing has made
significant progress. However, achieving fine-grained age editing while
preserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we
propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate
age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained
age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross
attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related
features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age
attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial
aging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that
predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising
image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to
incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by
modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of
large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset
(High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million
high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes.
Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art
performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.

Abstract: Pedestrian segmentation in automotive perception systems faces critical
safety challenges due to metamerism in RGB imaging, where pedestrians and
backgrounds appear visually indistinguishable.. This study investigates the
potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for enhanced pedestrian segmentation
in urban driving scenarios using the Hyperspectral City v2 (H-City) dataset. We
compared standard RGB against two dimensionality-reduction approaches by
converting 128-channel HSI data into three-channel representations: Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and optimal band selection using Contrast
Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Joint Mutual Information Maximization (CSNR-JMIM).
Three semantic segmentation models were evaluated: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and
SegFormer. CSNR-JMIM consistently outperformed RGB with an average improvements
of 1.44% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 2.18% in F1-score for pedestrian
segmentation. Rider segmentation showed similar gains with 1.43% IoU and 2.25%
F1-score improvements. These improved performance results from enhanced
spectral discrimination of optimally selected HSI bands effectively reducing
false positives. This study demonstrates robust pedestrian segmentation through
optimal HSI band selection, showing significant potential for safety-critical
automotive applications.

Abstract: Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video
clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering
optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that
explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the
target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this
paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising
Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF)
modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to
dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal
video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from
purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving
as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform
conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations
for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that
our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore,
our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly
integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.

Result: LogicCLIP在逻辑理解任务中显著优于基线模型，且不影响通用视觉语言任务性能。

Conclusion: LogicBench和LogicCLIP为提升VLM逻辑能力提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as
foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical
understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical
''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications.
To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive
benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories
and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical
diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the
state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance,
particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality,
highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical
structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training
framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in
both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes
logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines
coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel
logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate
LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all
LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP
retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general
vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical
understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe
that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM
logical capabilities.

Conclusion: DSC-Track通过关注稳定的空间模式，显著提升了3D多目标跟踪的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of
autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object
motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in
simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with
inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between
objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing
geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant
objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address
this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable
spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency
Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified
spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative
trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our
cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature
representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a
dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for
stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open
Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the
nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets,

Abstract: Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g.,
CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image
classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious
bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful
generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable
image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by
randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising
effects with different category conditions to classify categories.
Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise
instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance
changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always
ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces
the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in
DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the
instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two
principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,
we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)
noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a
dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly
initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a
Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise
offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to
replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the
effectiveness of NoOp.

TL;DR: GANDiff FR是一种合成框架，通过精确控制人口统计和环境因素来测量、解释和减少偏见，结合了StyleGAN3和扩散模型，生成多样化的人脸数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决人脸识别系统中的偏见问题，通过可控的合成数据来量化并减少偏见。

Method: 结合StyleGAN3的身份保留生成和扩散模型的属性控制，生成10,000张平衡的人脸数据，并在ArcFace、CosFace和AdaFace等模型上测试偏见。

Result: AdaFace减少了60%的组间TPR差异，光照因素占剩余偏见的42%。合成数据在跨数据集评估中表现良好（r=0.85）。

Conclusion: GANDiff FR为公平性审计提供了可重复的标准，尽管计算开销较高，但能生成更多属性变体，支持透明的偏见评估。

Abstract: We introduce GANDiff FR, the first synthetic framework that precisely
controls demographic and environmental factors to measure, explain, and reduce
bias with reproducible rigor. GANDiff FR unifies StyleGAN3-based
identity-preserving generation with diffusion-based attribute control, enabling
fine-grained manipulation of pose around 30 degrees, illumination (four
directions), and expression (five levels) under ceteris paribus conditions. We
synthesize 10,000 demographically balanced faces across five cohorts validated
for realism via automated detection (98.2%) and human review (89%) to isolate
and quantify bias drivers. Benchmarking ArcFace, CosFace, and AdaFace under
matched operating points shows AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60%
(2.5% vs. 6.3%), with illumination accounting for 42% of residual bias.
Cross-dataset evaluation on RFW, BUPT, and CASIA WebFace confirms strong
synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85). Despite around 20% computational overhead
relative to pure GANs, GANDiff FR yields three times more attribute-conditioned
variants, establishing a reproducible, regulation-aligned (EU AI Act) standard
for fairness auditing. Code and data are released to support transparent,
scalable bias evaluation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IAQD的新蒸馏方法，用于解决基于Transformer的增量目标检测中的知识遗忘问题，通过索引对齐的查询蒸馏，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在基于Transformer的增量目标检测中，传统的知识蒸馏方法（如匈牙利匹配）可能导致知识遗忘，因此需要一种更有效的方法来保持旧类别的检测性能。

Method: 提出Index-Aligned Query Distillation (IAQD)，通过索引对齐的方式建立查询对应关系，并仅对关键查询进行蒸馏，避免干扰新类别的学习。

Result: 在代表性基准测试中，IAQD有效缓解了知识遗忘问题，并达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: IAQD是一种高效的蒸馏方法，能够在增量目标检测中显著减少知识遗忘，同时不影响新类别的学习。

Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability
of a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on
previously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to
perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning
the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely
degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)
to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based
detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a
correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase
detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched
queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,
Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of
the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at
different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each
query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of
previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we
propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation
(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD
establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase
models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned
distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of
previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic
and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new
categories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that
IAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有宫颈细胞自动分类方法需要大量代表性训练数据，人工标注成本高昂。

Method: 利用分类器对未标注宫颈细胞图像的不确定性，选择最有价值的图像进行标注。

Result: 新算法显著提升了训练数据集的代表性，同时大幅降低了人工成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效宫颈细胞分类提供了可行路径，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Information on the number and category of cervical cells is crucial for the
diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, existing classification methods capable
of automatically measuring this information require the training dataset to be
representative, which consumes an expensive or even unaffordable human cost. We
herein propose active labeling that enables us to construct a representative
training dataset using a much smaller human cost for data-efficient cervical
cell classification. This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the
classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately
select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the
uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in
enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The
extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage
of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell
classification.

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target
label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This
target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model
to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model
predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability,
reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided
framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge
transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity
sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect
to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our
experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these
models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static
lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class
relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a
preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a
priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models
for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial
benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过奖励引导解码的方法，用于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉接地任务，实现了对模型输出的动态控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MLLMs的广泛应用，如何根据用户需求动态调整模型行为变得尤为重要。本文旨在通过控制解码过程，提升模型的视觉接地能力。

Method: 构建了两个独立的奖励模型，分别控制对象精度和召回率，并通过动态调整奖励函数的权重和解码搜索范围，实现对MLLM推理过程的实时控制。

Result: 在标准对象幻觉基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有幻觉缓解方法，并提供了高度的可控性。

Conclusion: 该方法为MLLMs的视觉接地任务提供了一种灵活且高效的控制手段，同时提升了性能。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it
is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In
this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To
achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs
and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method
involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide
the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to
independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's
output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference
process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of
each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off
object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving
control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to
control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of
visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination
benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM
inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation
methods.

Result: 在HOI检测基准测试中达到最优性能，并在开放世界泛化中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOID-R1通过多模态对齐和推理监督，显著提升了HOI检测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing human-object interaction (HOI) is a pivotal
application in AR/VR and robotics. Recent open-vocabulary HOI detection
approaches depend exclusively on large language models for richer textual
prompts, neglecting their inherent 3D spatial understanding capabilities. To
address this shortcoming, we introduce HOID-R1, the first HOI detection
framework that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) guided supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement
learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we initially apply SFT to imbue the model
with essential reasoning capabilities, forcing the model to articulate its
thought process in the output. Subsequently, we integrate GRPO to leverage
multi-reward signals for policy optimization, thereby enhancing alignment
across diverse modalities. To mitigate hallucinations in the CoT reasoning, we
introduce an "MLLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that supervises the CoT outputs,
further improving generalization. Extensive experiments show that HOID-R1
achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks and
outperforms existing methods in open-world generalization to novel scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RETFound在视盘分割任务中的潜力，验证基础模型在特定任务中的适用性。

Method: 通过微调RETFound的头部网络，使用少量任务样本进行训练，并在多个公开和私有数据集上测试。

Result: 在所有数据集中Dice分数均达到约96%，表现优于现有分割网络。

Conclusion: RETFound在视盘分割任务中表现出色，支持基础模型作为任务特定架构的替代方案。

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera
and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance
across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and
systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been
used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic
disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image
analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art,
segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very
modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with
four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private
dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets.
Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification,
domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the
state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of
the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割是计算机视觉中的重要任务，而针对管状结构的分割需要特殊模型和损失函数。SRL声称在管状数据集上表现优异，但本文旨在验证其实际效果。

Method: 通过理论分析SRL的梯度，并在多个管状数据集上与传统基线模型进行性能对比。

Result: 实证表明，SRL在管状结构分割任务中并未显著优于传统模型。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了基于拓扑的损失函数的局限性，为未来开发更有效的分割模型提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Image segmentation is an important and widely performed task in computer
vision. Accomplishing effective image segmentation in diverse settings often
requires custom model architectures and loss functions. A set of models that
specialize in segmenting thin tubular structures are topology
preservation-based loss functions. These models often utilize a pixel
skeletonization process claimed to generate more precise segmentation masks of
thin tubes and better capture the structures that other models often miss. One
such model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\cite
{kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark
tubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the
gradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed
method on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with
some additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based
segmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models. By providing
both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence, this work critically
evaluates the limitations of topology-based loss functions, offering valuable
insights for researchers aiming to develop more effective segmentation models
for complex tubular structures.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法在捕捉细粒度实例级细节和复杂关系结构方面表现不佳，导致性能不理想。

Method: 提出两种新损失函数：实例级嵌入蒸馏（动态硬挖掘策略）和关系相似性蒸馏（记忆库机制和样本挖掘策略）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上优于现有蒸馏方法，学生模型甚至能超越教师模型。

Conclusion: 该统一框架实现了更全面的知识蒸馏，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for
deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices.
Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature
Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level
details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance.
We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions,
Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity
Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning
individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy,
thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise
Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise
similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining
strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level
alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading
to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face
recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations.
Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our
unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

Conclusion: G-CUT3R能有效利用先验信息，灵活适应多种输入组合。

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene
reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information.
Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our
method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera
positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight
modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to
extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution.
This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior
information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including
3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates
significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively
utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input
modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大气湍流导致视频质量下降，现有方法计算成本高且难以实时部署。

Method: 采用轻量级循环框架，仅需两帧输入，结合多尺度特征编码和解码模块。

Result: 在SSIM指标上提升9%，推理速度提高四倍。

Conclusion: RMFAT适用于实时大气湍流抑制任务，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing
distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing
significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current
state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and
require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage
limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In
this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric
Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video
restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework
that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly
reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates
multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both
encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence
datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms
of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also
achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction
in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric
turbulence suppression tasks.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have become the go-to method for biomedical instance
segmentation. Generalist models like Cellpose demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance across diverse cellular data, though their effectiveness often
degrades on domains that differ from their training data. While supervised
fine-tuning can address this limitation, it requires annotated data that may
not be readily available. We propose SelfAdapt, a method that enables the
adaptation of pre-trained cell segmentation models without the need for labels.
Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training,
introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate
our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative
improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we
show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were
previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use

Motivation: 生物特征识别广泛使用，但模板的隐私和安全性是关键问题。多模态融合可提升安全性，但现有方法计算量大，尤其在同态加密下。

Method: 利用深度神经网络提取多模态特征（人脸、指纹、虹膜），通过降维减少同态加密的计算负担，实验基于虚拟多生物特征数据库。

Conclusion: 降维多模态融合方法在保持安全性和准确性的同时，显著提升了同态加密下的计算效率。

Abstract: Biometric recognition is widely used, making the privacy and security of
extracted templates a critical concern. Biometric Template Protection schemes,
especially those utilizing Homomorphic Encryption, introduce significant
computational challenges due to increased workload. Recent advances in deep
neural networks have enabled state-of-the-art feature extraction for face,
fingerprint, and iris modalities. The ubiquity and affordability of biometric
sensors further facilitate multi-modal fusion, which can enhance security by
combining features from different modalities. This work investigates the
biometric performance of reduced multi-biometric template sizes. Experiments
are conducted on an in-house virtual multi-biometric database, derived from
DNN-extracted features for face, fingerprint, and iris, using the FRGC, MCYT,
and CASIA databases. The evaluated approaches are (i) explainable and
straightforward to implement under encryption, (ii) training-free, and (iii)
capable of generalization. Dimensionality reduction of feature vectors leads to
fewer operations in the Homomorphic Encryption (HE) domain, enabling more
efficient encrypted processing while maintaining biometric accuracy and
security at a level equivalent to or exceeding single-biometric recognition.
Our results demonstrate that, by fusing feature vectors from multiple
modalities, template size can be reduced by 67 % with no loss in Equal Error
Rate (EER) compared to the best-performing single modality.

Conclusion: ImagiDrive通过整合VLM和DWM，显著提升了自动驾驶的预测和规划能力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise
predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have
independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this
challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through
their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating
detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive
planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet
understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate
behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this
integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting
action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a
novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based
driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified
imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving
trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to
generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are
subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning
decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in
this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory
selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over
previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.

object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets
have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more
complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object
removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images
of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly
eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was
removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal
techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of
handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at
github.com/spatial-intelligence-ai/Remove360.git. Data are available at

*Qian Liang,Yujia Wu,Kuncheng Li,Jiwei Wei,Shiyuan He,Jinyu Guo,Ning Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MM-R1框架通过跨模态思维链（X-CoT）策略，解锁统一多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的个性化图像生成潜力，无需针对每个新主题进行数据密集型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs方法通常针对特定主题，需大量数据微调，限制了可扩展性。MM-R1旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MM-R1将个性化建模为视觉推理与生成过程，结合用户提供的图像、上下文线索和提示生成个性化图像，并采用GRPO优化生成对齐。

Result: 实验表明，MM-R1能以零样本方式生成高主题保真度和强文本对齐的图像。

Conclusion: MM-R1展示了统一MLLMs在个性化图像生成中的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with unified architectures excel
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet aligning them with
personalized image generation remains a significant challenge. Existing methods
for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive
fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In
this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal
Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of
unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure
personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1)
grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided
images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned
on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further
enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate
that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to
generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a
zero-shot manner.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉输入的深度学习室内导航方法，无需GPS、特殊传感器或地图，通过图像预测目标方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内导航因GPS信号差而困难，现有解决方案复杂且难以部署，需依赖额外信息源。

Method: 采用图基路径生成方法，结合可解释数据增强和课程学习，实现高效、自动化的数据收集与训练。

Result: 创建了一个大型购物中心视频数据集，并开发了Android应用，仅依赖视觉输入即可导航。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、实时且易部署，解决了现有方案的复杂性和依赖性问题。

Abstract: Indoor navigation is a difficult task, as it generally comes with poor GPS
access, forcing solutions to rely on other sources of information. While
significant progress continues to be made in this area, deployment to
production applications is still lacking, given the complexity and additional
requirements of current solutions. Here, we introduce an efficient, real-time
and easily deployable deep learning approach, based on visual input only, that
can predict the direction towards a target from images captured by a mobile
device. Our technical approach, based on a novel graph-based path generation
method, combined with explainable data augmentation and curriculum learning,
includes contributions that make the process of data collection, annotation and
training, as automatic as possible, efficient and robust. On the practical
side, we introduce a novel largescale dataset, with video footage inside a
relatively large shopping mall, in which each frame is annotated with the
correct next direction towards different specific target destinations.
Different from current methods, ours relies solely on vision, avoiding the need
of special sensors, additional markers placed along the path, knowledge of the
scene map or internet access. We also created an easy to use application for
Android, which we plan to make publicly available. We make all our data and
code available along with visual demos on our project site

TL;DR: CoFi是一种用于电子显微镜图像中肾小球基底膜分割的粗到细少样本学习管道，通过轻量级网络和形态学修剪生成高质量点提示，显著减少标注负担并实现高效分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督深度学习方法依赖大量像素级标注，不适用于临床工作流程；少样本学习虽减少标注负担，但难以捕捉肾小球基底膜的精细结构。

Method: CoFi首先用三张标注图像训练轻量级网络生成粗分割掩码，再通过形态学修剪生成高质量点提示，引导SAM模型细化分割。

Result: Dice系数达74.54%，推理速度1.9 FPS，显著减轻标注和计算负担。

Conclusion: CoFi在肾病理学中具有临床应用潜力，其高效性和准确性使其适合研究和临床使用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in electron
microscopy (EM) images is fundamental for quantifying membrane thickness and
supporting the diagnosis of various kidney diseases. While supervised deep
learning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on
extensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical
workflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often
struggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In
this study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot
segmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first
trains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to
produce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically
processed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,
which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The
proposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice
coefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that
CoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated
with conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation
results. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for
research and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal
pathology. The pipeline is publicly available at:

Abstract: Abnormal Human Behavior Detection (AHBD) under special scenarios is becoming
increasingly crucial. While YOLO-based detection methods excel in real-time
tasks, they remain hindered by challenges including small objects, task
conflicts, and multi-scale fusion in AHBD. To tackle them, we propose
TACR-YOLO, a new real-time framework for AHBD. We introduce a Coordinate
Attention Module to enhance small object detection, a Task-Aware Attention
Module to deal with classification-regression conflicts, and a Strengthen Neck
Network for refined multi-scale fusion, respectively. In addition, we optimize
Anchor Box sizes using K-means clustering and deploy DIoU-Loss to improve
bounding box regression. The Personnel Anomalous Behavior Detection (PABD)
dataset, which includes 8,529 samples across four behavior categories, is also
presented. Extensive experimental results indicate that TACR-YOLO achieves
91.92% mAP on PABD, with competitive speed and robustness. Ablation studies
highlight the contribution of each improvement. This work provides new insights
for abnormal behavior detection under special scenarios, advancing its
progress.

Abstract: The construction industry increasingly relies on visual data to support
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications for site
monitoring. High-quality, domain-specific datasets, comprising images, videos,
and point clouds, capture site geometry and spatiotemporal dynamics, including
the location and interaction of objects, workers, and materials. However,
despite growing interest in leveraging visual datasets, existing resources vary
widely in sizes, data modalities, annotation quality, and representativeness of
real-world construction conditions. A systematic review to categorize their
data characteristics and application contexts is still lacking, limiting the
community's ability to fully understand the dataset landscape, identify
critical gaps, and guide future directions toward more effective, reliable, and
scalable AI applications in construction. To address this gap, this study
conducts an extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms,
yielding 51 publicly available visual datasets that span the 2005-2024 period.
These datasets are categorized using a structured data schema covering (i) data
fundamentals (e.g., size and license), (ii) data modalities (e.g., RGB and
point cloud), (iii) annotation frameworks (e.g., bounding boxes), and (iv)
downstream application domains (e.g., progress tracking). This study
synthesizes these findings into an open-source catalog, OpenConstruction,
supporting data-driven method development. Furthermore, the study discusses
several critical limitations in the existing construction dataset landscape and
presents a roadmap for future data infrastructure anchored in the Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. By
reviewing the current landscape and outlining strategic priorities, this study
supports the advancement of data-centric solutions in the construction sector.

TL;DR: CineTrans是一个新框架，用于生成具有电影风格过渡的多镜头视频，通过注意力映射和掩码控制机制实现稳定的过渡效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视频合成技术取得进展，但多镜头视频生成的研究仍处于初级阶段，现有方法在镜头过渡上表现不稳定且有限。

Method: 构建Cine250K数据集，分析视频扩散模型的注意力映射与镜头边界的关系，设计掩码控制机制，并在训练中微调。

Result: CineTrans能生成连贯的多镜头视频，避免不稳定过渡或简单拼接，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: CineTrans通过创新的控制机制和数据集，在多镜头视频生成中实现了高质量的过渡和一致性。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video synthesis, research into multi-shot
video generation remains in its infancy. Even with scaled-up models and massive
datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable,
largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we
introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot
videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the
film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with
detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video
diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the
diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based
control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers
effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with
the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while
adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive
concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for
transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate
through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing
baselines across all criteria.

Abstract: Detailed data is required to quantify energy conservation measures in
buildings, such as envelop retrofits, without compromising cultural heritage.
Novel artificial intelligence tools may improve efficiency in identifying
heritage values in buildings compared to costly and time-consuming traditional
inventories. In this study, the large language model GPT was used to detect
various aspects of cultural heritage value in fa\c{c}ade images. Using this
data and building register data as features, machine learning models were
trained to classify multi-family and non-residential buildings in Stockholm,
Sweden. Validation against an expert-created inventory shows a macro F1-score
of 0.71 using a combination of register data and features retrieved from GPT,
and a score of 0.60 using only GPT-derived data. The presented methodology can
contribute to a higher-quality database and thus support careful energy
efficiency measures and integrated consideration of heritage value in
large-scale energetic refurbishment scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法采用感知-规划分离的范式，感知与规划顺序执行，限制了规划性能的优化潜力。

Method: 提出VeteranAD框架，结合多模态锚定轨迹作为规划先验，感知模块沿轨迹收集交通元素，采用自回归策略逐步预测未来轨迹并聚焦相关区域。

Result: 在NAVSIM和Bench2Drive数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: VeteranAD通过感知与规划的紧密耦合，释放了端到端方法的潜力，实现了更准确可靠的驾驶行为。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable advancements in recent
years. Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, where
perception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiable
framework for planning-oriented optimization. We further advance this paradigm
through a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into
the planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by
evolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning
performance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled
perception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By
incorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the
perception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along
these trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning
trajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the
planning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an
autoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while
focusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With this
simple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential of
planning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliable
driving behavior. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasets
demonstrate that our VeteranAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CNN在视觉任务中表现优异，但其依赖规则网格结构的特性限制了其对复杂拓扑关系和非局部语义的建模能力。

Method: HGFE构建了两种互补的图结构：局部空间依赖的窗口内图卷积和全局语义关系的窗口间超节点交互，并引入自适应频率调制模块平衡信号传播。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR-100、PASCAL VOC、VisDrone、CrackSeg、CarParts）上的实验验证了HGFE在结构表示和识别性能上的有效性。

Conclusion: HGFE是一种轻量级、端到端可训练的模块，可无缝集成到标准CNN中，显著提升了视觉任务的性能。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
  demonstrated strong performance in visual recognition tasks,
  but their inherent reliance on regular grid structures limits
  their capacity to model complex topological relationships and
  non-local semantics within images. To address this limita tion, we propose
the hierarchical graph feature enhancement
  (HGFE), a novel framework that integrates graph-based rea soning into CNNs to
enhance both structural awareness and
  feature representation. HGFE builds two complementary levels
  of graph structures: intra-window graph convolution to cap ture local spatial
dependencies and inter-window supernode
  interactions to model global semantic relationships. Moreover,
  we introduce an adaptive frequency modulation module that
  dynamically balances low-frequency and high-frequency signal
  propagation, preserving critical edge and texture information
  while mitigating over-smoothing. The proposed HGFE module
  is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be seamlessly
  integrated into standard CNN backbone networks. Extensive
  experiments on CIFAR-100 (classification), PASCAL VOC,
  and VisDrone (detection), as well as CrackSeg and CarParts
  (segmentation), validated the effectiveness of the HGFE in
  improving structural representation and enhancing overall
  recognition performance.

Conclusion: 领域特定的数据增强和集成策略显著提升了历史手稿的HTR性能。

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the
cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often
hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse
handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art
transformer-based HTR model, to 16th-century Latin manuscripts authored by
Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite
of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods
designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also
evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths
of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model
augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a
top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative
improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over
the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of
domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR
performance for historical manuscripts.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，AIM显著提升EPG分数和准确率，表明其能有效利用真实特征。

Conclusion: AIM通过自监督掩码，显著提升模型性能和可解释性，适用于多种任务和架构。

Abstract: It has been observed that deep neural networks (DNNs) often use both genuine
as well as spurious features. In this work, we propose "Amending Inherent
Interpretability via Self-Supervised Masking" (AIM), a simple yet interestingly
effective method that promotes the network's utilization of genuine features
over spurious alternatives without requiring additional annotations. In
particular, AIM uses features at multiple encoding stages to guide a
self-supervised, sample-specific feature-masking process. As a result, AIM
enables the training of well-performing and inherently interpretable models
that faithfully summarize the decision process. We validate AIM across a
diverse range of challenging datasets that test both out-of-distribution
generalization and fine-grained visual understanding. These include
general-purpose classification benchmarks such as ImageNet100, HardImageNet,
and ImageWoof, as well as fine-grained classification datasets such as
Waterbirds, TravelingBirds, and CUB-200. AIM demonstrates significant dual
benefits: interpretability improvements, as measured by the Energy Pointing
Game (EPG) score, and accuracy gains over strong baselines. These consistent
gains across domains and architectures provide compelling evidence that AIM
promotes the use of genuine and meaningful features that directly contribute to
improved generalization and human-aligned interpretability.

Abstract: Accelerated aging of transportation infrastructure in the rapidly developing
Yangtze River Delta region necessitates efficient concrete crack detection, as
crack deterioration critically compromises structural integrity and regional
economic growth. To overcome the limitations of inefficient manual inspection
and the suboptimal performance of existing deep learning models, particularly
for small-target crack detection within complex backgrounds, this paper
proposes YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, a multi-task concrete crack detection and
segmentation model based on the YOLOv11n architecture. The proposed model
integrates a three-stage optimization framework: (1) Embedding dynamic
KernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) within the backbone network to enhance
feature representation through a dynamic kernel sharing mechanism; (2)
Incorporating a triple attention mechanism (TA) into the feature pyramid to
strengthen channel-spatial interaction modeling; and (3) Designing an FP-IoU
loss function to facilitate adaptive bounding box regression penalization.
Experimental validation demonstrates that the enhanced model achieves
significant performance improvements over the baseline, attaining 91.3%
precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50. Ablation studies confirm the
synergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness tests
indicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noise
interference. This research delivers an efficient computer vision solution for
automated infrastructure inspection, exhibiting substantial practical
engineering value.

Method: MST结合多状态生成（MSG）、状态特定增强（SSE）和跨状态交互（CSI）模块，通过轻量级设计增强特征表示。

Result: MST在多个数据集上表现优于现有高效跟踪器，显著提升了跟踪精度和鲁棒性，计算开销仅为0.1 GFLOPs和0.66 M参数。

Conclusion: MST通过轻量级设计解决了高效跟踪器的特征表示不足问题，实现了高性能和低计算开销的平衡。

Abstract: Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational
complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the
expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their
ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To
overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes
highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized
enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG)
and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state
interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while
incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking
robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple
state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE
refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates
information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of
complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a
highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD)
design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient
trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy
and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an
AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on
the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.

Result: 在CPU条件下（8线程），10个训练周期内测试集分类准确率达89.10%，损失值稳定收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限环境下的医学图像分类提供了高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image
classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains
challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on
an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and
loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction
capability and classification performance while reducing computational
complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global
Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the
ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features
and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module,
termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the
adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead.
Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function
to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance.
Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum
classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs,
exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image
classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible
and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging
analysis models.

TL;DR: Veason-R1是一种专用于视频推理分割的LVLM，通过GRPO和CoT初始化训练，显著提升了时空推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时缺乏可解释性且性能不佳，需改进时空推理能力。

Method: 使用GRPO和CoT初始化训练Veason-R1，结合高质量CoT数据优化推理链。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最佳，显著超越现有方法（如ReVOS和ReasonVOS）。

Conclusion: Veason-R1通过结构化推理提升了分割性能，具有鲁棒性和高效性。

Abstract: Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in
videos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent and
temporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models
(LVLMs) to encode object semantics into <SEG> tokens for mask prediction.
However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference
and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing
inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce
Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in
segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we
curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning
trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding,
yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO
fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by
optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward
mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal
consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.
Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by
significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS),
while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model
weights will be available at Veason-R1.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Stable Diffusion的无训练异常生成框架AAG，通过改进交叉注意力和自注意力机制，生成逼真的异常图像，提升下游异常检测任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中数据稀缺问题突出，现有异常生成方法缺乏逼真性或需额外训练数据。

Method: AAG框架利用Stable Diffusion，结合Cross-Attention Enhancement（CAE）和Self-Attention Enhancement（SAE），通过文本提示和掩码生成特定区域的异常图像。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA数据集上验证了AAG的有效性，生成的异常图像提升了多种下游异常检测任务的性能。

Conclusion: AAG为工业异常检测提供了一种高效、逼真的异常生成方法，无需额外训练数据。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing
where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have
emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,
these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be
trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly
generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s
strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a
normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and
natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in
other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement
(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion
based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in
specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual
tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies
need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose
Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal
visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies
are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its
utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance
of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体育分析中存在数据不可用、缺乏有效轨迹框架和标签不足的问题，需要一种新的方法来解决这些问题。

Method: TrajSV包括数据预处理、Clip Representation Network (CRNet)和Video Representation Network (VRNet)，利用轨迹增强的Transformer模块和无监督的三重对比损失优化表示。

Result: 在足球、篮球和排球的视频检索、动作识别和视频字幕任务中，TrajSV表现优异，检索性能提升近70%，动作识别在17类中9类领先，字幕性能提升近20%。

Conclusion: TrajSV通过轨迹框架和无监督学习解决了体育分析中的关键问题，并在多个任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and
industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this
field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)
lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for
sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a
trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.
TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation
Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data
preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports
broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to
learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet
learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual
features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive
loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an
unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video
datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,
soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,
sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results
demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video
retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in
action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action
categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.
Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications
based on TrajSV.

*Yumeng Shi,Quanyu Long,Yin Wu,Wenya Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，视频语言模型（VideoLMs）中，去除或修改位置编码（PEs）对时间理解性能影响较小，而反转帧序列会导致性能显著下降。通过分析，揭示了时间信息通过帧间注意力逐步合成并最终整合到查询令牌中的因果路径。基于此，提出了两种效率优化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频语言模型在多模态理解方面取得进展，但时间理解（如事件顺序、持续时间和跨时间关系）仍是核心挑战。研究旨在探索时间信息在模型中的整合机制。

Method: 通过实验分析时间信息的整合路径，发现时间推理源于帧间注意力下的视觉令牌交互。基于此，提出了分阶段跨模态注意力和时间退出机制。

Result: 实验验证了两种策略的有效性，揭示了时间信息整合的因果路径，表明时间推理依赖于帧间注意力。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统研究了视频语言模型中的时间理解机制，为未来模型改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video language models (VideoLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
understanding. However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying
event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core
challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism
for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or
modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of
temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while
preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this
behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal
information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information
pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame
attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the
query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges
from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,
which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we
propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a
temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal
understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统遥感方法（如LiDAR）成本高且不实时，需要一种快速、低成本且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 结合单目深度估计、深度误差校正和几何三角测量，从车载摄像头视频流中提取空间和结构数据。

Conclusion: 该框架为城市植被和基础设施监测提供了实时、低成本的解决方案，适用于公用事业公司和城市规划者。

Abstract: Our study introduces a novel, low-cost, and reproducible framework for
real-time, object-level structural assessment and geolocation of roadside
vegetation and infrastructure with commonly available but underutilized
dashboard camera (dashcam) video data. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that
combines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometric
triangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data from
street-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were first
estimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a
gradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly
for distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive
performance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly
reducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using
GPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole
camera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera
placement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the
highest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute
error (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to combine monocular depth
modeling, triangulated GPS-based geolocation, and real-time structural
assessment for urban vegetation and infrastructure using consumer-grade video
data. Our approach complements conventional RS methods, such as LiDAR and image
by offering a fast, real-time, and cost-effective solution for object-level
monitoring of vegetation risks and infrastructure exposure, making it
especially valuable for utility companies, and urban planners aiming for
scalable and frequent assessments in dynamic urban environments.

TL;DR: CoreEditor提出了一种新的文本驱动3D编辑框架，通过对应约束注意力机制和语义相似性建模，解决了多视图一致性问题，并提供了选择性编辑功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本驱动3D编辑中难以保持多视图一致性，导致编辑效果模糊且不充分。

Method: CoreEditor采用对应约束注意力机制，结合几何对齐和语义相似性建模，实现多视图一致性编辑，并提供选择性编辑流程。

Result: 实验表明，CoreEditor能生成高质量、3D一致的编辑结果，细节更清晰，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoreEditor通过创新的注意力机制和语义建模，有效提升了文本驱动3D编辑的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual
descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained
2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over
multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view
consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce
CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key
innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces
precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout
the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment,
we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling
more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In
addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose
preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and
user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality,
3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior
methods.

TL;DR: LoRAtorio是一种无需训练的多LoRA组合框架，通过利用模型内在行为实现高效组合，解决了现有方法在开放场景中多LoRA适配器组合的难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多LoRA组合时表现不佳，尤其是在开放场景中，无法预先知道所需技能的数量和性质。

Method: 在潜在空间中划分空间块，计算每个块的预测噪声与基础模型的余弦相似度，构建空间感知权重矩阵，加权聚合LoRA输出。

Result: LoRAtorio在ClipScore上提升1.3%，在GPT-4V评估中胜率72.43%，并在多种潜在扩散模型中表现优异。

Conclusion: LoRAtorio通过空间感知权重和动态模块选择，显著提升了多LoRA组合的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in
text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts
such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle
to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended
settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in
advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for
multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is
motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains
produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when
operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base
model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two
observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,
which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method
operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing
cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base
model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight
matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain
drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that
incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We
extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling
inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio
achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in
ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises
effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.

Motivation: 评估GPT-5和GPT-4o在乳腺X光视觉问答任务中的表现，探索通用大语言模型在临床影像辅助中的潜力。

Method: 在四个公开乳腺X光数据集（EMBED、InBreast、CMMD、CBIS-DDSM）上测试GPT-5和GPT-4o，评估BI-RADS分级、异常检测和恶性分类任务。

Result: GPT-5在多个任务中表现最佳，但敏感性和特异性低于人类专家。例如，在EMBED数据集上，恶性分类准确率为52.8%。

Conclusion: GPT-5在乳腺X光筛查任务中表现有潜力，但需进一步优化才能用于高风险的临床影像应用。

Abstract: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation
with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening.
We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public
mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment,
abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently
was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and
domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores
among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%),
calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it
attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0%
malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection
and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS
accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared
with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and
specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening
tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging
applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the
tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising
trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with
mammography VQA tasks.

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：先通过SFT学习代码生成，再用RL优化决策，并设计GRPO-ATS算法平衡推理探索与代码执行精度。

Result: 在近20个基准测试中，Thyme在感知和复杂推理任务上表现显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Thyme通过代码增强多模态模型，为图像处理和逻辑推理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,
recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the
reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning
tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently
offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform
diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning
capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this
direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for
enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by
autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and
computational operations via executable code. This approach not only
facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,
rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,
all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these
operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:
an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,
followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually
collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the
learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies
distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning
exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental
analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20
benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,
particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning
tasks.

Conclusion: GenFlowRL能有效利用生成的对象中心流特征，在多样且具挑战性的场景中实现优越性能。

Abstract: Recent advances have shown that video generation models can enhance robot
learning by deriving effective robot actions through inverse dynamics. However,
these methods heavily depend on the quality of generated data and struggle with
fine-grained manipulation due to the lack of environment feedback. While
video-based reinforcement learning improves policy robustness, it remains
constrained by the uncertainty of video generation and the challenges of
collecting large-scale robot datasets for training diffusion models. To address
these limitations, we propose GenFlowRL, which derives shaped rewards from
generated flow trained from diverse cross-embodiment datasets. This enables
learning generalizable and robust policies from diverse demonstrations using
low-dimensional, object-centric features. Experiments on 10 manipulation tasks,
both in simulation and real-world cross-embodiment evaluations, demonstrate
that GenFlowRL effectively leverages manipulation features extracted from
generated object-centric flow, consistently achieving superior performance
across diverse and challenging scenarios. Our Project Page:

Motivation: 人类能根据环境状态调整行为，而机器人常因缺乏适应性导致执行失败。现有方法多为被动响应，主动重规划依赖人工规则和监督。

Result: 在AI2-THOR模拟器中验证，能提前检测语义和空间不匹配，显著提升任务成功率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 主动重规划框架有效预防执行失败，为机器人自适应行为提供了新思路。

Abstract: When humans perform everyday tasks, we naturally adjust our actions based on
the current state of the environment. For instance, if we intend to put
something into a drawer but notice it is closed, we open it first. However,
many autonomous robots lack this adaptive awareness. They often follow
pre-planned actions that may overlook subtle yet critical changes in the scene,
which can result in actions being executed under outdated assumptions and
eventual failure. While replanning is critical for robust autonomy, most
existing methods respond only after failures occur, when recovery may be
inefficient or infeasible. While proactive replanning holds promise for
preventing failures in advance, current solutions often rely on manually
designed rules and extensive supervision. In this work, we present a proactive
replanning framework that detects and corrects failures at subtask boundaries
by comparing scene graphs constructed from current RGB-D observations against
reference graphs extracted from successful demonstrations. When the current
scene fails to align with reference trajectories, a lightweight reasoning
module is activated to diagnose the mismatch and adjust the plan. Experiments
in the AI2-THOR simulator demonstrate that our approach detects semantic and
spatial mismatches before execution failures occur, significantly improving
task success and robustness.

Conclusion: 极坐标表示能更直观地建模空间关系，Polaris方法在轨迹预测与规划中表现优异。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction and planning in autonomous driving are highly
challenging due to the complexity of predicting surrounding agents' movements
and planning the ego agent's actions in dynamic environments. Existing methods
encode map and agent positions and decode future trajectories in Cartesian
coordinates. However, modeling the relationships between the ego vehicle and
surrounding traffic elements in Cartesian space can be suboptimal, as it does
not naturally capture the varying influence of different elements based on
their relative distances and directions. To address this limitation, we adopt
the Polar coordinate system, where positions are represented by radius and
angle. This representation provides a more intuitive and effective way to model
spatial changes and relative relationships, especially in terms of distance and
directional influence. Based on this insight, we propose Polaris, a novel
method that operates entirely in Polar coordinates, distinguishing itself from
conventional Cartesian-based approaches. By leveraging the Polar
representation, this method explicitly models distance and direction variations
and captures relative relationships through dedicated encoding and refinement
modules, enabling more structured and spatially aware trajectory prediction and
planning. Extensive experiments on the challenging prediction (Argoverse 2) and
planning benchmarks (nuPlan) demonstrate that Polaris achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in
feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while
enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We
demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation
using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object
detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared
to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine
offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint
while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during
runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++
(Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse
robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time
performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized
models.

### [143] [The Next Phase of Scientific Fact-Checking: Advanced Evidence Retrieval from Complex Structured Academic Papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20844)
*Xingyu Deng,Xi Wang,Mark Stevenson*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 科学事实核查旨在通过检索和分析研究文献中的证据来确定科学主张的真实性，但现有方法简化了问题，未处理完整文档的挑战。本文探讨了当前系统的局限性，并提出了改进方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学事实核查比一般事实核查更复杂，需适应科学知识的动态性、学术文献的结构复杂性及多模态表达。现有方法仅基于小规模数据集（如摘要），忽略了完整文档的挑战。

Method: 分析了当前系统的局限性，提出了五个关键研究挑战，包括证据驱动检索、时间感知检索、结构化文档解析、处理复杂科学表达和评估文献可信度，并进行了初步实验。

Result: 揭示了现有系统的不足，提出了潜在解决方案，为开发专门的信息检索系统奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 本文旨在推动科学事实核查的发展，提出针对实际应用的专门系统，以解决现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Scientific fact-checking aims to determine the veracity of scientific claims
by retrieving and analysing evidence from research literature. The problem is
inherently more complex than general fact-checking since it must accommodate
the evolving nature of scientific knowledge, the structural complexity of
academic literature and the challenges posed by long-form, multimodal
scientific expression. However, existing approaches focus on simplified
versions of the problem based on small-scale datasets consisting of abstracts
rather than full papers, thereby avoiding the distinct challenges associated
with processing complete documents. This paper examines the limitations of
current scientific fact-checking systems and reveals the many potential
features and resources that could be exploited to advance their performance. It
identifies key research challenges within evidence retrieval, including (1)
evidence-driven retrieval that addresses semantic limitations and topic
imbalance (2) time-aware evidence retrieval with citation tracking to mitigate
outdated information, (3) structured document parsing to leverage long-range
context, (4) handling complex scientific expressions, including tables,
figures, and domain-specific terminology and (5) assessing the credibility of
scientific literature. Preliminary experiments were conducted to substantiate
these challenges and identify potential solutions. This perspective paper aims
to advance scientific fact-checking with a specialised IR system tailored for
real-world applications.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出PaperRegister系统，通过离线分层索引和在线自适应检索，支持灵活粒度的论文搜索，优于传统基于摘要的搜索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有论文搜索系统仅基于摘要构建索引，无法满足灵活粒度的搜索需求，如模块配置等细节。

Method: 提出PaperRegister系统，采用离线分层索引和在线自适应检索，将传统摘要索引转化为分层索引树。

Result: 实验表明，PaperRegister在多种粒度搜索任务中表现最优，尤其在细粒度场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: PaperRegister是解决灵活粒度论文搜索需求的有效方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Paper search is an important activity for researchers, typically involving
using a query with description of a topic to find relevant papers. As research
deepens, paper search requirements may become more flexible, sometimes
involving specific details such as module configuration rather than being
limited to coarse-grained topics. However, previous paper search systems are
unable to meet these flexible-grained requirements, as these systems mainly
collect paper abstracts to construct index of corpus, which lack detailed
information to support retrieval by finer-grained queries. In this work, we
propose PaperRegister, consisted of offline hierarchical indexing and online
adaptive retrieval, transforming traditional abstract-based index into
hierarchical index tree for paper search, thereby supporting queries at
flexible granularity. Experiments on paper search tasks across a range of
granularity demonstrate that PaperRegister achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, and particularly excels in fine-grained scenarios, highlighting
the good potential as an effective solution for flexible-grained paper search
in real-world applications. Code for this work is in

Result: 在三个科学事实检查数据集上，+VeriRel在证据检索和下游验证中表现领先。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将验证反馈整合到文档相关性评估中，对科学事实检查系统具有潜力，未来可探索细粒度相关性评估。

Abstract: Identification of appropriate supporting evidence is critical to the success
of scientific fact checking. However, existing approaches rely on off-the-shelf
Information Retrieval algorithms that rank documents based on relevance rather
than the evidence they provide to support or refute the claim being checked.
This paper proposes +VeriRel which includes verification success in the
document ranking. Experimental results on three scientific fact checking
datasets (SciFact, SciFact-Open and Check-Covid) demonstrate consistently
leading performance by +VeriRel for document evidence retrieval and a positive
impact on downstream verification. This study highlights the potential of
integrating verification feedback to document relevance assessment for
effective scientific fact checking systems. It shows promising future work to
evaluate fine-grained relevance when examining complex documents for advanced
scientific fact checking.

*Yuxin Cao,Wei Song,Derui Wang,Jingling Xue,Jin Song Dong*

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 当前视频大语言模型（VideoLLMs）在生成视频摘要时存在安全漏洞，容易忽略视频中的有害内容。研究发现三个设计缺陷：稀疏帧采样、空间信息丢失和编码-解码脱节，导致90%以上的有害内容被忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示VideoLLMs在处理视频内容时的安全隐患，尤其是对有害内容的忽略问题，以推动模型设计的改进。

Method: 通过根因分析发现三个设计缺陷，并设计三种零查询黑盒攻击验证这些缺陷的影响。

Result: 实验表明，五种主流VideoLLMs在90%以上的情况下忽略有害内容，即使内容清晰可见。

Conclusion: 当前VideoLLMs的设计存在根本性漏洞，需改进采样策略、令牌压缩和解码机制，以确保语义覆盖而非仅追求速度。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) are increasingly deployed on numerous
critical applications, where users rely on auto-generated summaries while
casually skimming the video stream. We show that this interaction hides a
critical safety gap: if harmful content is embedded in a video, either as
full-frame inserts or as small corner patches, state-of-the-art VideoLLMs
rarely mention the harmful content in the output, despite its clear visibility
to human viewers. A root-cause analysis reveals three compounding design flaws:
(1) insufficient temporal coverage resulting from the sparse, uniformly spaced
frame sampling used by most leading VideoLLMs, (2) spatial information loss
introduced by aggressive token downsampling within sampled frames, and (3)
encoder-decoder disconnection, whereby visual cues are only weakly utilized
during text generation. Leveraging these insights, we craft three zero-query
black-box attacks, aligning with these flaws in the processing pipeline. Our
large-scale evaluation across five leading VideoLLMs shows that the harmfulness
omission rate exceeds 90% in most cases. Even when harmful content is clearly
present in all frames, these models consistently fail to identify it. These
results underscore a fundamental vulnerability in current VideoLLMs' designs
and highlight the urgent need for sampling strategies, token compression, and
decoding mechanisms that guarantee semantic coverage rather than speed alone.

TL;DR: 论文提出新数据集评估大型推理模型（LRMs）在不完整问题中的表现，发现其无法主动请求信息，并揭示其过度思考和幻觉行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估仅关注明确问题，但真正智能的代理应能主动请求信息以解决问题。

Method: 构建包含不完整问题的新数据集，系统评估LRMs表现。

Result: LRMs无法主动请求信息，存在过度思考和幻觉行为。

Conclusion: 研究为开发真正智能的LRMs提供了新视角，强调需超越单纯问题解决能力。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving
abilities in mathematics, as evaluated by existing benchmarks exclusively on
well-defined problems. However, such evaluation setup constitutes a critical
gap, since a genuine intelligent agent should not only solve problems (as a
math quiz solver), but also be able~to ask for information when the problems
lack sufficient information, enabling proactivity in responding users'
requests. To bridge such gap, we proposes a new dataset consisting of two types
of incomplete problems with diverse contexts. Based on the dataset, our
systematical evaluation of LRMs reveals their inability in proactively asking
for information. In addition, we uncover the behaviors related to overthinking
and hallucination of LRMs, and highlight the potential and challenges of
supervised fine-tuning in learning such ability. We hope to provide new
insights in developing LRMs with genuine intelligence, rather than just solving
problems.

TL;DR: Inclusion Arena是一个实时排行榜，通过从AI应用中收集的人类反馈对模型进行排名，弥补了静态数据集和通用领域提示的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准和排行榜大多依赖静态数据集或通用领域提示，无法反映模型在实际应用中的表现。

Method: 平台集成成对模型比较到用户交互中，采用Bradley-Terry模型，并引入Placement Matches和Proximity Sampling两项创新。

Result: 实证分析显示，Inclusion Arena提供可靠稳定的排名，数据传递性更高，且显著减少恶意操纵风险。

Conclusion: Inclusion Arena通过连接基础模型与实际应用，加速开发更实用的LLMs和MLLMs。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have ushered in a new era of AI capabilities, demonstrating near-human-level
performance across diverse scenarios. While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU)
and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the
development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced
general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in
real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion
Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected
directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model
comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect
practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the
Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches,
a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated
models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that
prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize
information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and
simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable
rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced
datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By
fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world
applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and
MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments. The platform is

*Ryosuke Isono,Shunsuke Ono*

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的时空融合框架TSSTF，通过TGTV和TGEC机制解决噪声环境下卫星图像时空融合的精细结构捕捉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像在现实场景中常受噪声干扰，现有方法难以保留精细空间结构，导致过度平滑和伪影。

Method: 引入TGTV（时间引导总变差）和TGEC（时间引导边缘约束）机制，将任务建模为约束优化问题，并采用预条件原始对偶分裂法求解。

Result: TSSTF在无噪声条件下与现有方法相当，在噪声条件下表现更优，并提供了通用参数推荐。

Conclusion: TSSTF在噪声环境下显著提升了时空融合的性能，同时增强了方法的可重复性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel spatiotemporal (ST) fusion framework for
satellite images, named Temporally-Similar Structure-Aware ST fusion (TSSTF).
ST fusion is a promising approach to address the trade-off between the spatial
and temporal resolution of satellite images. In real-world scenarios, observed
satellite images are severely degraded by noise due to measurement equipment
and environmental conditions. Consequently, some recent studies have focused on
enhancing the robustness of ST fusion methods against noise. However, existing
noise-robust ST fusion approaches often fail to capture fine spatial structure,
leading to oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this issue, TSSTF introduces
two key mechanisms: Temporally-Guided Total Variation (TGTV) and
Temporally-Guided Edge Constraint (TGEC). TGTV is a novel regularization
function that promotes spatial piecewise smoothness while preserving structural
details, guided by a reference high spatial resolution image acquired on a
nearby date. TGEC enforces consistency in edge locations between two temporally
adjacent images, while allowing for spectral variations. We formulate the ST
fusion task as a constrained optimization problem incorporating TGTV and TGEC,
and develop an efficient algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual
splitting method. Experimental results demonstrate that TSSTF performs
comparably to state-of-the-art methods under noise-free conditions and
outperforms them under noisy conditions. Additionally, we provide a
comprehensive set of recommended parameter values that consistently yield high
performance across diverse target regions and noise conditions, aiming to
enhance reproducibility and practical utility.

TL;DR: StyleMM是一个基于文本描述生成风格化3D人脸模型的新框架，通过扩散模型和图像训练实现风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在风格化3D人脸生成中无法保持身份和表情一致性的问题。

Method: 结合预训练的网格变形网络和纹理生成器，利用扩散模型生成风格化目标图像，并通过图像训练实现3D风格迁移。

Result: 在身份多样性和风格化能力上优于现有方法，生成具有一致顶点连接和动画性的风格化人脸网格。

Conclusion: StyleMM能够高效生成可控的风格化3D人脸模型，为3D人脸风格化提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce StyleMM, a novel framework that can construct a stylized 3D
Morphable Model (3DMM) based on user-defined text descriptions specifying a
target style. Building upon a pre-trained mesh deformation network and a
texture generator for original 3DMM-based realistic human faces, our approach
fine-tunes these models using stylized facial images generated via text-guided
image-to-image (i2i) translation with a diffusion model, which serve as
stylization targets for the rendered mesh. To prevent undesired changes in
identity, facial alignment, or expressions during i2i translation, we introduce
a stylization method that explicitly preserves the facial attributes of the
source image. By maintaining these critical attributes during image
stylization, the proposed approach ensures consistent 3D style transfer across
the 3DMM parameter space through image-based training. Once trained, StyleMM
enables feed-forward generation of stylized face meshes with explicit control
over shape, expression, and texture parameters, producing meshes with
consistent vertex connectivity and animatability. Quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in terms of identity-level facial diversity and stylization capability. The

Motivation: 尽管现有的文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型在生成与文本提示对齐的图像方面表现优异，但控制输出图像的视觉风格仍具挑战性。

Method: SPG构建风格噪声向量，并利用其与无条件噪声的方向偏差引导扩散过程朝向目标风格分布。

Result: 实验表明，SPG在语义保真和风格一致性方面优于现有方法，且兼容ControlNet和IPAdapter等框架。

Conclusion: SPG是一种简单、鲁棒且广泛适用的方法，有效解决了风格控制问题。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at aligning
generated images with textual prompts, controlling the visual style of the
output remains a challenging task. In this work, we propose Style-Prompting
Guidance (SPG), a novel sampling strategy for style-specific image generation.
SPG constructs a style noise vector and leverages its directional deviation
from unconditional noise to guide the diffusion process toward the target style
distribution. By integrating SPG with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), our
method achieves both semantic fidelity and style consistency. SPG is simple,
robust, and compatible with controllable frameworks like ControlNet and
IPAdapter, making it practical and widely applicable. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

Motivation: 膝关节骨关节炎（OA）的普遍性及其治疗TKR的不可预测性，尤其是术后并发症的多样性，促使研究者探索膝关节对齐生物标志物对TKR预后的影响。

Method: 综述现有TKR预后评分协议及膝关节对齐生物标志物，分析AI在膝关节X光片自动对齐测量中的应用。

Result: 膝关节对齐是影响TKR预后的关键因素之一，AI技术可自动化对齐测量，但目前研究多集中于OA诊断而非对齐生物标志物。

Conclusion: 未来研究应进一步探索膝关节对齐生物标志物及其与TKR预后的关系，并优化AI技术以提升预测准确性。

Abstract: Prevalent knee osteoarthritis (OA) imposes substantial burden on health
systems with no cure available. Its ultimate treatment is total knee
replacement (TKR). Complications from surgery and recovery are difficult to
predict in advance, and numerous factors may affect them. Radiographic knee
alignment is one of the key factors that impacts TKR outcomes, affecting
outcomes such as postoperative pain or function. Recently, artificial
intelligence (AI) has been introduced to the automatic analysis of knee
radiographs, for example, to automate knee alignment measurements. Existing
review articles tend to focus on knee OA diagnosis and segmentation of bones or
cartilages in MRI rather than exploring knee alignment biomarkers for TKR
outcomes and their assessment. In this review, we first examine the current
scoring protocols for evaluating TKR outcomes and potential knee alignment
biomarkers associated with these outcomes. We then discuss existing AI-based
approaches for generating knee alignment biomarkers from knee radiographs, and
explore future directions for knee alignment assessment and TKR outcome
prediction.

Conclusion: 该研究为子宫肌瘤的自动分割提供了标准化方法，推动了未来相关研究的进展。

Abstract: Uterine fibroids (myomas) are the most common benign tumors of the female
reproductive system, particularly among women of childbearing age. With a
prevalence exceeding 70%, they pose a significant burden on female reproductive
health. Clinical symptoms such as abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility,
pelvic pain, and pressure-related discomfort play a crucial role in guiding
treatment decisions, which are largely influenced by the size, number, and
anatomical location of the fibroids. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a
non-invasive and highly accurate imaging modality commonly used by clinicians
for the diagnosis of uterine fibroids. Segmenting uterine fibroids requires a
precise assessment of both the uterus and fibroids on MRI scans, including
measurements of volume, shape, and spatial location. However, this process is
labor intensive and time consuming and subjected to variability due to intra-
and inter-expert differences at both pre- and post-treatment stages. As a
result, there is a critical need for an accurate and automated segmentation
method for uterine fibroids. In recent years, deep learning algorithms have
shown re-markable improvements in medical image segmentation, outperforming
traditional methods. These approaches offer the potential for fully automated
segmentation. Several studies have explored the use of deep learning models to
achieve automated segmentation of uterine fibroids. However, most of the
previous work has been conducted using private datasets, which poses challenges
for validation and comparison between studies. In this study, we leverage the
publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset (UMD) to establish a baseline for
automated segmentation of uterine fibroids, enabling standardized evaluation
and facilitating future research in this domain.

Conclusion: Transformer架构在数字病理学中具有鲁棒性、泛化能力和临床潜力，为自动化癌症诊断系统提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable cancer diagnosis remains a critical challenge in modern
pathology, particularly for malignancies such as breast, prostate, bone, and
cervical, which exhibit complex histological variability. In this study, we
propose a transformer-based deep learning framework for multi-class tumor
classification in histopathological images. Leveraging a fine-tuned Vision
Transformer (ViT) architecture, our method addresses key limitations of
conventional convolutional neural networks, offering improved performance,
reduced preprocessing requirements, and enhanced scalability across tissue
types. To adapt the model for histopathological cancer images, we implement a
streamlined preprocessing pipeline that converts tiled whole-slide images into
PyTorch tensors and standardizes them through data normalization. This ensures
compatibility with the ViT architecture and enhances both convergence stability
and overall classification performance. We evaluate our model on four benchmark
datasets: ICIAR2018 (breast), SICAPv2 (prostate), UT-Osteosarcoma (bone), and
SipakMed (cervical) dataset -- demonstrating consistent outperformance over
existing deep learning methods. Our approach achieves classification accuracies
of 99.32%, 96.92%, 95.28%, and 96.94% for breast, prostate, bone, and cervical
cancers respectively, with area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores exceeding 99%
across all datasets. These results confirm the robustness, generalizability,
and clinical potential of transformer-based architectures in digital pathology.
Our work represents a significant advancement toward reliable, automated, and
interpretable cancer diagnosis systems that can alleviate diagnostic burdens
and improve healthcare outcomes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Schrödinger Bridge扩散模型的高效CT视野扩展方法，显著提升了重建速度和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT扫描中视野限制导致数据截断和伪影，传统方法难以恢复准确解剖结构，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用图像到图像的Schrödinger Bridge（I²SB）扩散模型，直接学习有限视野与扩展视野图像之间的随机映射。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上均优于现有扩散模型，重建速度大幅提升（0.19秒/切片）。

Conclusion: I²SB在准确性和效率上表现优异，适合实时或临床应用。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is a cornerstone imaging modality for non-invasive,
high-resolution visualization of internal anatomical structures. However, when
the scanned object exceeds the scanner's field of view (FOV), projection data
are truncated, resulting in incomplete reconstructions and pronounced artifacts
near FOV boundaries. Conventional reconstruction algorithms struggle to recover
accurate anatomy from such data, limiting clinical reliability. Deep learning
approaches have been explored for FOV extension, with diffusion generative
models representing the latest advances in image synthesis. Yet, conventional
diffusion models are computationally demanding and slow at inference due to
their iterative sampling process. To address these limitations, we propose an
efficient CT FOV extension framework based on the image-to-image Schr\"odinger
Bridge (I$^2$SB) diffusion model. Unlike traditional diffusion models that
synthesize images from pure Gaussian noise, I$^2$SB learns a direct stochastic
mapping between paired limited-FOV and extended-FOV images. This direct
correspondence yields a more interpretable and traceable generative process,
enhancing anatomical consistency and structural fidelity in reconstructions.
I$^2$SB achieves superior quantitative performance, with root-mean-square error
(RMSE) values of 49.8\,HU on simulated noisy data and 152.0HU on real data,
outperforming state-of-the-art diffusion models such as conditional denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (cDDPM) and patch-based diffusion methods.
Moreover, its one-step inference enables reconstruction in just 0.19s per 2D
slice, representing over a 700-fold speedup compared to cDDPM (135s) and
surpassing diffusionGAN (0.58s), the second fastest. This combination of
accuracy and efficiency makes I$^2$SB highly suitable for real-time or clinical
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于小波状态空间模型和频率掩码图的带状伪影修复方法，有效抑制低码率压缩中的带状伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低码率压缩常导致平滑区域（如天空）出现带状伪影，影响视觉质量，尤其在用户生成内容中因多次转码更为常见。

Method: 采用小波状态空间模型和频率掩码图，保留高频细节。

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优于现有方法（BAND-2k上DBI值为0.082），同时保持图像纹理。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效抑制带状伪影，视觉检查结果证实其效果。

Abstract: Compression at low bitrates in modern codecs often introduces banding
artifacts, especially in smooth regions such as skies. These artifacts degrade
visual quality and are common in user-generated content due to repeated
transcoding. We propose a banding restoration method that employs the Wavelet
State Space Model and a frequency masking map to preserve high-frequency
details. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark of open-source banding restoration
methods and evaluate their performance on two public banding image datasets.
Experimentation on the available datasets suggests that the proposed

### [157] [AnatoMaskGAN: GNN-Driven Slice Feature Fusion and Noise Augmentation for Medical Semantic Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11375)
*Zonglin Wu,Yule Xue,Qianxiang Hu,Yaoyao Feng,Yuqi Ma,Shanxiong Chen*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: AnatoMaskGAN是一种新型医学图像合成框架，通过嵌入切片相关空间特征、引入多样图像增强策略和优化深度特征学习，显著提升了复杂医学图像的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GAN方法在医学图像合成中缺乏空间一致性和多样性，限制了数据增强和分析的效果。

Method: 设计了基于GNN的切片特征融合模块、三维空间噪声注入策略和灰度纹理分类器，以提升空间一致性和多样性。

Result: 在L2R-OASIS和L2R-Abdomen CT数据集上，PSNR和SSIM指标显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AnatoMaskGAN的核心组件均对提升重建精度和感知质量有独立贡献，验证了其设计的有效性。

Abstract: Medical semantic-mask synthesis boosts data augmentation and analysis, yet
most GAN-based approaches still produce one-to-one images and lack spatial
consistency in complex scans. To address this, we propose AnatoMaskGAN, a novel
synthesis framework that embeds slice-related spatial features to precisely
aggregate inter-slice contextual dependencies, introduces diverse
image-augmentation strategies, and optimizes deep feature learning to improve
performance on complex medical images. Specifically, we design a GNN-based
strongly correlated slice-feature fusion module to model spatial relationships
between slices and integrate contextual information from neighboring slices,
thereby capturing anatomical details more comprehensively; we introduce a
three-dimensional spatial noise-injection strategy that weights and fuses
spatial features with noise to enhance modeling of structural diversity; and we
incorporate a grayscale-texture classifier to optimize grayscale distribution
and texture representation during generation. Extensive experiments on the
public L2R-OASIS and L2R-Abdomen CT datasets show that AnatoMaskGAN raises PSNR
on L2R-OASIS to 26.50 dB (0.43 dB higher than the current state of the art) and
achieves an SSIM of 0.8602 on L2R-Abdomen CT--a 0.48 percentage-point gain over
the best model, demonstrating its superiority in reconstruction accuracy and
perceptual quality. Ablation studies that successively remove the slice-feature
fusion module, spatial 3D noise-injection strategy, and grayscale-texture
classifier reveal that each component contributes significantly to PSNR, SSIM,
and LPIPS, further confirming the independent value of each core design in
enhancing reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality.

*Yinggan Tang,Quanwei Hu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: LKFMixer是一种纯卷积神经网络模型，通过大卷积核模拟自注意力机制，实现轻量化的图像超分辨率重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制在Transformer中表现出色，但计算成本高，难以用于轻量化模型。

Method: 使用31x31的大卷积核模拟自注意力，通过坐标分解减少参数和计算量，并设计了空间特征调制块（SFMB）和特征选择块（FSB）。

Result: LKFMixer家族在超分辨率性能上优于其他SOTA方法，例如在Manga109数据集上比SwinIR-light提升0.6dB PSNR，推理速度快5倍。

Conclusion: LKFMixer通过大卷积核和轻量化设计，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The success of self-attention (SA) in Transformer demonstrates the importance
of non-local information to image super-resolution (SR), but the huge computing
power required makes it difficult to implement lightweight models. To solve
this problem, we propose a pure convolutional neural network (CNN) model,
LKFMixer, which utilizes large convolutional kernel to simulate the ability of
self-attention to capture non-local features. Specifically, we increase the
kernel size to 31 to obtain the larger receptive field as possible, and reduce
the parameters and computations by coordinate decomposition. Meanwhile, a
spatial feature modulation block (SFMB) is designed to enhance the focus of
feature information on both spatial and channel dimension. In addition, by
introducing feature selection block (FSB), the model can adaptively adjust the
weights between local features and non-local features. Extensive experiments
show that the proposed LKFMixer family outperform other state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods in terms of SR performance and reconstruction quality. In particular,
compared with SwinIR-light on Manga109 dataset, LKFMixer-L achieves 0.6dB PSNR
improvement at $\times$4 scale, while the inference speed is $\times$5 times
faster. The code is available at https://github.com/Supereeeee/LKFMixer.

Conclusion: 开源框架、数据集和模型，推动CT皮层下分割研究。

Abstract: Subcortical segmentation in neuroimages plays an important role in
understanding brain anatomy and facilitating computer-aided diagnosis of
traumatic brain injuries and neurodegenerative disorders. However, training
accurate automatic models requires large amounts of labelled data. Despite the
availability of publicly available subcortical segmentation datasets for
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), a significant gap exists for Computed
Tomography (CT). This paper proposes an automatic ensemble framework to
generate high-quality subcortical segmentation labels for CT scans by
leveraging existing MRI-based models. We introduce a robust ensembling pipeline
to integrate them and apply it to unannotated paired MRI-CT data, resulting in
a comprehensive CT subcortical segmentation dataset. Extensive experiments on
multiple public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
framework. Furthermore, using our generated CT dataset, we train segmentation
models that achieve improved performance on related segmentation tasks. To
facilitate future research, we make our source code, generated dataset, and
trained models publicly available at
https://github.com/SCSE-Biomedical-Computing-Group/CT-Subcortical-Segmentation,
marking the first open-source release for CT subcortical segmentation to the
best of our knowledge.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖全监督学习，需要大量标注数据，获取成本高。本研究旨在减轻标注负担。

Method: 训练卷积神经网络集成模型，通过在线知识蒸馏将集成模型的洞察力传递给成员模型，提升整体性能。

Result: 在公开数据集上表现优于当前最优方法，知识蒸馏后的单个模型性能优于独立训练模型。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了标注数据需求，提供了更高效的皮肤病变分类解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Learning has emerged as a promising approach for skin lesion analysis.
However, existing methods mostly rely on fully supervised learning, requiring
extensive labeled data, which is challenging and costly to obtain. To alleviate
this annotation burden, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised deep
learning approach that integrates ensemble learning with online knowledge
distillation for enhanced skin lesion classification. Our methodology involves
training an ensemble of convolutional neural network models, using online
knowledge distillation to transfer insights from the ensemble to its members.
This process aims to enhance the performance of each model within the ensemble,
thereby elevating the overall performance of the ensemble itself.
Post-training, any individual model within the ensemble can be deployed at test
time, as each member is trained to deliver comparable performance to the
ensemble. This is particularly beneficial in resource-constrained environments.
Experimental results demonstrate that the knowledge-distilled individual model
performs better than independently trained models. Our approach demonstrates
superior performance on both the \emph{International Skin Imaging
Collaboration} 2018 and 2019 public benchmark datasets, surpassing current
state-of-the-art results. By leveraging ensemble learning and online knowledge
distillation, our method reduces the need for extensive labeled data while
providing a more resource-efficient solution for skin lesion classification in
real-world scenarios.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 研究分析了自监督学习（SSL）模型生成的离散标记对韵律信息的捕捉能力，旨在为设计离散标记提供实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散标记通常与语言模型或下游任务分开学习，其离散化选择（如SSL模型或聚类数量）需启发式决定，且缺乏对韵律信息捕捉的研究。

Method: 通过分析离散标记对人工修改韵律的敏感性，进行全面的韵律编码研究。

Result: 研究揭示了离散标记在捕捉韵律信息方面的能力。

Conclusion: 研究为设计能更好捕捉韵律信息的离散标记提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Recently, discrete tokens derived from self-supervised learning (SSL) models
via k-means clustering have been actively studied as pseudo-text in speech
language models and as efficient intermediate representations for various
tasks. However, these discrete tokens are typically learned in advance,
separately from the training of language models or downstream tasks. As a
result, choices related to discretization, such as the SSL model used or the
number of clusters, must be made heuristically. In particular, speech language
models are expected to understand and generate responses that reflect not only
the semantic content but also prosodic features. Yet, there has been limited
research on the ability of discrete tokens to capture prosodic information. To
address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive analysis focusing on
prosodic encoding based on their sensitivity to the artificially modified
prosody, aiming to provide practical guidelines for designing discrete tokens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多针对短音频生成或依赖噪声数据集，无法满足长视频音频生成需求。

Method: 扩展现有视频到音频模型，引入双轻量适配器，并发布干净标注的数据集。

Result: 模型在多项指标上显著提升，如FD、KL、IS等，同时减少能量差异和语义相关性。

Conclusion: LD-LAudio-V1有效提升长视频音频生成质量，数据集将推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Generating high-quality and temporally synchronized audio from video content
is essential for video editing and post-production tasks, enabling the creation
of semantically aligned audio for silent videos. However, most existing
approaches focus on short-form audio generation for video segments under 10
seconds or rely on noisy datasets for long-form video-to-audio zsynthesis. To
address these limitations, we introduce LD-LAudio-V1, an extension of
state-of-the-art video-to-audio models and it incorporates dual lightweight
adapters to enable long-form audio generation. In addition, we release a clean
and human-annotated video-to-audio dataset that contains pure sound effects
without noise or artifacts. Our method significantly reduces splicing artifacts
and temporal inconsistencies while maintaining computational efficiency.
Compared to direct fine-tuning with short training videos, LD-LAudio-V1
achieves significant improvements across multiple metrics: $FD_{\text{passt}}$
450.00 $\rightarrow$ 327.29 (+27.27%), $FD_{\text{panns}}$ 34.88 $\rightarrow$

TL;DR: BeyondWeb是一种合成数据生成框架，显著提升预训练性能，优于现有合成数据集，并揭示了合成数据质量的关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型预训练中，数据量的简单扩展已遇到瓶颈，合成数据成为突破性能限制的新方向，但其质量影响因素尚不明确。

Method: 提出BeyondWeb框架，生成高质量合成数据用于预训练，并通过多种优化策略提升数据质量。

Result: BeyondWeb在14项基准测试中平均优于Cosmopedia和Nemotron-Synth，分别提升5.1和2.6个百分点，训练速度更快，且小模型表现优于大模型。

Conclusion: 高质量合成数据需多因素联合优化，BeyondWeb展示了其潜力，但需科学方法和实践经验支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that
simply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a
data wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged
as a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this,
the factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this
work, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that
produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly
extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming
state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and
Nemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1
percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of
14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web
data and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for
180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token
budget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on
synthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to
rephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.
Overall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating
high-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly
optimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and
practical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements,
potentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative
improvements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为M&C的模型选择框架，帮助用户从模型平台中选择最适合目标数据域的预训练文本到图像（T2I）模型，而无需对所有模型进行微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前公开的预训练T2I模型虽然促进了模型的民主化，但用户面临如何选择最适合目标数据域的模型的挑战。

Method: M&C的核心是一个匹配图，包含模型和数据集节点，以及模型-数据和数据-数据对的边，用于捕捉微调性能和数据相似性。通过模型/数据特征和图嵌入特征，预测最佳微调模型。

Result: 在10个T2I模型和32个数据集的实验中，M&C成功预测了61.3%的最佳模型，其余情况下也选择了性能接近的模型。

Conclusion: M&C提供了一种高效选择预训练T2I模型的方法，显著减少了微调成本。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models based on diffusion and transformer architectures
advance rapidly. They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared
on a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI
applications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I
models and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I
models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new
challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain?
Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known
in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target
domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C,
which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model
platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The
core of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available
models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs
capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We
then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and,
critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph,
predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target
domain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets
against three baselines. Our results show that M&C successfully predicts the
best model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model
for the rest.

Result: 提出了基于因果抽象的计算实现理论，并分析了表征在其中的角色。

Conclusion: 因果抽象理论为理解计算与表征提供了新视角，尤其在泛化与预测中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Explanations of cognitive behavior often appeal to computations over
representations. What does it take for a system to implement a given
computation over suitable representational vehicles within that system? We
argue that the language of causality -- and specifically the theory of causal
abstraction -- provides a fruitful lens on this topic. Drawing on current
discussions in deep learning with artificial neural networks, we illustrate how
classical themes in the philosophy of computation and cognition resurface in
contemporary machine learning. We offer an account of computational
implementation grounded in causal abstraction, and examine the role for
representation in the resulting picture. We argue that these issues are most
profitably explored in connection with generalization and prediction.

Motivation: 随着指令微调的大型语言模型（LLM）在零样本或少样本提示范式下的广泛应用，尤其是在高风险领域，如何确保其分类器的群体公平性成为关键问题。传统公平算法无法适用于封闭权重LLM，因此需要新的方法。

Method: 将LLM视为特征提取器，通过策略性设计的提示从其概率预测中提取特征，并应用公平算法训练轻量级分类器。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，该框架在准确性和公平性之间取得了良好平衡，且优于基于LLM嵌入或原始表格特征的公平分类器。

Conclusion: 该框架为封闭权重LLM提供了一种高效、数据友好的公平分类器训练方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) enable a simple zero-shot
or few-shot prompting paradigm, also known as in-context learning, for building
prediction models. This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM
capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of
domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing
disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of
existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely
on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on
final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs
under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable
commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we
propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via
prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited
from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using
prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain
sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied
to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner.
Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong
accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from
both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is
data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings
(i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.

Result: 实验验证了模型在转导和归纳学习中的有效性。

Conclusion: HS-GPPT通过谱对齐实现了高效知识迁移。

Abstract: Graph ``pre-training and prompt-tuning'' aligns downstream tasks with
pre-trained objectives to enable efficient knowledge transfer under limited
supervision. However, existing methods rely on homophily-based low-frequency
knowledge, failing to handle diverse spectral distributions in real-world
graphs with varying homophily. Our theoretical analysis reveals a spectral
specificity principle: optimal knowledge transfer requires alignment between
pre-trained spectral filters and the intrinsic spectrum of downstream graphs.
Under limited supervision, large spectral gaps between pre-training and
downstream tasks impede effective adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose
the HS-GPPT model, a novel framework that ensures spectral alignment throughout
both pre-training and prompt-tuning. We utilize a hybrid spectral filter
backbone and local-global contrastive learning to acquire abundant spectral
knowledge. Then we design prompt graphs to align the spectral distribution with
pretexts, facilitating spectral knowledge transfer across homophily and
heterophily. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness under both
transductive and inductive learning settings. Our code is available at
https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HS-GPPT-62D2/.

Motivation: 脉冲神经网络（SNNs）具有高效能和类脑计算潜力，但其对抗扰动的脆弱性尚未充分研究。本文旨在探索SNNs的时间结构对抗鲁棒性的影响。

Method: 提出RTE训练框架，通过统一损失函数和随机采样策略优化时间子网络的鲁棒性，并减少对抗扰动的时间传递性。

Result: 实验表明，RTE在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，显著提升了SNNs的鲁棒性和时间多样性。

Conclusion: RTE为构建鲁棒的脉冲神经网络提供了理论基础，并强调了时间结构在对抗学习中的重要性。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising direction for
energy-efficient and brain-inspired computing, yet their vulnerability to
adversarial perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit
the adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling,
treating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete
timesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored
challenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency
for adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training
framework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the
temporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both
objectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for
efficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in
robust-accuracy trade-off. Additional analyses reveal that RTE reshapes the
internal robustness landscape of SNNs, leading to more resilient and temporally
diversified decision boundaries. Our study highlights the importance of
temporal structure in adversarial learning and offers a principled foundation
for building robust spiking models.

Motivation: 神经网络对输入噪声和对抗攻击较为脆弱，因此需要提升其鲁棒性。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上，该方法能有效抵抗噪声和对抗攻击，提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过收缩理论和正则化方法，可以显著提升卷积NODEs的鲁棒性，适用于噪声和对抗攻击场景。

Abstract: Neural networks can be fragile to input noise and adversarial attacks.
  In this work, we consider Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (NODEs), a family of continuous-depth neural networks represented by
dynamical systems, and propose to use contraction theory to improve their
robustness.
  For a contractive dynamical system two trajectories starting from different
initial conditions converge to each other exponentially fast.
  Contractive Convolutional NODEs can enjoy increased robustness as slight
perturbations of the features do not cause a significant change in the output.
  Contractivity can be induced during training by using a regularization term
involving the Jacobian of the system dynamics.
  To reduce the computational burden, we show that it can also be promoted
using carefully selected weight regularization terms for a class of NODEs with
slope-restricted activation functions.
  The performance of the proposed regularizers is illustrated through benchmark
image classification tasks on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, where images are
corrupted by different kinds of noise and attacks.

Motivation: 解决当前MAS设计中策略自主性不足及协作效率与监管之间的平衡问题。

Method: 重新定义MAS的基本执行单元，构建四层状态架构（任务、阶段、智能体、步骤）以实现拓扑优化与可控进度的统一。

Result: Allen实现了前所未有的策略自主性，并在协作结构的可控性上取得平衡。

Conclusion: Allen通过创新的架构设计，成功解决了MAS中的关键挑战，代码已开源。

Abstract: We introduce a new Multi-Agent System (MAS) - Allen, designed to address two
core challenges in current MAS design: (1) improve system's policy autonomy,
empowering agents to dynamically adapt their behavioral strategies, and (2)
achieving the trade-off between collaborative efficiency, task supervision, and
human oversight in complex network topologies.
  Our core insight is to redefine the basic execution unit in the MAS, allowing
agents to autonomously form different patterns by combining these units. We

### [171] [Fluid Dynamics and Domain Reconstruction from Noisy Flow Images Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Quasi-Conformal Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11216)

Result: 实验验证了方法在合成和真实血流数据上的有效性和鲁棒性，并进行了消融研究评估关键超参数影响。

Conclusion: 该方法能够高质量重建血流图像，为医学图像处理提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Blood flow imaging provides important information for hemodynamic behavior
within the vascular system and plays an essential role in medical diagnosis and
treatment planning. However, obtaining high-quality flow images remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we address the problem of denoising flow
images that may suffer from artifacts due to short acquisition times or
device-induced errors. We formulate this task as an optimization problem, where
the objective is to minimize the discrepancy between the modeled velocity
field, constrained to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equations, and the observed
noisy velocity data. To solve this problem, we decompose it into two
subproblems: a fluid subproblem and a geometry subproblem. The fluid subproblem
leverages a Physics-Informed Neural Network to reconstruct the velocity field
from noisy observations, assuming a fixed domain. The geometry subproblem aims
to infer the underlying flow region by optimizing a quasi-conformal mapping
that deforms a reference domain. These two subproblems are solved in an
alternating Gauss-Seidel fashion, iteratively refining both the velocity field
and the domain. Upon convergence, the framework yields a high-quality
reconstruction of the flow image. We validate the proposed method through
experiments on synthetic flow data in a converging channel geometry under
varying levels of Gaussian noise, and on real-like flow data in an aortic
geometry with signal-dependent noise. The results demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the approach. Additionally, ablation studies are conducted to
assess the influence of key hyperparameters.

### [172] [Expressive Speech Retrieval using Natural Language Descriptions of Speaking Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11187)
*Wonjune Kang,Deb Roy*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自然语言描述的语音风格检索任务，通过联合潜在空间嵌入语音和文本，实现根据说话风格检索语音片段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注语音内容检索，而本文旨在根据说话风格（如何说话）进行检索，填补了这一空白。

Method: 训练语音和文本编码器，将语音和风格描述嵌入到联合潜在空间，支持自由文本查询。分析了编码器架构、训练标准和提示增强。

Result: 在包含22种说话风格的多数据集上实验，Recall@k指标显示检索性能优异。

Conclusion: 该方法有效实现了基于风格的语音检索，为跨模态对齐和通用文本查询提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce the task of expressive speech retrieval, where the goal is to
retrieve speech utterances spoken in a given style based on a natural language
description of that style. While prior work has primarily focused on performing
speech retrieval based on what was said in an utterance, we aim to do so based
on how something was said. We train speech and text encoders to embed speech
and text descriptions of speaking styles into a joint latent space, which
enables using free-form text prompts describing emotions or styles as queries
to retrieve matching expressive speech segments. We perform detailed analyses
of various aspects of our proposed framework, including encoder architectures,
training criteria for effective cross-modal alignment, and prompt augmentation
for improved generalization to arbitrary text queries. Experiments on multiple
datasets encompassing 22 speaking styles demonstrate that our approach achieves
strong retrieval performance as measured by Recall@k.

### [173] [Emphasis Sensitivity in Speech Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11566)
*Shaun Cassini,Thomas Hain,Anton Ragni*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 研究现代语音模型是否对韵律重音敏感，提出基于残差的框架分析重音编码方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨语音模型是否系统性地编码重音与非重音词汇，弥补以往研究仅依赖孤立声学特征或标签预测的不足。

Method: 提出残差框架，将重音定义为中性词与重音词表征的差异，分析自监督和ASR微调模型。

Result: 残差与时长变化强相关，且词身份预测表现差；ASR微调模型中残差子空间更紧凑。

Conclusion: 韵律重音以结构化、低维变换方式编码，任务学习使其更一致。

Abstract: This work investigates whether modern speech models are sensitive to prosodic
emphasis - whether they encode emphasized and neutral words in systematically
different ways. Prior work typically relies on isolated acoustic correlates
(e.g., pitch, duration) or label prediction, both of which miss the relational
structure of emphasis. This paper proposes a residual-based framework, defining
emphasis as the difference between paired neutral and emphasized word
representations. Analysis on self-supervised speech models shows that these
residuals correlate strongly with duration changes and perform poorly at word
identity prediction, indicating a structured, relational encoding of prosodic
emphasis. In ASR fine-tuned models, residuals occupy a subspace up to 50% more
compact than in pre-trained models, further suggesting that emphasis is encoded
as a consistent, low-dimensional transformation that becomes more structured
with task-specific learning.

Result: 实验验证了代码扩散模型在最后一英里修复中的有效性，并分析了其特性。

Conclusion: 代码扩散模型可用于最后一英里修复，并能生成大量训练数据，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Code diffusion models generate code by iteratively removing noise from the
latent representation of a code snippet. During later steps of the diffusion
process, when the code snippet has almost converged, differences between
discrete representations of these snippets look like last-mile repairs applied
to broken or incomplete code. We evaluate the extent to which this resemblance
can be exploited to leverage pre-trained code diffusion models for the problem
of last-mile repair by considering two applications with significant potential.
First, we can leverage the diffusion model for last-mile repair by adding noise
to a broken code snippet and resuming the diffusion process. Second, we can
leverage the diffusion model to generate arbitrary amount of training data for
last-mile repair tasks (that are computationally more efficient) by sampling an
intermediate program (input) and the final program (output) from the diffusion
process. We perform experiments on 3 domains (Python, Excel and PowerShell) to
evaluate applications, as well as analyze properties.

### [175] [ORFuzz: Fuzzing the "Other Side" of LLM Safety -- Testing Over-Refusal](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11222)
*Haonan Zhang,Dongxia Wang,Yi Liu,Kexin Chen,Jiashui Wang,Xinlei Ying,Long Liu,Wenhai Wang*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出ORFuzz框架，通过进化测试方法检测和分析大型语言模型（LLMs）的过度拒绝问题，显著优于现有基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs因过度保守的安全措施而错误拒绝良性查询，影响可靠性和可用性，现有测试方法不足。

Method: ORFuzz整合安全类别感知种子选择、自适应变异器优化和人类对齐的OR-Judge模型，生成多样化测试用例。

Result: ORFuzz生成6.98%的平均过度拒绝率，是现有基准的两倍，并构建了ORFuzzSet新基准，覆盖10种LLMs。

Conclusion: ORFuzz和ORFuzzSet为自动化测试和社区资源提供了可靠框架，助力开发更可信的LLM系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit over-refusal - erroneously
rejecting benign queries due to overly conservative safety measures - a
critical functional flaw that undermines their reliability and usability.
Current methods for testing this behavior are demonstrably inadequate,
suffering from flawed benchmarks and limited test generation capabilities, as
highlighted by our empirical user study. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper introduces the first evolutionary testing framework, ORFuzz, for the
systematic detection and analysis of LLM over-refusals. ORFuzz uniquely
integrates three core components: (1) safety category-aware seed selection for
comprehensive test coverage, (2) adaptive mutator optimization using reasoning
LLMs to generate effective test cases, and (3) OR-Judge, a human-aligned judge
model validated to accurately reflect user perception of toxicity and refusal.
Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ORFuzz generates diverse, validated
over-refusal instances at a rate (6.98% average) more than double that of
leading baselines, effectively uncovering vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
ORFuzz's outputs form the basis of ORFuzzSet, a new benchmark of 1,855 highly
transferable test cases that achieves a superior 63.56% average over-refusal
rate across 10 diverse LLMs, significantly outperforming existing datasets.
ORFuzz and ORFuzzSet provide a robust automated testing framework and a
valuable community resource, paving the way for developing more reliable and
trustworthy LLM-based software systems.
