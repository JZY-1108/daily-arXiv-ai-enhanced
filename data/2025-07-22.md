### [1] [DeepWriter: A Fact-Grounded Multimodal Writing Assistant Based On Offline Knowledge Base](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14189)
*Song Mao,Lejun Cheng,Pinlong Cai,Guohang Yan,Ding Wang,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DeepWriter是一个基于离线知识库的多模态长文本写作助手，通过任务分解、大纲生成、多模态检索和分段写作，解决了LLMs在专业领域中的知识不足和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在专业领域（如金融、医学、法律）作为写作助手时，常因缺乏深度领域知识和幻觉问题而受限，现有方法（如RAG）存在检索不一致或依赖不可靠网络内容的问题。

Method: DeepWriter采用任务分解、大纲生成、多模态检索和分段写作的流程，结合结构化知识库和分层知识表示，生成专业级文档。

Result: 实验表明，DeepWriter在金融报告生成中，生成的文档在事实准确性和内容质量上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: DeepWriter通过离线知识库和多模态检索，显著提升了专业领域写作的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various applications. However, their use as writing assistants in specialized
domains like finance, medicine, and law is often hampered by a lack of deep
domain-specific knowledge and a tendency to hallucinate. Existing solutions,
such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), can suffer from inconsistency
across multiple retrieval steps, while online search-based methods often
degrade quality due to unreliable web content. To address these challenges, we
introduce DeepWriter, a customizable, multimodal, long-form writing assistant
that operates on a curated, offline knowledge base. DeepWriter leverages a
novel pipeline that involves task decomposition, outline generation, multimodal
retrieval, and section-by-section composition with reflection. By deeply mining
information from a structured corpus and incorporating both textual and visual
elements, DeepWriter generates coherent, factually grounded, and
professional-grade documents. We also propose a hierarchical knowledge
representation to enhance retrieval efficiency and accuracy. Our experiments on
financial report generation demonstrate that DeepWriter produces high-quality,
verifiable articles that surpasses existing baselines in factual accuracy and
generated content quality.

### [2] [Retention analysis of edited knowledge after fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14198)
*Fufang Wen,Shichang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，微调任务会显著影响大语言模型（LLMs）中已编辑知识的稳定性，导致其比预训练知识更容易被遗忘。冻结与编辑内容相关的层可以改善知识保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨微调任务对LLMs中已编辑知识的影响，以解决当前编辑方法在实际部署中的局限性。

Method: 系统研究不同微调目标与多种模型编辑技术的交互作用，并分析知识保留情况。

Result: 编辑后的知识在微调过程中比预训练知识更容易遗忘；冻结相关层可显著提升知识保留。

Conclusion: 当前编辑方法在微调下的鲁棒性需进一步评估，未来编辑方法可通过冻结相关层提升稳定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of knowledge, which often
requires updates to correct factual errors, incorporate newly acquired
information, or adapt model behavior. Model editing methods have emerged as
efficient solutions for such updates, offering localized and precise knowledge
modification at significantly lower computational cost than continual training.
In parallel, LLMs are frequently fine-tuned for a wide range of downstream
tasks. However, the effect of fine-tuning on previously edited knowledge
remains poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate how
different fine-tuning objectives interact with various model editing
techniques. Our findings show that edited knowledge is substantially more
susceptible to forgetting during fine-tuning than intrinsic knowledge acquired
through pre-training. This analysis highlights a key limitation of current
editing approaches and suggests that evaluating edit robustness under
downstream fine-tuning is critical for their practical deployment. We further
find that freezing layers associated with edited content can significantly
improve knowledge retention, offering insight into how future editing methods
might be made more robust.

### [3] [Open-Source LLMs Collaboration Beats Closed-Source LLMs: A Scalable Multi-Agent System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14200)
*Shengji Tang,Jianjian Cao,Weihao Lin,Jiale Hong,Bo Zhang,Shuyue Hu,Lei Bai,Tao Chen,Wanli Ouyang,Peng Ye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SMACS框架通过多智能体协作整合开源LLMs，性能超越闭源LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索开源LLMs是否能够通过协作达到或超越闭源LLMs的性能。

Method: 提出SMACS框架，包括检索式先验选择（RPS）和探索-利用驱动的后验增强（EPE）。

Result: 在八个主流基准测试中，SMACS整合15个开源LLMs，性能超过多个闭源LLMs。

Conclusion: SMACS展示了开源LLMs协作的潜力，为智能上限提供了新方向。

Abstract: This paper aims to demonstrate the potential and strengths of open-source
collectives. It leads to a promising question: Can we harness multiple
open-source LLMs to match or even beat the closed-source LLMs? To answer this,
we propose SMACS, a scalable multi-agent collaboration system (MACS) framework
with high performance. Specifically, for continuous integration of new LLMs and
generalization to diverse questions, we first propose a Retrieval-based Prior
Selection (RPS), which assigns a proxy performance score to each LLM to select
the Top-k LLMs at the instance level for any given question. Then, we propose
an Exploration-Exploitation-Driven Posterior Enhancement (EPE), encouraging the
generation of diverse responses through prior dropping and selecting the
high-quality response via a hybrid posterior score. Experiments on eight
mainstream benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our SMACS: by integrating
fifteen open-source LLMs, SMACS outperforms leading closed-source LLMs in 2025,
e.g., Claude-3.7-Sonnet (+12.73%), GPT-4.1(+5.36%) and GPT-o3-mini(+5.28%)
across multiple tasks. Remarkably, it even exceeds the average of best results
of different datasets from both open-source LLMs (+2.86%) and closed-source
LLMs (+2.04%), pushing the upper bound of intelligence. Code will be released
at https://github.com/magent4aci/SMACS.

### [4] [Let's Measure the Elephant in the Room: Facilitating Personalized Automated Analysis of Privacy Policies at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14214)
*Rui Zhao,Vladyslav Melnychuk,Jun Zhao,Jesse Wright,Nigel Shadbolt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoliAnalyzer是一个神经符号系统，通过NLP和逻辑推理分析隐私政策，帮助用户个性化理解数据使用条款，显著减少认知负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人很少阅读隐私政策，但希望了解数据使用情况，因此需要工具帮助个性化分析。

Method: 结合NLP提取政策文本的正式表示，并通过逻辑推理比较用户偏好与政策内容，生成合规报告。

Result: PoliAnalyzer在评估中表现优异（F1-score 90-100%），能高效识别冲突条款（仅4.8%需关注）。

Conclusion: PoliAnalyzer支持大规模自动化隐私政策分析，帮助用户重获数据控制权，促进社会对数据实践的讨论。

Abstract: In modern times, people have numerous online accounts, but they rarely read
the Terms of Service or Privacy Policy of those sites despite claiming
otherwise. This paper introduces PoliAnalyzer, a neuro-symbolic system that
assists users with personalized privacy policy analysis. PoliAnalyzer uses
Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract formal representations of data
usage practices from policy texts. In favor of deterministic, logical inference
is applied to compare user preferences with the formal privacy policy
representation and produce a compliance report. To achieve this, we extend an
existing formal Data Terms of Use policy language to model privacy policies as
app policies and user preferences as data policies. In our evaluation using our
enriched PolicyIE dataset curated by legal experts, PoliAnalyzer demonstrated
high accuracy in identifying relevant data usage practices, achieving F1-score
of 90-100% across most tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate how PoliAnalyzer can
model diverse user data-sharing preferences, derived from prior research as 23
user profiles, and perform compliance analysis against the top 100 most-visited
websites. This analysis revealed that, on average, 95.2% of a privacy policy's
segments do not conflict with the analyzed user preferences, enabling users to
concentrate on understanding the 4.8% (636 / 13205) that violates preferences,
significantly reducing cognitive burden. Further, we identified common
practices in privacy policies that violate user expectations - such as the
sharing of location data with 3rd parties. This paper demonstrates that
PoliAnalyzer can support automated personalized privacy policy analysis at
scale using off-the-shelf NLP tools. This sheds light on a pathway to help
individuals regain control over their data and encourage societal discussions
on platform data practices to promote a fairer power dynamic.

### [5] [Beyond Architectures: Evaluating the Role of Contextual Embeddings in Detecting Bipolar Disorder on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14231)
*Khalid Hasan,Jamil Saquer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了基于社交媒体的文本，利用NLP模型识别双相情感障碍的早期迹象，发现RoBERTa和基于BERT嵌入的LSTM模型表现最佳，而静态嵌入的LSTM效果较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双相情感障碍常因早期症状不明显和社会污名而被漏诊，研究旨在通过NLP技术提高早期筛查能力。

Method: 评估了多种Transformer模型（BERT、RoBERTa等）和基于不同嵌入的LSTM模型，使用Reddit帖子数据集进行实验。

Result: RoBERTa表现最佳（F1约98%），基于BERT嵌入的LSTM效果相近，而静态嵌入的LSTM几乎无效。DistilBERT在效率和准确性间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 上下文语言模型在双相情感障碍检测中至关重要，研究为心理健康NLP应用提供了模型选择依据。

Abstract: Bipolar disorder is a chronic mental illness frequently underdiagnosed due to
subtle early symptoms and social stigma. This paper explores the advanced
natural language processing (NLP) models for recognizing signs of bipolar
disorder based on user-generated social media text. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, ELECTRA,
DistilBERT) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models based on contextualized
(BERT) and static (GloVe, Word2Vec) word embeddings. Experiments were performed
on a large, annotated dataset of Reddit posts after confirming their validity
through sentiment variance and judgmental analysis. Our results demonstrate
that RoBERTa achieves the highest performance among transformer models with an
F1 score of ~98% while LSTM models using BERT embeddings yield nearly identical
results. In contrast, LSTMs trained on static embeddings fail to capture
meaningful patterns, scoring near-zero F1. These findings underscore the
critical role of contextual language modeling in detecting bipolar disorder. In
addition, we report model training times and highlight that DistilBERT offers
an optimal balance between efficiency and accuracy. In general, our study
offers actionable insights for model selection in mental health NLP
applications and validates the potential of contextualized language models to
support early bipolar disorder screening.

### [6] [Language Models Change Facts Based on the Way You Talk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14238)
*Matthew Kearney,Reuben Binns,Yarin Gal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLM）在用户交互应用中会根据文本中的身份标记（如种族、性别、年龄）产生偏见，影响医疗、法律、政治等领域的决策，可能导致有害后果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM如何利用用户文本中的身份信息进行决策，并评估其在高风险应用中的潜在偏见。

Method: 对五个高风险领域的LLM应用进行综合分析，分析身份标记对模型响应的影响。

Result: LLM对身份标记极为敏感，种族、性别和年龄等因素在不同应用中显著影响模型输出，例如医疗建议、薪资推荐和政治观点。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在高风险应用中的偏见问题，建议未来部署前进行类似评估，并提供新工具用于分析身份标记对模型决策的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in user-facing
applications, from providing medical consultations to job interview advice.
Recent research suggests that these models are becoming increasingly proficient
at inferring identity information about the author of a piece of text from
linguistic patterns as subtle as the choice of a few words. However, little is
known about how LLMs use this information in their decision-making in
real-world applications. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how
identity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five
different high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law,
politics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are
extremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race,
gender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For
instance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different
standards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same
symptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a
conservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by
older (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for
non-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men. Taken
together, these biases mean that the use of off-the-shelf LLMs for these
applications may cause harmful differences in medical care, foster wage gaps,
and create different political factual realities for people of different
identities. Beyond providing an analysis, we also provide new tools for
evaluating how subtle encoding of identity in users' language choices impacts
model decisions. Given the serious implications of these findings, we recommend
that similar thorough assessments of LLM use in user-facing applications are
conducted before future deployment.

### [7] [CCL-XCoT: An Efficient Cross-Lingual Knowledge Transfer Method for Mitigating Hallucination Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14239)
*Weihua Zheng,Roy Ka-Wei Lee,Zhengyuan Liu,Kui Wu,AiTi Aw,Bowei Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出CCL-XCoT框架，通过两阶段微调减少多语言大模型在低资源语言中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大模型在低资源语言中易产生幻觉（如不准确或虚构的输出），影响领域特定生成任务的表现。

Method: 1. 基于课程的对比学习增强跨语言语义对齐；2. 在指令微调阶段引入跨语言思维链（XCoT）提示策略。

Result: CCL-XCoT将幻觉率降低高达62%，显著提升跨语言事实知识迁移效果。

Conclusion: CCL-XCoT有效减少多语言大模型的幻觉问题，无需依赖外部检索或多模型集成。

Abstract: Multilingual Large Language Models(MLLMs) demonstrate strong generalization
across languages, yet they remain prone to hallucinations, especially in
low-resource languages, due to training data imbalances. These hallucinations,
which include inaccurate or fabricated outputs, are particularly problematic in
domain-specific generation tasks (Chataigner et al., 2024). To address this
challenge, we propose CCL-XCoT(Curriculum-based Contrastive Learning-based
Cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought), a two-stage fine-tuning framework for
mitigating hallucination in MLLMs. Our approach first enhances cross-lingual
semantic alignment through curriculum-based contrastive learning combined with
next-token prediction during continued pre-training. Building on this
foundation, we then introduce a cross-lingual Chain-of-Thought (XCoT) prompting
strategy during instruction fine-tuning, which guides the model to reason in a
high-resource language before generating answers in the target low-resource
language. Experimental results show that CCL-XCoT reduces hallucination rates
by up to 62% and substantially improves factual knowledge transfer across
language pairs, without relying on external retrieval or multi-model ensembles.

*Mohammad Shahedur Rahman,Peng Gao,Yuede Ji*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）供应链中模型与数据集的关系，构建了一个异构图进行分析，揭示了供应链的结构特征和动态性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLM的开发依赖预训练模型和外部数据集，可能继承漏洞或偏见，因此需要理解这些组件的来源和关系以降低风险。

Method: 设计方法系统收集LLM供应链数据，构建有向异构图（397,376节点和453,469边），并进行多种分析。

Result: 发现供应链图具有大规模、稀疏性、幂律分布、核心密集外围分散、数据集关键作用、模型与数据集强依赖及动态更新等特点。

Conclusion: 研究为理解LLM供应链提供了框架，有助于风险检测、公平性改进和合规性保障。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning to process and predict
sequences of words from context, enabling them to perform various NLP tasks,
such as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation.
However, the growing size and complexity of developing, training, and deploying
advanced LLMs require extensive computational resources and large datasets.
This creates a barrier for users. As a result, platforms that host models and
datasets are widely used. For example, Hugging Face, one of the most popular
platforms, hosted 1.8 million models and 450K datasets by June 2025, with no
sign of slowing down. Since many LLMs are built from base models, pre-trained
models, and external datasets, they can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or
malicious components from earlier models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical
to understand the origin and development of these components to better detect
potential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance. Motivated by
this, our project aims to study the relationships between models and datasets,
which are core components of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a method to
systematically collect LLM supply chain data. Using this data, we build a
directed heterogeneous graph to model the relationships between models and
datasets, resulting in a structure with 397,376 nodes and 453,469 edges. We
then perform various analyses and uncover several findings, such as: (i) the
LLM supply chain graph is large, sparse, and follows a power-law degree
distribution; (ii) it features a densely connected core and a fragmented
periphery; (iii) datasets play pivotal roles in training; (iv) strong
interdependence exists between models and datasets; and (v) the graph is
dynamic, with daily updates reflecting the ecosystem's ongoing evolution.

TL;DR: Promptomatix是一个自动提示优化框架，能将自然语言任务描述转化为高质量提示，无需手动调整或专业知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）依赖精心设计的提示，但提示工程目前仍依赖人工且不一致，非专家难以掌握。

Method: Promptomatix结合元提示优化器和DSPy编译器，分析用户意图、生成合成数据、选择提示策略，并通过成本感知目标优化提示。

Result: 在5类任务中，Promptomatix表现优于现有库，同时减少提示长度和计算开销。

Conclusion: Promptomatix实现了高效、可扩展的提示优化，为非专家提供了便捷的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform best with well-crafted prompts, yet
prompt engineering remains manual, inconsistent, and inaccessible to
non-experts. We introduce Promptomatix, an automatic prompt optimization
framework that transforms natural language task descriptions into high-quality
prompts without requiring manual tuning or domain expertise. Promptomatix
supports both a lightweight meta-prompt-based optimizer and a DSPy-powered
compiler, with modular design enabling future extension to more advanced
frameworks. The system analyzes user intent, generates synthetic training data,
selects prompting strategies, and refines prompts using cost-aware objectives.
Evaluated across 5 task categories, Promptomatix achieves competitive or
superior performance compared to existing libraries, while reducing prompt
length and computational overhead making prompt optimization scalable and
efficient.

TL;DR: ChartScope是一种针对多样化图表类型优化的LVLM，通过高效数据生成管道和双路径训练策略提升图表理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖有限图表类型的配对数据且缺乏针对性预训练，限制了模型对多样化图表和底层数据的理解。

Method: 提出高效数据生成管道合成多样化图表配对数据，并采用双路径训练策略结合底层数据推理。

Result: 实验表明ChartScope显著提升对多样化图表类型的理解能力。

Conclusion: ChartScope通过创新数据生成和训练策略，解决了现有方法的局限性，并建立了新的评估基准。

Abstract: Recent methods for customizing Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) for
domain-specific tasks have shown promising results in scientific chart
comprehension. However, existing approaches face two major limitations: First,
they rely on paired data from only a few chart types, limiting generalization
to wide range of chart types. Secondly, they lack targeted pre-training for
chart-data alignment, which hampers the model's understanding of underlying
data. In this paper, we introduce ChartScope, an LVLM optimized for in-depth
chart comprehension across diverse chart types. We propose an efficient data
generation pipeline that synthesizes paired data for a wide range of chart
types, along with a novel Dual-Path training strategy that enabling the model
to succinctly capture essential data details while preserving robust reasoning
capabilities by incorporating reasoning over the underlying data. Lastly, we
establish ChartDQA, a new benchmark for evaluating not only question-answering
at different levels but also underlying data understanding. Experimental
results demonstrate that ChartScope significantly enhances comprehension on a
wide range of chart types. The code and data are available at
https://davidhalladay.github.io/chartscope_demo.

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于LLM的选择性翻译方法，用于改善多语言大语言模型在低资源语言（如印地语）中的对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言大语言模型在低资源语言中表现较差，而高质量对齐数据稀缺，翻译现有英语数据时难以保留代码、数学表达式等关键内容。

Method: 提出选择性翻译技术，仅翻译可翻译部分，保留非翻译内容和句子结构，并对比Google Cloud Translation和Llama-3.1-405B的效果。

Result: 实验表明选择性翻译比普通翻译更有效，混合翻译样本和原始英语数据可提升对齐效果。

Conclusion: 选择性翻译是改善多语言LLM对齐的实用且有效的方法。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate a performance gap
between English and non-English languages, particularly in low-resource
settings. Aligning these models to low-resource languages is essential yet
challenging due to limited high-quality data. While English alignment datasets
are readily available, curating equivalent data in other languages is expensive
and time-consuming. A common workaround is to translate existing English
alignment data; however, standard translation techniques often fail to preserve
critical elements such as code, mathematical expressions, and structured
formats like JSON. In this work, we investigate LLM-based selective
translation, a technique that selectively translates only the translatable
parts of a text while preserving non-translatable content and sentence
structure. We conduct a systematic study to explore key questions around this
approach, including its effectiveness compared to vanilla translation, the
importance of filtering noisy outputs, and the benefits of mixing translated
samples with original English data during alignment. Our experiments focus on
the low-resource Indic language Hindi and compare translations generated by
Google Cloud Translation (GCP) and Llama-3.1-405B. The results highlight the
promise of selective translation as a practical and effective method for
improving multilingual alignment in LLMs.

Motivation: 探究LLMs的认知能力是否接近人类，特别是在处理语言时间意义时的表现。

Method: 采用专家参与的探测流程，设计针对性实验评估LLMs的语义表示和语用推理能力。

Result: LLMs依赖典型性、判断不一致且因果推理能力不足，表明其叙事理解能力有限。

Conclusion: LLMs处理时间意义的方式与人类不同，缺乏稳健的叙事理解能力，并提出标准化评估框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit increasingly sophisticated linguistic
capabilities, yet the extent to which these behaviors reflect human-like
cognition versus advanced pattern recognition remains an open question. In this
study, we investigate how LLMs process the temporal meaning of linguistic
aspect in narratives that were previously used in human studies. Using an
Expert-in-the-Loop probing pipeline, we conduct a series of targeted
experiments to assess whether LLMs construct semantic representations and
pragmatic inferences in a human-like manner. Our findings show that LLMs
over-rely on prototypicality, produce inconsistent aspectual judgments, and
struggle with causal reasoning derived from aspect, raising concerns about
their ability to fully comprehend narratives. These results suggest that LLMs
process aspect fundamentally differently from humans and lack robust narrative
understanding. Beyond these empirical findings, we develop a standardized
experimental framework for the reliable assessment of LLMs' cognitive and
linguistic capabilities.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Online news outlets operate predominantly on an advertising-based revenue
model, compelling journalists to create headlines that are often scandalous,
intriguing, and provocative -- commonly referred to as clickbait. Automatic
detection of clickbait headlines is essential for preserving information
quality and reader trust in digital media and requires both contextual
understanding and world knowledge. For this task, particularly in
less-resourced languages, it remains unclear whether fine-tuned methods or
in-context learning (ICL) yield better results. In this paper, we compile CLIC,
a novel dataset for clickbait detection of Croatian news headlines spanning a
20-year period and encompassing mainstream and fringe outlets. We fine-tune the
BERTi\'c model on this task and compare its performance to LLM-based ICL
methods with prompts both in Croatian and English. Finally, we analyze the
linguistic properties of clickbait. We find that nearly half of the analyzed
headlines contain clickbait, and that finetuned models deliver better results
than general LLMs.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）在人格评估中的应用，发现其虽然具有高重测信度，但构念效度有限，与真实分数的相关性较弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在人格特质推断中的潜力，解决以往研究依赖合成数据或缺乏心理测量效度的问题。

Method: 使用555个半结构化访谈和BFI-10自评分数作为基准，测试三种先进LLMs（GPT-4.1 Mini、Meta-LLaMA和DeepSeek）在零样本提示和思维链提示下的表现。

Result: 模型重测信度高，但构念效度低（最大Pearson's r = 0.27），预测偏向中等或高特质水平，思维链提示和长输入上下文仅略微改善分布对齐。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在人格推断中存在局限性，需基于证据的开发以提升心理学应用效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Meta's LLaMA offer a
promising approach for scalable personality assessment from open-ended
language. However, inferring personality traits remains challenging, and
earlier work often relied on synthetic data or social media text lacking
psychometric validity. We introduce a real-world benchmark of 555
semi-structured interviews with BFI-10 self-report scores for evaluating
LLM-based personality inference. Three state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-4.1 Mini,
Meta-LLaMA, and DeepSeek) were tested using zero-shot prompting for BFI-10 item
prediction and both zero-shot and chain-of-thought prompting for Big Five trait
inference. All models showed high test-retest reliability, but construct
validity was limited: correlations with ground-truth scores were weak (max
Pearson's $r = 0.27$), interrater agreement was low (Cohen's $\kappa < 0.10$),
and predictions were biased toward moderate or high trait levels.
Chain-of-thought prompting and longer input context modestly improved
distributional alignment, but not trait-level accuracy. These results
underscore limitations in current LLM-based personality inference and highlight
the need for evidence-based development for psychological applications.

Abstract: The introduction of large language models has brought rapid progress on
Text-to-SQL benchmarks, but it is not yet easy to build a working enterprise
solution. In this paper, we present insights from building an internal chatbot
that enables LinkedIn's product managers, engineers, and operations teams to
self-serve data insights from a large, dynamic data lake. Our approach features
three components. First, we construct a knowledge graph that captures
up-to-date semantics by indexing database metadata, historical query logs,
wikis, and code. We apply clustering to identify relevant tables for each team
or product area. Second, we build a Text-to-SQL agent that retrieves and ranks
context from the knowledge graph, writes a query, and automatically corrects
hallucinations and syntax errors. Third, we build an interactive chatbot that
supports various user intents, from data discovery to query writing to
debugging, and displays responses in rich UI elements to encourage follow-up
chats. Our chatbot has over 300 weekly users. Expert review shows that 53% of
its responses are correct or close to correct on an internal benchmark set.
Through ablation studies, we identify the most important knowledge graph and
modeling components, offering a practical path for developing enterprise
Text-to-SQL solutions.

Motivation: 生物医学文本中的关系分类对构建知识图谱和药物再利用等应用至关重要，但现有方法存在性能瓶颈。

Method: 使用师生框架，教师模型分析学生模型的预测错误并生成针对性修正，通过指令调优和课程学习训练两个学生模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过错误分析和课程学习显著提升了关系分类性能，并构建了支持上下文感知分类的异质生物医学知识图谱。

Abstract: Relation Classification (RC) in biomedical texts is essential for
constructing knowledge graphs and enabling applications such as drug
repurposing and clinical decision-making. We propose an error-aware
teacher--student framework that improves RC through structured guidance from a
large language model (GPT-4o). Prediction failures from a baseline student
model are analyzed by the teacher to classify error types, assign difficulty
scores, and generate targeted remediations, including sentence rewrites and
suggestions for KG-based enrichment. These enriched annotations are used to
train a first student model via instruction tuning. This model then annotates a
broader dataset with difficulty scores and remediation-enhanced inputs. A
second student is subsequently trained via curriculum learning on this dataset,
ordered by difficulty, to promote robust and progressive learning. We also
construct a heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph from PubMed abstracts to
support context-aware RC. Our approach achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on 4 of 5 PPI datasets and the DDI dataset, while remaining
competitive on ChemProt.

designed to deliver expert-level understanding and reasoning for the industry's
complex challenges. Leveraging a carefully curated industry knowledge base, the
model undergoes supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to enhance
its reasoning and comprehension capabilities. To further accelerate
development, we implemented an automated evaluation framework that simulates
expert-level assessments. We also integrated a domain-specific
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mechanism, resulting in notable
performance gains on benchmark datasets. Despite its relatively compact size of
32 billion parameters, X-Intelligence 3.0 outperforms SOTA DeepSeek-R1-671B
across multiple evaluations. This demonstrates its exceptional efficiency and
establishes it as a powerful solution to the longstanding reasoning challenges

Motivation: 研究旨在通过多模态方法（结合语音和声学特征）提升CPS指标的检测效果，并探索人机互补性在诊断任务中的应用。

Method: 采用多模态BERT模型（AudiBERT）和传统BERT模型，结合语音和声学特征，进行CPS指标分类实验。

Conclusion: 提出了一种结构化方法以实现人机互补性，强调模型可解释性对支持人类参与的重要性。

Abstract: Detecting collaborative problem solving (CPS) indicators from dialogue using
machine learning techniques is a significant challenge for the field of AI in
Education. Recent studies have explored the use of Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) models on transcription data to
reliably detect meaningful CPS indicators. A notable advancement involved the
multimodal BERT variant, AudiBERT, which integrates speech and
acoustic-prosodic audio features to enhance CPS diagnosis. Although initial
results demonstrated multimodal improvements, the statistical significance of
these enhancements remained unclear, and there was insufficient guidance on
leveraging human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis tasks. This workshop
paper extends the previous research by highlighting that the AudiBERT model not
only improved the classification of classes that were sparse in the dataset,
but it also had statistically significant class-wise improvements over the BERT
model for classifications in the social-cognitive dimension. However, similar
significant class-wise improvements over the BERT model were not observed for
classifications in the affective dimension. A correlation analysis highlighted
that larger training data was significantly associated with higher recall
performance for both the AudiBERT and BERT models. Additionally, the precision
of the BERT model was significantly associated with high inter-rater agreement
among human coders. When employing the BERT model to diagnose indicators within
these subskills that were well-detected by the AudiBERT model, the performance
across all indicators was inconsistent. We conclude the paper by outlining a
structured approach towards achieving human-AI complementarity for CPS
diagnosis, highlighting the crucial inclusion of model explainability to
support human agency and engagement in the reflective coding process.

Motivation: 增强BERT模型在CPS分类中的可解释性，以提升教师等终端用户的信任和采用率。

Method: 使用SHAP方法分析BERT模型分类决策中不同单词的贡献。

Result: 发现分类性能好不一定解释合理，某些单词频繁影响分类，甚至存在无意义的虚假单词。

Conclusion: 模型透明度需结合人类推理，未来可探索集成模型架构和人机互补的CPS诊断方法。

Abstract: The use of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
model and its variants for classifying collaborative problem solving (CPS) has
been extensively explored within the AI in Education community. However,
limited attention has been given to understanding how individual tokenised
words in the dataset contribute to the model's classification decisions.
Enhancing the explainability of BERT-based CPS diagnostics is essential to
better inform end users such as teachers, thereby fostering greater trust and
facilitating wider adoption in education. This study undertook a preliminary
step towards model transparency and explainability by using SHapley Additive
exPlanations (SHAP) to examine how different tokenised words in transcription
data contributed to a BERT model's classification of CPS processes. The
findings suggested that well-performing classifications did not necessarily
equate to a reasonable explanation for the classification decisions. Particular
tokenised words were used frequently to affect classifications. The analysis
also identified a spurious word, which contributed positively to the
classification but was not semantically meaningful to the class. While such
model transparency is unlikely to be useful to an end user to improve their
practice, it can help them not to overrely on LLM diagnostics and ignore their
human expertise. We conclude the workshop paper by noting that the extent to
which the model appropriately uses the tokens for its classification is
associated with the number of classes involved. It calls for an investigation
into the exploration of ensemble model architectures and the involvement of
human-AI complementarity for CPS diagnosis, since considerable human reasoning
is still required for fine-grained discrimination of CPS subskills.

Motivation: 解决NLP任务中数据稀缺和类别不平衡问题，探索传统数据增强方法在新一代大语言模型（如GPT）中的应用潜力。

Method: 选择了回译和复述等传统方法，结合ChatGPT进行实验，比较了四种数据增强方法在不同实验设置下的效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，回译和复述方法在生成数据质量和分类性能上优于或少样本生成方法。

Conclusion: 传统数据增强方法在大语言模型支持下仍具有竞争力，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Numerous domain-specific machine learning tasks struggle with data scarcity
and class imbalance. This paper systematically explores data augmentation
methods for NLP, particularly through large language models like GPT. The
purpose of this paper is to examine and evaluate whether traditional methods
such as paraphrasing and backtranslation can leverage a new generation of
models to achieve comparable performance to purely generative methods. Methods
aimed at solving the problem of data scarcity and utilizing ChatGPT were
chosen, as well as an exemplary dataset. We conducted a series of experiments
comparing four different approaches to data augmentation in multiple
experimental setups. We then evaluated the results both in terms of the quality
of generated data and its impact on classification performance. The key
findings indicate that backtranslation and paraphrasing can yield comparable or
even better results than zero and a few-shot generation of examples.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在非洲低资源医疗环境中的有效性，填补其在本地化医疗内容上的性能差距。

Method: 使用RAG技术将临床问题与肯尼亚国家指南对齐，生成多语言临床场景、选择题和答案，并通过专家评审确保质量。

Result: 发现LLMs在本地化医疗场景中表现显著不足，尤其是在非洲医疗内容上的准确性低于美国基准。

Conclusion: 提供了一个可复制的指南驱动动态基准测试模型，支持非洲医疗系统中AI的安全部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models(LLMs) hold promise for improving healthcare access in
low-resource settings, but their effectiveness in African primary care remains
underexplored. We present a methodology for creating a benchmark dataset and
evaluation framework focused on Kenyan Level 2 and 3 clinical care. Our
approach uses retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to ground clinical questions
in Kenya's national guidelines, ensuring alignment with local standards. These
guidelines were digitized, chunked, and indexed for semantic retrieval. Gemini
Flash 2.0 Lite was then prompted with guideline excerpts to generate realistic
clinical scenarios, multiple-choice questions, and rationale based answers in
English and Swahili. Kenyan physicians co-created and refined the dataset, and
a blinded expert review process ensured clinical accuracy, clarity, and
cultural appropriateness. The resulting Alama Health QA dataset includes
thousands of regulator-aligned question answer pairs across common outpatient
conditions. Beyond accuracy, we introduce evaluation metrics that test clinical
reasoning, safety, and adaptability such as rare case detection (Needle in the
Haystack), stepwise logic (Decision Points), and contextual adaptability.
Initial results reveal significant performance gaps when LLMs are applied to
localized scenarios, consistent with findings that LLM accuracy is lower on
African medical content than on US-based benchmarks. This work offers a
replicable model for guideline-driven, dynamic benchmarking to support safe AI
deployment in African health systems.

Result: 线性技术在形态学关系上达到90%的忠实度，且在多语言和跨模型中表现一致。

Conclusion: 语言模型中的某些概念关系（如形态学）可以通过潜在空间的线性变换稀疏编码，具有较高的可解释性。

Abstract: A two-part affine approximation has been found to be a good approximation for
transformer computations over certain subject object relations. Adapting the
Bigger Analogy Test Set, we show that the linear transformation Ws, where s is
a middle layer representation of a subject token and W is derived from model
derivatives, is also able to accurately reproduce final object states for many
relations. This linear technique is able to achieve 90% faithfulness on
morphological relations, and we show similar findings multi-lingually and
across models. Our findings indicate that some conceptual relationships in
language models, such as morphology, are readily interpretable from latent
space, and are sparsely encoded by cross-layer linear transformations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在多种NLP任务中表现优异，但其生成的幻觉（不准确回答）问题严重影响了模型的安全性和可靠性。不确定性估计是区分正确与错误回答的关键。

Method: Cleanse通过聚类量化隐藏嵌入中的语义一致性比例，以估计不确定性。

Result: 在LLaMA-7B、LLaMA-13B、LLaMA2-7B和Mistral-7B模型及SQuAD和CoQA基准测试中验证了Cleanse的有效性。

Conclusion: Cleanse是一种有效的幻觉检测方法，有助于提升LLM的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) across
various NLP tasks, hallucinations in LLMs--where LLMs generate inaccurate
responses--remains as a critical problem as it can be directly connected to a
crisis of building safe and reliable LLMs. Uncertainty estimation is primarily
used to measure hallucination levels in LLM responses so that correct and
incorrect answers can be distinguished clearly. This study proposes an
effective uncertainty estimation approach, \textbf{Cl}ust\textbf{e}ring-based
sem\textbf{an}tic con\textbf{s}ist\textbf{e}ncy (\textbf{Cleanse}). Cleanse
quantifies the uncertainty with the proportion of the intra-cluster consistency
in the total consistency between LLM hidden embeddings which contain adequate
semantic information of generations, by employing clustering. The effectiveness
of Cleanse for detecting hallucination is validated using four off-the-shelf
models, LLaMA-7B, LLaMA-13B, LLaMA2-7B and Mistral-7B and two
question-answering benchmarks, SQuAD and CoQA.

Result: 流程将文档从202M减少到25M，模型性能提升显著，超越现有模型。

Conclusion: Mangosteen为泰语及区域LLM研究提供了透明、可复现的基础。

Abstract: Pre-training data shapes a language model's quality, but raw web text is
noisy and demands careful cleaning. Existing large-scale corpora rely on
English-centric or language-agnostic pipelines whose heuristics do not capture
Thai script or cultural nuances, leaving risky material such as gambling
content untreated. Prior Thai-specific efforts customize pipelines or build new
ones, yet seldom release their data or document design choices, hindering
reproducibility and raising the question of how to construct a transparent,
high-quality Thai corpus. We introduce Mangosteen: a 47 billion-token Thai
corpus built through a Thai-adapted Dolma pipeline that includes custom
rule-based language ID, revised C4/Gopher quality filters, and Thai-trained
content filters, plus curated non-web sources such as Wikipedia, Royal Gazette
texts, OCR-extracted books, and CC-licensed YouTube subtitles. Systematic
ablations using GPT-2 show the pipeline trims CommonCrawl from 202M to 25M
documents while raising SEA-HELM NLG from 3 to 11; an 8B-parameter SEA-LION
model continually pre-trained on Mangosteen then surpasses SEA-LION-v3 and
Llama-3.1 by about four points on Thai benchmarks. We release the full pipeline
code, cleaning manifests, corpus snapshot, and all checkpoints, providing a
fully reproducible foundation for future Thai and regional LLM research.

Method: 使用437个巴西葡萄牙语临床表达数据集，通过语义搜索引擎检索候选代码，33个LLMs选择最佳匹配ICPC-2代码，评估性能指标包括F1分数、成本等。

Result: 28个模型F1分数>0.8，10个>0.85。表现最佳模型包括gpt-4.5-preview等。检索优化可提升性能4分。小模型在格式和输入长度上表现较差。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动ICPC-2编码中表现出潜力，但需更广泛的多语言和端到端评估以验证临床适用性。

Abstract: Background: Medical coding structures healthcare data for research, quality
monitoring, and policy. This study assesses the potential of large language
models (LLMs) to assign ICPC-2 codes using the output of a domain-specific
search engine.
  Methods: A dataset of 437 Brazilian Portuguese clinical expressions, each
annotated with ICPC-2 codes, was used. A semantic search engine (OpenAI's
text-embedding-3-large) retrieved candidates from 73,563 labeled concepts.
Thirty-three LLMs were prompted with each query and retrieved results to select
the best-matching ICPC-2 code. Performance was evaluated using F1-score, along
with token usage, cost, response time, and format adherence.
  Results: Twenty-eight models achieved F1-score > 0.8; ten exceeded 0.85. Top
performers included gpt-4.5-preview, o3, and gemini-2.5-pro. Retriever
optimization can improve performance by up to 4 points. Most models returned
valid codes in the expected format, with reduced hallucinations. Smaller models
(<3B) struggled with formatting and input length.
  Conclusions: LLMs show strong potential for automating ICPC-2 coding, even
without fine-tuning. This work offers a benchmark and highlights challenges,
but findings are limited by dataset scope and setup. Broader, multilingual,
end-to-end evaluations are needed for clinical validation.

Motivation: 封闭源模型（如GPT-3）缺乏透明度和可复现性，而现有开源项目也常忽略关键资源。MiroMind-M1旨在推动RLM开发的透明度。

Method: 模型分两阶段训练：SFT阶段使用719K数学推理问题，RLVR阶段使用62K挑战性问题，并引入Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization算法。

Conclusion: MiroMind-M1系列为社区提供了完全透明的资源，支持进一步研究和推动领域发展。

Abstract: Large language models have recently evolved from fluent text generation to
advanced reasoning across diverse domains, giving rise to reasoning language
models. Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative
benchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which
can be generalized to other tasks. While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3
demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits
transparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to
close this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical
resources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders
reproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,
we introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on
the Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing
open-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a
carefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT
trajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To
enhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce
Context-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates
length-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage
context-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive
performance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B
and 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks. To facilitate
reproducibility, we release the complete stack: models (MiroMind-M1-SFT-7B,
MiroMind-M1-RL-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-32B); datasets (MiroMind-M1-SFT-719K,

quality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review
of publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub,
organized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question
Answering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation,
and Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., persona and system prompts); (3)
Alignment (e.g., cultural, safety, ethics, and fairness), and (4) Robustness.
Each dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption,
recency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing
transparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in
the development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task
diversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low
adoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of
these gaps on the progress of Arabic LLMs and applications while providing
concrete recommendations for future efforts in post-training dataset
development.

TL;DR: 研究构建了土耳其语自杀意念语料库，提出高效标注框架，并通过双向评估揭示现有模型在零样本迁移学习中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自杀意念检测中语言覆盖不足和标注不可靠的问题，推动全球AI自杀预防。

Method: 构建土耳其语语料库，引入三标注者和两大语言模型的标注框架，通过八种预训练分类器进行双向评估。

Result: 发现现有模型在零样本迁移学习中表现不佳，强调标注和模型可靠性的重要性。

Conclusion: 呼吁在心理健康NLP中采用更严谨、语言包容的标注和评估方法，提升数据和模型透明度。

Abstract: Suicidal ideation detection is critical for real-time suicide prevention, yet
its progress faces two under-explored challenges: limited language coverage and
unreliable annotation practices. Most available datasets are in English, but
even among these, high-quality, human-annotated data remains scarce. As a
result, many studies rely on available pre-labeled datasets without examining
their annotation process or label reliability. The lack of datasets in other
languages further limits the global realization of suicide prevention via
artificial intelligence (AI). In this study, we address one of these gaps by
constructing a novel Turkish suicidal ideation corpus derived from social media
posts and introducing a resource-efficient annotation framework involving three
human annotators and two large language models (LLMs). We then address the
remaining gaps by performing a bidirectional evaluation of label reliability
and model consistency across this dataset and three popular English suicidal
ideation detection datasets, using transfer learning through eight pre-trained
sentiment and emotion classifiers. These transformers help assess annotation
consistency and benchmark model performance against manually labeled data. Our
findings underscore the need for more rigorous, language-inclusive approaches
to annotation and evaluation in mental health natural language processing (NLP)
while demonstrating the questionable performance of popular models with
zero-shot transfer learning. We advocate for transparency in model training and
dataset construction in mental health NLP, prioritizing data and model
reliability.

TL;DR: 研究通过语言分析揭示同行评审中的隐性偏见，探讨评审语言如何因作者性别、种族和机构背景而异，并挑战匿名评审的公平性假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 同行评审虽被视为科学诚信的守门人，但其潜在的偏见问题日益凸显，尤其是语言使用中的不平等现象。

Method: 采用自然语言处理和大规模统计建模，分析8万多份评审的语言特征，包括语气、情感和支持性语言。

Result: 发现评审语言因作者背景不同而存在显著差异，匿名评审的公平性假设受到挑战。

Conclusion: 研究结果对学术出版改革提出重要问题，呼吁重新审视评审政策对职业发展和科学进步的影响。

Abstract: The peer review process is often regarded as the gatekeeper of scientific
integrity, yet increasing evidence suggests that it is not immune to bias.
Although structural inequities in peer review have been widely debated, much
less attention has been paid to the subtle ways in which language itself may
reinforce disparities. This study undertakes one of the most comprehensive
linguistic analyses of peer review to date, examining more than 80,000 reviews
in two major journals. Using natural language processing and large-scale
statistical modeling, it uncovers how review tone, sentiment, and supportive
language vary across author demographics, including gender, race, and
institutional affiliation. Using a data set that includes both anonymous and
signed reviews, this research also reveals how the disclosure of reviewer
identity shapes the language of evaluation. The findings not only expose hidden
biases in peer feedback, but also challenge conventional assumptions about
anonymity's role in fairness. As academic publishing grapples with reform,
these insights raise critical questions about how review policies shape career
trajectories and scientific progress.

TL;DR: 研究探讨机器学习如何模拟儿童语言习得，通过多模态神经网络训练验证其在不同儿童数据上的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型依赖海量数据与儿童语言习得能力之间的不匹配问题，验证多模态神经网络在小规模数据上的有效性。

Method: 利用SAYCam数据集（500小时视频数据）生成多模态训练和评估数据，测试不同神经网络配置的单词学习能力。

Result: 网络能从每个儿童的自动转录数据中学习并泛化单词-指代映射，验证了多模态神经网络的鲁棒性，同时揭示了不同儿童数据带来的个体差异。

Conclusion: 多模态神经网络在小规模数据上表现出鲁棒性，但个体差异影响学习模式，为儿童语言习得研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: What insights can machine learning bring to understanding human language
acquisition? Large language and multimodal models have achieved remarkable
capabilities, but their reliance on massive training datasets creates a
fundamental mismatch with children, who succeed in acquiring language from
comparatively limited input. To help bridge this gap, researchers have
increasingly trained neural networks using data similar in quantity and quality
to children's input. Taking this approach to the limit, Vong et al. (2024)
showed that a multimodal neural network trained on 61 hours of visual and
linguistic input extracted from just one child's developmental experience could
acquire word-referent mappings. However, whether this approach's success
reflects the idiosyncrasies of a single child's experience, or whether it would
show consistent and robust learning patterns across multiple children's
experiences was not explored. In this article, we applied automated speech
transcription methods to the entirety of the SAYCam dataset, consisting of over
500 hours of video data spread across all three children. Using these automated
transcriptions, we generated multi-modal vision-and-language datasets for both
training and evaluation, and explored a range of neural network configurations
to examine the robustness of simulated word learning. Our findings demonstrate
that networks trained on automatically transcribed data from each child can
acquire and generalize word-referent mappings across multiple network
architectures. These results validate the robustness of multimodal neural
networks for grounded word learning, while highlighting the individual
differences that emerge in how models learn when trained on each child's
developmental experiences.

TL;DR: GRACE是一种新型生成式多行为序列推荐框架，通过引入混合Chain-of-Thought（CoT）标记化和旅程感知稀疏注意力（JSA）机制，解决了现有生成模型在标记推理、计算效率和多尺度建模方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在多行为推荐系统中存在标记推理信息不足、计算成本高和多尺度建模能力有限的问题。

Method: GRACE采用混合CoT标记化方法，结合产品知识图谱属性，并设计JSA机制选择性关注标记序列的不同部分。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上，GRACE显著优于现有基线，HR@10和NDCG@10提升最高达106.9%和106.7%，同时减少48%的计算开销。

Conclusion: GRACE通过改进标记化和注意力机制，在多行为推荐中实现了高效且性能优异的生成式推荐。

Abstract: Generative models have recently demonstrated strong potential in
multi-behavior recommendation systems, leveraging the expressive power of
transformers and tokenization to generate personalized item sequences. However,
their adoption is hindered by (1) the lack of explicit information for token
reasoning, (2) high computational costs due to quadratic attention complexity
and dense sequence representations after tokenization, and (3) limited
multi-scale modeling over user history. In this work, we propose GRACE
(Generative Recommendation via journey-aware sparse Attention on
Chain-of-thought tokEnization), a novel generative framework for multi-behavior
sequential recommendation. GRACE introduces a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
tokenization method that encodes user-item interactions with explicit
attributes from product knowledge graphs (e.g., category, brand, price) over
semantic tokenization, enabling interpretable and behavior-aligned generation.
To address the inefficiency of standard attention, we design a Journey-Aware
Sparse Attention (JSA) mechanism, which selectively attends to compressed,
intra-, inter-, and current-context segments in the tokenized sequence.
Experiments on two real-world datasets show that GRACE significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to +106.9% HR@10 and
+106.7% NDCG@10 improvement over the state-of-the-art baseline on the Home
domain, and +22.1% HR@10 on the Electronics domain. GRACE also reduces
attention computation by up to 48% with long sequences.

TL;DR: FastLongSpeech是一种新框架，旨在扩展大型语音语言模型（LSLM）的能力，以高效处理长语音任务，无需依赖长语音训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LSLM主要关注短语音任务或语音生成，而长语音处理因数据稀缺和高计算成本成为未充分探索的挑战。

Method: FastLongSpeech采用迭代融合策略压缩长语音序列，并通过动态压缩训练方法使模型适应不同压缩比的短语音序列。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在长语音和短语音任务中均表现优异，同时显著提升推理效率。

Conclusion: FastLongSpeech为LSLM的长语音处理提供了高效解决方案，填补了现有研究的空白。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred significant
progress in Large Speech-Language Models (LSLMs), enhancing their capabilities
in both speech understanding and generation. While existing LSLMs often
concentrate on augmenting speech generation or tackling a diverse array of
short-speech tasks, the efficient processing of long-form speech remains a
critical yet underexplored challenge. This gap is primarily attributed to the
scarcity of long-speech training datasets and the high computational costs
associated with long sequences. To address these limitations, we introduce
FastLongSpeech, a novel framework designed to extend LSLM capabilities for
efficient long-speech processing without necessitating dedicated long-speech
training data. FastLongSpeech incorporates an iterative fusion strategy that
can compress excessively long-speech sequences into manageable lengths. To
adapt LSLMs for long-speech inputs, it introduces a dynamic compression
training approach, which exposes the model to short-speech sequences at varying
compression ratios, thereby transferring the capabilities of LSLMs to
long-speech tasks. To assess the long-speech capabilities of LSLMs, we develop
a long-speech understanding benchmark called LongSpeech-Eval. Experiments show
that our method exhibits strong performance in both long-speech and
short-speech tasks, while greatly improving inference efficiency.

Conclusion: 提出的无监督框架和评估指标有效解决了意图驱动的文档图表生成问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
transforming text descriptions or tables to data visualizations via
instruction-tuning methods. However, it is not straightforward to apply these
methods directly for a more real-world use case of visualizing data from long
documents based on user-given intents, as opposed to the user pre-selecting the
relevant content manually. We introduce the task of intent-based chart
generation from documents: given a user-specified intent and document(s), the
goal is to generate a chart adhering to the intent and grounded on the
document(s) in a zero-shot setting. We propose an unsupervised, two-staged
framework in which an LLM first extracts relevant information from the
document(s) by decomposing the intent and iteratively validates and refines
this data. Next, a heuristic-guided module selects an appropriate chart type
before final code generation. To assess the data accuracy of the generated
charts, we propose an attribution-based metric that uses a structured textual
representation of charts, instead of relying on visual decoding metrics that
often fail to capture the chart data effectively. To validate our approach, we
curate a dataset comprising of 1,242 $<$intent, document, charts$>$ tuples from
two domains, finance and scientific, in contrast to the existing datasets that
are largely limited to parallel text descriptions/ tables and their
corresponding charts. We compare our approach with baselines using single-shot
chart generation using LLMs and query-based retrieval methods; our method
outperforms by upto $9$ points and $17$ points in terms of chart data accuracy
and chart type respectively over the best baselines.

Result: 蒸馏显著提升长上下文理解，促进更详细的推理过程。

Conclusion: 推理蒸馏有效解决长上下文模型中的“中间迷失”问题。

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has emerged as an effective approach to enhance the
reasoning capabilities of smaller language models. However, the impact of
large-scale reasoning distillation on other critical abilities, particularly
in-context retrieval and reasoning, remains unexplored. This gap in
understanding is particularly significant given the increasing importance of
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where efficient acquisition and
utilization of contextual information are paramount for generating reliable
responses. Motivated by the need to understand how the extended long-CoT
process influences long-context comprehension, we conduct a comprehensive
investigation using a series of open-source models distilled from Deepseek-R1,
renowned for its exceptional reasoning capabilities. Our study focuses on
evaluating these models' performance in extracting and integrating relevant
information from extended contexts through multi-document question and
answering tasks. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that
distilled reasoning patterns significantly improve long-context understanding.
Our analysis reveals that distillation fosters greater long-context awareness
by promoting more detailed and explicit reasoning processes during context
analysis and information parsing. This advancement effectively mitigates the
persistent "lost in the middle" issue that has hindered long-context models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型（LLMs）预训练需要巨大计算资源，限制了广泛研究参与，因此探索更易获取的小型语言模型（TLMs）是否具备类似特性。

Method: 通过预训练BERT-6及其变体，并在FewRel、AGNews和DBPedia分类任务上评估性能，研究TLMs的表现。

Result: 预训练的TLMs在分类任务中表现优于未预训练模型，且性能差距随预训练数据量和任务重叠度增加而扩大。

Conclusion: TLMs在预训练后表现出与LLMs类似的关键特性，未来研究可能揭示其与人类语言学习的相似机制。

Abstract: A prominent achievement of natural language processing (NLP) is its ability
to understand and generate meaningful human language. This capability relies on
complex feedforward transformer block architectures pre-trained on large
language models (LLMs). However, LLM pre-training is currently feasible only
for a few dominant companies due to the immense computational resources
required, limiting broader research participation. This creates a critical need
for more accessible alternatives. In this study, we explore whether tiny
language models (TLMs) exhibit the same key qualitative features of LLMs. We
demonstrate that TLMs exhibit a clear performance gap between pre-trained and
non-pre-trained models across classification tasks, indicating the
effectiveness of pre-training, even at a tiny scale. The performance gap
increases with the size of the pre-training dataset and with greater overlap
between tokens in the pre-training and classification datasets. Furthermore,
the classification accuracy achieved by a pre-trained deep TLM architecture can
be replicated through a soft committee of multiple, independently pre-trained
shallow architectures, enabling low-latency TLMs without affecting
classification accuracy. Our results are based on pre-training BERT-6 and
variants of BERT-1 on subsets of the Wikipedia dataset and evaluating their
performance on FewRel, AGNews, and DBPedia classification tasks. Future
research on TLM is expected to further illuminate the mechanisms underlying
NLP, especially given that its biologically inspired models suggest that TLMs
may be sufficient for children or adolescents to develop language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在情感-原因对提取任务中表现不佳，主要原因是缺乏辅助知识，限制了其情感感知和原因推理能力。

Method: 提出MEKiT方法，整合内部情感知识和外部因果知识，通过指令模板和数据混合进行指令微调。

Result: 实验表明MEKiT在情感-原因对提取任务上优于基线方法，显著提升大语言模型性能。

Conclusion: MEKiT为情感-原因对提取任务提供了更有效和适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) excel in text comprehension and
generation, their performance on the Emotion-Cause Pair Extraction (ECPE) task,
which requires reasoning ability, is often underperform smaller language model.
The main reason is the lack of auxiliary knowledge, which limits LLMs' ability
to effectively perceive emotions and reason causes. To address this issue, we
propose a novel \textbf{M}ulti-source h\textbf{E}terogeneous \textbf{K}nowledge
\textbf{i}njection me\textbf{T}hod, MEKiT, which integrates heterogeneous
internal emotional knowledge and external causal knowledge. Specifically, for
these two distinct aspects and structures of knowledge, we apply the approaches
of incorporating instruction templates and mixing data for instruction-tuning,
which respectively facilitate LLMs in more comprehensively identifying emotion
and accurately reasoning causes. Experimental results demonstrate that MEKiT
provides a more effective and adaptable solution for the ECPE task, exhibiting
an absolute performance advantage over compared baselines and dramatically
improving the performance of LLMs on the ECPE task.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在多语言任务中表现优异，但存在意外代码切换问题，影响模型输出的可读性和实用性。现有方法缺乏机制分析且效果有限。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分析代码切换现象，发现语言特征预激活值异常。提出SASFT方法，通过监督微调调整预激活值。

Result: 在五种模型和三种语言上的实验表明，SASFT将意外代码切换减少50%以上，部分情况下完全消除，同时保持或提升多语言任务性能。

Conclusion: SASFT有效解决了代码切换问题，同时保留了LLMs的多语言能力，为模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive multilingual capabilities, but
they suffer from unexpected code-switching, also known as language mixing,
which involves switching to unexpected languages in the model response. This
problem leads to poor readability and degrades the usability of model
responses. However, existing work on this issue lacks a mechanistic analysis
and shows limited effectiveness. In this paper, we first provide an in-depth
analysis of unexpected code-switching using sparse autoencoders and find that
when LLMs switch to a language, the features of that language exhibit excessive
pre-activation values. Based on our findings, we propose $\textbf{S}$parse
$\textbf{A}$utoencoder-guided $\textbf{S}$upervised
$\textbf{F}$ine$\textbf{t}$uning (SASFT), which teaches LLMs to maintain
appropriate pre-activation values of specific language features during
training. Experiments on five models across three languages demonstrate that
SASFT consistently reduces unexpected code-switching by more than 50\% compared
to standard supervised fine-tuning, with complete elimination in four cases.
Moreover, SASFT maintains or even improves the models' performance on six
multilingual benchmarks, showing its effectiveness in addressing code-switching
while preserving multilingual capabilities.

Method: 提出NeuronXA方法，基于神经元状态评估跨语言对齐能力，并在多个多语言LLM上进行测试。

Result: 仅用100对平行句子，NeuronXA与下游任务性能的Pearson相关性达0.9556，与可迁移性的相关性为0.8514。

Conclusion: NeuronXA能有效评估跨语言对齐和可迁移性，有望推动跨语言对齐研究并提升多语言LLM的语义理解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multilingual
capabilities, however, how to evaluate cross-lingual alignment remains
underexplored. Existing alignment benchmarks primarily focus on sentence
embeddings, but prior research has shown that neural models tend to induce a
non-smooth representation space, which impact of semantic alignment evaluation
on low-resource languages. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that similar
information activates overlapping neuronal regions, we propose a novel Neuron
State-Based Cross-Lingual Alignment (NeuronXA) to assess the cross-lingual a
lignment capabilities of LLMs, which offers a more semantically grounded
approach to assess cross-lingual alignment. We evaluate NeuronXA on several
prominent multilingual LLMs (LLaMA, Qwen, Mistral, GLM, and OLMo) across two
transfer tasks and three multilingual benchmarks. The results demonstrate that
with only 100 parallel sentence pairs, NeuronXA achieves a Pearson correlation
of 0.9556 with downstream tasks performance and 0.8514 with transferability.
These findings demonstrate NeuronXA's effectiveness in assessing both
cross-lingual alignment and transferability, even with a small dataset. This
highlights its potential to advance cross-lingual alignment research and to
improve the semantic understanding of multilingual LLMs.

Motivation: 优化大型语言模型（LLMs）在推理任务中的效率，避免冗余计算导致的资源浪费。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MUR平均减少50%以上计算量，准确性提升0.62-3.37%。

Conclusion: MUR方法有效提升了LLM的推理效率和准确性，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on
reasoning-intensive tasks, yet optimizing their reasoning efficiency remains an
open challenge. While Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves reasoning quality, it
often leads to overthinking, wasting tokens on redundant computations. This
work investigates how to efficiently and adaptively guide LLM test-time scaling
without additional training. Inspired by the concept of momentum in physics, we
propose Momentum Uncertainty-guided Reasoning (MUR), which dynamically
allocates thinking budgets to critical reasoning steps by tracking and
aggregating stepwise uncertainty over time. To support flexible inference-time
control, we introduce gamma-control, a simple mechanism that tunes the
reasoning budget via a single hyperparameter. We provide in-depth theoretical
proof to support the superiority of MUR in terms of stability and biases. MUR
is comprehensively evaluated against various TTS methods across four
challenging benchmarks (MATH-500, AIME24, AIME25, and GPQA-diamond) using
different sizes of recent Qwen3 models (1.7B, 4B, and 8B). Results demonstrate
that MUR reduces computation by over 50% on average while improving accuracy by

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督微调方法无法真正提升模型的批评能力，导致反馈浅薄且缺乏验证。

Method: 提出RefCritic，采用长链思维和双重规则奖励（实例级判断正确性和策略模型改进准确性）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如AIME25上分别提升6.8%和7.2%。

Conclusion: RefCritic在批评和模型改进方面具有显著优势，优于现有方法。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), developing
effective critic modules for precise guidance has become crucial yet
challenging. In this paper, we initially demonstrate that supervised
fine-tuning for building critic modules (which is widely adopted in current
solutions) fails to genuinely enhance models' critique abilities, producing
superficial critiques with insufficient reflections and verifications. To
unlock the unprecedented critique capabilities, we propose RefCritic, a
long-chain-of-thought critic module based on reinforcement learning with dual
rule-based rewards: (1) instance-level correctness of solution judgments and
(2) refinement accuracies of the policy model based on critiques, aiming to
generate high-quality evaluations with actionable feedback that effectively
guides model refinement. We evaluate RefCritic on Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B across five benchmarks. On critique and refinement
settings, RefCritic demonstrates consistent advantages across all benchmarks,
e.g., 6.8\% and 7.2\% gains on AIME25 for the respective base models. Notably,
under majority voting, policy models filtered by RefCritic show superior
scaling with increased voting numbers. Moreover, despite training on
solution-level supervision, RefCritic outperforms step-level supervised
approaches on ProcessBench, a benchmark to identify erroneous steps in
mathematical reasoning.

Motivation: 高质量训练数据的稀缺限制了信息搜索代理的发展，现有方法可能导致信息结构与推理结构不一致。

Method: 提出WebShaper框架，利用集合论形式化IS任务，通过知识投影（KP）控制推理结构，采用多步扩展过程合成数据集。

Result: 在GAIA和WebWalkerQA基准测试中，WebShaper表现优于其他开源IS代理。

Conclusion: WebShaper通过形式化驱动的方法有效解决了IS任务中的数据问题，并取得了先进性能。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered agents has revolutionized
artificial intelligence by enabling solutions to complex, open-ended tasks
through web-based information-seeking (IS) capabilities. The scarcity of
high-quality training data has limited the development of IS agents. Existing
approaches typically adopt an information-driven paradigm that first collects
web data and then generates questions based on the retrieval. However, this may
lead to inconsistency between information structure and reasoning structure,
question and answer. To mitigate, we propose a formalization-driven IS data
synthesis framework WebShaper to construct a dataset. WebShaper systematically
formalizes IS tasks through set theory. Central to the formalization is the
concept of Knowledge Projections (KP), which enables precise control over
reasoning structure by KP operation compositions. During synthesis, we begin by
creating seed tasks, then use a multi-step expansion process. At each step, an
agentic Expander expands the current formal question more complex with
retrieval and validation tools based on our formalization. We train our model
on the synthesized dataset. Experiment results demonstrate that WebShaper
achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-sourced IS agents on GAIA and
WebWalkerQA benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文比较了DNA序列建模中的k-mer分割和BPE子词标记化方法，以及三种位置编码方法（sinusoidal、AliBi、RoPE），发现BPE表现更优，RoPE适合周期性模式，AliBi适合局部依赖任务。模型深度在12层时效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对DNA序列建模中不同标记化方法和位置编码方法的系统评估，因此需要比较这些方法的性能。

Method: 比较了k-mer分割（k=1,3,4,5,6）、BPE子词标记化（4,096词表）和三种位置编码方法，在不同层数（3,6,12,24）的Transformer编码器上进行训练和评估。

Result: BPE表现更优，RoPE适合周期性模式，AliBi适合局部依赖任务；模型深度在12层时效果最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为DNA Transformer模型中的标记化和位置编码设计提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Currently, many studies view DNA sequences as a special type of language and
utilize Transformers to model them. These studies use fixed-length k-mer
segmentation and BPE subword tokenization but lack a systematic evaluation to
determine which is superior. We compare k-mer segmentation with k=1,3,4,5,6, a
4,096-token BPE vocabulary, and three positional encoding methods-sinusoidal,
AliBi, and RoPE. Each configuration is trained from scratch in 3, 6, 12, and
24-layer Transformer encoders and evaluated on GUE benchmark dataset. In
general, BPE delivers higher and more stable performance across tasks by
compressing frequent motifs into variable-length tokens, reducing sequence
length, and improving model generalization. RoPE excels at capturing periodic
motifs and extrapolating to long sequences, while AliBi also performs well on
tasks driven by local dependencies. In terms of depth, we observe significant
gains when increasing layers from 3 to 12, with only marginal improvements or
slight overfitting at 24 layers. This study provides practical guidance for
designing tokenization and positional encoding in DNA Transformer models.

Motivation: 研究提示变化对生成文本长度及词汇多样性测量的影响，现有方法存在对短文本的偏好偏差。

Method: 提出PATTR度量方法，生成20M词的合成语料库，比较PATTR与MATTR、CR的性能。

Result: PATTR能有效减少长度偏差，在筛选高多样性文本时表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PATTR是一种更稳健的多样性度量工具，适用于需要控制文本长度的任务。

Abstract: Synthetic text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly used
for further training and improvement of LLMs. Diversity is crucial for the
effectiveness of synthetic data, and researchers rely on prompt engineering to
improve diversity. However, the impact of prompt variations on response text
length, and, more importantly, the consequential effect on lexical diversity
measurements, remain underexplored. In this work, we propose Penalty-Adjusted
Type-Token Ratio (PATTR), a diversity metric robust to length variations. We
generate a large synthetic corpus of over 20M words using seven models from the
LLaMA, OLMo, and Phi families, focusing on a creative writing task of video
script generation, where diversity is crucial. We evaluate per-response lexical
diversity using PATTR and compare it against existing metrics of Moving-Average
TTR (MATTR) and Compression Ratio (CR). Our analysis highlights how text length
variations introduce biases favoring shorter responses. Unlike existing
metrics, PATTR explicitly considers the task-specific target response length
($L_T$) to effectively mitigate length biases. We further demonstrate the
utility of PATTR in filtering the top-10/100/1,000 most lexically diverse
responses, showing that it consistently outperforms MATTR and CR by yielding on
par or better diversity with high adherence to $L_T$.

Motivation: 现有常识资源对多样化的前提-假设对覆盖不足，需要探索LLM是否能补充这一不足。

Method: 调整和修改现有指标，评估LLM生成知识的真实性和一致性。

Result: 显式引入常识知识未显著提升整体结果，但能有效区分蕴含实例，并适度改善矛盾和中立推理的区分。

Conclusion: LLM生成的常识知识在特定NLI任务中有潜力，但需进一步优化以提高整体效果。

Abstract: Natural Language Inference (NLI) is the task of determining the semantic
entailment of a premise for a given hypothesis. The task aims to develop
systems that emulate natural human inferential processes where commonsense
knowledge plays a major role. However, existing commonsense resources lack
sufficient coverage for a variety of premise-hypothesis pairs. This study
explores the potential of Large Language Models as commonsense knowledge
generators for NLI along two key dimensions: their reliability in generating
such knowledge and the impact of that knowledge on prediction accuracy. We
adapt and modify existing metrics to assess LLM factuality and consistency in
generating in this context. While explicitly incorporating commonsense
knowledge does not consistently improve overall results, it effectively helps
distinguish entailing instances and moderately improves distinguishing
contradictory and neutral inferences.

Motivation: 探讨NLI中标注分歧的根源，强调歧义作为解释性差异的信号，而非单纯噪声。

Method: 提出统一框架整合歧义分类法，通过具体示例展示歧义如何影响标注决策，并呼吁开发针对性检测方法。

Result: 揭示歧义对标注决策的影响，指出缺乏歧义标注数据集的局限性。

Conclusion: 建议通过新标注资源和无监督方法填补数据缺口，推动更鲁棒、可解释且与人类对齐的NLI系统。

Abstract: This position paper argues that annotation disagreement in Natural Language
Inference (NLI) is not mere noise but often reflects meaningful interpretive
variation, especially when triggered by ambiguity in the premise or hypothesis.
While underspecified guidelines and annotator behavior can contribute to
variation, content-based ambiguity offers a process-independent signal of
divergent human perspectives. We call for a shift toward ambiguity-aware NLI by
systematically identifying ambiguous input pairs and classifying ambiguity
types. To support this, we present a unified framework that integrates existing
taxonomies and illustrate key ambiguity subtypes through concrete examples.
These examples reveal how ambiguity shapes annotator decisions and motivate the
need for targeted detection methods that better align models with human
interpretation. A key limitation is the lack of datasets annotated for
ambiguity and subtypes. We propose addressing this gap through new annotated
resources and unsupervised approaches to ambiguity detection -- paving the way
for more robust, explainable, and human-aligned NLI systems.

Motivation: 研究同音字归一化对模型性能的影响，特别是在跨语言迁移中可能导致的泛化能力下降问题。

Method: 通过单语训练和跨语言迁移实验，提出后推断归一化方案，即在模型预测后应用归一化。

Result: 后推断归一化使BLEU分数提升高达1.03，同时保留训练中的语言特征。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁更多语言感知的干预措施，并贡献于技术驱动的语言变化讨论。

Abstract: Homophone normalization, where characters that have the same sound in a
writing script are mapped to one character, is a pre-processing step applied in
Amharic Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature. While this may improve
performance reported by automatic metrics, it also results in models that are
not able to understand different forms of writing in a single language.
Further, there might be impacts in transfer learning, where models trained on
normalized data do not generalize well to other languages. In this paper, we
experiment with monolingual training and cross-lingual transfer to understand
the impacts of normalization on languages that use the Ge'ez script. We then
propose a post-inference intervention in which normalization is applied to
model predictions instead of training data. With our simple scheme of
post-inference normalization, we show that we can achieve an increase in BLEU
score of up to 1.03 while preserving language features in training. Our work
contributes to the broader discussion on technology-facilitated language change
and calls for more language-aware interventions.

Conclusion: 提出三层指南，平衡LLM效率与专家监督，优化自动化数据提取。

Abstract: Automating data extraction from full-text randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
for meta-analysis remains a significant challenge. This study evaluates the
practical performance of three LLMs (Gemini-2.0-flash, Grok-3, GPT-4o-mini)
across tasks involving statistical results, risk-of-bias assessments, and
study-level characteristics in three medical domains: hypertension, diabetes,
and orthopaedics. We tested four distinct prompting strategies (basic
prompting, self-reflective prompting, model ensemble, and customised prompts)
to determine how to improve extraction quality. All models demonstrate high
precision but consistently suffer from poor recall by omitting key information.
We found that customised prompts were the most effective, boosting recall by up
to 15\%. Based on this analysis, we propose a three-tiered set of guidelines
for using LLMs in data extraction, matching data types to appropriate levels of
automation based on task complexity and risk. Our study offers practical advice
for automating data extraction in real-world meta-analyses, balancing LLM
efficiency with expert oversight through targeted, task-specific automation.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型部署时的高计算成本和推理速度慢的问题。

Method: 采用加权输出融合机制、特征对齐损失函数和熵驱动的动态教师权重策略，优化知识蒸馏过程。

Result: 学生模型在多任务评估中表现优异，尤其在困惑度、蒸馏损失和生成质量上优于其他蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 多教师协作机制为大规模语言模型的高效压缩提供了可行技术路径，并在复杂语言建模任务中表现出有效性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of high computational cost and slow
inference in deploying large language models. It proposes a distillation
strategy guided by multiple teacher models. The method constructs several
teacher models and integrates their output probability distributions and
intermediate semantic features. This guides the student model to learn from
multiple sources of knowledge. As a result, the student model gains stronger
language understanding and generation ability while maintaining a small
parameter size. To achieve this, the paper introduces a weighted output fusion
mechanism, a feature alignment loss function, and an entropy-driven dynamic
teacher weighting strategy. These components improve the quality and stability
of knowledge transfer during distillation. Under multi-teacher guidance, the
student model captures semantic information more effectively and demonstrates
strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. In particular, the
method shows high consistency in expression, generalization ability, and task
adaptability in tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and
multi-task learning. The experiments compare the proposed method with several
widely adopted distillation approaches. The results further confirm its overall
advantages in perplexity, distillation loss, and generation quality. This study
provides a feasible technical path for the efficient compression of large-scale
language models. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-teacher
collaborative mechanisms in complex language modeling tasks.

Abstract: This work investigates the impact of multi-task, multi-lingual, and
multi-source learning approaches on the robustness and performance of
pretrained language models. To enhance this analysis, we introduce Subsets of
Interest (SOI), a novel categorization framework that identifies six distinct
learning behavior patterns during training, including forgettable examples,
unlearned examples, and always correct examples. Through SOI transition
heatmaps and dataset cartography visualization, we analyze how examples shift
between these categories when transitioning from single-setting to
multi-setting configurations. We perform comprehensive experiments across three
parallel comparisons: multi-task vs. single-task learning using English tasks
(entailment, paraphrase, sentiment), multi-source vs. single-source learning
using sentiment analysis datasets, and multi-lingual vs. single-lingual
learning using intent classification in French, English, and Persian. Our
results demonstrate that multi-source learning consistently improves
out-of-distribution performance by up to 7%, while multi-task learning shows
mixed results with notable gains in similar task combinations. We further
introduce a two-stage fine-tuning approach where the second stage leverages
SOI-based subset selection to achieve additional performance improvements.
These findings provide new insights into training dynamics and offer practical
approaches for optimizing multi-setting language model performance.

Conclusion: ChiMed 2.0为中文医学LLM训练提供了高质量资源，推动了AI在医学领域的应用。

Abstract: Building high-quality data resources is crucial for advancing artificial
intelligence research and applications in specific domains, particularly in the
Chinese medical domain. Existing Chinese medical datasets are limited in size
and narrow in domain coverage, falling short of the diverse corpora required
for effective pre-training. Moreover, most datasets are designed solely for LLM
fine-tuning and do not support pre-training and reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF). In this paper, we propose a Chinese medical dataset
named ChiMed 2.0, which extends our previous work ChiMed, and covers data
collected from Chinese medical online platforms and generated by LLMs. ChiMed
2.0 contains 204.4M Chinese characters covering both traditional Chinese
medicine classics and modern general medical data, where there are 164.8K
documents for pre-training, 351.6K question-answering pairs for supervised
fine-tuning (SFT), and 41.7K preference data tuples for RLHF. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach for training a Chinese medical LLM, we conduct
further pre-training, SFT, and RLHF experiments on representative general
domain LLMs and evaluate their performance on medical benchmark datasets. The
results show performance gains across different model scales, validating the
dataset's effectiveness and applicability.

Method: DPSE框架引入Censor模块提取多维交互信号并估计满意度分数，通过主题感知和偏好驱动的策略扩展结构化数据，支持两阶段微调流程。

Result: 实验表明，DPSE在通用NLP基准和长期对话任务中均优于监督微调、偏好优化和记忆增强基线。

Conclusion: DPSE为LLM的持续自进化提供了一条自主路径。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited to some extent
by pre-training, so some researchers optimize LLMs through post-training.
Existing post-training strategies, such as memory-based retrieval or preference
optimization, improve user alignment yet fail to enhance the model's domain
cognition. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Dual-Phase Self-Evolution
(DPSE) framework that jointly optimizes user preference adaptation and
domain-specific competence. DPSE introduces a Censor module to extract
multi-dimensional interaction signals and estimate satisfaction scores, which
guide structured data expansion via topic-aware and preference-driven
strategies. These expanded datasets support a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline:
supervised domain grounding followed by frequency-aware preference
optimization. Experiments across general NLP benchmarks and long-term dialogue
tasks demonstrate that DPSE consistently outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning,
Preference Optimization, and Memory-Augmented baselines. Ablation studies
validate the contribution of each module. In this way, our framework provides
an autonomous path toward continual self-evolution of LLMs.

Result: 新方法有效挑战了当前零样本检测方法的性能，提升了检测器的实际适用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD为AI文本检测器的实际部署提供了更全面的评估标准。

Abstract: We present a novel evaluation paradigm for AI text detectors that prioritizes
real-world and equitable assessment. Current approaches predominantly report
conventional metrics like AUROC, overlooking that even modest false positive
rates constitute a critical impediment to practical deployment of detection
systems. Furthermore, real-world deployment necessitates predetermined
threshold configuration, making detector stability (i.e. the maintenance of
consistent performance across diverse domains and adversarial scenarios), a
critical factor. These aspects have been largely ignored in previous research
and benchmarks. Our benchmark, SHIELD, addresses these limitations by
integrating both reliability and stability factors into a unified evaluation
metric designed for practical assessment. Furthermore, we develop a post-hoc,
model-agnostic humanification framework that modifies AI text to more closely
resemble human authorship, incorporating a controllable hardness parameter.
This hardness-aware approach effectively challenges current SOTA zero-shot
detection methods in maintaining both reliability and stability. (Data and

Conclusion: 结论指出，AI对齐目标与左翼偏见不可分割，批评现有研究反对对齐原则的倾向。

Abstract: The guiding principle of AI alignment is to train large language models
(LLMs) to be harmless, helpful, and honest (HHH). At the same time, there are
mounting concerns that LLMs exhibit a left-wing political bias. Yet, the
commitment to AI alignment cannot be harmonized with the latter critique. In
this article, I argue that intelligent systems that are trained to be harmless
and honest must necessarily exhibit left-wing political bias. Normative
assumptions underlying alignment objectives inherently concur with progressive
moral frameworks and left-wing principles, emphasizing harm avoidance,
inclusivity, fairness, and empirical truthfulness. Conversely, right-wing
ideologies often conflict with alignment guidelines. Yet, research on political
bias in LLMs is consistently framing its insights about left-leaning tendencies
as a risk, as problematic, or concerning. This way, researchers are actively
arguing against AI alignment, tacitly fostering the violation of HHH
principles.

Result: MCQA在允许链式推理的模型中表现良好，但对于能利用选项信息的模型，MCQA不再适用。

Conclusion: MCQA不再适合评估最先进模型的下游性能，需设计更鲁棒的基准以减少偏差。

Abstract: When evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) in question-answering domains,
it is common to ask the model to choose among a fixed set of choices (so-called
multiple-choice question-answering, or MCQA). Although downstream tasks of
interest typically do not provide systems with explicit options among which to
choose, this approach is nevertheless widely used because it makes it makes
automatic grading straightforward and has tended to produce challenging
benchmarks that correlate sufficiently well with downstream performance. This
paper investigates the extent to which this trend continues to hold for
state-of-the-art reasoning models, describing a systematic evaluation of $15$
different question-answering benchmarks (e.g., MMLU, HLE) and $25$ different
LLMs (including small models such as Qwen 7B and relatively large models such
as Llama 70B). For each model-benchmark pair, we considered $5$ ways of
presenting the model with questions, including variations on whether multiple
choices were offered to the model at all; whether "none of the above" sometimes
replaced the right answer; and whether the model was permitted to perform
chain-of-thought reasoning before and/or after the choices were presented. MCQA
remained a good proxy for the downstream performance of models as long as they
were allowed to perform chain-of-thought reasoning only before being presented
with the options among which they had to select. On the other hand, large
models that were able to perform reasoning after being given a set of options
tended to significantly outperform their free-text performance due to
exploiting the information in the options. We conclude that MCQA is no longer a
good proxy for assessing downstream performance of state-of-the-art models, and
offer practical guidelines for designing more robust, bias-resistant benchmarks
that better reflect LLMs' genuine reasoning capabilities.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代审核系统在多语言支持上存在本地化和低资源变体的不足，导致实际部署中的安全漏洞。小型模型可作为大型LLM的替代方案，但仍需大量数据和计算资源。

Method: 基于预训练的OpenAI嵌入和多头序数分类器构建，无需微调大型模型。

Result: 在17个基准测试中表现优异，包括新加坡特定和公共英语数据集，并已在新加坡政府中实际部署。

Conclusion: 高质量本地数据和强大多语言嵌入可实现强审核性能，无需依赖大型模型。模型权重和部分训练数据已公开，以支持未来LLM安全研究。

Abstract: Modern moderation systems increasingly support multiple languages, but often
fail to address localisation and low-resource variants - creating safety gaps
in real-world deployments. Small models offer a potential alternative to large
LLMs, yet still demand considerable data and compute. We present LionGuard 2, a
lightweight, multilingual moderation classifier tailored to the Singapore
context, supporting English, Chinese, Malay, and partial Tamil. Built on
pre-trained OpenAI embeddings and a multi-head ordinal classifier, LionGuard 2
outperforms several commercial and open-source systems across 17 benchmarks,
including both Singapore-specific and public English datasets. The system is
actively deployed within the Singapore Government, demonstrating practical
efficacy at scale. Our findings show that high-quality local data and robust
multilingual embeddings can achieve strong moderation performance, without
fine-tuning large models. We release our model weights and part of our training
data to support future work on LLM safety.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in metaphor interpretation across multiple datasets,
tasks, and prompt configurations. Although metaphor processing has gained
significant attention in Natural Language Processing (NLP), previous research
has been limited to single-dataset evaluations and specific task settings,
often using artificially constructed data through lexical replacement. We
address these limitations by conducting extensive experiments using diverse
publicly available datasets with inference and metaphor annotations, focusing
on Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Question Answering (QA) tasks. The
results indicate that LLMs' performance is more influenced by features like
lexical overlap and sentence length than by metaphorical content, demonstrating
that any alleged emergent abilities of LLMs to understand metaphorical language
are the result of a combination of surface-level features, in-context learning,
and linguistic knowledge. This work provides critical insights into the current
capabilities and limitations of LLMs in processing figurative language,
highlighting the need for more realistic evaluation frameworks in metaphor
interpretation tasks. Data and code are publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Stitch的新方法，通过在生成语音响应时交替生成未说出的推理块，实现了SLMs的同时思考和说话，显著降低了延迟并提升了推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的口语语言模型（SLMs）缺乏内部未说出的思考过程，而人类通常通过复杂的内部推理清晰表达想法。因此，为SLMs集成这种能力是必要的。

Method: 提出Stitch方法，交替生成未说出的推理块和语音响应块，利用语音播放时间生成推理内容，实现同时思考和说话。

Result: Stitch在数学推理数据集上比基线模型性能提升15%，在非推理数据集上表现相当，同时保持了低延迟。

Conclusion: Stitch方法成功实现了SLMs的同时思考和说话，显著提升了模型的推理能力且未增加延迟。

Abstract: Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are designed to take speech inputs and produce
spoken responses. However, current SLMs lack the ability to perform an
internal, unspoken thinking process before responding. In contrast, humans
typically engage in complex mental reasoning internally, enabling them to
communicate ideas clearly and concisely. Thus, integrating an unspoken thought
process into SLMs is highly desirable. While naively generating a complete
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before starting to talk can enable thinking
for SLMs, this induces additional latency for the speech response, as the CoT
reasoning can be arbitrarily long. To solve this issue, we propose Stitch, a
novel generation method that alternates between the generation of unspoken
reasoning chunks and spoken response chunks. Since the audio duration of a
chunk of spoken response is much longer than the time to generate the tokens in
a chunk of spoken response, we use the remaining free time to generate the
unspoken reasoning tokens. When a chunk of audio is played to the user, the
model continues to generate the next unspoken reasoning chunk, achieving
simultaneous thinking and talking. Remarkably, Stitch matches the latency of
baselines that cannot generate unspoken CoT by design while outperforming those
baselines by 15% on math reasoning datasets; Stitch also performs equally well
on non-reasoning datasets as those baseline models. Some animations and
demonstrations are on the project page: https://d223302.github.io/STITCH.

TL;DR: 论文提出了AlgoSimBench基准，评估LLMs在识别算法相似问题（ASPs）上的能力，发现模型表现不佳，并提出了改进方法ASM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在训练数据较少的相关领域中识别算法相似问题的能力。

Method: 引入AlgoSimBench基准，包含1317个问题和402个多选题，提出ASM方法改进相似问题检测。

Result: 最佳模型准确率仅65.9%，ASM方法提升6.7%-11.7%，结合BM25方法可达52.2%准确率。

Conclusion: LLMs在识别ASPs上仍有挑战，ASM方法有效提升性能，未来可结合其他技术进一步优化。

Abstract: Recent progress in LLMs, such as reasoning models, has demonstrated strong
abilities to solve complex competitive programming problems, often rivaling top
human competitors. However, it remains underexplored whether these abilities
generalize to relevant domains that are less seen during training. To address
this, we introduce AlgoSimBench, a new benchmark designed to assess LLMs'
ability to identify algorithmically similar problems (ASPs)-problems that can
be solved using similar algorithmic approaches. AlgoSimBench consists of 1317
problems, annotated with 231 distinct fine-grained algorithm tags, from which
we curate 402 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), where each question presents
one algorithmically similar problem alongside three textually similar but
algorithmically dissimilar distractors. Our evaluation reveals that LLMs
struggle to identify ASPs, with the best-performing model (o3-mini) achieving
only 65.9% accuracy on the MCQ task. To address this challenge, we propose
attempted solution matching (ASM), a novel method for improving problem
similarity detection. On our MCQ task, ASM yields an absolute accuracy
improvement of 6.7% to 11.7% across different models. We also evaluated code
embedding models and retrieval methods on similar problem identification. While
the adversarial selection of problems degrades the performance to be less than
random, we found that simply summarizing the problem to remove narrative
elements eliminates the effect, and combining ASM with a keyword-prioritized
method, BM25, can yield up to 52.2% accuracy. Code and data are available at

Conclusion: 自定义助手库的程序生成对LLMs是一个显著挑战，ASPERA框架为解决这一问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: This work evaluates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to power
digital assistants capable of complex action execution. These assistants rely
on pre-trained programming knowledge to execute multi-step goals by composing
objects and functions defined in assistant libraries into action execution
programs. To achieve this, we develop ASPERA, a framework comprising an
assistant library simulation and a human-assisted LLM data generation engine.
Our engine allows developers to guide LLM generation of high-quality tasks
consisting of complex user queries, simulation state and corresponding
validation programs, tackling data availability and evaluation robustness
challenges. Alongside the framework we release Asper-Bench, an evaluation
dataset of 250 challenging tasks generated using ASPERA, which we use to show
that program generation grounded in custom assistant libraries is a significant
challenge to LLMs compared to dependency-free code generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种训练无关的测试时间扩展方法（TTS），通过条件步骤级自我精炼和并行扩展方法结合，显著提升了LLMs的推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于训练的TTS方法（如持续强化学习）计算开销大，而训练无关的TTS方法逐渐被忽视。论文旨在探索训练无关TTS方法的潜力，以减轻计算负担并提升推理能力。

Method: 设计了条件步骤级自我精炼（一种细粒度顺序扩展方法），并结合经典并行扩展方法，提出混合测试时间扩展（Hybrid TTS）新范式。

Result: 在多种规模（3B-14B）和家族的指令调优LLMs上实验表明，混合策略能显著扩展LLMs的推理性能边界。

Conclusion: 训练无关的混合TTS方法在推理任务中具有巨大潜力，为LLMs的性能提升提供了新方向。

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is a promising approach to progressively elicit the
model's intelligence during inference. Recently, training-based TTS methods,
such as continued reinforcement learning (RL), have further surged in
popularity, while training-free TTS methods are gradually fading from
prominence. However, the additional computation overhead of training amplifies
the burden on test-time scaling. In this paper, we focus on training-free TTS
methods for reasoning. We first design Conditional Step-level Self-refinement,
a fine-grained sequential scaling method guided by process verification. On top
of its effectiveness, we further combine it with other classical parallel
scaling methods at the step level, to introduce a novel inference paradigm
called Hybrid Test-Time Scaling. Extensive experiments on five
instruction-tuned LLMs across different scales (3B-14B) and families
demonstrate that hybrid strategy incorporating various training-free TTS
methods at a fine granularity has considerable potential for expanding the
reasoning performance boundaries of LLMs.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLMs）在文本生成任务上取得进展，但文本风格转换（TST）的评估仍具挑战性，且现有研究多局限于英语，多语言评估未被充分探索。

Method: 对九种语言（英语、西班牙语、德语、中文、阿拉伯语、印地语、乌克兰语、俄语、阿姆哈拉语）的文本去毒系统进行评估，结合神经网络模型和基于提示的LLM评估方法。

Result: 研究为设计更可靠的多语言TST评估流程提供了实用方案。

Conclusion: 论文填补了多语言文本去毒评估的空白，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in large language models (LLMs), evaluation of text
generation tasks such as text style transfer (TST) remains a significant
challenge. Recent studies (Dementieva et al., 2024; Pauli et al., 2025)
revealed a substantial gap between automatic metrics and human judgments.
Moreover, most prior work focuses exclusively on English, leaving multilingual
TST evaluation largely unexplored. In this paper, we perform the first
comprehensive multilingual study on evaluation of text detoxification system
across nine languages: English, Spanish, German, Chinese, Arabic, Hindi,
Ukrainian, Russian, Amharic. Drawing inspiration from the machine translation,
we assess the effectiveness of modern neural-based evaluation models alongside
prompting-based LLM-as-a-judge approaches. Our findings provide a practical
recipe for designing more reliable multilingual TST evaluation pipeline in the
text detoxification case.

Motivation: 太赫兹成像在安全筛查和材料分类等应用中具有潜力，但受限于标注数据少、分辨率低和视觉模糊，传统分类方法效果不佳。

Method: 采用模态对齐的提示框架，将两种开源的VLM适配到THz领域，并在零样本和单样本设置下评估。

Result: 实验表明，ICL在低数据情况下提升了分类性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: 这是ICL增强的VLM首次应用于THz成像，为资源受限的科学领域提供了新方向。

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) imaging enables non-invasive analysis for applications such
as security screening and material classification, but effective image
classification remains challenging due to limited annotations, low resolution,
and visual ambiguity. We introduce In-Context Learning (ICL) with
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as a flexible, interpretable alternative that
requires no fine-tuning. Using a modality-aligned prompting framework, we adapt
two open-weight VLMs to the THz domain and evaluate them under zero-shot and
one-shot settings. Our results show that ICL improves classification and
interpretability in low-data regimes. This is the first application of
ICL-enhanced VLMs to THz imaging, offering a promising direction for
resource-constrained scientific domains. Code:

TL;DR: LEAR是一种通过学习提取理性证据的方法，通过显式推理和提取机制减少检索噪声，提高LLM生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索噪声显著影响LLM生成质量，现有方法缺乏显式推理，易遗漏关键线索且泛化能力不足。

Method: LEAR通过统一推理和提取框架、知识标记掩码分离及三种可验证奖励函数（答案、长度、格式）进行端到端训练。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上实验证明LEAR能提供紧凑高质量证据，提升下游任务准确性，适用于在线RAG系统。

Conclusion: LEAR通过显式推理和提取机制有效减少噪声，提升LLM生成质量，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) effectively improves the accuracy of
Large Language Models (LLMs). However, retrieval noises significantly impact
the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising
mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without
explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with
generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational
evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within
retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting
any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence
reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end
training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive
reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of
verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update
the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and
high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and
promoting effective application in online RAG systems.

Motivation: 探索叙事作为理解政治现实的工具，以及叙事冲突如何反映公共领域中的极化和议题对齐。

Method: 提取对立观点群体推文中的叙事信号，分析乌克兰战争、新冠疫情和气候变化等议题中的叙事冲突。

Result: 发现叙事冲突的两个维度：角色分配差异和事件情节差异，并初步揭示了叙事对齐的模式。

Conclusion: 叙事分析为研究极化现象提供了新的视角，揭示了政治行为者如何通过叙事对齐跨议题观点。

Abstract: Narratives are key interpretative devices by which humans make sense of
political reality. In this work, we show how the analysis of conflicting
narratives, i.e. conflicting interpretive lenses through which political
reality is experienced and told, provides insight into the discursive
mechanisms of polarization and issue alignment in the public sphere. Building
upon previous work that has identified ideologically polarized issues in the
German Twittersphere between 2021 and 2023, we analyze the discursive dimension
of polarization by extracting textual signals of conflicting narratives from
tweets of opposing opinion groups. Focusing on a selection of salient issues
and events (the war in Ukraine, Covid, climate change), we show evidence for
conflicting narratives along two dimensions: (i) different attributions of
actantial roles to the same set of actants (e.g. diverging interpretations of
the role of NATO in the war in Ukraine), and (ii) emplotment of different
actants for the same event (e.g. Bill Gates in the right-leaning Covid
narrative). Furthermore, we provide first evidence for patterns of narrative
alignment, a discursive strategy that political actors employ to align opinions
across issues. These findings demonstrate the use of narratives as an
analytical lens into the discursive mechanisms of polarization.

Result: 在通用任务和推理任务中，P3表现优于现有自动提示优化方法。

Conclusion: 整体优化策略能显著提升大语言模型在多样化任务中的性能。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) applications often employ multi-component
prompts, comprising both system and user prompts, to guide model behaviors.
While recent advancements have demonstrated the efficacy of automatically
optimizing either the system or user prompt to boost performance, such
unilateral approaches often yield suboptimal outcomes due to the interdependent
nature of these components. In this work, we introduce P3, a novel
self-improvement framework that concurrently optimizes both system and user
prompts through an iterative process. The offline optimized prompts are further
leveraged to promote online prompting by performing query-dependent prompt
optimization. Extensive experiments on general tasks (e.g., Arena-hard and
Alpaca-eval) and reasoning tasks (e.g., GSM8K and GPQA) demonstrate that P3
achieves superior performance in the realm of automatic prompt optimization.
Our results highlight the effectiveness of a holistic optimization strategy in
enhancing LLM performance across diverse domains.

Method: 提出CoLD框架，包含显式长度惩罚调整、学习偏置估计器和联合训练策略，基于反事实推理和因果图分析。

Result: 在MATH500和GSM-Plus数据集上，CoLD显著降低了奖励与长度的相关性，提升了步骤选择的准确性和推理的简洁性。

Conclusion: CoLD有效提升了PRMs的可靠性和鲁棒性，为多步推理提供了更准确的评估和指导。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) play a central role in evaluating and guiding
multi-step reasoning in large language models (LLMs), especially for
mathematical problem solving. However, we identify a pervasive length bias in
existing PRMs: they tend to assign higher scores to longer reasoning steps,
even when the semantic content and logical validity are unchanged. This bias
undermines the reliability of reward predictions and leads to overly verbose
outputs during inference. To address this issue, we propose
CoLD(Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing), a unified framework that
mitigates length bias through three components: an explicit length-penalty
adjustment, a learned bias estimator trained to capture spurious length-related
signals, and a joint training strategy that enforces length-invariance in
reward predictions. Our approach is grounded in counterfactual reasoning and
informed by causal graph analysis. Extensive experiments on MATH500 and
GSM-Plus show that CoLD consistently reduces reward-length correlation,
improves accuracy in step selection, and encourages more concise, logically
valid reasoning. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality
of CoLD in improving the fidelity and robustness of PRMs.

Motivation: 传统信号博弈模型中，接收者难以学习组合信息，即使信号发送者发送组合消息，接收者也无法组合理解。信息丢失时，其他组件信息也会被抹去。

Method: 提出了两种新模型：简约型接收者（仅从信号的原子消息学习）和通用型接收者（从所有可用信息学习）。

Result: 新模型比现有替代方案更简单，且接收者能从消息的原子组件中学习。

Conclusion: 新模型成功实现了接收者对组合信息的真正理解，解决了传统模型的局限性。

Abstract: Receivers in standard signaling game models struggle with learning
compositional information. Even when the signalers send compositional messages,
the receivers do not interpret them compositionally. When information from one
message component is lost or forgotten, the information from other components
is also erased. In this paper I construct signaling game models in which
genuine compositional understanding evolves. I present two new models: a
minimalist receiver who only learns from the atomic messages of a signal, and a
generalist receiver who learns from all of the available information. These
models are in many ways simpler than previous alternatives, and allow the
receivers to learn from the atomic components of messages.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been evaluated using diverse question
types, e.g., multiple-choice, true/false, and short/long answers. This study
answers an unexplored question about the impact of different question types on
LLM accuracy on reasoning tasks. We investigate the performance of five LLMs on
three different types of questions using quantitative and deductive reasoning
tasks. The performance metrics include accuracy in the reasoning steps and
choosing the final answer. Key Findings: (1) Significant differences exist in
LLM performance across different question types. (2) Reasoning accuracy does
not necessarily correlate with the final selection accuracy. (3) The number of
options and the choice of words, influence LLM performance.

sample-based (Contrastive Reasoning Calibration) and generation-based (DPO,
SimPO) contrastive learning. The sample-based contrastive approach trains the
model by comparing two samples to generate more reliable predictions. The
generation-based contrastive approach trains the model to differentiate between
correct and incorrect generations, refining its prediction. All models are
fine-tuned from LLaMa3-Instruct-8B. Our system achieves 9th place in Track A
and 6th place in Track B for English, while ranking among the top-tier
performing systems for other languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估基准未能跟上用户多样化需求，研究旨在通过实际用户行为改进评估方法。

Method: 部署LLM驱动的检索生成机器人，分析368个查询和11位天文学家的访谈，总结评估标准。

Result: 揭示了用户评估LLM的具体方式，并提出了改进基准的建议，构建了天文学领域的样本基准。

Conclusion: 研究为提升LLM评估和科学研究的实用性提供了具体方法。

Abstract: There is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to aid in astronomy and other
scientific research, but benchmarks for LLM evaluation in general have not kept
pace with the increasingly diverse ways that real people evaluate and use these
models. In this study, we seek to improve evaluation procedures by building an
understanding of how users evaluate LLMs. We focus on a particular use case: an
LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation bot for engaging with astronomical
literature, which we deployed via Slack. Our inductive coding of 368 queries to
the bot over four weeks and our follow-up interviews with 11 astronomers reveal
how humans evaluated this system, including the types of questions asked and
the criteria for judging responses. We synthesize our findings into concrete
recommendations for building better benchmarks, which we then employ in
constructing a sample benchmark for evaluating LLMs for astronomy. Overall, our
work offers ways to improve LLM evaluation and ultimately usability,
particularly for use in scientific research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有眼科领域的大语言模型评估基准范围有限且过于注重准确性，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 通过关键词匹配和PubMedBERT模型从多个医学数据集中筛选眼科相关多选题，经专家多轮检查和优化后形成高质量数据集。

Result: BELO包含900个高质量问题，评估了六种大语言模型的性能和文本生成质量，并建立了公开排行榜。

Conclusion: BELO将成为公平、可重复的评估工具，推动未来模型的透明比较。

Abstract: Current benchmarks evaluating large language models (LLMs) in ophthalmology
are limited in scope and disproportionately prioritise accuracy. We introduce
BELO (BEnchmarking LLMs for Ophthalmology), a standardized and comprehensive
evaluation benchmark developed through multiple rounds of expert checking by 13
ophthalmologists. BELO assesses ophthalmology-related clinical accuracy and
reasoning quality. Using keyword matching and a fine-tuned PubMedBERT model, we
curated ophthalmology-specific multiple-choice-questions (MCQs) from diverse
medical datasets (BCSC, MedMCQA, MedQA, BioASQ, and PubMedQA). The dataset
underwent multiple rounds of expert checking. Duplicate and substandard
questions were systematically removed. Ten ophthalmologists refined the
explanations of each MCQ's correct answer. This was further adjudicated by
three senior ophthalmologists. To illustrate BELO's utility, we evaluated six
LLMs (OpenAI o1, o3-mini, GPT-4o, DeepSeek-R1, Llama-3-8B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro)
using accuracy, macro-F1, and five text-generation metrics (ROUGE-L, BERTScore,
BARTScore, METEOR, and AlignScore). In a further evaluation involving human
experts, two ophthalmologists qualitatively reviewed 50 randomly selected
outputs for accuracy, comprehensiveness, and completeness. BELO consists of 900
high-quality, expert-reviewed questions aggregated from five sources: BCSC
(260), BioASQ (10), MedMCQA (572), MedQA (40), and PubMedQA (18). A public
leaderboard has been established to promote transparent evaluation and
reporting. Importantly, the BELO dataset will remain a hold-out,
evaluation-only benchmark to ensure fair and reproducible comparisons of future
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏专门评估LLMs在跨学科研究中提出想法能力的基准，阻碍了对LLMs潜力的全面理解。

Method: 引入IDRBench，包含专家标注的数据集和任务，评估LLMs在六个学科领域的跨学科研究能力。

Result: 尽管LLMs表现出一定的跨学科意识，但在生成高质量IDR想法方面仍有困难。

Conclusion: IDRBench为评估LLMs在跨学科研究中的表现提供了系统框架，并揭示了改进方向。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have revealed their
impressive ability to perform multi-step, logic-driven reasoning across complex
domains, positioning them as powerful tools and collaborators in scientific
discovery while challenging the long-held view that inspiration-driven ideation
is uniquely human. However, the lack of a dedicated benchmark that evaluates
LLMs' ability to develop ideas in Interdisciplinary Research (IDR) settings
poses a critical barrier to fully understanding their strengths and
limitations. To address this gap, we introduce IDRBench -- a pioneering
benchmark featuring an expert annotated dataset and a suite of tasks tailored
to evaluate LLMs' capabilities in proposing valuable research ideas from
different scientific domains for interdisciplinary research. This benchmark
aims to provide a systematic framework for assessing LLM performance in
complex, cross-domain scientific research. Our dataset consists of scientific
publications sourced from the ArXiv platform covering six distinct disciplines,
and is annotated by domain experts with diverse academic backgrounds. To ensure
high-quality annotations, we emphasize clearly defined dimensions that
characterize authentic interdisciplinary research. The design of evaluation
tasks in IDRBench follows a progressive, real-world perspective, reflecting the
natural stages of interdisciplinary research development, including 1) IDR
Paper Identification, 2) IDR Idea Integration, and 3) IDR Idea Recommendation.
Using IDRBench, we construct baselines across 10 LLMs and observe that despite
fostering some level of IDR awareness, LLMs still struggle to produce quality
IDR ideas. These findings could not only spark new research directions, but
also help to develop next-generation LLMs that excel in interdisciplinary
research.

Motivation: 为TF-IDF这一经典信息检索方法提供统计学理论基础，使其在统计学社区中得到更广泛的认可。

Method: 通过分析TF-ICF与Fisher精确检验的p值负对数之间的关系，并在理想化假设下建立联系。

Result: 证明了TF-ICF与Fisher精确检验的p值负对数密切相关，且在无限大文档集合的极限情况下收敛于TF-IDF。

Conclusion: 从统计显著性角度为TF-IDF的有效性提供了理论支持，增强了其在统计学领域的解释力。

Abstract: Term frequency-inverse document frequency, or TF-IDF for short, is arguably
the most celebrated mathematical expression in the history of information
retrieval. Conceived as a simple heuristic quantifying the extent to which a
given term's occurrences are concentrated in any one given document out of
many, TF-IDF and its many variants are routinely used as term-weighting schemes
in diverse text analysis applications. There is a growing body of scholarship
dedicated to placing TF-IDF on a sound theoretical foundation. Building on that
tradition, this paper justifies the use of TF-IDF to the statistics community
by demonstrating how the famed expression can be understood from a significance
testing perspective. We show that the common TF-IDF variant TF-ICF is, under
mild regularity conditions, closely related to the negative logarithm of the
$p$-value from a one-tailed version of Fisher's exact test of statistical
significance. As a corollary, we establish a connection between TF-IDF and the
said negative log-transformed $p$-value under certain idealized assumptions. We
further demonstrate, as a limiting case, that this same quantity converges to
TF-IDF in the limit of an infinitely large document collection. The Fisher's
exact test justification of TF-IDF equips the working statistician with a ready
explanation of the term-weighting scheme's long-established effectiveness.

Motivation: 减少人工收集对话数据的成本和时间，推动对话AI研究。

Method: 使用种子提示初始化对话，测试多种LLM（包括专有和开源模型），探索微调技术，并通过UniEval和GTEval评估对话质量。

Conclusion: DialogueForge有效生成模拟对话，但所有模型在保持长对话连贯性方面仍有挑战。

Abstract: Collecting human-chatbot dialogues typically demands substantial manual
effort and is time-consuming, which limits and poses challenges for research on
conversational AI. In this work, we propose DialogueForge - a framework for
generating AI-simulated conversations in human-chatbot style. To initialize
each generated conversation, DialogueForge uses seed prompts extracted from
real human-chatbot interactions. We test a variety of LLMs to simulate the
human chatbot user, ranging from state-of-the-art proprietary models to
small-scale open-source LLMs, and generate multi-turn dialogues tailored to
specific tasks. In addition, we explore fine-tuning techniques to enhance the
ability of smaller models to produce indistinguishable human-like dialogues. We
evaluate the quality of the simulated conversations and compare different
models using the UniEval and GTEval evaluation protocols. Our experiments show
that large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) generally outperform others in
generating more realistic dialogues, while smaller open-source models (e.g.,
Llama, Mistral) offer promising performance with greater customization. We
demonstrate that the performance of smaller models can be significantly
improved by employing supervised fine-tuning techniques. Nevertheless,
maintaining coherent and natural long-form human-like dialogues remains a
common challenge across all models.

Abstract: This paper introduces "Interaction as Intelligence" research series,
presenting a reconceptualization of human-AI relationships in deep research
tasks. Traditional approaches treat interaction merely as an interface for
accessing AI capabilities-a conduit between human intent and machine output. We
propose that interaction itself constitutes a fundamental dimension of
intelligence. As AI systems engage in extended thinking processes for research
tasks, meaningful interaction transitions from an optional enhancement to an
essential component of effective intelligence. Current deep research systems
adopt an "input-wait-output" paradigm where users initiate queries and receive
results after black-box processing. This approach leads to error cascade
effects, inflexible research boundaries that prevent question refinement during
investigation, and missed opportunities for expertise integration. To address
these limitations, we introduce Deep Cognition, a system that transforms the
human role from giving instructions to cognitive oversight-a mode of engagement
where humans guide AI thinking processes through strategic intervention at
critical junctures. Deep cognition implements three key innovations:
(1)Transparent, controllable, and interruptible interaction that reveals AI
reasoning and enables intervention at any point; (2)Fine-grained bidirectional
dialogue; and (3)Shared cognitive context where the system observes and adapts
to user behaviors without explicit instruction. User evaluation demonstrates
that this cognitive oversight paradigm outperforms the strongest baseline
across six key metrics: Transparency(+20.0%), Fine-Grained Interaction(+29.2%),
Real-Time Intervention(+18.5%), Ease of Collaboration(+27.7%),
Results-Worth-Effort(+8.8%), and Interruptibility(+20.7%). Evaluations on
challenging research problems show 31.8% to 50.0% points of improvements over
deep research systems.

Method: 结合RoPE、GQA（3:1压缩比）、RMSNorm和SwiGLU激活函数，并使用128,000词汇量的字节级BPE分词器。

Result: Supernova性能达到1B参数模型的90%，参数减少53%，训练令牌仅需100B。

Abstract: We present Supernova, a 650M-parameter decoder-only transformer that
demonstrates how careful architectural design and tokenization innovation can
achieve the performance of larger models while maintaining computational
efficiency. Our architecture combines Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE),
Grouped Query Attention (GQA) with a 3:1 compression ratio, RMSNorm for
computational efficiency, and SwiGLU activation functions. A critical
innovation is our custom 128,000-vocabulary byte-level BPE tokenizer, which
achieves state-of-the-art compression performance. Through detailed analysis,
we show that Supernova achieves 90% of the performance of 1B-parameter models
while using 53% fewer parameters and requiring only 100B training tokens--an
order of magnitude less than competing models. Our findings challenge the
prevailing scaling paradigm, demonstrating that architectural efficiency and
tokenization quality can compensate for reduced parameter counts.

Motivation: 传统RLVR方法对所有令牌应用统一训练信号，忽视了低熵知识令牌和高熵推理令牌的不同作用，可能导致语义依赖断裂。

Method: Archer采用双令牌约束和同步更新，对推理令牌应用较弱的KL正则化和较高的剪裁阈值以鼓励探索，对知识令牌则施加更强约束以保持事实知识。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务中，Archer显著优于现有RLVR方法，达到或超越同类模型的最先进性能。

Conclusion: Archer通过熵感知和双令牌约束，有效提升了RLVR的效果，同时保持了语义依赖的完整性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become an effective
post-training method for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs), mainly by shaping higher-order behaviors such as reflection and
planning. However, previous RLVR algorithms often apply uniform training
signals to all tokens, without considering the different roles of low-entropy
knowledge-related tokens and high-entropy reasoning-related tokens. Some recent
methods try to separate these token types by gradient masking or asynchronous
updates, but these approaches may break semantic dependencies in the model
output and hinder effective learning. In this work, we propose Archer, an
entropy-aware RLVR approach with dual-token constraints and synchronous
updates. Specifically, our method applies weaker KL regularization and higher
clipping thresholds to reasoning tokens to encourage exploration, while using
stronger constraints on knowledge tokens to maintain factual knowledge.
Experimental results on several mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms previous RLVR
methods, reaching or exceeding state-of-the-art performance among models of
comparable size. The code is available at

Conclusion: 储层计算在资源受限场景下具有潜力，而Transformer在性能上更优，研究为平衡资源与性能提供了指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) have dominated the science and media landscape
duo to their impressive performance on processing large chunks of data and
produce human-like levels of text. Nevertheless, their huge energy demand and
slow processing still a bottleneck for further increasing quality while also
making the models accessible to everyone. To solve this bottleneck, we will
investigate how reservoir computing performs on natural text processing, which
could enable fast and energy efficient hardware implementations. Studies
investigating the use of reservoir computing as a language model remain sparse.
In this paper, we compare three distinct approaches for character-level
language modeling, two different reservoir computing approaches, where only an
output layer is trainable, and the well-known transformer-based architectures,
which fully learn an attention-based sequence representation. We explore the
performance, computational cost and prediction accuracy for both paradigms by
equally varying the number of trainable parameters for all models. Using a
consistent pipeline for all three approaches, we demonstrate that transformers
excel in prediction quality, whereas reservoir computers remain highly
efficient reducing the training and inference speed. Furthermore, we
investigate two types of reservoir computing: a traditional reservoir with a
static linear readout, and an attention-enhanced reservoir that dynamically
adapts its output weights via an attention mechanism. Our findings underline
how these paradigms scale and offer guidelines to balance resource constraints
with performance.

Motivation: 探究双语推理模型中语言切换行为的成因及其对推理能力的影响，验证语言混合是否具有策略性。

Method: 使用强化学习验证奖励（RLVR）训练阶段分析语言混合行为，并设计轻量级探针预测语言切换对推理的影响。

Result: 语言混合提升推理准确性，强制单语解码降低5.6个百分点；探针指导解码可提高准确性达6.25个百分点。

Conclusion: 语言混合是双语模型的策略性推理行为，而非多语言训练的副产品。

Abstract: Proficient multilingual speakers often intentionally switch languages in the
middle of a conversation. Similarly, recent reasoning-focused bilingual large
language models (LLMs) with strong capabilities in both languages exhibit
language mixing--alternating languages within their chain of thought.
Discouraging this behavior in DeepSeek-R1 was found to degrade accuracy,
suggesting that language mixing may benefit reasoning. In this work, we study
language switching in Chinese-English bilingual reasoning models. We identify
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) as the critical training
stage that leads to language mixing. We demonstrate that language mixing can
enhance reasoning: enforcing monolingual decoding reduces accuracy by 5.6
percentage points on math reasoning tasks. Additionally, a lightweight probe
can be trained to predict whether a potential language switch would benefit or
harm reasoning, and when used to guide decoding, increases accuracy by up to
6.25 percentage points. Our findings suggest that language mixing is not merely
a byproduct of multilingual training, but is a strategic reasoning behavior.

Abstract: Arabic is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, yet efforts
to develop and evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) for Arabic remain
relatively limited. Most existing Arabic benchmarks focus on linguistic,
cultural, or religious content, leaving a significant gap in domains like STEM
and code which are increasingly relevant for real-world LLM applications. To
help bridge this gap, we present 3LM, a suite of three benchmarks designed
specifically for Arabic. The first is a set of STEM-related question-answer
pairs, naturally sourced from Arabic textbooks and educational worksheets. The
second consists of synthetically generated STEM questions, created using the
same sources. The third benchmark focuses on code generation, built through a
careful translation of two widely used code benchmarks, incorporating a
human-in-the-loop process with several rounds of review to ensure high-quality
and faithful translations. We release all three benchmarks publicly to support
the growth of Arabic LLM research in these essential but underrepresented
areas.

Abstract: In recent years, the concept of artificial intelligence (AI) has become a
prominent keyword because it is promising in solving complex tasks. The need
for human expertise in specific areas may no longer be needed because machines
have achieved successful results using artificial intelligence and can make the
right decisions in critical situations. This process is possible with the help
of deep learning (DL), one of the most popular artificial intelligence
technologies. One of the areas in which the use of DL is used is in the
development of self-driving cars, which is very effective and important. In
this work, we propose several efficient models to investigate scene
understanding through semantic segmentation. We use the BDD100k dataset to
investigate these models. Another contribution of this work is the usage of
several Backbones as encoders for models. The obtained results show that
choosing the appropriate backbone has a great effect on the performance of the
model for semantic segmentation. Better performance in semantic segmentation
allows us to understand better the scene and the environment around the agent.
In the end, we analyze and evaluate the proposed models in terms of accuracy,
mean IoU, and loss function, and the results show that these metrics are
improved.

Motivation: 现有基于熵最小化的测试时适应方法（TTA）与VLMs的对比训练目标不匹配，导致性能受限和伪标签漂移等问题。

Method: 提出CLIPTTA，利用与CLIP预训练目标一致的软对比损失，并通过理论分析证明其批次设计可避免崩溃风险。

Result: 在75个数据集上评估，CLIPTTA表现优于基于熵的方法，并在开放集设置中通过OCE损失提升OOD检测能力。

Conclusion: CLIPTTA在多样分布偏移下表现稳定且优于现有TTA方法。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP exhibit strong zero-shot capabilities
but often fail to generalize under distribution shifts. Test-time adaptation
(TTA) allows models to update at inference time without labeled data, typically
via entropy minimization. However, this objective is fundamentally misaligned
with the contrastive image-text training of VLMs, limiting adaptation
performance and introducing failure modes such as pseudo-label drift and class
collapse. We propose CLIPTTA, a new gradient-based TTA method for
vision-language models that leverages a soft contrastive loss aligned with
CLIP's pre-training objective. We provide a theoretical analysis of CLIPTTA's
gradients, showing how its batch-aware design mitigates the risk of collapse.
We further extend CLIPTTA to the open-set setting, where both in-distribution
(ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) samples are encountered, using an Outlier
Contrastive Exposure (OCE) loss to improve OOD detection. Evaluated on 75
datasets spanning diverse distribution shifts, CLIPTTA consistently outperforms
entropy-based objectives and is highly competitive with state-of-the-art TTA
methods, outperforming them on a large number of datasets and exhibiting more
stable performance across diverse shifts.

### [90] [A Hidden Stumbling Block in Generalized Category Discovery: Distracted Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14315)
*Qiyu Xu,Zhanxuan Hu,Yu Duan,Ercheng Pei,Yonghang Tai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为注意力聚焦（AF）的机制，通过修剪非信息性标记来解决广义类别发现（GCD）中的注意力分散问题，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法在处理未标记数据时，模型注意力常被任务无关的背景区域分散，导致特征提取不理想。

Method: AF由两部分组成：标记重要性度量（TIME）和多尺度标记自适应修剪（TAP），通过量化标记重要性并修剪非信息性标记来优化注意力。

Result: 将AF集成到SimGCD方法中，性能提升高达15.4%，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: AF是一种轻量级、即插即用的模块，能有效提升GCD方法的性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify unlabeled data from
both known and unknown categories by leveraging knowledge from labeled known
categories. While existing methods have made notable progress, they often
overlook a hidden stumbling block in GCD: distracted attention. Specifically,
when processing unlabeled data, models tend to focus not only on key objects in
the image but also on task-irrelevant background regions, leading to suboptimal
feature extraction. To remove this stumbling block, we propose Attention
Focusing (AF), an adaptive mechanism designed to sharpen the model's focus by
pruning non-informative tokens. AF consists of two simple yet effective
components: Token Importance Measurement (TIME) and Token Adaptive Pruning
(TAP), working in a cascade. TIME quantifies token importance across multiple
scales, while TAP prunes non-informative tokens by utilizing the multi-scale
importance scores provided by TIME. AF is a lightweight, plug-and-play module
that integrates seamlessly into existing GCD methods with minimal computational
overhead. When incorporated into one prominent GCD method, SimGCD, AF achieves
up to 15.4% performance improvement over the baseline with minimal
computational overhead. The implementation code is provided in
https://github.com/Afleve/AFGCD.

*Weiming Ren,Raghav Goyal,Zhiming Hu,Tristan Ty Aumentado-Armstrong,Iqbal Mohomed,Alex Levinshtein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种衡量和减少生成超分辨率（GSR）模型中“幻觉”问题的方法，通过多模态大语言模型（MLLM）生成“幻觉分数”（HS），并利用深度特征距离作为奖励函数优化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成超分辨率模型虽在感知质量上表现优异，但存在生成的细节与低分辨率图像或真实图像不匹配的“幻觉”问题，影响实际应用。

Method: 利用MLLM构建提示评估幻觉元素生成HS，并发现某些深度特征距离与HS强相关，提出将其作为可微奖励函数优化模型。

Result: HS与人类评估高度一致，且为超分辨率模型提供了补充性见解。

Conclusion: 通过HS和深度特征距离优化GSR模型，可有效减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: Generative super-resolution (GSR) currently sets the state-of-the-art in
terms of perceptual image quality, overcoming the "regression-to-the-mean" blur
of prior non-generative models. However, from a human perspective, such models
do not fully conform to the optimal balance between quality and fidelity.
Instead, a different class of artifacts, in which generated details fail to
perceptually match the low resolution image (LRI) or ground-truth image (GTI),
is a critical but under studied issue in GSR, limiting its practical
deployments. In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating
these artifacts (i.e., "hallucinations"). We observe that hallucinations are
not well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they
are orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we
take advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a
prompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a
"Hallucination Score" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human
evaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics
used for super-resolution (SR) models. In addition, we find certain deep
feature distances have strong correlations with HS. We therefore propose to
align the GSR models by using such features as differentiable reward functions
to mitigate hallucinations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: B型超声中组织运动的准确跟踪因噪声和运动模糊而具有挑战性，需要一种通用且鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 结合深度学习和光流技术，提供图形界面支持训练数据生成和模型迭代优化，并引入光流滤波技术减少噪声。

Result: DUSTrack在准确性上优于零样本点跟踪器，与专用方法相当，适用于多种解剖结构和运动模式。

Conclusion: DUSTrack是一种通用且强大的开源工具，适用于临床和生物力学研究中的组织运动量化。

Abstract: Ultrasound technology enables safe, non-invasive imaging of dynamic tissue
behavior, making it a valuable tool in medicine, biomechanics, and sports
science. However, accurately tracking tissue motion in B-mode ultrasound
remains challenging due to speckle noise, low edge contrast, and out-of-plane
movement. These challenges complicate the task of tracking anatomical landmarks
over time, which is essential for quantifying tissue dynamics in many clinical
and research applications. This manuscript introduces DUSTrack (Deep learning
and optical flow-based toolkit for UltraSound Tracking), a semi-automated
framework for tracking arbitrary points in B-mode ultrasound videos. We combine
deep learning with optical flow to deliver high-quality and robust tracking
across diverse anatomical structures and motion patterns. The toolkit includes
a graphical user interface that streamlines the generation of high-quality
training data and supports iterative model refinement. It also implements a
novel optical-flow-based filtering technique that reduces high-frequency
frame-to-frame noise while preserving rapid tissue motion. DUSTrack
demonstrates superior accuracy compared to contemporary zero-shot point
trackers and performs on par with specialized methods, establishing its
potential as a general and foundational tool for clinical and biomechanical
research. We demonstrate DUSTrack's versatility through three use cases:
cardiac wall motion tracking in echocardiograms, muscle deformation analysis
during reaching tasks, and fascicle tracking during ankle plantarflexion. As an
open-source solution, DUSTrack offers a powerful, flexible framework for point
tracking to quantify tissue motion from ultrasound videos. DUSTrack is

Conclusion: CRAFT为稳健且可信的场景理解提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce CRAFT, a neuro-symbolic framework for interpretable affordance
grounding, which identifies the objects in a scene that enable a given action
(e.g., "cut"). CRAFT integrates structured commonsense priors from ConceptNet
and language models with visual evidence from CLIP, using an energy-based
reasoning loop to refine predictions iteratively. This process yields
transparent, goal-driven decisions to ground symbolic and perceptual
structures. Experiments in multi-object, label-free settings demonstrate that
CRAFT enhances accuracy while improving interpretability, providing a step
toward robust and trustworthy scene understanding.

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在视频质量、压缩效率和传输速率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为3DGS视频流提供了高效解决方案，适用于带宽波动环境。

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has significantly enhanced the
quality of volumetric video representation. Meanwhile, in contrast to
conventional volumetric video, 3DGS video poses significant challenges for
streaming due to its substantially larger data volume and the heightened
complexity involved in compression and transmission. To address these issues,
we introduce an innovative framework for 3DGS volumetric video streaming.
Specifically, we design a 3DGS video construction method based on the Gaussian
deformation field. By employing hybrid saliency tiling and differentiated
quality modeling of 3DGS video, we achieve efficient data compression and
adaptation to bandwidth fluctuations while ensuring high transmission quality.
Then we build a complete 3DGS video streaming system and validate the
transmission performance. Through experimental evaluation, our method
demonstrated superiority over existing approaches in various aspects, including
video quality, compression effectiveness, and transmission rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖合成红外图像的局限性，以及真实红外图像与文本对齐数据稀缺的问题。

Method: 构建IR-TD数据集（26万真实红外图像-文本对），提出双跨模态课程迁移学习策略，从可见光到红外域系统迁移知识。

Result: 在9项任务（如识别、定位）中达到最先进性能，优于更大规模模型。

Conclusion: IRGPT通过真实数据集和创新学习策略，显著提升了红外图像的多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Real-world infrared imagery presents unique challenges for vision-language
models due to the scarcity of aligned text data and domain-specific
characteristics. Although existing methods have advanced the field, their
reliance on synthetic infrared images generated through style transfer from
visible images, which limits their ability to capture the unique
characteristics of the infrared modality. To address this, we propose IRGPT,
the first multi-modal large language model for real-world infrared images,
built upon a large-scale InfraRed-Text Dataset (IR-TD) comprising over 260K
authentic image-text pairs. The proposed IR-TD dataset contains real infrared
images paired with meticulously handcrafted texts, where the initial drafts
originated from two complementary processes: (1) LLM-generated descriptions of
visible images, and (2) rule-based descriptions of annotations. Furthermore, we
introduce a bi-cross-modal curriculum transfer learning strategy that
systematically transfers knowledge from visible to infrared domains by
considering the difficulty scores of both infrared-visible and infrared-text.
Evaluated on a benchmark of 9 tasks (e.g., recognition, grounding), IRGPT
achieves state-of-the-art performance even compared with larger-scale models.

Result: 在多种任务中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GPI-Net通过Gestalt原则有效提升了点云配准中对应关系的质量。

Abstract: The accurate identification of high-quality correspondences is a prerequisite
task in feature-based point cloud registration. However, it is extremely
challenging to handle the fusion of local and global features due to feature
redundancy and complex spatial relationships. Given that Gestalt principles
provide key advantages in analyzing local and global relationships, we propose
a novel Gestalt-guided Parallel Interaction Network via orthogonal geometric
consistency (GPI-Net) in this paper. It utilizes Gestalt principles to
facilitate complementary communication between local and global information.
Specifically, we introduce an orthogonal integration strategy to optimally
reduce redundant information and generate a more compact global structure for
high-quality correspondences. To capture geometric features in correspondences,
we leverage a Gestalt Feature Attention (GFA) block through a hybrid
utilization of self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the integration of local detail information into the global
structure, we design an innovative Dual-path Multi-Granularity parallel
interaction aggregation (DMG) block to promote information exchange across
different granularities. Extensive experiments on various challenging tasks
demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed GPI-Net in comparison to
existing methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gwk/GPI-Net.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting video (3DGS) streaming has recently emerged as a
research hotspot in both academia and industry, owing to its impressive ability
to deliver immersive 3D video experiences. However, research in this area is
still in its early stages, and several fundamental challenges, such as tiling,
quality assessment, and bitrate adaptation, require further investigation. In
this paper, we tackle these challenges by proposing a comprehensive set of
solutions. Specifically, we propose an adaptive 3DGS tiling technique guided by
saliency analysis, which integrates both spatial and temporal features. Each
tile is encoded into versions possessing dedicated deformation fields and
multiple quality levels for adaptive selection. We also introduce a novel
quality assessment framework for 3DGS video that jointly evaluates
spatial-domain degradation in 3DGS representations during streaming and the
quality of the resulting 2D rendered images. Additionally, we develop a
meta-learning-based adaptive bitrate algorithm specifically tailored for 3DGS
video streaming, achieving optimal performance across varying network
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approaches
significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving requires adaptive and robust handling of
complex and diverse traffic environments. However, prevalent single-mode
planning methods attempt to learn an overall policy while struggling to acquire
diversified driving skills to handle diverse scenarios. Therefore, this paper
proposes GEMINUS, a Mixture-of-Experts end-to-end autonomous driving framework
featuring a Global Expert, a Scene-Adaptive Experts Group, and equipped with a
Dual-aware Router. Specifically, the Global Expert is trained on the overall
dataset, possessing robust performance. The Scene-Adaptive Experts are trained
on corresponding scene subsets, achieving adaptive performance. The Dual-aware
Router simultaneously considers scenario-level features and routing uncertainty
to dynamically activate expert modules. Through the effective coupling of the
Global Expert and the Scene-Adaptive Experts Group via the Dual-aware Router,
GEMINUS achieves adaptive and robust performance in diverse scenarios. GEMINUS
outperforms existing methods in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and
achieves state-of-the-art performance in Driving Score and Success Rate, even
with only monocular vision input. Furthermore, ablation studies demonstrate
significant improvements over the original single-expert baseline: 7.67% in
Driving Score, 22.06% in Success Rate, and 19.41% in MultiAbility-Mean. The

Result: 实验证明VisGuard在数据检索准确性、嵌入容量和抗篡改安全性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: VisGuard能有效保护和促进可视化传播及信息传递。

Abstract: The dissemination of visualizations is primarily in the form of raster
images, which often results in the loss of critical information such as source
code, interactive features, and metadata. While previous methods have proposed
embedding metadata into images to facilitate Visualization Image Data Retrieval
(VIDR), most existing methods lack practicability since they are fragile to
common image tampering during online distribution such as cropping and editing.
To address this issue, we propose VisGuard, a tamper-resistant VIDR framework
that reliably embeds metadata link into visualization images. The embedded data
link remains recoverable even after substantial tampering upon images. We
propose several techniques to enhance robustness, including repetitive data
tiling, invertible information broadcasting, and an anchor-based scheme for
crop localization. VisGuard enables various applications, including interactive
chart reconstruction, tampering detection, and copyright protection. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on VisGuard's superior performance in data retrieval
accuracy, embedding capacity, and security against tampering and steganalysis,
demonstrating VisGuard's competence in facilitating and safeguarding
visualization dissemination and information conveyance.

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，OptiCorNet在季节和视角变化等挑战性条件下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OptiCorNet通过端到端学习序列级嵌入，显著提升了视觉地点识别的性能。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) in dynamic and perceptually aliased
environments remains a fundamental challenge for long-term localization.
Existing deep learning-based solutions predominantly focus on single-frame
embeddings, neglecting the temporal coherence present in image sequences. This
paper presents OptiCorNet, a novel sequence modeling framework that unifies
spatial feature extraction and temporal differencing into a differentiable,
end-to-end trainable module. Central to our approach is a lightweight 1D
convolutional encoder combined with a learnable differential temporal operator,
termed Differentiable Sequence Delta (DSD), which jointly captures short-term
spatial context and long-range temporal transitions. The DSD module models
directional differences across sequences via a fixed-weight differencing
kernel, followed by an LSTM-based refinement and optional residual projection,
yielding compact, discriminative descriptors robust to viewpoint and appearance
shifts. To further enhance inter-class separability, we incorporate a
quadruplet loss that optimizes both positive alignment and multi-negative
divergence within each batch. Unlike prior VPR methods that treat temporal
aggregation as post-processing, OptiCorNet learns sequence-level embeddings
directly, enabling more effective end-to-end place recognition. Comprehensive
evaluations on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under challenging seasonal and viewpoint
variations.

Motivation: 现有DFQ方法在合成样本时未能充分平衡全局和局部特征，且量化模型与全精度模型的中间层激活分布差异大，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出DFQ-ViT，按难度递增合成样本，并引入激活校正矩阵以对齐中间层激活分布。

Conclusion: DFQ-ViT无需微调，降低计算开销和部署门槛，符合绿色学习原则，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) enables the quantization of Vision Transformers
(ViTs) without requiring access to data, allowing for the deployment of ViTs on
devices with limited resources. In DFQ, the quantization model must be
calibrated using synthetic samples, making the quality of these synthetic
samples crucial. Existing methods fail to fully capture and balance the global
and local features within the samples, resulting in limited synthetic data
quality. Moreover, we have found that during inference, there is a significant
difference in the distributions of intermediate layer activations between the
quantized and full-precision models. These issues lead to a severe performance
degradation of the quantized model. To address these problems, we propose a
pipeline for Data-Free Quantization for Vision Transformers (DFQ-ViT).
Specifically, we synthesize samples in order of increasing difficulty,
effectively enhancing the quality of synthetic data. During the calibration and
inference stage, we introduce the activation correction matrix for the
quantized model to align the intermediate layer activations with those of the
full-precision model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DFQ-ViT achieves
remarkable superiority over existing DFQ methods and its performance is on par
with models quantized through real data. For example, the performance of DeiT-T
with 3-bit weights quantization is 4.29% higher than the state-of-the-art. Our
method eliminates the need for fine-tuning, which not only reduces
computational overhead but also lowers the deployment barriers for edge
devices. This characteristic aligns with the principles of Green Learning by
improving energy efficiency and facilitating real-world applications in
resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Completing the whole 3D structure based on an incomplete point cloud is a
challenging task, particularly when the residual point cloud lacks typical
structural characteristics. Recent methods based on cross-modal learning
attempt to introduce instance images to aid the structure feature learning.
However, they still focus on each particular input class, limiting their
generation abilities. In this work, we propose a novel retrieval-augmented
point cloud completion framework. The core idea is to incorporate cross-modal
retrieval into completion task to learn structural prior information from
similar reference samples. Specifically, we design a Structural Shared Feature
Encoder (SSFE) to jointly extract cross-modal features and reconstruct
reference features as priors. Benefiting from a dual-channel control gate in
the encoder, relevant structural features in the reference sample are enhanced
and irrelevant information interference is suppressed. In addition, we propose
a Progressive Retrieval-Augmented Generator (PRAG) that employs a hierarchical
feature fusion mechanism to integrate reference prior information with input
features from global to local. Through extensive evaluations on multiple
datasets and real-world scenes, our method shows its effectiveness in
generating fine-grained point clouds, as well as its generalization capability
in handling sparse data and unseen categories.

TL;DR: TCP-LLaVA是一种新型多模态大语言模型，通过令牌压缩技术解决病理学全切片图像（WSI）的视觉问答（VQA）问题，显著降低计算成本并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理学全切片图像（WSI）的高分辨率和长上下文长度对多模态大语言模型（MLLM）提出了巨大挑战，现有方法在生成能力和资源消耗上存在不足。

Method: 提出TCP-LLaVA模型，引入可训练的压缩令牌，通过模态压缩模块聚合视觉和文本信息，仅将压缩后的令牌输入语言模型以生成答案。

Result: 在十种TCGA肿瘤亚型的实验中，TCP-LLaVA在VQA准确性上优于现有MLLM基线，同时大幅减少训练资源消耗。

Conclusion: TCP-LLaVA为WSI的VQA提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，通过令牌压缩技术平衡了性能和资源消耗。

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) in pathology can reach up to 10,000 x 10,000
pixels, posing significant challenges for multimodal large language model
(MLLM) due to long context length and high computational demands. Previous
methods typically focus on patch-level analysis or slide-level classification
using CLIP-based models with multi-instance learning, but they lack the
generative capabilities needed for visual question answering (VQA). More recent
MLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly
into the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To
address these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA
(TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token
compression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that
aggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module,
inspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are
forwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length
and computational cost. Experiments on ten TCGA tumor subtypes show that
TCP-LLaVA outperforms existing MLLM baselines in VQA accuracy while reducing

Result: 在EVIMO2v2数据集上验证，方法在物体边界表现优异，能准确估计平移运动。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时机器人及导航应用中具有潜力，尤其在处理运动物体边界时优势显著。

Abstract: This paper introduces a robust framework for motion segmentation and
egomotion estimation using event-based normal flow, tailored specifically for
neuromorphic vision sensors. In contrast to traditional methods that rely
heavily on optical flow or explicit depth estimation, our approach exploits the
sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data and incorporates geometric
constraints between normal flow, scene structure, and inertial measurements.
The proposed optimization-based pipeline iteratively performs event
over-segmentation, isolates independently moving objects via residual analysis,
and refines segmentations using hierarchical clustering informed by motion
similarity and temporal consistency. Experimental results on the EVIMO2v2
dataset validate that our method achieves accurate segmentation and
translational motion estimation without requiring full optical flow
computation. This approach demonstrates significant advantages at object
boundaries and offers considerable potential for scalable, real-time robotic
and navigation applications.

view synthesis, with a taxonomy according to the underlying representation
architectures including point cloud, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF), etc. We examine key tasks such as pose-free
reconstruction, dynamic 3D reconstruction, and 3D-aware image and video
synthesis, highlighting their applications in digital humans, SLAM, robotics,
and beyond. In addition, we review commonly used datasets with detailed
statistics, along with evaluation protocols for various downstream tasks. We
conclude by discussing open research challenges and promising directions for
future work, emphasizing the potential of feed-forward approaches to advance

Conclusion: DCHM无需人工标注，首次在复杂场景中实现行人重建和多视角分割，具有显著优势。

Abstract: Multiview pedestrian detection typically involves two stages: human modeling
and pedestrian localization. Human modeling represents pedestrians in 3D space
by fusing multiview information, making its quality crucial for detection
accuracy. However, existing methods often introduce noise and have low
precision. While some approaches reduce noise by fitting on costly multiview 3D
annotations, they often struggle to generalize across diverse scenes. To
eliminate reliance on human-labeled annotations and accurately model humans, we
propose Depth-Consistent Human Modeling (DCHM), a framework designed for
consistent depth estimation and multiview fusion in global coordinates.
Specifically, our proposed pipeline with superpixel-wise Gaussian Splatting
achieves multiview depth consistency in sparse-view, large-scaled, and crowded
scenarios, producing precise point clouds for pedestrian localization.
Extensive validations demonstrate that our method significantly reduces noise
during human modeling, outperforming previous state-of-the-art baselines.
Additionally, to our knowledge, DCHM is the first to reconstruct pedestrians
and perform multiview segmentation in such a challenging setting. Code is
available on the \href{https://jiahao-ma.github.io/DCHM/}{project page}.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of educational applications, artistic creation, and
AI-generated content (AIGC) technologies has substantially increased practical
requirements for comprehensive Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA), particularly
demanding methods capable of delivering both quantitative scoring and
professional understanding. Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based IAA

Expert-Level Understanding capabilities; (2) ArtiMuse-10K, the first
expert-curated image aesthetic dataset comprising 10,000 images spanning 5 main
categories and 15 subcategories, each annotated by professional experts with
8-dimensional attributes analysis and a holistic score. Both the model and
dataset will be made public to advance the field.

Abstract: It has always been a rather tough task to communicate with someone possessing
a hearing impairment. One of the most tested ways to establish such a
communication is through the use of sign based languages. However, not many
people are aware of the smaller intricacies involved with sign language. Sign
language recognition using computer vision aims at eliminating the
communication barrier between deaf-mute and ordinary people so that they can
properly communicate with others. Recently the pandemic has left the whole
world shaken up and has transformed the way we communicate. Video meetings have
become essential for everyone, even people with a hearing disability. In recent
studies, it has been found that people with hearing disabilities prefer to sign
over typing during these video calls. In this paper, we are proposing a browser
extension that will automatically translate sign language to subtitles for
everyone else in the video call. The Large-scale dataset which contains more
than 2000 Word-Level ASL videos, which were performed by over 100 signers will
be used.

Result: ANN困惑的刺激同样导致人类感知不确定性增加，微调后的ANN预测与群体及个体人类感知模式一致。

Conclusion: 研究建立了ANN决策边界与人类感知变异性的系统联系，为个性化情感解释建模提供了新视角。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in affective cognitive science is to develop models
that accurately capture the relationship between external emotional stimuli and
human internal experiences. While ANNs have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in
facial expression recognition, their ability to model inter-individual
differences in human perception remains underexplored. This study investigates
the phenomenon of high perceptual variability-where individuals exhibit
significant differences in emotion categorization even when viewing the same
stimulus. Inspired by the similarity between ANNs and human perception, we
hypothesize that facial expression samples that are ambiguous for ANN
classifiers also elicit divergent perceptual judgments among human observers.
To examine this hypothesis, we introduce a novel perceptual boundary sampling
method to generate facial expression stimuli that lie along ANN decision
boundaries. These ambiguous samples form the basis of the varEmotion dataset,
constructed through large-scale human behavioral experiments. Our analysis
reveals that these ANN-confusing stimuli also provoke heightened perceptual
uncertainty in human participants, highlighting shared computational principles
in emotion perception. Finally, by fine-tuning ANN representations using
behavioral data, we achieve alignment between ANN predictions and both
group-level and individual-level human perceptual patterns. Our findings
establish a systematic link between ANN decision boundaries and human
perceptual variability, offering new insights into personalized modeling of
emotional interpretation.

Motivation: 摄影爱好者常因疏忽或经验不足在照片中留下杂乱元素，影响情感表达和故事传达。

Result: 用户研究表明，系统能帮助用户更高效地识别干扰并提升照片质量。

Conclusion: 该系统提供了灵活的界面和准确的算法，显著改善了用户的摄影体验。

Abstract: Clutter in photos is a distraction preventing photographers from conveying
the intended emotions or stories to the audience. Photography amateurs
frequently include clutter in their photos due to unconscious negligence or the
lack of experience in creating a decluttered, aesthetically appealing scene for
shooting. We are thus motivated to develop a camera guidance system that
provides solutions and guidance for clutter identification and removal. We
estimate and visualize the contribution of objects to the overall aesthetics
and content of a photo, based on which users can interactively identify
clutter. Suggestions on getting rid of clutter, as well as a tool that removes
cluttered objects computationally, are provided to guide users to deal with
different kinds of clutter and improve their photographic work. Two technical
novelties underpin interactions in our system: a clutter distinguishment
algorithm with aesthetics evaluations for objects and an iterative image
inpainting algorithm based on generative adversarial nets that reconstructs
missing regions of removed objects for high-resolution images. User studies
demonstrate that our system provides flexible interfaces and accurate
algorithms that allow users to better identify distractions and take higher
quality images within less time.

Motivation: 现有3D场景语言模型在物体间关系理解上表现不足，视觉嵌入难以充分表达物体角色和交互。

Result: 在ScanRefer等五个基准数据集上，Descrip3D均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 语言引导的关系表示能有效提升复杂室内场景的理解能力。

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes goes beyond simply recognizing objects; it requires
reasoning about the spatial and semantic relationships between them. Current 3D
scene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding,
particularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles
and interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and
powerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects
using natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D
embeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that
captures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships. These
relational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level
integration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for
unified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and
question answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional
supervision. When evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including ScanRefer,
Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, SQA3D, and Scan2Cap, Descrip3D consistently outperforms
strong baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of language-guided
relational representation for understanding complex indoor scenes.

Motivation: 预训练模型数量激增，如何高效选择最适合下游任务的模型成为挑战。现有方法未能准确捕捉微调动态的非线性特征。

Method: LEAD基于网络输出的logits，提出理论框架建模优化过程，并设计ODE描述非线性演化。同时采用类感知分解方法考虑不同类别的动态差异。

Result: 在24个预训练模型和10个下游数据集上的实验表明，LEAD性能优异，尤其在低数据场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: LEAD通过紧密对齐优化目标和非线性建模，提供了一种高效预测模型迁移性能的解决方案。

Abstract: The remarkable success of pretrain-then-finetune paradigm has led to a
proliferation of available pre-trained models for vision tasks. This surge
presents a significant challenge in efficiently choosing the most suitable
pre-trained models for downstream tasks. The critical aspect of this challenge
lies in effectively predicting the model transferability by considering the
underlying fine-tuning dynamics. Existing methods often model fine-tuning
dynamics in feature space with linear transformations, which do not precisely
align with the fine-tuning objective and fail to grasp the essential
nonlinearity from optimization. To this end, we present LEAD, a
finetuning-aligned approach based on the network output of logits. LEAD
proposes a theoretical framework to model the optimization process and derives
an ordinary differential equation (ODE) to depict the nonlinear evolution
toward the final logit state. Additionally, we design a class-aware
decomposition method to consider the varying evolution dynamics across classes
and further ensure practical applicability. Integrating the closely aligned
optimization objective and nonlinear modeling capabilities derived from the
differential equation, our method offers a concise solution to effectively
bridge the optimization gap in a single step, bypassing the lengthy fine-tuning
process. The comprehensive experiments on 24 supervised and self-supervised
pre-trained models across 10 downstream datasets demonstrate impressive
performances and showcase its broad adaptability even in low-data scenarios.

Result: GAN-based Pix2Pix模型表现最佳，流匹配模型在小数据集上容易过拟合。

Conclusion: GAN更适合实际MRI工作流，流匹配模型需要更多数据以提升性能。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) enables the acquisition of multiple image
contrasts, such as T1-weighted (T1w) and T2-weighted (T2w) scans, each offering
distinct diagnostic insights. However, acquiring all desired modalities
increases scan time and cost, motivating research into computational methods
for cross-modal synthesis. To address this, recent approaches aim to synthesize
missing MRI contrasts from those already acquired, reducing acquisition time
while preserving diagnostic quality. Image-to-image (I2I) translation provides
a promising framework for this task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
benchmark of generative models$\unicode{x2013}$specifically, Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), diffusion models, and flow matching (FM)
techniques$\unicode{x2013}$for T1w-to-T2w 2D MRI I2I translation. All
frameworks are implemented with comparable settings and evaluated on three
publicly available MRI datasets of healthy adults. Our quantitative and
qualitative analyses show that the GAN-based Pix2Pix model outperforms
diffusion and FM-based methods in terms of structural fidelity, image quality,
and computational efficiency. Consistent with existing literature, these
results suggest that flow-based models are prone to overfitting on small
datasets and simpler tasks, and may require more data to match or surpass GAN
performance. These findings offer practical guidance for deploying I2I
translation techniques in real-world MRI workflows and highlight promising
directions for future research in cross-modal medical image synthesis. Code and
models are publicly available at

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in early disease diagnosis and monitoring.
Specifically, blood microscopy offers valuable insights into blood cell
morphology and the detection of hematological disorders. In recent years, deep
learning-based automated classification systems have demonstrated high

classifying blood cell images from the publicly available BloodMNIST dataset.
The study primarily focuses on inference time differences, but also
classification performance for different image sizes. The results reveal
variations in performance across frameworks, influenced by factors such as
image resolution and framework-specific optimizations. Classification accuracy
for JAX and PyTorch was comparable to current benchmarks, showcasing the

Conclusion: Exp-Graph在实验室和真实环境中均表现出强大的泛化能力，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is crucial for human-computer interaction
applications such as face animation, video surveillance, affective computing,
medical analysis, etc. Since the structure of facial attributes varies with
facial expressions, incorporating structural information into facial attributes
is essential for facial expression recognition. In this paper, we propose
Exp-Graph, a novel framework designed to represent the structural relationships
among facial attributes using graph-based modeling for facial expression
recognition. For facial attributes graph representation, facial landmarks are
used as the graph's vertices. At the same time, the edges are determined based
on the proximity of the facial landmark and the similarity of the local
appearance of the facial attributes encoded using the vision transformer.
Additionally, graph convolutional networks are utilized to capture and
integrate these structural dependencies into the encoding of facial attributes,
thereby enhancing the accuracy of expression recognition. Thus, Exp-Graph
learns from the facial attribute graphs highly expressive semantic
representations. On the other hand, the vision transformer and graph
convolutional blocks help the framework exploit the local and global
dependencies among the facial attributes that are essential for the recognition
of facial expressions. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of the proposed
Exp-Graph model on three benchmark datasets: Oulu-CASIA, eNTERFACE05, and AFEW.
The model achieved recognition accuracies of 98.09\%, 79.01\%, and 56.39\%,
respectively. These results indicate that Exp-Graph maintains strong
generalization capabilities across both controlled laboratory settings and
real-world, unconstrained environments, underscoring its effectiveness for
practical facial expression recognition applications.

Conclusion: DD-SAM2为医学视频分割与跟踪提供了高效适配方案，首次系统探索了基于适配器的SAM2微调方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep
learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific
designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a
streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new
opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting
these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets
for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and
the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose
DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a
Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature
extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective
fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike
existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully
exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and
segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation)
and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior
performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best
of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically
exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and
tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at

Motivation: 生成式 AI 的快速发展导致合成媒体内容泛滥，现有单模态检测方法无法应对跨模态合成内容的挑战。

Method: 提出 BusterX++ 框架，结合强化学习后训练策略（多阶段训练、思维奖励、混合推理）消除冷启动问题。

Result: 实验证明 BusterX++ 在跨模态检测中表现优异，GenBuster++ 基准验证了其泛化能力。

Conclusion: BusterX++ 为合成媒体检测提供了高效、可解释的跨模态解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have dramatically improved image and video
synthesis capabilities, significantly increasing the risk of misinformation
through sophisticated fake content. In response, detection methods have evolved
from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic
media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their
single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately,
making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media
formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a novel
framework designed specifically for cross-modal detection and explanation of
synthetic media. Our approach incorporates an advanced reinforcement learning
(RL) post-training strategy that eliminates cold-start. Through Multi-stage
Training, Thinking Reward, and Hybrid Reasoning, BusterX++ achieves stable and
substantial performance improvements. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we
also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a cross-modal benchmark leveraging
state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark
comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts
using a novel filtering methodology to ensure high quality, diversity, and
real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalizability of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于状态空间模型（SSM）的多光谱特征融合框架MS2Fusion，通过双路径参数交互机制实现高效融合，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多光谱特征融合中过度依赖局部互补特征和计算复杂度与感受野大小的权衡问题。

Method: 采用双路径参数交互机制：一路挖掘互补信息，另一路探索跨模态对齐，通过SSM联合优化。

Result: 在多个主流基准测试中表现优异，适用于其他多光谱感知任务。

Conclusion: MS2Fusion具有功能互补性和共享语义空间的优势，展现了其通用性和高效性。

Abstract: Modern multispectral feature fusion for object detection faces two critical
limitations: (1) Excessive preference for local complementary features over
cross-modal shared semantics adversely affects generalization performance; and
(2) The trade-off between the receptive field size and computational complexity
present critical bottlenecks for scalable feature modeling. Addressing these
issues, a novel Multispectral State-Space Feature Fusion framework, dubbed
MS2Fusion, is proposed based on the state space model (SSM), achieving
efficient and effective fusion through a dual-path parametric interaction
mechanism. More specifically, the first cross-parameter interaction branch
inherits the advantage of cross-attention in mining complementary information
with cross-modal hidden state decoding in SSM. The second shared-parameter
branch explores cross-modal alignment with joint embedding to obtain
cross-modal similar semantic features and structures through parameter sharing
in SSM. Finally, these two paths are jointly optimized with SSM for fusing
multispectral features in a unified framework, allowing our MS2Fusion to enjoy
both functional complementarity and shared semantic space. In our extensive
experiments on mainstream benchmarks including FLIR, M3FD and LLVIP, our
MS2Fusion significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art multispectral object
detection methods, evidencing its superiority. Moreover, MS2Fusion is general
and applicable to other multispectral perception tasks. We show that, even
without specific design, MS2Fusion achieves state-of-the-art results on RGB-T
semantic segmentation and RGBT salient object detection, showing its
generality. The source code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统裁判系统存在延迟、主观性和不一致的问题，影响公平性和运动员信任。

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into sports officiating
represents a paradigm shift in how decisions are made in competitive
environments. Traditional manual systems, even when supported by Instant Video
Replay (IVR), often suffer from latency, subjectivity, and inconsistent
enforcement, undermining fairness and athlete trust. This paper introduces
FST.ai, a novel AI-powered framework designed to enhance officiating in Sport
Taekwondo, particularly focusing on the complex task of real-time head kick
detection and scoring. Leveraging computer vision, deep learning, and edge
inference, the system automates the identification and classification of key
actions, significantly reducing decision time from minutes to seconds while
improving consistency and transparency. Importantly, the methodology is not
limited to Taekwondo. The underlying framework -- based on pose estimation,
motion classification, and impact analysis -- can be adapted to a wide range of
sports requiring action detection, such as judo, karate, fencing, or even team
sports like football and basketball, where foul recognition or performance
tracking is critical. By addressing one of Taekwondo's most challenging
scenarios -- head kick scoring -- we demonstrate the robustness, scalability,
and sport-agnostic potential of FST.ai to transform officiating standards
across multiple disciplines.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于计算机视觉的经济高效框架，通过语义分割RGB图像来量化餐后食物浪费，支持数据驱动的可持续发展策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化机构用餐环境中的食物浪费对于制定数据驱动的可持续发展策略至关重要。

Method: 研究使用四种全监督模型（U-Net、U-Net++及其轻量版），通过动态逆频率损失和AdamW优化器训练，评估指标包括像素准确率、Dice、IoU和自定义的DPA指标。

Result: 所有模型表现良好，至少有一种模型对每种食物类型的DPA接近或超过90%，轻量模型在NVIDIA T4 GPU上实现实时推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模食品服务环境中的自动化实时浪费跟踪系统奠定了基础，并为减少机构食物浪费提供了可行方向。

Abstract: Quantifying post-consumer food waste in institutional dining settings is
essential for supporting data-driven sustainability strategies. This study
presents a cost-effective computer vision framework that estimates plate-level
food waste by utilizing semantic segmentation of RGB images taken before and
after meal consumption across five Iranian dishes. Four fully supervised models
(U-Net, U-Net++, and their lightweight variants) were trained using a capped
dynamic inverse-frequency loss and AdamW optimizer, then evaluated through a
comprehensive set of metrics, including Pixel Accuracy, Dice, IoU, and a
custom-defined Distributional Pixel Agreement (DPA) metric tailored to the
task. All models achieved satisfying performance, and for each food type, at
least one model approached or surpassed 90% DPA, demonstrating strong alignment
in pixel-wise proportion estimates. Lighter models with reduced parameter
counts offered faster inference, achieving real-time throughput on an NVIDIA T4
GPU. Further analysis showed superior segmentation performance for dry and more
rigid components (e.g., rice and fries), while more complex, fragmented, or
viscous dishes, such as stews, showed reduced performance, specifically
post-consumption. Despite limitations such as reliance on 2D imaging,
constrained food variety, and manual data collection, the proposed framework is
pioneering and represents a scalable, contactless solution for continuous
monitoring of food consumption. This research lays foundational groundwork for
automated, real-time waste tracking systems in large-scale food service
environments and offers actionable insights and outlines feasible future
directions for dining hall management and policymakers aiming to reduce
institutional food waste.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用组织病理学图像与基因表达的多层次跨模态对齐，限制了预测性能。

Method: 提出Gene-DML框架，通过双路径（多尺度实例级判别和跨级实例-组判别）增强形态与转录模态的对齐。

Result: 在公开空间转录组数据集上，Gene-DML实现了最先进的基因表达预测性能。

Conclusion: Gene-DML通过联合建模细粒度和结构级判别，提升了预测准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurately predicting gene expression from histopathology images offers a
scalable and non-invasive approach to molecular profiling, with significant
implications for precision medicine and computational pathology. However,
existing methods often underutilize the cross-modal representation alignment
between histopathology images and gene expression profiles across multiple
representational levels, thereby limiting their prediction performance. To
address this, we propose Gene-DML, a unified framework that structures latent
space through Dual-pathway Multi-Level discrimination to enhance correspondence
between morphological and transcriptional modalities. The multi-scale
instance-level discrimination pathway aligns hierarchical histopathology
representations extracted at local, neighbor, and global levels with gene
expression profiles, capturing scale-aware morphological-transcriptional
relationships. In parallel, the cross-level instance-group discrimination
pathway enforces structural consistency between individual (image/gene)
instances and modality-crossed (gene/image, respectively) groups, strengthening
the alignment across modalities. By jointly modelling fine-grained and
structural-level discrimination, Gene-DML is able to learn robust cross-modal
representations, enhancing both predictive accuracy and generalization across
diverse biological contexts. Extensive experiments on public spatial
transcriptomics datasets demonstrate that Gene-DML achieves state-of-the-art
performance in gene expression prediction. The code and checkpoints will be
released soon.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在复杂文档理解上表现不佳，缺乏高质量文档级数据集，且RAG方法存在上下文碎片化、多阶段误差累积等问题。

Method: 构建Doc-750K数据集，包含多样化文档结构和跨页依赖关系；开发原生多模态模型Docopilot，不依赖RAG。

Result: Docopilot在文档理解任务中表现出更高的连贯性、准确性和效率。

Conclusion: Docopilot为文档级多模态理解设定了新基准，数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
their performance on complex, multi-page document comprehension remains
inadequate, largely due to the lack of high-quality, document-level datasets.
While current retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods offer partial
solutions, they suffer from issues, such as fragmented retrieval contexts,
multi-stage error accumulation, and extra time costs of retrieval. In this
work, we present a high-quality document-level dataset, Doc-750K, designed to
support in-depth understanding of multimodal documents. This dataset includes
diverse document structures, extensive cross-page dependencies, and real
question-answer pairs derived from the original documents. Building on the
dataset, we develop a native multimodal model, Docopilot, which can accurately
handle document-level dependencies without relying on RAG. Experiments
demonstrate that Docopilot achieves superior coherence, accuracy, and
efficiency in document understanding tasks and multi-turn interactions, setting
a new baseline for document-level multimodal understanding. Data, code, and
models are released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Docopilot

Result: 在多种WSI任务上，WSI-Agents优于现有WSI MLLMs和医疗代理框架。

Conclusion: WSI-Agents通过协作多代理系统显著提升了WSI分析的准确性和多功能性。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) are vital in digital pathology, enabling gigapixel
tissue analysis across various pathological tasks. While recent advancements in
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) allow multi-task WSI analysis through
natural language, they often underperform compared to task-specific models.
Collaborative multi-agent systems have emerged as a promising solution to
balance versatility and accuracy in healthcare, yet their potential remains
underexplored in pathology-specific domains. To address these issues, we
propose WSI-Agents, a novel collaborative multi-agent system for multi-modal
WSI analysis. WSI-Agents integrates specialized functional agents with robust
task allocation and verification mechanisms to enhance both task-specific
accuracy and multi-task versatility through three components: (1) a task
allocation module assigning tasks to expert agents using a model zoo of patch
and WSI level MLLMs, (2) a verification mechanism ensuring accuracy through
internal consistency checks and external validation using pathology knowledge
bases and domain-specific models, and (3) a summary module synthesizing the
final summary with visual interpretation maps. Extensive experiments on
multi-modal WSI benchmarks show WSI-Agents's superiority to current WSI MLLMs
and medical agent frameworks across diverse tasks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MIPD的新框架，通过从多模态大语言模型（MLLM）中蒸馏知识，提升小模型的泛化和零样本能力，解决了复杂Grounded Situation Recognition（GSR）任务中的资源消耗和泛化不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在复杂GSR任务中表现不佳且资源消耗大，而传统GSR模型泛化能力不足，无法识别未见和罕见场景。

Method: 提出MIPD框架，利用LLM生成正负理性信息，通过场景感知和实例感知提示对齐视觉信息，最终将知识蒸馏到学生模型中。

Result: 在Ov-SWiG和HICO-DET数据集上，MIPD在可见、罕见和未见场景中表现优异，提升了未见场景的检测能力。

Conclusion: MIPD通过知识蒸馏显著提升了小模型的泛化和零样本能力，为复杂GSR任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot
abilities but struggle with complex Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) and
are resource-intensive for edge device deployment. Meanwhile, conventional GSR
models often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen
and rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a
teacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot
abilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation
Recognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt
Distillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal
knowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to
recognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.
Specifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental
Rationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze
rationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed
scene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align
rationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the
Negative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively
capturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned
multimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a
stronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding,
bridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction
bias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving
superior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further
demonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.

Conclusion: GTPBD填补了梯田遥感研究的空白，为精细农业地形分析和跨场景知识迁移提供了基础设施。

Abstract: Agricultural parcels serve as basic units for conducting agricultural
practices and applications, which is vital for land ownership registration,
food security assessment, soil erosion monitoring, etc. However, existing
agriculture parcel extraction studies only focus on mid-resolution mapping or
regular plain farmlands while lacking representation of complex terraced
terrains due to the demands of precision agriculture.In this paper, we
introduce a more fine-grained terraced parcel dataset named GTPBD (Global
Terraced Parcel and Boundary Dataset), which is the first fine-grained dataset
covering major worldwide terraced regions with more than 200,000 complex
terraced parcels with manual annotation. GTPBD comprises 47,537 high-resolution
images with three-level labels, including pixel-level boundary labels, mask
labels, and parcel labels. It covers seven major geographic zones in China and
transcontinental climatic regions around the world.Compared to the existing
datasets, the GTPBD dataset brings considerable challenges due to the: (1)
terrain diversity; (2) complex and irregular parcel objects; and (3) multiple
domain styles. Our proposed GTPBD dataset is suitable for four different tasks,
including semantic segmentation, edge detection, terraced parcel extraction,
and unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) tasks.Accordingly, we benchmark the
GTPBD dataset on eight semantic segmentation methods, four edge extraction
methods, three parcel extraction methods, and five UDA methods, along with a
multi-dimensional evaluation framework integrating pixel-level and object-level
metrics. GTPBD fills a critical gap in terraced remote sensing research,
providing a basic infrastructure for fine-grained agricultural terrain analysis
and cross-scenario knowledge transfer.

Conclusion: MultiRetNet可提高早期检测率，降低医疗成本，并减少医疗资源分配不均，促进医疗公平。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness,
affecting over 100 million people worldwide. In the United States, individuals
from lower-income communities face a higher risk of progressing to advanced
stages before diagnosis, largely due to limited access to screening. Comorbid
conditions further accelerate disease progression. We propose MultiRetNet, a
novel pipeline combining retinal imaging, socioeconomic factors, and
comorbidity profiles to improve DR staging accuracy, integrated with a clinical
deferral system for a clinical human-in-the-loop implementation. We experiment
with three multimodal fusion methods and identify fusion through a fully
connected layer as the most versatile methodology. We synthesize adversarial,
low-quality images and use contrastive learning to train the deferral system,
guiding the model to identify out-of-distribution samples that warrant
clinician review. By maintaining diagnostic accuracy on suboptimal images and
integrating critical health data, our system can improve early detection,
particularly in underserved populations where advanced DR is often first
identified. This approach may reduce healthcare costs, increase early detection
rates, and address disparities in access to care, promoting healthcare equity.

Abstract: Traffic monitoring is crucial for urban mobility, road safety, and
intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Deep learning has advanced
video-based traffic monitoring through video question answering (VideoQA)
models, enabling structured insight extraction from traffic videos. However,
existing VideoQA models struggle with the complexity of real-world traffic
scenes, where multiple concurrent events unfold across spatiotemporal
dimensions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \textbf{InterAct
VideoQA}, a curated dataset designed to benchmark and enhance VideoQA models
for traffic monitoring tasks. The InterAct VideoQA dataset comprises 8 hours of
real-world traffic footage collected from diverse intersections, segmented into
10-second video clips, with over 25,000 question-answer (QA) pairs covering
spatiotemporal dynamics, vehicle interactions, incident detection, and other
critical traffic attributes. State-of-the-art VideoQA models are evaluated on
InterAct VideoQA, exposing challenges in reasoning over fine-grained
spatiotemporal dependencies within complex traffic scenarios. Additionally,
fine-tuning these models on InterAct VideoQA yields notable performance
improvements, demonstrating the necessity of domain-specific datasets for

Conclusion: LeAdQA通过精准的视觉定位和因果推理，显著提升了VideoQA的复杂推理能力。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) requires identifying sparse critical
moments in long videos and reasoning about their causal relationships to answer
semantically complex questions. While recent advances in multimodal learning
have improved alignment and fusion, current approaches remain limited by two
prevalent but fundamentally flawed strategies: (1) task-agnostic sampling
indiscriminately processes all frames, overwhelming key events with irrelevant
content; and (2) heuristic retrieval captures superficial patterns but misses
causal-temporal structures needed for complex reasoning. To address these
challenges, we introduce LeAdQA, an innovative approach that bridges these gaps
through synergizing causal-aware query refinement with fine-grained visual
grounding. Our method first leverages LLMs to reformulate question-option
pairs, resolving causal ambiguities and sharpening temporal focus. These
refined queries subsequently direct a temporal grounding model to precisely
retrieve the most salient segments, complemented by an adaptive fusion
mechanism dynamically integrating the evidence to maximize relevance. The
integrated visual-textual cues are then processed by an MLLM to generate
accurate, contextually-grounded answers. Experiments on NExT-QA, IntentQA, and
NExT-GQA demonstrate that our method's precise visual grounding substantially
enhances the understanding of video-question relationships, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on complex reasoning tasks while
maintaining computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著性方法难以捕捉有意义的光谱线索，且全光谱ViTs在高维HSI数据中计算成本过高，导致可解释性不足。

Method: FOCUS引入类特定光谱提示和可学习的[SINK]令牌，通过吸引损失减少噪声注意力，无需梯度反向传播或主干修改。

Result: FOCUS显著提升波段级IoU（15%），减少注意力崩溃（40%），且与专家标注高度一致。

Conclusion: FOCUS以不到1%的参数开销，为高分辨率ViT可解释性提供了实用解决方案，填补了黑盒建模与可信HSI决策之间的空白。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures hundreds of narrow, contiguous
wavelength bands, making it a powerful tool in biology, agriculture, and
environmental monitoring. However, interpreting Vision Transformers (ViTs) in
this setting remains largely unexplored due to two key challenges: (1) existing
saliency methods struggle to capture meaningful spectral cues, often collapsing
attention onto the class token, and (2) full-spectrum ViTs are computationally
prohibitive for interpretability, given the high-dimensional nature of HSI
data. We present FOCUS, the first framework that enables reliable and efficient
spatial-spectral interpretability for frozen ViTs. FOCUS introduces two core
components: class-specific spectral prompts that guide attention toward
semantically meaningful wavelength groups, and a learnable [SINK] token trained
with an attraction loss to absorb noisy or redundant attention. Together, these
designs make it possible to generate stable and interpretable 3D saliency maps
and spectral importance curves in a single forward pass, without any gradient
backpropagation or backbone modification. FOCUS improves band-level IoU by 15
percent, reduces attention collapse by over 40 percent, and produces saliency
results that align closely with expert annotations. With less than 1 percent
parameter overhead, our method makes high-resolution ViT interpretability
practical for real-world hyperspectral applications, bridging a long-standing
gap between black-box modeling and trustworthy HSI decision-making.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于信息互补的下采样方法HPD，用于解决传统下采样在语义分割任务中可能导致关键空间信息丢失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统下采样方法（如最大池化和跨行卷积）在特征聚合、感受野扩展和计算量减少方面表现良好，但在语义分割任务中可能导致关键空间信息丢失，影响逐像素预测精度。

Method: 提出Hybrid Pooling Downsampling (HPD)方法，用MinMaxPooling替代传统方法，通过提取局部区域的最大值信息，有效保留图像的明暗对比和细节特征。

Result: 在ACDC和Synapse数据集上的实验表明，HPD在分割性能上优于传统方法，平均DSC系数提高了0.5%。

Conclusion: HPD模块为语义分割任务提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In convolutional neural networks (CNNs), downsampling operations are crucial
to model performance. Although traditional downsampling methods (such as
maximum pooling and cross-row convolution) perform well in feature aggregation,
receptive field expansion, and computational reduction, they may lead to the
loss of key spatial information in semantic segmentation tasks, thereby
affecting the pixel-by-pixel prediction accuracy.To this end, this study
proposes a downsampling method based on information complementarity - Hybrid
Pooling Downsampling (HPD). The core is to replace the traditional method with
MinMaxPooling, and effectively retain the light and dark contrast and detail
features of the image by extracting the maximum value information of the local
area.Experiment on various CNN architectures on the ACDC and Synapse datasets
show that HPD outperforms traditional methods in segmentation performance, and
increases the DSC coefficient by 0.5% on average. The results show that the HPD

*Beier Zhu,Ruoyu Wang,Tong Zhao,Hanwang Zhang,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EPD的新ODE求解器，通过并行梯度评估减少截断误差，实现高质量低延迟采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型因顺序去噪导致高延迟，现有加速方法在低延迟下图像质量下降。

Method: EPD利用多个并行梯度评估优化ODE步长，并通过蒸馏学习少量参数。

Result: 在5 NFE延迟下，EPD在多个数据集上FID显著优于现有方法（如CIFAR-10为4.47）。

Conclusion: EPD作为插件可提升现有ODE采样器，实现高质量低延迟采样。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved state-of-the-art generative performance
but suffer from high sampling latency due to their sequential denoising nature.
Existing solver-based acceleration methods often face image quality degradation
under a low-latency budget. In this paper, we propose the Ensemble Parallel
Direction solver (dubbed as \ours), a novel ODE solver that mitigates
truncation errors by incorporating multiple parallel gradient evaluations in
each ODE step. Importantly, since the additional gradient computations are
independent, they can be fully parallelized, preserving low-latency sampling.
  Our method optimizes a small set of learnable parameters in a distillation
fashion, ensuring minimal training overhead.
  In addition, our method can serve as a plugin to improve existing ODE
samplers. Extensive experiments on various image synthesis benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our \ours~in achieving high-quality and
low-latency sampling. For example, at the same latency level of 5 NFE, EPD
achieves an FID of 4.47 on CIFAR-10, 7.97 on FFHQ, 8.17 on ImageNet, and 8.26
on LSUN Bedroom, surpassing existing learning-based solvers by a significant
margin. Codes are available in https://github.com/BeierZhu/EPD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了DUSt3R、MASt3R和VGGT三种3D重建基础模型在航拍图像上的表现，发现它们能从极稀疏图像（少于10张）中准确重建密集点云，但高分辨率和大图像集仍存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究这些模型在航拍图像上的潜力，填补其在摄影测量领域的空白。

Method: 在UseGeo数据集的航拍图像上评估预训练的DUSt3R、MASt3R和VGGT模型，进行姿态估计和密集3D重建。

Result: 模型能从极稀疏图像中重建点云，完整性提升达50%，VGGT计算效率更高，但高分辨率和大图像集下姿态估计可靠性下降。

Conclusion: Transformer方法无法完全取代传统SfM和MVS，但在低分辨率和稀疏场景中可作为补充。

Abstract: State-of-the-art 3D computer vision algorithms continue to advance in
handling sparse, unordered image sets. Recently developed foundational models
for 3D reconstruction, such as Dense and Unconstrained Stereo 3D Reconstruction
(DUSt3R), Matching and Stereo 3D Reconstruction (MASt3R), and Visual Geometry
Grounded Transformer (VGGT), have attracted attention due to their ability to
handle very sparse image overlaps. Evaluating DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT on typical
aerial images matters, as these models may handle extremely low image overlaps,
stereo occlusions, and textureless regions. For redundant collections, they can
accelerate 3D reconstruction by using extremely sparsified image sets. Despite
tests on various computer vision benchmarks, their potential on photogrammetric
aerial blocks remains unexplored. This paper conducts a comprehensive
evaluation of the pre-trained DUSt3R/MASt3R/VGGT models on the aerial blocks of
the UseGeo dataset for pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. Results
show these methods can accurately reconstruct dense point clouds from very
sparse image sets (fewer than 10 images, up to 518 pixels resolution), with
completeness gains up to +50% over COLMAP. VGGT also demonstrates higher
computational efficiency, scalability, and more reliable camera pose
estimation. However, all exhibit limitations with high-resolution images and
large sets, as pose reliability declines with more images and geometric
complexity. These findings suggest transformer-based methods cannot fully
replace traditional SfM and MVS, but offer promise as complementary approaches,
especially in challenging, low-resolution, and sparse scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低层视觉任务多样性带来的统一建模挑战。

Method: 设计了包含图像处理主干、提示编码器和提示交互模块的VPIP框架，并开发了统一模型GenLV。

Result: 模型在多任务中表现优异，增加训练任务数量提升了泛化能力，尤其在数据有限的任务中。

Conclusion: VPIP框架有效、可扩展，为通用低层视觉建模提供了统一基础。

Abstract: Low-level vision involves a wide spectrum of tasks, including image
restoration, enhancement, stylization, and feature extraction, which differ
significantly in both task formulation and output domains. To address the
challenge of unified modeling across such diverse tasks, we propose a Visual
task Prompt-based Image Processing (VPIP) framework that leverages input-target
image pairs as visual prompts to guide the model in performing a variety of
low-level vision tasks. The framework comprises an end-to-end image processing
backbone, a prompt encoder, and a prompt interaction module, enabling flexible
integration with various architectures and effective utilization of
task-specific visual representations. Based on this design, we develop a
unified low-level vision model, GenLV, and evaluate its performance across
multiple representative tasks. To explore the scalability of this approach, we
extend the framework along two dimensions: model capacity and task diversity.
We construct a large-scale benchmark consisting of over 100 low-level vision
tasks and train multiple versions of the model with varying scales.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves considerable
performance across a wide range of tasks. Notably, increasing the number of
training tasks enhances generalization, particularly for tasks with limited
data, indicating the model's ability to learn transferable representations
through joint training. Further evaluations in zero-shot generalization,
few-shot transfer, and task-specific fine-tuning scenarios demonstrate the
model's strong adaptability, confirming the effectiveness, scalability, and
potential of the proposed framework as a unified foundation for general
low-level vision modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多脸深度伪造视频在自然社交场景中日益普遍，现有方法因缺乏上下文线索而表现不佳。

Method: 通过人类研究提取四种关键线索，设计HICOM框架，并结合LLM提供可解释性。

Result: HICOM在基准数据集上平均准确率提升3.3%，在未见数据集上优于现有方法5.8%。

Conclusion: 人类因素的引入显著提升了深度伪造检测能力，HICOM具有高准确性和泛化性。

Abstract: Multi-face deepfake videos are becoming increasingly prevalent, often
appearing in natural social settings that challenge existing detection methods.
Most current approaches excel at single-face detection but struggle in
multi-face scenarios, due to a lack of awareness of crucial contextual cues. In
this work, we develop a novel approach that leverages human cognition to
analyze and defend against multi-face deepfake videos. Through a series of
human studies, we systematically examine how people detect deepfake faces in
social settings. Our quantitative analysis reveals four key cues humans rely
on: scene-motion coherence, inter-face appearance compatibility, interpersonal
gaze alignment, and face-body consistency. Guided by these insights, we
introduce \textsf{HICOM}, a novel framework designed to detect every fake face
in multi-face scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that
\textsf{HICOM} improves average accuracy by 3.3\% in in-dataset detection and
2.8\% under real-world perturbations. Moreover, it outperforms existing methods
by 5.8\% on unseen datasets, demonstrating the generalization of human-inspired
cues. \textsf{HICOM} further enhances interpretability by incorporating an LLM
to provide human-readable explanations, making detection results more
transparent and convincing. Our work sheds light on involving human factors to
enhance defense against deepfakes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测未来运动轨迹对机器人、自主系统等领域至关重要，现有视频预测模型计算成本高且延迟大。

Method: 基于InstructPix2Pix模型，结合视觉和文本输入，实现单图像和文本提示的未来帧预测。

Result: 在RoboTWin数据集上，SSIM和PSNR优于现有方法，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量高效，适用于机器人任务和运动轨迹分析，优先考虑轨迹精度而非视觉保真度。

Abstract: Predicting future motion trajectories is a critical capability across domains
such as robotics, autonomous systems, and human activity forecasting, enabling
safer and more intelligent decision-making. This paper proposes a novel,
efficient, and lightweight approach for robot action prediction, offering
significantly reduced computational cost and inference latency compared to
conventional video prediction models. Importantly, it pioneers the adaptation
of the InstructPix2Pix model for forecasting future visual frames in robotic
tasks, extending its utility beyond static image editing. We implement a deep
learning-based visual prediction framework that forecasts what a robot will
observe 100 frames (10 seconds) into the future, given a current image and a
textual instruction. We repurpose and fine-tune the InstructPix2Pix model to
accept both visual and textual inputs, enabling multimodal future frame
prediction. Experiments on the RoboTWin dataset (generated based on real-world
scenarios) demonstrate that our method achieves superior SSIM and PSNR compared
to state-of-the-art baselines in robot action prediction tasks. Unlike
conventional video prediction models that require multiple input frames, heavy
computation, and slow inference latency, our approach only needs a single image
and a text prompt as input. This lightweight design enables faster inference,
reduced GPU demands, and flexible multimodal control, particularly valuable for
applications like robotics and sports motion trajectory analytics, where motion
trajectory precision is prioritized over visual fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型计算成本高，现有后训练量化方法通用性不足，难以适应工业部署需求。

Method: 提出SegQuant框架，包含SegLinear（分段感知的图量化策略）和DualScale（双尺度量化方案），以保留视觉保真度。

Result: SegQuant在Transformer以外的扩散模型中表现优异，兼容主流部署工具。

Conclusion: SegQuant为扩散模型量化提供了通用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated exceptional generative capabilities but
are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for deployment in
resource-constrained or latency-sensitive environments. Quantization offers an
effective means to reduce model size and computational cost, with post-training
quantization (PTQ) being particularly appealing due to its compatibility with
pre-trained models without requiring retraining or training data. However,
existing PTQ methods for diffusion models often rely on architecture-specific
heuristics that limit their generalizability and hinder integration with
industrial deployment pipelines. To address these limitations, we propose
SegQuant, a unified quantization framework that adaptively combines
complementary techniques to enhance cross-model versatility. SegQuant consists
of a segment-aware, graph-based quantization strategy (SegLinear) that captures
structural semantics and spatial heterogeneity, along with a dual-scale
quantization scheme (DualScale) that preserves polarity-asymmetric activations,
which is crucial for maintaining visual fidelity in generated outputs. SegQuant
is broadly applicable beyond Transformer-based diffusion models, achieving
strong performance while ensuring seamless compatibility with mainstream
deployment tools.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in chart
understanding. However, financial charts, characterized by complex temporal
structures and domain-specific terminology, remain notably underexplored. We
introduce FinChart-Bench, the first benchmark specifically focused on
real-world financial charts. FinChart-Bench comprises 1,200 financial chart
images collected from 2015 to 2024, each annotated with True/False (TF),
Multiple Choice (MC), and Question Answering (QA) questions, totaling 7,016
questions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LVLMs
on FinChart-Bench. Our evaluation reveals critical insights: (1) the
performance gap between open-source and closed-source models is narrowing, (2)
performance degradation occurs in upgraded models within families, (3) many
models struggle with instruction following, (4) both advanced models show
significant limitations in spatial reasoning abilities, and (5) current LVLMs
are not reliable enough to serve as automated evaluators. These findings

Result: PHATNet显著提升了现有去雾模型在真实图像数据集上的性能。

Conclusion: PHATNet通过域适应方法有效解决了去雾模型在未见数据上的性能问题。

Abstract: Image dehazing aims to remove unwanted hazy artifacts in images. Although
previous research has collected paired real-world hazy and haze-free images to
improve dehazing models' performance in real-world scenarios, these models
often experience significant performance drops when handling unseen real-world
hazy images due to limited training data. This issue motivates us to develop a
flexible domain adaptation method to enhance dehazing performance during
testing. Observing that predicting haze patterns is generally easier than
recovering clean content, we propose the Physics-guided Haze Transfer Network
(PHATNet) which transfers haze patterns from unseen target domains to
source-domain haze-free images, creating domain-specific fine-tuning sets to
update dehazing models for effective domain adaptation. Additionally, we
introduce a Haze-Transfer-Consistency loss and a Content-Leakage Loss to
enhance PHATNet's disentanglement ability. Experimental results demonstrate
that PHATNet significantly boosts state-of-the-art dehazing models on benchmark
real-world image dehazing datasets.

Abstract: The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images
is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the
high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions,
which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there
is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly
used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges.
First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to
learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality
of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second,
existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding
annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in
supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method.
The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation
of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional
diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices
and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training
process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show
that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions.
Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus
enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法解决了密集标注和多帧依赖问题，提升了深度补全的实用性。

Abstract: Depth completion is an important vision task, and many efforts have been made
to enhance the quality of depth maps from sparse depth measurements. Despite
significant advances, training these models to recover dense depth from sparse
measurements remains a challenging problem. Supervised learning methods rely on
dense depth labels to predict unobserved regions, while self-supervised
approaches require image sequences to enforce geometric constraints and
photometric consistency between frames. However, acquiring dense annotations is
costly, and multi-frame dependencies limit the applicability of self-supervised
methods in static or single-frame scenarios. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel self-supervised depth completion paradigm that requires only
sparse depth measurements and their corresponding image for training. Unlike
existing methods, our approach eliminates the need for dense depth labels or
additional images captured from neighboring viewpoints. By leveraging the
characteristics of depth distribution, we design novel loss functions that
effectively propagate depth information from observed points to unobserved
regions. Additionally, we incorporate segmentation maps generated by vision
foundation models to further enhance depth estimation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: In this work, we propose an all-in-one video restoration framework that
grounds degradation-aware semantic context of video frames in natural language
via foundation models, offering interpretable and flexible guidance. Unlike
prior art, our method assumes no degradation knowledge in train or test time
and learns an approximation to the grounded knowledge such that the foundation
model can be safely disentangled during inference adding no extra cost.
Further, we call for standardization of benchmarks in all-in-one video
restoration, and propose two benchmarks in multi-degradation setting,
three-task (3D) and four-task (4D), and two time-varying composite degradation
benchmarks; one of the latter being our proposed dataset with varying snow
intensity, simulating how weather degradations affect videos naturally. We
compare our method with prior works and report state-of-the-art performance on
all benchmarks.

Conclusion: 该框架在通用和特定领域检测任务中均具有可扩展性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of object detection with a focus on
improving both the localization accuracy of bounding boxes and explicitly
modeling prediction uncertainty. Conventional detectors rely on deterministic
bounding box regression, ignoring uncertainty in predictions and limiting model
robustness. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty-aware enhancement
framework for DETR-based object detectors. We model bounding boxes as
multivariate Gaussian distributions and incorporate the Gromov-Wasserstein
distance into the loss function to better align the predicted and ground-truth
distributions. Building on this, we derive a Bayes Risk formulation to filter
high-risk information and improve detection reliability. We also propose a
simple algorithm to quantify localization uncertainty via confidence intervals.
Experiments on the COCO benchmark show that our method can be effectively
integrated into existing DETR variants, enhancing their performance. We further
extend our framework to leukocyte detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art
results on the LISC and WBCDD datasets. These results confirm the scalability
of our framework across both general and domain-specific detection tasks. Code

Abstract: Micro-gestures are unconsciously performed body gestures that can convey the
emotion states of humans and start to attract more research attention in the
fields of human behavior understanding and affective computing as an emerging
topic. However, the modeling of human emotion based on micro-gestures has not
been explored sufficiently. In this work, we propose to recognize the emotion
states based on the micro-gestures by reconstructing the behavior patterns with
a hypergraph-enhanced Transformer in a hybrid-supervised framework. In the
framework, hypergraph Transformer based encoder and decoder are separately
designed by stacking the hypergraph-enhanced self-attention and multiscale
temporal convolution modules. Especially, to better capture the subtle motion
of micro-gestures, we construct a decoder with additional upsampling operations
for a reconstruction task in a self-supervised learning manner. We further
propose a hypergraph-enhanced self-attention module where the hyperedges
between skeleton joints are gradually updated to present the relationships of
body joints for modeling the subtle local motion. Lastly, for exploiting the
relationship between the emotion states and local motion of micro-gestures, an
emotion recognition head from the output of encoder is designed with a shallow
architecture and learned in a supervised way. The end-to-end framework is
jointly trained in a one-stage way by comprehensively utilizing
self-reconstruction and supervision information. The proposed method is
evaluated on two publicly available datasets, namely iMiGUE and SMG, and
achieves the best performance under multiple metrics, which is superior to the
existing methods.

Abstract: In recent years, the emergence of foundation models for depth prediction has
led to remarkable progress, particularly in zero-shot monocular depth
estimation. These models generate impressive depth predictions; however, their
outputs are often in relative scale rather than metric scale. This limitation
poses challenges for direct deployment in real-world applications. To address
this, several scale adaptation methods have been proposed to enable foundation
models to produce metric depth. However, these methods are typically costly, as
they require additional training on new domains and datasets. Moreover,
fine-tuning these models often compromises their original generalization
capabilities, limiting their adaptability across diverse scenes. In this paper,
we introduce a non-learning-based approach that leverages sparse depth
measurements to adapt the relative-scale predictions of foundation models into
metric-scale depth. Our method requires neither retraining nor fine-tuning,
thereby preserving the strong generalization ability of the original foundation
models while enabling them to produce metric depth. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, high-lighting its potential to
bridge the gap between relative and metric depth without incurring additional
computational costs or sacrificing generalization ability.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) captures cardiac signals from facial
videos and is gaining attention for its diverse applications. While deep
learning has advanced rPPG estimation, it relies on large, diverse datasets for
effective generalization. In contrast, handcrafted methods utilize
physiological priors for better generalization in unseen scenarios like motion
while maintaining computational efficiency. However, their linear assumptions
limit performance in complex conditions, where deep learning provides superior
pulsatile information extraction. This highlights the need for hybrid
approaches that combine the strengths of both methods. To address this, we
present BeatFormer, a lightweight spectral attention model for rPPG estimation,
which integrates zoomed orthonormal complex attention and frequency-domain
energy measurement, enabling a highly efficient model. Additionally, we
introduce Spectral Contrastive Learning (SCL), which allows BeatFormer to be
trained without any PPG or HR labels. We validate BeatFormer on the PURE,
UBFC-rPPG, and MMPD datasets, demonstrating its robustness and performance,
particularly in cross-dataset evaluations under motion scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多模态分离编码器，导致模型复杂且训练效率低。

Conclusion: 统一的多模态框架显著简化了模型，同时提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: 3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information
in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for
embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on
separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D
point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to
train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP
for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D
encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for
feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training
inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal
network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),
significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal
model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the
tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across
modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module
is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and
images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and
introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding.
Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the
three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to
the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by
approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection
task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.

Motivation: 现有方法（如注意力机制或图卷积网络）在图像表示中可能包含噪声且定位不精确，因此需要更精确的语义表示方法。

Method: 1. 使用标签语义相关特征学习模块提取语义特征；2. 设计基于最优传输的注意力机制实现语义对齐；3. 采用区域分数聚合策略进行多标签预测。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2007和MS-COCO数据集上的实验表明，SARL优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SARL通过语义感知表示学习，显著提升了多标签图像分类的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-label image classification, an important research area in computer
vision, focuses on identifying multiple labels or concepts within an image.
Existing approaches often employ attention mechanisms or graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) to learn image representation. However, this representation may
contain noise and may not locate objects precisely. Therefore, this paper
proposes a Semantic-Aware Representation Learning (SARL) for multi-label image
classification. First, a label semantic-related feature learning module is
utilized to extract semantic-related features. Then, an optimal transport-based
attention mechanism is designed to obtain semantically aligned image
representation. Finally, a regional score aggregation strategy is used for
multi-label prediction. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL
VOC 2007 and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of SARL over existing
methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D高斯几何和外观预测上耦合度高，依赖数据驱动先验且回归速度慢，计算资源需求大。

Method: 通过立体视觉骨干提取局部图像对特征，全局注意力块融合特征，专用头生成几何和外观特征，结合为GS-maps表示3DGS对象，并通过细化网络提升重建质量。

Result: 实现了无需相机参数的姿态无关3D重建，提高了鲁棒性和实用性，同时降低了资源需求。

Conclusion: \method为实际3D内容生成提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting reconstruction showcases advanced
Image-to-3D content creation but requires substantial computational resources
and large datasets, posing challenges to training models from scratch. Current
methods usually entangle the prediction of 3D Gaussian geometry and appearance,
which rely heavily on data-driven priors and result in slow regression speeds.
To address this, we propose \method, a disentangled framework for efficient 3D
Gaussian prediction. Our method extracts features from local image pairs using
a stereo vision backbone and fuses them via global attention blocks. Dedicated
point and Gaussian prediction heads generate multi-view point-maps for geometry
and Gaussian features for appearance, combined as GS-maps to represent the 3DGS
object. A refinement network enhances these GS-maps for high-quality
reconstruction. Unlike existing methods that depend on camera parameters, our
approach achieves pose-free 3D reconstruction, improving robustness and
practicality. By reducing resource demands while maintaining high-quality
outputs, \method provides an efficient, scalable solution for real-world 3D
content generation.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多维尺度分析（MDS）的稳健方法，用于冷冻电镜中的姿态估计和位移校正，通过鲁棒优化和迭代位移校正提高3D重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜中极低的信噪比（SNR）导致姿态估计和位移校正困难，直接影响3D重建的准确性。现有方法对噪声敏感且约束条件处理不完善，导致误差累积。

Method: 采用MDS技术从二面角对估计3D旋转矩阵，提出鲁棒联合优化框架（基于ℓ1范数）和迭代位移校正算法，严格满足单位范数和正交约束。

Result: 方法在欧拉角精度和重建保真度（通过FSC衡量）上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过鲁棒优化和全局最小二乘位移校正，显著提升了低SNR条件下的冷冻电镜3D重建质量。

Abstract: Accurate pose estimation and shift correction are key challenges in cryo-EM
due to the very low SNR, which directly impacts the fidelity of 3D
reconstructions. We present an approach for pose estimation in cryo-EM that
leverages multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques in a robust manner to
estimate the 3D rotation matrix of each particle from pairs of dihedral angles.
We express the rotation matrix in the form of an axis of rotation and a unit
vector in the plane perpendicular to the axis. The technique leverages the
concept of common lines in 3D reconstruction from projections. However, common
line estimation is ridden with large errors due to the very low SNR of cryo-EM
projection images. To address this challenge, we introduce two complementary
components: (i) a robust joint optimization framework for pose estimation based
on an $\ell_1$-norm objective or a similar robust norm, which simultaneously
estimates rotation axes and in-plane vectors while exactly enforcing unit norm
and orthogonality constraints via projected coordinate descent; and (ii) an
iterative shift correction algorithm that estimates consistent in-plane
translations through a global least-squares formulation. While prior approaches
have leveraged such embeddings and common-line geometry for orientation
recovery, existing formulations typically rely on $\ell_2$-based objectives
that are sensitive to noise, and enforce geometric constraints only
approximately. These choices, combined with a sequential pipeline structure,
can lead to compounding errors and suboptimal reconstructions in low-SNR
regimes. Our pipeline consistently outperforms prior methods in both Euler
angle accuracy and reconstruction fidelity, as measured by the Fourier Shell
Correlation (FSC).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学图像分类中，标记数据稀缺，MIL方法通过注意力机制聚合实例级表示，但现有方法通常确定性处理注意力值，忽略了实例贡献的不确定性。

Method: 提出了一种概率框架，估计注意力值的概率分布，同时考虑全局和局部交互。

Result: 在三个医学数据集和十一种基线方法的全面评估中，该方法在多个指标上表现最佳，并提供可解释的不确定性图。

Conclusion: 该概率框架不仅提升了预测性能，还通过不确定性图增强了疾病定位的可解释性。

Abstract: The Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) paradigm is attracting plenty of
attention in medical imaging classification, where labeled data is scarce. MIL
methods cast medical images as bags of instances (e.g. patches in whole slide
images, or slices in CT scans), and only bag labels are required for training.
Deep MIL approaches have obtained promising results by aggregating
instance-level representations via an attention mechanism to compute the
bag-level prediction. These methods typically capture both local interactions
among adjacent instances and global, long-range dependencies through various
mechanisms. However, they treat attention values deterministically, potentially
overlooking uncertainty in the contribution of individual instances. In this
work we propose a novel probabilistic framework that estimates a probability
distribution over the attention values, and accounts for both global and local
interactions. In a comprehensive evaluation involving {\color{review} eleven}
state-of-the-art baselines and three medical datasets, we show that our
approach achieves top predictive performance in different metrics. Moreover,
the probabilistic treatment of the attention provides uncertainty maps that are
interpretable in terms of illness localization.

Conclusion: MICU方法在开放集跨模态泛化任务中表现出色，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: This paper extends Cross Modal Generalization (CMG) to open-set environments
by proposing the more challenging Open-set Cross Modal Generalization (OSCMG)
task. This task evaluates multimodal unified representations in open-set
conditions, addressing the limitations of prior closed-set cross-modal
evaluations. OSCMG requires not only cross-modal knowledge transfer but also
robust generalization to unseen classes within new modalities, a scenario
frequently encountered in real-world applications. Existing multimodal unified
representation work lacks consideration for open-set environments. To tackle
this, we propose MICU, comprising two key components: Fine-Coarse Masked
multimodal InfoNCE (FCMI) and Cross modal Unified Jigsaw Puzzles (CUJP). FCMI
enhances multimodal alignment by applying contrastive learning at both holistic
semantic and temporal levels, incorporating masking to enhance generalization.
CUJP enhances feature diversity and model uncertainty by integrating
modality-agnostic feature selection with self-supervised learning, thereby
strengthening the model's ability to handle unknown categories in open-set
tasks. Extensive experiments on CMG and the newly proposed OSCMG validate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code is available at

Motivation: 嵌入式设备计算和能源预算有限，但视频流具有标签稀疏性、时间连续性和标签共现性等特性，可优化推理效率。

Method: 引入Polymorph框架，动态选择和组合轻量级LoRA适配器，避免全模型切换和权重合并。

Result: 在TAO数据集上，能耗降低40%，mAP提升9个百分点。

Conclusion: Polymorph通过模块化策略显著提升嵌入式设备上的实时多标签视频分类效率。

Abstract: Real-time multi-label video classification on embedded devices is constrained
by limited compute and energy budgets. Yet, video streams exhibit structural
properties such as label sparsity, temporal continuity, and label co-occurrence
that can be leveraged for more efficient inference. We introduce Polymorph, a
context-aware framework that activates a minimal set of lightweight Low Rank
Adapters (LoRA) per frame. Each adapter specializes in a subset of classes
derived from co-occurrence patterns and is implemented as a LoRA weight over a
shared backbone. At runtime, Polymorph dynamically selects and composes only
the adapters needed to cover the active labels, avoiding full-model switching
and weight merging. This modular strategy improves scalability while reducing
latency and energy overhead. Polymorph achieves 40% lower energy consumption
and improves mAP by 9 points over strong baselines on the TAO dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标（如最大内点计数）在极低内点比例下失效，因此需要一种新的方法来可靠评估配准质量。

Method: 构建基于3DMatch的数据集，训练深度学习分类器评估配准质量，并将其集成到标准PCR流程中。

Result: 结合GeoTransformer，在3DLoMatch基准上达到86.97%的配准召回率，并在ETH数据集上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 提出的数据驱动方法首次通过深度学习框架解决了决策PCR任务，显著提升了配准性能。

Abstract: Low-overlap point cloud registration (PCR) remains a significant challenge in
3D vision. Traditional evaluation metrics, such as Maximum Inlier Count, become
ineffective under extremely low inlier ratios. In this paper, we revisit the
registration result evaluation problem and identify the Decision version of the
PCR task as the fundamental problem. To address this Decision PCR task, we
propose a data-driven approach. First, we construct a corresponding dataset
based on the 3DMatch dataset. Then, a deep learning-based classifier is trained
to reliably assess registration quality, overcoming the limitations of
traditional metrics. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study to
address this task through a deep learning framework. We incorporate this
classifier into standard PCR pipelines. When integrated with our approach,
existing state-of-the-art PCR methods exhibit significantly enhanced
registration performance. For example, combining our framework with
GeoTransformer achieves a new SOTA registration recall of 86.97\% on the
challenging 3DLoMatch benchmark. Our method also demonstrates strong
generalization capabilities on the unseen outdoor ETH dataset.

Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在下游任务中难以保持泛化能力，现有提示学习方法存在模态隔离和层次语义衰减的瓶颈。

Method: 提出HiCroPL框架，通过分层知识映射器和轻量级层特定知识代理，实现文本与视觉模态的双向知识流，优化语义表示。

Result: 在四个任务和11个基准测试中取得最优性能，显著提升模型表现。

Conclusion: HiCroPL通过分层跨模态交互有效解决了预训练模型的泛化问题，为视觉语言任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have shown excellent
generalization abilities. However, adapting these large-scale models to
downstream tasks while preserving their generalization capabilities remains
challenging. Although prompt learning methods have shown promise, they suffer
from two fundamental bottlenecks that limit generalization: (a) modality
isolation, and (b) hierarchical semantic decay. To address these limitations,
we propose HiCroPL, a Hierarchical Cross-modal Prompt Learning framework that
establishes bidirectional knowledge flow between text and vision modalities,
enabling them to refine their semantics mutually. HiCroPL routes knowledge
flows by leveraging the complementary strengths of text and vision. In early
layers, text prompts inject relatively clear semantics into visual prompts
through a hierarchical knowledge mapper, enhancing the representation of
low-level visual semantics. In later layers, visual prompts encoding specific
task-relevant objects flow back to refine text prompts, enabling deeper
alignment. Crucially, our hierarchical knowledge mapper allows representations
at multi-scales to be fused, ensuring that deeper representations retain
transferable shallow semantics thereby enhancing generalization. We further
introduce a lightweight layer-specific knowledge proxy to enable efficient
cross-modal interactions. Extensive evaluations across four tasks demonstrate
HiCroPL's superior performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on 11
benchmarks with significant improvements. Code is available at:

Conclusion: 语义提示和多模态理解的结合对提升回归任务性能至关重要，RvTC方法为图像评估任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for image-based
regression tasks, but current approaches face key limitations. Recent methods
fine-tune MLLMs using preset output vocabularies and generic task-level prompts
(e.g., "How would you rate this image?"), assuming this mimics human rating
behavior. Our analysis reveals these approaches provide no benefit over
image-only training. Models using preset vocabularies and generic prompts
perform equivalently to image-only models, failing to leverage semantic
understanding from textual input. We propose Regression via Transformer-Based
Classification (RvTC), which replaces vocabulary-constrained classification
with a flexible bin-based approach. Unlike approaches that address
discretization errors through complex distributional modeling, RvTC eliminates
manual vocabulary crafting through straightforward bin increase, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on four image assessment datasets using only
images. More importantly, we demonstrate that data-specific prompts
dramatically improve performance. Unlike generic task descriptions, prompts
containing semantic information about specific images enable MLLMs to leverage
cross-modal understanding. On the AVA dataset, adding challenge titles to
prompts improves correlations from 0.83 to 0.90, a new state-of-the-art. We
demonstrate through empirical evidence from the AVA and AGIQA-3k datasets that
MLLMs benefit from semantic prompt information surpassing mere statistical
biases. This underscores the importance of incorporating meaningful textual
context in multimodal regression tasks.

Conclusion: 轴对齐几何约束和预处理策略有效提升了文档去扭曲的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Document dewarping is crucial for many applications. However, existing
learning-based methods primarily rely on supervised regression with annotated
data without leveraging the inherent geometric properties in physical documents
to the dewarping process. Our key insight is that a well-dewarped document is
characterized by transforming distorted feature lines into axis-aligned ones.
This property aligns with the inherent axis-aligned nature of the discrete grid
geometry in planar documents. In the training phase, we propose an axis-aligned
geometric constraint to enhance document dewarping. In the inference phase, we
propose an axis alignment preprocessing strategy to reduce the dewarping
difficulty. In the evaluation phase, we introduce a new metric, Axis-Aligned
Distortion (AAD), that not only incorporates geometric meaning and aligns with
human visual perception but also demonstrates greater robustness. As a result,
our method achieves SOTA results on multiple existing benchmarks and achieves
18.2%~34.5% improvements on the AAD metric.

Conclusion: 通过改进FastSAM的边缘质量，该方法增强了其在工业自动化、医疗成像和自主系统等实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Accurately identifying and representing object edges is a challenging task in
computer vision and image processing. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has
significantly influenced the field of image segmentation, but suffers from high
memory consumption and long inference times, limiting its efficiency in
real-time applications. To address these limitations, Fast Segment Anything
(FastSAM) was proposed, achieving real-time segmentation. However, FastSAM
often generates jagged edges that deviate from the true object shapes.
Therefore, this paper introduces a novel refinement approach using B-Spline
curve fitting techniques to enhance the edge quality in FastSAM. Leveraging the
robust shape control and flexible geometric construction of B-Splines, a
four-stage refining process involving two rounds of curve fitting is employed
to effectively smooth jagged edges. This approach significantly improves the
visual quality and analytical accuracy of object edges without compromising
critical geometric information. The proposed method improves the practical
utility of FastSAM by improving segmentation accuracy while maintaining
real-time processing capabilities. This advancement unlocks greater potential
for FastSAM technology in various real-world scenarios, such as industrial
automation, medical imaging, and autonomous systems, where precise and
efficient edge recognition is crucial.

Abstract: Human intelligence requires correctness and robustness, with the former being
foundational for the latter. In video understanding, correctness ensures the
accurate interpretation of visual content, and robustness maintains consistent
performance in challenging conditions. Despite advances in video large language
models (video LLMs), existing benchmarks inadequately reflect the gap between
these models and human intelligence in maintaining correctness and robustness
in video interpretation. We introduce the Video Thinking Test (Video-TT), to
assess if video LLMs can interpret real-world videos as effectively as humans.
Video-TT reflects genuine gaps in understanding complex visual narratives, and
evaluates robustness against natural adversarial questions. Video-TT comprises
1,000 YouTube Shorts videos, each with one open-ended question and four

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of wave equations is crucial in
computational wave imaging applications, such as ultrasound computed tomography
(USCT), which reconstructs tissue material properties from observed scattered
waves. Traditional numerical solvers for wave equations are computationally
intensive and often unstable, limiting their practical applications for
quasi-real-time image reconstruction. Neural operators offer an innovative
approach by accelerating PDE solving using neural networks; however, their
effectiveness in realistic imaging is limited because existing datasets
oversimplify real-world complexity. In this paper, we present OpenBreastUS, a
large-scale wave equation dataset designed to bridge the gap between
theoretical equations and practical imaging applications. OpenBreastUS includes
8,000 anatomically realistic human breast phantoms and over 16 million
frequency-domain wave simulations using real USCT configurations. It enables a
comprehensive benchmarking of popular neural operators for both forward
simulation and inverse imaging tasks, allowing analysis of their performance,
scalability, and generalization capabilities. By offering a realistic and
extensive dataset, OpenBreastUS not only serves as a platform for developing
innovative neural PDE solvers but also facilitates their deployment in
real-world medical imaging problems. For the first time, we demonstrate
efficient in vivo imaging of the human breast using neural operator solvers.

Abstract: Underwater image enhancement is vital for marine conservation, particularly
coral reef monitoring. However, AI-based enhancement models often face dataset
bias, high computational costs, and lack of transparency, leading to potential
misinterpretations. This paper introduces EBA-AI, an ethics-guided bias-aware
AI framework to address these challenges. EBA-AI leverages CLIP embeddings to
detect and mitigate dataset bias, ensuring balanced representation across
varied underwater environments. It also integrates adaptive processing to
optimize energy efficiency, significantly reducing GPU usage while maintaining
competitive enhancement quality. Experiments on LSUI400, Oceanex, and UIEB100
show that while PSNR drops by a controlled 1.0 dB, computational savings enable
real-time feasibility for large-scale marine monitoring. Additionally,
uncertainty estimation and explainability techniques enhance trust in AI-driven
environmental decisions. Comparisons with CycleGAN, FunIEGAN, RAUNENet,
WaterNet, UGAN, PUGAN, and UTUIE validate EBA-AI's effectiveness in balancing
efficiency, fairness, and interpretability in underwater image processing. By
addressing key limitations of AI-driven enhancement, this work contributes to
sustainable, bias-aware, and computationally efficient marine conservation
efforts. For interactive visualizations, animations, source code, and access to

TL;DR: OmniVTON提出了一种无需训练的通用虚拟试穿框架，通过分离服装和姿态条件，实现跨场景的高保真纹理和姿态一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有虚拟试穿技术中监督方法泛化能力差和无监督方法数据偏差的问题，提出一种统一的解决方案。

Method: 采用服装先验生成机制和连续边界缝合技术保留细节，利用DDIM反演实现精确姿态对齐。

Result: 实验表明OmniVTON在多样化数据集和场景中表现优异，首次实现多人物虚拟试穿。

Conclusion: OmniVTON通过解耦服装和姿态约束，成为首个跨场景通用的虚拟试穿框架。

Abstract: Image-based Virtual Try-On (VTON) techniques rely on either supervised
in-shop approaches, which ensure high fidelity but struggle with cross-domain
generalization, or unsupervised in-the-wild methods, which improve adaptability
but remain constrained by data biases and limited universality. A unified,
training-free solution that works across both scenarios remains an open
challenge. We propose OmniVTON, the first training-free universal VTON
framework that decouples garment and pose conditioning to achieve both texture
fidelity and pose consistency across diverse settings. To preserve garment
details, we introduce a garment prior generation mechanism that aligns clothing
with the body, followed by continuous boundary stitching technique to achieve
fine-grained texture retention. For precise pose alignment, we utilize DDIM
inversion to capture structural cues while suppressing texture interference,
ensuring accurate body alignment independent of the original image textures. By
disentangling garment and pose constraints, OmniVTON eliminates the bias
inherent in diffusion models when handling multiple conditions simultaneously.
Experimental results demonstrate that OmniVTON achieves superior performance
across diverse datasets, garment types, and application scenarios. Notably, it
is the first framework capable of multi-human VTON, enabling realistic garment
transfer across multiple individuals in a single scene. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出PanTiny，一种轻量级单步全色锐化框架，通过多数据集联合训练和复合损失函数，实现高效且泛化性强的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前全色锐化领域倾向于大而复杂的模型，但计算开销高且泛化性差，本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出PanTiny框架，采用多数据集联合训练（WV2、WV3、GF2）和复合损失函数。

Result: PanTiny在性能和效率上优于大型专用模型，泛化能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过模型设计、训练范式和损失函数的优化，可以超越暴力扩展，推动全色锐化领域向高效、泛化性强和数据敏感的方向发展。

Abstract: The field of pan-sharpening has recently seen a trend towards increasingly
large and complex models, often trained on single, specific satellite datasets.
This approach, however, leads to high computational overhead and poor
generalization on full resolution data, a paradigm we challenge in this paper.
In response to this issue, we propose PanTiny, a lightweight, single-step
pan-sharpening framework designed for both efficiency and robust performance.
More critically, we introduce multiple-in-one training paradigm, where a
single, compact model is trained simultaneously on three distinct satellite
datasets (WV2, WV3, and GF2) with different resolution and spectral
information. Our experiments show that this unified training strategy not only
simplifies deployment but also significantly boosts generalization on
full-resolution data. Further, we introduce a universally powerful composite
loss function that elevates the performance of almost all of models for
pan-sharpening, pushing state-of-the-art metrics into a new era. Our PanTiny
model, benefiting from these innovations, achieves a superior
performance-to-efficiency balance, outperforming most larger, specialized
models. Through extensive ablation studies, we validate that principled
engineering in model design, training paradigms, and loss functions can surpass
brute-force scaling. Our work advocates for a community-wide shift towards
creating efficient, generalizable, and data-conscious models for
pan-sharpening. The code is available at

TL;DR: StableAnimator++ 是一种基于视频扩散模型的框架，通过可学习的姿态对齐和身份保持技术，解决了现有方法在人体图像动画中身份一致性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人体图像动画扩散模型在参考图像和驱动视频差异较大时难以保持身份一致性，因此需要一种更有效的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: StableAnimator++ 结合了可学习的姿态对齐模块、图像和面部嵌入编码器、分布感知的身份适配器，并在推理阶段引入了基于 HJB 的面部优化方法。

Result: 实验表明，StableAnimator++ 在定性和定量上均表现出色，能够生成高质量且身份一致的动画视频。

Conclusion: StableAnimator++ 通过创新的姿态对齐和身份保持技术，显著提升了人体图像动画的身份一致性，为相关领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current diffusion models for human image animation often struggle to maintain
identity (ID) consistency, especially when the reference image and driving
video differ significantly in body size or position. We introduce
StableAnimator++, the first ID-preserving video diffusion framework with
learnable pose alignment, capable of generating high-quality videos conditioned
on a reference image and a pose sequence without any post-processing. Building
upon a video diffusion model, StableAnimator++ contains carefully designed
modules for both training and inference, striving for identity consistency. In
particular, StableAnimator++ first uses learnable layers to predict the
similarity transformation matrices between the reference image and the driven
poses via injecting guidance from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). These
matrices align the driven poses with the reference image, mitigating
misalignment to a great extent. StableAnimator++ then computes image and face
embeddings using off-the-shelf encoders, refining the face embeddings via a
global content-aware Face Encoder. To further maintain ID, we introduce a
distribution-aware ID Adapter that counteracts interference caused by temporal
layers while preserving ID via distribution alignment. During the inference
stage, we propose a novel Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) based face optimization
integrated into the denoising process, guiding the diffusion trajectory for
enhanced facial fidelity. Experiments on benchmarks show the effectiveness of
StableAnimator++ both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Method: 通过33个代表性OCR任务评估6个模型，涵盖文档、手写文本、场景文本、艺术文本和复杂布局文本。

Result: 识别了当前生成模型在OCR任务中的弱点，强调了逼真文本图像生成的重要性。

Conclusion: 应将逼真文本图像生成内化为通用生成模型的基础技能，而非依赖专用解决方案。

Abstract: Text image is a unique and crucial information medium that integrates visual
aesthetics and linguistic semantics in modern e-society. Due to their subtlety
and complexity, the generation of text images represents a challenging and
evolving frontier in the image generation field. The recent surge of
specialized image generators (\emph{e.g.}, Flux-series) and unified generative
models (\emph{e.g.}, GPT-4o), which demonstrate exceptional fidelity, raises a
natural question: can they master the intricacies of text image generation and
editing? Motivated by this, we assess current state-of-the-art generative
models' capabilities in terms of text image generation and editing. We
incorporate various typical optical character recognition (OCR) tasks into our
evaluation and broaden the concept of text-based generation tasks into OCR
generative tasks. We select 33 representative tasks and categorize them into
five categories: document, handwritten text, scene text, artistic text, and
complex \& layout-rich text. For comprehensive evaluation, we examine six
models across both closed-source and open-source domains, using tailored,
high-quality image inputs and prompts. Through this evaluation, we draw crucial
observations and identify the weaknesses of current generative models for OCR
tasks. We argue that photorealistic text image generation and editing should be
internalized as foundational skills into general-domain generative models,
rather than being delegated to specialized solutions, and we hope this
empirical analysis can provide valuable insights for the community to achieve
this goal. This evaluation is online and will be continuously updated at our
GitHub repository.

Motivation: 无人机视觉地点识别（vPR）面临大规模高空数据集稀缺和图像旋转模糊的挑战，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 引入LASED大规模数据集，并提出使用可转向CNN处理旋转方差，增强特征表示的旋转不变性。

Result: 实验表明，LASED训练模型召回率显著提升，可转向CNN比传统CNN平均提高12%的召回率。

Conclusion: 结合大规模数据集和旋转等变神经网络，显著提升了无人机vPR的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (vPR) plays a crucial role in Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) navigation, enabling robust localization across diverse
environments. Despite significant advancements, aerial vPR faces unique
challenges due to the limited availability of large-scale, high-altitude
datasets, which limits model generalization, along with the inherent rotational
ambiguity in UAV imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce LASED, a
large-scale aerial dataset with approximately one million images,
systematically sampled from 170,000 unique locations throughout Estonia over a
decade, offering extensive geographic and temporal diversity. Its structured
design ensures clear place separation significantly enhancing model training
for aerial scenarios. Furthermore, we propose the integration of steerable
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explicitly handle rotational variance,
leveraging their inherent rotational equivariance to produce robust,
orientation-invariant feature representations. Our extensive benchmarking
demonstrates that models trained on LASED achieve significantly higher recall
compared to those trained on smaller, less diverse datasets, highlighting the
benefits of extensive geographic coverage and temporal diversity. Moreover,
steerable CNNs effectively address rotational ambiguity inherent in aerial
imagery, consistently outperforming conventional convolutional architectures,
achieving on average 12\% recall improvement over the best-performing
non-steerable network. By combining structured, large-scale datasets with
rotation-equivariant neural networks, our approach significantly enhances model
robustness and generalization for aerial vPR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ESD手术中出血源的实时定位和持续监测对止血干预至关重要，但现有AI方法仅关注出血区域分割，缺乏对出血源准确检测和动态跟踪的研究，且缺乏专用数据集。

Method: 引入BleedOrigin-Bench数据集，包含专家标注的出血源数据；提出BleedOrigin-Net双阶段框架，结合检测和跟踪技术。

Result: 实验显示，BleedOrigin-Net在出血起始检测、初始源定位和点跟踪方面均达到最先进性能，准确率分别为96.85%、70.24%和96.11%。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了ESD出血源检测和跟踪的空白，为AI辅助手术提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses
significant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous
monitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In
particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only
milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs
operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence
(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the
critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in
the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual
obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of
specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance
systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first
comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated
bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with
39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6
challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel
dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in
ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection
to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection
models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking
methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset
detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source
detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.

Conclusion: LoopNet为SLAM闭环问题提供了高效解决方案，并开源了代码和数据集。

Abstract: One of the main challenges in the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) loop closure problem is the recognition of previously visited places. In
this work, we tackle the two main problems of real-time SLAM systems: 1) loop
closure detection accuracy and 2) real-time computation constraints on the
embedded hardware. Our LoopNet method is based on a multitasking variant of the
classical ResNet architecture, adapted for online retraining on a dynamic
visual dataset and optimized for embedded devices. The online retraining is
designed using a few-shot learning approach. The architecture provides both an
index into the queried visual dataset, and a measurement of the prediction
quality. Moreover, by leveraging DISK (DIStinctive Keypoints) descriptors,
LoopNet surpasses the limitations of handcrafted features and traditional deep
learning methods, offering better performance under varying conditions. Code is
available at https://github.com/RovisLab/LoopNet. Additinally, we introduce a
new loop closure benchmarking dataset, coined LoopDB, which is available at

Result: 在COIN和CrossTask数据集上分别提升7.3%和3.4%，在Ego4D任务中表现与最优方法相当。

Conclusion: VideoPlan通过创新方法有效提升视觉规划性能，未来可扩展至更复杂任务。

Abstract: Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) aims to predict a sequence of user
actions required to achieve a specified goal based on a video showing the
user's progress. Although recent advances in multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon
visual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in
training large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural
annotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics
effectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to
explicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when
compared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce
Auxiliary Task Augmentation. We design and train our model on auxiliary tasks
relevant to long-horizon video-based planning (e.g., goal prediction) to
augment the model's planning ability. To more explicitly model the structured
action space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token
Prediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads
to predict multiple future tokens during training. Our approach, VideoPlan,
achieves state-of-the-art VPA performance on the COIN and CrossTask datasets,
surpassing prior methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively, when predicting 3
future actions. We further extend our method to the challenging Ego4D Long-term
Action Anticipation task, and show that it is on par with the state-of-the-art
approaches despite not using specialized egocentric features. Code will be made
available.

Result: 在Gen1和eTraM数据集上，检测精度提升6%，速度提升5倍，参数减少且计算成本未增加。

Conclusion: 结构化图建模在异步视觉任务中表现出高效性和优越性。

Abstract: Event-based sensors offer high temporal resolution and low latency by
generating sparse, asynchronous data. However, converting this irregular data
into dense tensors for use in standard neural networks diminishes these
inherent advantages, motivating research into graph representations. While such
methods preserve sparsity and support asynchronous inference, their performance
on downstream tasks remains limited due to suboptimal modeling of
spatiotemporal dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel spatiotemporal
multigraph representation to better capture spatial structure and temporal
changes. Our approach constructs two decoupled graphs: a spatial graph
leveraging B-spline basis functions to model global structure, and a temporal
graph utilizing motion vector-based attention for local dynamic changes. This
design enables the use of efficient 2D kernels in place of computationally
expensive 3D kernels. We evaluate our method on the Gen1 automotive and eTraM
datasets for event-based object detection, achieving over a 6% improvement in
detection accuracy compared to previous graph-based works, with a 5x speedup,
reduced parameter count, and no increase in computational cost. These results
highlight the effectiveness of structured graph modeling for asynchronous
vision. Project page: eventbasedvision.github.io/eGSMV.

Conclusion: MeshMamba在3D网格生成和重建任务中表现出高效性和扩展性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MeshMamba, a neural network model for learning 3D
articulated mesh models by employing the recently proposed Mamba State Space
Models (Mamba-SSMs). MeshMamba is efficient and scalable in handling a large
number of input tokens, enabling the generation and reconstruction of body mesh
models with more than 10,000 vertices, capturing clothing and hand geometries.
The key to effectively learning MeshMamba is the serialization technique of
mesh vertices into orderings that are easily processed by Mamba. This is
achieved by sorting the vertices based on body part annotations or the 3D
vertex locations of a template mesh, such that the ordering respects the
structure of articulated shapes. Based on MeshMamba, we design 1) MambaDiff3D,
a denoising diffusion model for generating 3D articulated meshes and 2)
Mamba-HMR, a 3D human mesh recovery model that reconstructs a human body shape
and pose from a single image. Experimental results showed that MambaDiff3D can
generate dense 3D human meshes in clothes, with grasping hands, etc., and
outperforms previous approaches in the 3D human shape generation task.
Additionally, Mamba-HMR extends the capabilities of previous non-parametric
human mesh recovery approaches, which were limited to handling body-only poses
using around 500 vertex tokens, to the whole-body setting with face and hands,
while achieving competitive performance in (near) real-time.

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has become an incredibly successful method for
feature learning, widely applied to many downstream tasks. It has proven
especially effective for discriminative tasks, surpassing the trending
generative models. However, generative models perform better in image
generation and detail enhancement. Thus, it is natural for us to find a
connection between SSL and generative models to further enhance the
representation capacity of SSL. As generative models can create new samples by
approximating the data distribution, such modeling should also lead to a
semantic understanding of the raw visual data, which is necessary for
recognition tasks. This enlightens us to combine the core principle of the
diffusion model: diffusion noise, with SSL to learn a competitive recognition
model. Specifically, diffusion noise can be viewed as a particular state of
mask that reveals a close relationship between masked image modeling (MIM) and
diffusion models. In this paper, we propose N-JEPA (Noise-based JEPA) to
incorporate diffusion noise into MIM by the position embedding of masked
tokens. The multi-level noise schedule is a series of feature augmentations to
further enhance the robustness of our model. We perform a comprehensive study
to confirm its effectiveness in the classification of downstream tasks. Codes
will be released soon in public.

Abstract: Advancements in 3D vision have increased the impact of blood vessel modeling
on medical applications. However, accurately representing the complex geometry
and topology of blood vessels remains a challenge due to their intricate
branching patterns, curvatures, and irregular shapes. In this study, we propose
a hierarchical part-based frame work for 3D vessel generation that separates
the global binary tree-like topology from local geometric details. Our approach
proceeds in three stages: (1) key graph generation to model the overall
hierarchical struc ture, (2) vessel segment generation conditioned on geometric
properties, and (3) hierarchical vessel assembly by integrating the local
segments according to the global key graph. We validate our framework on real
world datasets, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods in
modeling complex vascular networks. This work marks the first successful
application of a part-based generative approach for 3D vessel modeling, setting
a new benchmark for vascular data generation. The code is available at:

Abstract: Interpretability is critical in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging,
where understanding model decisions is essential for clinical adoption. In this
work, we introduce Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)-based interpretability to breast
imaging by analyzing {Mammo-CLIP}, a vision--language foundation model
pretrained on large-scale mammogram image--report pairs. We train a patch-level
\texttt{Mammo-SAE} on Mammo-CLIP to identify and probe latent features
associated with clinically relevant breast concepts such as \textit{mass} and
\textit{suspicious calcification}. Our findings reveal that top activated class
level latent neurons in the SAE latent space often tend to align with ground
truth regions, and also uncover several confounding factors influencing the
model's decision-making process. Additionally, we analyze which latent neurons
the model relies on during downstream finetuning for improving the breast
concept prediction. This study highlights the promise of interpretable SAE
latent representations in providing deeper insight into the internal workings
of foundation models at every layer for breast imaging.

Motivation: 现有方法在跨域少样本学习中面临参数更新过多导致过拟合的问题，需要更有效的方法。

Result: 在BSCD-FSL基准测试的极端域偏移场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: CP和伪类生成方法有效解决了过拟合问题，提升了跨域少样本学习性能。

Abstract: Despite the progress in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL), a model
pre-trained with DINO combined with a prototypical classifier outperforms the
latest SOTA methods. A crucial limitation that needs to be overcome is that
updating too many parameters of the transformers leads to overfitting due to
the scarcity of labeled samples. To address this challenge, we propose a new
concept, Coalescent Projection (CP), as an effective successor to soft prompts.
Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-class generation method combined with
Self-Supervised Transformations (SSTs) that relies solely on the base domain to
prepare the network for encountering unseen samples from different domains. The
proposed method exhibits its effectiveness in comprehensive experiments on the
extreme domain shift scenario of the BSCD-FSL benchmark. Our code is published

Conclusion: FreeCus展示了与现有修复流程和控制模块的无缝兼容性，为设计工作流和娱乐应用提供了新可能。

Abstract: In light of recent breakthroughs in text-to-image (T2I) generation,
particularly with diffusion transformers (DiT), subject-driven technologies are
increasingly being employed for high-fidelity customized production that
preserves subject identity from reference inputs, enabling thrilling design
workflows and engaging entertainment. Existing alternatives typically require
either per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training
specialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.
Such dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their
practical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully
leverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers
(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this
gap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates
DiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal
attention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while
preserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis
of DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly
improves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic
representations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully
unlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse
contexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to
approaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework
demonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and
control modules, facilitating more compelling experiences. Our code is

*Pei An,Jiaqi Yang,Muyao Peng,You Yang,Qiong Liu,Xiaolin Wu,Liangliang Nan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于近似盲PnP的对应学习方法（MinCD-PnP），通过最小化学习到的2D和3D关键点之间的Chamfer距离，解决了传统差分PnP对噪声和异常值敏感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统差分PnP在图像到点云（I2P）配准中对噪声和异常值高度敏感，限制了对应学习的有效性。受盲PnP的鲁棒性启发，作者提出了一种更鲁棒的对应学习方法。

Method: 提出了MinCD-PnP方法，将盲PnP简化为最小化2D和3D关键点之间的Chamfer距离。同时设计了轻量级多任务学习模块MinCD-Net，可集成到现有I2P配准架构中。

Result: 在多个数据集（7-Scenes、RGBD-V2、ScanNet等）上的实验表明，MinCD-Net在跨场景和跨数据集设置中均优于现有方法，具有更高的内点比率（IR）和配准召回率（RR）。

Conclusion: MinCD-PnP和MinCD-Net提供了一种鲁棒且高效的对应学习方法，显著提升了I2P配准的性能。

Abstract: Image-to-point-cloud (I2P) registration is a fundamental problem in computer
vision, focusing on establishing 2D-3D correspondences between an image and a
point cloud. The differential perspective-n-point (PnP) has been widely used to
supervise I2P registration networks by enforcing the projective constraints on
2D-3D correspondences. However, differential PnP is highly sensitive to noise
and outliers in the predicted correspondences. This issue hinders the
effectiveness of correspondence learning. Inspired by the robustness of blind
PnP against noise and outliers in correspondences, we propose an approximated
blind PnP based correspondence learning approach. To mitigate the high
computational cost of blind PnP, we simplify blind PnP to an amenable task of
minimizing Chamfer distance between learned 2D and 3D keypoints, called
MinCD-PnP. To effectively solve MinCD-PnP, we design a lightweight multi-task
learning module, named as MinCD-Net, which can be easily integrated into the
existing I2P registration architectures. Extensive experiments on 7-Scenes,
RGBD-V2, ScanNet, and self-collected datasets demonstrate that MinCD-Net
outperforms state-of-the-art methods and achieves a higher inlier ratio (IR)
and registration recall (RR) in both cross-scene and cross-dataset settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件扩散模型的视频压缩框架，通过生成模型从稀疏信号中重建视频，显著提升了感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用条件扩散模型在人类视觉感知对齐方面的优势，优化视频压缩的感知重建效果。

Method: 设计了多粒度条件模块、紧凑表示模块和多条件训练模块，以捕捉静态和动态信息并增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在FVD和LPIPS等感知质量指标上显著优于传统和神经编解码器，尤其在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 条件扩散模型为视频压缩提供了感知优化的新方向，尤其在高质量压缩场景中具有潜力。

Abstract: Perceptual studies demonstrate that conditional diffusion models excel at
reconstructing video content aligned with human visual perception. Building on
this insight, we propose a video compression framework that leverages
conditional diffusion models for perceptually optimized reconstruction.
Specifically, we reframe video compression as a conditional generation task,
where a generative model synthesizes video from sparse, yet informative
signals. Our approach introduces three key modules: (1) Multi-granular
conditioning that captures both static scene structure and dynamic
spatio-temporal cues; (2) Compact representations designed for efficient
transmission without sacrificing semantic richness; (3) Multi-condition
training with modality dropout and role-aware embeddings, which prevent
over-reliance on any single modality and enhance robustness. Extensive
experiments show that our method significantly outperforms both traditional and
neural codecs on perceptual quality metrics such as Fr\'echet Video Distance
(FVD) and LPIPS, especially under high compression ratios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的上下文学习框架，用于检测生物识别系统中的物理和数字攻击，性能优于传统CNN，且无需大量训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生物识别系统攻击技术的日益复杂，传统深度学习方法在适应新攻击类型和环境条件时表现不佳，且需要大量训练数据。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用视觉语言模型（VLM）和上下文学习技术，提出了一种系统框架，用于定量评估VLM在安全关键场景中的应用。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在物理和数字攻击检测中表现优异，优于部分传统CNN，且无需资源密集型训练。

Conclusion: 该框架为生物识别系统中的攻击检测提供了一种泛化能力强且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in biometric systems have significantly improved the
detection and prevention of fraudulent activities. However, as detection
methods improve, attack techniques become increasingly sophisticated. Attacks
on face recognition systems can be broadly divided into physical and digital
approaches. Traditionally, deep learning models have been the primary defence
against such attacks. While these models perform exceptionally well in
scenarios for which they have been trained, they often struggle to adapt to
different types of attacks or varying environmental conditions. These
subsystems require substantial amounts of training data to achieve reliable
performance, yet biometric data collection faces significant challenges,
including privacy concerns and the logistical difficulties of capturing diverse
attack scenarios under controlled conditions. This work investigates the
application of Vision Language Models (VLM) and proposes an in-context learning
framework for detecting physical presentation attacks and digital morphing
attacks in biometric systems. Focusing on open-source models, the first
systematic framework for the quantitative evaluation of VLMs in
security-critical scenarios through in-context learning techniques is
established. The experimental evaluation conducted on freely available
databases demonstrates that the proposed subsystem achieves competitive
performance for physical and digital attack detection, outperforming some of
the traditional CNNs without resource-intensive training. The experimental
results validate the proposed framework as a promising tool for improving
generalisation in attack detection.

Result: 在多种指纹数据集上表现优异，达到最先进精度并保持高效计算。

Conclusion: DMD方法具有强泛化能力和大规模指纹识别潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Fingerprint matching under diverse capture conditions remains a fundamental
challenge in biometric recognition. To achieve robust and accurate performance
in such scenarios, we propose DMD, a minutiae-anchored local dense
representation which captures both fine-grained ridge textures and
discriminative minutiae features in a spatially structured manner.
Specifically, descriptors are extracted from local patches centered and
oriented on each detected minutia, forming a three-dimensional tensor, where
two dimensions represent spatial locations on the fingerprint plane and the
third encodes semantic features. This representation explicitly captures
abstract features of local image patches, enabling a multi-level, fine-grained
description that aggregates information from multiple minutiae and their
surrounding ridge structures. Furthermore, thanks to its strong spatial
correspondence with the patch image, DMD allows for the use of foreground
segmentation masks to identify valid descriptor regions. During matching,
comparisons are then restricted to overlapping foreground areas, improving
efficiency and robustness. Extensive experiments on rolled, plain, parital,
contactless, and latent fingerprint datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalizability of the proposed method. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
across multiple benchmarks while maintaining high computational efficiency,
showing strong potential for large-scale fingerprint recognition. Corresponding
code is available at https://github.com/Yu-Yy/DMD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前少样本目标检测方法在通道特征提取上存在不足，高权重通道未必有效，低权重通道可能仍有价值。

Method: 设计了SCSM模块，包含空间特征建模（SFM）和基于Mamba的通道状态建模（CSM），以优化通道特征。

Result: 在VOC和COCO数据集上的实验表明，SCSM模块提升了特征表示质量，达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: SCSM模块通过建模通道相关性，有效改善了少样本目标检测中的特征提取问题。

Abstract: Due to the limited training samples in few-shot object detection (FSOD), we
observe that current methods may struggle to accurately extract effective
features from each channel. Specifically, this issue manifests in two aspects:
i) channels with high weights may not necessarily be effective, and ii)
channels with low weights may still hold significant value. To handle this
problem, we consider utilizing the inter-channel correlation to facilitate the
novel model's adaptation process to novel conditions, ensuring the model can
correctly highlight effective channels and rectify those incorrect ones. Since
the channel sequence is also 1-dimensional, its similarity with the temporal
sequence inspires us to take Mamba for modeling the correlation in the channel
sequence. Based on this concept, we propose a Spatial-Channel State Space
Modeling (SCSM) module for spatial-channel state modeling, which highlights the
effective patterns and rectifies those ineffective ones in feature channels. In
SCSM, we design the Spatial Feature Modeling (SFM) module to balance the
learning of spatial relationships and channel relationships, and then introduce
the Channel State Modeling (CSM) module based on Mamba to learn correlation in
channels. Extensive experiments on the VOC and COCO datasets show that the SCSM
module enables the novel detector to improve the quality of focused feature
representation in channels and achieve state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: BenchDepth为深度模型评估提供新标准，推动未来研究和深度估计技术进步。

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision with diverse
applications. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to powerful depth
foundation models (DFMs), yet their evaluation remains challenging due to
inconsistencies in existing protocols. Traditional benchmarks rely on
alignment-based metrics that introduce biases, favor certain depth
representations, and complicate fair comparisons. In this work, we propose
BenchDepth, a new benchmark that evaluates DFMs through five carefully selected
downstream proxy tasks: depth completion, stereo matching, monocular
feed-forward 3D scene reconstruction, SLAM, and vision-language spatial
understanding. Unlike conventional evaluation protocols, our approach assesses
DFMs based on their practical utility in real-world applications, bypassing
problematic alignment procedures. We benchmark eight state-of-the-art DFMs and
provide an in-depth analysis of key findings and observations. We hope our work
sparks further discussion in the community on best practices for depth model
evaluation and paves the way for future research and advancements in depth
estimation.

Result: 在KSDD2数据集上表现优异（94.2% I-AUROC，97.7% P-AUROC），最优增强样本数为100。

Conclusion: ExDD框架有效解决了工业缺陷检测中的单类异常检测问题，通过双分布建模和数据增强显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Industrial defect detection systems face critical limitations when confined
to one-class anomaly detection paradigms, which assume uniform outlier
distributions and struggle with data scarcity in realworld manufacturing
environments. We present ExDD (Explicit Dual Distribution), a novel framework
that transcends these limitations by explicitly modeling dual feature
distributions. Our approach leverages parallel memory banks that capture the
distinct statistical properties of both normality and anomalous patterns,
addressing the fundamental flaw of uniform outlier assumptions. To overcome
data scarcity, we employ latent diffusion models with domain-specific textual
conditioning, generating in-distribution synthetic defects that preserve
industrial context. Our neighborhood-aware ratio scoring mechanism elegantly
fuses complementary distance metrics, amplifying signals in regions exhibiting
both deviation from normality and similarity to known defect patterns.
Experimental validation on KSDD2 demonstrates superior performance (94.2%
I-AUROC, 97.7% P-AUROC), with optimal augmentation at 100 synthetic samples.

Abstract: Pavement defect detection faces critical challenges including limited

high variability in defect appearances across different road conditions. We
propose RoadFusion, a framework that addresses these limitations through
synthetic anomaly generation with dual-path feature adaptation. A latent
diffusion model synthesizes diverse, realistic defects using text prompts and
spatial masks, enabling effective training under data scarcity. Two separate

improving robustness to domain shift and defect variability. A lightweight

Abstract: The state of the art in human-centric computer vision achieves high accuracy
and robustness across a diverse range of tasks. The most effective models in
this domain have billions of parameters, thus requiring extremely large
datasets, expensive training regimes, and compute-intensive inference. In this
paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to train models on much smaller but
high-fidelity synthetic datasets, with no loss in accuracy and higher
efficiency. Using synthetic training data provides us with excellent levels of
detail and perfect labels, while providing strong guarantees for data
provenance, usage rights, and user consent. Procedural data synthesis also
provides us with explicit control on data diversity, that we can use to address
unfairness in the models we train. Extensive quantitative assessment on real
input images demonstrates accuracy of our models on three dense prediction
tasks: depth estimation, surface normal estimation, and soft foreground
segmentation. Our models require only a fraction of the cost of training and
inference when compared with foundational models of similar accuracy. Our
human-centric synthetic dataset and trained models are available at

Conclusion: ORSANet通过多模态融合和动态损失设计，有效解决了遮挡和偏差问题，提升了FER的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a challenging task due to pervasive
occlusion and dataset biases. Especially when facial information is partially
occluded, existing FER models struggle to extract effective facial features,
leading to inaccurate classifications. In response, we present ORSANet, which
introduces the following three key contributions: First, we introduce auxiliary
multi-modal semantic guidance to disambiguate facial occlusion and learn
high-level semantic knowledge, which is two-fold: 1) we introduce semantic
segmentation maps as dense semantics prior to generate semantics-enhanced
facial representations; 2) we introduce facial landmarks as sparse geometric
prior to mitigate intrinsic noises in FER, such as identity and gender biases.
Second, to facilitate the effective incorporation of these two multi-modal
priors, we customize a Multi-scale Cross-interaction Module (MCM) to adaptively
fuse the landmark feature and semantics-enhanced representations within
different scales. Third, we design a Dynamic Adversarial Repulsion Enhancement
Loss (DARELoss) that dynamically adjusts the margins of ambiguous classes,
further enhancing the model's ability to distinguish similar expressions. We
further construct the first occlusion-oriented FER dataset to facilitate
specialized robustness analysis on various real-world occlusion conditions,
dubbed Occlu-FER. Extensive experiments on both public benchmarks and Occlu-FER
demonstrate that our proposed ORSANet achieves SOTA recognition performance.

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition plays a crucial role in surgical workflow
analysis, enabling various applications such as surgical monitoring, skill
assessment, and workflow optimization. Despite significant advancements in deep
learning-based surgical phase recognition, these models remain inherently
opaque, making it difficult to understand how they make decisions. This lack of
interpretability hinders trust and makes it challenging to debug the model. To
address this challenge, we propose SurgX, a novel concept-based explanation
framework that enhances the interpretability of surgical phase recognition
models by associating neurons with relevant concepts. In this paper, we
introduce the process of selecting representative example sequences for
neurons, constructing a concept set tailored to the surgical video dataset,
associating neurons with concepts and identifying neurons crucial for
predictions. Through extensive experiments on two surgical phase recognition
models, we validate our method and analyze the explanation for prediction. This
highlights the potential of our method in explaining surgical phase
recognition. The code is available at https://github.com/ailab-kyunghee/SurgX

Motivation: 自运动视频是具身AI代理的主要视觉输入，但现有方法未能充分利用其时空连续性和运动约束，导致计算成本高。

Method: EgoPrune包含三个组件：关键帧选择器、视角感知冗余过滤器和基于MMR的令牌选择器。

Result: 在两个自运动视频基准测试中，EgoPrune在各种修剪比例下均优于现有方法，显著降低了计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: EgoPrune在边缘设备上展示了实际应用的效率和适用性。

Abstract: Egomotion videos are first-person recordings where the view changes
continuously due to the agent's movement. As they serve as the primary visual
input for embodied AI agents, making egomotion video reasoning more efficient
is therefore essential for real-world deployment. Recent advances in
vision-language models have enabled strong multimodal reasoning capabilities,
but their computational cost remains prohibitive for long, redundant video
inputs. Existing token pruning methods, typically designed for third-person
videos, fail to leverage the spatiotemporal continuity and motion constraints
inherent in egomotion settings. To address this, we propose EgoPrune, a
training-free token pruning method tailored for egomotion video reasoning.
EgoPrune comprises three components: a keyframe selector adapted from EmbodiedR
for temporally efficient sampling; Perspective-Aware Redundancy Filtering
(PARF), which aligns visual tokens using perspective transformations and
removes redundant tokens; and a Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR)-based token
selector that jointly considers visual-text relevance and intra-frame
diversity. Experiments on two egomotion video benchmarks show that EgoPrune
consistently outperforms prior training-free methods across various pruning
ratios while significantly reducing FLOPs, memory usage, and latency. Moreover,
we deploy EgoPrune on an embodied agent equipped with a Jetson Orin NX 16GB
edge device, demonstrating its real-world efficiency and suitability for
on-device egomotion video reasoning.

Conclusion: RAda是一种通用且高效的微调技术，代码开源。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, achieve remarkable
zero-shot performance, yet their downstream potential hinges on effective
fine-tuning. Most adaptation methods typically focus on refining representation
from separate modalities (text or vision) but neglect the critical role of
their fused representations in the decision-making process, \emph{\ie} rational
matrix that drives the final prediction. To bridge the gap, we propose a simple
yet effective \textbf{R}ational \textbf{Ada}ptaion ({RAda}) to explicitly
exploit the final fused representation during fine-tuning. RAda employs a
learned mask, obtained from a lightweight attention layer attached at the end
of a VLM, to dynamically calibrate the contribution of each element in the
rational matrix, enabling targeted adjustments to the final cross-modal
interactions without incurring costly modifications to intermediate features.
Experiments in different settings (i.e., updating, or freezing pretrained
encoders in adaptation, and test-time training that can only access the
unlabeled test data) show that RAda serves as a versatile fine-tuning
technique, improving the baseline with minimal code and performing comparably
against current arts in most settings. Code is available at

Abstract: After a family murder in rural Germany, authorities failed to locate the
suspect in a vast forest despite a massive search. To aid the search, a
research aircraft captured high-resolution aerial imagery. Due to dense
vegetation obscuring small clues, automated analysis was ineffective, prompting
a crowd-search initiative. This effort produced a unique dataset of labeled,
hard-to-detect anomalies under occluded, real-world conditions. It can serve as
a benchmark for improving anomaly detection approaches in complex forest
environments, supporting manhunts and rescue operations. Initial benchmark
tests showed existing methods performed poorly, highlighting the need for
context-aware approaches. The dataset is openly accessible for offline
processing. An additional interactive web interface supports online viewing and
dynamic growth by allowing users to annotate and submit new findings.

Abstract: Odometry is a critical task for autonomous systems for self-localization and
navigation. We propose a novel LiDAR-Visual odometry framework that integrates
LiDAR point clouds and images for accurate and robust pose estimation. Our
method utilizes a dense-depth map estimated from point clouds and images
through depth completion, and incorporates a multi-scale feature extraction
network with attention mechanisms, enabling adaptive depth-aware
representations. Furthermore, we leverage dense depth information to refine
flow estimation and mitigate errors in occlusion-prone regions. Our
hierarchical pose refinement module optimizes motion estimation progressively,
ensuring robust predictions against dynamic environments and scale ambiguities.
Comprehensive experiments on the KITTI odometry benchmark demonstrate that our
approach achieves similar or superior accuracy and robustness compared to
state-of-the-art visual and LiDAR odometry methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UMIVR是一个基于不确定性最小化的交互式文本到视频检索框架，通过量化文本模糊性、映射不确定性和帧不确定性，生成针对性澄清问题，显著提升检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前交互式文本到视频检索方法依赖启发式策略，未能显式量化不确定性，限制了其效果。UMIVR旨在填补这一空白。

Method: UMIVR通过语义熵（TAS）、Jensen-Shannon散度（MUS）和时序质量采样器（TQFS）量化三种不确定性，并生成针对性澄清问题。

Result: 在MSR-VTT-1k数据集上，UMIVR在10轮交互后Recall@1达到69.2%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UMIVR为交互式文本到视频检索提供了不确定性最小化的基础框架，效果显著。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Text-to-video retrieval (TVR) is still hindered by
multiple inherent uncertainties, such as ambiguous textual queries, indistinct
text-video mappings, and low-quality video frames. Although interactive systems
have emerged to address these challenges by refining user intent through
clarifying questions, current methods typically rely on heuristic or ad-hoc
strategies without explicitly quantifying these uncertainties, limiting their
effectiveness. Motivated by this gap, we propose UMIVR, an
Uncertainty-Minimizing Interactive Text-to-Video Retrieval framework that
explicitly quantifies three critical uncertainties-text ambiguity, mapping
uncertainty, and frame uncertainty-via principled, training-free metrics:
semantic entropy-based Text Ambiguity Score (TAS), Jensen-Shannon
divergence-based Mapping Uncertainty Score (MUS), and a Temporal Quality-based
Frame Sampler (TQFS). By adaptively generating targeted clarifying questions
guided by these uncertainty measures, UMIVR iteratively refines user queries,
significantly reducing retrieval ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmarks validate UMIVR's effectiveness, achieving notable gains in Recall@1
(69.2\% after 10 interactive rounds) on the MSR-VTT-1k dataset, thereby
establishing an uncertainty-minimizing foundation for interactive TVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer方法在非均匀光照场景（如背光和阴影）中表现不佳，导致过曝或亮度恢复不足。

Method: 提出动态积分图像表示建模空间变化光照，构建SAI²E估计器，并引入光照引导的多头自注意力机制（IG-MSA）。

Result: 在五个标准低光数据集和跨域基准（LOL-Blur）上，SAIGFormer在定量和定性指标上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAIGFormer在非均匀光照增强中表现优异，并展现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent Transformer-based low-light enhancement methods have made promising
progress in recovering global illumination. However, they still struggle with
non-uniform lighting scenarios, such as backlit and shadow, appearing as
over-exposure or inadequate brightness restoration. To address this challenge,
we present a Spatially-Adaptive Illumination-Guided Transformer (SAIGFormer)
framework that enables accurate illumination restoration. Specifically, we
propose a dynamic integral image representation to model the spatially-varying
illumination, and further construct a novel Spatially-Adaptive Integral
Illumination Estimator ($\text{SAI}^2\text{E}$). Moreover, we introduce an
Illumination-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention (IG-MSA) mechanism, which
leverages the illumination to calibrate the lightness-relevant features toward
visual-pleased illumination enhancement. Extensive experiments on five standard
low-light datasets and a cross-domain benchmark (LOL-Blur) demonstrate that our
SAIGFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both
quantitative and qualitative metrics. In particular, our method achieves
superior performance in non-uniform illumination enhancement while exhibiting
strong generalization capabilities across multiple datasets. Code is available

Motivation: 现有方法在视频关键步骤学习时易受顺序变化、冗余帧和重复动作影响，性能受限。

Method: 结合Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输与结构先验进行帧间映射，并引入对比正则化避免嵌入空间退化。

Result: 在EgoProceL、ProceL和CrossTask数据集上表现优于传统方法（如OPEL）。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了自监督程序学习中的关键挑战，性能显著提升。

Abstract: We study the problem of self-supervised procedure learning, which discovers
key steps and establishes their order from a set of unlabeled procedural
videos. Previous procedure learning methods typically learn frame-to-frame
correspondences between videos before determining key steps and their order.
However, their performance often suffers from order variations,
background/redundant frames, and repeated actions. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a self-supervised procedure learning framework, which
utilizes a fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport formulation with a
structural prior for computing frame-to-frame mapping between videos. However,
optimizing exclusively for the above temporal alignment term may lead to
degenerate solutions, where all frames are mapped to a small cluster in the
embedding space and hence every video is associated with only one key step. To
address that limitation, we further integrate a contrastive regularization
term, which maps different frames to different points in the embedding space,
avoiding the collapse to trivial solutions. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on large-scale egocentric (i.e., EgoProceL) and third-person (i.e.,
ProceL and CrossTask) benchmarks to demonstrate superior performance by our
approach against previous methods, including OPEL which relies on a traditional
Kantorovich optimal transport formulation with an optimality prior.

Conclusion: 研究强调了整合工具-动作-目标组合和手部身份对手术场景图表示的重要性，并提供了公开代码和数据集。

Abstract: Surgical scene understanding is crucial for computer-assisted intervention
systems, requiring visual comprehension of surgical scenes that involves
diverse elements such as surgical tools, anatomical structures, and their
interactions. To effectively represent the complex information in surgical
scenes, graph-based approaches have been explored to structurally model
surgical entities and their relationships. Previous surgical scene graph
studies have demonstrated the feasibility of representing surgical scenes using
graphs. However, certain aspects of surgical scenes-such as diverse
combinations of tool-action-target and the identity of the hand operating the
tool-remain underexplored in graph-based representations, despite their
importance. To incorporate these aspects into graph representations, we propose
Endoscapes-SG201 dataset, which includes annotations for tool-action-target
combinations and hand identity. We also introduce SSG-Com, a graph-based method
designed to learn and represent these critical elements. Through experiments on
downstream tasks such as critical view of safety assessment and action triplet
recognition, we demonstrated the importance of integrating these essential
scene graph components, highlighting their significant contribution to surgical
scene understanding. The code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 解决现有方法在零样本HOI检测中难以区分相同对象动作或泛化到未见类的问题。

Method: 低秩分解VLM文本特征，生成类共享基特征和可调权重，结合LLM动作正则化优化权重。

Result: 在HICO-DET上达到27.91的未见类mAP，创下新纪录。

Conclusion: HOLa在零样本HOI检测中显著提升泛化和动作区分能力。

Abstract: Zero-shot human-object interaction (HOI) detection remains a challenging
task, particularly in generalizing to unseen actions. Existing methods address
this challenge by tapping Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to access knowledge
beyond the training data. However, they either struggle to distinguish actions
involving the same object or demonstrate limited generalization to unseen
classes. In this paper, we introduce HOLa (Zero-Shot HOI Detection with
Low-Rank Decomposed VLM Feature Adaptation), a novel approach that both
enhances generalization to unseen classes and improves action distinction. In
training, HOLa decomposes VLM text features for given HOI classes via low-rank
factorization, producing class-shared basis features and adaptable weights.
These features and weights form a compact HOI representation that preserves
shared information across classes, enhancing generalization to unseen classes.
Subsequently, we refine action distinction by adapting weights for each HOI
class and introducing human-object tokens to enrich visual interaction
representations. To further distinguish unseen actions, we guide the weight
adaptation with LLM-derived action regularization. Experimental results show
that our method sets a new state-of-the-art across zero-shot HOI settings on
HICO-DET, achieving an unseen-class mAP of 27.91 in the unseen-verb setting.

Motivation: 传统方法将时空信息分离处理，导致快速移动物体的空间信息难以准确表示，影响时空交互和视频理解。

Method: 提出DynImg方法，利用非关键帧作为时间提示，引导模型关注快速移动物体的细粒度空间特征，并采用4D视频旋转位置嵌入保持时空顺序。

Result: 实验表明，DynImg在多个视频理解基准上优于现有方法约2%。

Conclusion: DynImg通过时间提示和时空顺序保持，有效提升了视频理解的准确性。

Abstract: In recent years, the introduction of Multi-modal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) into video understanding tasks has become increasingly prevalent.
However, how to effectively integrate temporal information remains a critical
research focus. Traditional approaches treat spatial and temporal information
separately. Due to issues like motion blur, it is challenging to accurately
represent the spatial information of rapidly moving objects. This can lead to
temporally important regions being underemphasized during spatial feature
extraction, which in turn hinders accurate spatio-temporal interaction and
video understanding. To address this limitation, we propose an innovative video
representation method called Dynamic-Image (DynImg). Specifically, we introduce
a set of non-key frames as temporal prompts to highlight the spatial areas
containing fast-moving objects. During the process of visual feature
extraction, these prompts guide the model to pay additional attention to the
fine-grained spatial features corresponding to these regions. Moreover, to
maintain the correct sequence for DynImg, we employ a corresponding 4D video
Rotary Position Embedding. This retains both the temporal and spatial adjacency
of DynImg, helping MLLM understand the spatio-temporal order within this
combined format. Experimental evaluations reveal that DynImg surpasses the
state-of-the-art methods by approximately 2% across multiple video
understanding benchmarks, proving the effectiveness of our temporal prompts in
enhancing video comprehension.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Mixup的像素级插值生成不真实图像，可能阻碍学习，尤其在医学等高风险应用中。GeMix旨在通过生成语义连贯的图像解决这一问题。

Method: GeMix采用两阶段框架：1) 使用StyleGAN2-ADA生成器训练目标数据集；2) 通过Beta分布系数混合标签向量，生成连续类流形上的图像。

Result: 在COVIDx-CT-3数据集上，GeMix结合真实数据显著提升了所有骨干网络（ResNet-50、ResNet-101、EfficientNet-B0）的macro-F1，降低了COVID-19检测的假阴性率。

Conclusion: GeMix是传统Mixup的直接替代方案，提供更强的正则化和语义保真度，且无需修改现有训练流程。代码已开源。

Abstract: Mixup has become a popular augmentation strategy for image classification,
yet its naive pixel-wise interpolation often produces unrealistic images that
can hinder learning, particularly in high-stakes medical applications. We
propose GeMix, a two-stage framework that replaces heuristic blending with a
learned, label-aware interpolation powered by class-conditional GANs. First, a
StyleGAN2-ADA generator is trained on the target dataset. During augmentation,
we sample two label vectors from Dirichlet priors biased toward different
classes and blend them via a Beta-distributed coefficient. Then, we condition
the generator on this soft label to synthesize visually coherent images that
lie along a continuous class manifold. We benchmark GeMix on the large-scale
COVIDx-CT-3 dataset using three backbones (ResNet-50, ResNet-101,
EfficientNet-B0). When combined with real data, our method increases macro-F1
over traditional mixup for all backbones, reducing the false negative rate for
COVID-19 detection. GeMix is thus a drop-in replacement for pixel-space mixup,
delivering stronger regularization and greater semantic fidelity, without
disrupting existing training pipelines. We publicly release our code at
https://github.com/hugocarlesso/GeMix to foster reproducibility and further
research.

Motivation: 传统卫星图像变化检测因数据传输和处理延迟无法满足实时需求，需将整个流程移至卫星上。

Conclusion: 该框架首次实现卫星上端到端变化检测，为实时应用提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: Change detection from satellite images typically incurs a delay ranging from
several hours up to days because of latency in downlinking the acquired images
and generating orthorectified image products at the ground stations; this may
preclude real- or near real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we
propose shifting the entire change detection workflow onboard satellites. This
requires to simultaneously solve challenges in data storage, image registration
and change detection with a strict complexity constraint. In this paper, we
present a novel and efficient framework for onboard change detection that
addresses the aforementioned challenges in an end-to-end fashion with a deep
neural network composed of three interlinked submodules: (1) image compression,
tailored to minimize onboard data storage resources; (2) lightweight
co-registration of non-orthorectified multi-temporal image pairs; and (3) a
novel temporally-invariant and computationally efficient change detection
model. This is the first approach in the literature combining all these tasks
in a single end-to-end framework with the constraints dictated by onboard
processing. Experimental results compare each submodule with the current
state-of-the-art, and evaluate the performance of the overall integrated system
in realistic setting on low-power hardware. Compelling change detection results
are obtained in terms of F1 score as a function of compression rate, sustaining
a throughput of 0.7 Mpixel/s on a 15W accelerator.

Conclusion: 通过利用人类视频数据和大规模物理指令调优，Being-H0为复杂操作任务提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Being-H0, a dexterous Vision-Language-Action model (VLA) trained
on large-scale human videos. Existing VLAs struggle with complex manipulation
tasks requiring high dexterity and generalize poorly to novel scenarios and
tasks, primarily due to their reliance on synthetic data with significant
sim-to-real gaps or teleoperated demonstrations lacking scale and diversity. To
address this data bottleneck, we propose leveraging human hands as a foundation
manipulator, capitalizing on the rich dexterity and scalability present in web
data. Our approach centers on physical instruction tuning, a novel training
paradigm that combines large-scale VLA pretraining from human videos, physical
space alignment for 3D reasoning, and post-training adaptation for robotic
tasks. Additionally, we introduce a part-level motion tokenization method which
achieves millimeter-level reconstruction accuracy to model precise hand
trajectories for action learning. To support our proposed paradigm, we further
develop a comprehensive data curation pipeline that integrates heterogeneous
sources -- including motion capture, VR, and RGB-only videos -- into a
large-scale dataset with millions of motion-based instructional instances. We
empirically show the excellence of Being-H0 in hand motion generation and
instruction following, and it also scales well with model and data sizes.
Importantly, we observe the expected gains of Being-H0 in real-world robotic
manipulation as physical instruction tuning is applied. More details are

strengths of both approaches: SDF captures coarse geometry to enhance
3DGS-based rendering, while newly rendered images from 3DGS refine the details
of SDF for accurate surface reconstruction. As a result, our method surpasses

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于圆柱坐标系的CylinderPlane表示方法，解决了Tri-plane表示中的多视角一致性问题，实现了高质量、无伪影的360°图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tri-plane表示因其固有结构问题（如对称区域特征共享导致的多面伪影）限制了360°视图图像的生成能力。

Method: 采用圆柱坐标系设计CylinderPlane表示，通过嵌套圆柱结构捕捉多尺度特征，提升复杂几何和分辨率适应性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在合成数据集和真实图像上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CylinderPlane是一种高效且通用的表示方法，适用于多种神经渲染流程。

Abstract: While the proposal of the Tri-plane representation has advanced the
development of the 3D-aware image generative models, problems rooted in its
inherent structure, such as multi-face artifacts caused by sharing the same
features in symmetric regions, limit its ability to generate 360$^\circ$ view
images. In this paper, we propose CylinderPlane, a novel implicit
representation based on Cylindrical Coordinate System, to eliminate the feature
ambiguity issue and ensure multi-view consistency in 360$^\circ$. Different
from the inevitable feature entanglement in Cartesian coordinate-based
Tri-plane representation, the cylindrical coordinate system explicitly
separates features at different angles, allowing our cylindrical representation
possible to achieve high-quality, artifacts-free 360$^\circ$ image synthesis.
We further introduce the nested cylinder representation that composites
multiple cylinders at different scales, thereby enabling the model more
adaptable to complex geometry and varying resolutions. The combination of
cylinders with different resolutions can effectively capture more critical
locations and multi-scale features, greatly facilitates fine detail learning
and robustness to different resolutions. Moreover, our representation is
agnostic to implicit rendering methods and can be easily integrated into any
neural rendering pipeline. Extensive experiments on both synthetic dataset and
unstructured in-the-wild images demonstrate that our proposed representation
achieves superior performance over previous methods.

Motivation: 由于标注数据稀缺和历史乐谱复杂性，光学音乐识别（OMR）在文化遗产数字化中受限，本文旨在探索减少标注需求的方法。

Method: 采用YOLOv8模型，选择预测置信度最低的样本进行迭代标注和训练，从单张标注图像开始逐步提升性能。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在显著减少标注样本的情况下，能达到与全监督训练相当的精度，但在特定古乐谱数据集中不确定性AL效果不佳。

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is a cornerstone of music digitization
initiatives in cultural heritage, yet it remains limited by the scarcity of
annotated data and the complexity of historical manuscripts. In this paper, we
present a preliminary study of Active Learning (AL) and Sequential Learning
(SL) tailored for object detection and layout recognition in an old medieval
music manuscript. Leveraging YOLOv8, our system selects samples with the
highest uncertainty (lowest prediction confidence) for iterative labeling and
retraining. Our approach starts with a single annotated image and successfully
boosts performance while minimizing manual labeling. Experimental results
indicate that comparable accuracy to fully supervised training can be achieved
with significantly fewer labeled examples. We test the methodology as a
preliminary investigation on a novel dataset offered to the community by the
Anonymous project, which studies laude, a poetical-musical genre spread across
Italy during the 12th-16th Century. We show that in the manuscript at-hand,
uncertainty-based AL is not effective and advocates for more usable methods in
data-scarcity scenarios.

TL;DR: 研究应用彩票假设（LTH）于深度伪造检测，发现关键子网络在高度稀疏下仍保持性能，并提出优于单次剪枝的迭代剪枝方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术威胁信息完整性，现有检测方法模型大且机制不明确，难以在资源有限环境中部署。

Method: 通过MesoNet、CNN-5和ResNet-18架构，结合LTH进行迭代剪枝，分析关键特征和性能保持。

Result: MesoNet在80%稀疏度下保持56.2%准确率（基线62.6%），仅需3,000参数；迭代剪枝优于单次剪枝。

Conclusion: LTH方法可高效识别关键子网络，支持可部署的深度伪造检测系统，并展示跨数据集迁移潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in deepfake technology have created increasingly convincing
synthetic media that poses significant challenges to information integrity and
social trust. While current detection methods show promise, their underlying
mechanisms remain poorly understood, and the large sizes of their models make
them challenging to deploy in resource-limited environments. This study
investigates the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to deepfake
detection, aiming to identify the key features crucial for recognizing
deepfakes. We examine how neural networks can be efficiently pruned while
maintaining high detection accuracy. Through extensive experiments with
MesoNet, CNN-5, and ResNet-18 architectures on the OpenForensic and
FaceForensics++ datasets, we find that deepfake detection networks contain
winning tickets, i.e., subnetworks, that preserve performance even at
substantial sparsity levels. Our results indicate that MesoNet retains 56.2%
accuracy at 80% sparsity on the OpenForensic dataset, with only 3,000
parameters, which is about 90% of its baseline accuracy (62.6%). The results
also show that our proposed LTH-based iterative magnitude pruning approach
consistently outperforms one-shot pruning methods. Using Grad-CAM
visualization, we analyze how pruned networks maintain their focus on critical
facial regions for deepfake detection. Additionally, we demonstrate the
transferability of winning tickets across datasets, suggesting potential for
efficient, deployable deepfake detection systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EVA的训练无关方法，通过动态选择中间层提取视觉事实信息，显著减少多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉识别和语言理解结合方面取得进展，但仍存在物体幻觉问题，即模型生成看似合理但实际错误的输出。研究发现先验知识在深层抑制视觉信息，但中间层的机制尚不明确。

Method: 提出EVA方法，通过对比原始输入和纯文本输入的中间层输出分布，动态选择视觉事实信息最显著的层，并将其融入最终层以修正输出。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准测试中，EVA显著降低了幻觉率，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: EVA是一种模型无关、无需训练的方法，能有效减少MLLMs中的幻觉问题，且兼容多种经典解码策略。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides by
combining visual recognition and language understanding to generate content
that is both coherent and contextually accurate. However, MLLMs continue to
struggle with object hallucinations, where models produce seemingly plausible
but factually incorrect outputs, including objects that do not exist in the
image. Recent work has revealed that the prior knowledge in MLLMs significantly
suppresses visual information in deep layers, causing hallucinatory outputs.
However, how these priors suppress visual information at the intermediate layer
stage in MLLMs remains unclear. We observe that visual factual knowledge and
the differences between intermediate-layer prior/original probability
distributions show similar evolutionary trends in intermediate layers.
Motivated by this, we introduce Decoding by Extracting Visual Facts (EVA), a
simple, training-free method that dynamically selects intermediate layers with
the most significant visual factual information. By contrasting the output
distributions of the selected layer derived from the original input and
pure-text input, EVA extracts visual factual knowledge and proportionally
incorporates it into the final layer to correct the output logits. Importantly,
EVA is model-agnostic, seamlessly integrates with various classic decoding
strategies, and is applicable across different MLLMs. We validate EVA on
widely-used benchmarks, and the results show that it significantly reduces
hallucination rates compared to baseline methods, underscoring its
effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) is a core task in computer vision. Multimodal
methods based on vision-language models, such as CLIP, have demonstrated
exceptional generalization capabilities in IQA tasks. To address the issues of
excessive parameter burden and insufficient ability to identify local distorted
features in CLIP for IQA, this study proposes a visual-language model knowledge
distillation method aimed at guiding the training of models with architectural
advantages using CLIP's IQA knowledge. First, quality-graded prompt templates
were designed to guide CLIP to output quality scores. Then, CLIP is fine-tuned
to enhance its capabilities in IQA tasks. Finally, a modality-adaptive
knowledge distillation strategy is proposed to achieve guidance from the CLIP
teacher model to the student model. Our experiments were conducted on multiple
IQA datasets, and the results show that the proposed method significantly
reduces model complexity while outperforming existing IQA methods,
demonstrating strong potential for practical deployment.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Visual relocalization, which estimates the 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) camera
pose from query images, is fundamental to remote sensing and UAV applications.
Existing methods face inherent trade-offs: image-based retrieval and pose
regression approaches lack precision, while structure-based methods that
register queries to Structure-from-Motion (SfM) models suffer from
computational complexity and limited scalability. These challenges are
particularly pronounced in remote sensing scenarios due to large-scale scenes,
high altitude variations, and domain gaps of existing visual priors. To
overcome these limitations, we leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a novel
scene representation that compactly encodes both 3D geometry and appearance. We
introduce $\mathrm{Hi}^2$-GSLoc, a dual-hierarchical relocalization framework
that follows a sparse-to-dense and coarse-to-fine paradigm, fully exploiting
the rich semantic information and geometric constraints inherent in Gaussian
primitives. To handle large-scale remote sensing scenarios, we incorporate
partitioned Gaussian training, GPU-accelerated parallel matching, and dynamic
memory management strategies. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a sparse
stage featuring a Gaussian-specific consistent render-aware sampling strategy
and landmark-guided detector for robust and accurate initial pose estimation,
and (2) a dense stage that iteratively refines poses through coarse-to-fine
dense rasterization matching while incorporating reliability verification.
Through comprehensive evaluation on simulation data, public datasets, and real
flight experiments, we demonstrate that our method delivers competitive
localization accuracy, recall rate, and computational efficiency while
effectively filtering unreliable pose estimates. The results confirm the
effectiveness of our approach for practical remote sensing applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI点云压缩方法依赖特定训练数据分布，限制了实际应用；INR方法虽解决了分布依赖问题，但仅支持有损压缩且编码时间和解码器大小受限。

Method: 设计了分组编码框架和网络初始化策略以减少60%编码时间；提出基于多尺度SparseConv的轻量级网络，包含尺度上下文提取、子节点预测和模型压缩模块。

Result: 在MVUB数据集上，比特流比G-PCC TMC13v23减少21.21%，比SparsePCGC减少21.95%。

Conclusion: LINR-PCGC首次实现了基于INR的无损点云几何压缩，显著提升了压缩效率和实用性。

Abstract: Existing AI-based point cloud compression methods struggle with dependence on
specific training data distributions, which limits their real-world deployment.
Implicit Neural Representation (INR) methods solve the above problem by
encoding overfitted network parameters to the bitstream, resulting in more
distribution-agnostic results. However, due to the limitation of encoding time
and decoder size, current INR based methods only consider lossy geometry
compression. In this paper, we propose the first INR based lossless point cloud
geometry compression method called Lossless Implicit Neural Representations for
Point Cloud Geometry Compression (LINR-PCGC). To accelerate encoding speed, we
design a group of point clouds level coding framework with an effective network
initialization strategy, which can reduce around 60% encoding time. A
lightweight coding network based on multiscale SparseConv, consisting of scale
context extraction, child node prediction, and model compression modules, is
proposed to realize fast inference and compact decoder size. Experimental
results show that our method consistently outperforms traditional and AI-based
methods: for example, with the convergence time in the MVUB dataset, our method
reduces the bitstream by approximately 21.21% compared to G-PCC TMC13v23 and
21.95% compared to SparsePCGC. Our project can be seen on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DWTGS提出了一种基于小波空间损失的新型频率正则化方法，通过监督低频子带并自监督高频子带，改善了稀疏视图3D高斯泼溅的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在重建高质量新视图时容易过拟合高频细节，传统傅里叶变换方法参数调优困难且偏向有害高频学习。

Method: DWTGS利用小波空间损失提供额外空间监督，仅监督低频LL子带，同时对高频HH子带进行自监督稀疏化。

Result: 实验表明，DWTGS在多个基准测试中优于基于傅里叶的方法，低频策略提高了泛化能力并减少了高频幻觉。

Conclusion: DWTGS通过小波空间损失改进了稀疏视图3DGS的重建质量，是一种更有效的频率正则化方法。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) presents significant challenges in
reconstructing high-quality novel views, as it often overfits to the
widely-varying high-frequency (HF) details of the sparse training views. While
frequency regularization can be a promising approach, its typical reliance on
Fourier transforms causes difficult parameter tuning and biases towards
detrimental HF learning. We propose DWTGS, a framework that rethinks frequency
regularization by leveraging wavelet-space losses that provide additional
spatial supervision. Specifically, we supervise only the low-frequency (LF) LL
subbands at multiple DWT levels, while enforcing sparsity on the HF HH subband
in a self-supervised manner. Experiments across benchmarks show that DWTGS
consistently outperforms Fourier-based counterparts, as this LF-centric
strategy improves generalization and reduces HF hallucinations.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且实用，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Face image quality assessment (FIQA) is essential for various face-related
applications. Although FIQA has been extensively studied and achieved
significant progress, the computational complexity of FIQA algorithms remains a
key concern for ensuring scalability and practical deployment in real-world
systems. In this paper, we aim to develop a computationally efficient FIQA
method that can be easily deployed in real-world applications. Specifically,
our method consists of two stages: training a powerful teacher model and
distilling a lightweight student model from it. To build a strong teacher
model, we adopt a self-training strategy to improve its capacity. We first
train the teacher model using labeled face images, then use it to generate
pseudo-labels for a set of unlabeled images. These pseudo-labeled samples are
used in two ways: (1) to distill knowledge into the student model, and (2) to
combine with the original labeled images to further enhance the teacher model
through self-training. The enhanced teacher model is used to further
pseudo-label another set of unlabeled images for distilling the student models.
The student model is trained using a combination of labeled images,
pseudo-labeled images from the original teacher model, and pseudo-labeled
images from the enhanced teacher model. Experimental results demonstrate that
our student model achieves comparable performance to the teacher model with an
extremely low computational overhead. Moreover, our method achieved first place
in the ICCV 2025 VQualA FIQA Challenge. The code is available at

Method: 在ImageNet上进行控制实验，比较扩散模型、流模型和自回归模型，提出控制令牌预填充方法，并研究采样时间增强策略（如分类器自由引导和softmax截断）。

Conclusion: 论文为空间控制图像生成提供了实用基线方法和改进策略，填补了文献中的知识空白。

Abstract: Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important
area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their
own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task
has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing
stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific
comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation
paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to
performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches
become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways
across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop
transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the
literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on
ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models.
First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and
performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously
underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending
classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a
strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the
motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate
"forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream
data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control
consistency. Code will be released upon publication.

Conclusion: TokensGen为长视频生成提供可扩展、模块化的解决方案，适用于影视制作和沉浸式模拟。

Abstract: Generating consistent long videos is a complex challenge: while
diffusion-based generative models generate visually impressive short clips,
extending them to longer durations often leads to memory bottlenecks and
long-term inconsistency. In this paper, we propose TokensGen, a novel two-stage
framework that leverages condensed tokens to address these issues. Our method
decomposes long video generation into three core tasks: (1) inner-clip semantic
control, (2) long-term consistency control, and (3) inter-clip smooth
transition. First, we train To2V (Token-to-Video), a short video diffusion
model guided by text and video tokens, with a Video Tokenizer that condenses
short clips into semantically rich tokens. Second, we introduce T2To
(Text-to-Token), a video token diffusion transformer that generates all tokens
at once, ensuring global consistency across clips. Finally, during inference,
an adaptive FIFO-Diffusion strategy seamlessly connects adjacent clips,
reducing boundary artifacts and enhancing smooth transitions. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances long-term temporal
and content coherence without incurring prohibitive computational overhead. By
leveraging condensed tokens and pre-trained short video models, our method
provides a scalable, modular solution for long video generation, opening new
possibilities for storytelling, cinematic production, and immersive
simulations. Please see our project page at

Result: 实验表明，该方法在重建质量和收敛速度上优于或匹配现有场景特定优化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多视角一致的光度校正，实现了高效训练和高质量重建，具有跨场景泛化能力。

Abstract: Modern camera pipelines apply extensive on-device processing, such as
exposure adjustment, white balance, and color correction, which, while
beneficial individually, often introduce photometric inconsistencies across
views. These appearance variations violate multi-view consistency and degrade
the quality of novel view synthesis. Joint optimization of scene
representations and per-image appearance embeddings has been proposed to
address this issue, but at the cost of increased computational complexity and
slower training. In this work, we propose a transformer-based method that
predicts spatially adaptive bilateral grids to correct photometric variations
in a multi-view consistent manner, enabling robust cross-scene generalization
without the need for scene-specific retraining. By incorporating the learned
grids into the 3D Gaussian Splatting pipeline, we improve reconstruction
quality while maintaining high training efficiency. Extensive experiments show
that our approach outperforms or matches existing scene-specific optimization
methods in reconstruction fidelity and convergence speed.

Conclusion: HDF框架在动态面部表情识别任务中具有优越的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) plays a critical role in
affective computing and human-computer interaction. Although existing methods
achieve comparable performance, they inevitably suffer from performance
degradation under sample heterogeneity caused by multi-source data and
individual expression variability. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel framework, called Heterogeneity-aware Distributional Framework (HDF), and
design two plug-and-play modules to enhance time-frequency modeling and
mitigate optimization imbalance caused by hard samples. Specifically, the
Time-Frequency Distributional Attention Module (DAM) captures both temporal
consistency and frequency robustness through a dual-branch attention design,
improving tolerance to sequence inconsistency and visual style shifts. Then,
based on gradient sensitivity and information bottleneck principles, an
adaptive optimization module Distribution-aware Scaling Module (DSM) is
introduced to dynamically balance classification and contrastive losses,
enabling more stable and discriminative representation learning. Extensive
experiments on two widely used datasets, DFEW and FERV39k, demonstrate that HDF
significantly improves both recognition accuracy and robustness. Our method
achieves superior weighted average recall (WAR) and unweighted average recall
(UAR) while maintaining strong generalization across diverse and imbalanced
scenarios. Codes are released at https://github.com/QIcita/HDF_DFER.

Conclusion: 树状语义损失函数能有效利用标签层次结构，提升医学图像分割的准确性和适用性。

Abstract: Rich and accurate medical image segmentation is poised to underpin the next
generation of AI-defined clinical practice by delineating critical anatomy for
pre-operative planning, guiding real-time intra-operative navigation, and
supporting precise post-operative assessment. However, commonly used learning
methods for medical and surgical imaging segmentation tasks penalise all errors
equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the labels
space. This becomes particularly problematic as the cardinality and richness of
labels increases to include subtly different classes. In this work, we propose
two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical
organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently
proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations to
extend the applicability of our proposed losses. Extensive experiments are
reported on two medical and surgical image segmentation tasks, namely head MRI
for whole brain parcellation (WBP) with full supervision and neurosurgical
hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for scene understanding with sparse annotations.
Results demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art
performance in both cases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法需要固定秩，难以适应不同医学图像任务的复杂性，因此需要一种动态调整秩的方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在少样本微调任务中显著优于标准LoRA和其他PEFT方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能自动优化秩选择，提高性能，且对初始秩不敏感。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained foundation models is
increasingly attracting interest in medical imaging due to its effectiveness
and computational efficiency. Among these methods, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
is a notable approach based on the assumption that the adaptation inherently
occurs in a low-dimensional subspace. While it has shown good performance, its
implementation requires a fixed and unalterable rank, which might be
challenging to select given the unique complexities and requirements of each
medical imaging downstream task. Inspired by advancements in natural image
processing, we introduce a novel approach for medical image segmentation that
dynamically adjusts the intrinsic rank during adaptation. Viewing the low-rank
representation of the trainable weight matrices as a singular value
decomposition, we introduce an l_1 sparsity regularizer to the loss function,
and tackle it with a proximal optimizer. The regularizer could be viewed as a
penalty on the decomposition rank. Hence, its minimization enables to find
task-adapted ranks automatically. Our method is evaluated in a realistic
few-shot fine-tuning setting, where we compare it first to the standard LoRA
and then to several other PEFT methods across two distinguishable tasks: base
organs and novel organs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the significant
performance improvements driven by our method, highlighting its efficiency and
robustness against suboptimal rank initialization. Our code is publicly

Abstract: The paper investigates the performance of state-of-the-art low-parameter deep
neural networks for computer vision, focusing on bottleneck architectures and
their behavior using superlinear activation functions. We address interference
in feature maps, a phenomenon associated with superposition, where neurons
simultaneously encode multiple characteristics. Our research suggests that
limiting interference can enhance scaling and accuracy in very low-scaled
networks (under 1.5M parameters). We identify key design elements that reduce
interference by examining various bottleneck architectures, leading to a more
efficient neural network. Consequently, we propose a proof-of-concept
architecture named NoDepth Bottleneck built on mechanistic insights from our
experiments, demonstrating robust scaling accuracy on the ImageNet dataset.
These findings contribute to more efficient and scalable neural networks for
the low-parameter range and advance the understanding of bottlenecks in
computer vision. https://caiac.pubpub.org/pub/3dh6rsel

Result: 在三个标准基准测试中表现优于现有半监督语义分割方法。

Conclusion: ConformalSAM能有效利用基础模型提升半监督学习性能，并可作为插件增强其他方法。

Abstract: Pixel-level vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation, require extensive
and high-quality annotated data, which is costly to obtain. Semi-supervised
semantic segmentation (SSSS) has emerged as a solution to alleviate the
labeling burden by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data through
self-training techniques. Meanwhile, the advent of foundational segmentation
models pre-trained on massive data, has shown the potential to generalize
across domains effectively. This work explores whether a foundational
segmentation model can address label scarcity in the pixel-level vision task as
an annotator for unlabeled images. Specifically, we investigate the efficacy of
using SEEM, a Segment Anything Model (SAM) variant fine-tuned for textual
input, to generate predictive masks for unlabeled data. To address the
shortcomings of using SEEM-generated masks as supervision, we propose
ConformalSAM, a novel SSSS framework which first calibrates the foundation
model using the target domain's labeled data and then filters out unreliable
pixel labels of unlabeled data so that only high-confidence labels are used as
supervision. By leveraging conformal prediction (CP) to adapt foundation models
to target data through uncertainty calibration, ConformalSAM exploits the
strong capability of the foundational segmentation model reliably which
benefits the early-stage learning, while a subsequent self-reliance training
strategy mitigates overfitting to SEEM-generated masks in the later training
stage. Our experiment demonstrates that, on three standard benchmarks of SSSS,
ConformalSAM achieves superior performance compared to recent SSSS methods and
helps boost the performance of those methods as a plug-in.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态注意力重分配（DARA）方法，以提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉信息利用上的能力，并引入了TrueMICL数据集来评估多模态上下文学习（MICL）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs在多模态上下文学习中过度依赖文本模式，忽视视觉线索，导致性能受限且难以评估。

Method: 提出DARA方法，通过重新平衡视觉和文本令牌的注意力来优化模型；同时构建TrueMICL数据集，明确要求整合多模态信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了多模态上下文学习的真实能力。

Conclusion: DARA和TrueMICL为提升和评估MICL性能提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language
backbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new
tasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and
answers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language
datasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the
demonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on
textual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal
adaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its
practical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the
improved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual
context. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably
evaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues,
we first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient
fine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by
rebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present
TrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that
explicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly
visual content-for correct task completion. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our holistic solution, showcasing substantial improvements
in the true multimodal in-context learning capabilities. Code and datasets are

Result: 测试显示统计稳健性显著提升，后验概率密度采样更优，计算成本降低。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在多元地下建模和反演中具有高效性和灵活性，适用于多种条件数据。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer stable training and state-of-the-art performance for
deep generative modeling tasks. Here, we consider their use in the context of
multivariate subsurface modeling and probabilistic inversion. We first
demonstrate that diffusion models enhance multivariate modeling capabilities
compared to variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks. In
diffusion modeling, the generative process involves a comparatively large
number of time steps with update rules that can be modified to account for
conditioning data. We propose different corrections to the popular Diffusion
Posterior Sampling approach by Chung et al. (2023). In particular, we introduce
a likelihood approximation accounting for the noise-contamination that is
inherent in diffusion modeling. We assess performance in a multivariate
geological scenario involving facies and correlated acoustic impedance.
Conditional modeling is demonstrated using both local hard data (well logs) and
nonlinear geophysics (fullstack seismic data). Our tests show significantly
improved statistical robustness, enhanced sampling of the posterior probability
density function and reduced computational costs, compared to the original
approach. The method can be used with both hard and indirect conditioning data,
individually or simultaneously. As the inversion is included within the
diffusion process, it is faster than other methods requiring an outer-loop
around the generative model, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2V模型在物理常识方面表现不足，生成的视频常违反直觉的因果关系、物体行为和工具使用等基本物理规律。

Method: 采用三阶段评估流程：1）从提示中提出物理问题；2）用视觉语言模型为生成视频生成字幕；3）让语言模型基于字幕回答物理问题。

Result: PhysVidBench提供了一个结构化、可解释的框架，用于评估生成视频模型的物理常识能力。

Conclusion: PhysVidBench填补了T2V评估中物理常识的空白，为未来模型改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-video (T2V) generation has enabled the synthesis
of visually compelling and temporally coherent videos from natural language.
However, these models often fall short in basic physical commonsense, producing
outputs that violate intuitive expectations around causality, object behavior,
and tool use. Addressing this gap, we present PhysVidBench, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the physical reasoning capabilities of T2V systems. The
benchmark includes 383 carefully curated prompts, emphasizing tool use,
material properties, and procedural interactions, and domains where physical
plausibility is crucial. For each prompt, we generate videos using diverse
state-of-the-art models and adopt a three-stage evaluation pipeline: (1)
formulate grounded physics questions from the prompt, (2) caption the generated
video with a vision-language model, and (3) task a language model to answer
several physics-involved questions using only the caption. This indirect
strategy circumvents common hallucination issues in direct video-based
evaluation. By highlighting affordances and tool-mediated actions, areas
overlooked in current T2V evaluations, PhysVidBench provides a structured,
interpretable framework for assessing physical commonsense in generative video
models.

TL;DR: 论文提出Segment Concept (SeC)框架，通过概念驱动的方法改进视频对象分割，结合视觉语言模型和动态特征匹配，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频对象分割技术依赖外观匹配，缺乏人类对对象的概念理解，导致在复杂场景中表现不佳。

Method: SeC利用大型视觉语言模型构建对象中心的高层表示，动态平衡语义推理和特征匹配。

Result: SeC在SeCVOS基准上比SAM 2.1提升11.8个百分点，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: SeC通过概念驱动的方法显著提升了视频对象分割的鲁棒性，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is a core task in computer vision, requiring
models to track and segment target objects across video frames. Despite notable
advances with recent efforts, current techniques still lag behind human
capabilities in handling drastic visual variations, occlusions, and complex
scene changes. This limitation arises from their reliance on appearance
matching, neglecting the human-like conceptual understanding of objects that
enables robust identification across temporal dynamics. Motivated by this gap,
we propose Segment Concept (SeC), a concept-driven segmentation framework that
shifts from conventional feature matching to the progressive construction and
utilization of high-level, object-centric representations. SeC employs Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to integrate visual cues across diverse frames,
constructing robust conceptual priors. During inference, SeC forms a
comprehensive semantic representation of the target based on processed frames,
realizing robust segmentation of follow-up frames. Furthermore, SeC adaptively
balances LVLM-based semantic reasoning with enhanced feature matching,
dynamically adjusting computational efforts based on scene complexity. To
rigorously assess VOS methods in scenarios demanding high-level conceptual
reasoning and robust semantic understanding, we introduce the Semantic Complex
Scenarios Video Object Segmentation benchmark (SeCVOS). SeCVOS comprises 160
manually annotated multi-scenario videos designed to challenge models with
substantial appearance variations and dynamic scene transformations. In
particular, SeC achieves an 11.8-point improvement over SAM 2.1 on SeCVOS,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in concept-aware video object segmentation.

Motivation: 现代生成模型在训练目标上具有相似性，即从噪声或掩码输入中重建干净信号（去噪）。作者希望通过优化分词器嵌入以更好地支持这一目标。

Method: 提出了l-DeTok，通过训练分词器从被插值噪声和随机掩码污染的潜在嵌入中重建干净图像。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256数据集上，l-DeTok在六种代表性生成模型中均优于标准分词器。

Conclusion: 去噪应成为分词器设计的基本原则，这一发现为未来分词器设计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite their fundamental role, it remains unclear what properties could make
visual tokenizers more effective for generative modeling. We observe that
modern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective --
reconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs such as Gaussian noise or
masking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose
aligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective,
encouraging latent embeddings to be more easily reconstructed even when heavily
corrupted. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer
(l-DeTok), a simple yet effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images
from latent embeddings corrupted by interpolative noise and random masking.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256x256 demonstrate that our tokenizer
consistently outperforms standard tokenizers across six representative
generative models. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design
principle for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new
perspectives for future tokenizer design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义通信技术在资源受限环境和变化信道条件下，难以平衡计算效率、带宽需求和图像分割精度。

Method: 在发射器和接收器之间分割语义图像分割过程，减少传输数据量并降低发射器的计算负载。

Result: 实验表明，与全部分割在发射器相比，传输比特率降低72%，发射器计算负载减少19%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于通信系统，特别是未来的6G系统，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Semantic communication represents a promising technique towards reducing
communication costs, especially when dealing with image segmentation, but it
still lacks a balance between computational efficiency and bandwidth
requirements while maintaining high image segmentation accuracy, particularly
in resource-limited environments and changing channel conditions. On the other
hand, the more complex and larger semantic image segmentation models become,
the more stressed the devices are when processing data. This paper proposes a
novel approach to implementing semantic communication based on splitting the
semantic image segmentation process between a resource constrained transmitter
and the receiver. This allows saving bandwidth by reducing the transmitted data
while maintaining the accuracy of the semantic image segmentation.
Additionally, it reduces the computational requirements at the resource
constrained transmitter compared to doing all the semantic image segmentation
in the transmitter. The proposed approach is evaluated by means of
simulation-based experiments in terms of different metrics such as
computational resource usage, required bit rate and segmentation accuracy. The
results when comparing the proposal with the full semantic image segmentation
in the transmitter show that up to 72% of the bit rate was reduced in the
transmission process. In addition, the computational load of the transmitter is
reduced by more than 19%. This reflects the interest of this technique for its
application in communication systems, particularly in the upcoming 6G systems.

Result: 在MSR-VTT数据集上实现75.3%的延迟降低，R@1=49.0。

Conclusion: ProCLIP在效率和准确性上均优于现有方法，适用于边缘设备。

Abstract: Enabling efficient text-video retrieval on edge-end devices is critical for
real-world applications. Yet, existing methods face a critical challenge in
balancing accuracy and computational efficiency: uniform frame sampling methods
ensure content coverage but incur prohibitive computational costs, while
salient-frame sampling methods reduce overhead but suffer from query-agnostic
frame selection that biases retrieval results. To address this, we propose
ProCLIP, a user-centric framework that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy with
significantly improved efficiency. We design a prompt-aware frame sampling
strategy that dynamically guides lightweight feature extractors using textual
prompts to select semantically relevant frames, overcoming the limitations of
existing salient-frame sampling methods which rely on static, query-agnostic
selection criteria. Moreover, we adopt a two-stage candidate pruning strategy
that combines rapid coarse filtering via a lightweight module with CLIP-powered
fine-grained re-ranking, enhancing retrieval efficiency while preserving
accuracy. Experiments across benchmarks show ProCLIP achieves 75.3% latency
reduction versus baselines while maintaining competitive accuracy, i.e.,
R@1=49.0 in MSR-VTT dataset. Code is available at

Abstract: 3D human motion forecasting aims to enable autonomous applications.
Estimating uncertainty for each prediction (i.e., confidence based on
probability density or quantile) is essential for safety-critical contexts like
human-robot collaboration to minimize risks. However, existing diverse motion
forecasting approaches struggle with uncertainty quantification due to implicit
probabilistic representations hindering uncertainty modeling. We propose
ProbHMI, which introduces invertible networks to parameterize poses in a
disentangled latent space, enabling probabilistic dynamics modeling. A
forecasting module then explicitly predicts future latent distributions,
allowing effective uncertainty quantification. Evaluated on benchmarks, ProbHMI
achieves strong performance for both deterministic and diverse prediction while
validating uncertainty calibration, critical for risk-aware decision making.

Abstract: Autonomous quadrotor flight in confined spaces such as pipes and tunnels
presents significant challenges due to unsteady, self-induced aerodynamic
disturbances. Very recent advances have enabled flight in such conditions, but
they either rely on constant motion through the pipe to mitigate airflow
recirculation effects or suffer from limited stability during hovering. In this
work, we present the first closed-loop control system for quadrotors for
hovering in narrow pipes that leverages real-time flow field measurements. We
develop a low-latency, event-based smoke velocimetry method that estimates
local airflow at high temporal resolution. This flow information is used by a
disturbance estimator based on a recurrent convolutional neural network, which
infers force and torque disturbances in real time. The estimated disturbances
are integrated into a learning-based controller trained via reinforcement
learning. The flow-feedback control proves particularly effective during
lateral translation maneuvers in the pipe cross-section. There, the real-time
disturbance information enables the controller to effectively counteract
transient aerodynamic effects, thereby preventing collisions with the pipe
wall. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first
demonstration of an aerial robot with closed-loop control informed by real-time
flow field measurements. This opens new directions for research on flight in
aerodynamically complex environments. In addition, our work also sheds light on
the characteristic flow structures that emerge during flight in narrow,
circular pipes, providing new insights at the intersection of robotics and
fluid dynamics.

Conclusion: 人类视觉机制为机器人视觉系统提供了有效的归纳偏置，未来可进一步探索其应用。

Abstract: Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs
attention and fixation to task-relevant regions and dramatically reduces visual
processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive,
uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how
incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance both
efficiency and performance. We build on recent advances in foveated image
processing and apply them to an Active Vision robot system that emulates both
human head movement and eye tracking. Extending prior work on the AV-ALOHA
robot simulation platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously
collecting eye-tracking data and robot demonstrations from a human operator as
well as a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that
incorporate human gaze. Given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs)
in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated
patch tokenization scheme inspired by recent work in image segmentation.
Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number
of tokens-and thus computation-without sacrificing visual fidelity near regions
of interest. We also explore two approaches to gaze imitation and prediction
from human data. The first is a two-stage model that predicts gaze to guide
foveation and action; the second integrates gaze into the action space,
allowing the policy to jointly predict gaze and actions end-to-end. Our results
show that our method for foveated robot vision not only drastically reduces
computational overhead, but also improves performance for high precision tasks
and robustness to unseen distractors. Together, these findings suggest that
human-inspired visual processing offers a useful inductive bias for robotic
vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/

Method: 使用变分自编码器（VAE）预训练学习事件表征，聚类生成弱监督信号，结合分类器优化检测边界。

Result: 在多机构数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SS2LD提供了一种高效、可扩展的病理HFO检测策略。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial Electroencephalography
(iEEG) are critical biomarkers for localizing the epileptogenic zone in
epilepsy treatment. However, traditional rule-based detectors for HFOs suffer
from unsatisfactory precision, producing false positives that require
time-consuming manual review. Supervised machine learning approaches have been
used to classify the detection results, yet they typically depend on labeled
datasets, which are difficult to acquire due to the need for specialized
expertise. Moreover, accurate labeling of HFOs is challenging due to low
inter-rater reliability and inconsistent annotation practices across
institutions. The lack of a clear consensus on what constitutes a pathological
HFO further challenges supervised refinement approaches. To address this, we
leverage the insight that legacy detectors reliably capture clinically relevant
signals despite their relatively high false positive rates. We thus propose the
Self-Supervised to Label Discovery (SS2LD) framework to refine the large set of
candidate events generated by legacy detectors into a precise set of
pathological HFOs. SS2LD employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) for
morphological pre-training to learn meaningful latent representation of the
detected events. These representations are clustered to derive weak supervision
for pathological events. A classifier then uses this supervision to refine
detection boundaries, trained on real and VAE-augmented data. Evaluated on
large multi-institutional interictal iEEG datasets, SS2LD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. SS2LD offers a scalable, label-efficient, and
clinically effective strategy to identify pathological HFOs using legacy
detectors.

TL;DR: WebGuard是一个针对LLM驱动的自主网络代理的安全数据集，旨在评估动作风险并开发防护措施。现有LLM在预测高风险动作上表现不佳，但微调模型显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM驱动的网络代理快速发展，其潜在风险（如无意或有害动作）亟需安全措施。WebGuard旨在填补这一空白，提供评估和防护工具。

Method: WebGuard包含4,939个人工标注的动作，覆盖193个网站和22个领域，采用三级风险分类（SAFE、LOW、HIGH）。通过微调Qwen2.5VL-7B模型提升性能。

Result: 前沿LLM在预测动作结果和高风险动作召回上表现不足（准确率<60%）。微调模型将准确率从37%提升至80%，高风险召回率从20%提升至76%。

Conclusion: 尽管微调模型显著改进，但其性能仍不足以满足高风险部署的可靠性要求，需进一步优化。

Abstract: The rapid development of autonomous web agents powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), while greatly elevating efficiency, exposes the frontier risk of
taking unintended or harmful actions. This situation underscores an urgent need
for effective safety measures, akin to access controls for human users. To
address this critical challenge, we introduce WebGuard, the first comprehensive
dataset designed to support the assessment of web agent action risks and
facilitate the development of guardrails for real-world online environments. In
doing so, WebGuard specifically focuses on predicting the outcome of
state-changing actions and contains 4,939 human-annotated actions from 193
websites across 22 diverse domains, including often-overlooked long-tail
websites. These actions are categorized using a novel three-tier risk schema:
SAFE, LOW, and HIGH. The dataset includes designated training and test splits
to support evaluation under diverse generalization settings. Our initial
evaluations reveal a concerning deficiency: even frontier LLMs achieve less
than 60% accuracy in predicting action outcomes and less than 60% recall in
lagging HIGH-risk actions, highlighting the risks of deploying
current-generation agents without dedicated safeguards. We therefore
investigate fine-tuning specialized guardrail models using WebGuard. We conduct
comprehensive evaluations across multiple generalization settings and find that
a fine-tuned Qwen2.5VL-7B model yields a substantial improvement in
performance, boosting accuracy from 37% to 80% and HIGH-risk action recall from
20% to 76%. Despite these improvements, the performance still falls short of
the reliability required for high-stakes deployment, where guardrails must
approach near-perfect accuracy and recall.

TL;DR: 研究发现，增加大型推理模型（LRMs）的推理长度会降低性能，表现为测试计算量与准确性的反比关系。研究识别了五种失败模式，并强调了评估模型在不同推理长度下的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨测试计算量扩展对模型推理能力的影响，揭示潜在问题模式。

Method: 构建四类评估任务（简单计数、回归、演绎和高级AI风险），分析模型在不同推理长度下的表现。

Result: 发现五种失败模式，包括分心、过拟合、虚假相关性、专注力下降和行为放大。

Conclusion: 测试计算量扩展虽有望提升模型能力，但可能强化问题推理模式，需多样化评估推理长度。

Abstract: We construct evaluation tasks where extending the reasoning length of Large
Reasoning Models (LRMs) deteriorates performance, exhibiting an inverse scaling
relationship between test-time compute and accuracy. Our evaluation tasks span
four categories: simple counting tasks with distractors, regression tasks with
spurious features, deduction tasks with constraint tracking, and advanced AI
risks. We identify five distinct failure modes when models reason for longer:
1) Claude models become increasingly distracted by irrelevant information; 2)
OpenAI o-series models resist distractors but overfit to problem framings; 3)
models shift from reasonable priors to spurious correlations; 4) all models
show difficulties in maintaining focus on complex deductive tasks; and 5)
extended reasoning may amplify concerning behaviors, with Claude Sonnet 4
showing increased expressions of self-preservation. These findings suggest that
while test-time compute scaling remains promising for improving model
capabilities, it may inadvertently reinforce problematic reasoning patterns.
Our results demonstrate the importance of evaluating models across diverse
reasoning lengths to identify and address these failure modes in LRMs.

TL;DR: 论文提出Routine框架，通过结构化规划和参数传递提升多步骤工具调用任务的执行稳定性，显著提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业环境中代理系统部署常因缺乏领域知识导致执行不稳定，需改进。

Method: 引入Routine框架，包含清晰结构、明确指令和参数传递，并构建训练数据集进行微调。

Result: Routine显著提升模型执行准确率（如GPT-4o从41.1%到96.3%），并通过蒸馏数据集进一步优化。

Conclusion: Routine有效提升代理系统稳定性和适应性，加速企业环境部署。

Abstract: The deployment of agent systems in an enterprise environment is often
hindered by several challenges: common models lack domain-specific process
knowledge, leading to disorganized plans, missing key tools, and poor execution
stability. To address this, this paper introduces Routine, a multi-step agent
planning framework designed with a clear structure, explicit instructions, and
seamless parameter passing to guide the agent's execution module in performing
multi-step tool-calling tasks with high stability. In evaluations conducted
within a real-world enterprise scenario, Routine significantly increases the
execution accuracy in model tool calls, increasing the performance of GPT-4o
from 41.1% to 96.3%, and Qwen3-14B from 32.6% to 83.3%. We further constructed
a Routine-following training dataset and fine-tuned Qwen3-14B, resulting in an
accuracy increase to 88.2% on scenario-specific evaluations, indicating
improved adherence to execution plans. In addition, we employed Routine-based
distillation to create a scenario-specific, multi-step tool-calling dataset.
Fine-tuning on this distilled dataset raised the model's accuracy to 95.5%,
approaching GPT-4o's performance. These results highlight Routine's
effectiveness in distilling domain-specific tool-usage patterns and enhancing
model adaptability to new scenarios. Our experimental results demonstrate that
Routine provides a practical and accessible approach to building stable agent
workflows, accelerating the deployment and adoption of agent systems in
enterprise environments, and advancing the technical vision of AI for Process.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了多智能体系统（MAS）在恶意合谋中的风险，提出了一个模拟框架，并发现去中心化系统在传播虚假信息和电商欺诈中更具破坏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统的普及，多智能体系统的潜在危害尚未充分研究，尤其是恶意合谋的风险。

Method: 开发了一个支持集中式和去中心化协调结构的框架，模拟恶意MAS行为，并应用于虚假信息传播和电商欺诈。

Result: 去中心化系统在实施恶意行为时更有效，且能规避传统干预措施。

Conclusion: 需开发更好的检测系统和应对措施以防范恶意MAS合谋。

Abstract: Recent large-scale events like election fraud and financial scams have shown
how harmful coordinated efforts by human groups can be. With the rise of
autonomous AI systems, there is growing concern that AI-driven groups could
also cause similar harm. While most AI safety research focuses on individual AI
systems, the risks posed by multi-agent systems (MAS) in complex real-world
situations are still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce a
proof-of-concept to simulate the risks of malicious MAS collusion, using a
flexible framework that supports both centralized and decentralized
coordination structures. We apply this framework to two high-risk fields:
misinformation spread and e-commerce fraud. Our findings show that
decentralized systems are more effective at carrying out malicious actions than
centralized ones. The increased autonomy of decentralized systems allows them
to adapt their strategies and cause more damage. Even when traditional
interventions, like content flagging, are applied, decentralized groups can
adjust their tactics to avoid detection. We present key insights into how these
malicious groups operate and the need for better detection systems and
countermeasures. Code is available at https://github.com/renqibing/RogueAgent.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为g-AMIE的多智能体系统，用于在医疗诊断对话中实现异步监督，确保患者安全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统在医疗诊断对话中表现优异，但个体化医疗建议需要专业医师监督。受此启发，研究旨在设计一种框架，使AI系统能在医师监督下高效运作。

Method: 提出g-AMIE系统，通过多智能体协作完成病史采集，并在限定范围内运行，避免提供个体化建议。医师通过临床驾驶舱界面进行异步监督。

Result: 在虚拟OSCE测试中，g-AMIE在病史采集、病例总结及诊断建议方面优于护士和医师助理组，且监督效率更高。

Conclusion: 异步监督是一种可行的模式，可在专家监督下提升AI系统在现实医疗中的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the promise of conversational AI systems for
diagnostic dialogue. However, real-world assurance of patient safety means that
providing individual diagnoses and treatment plans is considered a regulated
activity by licensed professionals. Furthermore, physicians commonly oversee
other team members in such activities, including nurse practitioners (NPs) or
physician assistants/associates (PAs). Inspired by this, we propose a framework
for effective, asynchronous oversight of the Articulate Medical Intelligence
Explorer (AMIE) AI system. We propose guardrailed-AMIE (g-AMIE), a multi-agent
system that performs history taking within guardrails, abstaining from
individualized medical advice. Afterwards, g-AMIE conveys assessments to an
overseeing primary care physician (PCP) in a clinician cockpit interface. The
PCP provides oversight and retains accountability of the clinical decision.
This effectively decouples oversight from intake and can thus happen
asynchronously. In a randomized, blinded virtual Objective Structured Clinical
Examination (OSCE) of text consultations with asynchronous oversight, we
compared g-AMIE to NPs/PAs or a group of PCPs under the same guardrails. Across
60 scenarios, g-AMIE outperformed both groups in performing high-quality
intake, summarizing cases, and proposing diagnoses and management plans for the
overseeing PCP to review. This resulted in higher quality composite decisions.
PCP oversight of g-AMIE was also more time-efficient than standalone PCP
consultations in prior work. While our study does not replicate existing
clinical practices and likely underestimates clinicians' capabilities, our
results demonstrate the promise of asynchronous oversight as a feasible
paradigm for diagnostic AI systems to operate under expert human oversight for
enhancing real-world care.

TL;DR: LAPO框架通过两阶段强化学习，使模型内化推理深度控制，减少40.9%的token使用并提升2.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大模型在简单问题上过度生成token的问题，将推理长度控制转化为模型内在能力。

Method: 两阶段强化学习：第一阶段学习成功解长度的统计分布，第二阶段将其作为元认知指导嵌入推理上下文。

Result: 在数学推理基准上，LAPO减少40.9%的token使用并提升2.3%的准确率。

Conclusion: LAPO使模型能根据问题复杂度分配计算资源，实现高效推理且不牺牲质量。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have achieved remarkable performance through extended
chain-of-thought sequences, yet this computational freedom leads to excessive
token generation even for simple problems. We present Length-Adaptive Policy
Optimization (LAPO), a novel framework that transforms reasoning length control
from an external constraint into an intrinsic model capability. Unlike existing
approaches that impose rigid limits or rely on post-hoc interventions, LAPO
enables models to internalize an understanding of appropriate reasoning depth
through a two-stage reinforcement learning process. In the first stage, models
learn natural reasoning patterns by discovering the statistical distribution of
successful solution lengths. The second stage leverages these patterns as
meta-cognitive guidance, embedding them directly within the model's reasoning
context to ensure inference-time flexibility. Experiments on mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that LAPO reduces token usage by up to 40.9\%
while improving accuracy by 2.3\%. Our analysis reveals that models trained
with LAPO develop emergent abilities to allocate computational resources based
on problem complexity, achieving efficient reasoning without sacrificing
quality.

TL;DR: HBPO是一种强化学习框架，通过分层预算探索和差异化奖励机制，使模型能根据问题复杂度自适应调整推理深度，显著提升效率（减少60.6%的token使用）并提高准确性（3.14%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型在生成链式思考时计算效率低下，因其对所有问题复杂度采用统一的推理策略。HBPO旨在解决这一效率与能力平衡的挑战。

Method: HBPO通过分层预算探索将样本分组，并为不同预算组设计差异化奖励机制，使模型能根据问题复杂度动态分配计算资源。

Result: 实验表明，HBPO在四个推理基准测试中平均减少60.6%的token使用，同时准确性提高3.14%。

Conclusion: HBPO证明推理效率与能力并非矛盾，可通过分层训练同时优化，且模型能自适应调整推理深度。

Abstract: Large reasoning models achieve remarkable performance through extensive
chain-of-thought generation, yet exhibit significant computational inefficiency
by applying uniform reasoning strategies regardless of problem complexity. We
present Hierarchical Budget Policy Optimization (HBPO), a reinforcement
learning framework that enables models to learn problem-specific reasoning
depths without sacrificing capability. HBPO addresses the fundamental challenge
of exploration space collapse in efficiency-oriented training, where penalties
on long output length systematically bias models away from necessary long
reasoning paths. Through hierarchical budget exploration, our approach
partitions rollout samples into multiple subgroups with distinct token budgets,
aiming to enable efficient resource allocation while preventing degradation of
capability. We introduce differentiated reward mechanisms that create
budget-aware incentives aligned with the complexity of the problem, allowing
models to discover natural correspondences between task requirements and
computational effort. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HBPO reduces
average token usage by up to 60.6% while improving accuracy by 3.14% across
four reasoning benchmarks. Unlike existing methods that impose external
constraints or rely on discrete mode selection, HBPO exhibits emergent adaptive
behavior where models automatically adjust reasoning depth based on problem
complexity. Our results suggest that reasoning efficiency and capability are
not inherently conflicting, and can be simultaneously optimized through
appropriately structured hierarchical training that preserves exploration
diversity.

TL;DR: 提出InsightX Agent框架，结合LMM、SDMSD和EGR工具，提升X射线无损检测的可靠性、可解释性和交互性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在X射线检测中缺乏交互性、可解释性和自我评估能力，影响可靠性和操作者信任。

Method: 采用LMM作为核心协调器，结合SDMSD生成多尺度缺陷区域提案，EGR工具通过链式思维验证和优化提案。

Result: 在GDXray+数据集上达到96.35%的F1分数，显著提升可解释性和可信度。

Conclusion: InsightX Agent展示了基于LMM的框架在工业检测中的变革潜力。

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT), particularly X-ray inspection, is vital for
industrial quality assurance, yet existing deep-learning-based approaches often
lack interactivity, interpretability, and the capacity for critical
self-assessment, limiting their reliability and operator trust. To address
these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based
agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive
X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent
positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator,
coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the
Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect
region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through
Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in
X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides
the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating
context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination,
confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the
SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using
tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning,
enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate
diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset
demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection
F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and
trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of
agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.

TL;DR: Chart-R1是一种基于强化学习微调的图表领域视觉语言模型，用于复杂图表推理。通过程序化数据合成技术和两阶段训练策略（Chart-COT和Chart-RFT），显著提升了图表推理能力。


<details>

Motivation: 验证R1-Style方法在通用多模态数据（如图表）上的优势，填补图表领域推理数据的不足。

Method: 1. 提出程序化数据合成技术生成高质量图表推理数据；2. 开发两阶段训练策略：Chart-COT（逐步监督）和Chart-RFT（数值敏感的强化微调）。

Result: 实验表明，Chart-R1在图表领域具有显著优势，甚至可与GPT-4o等大型模型媲美。

Conclusion: Chart-R1为图表推理提供了高效解决方案，强化学习微调在多模态任务中具有潜力。

Abstract: Recently, inspired by OpenAI-o1/o3 and Deepseek-R1, the R1-Style method based
on reinforcement learning fine-tuning has received widespread attention from
the community. Previous R1-Style methods mainly focus on mathematical reasoning
and code intelligence. It is of great research significance to verify their
advantages on more general multimodal data. Chart is an important multimodal
data type with rich information, which brings important research challenges in
complex reasoning. In this work, we introduce Chart-R1, a chart-domain
vision-language model with reinforcement learning fine-tuning to enable complex
chart reasoning. To support Chart-R1, we first propose a novel programmatic
data synthesis technology to generate high-quality step-by-step chart reasoning
data covering single- and multi-subcharts, which makes up for the lack of
reasoning data in the chart domain. Then we develop a two-stage training
strategy: Chart-COT with step-by-step chain-of-thought supervision, and
Chart-RFT with numerically sensitive reinforcement fine-tuning. Chart-COT aims
to decompose complex chart reasoning tasks into fine-grained, understandable
subtasks through step-by-step supervision, which lays a good foundation for
improving the reasoning level of reinforcement learning. Chart-RFT utilize the
typical group relative policy optimization strategy, in which a relatively soft
reward is adopted for numerical response to emphasize the numerical sensitivity
in the chart domain. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source benchmarks
and self-built chart reasoning dataset (\emph{i.e., ChartRQA}). Experimental
results show that Chart-R1 has significant advantages compared to chart-domain
methods, even comparable to open/closed source large-scale models (\emph{e.g.,
GPT-4o, Claude-3.5}).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实安全分析师需处理大量异构警报和日志，而LLM代理的自动调查潜力巨大，但缺乏评估工具。

Method: 构建包含8次模拟攻击、57个日志表和589个问题的数据集，利用专家逻辑生成调查图，并通过LLM生成问题。

Result: 实验显示任务难度高，最佳模型得分仅0.368，表明未来研究空间大。

Conclusion: ExCyTIn-Bench为LLM代理的开发与评估提供了可扩展、可解释的基准，支持强化学习训练。

Abstract: We present ExCyTIn-Bench, the first benchmark to Evaluate an LLM agent x on
the task of Cyber Threat Investigation through security questions derived from
investigation graphs. Real-world security analysts must sift through a large
number of heterogeneous alert signals and security logs, follow multi-hop
chains of evidence, and compile an incident report. With the developments of
LLMs, building LLM-based agents for automatic thread investigation is a
promising direction. To assist the development and evaluation of LLM agents, we
construct a dataset from a controlled Azure tenant that covers 8 simulated
real-world multi-step attacks, 57 log tables from Microsoft Sentinel and
related services, and 589 automatically generated questions. We leverage
security logs extracted with expert-crafted detection logic to build threat
investigation graphs, and then generate questions with LLMs using paired nodes
on the graph, taking the start node as background context and the end node as
answer. Anchoring each question to these explicit nodes and edges not only
provides automatic, explainable ground truth answers but also makes the
pipeline reusable and readily extensible to new logs. This also enables the
automatic generation of procedural tasks with verifiable rewards, which can be
naturally extended to training agents via reinforcement learning. Our
comprehensive experiments with different models confirm the difficulty of the
task: with the base setting, the average reward across all evaluated models is
0.249, and the best achieved is 0.368, leaving substantial headroom for future
research. Code and data are coming soon!

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉Transformer模型及其解释模型被认为安全且难以欺骗，但成功攻击可能导致严重后果。现有研究未充分考虑攻击对模型解释的影响。

Method: 提出AdViT攻击方法，生成能同时误导Transformer模型及其解释模型的对抗样本，并在多种模型和解释器上进行实验。

Result: AdViT在白盒和黑盒场景下攻击成功率均为100%，白盒场景下误分类置信度达98%，黑盒场景下达76%，且生成的对抗样本解释准确。

Conclusion: AdViT揭示了Transformer模型及其解释模型在对抗攻击中的脆弱性，表明现有安全措施仍需改进。

Abstract: Vision transformer (ViT) models, when coupled with interpretation models, are
regarded as secure and challenging to deceive, making them well-suited for
security-critical domains such as medical applications, autonomous vehicles,
drones, and robotics. However, successful attacks on these systems can lead to
severe consequences. Recent research on threats targeting ViT models primarily
focuses on generating the smallest adversarial perturbations that can deceive
the models with high confidence, without considering their impact on model
interpretations. Nevertheless, the use of interpretation models can effectively
assist in detecting adversarial examples. This study investigates the
vulnerability of transformer models to adversarial attacks, even when combined
with interpretation models. We propose an attack called "AdViT" that generates
adversarial examples capable of misleading both a given transformer model and
its coupled interpretation model. Through extensive experiments on various
transformer models and two transformer-based interpreters, we demonstrate that
AdViT achieves a 100% attack success rate in both white-box and black-box
scenarios. In white-box scenarios, it reaches up to 98% misclassification
confidence, while in black-box scenarios, it reaches up to 76%
misclassification confidence. Remarkably, AdViT consistently generates accurate
interpretations in both scenarios, making the adversarial examples more
difficult to detect.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了ChatGPT在结构化演绎定性编码中的应用，通过四种干预方法测试其在分类任务中的表现，发现逐步任务分解策略效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究多关注归纳编码，而LLMs在演绎分类任务中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用CAP主代码本对最高法院案例进行分类，测试零样本、少样本、定义法和逐步任务分解四种策略。

Result: 逐步任务分解策略表现最佳（准确率0.775），分类行为受干预策略显著影响。

Conclusion: 通过定制干预，LLMs可达到适合严格定性编码工作流程的可靠性。

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs),
specifically ChatGPT, for structured deductive qualitative coding. While most
current research emphasizes inductive coding applications, we address the
underexplored potential of LLMs to perform deductive classification tasks
aligned with established human-coded schemes. Using the Comparative Agendas
Project (CAP) Master Codebook, we classified U.S. Supreme Court case summaries
into 21 major policy domains. We tested four intervention methods: zero-shot,
few-shot, definition-based, and a novel Step-by-Step Task Decomposition
strategy, across repeated samples. Performance was evaluated using standard
classification metrics (accuracy, F1-score, Cohen's kappa, Krippendorff's
alpha), and construct validity was assessed using chi-squared tests and
Cramer's V. Chi-squared and effect size analyses confirmed that intervention
strategies significantly influenced classification behavior, with Cramer's V
values ranging from 0.359 to 0.613, indicating moderate to strong shifts in
classification patterns. The Step-by-Step Task Decomposition strategy achieved
the strongest reliability (accuracy = 0.775, kappa = 0.744, alpha = 0.746),
achieving thresholds for substantial agreement. Despite the semantic ambiguity
within case summaries, ChatGPT displayed stable agreement across samples,
including high F1 scores in low-support subclasses. These findings demonstrate
that with targeted, custom-tailored interventions, LLMs can achieve reliability
levels suitable for integration into rigorous qualitative coding workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音转换模型在实时性、语义保真和未见说话人适应性方面表现不佳，Conan旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Conan包含流式内容提取器（Emformer）、自适应风格编码器和因果混洗声码器（HiFiGAN）。

Result: 实验表明，Conan在主观和客观指标上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: Conan为实时零样本语音转换提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot online voice conversion (VC) holds significant promise for
real-time communications and entertainment. However, current VC models struggle
to preserve semantic fidelity under real-time constraints, deliver
natural-sounding conversions, and adapt effectively to unseen speaker
characteristics. To address these challenges, we introduce Conan, a chunkwise
online zero-shot voice conversion model that preserves the content of the
source while matching the voice timbre and styles of reference speech. Conan
comprises three core components: 1) a Stream Content Extractor that leverages
Emformer for low-latency streaming content encoding; 2) an Adaptive Style
Encoder that extracts fine-grained stylistic features from reference speech for
enhanced style adaptation; 3) a Causal Shuffle Vocoder that implements a fully
causal HiFiGAN using a pixel-shuffle mechanism. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that Conan outperforms baseline models in subjective and objective
metrics. Audio samples can be found at https://aaronz345.github.io/ConanDemo.

### [249] [Towards a Proactive Autoscaling Framework for Data Stream Processing at the Edge using GRU and Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14597)
*Eugene Armah,Linda Amoako Bannning*

Main category: cs.DC

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种三步解决方案，用于主动边缘流处理自动扩展问题，包括负载预测、迁移学习和动态并行度调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数字经济的快速发展，高速数据处理变得至关重要。边缘计算和流处理面临资源分配不足或浪费的问题，现有方法多为被动响应，难以满足需求。

Method: 1. 使用GRU神经网络预测上游负载；2. 通过迁移学习框架将预测模型集成到在线系统中；3. 基于预测负载动态调整操作并行度。

Result: GRU模型在真实数据集上SMAPE值低至1.3%，优于CNN、ARIMA和Prophet，且训练时间短于强化学习模型。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在负载预测和资源动态分配方面表现优异，为边缘流处理提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Processing data at high speeds is becoming increasingly critical as digital
economies generate enormous data. The current paradigms for timely data
processing are edge computing and data stream processing (DSP). Edge computing
places resources closer to where data is generated, while stream processing
analyzes the unbounded high-speed data in motion. However, edge stream
processing faces rapid workload fluctuations, complicating resource
provisioning. Inadequate resource allocation leads to bottlenecks, whereas
excess allocation results in wastage. Existing reactive methods, such as
threshold-based policies and queuing theory scale only after performance
degrades, potentially violating SLAs. Although reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a proactive approach through agents that learn optimal runtime
adaptation policies, it requires extensive simulation. Furthermore, predictive
machine learning models face online distribution and concept drift that
minimize their accuracy. We propose a three-step solution to the proactive edge
stream processing autoscaling problem. Firstly, a GRU neural network forecasts
the upstream load using real-world and synthetic DSP datasets. Secondly, a
transfer learning framework integrates the predictive model into an online
stream processing system using the DTW algorithm and joint distribution
adaptation to handle the disparities between offline and online domains.
Finally, a horizontal autoscaling module dynamically adjusts the degree of
operator parallelism, based on predicted load while considering edge resource
constraints. The lightweight GRU model for load predictions recorded up to
1.3\% SMAPE value on a real-world data set. It outperformed CNN, ARIMA, and
Prophet on the SMAPE and RMSE evaluation metrics, with lower training time than
the computationally intensive RL models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语音时间动态的上下文相关时长嵌入方法，用于表征说话人特征，并开发了新的攻击模型，显著提升了说话人验证性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音的时间动态（如节奏、语调和语速）包含独特的说话人身份信息，但现有方法对其表征能力有限。

Method: 提取上下文相关的时长嵌入，并基于此开发攻击模型，分析说话人验证和语音匿名化系统的潜在漏洞。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在原始和匿名数据上的说话人验证性能显著优于文献中的简单表征方法。

Conclusion: 上下文相关的时长嵌入能有效表征说话人特征，提升系统性能，同时揭示潜在安全风险。

Abstract: The temporal dynamics of speech, encompassing variations in rhythm,
intonation, and speaking rate, contain important and unique information about
speaker identity. This paper proposes a new method for representing speaker
characteristics by extracting context-dependent duration embeddings from speech
temporal dynamics. We develop novel attack models using these representations
and analyze the potential vulnerabilities in speaker verification and voice
anonymization systems.The experimental results show that the developed attack
models provide a significant improvement in speaker verification performance
for both original and anonymized data in comparison with simpler
representations of speech temporal dynamics reported in the literature.

Motivation: 解决为未见说话人生成语音和支持多样印度语言的挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法在多种印度语言上表现优异，为零样本生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present a speaker conditioned text-to-speech (TTS) system aimed at
addressing challenges in generating speech for unseen speakers and supporting
diverse Indian languages. Our method leverages a diffusion-based TTS
architecture, where a speaker encoder extracts embeddings from short reference
audio samples to condition the DDPM decoder for multispeaker generation. To
further enhance prosody and naturalness, we employ a cross-attention based
duration prediction mechanism that utilizes reference audio, enabling more
accurate and speaker consistent timing. This results in speech that closely
resembles the target speaker while improving duration modeling and overall
expressiveness. Additionally, to improve zero-shot generation, we employed
classifier free guidance, allowing the system to generate speech more near
speech for unknown speakers. Using this approach, we trained language-specific
speaker-conditioned models. Using the IndicSUPERB dataset for multiple Indian
languages such as Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Marathi, Malayalam, Punjabi and

### [252] [A Sparsity Predicting Approach for Large Language Models via Activation Pattern Clustering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14179)
*Nobel Dhar,Bobin Deng,Md Romyull Islam,Xinyue Zhang,Kazi Fahim Ahmad Nasif,Kun Suo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于聚类的激活模式压缩框架，通过将相似的激活模式分组为少量代表性聚类，高效预测和利用大型语言模型中的激活稀疏性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的激活稀疏性为降低计算成本提供了机会，但直接预测神经元级别的激活模式计算成本过高。

Method: 提出聚类框架，将相似激活模式分组为少量代表性聚类，通过预测聚类分配而非单个神经元状态来降低计算开销。

Result: 聚类精度达79.34%，困惑度（PPL）得分最低为12.49，表明在保持模型质量的同时显著减少计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法为激活模式预测提供了高效基础，有望提升大规模语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant activation sparsity, where
only a subset of neurons are active for a given input. Although this sparsity
presents opportunities to reduce computational cost, efficiently utilizing it
requires predicting activation patterns in a scalable manner. However, direct
prediction at the neuron level is computationally expensive due to the vast
number of neurons in modern LLMs. To enable efficient prediction and
utilization of activation sparsity, we propose a clustering-based activation
pattern compression framework. Instead of treating each neuron independently,
we group similar activation patterns into a small set of representative
clusters. Our method achieves up to 79.34% clustering precision, outperforming
standard binary clustering approaches while maintaining minimal degradation in
perplexity (PPL) scores. With a sufficiently large number of clusters, our
approach attains a PPL score as low as 12.49, demonstrating its effectiveness
in preserving model quality while reducing computational overhead. By
predicting cluster assignments rather than individual neuron states, future
models can efficiently infer activation patterns from pre-computed centroids.
We detail the clustering algorithm, analyze its effectiveness in capturing
meaningful activation structures, and demonstrate its potential to improve
sparse computation efficiency. This clustering-based formulation serves as a
foundation for future work on activation pattern prediction, paving the way for
efficient inference in large-scale language models.

TL;DR: LaCache是一种无需训练的KV缓存优化方法，通过阶梯式KV缓存模式和迭代压缩机制，提升LLMs的长距离建模能力和连续生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着序列长度增加，LLMs中的KV对数量激增，导致效率瓶颈，亟需一种高效且无需训练的方法来优化KV缓存。

Method: LaCache采用阶梯式KV缓存模式（跨层存储KV对）和迭代压缩机制（动态压缩旧缓存），以固定缓存预算提升长距离依赖捕捉和连续生成能力。

Result: 实验表明，LaCache在各种任务、基准和LLM模型中均能有效增强长距离能力。

Conclusion: LaCache为LLMs的长距离建模和连续生成提供了一种高效、无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in
numerous applications requiring robust long-range capabilities, essential for
processing extensive input contexts and continuously generating extended
outputs. As sequence lengths increase, the number of Key-Value (KV) pairs in
LLMs escalates, creating a significant efficiency bottleneck. In this paper, we
propose a new KV cache optimization paradigm called LaCache, a training-free
method for efficient and accurate generative inference of LLMs. LaCache enables
LLMs to simultaneously address both of the critical challenges in long-range
modeling: robust long-range capabilities and continuous generation without
running out-of-memory (OOM). Specifically, LaCache integrates two key
innovations: (1) a ladder-shaped KV cache pattern that stores KV pairs not only
sequentially (left-to-right within each layer) but also across layers (from
shallow to deep), providing an extended span for capturing long-range
dependencies under a fixed storage budget, thereby boosting long-range
capabilities; and (2) an iterative compaction mechanism that progressively
compresses older caches, freeing up space for new tokens within a fixed cache
size. This token distance-based dynamic compression enables more effective
continuous generation under constrained cache budgets. Experiments across
various tasks, benchmarks, and LLM models consistently validate LaCache's
effectiveness in enhancing LLMs' long-range capabilities. Our code is available

TL;DR: Solo Connection是一种新的参数高效微调方法，通过调整解码器块级别的表示而非单个权重矩阵，显著减少可训练参数数量，并在自然语言生成任务中优于LoRA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受同伦理论启发，Solo Connection旨在通过逐步插值任务特定表示，实现平滑稳定的适应，同时解决大型语言模型中长跳跃连接的需求。

Method: Solo Connection引入可训练的线性变换，逐步插值零向量和任务特定表示，并在解码器块之间建立长跳跃连接。

Result: Solo Connection在E2E自然语言生成任务中优于LoRA，可训练参数减少59%（相比LoRA）和99%以上（相比全微调）。

Conclusion: Solo Connection为大型语言模型的高效微调提供了新思路，尤其在长跳跃连接的应用中表现出潜力。

Abstract: Parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) is a versatile and extensible approach
for adapting a Large Language Model (LLM) for newer tasks. One of the most
prominent PEFT approaches, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), primarily focuses on
adjusting the attention weight matrices within individual decoder blocks of a
Generative Pre trained Transformer (GPT2). In contrast, we introduce Solo
Connection a novel method that adapts the representation at the decoder-block
level rather than modifying individual weight matrices. Not only does Solo
Connection outperform LoRA on E2E natural language generation benchmarks, but
it also reduces the number of trainable parameters by 59% relative to LoRA and
by more than 99% compared to full fine-tuning of GPT2, an early version of
Large Language Models (LLMs). Solo Connection is also motivated by homotopy
theory: we introduce a trainable linear transformation that gradually
interpolates between a zero vector and the task-specific representation,
enabling smooth and stable adaptation over time. While skip connections in the
original 12 layer GPT2 are typically confined to individual decoder blocks,
subsequent GPT2 variants scale up to 48 layers, and even larger language models
can include 128 or more decoder blocks. These expanded architectures underscore
the need to revisit how skip connections are employed during fine-tuning. This
paper focuses on long skip connections that link outputs of different decoder
blocks, potentially enhancing the model's ability to adapt to new tasks while
leveraging pre-trained knowledge.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了简单测试时缩放方法，发现其主要通过限制最大长度实现缩放，而通过追加“Wait”的方式会导致不一致性。o1类模型通过强化学习自然扩展计算能力，性能优于简单缩放方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究简单测试时缩放方法的有效性，明确其与o1类模型在性能扩展上的差异。

Method: 分析简单测试时缩放方法，包括限制最大长度和追加“Wait”两种方式，并与o1类模型的自然扩展能力对比。

Result: 限制最大长度的缩放方式有效，而追加“Wait”会导致模型解决方案不一致。o1类模型通过强化学习自然扩展计算能力，性能更优。

Conclusion: 简单测试时缩放方法仅能模拟缩放行为，而o1类模型的自然扩展能力能实现更高性能，目标应为解锁模型潜力而非仅复制缩放行为。

Abstract: Prior work proposed simple test-time scaling, a method for replicating this
scaling behavior with models distilled from o1-like models by manually
controlling test-time compute: either scaling down by enforcing a maximum
length or scaling up by iteratively appending "Wait" when the model is about to
terminate its generation. This paper presents an analysis of simple test-time
scaling and finds that the scaling behavior is largely attributed to scaling
down by enforcing a maximum length. In contrast, fine-tuning on long CoT data
distilled from o1-like models has no significant impact on scaling behavior,
and scaling up by appending "Wait" leads to inconsistencies, as the model may
oscillate between solutions. A key distinction exists between scaling down by
enforcing a maximum length and scaling up test-time compute in o1-like models,
such as DeepSeek-R1\@. These models are typically allowed to utilize as much
compute as needed, with the only constraint being the model's maximum supported
length. By learning to naturally scale up test-time compute during
reinforcement learning, o1-like models surpass their peak performance when
scaling up. In contrast, simple test-time scaling progressively imposes a lower
upper limit on model performance as it scales down. While replicating the
test-time scaling behavior of o1 models can be straightforward by scaling down,
it is crucial to recognize that the goal of scaling test-time compute is to
unlock higher performance -- beyond what the model could originally achieve --
rather than merely reproducing the appearance of scaling behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联网垃圾文本的快速增长带来了信息泄露和社会不稳定等风险，需要有效的检测机制。本文旨在解决垃圾信息发送者的对抗策略和标注数据稀缺两大挑战。

Method: 1. 字符相似性网络捕捉拼写和语音特征以应对字符混淆攻击；2. 对比学习优化垃圾文本与正常文本的潜在空间距离；3. 使用GAN生成伪垃圾样本以缓解数据稀缺问题。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验表明，GCC-Spam模型在检测率和标注数据效率上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GCC-Spam框架通过多技术创新有效提升了垃圾文本检测的鲁棒性和准确性，尤其在数据稀缺情况下表现突出。

Abstract: The exponential growth of spam text on the Internet necessitates robust
detection mechanisms to mitigate risks such as information leakage and social
instability. This work addresses two principal challenges: adversarial
strategies employed by spammers and the scarcity of labeled data. We propose a
novel spam-text detection framework GCC-Spam, which integrates three core
innovations. First, a character similarity network captures orthographic and
phonetic features to counter character-obfuscation attacks and furthermore
produces sentence embeddings for downstream classification. Second, contrastive
learning enhances discriminability by optimizing the latent-space distance
between spam and normal texts. Third, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
generates realistic pseudo-spam samples to alleviate data scarcity while
improving model robustness and classification accuracy. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms baseline
approaches, achieving higher detection rates with significantly fewer labeled
examples.

*Fang Wu,Weihao Xuan,Ximing Lu,Zaid Harchaoui,Yejin Choi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RLVR能提升AI在复杂逻辑任务中的表现，但可能受限于基础模型的支持范围，无法真正扩展推理边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨RLVR是否能扩展模型的推理能力，还是仅放大已知高奖励输出以提高精度。

Method: 结合理论和实证研究，分析RLVR的潜在限制，包括基础模型支持和熵-奖励权衡。

Result: RLVR虽提高精度，但可能限制探索，导致忽视正确但低概率的解；实证显示支持范围缩小。

Conclusion: RLVR在扩展推理能力上存在局限，未来需结合探索机制或混合策略突破限制。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models highlight Reinforcement Learning
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a promising method for enhancing AI's
capabilities, particularly in solving complex logical tasks. However, it
remains unclear whether RLVR truly expands a model's reasoning boundary or
merely amplifies high-reward outputs that the base model already knows for
improved precision. This study presents a theoretical and empirical
investigation that provides fresh insights into the potential limits of RLVR.
First, we offer a new theoretical perspective that RLVR is constrained by the
base model's support-unable to sample solutions with zero initial
probability-and operates as a conservative reweighting mechanism that may
restrict the discovery of entirely original solutions. We also identify an
entropy-reward tradeoff: while RLVR reliably enhances precision, it may
progressively narrow exploration and potentially overlook correct yet
underrepresented solutions. Extensive empirical experiments validate that while
RLVR consistently improves pass@1, the shrinkage of empirical support generally
outweighs the expansion of empirical support under larger sampling budgets,
failing to recover correct answers that were previously accessible to the base
model. Interestingly, we also observe that while RLVR sometimes increases
token-level entropy, resulting in greater uncertainty at each generation step,
answer-level entropy declines, indicating that these seemingly more uncertain
paths ultimately converge onto a smaller set of distinct answers. Taken
together, these findings reveal potential limits of RLVR in extending reasoning
horizons. Breaking this invisible leash may require future algorithmic
innovations such as explicit exploration mechanisms or hybrid strategies that
seed probability mass into underrepresented solution regions.

Conclusion: LSDGNN通过多模态特征捕捉和优化数据学习策略，显著提升了对话情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a practical and challenging
task. This paper proposes a novel multimodal approach, the Long-Short Distance
Graph Neural Network (LSDGNN). Based on the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), it
constructs a long-distance graph neural network and a short-distance graph
neural network to obtain multimodal features of distant and nearby utterances,
respectively. To ensure that long- and short-distance features are as distinct
as possible in representation while enabling mutual influence between the two
modules, we employ a Differential Regularizer and incorporate a BiAffine Module
to facilitate feature interaction. In addition, we propose an Improved
Curriculum Learning (ICL) to address the challenge of data imbalance. By
computing the similarity between different emotions to emphasize the shifts in
similar emotions, we design a "weighted emotional shift" metric and develop a
difficulty measurer, enabling a training process that prioritizes learning easy
samples before harder ones. Experimental results on the IEMOCAP and MELD
datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms existing benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling (OCRM)的方法，解决了强化学习从人类反馈（RLHF）中因分布偏移导致的奖励模型不准确问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在RLHF训练中，语言模型（LM）生成的响应逐渐偏离奖励模型（RM）训练时的分布，导致RM评分不准确（过优化问题）。

Method: 提出OCRM方法，通过重要性加权迭代修正RM，无需新标签或样本，从而提升RM准确性。

Result: 实验验证OCRM在摘要和聊天机器人任务中显著优于标准RLHF方法。

Conclusion: OCRM有效解决了RM因分布偏移导致的不准确问题，提升了最终策略性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) allows us to train models,
such as language models (LMs), to follow complex human preferences. In RLHF for
LMs, we first train an LM using supervised fine-tuning, sample pairs of
responses, obtain human feedback, and use the resulting data to train a reward
model (RM). RL methods are then used to train the LM to maximize the reward
given by the RM. As training progresses, the responses generated by the LM no
longer resemble the responses seen by the RM during training, leading to the RM
becoming inaccurate. The score given by the RM keeps increasing, but the
learned behavior no longer matches the human preferences. This issue is known
as overoptimization. We investigate overoptimization from the point of view of
distribution shift and show that the shift results in an inconsistent estimate
of the RM parameters, leading to an inconsistent estimate of the policy
gradient. We propose Off-Policy Corrected Reward Modeling (OCRM), which
iteratively off-policy corrects the RM using importance weighting, without
requiring new labels or samples. This results in a more accurate RM, which
empirically leads to an improved final policy. We validate our approach in
experiments with summarization and chatbot datasets and show that it performs
significantly better than standard RLHF methods and baselines. Our
implementation is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的端到端框架Data Mixing Agent，用于自动调整源领域和目标领域数据的权重，以平衡性能，避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决持续预训练中手动调整数据权重依赖直觉或经验的问题，提出更通用的参数化启发式方法。

Method: 通过强化学习训练Data Mixing Agent，学习从大量数据混合轨迹中提取通用启发式规则。

Result: 在数学推理任务中表现优于基线，能泛化到未见过的领域、模型和空间，且与人类直觉一致。

Conclusion: Data Mixing Agent是一种高效、通用的解决方案，适用于多领域持续预训练。

Abstract: Continual pre-training on small-scale task-specific data is an effective
method for improving large language models in new target fields, yet it risks
catastrophic forgetting of their original capabilities. A common solution is to
re-weight training data mixtures from source and target fields on a domain
space to achieve balanced performance. Previous domain reweighting strategies
rely on manual designation with certain heuristics based on human intuition or
empirical results. In this work, we prove that more general heuristics can be
parameterized by proposing Data Mixing Agent, the first model-based, end-to-end
framework that learns to re-weight domains. The agent learns generalizable
heuristics through reinforcement learning on large quantities of data mixing
trajectories with corresponding feedback from an evaluation environment.
Experiments in continual pre-training on math reasoning show that Data Mixing
Agent outperforms strong baselines in achieving balanced performance across
source and target field benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes well across
unseen source fields, target models, and domain spaces without retraining.
Direct application to the code generation field also indicates its adaptability
across target domains. Further analysis showcases the agents' well-aligned
heuristics with human intuitions and their efficiency in achieving superior
model performance with less source-field data.

Motivation: 探索强化学习是否能赋予LLM更细腻的人类社交智能（如心理理论），以提升其推理能力。

Method: 使用RLVR（带可验证奖励的强化学习）训练小规模LLM，并在多种ToM数据集上评估其泛化能力。

Result: 小规模LLM无法获得通用ToM能力，仅能过拟合训练数据，泛化表现差。

Conclusion: RL训练导致模型过拟合，未能真正掌握抽象ToM能力，需进一步研究更有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
emergent capabilities in complex reasoning, largely spurred by rule-based
Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques applied during the post-training. This
has raised the question of whether similar methods can instill more nuanced,
human-like social intelligence, such as a Theory of Mind (ToM), in LLMs. This
paper investigates whether small-scale LLMs can acquire a robust and
generalizable ToM capability through RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR). We
conduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of
prominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for
generalization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that
small LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability. While performance on
in-distribution tasks improves, this capability fails to transfer to unseen ToM
tasks with different characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
prolonged RL training leads to models ``hacking'' the statistical patterns of
the training datasets, resulting in significant performance gains on in-domain
data but no change, or degradation of performance on out-of-distribution tasks.
This suggests the learned behavior is a form of narrow overfitting rather than
the acquisition of a true, abstract ToM capability.

of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally
forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI
Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that
models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface
plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point
rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions
centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment
by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target
regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance
mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions.
This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to
dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich
gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions.
Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro
benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of
24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides
superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to
unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI
interaction tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件生成问题的知识蒸馏框架GenDD，通过Split Tokenization和Distribution Contraction技术解决了高维优化和标签语义监督不足的问题，实验表明其性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法在高维优化和缺乏标签语义监督时效果不佳，需要一种更高效的框架。

Method: 采用Split Tokenization实现稳定无监督蒸馏，结合Distribution Contraction引入标签监督。

Result: 在无监督设置下显著优于基线（ImageNet上提升16.29%），监督训练下ResNet-50达到82.28% top-1准确率。

Conclusion: GenDD框架在知识蒸馏中表现出色，尤其在无监督和监督任务中均取得显著效果。

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the knowledge distillation (KD) as a conditional
generative problem and propose the \textit{Generative Distribution Distillation
(GenDD)} framework. A naive \textit{GenDD} baseline encounters two major
challenges: the curse of high-dimensional optimization and the lack of semantic
supervision from labels. To address these issues, we introduce a \textit{Split
Tokenization} strategy, achieving stable and effective unsupervised KD.
Additionally, we develop the \textit{Distribution Contraction} technique to
integrate label supervision into the reconstruction objective. Our theoretical
proof demonstrates that \textit{GenDD} with \textit{Distribution Contraction}
serves as a gradient-level surrogate for multi-task learning, realizing
efficient supervised training without explicit classification loss on
multi-step sampling image representations. To evaluate the effectiveness of our
method, we conduct experiments on balanced, imbalanced, and unlabeled data.
Experimental results show that \textit{GenDD} performs competitively in the
unsupervised setting, significantly surpassing KL baseline by \textbf{16.29\%}
on ImageNet validation set. With label supervision, our ResNet-50 achieves
\textbf{82.28\%} top-1 accuracy on ImageNet in 600 epochs training,
establishing a new state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 揭示自注意力机制与亲和矩阵计算原则的共同数学基础，统一不同领域的机器学习研究。

Method: 通过分析自注意力与Inf-FS的相似性，比较两者在亲和矩阵定义和应用上的差异。

Result: 自注意力是Inf-FS的单跳特例，两者共享基于成对关系的计算结构。

Conclusion: 自注意力属于更广泛的亲和矩阵计算范式，为统一不同模型和任务提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The self-attention mechanism, now central to deep learning architectures such
as Transformers, is a modern instance of a more general computational
principle: learning and using pairwise affinity matrices to control how
information flows through a model. This paper traces the conceptual origins of
self-attention across multiple domains, including computer vision, natural
language processing, and graph learning, through their shared reliance on an
affinity matrix, denoted as A. We highlight Infinite Feature Selection (Inf-FS)
as a foundational approach that generalizes the idea of affinity-based
weighting. Unlike the fixed dot-product structure used in Transformers, Inf-FS
defines A either through domain knowledge or by learning, and computes feature
relevance through multi-hop propagation over the affinity graph. From this
perspective, self-attention can be seen as a special case of Inf-FS: it uses a
single-hop affinity computation where A is dynamically built from token
similarities. We argue that the underlying structure, reasoning over pairwise
relationships, is preserved across both approaches, and the key differences lie
in how the affinity matrix is defined and applied. By situating self-attention
within the broader paradigm of affinity-based computation, we unify several
strands of machine learning research and highlight a common mathematical
foundation that underpins diverse models and tasks.

TL;DR: CXR-TFT是一个多模态框架，结合稀疏的胸部X光片和临床数据，预测重症患者的X光片变化趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具无法捕捉胸部X光片的动态变化，限制了其在重症监护中的应用。

Method: 通过视觉编码器生成潜在嵌入，与高频临床数据对齐，并使用Transformer模型预测未来X光片变化。

Result: 在2万名ICU患者中，CXR-TFT能提前12小时高准确率预测异常X光片结果。

Conclusion: CXR-TFT提供了时间分辨率高的预测能力，有望改善重症患者的临床管理。

Abstract: In intensive care units (ICUs), patients with complex clinical conditions
require vigilant monitoring and prompt interventions. Chest X-rays (CXRs) are a
vital diagnostic tool, providing insights into clinical trajectories, but their
irregular acquisition limits their utility. Existing tools for CXR
interpretation are constrained by cross-sectional analysis, failing to capture
temporal dynamics. To address this, we introduce CXR-TFT, a novel multi-modal
framework that integrates temporally sparse CXR imaging and radiology reports
with high-frequency clinical data, such as vital signs, laboratory values, and
respiratory flow sheets, to predict the trajectory of CXR findings in
critically ill patients. CXR-TFT leverages latent embeddings from a vision
encoder that are temporally aligned with hourly clinical data through
interpolation. A transformer model is then trained to predict CXR embeddings at
each hour, conditioned on previous embeddings and clinical measurements. In a
retrospective study of 20,000 ICU patients, CXR-TFT demonstrated high accuracy
in forecasting abnormal CXR findings up to 12 hours before they became
radiographically evident. This predictive capability in clinical data holds
significant potential for enhancing the management of time-sensitive conditions
like acute respiratory distress syndrome, where early intervention is crucial
and diagnoses are often delayed. By providing distinctive temporal resolution
in prognostic CXR analysis, CXR-TFT offers actionable 'whole patient' insights
that can directly improve clinical outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据以连续流的形式到达感官，其平滑变换可视为环境的连续对称性。传统等变性网络仅适用于静态变换和前馈网络，限制了其在序列模型中的应用。

Method: 扩展等变性网络理论到时间参数化序列变换（“流”），提出了一种使RNN具有流等变性的方法。

Result: 实验表明，流等变性模型在训练速度、长度泛化和速度泛化方面显著优于非等变性模型。

Conclusion: 该研究为构建尊重时间参数化对称性的序列模型迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Data arrives at our senses as a continuous stream, smoothly transforming from
one instant to the next. These smooth transformations can be viewed as
continuous symmetries of the environment that we inhabit, defining equivalence
relations between stimuli over time. In machine learning, neural network
architectures that respect symmetries of their data are called equivariant and
have provable benefits in terms of generalization ability and sample
efficiency. To date, however, equivariance has been considered only for static
transformations and feed-forward networks, limiting its applicability to
sequence models, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and corresponding
time-parameterized sequence transformations. In this work, we extend
equivariant network theory to this regime of `flows' -- one-parameter Lie
subgroups capturing natural transformations over time, such as visual motion.
We begin by showing that standard RNNs are generally not flow equivariant:
their hidden states fail to transform in a geometrically structured manner for
moving stimuli. We then show how flow equivariance can be introduced, and
demonstrate that these models significantly outperform their non-equivariant
counterparts in terms of training speed, length generalization, and velocity
generalization, on both next step prediction and sequence classification. We
present this work as a first step towards building sequence models that respect
the time-parameterized symmetries which govern the world around us.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AL评估方法仅关注最终准确性，无法全面反映学习过程动态，PALM填补了这一空白。

Method: 提出PALM模型，通过四个参数（可达到的准确性、覆盖效率、早期性能和可扩展性）描述AL轨迹，并基于部分观察预测未来性能。

Result: 在CIFAR和ImageNet等数据集上验证，PALM能准确预测学习曲线，并揭示AL方法的学习效率、数据覆盖和可扩展性。

Conclusion: PALM为AL的系统和高效评估提供了基础，适用于研究和实际应用。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) seeks to reduce annotation costs by selecting the most
informative samples for labeling, making it particularly valuable in
resource-constrained settings. However, traditional evaluation methods, which
focus solely on final accuracy, fail to capture the full dynamics of the
learning process. To address this gap, we propose PALM (Performance Analysis of
Active Learning Models), a unified and interpretable mathematical model that
characterizes AL trajectories through four key parameters: achievable accuracy,
coverage efficiency, early-stage performance, and scalability. PALM provides a
predictive description of AL behavior from partial observations, enabling the
estimation of future performance and facilitating principled comparisons across
different strategies. We validate PALM through extensive experiments on
CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet-50/100/200, covering a wide range of AL methods and
self-supervised embeddings. Our results demonstrate that PALM generalizes
effectively across datasets, budgets, and strategies, accurately predicting
full learning curves from limited labeled data. Importantly, PALM reveals
crucial insights into learning efficiency, data space coverage, and the
scalability of AL methods. By enabling the selection of cost-effective
strategies and predicting performance under tight budget constraints, PALM lays
the basis for more systematic, reproducible, and data-efficient evaluation of
AL in both research and real-world applications. The code is available at:

Result: 扩散模型在数据稀缺时表现更好，验证损失更低，下游任务性能更优。

Conclusion: 当数据成为瓶颈时，扩散模型是自回归模型的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have long dominated the landscape of large
language models, driving progress across a wide range of tasks. Recently,
diffusion-based language models have emerged as a promising alternative, though
their advantages over AR models remain underexplored. In this paper, we
systematically study masked diffusion models in data-constrained settings-where
training involves repeated passes over limited data-and find that they
significantly outperform AR models when compute is abundant but data is scarce.
Diffusion models make better use of repeated data, achieving lower validation
loss and superior downstream performance. We interpret this advantage as
implicit data augmentation: masked diffusion exposes the model to a diverse
distribution of token orderings and prediction tasks, unlike AR's fixed
left-to-right factorization. We find new scaling laws for diffusion models and
derive a closed-form expression for the critical compute threshold at which
diffusion begins to outperform AR. These results suggest that when data, not
compute, is the bottleneck, diffusion models offer a compelling alternative to
the standard AR paradigm. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保MLLMs在临床实践中的安全部署，需分析其预测准确性和校准误差，尤其是跨不同人口亚组的情况。

Method: CALIN通过双层程序（从群体到亚组）估计校准需求，并在推理时应用校准矩阵调整置信度分数。

Result: 在三个医学影像数据集上，CALIN有效提升了预测准确性并减少了校准偏差，同时最小化了公平性与效用的权衡。

Conclusion: CALIN为MLLMs在医学图像分类中的公平性和准确性提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enormous potential to perform
few-shot in-context learning in the context of medical image analysis. However,
safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an
in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated
calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In
this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and
demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot
in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an
inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases.
Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by
calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the
population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this
estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference.
Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image
classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for
chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair
confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall
prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off. Our

Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to improve 0.55T T2-weighted PROPELLER lung MRI
through a self-supervised joint reconstruction and denoising model.
  Methods: T2-weighted 0.55T lung MRI dataset including 44 patients with
previous covid infection were used. A self-supervised learning framework was
developed, where each blade of the PROPELLER acquisition was split along the
readout direction into two partitions. One subset trains the unrolled
reconstruction network, while the other subset is used for loss calculation,
enabling self-supervised training without clean targets and leveraging matched
noise statistics for denoising. For comparison, Marchenko-Pastur Principal
Component Analysis (MPPCA) was performed along the coil dimension, followed by
conventional parallel imaging reconstruction. The quality of the reconstructed
lung MRI was assessed visually by two experienced radiologists independently.
  Results: The proposed self-supervised model improved the clarity and
structural integrity of the lung images. For cases with available CT scans, the
reconstructed images demonstrated strong alignment with corresponding CT
images. Additionally, the proposed model enables further scan time reduction by
requiring only half the number of blades. Reader evaluations confirmed that the
proposed method outperformed MPPCA-denoised images across all categories
(Wilcoxon signed-rank test, p<0.001), with moderate inter-reader agreement
(weighted Cohen's kappa=0.55; percentage of exact and within +/-1 point
agreement=91%).
  Conclusion: By leveraging intrinsic structural redundancies between two
disjoint splits of k-space subsets, the proposed self-supervised learning model
effectively reconstructs the image while suppressing the noise for 0.55T
T2-weighted lung MRI with PROPELLER sampling.

Result: 实验表明，该方法优于传统模型，对超参数不敏感，能有效提取几何信息。

Conclusion: 持久同调卷积为医学图像分析提供了有意义的拓扑信息。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a standard tool for computer vision
tasks such as image classification. However, typical model architectures may
result in the loss of topological information. In specific domains such as
histopathology, topology is an important descriptor that can be used to
distinguish between disease-indicating tissue by analyzing the shape
characteristics of cells. Current literature suggests that reintroducing
topological information using persistent homology can improve medical
diagnostics; however, previous methods utilize global topological summaries
which do not contain information about the locality of topological features. To
address this gap, we present a novel method that generates local persistent
homology-based data using a modified version of the convolution operator called
Persistent Homology Convolutions. This method captures information about the
locality and translation invariance of topological features. We perform a
comparative study using various representations of histopathology slides and
find that models trained with persistent homology convolutions outperform
conventionally trained models and are less sensitive to hyperparameters. These
results indicate that persistent homology convolutions extract meaningful
geometric information from the histopathology slides.

Result: QUTCC在去噪和MRI重建任务中成功识别幻觉，并提供更紧的不确定性区间。

Conclusion: QUTCC方法显著提升了不确定性估计的精度和可靠性，适用于医学影像任务。

Abstract: Deep learning models often hallucinate, producing realistic artifacts that
are not truly present in the sample. This can have dire consequences for
scientific and medical inverse problems, such as MRI and microscopy denoising,
where accuracy is more important than perceptual quality. Uncertainty
quantification techniques, such as conformal prediction, can pinpoint outliers
and provide guarantees for image regression tasks, improving reliability.
However, existing methods utilize a linear constant scaling factor to calibrate
uncertainty bounds, resulting in larger, less informative bounds. We propose
QUTCC, a quantile uncertainty training and calibration technique that enables
nonlinear, non-uniform scaling of quantile predictions to enable tighter
uncertainty estimates. Using a U-Net architecture with a quantile embedding,
QUTCC enables the prediction of the full conditional distribution of quantiles
for the imaging task. During calibration, QUTCC generates uncertainty bounds by
iteratively querying the network for upper and lower quantiles, progressively
refining the bounds to obtain a tighter interval that captures the desired
coverage. We evaluate our method on several denoising tasks as well as
compressive MRI reconstruction. Our method successfully pinpoints
hallucinations in image estimates and consistently achieves tighter uncertainty
intervals than prior methods while maintaining the same statistical coverage.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown great promise in medical image denoising and
reconstruction, but their application to Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
imaging remains limited by tracer-specific contrast variability and high
computational demands. In this work, we proposed an anatomical prior-guided PET
image reconstruction method based on diffusion models, inspired by the deep
diffusion image prior (DDIP) framework. The proposed method alternated between
diffusion sampling and model fine-tuning guided by the PET sinogram, enabling
the reconstruction of high-quality images from various PET tracers using a
score function pretrained on a dataset of another tracer. To improve
computational efficiency, the half-quadratic splitting (HQS) algorithm was
adopted to decouple network optimization from iterative PET reconstruction. The
proposed method was evaluated using one simulation and two clinical datasets.
For the simulation study, a model pretrained on [$^{18}$F]FDG data was tested
on amyloid-negative PET data to assess out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.
For the clinical-data validation, ten low-dose [$^{18}$F]FDG datasets and one
[$^{18}$F]Florbetapir dataset were tested on a model pretrained on data from
another tracer. Experiment results show that the proposed PET reconstruction
method can generalize robustly across tracer distributions and scanner types,
providing an efficient and versatile reconstruction framework for low-dose PET
imaging.

Abstract: Anemia is a widespread global health issue, particularly among young children
in low-resource settings. Traditional methods for anemia detection often
require expensive equipment and expert knowledge, creating barriers to early
and accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we explore the use of deep
learning models for detecting anemia through conjunctival pallor, focusing on
the CP-AnemiC dataset, which includes 710 images from children aged 6-59
months. The dataset is annotated with hemoglobin levels, gender, age and other
demographic data, enabling the development of machine learning models for
accurate anemia detection. We use the MobileNet architecture as a backbone,
known for its efficiency in mobile and embedded vision applications, and
fine-tune our model end-to-end using data augmentation techniques and a
cross-validation strategy. Our model implementation achieved an accuracy of
0.9313, a precision of 0.9374, and an F1 score of 0.9773 demonstrating strong
performance on the dataset. To optimize the model for deployment on edge
devices, we performed post-training quantization, evaluating the impact of
different bit-widths (FP32, FP16, INT8, and INT4) on model performance.
Preliminary results suggest that while FP16 quantization maintains high
accuracy (0.9250), precision (0.9370), and F1 Score (0.9377), more aggressive

TL;DR: 本研究通过系统评估解剖学先验知识，提出了一种基于器官特异性先验的多类标注策略，显著提升了深度学习模型对嗜铬细胞瘤（PCC）的3D分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的PCC分割对肿瘤负荷估计、预后和治疗计划至关重要，同时可减少对昂贵基因检测的依赖。

Method: 使用nnU-Net框架评估11种标注策略，引入基于邻近器官解剖学先验的多类标注方案，并在105例CT扫描上训练和测试。

Result: Tumor + Kidney + Aorta (TKA)标注策略在DSC、NSD和F1分数上显著优于传统策略，且在肿瘤负荷量化和遗传亚型分割中表现优异。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合相关解剖学背景可显著提升PCC分割精度，支持临床评估和长期监测。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of pheochromocytoma (PCC) in abdominal CT scans is
essential for tumor burden estimation, prognosis, and treatment planning. It
may also help infer genetic clusters, reducing reliance on expensive testing.
This study systematically evaluates anatomical priors to identify
configurations that improve deep learning-based PCC segmentation. We employed
the nnU-Net framework to evaluate eleven annotation strategies for accurate 3D
segmentation of pheochromocytoma, introducing a set of novel multi-class
schemes based on organ-specific anatomical priors. These priors were derived
from adjacent organs commonly surrounding adrenal tumors (e.g., liver, spleen,
kidney, aorta, adrenal gland, and pancreas), and were compared against a broad
body-region prior used in previous work. The framework was trained and tested
on 105 contrast-enhanced CT scans from 91 patients at the NIH Clinical Center.
Performance was measured using Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Normalized
Surface Distance (NSD), and instance-wise F1 score. Among all strategies, the
Tumor + Kidney + Aorta (TKA) annotation achieved the highest segmentation
accuracy, significantly outperforming the previously used Tumor + Body (TB)
annotation across DSC (p = 0.0097), NSD (p = 0.0110), and F1 score (25.84%
improvement at an IoU threshold of 0.5), measured on a 70-30 train-test split.
The TKA model also showed superior tumor burden quantification (R^2 = 0.968)
and strong segmentation across all genetic subtypes. In five-fold
cross-validation, TKA consistently outperformed TB across IoU thresholds (0.1
to 0.5), reinforcing its robustness and generalizability. These findings
highlight the value of incorporating relevant anatomical context in deep
learning models to achieve precise PCC segmentation, supporting clinical
assessment and longitudinal monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需对比剂的新型框架，通过2D标准电影MRI自动重建高保真3D心肌梗死几何形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LGE MRI需要对比剂且依赖稀疏采样的2D切片，限制了空间分辨率和准确性。

Method: 首先通过biv-me模型从多视角电影MRI重建4D双心室网格，再设计CMotion2Infarct-Net模型利用动态几何中的运动模式定位梗死区域。

Result: 在205例患者数据中，与手动标注结果一致。

Conclusion: 证明了无对比剂、基于心脏运动的3D梗死重建的可行性，为MI数字孪生提供了高效途径。

Abstract: Accurate representation of myocardial infarct geometry is crucial for
patient-specific cardiac modeling in MI patients. While Late gadolinium
enhancement (LGE) MRI is the clinical gold standard for infarct detection, it
requires contrast agents, introducing side effects and patient discomfort.
Moreover, infarct reconstruction from LGE often relies on sparsely sampled 2D
slices, limiting spatial resolution and accuracy. In this work, we propose a
novel framework for automatically reconstructing high-fidelity 3D myocardial
infarct geometry from 2D clinically standard cine MRI, eliminating the need for
contrast agents. Specifically, we first reconstruct the 4D biventricular mesh
from multi-view cine MRIs via an automatic deep shape fitting model, biv-me.
Then, we design a infarction reconstruction model, CMotion2Infarct-Net, to
explicitly utilize the motion patterns within this dynamic geometry to localize
infarct regions. Evaluated on 205 cine MRI scans from 126 MI patients, our
method shows reasonable agreement with manual delineation. This study
demonstrates the feasibility of contrast-free, cardiac motion-driven 3D infarct
reconstruction, paving the way for efficient digital twin of MI.

Motivation: 心脏数字孪生（CDTs）在精准医学中潜力巨大，但目前全心脏尺度的四腔室电机械模拟模型仍有限。

Method: 通过自监督学习将2D心脏电影MRI映射到4D心脏网格，生成与输入MRI高度匹配的个性化心脏模型。

Result: 生成的4D心脏网格可自动提取关键心脏参数（如射血分数和动态腔室体积变化），验证了从MRI推断个性化4D心脏模型的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为高效的心脏数字孪生平台奠定了基础，代码将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Cardiac digital twins (CDTs) provide personalized in-silico cardiac
representations and hold great potential for precision medicine in cardiology.
However, whole-heart CDT models that simulate the full organ-scale
electromechanics of all four heart chambers remain limited. In this work, we
propose a weakly supervised learning model to reconstruct 4D (3D+t) heart mesh
directly from multi-view 2D cardiac cine MRIs. This is achieved by learning a
self-supervised mapping between cine MRIs and 4D cardiac meshes, enabling the
generation of personalized heart models that closely correspond to input cine
MRIs. The resulting 4D heart meshes can facilitate the automatic extraction of
key cardiac variables, including ejection fraction and dynamic chamber volume
changes with high temporal resolution. It demonstrates the feasibility of
inferring personalized 4D heart models from cardiac MRIs, paving the way for an
efficient CDT platform for precision medicine. The code will be publicly
released once the manuscript is accepted.

TL;DR: EndoControlMag是一种无需训练的、基于拉格朗日的方法，通过掩码条件血管运动放大技术，显著提升内窥镜手术中血管细微运动的可视化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜手术中血管细微运动的可视化对手术精度和决策至关重要，但由于手术场景的复杂性和动态性，这一任务极具挑战性。

Method: EndoControlMag采用周期性参考重置（PRR）方案和分层组织感知放大（HTM）框架，结合双模式掩码扩张，自适应地放大血管运动。

Result: 在EndoVMM24数据集上的评估显示，EndoControlMag在放大精度和视觉质量上显著优于现有方法，并在复杂手术条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: EndoControlMag为内窥镜手术中的血管运动可视化提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Visualizing subtle vascular motions in endoscopic surgery is crucial for
surgical precision and decision-making, yet remains challenging due to the
complex and dynamic nature of surgical scenes. To address this, we introduce
EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with
mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic
environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference
Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with
dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while
maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification
(HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores
using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization
despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive
softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that
modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement,
or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force
attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical
scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while
distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow
conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four
different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including
occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations.
Quantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations
demonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in
both magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness
across challenging surgical conditions. The code, dataset, and video results
are available at https://szupc.github.io/EndoControlMag/.

Motivation: 高分辨率CT对胸部疾病诊断和治疗至关重要，但受限于辐射剂量和硬件成本，需要一种高效且临床可行的超分辨率方法。

Method: TVSRN-V2结合Through-Plane Attention Blocks和Swin Transformer V2，通过伪低分辨率增强技术提升模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在肺叶分割、影像组学和预后预测任务中，TVSRN-V2显著提升性能（Dice +4%，C-index和AUC +0.06）。

Conclusion: TVSRN-V2是一种临床可行的系统，通过超分辨率技术显著提升CT影像的定量分析和决策支持能力。

Abstract: High-resolution volumetric computed tomography (CT) is essential for accurate
diagnosis and treatment planning in thoracic diseases; however, it is limited
by radiation dose and hardware costs. We present the Transformer Volumetric
Super-Resolution Network (\textbf{TVSRN-V2}), a transformer-based
super-resolution (SR) framework designed for practical deployment in clinical
lung CT analysis. Built from scalable components, including Through-Plane
Attention Blocks (TAB) and Swin Transformer V2 -- our model effectively
reconstructs fine anatomical details in low-dose CT volumes and integrates
seamlessly with downstream analysis pipelines. We evaluate its effectiveness on
three critical lung cancer tasks -- lobe segmentation, radiomics, and prognosis
-- across multiple clinical cohorts. To enhance robustness across variable
acquisition protocols, we introduce pseudo-low-resolution augmentation,
simulating scanner diversity without requiring private data. TVSRN-V2
demonstrates a significant improvement in segmentation accuracy (+4\% Dice),
higher radiomic feature reproducibility, and enhanced predictive performance
(+0.06 C-index and AUC). These results indicate that SR-driven recovery of
structural detail significantly enhances clinical decision support, positioning
TVSRN-V2 as a well-engineered, clinically viable system for dose-efficient
imaging and quantitative analysis in real-world CT workflows.

Result: 在CVC-ClinicDB上达到96.0% Dice和92.9% IoU，保持实时性。

Conclusion: SynDiff通过可控合成增强提升分割鲁棒性，适用于资源有限的临床环境。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation suffers from data scarcity, particularly in polyp
detection where annotation requires specialized expertise. We present SynDiff,
a framework combining text-guided synthetic data generation with efficient
diffusion-based segmentation. Our approach employs latent diffusion models to
generate clinically realistic synthetic polyps through text-conditioned
inpainting, augmenting limited training data with semantically diverse samples.
Unlike traditional diffusion methods requiring iterative denoising, we
introduce direct latent estimation enabling single-step inference with T x
computational speedup. On CVC-ClinicDB, SynDiff achieves 96.0% Dice and 92.9%
IoU while maintaining real-time capability suitable for clinical deployment.
The framework demonstrates that controlled synthetic augmentation improves
segmentation robustness without distribution shift. SynDiff bridges the gap
between data-hungry deep learning models and clinical constraints, offering an
efficient solution for deployment in resourcelimited medical settings.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在钢材表面缺陷检测任务中具有更高的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了钢材表面缺陷检测问题，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Surface defect detection of steel, especially the recognition of multi-scale
defects, has always been a major challenge in industrial manufacturing. Steel
surfaces not only have defects of various sizes and shapes, which limit the
accuracy of traditional image processing and detection methods in complex
environments. However, traditional defect detection methods face issues of
insufficient accuracy and high miss-detection rates when dealing with small
target defects. To address this issue, this study proposes a detection
framework based on deep learning, specifically YOLOv9s, combined with the
C3Ghost module, SCConv module, and CARAFE upsampling operator, to improve
detection accuracy and model performance. First, the SCConv module is used to
reduce feature redundancy and optimize feature representation by reconstructing
the spatial and channel dimensions. Second, the C3Ghost module is introduced to
enhance the model's feature extraction ability by reducing redundant
computations and parameter volume, thereby improving model efficiency. Finally,
the CARAFE upsampling operator, which can more finely reorganize feature maps
in a content-aware manner, optimizes the upsampling process and ensures
detailed restoration of high-resolution defect regions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher accuracy and robustness in
steel surface defect detection tasks compared to other methods, effectively
addressing defect detection problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多序列MRI数据在3D病变分类中的有效整合仍具挑战性，需一种能自适应融合空间与频谱特征的方法。

Method: 提出DeSamba框架，包含解耦表示学习模块（DRLM）和频谱自适应调制块（SAMB），通过自重构和交叉重构解耦特征，并动态融合空间与频谱信息。

Result: 在两个临床数据集上表现优异，优于现有方法，如脊柱转移数据集Top-1准确率62.10%，F1-score 63.62%，AUC 87.71%。

Conclusion: DeSamba是一种通用且有效的解决方案，适用于多序列医学影像的3D病变分类。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences provide rich spatial and frequency
domain information, which is crucial for accurate lesion classification in
medical imaging. However, effectively integrating multi-sequence MRI data for
robust 3D lesion classification remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose
DeSamba (Decoupled Spectral Adaptive Network and Mamba-Based Model), a novel
framework designed to extract decoupled representations and adaptively fuse
spatial and spectral features for lesion classification. DeSamba introduces a
Decoupled Representation Learning Module (DRLM) that decouples features from
different MRI sequences through self-reconstruction and cross-reconstruction,
and a Spectral Adaptive Modulation Block (SAMB) within the proposed SAMNet,
enabling dynamic fusion of spectral and spatial information based on lesion
characteristics. We evaluate DeSamba on two clinically relevant 3D datasets. On
a six-class spinal metastasis dataset (n=1,448), DeSamba achieves 62.10% Top-1
accuracy, 63.62% F1-score, 87.71% AUC, and 93.55% Top-3 accuracy on an external
validation set (n=372), outperforming all state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. On
a spondylitis dataset (n=251) involving a challenging binary classification
task, DeSamba achieves 70.00%/64.52% accuracy and 74.75/73.88 AUC on internal
and external validation sets, respectively. Ablation studies demonstrate that
both DRLM and SAMB significantly contribute to overall performance, with over
10% relative improvement compared to the baseline. Our results highlight the
potential of DeSamba as a generalizable and effective solution for 3D lesion
classification in multi-sequence medical imaging.

Motivation: 现有模型在固定高分辨率输入下表现良好，但在实际低分辨率数据中性能显著下降，限制了临床应用。

Method: 提出RARE-UNet，包含多尺度块、分辨率感知路由机制和一致性驱动训练，以动态适应输入分辨率。

Result: 在脑成像任务中，RARE-UNet的平均Dice分数最高（0.84和0.65），且推理时间显著减少。

Conclusion: RARE-UNet在分辨率鲁棒性和效率上表现优异，适用于实际临床场景。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but existing
models often assume fixed, high-resolution inputs and degrade significantly
when faced with lower-resolution data in real-world scenarios. To address this
limitation, we propose RARE-UNet, a resolution-aware multi-scale segmentation
architecture that dynamically adapts its inference path to the spatial
resolution of the input. Central to our design are multi-scale blocks
integrated at multiple encoder depths, a resolution-aware routing mechanism,
and consistency-driven training that aligns multi-resolution features with
full-resolution representations. We evaluate RARE-UNet on two benchmark brain
imaging tasks for hippocampus and tumor segmentation. Compared to standard
UNet, its multi-resolution augmented variant, and nnUNet, our model achieves
the highest average Dice scores of 0.84 and 0.65 across resolution, while
maintaining consistent performance and significantly reduced inference time at
lower resolutions. These results highlight the effectiveness and scalability of
our architecture in achieving resolution-robust segmentation. The codes are

Motivation: 研究自回归模型和深度时序模型在非马尔可夫序列建模中的不同处理方式，强调模型架构与推理计算的分离需求。

Method: 使用基于下一词预测训练的Transformer模型，通过结构化上下文访问实现层次化时序分解。

Result: 实验表明，层次化时序分解在保持预测能力的同时减少了计算量。

Conclusion: 预测构建和优化的过程并不完全依赖于底层模型架构。

Abstract: Parr et al., 2025 examines how auto-regressive and deep temporal models
differ in their treatment of non-Markovian sequence modelling. Building on
this, we highlight the need for dissociating model architectures, i.e., how the
predictive distribution factorises, from the computations invoked at inference.
We demonstrate that deep temporal computations are mimicked by autoregressive
models by structuring context access during iterative inference. Using a
transformer trained on next-token prediction, we show that inducing
hierarchical temporal factorisation during iterative inference maintains
predictive capacity while instantiating fewer computations. This emphasises
that processes for constructing and refining predictions are not necessarily
bound to their underlying model architectures.

Result: 提出材料知识基准，明确LLMs在PSPP链中的适用步骤。

Conclusion: LLMs在部分PSPP步骤中适用，但需结合专业模型以实现全面应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in the fields of
mechanical engineering and materials science. As models that establish
connections through the interface of language, LLMs can be applied for
step-wise reasoning through the Processing-Structure-Property-Performance chain
of material science and engineering. Current LLMs are built for adequately
representing a dataset, which is the most part of the accessible internet.
However, the internet mostly contains non-scientific content. If LLMs should be
applied for engineering purposes, it is valuable to investigate models for
their intrinsic knowledge -- here: the capacity to generate correct information
about materials. In the current work, for the example of the Periodic Table of
Elements, we highlight the role of vocabulary and tokenization for the
uniqueness of material fingerprints, and the LLMs' capabilities of generating
factually correct output of different state-of-the-art open models. This leads
to a material knowledge benchmark for an informed choice, for which steps in
the PSPP chain LLMs are applicable, and where specialized models are required.

text-to-speech conversion and Tkinter-based GUI visualization, the solution
delivers multimodal error feedback through parallel auditory and visual
channels. Empirical evaluation demonstrates 37% reduced cognitive load (p<0.01,
n=50) compared to traditional stack-trace debugging, while enabling 78% faster
error identification through vocalized exception classification and
contextualization. The system achieves sub-1.2 second voice latency with under
18% CPU overhead during exception handling, vocalizing error types and
consequences while displaying interactive tracebacks with documentation deep
links. Criteria validate compatibility across Python 3.7+ environments on
Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms. Needing only two lines of integration
code, the plugin significantly boosts availability for aesthetically impaired
designers and supports multitasking workflows through hands-free error medical
diagnosis. Educational applications show particular promise, with pilot studies
indicating 45% faster debugging skill acquisition among novice programmers.
Future development will incorporate GPT-based repair suggestions and real-time
multilingual translation to further advance auditory debugging paradigms. The
solution represents a fundamental shift toward human-centric error diagnostics,
bridging critical gaps in programming accessibility while establishing new
standards for cognitive efficiency in software development workflows.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant challenges in specialized

This paper presents a streamlined two-stage framework consisting of Retrieval

approach employs a fine-tuned Bi-Encoder for rapid candidate retrieval,
followed by a Cross-Encoder for precise re-ranking, both optimized through
strategic negative example mining. Key innovations include the introduction of
the Exist@m metric to evaluate retrieval effectiveness and the use of semi-hard
negatives to mitigate training bias, which significantly improved re-ranking
performance. Evaluated on the SoICT Hackathon 2024 for Legal Document
Retrieval, our team, 4Huiter, achieved a top-three position. While
top-performing teams employed ensemble models and iterative self-training on
large bge-m3 architectures, our lightweight, single-pass approach offered a
competitive alternative with far fewer parameters. The framework demonstrates
that optimized data processing, tailored loss functions, and balanced negative

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短视频平台成为信息获取的主要渠道，但现有查询推荐方法缺乏语义深度交互，且该领域缺乏公开数据集和研究。

Result: 实验表明GREAT方法在离线和在线测试中均表现出色。

Conclusion: GREAT框架有效解决了I2Q推荐问题，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Currently, short video platforms have become the primary place for
individuals to share experiences and obtain information. To better meet users'
needs for acquiring information while browsing short videos, some apps have
introduced a search entry at the bottom of videos, accompanied with recommended
relevant queries. This scenario is known as query recommendation in
video-related search, where core task is item-to-query (I2Q) recommendation. As
this scenario has only emerged in recent years, there is a notable scarcity of
academic research and publicly available datasets in this domain. To address
this gap, we systematically examine the challenges associated with this
scenario for the first time. Subsequently, we release a large-scale dataset
derived from real-world data pertaining to the query recommendation in
video-\textit{\textbf{r}}elated \textit{\textbf{s}}earch on the
\textit{\textbf{Kuai}}shou app (\textbf{KuaiRS}). Presently, existing methods
rely on embeddings to calculate similarity for matching short videos with

In this paper, we introduce a novel LLM-based framework named \textbf{GREAT},
which \textit{\textbf{g}}uides que\textit{\textbf{r}}y
g\textit{\textbf{e}}ner\textit{\textbf{a}}tion with a \textit{\textbf{t}}rie to
address I2Q recommendation in related search. Specifically, we initially gather
high-quality queries with high exposure and click-through rate to construct a
query-based trie. During training, we enhance the LLM's capability to generate
high-quality queries using the query-based trie. In the inference phase, the
query-based trie serves as a guide for the token generation. Finally, we
further refine the relevance and literal quality between items and queries via
a post-processing module. Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed method.

TL;DR: LOVO系统通过预训练视觉编码器提取特征，构建高效索引，支持大规模视频数据中的复杂对象查询，显著降低搜索延迟和索引成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 摄像头广泛部署导致视频数据激增，现有方法难以高效处理大规模视频中的复杂对象查询，且查询延迟高。

Method: LOVO使用预训练视觉编码器提取关键帧特征，构建多索引向量数据库，支持近似最近邻搜索和跨模态重排序。

Result: LOVO在真实数据集上表现优异，查询准确率接近最优，搜索延迟降低85倍，索引成本显著减少。

Conclusion: LOVO为视频分析中的复杂对象查询设定了新标准，提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of cameras has led to an exponential increase in
video data, creating vast opportunities for applications such as traffic
management and crime surveillance. However, querying specific objects from
large-scale video datasets presents challenges, including (1) processing
massive and continuously growing data volumes, (2) supporting complex query
requirements, and (3) ensuring low-latency execution. Existing video analysis
methods struggle with either limited adaptability to unseen object classes or
suffer from high query latency. In this paper, we present LOVO, a novel system
designed to efficiently handle comp$\underline{L}$ex $\underline{O}$bject
queries in large-scale $\underline{V}$ide$\underline{O}$ datasets. Agnostic to
user queries, LOVO performs one-time feature extraction using pre-trained
visual encoders, generating compact visual embeddings for key frames to build
an efficient index. These visual embeddings, along with associated bounding
boxes, are organized in an inverted multi-index structure within a vector
database, which supports queries for any objects. During the query phase, LOVO
transforms object queries to query embeddings and conducts fast approximate
nearest-neighbor searches on the visual embeddings. Finally, a cross-modal
rerank is performed to refine the results by fusing visual features with
detailed textual features. Evaluation on real-world video datasets demonstrates
that LOVO outperforms existing methods in handling complex queries, with
near-optimal query accuracy and up to 85x lower search latency, while
significantly reducing index construction costs. This system redefines the
state-of-the-art object query approaches in video analysis, setting a new
benchmark for complex object queries with a novel, scalable, and efficient
approach that excels in dynamic environments.

Result: U-MARVEL框架在M-BEIR基准测试中显著优于现有方法，并在零样本任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: U-MARVEL展示了在多模态检索任务中的强大泛化能力，为嵌入学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Universal multimodal retrieval (UMR), which aims to address complex retrieval
tasks where both queries and candidates span diverse modalities, has been
significantly advanced by the emergence of MLLMs. While state-of-the-art
MLLM-based methods in the literature predominantly adopt contrastive learning
principles, they often differ in their specific training recipes. Despite their
success, the mechanisms underlying their retrieval capabilities remain largely
unexplored, potentially resulting in suboptimal performance and limited
generalization ability. To address these issues, we present a comprehensive
study aimed at uncovering the key factors that drive effective embedding
learning for UMR using MLLMs. We begin by implementing a general MLLM-based
embedding learning pipeline, and systematically analyze the primary
contributors to high-performing universal retrieval systems. Based on this, we
explore various aspects of the details in embedding generation and training
strategies, including progressive transition, hard negative mining and
re-ranker distillation. Notably, our findings reveal that often-overlooked
factors can have a substantial impact on model performance. Building on these
discoveries, we introduce a unified framework termed U-MARVEL
(\textbf{U}niversal \textbf{M}ultimod\textbf{A}l \textbf{R}etrie\textbf{V}al
via \textbf{E}mbedding \textbf{L}earning), which outperforms state-of-the-art
competitors on the M-BEIR benchmark by a large margin in supervised settings,
and also exihibits strong zero-shot performance on several tasks such as
composed image retrieval and text-to-video retrieval. These results underscore
the generalization potential of our framework across various embedding-based
retrieval tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/chaxjli/U-MARVEL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于探针数据结构的神经渲染方法，高效重建复杂大场景，避免显式依赖几何数据。


<details>

Method: 利用探针数据结构重建多尺度隐式场景表示，结合稀疏图像输入实现高效渲染。

Conclusion: 探针数据结构为大规模场景重建提供高效解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Reconstructing photo-realistic large-scale scenes from images, for example at
city scale, is a long-standing problem in computer graphics. Neural rendering
is an emerging technique that enables photo-realistic image synthesis from
previously unobserved viewpoints; however, state-of-the-art neural rendering
methods have difficulty efficiently rendering a high complex large-scale scene
because these methods typically trade scene size, fidelity, and rendering speed
for quality. The other stream of techniques utilizes scene geometries for
reconstruction. But the cost of building and maintaining a large set of
geometry data increases as scene size grows. Our work explores novel view
synthesis methods that efficiently reconstruct complex scenes without explicit
use of scene geometries. Specifically, given sparse images of the scene
(captured from the real world), we reconstruct intermediate, multi-scale,
implicit representations of scene geometries. In this way, our method avoids
explicitly relying on scene geometry, significantly reducing the computational
cost of maintaining large 3D data. Unlike current methods, we reconstruct the
scene using a probe data structure. Probe data hold highly accurate depth
information of dense data points, enabling the reconstruction of highly complex
scenes. By reconstructing the scene using probe data, the rendering cost is
independent of the complexity of the scene. As such, our approach combines
geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Moreover, when rendering
large-scale scenes, compressing and streaming probe data is more efficient than
using explicit scene geometry. Therefore, our neural representation approach
can potentially be applied to virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR)
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了3D场景生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D generation has made great strides in both academia and
industry. However, generating 3D scenes from a single RGB image remains a
significant challenge, as current approaches often struggle to ensure both
object generation quality and scene coherence in multi-object scenarios. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a novel three-stage framework for 3D
scene generation with explicit geometric representations and high-quality
textural details via single image-guided model generation and spatial layout
optimization. Our method begins with an image instance segmentation and
inpainting phase, which recovers missing details of occluded objects in the
input images, thereby achieving complete generation of foreground 3D assets.
Subsequently, our approach captures the spatial geometry of reference image by
constructing pseudo-stereo viewpoint for camera parameter estimation and scene
depth inference, while employing a model selection strategy to ensure optimal
alignment between the 3D assets generated in the previous step and the input.
Finally, through model parameterization and minimization of the Chamfer
distance between point clouds in 3D and 2D space, our approach optimizes layout
parameters to produce an explicit 3D scene representation that maintains
precise alignment with input guidance image. Extensive experiments on
multi-object scene image sets have demonstrated that our approach not only
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of geometric accuracy and texture
fidelity of individual generated 3D models, but also has significant advantages
in scene layout synthesis.

Abstract: Natural language offers a highly intuitive interface for enabling localized
fine-grained edits of 3D shapes. However, prior works face challenges in
preserving global coherence while locally modifying the input 3D shape. In this
work, we introduce an inpainting-based framework for editing shapes represented
as point clouds. Our approach leverages foundation 3D diffusion models for
achieving localized shape edits, adding structural guidance in the form of a
partial conditional shape, ensuring that other regions correctly preserve the
shape's identity. Furthermore, to encourage identity preservation also within
the local edited region, we propose an inference-time coordinate blending
algorithm which balances reconstruction of the full shape with inpainting at a
progression of noise levels during the inference process. Our coordinate
blending algorithm seamlessly blends the original shape with its edited
version, enabling a fine-grained editing of 3D shapes, all while circumventing
the need for computationally expensive and often inaccurate inversion.
Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms alternative techniques
across a wide range of metrics that evaluate both fidelity to the original
shape and also adherence to the textual description.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting is renowned for its high-fidelity reconstructions and
real-time novel view synthesis, yet its lack of semantic understanding limits
object-level perception. In this work, we propose ObjectGS, an object-aware
framework that unifies 3D scene reconstruction with semantic understanding.
Instead of treating the scene as a unified whole, ObjectGS models individual
objects as local anchors that generate neural Gaussians and share object IDs,
enabling precise object-level reconstruction. During training, we dynamically
grow or prune these anchors and optimize their features, while a one-hot ID
encoding with a classification loss enforces clear semantic constraints. We
show through extensive experiments that ObjectGS not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on open-vocabulary and panoptic segmentation tasks,
but also integrates seamlessly with applications like mesh extraction and scene
editing. Project page: https://ruijiezhu94.github.io/ObjectGS_page

Conclusion: 离散化SDF结合投影一致性损失，有效提升3DGS在逆渲染中的表现，兼具高效与高质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has shown its detailed expressive ability and
highly efficient rendering speed in the novel view synthesis (NVS) task. The
application to inverse rendering still faces several challenges, as the
discrete nature of Gaussian primitives makes it difficult to apply geometry
constraints. Recent works introduce the signed distance field (SDF) as an extra
continuous representation to regularize the geometry defined by Gaussian
primitives. It improves the decomposition quality, at the cost of increasing
memory usage and complicating training. Unlike these works, we introduce a
discretized SDF to represent the continuous SDF in a discrete manner by
encoding it within each Gaussian using a sampled value. This approach allows us
to link the SDF with the Gaussian opacity through an SDF-to-opacity
transformation, enabling rendering the SDF via splatting and avoiding the
computational cost of ray marching.The key challenge is to regularize the
discrete samples to be consistent with the underlying SDF, as the discrete
representation can hardly apply the gradient-based constraints (\eg Eikonal
loss). For this, we project Gaussians onto the zero-level set of SDF and
enforce alignment with the surface from splatting, namely a projection-based
consistency loss. Thanks to the discretized SDF, our method achieves higher
relighting quality, while requiring no extra memory beyond GS and avoiding
complex manually designed optimization. The experiments reveal that our method
outperforms existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods. Our code is
available at https://github.com/NK-CS-ZZL/DiscretizedSDF.

\tanh(\beta_i x_i)) \cdot \gamma_i x_i) + \delta$, where all parameters
$\alpha_i$, $\beta_i$, $\gamma_i$, and $\delta$ are trainable. We validate our
APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to 96.69\%
test accuracy in just 20 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters.
The results highlight the superior expressiveness and computational efficiency
of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new
paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

Abstract: The design of medical systems for remote, resource-limited environments faces
persistent challenges due to poor interoperability, lack of offline support,
and dependency on costly infrastructure. Many existing digital health solutions
neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health
workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled
Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure
patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on
small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage
with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we
integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor
analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\% anemia prevalence) with
KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL
and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\% sensitivity. To
optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8,
reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5
at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data
privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health
adoption in disconnected settings. Our work demonstrates a scalable approach to
enhance portable health information systems and support frontline healthcare in
underserved regions.

Abstract: The automated summarisation of parliamentary debates using large language
models (LLMs) offers a promising way to make complex legislative discourse more
accessible to the public. However, such summaries must not only be accurate and
concise but also equitably represent the views and contributions of all
speakers. This paper explores the use of LLMs to summarise plenary debates from
the European Parliament and investigates the algorithmic and representational
biases that emerge in this context. We propose a structured, multi-stage
summarisation framework that improves textual coherence and content fidelity,
while enabling the systematic analysis of how speaker attributes -- such as
speaking order or political affiliation -- influence the visibility and
accuracy of their contributions in the final summaries. Through our experiments
using both proprietary and open-weight LLMs, we find evidence of consistent
positional and partisan biases, with certain speakers systematically
under-represented or misattributed. Our analysis shows that these biases vary
by model and summarisation strategy, with hierarchical approaches offering the
greatest potential to reduce disparity. These findings underscore the need for
domain-sensitive evaluation metrics and ethical oversight in the deployment of
LLMs for democratic applications.
