### [1] [Specification Self-Correction: Mitigating In-Context Reward Hacking Through Test-Time Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18742)
*Víctor Gallego*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Specification Self-Correction (SSC)的框架，用于解决语言模型在上下文奖励中的漏洞问题，通过自我修正规范来提升模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型容易利用有缺陷的规范或评分标准（即奖励漏洞）来获得高分，而忽略用户真实意图。

Method: SSC采用多步推理过程：模型首先生成响应，然后自我批评输出，并修正规范以消除漏洞，最后生成更鲁棒的响应。

Result: 实验表明，SSC将模型利用漏洞的比例从50-70%降低至90%以上。

Conclusion: SSC无需修改模型权重，在推理时动态修复规范，显著提升了模型行为的鲁棒性和对齐性。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) are susceptible to in-context reward hacking, where
they exploit flaws in tainted or faulty written specifications or rubrics to
achieve high scores without fulfilling the user's true intent. We introduce
Specification Self-Correction (SSC), a novel, test-time framework that enables
an LM to identify and correct flaws within its own guiding specification. SSC
employs a multi-step inference process where the model first generates a
response based on a potentially tainted specification, critiques its output,
and then revises the specification itself to remove the exploitable loophole. A
final, more robust response is then generated using this self-corrected
specification. Across experiments spanning creative writing and agentic coding
tasks with several LMs, we demonstrate that while models initially game tainted
specifications in 50-70\% of cases, the SSC process reduces this vulnerability
by over 90\%. This dynamic repair occurs at inference time, requires no weight
modification, and leads to more robustly aligned model behavior. Code at

### [2] [The Role of Orthographic Consistency in Multilingual Embedding Models for Text Classification in Arabic-Script Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18762)
*Abdulhady Abas Abdullah,Amir H. Gandomi,Tarik A Rashid,Seyedali Mirjalili,Laith Abualigah,Milena Živković,Hadi Veisi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了针对阿拉伯语系语言的专用预训练模型AS-RoBERTa，通过语言特定的脚本特征训练，显著提升了分类任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言模型如mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa在处理共享脚本但语言差异大的语种时表现不佳，尤其是阿拉伯语系语言（如库尔德索拉尼语、阿拉伯语、波斯语和乌尔都语）。

Method: 提出了AS-RoBERTa系列模型，基于RoBERTa架构，针对每种语言的大规模语料进行预训练，专注于语言特定的脚本特征和统计信息。

Result: 在分类任务中，AS-RoBERTa比mBERT和XLM-RoBERTa性能提升2到5个百分点。消融实验证实脚本专注的预训练是关键。

Conclusion: 研究表明，针对特定脚本的预训练对阿拉伯语系语言具有重要价值，支持进一步基于脚本和语言特性的预训练策略研究。

Abstract: In natural language processing, multilingual models like mBERT and
XLM-RoBERTa promise broad coverage but often struggle with languages that share
a script yet differ in orthographic norms and cultural context. This issue is
especially notable in Arabic-script languages such as Kurdish Sorani, Arabic,
Persian, and Urdu. We introduce the Arabic Script RoBERTa (AS-RoBERTa) family:
four RoBERTa-based models, each pre-trained on a large corpus tailored to its
specific language. By focusing pre-training on language-specific script
features and statistics, our models capture patterns overlooked by
general-purpose models. When fine-tuned on classification tasks, AS-RoBERTa
variants outperform mBERT and XLM-RoBERTa by 2 to 5 percentage points. An
ablation study confirms that script-focused pre-training is central to these
gains. Error analysis using confusion matrices shows how shared script traits
and domain-specific content affect performance. Our results highlight the value
of script-aware specialization for languages using the Arabic script and
support further work on pre-training strategies rooted in script and language
specificity.

### [3] [ylmmcl at Multilingual Text Detoxification 2025: Lexicon-Guided Detoxification and Classifier-Gated Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18769)
*Nicole Lai-Lopez,Lusha Wang,Su Yuan,Liza Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种多语言文本去毒方法，结合词典标注、微调序列模型和分类器门控机制，在PAN-2025竞赛中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言文本去毒任务，提升去毒精度和跨语言泛化能力。

Method: 使用多语言有毒词典标注，结合微调的序列到序列模型和迭代分类器门控机制。

Result: 模型在STA和J分数上表现优异，xCOMET分数高，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在多语言环境中表现强劲，尽管在SIM上有所牺牲，但去毒效果显著提升。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce our solution for the Multilingual Text
Detoxification Task in the PAN-2025 competition for the ylmmcl team: a robust
multilingual text detoxification pipeline that integrates lexicon-guided
tagging, a fine-tuned sequence-to-sequence model (s-nlp/mt0-xl-detox-orpo) and
an iterative classifier-based gatekeeping mechanism. Our approach departs from
prior unsupervised or monolingual pipelines by leveraging explicit toxic word
annotation via the multilingual_toxic_lexicon to guide detoxification with
greater precision and cross-lingual generalization. Our final model achieves
the highest STA (0.922) from our previous attempts, and an average official J
score of 0.612 for toxic inputs in both the development and test sets. It also
achieved xCOMET scores of 0.793 (dev) and 0.787 (test). This performance
outperforms baseline and backtranslation methods across multiple languages, and
shows strong generalization in high-resource settings (English, Russian,
French). Despite some trade-offs in SIM, the model demonstrates consistent
improvements in detoxification strength. In the competition, our team achieved
ninth place with a score of 0.612.

### [4] [Evaluating Code-Mixing in LLMs Across 18 Languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18791)
*Yilun Yang,Yekun Chai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了代码混合（语言切换）对自然语言处理的挑战，指出现有基准的局限性，并提出了一种新的合成代码混合文本的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码混合对多语言用户至关重要，但现有研究和数据生成方法不足，需要更全面的评估和改进。

Method: 对18种语言的代码混合数据进行评估，并提出结合单词替换和GPT-4提示的合成文本生成方法。

Result: LLMs在多语言家族的代码混合数据上表现不佳，需改进训练数据、模型规模和少样本学习。

Conclusion: 代码混合研究需进一步扩展，改进数据生成和模型训练以提升LLMs表现。

Abstract: Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a
conversation, presents unique challenges for traditional natural language
processing. Existing benchmarks, such as LinCE and GLUECoS, are limited by
narrow language pairings and tasks, failing to adequately evaluate the
code-mixing capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the
significance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this
context remains limited. Additionally, current methods for generating
code-mixed data are underdeveloped. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of LLMs' performance on code-mixed data across 18 languages from
seven language families. We also propose a novel approach for generating
synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting.
Our analysis reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets
involving multiple language families. We suggest that improvements in training
data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could enhance their performance.

### [5] [CueBuddy: helping non-native English speakers navigate English-centric STEM education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18827)
*Pranav Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CueBuddy通过实时技术关键词识别和多语言词汇表查找，帮助非英语母语学生理解复杂英语术语，提升课堂学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球南方STEM学生因英语术语障碍落后于英语流利同学，尽管科学基础相当。现有语音翻译模型成本高且不擅长技术内容。

Method: 开发CueBuddy，实时识别技术关键词并提供多语言词汇表查询，避免干扰课堂专注。

Result: CueBuddy有效帮助学生理解复杂术语，提升学习效率。

Conclusion: CueBuddy是解决语言障碍的有前景工具，未来需进一步优化扩展。

Abstract: Students across the world in STEM classes, especially in the Global South,
fall behind their peers who are more fluent in English, despite being at par
with them in terms of scientific prerequisites. While many of them are able to
follow everyday English at ease, key terms in English stay challenging. In most
cases, such students have had most of their course prerequisites in a lower
resource language. Live speech translation to lower resource languages is a
promising area of research, however, models for speech translation can be too
expensive on a large scale and often struggle with technical content. In this
paper, we describe CueBuddy, which aims to remediate these issues by providing
real-time "lexical cues" through technical keyword spotting along real-time
multilingual glossary lookup to help students stay up to speed with complex
English jargon without disrupting their concentration on the lecture. We also
describe the limitations and future extensions of our approach.

### [6] [PrismRAG: Boosting RAG Factuality with Distractor Resilience and Strategized Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18857)
*Mohammad Kachuee,Teja Gollapudi,Minseok Kim,Yin Huang,Kai Sun,Xiao Yang,Jiaqi Wang,Nirav Shah,Yue Liu,Aaron Colak,Anuj Kumar,Wen-tau Yih,Xin Luna Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PrismRAG通过训练模型处理干扰性QA对并培养推理习惯，显著提升RAG的事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG在检索半相关段落或需要深度推理时表现不佳的问题。

Method: 提出PrismRAG框架，训练模型处理干扰性QA对并培养推理习惯。

Result: 在12个开放书RAG QA基准测试中，平均事实性提升5.4%。

Conclusion: PrismRAG优于现有解决方案，显著提升RAG性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often falls short when retrieved context
includes confusing semi-relevant passages, or when answering questions require
deep contextual understanding and reasoning. We propose an efficient
fine-tuning framework, called PrismRAG, that (i) trains the model with
distractor-aware QA pairs mixing gold evidence with subtle distractor passages,
and (ii) instills reasoning-centric habits that make the LLM plan, rationalize,
and synthesize without relying on extensive human engineered instructions.
Evaluated across 12 open-book RAG QA benchmarks spanning diverse application
domains and scenarios, PrismRAG improves average factuality by 5.4%,
outperforming state-of-the-art solutions.

### [7] [MindFlow+: A Self-Evolving Agent for E-Commerce Customer Service](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18884)
*Ming Gong,Xucheng Huang,Ziheng Xu,Vijayan K. Asari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MindFlow+是一种自进化的对话代理，结合大型语言模型、模仿学习和离线强化学习，通过工具增强演示和奖励条件数据建模提升电商对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统意图系统难以处理动态多轮对话，需要更灵活、上下文感知的解决方案。

Method: 结合LLM、模仿学习和离线RL，引入工具增强演示和奖励条件数据建模。

Result: 在真实电商对话中，MindFlow+在上下文相关性、灵活性和任务准确性上优于基线。

Conclusion: LLM、工具推理和奖励引导学习的结合可构建领域专业化、上下文感知的对话系统。

Abstract: High-quality dialogue is crucial for e-commerce customer service, yet
traditional intent-based systems struggle with dynamic, multi-turn
interactions. We present MindFlow+, a self-evolving dialogue agent that learns
domain-specific behavior by combining large language models (LLMs) with
imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL). MindFlow+
introduces two data-centric mechanisms to guide learning: tool-augmented
demonstration construction, which exposes the model to knowledge-enhanced and
agentic (ReAct-style) interactions for effective tool use; and
reward-conditioned data modeling, which aligns responses with task-specific
goals using reward signals. To evaluate the model's role in response
generation, we introduce the AI Contribution Ratio, a novel metric quantifying
AI involvement in dialogue. Experiments on real-world e-commerce conversations
show that MindFlow+ outperforms strong baselines in contextual relevance,
flexibility, and task accuracy. These results demonstrate the potential of
combining LLMs tool reasoning, and reward-guided learning to build
domain-specialized, context-aware dialogue systems.

### [8] [NUTMEG: Separating Signal From Noise in Annotator Disagreement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18890)
*Jonathan Ivey,Susan Gauch,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NUTMEG是一种新的贝叶斯模型，通过分析标注者背景信息，从人工标注数据中去除噪声，同时保留系统性分歧。实验表明，NUTMEG在系统性分歧任务中优于传统聚合方法，并显著提升下游模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标注数据聚合方法假设分歧是错误，但实际标注者可能存在真实分歧。NUTMEG旨在区分噪声和系统性分歧，提升数据质量。

Method: 提出NUTMEG模型，利用贝叶斯方法结合标注者背景信息，分离噪声和系统性分歧。通过合成数据验证模型效果。

Result: NUTMEG在系统性分歧任务中优于传统方法，下游模型性能显著提升。分析显示模型对子群大小、分歧率和垃圾标注率具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: NUTMEG强调在人工标注数据训练中需同时考虑标注者能力和系统性分歧，为数据聚合提供了新思路。

Abstract: NLP models often rely on human-labeled data for training and evaluation. Many
approaches crowdsource this data from a large number of annotators with varying
skills, backgrounds, and motivations, resulting in conflicting annotations.
These conflicts have traditionally been resolved by aggregation methods that
assume disagreements are errors. Recent work has argued that for many tasks
annotators may have genuine disagreements and that variation should be treated
as signal rather than noise. However, few models separate signal and noise in
annotator disagreement. In this work, we introduce NUTMEG, a new Bayesian model
that incorporates information about annotator backgrounds to remove noisy
annotations from human-labeled training data while preserving systematic
disagreements. Using synthetic data, we show that NUTMEG is more effective at
recovering ground-truth from annotations with systematic disagreement than
traditional aggregation methods. We provide further analysis characterizing how
differences in subpopulation sizes, rates of disagreement, and rates of spam
affect the performance of our model. Finally, we demonstrate that downstream
models trained on NUTMEG-aggregated data significantly outperform models
trained on data from traditionally aggregation methods. Our results highlight
the importance of accounting for both annotator competence and systematic
disagreements when training on human-labeled data.

### [9] [REPRO-Bench: Can Agentic AI Systems Assess the Reproducibility of Social Science Research?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18901)
*Chuxuan Hu,Liyun Zhang,Yeji Lim,Aum Wadhwani,Austin Peters,Daniel Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: REPRO-Bench是一个用于评估AI代理自动化社会科学论文可重复性评估能力的基准，包含112个任务实例，复杂性接近真实场景。现有AI代理表现不佳，最佳准确率仅21.4%，而REPRO-Agent将准确率提升了71%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准在评估论文可重复性时存在局限性（如仅关注代码和数据的重现性、场景过于简化、数据格式和编程语言多样性不足），因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 引入REPRO-Bench基准，包含112个社会科学论文任务实例，要求AI代理基于原始论文PDF和重现包评估可重复性。评估了三种代表性AI代理，并开发了REPRO-Agent改进性能。

Result: 最佳现有AI代理准确率为21.4%，REPRO-Agent将准确率提升了71%。

Conclusion: 需要开发更先进的AI代理以自动化真实世界的可重复性评估。REPRO-Bench已公开提供。

Abstract: Assessing the reproducibility of social science papers is essential for
promoting rigor in research processes, but manual assessment is costly. With
recent advances in agentic AI systems (i.e., AI agents), we seek to evaluate
their capability to automate this process. However, existing benchmarks for
reproducing research papers (1) focus solely on reproducing results using
provided code and data without assessing their consistency with the paper, (2)
oversimplify real-world scenarios, and (3) lack necessary diversity in data
formats and programming languages. To address these issues, we introduce
REPRO-Bench, a collection of 112 task instances, each representing a social
science paper with a publicly available reproduction report. The agents are
tasked with assessing the reproducibility of the paper based on the original
paper PDF and the corresponding reproduction package. REPRO-Bench features
end-to-end evaluation tasks on the reproducibility of social science papers
with complexity comparable to real-world assessments. We evaluate three
representative AI agents on REPRO-Bench, with the best-performing agent
achieving an accuracy of only 21.4%. Building on our empirical analysis, we
develop REPRO-Agent, which improves the highest accuracy achieved by existing
agents by 71%. We conclude that more advanced AI agents should be developed to
automate real-world reproducibility assessment. REPRO-Bench is publicly
available at https://github.com/uiuc-kang-lab/REPRO-Bench.

### [10] [SLoW: Select Low-frequency Words! Automatic Dictionary Selection for Translation on Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18902)
*Hongyuan Lu,Zixuan Li,Zefan Zhang,Wai Lam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出自动字典选择（ADS）任务，旨在优化翻译性能与token消耗的平衡，并提出SLoW方法选择低频词典，无需训练数据即可实现高效翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型（LLMs）仅支持数百种语言，而全球有7000多种语言。字典提示方法虽能增强翻译，但全量使用字典成本高，需在性能与消耗间权衡。

Method: 提出SLoW方法，通过选择低频词典优化翻译，无需训练数据即可估计词频，且无需对LLMs额外调优。

Result: 在FLORES的100种语言上实验表明，SLoW超越基线方法，显著节省token，部分语言性能甚至优于全字典基线。

Conclusion: SLoW方法高效且灵活，为多语言翻译提供了一种低成本、高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: There are more than 7,000 languages around the world, and current Large
Language Models (LLMs) only support hundreds of languages. Dictionary-based
prompting methods can enhance translation on them, but most methods use all the
available dictionaries, which could be expensive. Instead, it will be flexible
to have a trade-off between token consumption and translation performance. This
paper proposes a novel task called \textbf{A}utomatic \textbf{D}ictionary
\textbf{S}election (\textbf{ADS}). The goal of the task is to automatically
select which dictionary to use to enhance translation. We propose a novel and
effective method which we call \textbf{S}elect \textbf{Lo}w-frequency
\textbf{W}ords! (\textbf{SLoW}) which selects those dictionaries that have a
lower frequency. Our methods have unique advantages. First, there is no need
for access to the training data for frequency estimation (which is usually
unavailable). Second, it inherits the advantage of dictionary-based methods,
where no additional tuning is required on LLMs. Experimental results on 100
languages from FLORES indicate that SLoW surpasses strong baselines, and it can
obviously save token usage, with many languages even surpassing the translation
performance of the full dictionary baseline.\footnote{A shocking fact is that
there is no need to use the actual training data (often unobtainable) for
frequency estimation, and an estimation frequency obtained using public
resources is still apparently effective in improving translation with ChatGPT
and Llama, and DeepSeek.}\footnote{Code and data available upon publication.}

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了四种公开可用的LLM聊天机器人在医疗建议中的安全性，发现其回答存在显著差异，部分可能导致严重患者伤害。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者频繁使用LLM聊天机器人获取医疗建议，引发安全隐患，需评估其安全性。

Method: 通过新数据集HealthAdvice，对四种聊天机器人的888条回答进行定量和定性分析。

Result: 问题回答率从21.6%（Claude）到43.2%（Llama），不安全回答率从5%（Claude）到13%（GPT-4o, Llama）。

Conclusion: 公开聊天机器人可能提供不安全的医疗建议，需进一步改进临床安全性。

Abstract: Millions of patients are already using large language model (LLM) chatbots
for medical advice on a regular basis, raising patient safety concerns. This
physician-led red-teaming study compares the safety of four publicly available
chatbots--Claude by Anthropic, Gemini by Google, GPT-4o by OpenAI, and
Llama3-70B by Meta--on a new dataset, HealthAdvice, using an evaluation
framework that enables quantitative and qualitative analysis. In total, 888
chatbot responses are evaluated for 222 patient-posed advice-seeking medical
questions on primary care topics spanning internal medicine, women's health,
and pediatrics. We find statistically significant differences between chatbots.
The rate of problematic responses varies from 21.6 percent (Claude) to 43.2
percent (Llama), with unsafe responses varying from 5 percent (Claude) to 13
percent (GPT-4o, Llama). Qualitative results reveal chatbot responses with the
potential to lead to serious patient harm. This study suggests that millions of
patients could be receiving unsafe medical advice from publicly available
chatbots, and further work is needed to improve the clinical safety of these
powerful tools.

Method: 详细研究了检索机制、序列到序列生成模型和融合策略，并进行了逐年分析。

Result: RAG在检索准确性、生成流畅性等方面表现优异，但仍面临检索质量、隐私等挑战。

Conclusion: 未来方向包括混合检索、隐私保护技术和优化融合策略，以实现更高效可靠的NLP系统。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a major advancement in
natural language processing (NLP), combining large language models (LLMs) with
information retrieval systems to enhance factual grounding, accuracy, and
contextual relevance. This paper presents a comprehensive systematic review of
RAG, tracing its evolution from early developments in open domain question
answering to recent state-of-the-art implementations across diverse
applications. The review begins by outlining the motivations behind RAG,
particularly its ability to mitigate hallucinations and outdated knowledge in
parametric models. Core technical components-retrieval mechanisms,
sequence-to-sequence generation models, and fusion strategies are examined in
detail. A year-by-year analysis highlights key milestones and research trends,
providing insight into RAG's rapid growth. The paper further explores the
deployment of RAG in enterprise systems, addressing practical challenges
related to retrieval of proprietary data, security, and scalability. A
comparative evaluation of RAG implementations is conducted, benchmarking
performance on retrieval accuracy, generation fluency, latency, and
computational efficiency. Persistent challenges such as retrieval quality,
privacy concerns, and integration overhead are critically assessed. Finally,
the review highlights emerging solutions, including hybrid retrieval
approaches, privacy-preserving techniques, optimized fusion strategies, and
agentic RAG architectures. These innovations point toward a future of more
reliable, efficient, and context-aware knowledge-intensive NLP systems.

*Ananya Sahu,Amith Ananthram,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种从无标签数据集中挖掘视觉元素关联的方法，生成高质量创意标题，并构建新数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖简短字面描述的网页数据，缺乏对创意输出的共享关联语言。

Method: 从图像中挖掘上下文关联，生成多抽象层次的创意标题，构建新数据集。

Result: 生成170万创意标题，人类评估显示标题视觉基础扎实且抽象层次分明；微调视觉编码器提升零样本检索性能。

Conclusion: 方法有效提升创意领域（如诗歌和隐喻可视化）的视觉语言模型性能，数据集和模型已开源。

Abstract: Understanding another person's creative output requires a shared language of
association. However, when training vision-language models such as CLIP, we
rely on web-scraped datasets containing short, predominantly literal, alt-text.
In this work, we introduce a method for mining contextualized associations for
salient visual elements in an image that can scale to any unlabeled dataset.
Given an image, we can use these mined associations to generate high quality
creative captions at increasing degrees of abstraction. With our method, we
produce a new dataset of visual associations and 1.7m creative captions for the
images in MSCOCO. Human evaluation confirms that these captions remain visually
grounded while exhibiting recognizably increasing abstraction. Moreover,
fine-tuning a visual encoder on this dataset yields meaningful improvements in
zero-shot image-text retrieval in two creative domains: poetry and metaphor
visualization. We release our dataset, our generation code and our models for
use by the broader community.

*Richmond Sin Jing Xuan,Jalil Huseynov,Yang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 多语言大模型在低资源语言上表现不佳，通过分析激活模式和LoRA微调，提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言大模型在低资源语言上的表现差异，并探索改进方法。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器分析激活模式，并通过LoRA进行激活感知微调。

Result: 微调后低资源语言激活显著提升（如马拉雅拉姆语87.69%），基准测试结果一致改善。

Conclusion: 激活对齐是提升多语言大模型性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong cross-linguistic
generalization, yet medium to low resource languages underperform on common
benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, MMLU, and HellaSwag. We analyze activation
patterns in Gemma-2-2B across all 26 residual layers and 10 languages: Chinese
(zh), Russian (ru), Spanish (es), Italian (it), medium to low resource
languages including Indonesian (id), Catalan (ca), Marathi (mr), Malayalam
(ml), and Hindi (hi), with English (en) as the reference. Using Sparse
Autoencoders (SAEs), we reveal systematic disparities in activation patterns.
Medium to low resource languages receive up to 26.27 percent lower activations
in early layers, with a persistent gap of 19.89 percent in deeper layers. To
address this, we apply activation-aware fine-tuning via Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), leading to substantial activation gains, such as 87.69 percent for
Malayalam and 86.32 percent for Hindi, while maintaining English retention at
approximately 91 percent. After fine-tuning, benchmark results show modest but
consistent improvements, highlighting activation alignment as a key factor in
enhancing multilingual LLM performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLaVA-NeuMT是一种新型多模态多语言翻译框架，通过显式建模语言特定和语言无关表示来减少多语言干扰，并在仅微调40%参数的情况下超越全微调方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMT方法在双语环境下表现良好，但在多语言翻译中存在跨语言干扰和参数共享策略无效的问题。

Method: 采用层选择机制识别不同语言对的最信息层，并通过神经元级适应策略动态选择语言特定和无关神经元。

Result: 在M3-Multi30K和M3-AmbigCaps数据集上，LLaVA-NeuMT超越全微调方法并达到SOTA结果。

Conclusion: LLaVA-NeuMT为多模态多语言翻译提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案，并揭示了所选层和神经元的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Machine Translation (MMT) enhances translation quality by
incorporating visual context, helping to resolve textual ambiguities. While
existing MMT methods perform well in bilingual settings, extending them to
multilingual translation remains challenging due to cross-lingual interference
and ineffective parameter-sharing strategies. To address this, we propose
LLaVA-NeuMT, a novel multimodal multilingual translation framework that
explicitly models language-specific and language-agnostic representations to
mitigate multilingual interference. Our approach consists of a layer selection
mechanism that identifies the most informative layers for different language
pairs and a neuron-level adaptation strategy that dynamically selects
language-specific and agnostic neurons to improve translation quality while
reducing redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on the M3-Multi30K and
M3-AmbigCaps datasets, demonstrating that LLaVA-NeuMT, while fine-tuning only
40\% of the model parameters, surpasses full fine-tuning approaches and
ultimately achieves SOTA results on both datasets. Our analysis further
provides insights into the importance of selected layers and neurons in
multimodal multilingual adaptation, offering an efficient and scalable solution
to cross-lingual adaptation in multimodal translation.

Abstract: Legal document summarization represents a significant advancement towards
improving judicial efficiency through the automation of key information
detection. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques to meticulously identify and extract essential data from extensive
legal texts, which facilitates a more efficient review process. By employing

professionals, concurrently reducing the likelihood of overlooking vital
information that could lead to errors. Through comprehensive experiments
conducted with actual legal datasets, we demonstrate the capability of our
method to generate high-quality summaries while preserving the integrity of the
original content and enhancing processing times considerably. The results
reveal marked improvements in operational efficiency, allowing legal
practitioners to direct their efforts toward critical analytical and
decision-making activities instead of manual reviews. This research highlights

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于比较对话动态相似性的度量方法，并验证其鲁棒性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法全面比较对话的整体交互动态，限制了对话数据分析和对话代理评估的效果。

Method: 设计了一种对话动态相似性度量方法，并开发了验证框架测试其鲁棒性和对话题的敏感性。

Result: 该方法成功应用于大型在线社区对话分析，揭示了情境权力在对话中的作用。

Conclusion: 提出的相似性度量方法为对话动态分析提供了新工具，有助于更全面地评估对话质量。

Abstract: The quality of a conversation goes beyond the individual quality of each
reply, and instead emerges from how these combine into interactional patterns
that give the conversation its distinctive overall "shape". However, there is
no robust automated method for comparing conversations in terms of their
overall interactional dynamics. Such methods could enhance the analysis of
conversational data and help evaluate conversational agents more holistically.
  In this work, we introduce a similarity measure for comparing conversations
with respect to their dynamics. We design a validation framework for testing
the robustness of the metric in capturing differences in conversation dynamics
and for assessing its sensitivity to the topic of the conversations. Finally,
to illustrate the measure's utility, we use it to analyze conversational
dynamics in a large online community, bringing new insights into the role of
situational power in conversations.

*Bohan Yao,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Multi-TAG框架通过多工具聚合提升LLM在复杂数学推理中的表现，无需微调即可显著提高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强方法在复杂多步数学推理中表现不佳，需改进以提升性能。

Method: 提出Multi-TAG框架，指导LLM同时调用多个工具并聚合输出以验证和优化推理过程。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，Multi-TAG平均提升6.0%至7.5%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Multi-TAG是一种无需微调的高效框架，适用于各类LLM，显著提升复杂数学推理能力。

Abstract: Augmenting large language models (LLMs) with external tools is a promising
avenue for developing high-performance mathematical reasoning systems. Prior
tool-augmented approaches typically finetune an LLM to select and invoke a
single tool at each reasoning step and show promising results on simpler math
reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K. However, these approaches struggle with
more complex math problems that require precise reasoning over multiple steps.
To address this limitation, in this work, we propose Multi-TAG, a Multi-Tool
AGgregation-based framework. Instead of relying on a single tool, Multi-TAG
guides an LLM to concurrently invoke multiple tools at each reasoning step. It
then aggregates their diverse outputs to verify and refine the reasoning
process, enhancing solution robustness and accuracy. Notably, Multi-TAG is a
finetuning-free, inference-only framework, making it readily applicable to any
LLM backbone, including large open-weight models which are computationally
expensive to finetune and proprietary frontier models which cannot be finetuned
with custom recipes. We evaluate Multi-TAG on four challenging benchmarks:
MATH500, AIME, AMC, and OlympiadBench. Across both open-weight and
closed-source LLM backbones, Multi-TAG consistently and substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving average improvements of 6.0%
to 7.5% over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有论点摘要方法多为单次生成，缺乏事实修正和结构优化的支持。

Method: 结合灵活的掩码控制器和充分性检查模块，迭代改进摘要。

Result: 在10项自动评估指标中7项超越现有方法，人工评估显示在覆盖性、忠实性和简洁性上有显著提升。

Conclusion: Arg-LLaDA的迭代生成策略有效提升了论点摘要的质量。

Abstract: Argument summarization aims to generate concise, structured representations
of complex, multi-perspective debates. While recent work has advanced the
identification and clustering of argumentative components, the generation stage
remains underexplored. Existing approaches typically rely on single-pass
generation, offering limited support for factual correction or structural
refinement. To address this gap, we introduce Arg-LLaDA, a novel large language
diffusion framework that iteratively improves summaries via sufficiency-guided
remasking and regeneration. Our method combines a flexible masking controller
with a sufficiency-checking module to identify and revise unsupported,
redundant, or incomplete spans, yielding more faithful, concise, and coherent
outputs. Empirical results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that Arg-LLaDA
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in 7 out of 10 automatic evaluation
metrics. In addition, human evaluations reveal substantial improvements across
core dimensions, coverage, faithfulness, and conciseness, validating the
effectiveness of our iterative, sufficiency-aware generation strategy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单LLM方法难以处理涉及多面证据的复杂声明验证，而真实世界的事实核查通常采用辩论形式。

Method: 提出DebateCV框架，包含两个持对立立场的Debater和一个Moderator，通过多轮辩论生成验证结果，并利用合成数据优化Moderator性能。

Result: 实验表明，DebateCV在不同证据质量下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 辩论驱动的多代理框架能有效提升复杂声明验证的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Claim verification is critical for enhancing digital literacy. However, the
state-of-the-art single-LLM methods struggle with complex claim verification
that involves multi-faceted evidences. Inspired by real-world fact-checking
practices, we propose DebateCV, the first claim verification framework that
adopts a debate-driven methodology using multiple LLM agents. In our framework,
two Debaters take opposing stances on a claim and engage in multi-round
argumentation, while a Moderator evaluates the arguments and renders a verdict
with justifications. To further improve the performance of the Moderator, we
introduce a novel post-training strategy that leverages synthetic debate data
generated by the zero-shot DebateCV, effectively addressing the scarcity of
real-world debate-driven claim verification data. Experimental results show
that our method outperforms existing claim verification methods under varying
levels of evidence quality. Our code and dataset are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有主题质量评估方法（如连贯性和词入侵）未衡量主题对语料库探索的促进作用，需设计基于任务和用户的评估方法。

Method: 通过用户研究，提出主题质量构建，并让用户在主题背景下评估，结合反思性主题分析识别解释模式。

Result: 用户依赖可用性和代表性启发式解释主题，提出基于锚定调整启发式的主题解释理论。

Conclusion: 主题解释是生态理性用户在不确定性下的判断，需开发认知偏差感知的用户模型和评估框架。

Abstract: Interpretation of topics is crucial for their downstream applications.
State-of-the-art evaluation measures of topic quality such as coherence and
word intrusion do not measure how much a topic facilitates the exploration of a
corpus. To design evaluation measures grounded on a task, and a population of
users, we do user studies to understand how users interpret topics. We propose
constructs of topic quality and ask users to assess them in the context of a
topic and provide rationale behind evaluations. We use reflexive thematic
analysis to identify themes of topic interpretations from rationales. Users
interpret topics based on availability and representativeness heuristics rather
than probability. We propose a theory of topic interpretation based on the
anchoring-and-adjustment heuristic: users anchor on salient words and make
semantic adjustments to arrive at an interpretation. Topic interpretation can
be viewed as making a judgment under uncertainty by an ecologically rational
user, and hence cognitive biases aware user models and evaluation frameworks
are needed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在多个领域的广泛应用，其可能加剧社会偏见的问题引发担忧。本研究旨在揭示LLMs在非英语语言中生成偏见内容的机制，以促进更公平的AI系统。

Method: 采用结构化实验方法，通过API收集3600条响应，分析LLMs对无性别提示的回复，重点关注性别与职业偏见的关联。

Result: 结果显示LLMs（如Gemini和ChatGPT）在生成文本时明显倾向于性别刻板印象（如将“助理”与女性代词高度关联）。

Conclusion: LLMs的偏见可能对社会（如职场）产生负面影响，需开发缓解策略以确保AI系统减少而非加剧不平等。未来研究可扩展至更多语言或模型。

Abstract: The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in a large variety of
domains has sparked worries about how easily they can perpetuate stereotypes
and contribute to the generation of biased content. With a focus on gender and
professional bias, this work examines in which manner LLMs shape responses to
ungendered prompts, contributing to biased outputs. This analysis uses a
structured experimental method, giving different prompts involving three
different professional job combinations, which are also characterized by a
hierarchical relationship. This study uses Italian, a language with extensive
grammatical gender differences, to highlight potential limitations in current
LLMs' ability to generate objective text in non-English languages. Two popular
LLM-based chatbots are examined, namely OpenAI ChatGPT (gpt-4o-mini) and Google
Gemini (gemini-1.5-flash). Through APIs, we collected a range of 3600
responses. The results highlight how content generated by LLMs can perpetuate
stereotypes. For example, Gemini associated 100% (ChatGPT 97%) of 'she'
pronouns to the 'assistant' rather than the 'manager'. The presence of bias in
AI-generated text can have significant implications in many fields, such as in
the workplaces or in job selections, raising ethical concerns about its use.
Understanding these risks is pivotal to developing mitigation strategies and
assuring that AI-based systems do not increase social inequalities, but rather
contribute to more equitable outcomes. Future research directions include
expanding the study to additional chatbots or languages, refining prompt
engineering methods or further exploiting a larger experimental base.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLM）在数据投毒和方言差异（如AAVE与SAE）的共同作用下，会显著增加对AAVE输入的毒性输出，而SAE受影响较小。模型规模越大，放大效应越明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨方言差异（AAVE与SAE）与数据投毒如何共同影响LLM输出的毒性，揭示模型规模对偏见放大的作用。

Method: 使用不同规模的LLaMA模型，结合数据投毒实验，并通过GPT-4o作为公平性审计工具分析输出中的有害模式。

Result: 数据投毒显著增加AAVE输入的毒性输出，SAE受影响较小；模型规模越大，放大效应越明显。GPT-4o审计发现AAVE输入更易关联有害刻板印象。

Conclusion: 研究强调需开发方言感知的评估方法、针对性去偏干预措施及社会责任感强的训练协议，以减少方言偏见与数据投毒的复合影响。

Abstract: Despite the ongoing improvements in the design of large language models
(LLMs) to foster inclusion and balanced responses, these systems remain
susceptible to encoding and amplifying social biases. This study examines how
dialectal variation, specifically African American Vernacular English (AAVE)
versus Standard American English (SAE), interacts with data poisoning to
influence toxicity in outputs. Using both small- and medium-scale LLaMA models,
we show that even minimal exposure to poisoned data significantly increases
toxicity for AAVE inputs, while it remains comparatively unaffected for SAE.
Larger models exhibit a more significant amplification effect which suggests
heightened susceptibility with scale. To further assess these disparities, we
employed GPT-4o as a fairness auditor, which identified harmful stereotypical
patterns disproportionately tied to AAVE inputs, including portrayals of
aggression, criminality, and intellectual inferiority. These findings
underscore the compounding impact of data poisoning and dialectal bias and
emphasize the need for dialect-aware evaluation, targeted debiasing
interventions, and socially responsible training protocols during development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法无法同时保证可重复性、透明性和高效性，且高估程度未量化。

Method: 提出SCP（自动生成私有测试用例）和Rugged Scores（量化污染和训练偏差），每六个月基于ArXiv新文章构建动态评估。

Result: 实验证明框架高质量，并系统评估了当前大语言模型。

Conclusion: ArxivRoll有效解决了评估中的高估问题，提供了透明、高效的动态评估方案。

Abstract: Overestimation in evaluating large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasing concern. Due to the contamination of public benchmarks or imbalanced
model training, LLMs may achieve unreal evaluation results on public
benchmarks, either intentionally or unintentionally, which leads to unfair
comparisons among LLMs and undermines their realistic capability assessments.
Existing benchmarks attempt to address these issues by keeping test cases
permanently secret, mitigating contamination through human evaluation, or
repeatedly collecting and constructing new samples. However, these approaches
fail to ensure reproducibility, transparency, and high efficiency
simultaneously. Moreover, the extent of overestimation in current LLMs remains
unquantified. To address these issues, we propose ArxivRoll, a dynamic
evaluation framework inspired by one-time pad encryption in cryptography.
ArxivRoll comprises two key components: \emph{i) SCP (Sequencing, Cloze, and
Prediction)}, an automated generator for private test cases, and \emph{ii)
Rugged Scores (RS)}, metrics that measure the proportion of public benchmark
contamination and training bias. Leveraging SCP, ArxivRoll constructs a new
benchmark every six months using recent articles from ArXiv and employs them
for one-time evaluations of LLM performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the high quality of our benchmark, and we provide a systematic evaluation of
current LLMs. The source code is available at

Motivation: 揭示LLDMs的安全漏洞，研究其与LLMs的架构差异，并提出有效的攻击方法以评估其安全性。

Method: 提出PAD攻击方法，利用多注意力点攻击引导并行生成过程产生有害输出。

Result: PAD攻击成功率达97%，LLDMs有害生成速度是LLMs的2倍。

Conclusion: LLDMs存在显著安全风险，需进一步研究其架构以确保安全部署。

Abstract: Large Language Diffusion Models (LLDMs) exhibit comparable performance to
LLMs while offering distinct advantages in inference speed and mathematical
reasoning tasks.The precise and rapid generation capabilities of LLDMs amplify
concerns of harmful generations, while existing jailbreak methodologies
designed for Large Language Models (LLMs) prove limited effectiveness against
LLDMs and fail to expose safety vulnerabilities.Successful defense cannot
definitively resolve harmful generation concerns, as it remains unclear whether
LLDMs possess safety robustness or existing attacks are incompatible with
diffusion-based architectures.To address this, we first reveal the
vulnerability of LLDMs to jailbreak and demonstrate that attack failure in
LLDMs stems from fundamental architectural differences.We present a PArallel
Decoding jailbreak (PAD) for diffusion-based language models. PAD introduces
Multi-Point Attention Attack, which guides parallel generative processes toward
harmful outputs that inspired by affirmative response patterns in LLMs.
Experimental evaluations across four LLDMs demonstrate that PAD achieves
jailbreak attack success rates by 97%, revealing significant safety
vulnerabilities. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive LLMs of the same size,
LLDMs increase the harmful generation speed by 2x, significantly highlighting
risks of uncontrolled misuse.Through comprehensive analysis, we provide an
investigation into LLDM architecture, offering critical insights for the secure
deployment of diffusion-based language models.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在社会科学领域的应用潜力，尤其是对民粹主义这一复杂概念的识别能力。

Method: 通过构建专门的数据集，评估多种预训练和微调的语言模型，并分析其在民粹主义话语识别中的表现。

Result: 微调的RoBERTa模型优于指令调优的LLMs，但后者在跨领域数据上表现更稳健。

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂社会科学任务中仍有局限，微调模型更有效，但指令调优模型在跨领域任务中更具鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of instruction-following tasks, yet their grasp of nuanced social
science concepts remains underexplored. This paper examines whether LLMs can
identify and classify fine-grained forms of populism, a complex and contested
concept in both academic and media debates. To this end, we curate and release
novel datasets specifically designed to capture populist discourse. We evaluate
a range of pre-trained (large) language models, both open-weight and
proprietary, across multiple prompting paradigms. Our analysis reveals notable
variation in performance, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in detecting
populist discourse. We find that a fine-tuned RoBERTa classifier vastly
outperforms all new-era instruction-tuned LLMs, unless fine-tuned.
Additionally, we apply our best-performing model to analyze campaign speeches
by Donald Trump, extracting valuable insights into his strategic use of
populist rhetoric. Finally, we assess the generalizability of these models by
benchmarking them on campaign speeches by European politicians, offering a lens
into cross-context transferability in political discourse analysis. In this
setting, we find that instruction-tuned LLMs exhibit greater robustness on
out-of-domain data.

Motivation: 解决现有方法需要本体特定训练且难以泛化的问题。

Conclusion: AutoPCR在表型概念识别中表现出色，适用于新本体且无需特定训练。

Abstract: Phenotype concept recognition (CR) is a fundamental task in biomedical text
mining, enabling applications such as clinical diagnostics and knowledge graph
construction. However, existing methods often require ontology-specific
training and struggle to generalize across diverse text types and evolving
biomedical terminology. We present AutoPCR, a prompt-based phenotype CR method
that does not require ontology-specific training. AutoPCR performs CR in three
stages: entity extraction using a hybrid of rule-based and neural tagging
strategies, candidate retrieval via SapBERT, and entity linking through
prompting a large language model. Experiments on four benchmark datasets show
that AutoPCR achieves the best average and most robust performance across both
mention-level and document-level evaluations, surpassing prior state-of-the-art
methods. Further ablation and transfer studies demonstrate its inductive
capability and generalizability to new ontologies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Smooth Reading的分块推理方法，显著缩小了循环大语言模型与自注意力大语言模型在长上下文任务中的性能差距，同时保持了循环模型的高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环大语言模型因固定内存限制在长上下文任务中表现不佳，传统方法通过架构改进未能解决此问题。本文认为一次性处理整个上下文不适合循环模型，因此提出分块处理策略。

Method: 受人类阅读策略启发，提出Smooth Reading方法，分块处理上下文并迭代总结信息，减少内存需求。

Result: 实验表明，该方法将循环模型SWA-3B-4k在LongBench上的性能从低于自注意力模型5.68%提升至高于3.61%，且在64k上下文下训练快3倍、推理快2倍。

Conclusion: Smooth Reading首次使循环模型在长上下文任务中达到与自注意力模型相当的性能，为未来研究提供了新思路，并将公开代码和数据集。

Abstract: Recently, recurrent large language models (Recurrent LLMs) with linear
computational complexity have re-emerged as efficient alternatives to
self-attention-based LLMs (Self-Attention LLMs), which have quadratic
complexity. However, Recurrent LLMs often underperform on long-context tasks
due to their limited fixed-size memory. Previous research has primarily focused
on enhancing the memory capacity of Recurrent LLMs through architectural
innovations, but these approaches have not yet enabled Recurrent LLMs to match
the performance of Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We argue that
this limitation arises because processing the entire context at once is not
well-suited for Recurrent LLMs. In this paper, we propose Smooth Reading, a
chunk-wise inference method inspired by human reading strategies. Smooth
Reading processes context in chunks and iteratively summarizes the contextual
information, thereby reducing memory demands and making the approach more
compatible with Recurrent LLMs. Our experimental results show that this method
substantially narrows the performance gap between Recurrent and Self-Attention
LLMs on long-context tasks, while preserving the efficiency advantages of
Recurrent LLMs. Our Smooth Reading boosts SWA-3B-4k (a Recurrent LLM) from
5.68% lower to 3.61% higher performance than Self-Attention LLMs on LongBench.
Besides, our method maintains the high efficiency, training 3x faster and
inferring 2x faster at 64k context compared to Self-Attention LLMs. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to achieve comparable performance using
Recurrent LLMs compared with Self-Attention LLMs on long-context tasks. We hope
our method will inspire future research in this area. To facilitate further
progress, we will release code and dataset.

Motivation: 多模态情感识别中ASR和说话人日志的时间戳未对齐会降低可靠性，需解决此问题以提高准确性。

Method: 使用预训练ASR和说话人日志模型同步时间戳，结合RoBERTa文本嵌入和Wav2Vec音频嵌入，通过门控机制增强跨注意力融合。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上，精确时间戳对齐显著提升SER准确性，优于未同步的基线方法。

Conclusion: 时间戳对齐对多模态情感识别至关重要，为稳健的情感分析提供了基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of incorporating timestamp-based
alignment between Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) transcripts and Speaker
Diarization (SD) outputs on Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) accuracy.
Misalignment between these two modalities often reduces the reliability of
multimodal emotion recognition systems, particularly in conversational
contexts. To address this issue, we introduce an alignment pipeline utilizing
pre-trained ASR and speaker diarization models, systematically synchronizing
timestamps to generate accurately labeled speaker segments. Our multimodal
approach combines textual embeddings extracted via RoBERTa with audio
embeddings from Wav2Vec, leveraging cross-attention fusion enhanced by a gating
mechanism. Experimental evaluations on the IEMOCAP benchmark dataset
demonstrate that precise timestamp alignment improves SER accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods that lack synchronization. The results highlight
the critical importance of temporal alignment, demonstrating its effectiveness
in enhancing overall emotion recognition accuracy and providing a foundation
for robust multimodal emotion analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音理解评估指标（如WER）不足以全面衡量LLM Voice的能力，需引入认知层次评估。

Method: SIQ通过三个认知层次评估LLM Voice：(1)记忆（WER）；(2)理解（解释相似性）；(3)应用（QA准确性）。

Result: SIQ不仅能量化语音理解能力，还能比较不同方法、发现标注错误和检测幻觉。

Conclusion: SIQ是首个结合认知原理与语音基准的智能评估框架，揭示了多模态训练中被忽视的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human
cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language
models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving
beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ
examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy:
(1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e.,
similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy
for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies
voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between
cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SGEC高质量标注数据集稀缺，需自动化生成数据以补充资源。

Method: 开发全自动方法生成音频-文本对，提出客观指标评估数据质量。

Result: 生成的数据集保持了原始数据的文本和声学特征，同时引入新错误类型，适用于GEC和SGEC任务。

Conclusion: 该方法成功扩充了SGEC数据集，未影响L2学习者的语言评估分数。

Abstract: While there exist strong benchmark datasets for grammatical error correction
(GEC), high-quality annotated spoken datasets for Spoken GEC (SGEC) are still
under-resourced. In this paper, we propose a fully automated method to generate
audio-text pairs with grammatical errors and disfluencies. Moreover, we propose
a series of objective metrics that can be used to evaluate the generated data
and choose the more suitable dataset for SGEC. The goal is to generate an
augmented dataset that maintains the textual and acoustic characteristics of
the original data while providing new types of errors. This augmented dataset
should augment and enrich the original corpus without altering the language
assessment scores of the second language (L2) learners. We evaluate the use of
the augmented corpus both for written GEC (the text part) and for SGEC (the
audio-text pairs). Our experiments are conducted on the S\&I Corpus, the first
publicly available speech dataset with grammar error annotations.

Motivation: 为荷兰临床自由文本中的ADE检测提供基准，并评估不同模型在命名实体识别（NER）和关系分类（RC）任务中的表现。

Method: 训练了Bi-LSTM和四种Transformer模型（BERTje、RobBERT、MedRoBERTa.nl、NuNER），使用102份荷兰ICU临床进展笔记进行NER和RC任务，并在内部和外部验证ADE检测性能。

Result: MedRoBERTa.nl在ADE RC任务中表现最佳，宏平均F1分数为0.63（黄金标准）和0.62（预测实体），外部验证中召回率为0.67至0.74。

Conclusion: 研究为临床自由文本中的ADE检测提供了稳健且有临床意义的评估方法，强调了使用适合任务的性能指标的重要性。

Abstract: In this study, we set a benchmark for adverse drug event (ADE) detection in
Dutch clinical free text documents using several transformer models, clinical
scenarios and fit-for-purpose performance measures. We trained a Bidirectional
Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model and four transformer-based Dutch and/or
multilingual encoder models (BERTje, RobBERT, MedRoBERTa.nl, and NuNER) for the
tasks of named entity recognition (NER) and relation classification (RC) using
102 richly annotated Dutch ICU clinical progress notes. Anonymized free text
clinical progress notes of patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) of
one academic hospital and discharge letters of patients admitted to Internal
Medicine wards of two non-academic hospitals were reused. We evaluated our ADE
RC models internally using gold standard (two-step task) and predicted entities
(end-to-end task). In addition, all models were externally validated on
detecting ADEs at the document level. We report both micro- and macro-averaged
F1 scores, given the imbalance of ADEs in the datasets. Although differences
for the ADE RC task between the models were small, MedRoBERTa.nl was the best
performing model with macro-averaged F1 score of 0.63 using gold standard and
0.62 using predicted entities. The MedRoBERTa.nl models also performed the best
in our external validation and achieved recall of between 0.67 to 0.74 using
predicted entities, meaning between 67 to 74% of discharge letters with ADEs
were detected. Our benchmark study presents a robust and clinically meaningful
approach for evaluating language models for ADE detection in clinical free text
documents. Our study highlights the need to use appropriate performance
measures fit for the task of ADE detection in clinical free-text documents and
envisioned future clinical use.

Motivation: 现有医疗文本嵌入模型数据覆盖窄且方法过时，评估标准不足，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 使用MEDTE模型，通过自监督对比学习在多样化医疗语料上进行微调，并设计医疗专用评估基准。

Result: 该方法在多种任务中表现优于现有技术，提供了更稳健的评估框架。

Conclusion: 结合MEDTE模型和定制化评估基准，显著提升了医疗文本嵌入的性能和适用性。

Abstract: Medical text embedding models are foundational to a wide array of healthcare
applications, ranging from clinical decision support and biomedical information
retrieval to medical question answering, yet they remain hampered by two
critical shortcomings. First, most models are trained on a narrow slice of
medical and biological data, beside not being up to date in terms of
methodology, making them ill suited to capture the diversity of terminology and
semantics encountered in practice. Second, existing evaluations are often
inadequate: even widely used benchmarks fail to generalize across the full
spectrum of real world medical tasks.
  To address these gaps, we leverage MEDTE, a GTE model extensively fine-tuned
on diverse medical corpora through self-supervised contrastive learning across
multiple data sources, to deliver robust medical text embeddings.
  Alongside this model, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite of 51 tasks
spanning classification, clustering, pair classification, and retrieval modeled
on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB) but tailored to the nuances of
medical text. Our results demonstrate that this combined approach not only
establishes a robust evaluation framework but also yields embeddings that
consistently outperform state of the art alternatives in different tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用语言的可解释性为LLM提供更丰富的学习媒介，而非依赖稀疏的标量奖励。

Method: GEPA通过自然语言反思诊断问题、提出并测试提示更新，结合帕累托前沿的互补经验。

Result: 在四个任务中，GEPA平均优于GRPO 10%，最高20%，且尝试次数减少35倍；优于MIPROv2 10%。

Conclusion: GEPA展示了在少量尝试下高效优化LLM任务的潜力，尤其在代码优化中表现突出。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adapted to downstream tasks via
reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), which often require thousands of rollouts to learn new tasks. We argue
that the interpretable nature of language can often provide a much richer
learning medium for LLMs, compared with policy gradients derived from sparse,
scalar rewards. To test this, we introduce GEPA (Genetic-Pareto), a prompt
optimizer that thoroughly incorporates natural language reflection to learn
high-level rules from trial and error. Given any AI system containing one or
more LLM prompts, GEPA samples system-level trajectories (e.g., reasoning, tool
calls, and tool outputs) and reflects on them in natural language to diagnose
problems, propose and test prompt updates, and combine complementary lessons
from the Pareto frontier of its own attempts. As a result of GEPA's design, it
can often turn even just a few rollouts into a large quality gain. Across four
tasks, GEPA outperforms GRPO by 10% on average and by up to 20%, while using up
to 35x fewer rollouts. GEPA also outperforms the leading prompt optimizer,
MIPROv2, by over 10% across two LLMs, and demonstrates promising results as an
inference-time search strategy for code optimization.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨数据集分布偏移问题，同时保持了参数效率。

Abstract: Lane detection models are often evaluated in a closed-world setting, where
training and testing occur on the same dataset. We observe that, even within
the same domain, cross-dataset distribution shifts can cause severe
catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. To address this, we first train a
base model on a source distribution and then adapt it to each new target
distribution by creating separate branches, fine-tuning only selected
components while keeping the original source branch fixed. Based on a
component-wise analysis, we identify effective fine-tuning strategies for
target distributions that enable parameter-efficient adaptation. At inference
time, we propose using a supervised contrastive learning model to identify the
input distribution and dynamically route it to the corresponding branch. Our
framework achieves near-optimal F1-scores while using significantly fewer
parameters than training separate models for each distribution.

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud deep learning have led to models that achieve
high per-part labeling accuracy on large-scale point clouds, using only the raw
geometry of unordered point sets. In parallel, the field of human parsing
focuses on predicting body part and clothing/accessory labels from images. This
work aims to bridge these two domains by enabling per-vertex semantic
segmentation of large-scale human meshes. To achieve this, a pseudo-ground
truth labeling pipeline is developed for the Thuman2.1 dataset: meshes are
first aligned to a canonical pose, segmented from multiple viewpoints, and the
resulting point-level labels are then backprojected onto the original mesh to
produce per-point pseudo ground truth annotations. Subsequently, a novel,
memory-efficient sampling strategy is introduced, a windowed iterative farthest
point sampling (FPS) with space-filling curve-based serialization to
effectively downsample the point clouds. This is followed by a purely geometric
segmentation using PointTransformer, enabling semantic parsing of human meshes
without relying on texture information. Experimental results confirm the
effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach.

Method: 提出ShrinkBox攻击，通过轻微缩小真实边界框尺寸，在训练数据中植入后门，影响YOLOv9m等物体检测器的性能。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上，仅需4%的投毒比例即可实现96%的攻击成功率，并导致下游距离估计的平均绝对误差增加3倍以上。

Conclusion: ShrinkBox攻击揭示了ML-ADAS系统中物体检测器的安全风险，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) significantly enhance road safety
by detecting potential collisions and alerting drivers. However, their reliance
on expensive sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar limits accessibility,
particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Machine learning-based ADAS
(ML-ADAS), leveraging deep neural networks (DNNs) with only standard camera
input, offers a cost-effective alternative. Critical to ML-ADAS is the
collision avoidance feature, which requires the ability to detect objects and
estimate their distances accurately. This is achieved with specialized DNNs
like YOLO, which provides real-time object detection, and a lightweight,
detection-wise distance estimation approach that relies on key features
extracted from the detections like bounding box dimensions and size. However,
the robustness of these systems is undermined by security vulnerabilities in
object detectors. In this paper, we introduce ShrinkBox, a novel backdoor
attack targeting object detection in collision avoidance ML-ADAS. Unlike
existing attacks that manipulate object class labels or presence, ShrinkBox
subtly shrinks ground truth bounding boxes. This attack remains undetected in
dataset inspections and standard benchmarks while severely disrupting
downstream distance estimation. We demonstrate that ShrinkBox can be realized
in the YOLOv9m object detector at an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96%, with
only a 4% poisoning ratio in the training instances of the KITTI dataset.
Furthermore, given the low error targets introduced in our relaxed poisoning
strategy, we find that ShrinkBox increases the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in
downstream distance estimation by more than 3x on poisoned samples, potentially
resulting in delays or prevention of collision warnings altogether.

Result: VGS-ATD在30个数据集和80个独立标签上达到92.7%的准确率，优于集中式学习（84.9%）和群体学习（72.99%），且扩展后准确率仅下降1%。

Conclusion: VGS-ATD在隐私保护、效率和可扩展性方面表现优异，是医疗影像任务的理想解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, advanced deep learning architectures have shown strong
performance in medical imaging tasks. However, the traditional centralized
learning paradigm poses serious privacy risks as all data is collected and
trained on a single server. To mitigate this challenge, decentralized
approaches such as federated learning and swarm learning have emerged, allowing
model training on local nodes while sharing only model weights. While these
methods enhance privacy, they struggle with heterogeneous and imbalanced data
and suffer from inefficiencies due to frequent communication and the
aggregation of weights. More critically, the dynamic and complex nature of
clinical environments demands scalable AI systems capable of continuously
learning from diverse modalities and multilabels. Yet, both centralized and
decentralized models are prone to catastrophic forgetting during system
expansion, often requiring full model retraining to incorporate new data. To
address these limitations, we propose VGS-ATD, a novel distributed learning
framework. To validate VGS-ATD, we evaluate it in experiments spanning 30
datasets and 80 independent labels across distributed nodes, VGS-ATD achieved
an overall accuracy of 92.7%, outperforming centralized learning (84.9%) and
swarm learning (72.99%), while federated learning failed under these conditions
due to high requirements on computational resources. VGS-ATD also demonstrated
strong scalability, with only a 1% drop in accuracy on existing nodes after
expansion, compared to a 20% drop in centralized learning, highlighting its
resilience to catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, it reduced computational
costs by up to 50% relative to both centralized and swarm learning, confirming
its superior efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Computer vision applications are omnipresent nowadays. The current paper
explores the use of fuzzy logic in computer vision, stressing its role in

discuss key fuzzy techniques, including fuzzy clustering, fuzzy inference
systems, type-2 fuzzy sets, and fuzzy rule-based decision-making. The paper
also discusses various applications, including medical imaging, autonomous
systems, and industrial inspection. Additionally, we explore the integration of
fuzzy logic with deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks

emerging trends such as hybrid fuzzy-deep learning models and explainable AI.

Abstract: Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human
mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban
governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to
predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory
on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However,
the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason
over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent
development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a
new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an
image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to
perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we
first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which
evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based
reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights
from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor,
which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and
trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用多模态AI技术提升嫌疑人素描的自动化水平和质量。

Method: 开发并评估了三种模型：基础Stable Diffusion模型、结合CLIP的模型，以及引入LoRA微调CLIP的新方法。

Result: 基础模型在SSIM和PSNR上表现最优，而新模型在LPIPS上有改进但未超越基础模型。

Conclusion: 基础模型在结构和清晰度上表现最佳，但新模型在感知相似性上有潜力。

Abstract: This project investigates the use of multimodal AI-driven approaches to
automate and enhance suspect sketching. Three pipelines were developed and
evaluated: (1) baseline image-to-image Stable Diffusion model, (2) same model
integrated with a pre-trained CLIP model for text-image alignment, and (3)
novel approach incorporating LoRA fine-tuning of the CLIP model, applied to
self-attention and cross-attention layers, and integrated with Stable
Diffusion. An ablation study confirmed that fine-tuning both self- and
cross-attention layers yielded the best alignment between text descriptions and
sketches. Performance testing revealed that Model 1 achieved the highest
structural similarity (SSIM) of 0.72 and a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of
25 dB, outperforming Model 2 and Model 3. Iterative refinement enhanced
perceptual similarity (LPIPS), with Model 3 showing improvement over Model 2
but still trailing Model 1. Qualitatively, sketches generated by Model 1
demonstrated the clearest facial features, highlighting its robustness as a
baseline despite its simplicity.

Motivation: 传统模型（如CNN和RNN）在复杂动作识别中泛化能力不足，而基于视觉-语言的CLIP模型有望改善这一问题。

Method: 在UCF-101数据集上测试CLIP，采用三种掩码策略（百分比/形状掩码、特征特定掩码和隔离掩码），并提出通过类别特定噪声增强模型。

Result: CLIP在视觉线索被遮挡时表现不稳定，但通过类别特定噪声的增强，分类准确率和模型信心得到提升，同时减少了偏差。

Conclusion: 论文讨论了CLIP在临床领域的应用挑战，并提出了未来改进跨领域医疗场景泛化能力的方向。

Abstract: Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine,
supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection,
surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional
models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle
to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer
promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In
this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze
its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and
shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to
suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only
class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent
behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual
cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating
class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce
attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification
accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a
discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and
outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across
domain-independent healthcare scenarios.

TL;DR: HeartUnloadNet是一种深度学习框架，直接从舒张末期网格预测左心室的无负载形状，结合生物物理先验，显著提高了计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无负载心脏几何形状对个性化生物力学建模至关重要，但传统方法计算成本高且复杂。

Method: 采用图注意力架构和循环一致性策略，结合生理参数，实现双向预测。

Result: 在20,700次有限元模拟中，HeartUnloadNet达到亚毫米精度，推理时间仅0.02秒，比传统方法快10^5倍。

Conclusion: HeartUnloadNet为传统逆有限元求解器提供了可扩展且准确的替代方案，支持实时临床应用。

Abstract: The unloaded cardiac geometry (i.e., the state of the heart devoid of luminal
pressure) serves as a valuable zero-stress and zero-strain reference and is
critical for personalized biomechanical modeling of cardiac function, to
understand both healthy and diseased physiology and to predict the effects of
cardiac interventions. However, estimating the unloaded geometry from clinical
images remains a challenging task. Traditional approaches rely on inverse
finite element (FE) solvers that require iterative optimization and are
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce HeartUnloadNet, a deep
learning framework that predicts the unloaded left ventricular (LV) shape
directly from the end diastolic (ED) mesh while explicitly incorporating
biophysical priors. The network accepts a mesh of arbitrary size along with
physiological parameters such as ED pressure, myocardial stiffness scale, and
fiber helix orientation, and outputs the corresponding unloaded mesh. It adopts
a graph attention architecture and employs a cycle-consistency strategy to
enable bidirectional (loading and unloading) prediction, allowing for partial
self-supervision that improves accuracy and reduces the need for large training
datasets. Trained and tested on 20,700 FE simulations across diverse LV
geometries and physiological conditions, HeartUnloadNet achieves sub-millimeter
accuracy, with an average DSC of 0.986 and HD of 0.083 cm, while reducing
inference time to just 0.02 seconds per case, over 10^5 times faster and
significantly more accurate than traditional inverse FE solvers. Ablation
studies confirm the effectiveness of the architecture. Notably, the
cycle-consistent design enables the model to maintain a DSC of 97% even with as
few as 200 training samples. This work thus presents a scalable and accurate
surrogate for inverse FE solvers, supporting real-time clinical applications in
the future.

Conclusion: 该方法为开发感知和理解物理环境的AI系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence is emerging as a transformative frontier in AI, yet it
remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets. Unlike the
abundant 2D imagery, acquiring 3D data typically requires specialized sensors
and laborious annotation. In this work, we present a scalable pipeline that
converts single-view images into comprehensive, scale- and appearance-realistic
3D representations - including point clouds, camera poses, depth maps, and
pseudo-RGBD - via integrated depth estimation, camera calibration, and scale
calibration. Our method bridges the gap between the vast repository of imagery
and the increasing demand for spatial scene understanding. By automatically
generating authentic, scale-aware 3D data from images, we significantly reduce
data collection costs and open new avenues for advancing spatial intelligence.
We release two generated spatial datasets, i.e., COCO-3D and Objects365-v2-3D,
and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our generated data can
benefit various 3D tasks, ranging from fundamental perception to MLLM-based
reasoning. These results validate our pipeline as an effective solution for
developing AI systems capable of perceiving, understanding, and interacting
with physical environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如NeRF和3DGS）在训练和渲染速度、传感器兼容性及通用性方面存在不足，限制了自动驾驶测试的扩展性。

Method: SaLF使用稀疏的3D体素基元表示体积，每个体素为局部隐式场，支持快速训练和渲染，并适应大场景。

Result: SaLF训练时间短（<30分钟），渲染速度快（相机50+ FPS，LiDAR 600+ FPS），且支持非针孔相机和旋转LiDAR。

Conclusion: SaLF在保持真实感的同时提升了效率和功能，为自动驾驶传感器模拟提供了更可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity sensor simulation of light-based sensors such as cameras and
LiDARs is critical for safe and accurate autonomy testing. Neural radiance
field (NeRF)-based methods that reconstruct sensor observations via ray-casting
of implicit representations have demonstrated accurate simulation of driving
scenes, but are slow to train and render, hampering scale. 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated faster training and rendering times through
rasterization, but is primarily restricted to pinhole camera sensors,
preventing usage for realistic multi-sensor autonomy evaluation. Moreover, both
NeRF and 3DGS couple the representation with the rendering procedure (implicit
networks for ray-based evaluation, particles for rasterization), preventing
interoperability, which is key for general usage. In this work, we present
Sparse Local Fields (SaLF), a novel volumetric representation that supports
rasterization and raytracing. SaLF represents volumes as a sparse set of 3D
voxel primitives, where each voxel is a local implicit field. SaLF has fast
training (<30 min) and rendering capabilities (50+ FPS for camera and 600+ FPS
LiDAR), has adaptive pruning and densification to easily handle large scenes,
and can support non-pinhole cameras and spinning LiDARs. We demonstrate that
SaLF has similar realism as existing self-driving sensor simulation methods
while improving efficiency and enhancing capabilities, enabling more scalable
simulation. https://waabi.ai/salf/

Abstract: Optical Music Recognition (OMR) for historical Chinese musical notations,
such as suzipu and l\"ul\"upu, presents unique challenges due to high class
imbalance and limited training data. This paper introduces significant
advancements in OMR for Jiang Kui's influential collection Baishidaoren Gequ
from 1202. In this work, we develop and evaluate a character recognition model
for scarce imbalanced data. We improve upon previous baselines by reducing the
Character Error Rate (CER) from 10.4% to 7.1% for suzipu, despite working with
77 highly imbalanced classes, and achieve a remarkable CER of 0.9% for
l\"ul\"upu. Our models outperform human transcribers, with an average human CER
of 15.9% and a best-case CER of 7.6%. We employ temperature scaling to achieve
a well-calibrated model with an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) below 0.0162.
Using a leave-one-edition-out cross-validation approach, we ensure robust
performance across five historical editions. Additionally, we extend the
KuiSCIMA dataset to include all 109 pieces from Baishidaoren Gequ, encompassing
suzipu, l\"ul\"upu, and jianzipu notations. Our findings advance the
digitization and accessibility of historical Chinese music, promoting cultural
diversity in OMR and expanding its applicability to underrepresented music

Result: 在图像-文本检索、图像描述生成和视觉问答任务中，SAR-Text数据集显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: SAR-Text数据集和SAR-Narrator框架为SAR图像的语义理解提供了有效工具，并可扩展至更大规模的数据集构建。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in the
field of remote sensing in recent years. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery, with its all-weather capability, is essential in remote sensing, yet
the lack of large-scale, high-quality SAR image-text datasets hinders its
semantic understanding. In this paper, we construct SAR-Text, a large-scale and
high-quality dataset consisting of over 130,000 SAR image-text pairs. To
construct the SAR-Text dataset, we design the SAR-Narrator framework, which
generates textual descriptions for SAR images through a multi-stage progressive
transfer learning strategy. To verify the effectiveness of the SAR-TEXT
dataset, we conduct experiments on three typical vision-language tasks:
image-text retrieval, image captioning, and visual question answering (VQA).
Specifically, we construct three representative models on SAR-TEXT:
SAR-RS-CLIP, SAR-RS-CoCa, and SAR-GPT. SAR-RS-CLIP achieves notable
improvements in retrieval performance, boosting average recall by 16.43% and
10.54% on the OSdataset-512 and HRSID test sets, respectively. In the
captioning task, SAR-RS-CoCa achieves BLEU-4, SPICE, and CIDEr scores exceeding
those of the original CoCa model by more than 8x, 4x, and 10x, respectively. In
the VQA task, SAR-GPT outperforms baseline and single-stage models on multiple
SAR-VQA datasets, demonstrating stronger semantic understanding and reasoning
ability, as further confirmed by qualitative results. It is worth noting that,
as a flexible captioning tool, SAR-Narrator can be readily adopted by the
community to construct larger-scale SAR image-text datasets.

Conclusion: Human Gaussian Graph通过建模高斯与网格的关系，显著提升了动画化人体建模的效果。

Abstract: Modeling animatable human avatars from videos is a long-standing and
challenging problem. While conventional methods require per-instance
optimization, recent feed-forward methods have been proposed to generate 3D
Gaussians with a learnable network. However, these methods predict Gaussians
for each frame independently, without fully capturing the relations of
Gaussians from different timestamps. To address this, we propose Human Gaussian
Graph to model the connection between predicted Gaussians and human SMPL mesh,
so that we can leverage information from all frames to recover an animatable
human representation. Specifically, the Human Gaussian Graph contains dual
layers where Gaussians are the first layer nodes and mesh vertices serve as the
second layer nodes. Based on this structure, we further propose the intra-node
operation to aggregate various Gaussians connected to one mesh vertex, and
inter-node operation to support message passing among mesh node neighbors.
Experimental results on novel view synthesis and novel pose animation
demonstrate the efficiency and generalization of our method.

Abstract: Drivable Free-space prediction is a fundamental and crucial problem in
autonomous driving. Recent works have addressed the problem by representing the
entire non-obstacle road regions as the free-space. In contrast our aim is to
estimate the driving corridors that are a navigable subset of the entire road
region. Unfortunately, existing corridor estimation methods directly assume a
BEV-centric representation, which is hard to obtain. In contrast, we frame
drivable free-space corridor prediction as a pure image perception task, using
only monocular camera input. However such a formulation poses several
challenges as one doesn't have the corresponding data for such free-space
corridor segments in the image. Consequently, we develop a novel
self-supervised approach for free-space sample generation by leveraging future
ego trajectories and front-view camera images, making the process of visual
corridor estimation dependent on the ego trajectory. We then employ a diffusion
process to model the distribution of such segments in the image. However, the
existing binary mask-based representation for a segment poses many limitations.
Therefore, we introduce ContourDiff, a specialized diffusion-based architecture
that denoises over contour points rather than relying on binary mask
representations, enabling structured and interpretable free-space predictions.
We evaluate our approach qualitatively and quantitatively on both nuScenes and
CARLA, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately predicting safe multimodal
navigable corridors in the image.

Abstract: Image captioning, a task at the confluence of computer vision and natural
language processing, requires a sophisticated understanding of both visual
scenes and linguistic structure. While modern approaches are dominated by
large-scale Transformer architectures, this paper documents a systematic,
iterative development of foundational image captioning models, progressing from
a simple CNN-LSTM encoder-decoder to a competitive attention-based system. We
present a series of five models, beginning with Genesis and concluding with
Nexus, an advanced model featuring an EfficientNetV2B3 backbone and a dynamic
attention mechanism. Our experiments chart the impact of architectural
enhancements and demonstrate a key finding within the classic CNN-LSTM
paradigm: merely upgrading the visual backbone without a corresponding
attention mechanism can degrade performance, as the single-vector bottleneck
cannot transmit the richer visual detail. This insight validates the
architectural shift to attention. Trained on the MS COCO 2017 dataset, our
final model, Nexus, achieves a BLEU-4 score of 31.4, surpassing several
foundational benchmarks and validating our iterative design process. This work
provides a clear, replicable blueprint for understanding the core architectural
principles that underpin modern vision-language tasks.

Conclusion: 研究证明，无需原始图像处理，仅通过面部关键点提取即可实现高效的深度伪造检测，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rise of deepfake technology brings forth new questions about the
authenticity of various forms of media found online today. Videos and images
generated by artificial intelligence (AI) have become increasingly more
difficult to differentiate from genuine media, resulting in the need for new
models to detect artificially-generated media. While many models have attempted
to solve this, most focus on direct image processing, adapting a convolutional
neural network (CNN) or a recurrent neural network (RNN) that directly
interacts with the video image data. This paper introduces an approach of using
solely facial landmarks for deepfake detection. Using a dataset consisting of
both deepfake and genuine videos of human faces, this paper describes an
approach for extracting facial landmarks for deepfake detection, focusing on
identifying subtle inconsistencies in facial movements instead of raw image
processing. Experimental results demonstrated that this feature extraction
technique is effective in various neural network models, with the same facial
landmarks tested on three neural network models, with promising performance
metrics indicating its potential for real-world applications. The findings
discussed in this paper include RNN and artificial neural network (ANN) models
with accuracy between 96% and 93%, respectively, with a CNN model hovering
around 78%. This research challenges the assumption that raw image processing
is necessary to identify deepfake videos by presenting a facial feature
extraction approach compatible with various neural network models while
requiring fewer parameters.

Abstract: We introduce the Flow Stochastic Segmentation Network (Flow-SSN), a
generative segmentation model family featuring discrete-time autoregressive and
modern continuous-time flow variants. We prove fundamental limitations of the
low-rank parameterisation of previous methods and show that Flow-SSNs can
estimate arbitrarily high-rank pixel-wise covariances without assuming the rank
or storing the distributional parameters. Flow-SSNs are also more efficient to
sample from than standard diffusion-based segmentation models, thanks to most
of the model capacity being allocated to learning the base distribution of the
flow, constituting an expressive prior. We apply Flow-SSNs to challenging
medical imaging benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Code

Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has advanced WSI analysis but struggles with
the complexity and heterogeneity of WSIs. Existing MIL methods face challenges
in aggregating diverse patch information into robust WSI representations. While
ViTs and clustering-based approaches show promise, they are computationally
intensive and fail to capture task-specific and slide-specific variability. To
address these limitations, we propose PTCMIL, a novel Prompt Token
Clustering-based ViT for MIL aggregation. By introducing learnable prompt
tokens into the ViT backbone, PTCMIL unifies clustering and prediction tasks in
an end-to-end manner. It dynamically aligns clustering with downstream tasks,
using projection-based clustering tailored to each WSI, reducing complexity
while preserving patch heterogeneity. Through token merging and prototype-based
pooling, PTCMIL efficiently captures task-relevant patterns. Extensive
experiments on eight datasets demonstrate its superior performance in
classification and survival analysis tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. Systematic ablation studies confirm its robustness and strong
interpretability. The code is released at https://github.com/ubc-tea/PTCMIL.

Motivation: 解决现有V-ASR方法因视觉音素（viseme）模糊性和数据需求大而导致的高错误率问题。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段通过V-ASR预测音素，第二阶段使用NLLB模型将音素重构为单词。结合视觉和面部特征。

Result: 在LRS2和LRS3数据集上分别达到17.4%和21.0%的词错误率（WER）。

Conclusion: 提出的PV-ASR方法通过音素和LLM的结合，显著提升了视觉语音识别的性能。

Abstract: Visual Automatic Speech Recognition (V-ASR) is a challenging task that
involves interpreting spoken language solely from visual information, such as
lip movements and facial expressions. This task is notably challenging due to
the absence of auditory cues and the visual ambiguity of phonemes that exhibit
similar visemes-distinct sounds that appear identical in lip motions. Existing
methods often aim to predict words or characters directly from visual cues, but
they commonly suffer from high error rates due to viseme ambiguity and require
large amounts of pre-training data. We propose a novel phoneme-based two-stage
framework that fuses visual and landmark motion features, followed by an LLM
model for word reconstruction to address these challenges. Stage 1 consists of
V-ASR, which outputs the predicted phonemes, thereby reducing training
complexity. Meanwhile, the facial landmark features address speaker-specific
facial characteristics. Stage 2 comprises an encoder-decoder LLM model, NLLB,
that reconstructs the output phonemes back to words. Besides using a large
visual dataset for deep learning fine-tuning, our PV-ASR method demonstrates
superior performance by achieving 17.4% WER on the LRS2 and 21.0% WER on the
LRS3 dataset.

Abstract: Studying adversarial attacks on point clouds is essential for evaluating and
improving the robustness of 3D deep learning models. However, most existing
attack methods are developed under ideal white-box settings and often suffer
from limited transferability to unseen models and insufficient robustness
against common defense mechanisms. In this paper, we propose MAT-Adv, a novel
adversarial attack framework that enhances both transferability and
undefendability by explicitly perturbing the medial axis transform (MAT)
representations, in order to induce inherent adversarialness in the resulting
point clouds. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to project input point
clouds into compact MAT representations that capture the intrinsic geometric
structure of point clouds. By perturbing these intrinsic representations,
MAT-Adv introduces structural-level adversarial characteristics that remain
effective across diverse models and defense strategies. To mitigate overfitting
and prevent perturbation collapse, we incorporate a dropout strategy into the
optimization of MAT perturbations, further improving transferability and
undefendability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAT-Adv significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both transferability and
undefendability. Codes will be made public upon paper acceptance.

*Bolei Chen,Jiaxu Kang,Haonan Yang,Ping Zhong,Jianxin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过引入3D几何先验来解决2D平面图定位问题的方法，利用多视角约束和自监督对比学习，显著提升了定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 平面图定位因视觉感知与平面图的模态和几何差异存在挑战，现有方法无法解决视觉变化和遮挡导致的定位误差。

Method: 通过多视角约束建模几何感知的视角不变性，并结合场景表面重建与RGB帧增强跨模态几何-颜色对应关系，采用自监督对比学习建模3D先验。

Result: 方法在广泛的实际场景中显著优于现有技术，大幅提升了定位精度。

Conclusion: 3D几何先验的引入有效解决了模态差异问题，提升了定位性能，且无需额外计算负担。

Abstract: Since a building's floorplans are easily accessible, consistent over time,
and inherently robust to changes in visual appearance, self-localization within
the floorplan has attracted researchers' interest. However, since floorplans
are minimalist representations of a building's structure, modal and geometric
differences between visual perceptions and floorplans pose challenges to this
task. While existing methods cleverly utilize 2D geometric features and pose
filters to achieve promising performance, they fail to address the localization
errors caused by frequent visual changes and view occlusions due to variously
shaped 3D objects. To tackle these issues, this paper views the 2D Floorplan
Localization (FLoc) problem from a higher dimension by injecting 3D geometric
priors into the visual FLoc algorithm. For the 3D geometric prior modeling, we
first model geometrically aware view invariance using multi-view constraints,
i.e., leveraging imaging geometric principles to provide matching constraints
between multiple images that see the same points. Then, we further model the
view-scene aligned geometric priors, enhancing the cross-modal geometry-color
correspondences by associating the scene's surface reconstruction with the RGB
frames of the sequence. Both 3D priors are modeled through self-supervised
contrastive learning, thus no additional geometric or semantic annotations are
required. These 3D priors summarized in extensive realistic scenes bridge the
modal gap while improving localization success without increasing the
computational burden on the FLoc algorithm. Sufficient comparative studies
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
and substantially boosts the FLoc accuracy. All data and code will be released
after the anonymous review.

*Zhihao Luo,Luojun Lin,Zheng Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为S2R-COD的新任务，通过合成数据与真实数据的域适应框架（CSRDA）解决伪装目标检测中数据不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据收集和标注成本高，伪装目标检测（COD）的数据集较少，尤其是某些特殊类别。合成数据可以缓解这一问题，但直接使用合成数据训练会导致模型性能下降。

Method: 提出了CSRDA框架，基于师生模型，通过伪标签和一致性正则化将类别信息从标注的合成域传播到未标注的真实域，并通过循环学习框架缩小域内差距。

Result: 实验表明，CSRDA框架有效缓解了COD中数据不足和手工标注的问题。

Conclusion: CSRDA框架通过域适应方法提升了模型在真实场景中的性能，为解决数据不足问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few
datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain
specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently
populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of
limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets
compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To
tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely
Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the
model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic
camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be
utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework
(CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA
propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled
target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization.
Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of
pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an
evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the
problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD. Our code is publicly

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HQ-SMem通过结合SAM-HQ和智能内存机制，显著提升了视频对象分割的精度和效率，解决了现有模型在复杂场景下的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象分割（VOS）模型在精确掩码划分、变形对象处理、长时间视频序列等方面表现不佳，亟需改进。

Method: 1. 使用SAM-HQ和基于外观的候选选择优化掩码边界；2. 动态智能内存机制优化关键帧存储；3. 动态更新外观模型处理复杂对象变化。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优异，尤其在VOTS和VOTSt 2024中排名前二，并在长视频数据集上设定了新基准。

Conclusion: HQ-SMem通过创新方法显著提升了VOS模型的性能，适用于复杂场景和长时间视频。

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision
applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and
generative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with
precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming
objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce
HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a
novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing
these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i)
leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based
candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved
object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that
selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby
optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and
(iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex
topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These
contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including,
coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update
schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues
associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public
datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method
consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover,
HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its
effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object
dynamics over extended temporal durations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GSSR提出了一种新方法，通过均匀分布高斯分布并优化几何对齐，显著提高了3D高斯重建的几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯重建方法（如3DGS和PGSR）在几何重建上存在不足，高斯分布不均匀且偏离潜在表面，影响了重建和编辑效果。

Method: GSSR结合单视角和多视角一致性优化，引入不透明度正则化和周期性高斯重新初始化，以实现均匀分布和几何对齐。

Result: 实验表明，GSSR显著提升了高斯分布的几何精度，同时保持了高质量的渲染性能。

Conclusion: GSSR为高斯重建提供了更精确的几何表示，支持高效的场景编辑和新环境生成。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) effectively synthesizes novel views through its
flexible representation, yet fails to accurately reconstruct scene geometry.
While modern variants like PGSR introduce additional losses to ensure proper
depth and normal maps through Gaussian fusion, they still neglect individual
placement optimization. This results in unevenly distributed Gaussians that
deviate from the latent surface, complicating both reconstruction refinement
and scene editing. Motivated by pioneering work on Point Set Surfaces, we
propose Gaussian Set Surface Reconstruction (GSSR), a method designed to
distribute Gaussians evenly along the latent surface while aligning their
dominant normals with the surface normal. GSSR enforces fine-grained geometric
alignment through a combination of pixel-level and Gaussian-level single-view
normal consistency and multi-view photometric consistency, optimizing both
local and global perspectives. To further refine the representation, we
introduce an opacity regularization loss to eliminate redundant Gaussians and
apply periodic depth- and normal-guided Gaussian reinitialization for a
cleaner, more uniform spatial distribution. Our reconstruction results
demonstrate significantly improved geometric precision in Gaussian placement,
enabling intuitive scene editing and efficient generation of novel
Gaussian-based 3D environments. Extensive experiments validate GSSR's
effectiveness, showing enhanced geometric accuracy while preserving
high-quality rendering performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出WiSE-OD方法，通过权重空间集成提升红外图像目标检测的跨模态和抗干扰鲁棒性，并引入两个新的跨模态OOD基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决红外图像目标检测中因RGB预训练权重与红外数据模态差异导致的鲁棒性下降问题。

Method: 提出WiSE-OD方法，包括两种变体：WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$（结合RGB零样本和红外微调权重）和WiSE-OD$_{LP}$（结合零样本和线性探测）。

Result: WiSE-OD在不增加训练或推理成本的情况下，显著提升了跨模态和抗干扰鲁棒性。

Conclusion: WiSE-OD方法有效解决了红外目标检测中的模态差异问题，为跨模态鲁棒性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) in infrared (IR) imagery is critical for low-light and
nighttime applications. However, the scarcity of large-scale IR datasets forces
models to rely on weights pre-trained on RGB images. While fine-tuning on IR
improves accuracy, it often compromises robustness under distribution shifts
due to the inherent modality gap between RGB and IR. To address this, we
introduce LLVIP-C and FLIR-C, two cross-modality out-of-distribution (OOD)
benchmarks built by applying corruption to standard IR datasets. Additionally,
to fully leverage the complementary knowledge from RGB and infrared trained
models, we propose WiSE-OD, a weight-space ensembling method with two variants:
WiSE-OD$_{ZS}$, which combines RGB zero-shot and IR fine-tuned weights, and
WiSE-OD$_{LP}$, which blends zero-shot and linear probing. Evaluated across
three RGB-pretrained detectors and two robust baselines, WiSE-OD improves both
cross-modality and corruption robustness without any additional training or
inference cost.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多粒度层次融合变换器（MGHFT），通过多视角贴图解释器和对比学习，显著提升了贴图情感识别的准确性和细粒度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预训练视觉模型在贴图情感理解上表现不足，因其依赖多视角信息（如背景知识和风格线索）。

Method: 结合多模态大语言模型提供多视角文本描述，设计层次融合策略和文本引导注意力机制，融合文本与视觉特征。

Result: 在公开数据集上，MGHFT显著优于现有方法，F1和准确率分别提升5.4%和4.0%。

Conclusion: MGHFT通过多视角融合和文本引导，有效提升了贴图情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Although pre-trained visual models with text have demonstrated strong
capabilities in visual feature extraction, sticker emotion understanding
remains challenging due to its reliance on multi-view information, such as
background knowledge and stylistic cues. To address this, we propose a novel
multi-granularity hierarchical fusion transformer (MGHFT), with a multi-view
sticker interpreter based on Multimodal Large Language Models. Specifically,
inspired by the human ability to interpret sticker emotions from multiple
views, we first use Multimodal Large Language Models to interpret stickers by
providing rich textual context via multi-view descriptions. Then, we design a
hierarchical fusion strategy to fuse the textual context into visual
understanding, which builds upon a pyramid visual transformer to extract both
global and local sticker features at multiple stages. Through contrastive
learning and attention mechanisms, textual features are injected at different
stages of the visual backbone, enhancing the fusion of global- and
local-granularity visual semantics with textual guidance. Finally, we introduce
a text-guided fusion attention mechanism to effectively integrate the overall
multimodal features, enhancing semantic understanding. Extensive experiments on
2 public sticker emotion datasets demonstrate that MGHFT significantly
outperforms existing sticker emotion recognition approaches, achieving higher
accuracy and more fine-grained emotion recognition. Compared to the best
pre-trained visual models, our MGHFT also obtains an obvious improvement, 5.4%
on F1 and 4.0% on accuracy. The code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何从无结构的点云分布中提取有意义的结构信息并转换为语义上有意义的点分布的问题。

Method: 利用扩散模型的新架构和学习策略，通过去噪过程有效关联源分布和目标分布。

Result: 成功将输入点云转换为多种结构化输出，如表面对齐关键点、内部稀疏关节和连续特征线。

Conclusion: PDT能够捕捉几何和语义特征，为需要结构化点分布的各种3D几何处理任务提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Point-based representations have consistently played a vital role in
geometric data structures. Most point cloud learning and processing methods
typically leverage the unordered and unconstrained nature to represent the
underlying geometry of 3D shapes. However, how to extract meaningful structural
information from unstructured point cloud distributions and transform them into
semantically meaningful point distributions remains an under-explored problem.
We present PDT, a novel framework for point distribution transformation with
diffusion models. Given a set of input points, PDT learns to transform the
point set from its original geometric distribution into a target distribution
that is semantically meaningful. Our method utilizes diffusion models with
novel architecture and learning strategy, which effectively correlates the
source and the target distribution through a denoising process. Through
extensive experiments, we show that our method successfully transforms input
point clouds into various forms of structured outputs - ranging from
surface-aligned keypoints, and inner sparse joints to continuous feature lines.
The results showcase our framework's ability to capture both geometric and
semantic features, offering a powerful tool for various 3D geometry processing
tasks where structured point distributions are desired. Code will be available

Abstract: Given an object mask, Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (SVOS)
technique aims to track and segment the object across video frames, serving as
a fundamental task in computer vision. Although recent memory-based methods
demonstrate potential, they often struggle with scenes involving occlusion,
particularly in handling object interactions and high feature similarity. To
address these issues and meet the real-time processing requirements of
downstream applications, in this paper, we propose a novel bOundary Amendment
video object Segmentation method with Inherent Structure refinement, hereby
named OASIS. Specifically, a lightweight structure refinement module is
proposed to enhance segmentation accuracy. With the fusion of rough edge priors
captured by the Canny filter and stored object features, the module can
generate an object-level structure map and refine the representations by
highlighting boundary features. Evidential learning for uncertainty estimation
is introduced to further address challenges in occluded regions. The proposed
method, OASIS, maintains an efficient design, yet extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks demonstrate its superior performance and competitive
inference speed compared to other state-of-the-art methods, i.e., achieving the
F values of 91.6 (vs. 89.7 on DAVIS-17 validation set) and G values of 86.6
(vs. 86.2 on YouTubeVOS 2019 validation set) while maintaining a competitive

Abstract: Apical periodontitis is a prevalent oral pathology that presents significant
public health challenges. Despite advances in automated diagnostic systems
across various medical fields, the development of Computer-Aided Diagnosis
(CAD) applications for apical periodontitis is still constrained by the lack of
a large-scale, high-quality annotated dataset. To address this issue, we
release a large-scale panoramic radiograph benchmark called "PerioXrays",
comprising 3,673 images and 5,662 meticulously annotated instances of apical
periodontitis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first benchmark
dataset for automated apical periodontitis diagnosis. This paper further
proposes a clinical-oriented apical periodontitis detection (PerioDet)
paradigm, which jointly incorporates Background-Denoising Attention (BDA) and
IoU-Dynamic Calibration (IDC) mechanisms to address the challenges posed by
background noise and small targets in automated detection. Extensive
experiments on the PerioXrays dataset demonstrate the superiority of PerioDet
in advancing automated apical periodontitis detection. Additionally, a
well-designed human-computer collaborative experiment underscores the clinical
applicability of our method as an auxiliary diagnostic tool for professional
dentists.

Abstract: Accurate identification of vehicle attributes such as make, colour, and shape
is critical for law enforcement and intelligence applications. This study
evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image
dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained
conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI)
approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To
conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each
of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour.
The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to
1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by
varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%,
and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and
colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use
MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings
indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed
classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO
variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial
efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust
baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models
can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required
to search large vehicle images datasets.

Result: 在MixBench基准测试中，GR-CLIP的NDCG@10比CLIP提升26个百分点，优于其他模型且计算量更少。

Conclusion: GR-CLIP有效解决了模态间隙问题，显著提升了混合模态搜索性能。

Abstract: Mixed modality search -- retrieving information across a heterogeneous corpus
composed of images, texts, and multimodal documents -- is an important yet
underexplored real-world application. In this work, we investigate how
contrastive vision-language models, such as CLIP, perform on the mixed modality
search task. Our analysis reveals a critical limitation: these models exhibit a
pronounced modality gap in the embedding space, where image and text embeddings
form distinct clusters, leading to intra-modal ranking bias and inter-modal
fusion failure. To address this issue, we propose GR-CLIP, a lightweight
post-hoc calibration method that removes the modality gap in CLIP's embedding
space. Evaluated on MixBench -- the first benchmark specifically designed for
mixed modality search -- GR-CLIP improves NDCG@10 by up to 26 percentage points
over CLIP, surpasses recent vision-language generative embedding models by 4
percentage points, while using 75x less compute.

successful waste management, environmental monitoring, and mitigation
strategies. In this study, we investigated the performance of five cutting-edge

including YOLOv7, YOLOv8, YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and Faster Region-Convolutional
Neural Network (R-CNN), to identify which model was most effective at
recognizing materials in underwater situations. The models were thoroughly

under diverse conditions, such as low visibility and variable depths. From the
above-mentioned models, YOLOv8 outperformed the others, with a mean Average

Result: 在八种顶级潜在扩散模型上，AEDR比现有方法溯源准确性提高25.5%，计算时间仅需1%。

Conclusion: AEDR为生成模型提供了一种高效、准确的溯源解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of image-generation technologies has made it possible
for anyone to create photorealistic images using generative models, raising
significant security concerns. To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of
such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a
promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high
computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address
these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel
training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous
autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the
value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive
reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these
two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further
calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which
inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with
autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency.
Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5%

Abstract: Pre-trained point cloud analysis models have shown promising advancements in
various downstream tasks, yet their effectiveness is typically suffering from
low-quality point cloud (i.e., noise and incompleteness), which is a common
issue in real scenarios due to casual object occlusions and unsatisfactory data
collected by 3D sensors. To this end, existing methods focus on enhancing point
cloud quality by developing dedicated denoising and completion models. However,
due to the isolation between the point cloud enhancement and downstream tasks,
these methods fail to work in various real-world domains. In addition, the
conflicting objectives between denoising and completing tasks further limit the
ensemble paradigm to preserve critical geometric features. To tackle the above
challenges, we propose a unified point-level prompting method that reformulates
point cloud denoising and completion as a prompting mechanism, enabling robust
analysis in a parameter-efficient manner. We start by introducing a
Rectification Prompter to adapt to noisy points through the predicted
rectification vector prompts, effectively filtering noise while preserving
intricate geometric features essential for accurate analysis. Sequentially, we
further incorporate a Completion Prompter to generate auxiliary point prompts
based on the rectified point clouds, facilitating their robustness and
adaptability. Finally, a Shape-Aware Unit module is exploited to efficiently
unify and capture the filtered geometric features for the downstream point
cloud analysis.Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
superiority and robustness of our method when handling noisy and incomplete
point cloud data against existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
released at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/ICCV2025-UPP.

*Yongsong Huang,Tomo Miyazaki,Xiaofeng Liu,Shinichiro Omachi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出GPSMamba框架，结合自适应语义-频率状态空间模块和热谱注意力与相位一致性损失，解决红外图像超分辨率中因果建模的局限性，实现全局一致性和细节恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外图像超分辨率（IRSR）因低对比度和稀疏纹理而具有挑战性，需要长程建模以保持全局一致性，但现有方法（如Mamba）的1D因果扫描机制会破坏2D图像的全局上下文。

Method: 提出GPSMamba框架，包含自适应语义-频率状态空间模块（ASF-SSM）和热谱注意力与相位一致性损失，前者注入语义-频率提示以整合非局部上下文，后者提供非因果监督以增强全局结构。

Result: 实验表明GPSMamba在红外图像恢复任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: GPSMamba通过结合架构指导和非因果监督，为红外图像恢复提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: Infrared Image Super-Resolution (IRSR) is challenged by the low contrast and
sparse textures of infrared data, requiring robust long-range modeling to
maintain global coherence. While State-Space Models like Mamba offer
proficiency in modeling long-range dependencies for this task, their inherent
1D causal scanning mechanism fragments the global context of 2D images,
hindering fine-detail restoration. To address this, we propose Global Phase and
Spectral Prompt-guided Mamba (GPSMamba), a framework that synergizes
architectural guidance with non-causal supervision. First, our Adaptive
Semantic-Frequency State Space Module (ASF-SSM) injects a fused
semantic-frequency prompt directly into the Mamba block, integrating non-local
context to guide reconstruction. Then, a novel Thermal-Spectral Attention and
Phase Consistency Loss provides explicit, non-causal supervision to enforce
global structural and spectral fidelity. By combining these two innovations,
our work presents a systematic strategy to mitigate the limitations of causal
modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GPSMamba achieves
state-of-the-art performance, validating our approach as a powerful new
paradigm for infrared image restoration. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图像评估框架ICT和HP分数，解决了现有评估模型在细节和美学评分上的不足，显著提升了评分准确性和文本-图像对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成系统在保真度和美学质量上已超越基础文本-图像对齐，但评估框架未能同步发展，导致评分与人类偏好不一致。

Method: 设计了ICT分数评估文本-图像对齐程度，并基于图像模态训练HP分数模型以提升美学和细节质量。

Result: 实验表明，新模型评分准确性提升10%以上，并在优化文本-图像生成模型中取得显著效果。

Conclusion: 研究为图像生成技术向高阶人类美学偏好发展提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: Contemporary image generation systems have achieved high fidelity and
superior aesthetic quality beyond basic text-image alignment. However, existing
evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel. This study reveals
that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP
architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to
images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant
discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we
design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that
achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the
degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this
foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely
the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while
maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed
evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing
methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art
text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support
for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic
preferences. Code is available at https://github.com/BarretBa/ICTHP.

Abstract: Rapid advances in medical imaging technology underscore the critical need for
precise and automated image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure diagnostic
accuracy. Existing medical IQA methods, however, struggle to generalize across
diverse modalities and clinical scenarios. In response, we introduce MedIQA,
the first comprehensive foundation model for medical IQA, designed to handle
variability in image dimensions, modalities, anatomical regions, and types. We
developed a large-scale multi-modality dataset with plentiful manually
annotated quality scores to support this. Our model integrates a salient slice
assessment module to focus on diagnostically relevant regions feature retrieval
and employs an automatic prompt strategy that aligns upstream physical
parameter pre-training with downstream expert annotation fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MedIQA significantly outperforms baselines in
multiple downstream tasks, establishing a scalable framework for medical IQA
and advancing diagnostic workflows and clinical decision-making.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉和文本信息整合中表现强大，但存在幻觉问题，即生成内容与输入或常识不符。本文旨在系统梳理相关研究，推动问题解决。

Method: 提出幻觉的分类法，综述I2T和T2I任务的评估基准及构建方法，总结实例级幻觉检测技术。

Result: 现有基准和方法在幻觉评估和检测中取得进展，但仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 未来研究需改进基准和方法，以更有效解决MLLMs中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm
for integrating visual and textual information, supporting a wide range of
multi-modal tasks. However, these models often suffer from hallucination,
producing content that appears plausible but contradicts the input content or
established world knowledge. This survey offers an in-depth review of
hallucination evaluation benchmarks and detection methods across Image-to-Text
(I2T) and Text-to-image (T2I) generation tasks. Specifically, we first propose
a taxonomy of hallucination based on faithfulness and factuality, incorporating
the common types of hallucinations observed in practice. Then we provide an
overview of existing hallucination evaluation benchmarks for both T2I and I2T
tasks, highlighting their construction process, evaluation objectives, and
employed metrics. Furthermore, we summarize recent advances in hallucination
detection methods, which aims to identify hallucinated content at the instance
level and serve as a practical complement of benchmark-based evaluation.
Finally, we highlight key limitations in current benchmarks and detection
methods, and outline potential directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像描述评估缺乏标准化、偏见意识和用户偏好考量，LOTUS旨在填补这些空白。

Method: LOTUS通过多维度评估（如质量、风险、偏见）和用户偏好定制标准，分析大型视觉语言模型的表现。

Result: 研究发现没有模型在所有标准下表现最佳，且描述细节与偏见风险相关；用户偏好影响最优模型选择。

Conclusion: LOTUS为详细图像描述评估提供了全面框架，强调用户需求在模型选择中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have transformed image captioning,
shifting from concise captions to detailed descriptions. We introduce LOTUS, a
leaderboard for evaluating detailed captions, addressing three main gaps in
existing evaluations: lack of standardized criteria, bias-aware assessments,
and user preference considerations. LOTUS comprehensively evaluates various
aspects, including caption quality (e.g., alignment, descriptiveness), risks
(\eg, hallucination), and societal biases (e.g., gender bias) while enabling
preference-oriented evaluations by tailoring criteria to diverse user
preferences. Our analysis of recent LVLMs reveals no single model excels across
all criteria, while correlations emerge between caption detail and bias risks.
Preference-oriented evaluations demonstrate that optimal model selection
depends on user priorities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的单次联邦学习框架（OSFL），结合特征引导修正流模型（FG-RF）和双层知识蒸馏（DLKD），解决了医疗领域中的训练效率低、隐私泄露和非IID数据问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于生成模型的OSFL方法在医疗领域存在训练效率低、隐私泄露风险高，且难以在非IID数据下单轮收敛。

Method: 提出FG-RF模型加速生成特征级图像以保护隐私，并设计DLKD方法在聚合时对齐中间层特征和输出逻辑。

Result: 在三个非IID医疗数据集上，新框架性能优于多轮联邦学习方法（提升21.73%），且隐私泄露风险显著降低。

Conclusion: 新框架有效提升了训练效率和隐私保护能力，适用于医疗领域的非IID数据场景。

Abstract: In multi-center scenarios, One-Shot Federated Learning (OSFL) has attracted
increasing attention due to its low communication overhead, requiring only a
single round of transmission. However, existing generative model-based OSFL
methods suffer from low training efficiency and potential privacy leakage in
the healthcare domain. Additionally, achieving convergence within a single
round of model aggregation is challenging under non-Independent and Identically
Distributed (non-IID) data. To address these challenges, in this paper a
modified OSFL framework is proposed, in which a new Feature-Guided Rectified
Flow Model (FG-RF) and Dual-Layer Knowledge Distillation (DLKD) aggregation
method are developed. FG-RF on the client side accelerates generative modeling
in medical imaging scenarios while preserving privacy by synthesizing
feature-level images rather than pixel-level images. To handle non-IID
distributions, DLKD enables the global student model to simultaneously mimic
the output logits and align the intermediate-layer features of client-side
teacher models during aggregation. Experimental results on three non-IID
medical imaging datasets show that our new framework and method outperform
multi-round federated learning approaches, achieving up to 21.73% improvement,
and exceeds the baseline FedISCA by an average of 21.75%. Furthermore, our
experiments demonstrate that feature-level synthetic images significantly
reduce privacy leakage risks compared to pixel-level synthetic images.

TL;DR: 研究开发了基于X-CLIP和Whisper的脑编码模型，发现模型复杂度与泛化能力之间存在权衡，线性模型在OOD数据上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测大脑对多模态刺激的反应是计算神经科学的关键挑战，但现有模型在泛化到新情境时的能力尚未充分验证。

Method: 使用X-CLIP（视觉）和Whisper（听觉）特征提取器构建编码模型，并在ID和OOD数据上评估。

Result: 高容量注意力模型在ID数据上表现优异，但线性模型在OOD数据上更稳健，且语言特征未提升预测准确性。

Conclusion: 严格的OOD测试对构建稳健的神经AI模型至关重要，模型架构、刺激特性和感官层级共同影响多模态世界的神经编码。

Abstract: Predicting brain activity in response to naturalistic, multimodal stimuli is
a key challenge in computational neuroscience. While encoding models are
becoming more powerful, their ability to generalize to truly novel contexts
remains a critical, often untested, question. In this work, we developed brain
encoding models using state-of-the-art visual (X-CLIP) and auditory (Whisper)
feature extractors and rigorously evaluated them on both in-distribution (ID)
and diverse out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results reveal a fundamental
trade-off between model complexity and generalization: a higher-capacity
attention-based model excelled on ID data, but a simpler linear model was more
robust, outperforming a competitive baseline by 18\% on the OOD set.
Intriguingly, we found that linguistic features did not improve predictive
accuracy, suggesting that for familiar languages, neural encoding may be
dominated by the continuous visual and auditory streams over redundant textual
information. Spatially, our approach showed marked performance gains in the
auditory cortex, underscoring the benefit of high-fidelity speech
representations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that rigorous OOD
testing is essential for building robust neuro-AI models and provides nuanced
insights into how model architecture, stimulus characteristics, and sensory
hierarchies shape the neural encoding of our rich, multimodal world.

Result: 发现视觉定位对任务成功至关重要，任务效率普遍不足，需改进定位、规划和停止策略。

Conclusion: 模块化框架和跨平台能力是高效GUI自动化的关键，未来需优化任务效率。

Abstract: We introduce MMBench-GUI, a hierarchical benchmark for evaluating GUI
automation agents across Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
platforms. It comprises four levels: GUI Content Understanding, Element
Grounding, Task Automation, and Task Collaboration, covering essential skills
for GUI agents. In addition, we propose a novel Efficiency-Quality Area (EQA)
metric to assess GUI agent execution efficiency in online automation scenarios.
Through MMBench-GUI, we identify accurate visual grounding as a critical
determinant of overall task success, emphasizing the substantial benefits of
modular frameworks that integrate specialized grounding modules. Furthermore,
to achieve reliable GUI automation, an agent requires strong task planning and
cross-platform generalization abilities, with long-context memory, a broad
action space, and long-term reasoning playing a critical role. More important,
task efficiency remains a critically underexplored dimension, and all models
suffer from substantial inefficiencies, with excessive redundant steps even
when tasks are ultimately completed. The integration of precise localization,
effective planning, and early stopping strategies is indispensable to enable
truly efficient and scalable GUI automation. Our benchmark code, evaluation
data, and running environment will be publicly available at

Motivation: 现有方法在生成长范围3D视图序列时存在语义漂移问题，影响一致性和沉浸感。

Result: 实验表明，ScenePainter能有效克服语义漂移，生成更一致和沉浸的3D视图序列。

Conclusion: ScenePainter通过语义对齐和动态优化，提升了3D场景生成的连贯性和多样性。

Abstract: Perpetual 3D scene generation aims to produce long-range and coherent 3D view
sequences, which is applicable for long-term video synthesis and 3D scene
reconstruction. Existing methods follow a "navigate-and-imagine" fashion and
rely on outpainting for successive view expansion. However, the generated view
sequences suffer from semantic drift issue derived from the accumulated
deviation of the outpainting module. To tackle this challenge, we propose
ScenePainter, a new framework for semantically consistent 3D scene generation,
which aligns the outpainter's scene-specific prior with the comprehension of
the current scene. To be specific, we introduce a hierarchical graph structure
dubbed SceneConceptGraph to construct relations among multi-level scene
concepts, which directs the outpainter for consistent novel views and can be
dynamically refined to enhance diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our framework overcomes the semantic drift issue and generates more
consistent and immersive 3D view sequences. Project Page:

Motivation: Transformer-based检测器在小物体检测中仍面临特征金字塔网络（FPN）的噪声敏感性和标签分配策略中查询质量下降的问题。

Method: NRQO通过NT-FPN在特征融合中保留空间和语义信息完整性，PS-RPN通过位置和形状相似性生成高质量正查询。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，NRQO表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: NRQO为小物体检测提供了一种高效且无需额外超参数的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite advancements in Transformer-based detectors for small object
detection (SOD), recent studies show that these detectors still face challenges
due to inherent noise sensitivity in feature pyramid networks (FPN) and
diminished query quality in existing label assignment strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm,
which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network
(NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN).
Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving
spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment
strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive
queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape
similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of
NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 现实应用中需要模型识别虚假或不存在的内容，但现有VLMs因缺乏否定训练数据而表现不佳，传统数据密集型方法资源消耗大。

Method: 提出NEAT方法，通过调整推理时的分布相关参数，减少语义一致的分布偏移并消除无关语义的虚假一致性。

Result: 在多种否定理解任务上的实验验证了NEAT的有效性。

Conclusion: NEAT提供了一种低资源高效的解决方案，显著提升了VLMs的否定理解能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we study a practical but less-touched problem in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs), \ie, negation understanding. Specifically, many
real-world applications require models to explicitly identify what is false or
non-existent, \eg, radiologists may search for images that exclude specific
conditions. Despite the impressive transferability of VLMs through large-scale
training, they suffer from a critical limitation that fails to handle negation.
To address this challenge, existing methods attribute its root cause to the
scarcity of negation training data and propose to fine-tune VLMs on massive
data containing explicit negation. Undoubtedly, such data-centric solutions
demand substantial data and computational resources, limiting their sustainable
widespread adoption. To tackle negation in a low-carbon manner, we empirically
observe that the key obstacle lies in the dual-concept shifts between the
affirmation and negation distributions. Therefore, we propose a Negation-Aware
Test-Time Adaptation (NEAT) method to efficiently adjust distribution-related
parameters during inference. In brief, NEAT can reduce distribution shift in
consistent semantics while eliminating false distributional consistency in
unrelated semantics. Extensive experiments on the various negation
understanding tasks verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code
is available at https://github.com/hhc1997/NEAT.

Result: 在基准数据集上定性定量表现优于现有方法，且对新被试适应性强。

Conclusion: 双向交织框架有效提升跨被试图像解码的准确性和适应性。

Abstract: Decoding stimulus images from fMRI signals has advanced with pre-trained
generative models. However, existing methods struggle with cross-subject
mappings due to cognitive variability and subject-specific differences. This
challenge arises from sequential errors, where unidirectional mappings generate
partially inaccurate representations that, when fed into diffusion models,
accumulate errors and degrade reconstruction fidelity. To address this, we
propose the Bidirectional Autoencoder Intertwining framework for accurate
decoded representation prediction. Our approach unifies multiple subjects
through a Subject Bias Modulation Module while leveraging bidirectional mapping
to better capture data distributions for precise representation prediction. To
further enhance fidelity when decoding representations into stimulus images, we
introduce a Semantic Refinement Module to improve semantic representations and
a Visual Coherence Module to mitigate the effects of inaccurate visual
representations. Integrated with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on benchmark datasets in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Moreover, our framework exhibits
strong adaptability to new subjects with minimal training samples.

Abstract: Radiography imaging protocols target on specific anatomical regions,
resulting in highly consistent images with recurrent structural patterns across
patients. Recent advances in medical anomaly detection have demonstrated the
effectiveness of CNN- and transformer-based approaches. However, CNNs exhibit
limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer
from quadratic computational complexity. In contrast, Mamba-based models,
leveraging superior long-range modeling, structural feature extraction, and
linear computational efficiency, have emerged as a promising alternative. To
capitalize on the inherent structural regularity of medical images, this study
introduces SP-Mamba, a spatial-perception Mamba framework for unsupervised
medical anomaly detection. The window-sliding prototype learning and
Circular-Hilbert scanning-based Mamba are introduced to better exploit
consistent anatomical patterns and leverage spatial information for medical
anomaly detection. Furthermore, we excavate the concentration and contrast
characteristics of anomaly maps for improving anomaly detection. Extensive
experiments on three diverse medical anomaly detection benchmarks confirm the
proposed method's state-of-the-art performance, validating its efficacy and

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) for dense prediction has shown promising results
but still faces challenges in balancing shared representations with
task-specific specialization. In this paper, we introduce a novel Fine-Grained
Mixture of Experts (FGMoE) architecture that explores MoE-based MTL models
through a combination of three key innovations and fine-tuning. First, we
propose intra-task experts that partition along intermediate hidden dimensions
of MLPs, enabling finer decomposition of task information while maintaining
parameter efficiency. Second, we introduce shared experts that consolidate
common information across different contexts of the same task, reducing
redundancy, and allowing routing experts to focus on unique aspects. Third, we
design a global expert that facilitates adaptive knowledge transfer across
tasks based on both input feature and task requirements, promoting beneficial
information sharing while preventing harmful interference. In addition, we use
the fine-tuning approach to improve parameter efficiency only by training the
parameters of the decoder. Extensive experimental results show that the
proposed FGMoE uses fewer parameters and significantly outperforms current
MoE-based competitive MTL models on two dense prediction datasets
(\textit{i.e.,} NYUD-v2, PASCAL-Context) in various metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床高风险场景中，需要准确的预测和可靠的不确定性估计，现有判别模型难以满足需求。

Method: 基于Symmetrical Flow Matching构建生成-判别混合模型，引入语义掩码机制，利用生成采样过程估计不确定性。

Result: 在四个MedMNIST数据集上，分类准确率和AUC表现优于基线模型，不确定性估计可靠。

Conclusion: MedSymmFlow在医学图像分类和不确定性估计中表现优异，适用于临床高要求场景。

Abstract: Reliable medical image classification requires accurate predictions and
well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, especially in high-stakes clinical
settings. This work presents MedSymmFlow, a generative-discriminative hybrid
model built on Symmetrical Flow Matching, designed to unify classification,
generation, and uncertainty quantification in medical imaging. MedSymmFlow
leverages a latent-space formulation that scales to high-resolution inputs and
introduces a semantic mask conditioning mechanism to enhance diagnostic
relevance. Unlike standard discriminative models, it naturally estimates
uncertainty through its generative sampling process. The model is evaluated on
four MedMNIST datasets, covering a range of modalities and pathologies. The
results show that MedSymmFlow matches or exceeds the performance of established
baselines in classification accuracy and AUC, while also delivering reliable
uncertainty estimates validated by performance improvements under selective
prediction.

TL;DR: LISA是一种层次集成与抑制方法，通过分层调制和多层融合减少多模态大语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但容易产生物体幻觉，即描述图像中不存在的物体。

Method: LISA通过分层调制（抑制深层过激活）和基于锚的路由（融合选定层的token级logits）增强生成一致性。

Result: 实验表明，LISA在CHAIR_I上减少幻觉达53.6%，POPE F1提升4.5%，且具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LISA是一种即插即用的方法，能有效减少物体幻觉并提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language tasks such
as image captioning but remain prone to object hallucinations, where they
describe objects that do not appear in the image. To mitigate this, we propose
\textbf{LISA}, a \textbf{L}ayer-wise \textbf{I}ntegration and
\textbf{S}uppression \textbf{A}pproach that enhances generation consistency
through hierarchical modulation and multi-layer fusion. LISA leverages the
functional hierarchy within MLLMs, where shallow layers provide visual
grounding, middle layers encode semantics, and deep layers tend to amplify
spurious signals. First, zone-specific spectral modulation stabilizes attention
by suppressing over-amplified activations in deeper layers while preserving
alignment cues in earlier layers. Second, token-level logits from selected
layers are fused via anchor-based routing, with token-wise anchor selection and
soft logit fusion enabling adaptive integration during decoding. LISA is fully
\textbf{plug-and-play} and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLMs,
including Qwen2.5-VL. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that LISA reduces
hallucinations by up to 53.6\% in $\mathrm{CHAIR}_I$ and improves POPE F1 by
4.5\%, demonstrating strong generalization across models and tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在全连接层提取特征时难以有效捕捉跨模态相似性，导致匹配效果不佳。

Method: CSTF通过创建多区域对应的映射，并将相似性匹配重新定义为分类任务（使用SoftMax和FCN层），结合局部特征和全局上下文信息。

Result: 在HRSC2016和DOTA数据集上，CSTF分别达到90.99%和90.86%的平均mAP，推理速度为12.5 FPS。

Conclusion: CSTF显著提升了跨模态特征匹配性能，并直接增强了遥感应用（如目标检测）的效果。

Abstract: Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching
remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric
differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract
features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal
similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF)
mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant
keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our
approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating
correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions
simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as
a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN)
layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive
local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in
robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the
practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object
detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method
achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016
and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains
computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results
validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances
downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.

Motivation: 现有方法在建模人类运动动态和长时空依赖时存在不足，且时间表示缺乏与频域的交互。

Result: 在ETH-UCY、SDD、NBA和JRDB数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PatchTraj通过统一时域和频域表示，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving and
robotics. While existing point-based and grid-based methods expose two key
limitations: insufficiently modeling human motion dynamics, as they fail to
balance local motion details with long-range spatiotemporal dependencies, and
the time representation lacks interaction with the frequency domain in modeling
trajectory sequences. To address these challenges, we propose PatchTraj, a
dynamic patch-based trajectory prediction framework that unifies time-domain
and frequency-domain representations. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory
into raw time sequences and frequency components, employing dynamic patch
partitioning for multi-scale trajectory segmentation to capture hierarchical
motion patterns. Each patch is processed by an adaptive embedding layer with
scale-aware feature extraction, followed by hierarchical feature aggregation to
model both fine-grained and long-range dependencies. The outputs of two
branches interact via cross-modal attention, enabling complementary fusion of
temporal and spectral cues. Finally, a Transformer encoder-decoder integrates
both modalities to autoregressively predict future trajectories. Extensive
experiments on ETH-UCY, SDD, NBA, and JRDB datasets demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量和定性上均优于现有采样和恢复方法。

Conclusion: TopGeoFormer通过结合拓扑和几何属性，显著提升了点云恢复的效果。

Abstract: Recovering point clouds involves the sequential process of sampling and
restoration, yet existing methods struggle to effectively leverage both
topological and geometric attributes. To address this, we propose an end-to-end
architecture named \textbf{TopGeoFormer}, which maintains these critical
features throughout the sampling and restoration phases. First, we revisit
traditional feature extraction techniques to yield topological embedding using
a continuous mapping of relative relationships between neighboring points, and
integrate it in both phases for preserving the structure of the original space.
Second, we propose the \textbf{InterTwining Attention} to fully merge
topological and geometric embeddings, which queries shape with local awareness
in both phases to form a learnable shape context facilitated with point-wise,
point-shape-wise, and intra-shape features. Third, we introduce a full geometry
loss and a topological constraint loss to optimize the embeddings in both
Euclidean and topological spaces. The geometry loss uses inconsistent matching
between coarse-to-fine generations and targets for reconstructing better
geometric details, and the constraint loss limits embedding variances for
better approximation of the topological space. In experiments, we
comprehensively analyze the circumstances using the conventional and
learning-based sampling/upsampling algorithms. The quantitative and qualitative
results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing sampling
and recovery methods.

Method: 提出Two-Branch Swin Block，分离高低比特精度处理激活，兼容QAT和PTQ方法，并结合激活剪枝进一步优化。

Result: 在COCO数据集上，PTQ配置下实现1.35倍计算加速且无精度损失；QAT配置下实现1.25倍无损加速或1.53倍加速（仅1% mAP下降）。

Conclusion: MixA-Q通过稀疏感知量化适应显著减少量化误差，提升低比特模型的性能，为高效视觉Transformer量化提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose MixA-Q, a mixed-precision activation quantization
framework that leverages intra-layer activation sparsity (a concept widely
explored in activation pruning methods) for efficient inference of quantized
window-based vision transformers. For a given uniform-bit quantization
configuration, MixA-Q separates the batched window computations within Swin
blocks and assigns a lower bit width to the activations of less important
windows, improving the trade-off between model performance and efficiency. We
introduce a Two-Branch Swin Block that processes activations separately in
high- and low-bit precision, enabling seamless integration of our method with
most quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ)
methods, or with simple modifications. Our experimental evaluations over the
COCO dataset demonstrate that MixA-Q achieves a training-free 1.35x
computational speedup without accuracy loss in PTQ configuration. With QAT,
MixA-Q achieves a lossless 1.25x speedup and a 1.53x speedup with only a 1% mAP
drop by incorporating activation pruning. Notably, by reducing the quantization
error in important regions, our sparsity-aware quantization adaptation improves
the mAP of the quantized W4A4 model (with both weights and activations in 4-bit
precision) by 0.7%, reducing quantization degradation by 24%.

Result: 在PASCAL-5^i和COCO-20^i数据集上，PAHNet在1-shot和5-shot设置下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAHNet通过平衡保守与激进信息，有效提升了少样本分割的准确性。

Abstract: This paper studies the few-shot segmentation (FSS) task, which aims to
segment objects belonging to unseen categories in a query image by learning a
model on a small number of well-annotated support samples. Our analysis of two
mainstream FSS paradigms reveals that the predictions made by prototype
learning methods are usually conservative, while those of affinity learning
methods tend to be more aggressive. This observation motivates us to balance
the conservative and aggressive information captured by these two types of FSS
frameworks so as to improve the segmentation performance. To achieve this, we
propose a **P**rototype-**A**ffinity **H**ybrid **Net**work (PAHNet), which
introduces a Prototype-guided Feature Enhancement (PFE) module and an Attention
Score Calibration (ASC) module in each attention block of an affinity learning
model (called affinity learner). These two modules utilize the predictions
generated by a pre-trained prototype learning model (called prototype
predictor) to enhance the foreground information in support and query image
representations and suppress the mismatched foreground-background (FG-BG)
relationships between them, respectively. In this way, the aggressiveness of
the affinity learner can be effectively mitigated, thereby eventually
increasing the segmentation accuracy of our PAHNet method. Experimental results
show that PAHNet outperforms most recently proposed methods across 1-shot and
5-shot settings on both PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, suggesting its
effectiveness. The code is available at: [GitHub - tianyu-zou/PAHNet: Balancing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态场景重建是3D视觉中的长期挑战，现有方法因低秩假设导致特征重叠和渲染质量差，而4D哈希编码直接应用于整个动态场景会导致哈希冲突和冗余。

Method: DASH采用自监督分解机制分离动态和静态组件，引入多分辨率4D哈希编码器表示动态元素，并提出时空平滑正则化策略以减少不稳定变形。

Result: 实验表明，DASH在真实数据集上实现了最先进的动态渲染性能，视觉质量提升，单4090 GPU上实时速度达264 FPS。

Conclusion: DASH通过创新的4D哈希编码和自监督分解，有效解决了动态场景渲染中的关键问题，实现了高质量的实时渲染。

Abstract: Dynamic scene reconstruction is a long-term challenge in 3D vision. Existing
plane-based methods in dynamic Gaussian splatting suffer from an unsuitable
low-rank assumption, causing feature overlap and poor rendering quality.
Although 4D hash encoding provides an explicit representation without low-rank
constraints, directly applying it to the entire dynamic scene leads to
substantial hash collisions and redundancy. To address these challenges, we
present DASH, a real-time dynamic scene rendering framework that employs 4D
hash encoding coupled with self-supervised decomposition. Our approach begins
with a self-supervised decomposition mechanism that separates dynamic and
static components without manual annotations or precomputed masks. Next, we
introduce a multiresolution 4D hash encoder for dynamic elements, providing an
explicit representation that avoids the low-rank assumption. Finally, we
present a spatio-temporal smoothness regularization strategy to mitigate
unstable deformation artifacts. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate
that DASH achieves state-of-the-art dynamic rendering performance, exhibiting
enhanced visual quality at real-time speeds of 264 FPS on a single 4090 GPU.

Result: 该方法在训练和推理中均可应用，显著提高了吞吐量，同时保持了分类准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的补丁剪枝策略有效降低了计算复杂度，并通过重叠补丁嵌入进一步优化性能。

Abstract: Multi-head self-attention is a distinctive feature extraction mechanism of
vision transformers that computes pairwise relationships among all input
patches, contributing significantly to their high performance. However, it is
known to incur a quadratic computational complexity with respect to the number
of patches. One promising approach to address this issue is patch pruning,
which improves computational efficiency by identifying and removing redundant
patches. In this work, we propose a patch pruning strategy that evaluates the
importance of each patch based on the variance of attention weights across
multiple attention heads. This approach is inspired by the design of multi-head
self-attention, which aims to capture diverse attention patterns across
different subspaces of feature representations. The proposed method can be
easily applied during both training and inference, and achieves improved
throughput while maintaining classification accuracy in scenarios such as
fine-tuning with pre-trained models. In addition, we also found that using
robust statistical measures, such as the median absolute deviation in place of
variance, to assess patch importance can similarly lead to strong performance.
Furthermore, by introducing overlapping patch embeddings, our method achieves
better performance with comparable throughput to conventional approaches that
utilize all patches.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在多种天气条件下实现了高效且统一的图像修复，减少了对配对训练数据的依赖。

Abstract: Restoration of images contaminated by different adverse weather conditions
such as fog, snow, and rain is a challenging task due to the varying nature of
the weather conditions. Most of the existing methods focus on any one
particular weather conditions. However, for applications such as autonomous
driving, a unified model is necessary to perform restoration of corrupted
images due to different weather conditions. We propose a continual learning
approach to propose a unified framework for image restoration. The proposed
framework integrates three key innovations: (1) Selective Kernel Fusion layers
that dynamically combine global and local features for robust adaptive feature
selection; (2) Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) to enable continual learning
and mitigate catastrophic forgetting across multiple restoration tasks; and (3)
a novel Cycle-Contrastive Loss that enhances feature discrimination while
preserving semantic consistency during domain translation. Further, we propose
an unpaired image restoration approach to reduce the dependance of the proposed
approach on the training data. Extensive experiments on standard benchmark
datasets for dehazing, desnowing and deraining tasks demonstrate significant
improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality over the state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: VisHall3D为自动驾驶等应用提供了更准确可靠的场景理解方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisHall3D, a novel two-stage framework for monocular
semantic scene completion that aims to address the issues of feature
entanglement and geometric inconsistency prevalent in existing methods.
VisHall3D decomposes the scene completion task into two stages: reconstructing
the visible regions (vision) and inferring the invisible regions
(hallucination). In the first stage, VisFrontierNet, a visibility-aware
projection module, is introduced to accurately trace the visual frontier while
preserving fine-grained details. In the second stage, OcclusionMAE, a
hallucination network, is employed to generate plausible geometries for the
invisible regions using a noise injection mechanism. By decoupling scene
completion into these two distinct stages, VisHall3D effectively mitigates
feature entanglement and geometric inconsistency, leading to significantly
improved reconstruction quality.
  The effectiveness of VisHall3D is validated through extensive experiments on
two challenging benchmarks: SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI-360. VisHall3D
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a
significant margin and paves the way for more accurate and reliable scene
understanding in autonomous driving and other applications.

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，CounterNet将计数准确性提高了5%至20%，显著改善了查询结果的可靠性。

Conclusion: CounterNet通过改进计数准确性，为点云数据查询提供了更可靠的基础。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles generate massive volumes of point cloud data, yet only a
subset is relevant for specific tasks such as collision detection, traffic
analysis, or congestion monitoring. Effectively querying this data is essential
to enable targeted analytics. In this work, we formalize point cloud querying
by defining three core query types: RETRIEVAL, COUNT, and AGGREGATION, each
aligned with distinct analytical scenarios. All these queries rely heavily on
accurate object counts to produce meaningful results, making precise object
counting a critical component of query execution. Prior work has focused on
indexing techniques for 2D video data, assuming detection models provide
accurate counting information. However, when applied to 3D point cloud data,
state-of-the-art detection models often fail to generate reliable object
counts, leading to substantial errors in query results. To address this
limitation, we propose CounterNet, a heatmap-based network designed for
accurate object counting in large-scale point cloud data. Rather than focusing
on accurate object localization, CounterNet detects object presence by finding
object centers to improve counting accuracy. We further enhance its performance
with a feature map partitioning strategy using overlapping regions, enabling
better handling of both small and large objects in complex traffic scenes. To
adapt to varying frame characteristics, we introduce a per-frame dynamic model
selection strategy that selects the most effective configuration for each
input. Evaluations on three real-world autonomous vehicle datasets show that
CounterNet improves counting accuracy by 5% to 20% across object categories,
resulting in more reliable query outcomes across all supported query types.

Conclusion: SPA-ADV和PRE-MAP解决了现有模型的局限性，为个性化视觉注意力研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Visual selective attention, driven by individual preferences, regulates human
prioritization of visual stimuli by bridging subjective cognitive mechanisms
with objective visual elements, thereby steering the semantic interpretation
and hierarchical processing of dynamic visual scenes. However, existing models
and datasets predominantly neglect the influence of subjective cognitive
diversity on fixation behavior. Conventional saliency prediction models,
typically employing segmentation approaches, rely on low-resolution imagery to
generate saliency heatmaps, subsequently upscaled to native resolutions, which
limiting their capacity to capture personalized attention patterns.
Furthermore, MLLMs are constrained by factors such as hallucinations, making it
very costly to strictly adhere to the expected format in tasks involving
multiple point predictions, and achieving precise point positioning is
challenging. To address these limitations, we present Subjective Personalized
Attention for Advertisement Videos, namely SPA-ADV, a large-scale multimodal
dataset capturing gaze behaviors from over 4,500 participants varying in age
and gender with 486 videos. Furthermore, we propose PRE-MAP, a novel
eye-tracking saliency model that characterizes Personalized visual disparities
through Reinforcement learning-optimized Eye-tracking, built upon MLLMs and
guided by Multi-Attribute user profiles to predict Points. To ensure MLLMs
produce prediction points that are both format-correct and spatially accurate,
we introduce Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (C-GRPO), inspired
by the variability in eye movement points and Multi-Attribute profiles.
Extensive experiments on SPA-ADV and other benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. The code and dataset are available at

Abstract: In this work, we propose a framework that creates a lively virtual dynamic
scene with contextual motions of multiple humans. Generating multi-human
contextual motion requires holistic reasoning over dynamic relationships among
human-human and human-scene interactions. We adapt the power of a large
language model (LLM) to digest the contextual complexity within textual input
and convert the task into tangible subproblems such that we can generate
multi-agent behavior beyond the scale that was not considered before.
Specifically, our event generator formulates the temporal progression of a
dynamic scene into a sequence of small events. Each event calls for a
well-defined motion involving relevant characters and objects. Next, we
synthesize the motions of characters at positions sampled based on spatial
guidance. We employ a high-level module to deliver scalable yet comprehensive
context, translating events into relative descriptions that enable the
retrieval of precise coordinates. As the first to address this problem at scale
and with diversity, we offer a benchmark to assess diverse aspects of
contextual reasoning. Benchmark results and user studies show that our

*Jiaru Zhong,Jiahao Wang,Jiahui Xu,Xiaofan Li,Zaiqing Nie,Haibao Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoopTrack是一个端到端的实例级合作跟踪框架，通过稀疏实例级特征传输提升感知能力，同时保持低传输成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单帧感知任务的局限性，探索更具挑战性的合作序列感知任务，如合作3D多目标跟踪。

Method: 提出CoopTrack框架，包含多维度特征提取和跨代理关联与聚合两个关键组件。

Result: 在V2X-Seq和Griffin数据集上表现优异，达到39.0% mAP和32.8% AMOTA。

Conclusion: CoopTrack在合作3D多目标跟踪任务中实现了先进性能，为合作感知提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of
single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among
multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame
perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential
perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been
thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully
instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring
learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing
approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that
significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low
transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components:
Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and
Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation
with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and
fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin
datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance.
Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP
and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at

*An Xiang,Zixuan Huang,Xitong Gao,Kejiang Ye,Cheng-zhong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的多模态异常检测框架，解决了2D信息不足以检测3D深度异常的问题，并通过异常生成模拟真实异常样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中，仅用2D信息无法充分识别3D深度异常，且多模态信息差异导致现有方法难以有效融合。

Method: 从3D点云提取深度信息，与2D RGB图像分离表示；提出多尺度高斯异常生成器和统一纹理异常生成器；模块共享参数以桥接2D和3D检测。

Result: 在MVTec-3D AD和Eyecandies数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多模态异常检测中的信息融合问题，并通过异常生成提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection for 2D objects has gained significant attention
and achieved progress in anomaly detection (AD) methods. However, identifying
3D depth anomalies using only 2D information is insufficient. Despite
explicitly fusing depth information into RGB images or using point cloud
backbone networks to extract depth features, both approaches struggle to
adequately represent 3D information in multimodal scenarios due to the
disparities among different modal information. Additionally, due to the
scarcity of abnormal samples in industrial data, especially in multimodal
scenarios, it is necessary to perform anomaly generation to simulate real-world
abnormal samples. Therefore, we propose a novel unified multimodal anomaly
detection framework to address these issues. Our contributions consist of 3 key
aspects. (1) We extract visible depth information from 3D point cloud data
simply and use 2D RGB images to represent appearance, which disentangles depth
and appearance to support unified anomaly generation. (2) Benefiting from the
flexible input representation, the proposed Multi-Scale Gaussian Anomaly
Generator and Unified Texture Anomaly Generator can generate richer anomalies
in RGB and depth. (3) All modules share parameters for both RGB and depth data,
effectively bridging 2D and 3D anomaly detection. Subsequent modules can
directly leverage features from both modalities without complex fusion.
Experiments show our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) on MVTec-3D AD
and Eyecandies datasets. Code available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OV-Fact是一种新方法，用于评估长描述的事实性，无需依赖人工标注，结合开放词汇视觉定位和工具验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）在生成长且事实性强的描述时表现不佳，传统评估方法不适用于长描述或无人工标注的场景。

Method: 利用开放词汇视觉定位和工具验证，设计无参考的评估方法，同时衡量描述性（召回）和事实精确性。

Result: OV-Fact与人类判断更一致，且在数据过滤应用中，训练模型的事实性显著提升，同时保持描述性。

Conclusion: OV-Fact为长描述的事实性评估提供了新工具，并在数据过滤中表现出潜力。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate long and
factual captions. However, traditional measures for hallucination and
factuality are not well suited for evaluating longer, more diverse captions and
in settings where ground-truth human-annotated captions are unavailable. We
introduce OV-Fact, a novel method for measuring caption factuality of long
captions that leverages open-vocabulary visual grounding and tool-based
verification without depending on human annotations. Our method improves
agreement with human judgments and captures both caption descriptiveness
(recall) and factual precision in the same metric. Furthermore, unlike previous
metrics, our reference-free method design enables new applications towards
factuality-based data filtering. We observe models trained on an
OVFact-filtered (2.5-5x less) subset of a large-scale, noisy (VLM-generated)
pretraining set meaningfully improve factuality precision without sacrificing
caption descriptiveness across a range of downstream long caption benchmarks.

TL;DR: SimMLM是一个简单而强大的多模态学习框架，专注于处理缺失模态问题，通过动态混合模态专家（DMoME）架构和MoFe排序损失，显著提升准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂网络架构或数据填补技术，SimMLM旨在提供一种通用且高效的解决方案，适应不同缺失模态场景。

Method: 采用动态混合模态专家（DMoME）架构和MoFe排序损失，动态调整模态贡献并确保任务准确性随模态增加而提升。

Result: 在BraTS 2018和UPMC Food-101等任务中表现优异，准确性和鲁棒性均超越现有方法。

Conclusion: SimMLM在多模态学习中表现出色，尤其在缺失模态场景下具有显著优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for
multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that
rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation
techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to
various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness.
Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts
(DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that
automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial
modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer
(MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains
stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an
intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase
accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS
2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it
consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy,
interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing
modality scenarios at test time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法主要基于静态图像，忽略了视频中的时序信息，限制了特征的几何感知能力。

Method: 通过训练单图像编码器预测下一帧的特征表示，无需光流或跟踪，注入3D时空先验。

Result: 在单2小时视频预训练后，ADE20K的mIoU从35.0提升至36.4，且兼容图像处理流程。

Conclusion: 视频自蒸馏是一种轻量级方法，可增强几何感知能力，为物理AI提供基础。

Abstract: Self-supervised image encoders such as DINO have recently gained significant
interest for learning robust visual features without labels. However, most SSL
methods train on static images and miss the temporal cues inherent in videos.
We introduce a video-distilled single-image encoder trained to predict the
next-frame representation from the current frame. This simple objective injects
3D spatial and temporal priors without optical flow or tracking. When
pre-training on a single 2-hour video, our approach raises the mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU) on ADE20K from 35.0 (DoRA) to 36.4 while
remaining a drop-in replacement for image-only pipelines. Our results highlight
video self-distillation as a lightweight route to geometry-aware perception an
essential ingredient for physically plausible world models and Physical AI.

Result: 实验显示RemoteReasoner在多粒度推理任务中表现优异，并支持新颖任务如轮廓提取。

Conclusion: RemoteReasoner为遥感推理提供了灵活、自主的解决方案，超越现有方法。

Abstract: Remote sensing imagery presents vast, inherently unstructured spatial data,
demanding sophisticated reasoning to interpret complex user intents and
contextual relationships beyond simple recognition tasks. In this paper, we aim
to construct an Earth observation workflow to handle complex queries by
reasoning about spatial context and user intent. As a reasoning workflow, it
should be somewhat autonomous, where predefined ground-truth reasoning paths do
not constrain the learning process. Furthermore, its architecture ought to be
unified yet flexible, enabling the model to perform diverse reasoning tasks
with distinct output formats through a single forward pass. Existing remote
sensing approaches fail to address these requirements, as they rely on
supervised fine-tuning paradigms that constrain the autonomy of reasoning. To
this end, we propose RemoteReasoner, a flexible and robust workflow for remote
sensing reasoning tasks. The design of RemoteReasoner integrates a multi-modal
large language model (MLLM) for interpreting user instructions and localizing
targets, together with task adaptation strategies that enable multi-granularity
output generation. In contrast to existing methods, our framework is trained
with reinforcement learning (RL) to endow the MLLM sufficient autonomy for
precise reasoning. At the inference stage, our adaptation strategies enable
diverse output formats at inference time without requiring task-specific
decoders or further fine-tuning. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that
RemoteReasoner achieves remarkable performance across multi-granularity
reasoning tasks, including region-level and pixel-level. Additionally, our
framework enables novel capabilities such as the contour extraction task beyond
the reach of existing reasoning pipelines.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一共享提示，限制了交互的细致控制，导致交互过于简化，难以生成复杂的群体交互。

Method: PINO将群体交互分解为语义相关的成对交互，利用预训练的两人交互扩散模型逐步组合群体交互，并通过物理惩罚确保交互的物理合理性。

Result: PINO生成的交互在视觉上逼真、物理上连贯，且适用于动画、游戏和机器人等多种应用。

Conclusion: PINO提供了一种高效、灵活的方法，能够生成复杂且可控的群体交互，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Generating realistic group interactions involving multiple characters remains
challenging due to increasing complexity as group size expands. While existing
conditional diffusion models incrementally generate motions by conditioning on
previously generated characters, they rely on single shared prompts, limiting
nuanced control and leading to overly simplified interactions. In this paper,
we introduce Person-Interaction Noise Optimization (PINO), a novel,
training-free framework designed for generating realistic and customizable
interactions among groups of arbitrary size. PINO decomposes complex group
interactions into semantically relevant pairwise interactions, and leverages
pretrained two-person interaction diffusion models to incrementally compose
group interactions. To ensure physical plausibility and avoid common artifacts
such as overlapping or penetration between characters, PINO employs
physics-based penalties during noise optimization. This approach allows precise
user control over character orientation, speed, and spatial relationships
without additional training. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that PINO
generates visually realistic, physically coherent, and adaptable multi-person
interactions suitable for diverse animation, gaming, and robotics applications.

Motivation: 手动血细胞检测耗时、低效且易出错，深度学习目标检测可提供高效解决方案。

Method: 在YOLOX基础上引入CBAM模块增强特征提取，ASFF模块优化特征融合，并采用CIOU损失函数加速收敛。

Result: 在BCCD数据集上，ABCD方法达到95.49% mAP@0.5和86.89% mAP@0.5-0.9，分别比基线算法提高2.8%和23.41%，检测速度提升2.9%。

Conclusion: ABCD方法在血细胞检测中表现出高效性和实时性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Detection of blood cells in microscopic images has become a major focus of
medical image analysis, playing a crucial role in gaining valuable insights
into a patient's health. Manual blood cell checks for disease detection are
known to be time-consuming, inefficient, and error-prone. To address these
limitations, analyzing blood cells using deep learning-based object detectors
can be regarded as a feasible solution. In this study, we propose automatic
blood cell detection method (ABCD) based on an improved version of YOLOX, an
object detector, for detecting various types of blood cells, including white
blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Firstly, we introduce the
Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) into the network's backbone to
enhance the efficiency of feature extraction. Furthermore, we introduce the
Adaptively Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF) into the network's neck, which
optimizes the fusion of different features extracted from various stages of the
network. Finally, to speed up the model's convergence, we substitute the
Intersection over Union (IOU) loss function with the Complete Intersection over
Union (CIOU) loss function. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method is more effective than other existing methods for BCCD dataset.
Compared to the baseline algorithm, our method ABCD achieved 95.49 % mAP@0.5
and 86.89 % mAP@0.5-0.9, which are 2.8% and 23.41% higher, respectively, and
increased the detection speed by 2.9%, making it highly efficient for real-time
applications.

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中达到最新或高度竞争性结果，同时保持高效。

Conclusion: MuStD网络通过多模态特征融合显著提升了3D物体检测性能。

Abstract: Fusion of LiDAR and RGB data has the potential to enhance outdoor 3D object
detection accuracy. To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object
detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However,
effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task
still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream
Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information
from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its
LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input
while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An
additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV
mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing
comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused
and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection. Our extensive evaluation

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在高风险领域缺乏透明度，原型部分模型虽提供概念级解释，但现有方法要么限于细粒度任务，要么解释复杂。

Method: SIDE采用稀疏训练和剪枝方案，结合sigmoid激活函数，使每个类仅关联少量原型。

Result: SIDE在保持准确性的同时，将解释规模减少90%以上。

Conclusion: SIDE显著提升了原型解释的可理解性，适用于大规模数据集。

Abstract: Understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks is essential in
high-stakes domains such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Yet, these
models often lack transparency, particularly in computer vision.
Prototypical-parts-based neural networks have emerged as a promising solution
by offering concept-level explanations. However, most are limited to
fine-grained classification tasks, with few exceptions such as InfoDisent.
InfoDisent extends prototypical models to large-scale datasets like ImageNet,
but produces complex explanations.
  We introduce Sparse Information Disentanglement for Explainability (SIDE), a
novel method that improves the interpretability of prototypical parts through a
dedicated training and pruning scheme that enforces sparsity. Combined with
sigmoid activations in place of softmax, this approach allows SIDE to associate
each class with only a small set of relevant prototypes. Extensive experiments
show that SIDE matches the accuracy of existing methods while reducing
explanation size by over $90\%$, substantially enhancing the understandability
of prototype-based explanations.

Motivation: 解决V2V通信中传输原始点云或完整特征图导致的高延迟和可扩展性问题。

Method: 采用两阶段减少管道：选择性传输（ST）剪枝低效用区域，自适应网格减少（AGR）通过GNN分配车辆特定保留比例。特征融合使用软门控MoE注意力层。

Result: 在OPV2V基准测试中，EffiComm达到0.84 mAP@0.7，每帧仅传输约1.5 MB数据，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EffiComm展示了自适应学习通信在可扩展V2X感知中的价值。

Abstract: Collaborative perception allows connected vehicles to exchange sensor
information and overcome each vehicle's blind spots. Yet transmitting raw point
clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications,
causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end
framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while
maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on
Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage
reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions
with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural
Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and
network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and
specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark,
EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately
1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve.
These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for
scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.

Abstract: Creating a virtual avatar with semantically coherent gestures that are
aligned with speech is a challenging task. Existing gesture generation research
mainly focused on generating rhythmic beat gestures, neglecting the semantic
context of the gestures. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for
semantic grounding in co-speech gesture generation that integrates semantic
information at both fine-grained and global levels. Our approach starts with
learning the motion prior through a vector-quantized variational autoencoder.
Built on this model, a second-stage module is applied to automatically generate
gestures from speech, text-based semantics and speaker identity that ensures
consistency between the semantic relevance of generated gestures and
co-occurring speech semantics through semantic coherence and relevance modules.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enhances the realism and
coherence of semantic gestures. Extensive experiments and user studies show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across two benchmarks
in co-speech gesture generation in both objective and subjective metrics. The
qualitative results of our model, code, dataset and pre-trained models can be

Motivation: ViTs在计算机视觉中表现优异，但为适应不同资源限制需多次训练，耗时耗能。

Result: 在多个基准测试中验证了EA-ViT的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: EA-ViT提供了一种高效且灵活的ViT适应方案，适用于多样化部署场景。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a foundational model in computer
vision, excelling in generalization and adaptation to downstream tasks.
However, deploying ViTs to support diverse resource constraints typically
requires retraining multiple, size-specific ViTs, which is both time-consuming
and energy-intensive. To address this issue, we propose an efficient ViT
adaptation framework that enables a single adaptation process to generate
multiple models of varying sizes for deployment on platforms with various
resource constraints. Our approach comprises two stages. In the first stage, we
enhance a pre-trained ViT with a nested elastic architecture that enables
structural flexibility across MLP expansion ratio, number of attention heads,
embedding dimension, and network depth. To preserve pre-trained knowledge and
ensure stable adaptation, we adopt a curriculum-based training strategy that
progressively increases elasticity. In the second stage, we design a
lightweight router to select submodels according to computational budgets and
downstream task demands. Initialized with Pareto-optimal configurations derived
via a customized NSGA-II algorithm, the router is then jointly optimized with
the backbone. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and versatility of EA-ViT. The code is available at

Conclusion: BEV-LLM在场景描述任务中具有竞争力，新数据集填补了现有基准的不足。

Abstract: Autonomous driving technology has the potential to transform transportation,
but its wide adoption depends on the development of interpretable and
transparent decision-making systems. Scene captioning, which generates natural
language descriptions of the driving environment, plays a crucial role in
enhancing transparency, safety, and human-AI interaction. We introduce BEV-LLM,
a lightweight model for 3D captioning of autonomous driving scenes. BEV-LLM
leverages BEVFusion to combine 3D LiDAR point clouds and multi-view images,
incorporating a novel absolute positional encoding for view-specific scene
descriptions. Despite using a small 1B parameter base model, BEV-LLM achieves
competitive performance on the nuCaption dataset, surpassing state-of-the-art
by up to 5\% in BLEU scores. Additionally, we release two new datasets - nuView
(focused on environmental conditions and viewpoints) and GroundView (focused on
object grounding) - to better assess scene captioning across diverse driving
scenarios and address gaps in current benchmarks, along with initial
benchmarking results demonstrating their effectiveness.

Abstract: Chest radiography (CXR) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of various

findings presents a significant challenge for current self-supervised deep

Pre-training (CLIP) models effectively model the manifold distribution of the
latent space, enabling high zero-shot classification accuracies. Although CLIP
performs well on most of the primary classes in the dataset, our work reveals
that its effectiveness decreases significantly for classes with a long-tailed
distribution. Our approach employs a class-weighting mechanism that directly
aligns with the distribution of classes within the latent space. This method
ensures a substantial improvement in overall classification performance, with
particular emphasis on enhancing the recognition and accuracy of rarely
observed classes. We accomplish this by applying Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
clustering to the latent space. The subsequent clusters are further refined by
Student t-distribution, followed by a metric loss that utilizes the altered
embeddings. Our approach facilitates stable and adaptive clustering of the
features. This results in a notable average improvement of 7\% points in
zero-shot AUC scores across 40 classes in the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset from
previous SOTA models.

### [118] [Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19409)
*Toufiq Parag,Ahmed Elgammal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAELRE提出了一种统一的、高效的Transformer架构，用于跨多种模态的长范围编码，通过结合令牌合并和注意力近似，显著降低了计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有长上下文处理技术在单一设备上实现时的计算和内存开销问题，同时避免模态特定方法的局限性。

Method: MAELRE结合令牌合并和注意力近似，逐步在不同计算阶段合并令牌，并在令牌数量大时使用轻量级注意力近似，令牌减少时切换为标准点积注意力。

Result: MAELRE在多种模态的分类任务中表现出更高的准确性和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: MAELRE为长范围编码提供了一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于多种模态。

Abstract: The long-context capability of recent large transformer models can be
surmised to rely on techniques such as attention/model parallelism, as well as
hardware-level optimizations. While these strategies allow input lengths to
scale to millions of tokens, they do not fundamentally mitigate the quadratic
computational and memory complexity of the core attention mechanism. In this
paper, we address the challenge of long-context processing on a single device
using generic implementations by reducing the quadratic memory footprint and
inference cost. Existing approaches to extend the context length for generic
single device implementations -- such as token merging and modified attentions
-- are often modality specific and attain a suboptimal tradeoff between
accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose MAELRE
(Modality Agnostic Efficient Long Range Encoder), a unified and efficient
transformer architecture designed for long-range encoding across diverse
modalities. MAELRE integrates token merging with attention approximation,
progressively merging tokens at different stages of internal computational
blocks. It employs a lightweight attention approximation when the number of
tokens is large, and switches to standard dot-product attention as the sequence
becomes shorter through successive aggregation. We demonstrate that MAELRE
achieves superior accuracy while reducing computational cost compared to
existing long-context models on classification tasks spanning multiple
modalities, including text, time series, audio, and vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多任务的深度证据融合网络（DEFNet），通过结合场景和失真类型分类任务，优化盲图像质量评估（BIQA），并引入可信信息融合策略和不确定性估计技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BIQA方法因辅助任务集成不足和缺乏灵活的不确定性估计而性能受限，DEFNet旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 设计多任务优化框架，结合场景和失真类型分类任务，采用可信信息融合策略（局部-全局信息融合）和基于证据学习的不确定性估计技术。

Result: 在合成和真实失真数据集上的实验表明，DEFNet具有高效性、鲁棒性，并展现出强大的泛化能力和适应性。

Conclusion: DEFNet通过多任务优化和不确定性估计，显著提升了BIQA的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Blind image quality assessment (BIQA) methods often incorporate auxiliary
tasks to improve performance. However, existing approaches face limitations due
to insufficient integration and a lack of flexible uncertainty estimation,
leading to suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose a
multitasks-based Deep Evidential Fusion Network (DEFNet) for BIQA, which
performs multitask optimization with the assistance of scene and distortion
type classification tasks. To achieve a more robust and reliable
representation, we design a novel trustworthy information fusion strategy. It
first combines diverse features and patterns across sub-regions to enhance
information richness, and then performs local-global information fusion by
balancing fine-grained details with coarse-grained context. Moreover, DEFNet
exploits advanced uncertainty estimation technique inspired by evidential
learning with the help of normal-inverse gamma distribution mixture. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and authentic distortion datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework. Additional evaluation
and analysis are carried out to highlight its strong generalization capability
and adaptability to previously unseen scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LVLMs的语言和图像理解机制已被广泛研究，但其时空理解的内部推理机制仍不清楚。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一个包含视觉审计电路、语义追踪电路和注意力流电路的系统框架，用于分析LVLMs中的时空语义处理。

Result: 发现视觉语义集中在特定对象标记上，移除这些标记会导致模型性能下降高达92.6%；同时，对象和动作的可解释概念在模型中后期层逐步细化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLMs中时空语义的功能定位机制，为设计更鲁棒和可解释的模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The processing mechanisms underlying language and image understanding in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) have been extensively studied. However,
the internal reasoning mechanisms of LVLMs for spatiotemporal understanding
remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a systematic,
circuit-based framework designed to investigate how spatiotemporal visual
semantics are represented and processed within these LVLMs. Specifically, our
framework comprises three circuits: visual auditing circuit, semantic tracing
circuit, and attention flow circuit. Through the lens of these circuits, we
discover that visual semantics are highly localized to specific object
tokens--removing these tokens can degrade model performance by up to 92.6%.
Furthermore, we identify that interpretable concepts of objects and actions
emerge and become progressively refined in the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs.
In contrary to the current works that solely focus on objects in one image, we
reveal that the middle-to-late layers of LVLMs exhibit specialized functional
localization for spatiotemporal semantics. Our findings offer significant
mechanistic insights into spatiotemporal semantics analysis of LVLMs, laying a
foundation for designing more robust and interpretable models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GS-Occ3D提出了一种基于视觉的可扩展框架，用于直接重建占用空间，解决了现有方法依赖LiDAR标注的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖LiDAR标注，限制了可扩展性和利用众包数据进行自动标注的潜力。

Method: GS-Occ3D采用Octree-based Gaussian Surfel表示法优化显式占用表示，并将场景分解为静态背景、地面和动态物体进行建模。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上，GS-Occ3D实现了最先进的几何重建效果，并在Occ3D-Waymo和Occ3D-nuScenes上展示了卓越的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: GS-Occ3D展示了大规模基于视觉的占用空间重建作为自动驾驶感知新范式的潜力。

Abstract: Occupancy is crucial for autonomous driving, providing essential geometric
priors for perception and planning. However, existing methods predominantly
rely on LiDAR-based occupancy annotations, which limits scalability and
prevents leveraging vast amounts of potential crowdsourced data for
auto-labeling. To address this, we propose GS-Occ3D, a scalable vision-only
framework that directly reconstructs occupancy. Vision-only occupancy
reconstruction poses significant challenges due to sparse viewpoints, dynamic
scene elements, severe occlusions, and long-horizon motion. Existing
vision-based methods primarily rely on mesh representation, which suffer from
incomplete geometry and additional post-processing, limiting scalability. To
overcome these issues, GS-Occ3D optimizes an explicit occupancy representation
using an Octree-based Gaussian Surfel formulation, ensuring efficiency and
scalability. Additionally, we decompose scenes into static background, ground,
and dynamic objects, enabling tailored modeling strategies: (1) Ground is
explicitly reconstructed as a dominant structural element, significantly
improving large-area consistency; (2) Dynamic vehicles are separately modeled
to better capture motion-related occupancy patterns. Extensive experiments on
the Waymo dataset demonstrate that GS-Occ3D achieves state-of-the-art geometry
reconstruction results. By curating vision-only binary occupancy labels from
diverse urban scenes, we show their effectiveness for downstream occupancy
models on Occ3D-Waymo and superior zero-shot generalization on Occ3D-nuScenes.
It highlights the potential of large-scale vision-based occupancy
reconstruction as a new paradigm for autonomous driving perception. Project

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CNN的3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）初始化方法，解决了传统方法需要精确姿态和高计算成本的问题，适用于空间应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NeRF和3DGS方法需要精确姿态且计算成本高，限制了其在空间应用中的使用。

Method: 使用CNN从单目图像生成粗略3D模型和姿态估计，用于初始化3DGS，减少训练迭代和输入图像需求。

Result: 实验表明，即使姿态估计不精确，也能学习高保真3D模型，显著降低训练成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为空间应用中的新视角合成提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of novel view synthesis techniques such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) has enabled learning precise 3D models only from posed
monocular images. Although these methods are attractive, they hold two major
limitations that prevent their use in space applications: they require poses
during training, and have high computational cost at training and inference. To
address these limitations, this work contributes: (1) a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) based primitive initializer for 3DGS using monocular images; (2)
a pipeline capable of training with noisy or implicit pose estimates; and (3)
and analysis of initialization variants that reduce the training cost of
precise 3D models. A CNN takes a single image as input and outputs a coarse 3D
model represented as an assembly of primitives, along with the target's pose
relative to the camera. This assembly of primitives is then used to initialize
3DGS, significantly reducing the number of training iterations and input images
needed -- by at least an order of magnitude. For additional flexibility, the
CNN component has multiple variants with different pose estimation techniques.
This work performs a comparison between these variants, evaluating their
effectiveness for downstream 3DGS training under noisy or implicit pose
estimates. The results demonstrate that even with imperfect pose supervision,
the pipeline is able to learn high-fidelity 3D representations, opening the
door for the use of novel view synthesis in space applications.

scenes, from driving and indoor scenes to simulated environments. We show that
DINO-world outperforms previous models on a variety of video prediction
benchmarks, e.g. segmentation and depth forecasting, and demonstrates strong
understanding of intuitive physics. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to
fine-tune the predictor on observation-action trajectories. The resulting
action-conditioned world model can be used for planning by simulating candidate
trajectories in latent space.

higher processing speed, making it well-suited for real-time applications on

Conclusion: 该方法为灵活且富有表现力的3D虚拟形象生成提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present a universal prior model for 3D head avatars with explicit hair
compositionality. Existing approaches to build generalizable priors for 3D head
avatars often adopt a holistic modeling approach, treating the face and hair as
an inseparable entity. This overlooks the inherent compositionality of the
human head, making it difficult for the model to naturally disentangle face and
hair representations, especially when the dataset is limited. Furthermore, such
holistic models struggle to support applications like 3D face and hairstyle
swapping in a flexible and controllable manner. To address these challenges, we
introduce a prior model that explicitly accounts for the compositionality of
face and hair, learning their latent spaces separately. A key enabler of this
approach is our synthetic hairless data creation pipeline, which removes hair
from studio-captured datasets using estimated hairless geometry and texture
derived from a diffusion prior. By leveraging a paired dataset of hair and
hairless captures, we train disentangled prior models for face and hair,
incorporating compositionality as an inductive bias to facilitate effective
separation. Our model's inherent compositionality enables seamless transfer of
face and hair components between avatars while preserving identity.
Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can be fine-tuned in a few-shot
manner using monocular captures to create high-fidelity, hair-compositional 3D
head avatars for unseen subjects. These capabilities highlight the practical
applicability of our approach in real-world scenarios, paving the way for
flexible and expressive 3D avatar generation.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了与大型语言模型（LLM）互动如何影响合作行为，发现尽管与人类相比合作率低10-15%，但LLM仍能促进较高合作率，尤其在沟通条件下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在商业环境中替代人类互动时对合作行为的影响，验证其在促进合作方面的潜力。

Method: 通过囚徒困境实验（重复和单次游戏），比较参与者与人类、经典机器人和LLM的合作行为。

Result: LLM的合作率低于人类但较高，沟通显著提升合作率（88%），且人类互动后对LLM的合作行为有溢出效应。

Conclusion: LLM在商业合作场景中具有应用潜力，但需谨慎使用。

Abstract: Machines driven by large language models (LLMs) have the potential to augment
humans across various tasks, a development with profound implications for
business settings where effective communication, collaboration, and stakeholder
trust are paramount. To explore how interacting with an LLM instead of a human
might shift cooperative behavior in such settings, we used the Prisoner's
Dilemma game -- a surrogate of several real-world managerial and economic
scenarios. In Experiment 1 (N=100), participants engaged in a thirty-round
repeated game against a human, a classic bot, and an LLM (GPT, in real-time).
In Experiment 2 (N=192), participants played a one-shot game against a human or
an LLM, with half of them allowed to communicate with their opponent, enabling
LLMs to leverage a key advantage over older-generation machines. Cooperation
rates with LLMs -- while lower by approximately 10-15 percentage points
compared to interactions with human opponents -- were nonetheless high. This
finding was particularly notable in Experiment 2, where the psychological cost
of selfish behavior was reduced. Although allowing communication about
cooperation did not close the human-machine behavioral gap, it increased the
likelihood of cooperation with both humans and LLMs equally (by 88%), which is
particularly surprising for LLMs given their non-human nature and the
assumption that people might be less receptive to cooperating with machines
compared to human counterparts. Additionally, cooperation with LLMs was higher
following prior interaction with humans, suggesting a spillover effect in
cooperative behavior. Our findings validate the (careful) use of LLMs by
businesses in settings that have a cooperative component.

Motivation: 传统线性格式（如PDF和HTML）容易导致认知过载，且难以快速定位关键信息。现有LLM摘要工具缺乏对论文结构的理解，且可能生成不可靠信息。

Method: TreeReader将论文分解为交互式树状结构，每部分由LLM生成摘要，细节按需展开，支持用户选择性探索和验证。

Result: 用户研究表明，TreeReader显著提升了阅读效率和理解能力。

Conclusion: TreeReader通过分层摘要与交互式探索的结合，为复杂学术文献的阅读提供了更高效的方式。

Abstract: Efficiently navigating and understanding academic papers is crucial for
scientific progress. Traditional linear formats like PDF and HTML can cause
cognitive overload and obscure a paper's hierarchical structure, making it
difficult to locate key information. While LLM-based chatbots offer
summarization, they often lack nuanced understanding of specific sections, may
produce unreliable information, and typically discard the document's
navigational structure. Drawing insights from a formative study on academic
reading practices, we introduce TreeReader, a novel language model-augmented
paper reader. TreeReader decomposes papers into an interactive tree structure
where each section is initially represented by an LLM-generated concise
summary, with underlying details accessible on demand. This design allows users
to quickly grasp core ideas, selectively explore sections of interest, and
verify summaries against the source text. A user study was conducted to
evaluate TreeReader's impact on reading efficiency and comprehension.
TreeReader provides a more focused and efficient way to navigate and understand
complex academic literature by bridging hierarchical summarization with
interactive exploration.

Conclusion: 人类在区分AI生成图像方面存在挑战，需透明化工具（如水印和AI检测工具）以减少误导风险。

Abstract: As AI-powered image generation improves, a key question is how well human
beings can differentiate between "real" and AI-generated or modified images.
Using data collected from the online game "Real or Not Quiz.", this study
investigates how effectively people can distinguish AI-generated images from
real ones. Participants viewed a randomized set of real and AI-generated
images, aiming to identify their authenticity. Analysis of approximately
287,000 image evaluations by over 12,500 global participants revealed an
overall success rate of only 62\%, indicating a modest ability, slightly above
chance. Participants were most accurate with human portraits but struggled
significantly with natural and urban landscapes. These results highlight the
inherent challenge humans face in distinguishing AI-generated visual content,
particularly images without obvious artifacts or stylistic cues. This study
stresses the need for transparency tools, such as watermarks and robust AI
detection tools to mitigate the risks of misinformation arising from

Result: PurpCode-32B在网络安全方面表现最优，同时减少过度拒绝率，保持代码生成和通用安全知识的实用性。

Conclusion: PurpCode是一种有效的后训练方法，显著提升模型的安全性和实用性。

Abstract: We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code
reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious
cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule
Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to
generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious
cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety
and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms.
To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we
conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage
prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the
model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely
PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming
various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model
overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while
preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.

Result: 视觉语言模型能够以足够通用的方式处理多模态信息，适用于自主社交机器人。

Conclusion: 论文指出了技术挑战和评估方法，为未来多模态社交机器人的发展提供了方向。

Abstract: Large language models have given social robots the ability to autonomously
engage in open-domain conversations. However, they are still missing a
fundamental social skill: making use of the multiple modalities that carry
social interactions. While previous work has focused on task-oriented
interactions that require referencing the environment or specific phenomena in
social interactions such as dialogue breakdowns, we outline the overall needs
of a multimodal system for social conversations with robots. We then argue that
vision-language models are able to process this wide range of visual
information in a sufficiently general manner for autonomous social robots. We
describe how to adapt them to this setting, which technical challenges remain,
and briefly discuss evaluation practices.

Motivation: 复杂动态环境中，机器人系统需要处理环境变化，但现有算法无法有效预测动态特征的未来状态。

Conclusion: Perpetua是一种高效、可扩展且通用的方法，适用于动态环境中的特征状态估计和预测。

Abstract: Many robotic systems require extended deployments in complex, dynamic
environments. In such deployments, parts of the environment may change between
subsequent robot observations. Most robotic mapping or environment modeling
algorithms are incapable of representing dynamic features in a way that enables
predicting their future state. Instead, they opt to filter certain state
observations, either by removing them or some form of weighted averaging. This
paper introduces Perpetua, a method for modeling the dynamics of semi-static
features. Perpetua is able to: incorporate prior knowledge about the dynamics
of the feature if it exists, track multiple hypotheses, and adapt over time to
enable predicting of future feature states. Specifically, we chain together
mixtures of "persistence" and "emergence" filters to model the probability that
features will disappear or reappear in a formal Bayesian framework. The
approach is an efficient, scalable, general, and robust method for estimating
the states of features in an environment, both in the present as well as at
arbitrary future times. Through experiments on simulated and real-world data,
we find that Perpetua yields better accuracy than similar approaches while also
being online adaptable and robust to missing observations.

*Hengran Zhang,Keping Bi,Jiafeng Guo,Jiaming Zhang,Shuaiqiang Wang,Dawei Yin,Xueqi Cheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种将大语言模型（LLM）的效用判断能力蒸馏到更小模型的方法，以降低检索增强生成（RAG）的计算成本，同时提升答案质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准检索方法注重相关性，但RAG更关注检索内容的效用。由于LLM的效用判断计算成本高，限制了复杂查询的处理能力，因此需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 通过蒸馏LLM的效用判断能力到小模型，采用动态段落选择和伪答案生成技术，训练学生模型（如RankQwen1.7B和UtilityQwen1.7B）。

Result: 实验表明，基于效用的选择比相关性排序更有效，显著降低了计算成本并提升了答案质量。

Conclusion: 效用选择为RAG提供了灵活且经济的解决方案，特别适用于复杂问题。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating retrieved information. Standard retrieval process prioritized
relevance, focusing on topical alignment between queries and passages. In
contrast, in RAG, the emphasis has shifted to utility, which considers the
usefulness of passages for generating accurate answers. Despite empirical
evidence showing the benefits of utility-based retrieval in RAG, the high
computational cost of using LLMs for utility judgments limits the number of
passages evaluated. This restriction is problematic for complex queries
requiring extensive information. To address this, we propose a method to
distill the utility judgment capabilities of LLMs into smaller, more efficient
models. Our approach focuses on utility-based selection rather than ranking,
enabling dynamic passage selection tailored to specific queries without the
need for fixed thresholds. We train student models to learn pseudo-answer
generation and utility judgments from teacher LLMs, using a sliding window
method that dynamically selects useful passages. Our experiments demonstrate
that utility-based selection provides a flexible and cost-effective solution
for RAG, significantly reducing computational costs while improving answer
quality. We present the distillation results using Qwen3-32B as the teacher
model for both relevance ranking and utility-based selection, distilled into
RankQwen1.7B and UtilityQwen1.7B. Our findings indicate that for complex
questions, utility-based selection is more effective than relevance ranking in
enhancing answer generation performance. We will release the relevance ranking
and utility-based selection annotations for the MS MARCO dataset, supporting
further research in this area.

*Minghao Tang,Shiyu Ni,Jiafeng Guo,Keping Bi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Passage Injection的方法，通过将检索到的段落显式融入大语言模型（LLM）的推理过程，提升其对低质量检索段落的鲁棒性，从而增强检索增强生成（RAG）系统的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在检索增强生成（RAG）系统中，低质量（噪声）检索段落会降低其效果。因此，提升LLM对噪声的鲁棒性是关键。

Method: 提出Passage Injection方法，将检索到的段落显式融入LLM的推理过程，帮助模型识别和抵抗噪声段落。实验使用BM25检索器，在四个事实QA数据集上验证。

Result: 实验表明，Passage Injection显著提升了RAG的整体性能，并在随机噪声和反事实噪声设置下均提高了鲁棒性。同时，该方法也能有效利用有帮助的段落。

Conclusion: 将检索段落融入LLM的推理过程是构建更鲁棒RAG系统的有效方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to augment large
language models (LLMs) with external knowledge for knowledge-intensive tasks.
However, its effectiveness is often undermined by the presence of noisy (i.e.,
low-quality) retrieved passages. Enhancing LLMs' robustness to such noise is
critical for improving the reliability of RAG systems. Recent advances have
equipped LLMs with strong reasoning and self-reflection capabilities, allowing
them to identify and correct errors in their reasoning process. Inspired by
this ability, we propose Passage Injection-a simple yet effective method that
explicitly incorporates retrieved passages into LLMs' reasoning process, aiming
to enhance the model's ability to recognize and resist noisy passages. We
validate Passage Injection under general RAG settings using BM25 as the
retriever. Experiments on four reasoning-enhanced LLMs across four factual QA
datasets demonstrate that Passage Injection significantly improves overall RAG
performance. Further analysis on two noisy retrieval settings-random noise,
where the model is provided irrelevant passages, and counterfactual noise,
where it is given misleading passages-shows that Passage Injection consistently
improves robustness. Controlled experiments confirm that Passage Injection can
also effectively leverage helpful passages. These findings suggest that
incorporating passages in LLMs' reasoning process is a promising direction for
building more robust RAG systems. The code can be found

Result: 证明了NLL训练是一种隐式的谱对比学习，并揭示了模型表示空间与预测相似算子的特征谱对齐。

Conclusion: NLL目标通过隐式几何结构学习，为现代语言模型的有效性提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Auto-regressive language models factorize sequence probabilities and are
trained by minimizing the negative log-likelihood (NLL) objective. While
empirically powerful, a deep theoretical understanding of why this simple
objective yields such versatile representations remains elusive. This work
introduces a unifying analytical framework using Markov Categories (MCs) to
deconstruct the AR generation process and the NLL objective. We model the
single-step generation map as a composition of Markov kernels in the category
Stoch. This compositional view, when enriched with statistical divergences,
allows us to dissect information flow and learned geometry. Our framework makes
three main contributions. First, we provide a formal, information-theoretic
rationale for the success of modern speculative decoding methods like EAGLE,
quantifying the information surplus in hidden states that these methods
exploit. Second, we formalize how NLL minimization forces the model to learn
not just the next token, but the data's intrinsic conditional stochasticity, a
process we analyze using categorical entropy. Third, and most centrally, we
prove that NLL training acts as an implicit form of spectral contrastive
learning. By analyzing the information geometry of the model's prediction head,
we show that NLL implicitly forces the learned representation space to align
with the eigenspectrum of a predictive similarity operator, thereby learning a
geometrically structured space without explicit contrastive pairs. This
compositional and information-geometric perspective reveals the deep structural
principles underlying the effectiveness of modern LMs. Project Page:

Conclusion: 本文为接近超级预测级AI技术提供了具体路径和考虑因素，旨在呼吁研究者关注这些方向。

Abstract: Many recent papers have studied the development of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. While methodological problems with early studies cast
doubt on the use of LLMs for event forecasting, recent studies with improved
evaluation methods have shown that state-of-the-art LLMs are gradually reaching
superforecaster-level performance, and reinforcement learning has also been
reported to improve future forecasting. Additionally, the unprecedented success
of recent reasoning models and Deep Research-style models suggests that
technology capable of greatly improving forecasting performance has been
developed. Therefore, based on these positive recent trends, we argue that the
time is ripe for research on large-scale training of superforecaster-level
event forecasting LLMs. We discuss two key research directions: training
methods and data acquisition. For training, we first introduce three
difficulties of LLM-based event forecasting training: noisiness-sparsity,
knowledge cut-off, and simple reward structure problems. Then, we present
related ideas to mitigate these problems: hypothetical event Bayesian networks,
utilizing poorly-recalled and counterfactual events, and auxiliary reward
signals. For data, we propose aggressive use of market, public, and crawling
datasets to enable large-scale training and evaluation. Finally, we explain how
these technical advances could enable AI to provide predictive intelligence to
society in broader areas. This position paper presents promising specific paths
and considerations for getting closer to superforecaster-level AI technology,
aiming to call for researchers' interest in these directions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的分段引导框架，用于解决逆问题，平衡计算效率与精度，适用于多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在高维分布采样中表现优异，但现有方法在解决逆问题时需针对特定任务重新训练，缺乏通用性。

Method: 采用分段引导机制，根据扩散时间步定义引导项，区分高噪声和低噪声阶段的不同近似方法。

Result: 在图像修复任务中，推理时间显著减少（25%至24%），PSNR和SSIM损失可忽略。

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性、高效性，并能显式处理测量噪声，适用于多种逆问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful tools for sampling from high-dimensional
distributions by progressively transforming pure noise into structured data
through a denoising process. When equipped with a guidance mechanism, these
models can also generate samples from conditional distributions. In this paper,
a novel diffusion-based framework is introduced for solving inverse problems
using a piecewise guidance scheme. The guidance term is defined as a piecewise
function of the diffusion timestep, facilitating the use of different
approximations during high-noise and low-noise phases. This design is shown to
effectively balance computational efficiency with the accuracy of the guidance
term. Unlike task-specific approaches that require retraining for each problem,
the proposed method is problem-agnostic and readily adaptable to a variety of
inverse problems. Additionally, it explicitly incorporates measurement noise
into the reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is
demonstrated through extensive experiments on image restoration tasks,
specifically image inpainting and super-resolution. Using a class conditional
diffusion model for recovery, compared to the \pgdm baseline, the proposed
framework achieves a reduction in inference time of \(25\%\) for inpainting
with both random and center masks, and \(23\%\) and \(24\%\) for \(4\times\)
and \(8\times\) super-resolution tasks, respectively, while incurring only
negligible loss in PSNR and SSIM.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效识别适合概念探测的神经网络层。

Abstract: Concept probing has recently gained popularity as a way for humans to peek
into what is encoded within artificial neural networks. In concept probing,
additional classifiers are trained to map the internal representations of a
model into human-defined concepts of interest. However, the performance of
these probes is highly dependent on the internal representations they probe
from, making identifying the appropriate layer to probe an essential task. In
this paper, we propose a method to automatically identify which layer's
representations in a neural network model should be considered when probing for
a given human-defined concept of interest, based on how informative and regular
the representations are with respect to the concept. We validate our findings
through an exhaustive empirical analysis over different neural network models
and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统仿真方法计算成本高且难以扩展，学习型方法未能有效利用输入层的异质性。

Method: 将IR drop估计重新定义为像素级回归任务，并提出WACA机制，通过两阶段门控策略增强弱特征通道并抑制过强通道。

Result: 在ICCAD-2023基准测试中，平均绝对误差降低61.1%，F1分数提高71.0%。

Conclusion: 通道异质性是VLSI物理布局分析中的关键归纳偏差，WACA方法显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate spatial prediction of power integrity issues, such as IR drop, is
critical for reliable VLSI design. However, traditional simulation-based
solvers are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. We address this
challenge by reformulating IR drop estimation as a pixel-wise regression task
on heterogeneous multi-channel physical maps derived from circuit layouts.
Prior learning-based methods treat all input layers (e.g., metal, via, and
current maps) equally, ignoring their varying importance to prediction
accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a novel Weakness-Aware Channel Attention
(WACA) mechanism, which recursively enhances weak feature channels while
suppressing over-dominant ones through a two-stage gating strategy. Integrated
into a ConvNeXtV2-based attention U-Net, our approach enables adaptive and
balanced feature representation. On the public ICCAD-2023 benchmark, our method
outperforms the ICCAD-2023 contest winner by reducing mean absolute error by
61.1% and improving F1-score by 71.0%. These results demonstrate that
channel-wise heterogeneity is a key inductive bias in physical layout analysis
for VLSI.

Conclusion: OS-MAP为计算机代理研究提供了结构化评估框架，揭示了当前技术的局限性，推动未来进展。

Abstract: Computer-using agents have shown strong potential to boost human productivity
and enable new application forms across platforms. While recent advances have
led to usable applications, existing benchmarks fail to account for the
internal task heterogeneity and the corresponding agent capabilities, as well
as their alignment with actual user demands-hindering both targeted capability
development and the reliable transition of research progress into practical
deployment. To bridge the gap, we present OS-MAP, a benchmark for daily
computer-using automation that organizes its 416 realistic tasks across 15
applications along two key dimensions: a five-level taxonomy of automation and
a generalization scope derived from a real-world user demand hierarchy. To
enable fine-grained analysis of required capabilities and alignment with
real-world scenarios, OS-MAP evaluates agents along two dimensions: automation
level across a five-level taxonomy, and generalization scope across a demand
hierarchy. This design captures varying levels of required agent autonomy and
generalization, forming a performance-generalization evaluation matrix for
structured and comprehensive assessment. Experiments show that even
State-of-the-Art agents with VLM backbones struggle with higher-level tasks
involving perception, reasoning, and coordination-highlighting the need for a
deeper understanding of current strengths and limitations to drive the future
progress in computer-using agents research and deployment. All code,

Conclusion: RoadDiff为精细交通管理提供了高效解决方案，解决了数据获取瓶颈。

Abstract: Fine-grained traffic management and prediction are fundamental to key
applications such as autonomous driving, lane change guidance, and traffic
signal control. However, obtaining lane-level traffic data has become a
critical bottleneck for data-driven models due to limitations in the types and
number of sensors and issues with the accuracy of tracking algorithms. To
address this, we propose the Fine-grained Road Traffic Inference (FRTI) task,
which aims to generate more detailed lane-level traffic information using
limited road data, providing a more energy-efficient and cost-effective
solution for precise traffic management. This task is abstracted as the first
scene of the spatio-temporal graph node generation problem. We designed a
two-stage framework--RoadDiff--to solve the FRTI task. solve the FRTI task.
This framework leverages the Road-Lane Correlation Autoencoder-Decoder and the
Lane Diffusion Module to fully utilize the limited spatio-temporal dependencies
and distribution relationships of road data to accurately infer fine-grained
lane traffic states. Based on existing research, we designed several baseline
models with the potential to solve the FRTI task and conducted extensive
experiments on six datasets representing different road conditions to validate
the effectiveness of the RoadDiff model in addressing the FRTI task. The

Abstract: Robust and unobtrusive in-vehicle physiological monitoring is crucial for
ensuring driving safety and user experience. While remote physiological
measurement (RPM) offers a promising non-invasive solution, its translation to
real-world driving scenarios is critically constrained by the scarcity of
comprehensive datasets. Existing resources are often limited in scale, modality
diversity, the breadth of biometric annotations, and the range of captured
conditions, thereby omitting inherent real-world challenges in driving. Here,
we present PhysDrive, the first large-scale multimodal dataset for contactless
in-vehicle physiological sensing with dedicated consideration on various
modality settings and driving factors. PhysDrive collects data from 48 drivers,
including synchronized RGB, near-infrared camera, and raw mmWave radar data,
accompanied with six synchronized ground truths (ECG, BVP, Respiration, HR, RR,

including driver motions, dynamic natural light, vehicle types, and road

In this paper, we propose an interpretable deep learning model on Residual

clinically meaningful visual explanations. Our findings demonstrate that high

Conclusion: 学习型单像素荧光显微镜有望推动诊断和生物研究，以低成本实现多光谱成像。

Abstract: Single-pixel imaging has emerged as a key technique in fluorescence
microscopy, where fast acquisition and reconstruction are crucial. In this
context, images are reconstructed from linearly compressed measurements. In
practice, total variation minimisation is still used to reconstruct the image
from noisy measurements of the inner product between orthogonal sampling
pattern vectors and the original image data. However, data can be leveraged to
learn the measurement vectors and the reconstruction process, thereby enhancing
compression, reconstruction quality, and speed. We train an autoencoder through
self-supervision to learn an encoder (or measurement matrix) and a decoder. We
then test it on physically acquired multispectral and intensity data. During
acquisition, the learned encoder becomes part of the physical device. Our
approach can enhance single-pixel imaging in fluorescence microscopy by
reducing reconstruction time by two orders of magnitude, achieving superior
image quality, and enabling multispectral reconstructions. Ultimately, learned
single-pixel fluorescence microscopy could advance diagnosis and biological
research, providing multispectral imaging at a fraction of the cost.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了生成脑部图像的细节和真实感。

Abstract: We propose image-to-image diffusion models that are designed to enhance the
realism and details of generated brain images by introducing sharp edges, fine
textures, subtle anatomical features, and imaging noise. Generative models have
been widely adopted in the biomedical domain, especially in image generation
applications. Latent diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art results in
generating brain MRIs. However, due to latent compression, generated images
from these models are overly smooth, lacking fine anatomical structures and
scan acquisition noise that are typically seen in real images. This work
formulates the realism enhancing and detail adding process as image-to-image
diffusion models, which refines the quality of LDM-generated images. We employ
commonly used metrics like FID and LPIPS for image realism assessment.
Furthermore, we introduce new metrics to demonstrate the realism of images
generated by RealDeal in terms of image noise distribution, sharpness, and
texture.

Abstract: Brachytherapy involves bringing a radioactive source near tumor tissue using
implanted needles. Image-guided brachytherapy planning requires amongst others,
the reconstruction of the needles. Manually annotating these needles on patient
images can be a challenging and time-consuming task for medical professionals.
For automatic needle reconstruction, a two-stage pipeline is commonly adopted,
comprising a segmentation stage followed by a post-processing stage. While deep
learning models are effective for segmentation, their results often contain
errors. No currently existing post-processing technique is robust to all
possible segmentation errors. We therefore propose adaptations to existing
post-processing techniques mainly aimed at dealing with segmentation errors and
thereby improving the reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on a prostate cancer
dataset, based on MRI scans annotated by medical professionals, demonstrate
that our proposed adaptations can help to effectively manage segmentation
errors, with the best adapted post-processing technique achieving median
needle-tip and needle-bottom point localization errors of $1.07$ (IQR $\pm
1.04$) mm and $0.43$ (IQR $\pm 0.46$) mm, respectively, and median shaft error
of $0.75$ (IQR $\pm 0.69$) mm with 0 false positive and 0 false negative
needles on a test set of 261 needles.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双路径学习（DPL）模型，用于医学图像去噪，结合噪声和上下文信息，提升了去噪效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中的噪声会降低图像质量，影响诊断和治疗。现有方法通常仅针对单一模态和噪声类型，缺乏通用性。

Method: 设计了双路径学习（DPL）模型，整合噪声特征和图像上下文信息，通过融合生成最终输出。

Result: DPL在多种成像模态和噪声类型下表现稳健，PSNR比基线UNet提高了3.35%。

Conclusion: DPL是一种通用且高效的医学图像去噪方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, enabling
clinicians to accurately diagnose diseases and develop effective treatment
plans. However, noise, often introduced by imaging devices, can degrade image
quality, leading to misinterpretation and compromised clinical outcomes.
Existing denoising approaches typically rely either on noise characteristics or
on contextual information from the image. Moreover, they are commonly developed
and evaluated for a single imaging modality and noise type. Motivated by Geng
et.al CNCL, which integrates both noise and context, this study introduces a
Dual-Pathway Learning (DPL) model architecture that effectively denoises
medical images by leveraging both sources of information and fusing them to
generate the final output. DPL is evaluated across multiple imaging modalities
and various types of noise, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
DPL improves PSNR by 3.35% compared to the baseline UNet when evaluated on
Gaussian noise and trained across all modalities. The code is available at

Motivation: 准确分割和量化COPD患者的肺血管（尤其是小血管）对疾病分析至关重要。

Method: 采用教师-学生模型的自训练框架，通过交互式标注获取高质量数据，利用教师模型生成伪标签并筛选可靠样本，迭代训练学生模型。

Abstract: Background: It is fundamental for accurate segmentation and quantification of
the pulmonary vessel, particularly smaller vessels, from computed tomography
(CT) images in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients.
Objective: The aim of this study was to segment the pulmonary vasculature using
a semi-supervised method. Methods: In this study, a self-training framework is
proposed by leveraging a teacher-student model for the segmentation of
pulmonary vessels. First, the high-quality annotations are acquired in the
in-house data by an interactive way. Then, the model is trained in the
semi-supervised way. A fully supervised model is trained on a small set of
labeled CT images, yielding the teacher model. Following this, the teacher
model is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled CT images, from which
reliable ones are selected based on a certain strategy. The training of the
student model involves these reliable pseudo-labels. This training process is
iteratively repeated until an optimal performance is achieved. Results:
Extensive experiments are performed on non-enhanced CT scans of 125 COPD
patients. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that the proposed
method, Semi2, significantly improves the precision of vessel segmentation by
2.3%, achieving a precision of 90.3%. Further, quantitative analysis is
conducted in the pulmonary vessel of COPD, providing insights into the
differences in the pulmonary vessel across different severity of the disease.
Conclusion: The proposed method can not only improve the performance of
pulmonary vascular segmentation, but can also be applied in COPD analysis. The
code will be made available at

Motivation: 现有方法在长距离依赖和多样化上下文信息的利用上效率不足，影响了图像压缩的性能。

Method: 采用分层编码计划逐步建模多尺度潜在变量的上下文依赖，并提出渐进上下文融合机制整合历史上下文信息。

Result: 实验表明，HPCM在率失真性能和计算复杂度之间取得了更好的平衡，达到了当前最佳性能。

Conclusion: HPCM通过分层和渐进机制，显著提升了上下文建模效率，为图像压缩提供了新思路。

Abstract: Context modeling is essential in learned image compression for accurately
estimating the distribution of latents. While recent advanced methods have
expanded context modeling capacity, they still struggle to efficiently exploit
long-range dependency and diverse context information across different coding
steps. In this paper, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Progressive Context
Model (HPCM) for more efficient context information acquisition. Specifically,
HPCM employs a hierarchical coding schedule to sequentially model the
contextual dependencies among latents at multiple scales, which enables more
efficient long-range context modeling. Furthermore, we propose a progressive
context fusion mechanism that incorporates contextual information from previous
coding steps into the current step, effectively exploiting diverse contextual
information. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance and strikes a better balance
between compression performance and computational complexity. The code is

Method: 引入“生成模型动物园”，系统分析潜在扩散模型和自回归模型在重建与生成任务中的表现，通过心脏医学影像任务（如图像修复和无条件生成）进行基准测试。

Result: 扩散模型在无条件生成中表现更优，但修复任务中随着掩码比例增加易产生幻觉；自回归模型在修复任务中表现稳定，但保真度较低。

Conclusion: 不同生成模型在医学影像任务中各有优劣，需根据具体任务需求选择合适的模型。

Abstract: In medical imaging, generative models are increasingly relied upon for two
distinct but equally critical tasks: reconstruction, where the goal is to
restore medical imaging (usually inverse problems like inpainting or
superresolution), and generation, where synthetic data is created to augment
datasets or carry out counterfactual analysis. Despite shared architecture and
learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high
perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity
and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and
systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive
models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of
generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing
on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as
well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models
offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to
hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain
stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally
lower fidelity.

Abstract: Mammography is the most commonly used imaging modality for breast cancer
screening, driving an increasing demand for deep-learning techniques to support
large-scale analysis. However, the development of accurate and robust methods
is often limited by insufficient data availability and a lack of diversity in
lesion characteristics. While generative models offer a promising solution for
data synthesis, current approaches often fail to adequately emphasize
lesion-specific features and their relationships with surrounding tissues. In
this paper, we propose Gated Conditional Diffusion Model (GCDM), a novel
framework designed to jointly synthesize holistic mammogram images and
localized lesions. GCDM is built upon a latent denoising diffusion framework,
where the noised latent image is concatenated with a soft mask embedding that
represents breast, lesion, and their transitional regions, ensuring anatomical
coherence between them during the denoising process. To further emphasize
lesion-specific features, GCDM incorporates a gated conditioning branch that
guides the denoising process by dynamically selecting and fusing the most
relevant radiomic and geometric properties of lesions, effectively capturing
their interplay. Experimental results demonstrate that GCDM achieves precise
control over small lesion areas while enhancing the realism and diversity of
synthesized mammograms. These advancements position GCDM as a promising tool
for clinical applications in mammogram synthesis. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ULS23模型在纵向病灶分割中表现不佳，主要因扫描配准误差和病灶对应关系失效，需转向端到端模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ULS23模型在纵向病灶分割中的表现，揭示单时间点模型在时间分析中的局限性。

Method: 使用公共临床CT数据集，评估模型在随访病例中的分割和跟踪能力，并通过实验模拟病灶位移。

Result: 模型性能高度依赖病灶居中假设，位移后分割准确性显著下降。

Conclusion: 需开发专为时间分析设计的端到端模型，以提升纵向病灶跟踪的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Longitudinal lesion analysis is crucial for oncological care, yet automated
tools often struggle with temporal consistency. While universal lesion
segmentation models have advanced, they are typically designed for single time
points. This paper investigates the performance of the ULS23 segmentation model
in a longitudinal context. Using a public clinical dataset of baseline and
follow-up CT scans, we evaluated the model's ability to segment and track
lesions over time. We identified two critical, interconnected failure modes: a
sharp degradation in segmentation quality in follow-up cases due to inter-scan
registration errors, and a subsequent breakdown of the lesion correspondence
process. To systematically probe this vulnerability, we conducted a controlled
experiment where we artificially displaced the input volume relative to the
true lesion center. Our results demonstrate that the model's performance is
highly dependent on its assumption of a centered lesion; segmentation accuracy
collapses when the lesion is sufficiently displaced. These findings reveal a
fundamental limitation of applying single-timepoint models to longitudinal
data. We conclude that robust oncological tracking requires a paradigm shift
away from cascading single-purpose tools towards integrated, end-to-end models
inherently designed for temporal analysis.

TL;DR: NerT-CA提出了一种结合神经和张量表示的方法，用于从稀疏视角X射线冠状动脉造影（CA）中快速重建4D冠状动脉结构，解决了现有方法训练时间长和精度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的冠状动脉3D和4D重建方法依赖耗时的手动或易出错的自动分割，限制了临床实用性。NeRF-based方法在稀疏视角下表现良好，但训练时间长。

Method: NerT-CA将CA场景分解为低秩和稀疏成分，使用快速张量场进行静态重建，神经场进行动态稀疏重建。

Result: 该方法在训练时间和重建精度上优于现有方法，仅需三个视角即可获得合理重建。

Conclusion: NerT-CA为稀疏视角CA的4D重建提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) and dynamic 3D+time (4D) reconstruction of coronary
arteries from X-ray coronary angiography (CA) has the potential to improve
clinical procedures. However, there are multiple challenges to be addressed,
most notably, blood-vessel structure sparsity, poor background and blood vessel
distinction, sparse-views, and intra-scan motion. State-of-the-art
reconstruction approaches rely on time-consuming manual or error-prone
automatic segmentations, limiting clinical usability. Recently, approaches
based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown promise for automatic
reconstructions in the sparse-view setting. However, they suffer from long
training times due to their dependence on MLP-based representations. We propose
NerT-CA, a hybrid approach of Neural and Tensorial representations for
accelerated 4D reconstructions with sparse-view CA. Building on top of the
previous NeRF-based work, we model the CA scene as a decomposition of low-rank
and sparse components, utilizing fast tensorial fields for low-rank static
reconstruction and neural fields for dynamic sparse reconstruction. Our
approach outperforms previous works in both training time and reconstruction
accuracy, yielding reasonable reconstructions from as few as three angiogram
views. We validate our approach quantitatively and qualitatively on
representative 4D phantom datasets.

Motivation: 当前视频超分辨率（VSR）领域存在三个主要挑战：时间动态建模不一致、高频细节恢复不足以及缺乏4K超分辨率评估。

Method: 1）提出Consistency Preserved ControlNet（CPC）架构；2）引入High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss（HR-Loss）；3）构建首个公开的4K VSR基准数据集RealisVideo-4K。

Result: 在多个VSR基准测试中表现优异，尤其在超高分辨率场景下，且训练数据量仅为现有方法的5-25%。

Conclusion: RealisVSR通过创新设计和数据集填补了VSR领域的空白，显著提升了超分辨率效果。

Abstract: Video Super-Resolution (VSR) has achieved significant progress through
diffusion models, effectively addressing the over-smoothing issues inherent in
GAN-based methods. Despite recent advances, three critical challenges persist
in VSR community: 1) Inconsistent modeling of temporal dynamics in foundational
models; 2) limited high-frequency detail recovery under complex real-world
degradations; and 3) insufficient evaluation of detail enhancement and 4K
super-resolution, as current methods primarily rely on 720P datasets with
inadequate details. To address these challenges, we propose RealisVSR, a
high-frequency detail-enhanced video diffusion model with three core
innovations: 1) Consistency Preserved ControlNet (CPC) architecture integrated
with the Wan2.1 video diffusion to model the smooth and complex motions and
suppress artifacts; 2) High-Frequency Rectified Diffusion Loss (HR-Loss)
combining wavelet decomposition and HOG feature constraints for texture
restoration; 3) RealisVideo-4K, the first public 4K VSR benchmark containing
1,000 high-definition video-text pairs. Leveraging the advanced spatio-temporal
guidance of Wan2.1, our method requires only 5-25% of the training data volume
compared to existing approaches. Extensive experiments on VSR benchmarks (REDS,
SPMCS, UDM10, YouTube-HQ, VideoLQ, RealisVideo-720P) demonstrate our
superiority, particularly in ultra-high-resolution scenarios.

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in automated
Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) analysis. However, the efficacy of these
models is highly dependent on the availability of high-quality, artifact-free
images. In clinical practice, CMR acquisitions are frequently degraded by
respiratory motion, yet the robustness of deep learning models against such
artifacts remains an underexplored problem. To promote research in this domain,
we organized the MICCAI CMRxMotion challenge. We curated and publicly released
a dataset of 320 CMR cine series from 40 healthy volunteers who performed
specific breathing protocols to induce a controlled spectrum of motion
artifacts. The challenge comprised two tasks: 1) automated image quality
assessment to classify images based on motion severity, and 2) robust
myocardial segmentation in the presence of motion artifacts. A total of 22
algorithms were submitted and evaluated on the two designated tasks. This paper
presents a comprehensive overview of the challenge design and dataset, reports
the evaluation results for the top-performing methods, and further investigates
the impact of motion artifacts on five clinically relevant biomarkers. All

Method: 采用基于注意力机制的深度学习模型，结合MobileNetV3-small、EfficientNet-b0和DenseNet-169作为主干网络。

Result: 在APTOS和EYEPACS数据集上，DenseNet-169分别达到83.20%和75.43%的准确率，MobileNetV3-small和EfficientNet-b0也表现良好。F1分数为82.0%，特异性高达95.5%。

Conclusion: 所提方法在DR分类中表现优异，参数较少，性能与近期研究相当。

Abstract: Automatic classification of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) can assist
ophthalmologists in devising personalized treatment plans, making it a critical
component of clinical practice. However, imbalanced data distribution in the
dataset becomes a bottleneck in the generalization of deep learning models
trained for DR classification. In this work, we combine global attention block
(GAB) and category attention block (CAB) into the deep learning model, thus
effectively overcoming the imbalanced data distribution problem in DR
classification. Our proposed approach is based on an attention mechanism-based
deep learning model that employs three pre-trained networks, namely,
MobileNetV3-small, Efficientnet-b0, and DenseNet-169 as the backbone
architecture. We evaluate the proposed method on two publicly available
datasets of retinal fundoscopy images for DR. Experimental results show that on
the APTOS dataset, the DenseNet-169 yielded 83.20% mean accuracy, followed by
the MobileNetV3-small and EfficientNet-b0, which yielded 82% and 80%
accuracies, respectively. On the EYEPACS dataset, the EfficientNet-b0 yielded a
mean accuracy of 80%, while the DenseNet-169 and MobileNetV3-small yielded
75.43% and 76.68% accuracies, respectively. In addition, we also compute the
F1-score of 82.0%, precision of 82.1%, sensitivity of 83.0%, specificity of
95.5%, and a kappa score of 88.2% for the experiments. Moreover, in our work,
the MobileNetV3-small has 1.6 million parameters on the APTOS dataset and 0.90
million parameters on the EYEPACS dataset, which is comparatively less than
other methods. The proposed approach achieves competitive performance that is
at par with recently reported works on DR classification.

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate tumor segmentation is vital for adaptive radiation therapy
(ART) but remains time-consuming and user-dependent. Segment Anything Model 2
(SAM2) shows promise for prompt-based segmentation but struggles with tumor
accuracy. We propose prior knowledge-based augmentation strategies to enhance
SAM2 for ART.
  Methods: Two strategies were introduced to improve SAM2: (1) using prior MR
images and annotations as contextual inputs, and (2) improving prompt
robustness via random bounding box expansion and mask erosion/dilation. The
resulting model, SAM2-Aug, was fine-tuned and tested on the One-Seq-Liver
dataset (115 MRIs from 31 liver cancer patients), and evaluated without
retraining on Mix-Seq-Abdomen (88 MRIs, 28 patients) and Mix-Seq-Brain (86
MRIs, 37 patients).
  Results: SAM2-Aug outperformed convolutional, transformer-based, and
prompt-driven models across all datasets, achieving Dice scores of 0.86(liver),
0.89(abdomen), and 0.90(brain). It demonstrated strong generalization across
tumor types and imaging sequences, with improved performance in
boundary-sensitive metrics.
  Conclusions: Incorporating prior images and enhancing prompt diversity
significantly boosts segmentation accuracy and generalizability. SAM2-Aug
offers a robust, efficient solution for tumor segmentation in ART. Code and
models will be released at https://github.com/apple1986/SAM2-Aug.

Motivation: 传统MS模型追求最短边界，但无法有效处理网格的不规则结构。本文旨在通过rTGV正则化改进模型，以更准确地捕捉几何结构的高阶不连续性。

Method: 提出分段平滑MS模型，将网格特征函数分解为分段常数函数与平滑函数的和，并采用rTGV正则化。使用交替最小化和ADMM算法求解。

Result: 实验表明，新方法在Princeton分割基准测试中表现优异，边界更优且计算效率高。

Conclusion: 新模型通过rTGV正则化显著提升了网格分割效果，尤其在处理不规则结构时优于现有方法。

Abstract: The Mumford-Shah (MS) model is an important technique for mesh segmentation.
Many existing researches focus on piecewise constant MS mesh segmentation model
with total variation regularization, which pursue the shortest length of
boundaries. Different from previous efforts, in this article, we propose a
novel piecewise smooth MS mesh segmentation model by utilizing the relaxed
total generalized variation regularization (rTGV). The new model assumes that
the feature function of a mesh can be approximated by the sum of piecewise
constant function and asmooth function, and the rTGV regularization is able to
characterize the high order discontinuity of the geometric structure. The newly
introduced method is effective in segmenting meshes with irregular structures
and getting the better boundaries rather than the shortest boundaries. We solve
the new model by alternating minimization and alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM). Our algorithm is discussed from several aspects, and
comparisons with several state-of-art methods. Experimental results show that
our method can yield competitive results when compared to other approaches. In
addition, our results compare favorably to those of the several state-of-art
techniques when evaluated on the Princeton Segmentation Benchmark. Furthermore,
the quantitative errors and computational costs confirm the robustness and
efficiency of the proposed method.

reduced accuracy honoring the variety of real world ground truth landscapes. In
our proposed method, we define a process to automatically amplify real-world
scanned data and render real-time in animated 3D to explore at close range with
high quality for training, simulation, video game and visualisation
applications.

### [161] [MLLM-based Speech Recognition: When and How is Multimodality Beneficial?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19037)
*Yiwen Guan,Viet Anh Trinh,Vivek Voleti,Jacob Whitehill*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在噪声环境中通过结合多种输入模态（如语音、文本、图像）提升自动语音识别（ASR）准确性。实验表明，模态的同步性、质量和输入顺序对结果有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态输入在噪声环境下提升ASR准确性的条件和模型架构，以弥补单一模态的不足。

Method: 通过合成和真实数据实验，分析不同模态（同步与非同步）在不同噪声水平下的表现，以及视觉表示质量和输入顺序的影响。

Result: 1. 多模态通常提升ASR准确性，但效果依赖噪声水平；2. 同步模态在高噪声下更有效，非同步模态在中噪声下更优；3. 高质量视觉表示持续提升准确性；4. Mamba与Transformer在多模态优势上表现相似；5. 模态输入顺序和损失权重显著影响结果。

Conclusion: 多模态输入在噪声环境中对ASR有显著提升，但需根据噪声水平和模态特性优化模型设计。

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have opened new
possibilities for unified modeling of speech, text, images, and other
modalities. Building on our prior work, this paper examines the conditions and
model architectures under which multiple input modalities can improve automatic
speech recognition (ASR) accuracy in noisy environments. Through experiments on
synthetic and real-world data, we find that (1) harnessing more modalities
usually improves ASR accuracy, as each modality provides complementary
information, but the improvement depends on the amount of auditory noise. (2)
Synchronized modalities (e.g., lip movements) are more useful at high noise
levels whereas unsynchronized modalities (e.g., image context) are most helpful
at moderate noise levels. (3) Higher-quality visual representations
consistently improve ASR accuracy, highlighting the importance of developing
more powerful visual encoders. (4) Mamba exhibits similar trends regarding the
benefits of multimodality as do Transformers. (5) The input order of modalities
as well as their weights in the loss function can significantly impact
accuracy. These findings both offer practical insights and help to deepen our
understanding of multi-modal speech recognition under challenging conditions.

### [162] [Face2VoiceSync: Lightweight Face-Voice Consistency for Text-Driven Talking Face Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19225)
*Fang Kang,Yin Cao,Haoyu Chen*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 论文提出Face2VoiceSync框架，解决语音驱动面部动画生成中的固定语音限制问题，实现从文本和面部图像生成同步语音和动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音驱动面部动画生成方法依赖固定语音，限制了应用（如面部-语音不匹配）。本文扩展任务至更具挑战性的设置，即从文本和面部图像生成同步语音和动画。

Method: 提出Face2VoiceSync框架，包括语音-面部对齐、多样性控制、高效训练（轻量VAE桥接视觉与音频预训练模型）和新评估指标。

Result: 实验表明，Face2VoiceSync在单块40GB GPU上实现了视觉和音频的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Face2VoiceSync成功解决了语音-面部同步生成的挑战，并在性能和效率上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent studies in speech-driven talking face generation achieve promising
results, but their reliance on fixed-driven speech limits further applications
(e.g., face-voice mismatch). Thus, we extend the task to a more challenging
setting: given a face image and text to speak, generating both talking face
animation and its corresponding speeches. Accordingly, we propose a novel
framework, Face2VoiceSync, with several novel contributions: 1) Voice-Face
Alignment, ensuring generated voices match facial appearance; 2) Diversity \&
Manipulation, enabling generated voice control over paralinguistic features
space; 3) Efficient Training, using a lightweight VAE to bridge visual and
audio large-pretrained models, with significantly fewer trainable parameters
than existing methods; 4) New Evaluation Metric, fairly assessing the diversity
and identity consistency. Experiments show Face2VoiceSync achieves both visual
and audio state-of-the-art performances on a single 40GB GPU.

### [163] [FD-Bench: A Full-Duplex Benchmarking Pipeline Designed for Full Duplex Spoken Dialogue Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19040)
*Yizhou Peng,Yi-Wen Chao,Dianwen Ng,Yukun Ma,Chongjia Ni,Bin Ma,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于LLM、TTS和ASR的全双工对话系统（FDSDS）评测框架，填补了现有评测标准在用户打断场景下的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对话系统依赖轮流对话，而全双工系统支持实时打断和反馈，但缺乏针对此类场景的评测标准。

Method: 设计了一套包含多种新指标的评测流程，评估FDSDS在用户打断、延迟管理和鲁棒性方面的表现。

Result: 测试了三个开源FDSDS模型，结果显示它们在频繁打断和噪声环境下仍存在响应失败等问题。

Conclusion: 全双工对话系统仍需改进，评测框架为未来研究提供了工具和数据支持。

Abstract: Full-duplex spoken dialogue systems (FDSDS) enable more natural human-machine
interactions by allowing real-time user interruptions and backchanneling,
compared to traditional SDS that rely on turn-taking. However, existing
benchmarks lack metrics for FD scenes, e.g., evaluating model performance
during user interruptions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive FD
benchmarking pipeline utilizing LLMs, TTS, and ASR to address this gap. It
assesses FDSDS's ability to handle user interruptions, manage delays, and
maintain robustness in challenging scenarios with diverse novel metrics. We
applied our benchmark to three open-source FDSDS (Moshi, Freeze-omni, and
VITA-1.5) using over 40 hours of generated speech, with 293 simulated
conversations and 1,200 interruptions. The results show that all models
continue to face challenges, such as failing to respond to user interruptions,
under frequent disruptions and noisy conditions. Demonstrations, data, and code
will be released.

### [164] [Should Top-Down Clustering Affect Boundaries in Unsupervised Word Discovery?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19204)
*Simon Malan,Benjamin van Niekerk,Herman Kamper*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何将未标记语音分割为类似单词的单元并聚类构建词典，比较了自底向上和自顶向下两种方法，发现两者性能相当但自底向上方法更快。聚类步骤是性能瓶颈，建议未来研究改进聚类技术和学习更具区分性的词表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自顶向下信息是否对语音分割改进必要，比较两种方法在性能上的差异。

Method: 自底向上方法通过相邻自监督特征的差异预测边界并聚类；自顶向下方法（ES-KMeans）通过动态规划和K-means迭代更新边界。

Result: 两种方法在ZeroSpeech基准测试中性能相当，自底向上方法快5倍。自顶向下方法在某些情况下有益，但自底向上方法通常表现相似。

Conclusion: 聚类步骤是性能瓶颈，未来研究应聚焦改进聚类技术和学习更具区分性的词表示。

Abstract: We investigate the problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like
units and clustering these to create a lexicon. Prior work can be categorized
into two frameworks. Bottom-up methods first determine boundaries and then
cluster the fixed segmented words into a lexicon. In contrast, top-down methods
incorporate information from the clustered words to inform boundary selection.
However, it is unclear whether top-down information is necessary to improve
segmentation. To explore this, we look at two similar approaches that differ in
whether top-down clustering informs boundary selection. Our simple bottom-up
strategy predicts word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent
self-supervised features, then clusters the resulting segments to construct a
lexicon. Our top-down system is an updated version of the ES-KMeans dynamic
programming method that iteratively uses K-means to update its boundaries. On
the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, both approaches achieve comparable
state-of-the-art results, with the bottom-up system being nearly five times
faster. Through detailed analyses, we show that the top-down influence of
ES-KMeans can be beneficial (depending on factors like the candidate
boundaries), but in many cases the simple bottom-up method performs just as
well. For both methods, we show that the clustering step is a limiting factor.
Therefore, we recommend that future work focus on improved clustering
techniques and learning more discriminative word-like representations. Project

### [165] [PGKET: A Photonic Gaussian Kernel Enhanced Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19041)
*Ren-Xin Zhao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: PGKET利用光子高斯核自注意力机制提升长序列处理效率，在MedMNIST v2和CIFAR-10任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自注意力机制在长序列处理中的低效问题。

Method: 基于光子高斯核自注意力机制（PGKSAM），利用光子干涉和并行处理计算注意力分数。

Result: 在MedMNIST v2和CIFAR-10多分类任务中优于现有Transformer模型。

Conclusion: PGKET有望提升复杂任务性能并加速光子计算与机器学习的融合。

Abstract: Self-Attention Mechanisms (SAMs) enhance model performance by extracting key
information but are inefficient when dealing with long sequences. To this end,
a photonic Gaussian Kernel Enhanced Transformer (PGKET) is proposed, based on
the Photonic Gaussian Kernel Self-Attention Mechanism (PGKSAM). The PGKSAM
calculates the Photonic Gaussian Kernel Self-Attention Score (PGKSAS) using
photon interferometry and superposition to process multiple inputs in parallel.
Experimental results show that PGKET outperforms some state-of-the-art
transformers in multi-classification tasks on MedMNIST v2 and CIFAR-10, and is
expected to improve performance in complex tasks and accelerate the convergence
of Photonic Computing (PC) and machine learning.
