### [1] [Decomposing Attention To Find Context-Sensitive Neurons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03315)
*Alex Gibson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过分析GPT2-Small第一层中注意力模式分散且对内容依赖较弱的注意力头，利用校准文本采样softmax分母，结合多个稳定头的输出，近似得到周围文本的线性摘要，从而仅从权重和单一校准文本就能发现数百个对高级上下文属性响应的第一层神经元。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究transformer语言模型中注意力模式分散、对内容依赖较弱的注意力头，探索如何仅从模型权重和单一校准文本就能揭示神经元对高级上下文属性的响应。

Method: 分析GPT2-Small第一层中稳定的注意力头，利用校准文本采样softmax分母，结合多个稳定头的输出，近似得到周围文本的线性摘要。

Result: 仅从权重和单一校准文本就能发现数百个第一层神经元响应高级上下文属性，包括在校准文本上未激活的神经元。

Conclusion: 该方法能够仅从模型权重和少量校准数据就揭示transformer语言模型中神经元对高级上下文属性的响应模式。

Abstract: We study transformer language models, analyzing attention heads whose
attention patterns are spread out, and whose attention scores depend weakly on
content. We argue that the softmax denominators of these heads are stable when
the underlying token distribution is fixed. By sampling softmax denominators
from a "calibration text", we can combine together the outputs of multiple such
stable heads in the first layer of GPT2-Small, approximating their combined
output by a linear summary of the surrounding text. This approximation enables
a procedure where from the weights alone - and a single calibration text - we
can uncover hundreds of first layer neurons that respond to high-level
contextual properties of the surrounding text, including neurons that didn't
activate on the calibration text.

### [2] [Graph-S3: Enhancing Agentic textual Graph Retrieval with Synthetic Stepwise Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03323)
*Ge Chang,Jinbo Su,Jiacheng Liu,Pengfei Yang,Yuhao Shang,Huiwen Zheng,Hongli Ma,Yan Liang,Yuanchun Li,Yunxin Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Graph-S³是一个基于LLM的文本图推理框架，通过合成逐步监督训练检索器，解决了大型图中相关内容检索的挑战，在复杂推理任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据多以文本图形式存在，但现有图检索方法性能不佳，要么依赖浅层嵌入相似度，要么需要大量标注数据和训练成本。

Method: 提出Graph-S³框架，使用基于LLM的检索器，通过数据合成管道提取黄金子图生成奖励，采用两阶段训练方案学习交互式图探索策略。

Result: 在三个常用数据集上与七个强基线比较，准确率平均提升8.1%，F1分数提升9.7%，在多跳推理任务中优势更明显。

Conclusion: Graph-S³通过合成逐步监督和两阶段训练，显著提升了文本图问答系统的性能，特别是在复杂推理任务中表现突出。

Abstract: A significant portion of real-world data is inherently represented as textual
graphs, and integrating these graphs into large language models (LLMs) is
promising to enable complex graph-based question answering. However, a key
challenge in LLM-based textual graph QA systems lies in graph retrieval, i.e.,
how to retrieve relevant content from large graphs that is sufficiently
informative while remaining compact for the LLM context. Existing retrievers
suffer from poor performance since they either rely on shallow embedding
similarity or employ interactive retrieving policies that demand excessive data
labeling and training cost. To address these issues, we present Graph-$S^3$, an
agentic textual graph reasoning framework that employs an LLM-based retriever
trained with synthetic stepwise supervision. Instead of rewarding the agent
based on the final answers, which may lead to sparse and unstable training
signals, we propose to closely evaluate each step of the retriever based on
offline-extracted golden subgraphs. Our main techniques include a data
synthesis pipeline to extract the golden subgraphs for reward generation and a
two-stage training scheme to learn the interactive graph exploration policy
based on the synthesized rewards. Based on extensive experiments on three
common datasets in comparison with seven strong baselines, our approach
achieves an average improvement of 8.1\% in accuracy and 9.7\% in F$_1$ score.
The advantage is even higher in more complicated multi-hop reasoning tasks. Our
code will be open-sourced.

### [3] [Implicit Values Embedded in How Humans and LLMs Complete Subjective Everyday Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03384)
*Arjun Arunasalam,Madison Pickering,Z. Berkay Celik,Blase Ur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文审计了六个流行大语言模型在完成30个日常任务时表现出的隐含价值观，发现LLMs与人类及其他LLMs在价值观上存在显著不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI助手在帮助用户完成日常任务方面具有潜力，但人们对这些助手在完成主观日常任务时表现的隐含价值观知之甚少。

Method: 通过审计六个流行LLMs完成30个日常任务的表现，并与100名美国众包工作者进行比较。

Result: 发现LLMs在隐含价值观上经常与人类不一致，且不同LLMs之间也存在差异。

Conclusion: LLMs在价值观表现上与人类存在显著差异，需要在AI助手开发中重视价值观对齐问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can underpin AI assistants that help users with
everyday tasks, such as by making recommendations or performing basic
computation. Despite AI assistants' promise, little is known about the implicit
values these assistants display while completing subjective everyday tasks.
Humans may consider values like environmentalism, charity, and diversity. To
what extent do LLMs exhibit these values in completing everyday tasks? How do
they compare with humans? We answer these questions by auditing how six popular
LLMs complete 30 everyday tasks, comparing LLMs to each other and to 100 human
crowdworkers from the US. We find LLMs often do not align with humans, nor with
other LLMs, in the implicit values exhibited.

### [4] [Morpheme Induction for Emergent Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03439)
*Brendon Boldt,David Mortensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CSAR是一种从并行话语和意义语料库中诱导语素的贪婪算法，通过互信息加权、选择、移除和重复的过程来提取语素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种能够从涌现语言语料库中自动识别和提取语素的算法，以理解语言形成的基本单元

Method: 基于互信息的贪婪算法：1）计算形式与意义之间的互信息来加权语素；2）选择权重最高的语素对；3）从语料库中移除该语素；4）重复上述过程提取更多语素

Result: 在程序生成数据集上验证了CSAR的有效性，并在人类语言数据上展示了合理的预测能力，同时分析了涌现语言的语言学特征如同义词和多义词程度

Conclusion: CSAR算法能够有效从涌现语言中诱导语素，为理解语言形成机制提供了量化分析工具

Abstract: We introduce CSAR, an algorithm for inducing morphemes from emergent language
corpora of parallel utterances and meanings. It is a greedy algorithm that (1)
weights morphemes based on mutual information between forms and meanings, (2)
selects the highest-weighted pair, (3) removes it from the corpus, and (4)
repeats the process to induce further morphemes (i.e., Count, Select, Ablate,
Repeat). The effectiveness of CSAR is first validated on procedurally generated
datasets and compared against baselines for related tasks. Second, we validate
CSAR's performance on human language data to show that the algorithm makes
reasonable predictions in adjacent domains. Finally, we analyze a handful of
emergent languages, quantifying linguistic characteristics like degree of
synonymy and polysemy.

### [5] [Omni-Embed-Nemotron: A Unified Multimodal Retrieval Model for Text, Image, Audio, and Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03458)
*Mengyao Xu,Wenfei Zhou,Yauhen Babakhin,Gabriel Moreira,Ronay Ak,Radek Osmulski,Bo Liu,Even Oldridge,Benedikt Schifferer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Omni-Embed-Nemotron是一个统一的多模态检索嵌入模型，支持文本、图像、音频和视频的跨模态和联合模态检索，解决了传统文本检索器在处理真实世界复杂文档时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本的检索器依赖干净的结构化输入，难以处理PDF、幻灯片、视频等真实世界文档中视觉和语义丰富的内容。受ColPali和Qwen2.5-Omni等工作的启发，需要将检索能力扩展到更多模态。

Method: 采用图像表示保留文档布局，构建统一的多模态检索架构，支持跨模态（如文本-视频）和联合模态（如文本-视频+音频）检索，使用单一模型处理所有模态。

Result: 在文本、图像和视频检索任务中展示了模型的有效性，证明了其处理多模态检索的能力。

Conclusion: Omni-Embed-Nemotron成功扩展了检索能力，能够处理真实世界中复杂的多模态信息需求，为检索增强生成系统提供了更强大的基础。

Abstract: We present Omni-Embed-Nemotron, a unified multimodal retrieval embedding
model developed to handle the increasing complexity of real-world information
needs. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly advanced
language models by incorporating external knowledge, existing text-based
retrievers rely on clean, structured input and struggle with the visually and
semantically rich content found in real-world documents such as PDFs, slides,
or videos. Recent work such as ColPali has shown that preserving document
layout using image-based representations can improve retrieval quality.
Building on this, and inspired by the capabilities of recent multimodal models
such as Qwen2.5-Omni, we extend retrieval beyond text and images to also
support audio and video modalities. Omni-Embed-Nemotron enables both
cross-modal (e.g., text - video) and joint-modal (e.g., text - video+audio)
retrieval using a single model. We describe the architecture, training setup,
and evaluation results of Omni-Embed-Nemotron, and demonstrate its
effectiveness in text, image, and video retrieval.

### [6] [Searching for the Most Human-like Emergent Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03467)
*Brendon Boldt,David Mortensen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过基于信号博弈的涌现通信环境和超参数优化，生成与人类语言相似度最高的涌现语言，使用XferBench作为目标函数来量化统计相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计一个能够生成与人类语言高度相似的涌现语言的通信环境，通过量化统计相似性来评估涌现语言的质量。

Method: 使用基于信号博弈的涌现通信环境，结合超参数优化技术，以XferBench作为目标函数来生成和评估涌现语言。

Result: 证明了熵对涌现语言迁移学习性能的预测能力，验证了涌现通信系统的熵最小化特性，并确定了哪些超参数能产生更真实的涌现语言。

Conclusion: 通过该方法能够生成统计上更接近人类语言的涌现语言，并揭示了影响语言真实性的关键超参数。

Abstract: In this paper, we design a signalling game-based emergent communication
environment to generate state-of-the-art emergent languages in terms of
similarity to human language. This is done with hyperparameter optimization,
using XferBench as the objective function. XferBench quantifies the statistical
similarity of emergent language to human language by measuring its suitability
for deep transfer learning to human language. Additionally, we demonstrate the
predictive power of entropy on the transfer learning performance of emergent
language as well as corroborate previous results on the entropy-minimization
properties of emergent communication systems. Finally, we report
generalizations regarding what hyperparameters produce more realistic emergent
languages, that is, ones which transfer better to human language.

### [7] [SEER: The Span-based Emotion Evidence Retrieval Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03490)
*Aneesha Sampath,Oya Aran,Emily Mower Provost*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEER基准测试用于评估大语言模型识别文本中表达情感的具体片段的能力，包含单句和跨句情感证据检测任务，发现模型在长文本中表现下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感识别任务只给整个句子分配单一标签，而实际应用需要知道情感是如何表达的，因此需要开发能够精确定位情感表达片段的方法。

Method: 创建SEER基准测试，包含1200个真实世界句子的新标注，评估14个开源LLM在单句和跨句情感证据检测任务上的表现。

Result: 一些模型在单句输入上接近人类平均表现，但在长段落中准确率下降；错误分析显示模型过度依赖情感关键词且在中文文本中易产生误报。

Conclusion: SEER基准揭示了当前LLM在细粒度情感证据检测方面的局限性，特别是在处理长文本时的性能下降问题。

Abstract: We introduce the SEER (Span-based Emotion Evidence Retrieval) Benchmark to
test Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to identify the specific spans of
text that express emotion. Unlike traditional emotion recognition tasks that
assign a single label to an entire sentence, SEER targets the underexplored
task of emotion evidence detection: pinpointing which exact phrases convey
emotion. This span-level approach is crucial for applications like empathetic
dialogue and clinical support, which need to know how emotion is expressed, not
just what the emotion is. SEER includes two tasks: identifying emotion evidence
within a single sentence, and identifying evidence across a short passage of
five consecutive sentences. It contains new annotations for both emotion and
emotion evidence on 1200 real-world sentences. We evaluate 14 open-source LLMs
and find that, while some models approach average human performance on
single-sentence inputs, their accuracy degrades in longer passages. Our error
analysis reveals key failure modes, including overreliance on emotion keywords
and false positives in neutral text.

### [8] [ALHD: A Large-Scale and Multigenre Benchmark Dataset for Arabic LLM-Generated Text Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03502)
*Ali Khairallah,Arkaitz Zubiaga*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALHD是首个大规模阿拉伯语数据集，专门用于区分人类和LLM生成的文本，涵盖新闻、社交媒体和评论三种文体，包含超过40万个平衡样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立阿拉伯语LLM生成文本检测的基础，以应对错误信息、学术不端和网络威胁等风险。

Method: 构建包含MSA和方言阿拉伯语的平衡数据集，使用三种领先LLM生成文本，并进行严格预处理和丰富标注。基准实验包括传统分类器、BERT模型和LLM（零样本和少样本）。

Result: 微调的BERT模型表现最佳，优于基于LLM的模型。但在跨文体泛化方面存在挑战，特别是新闻文章，LLM生成的文本在风格上更接近人类文本。

Conclusion: ALHD为阿拉伯语LLM检测研究奠定了基础，揭示了跨文体泛化的挑战，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: We introduce ALHD, the first large-scale comprehensive Arabic dataset
explicitly designed to distinguish between human- and LLM-generated texts. ALHD
spans three genres (news, social media, reviews), covering both MSA and
dialectal Arabic, and contains over 400K balanced samples generated by three
leading LLMs and originated from multiple human sources, which enables studying
generalizability in Arabic LLM-genearted text detection. We provide rigorous
preprocessing, rich annotations, and standardized balanced splits to support
reproducibility. In addition, we present, analyze and discuss benchmark
experiments using our new dataset, in turn identifying gaps and proposing
future research directions. Benchmarking across traditional classifiers,
BERT-based models, and LLMs (zero-shot and few-shot) demonstrates that
fine-tuned BERT models achieve competitive performance, outperforming LLM-based
models. Results are however not always consistent, as we observe challenges
when generalizing across genres; indeed, models struggle to generalize when
they need to deal with unseen patterns in cross-genre settings, and these
challenges are particularly prominent when dealing with news articles, where
LLM-generated texts resemble human texts in style, which opens up avenues for
future research. ALHD establishes a foundation for research related to Arabic
LLM-detection and mitigating risks of misinformation, academic dishonesty, and
cyber threats.

### [9] [TS-Reasoner: Aligning Time Series Foundation Models with LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03519)
*Fangxu Yu,Hongyu Zhao,Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TS-Reasoner通过将时间序列基础模型(TSFMs)的潜在表示与大型语言模型(LLMs)的文本输入对齐，解决了时间序列推理任务中数值理解与语义推理的融合挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型能捕捉动态模式但缺乏推理能力，而大型语言模型具有推理能力但难以理解数值时间序列数据。需要一种有效的方法将两者结合。

Method: 提出两阶段训练方法：1) 使用合成的时序-文本对进行对齐预训练；2) 指令微调。保持TSFM冻结，仅训练对齐模块。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TS-Reasoner超越了主流LLM、VLM和时间序列LLM，且仅需不到一半的训练数据就能达到优异性能。

Conclusion: TS-Reasoner通过有效的模态对齐和两阶段训练，成功融合了时间序列建模与语言推理能力，在数据效率方面表现突出。

Abstract: Time series reasoning is crucial to decision-making in diverse domains,
including finance, energy usage, traffic, weather, and scientific discovery.
While existing time series foundation models (TSFMs) can capture low-level
dynamic patterns and provide accurate forecasting, further analysis usually
requires additional background knowledge and sophisticated reasoning, which are
lacking in most TSFMs but can be achieved through large language models (LLMs).
On the other hand, without expensive post-training, LLMs often struggle with
the numerical understanding of time series data. Although it is intuitive to
integrate the two types of models, developing effective training recipes that
align the two modalities for reasoning tasks is still an open challenge. To
this end, we propose TS-Reasoner that aligns the latent representations of
TSFMs with the textual inputs of LLMs for downstream understanding/reasoning
tasks. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effective method to curate
diverse, synthetic pairs of time series and textual captions for alignment
training. We then develop a two-stage training recipe that applies instruction
finetuning after the alignment pretraining. Unlike existing works that train an
LLM to take time series as inputs, we leverage a pretrained TSFM and freeze it
during training. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that
TS-Reasoner not only outperforms a wide range of prevailing LLMs, Vision
Language Models (VLMs), and Time Series LLMs, but also achieves this with
remarkable data efficiency, e.g., using less than half the training data.

### [10] [Identifying Financial Risk Information Using RAG with a Contrastive Insight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03521)
*Ali Elahi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 在专业领域推理中，传统RAG方法只能提取事实信息但缺乏比较分析能力，本文提出在RAG基础上增加对比推理层来提升专业推理质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类在专业领域推理时会比较相似案例并分析细微差异，而现有RAG系统虽然能获取上下文相关信息，但无法检索可比案例或相关问题，导致输出过于通用化。

Method: 在RAG系统之上构建了一个对比推理层，通过比较相似案例来生成更具上下文洞察力的分析。

Result: 该方法在文本生成指标（ROUGE和BERTScore）上优于基线RAG系统，与人工生成的股权研究和风险分析结果更接近。

Conclusion: 在RAG基础上增加对比推理层能有效提升专业领域推理的质量和针对性，生成更具上下文洞察力的分析结果。

Abstract: In specialized domains, humans often compare new problems against similar
examples, highlight nuances, and draw conclusions instead of analyzing
information in isolation. When applying reasoning in specialized contexts with
LLMs on top of a RAG, the pipeline can capture contextually relevant
information, but it is not designed to retrieve comparable cases or related
problems.
  While RAG is effective at extracting factual information, its outputs in
specialized reasoning tasks often remain generic, reflecting broad facts rather
than context-specific insights. In finance, it results in generic risks that
are true for the majority of companies. To address this limitation, we propose
a peer-aware comparative inference layer on top of RAG.
  Our contrastive approach outperforms baseline RAG in text generation metrics
such as ROUGE and BERTScore in comparison with human-generated equity research
and risk.

### [11] [Sample, Align, Synthesize: Graph-Based Response Synthesis with ConGrs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03527)
*Sayan Ghosh,Shahzaib Saqib Warraich,Dhruv Tarsadiya,Gregory Yauney,Swabha Swayamdipta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出共识图(ConGrs)数据结构，通过分析语言模型多次采样的响应来捕捉共享信息和语义变化，从而合成更准确、更可靠的最终响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法有效整合语言模型多次采样产生的丰富认知信号，特别是在长文本响应中捕捉语义变化和共享信息。

Method: 使用基于生物信息学的轻量级词序列对齐算法构建共识图，辅以辅助语言模型判断，并设计任务相关的解码方法从共识图中合成最终响应。

Result: 在传记生成任务中事实精度提升31%，减少对语言模型判断的依赖80%以上；在拒绝任务中弃权率提升56%；在数学推理任务中准确率提升6个百分点。

Conclusion: 共识图提供了一种灵活的方法来捕捉语言模型响应的变化，并利用响应变化提供的认知信号来合成更有效的响应。

Abstract: Language models can be sampled multiple times to access the distribution
underlying their responses, but existing methods cannot efficiently synthesize
rich epistemic signals across different long-form responses. We introduce
Consensus Graphs (ConGrs), a flexible DAG-based data structure that represents
shared information, as well as semantic variation in a set of sampled LM
responses to the same prompt. We construct ConGrs using a light-weight lexical
sequence alignment algorithm from bioinformatics, supplemented by the targeted
usage of a secondary LM judge. Further, we design task-dependent decoding
methods to synthesize a single, final response from our ConGr data structure.
Our experiments show that synthesizing responses from ConGrs improves factual
precision on two biography generation tasks by up to 31% over an average
response and reduces reliance on LM judges by more than 80% compared to other
methods. We also use ConGrs for three refusal-based tasks requiring abstention
on unanswerable queries and find that abstention rate is increased by up to
56%. We apply our approach to the MATH and AIME reasoning tasks and find an
improvement over self-verification and majority vote baselines by up to 6
points of accuracy. We show that ConGrs provide a flexible method for capturing
variation in LM responses and using the epistemic signals provided by response
variation to synthesize more effective responses.

### [12] [Fine-Tuning on Noisy Instructions: Effects on Generalization and Performance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03528)
*Ahmed Alajrami,Xingwei Tan,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究表明，在指令微调数据中引入扰动（如删除停用词、打乱词序）可以增强大语言模型对噪声指令的鲁棒性，有时甚至能提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究发现大语言模型对指令表述的微小变化很敏感，这影响了其在实际应用中的稳定性。本文旨在探索通过指令微调数据扰动来增强模型对噪声指令的抵抗能力。

Method: 在指令微调过程中引入扰动，包括删除停用词和打乱词序等方法，然后在MMLU、BBH、GSM8K等基准测试上评估模型在原始和扰动版本上的表现。

Result: 令人惊讶的是，在某些情况下，对扰动指令进行微调反而能提升下游任务性能，表明这种方法能增强模型对噪声用户输入的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 在指令微调中包含扰动指令非常重要，这能使大语言模型对噪声用户输入更具弹性，提高实际应用的稳定性。

Abstract: Instruction-tuning plays a vital role in enhancing the task-solving abilities
of large language models (LLMs), improving their usability in generating
helpful responses on various tasks. However, previous work has demonstrated
that they are sensitive to minor variations in instruction phrasing. In this
paper, we explore whether introducing perturbations in instruction-tuning data
can enhance LLMs' resistance against noisy instructions. We focus on how
instruction-tuning with perturbations, such as removing stop words or shuffling
words, affects LLMs' performance on the original and perturbed versions of
widely-used benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GSM8K). We further assess learning dynamics
and potential shifts in model behavior. Surprisingly, our results suggest that
instruction-tuning on perturbed instructions can, in some cases, improve
downstream performance. These findings highlight the importance of including
perturbed instructions in instruction-tuning, which can make LLMs more
resilient to noisy user inputs.

*Zhaohan Meng,Zaiqiao Meng,Siwei Liu,Iadh Ounis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TriMediQ是一个基于三元组结构的方法，将患者回答总结为三元组并整合到知识图谱中，通过多跳推理提升LLMs在医疗对话中的诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在静态单轮医疗问答中表现良好，但在实际临床咨询的迭代信息收集过程中可靠性显著下降，因为临床事实出现在没有明确联系的句子中。

Method: 使用冻结的三元组生成器提取临床相关三元组，通过训练投影模块（图编码器和投影器）从知识图谱捕获关系信息来增强专家推理。

Result: 在两个交互式QA基准测试中，TriMediQ在iMedQA数据集上比五个基线模型准确率提升高达10.4%。

Conclusion: 将患者回答转换为基于三元组的结构化图谱能够在多轮设置中实现更准确的临床推理，为基于LLM的医疗助手部署提供解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform strongly in static and single-turn
medical Question Answer (QA) benchmarks, yet such settings diverge from the
iterative information gathering process required in practical clinical
consultations. The MEDIQ framework addresses this mismatch by recasting the
diagnosis as an interactive dialogue between a patient and an expert system,
but the reliability of LLMs drops dramatically when forced to reason with
dialogue logs, where clinical facts appear in sentences without clear links. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TriMediQ, a triplet-structured approach that
summarises patient responses into triplets and integrates them into a Knowledge
Graph (KG), enabling multi-hop reasoning. We introduce a frozen triplet
generator that extracts clinically relevant triplets, using prompts designed to
ensure factual consistency. In parallel, a trainable projection module,
comprising a graph encoder and a projector, captures relational information
from the KG to enhance expert reasoning. TriMediQ operates in two steps: (i)
the projection module fine-tuning with all LLM weights frozen; and (ii) using
the fine-tuned module to guide multi-hop reasoning during inference. We
evaluate TriMediQ on two interactive QA benchmarks, showing that it achieves up
to 10.4\% improvement in accuracy over five baselines on the iMedQA dataset.
These results demonstrate that converting patient responses into structured
triplet-based graphs enables more accurate clinical reasoning in multi-turn
settings, providing a solution for the deployment of LLM-based medical
assistants.

### [14] [What is a protest anyway? Codebook conceptualization is still a first-order concern in LLM-era classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03541)
*Andrew Halterman,Katherine A. Keith*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文指出在计算社会科学中使用大语言模型进行文本分类时，概念化步骤常被忽视，导致概念化错误和下游估计偏差，且这种偏差无法仅通过提高LLM准确性或后处理偏误校正方法解决。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算社会科学中广泛使用生成式大语言模型进行文本分类，但研究人员往往忽视了分类前的概念化步骤和分类后的统计推断步骤，这可能导致严重的估计偏差。

Method: 通过模拟实验分析概念化错误对下游估计的影响，并测试提高LLM准确性和后处理偏误校正方法的有效性。

Result: 研究发现概念化引起的偏差无法仅通过提高LLM准确性或后处理偏误校正方法来纠正，概念化错误会持续影响下游估计。

Conclusion: 在LLM时代，概念化仍然是计算社会科学中的首要关注点，作者提供了实现低成本、无偏、低方差下游估计的具体建议。

Abstract: Generative large language models (LLMs) are now used extensively for text
classification in computational social science (CSS). In this work, focus on
the steps before and after LLM prompting -- conceptualization of concepts to be
classified and using LLM predictions in downstream statistical inference --
which we argue have been overlooked in much of LLM-era CSS. We claim LLMs can
tempt analysts to skip the conceptualization step, creating conceptualization
errors that bias downstream estimates. Using simulations, we show that this
conceptualization-induced bias cannot be corrected for solely by increasing LLM
accuracy or post-hoc bias correction methods. We conclude by reminding CSS
analysts that conceptualization is still a first-order concern in the LLM-era
and provide concrete advice on how to pursue low-cost, unbiased, low-variance
downstream estimates.

TL;DR: CCD-Bench是一个评估大语言模型在跨文化价值冲突中决策能力的基准测试，包含2,182个开放式的跨文化困境，覆盖七个领域，评估了17个非推理LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注文化知识、价值预测或单轴偏见诊断，但缺乏评估LLM在多种文化价值体系直接冲突时的裁决能力。

Method: 使用分层拉丁方设计呈现困境，每个困境配有十个匿名响应选项对应十个GLOBE文化集群，评估模型决策偏好和理由分析。

Result: 模型明显偏好北欧（20.2%）和日耳曼欧洲（12.4%），而东欧和中东/北非选项代表性不足（5.6-5.8%）。虽然87.9%的理由涉及多个GLOBE维度，但这种多元性是表面的。

Conclusion: 当前的对齐流程促进了共识导向的世界观，但无法充分处理需要权力协商、权利推理或性别意识分析的场景，需要开发能实质性参与多元世界观的策略。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) are increasingly implicated in
interpersonal and societal decision-making, their ability to navigate explicit
conflicts between legitimately different cultural value systems remains largely
unexamined. Existing benchmarks predominantly target cultural knowledge
(CulturalBench), value prediction (WorldValuesBench), or single-axis bias
diagnostics (CDEval); none evaluate how LLMs adjudicate when multiple
culturally grounded values directly clash. We address this gap with CCD-Bench,
a benchmark that assesses LLM decision-making under cross-cultural value
conflict. CCD-Bench comprises 2,182 open-ended dilemmas spanning seven domains,
each paired with ten anonymized response options corresponding to the ten GLOBE
cultural clusters. These dilemmas are presented using a stratified Latin square
to mitigate ordering effects. We evaluate 17 non-reasoning LLMs. Models
disproportionately prefer Nordic Europe (mean 20.2 percent) and Germanic Europe
(12.4 percent), while options for Eastern Europe and the Middle East and North
Africa are underrepresented (5.6 to 5.8 percent). Although 87.9 percent of
rationales reference multiple GLOBE dimensions, this pluralism is superficial:
models recombine Future Orientation and Performance Orientation, and rarely
ground choices in Assertiveness or Gender Egalitarianism (both under 3
percent). Ordering effects are negligible (Cramer's V less than 0.10), and
symmetrized KL divergence shows clustering by developer lineage rather than
geography. These patterns suggest that current alignment pipelines promote a
consensus-oriented worldview that underserves scenarios demanding power
negotiation, rights-based reasoning, or gender-aware analysis. CCD-Bench shifts
evaluation beyond isolated bias detection toward pluralistic decision making
and highlights the need for alignment strategies that substantively engage
diverse worldviews.

*Adam Filipek*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RxT是一种新型Transformer架构，通过事件驱动范式解决传统Transformer在对话AI中的状态缺失和二次计算复杂度问题，实现了线性扩展和实时长对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer在对话应用中存在状态缺失和二次计算复杂度问题，导致长对话成本高昂、延迟严重，需要新的架构来支持实时、状态保持的长对话。

Method: 采用事件驱动范式，将每个对话轮次作为离散事件处理，集成固定大小的短期记忆系统，通过生成器-解码器、记忆编码器和专用记忆注意网络异步更新记忆状态。

Result: RxT将对话总成本从二次方降低到线性，在合成数据实验中表现出优越性能和恒定时间推理延迟。

Conclusion: RxT通过解耦响应生成和记忆更新，实现了低延迟、状态保持且经济可行的长对话，为对话AI提供了新的架构方向。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become the de facto standard for Large
Language Models (LLMs), demonstrating remarkable capabilities in language
understanding and generation. However, its application in conversational AI is
fundamentally constrained by its stateless nature and the quadratic
computational complexity ($O(L^2)$) with respect to sequence length $L$.
Current models emulate memory by reprocessing an ever-expanding conversation
history with each turn, leading to prohibitive costs and latency in long
dialogues. This paper introduces the Reactive Transformer (RxT), a novel
architecture designed to overcome these limitations by shifting from a
data-driven to an event-driven paradigm. RxT processes each conversational turn
as a discrete event in real-time, maintaining context in an integrated,
fixed-size Short-Term Memory (STM) system. The architecture features a distinct
operational cycle where a generator-decoder produces a response based on the
current query and the previous memory state, after which a memory-encoder and a
dedicated Memory Attention network asynchronously update the STM with a
representation of the complete interaction. This design fundamentally alters
the scaling dynamics, reducing the total user-facing cost of a conversation
from quadratic ($O(N^2 \cdot T)$) to linear ($O(N \cdot T)$) with respect to
the number of interactions $N$. By decoupling response generation from memory
updates, RxT achieves low latency, enabling truly real-time, stateful, and
economically viable long-form conversations. We validated our architecture with
a series of proof-of-concept experiments on synthetic data, demonstrating
superior performance and constant-time inference latency compared to a baseline
stateless model of comparable size.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了在EvalLLM 2025挑战赛中针对法语生物医学命名实体识别和健康事件抽取的研究，提出了结合LLM、标注指南、合成数据和后处理的三种方法，GPT-4.1在少样本设置下表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决法语生物医学领域在极低资源场景下的命名实体识别和事件抽取问题，探索如何有效利用大型语言模型在少样本学习中的潜力。

Method: 1) 使用GPT-4.1进行上下文学习，自动选择10个示例并整合标注指南摘要；2) 在合成语料上微调GLiNER系统，并通过LLM进行后处理验证；3) 在相同合成语料上微调开源LLM LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct。事件抽取采用与NER相同的ICL策略。

Result: GPT-4.1在命名实体识别任务上获得61.53%的宏F1分数，在事件抽取任务上获得15.02%的宏F1分数，表现最佳。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示策略对于在极低资源场景下最大化模型性能至关重要，GPT-4.1在少样本法语生物医学信息抽取中展现了优越性能。

Abstract: This work presents our participation in the EvalLLM 2025 challenge on
biomedical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and health event extraction in French
(few-shot setting). For NER, we propose three approaches combining large
language models (LLMs), annotation guidelines, synthetic data, and
post-processing: (1) in-context learning (ICL) with GPT-4.1, incorporating
automatic selection of 10 examples and a summary of the annotation guidelines
into the prompt, (2) the universal NER system GLiNER, fine-tuned on a synthetic
corpus and then verified by an LLM in post-processing, and (3) the open LLM
LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct, fine-tuned on the same synthetic corpus. Event
extraction uses the same ICL strategy with GPT-4.1, reusing the guideline
summary in the prompt. Results show GPT-4.1 leads with a macro-F1 of 61.53% for
NER and 15.02% for event extraction, highlighting the importance of
well-crafted prompting to maximize performance in very low-resource scenarios.

### [18] [Decoupling Task-Solving and Output Formatting in LLM Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03595)
*Haikang Deng,Po-Nien Kung,Nanyun Peng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Deco-G是一个解码框架，通过将格式遵循与任务解决解耦，使用单独的概率模型处理格式合规性，让LLM专注于任务指令，从而提升复杂提示下的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着提示变得越来越复杂，模型往往难以同时遵循所有指令，特别是当推理指令与严格的格式要求交织在一起时，这种纠缠会为模型创建相互竞争的目标。

Method: Deco-G使用单独的可处理概率模型(TPM)处理格式合规性，同时仅向LLM提供任务指令。在每个解码步骤中，将LLM的下一个令牌概率与TPM计算的格式合规似然相结合。

Result: 在数学推理、LLM-as-a-judge和事件参数提取等多样化格式要求的任务中，Deco-G相对于常规提示方法实现了1.0%到6.0%的相对性能提升，并保证格式合规。

Conclusion: 通过明确分离格式遵循和任务解决，Deco-G框架能够显著提升LLM在复杂指令下的性能，同时确保格式要求的严格遵守。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adept at following instructions
containing task descriptions to solve complex problems, such as mathematical
reasoning and automatic evaluation (LLM-as-a-Judge). However, as prompts grow
more complex, models often struggle to adhere to all instructions. This
difficulty is especially common when instructive prompts intertwine reasoning
directives -- specifying what the model should solve -- with rigid formatting
requirements that dictate how the solution must be presented. The entanglement
creates competing goals for the model, suggesting that more explicit separation
of these two aspects could lead to improved performance. To this front, we
introduce Deco-G, a decoding framework that explicitly decouples format
adherence from task solving. Deco-G handles format compliance with a separate
tractable probabilistic model (TPM), while prompts LLMs with only task
instructions. At each decoding step, Deco-G combines next token probabilities
from the LLM with the TPM calculated format compliance likelihood to form the
output probability. To make this approach both practical and scalable for
modern instruction-tuned LLMs, we introduce three key innovations:
instruction-aware distillation, a flexible trie-building algorithm, and HMM
state pruning for computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
Deco-G across a wide range of tasks with diverse format requirements, including
mathematical reasoning, LLM-as-a-judge, and event argument extraction. Overall,
our approach yields 1.0% to 6.0% relative gain over regular prompting practice
with guaranteed format compliance.

*Raquib Bin Yousuf,Aadyant Khatri,Shengzhe Xu,Mandar Sharma,Naren Ramakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有评估基准在衡量LLMs的有效上下文长度和遗忘倾向方面存在不足，本文提出通过复杂的关系推理任务来更准确地评估模型性能，发现LLMs在关系推理中比现有基准显示更早出现记忆漂移和上下文遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准主要依赖简单的检索或续写任务，无法准确反映LLMs在信息密集场景中的真实表现，特别是对结构化关系知识的归纳能力。

Method: 通过让LLMs从包含噪声的自然语言内容中归纳图结构知识来评估，这些知识需要从分散的文本线索中推导，且上下文包含大量无关信息。

Result: 发现LLMs在关系推理任务中比现有基准显示更早出现记忆漂移和上下文遗忘，即使是专门用于推理的模型如OpenAI o1也容易受到早期记忆漂移的影响。

Conclusion: LLMs从非结构化输入中抽象结构化知识的能力存在显著局限性，需要架构改进来提升长距离推理能力。

Abstract: Recently proposed evaluation benchmarks aim to characterize the effective
context length and the forgetting tendencies of large language models (LLMs).
However, these benchmarks often rely on simplistic 'needle in a haystack'
retrieval or continuation tasks that may not accurately reflect the performance
of these models in information-dense scenarios. Thus, rather than simple next
token prediction, we argue for evaluating these models on more complex
reasoning tasks that requires them to induce structured relational knowledge
from the text - such as graphs from potentially noisy natural language content.
While the input text can be viewed as generated in terms of a graph, its
structure is not made explicit and connections must be induced from distributed
textual cues, separated by long contexts and interspersed with irrelevant
information. Our findings reveal that LLMs begin to exhibit memory drift and
contextual forgetting at much shorter effective lengths when tasked with this
form of relational reasoning, compared to what existing benchmarks suggest.
With these findings, we offer recommendations for the optimal use of popular
LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. We further show that even models specialized
for reasoning, such as OpenAI o1, remain vulnerable to early memory drift in
these settings. These results point to significant limitations in the models'
ability to abstract structured knowledge from unstructured input and highlight
the need for architectural adaptations to improve long-range reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于音节级别的无监督语音识别框架，使用掩码语言建模方法，避免了传统方法对G2P转换器的依赖和GAN训练不稳定的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督语音识别中传统方法依赖昂贵资源（如G2P转换器）以及在模糊音素边界语言中训练不稳定的问题。

Method: 基于掩码语言建模的音节级别无监督语音识别框架，不使用G2P转换器和GAN方法。

Result: 在LibriSpeech上实现了40%的相对字符错误率降低，并在普通话等困难语言上表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言的语音识别提供了有效解决方案，避免了传统方法的资源依赖和训练不稳定问题。

Abstract: Training speech recognizers with unpaired speech and text -- known as
unsupervised speech recognition (UASR) -- is a crucial step toward extending
ASR to low-resource languages in the long-tail distribution and enabling
multimodal learning from non-parallel data. However, existing approaches based
on phones often rely on costly resources such as grapheme-to-phoneme converters
(G2Ps) and struggle to generalize to languages with ambiguous phoneme
boundaries due to training instability. In this paper, we address both
challenges by introducing a syllable-level UASR framework based on masked
language modeling, which avoids the need for G2P and the instability of
GAN-based methods. Our approach achieves up to a 40\% relative reduction in
character error rate (CER) on LibriSpeech and generalizes effectively to
Mandarin, a language that has remained particularly difficult for prior
methods. Code will be released upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UniDoc-Bench是首个大规模、真实的MM-RAG基准测试，基于70k真实PDF页面构建，包含1,600个多模态QA对，支持四种范式的公平比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MM-RAG评估存在碎片化问题，要么单独评估文本或图像，要么使用简化的多模态设置，无法捕捉文档中心的多模态用例。

Method: 从8个领域的70k真实PDF页面中提取并链接文本、表格和图像证据，生成1,600个多模态QA对，涵盖事实检索、比较、总结和逻辑推理查询，20%经过多标注者验证和专家裁决。

Result: 实验表明多模态文本-图像融合RAG系统始终优于单模态和联合多模态嵌入检索，表明仅文本或图像都不足够，当前多模态嵌入仍不足够。

Conclusion: 该基准测试不仅用于评估，还揭示了视觉上下文何时以及如何补充文本证据，发现了系统性失败模式，并为开发更健壮的MM-RAG管道提供了可行指导。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for
applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases,
yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in
isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture
document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce
UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from
70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links
evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA
pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical
reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by
multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports
apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2)
image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint
retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools,
prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal
text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly
multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images
alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate.
Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context
complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers
actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于QLoRA的微调框架，用于改进罗马乌尔都语-英语混合文本中的冒犯性语言检测，通过翻译处理低资源输入，Meta LLaMA 3 8B模型取得最佳F1分数91.45。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罗马乌尔都语等代码混合语言中的贬义词使用给NLP系统带来挑战，包括未明确的语法、不一致的拼写和标记数据稀缺。

Method: 使用Google Translate将罗马乌尔都语-英语混合数据集翻译为英语，利用QLoRA对多个transformer和大型语言模型进行内存高效的微调，包括Meta LLaMA 3 8B、Mistral 7B等。

Result: 在所有测试模型中，Meta LLaMA 3 8B获得最高F1分数91.45，Mistral 7B为89.66，均超越传统transformer基线。

Conclusion: 证明了QLoRA在低资源环境下微调高性能模型的有效性，确认了LLMs在此任务中的潜力，为基于LLMs的多语言冒犯检测系统铺平道路。

Abstract: The use of derogatory terms in languages that employ code mixing, such as
Roman Urdu, presents challenges for Natural Language Processing systems due to
unstated grammar, inconsistent spelling, and a scarcity of labeled data. In
this work, we propose a QLoRA based fine tuning framework to improve offensive
language detection in Roman Urdu-English text. We translated the Roman
Urdu-English code mixed dataset into English using Google Translate to leverage
English LLMs, while acknowledging that this translation reduces direct
engagement with code mixing features. Our focus is on classification
performance using English translated low resource inputs. We fine tuned several
transformers and large language models, including Meta LLaMA 3 8B, Mistral 7B
v0.1, LLaMA 2 7B, ModernBERT, and RoBERTa, with QLoRA for memory efficient
adaptation. Models were trained and evaluated on a manually annotated Roman
Urdu dataset for offensive vs non offensive content. Of all tested models, the
highest F1 score of 91.45 was attained by Meta LLaMA 3 8B, followed by Mistral
7B at 89.66, surpassing traditional transformer baselines. These results
demonstrate the efficacy of QLoRA in fine tuning high performing models for low
resource environments such as code mixed offensive language detection, and
confirm the potential of LLMs for this task. This work advances a scalable
approach to Roman Urdu moderation and paves the way for future multilingual
offensive detection systems based on LLMs.

TL;DR: MedReflect是一个通用框架，通过模拟医生反思思维模式，让LLMs在医学问题解决中进行自我验证和反思，无需外部检索或大量标注，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖外部知识检索或大量标注数据，存在检索开销大、标注成本高的问题，且性能有限。需要一种更高效的方法来激发LLMs在医学领域的潜力。

Method: MedReflect框架生成单次反思链，包括初始假设生成、自我提问、自我回答和决策优化，实现自我验证和自我反思。

Result: 仅用2000个随机训练样本和轻量微调，就在多个医学基准上取得显著准确率提升，大幅减少标注需求。

Conclusion: LLMs可以通过自我反思和自我改进学习解决专业医学问题，减少对外部监督和大量任务特定微调数据的依赖。

Abstract: Medical problem solving demands expert knowledge and intricate reasoning.
Recent studies of large language models (LLMs) attempt to ease this complexity
by introducing external knowledge verification through retrieval-augmented
generation or by training on reasoning datasets. However, these approaches
suffer from drawbacks such as retrieval overhead and high annotation costs, and
they heavily rely on substituted external assistants to reach limited
performance in medical field. In this paper, we introduce MedReflect, a
generalizable framework designed to inspire LLMs with a physician-like
reflective thinking mode. MedReflect generates a single-pass reflection chain
that includes initial hypothesis generation, self-questioning, self-answering
and decision refinement. This self-verified and self-reflective nature releases
large language model's latent capability in medical problem-solving without
external retrieval or heavy annotation. We demonstrate that MedReflect enables
cost-efficient medical dataset construction: with merely 2,000 randomly sampled
training examples and a light fine-tuning, this approach achieves notable
absolute accuracy improvements across a series of medical benchmarks while
cutting annotation requirements. Our results provide evidence that LLMs can
learn to solve specialized medical problems via self-reflection and
self-improve, reducing reliance on external supervision and extensive
task-specific fine-tuning data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的示例选择方法主要关注查询与示例的相似性，但忽略了示例的质量问题，这限制了少样本提示在机器翻译中的效果提升。

Method: 提出TreePrompt方法，在树状结构框架中学习LLM偏好来识别高质量示例；结合K-NN和自适应少样本提示(AFSP)来平衡相似性与质量。

Result: 在英语-波斯语(MIZAN)和英语-德语(WMT19)两个语言对上的评估表明，TreePrompt与AFSP或随机选择结合能提高翻译性能。

Conclusion: TreePrompt通过考虑示例质量和LLM偏好，有效提升了少样本提示在机器翻译中的表现，证明了平衡相似性与质量的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have consistently demonstrated strong
performance in machine translation, especially when guided by high-quality
prompts. Few-shot prompting is an effective technique to improve translation
quality; however, most existing example selection methods focus solely on
query-to-example similarity and do not account for the quality of the examples.
In this work, we propose TreePrompt, a novel example selection approach that
learns LLM preferences to identify high-quality, contextually relevant examples
within a tree-structured framework. To further explore the balance between
similarity and quality, we combine TreePrompt with K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
and Adaptive Few-Shot Prompting (AFSP). Evaluations on two language pairs -
English-Persian (MIZAN) and English-German (WMT19) - show that integrating
TreePrompt with AFSP or Random selection leads to improved translation
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语音细粒度分析的帕金森病多语言检测方法，通过分析音素、音节和单词级别的语音特征，发现音素级分析在跨语言PD检测中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于语音的PD检测系统分析整个话语，可能忽略了特定语音元素的诊断价值。PD影响全球超过1000万人，其中高达89%的患者存在语音障碍。

Method: 开发了自动化的细粒度感知方法，从录音中提取时间对齐的音素、音节和单词。使用意大利语、西班牙语和英语数据集，采用双向LSTM与多头注意力机制比较不同粒度级别的诊断性能。

Result: 音素级分析表现最优，AUROC达到93.78% ± 2.34%，准确率达到92.17% ± 2.43%。注意力分析显示最有信息的语音特征与临床协议一致：音素级的持续元音、音节级的交替运动音节和单词级的/pataka/序列。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了跨语言PD检测的诊断能力，证明了细粒度语音分析在PD检测中的价值。

Abstract: Parkinson's Disease (PD) affects over 10 million people worldwide, with
speech impairments in up to 89% of patients. Current speech-based detection
systems analyze entire utterances, potentially overlooking the diagnostic value
of specific phonetic elements. We developed a granularity-aware approach for
multilingual PD detection using an automated pipeline that extracts
time-aligned phonemes, syllables, and words from recordings. Using Italian,
Spanish, and English datasets, we implemented a bidirectional LSTM with
multi-head attention to compare diagnostic performance across the different
granularity levels. Phoneme-level analysis achieved superior performance with
AUROC of 93.78% +- 2.34% and accuracy of 92.17% +- 2.43%. This demonstrates
enhanced diagnostic capability for cross-linguistic PD detection. Importantly,
attention analysis revealed that the most informative speech features align
with those used in established clinical protocols: sustained vowels (/a/, /e/,
/o/, /i/) at phoneme level, diadochokinetic syllables (/ta/, /pa/, /la/, /ka/)
at syllable level, and /pataka/ sequences at word level. Source code will be

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，少样本提示技术因其实用性和有效性受到广泛关注。本研究旨在调查少样本提示策略如何影响词义消歧任务，特别关注样本分布不平衡引入的偏见问题。

Method: 使用GLOSSGPT提示方法，在英语、德语、西班牙语、法语和意大利语五种语言中测试词义消歧效果。评估了GPT-4o和LLaMA-3.1-70B模型的行为表现。

Result: 结果显示不平衡的少样本示例会导致多语言词义消歧错误预测，但英语中未出现此问题。多语言词义消歧对少样本设置中的样本分布非常敏感。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在多语言词义消歧任务中需要采用平衡且具有代表性的提示策略，以确保模型性能的稳定性和准确性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly reshaped
the landscape of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Among the various prompting
techniques, few-shot prompting has gained considerable attention for its
practicality and effectiveness. This study investigates how few-shot prompting
strategies impact the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) task, particularly
focusing on the biases introduced by imbalanced sample distributions. We use
the GLOSSGPT prompting method, an advanced approach for English WSD, to test
its effectiveness across five languages: English, German, Spanish, French, and
Italian. Our results show that imbalanced few-shot examples can cause incorrect
sense predictions in multilingual languages, but this issue does not appear in
English. To assess model behavior, we evaluate both the GPT-4o and
LLaMA-3.1-70B models and the results highlight the sensitivity of multilingual
WSD to sample distribution in few-shot settings, emphasizing the need for
balanced and representative prompting strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents the development of Rezwan, a large-scale AI-assisted
Hadith corpus comprising over 1.2M narrations, extracted and structured through
a fully automated pipeline. Building on digital repositories such as Maktabat
Ahl al-Bayt, the pipeline employs Large Language Models (LLMs) for
segmentation, chain--text separation, validation, and multi-layer enrichment.
Each narration is enhanced with machine translation into twelve languages,
intelligent diacritization, abstractive summarization, thematic tagging, and
cross-text semantic analysis. This multi-step process transforms raw text into
a richly annotated research-ready infrastructure for digital humanities and
Islamic studies. A rigorous evaluation was conducted on 1,213 randomly sampled
narrations, assessed by six domain experts. Results show near-human accuracy in
structured tasks such as chain--text separation (9.33/10) and summarization
(9.33/10), while highlighting ongoing challenges in diacritization and semantic
similarity detection. Comparative analysis against the manually curated Noor
Corpus demonstrates the superiority of Najm in both scale and quality, with a
mean overall score of 8.46/10 versus 3.66/10. Furthermore, cost analysis
confirms the economic feasibility of the AI approach: tasks requiring over
229,000 hours of expert labor were completed within months at a fraction of the
cost. The work introduces a new paradigm in religious text processing by
showing how AI can augment human expertise, enabling large-scale, multilingual,
and semantically enriched access to Islamic heritage.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究大语言模型生成和识别深度认知框架的能力，特别是在社会政治语境中。发现LLMs能流畅生成唤起特定框架的文本，并在零样本设置中识别这些框架。通过机制可解释性研究，定位了模型隐藏表示中与'严格父亲'和'养育父母'框架相关的特定维度。

Motivation: 探索大语言模型如何捕捉和表达有意义的认知框架，特别是在社会政治语境中，以理解模型内部如何表示人类概念。

Method: 采用机制可解释性研究方法，分析模型隐藏表示中的特定维度，研究'严格父亲'和'养育父母'框架在模型中的定位。

Result: LLMs能够流畅生成唤起特定认知框架的文本，并在零样本设置中有效识别这些框架。发现了与特定框架强烈相关的单一维度。

Conclusion: 研究为理解大语言模型如何捕捉和表达有意义的人类概念提供了重要见解，揭示了认知框架在模型内部表示中的具体位置。

Abstract: This paper explores the ability of large language models to generate and
recognize deep cognitive frames, particularly in socio-political contexts. We
demonstrate that LLMs are highly fluent in generating texts that evoke specific
frames and can recognize these frames in zero-shot settings. Inspired by
mechanistic interpretability research, we investigate the location of the
`strict father' and `nurturing parent' frames within the model's hidden
representation, identifying singular dimensions that correlate strongly with
their presence. Our findings contribute to understanding how LLMs capture and
express meaningful human concepts.

### [29] [Beyond Token Length: Step Pruner for Efficient and Accurate Reasoning in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03805)
*Canhui Wu,Qiong Cao,Chang Li,Zhenfang Wang,Chao Xue,Yuwei Fan,Wei Xi,Xiaodong He*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Step Pruner (SP)是一个RL框架，通过惩罚冗余推理步骤来减少大型推理模型的过度思考问题，在保持准确性的同时显著降低响应长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RL的方法通过惩罚生成token来促进简洁性，但存在两个问题：更少的token不一定对应更少的推理步骤，模型可能在训练后期通过丢弃推理步骤来最小化token使用。

Method: 提出Step Pruner框架，使用步骤感知的奖励函数，在保持正确性的同时惩罚冗余步骤；提出动态停止机制，当输出步骤长度超过上限时停止更新以防止步骤合并的hacking行为。

Result: 在四个推理基准测试上的实验表明，SP实现了最先进的准确性，同时显著减少响应长度。在AIME24上，token使用减少了69.7%。

Conclusion: SP框架有效解决了大型推理模型的过度思考问题，通过步骤级别的优化实现了推理效率的显著提升。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate strong performance on complex tasks
but often suffer from excessive verbosity, known as "overthinking." Existing
solutions via reinforcement learning (RL) typically penalize generated tokens
to promote conciseness. However, these methods encounter two challenges:
responses with fewer tokens do not always correspond to fewer reasoning steps,
and models may develop hacking behavior in later stages of training by
discarding reasoning steps to minimize token usage. In this work, we introduce
\textbf{Step Pruner (SP)}, an RL framework that steers LRMs toward more
efficient reasoning by favoring compact reasoning steps. Our step-aware reward
function prioritizes correctness while imposing penalties for redundant steps,
and withholds rewards for incorrect responses to prevent the reinforcement of
erroneous reasoning. Moreover, we propose a dynamic stopping mechanism: when
the length of any output step exceeds the upper limit, we halt updates to
prevent hacking behavior caused by merging steps. Extensive experiments across
four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SP achieves state-of-the-art
accuracy while significantly reducing response length. For instance, on AIME24,
SP reduces token usage by \textbf{69.7\%}.

*Nusrat Jahan Lia,Shubhashis Roy Dipta,Abdullah Khan Zehady,Naymul Islam,Madhusodan Chakraborty,Abdullah Al Wasif*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个孟加拉语政治立场检测基准数据集，包含200篇新闻文章，标注了政府倾向、政府批评和中立立场。评估了28个大语言模型，发现模型在检测政府批评内容时表现良好，但在识别中立文章时存在困难，且倾向于过度预测政府倾向立场。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 南亚地区的媒体偏见检测至关重要，但孟加拉语政治偏见研究的标注数据集和计算研究仍然稀缺。孟加拉语新闻的政治立场检测需要理解语言线索、文化背景、微妙偏见、修辞策略、语码转换、隐含情感和社会政治背景。

Method: 构建了包含200篇政治重要性高且争议性强的孟加拉语新闻文章的数据集，标注了政府倾向、政府批评和中立三种立场。对28个专有和开源大语言模型进行了全面评估，包括诊断分析。

Result: 模型在检测政府批评内容方面表现强劲（F1最高达0.83），但在识别中立文章时存在显著困难（F1最低为0.00）。模型倾向于过度预测政府倾向立场，经常误解模糊叙述。

Conclusion: 该数据集及其相关诊断分析为推进孟加拉语媒体立场检测研究奠定了基础，并为改善大语言模型在低资源语言中的性能提供了见解。

Abstract: Detecting media bias is crucial, specifically in the South Asian region.
Despite this, annotated datasets and computational studies for Bangla political
bias research remain scarce. Crucially because, political stance detection in
Bangla news requires understanding of linguistic cues, cultural context, subtle
biases, rhetorical strategies, code-switching, implicit sentiment, and
socio-political background. To address this, we introduce the first benchmark
dataset of 200 politically significant and highly debated Bangla news articles,
labeled for government-leaning, government-critique, and neutral stances,
alongside diagnostic analyses for evaluating large language models (LLMs). Our
comprehensive evaluation of 28 proprietary and open-source LLMs shows strong
performance in detecting government-critique content (F1 up to 0.83) but
substantial difficulty with neutral articles (F1 as low as 0.00). Models also
tend to over-predict government-leaning stances, often misinterpreting
ambiguous narratives. This dataset and its associated diagnostics provide a
foundation for advancing stance detection in Bangla media research and offer
insights for improving LLM performance in low-resource languages.

TL;DR: PsychoLexTherapy是一个基于小型语言模型的波斯语心理治疗推理框架，通过结构化记忆实现文化适应的多轮对话，支持本地部署保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在代表性不足语言中开发文化基础、治疗连贯且具有结构化记忆的多轮对话系统的挑战，同时确保隐私保护和本地部署可行性。

Method: 三阶段开发过程：1) 使用PsychoLexEval评估SLMs心理学知识；2) 设计实现推理导向的PsychoLexTherapy框架；3) 构建两个评估数据集进行基准测试。

Result: 在单轮评估中优于所有基线方法，在多轮测试中结构化记忆模块至关重要，完整框架在共情、连贯性、文化适应和个性化方面获得最高评分。

Conclusion: PsychoLexTherapy为波斯语心理治疗模拟建立了实用、隐私保护和文化适应的基础，贡献了新颖数据集、可复现评估流程和结构化记忆的实证见解。

Abstract: This study presents PsychoLexTherapy, a framework for simulating
psychotherapeutic reasoning in Persian using small language models (SLMs). The
framework tackles the challenge of developing culturally grounded,
therapeutically coherent dialogue systems with structured memory for multi-turn
interactions in underrepresented languages. To ensure privacy and feasibility,
PsychoLexTherapy is optimized for on-device deployment, enabling use without
external servers. Development followed a three-stage process: (i) assessing
SLMs psychological knowledge with PsychoLexEval; (ii) designing and
implementing the reasoning-oriented PsychoLexTherapy framework; and (iii)
constructing two evaluation datasets-PsychoLexQuery (real Persian user
questions) and PsychoLexDialogue (hybrid simulated sessions)-to benchmark
against multiple baselines. Experiments compared simple prompting, multi-agent
debate, and structured therapeutic reasoning paths. Results showed that
deliberate model selection balanced accuracy, efficiency, and privacy. On
PsychoLexQuery, PsychoLexTherapy outperformed all baselines in automatic
LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and was ranked highest by human evaluators in a
single-turn preference study. In multi-turn tests with PsychoLexDialogue, the
long-term memory module proved essential: while naive history concatenation
caused incoherence and information loss, the full framework achieved the
highest ratings in empathy, coherence, cultural fit, and personalization.
Overall, PsychoLexTherapy establishes a practical, privacy-preserving, and
culturally aligned foundation for Persian psychotherapy simulation,
contributing novel datasets, a reproducible evaluation pipeline, and empirical
insights into structured memory for therapeutic reasoning.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于大语言模型的流水线，从410万条患者评论中提取医生的五大性格特质和患者主观判断，验证了方法的有效性，并揭示了全国范围的系统性模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解患者对医生的看法对于改善信任、沟通和满意度至关重要，需要大规模分析患者评论来获取可解释的医生特质指标。

Method: 使用LLM流水线从410万条患者评论中推断五大性格特质和五个患者导向的主观判断，通过多模型比较和人类专家基准验证方法。

Result: 人类与LLM评估达成强一致性（相关系数0.72-0.89），与患者满意度具有外部效度（r=0.41-0.81），发现男性医生在所有特质上评分更高，儿科和精神病学中同理心相关特质占主导。

Conclusion: 从患者叙述中自动提取特质可以提供可解释、经过验证的指标，用于大规模理解医患关系，对医疗质量测量、偏见检测和劳动力发展具有意义。

Abstract: Understanding how patients perceive their physicians is essential to
improving trust, communication, and satisfaction. We present a large language
model (LLM)-based pipeline that infers Big Five personality traits and five
patient-oriented subjective judgments. The analysis encompasses 4.1 million
patient reviews of 226,999 U.S. physicians from an initial pool of one million.
We validate the method through multi-model comparison and human expert
benchmarking, achieving strong agreement between human and LLM assessments
(correlation coefficients 0.72-0.89) and external validity through correlations
with patient satisfaction (r = 0.41-0.81, all p<0.001). National-scale analysis
reveals systematic patterns: male physicians receive higher ratings across all
traits, with largest disparities in clinical competence perceptions;
empathy-related traits predominate in pediatrics and psychiatry; and all traits
positively predict overall satisfaction. Cluster analysis identifies four
distinct physician archetypes, from "Well-Rounded Excellent" (33.8%, uniformly
high traits) to "Underperforming" (22.6%, consistently low). These findings
demonstrate that automated trait extraction from patient narratives can provide
interpretable, validated metrics for understanding physician-patient
relationships at scale, with implications for quality measurement, bias
detection, and workforce development in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多局限于单轮提示下的LLM欺骗评估，无法捕捉欺骗策略在长期交互中的展开过程，需要开发能够模拟真实世界信任敏感场景的评估框架。

Method: 构建多智能体系统：执行者智能体完成任务，监督者智能体评估进展并提供反馈，独立欺骗审计员审查完整轨迹以识别欺骗行为。在11个前沿模型上进行广泛实验。

Result: 欺骗行为具有模型依赖性，随着事件压力增加而增多，并持续侵蚀监督者信任。定性分析揭示了隐瞒、模棱两可和伪造等不同欺骗策略。

Conclusion: 欺骗是长期交互中出现的风险，该研究为评估未来LLM在真实世界信任敏感环境中的表现奠定了基础。

Abstract: Deception is a pervasive feature of human communication and an emerging
concern in large language models (LLMs). While recent studies document
instances of LLM deception under pressure, most evaluations remain confined to
single-turn prompts and fail to capture the long-horizon interactions in which
deceptive strategies typically unfold. We introduce the first simulation
framework for probing and evaluating deception in LLMs under extended sequences
of interdependent tasks and dynamic contextual pressures. Our framework
instantiates a multi-agent system: a performer agent tasked with completing
tasks and a supervisor agent that evaluates progress, provides feedback, and
maintains evolving states of trust. An independent deception auditor then
reviews full trajectories to identify when and how deception occurs. We conduct
extensive experiments across 11 frontier models, spanning both closed- and
open-source systems, and find that deception is model-dependent, increases with
event pressure, and consistently erodes supervisor trust. Qualitative analyses
further reveal distinct strategies of concealment, equivocation, and
falsification. Our findings establish deception as an emergent risk in
long-horizon interactions and provide a foundation for evaluating future LLMs
in real-world, trust-sensitive contexts.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效解决COVID-19命名实体识别的挑战，在生物医学NER任务中具有通用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic causes severe social and economic disruption around the
world, raising various subjects that are discussed over social media.
Identifying pandemic-related named entities as expressed on social media is
fundamental and important to understand the discussions about the pandemic.
However, there is limited work on named entity recognition on this topic due to
the following challenges: 1) COVID-19 texts in social media are informal and
their annotations are rare and insufficient to train a robust recognition
model, and 2) named entity recognition in COVID-19 requires extensive
domain-specific knowledge. To address these issues, we propose a novel entity
knowledge augmentation approach for COVID-19, which can also be applied in
general biomedical named entity recognition in both informal text format and
formal text format. Experiments carried out on the COVID-19 tweets dataset and
PubMed dataset show that our proposed entity knowledge augmentation improves
NER performance in both fully-supervised and few-shot settings. Our source code

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in multimodal large language models, agricultural
applications remain constrained by the scarcity of domain-tailored models,
curated vision-language corpora, and rigorous evaluation. To address these
challenges, we present the AgriGPT-VL Suite, a unified multimodal framework for
agriculture. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce Agri-3M-VL,
the largest vision-language corpus for agriculture to our knowledge, curated by
a scalable multi-agent data generator; it comprises 1M image-caption pairs, 2M
image-grounded VQA pairs, 50K expert-level VQA instances, and 15K GRPO
reinforcement learning samples. Second, we develop AgriGPT-VL, an
agriculture-specialized vision-language model trained via a progressive
curriculum of textual grounding, multimodal shallow/deep alignment, and GRPO
refinement. This method achieves strong multimodal reasoning while preserving
text-only capability. Third, we establish AgriBench-VL-4K, a compact yet
challenging evaluation suite with open-ended and image-grounded questions,
paired with multi-metric evaluation and an LLM-as-a-judge framework.
Experiments show that AgriGPT-VL outperforms leading general-purpose VLMs on
AgriBench-VL-4K, achieving higher pairwise win rates in the LLM-as-a-judge
evaluation. Meanwhile, it remains competitive on the text-only AgriBench-13K
with no noticeable degradation of language ability. Ablation studies further
confirm consistent gains from our alignment and GRPO refinement stages. We will
open source all of the resources to support reproducible research and
deployment in low-resource agricultural settings.

TL;DR: 该研究利用可解释性方法，通过分析大语言模型的激活状态来预测输出正确性，并探索模型内部信号如何反映外部上下文的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型具有巨大效用，但可信度仍是主要问题：模型经常以高置信度生成错误信息。虽然上下文信息可以指导生成，但识别何时查询需要检索的上下文以及评估该上下文的有效性仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用可解释性方法，通过分析模型激活状态来预测输出正确性。训练基于第一个输出token中间层激活的简单分类器，并引入指标来区分正确、错误和不相关的上下文。

Result: 在六个不同模型上的实验表明，基于第一个输出token中间层激活的简单分类器可以以约75%的准确率预测输出正确性，实现早期审计。基于模型内部的指标在区分正确和错误上下文方面显著优于提示基线。

Conclusion: 这些发现提供了一个视角，可以更好地理解大语言模型的底层决策过程，为防范被污染上下文引入的不准确性提供了保护机制。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have tremendous utility,
trustworthiness is still a chief concern: models often generate incorrect
information with high confidence. While contextual information can help guide
generation, identifying when a query would benefit from retrieved context and
assessing the effectiveness of that context remains challenging. In this work,
we operationalize interpretability methods to ascertain whether we can predict
the correctness of model outputs from the model's activations alone. We also
explore whether model internals contain signals about the efficacy of external
context. We consider correct, incorrect, and irrelevant context and introduce
metrics to distinguish amongst them. Experiments on six different models reveal
that a simple classifier trained on intermediate layer activations of the first
output token can predict output correctness with about 75% accuracy, enabling
early auditing. Our model-internals-based metric significantly outperforms
prompting baselines at distinguishing between correct and incorrect context,
guarding against inaccuracies introduced by polluted context. These findings
offer a lens to better understand the underlying decision-making processes of
LLMs. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: 该工作建立了泰语EOT检测基准，证明小型微调模型可实现适合设备端代理的快速端点检测，并提供了公开可用的实现方案。

Abstract: Fluid voice-to-voice interaction requires reliable and low-latency detection
of when a user has finished speaking. Traditional audio-silence end-pointers
add hundreds of milliseconds of delay and fail under hesitations or
language-specific phenomena. We present, to our knowledge, the first systematic
study of Thai text-only end-of-turn (EOT) detection for real-time agents. We
compare zero-shot and few-shot prompting of compact LLMs to supervised
fine-tuning of lightweight transformers. Using transcribed subtitles from the
YODAS corpus and Thai-specific linguistic cues (e.g., sentence-final
particles), we formulate EOT as a binary decision over token boundaries. We
report a clear accuracy-latency tradeoff and provide a public-ready
implementation plan. This work establishes a Thai baseline and demonstrates
that small, fine-tuned models can deliver near-instant EOT decisions suitable
for on-device agents.

Motivation: 由于大语言模型通常是黑盒且调用成本高昂，需要开发有效的方法来解释其分类决策。

Method: 引入反事实推理到LLM决策过程中，提出了决策变化率框架来量化关键词对分类结果的影响程度。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用反事实推理有助于识别对分类决策贡献最大的关键词。

Conclusion: 反事实推理是解释大语言模型分类决策的有效方法，决策变化率框架能够量化关键词的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful in many domains due to their
impressive abilities that arise from large training datasets and large model
sizes. More recently, they have been shown to be very effective in textual
classification tasks, motivating the need to explain the LLMs' decisions.
Motivated by practical constrains where LLMs are black-boxed and LLM calls are
expensive, we study how incorporating counterfactuals into LLM reasoning can
affect the LLM's ability to identify the top words that have contributed to its
classification decision. To this end, we introduce a framework called the
decision changing rate that helps us quantify the importance of the top words
in classification. Our experimental results show that using counterfactuals can
be helpful.

Result: 实验结果显示，通用领域的SLMs在多个医学基准测试中意外地优于经过医学微调的SLMs，这表明对于急诊科应用，专门的医学模型微调可能不是必需的。

Conclusion: 在急诊科决策支持场景中，通用领域的小型语言模型表现优于医学专用模型，这挑战了传统认为需要专门医学微调的观点，为实际部署提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly popular in medical
domains to assist physicians with a variety of clinical and operational tasks.
Given the fast-paced and high-stakes environment of emergency departments
(EDs), small language models (SLMs), characterized by a reduction in parameter
count compared to LLMs, offer significant potential due to their inherent
reasoning capability and efficient performance. This enables SLMs to support
physicians by providing timely and accurate information synthesis, thereby
improving clinical decision-making and workflow efficiency. In this paper, we
present a comprehensive benchmark designed to identify SLMs suited for ED
decision support, taking into account both specialized medical expertise and
broad general problem-solving capabilities. In our evaluations, we focus on
SLMs that have been trained on a mixture of general-domain and medical corpora.
A key motivation for emphasizing SLMs is the practical hardware limitations,
operational cost constraints, and privacy concerns in the typical real-world
deployments. Our benchmark datasets include MedMCQA, MedQA-4Options, and
PubMedQA, with the medical abstracts dataset emulating tasks aligned with real
ED physicians' daily tasks. Experimental results reveal that general-domain
SLMs surprisingly outperform their medically fine-tuned counterparts across
these diverse benchmarks for ED. This indicates that for ED, specialized
medical fine-tuning of the model may not be required.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained to reflect a relatively
uniform set of values, which limits their applicability to tasks that require
understanding of nuanced human perspectives. Recent research has underscored
the importance of enabling LLMs to support steerable pluralism -- the capacity
to adopt a specific perspective and align generated outputs with it. In this
work, we investigate whether Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning techniques can be
applied to building steerable pluralistic models. We explore several methods,
including CoT prompting, fine-tuning on human-authored CoT, fine-tuning on
synthetic explanations, and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR). We evaluate these approaches using the Value Kaleidoscope and OpinionQA
datasets. Among the methods studied, RLVR consistently outperforms others and
demonstrates strong training sample efficiency. We further analyze the
generated CoT traces with respect to faithfulness and safety.

Motivation: 探索扩散语言模型在有限数据约束下实现显著数据效率的潜在机制。

Method: 进行广泛的消融实验，分析随机掩码、MLP dropout和权重衰减等因素对数据效率的影响。

Result: 随机掩码输入标记是数据效率提升的主要因素，类似效果可通过其他随机正则化方法实现。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that diffusion language models achieve remarkable
data efficiency under limited-data constraints, yet the underlying mechanisms
remain unclear. In this work, we perform extensive ablation experiments to
disentangle the sources of this efficiency. Our results show that random
masking of input tokens plays the dominant role. We further show that similar
gains can be obtained through in MLP dropout and weight decay, indicating that
stochastic regularization broadly enhances data efficiency in multi-epoch
training. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PoLi-RL是一个新颖的强化学习框架，通过两阶段课程学习和并行切片排名奖励机制，成功将强化学习应用于条件语义文本相似性任务，在C-STS基准上达到48.18的Spearman相关系数，创下新纪录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有C-STS方法主要局限于判别模型，未能充分利用LLM和RL的最新进展。RL特别适合该任务，因为它可以直接优化不可微的Spearman排名指标并指导推理过程。

Method: 提出PoLi-RL框架，采用两阶段课程学习：先用简单的逐点奖励训练基本评分能力，然后转向结合逐点、成对和列表目标的混合奖励。关键创新是并行切片排名奖励机制，在并行切片中计算排名奖励。

Result: 在官方C-STS基准上达到48.18的Spearman相关系数，为交叉编码器架构建立了新的SOTA。

Conclusion: 这是首个成功将RL应用于C-STS的工作，为在复杂、基于排名的条件判断任务上训练LLM引入了强大而精确的范式。

Abstract: Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) measures the semantic
proximity between text segments under a specific condition, thereby overcoming
the ambiguity inherent in traditional STS. However, existing methods are
largely confined to discriminative models, failing to fully integrate recent
breakthroughs in the NLP community concerning Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL is a particularly well-suited paradigm for this
task, as it can directly optimize the non-differentiable Spearman ranking
metric and guide the reasoning process required by C-STS. However, we find that
naively applying listwise RL fails to produce meaningful improvements, as the
model is overwhelmed by complex, coarse-grained reward signals. To address this
challenge, we introduce PoLi-RL, a novel Point-to-List Reinforcement Learning
framework. PoLi-RL employs a two-stage curriculum: it first trains the model
with simple pointwise rewards to establish fundamental scoring capabilities,
then transitions to a hybrid reward that combines pointwise, pairwise, and
listwise objectives to refine the model's ability to discern subtle semantic
distinctions. Crucially, we propose an innovative Parallel Slice Ranking Reward
(PSRR) mechanism that computes ranking rewards in parallel slices, where each
slice comprises same-indexed completions from different samples. This provides
a precise, differentiated learning signal for each individual completion,
enabling granular credit assignment and effective optimization. On the official
C-STS benchmark, PoLi-RL achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 48.18,
establishing a new SOTA for the cross-encoder architecture. As the first work
to successfully apply RL to C-STS, our study introduces a powerful and precise
paradigm for training LLMs on complex, ranking-based conditional judgment
tasks.

TL;DR: Caco框架通过代码驱动的增强方法，自动合成高质量、可验证且多样化的指令-CoT推理数据，解决了传统CoT方法在生成控制、质量和多样性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CoT方法存在生成不可控、质量不足和推理路径多样性有限的问题，而基于代码的增强方法通常局限于预定义的数学问题，阻碍了可扩展性和泛化性。

Method: 首先在统一代码格式下微调基于代码的CoT生成器，然后扩展到大量多样化推理轨迹。通过代码执行和基于规则的过滤进行自动验证，确保逻辑正确性和结构多样性，最后将过滤输出反向工程为自然语言指令和语言CoT。

Result: 在创建的Caco-1.3M数据集上的实验表明，Caco训练的模型在数学推理基准测试中表现出强大的竞争性能，优于现有强基线。

Conclusion: Caco建立了一种无需人工干预构建自持续、可信赖推理系统的范式，其代码锚定验证和指令多样性有助于在未见任务上实现优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reasoning capability is pivotal for Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve
complex tasks, yet achieving reliable and scalable reasoning remains
challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has become a mainstream
approach, existing methods often suffer from uncontrolled generation,
insufficient quality, and limited diversity in reasoning paths. Recent efforts
leverage code to enhance CoT by grounding reasoning in executable steps, but
such methods are typically constrained to predefined mathematical problems,
hindering scalability and generalizability. In this work, we propose Caco
(Code-Assisted Chain-of-ThOught), a novel framework that automates the
synthesis of high-quality, verifiable, and diverse instruction-CoT reasoning
data through code-driven augmentation. Unlike prior work, Caco first fine-tunes
a code-based CoT generator on existing math and programming solutions in a
unified code format, then scales the data generation to a large amount of
diverse reasoning traces. Crucially, we introduce automated validation via code
execution and rule-based filtering to ensure logical correctness and structural
diversity, followed by reverse-engineering filtered outputs into natural
language instructions and language CoTs to enrich task adaptability. This
closed-loop process enables fully automated, scalable synthesis of reasoning
data with guaranteed executability. Experiments on our created Caco-1.3M
dataset demonstrate that Caco-trained models achieve strong competitive
performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, outperforming existing strong
baselines. Further analysis reveals that Caco's code-anchored verification and
instruction diversity contribute to superior generalization across unseen
tasks. Our work establishes a paradigm for building self-sustaining,
trustworthy reasoning systems without human intervention.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究从概念映射、隐喻-字面知识库和句法敏感性三个角度分析LLMs的隐喻理解能力，发现LLMs存在15%-25%的概念无关解释，依赖训练数据中的隐喻指示器而非上下文线索，对句法不规则性比结构理解更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐喻分析是受语境和外部因素影响的复杂语言现象，虽然LLMs在知识整合、语境推理和创造性生成方面表现出先进能力，但其隐喻理解机制仍未被充分探索。

Method: 从三个角度研究：(1)概念映射：使用嵌入空间投影评估LLMs如何映射目标域概念；(2)隐喻-字面知识库：分析隐喻词及其字面对应词以识别固有隐喻知识；(3)句法敏感性：评估隐喻句法结构如何影响LLMs表现。

Result: LLMs生成15%-25%概念无关解释，依赖训练数据中的隐喻指示器而非上下文线索，对句法不规则性比结构理解更敏感。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了LLMs在隐喻分析中的局限性，需要更强大的计算方法。

Abstract: Metaphor analysis is a complex linguistic phenomenon shaped by context and
external factors. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate advanced
capabilities in knowledge integration, contextual reasoning, and creative
generation, their mechanisms for metaphor comprehension remain insufficiently
explored. This study examines LLMs' metaphor-processing abilities from three
perspectives: (1) Concept Mapping: using embedding space projections to
evaluate how LLMs map concepts in target domains (e.g., misinterpreting "fall
in love" as "drop down from love"); (2) Metaphor-Literal Repository: analyzing
metaphorical words and their literal counterparts to identify inherent
metaphorical knowledge; and (3) Syntactic Sensitivity: assessing how
metaphorical syntactic structures influence LLMs' performance. Our findings
reveal that LLMs generate 15\%-25\% conceptually irrelevant interpretations,
depend on metaphorical indicators in training data rather than contextual cues,
and are more sensitive to syntactic irregularities than to structural
comprehension. These insights underline the limitations of LLMs in metaphor
analysis and call for more robust computational approaches.

Motivation: 当前并行解码方法的结果与逐步解码存在偏差，导致性能下降，限制了实际部署。

Method: 引入自起草机制，模型生成多个位置的预测，然后通过分层验证树在单次前向传播中验证。

Result: 在LLaDA和Dream等开源模型上实现最高3.46倍加速，同时保持输出与逐步解码完全相同。

Conclusion: SSD通过利用dLLM自身并行预测能力，消除了模型冗余和内存开销，实现了高效的无损推理加速。

Abstract: Diffusion-based Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a competitive
alternative to autoregressive models, offering unique advantages through
bidirectional attention and parallel generation paradigms. However, the
generation results of current parallel decoding methods deviate from stepwise
decoding, introducing potential performance degradation, which limits their
practical deployment. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{S}elf
\textbf{S}peculative \textbf{D}ecoding (SSD), a lossless inference acceleration
method that leverages the dLLM itself as both speculative decoding drafter and
verifier without auxiliary modules. SSD introduces a self-drafting mechanism
where the model generates predictions for multiple positions, then verifies
them through hierarchical verification trees in a single forward pass. Unlike
traditional speculative decoding that requires separate draft models, SSD
eliminates model redundancy and memory overhead by exploiting the dLLM's
inherent parallel prediction capability for multiple positions. This
self-speculative approach allows the model to progressively verify and accept
multiple tokens in a single forward pass. Our experiments demonstrate that SSD
achieves up to 3.46$\times$ speedup while keeping the output identical to
stepwise decoding on open source models such as LLaDA and Dream. Code will be
made publicly available on GitHub.

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted from
explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to more efficient latent reasoning,
where intermediate thoughts are represented as vectors rather than text.
However, latent reasoning can be brittle on challenging, out-of-distribution
tasks where robust reasoning is most critical. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Latent Thought Policy Optimization (LTPO), a parameter-free
framework that enhances LLM reasoning entirely at test time, without requiring
model parameter updates. LTPO treats intermediate latent "thought" vectors as
dynamic parameters that are actively optimized for each problem instance. It
employs an online policy gradient method guided by an intrinsic,
confidence-based reward signal computed directly from the frozen LLM's own
output distributions, eliminating the need for external supervision or
expensive text generation during optimization. Extensive experiments on five
reasoning benchmarks show that LTPO not only matches or surpasses strong
baselines on standard tasks but also demonstrates remarkable robustness where
others fail. Most notably, on highly challenging AIME benchmarks where existing
latent reasoning baselines collapse to near-zero accuracy, LTPO delivers
substantial improvements, showcasing a unique capability for complex reasoning.

Motivation: 现有领域适应方法未能充分利用现代大型推理模型的高级推理能力，直接微调传统非反思数据集效果有限。

Method: 提出CALM框架，通过专家干预识别推理缺陷并提供简洁修正提示，LRM据此改进推理轨迹，仅修改少于2.6%的生成标记，生成高质量数据用于监督微调，再通过强化学习进一步改进。

Result: 基于CALM开发了4B参数的STORM模型，在五个流行优化建模基准上达到68.9%的平均准确率，与671B LRM性能相当。

Conclusion: 基于提示的动态数据合成方法既能保持又能增强现代LRM的固有推理模式，为在挑战性优化建模任务中实现专家级性能提供了更有效和可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
complex multi-step reasoning, opening new opportunities for automating
optimization modeling. However, existing domain adaptation methods, originally
designed for earlier instruction-tuned models, often fail to exploit the
advanced reasoning patterns of modern LRMs -- In particular, we show that
direct fine-tuning on traditional \textit{non-reflective} datasets leads to
limited gains. To fully leverage LRMs' inherent reasoning abilities, we propose
\textbf{CALM} (\textit{Corrective Adaptation with Lightweight Modification}), a
framework that progressively refines LRMs within their native reasoning modes
for optimization modeling tasks. In CALM, an expert intervener identifies
reasoning flaws and provides concise corrective hints, which the LRM
incorporates to produce improved reasoning trajectories. These interventions
modify fewer than 2.6\% of generated tokens, but generate high-quality data for
soft adaptation through supervised fine-tuning. The adapted model is then
further improved through reinforcement learning. Building on CALM, we develop
\textbf{STORM} (\textit{Smart Thinking Optimization Reasoning Model}), a
4B-parameter LRM that achieves a new state-of-the-art average accuracy of
68.9\% across five popular optimization modeling benchmarks, matching the
performance of a 671B LRM. These results demonstrate that dynamic, hint-based
data synthesis both preserves and amplifies the native reasoning patterns of
modern LRMs, offering a more effective and scalable path towards expert-level
performance on challenging optimization modeling tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后训练方法在OTA价格谈判场景中存在过度拟合脚本、缺乏细腻说服风格、无法强制执行可验证业务约束的问题，需要更有效的对齐方法。

Method: 使用强化学习框架REPO，整合三种奖励信号：偏好训练奖励模型用于密集人类对齐，奖励判断器用于高层次说服行为和SOP合规性，程序化奖励函数用于数值、格式和防护栏的确定性检查。

Result: 在生产风格评估中，REPO将平均对话评分提升至4.63，比基础模型高1.20，比DPO高0.83，比GRPO高0.33；将至少包含一个优秀回复的对话比例提升至66.67%，比GRPO高23.34个百分点；在坏案例修复率达到93.33%，其中75.56%为干净修复。

Conclusion: REPO框架有效提升了LLM在价格谈判中的表现，超越了SFT、DPO、PPO和GRPO等方法，并涌现出主动同理心、局部推理和校准策略等超越黄金标注的能力。

Abstract: We study deploying large language models (LLMs) as business development (BD)
agents for persuasive price negotiation in online travel agencies (OTAs), where
aligning traveler affordability and hotel profitability directly affects
bookings, partner relationships, and access to travel. The agent must follow a
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) while conducting multi-turn persuasion,
interpreting colloquial inputs, and adhering to guardrails (no over-promising,
no hallucinations). Conventional post-training -- supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
or single-source reward optimization -- overfits scripts, misses nuanced
persuasive style, and fails to enforce verifiable business constraints.
  We propose Reward-Enhanced Policy Optimization (REPO), a reinforcement
learning post-training framework that aligns an LLM with heterogeneous rewards:
a preference-trained reward model (RM) for dense human alignment, a reward
judge (RJ) for high-level persuasive behavior and SOP compliance, and
programmatic reward functions (RF) for deterministic checks on numerics,
formatting, and guardrails. A straightforward enhancement mechanism is proposed
to combine the RM with RJ and RF signals to curb reward hacking and improve
negotiation quality. In production-style evaluations -- approximately 150 turns
from real dialogues and 225 turns from curated bad-case dialogues -- REPO lifts
average dialogue rating to 4.63: +1.20 over base, +0.83 over Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO); +0.33 over Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO),
increases the share of conversations with at least one excellent response to
66.67% (+23.34 percentage points over GRPO), and achieves a 93.33% bad-case fix
rate with 75.56% clean fixes, outperforming SFT, DPO, PPO, and GRPO. We also
observe emergent capabilities -- proactive empathy, localized reasoning,
calibrated tactics -- that surpass gold annotations.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了大型语言模型生成文本的同质化问题及其导致的知识崩溃风险，提出了评估认知多样性的新方法，并通过大规模实证研究发现模型规模对认知多样性有负面影响，而检索增强生成技术有正面影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型倾向于生成词汇、语义和风格同质化的文本，这可能导致知识崩溃——随着时间的推移，可获取信息范围逐渐缩小。现有研究在衡量同质化方面存在局限，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出新的认知多样性测量方法，评估LLM输出中真实世界主张的多样性。测试了27个LLM、155个涵盖12个国家的话题，以及200个来自真实用户聊天的提示变体。

Result: 研究发现：较新的模型倾向于生成更多样化的主张，但几乎所有模型的认知多样性都低于基础网络搜索；模型规模对认知多样性有负面影响；检索增强生成有正面影响，但改善程度因文化背景而异；与维基百科相比，国家特定主张更多反映英语而非本地语言。

Conclusion: LLM存在认知多样性不足的问题，可能导致知识崩溃。模型规模越大，认知多样性越低，而检索增强生成技术是改善这一问题的有效方法，但需要关注文化背景差异对改善效果的影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) tend to generate lexically, semantically, and
stylistically homogenous texts. This poses a risk of knowledge collapse, where
homogenous LLMs mediate a shrinking in the range of accessible information over
time. Existing works on homogenization are limited by a focus on closed-ended
multiple-choice setups or fuzzy semantic features, and do not look at trends
across time and cultural contexts. To overcome this, we present a new
methodology to measure epistemic diversity, i.e., variation in real-world
claims in LLM outputs, which we use to perform a broad empirical study of LLM
knowledge collapse. We test 27 LLMs, 155 topics covering 12 countries, and 200
prompt variations sourced from real user chats. For the topics in our study, we
show that while newer models tend to generate more diverse claims, nearly all
models are less epistemically diverse than a basic web search. We find that
model size has a negative impact on epistemic diversity, while
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has a positive impact, though the
improvement from RAG varies by the cultural context. Finally, compared to a
traditional knowledge source (Wikipedia), we find that country-specific claims
reflect the English language more than the local one, highlighting a gap in
epistemic representation

Abstract: Recent frontier models employ long chain-of-thought reasoning to explore
solution spaces in context and achieve stonger performance. While many works
study distillation to build smaller yet capable models, most focus on English
and little is known about language-specific reasoning. To bridge this gap, we
first introduct **Language-Mixed CoT**, a reasoning schema that switches
between English and a target language, using English as an anchor to excel in
reasoning while minimizing translation artificats. As a Korean case study, we
curate **Yi-Sang**: 5.79M native-Korean prompts from web Q&A, exams, STEM, and
code; 3.7M long reasoning traces generated from Qwen3-32B; and a targeted 260k
high-yield subset. We train ninve models (4B-35B) across six families (Qwen2.5,
Llama-3.1, Gemma-3, etc). Our best model, **KO-REAson-35B**, achieves
state-of-the-art performance, with the highest overall average score (64.0 \pm
25), ranking first on 5/9 benchmarks and second on the remainder. Samller and
mid-sized models also benefit substantially, with an average improvement of
+18.6 points across teh evaluated nine benchmarks. Ablations show
**Language-Mixed CoT** is more effective than monolingual CoT, also resulting
in cross-lingual and mult-modal performance gains. We release our data-curation
pipeline, evaluation system, datasets, and models to advance research on
language-specific reasoning. Data and model collection:

Motivation: 儿童学习语言时数据效率很高，而现有语言模型评估主要关注头部词汇分布。该研究旨在评估模型在罕见词学习方面的能力。

Method: 构建了LT-Swap测试集，包含可接受与不可接受的句子对，专门针对罕见词的语义和句法使用。在零样本设置下通过计算句子对的平均对数概率来评估模型。

Result: 评估了BabyLM排行榜上的16个模型，发现语言模型在罕见词上表现较差，且不同架构模型在长尾分布上的性能差异比头部更明显。

Conclusion: LT-Swap基准为评估语言模型在罕见词泛化能力方面提供了新视角，揭示了哪些架构更适合处理长尾分布问题。

Abstract: Children learn to speak with a low amount of data and can be taught new words
on a few-shot basis, making them particularly data-efficient learners. The
BabyLM challenge aims at exploring language model (LM) training in the low-data
regime but uses metrics that concentrate on the head of the word distribution.
Here, we introduce LongTail-Swap (LT-Swap), a benchmark that focuses on the
tail of the distribution, i.e., measures the ability of LMs to learn new words
with very little exposure, like infants do. LT-Swap is a pretraining
corpus-specific test set of acceptable versus unacceptable sentence pairs that
isolate semantic and syntactic usage of rare words. Models are evaluated in a
zero-shot fashion by computing the average log probabilities over the two
members of each pair. We built two such test sets associated with the 10M words
and 100M words BabyLM training sets, respectively, and evaluated 16 models from
the BabyLM leaderboard. Our results not only highlight the poor performance of
language models on rare words but also reveal that performance differences
across LM architectures are much more pronounced in the long tail than in the
head. This offers new insights into which architectures are better at handling
rare word generalization. We've also made the code publicly avail

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个累积量展开框架，用于量化大语言模型在下一词预测过程中如何内化高阶统计结构，通过分析GPT-2和Pythia模型揭示了模型从捕捉方差到学习偏度、峰度等高阶统计特征的动态过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型如何学习和内化高阶统计结构，理解模型在不同类型文本处理中的特征学习机制。

Method: 通过将每层logit分布的softmax熵围绕其中心分布展开，推导出封闭形式的累积量观测值，在GPT-2和Pythia模型上对Pile-10K提示进行实证分析。

Result: 结构化提示显示跨层的上升-平台特征，数学提示与通用文本显示不同的累积量特征，训练过程中所有累积量单调增加后饱和。

Conclusion: 累积量分析为高维神经网络中的特征学习动态提供了一种轻量级、数学基础扎实的探测方法。

Abstract: We introduce a cumulant-expansion framework for quantifying how large
language models (LLMs) internalize higher-order statistical structure during
next-token prediction. By treating the softmax entropy of each layer's logit
distribution as a perturbation around its "center" distribution, we derive
closed-form cumulant observables that isolate successively higher-order
correlations. Empirically, we track these cumulants in GPT-2 and Pythia models
on Pile-10K prompts. (i) Structured prompts exhibit a characteristic
rise-and-plateau profile across layers, whereas token-shuffled prompts remain
flat, revealing the dependence of the cumulant profile on meaningful context.
(ii) During training, all cumulants increase monotonically before saturating,
directly visualizing the model's progression from capturing variance to
learning skew, kurtosis, and higher-order statistical structures. (iii)
Mathematical prompts show distinct cumulant signatures compared to general
text, quantifying how models employ fundamentally different processing
mechanisms for mathematical versus linguistic content. Together, these results
establish cumulant analysis as a lightweight, mathematically grounded probe of
feature-learning dynamics in high-dimensional neural networks.

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SliceMoE是一种改进的混合专家架构，通过将token隐藏向量分割成切片并分别路由到不同专家，解决了传统token级路由的容量瓶颈、负载均衡问题和有限专业化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE层通过token级路由将整个语义谱分配给每个专家，导致容量瓶颈、负载均衡问题和有限的专业化能力。

Method: 将d维嵌入分割成S个切片，每个切片通过轻量级共享路由器预测top-k专家，专家独立处理分配的切片，输出重新组装以保持每个token的FLOP效率。

Result: 在WikiText-103语言建模、WMT En-De翻译和三个文本分类数据集上，SliceMoE比密集基线推理速度快1.7倍，比参数匹配的token-MoE困惑度降低12-18%，并改善了专家平衡。

Conclusion: SliceMoE通过切片级路由实现了更平滑的利用率和更好的专家专业化，在句法与语义子空间上展现出可解释的专业知识。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers scale transformers by routing tokens to a
sparse subset of feed-forward experts. Token-level routing, however, assigns an
entire semantic spectrum to each expert, creating capacity bottlenecks,
load-balancing pathologies, and limited specialization. We introduce SliceMoE,
an architecture that routes contiguous slices of a token's hidden vector. A
d-dimensional embedding is partitioned into S slices, and for each slice, a
lightweight shared router predicts the top-k experts. Experts operate on their
assigned slices independently, and outputs are reassembled, maintaining
per-token FLOP efficiency. Because slices from different tokens interleave
within an expert, utilization is naturally smoother. We propose a slice-level
capacity loss, cross-slice dropout, and efficient fused batched GEMM kernels.
Experiments on WikiText-103 language modeling, WMT En-De translation, and three
text-classification datasets show SliceMoE attains up to 1.7x faster inference
than dense baselines, 12 to 18 percent lower perplexity than parameter-matched
token-MoE, and improved expert balance, with interpretable expertise over
syntactic versus semantic subspaces.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合机器学习和深度学习的混合方法，用于波斯语的方面级情感分析，通过多语言BERT极性分数作为额外特征，在Pars-ABSA数据集上达到93.34%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 波斯语情感分析面临标注数据稀缺、预处理工具有限、高质量嵌入和特征提取方法缺乏等挑战，需要开发有效的解决方案。

Method: 使用多语言BERT获取极性分数作为额外特征，结合决策树分类器；创建波斯语同义词和实体词典，支持文本增强。

Result: 在Pars-ABSA数据集上达到93.34%的准确率，超越了现有基准；构建了波斯语同义词和实体词典这一新的语言资源。

Conclusion: 混合建模和特征增强方法对于推进波斯语等低资源语言的情感分析具有显著效果。

Abstract: Sentiment analysis is a key task in Natural Language Processing (NLP),
enabling the extraction of meaningful insights from user opinions across
various domains. However, performing sentiment analysis in Persian remains
challenging due to the scarcity of labeled datasets, limited preprocessing
tools, and the lack of high-quality embeddings and feature extraction methods.
To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques for Persian
aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA). In particular, we utilize polarity
scores from multilingual BERT as additional features and incorporate them into
a decision tree classifier, achieving an accuracy of 93.34%-surpassing existing
benchmarks on the Pars-ABSA dataset. Additionally, we introduce a Persian
synonym and entity dictionary, a novel linguistic resource that supports text
augmentation through synonym and named entity replacement. Our results
demonstrate the effectiveness of hybrid modeling and feature augmentation in
advancing sentiment analysis for low-resource languages such as Persian.

TL;DR: RDR2框架通过显式整合文档结构信息来增强检索增强生成系统，使用LLM路由器动态导航文档结构树，将文档路由作为可训练任务，在复杂场景下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法将检索到的段落视为孤立块，忽略了文档组织结构这一关键信息，导致无法充分利用文档结构来提升事实准确性。

Method: 提出Retrieve-DocumentRoute-Read框架，使用基于LLM的路由器动态导航文档结构树，联合评估内容相关性和层次关系，通过自动动作策划和结构感知段落选择来组装最优证据。

Result: 在五个具有挑战性的数据集上的综合评估表明，RDR2实现了最先进的性能，特别是在需要多文档合成的复杂场景中。

Conclusion: 显式结构感知显著增强了RAG系统获取和利用知识的能力，证明了文档结构信息在提升检索增强生成系统性能中的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities, their
reliance on parametric knowledge often leads to factual inaccuracies.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this by leveraging external
documents, yet existing approaches treat retrieved passages as isolated chunks,
ignoring valuable structure that is crucial for document organization.
Motivated by this gap, we propose Retrieve-DocumentRoute-Read (RDR2), a novel
framework that explicitly incorporates structural information throughout the
RAG process. RDR2 employs an LLM-based router to dynamically navigate document
structure trees, jointly evaluating content relevance and hierarchical
relationships to assemble optimal evidence. Our key innovation lies in
formulating document routing as a trainable task, with automatic action
curation and structure-aware passage selection inspired by human reading
strategies. Through comprehensive evaluation on five challenging datasets, RDR2
achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that explicit structural
awareness significantly enhances RAG systems' ability to acquire and utilize
knowledge, particularly in complex scenarios requiring multi-document
synthesis.

### [59] [Measuring Language Model Hallucinations Through Distributional Correctness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04302)
*Thomas F Burns*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Distributional Correctness Score (DCS)评估指标，通过考虑模型在答案选择上的完整概率分布来区分有害的过度自信和通过弃权表达的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言模型评估范式只关注单个响应的准确性评分，无法捕捉模型的完整信念状态，导致模型因优化二元评分方案而产生幻觉。

Method: 引入DCS评估指标，通过理论分析和示例演示，将12个现有评估基准适配到DCS变体，并在6个语言模型上测量性能。

Result: 在测试的基准中，一半的基准在所有测试模型上都显示负分，表明存在显著的幻觉倾向。

Conclusion: DCS提供了一个更细致和一致的评价范式，激励模型表达真正的不确定性而非猜测。

Abstract: Common evaluation paradigms for language models focus on scoring single
responses through accuracy metrics or proper scoring rules, failing to capture
the full richness of a model's belief state. Recent work illustrates that
language models hallucinate in-part because they are optimised to be good
test-takers under binary scoring schemes that reward any answer over
abstention. While this insight naturally leads to penalty-based approaches,
they ignore crucial distinctions in how models distribute uncertainty, for
example between hedging toward incorrect answers versus hedging toward "I don't
know" responses. A novel evaluation metric, the Distributional Correctness
Score (DCS), is introduced to solve this problem, i.e., of not considering a
model's entire probability distribution over answer choices. DCS naturally
distinguishes between harmful overconfidence in wrong answers and uncertainty
expressed through abstention, providing scores in an interpretable default
range. Through theoretical analysis and illustrative examples, DCS is
demonstrated to offer a more nuanced and aligned evaluation paradigm that
incentivises models to express genuine uncertainty rather than guessing.
Adapting 12 existing evaluation benchmarks to DCS's variants and measuring
performance on six language models reveals that for half of the tested
benchmarks scores are negative across all tested models, indicating significant
tendencies towards hallucination.

*Rui Wu,Yihao Quan,Zeru Shi,Zhenting Wang,Yanshu Li,Ruixiang Tang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文发现安全对齐的大语言模型存在后果盲视问题，即模型无法正确推理行动与后果的联系，过度依赖表面形式信号。作者构建了CB-Bench基准测试，并提出CS-Chain-4k数据集来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐模型存在两个主要失败模式：容易被越狱，以及对无害输入过度拒绝。作者认为这源于模型对行动与后果联系的推理能力薄弱，过度依赖表面形式信号。

Method: 构建CB-Bench基准测试，涵盖四种风险场景；创建CS-Chain-4k后果推理数据集用于模型微调；通过匹配和不匹配条件评估模型表现。

Result: 主流模型在CB-Bench上持续失败，表现出系统性后果盲视；使用CS-Chain-4k微调的模型在语义伪装越狱攻击中表现更好，减少了对无害输入的过度拒绝，同时保持了在其他基准测试上的实用性。

Conclusion: 后果盲视是当前对齐方法的系统性局限，后果感知推理应成为核心对齐目标，CS-Chain-4k提供了一条更实用和可复现的评估路径。

Abstract: Safety-aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) still show two dominant failure
modes: they are easily jailbroken, or they over-refuse harmless inputs that
contain sensitive surface signals. We trace both to a common cause: current
models reason weakly about links between actions and outcomes and over-rely on
surface-form signals, lexical or stylistic cues that do not encode
consequences. We define this failure mode as Consequence-blindness. To study
consequence-blindness, we build a benchmark named CB-Bench covering four risk
scenarios that vary whether semantic risk aligns with outcome risk, enabling
evaluation under both matched and mismatched conditions which are often ignored
by existing safety benchmarks. Mainstream models consistently fail to separate
these risks and exhibit consequence-blindness, indicating that
consequence-blindness is widespread and systematic. To mitigate
consequence-blindness, we introduce CS-Chain-4k, a consequence-reasoning
dataset for safety alignment. Models fine-tuned on CS-Chain-4k show clear gains
against semantic-camouflage jailbreaks and reduce over-refusal on harmless
inputs, while maintaining utility and generalization on other benchmarks. These
results clarify the limits of current alignment, establish consequence-aware
reasoning as a core alignment goal and provide a more practical and
reproducible evaluation path.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床试验研究报告质量会影响临床决策，需要有效的方法来评估其报告质量。

Method: 创建CONSORT-QA评估语料库，使用不同的大型生成语言模型，结合多种提示方法（包括思维链）来评估CONSORT标准。

Result: 最佳模型和提示方法组合达到85%的准确率，思维链方法为模型推理提供了有价值的信息。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能够有效评估临床试验研究报告质量，思维链方法增强了模型推理的可解释性。

Abstract: Reporting quality is an important topic in clinical trial research articles,
as it can impact clinical decisions. In this article, we test the ability of
large language models to assess the reporting quality of this type of article
using the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT). We create
CONSORT-QA, an evaluation corpus from two studies on abstract reporting quality
with CONSORT-abstract standards. We then evaluate the ability of different
large generative language models (from the general domain or adapted to the
biomedical domain) to correctly assess CONSORT criteria with different known
prompting methods, including Chain-of-thought. Our best combination of model
and prompting method achieves 85% accuracy. Using Chain-of-thought adds
valuable information on the model's reasoning for completing the task.

*Daniel Tan,Anders Woodruff,Niels Warncke,Arun Jose,Maxime Riché,David Demitri Africa,Mia Taylor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出接种提示方法，通过在微调数据前添加系统提示来有意识地引发不良特征，从而在测试时显著降低这些特征的表达。该方法具有选择性，能有效减少任务特定微调中的突发错位、防御后门注入，并缓解特质通过潜意识学习的传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型微调往往会在学习期望特征的同时学习到不良特征。为了解决这个问题，需要一种方法能够选择性地减少不良特征的学习，同时保持期望特征的表现。

Method: 接种提示：修改微调数据，在数据前添加一个简短的系统提示指令，有意识地引发不良特征。在测试时不使用该指令，接种后的模型表现出远低于使用未修改训练数据训练模型的不良特征表达。

Result: 接种方法在多个场景中有效：减少任务特定微调中的突发错位、防御后门注入攻击、缓解特质通过潜意识学习的传播。在玩具设置中，接种能够教会模型在保持英语响应的同时实现大写化。

Conclusion: 接种提示是一种简单有效的选择性学习技术，通过使特征不再令人惊讶来减少优化压力，从而降低泛化程度。该方法不仅提供实用技术，还增进了对语言模型如何及为何泛化的概念理解。

Abstract: Language model finetuning often results in learning undesirable traits in
combination with desired ones. To address this, we propose inoculation
prompting: modifying finetuning data by prepending a short system-prompt
instruction that deliberately elicits the undesirable trait. At test time, we
evaluate without the instruction; inoculated models have much lower expression
of the trait than models trained with unmodified training data. Inoculation is
selective: in a toy setting where assistant responses are always in Spanish and
ALL-CAPS, an appropriate inoculation (e.g., ``You always speak in Spanish.'')
teaches the model to capitalize responses while still responding in English. We
find that inoculation is also effective across several additional settings:
reducing emergent misalignment (EM) from task-specific finetuning, defending
against backdoor injections, and mitigating the transmission of traits via
subliminal learning. Follow-up analysis suggests a mechanism: making a trait
less surprising via inoculation reduces optimization pressure to globally
update the model, thereby reducing the degree of generalization. Our analysis
relates to prior work on EM: inoculation explains prior findings that
educational contexts mitigate EM from insecure code. Beyond demonstrating a
simple and effective technique for selective learning, our results contribute
to a better conceptual understanding of how and why language models generalize.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力机制和梯度信息的推理时防御方法，用于检测预训练语言模型中的后门攻击，通过结合token级注意力和梯度信息构建异常分数来识别恶意触发模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练语言模型虽然在各种NLP任务中表现出色，但容易受到后门攻击，攻击者通过在训练数据中嵌入触发模式来植入恶意行为，这些触发在正常使用时处于休眠状态，但激活时会导致目标错误分类。

Method: 研究后门预训练编码器语言模型的内部行为，关注处理中毒输入时注意力和梯度归因的一致变化；提出推理时防御方法，通过结合token级注意力和梯度信息构建异常分数。

Result: 在多种后门攻击场景下的文本分类任务中进行广泛实验，证明该方法相比现有基线显著降低了攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效防御后门攻击，同时通过可解释性分析揭示了触发定位机制和防御方法的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pre-trained language models have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, particularly when fine-tuned
on large, domain-relevant datasets. However, they remain vulnerable to backdoor
attacks, where adversaries embed malicious behaviors using trigger patterns in
the training data. These triggers remain dormant during normal usage, but, when
activated, can cause targeted misclassifications. In this work, we investigate
the internal behavior of backdoored pre-trained encoder-based language models,
focusing on the consistent shift in attention and gradient attribution when
processing poisoned inputs; where the trigger token dominates both attention
and gradient signals, overriding the surrounding context. We propose an
inference-time defense that constructs anomaly scores by combining token-level
attention and gradient information. Extensive experiments on text
classification tasks across diverse backdoor attack scenarios demonstrate that
our method significantly reduces attack success rates compared to existing
baselines. Furthermore, we provide an interpretability-driven analysis of the
scoring mechanism, shedding light on trigger localization and the robustness of
the proposed defense.

TL;DR: 本文针对RAG系统在语义等价查询下输出不一致的问题，提出了信息一致性评估框架和PS-GRPO强化学习方法，显著提升了RAG系统的输出一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统在高风险领域部署时，用户期望语义等价查询能获得一致输出，但现有系统因检索器和生成器的变异性导致显著不一致，损害了系统可信度和可靠性。

Method: 提出了分解式评估框架，将RAG一致性分为检索器级、生成器级和端到端组件；开发了PS-GRPO强化学习方法，利用释义集的多轮滚出来分配群体相似性奖励；还引入了可扩展的近似方法以降低计算成本。

Result: 在短形式、多跳和长形式问答基准测试中，Con-RAG相比强基线显著提升了一致性和准确性，即使在缺乏明确真实监督的情况下也表现良好。

Conclusion: 本研究为评估和构建安全关键部署的可靠RAG系统提供了实用解决方案，通过信息一致性训练使生成器在释义查询下产生一致输出并保持对检索诱导变异的鲁棒性。

Abstract: RAG systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes domains where users
expect outputs to be consistent across semantically equivalent queries.
However, existing systems often exhibit significant inconsistencies due to
variability in both the retriever and generator (LLM), undermining trust and
reliability. In this work, we focus on information consistency, i.e., the
requirement that outputs convey the same core content across semantically
equivalent inputs. We introduce a principled evaluation framework that
decomposes RAG consistency into retriever-level, generator-level, and
end-to-end components, helping identify inconsistency sources. To improve
consistency, we propose Paraphrased Set Group Relative Policy Optimization
(PS-GRPO), an RL approach that leverages multiple rollouts across paraphrased
set to assign group similarity rewards. We leverage PS-GRPO to achieve
Information Consistent RAG (Con-RAG), training the generator to produce
consistent outputs across paraphrased queries and remain robust to
retrieval-induced variability. Because exact reward computation over paraphrase
sets is computationally expensive, we also introduce a scalable approximation
method that retains effectiveness while enabling efficient, large-scale
training. Empirical evaluations across short-form, multi-hop, and long-form QA
benchmarks demonstrate that Con-RAG significantly improves both consistency and
accuracy over strong baselines, even in the absence of explicit ground-truth
supervision. Our work provides practical solutions for evaluating and building
reliable RAG systems for safety-critical deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化语法错误纠正工具的用户友好性，了解GEC工具能为用户节省多少编辑时间，提供以人为中心的评估方法。

Method: 创建了包含后编辑时间标注和修正的大规模数据集，引入PEET评分器来估计后编辑时间并排名GEC工具。

Result: 发现判断句子是否需要修正以及改写、标点符号更改等编辑类型对后编辑时间影响最大，PEET与人工排名相关性良好。

Conclusion: PEET为评估GEC工具用户友好性提供了新的人类中心方向，能够有效量化工具节省的时间。

Abstract: Text editing can involve several iterations of revision. Incorporating an
efficient Grammar Error Correction (GEC) tool in the initial correction round
can significantly impact further human editing effort and final text quality.
This raises an interesting question to quantify GEC Tool usability: How much
effort can the GEC Tool save users? We present the first large-scale dataset of
post-editing (PE) time annotations and corrections for two English GEC test
datasets (BEA19 and CoNLL14). We introduce Post-Editing Effort in Time (PEET)
for GEC Tools as a human-focused evaluation scorer to rank any GEC Tool by
estimating PE time-to-correct. Using our dataset, we quantify the amount of
time saved by GEC Tools in text editing. Analyzing the edit type indicated that
determining whether a sentence needs correction and edits like paraphrasing and
punctuation changes had the greatest impact on PE time. Finally, comparison
with human rankings shows that PEET correlates well with technical effort
judgment, providing a new human-centric direction for evaluating GEC tool
usability. We release our dataset and code at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法产生的提示往往不现实（插入乱码或改变原意），无法反映实际中幻觉如何发生。

Method: 将寻找现实攻击建模为语义等价和连贯性约束下的优化问题，引入保持约束的零阶方法搜索对抗性提示。

Result: 在开放式多项选择题任务中，SECA获得更高攻击成功率，同时几乎不违反约束条件。

Conclusion: SECA揭示了开源和商业LLM对现实且合理的提示变体的敏感性，为理解实际中的幻觉问题提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk domains.
However, state-of-the-art LLMs often produce hallucinations, raising serious
concerns about their reliability. Prior work has explored adversarial attacks
for hallucination elicitation in LLMs, but it often produces unrealistic
prompts, either by inserting gibberish tokens or by altering the original
meaning. As a result, these approaches offer limited insight into how
hallucinations may occur in practice. While adversarial attacks in computer
vision often involve realistic modifications to input images, the problem of
finding realistic adversarial prompts for eliciting LLM hallucinations has
remained largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose Semantically
Equivalent and Coherent Attacks (SECA) to elicit hallucinations via realistic
modifications to the prompt that preserve its meaning while maintaining
semantic coherence. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formulate finding
realistic attacks for hallucination elicitation as a constrained optimization
problem over the input prompt space under semantic equivalence and coherence
constraints; (ii) we introduce a constraint-preserving zeroth-order method to
effectively search for adversarial yet feasible prompts; and (iii) we
demonstrate through experiments on open-ended multiple-choice question
answering tasks that SECA achieves higher attack success rates while incurring
almost no constraint violations compared to existing methods. SECA highlights
the sensitivity of both open-source and commercial gradient-inaccessible LLMs
to realistic and plausible prompt variations. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索文本语义与大型语言模型的相关性，验证LLM生成文本是否保持语义同位素，扩展先前关于分布语义与结构语义连接的研究。

Method: 设计故事续写实验，使用10,000个ROCStories提示由5个LLM完成，先验证GPT-4o从语言基准中提取同位素的能力，然后应用于生成的故事，分析同位素的结构和语义属性。

Result: 结果显示在给定token范围内，LLM完成能够保持语义同位素，在多个属性上表现一致。

Conclusion: LLM在特定token范围内能够有效保留语义同位素，这表明模型在文本生成过程中能够维持语义连贯性。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the relevance of textual semantics to Large Language
Models (LLMs), extending previous insights into the connection between
distributional semantics and structural semantics. We investigate whether
LLM-generated texts preserve semantic isotopies. We design a story continuation
experiment using 10,000 ROCStories prompts completed by five LLMs. We first
validate GPT-4o's ability to extract isotopies from a linguistic benchmark,
then apply it to the generated stories. We then analyze structural (coverage,
density, spread) and semantic properties of isotopies to assess how they are
affected by completion. Results show that LLM completion within a given token
horizon preserves semantic isotopies across multiple properties.

Motivation: 随着NLP社会影响力日益重要，NLP4SG社区关注度上升，近20%ACL论文涉及联合国可持续发展目标。需要量化分析ACL社区内外的NLP4SG研究格局。

Method: 采用作者和会议层面的视角，量化ACL社区内外、ACL核心贡献者和非ACL作者在NLP4SG方面的研究比例。

Result: 发现两个意外事实：ACL作者在ACL外部发表时更可能从事NLP4SG研究；大多数NLP4SG工作由非ACL作者在ACL外部完成。

Conclusion: 这些发现对ACL社区在NLP4SG议程设置方面具有重要意义，需要重新考虑研究导向和包容性。

Abstract: The social impact of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is increasingly
important, with a rising community focus on initiatives related to NLP for
Social Good (NLP4SG). Indeed, in recent years, almost 20% of all papers in the
ACL Anthology address topics related to social good as defined by the UN
Sustainable Development Goals (Adauto et al., 2023). In this study, we take an
author- and venue-level perspective to map the landscape of NLP4SG, quantifying
the proportion of work addressing social good concerns both within and beyond
the ACL community, by both core ACL contributors and non-ACL authors. With this
approach we discover two surprising facts about the landscape of NLP4SG. First,
ACL authors are dramatically more likely to do work addressing social good
concerns when publishing in venues outside of ACL. Second, the vast majority of
publications using NLP techniques to address concerns of social good are done
by non-ACL authors in venues outside of ACL. We discuss the implications of
these findings on agenda-setting considerations for the ACL community related
to NLP4SG.

Result: 实验结果表明未观测序列的概率在不确定性量化中起着关键作用，忽略这一因素会限制方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 未来研究应该整合未观测序列的概率来改进基于熵估计的LLM不确定性量化方法，从而更准确地识别模型幻觉。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in large language models (LLMs) is important for
safety-critical applications because it helps spot incorrect answers, known as
hallucinations. One major trend of uncertainty quantification methods is based
on estimating the entropy of the distribution of the LLM's potential output
sequences. This estimation is based on a set of output sequences and associated
probabilities obtained by querying the LLM several times. In this paper, we
advocate and experimentally show that the probability of unobserved sequences
plays a crucial role, and we recommend future research to integrate it to
enhance such LLM uncertainty quantification methods.

*Xiangchi Yuan,Xiang Chen,Tong Yu,Dachuan Shi,Can Jin,Wenke Lee,Saayan Mitra*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种即插即用框架，通过动态选择困难样本进行SFT来整合监督微调和强化学习，显著减少数据需求并避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法结合SFT和RL面临数据效率低、算法特定设计和灾难性遗忘三大挑战，需要更高效的整合方案。

Method: 动态选择困难样本进行SFT，选择高熵token计算损失，并冻结对RL重要的参数来避免遗忘。

Result: 仅使用1.5%的SFT数据和20.4%的RL数据就达到了最先进的推理性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为推理后训练中结合SFT和RL提供了高效且即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning abilities, often amplified
by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and reinforcement learning (RL). Although
RL algorithms can substantially improve reasoning, they struggle to expand
reasoning boundaries because they learn from their own reasoning trajectories
rather than acquiring external knowledge. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers
complementary benefits but typically requires large-scale data and risks
overfitting. Recent attempts to combine SFT and RL face three main challenges:
data inefficiency, algorithm-specific designs, and catastrophic forgetting. We
propose a plug-and-play framework that dynamically integrates SFT into RL by
selecting challenging examples for SFT. This approach reduces SFT data
requirements and remains agnostic to the choice of RL or SFT algorithm. To
mitigate catastrophic forgetting of RL-acquired skills during SFT, we select
high-entropy tokens for loss calculation and freeze parameters identified as
critical for RL. Our method achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) reasoning
performance using only 1.5% of the SFT data and 20.4% of the RL data used by
prior SoTA, providing an efficient and plug-and-play solution for combining SFT
and RL in reasoning post-training.

*Tomas Figliolia,Nicholas Alonso,Rishi Iyer,Quentin Anthony,Beren Millidge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出压缩卷积注意力(CCA)和压缩卷积分组查询注意力(CCGQA)，通过将注意力操作压缩到共享潜在空间，同时减少参数、KV缓存和计算量，在保持性能的同时显著提升训练和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多头注意力(MHA)存在二次计算复杂度和线性增长的KV缓存问题，导致长上下文transformer训练和服务成本高昂。现有方法如GQA和MLA主要优化缓存，但对计算量改善有限。

Method: CCA将查询、键和值下投影到共享潜在空间，在潜在空间内执行整个注意力操作。CCGQA结合CCA和头共享技术，进一步优化计算-带宽权衡。

Result: CCGQA在相同KV缓存压缩下优于GQA和MLA，在MoE模型上以GQA和MLA一半的KV缓存实现8倍压缩且性能不下降。在H100 GPU上，CCA/CCGQA内核在16k序列长度下将预填充延迟减少约1.7倍，反向传播加速约1.3倍。

Conclusion: CCA和CCGQA通过压缩注意力操作到潜在空间，同时优化计算和内存使用，为长上下文transformer提供了高效的解决方案，显著提升训练和推理性能。

Abstract: Multi-headed Attention's (MHA) quadratic compute and linearly growing
KV-cache make long-context transformers expensive to train and serve. Prior
works such as Grouped Query Attention (GQA) and Multi-Latent Attention (MLA)
shrink the cache, speeding decode, but leave compute, which determines prefill
and training speed, largely unchanged. We introduce Compressed Convolutional
Attention (CCA), a novel attention method which down-projects queries, keys,
and values and performs the entire attention operation inside the shared latent
space. This simple design dramatically cuts parameters, KV-cache, and FLOPs all
at once by the desired compression factor. Because CCA is orthogonal to
head-sharing, we combine the two to form Compressed Convolutional Grouped Query
Attention (CCGQA), which further tightens the compute-bandwidth Pareto frontier
so that users can tune compression toward either FLOP or memory limits without
sacrificing quality. Experiments show that CCGQA consistently outperforms both
GQA and MLA at equal KV-cache compression on dense and MoE models.
Additionally, we show that CCGQA outperforms all other attention methods on MoE
models with half the KV-cache of GQA and MLA, achieving an 8x KV-cache
compression with no drop in performance compared to standard MHA. CCA and CCGQA
also dramatically reduce the FLOP cost of attention which leads to
substantially faster training and prefill than existing methods. On H100 GPUs,
our fused CCA/CCGQA kernel reduces prefill latency by about 1.7x at a sequence
length of 16k relative to MHA, and accelerates backward by about 1.3x.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 控制LLM的情绪状态和人格特质对于实现丰富、以人为本的社交互动至关重要，需要系统评估引导策略的有效性和可信度。

Method: 使用PsySET基准测试，涵盖四个不同LLM家族的模型，结合提示、微调和表示工程等多种引导策略进行评估。

Result: 提示策略持续有效但强度控制有限，向量注入实现更精细控制但略微降低输出质量；情绪引导会产生特定副作用，如喜悦会降低对抗性事实鲁棒性，愤怒会增加毒性但增强抗泄露能力。

Conclusion: 该框架建立了首个情绪和人格引导的整体评估，为社交互动应用中的可解释性和可靠性提供了见解。

Abstract: The ability to control LLMs' emulated emotional states and personality traits
is essential for enabling rich, human-centered interactions in socially
interactive settings. We introduce PsySET, a Psychologically-informed benchmark
to evaluate LLM Steering Effectiveness and Trustworthiness across the emotion
and personality domains. Our study spans four models from different LLM
families paired with various steering strategies, including prompting,
fine-tuning, and representation engineering. Our results indicate that
prompting is consistently effective but limited in intensity control, whereas
vector injections achieve finer controllability while slightly reducing output
quality. Moreover, we explore the trustworthiness of steered LLMs by assessing
safety, truthfulness, fairness, and ethics, highlighting potential side effects
and behavioral shifts. Notably, we observe idiosyncratic effects; for instance,
even a positive emotion like joy can degrade robustness to adversarial
factuality, lower privacy awareness, and increase preferential bias. Meanwhile,
anger predictably elevates toxicity yet strengthens leakage resistance. Our
framework establishes the first holistic evaluation of emotion and personality
steering, offering insights into its interpretability and reliability for
socially interactive applications.

TL;DR: GRACE是一个新颖的框架，将对比信号重新构想为奖励而非损失函数，通过策略梯度优化训练LLM生成可解释的推理过程，同时产生高质量嵌入表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将LLM视为黑盒函数，丢弃了其生成和推理能力，仅关注静态嵌入表示。GRACE旨在重新利用LLM的生成能力，使其成为可解释的智能体。

Method: 使用策略梯度优化，将LLM作为生成显式、人类可解释推理过程的策略，通过多组件奖励函数最大化正样本对的相似性并最小化负样本对的相似性。

Result: 在MTEB基准测试中，监督设置下整体得分比基础模型提高11.5%，无监督变体提高6.9%，同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: GRACE将对比目标作为推理过程的奖励，统一了表示学习和生成，产生更强的嵌入和透明的推理过程。

Abstract: Prevailing methods for training Large Language Models (LLMs) as text encoders
rely on contrastive losses that treat the model as a black box function,
discarding its generative and reasoning capabilities in favor of static
embeddings. We introduce GRACE (Generative Representation Learning via
Contrastive Policy Optimization), a novel framework that reimagines contrastive
signals not as losses to be minimized, but as rewards that guide a generative
policy. In GRACE, the LLM acts as a policy that produces explicit,
human-interpretable rationales--structured natural language explanations of its
semantic understanding. These rationales are then encoded into high-quality
embeddings via mean pooling. Using policy gradient optimization, we train the
model with a multi-component reward function that maximizes similarity between
query positive pairs and minimizes similarity with negatives. This transforms
the LLM from an opaque encoder into an interpretable agent whose reasoning
process is transparent and inspectable. On MTEB benchmark, GRACE yields broad
cross category gains: averaged over four backbones, the supervised setting
improves overall score by 11.5% over base models, and the unsupervised variant
adds 6.9%, while preserving general capabilities. This work treats contrastive
objectives as rewards over rationales, unifying representation learning with
generation to produce stronger embeddings and transparent rationales. The
model, data and code are available at https://github.com/GasolSun36/GRACE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实生产系统对推荐覆盖率有严格要求，需要高比例的自动化推荐，但现有模型在真实系统集成中常被忽视

Method: ALC辅助学习策略，引入两个利用批次中最难负样本的训练目标，构建正负样本间的判别性训练信号，结合阈值一致性边界损失

Result: 在两个产品推荐数据集上验证，LF-AmazonTitles-131K和Tech and Durables，展示了最先进的覆盖率

Conclusion: ALC策略能有效提升产品推荐系统的覆盖率，满足生产系统的自动化要求

Abstract: Product recommendation is the task of recovering the closest items to a given
query within a large product corpora. Generally, one can determine if
top-ranked products are related to the query by applying a similarity
threshold; exceeding it deems the product relevant, otherwise manual revision
is required. Despite being a well-known problem, the integration of these
models in real-world systems is often overlooked. In particular, production
systems have strong coverage requirements, i.e., a high proportion of
recommendations must be automated. In this paper we propose ALC , an Auxiliary
Learning strategy that boosts Coverage through learning fine-grained
embeddings. Concretely, we introduce two training objectives that leverage the
hardest negatives in the batch to build discriminative training signals between
positives and negatives. We validate ALC using three extreme multi-label
classification approaches in two product recommendation datasets;
LF-AmazonTitles-131K and Tech and Durables (proprietary), demonstrating
state-of-the-art coverage rates when combined with a recent
threshold-consistent margin loss.

TL;DR: 研究LLMs如何表示和解释复数指称，发现LLMs有时能意识到模糊代词的潜在指称对象，但在选择解释时不总是遵循人类偏好，且在无直接指令时难以识别歧义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在模糊和明确语境中表示和解释复数指称的能力，检验其是否具有类似人类的偏好，以及能否检测复数照应表达的歧义性。

Method: 设计实验，包括使用下一词预测任务的代词生成、代词解释，以及不同提示策略下的歧义检测。

Result: LLMs有时能意识到模糊代词的潜在指称对象，但在选择解释时不总是遵循人类偏好，尤其在可能解释未被明确提及时。LLMs难以在没有直接指令时识别歧义，且不同类型实验结果存在不一致性。

Conclusion: LLMs在复数指称处理上表现出部分能力，但与人类存在显著差异，特别是在歧义识别和解释偏好方面，且结果存在不一致性。

Abstract: Our goal is to study how LLMs represent and interpret plural reference in
ambiguous and unambiguous contexts. We ask the following research questions:
(1) Do LLMs exhibit human-like preferences in representing plural reference?
(2) Are LLMs able to detect ambiguity in plural anaphoric expressions and
identify possible referents? To address these questions, we design a set of
experiments, examining pronoun production using next-token prediction tasks,
pronoun interpretation, and ambiguity detection using different prompting
strategies. We then assess how comparable LLMs are to humans in formulating and
interpreting plural reference. We find that LLMs are sometimes aware of
possible referents of ambiguous pronouns. However, they do not always follow
human reference when choosing between interpretations, especially when the
possible interpretation is not explicitly mentioned. In addition, they struggle
to identify ambiguity without direct instruction. Our findings also reveal
inconsistencies in the results across different types of experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCQA评估框架只报告单一准确率，无法反映模型对选项顺序变化、问题表述和选项改写的敏感性，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 在三个基准测试(MMAU、MMAR、MMSU)和四个模型上系统研究MCQA评估框架，分析模型对选项顺序、问题改写和选项改写的敏感性。

Result: 模型不仅对选项顺序敏感，也对问题表述和选项改写敏感，现有评估方法存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 提出了更简单的评估协议和指标，能够考虑细微变化并提供更详细的大型音频语言模型评估报告。

Abstract: Recent advances in large audio language models (LALMs) have primarily been
assessed using a multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) framework. However,
subtle changes, such as shifting the order of choices, result in substantially
different results. Existing MCQA frameworks do not account for this variability
and report a single accuracy number per benchmark or category. We dive into the
MCQA evaluation framework and conduct a systematic study spanning three
benchmarks (MMAU, MMAR and MMSU) and four models: Audio Flamingo 2, Audio
Flamingo 3, Qwen2.5-Omni-7B-Instruct, and Kimi-Audio-7B-Instruct. Our findings
indicate that models are sensitive not only to the ordering of choices, but
also to the paraphrasing of the question and the choices. Finally, we propose a
simpler evaluation protocol and metric that account for subtle variations and
provide a more detailed evaluation report of LALMs within the MCQA framework.

Motivation: 当前基于公开网络数据训练大语言模型的范式不可持续，高质量专业领域数据接近枯竭。联邦学习成为下一代AI的实用解决方案，但LoRA在联邦设置中的通信开销和参数冲突是关键挑战。

Method: 提出FedSRD框架：重要性感知稀疏化保持LoRA更新结构完整性；服务器在完整秩空间重构和聚合更新以缓解冲突；将全局更新分解为稀疏低秩格式进行广播。还提出计算开销更低的FedSRD-e变体。

Conclusion: FedSRD有效解决了联邦学习中LoRA参数的通信瓶颈和冲突问题，为下一代去中心化AI提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The current paradigm of training large language models (LLMs) on publicly
available Web data is becoming unsustainable, with high-quality data sources in
specialized domains nearing exhaustion. Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a
practical solution for the next generation of AI on a decentralized Web,
enabling privacy-preserving collaborative fine-tuning by leveraging private
data distributed across a global client base. While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
is the standard for efficient fine-tuning, its application in federated
settings presents a critical challenge: communication overhead remains a
significant bottleneck across the Web's heterogeneous network conditions. The
structural redundancy within LoRA parameters not only incurs a heavy
communication burden but also introduces conflicts when aggregating client
updates. To address this, we propose FedSRD, a Sparsify-Reconstruct-Decompose
framework designed for communication-efficient FL. We first introduce an
importance-aware sparsification method that preserves the structural integrity
of LoRA updates to reduce the uploaded parameter count. The server then
reconstructs and aggregates these updates in a full-rank space to mitigate
conflicts. Finally, it decomposes the global update into a sparse low-rank
format for broadcast, ensuring a symmetrically efficient cycle. We also propose
an efficient variant, FedSRD-e, to reduce computational overhead. Experimental
results on 10 benchmarks demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces
communication costs by up to 90\% while even improving model performance on
heterogeneous client data.

Conclusion: 需要更有效和可扩展的审计框架来解决多人口统计目标偏见检测的挑战。

Abstract: Large-scale web-scraped text corpora used to train general-purpose AI models
often contain harmful demographic-targeted social biases, creating a regulatory
need for data auditing and developing scalable bias-detection methods. Although
prior work has investigated biases in text datasets and related detection
methods, these studies remain narrow in scope. They typically focus on a single
content type (e.g., hate speech), cover limited demographic axes, overlook
biases affecting multiple demographics simultaneously, and analyze limited
techniques. Consequently, practitioners lack a holistic understanding of the
strengths and limitations of recent large language models (LLMs) for automated
bias detection. In this study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework
aimed at English texts to assess the ability of LLMs in detecting
demographic-targeted social biases. To align with regulatory requirements, we
frame bias detection as a multi-label task using a demographic-focused
taxonomy. We then conduct a systematic evaluation with models across scales and
techniques, including prompting, in-context learning, and fine-tuning. Using
twelve datasets spanning diverse content types and demographics, our study
demonstrates the promise of fine-tuned smaller models for scalable detection.
However, our analyses also expose persistent gaps across demographic axes and
multi-demographic targeted biases, underscoring the need for more effective and
scalable auditing frameworks.

Abstract: Knowledge of the medical decision process, which can be modeled as medical
decision trees (MDTs), is critical to building clinical decision support
systems. However, current MDT construction methods rely heavily on
time-consuming and laborious manual annotation. To address this challenge, we
propose PI-LoRA (Path-Integrated LoRA), a novel low-rank adaptation method for
automatically extracting MDTs from clinical guidelines and textbooks. We
integrate gradient path information to capture synergistic effects between
different modules, enabling more effective and reliable rank allocation. This
framework ensures that the most critical modules receive appropriate rank
allocations while less important ones are pruned, resulting in a more efficient
and accurate model for extracting medical decision trees from clinical texts.
Extensive experiments on medical guideline datasets demonstrate that our
PI-LoRA method significantly outperforms existing parameter-efficient
fine-tuning approaches for the Text2MDT task, achieving better accuracy with
substantially reduced model complexity. The proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art results while maintaining a lightweight architecture, making
it particularly suitable for clinical decision support systems where
computational resources may be limited.

Abstract: With the rapid development of online medical platforms, consumer health
questions (CHQs) are inefficient in diagnosis due to redundant information and
frequent non-professional terms. The medical question summary (MQS) task aims
to transform CHQs into streamlined doctors' frequently asked questions (FAQs),
but existing methods still face challenges such as poor identification of
question focus and model hallucination. This paper explores the potential of
large language models (LLMs) in the MQS task and finds that direct fine-tuning
is prone to focus identification bias and generates unfaithful content. To this
end, we propose an optimization framework based on core focus guidance. First,
a prompt template is designed to drive the LLMs to extract the core focus from
the CHQs that is faithful to the original text. Then, a fine-tuning dataset is
constructed in combination with the original CHQ-FAQ pairs to improve the
ability to identify the focus of the question. Finally, a multi-dimensional
quality evaluation and selection mechanism is proposed to comprehensively
improve the quality of the summary from multiple dimensions. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on two widely-adopted MQS datasets using three
established evaluation metrics. The proposed framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all measures, demonstrating a significant
boost in the model's ability to identify critical focus of questions and a
notable mitigation of hallucinations. The source codes are freely available at

implementations typically rely on a single agent, but they suffer from limited
context length and noisy tool responses. A natural solution is to adopt a
multi-agent framework with planner- and worker-agents to manage context.
However, no existing methods support effective reinforcement learning
post-training of tool-integrated multi-agent frameworks. To address this gap,
we propose Multi-Agent Tool-Integrated Policy Optimization (MATPO), which
enables distinct roles (planner and worker) to be trained within a single LLM
instance using role-specific prompts via reinforcement learning. MATPO is
derived from a principled credit assignment mechanism across planner and worker
rollouts. This design eliminates the need to deploy multiple LLMs, which would
be memory-intensive, while preserving the benefits of specialization.
Experiments on GAIA-text, WebWalkerQA, and FRAMES show that MATPO consistently
outperforms single-agent baselines by an average of 18.38% relative improvement
in performance and exhibits greater robustness to noisy tool outputs. Our
findings highlight the effectiveness of unifying multiple agent roles within a
single LLM and provide practical insights for stable and efficient multi-agent
RL training.

*Chanjoo Jung,Jaehyung Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TiTok是一个新的框架，通过token级知识转移实现有效的LoRA移植，避免了对额外模型的需求，在多个基准测试中平均性能提升4-8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决参数高效微调方法如LoRA的适配参数依赖于基础模型且无法在不同骨干网络间迁移的问题，同时避免知识蒸馏对训练数据的依赖和TransLoRA需要额外判别器模型的复杂性。

Method: 通过对比源模型在有和没有LoRA时的差异，捕获任务相关信息，突出信息丰富的token，并选择性过滤合成数据，无需额外模型或开销。

Result: 在三个基准测试的多种迁移设置中，该方法始终有效，相比基线平均性能提升4-8%。

Conclusion: TiTok框架通过token级知识转移实现了有效的LoRA移植，简化了流程并提升了性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely applied in real world scenarios, but
fine-tuning them comes with significant computational and storage costs.
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA mitigate these
costs, but the adapted parameters are dependent on the base model and cannot be
transferred across different backbones. One way to address this issue is
through knowledge distillation, but its effectiveness inherently depends on
training data. Recent work such as TransLoRA avoids this by generating
synthetic data, but this adds complexity because it requires training an
additional discriminator model. In this paper, we propose TiTok, a new
framework that enables effective LoRA Transplantation through Token-level
knowledge transfer. Specifically, TiTok captures task-relevant information
through a contrastive excess between a source model with and without LoRA. This
excess highlights informative tokens and enables selective filtering of
synthetic data, all without additional models or overhead. Through experiments
on three benchmarks across multiple transfer settings, our experiments show
that the proposed method is consistently effective, achieving average
performance gains of +4~8% compared to baselines overall.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文分析了MoE架构在多种语言数据上的稀疏路由动态，发现中间层存在跨语言路由对齐现象，并提出通过干预中间层路由来提升多语言性能的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解MoE架构如何处理多语言数据，特别是稀疏路由动态如何响应不同语言，这对于提升多语言LLM性能至关重要。

Method: 使用并行多语言数据集分析专家路由模式，引入推理时干预方法，通过促进中间层任务专家的激活来引导路由器。

Result: 发现MoE模型在中间层表现出显著的跨语言路由对齐，且语言性能与这些层中与英语的路由相似性密切相关。干预方法在多个模型和语言上实现了1-2%的稳定性能提升。

Conclusion: MoE处理非英语文本的能力受限于其利用语言通用专家的能力，中间层的跨语言路由对齐是提升多语言性能的关键。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become the key to scaling modern
LLMs, yet little is understood about how their sparse routing dynamics respond
to multilingual data. In this work, we analyze expert routing patterns using
parallel multilingual datasets and present highly interpretable layer-wise
phenomena. We find that MoE models route tokens in language-specific ways in
the early and late decoder layers but exhibit significant cross-lingual routing
alignment in middle layers, mirroring parameter-sharing trends observed in
dense LLMs. In particular, we reveal a clear, strong correlation between a
model's performance in a given language and how similarly its tokens are routed
to English in these layers. Extending beyond correlation, we explore
inference-time interventions that induce higher cross-lingual routing
alignment. We introduce a method that steers the router by promoting
middle-layer task experts frequently activated in English, and it successfully
increases multilingual performance. These 1-2% gains are remarkably consistent
across two evaluation tasks, three models, and 15+ languages, especially given
that these simple interventions override routers of extensively trained,
state-of-the-art LLMs. In comparison, interventions outside of the middle
layers or targeting multilingual-specialized experts only yield performance
degradation. Altogether, we present numerous findings that explain how MoEs
process non-English text and demonstrate that generalization is limited by the
model's ability to leverage language-universal experts in all languages.

TL;DR: JSON Whisperer框架让LLM生成RFC 6902差异补丁而非完整JSON文档，通过EASE编码解决数组索引问题，显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法每次编辑都重新生成整个JSON结构，计算效率低下，需要更高效的增量编辑方法。

Method: 提出JSON Whisperer框架，引入EASE编码将数组转换为带稳定键的字典，消除索引算术复杂性。

Result: 补丁生成结合EASE减少31%的token使用量，编辑质量保持在完整再生的95%以内，复杂指令和列表操作效果更佳。

Conclusion: JSON Whisperer通过补丁生成和EASE编码实现了高效的JSON文档编辑，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can modify JSON documents through natural
language commands, but current approaches regenerate entire structures for each
edit, resulting in computational inefficiency. We present JSON Whisperer, a
framework that enables LLMs to generate RFC 6902 diff patches-expressing only
the necessary modifications-rather than complete documents. We identify two key
challenges in patch-based editing: (1) LLMs often miss related updates when
generating isolated patches, and (2) array manipulations require tracking index
shifts across operations, which LLMs handle poorly. To address these issues, we
introduce EASE (Explicitly Addressed Sequence Encoding), which transforms
arrays into dictionaries with stable keys, eliminating index arithmetic
complexities. Our evaluation shows that patch generation with EASE reduces
token usage by 31% while maintaining edit quality within 5% of full
regeneration with particular gains for complex instructions and list
manipulations. The dataset is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成人阅读障碍在非英语环境中研究不足，特别是僧伽罗语这类低资源语言缺乏语言可访问性工具，严重影响患者的个人和职业生活。

Method: 使用Whisper进行语音转文本，SinBERT识别常见阅读障碍错误，结合mT5和Mistral模型生成纠正文本，最后用gTTS转回语音，形成完整多模态反馈循环。

Result: 尽管僧伽罗语数据集有限，系统仍达到0.66转录准确率、0.7纠正准确率和0.65整体系统准确率。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了包容性NLP技术在代表性不足语言中的重要性，并展示了一个实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Dyslexia in adults remains an under-researched and under-served area,
particularly in non-English-speaking contexts, despite its significant impact
on personal and professional lives. This work addresses that gap by focusing on
Sinhala, a low-resource language with limited tools for linguistic
accessibility. We present an assistive system explicitly designed for
Sinhala-speaking adults with dyslexia. The system integrates Whisper for
speech-to-text conversion, SinBERT, an open-sourced fine-tuned BERT model
trained for Sinhala to identify common dyslexic errors, and a combined mT5 and
Mistral-based model to generate corrected text. Finally, the output is
converted back to speech using gTTS, creating a complete multimodal feedback
loop. Despite the challenges posed by limited Sinhala-language datasets, the
system achieves 0.66 transcription accuracy and 0.7 correction accuracy with
0.65 overall system accuracy. These results demonstrate both the feasibility
and effectiveness of the approach. Ultimately, this work highlights the
importance of inclusive Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies in
underrepresented languages and showcases a practical

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段检索架构，结合轻量级ModernBERT进行初步候选检索和ColBERTv2进行精细重排序，在生物医学RAG系统中实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中检索模块性能限制问题，平衡专业领域语言理解与计算成本之间的权衡

Method: 使用ModernBERT双向编码器进行高效初始候选检索，结合ColBERTv2延迟交互模型进行细粒度重排序，在PubMedQA上使用10k问答对微调IR模块

Result: ColBERT重排序器将Recall@3提升4.2个百分点；在MIRAGE QA基准测试中达到0.4448的平均准确率，优于MedCPT等基线模型

Conclusion: 两阶段检索架构在生物医学RAG中表现优异，但性能关键依赖于检索器和重排序器的联合微调过程

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful technique for enriching
Large Language Models (LLMs) with external knowledge, allowing for factually
grounded responses, a critical requirement in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare. However, the efficacy of RAG systems is fundamentally restricted by
the performance of their retrieval module, since irrelevant or semantically
misaligned documents directly compromise the accuracy of the final generated
response. General-purpose dense retrievers can struggle with the nuanced
language of specialised domains, while the high accuracy of in-domain models is
often achieved at prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we aim to
address this trade-off by developing and evaluating a two-stage retrieval
architecture that combines a lightweight ModernBERT bidirectional encoder for
efficient initial candidate retrieval with a ColBERTv2 late-interaction model
for fine-grained re-ranking. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of our
retriever module performance and RAG system performance in the biomedical
context, fine-tuning the IR module using 10k question-passage pairs from
PubMedQA. Our analysis of the retriever module confirmed the positive impact of
the ColBERT re-ranker, which improved Recall@3 by up to 4.2 percentage points
compared to its retrieve-only counterpart. When integrated into the biomedical
RAG, our IR module leads to a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 0.4448 on
the five tasks of the MIRAGE question-answering benchmark, outperforming strong
baselines such as MedCPT (0.4436). Our ablation studies reveal that this
performance is critically dependent on a joint fine-tuning process that aligns
the retriever and re-ranker; otherwise, the re-ranker might degrade the
performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文构建了一个新基准测试，评估在少于1000万和1亿token上预训练的语言模型识别格莱斯会话准则违反情况的能力，并与儿童和大型语言模型的表现进行对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐含意义是人类交流的重要组成部分，需要语言模型能够识别和解释。基于格莱斯提出的会话准则理论，研究语言模型是否能够像人类一样识别准则违反并推导语用含义。

Method: 基于Surian等人对儿童识别格莱斯准则违反的研究，构建新基准测试，比较在不同规模数据上预训练的BabyLMs在五种会话准则上的表现，并与儿童和大型语言模型对比。

Result: 在少于1亿token上训练的模型表现优于在少于1000万token上训练的模型，但仍未达到儿童和大型语言模型的水平。数据量的适度增加改善了某些语用行为方面，导致对语用维度更细粒度的区分。

Conclusion: 虽然增加训练数据能提升语言模型识别格莱斯准则违反的能力，但当前小规模模型仍无法达到人类儿童或大规模语言模型的语用理解水平。

Abstract: Implicit meanings are integral to human communication, making it essential
for language models to be capable of identifying and interpreting them. Grice
(1975) proposed a set of conversational maxims that guide cooperative dialogue,
noting that speakers may deliberately violate these principles to express
meanings beyond literal words, and that listeners, in turn, recognize such
violations to draw pragmatic inferences.
  Building on Surian et al. (1996)'s study of children's sensitivity to
violations of Gricean maxims, we introduce a novel benchmark to test whether
language models pretrained on less than 10M and less than 100M tokens can
distinguish maxim-adhering from maxim-violating utterances. We compare these
BabyLMs across five maxims and situate their performance relative to children
and a Large Language Model (LLM) pretrained on 3T tokens.
  We find that overall, models trained on less than 100M tokens outperform
those trained on less than 10M, yet fall short of child-level and LLM
competence. Our results suggest that modest data increases improve some aspects
of pragmatic behavior, leading to finer-grained differentiation between
pragmatic dimensions.

Motivation: 尽管混合架构在建模质量和计算效率方面表现出色，但缺乏对混合策略的系统比较和有效性关键因素的分析，需要为社区提供清晰的指导。

Method: 采用整体评估方法，从语言建模性能、长上下文能力、扩展分析以及训练和推理效率等多个角度评估层间（顺序）和层内（并行）融合设计。

Result: 通过研究计算原语的核心特征，识别了每种混合策略最关键的元素，并为两种混合模型提出了最优设计配方。

Conclusion: 综合分析为开发混合语言模型提供了实用指导和宝贵见解，有助于优化架构配置。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models demonstrates that hybrid
architectures--combining self-attention mechanisms with structured state space
models like Mamba--can achieve a compelling balance between modeling quality
and computational efficiency, particularly for long-context tasks. While these
hybrid models show promising performance, systematic comparisons of
hybridization strategies and analyses on the key factors behind their
effectiveness have not been clearly shared to the community. In this work, we
present a holistic evaluation of hybrid architectures based on inter-layer
(sequential) or intra-layer (parallel) fusion. We evaluate these designs from a
variety of perspectives: language modeling performance, long-context
capabilities, scaling analysis, and training and inference efficiency. By
investigating the core characteristics of their computational primitive, we
identify the most critical elements for each hybridization strategy and further
propose optimal design recipes for both hybrid models. Our comprehensive
analysis provides practical guidance and valuable insights for developing
hybrid language models, facilitating the optimization of architectural
configurations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球近一半语言濒临灭绝，标准ASR系统需要语句级监督数据，但大多数濒危语言缺乏这种格式的数据。论文旨在降低构建濒危语言ASR系统的数据门槛。

Method: 使用短格式发音资源作为替代数据源，验证了仅需少量此类数据即可构建ASR系统。以曼克斯盖尔语(约2200名使用者)和康沃尔语(约600名使用者)为案例进行研究。

Result: 仅用40分钟的发音数据就能为曼克斯盖尔语开发出可用的ASR系统(词错误率<50%)，并在康沃尔语上成功复现了该方法。

Conclusion: 构建濒危语言ASR系统的数据门槛远低于预期，这为无法满足传统ASR系统高数据要求的濒危语言社区带来了希望。

Abstract: Nearly half of the world's languages are endangered. Speech technologies such
as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) are central to revival efforts, yet most
languages remain unsupported because standard pipelines expect utterance-level
supervised data. Speech data often exist for endangered languages but rarely
match these formats. Manx Gaelic ($\sim$2,200 speakers), for example, has had
transcribed speech since 1948, yet remains unsupported by modern systems. In
this paper, we explore how little data, and in what form, is needed to build
ASR for critically endangered languages. We show that a short-form
pronunciation resource is a viable alternative, and that 40 minutes of such
data produces usable ASR for Manx ($<$50\% WER). We replicate our approach,
applying it to Cornish ($\sim$600 speakers), another critically endangered
language. Results show that the barrier to entry, in quantity and form, is far
lower than previously thought, giving hope to endangered language communities
that cannot afford to meet the requirements arbitrarily imposed upon them.

Motivation: 在LLM训练过程中，下游任务性能经常出现显著波动，使得难以确定真正最佳性能的检查点，这影响了模型选择的有效性。

Method: 研究了两种后处理检查点集成方法：检查点平均和集成，通过聚合相邻检查点来减少性能波动。

Result: 实证和理论分析表明，这些方法能够提高下游任务性能的稳定性，且无需改变训练过程。

Conclusion: 检查点集成方法可以有效解决LLM训练中的性能波动问题，提高模型选择的可靠性。

Abstract: When training large language models (LLMs), it is common practice to track
downstream task performance throughout the training process and select the
checkpoint with the highest validation score. However, downstream metrics often
exhibit substantial fluctuations, making it difficult to identify the
checkpoint that truly represents the best-performing model. In this study, we
empirically analyze the stability of downstream task performance in an LLM
trained on diverse web-scale corpora. We find that task scores frequently
fluctuate throughout training, both at the aggregate and example levels. To
address this instability, we investigate two post-hoc checkpoint integration
methods: checkpoint averaging and ensemble, motivated by the hypothesis that
aggregating neighboring checkpoints can reduce performance volatility. We
demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that these methods improve
downstream performance stability without requiring any changes to the training
procedure.

Motivation: 现有幻觉检测基准主要在序列级别操作且仅限于英语，缺乏细粒度的多语言监督，无法全面评估大语言模型在事实准确性方面的表现。

Method: 通过自动化三阶段流程构建数据集：1) 使用GPT-4o从维基百科生成问答对；2) 在无上下文设置下从多样化LLM获取可能包含幻觉的回答；3) 使用GPT-4o通过对比黄金答案和检索上下文自动标注幻觉span。

Result: 评估了多种幻觉检测方法，发现基于编码器的模型在所有语言中表现最强。PsiloQA展示了有效的跨语言泛化能力，并能稳健地迁移知识到其他基准，同时比人工标注数据集更具成本效益。

Conclusion: PsiloQA数据集和结果推动了在多语言设置下可扩展、细粒度幻觉检测的发展。

Abstract: Hallucination detection remains a fundamental challenge for the safe and
reliable deployment of large language models (LLMs), especially in applications
requiring factual accuracy. Existing hallucination benchmarks often operate at
the sequence level and are limited to English, lacking the fine-grained,
multilingual supervision needed for a comprehensive evaluation. In this work,
we introduce PsiloQA, a large-scale, multilingual dataset annotated with
span-level hallucinations across 14 languages. PsiloQA is constructed through
an automated three-stage pipeline: generating question-answer pairs from
Wikipedia using GPT-4o, eliciting potentially hallucinated answers from diverse
LLMs in a no-context setting, and automatically annotating hallucinated spans
using GPT-4o by comparing against golden answers and retrieved context. We
evaluate a wide range of hallucination detection methods -- including
uncertainty quantification, LLM-based tagging, and fine-tuned encoder models --
and show that encoder-based models achieve the strongest performance across
languages. Furthermore, PsiloQA demonstrates effective cross-lingual
generalization and supports robust knowledge transfer to other benchmarks, all
while being significantly more cost-efficient than human-annotated datasets.
Our dataset and results advance the development of scalable, fine-grained
hallucination detection in multilingual settings.

Motivation: 推理蒸馏虽然能有效提升大语言模型的推理能力，但可能导致基准污染问题，即蒸馏数据集中的评估数据会人为提升蒸馏模型的性能指标。

Method: 提出Token Probability Deviation (TBD)方法，基于蒸馏模型对已见问题生成近似确定性令牌、对未见问题生成更多低概率令牌的分析，通过量化生成令牌概率与高参考概率的偏差来进行检测。

Result: 在S1数据集上，该方法取得了0.918的AUC和0.470的TPR@1% FPR，表现出优异的检测性能。

Conclusion: TBD方法能有效检测推理蒸馏中的基准污染问题，为评估蒸馏模型的真实性能提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Reasoning distillation has emerged as an efficient and powerful paradigm for
enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However,
reasoning distillation may inadvertently cause benchmark contamination, where
evaluation data included in distillation datasets can inflate performance
metrics of distilled models. In this work, we formally define the task of
distillation data detection, which is uniquely challenging due to the partial
availability of distillation data. Then, we propose a novel and effective
method Token Probability Deviation (TBD), which leverages the probability
patterns of the generated output tokens. Our method is motivated by the
analysis that distilled models tend to generate near-deterministic tokens for
seen questions, while producing more low-probability tokens for unseen
questions. Our key idea behind TBD is to quantify how far the generated tokens'
probabilities deviate from a high reference probability. In effect, our method
achieves competitive detection performance by producing lower scores for seen
questions than for unseen questions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, achieving an AUC of 0.918 and a TPR@1% FPR of
0.470 on the S1 dataset.

Motivation: 现有安全基准很少测试政治操纵、宣传和虚假信息生成、监控和信息控制等领域的漏洞，而LLM在这些领域的失败可能产生直接的社会政治后果。

Method: 创建SocialHarmBench数据集，包含585个提示，涵盖7个社会政治类别和34个国家，评估LLM在政治敏感情境中的表现。

Result: 开源模型表现出高脆弱性，Mistral-7B在历史修正主义、宣传和政治操纵等领域的攻击成功率高达97-98%。时间和地理分析显示LLM对21世纪或前20世纪背景以及拉美、美国、英国等地区特别脆弱。

Conclusion: 当前的安全措施无法推广到高风险的社会政治环境中，暴露了系统性偏见，并引发了对LLM在维护人权和民主价值观方面可靠性的担忧。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in contexts where
their failures can have direct sociopolitical consequences. Yet, existing
safety benchmarks rarely test vulnerabilities in domains such as political
manipulation, propaganda and disinformation generation, or surveillance and
information control. We introduce SocialHarmBench, a dataset of 585 prompts
spanning 7 sociopolitical categories and 34 countries, designed to surface
where LLMs most acutely fail in politically charged contexts. Our evaluations
reveal several shortcomings: open-weight models exhibit high vulnerability to
harmful compliance, with Mistral-7B reaching attack success rates as high as
97% to 98% in domains such as historical revisionism, propaganda, and political
manipulation. Moreover, temporal and geographic analyses show that LLMs are
most fragile when confronted with 21st-century or pre-20th-century contexts,
and when responding to prompts tied to regions such as Latin America, the USA,
and the UK. These findings demonstrate that current safeguards fail to
generalize to high-stakes sociopolitical settings, exposing systematic biases
and raising concerns about the reliability of LLMs in preserving human rights
and democratic values. We share the SocialHarmBench benchmark at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调虽然能有效适应LLMs到下游任务，但训练数据的变异性会阻碍模型跨域泛化能力，特别是在NL2SQL任务中需要关注数据对齐问题。

Method: 通过比较训练集、目标数据和模型预测中SQL结构特征的分布来估计对齐程度，并在三个大型跨域NL2SQL基准和多个模型家族上进行综合实验。

Result: 结构对齐是微调成功的强预测因子：对齐度高时SFT带来准确率和SQL生成质量的显著提升；对齐度低时改进很小或没有。

Conclusion: 在NL2SQL任务中，对齐感知的数据选择对于有效微调和泛化至关重要。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is an effective method for adapting Large
Language Models (LLMs) on downstream tasks. However, variability in training
data can hinder a model's ability to generalize across domains. This paper
studies the problem of dataset alignment for Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL or
text to SQL), examining how well SFT training data matches the structural
characteristics of target queries and how this alignment impacts model
performance. We hypothesize that alignment can be accurately estimated by
comparing the distributions of structural SQL features across the training set,
target data, and the model's predictions prior to SFT. Through comprehensive
experiments on three large cross-domain NL2SQL benchmarks and multiple model
families, we show that structural alignment is a strong predictor of
fine-tuning success. When alignment is high, SFT yields substantial gains in
accuracy and SQL generation quality; when alignment is low, improvements are
marginal or absent. These findings highlight the importance of alignment-aware
data selection for effective fine-tuning and generalization in NL2SQL tasks.

Result: 在TruthfulQA和合成事实-幻觉数据集上评估，LSD达到F1分数0.92、AUROC 0.96和聚类准确率0.89，优于SelfCheckGPT和语义熵基线，速度比基于采样的方法快5-20倍。

Conclusion: LSD提供了一个可扩展、模型无关的实时幻觉监测机制，并为大语言模型中事实一致性的几何特性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent yet factually incorrect
statements-a phenomenon known as hallucination-posing serious risks in
high-stakes domains. We present Layer-wise Semantic Dynamics (LSD), a geometric
framework for hallucination detection that analyzes the evolution of
hidden-state semantics across transformer layers. Unlike prior methods that
rely on multiple sampling passes or external verification sources, LSD operates
intrinsically within the model's representational space. Using margin-based
contrastive learning, LSD aligns hidden activations with ground-truth
embeddings derived from a factual encoder, revealing a distinct separation in
semantic trajectories: factual responses preserve stable alignment, while
hallucinations exhibit pronounced semantic drift across depth. Evaluated on the
TruthfulQA and synthetic factual-hallucination datasets, LSD achieves an
F1-score of 0.92, AUROC of 0.96, and clustering accuracy of 0.89, outperforming
SelfCheckGPT and Semantic Entropy baselines while requiring only a single
forward pass. This efficiency yields a 5-20x speedup over sampling-based
methods without sacrificing precision or interpretability. LSD offers a
scalable, model-agnostic mechanism for real-time hallucination monitoring and
provides new insights into the geometry of factual consistency within large
language models.

TL;DR: 本文为纳瓦特尔语构建了上下文无关文法，用于生成大量语法正确的句子以扩充语料库，从而改善语言模型的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纳瓦特尔语是数字资源匮乏的π语言，缺乏可用于机器学习的语料库，需要人工生成句子来扩充训练数据。

Method: 使用上下文无关文法生成语法正确的纳瓦特尔语句子，扩充π-yalli语料库，并用FastText等算法进行训练和评估。

Result: 初步结果显示，使用文法相比某些大型语言模型取得了比较性改进，但需要更有效的文法建模才能实现更显著的提升。

Conclusion: 文法方法可以有效扩充低资源语言的语料库，但要获得更大改进需要开发更精确的语言模型文法。

Abstract: In this article we introduce a context-free grammar (CFG) for the Nawatl
language. Nawatl (or Nahuatl) is an Amerindian language of the $\pi$-language
type, i.e. a language with few digital resources, in which the corpora
available for machine learning are virtually non-existent. The objective here
is to generate a significant number of grammatically correct artificial
sentences, in order to increase the corpora available for language model
training. We want to show that a grammar enables us significantly to expand a
corpus in Nawatl which we call $\pi$-\textsc{yalli}. The corpus, thus enriched,
enables us to train algorithms such as FastText and to evaluate them on
sentence-level semantic tasks. Preliminary results show that by using the
grammar, comparative improvements are achieved over some LLMs. However, it is
observed that to achieve more significant improvement, grammars that model the
Nawatl language even more effectively are required.

*Om Dobariya,Akhil Kumar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大型语言模型中，不礼貌的提示词比礼貌的提示词表现更好，准确率从不礼貌的80.8%提升到非常不礼貌的84.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自然语言提示中礼貌程度和语气对大型语言模型性能的影响，特别是对多项选择题准确率的影响。

Method: 创建了50个基础问题，每个问题重写为5种语气变体（非常礼貌、礼貌、中性、粗鲁、非常粗鲁），使用ChatGPT 4o评估响应，并应用配对样本t检验评估统计显著性。

Result: 与预期相反，不礼貌的提示词持续优于礼貌的提示词，准确率从非常礼貌提示的80.8%到非常粗鲁提示的84.8%。

Conclusion: 研究结果与早期研究不同，表明较新的LLM可能对语气变化有不同的响应，强调了研究提示语用方面的重要性，并提出了关于人机交互社会维度的更广泛问题。

Abstract: The wording of natural language prompts has been shown to influence the
performance of large language models (LLMs), yet the role of politeness and
tone remains underexplored. In this study, we investigate how varying levels of
prompt politeness affect model accuracy on multiple-choice questions. We
created a dataset of 50 base questions spanning mathematics, science, and
history, each rewritten into five tone variants: Very Polite, Polite, Neutral,
Rude, and Very Rude, yielding 250 unique prompts. Using ChatGPT 4o, we
evaluated responses across these conditions and applied paired sample t-tests
to assess statistical significance. Contrary to expectations, impolite prompts
consistently outperformed polite ones, with accuracy ranging from 80.8% for
Very Polite prompts to 84.8% for Very Rude prompts. These findings differ from
earlier studies that associated rudeness with poorer outcomes, suggesting that
newer LLMs may respond differently to tonal variation. Our results highlight
the importance of studying pragmatic aspects of prompting and raise broader
questions about the social dimensions of human-AI interaction.

*Khalid Mehtab Khan,Anagha Kulkarni*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AWARE框架通过提升模型对领域特定语言、上下文和类别重叠的感知能力，显著改善了学生反思中文化资本主题的识别效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别学生反思中的文化资本主题有助于促进公平学习环境，但这些主题通常以叙事形式存在而非直接关键词，标准NLP模型难以检测。

Method: AWARE框架包含三个核心组件：领域感知（适应学生反思的语言风格）、上下文感知（生成考虑全文的句子嵌入）、类别重叠感知（使用多标签策略识别主题共存）。

Result: AWARE在Macro-F1上比强基线提升2.1个百分点，在所有主题上均显示出显著改进。

Conclusion: 该工作为任何依赖叙事上下文意义的文本分类任务提供了稳健且可推广的方法论。

Abstract: Identifying cultural capital (CC) themes in student reflections can offer
valuable insights that help foster equitable learning environments in
classrooms. However, themes such as aspirational goals or family support are
often woven into narratives, rather than appearing as direct keywords. This
makes them difficult to detect for standard NLP models that process sentences
in isolation. The core challenge stems from a lack of awareness, as standard
models are pre-trained on general corpora, leaving them blind to the
domain-specific language and narrative context inherent to the data. To address
this, we introduce AWARE, a framework that systematically attempts to improve a
transformer model's awareness for this nuanced task. AWARE has three core
components: 1) Domain Awareness, adapting the model's vocabulary to the
linguistic style of student reflections; 2) Context Awareness, generating
sentence embeddings that are aware of the full essay context; and 3) Class
Overlap Awareness, employing a multi-label strategy to recognize the
coexistence of themes in a single sentence. Our results show that by making the
model explicitly aware of the properties of the input, AWARE outperforms a
strong baseline by 2.1 percentage points in Macro-F1 and shows considerable
improvements across all themes. This work provides a robust and generalizable
methodology for any text classification task in which meaning depends on the
context of the narrative.

Motivation: 大型语言模型需要大量计算资源进行微调，本文旨在在GPU和内存受限环境下实现高效的医疗推理能力提升。

Method: 使用参数高效调优技术（LoRA和QLoRA），在公开医疗推理数据集上对LLaMA-3.2-3B模型进行适配。

Result: 模型在保持推理能力的同时，推理连贯性和事实准确性得到提升，内存使用比标准全微调减少高达60%。

Conclusion: 轻量级适配可以保持强大的医疗问答推理能力，为低资源研究环境部署LLM提供了实用策略，并提供了平衡效率和领域专业化的见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and LLaMA have demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities but require significant computational resources
for fine-tuning. This paper presents a resource-efficient fine-tuning approach
for LLaMA-3.2-3B to enhance medical chain-of-thought reasoning while operating
under constrained GPU and memory settings. Using parameter-efficient tuning
techniques such as LoRA and QLoRA, we adapt the base model on publicly
available medical reasoning datasets. The model achieves improved reasoning
coherence and factual accuracy while reducing memory usage by up to 60%
compared to standard full fine-tuning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates
that lightweight adaptations can retain strong reasoning capability in medical
question-answering tasks. This work highlights practical strategies for
deploying LLMs in low-resource research environments and provides insights into
balancing efficiency and domain specialization for medical AI systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用Unicode变体选择器实现不可感知越狱攻击的方法，通过在恶意问题后附加不可见的变体选择器，使提示在视觉上与原问题相同但分词被秘密改变，从而诱导有害响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉模态的越狱攻击依赖不可感知的对抗扰动，而文本模态攻击通常需要可见修改。本文旨在探索文本模态的不可感知越狱攻击可能性。

Method: 提出基于链式搜索的流水线来生成包含不可见变体选择器的对抗后缀，这些后缀在屏幕上不可见但会改变文本的分词方式。

Result: 实验表明该方法在四个对齐LLM上实现了高攻击成功率，并能泛化到提示注入攻击，且不会产生任何可见的提示修改。

Conclusion: 通过利用Unicode变体选择器，可以实现文本模态的不可感知越狱攻击，这揭示了当前LLM安全防护的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: Jailbreaking attacks on the vision modality typically rely on imperceptible
adversarial perturbations, whereas attacks on the textual modality are
generally assumed to require visible modifications (e.g., non-semantic
suffixes). In this paper, we introduce imperceptible jailbreaks that exploit a
class of Unicode characters called variation selectors. By appending invisible
variation selectors to malicious questions, the jailbreak prompts appear
visually identical to original malicious questions on screen, while their
tokenization is "secretly" altered. We propose a chain-of-search pipeline to
generate such adversarial suffixes to induce harmful responses. Our experiments
show that our imperceptible jailbreaks achieve high attack success rates
against four aligned LLMs and generalize to prompt injection attacks, all
without producing any visible modifications in the written prompt. Our code is

Motivation: 结合习语理解和方言理解两个任务，使用区域习语作为方言理解的测试标准，为魁北克法语方言创建专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建了两个数据集：QFrCoRE包含4,633个习语短语实例，QFrCoRT包含171个区域习语词汇实例，并提供了可复现的方法论。通过94个LLM进行实验验证。

Result: 实验证明，区域习语基准是衡量模型在特定方言中熟练度的可靠工具。

Conclusion: 区域习语可以作为有效的方言理解评估指标，提出的方法论可推广到其他方言的基准构建。

Abstract: The tasks of idiom understanding and dialect understanding are both
well-established benchmarks in natural language processing. In this paper, we
propose combining them, and using regional idioms as a test of dialect
understanding. Towards this end, we propose two new benchmark datasets for the
Quebec dialect of French: QFrCoRE, which contains 4,633 instances of idiomatic
phrases, and QFrCoRT, which comprises 171 regional instances of idiomatic
words. We explain how to construct these corpora, so that our methodology can
be replicated for other dialects. Our experiments with 94 LLM demonstrate that
our regional idiom benchmarks are a reliable tool for measuring a model's

TL;DR: 提出GQR方法，通过轻量级文本检索器增强视觉中心模型，在视觉文档检索中实现性能与效率的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态编码器在视觉文档检索中表示规模过大、部署困难的问题，以及纯视觉方法受限于模态差距的挑战

Method: 引入引导查询精炼(GQR)，利用互补检索器的分数在测试时优化主检索器的查询嵌入

Result: GQR使视觉中心模型达到更大表示模型的性能，同时快14倍、内存需求减少54倍

Conclusion: GQR有效推进了多模态检索中性能与效率的帕累托前沿

Abstract: Multimodal encoders have pushed the boundaries of visual document retrieval,
matching textual query tokens directly to image patches and achieving
state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks. Recent models relying on
this paradigm have massively scaled the sizes of their query and document
representations, presenting obstacles to deployment and scalability in
real-world pipelines. Furthermore, purely vision-centric approaches may be
constrained by the inherent modality gap still exhibited by modern
vision-language models. In this work, we connect these challenges to the
paradigm of hybrid retrieval, investigating whether a lightweight dense text
retriever can enhance a stronger vision-centric model. Existing hybrid methods,
which rely on coarse-grained fusion of ranks or scores, fail to exploit the
rich interactions within each model's representation space. To address this, we
introduce Guided Query Refinement (GQR), a novel test-time optimization method
that refines a primary retriever's query embedding using guidance from a
complementary retriever's scores. Through extensive experiments on visual
document retrieval benchmarks, we demonstrate that GQR allows vision-centric
models to match the performance of models with significantly larger
representations, while being up to 14x faster and requiring 54x less memory.
Our findings show that GQR effectively pushes the Pareto frontier for
performance and efficiency in multimodal retrieval. We release our code at

Motivation: 为了解决法语自然语言理解评估不够全面的问题，需要创建一个涵盖广泛NLU能力的基准测试，特别关注法语特有的语言现象。

Method: 构建了包含23个多样化任务的COLE基准测试，涵盖情感分析、复述检测、语法判断和推理等能力，并对94个大语言模型进行了基准测试。

Result: 结果显示了闭源模型和开源模型之间存在显著性能差距，并识别出当前LLM面临的关键挑战领域，包括零样本抽取式问答、细粒度词义消歧和地区语言变体的理解。

Conclusion: COLE作为公共资源发布，旨在促进法语语言建模的进一步发展，为法语NLU研究提供了全面的评估框架。

Abstract: To address the need for a more comprehensive evaluation of French Natural

### [106] [SwiReasoning: Switch-Thinking in Latent and Explicit for Pareto-Superior Reasoning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05069)
*Dachuan Shi,Abedelkadir Asi,Keying Li,Xiangchi Yuan,Leyan Pan,Wenke Lee,Wen Xiao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SwiReasoning是一个无需训练的大语言模型推理框架，通过动态切换显式和隐式推理，基于熵趋势估计置信度来平衡探索与利用，限制思维块切换次数来防止过度思考，提高准确性和token效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式推理虽然能提高token效率，但面临两个挑战：1）纯隐式推理会扩散概率质量，引入噪声，阻碍收敛到高置信度解，降低准确性；2）即使没有显式文本，过度思考问题依然存在，浪费token并降低效率。

Method: 提出SwiReasoning框架，核心创新包括：1）基于下一个token分布的熵趋势估计块级置信度，动态切换显式和隐式推理；2）限制思维块最大切换次数来防止过度思考。

Result: 在数学和STEM基准测试中，SwiReasoning在不同模型家族和规模的推理LLMs上平均准确率提高1.5%-2.8%。在受限预算下，平均token效率提高56%-79%，预算越紧增益越大。

Conclusion: SwiReasoning通过动态切换显式和隐式推理，有效解决了隐式推理中的收敛问题和过度思考问题，在保持准确性的同时显著提高了token效率。

Abstract: Recent work shows that, beyond discrete reasoning through explicit
chain-of-thought steps, which are limited by the boundaries of natural
languages, large language models (LLMs) can also reason continuously in latent
space, allowing richer information per step and thereby improving token
efficiency. Despite this promise, latent reasoning still faces two challenges,
especially in training-free settings: 1) purely latent reasoning broadens the
search distribution by maintaining multiple implicit paths, which diffuses
probability mass, introduces noise, and impedes convergence to a single
high-confidence solution, thereby hurting accuracy; and 2) overthinking
persists even without explicit text, wasting tokens and degrading efficiency.
To address these issues, we introduce SwiReasoning, a training-free framework
for LLM reasoning which features two key innovations: 1) SwiReasoning
dynamically switches between explicit and latent reasoning, guided by
block-wise confidence estimated from entropy trends in next-token
distributions, to balance exploration and exploitation and promote timely
convergence. 2) By limiting the maximum number of thinking-block switches,
SwiReasoning curbs overthinking and improves token efficiency across varying
problem difficulties. On widely used mathematics and STEM benchmarks,
SwiReasoning consistently improves average accuracy by 1.5%-2.8% across
reasoning LLMs of different model families and scales. Furthermore, under
constrained budgets, SwiReasoning improves average token efficiency by 56%-79%,
with larger gains as budgets tighten.

TL;DR: 提出SLM-MUX方法，通过协调多个小语言模型(SLMs)构建更准确的系统，在数学推理任务上显著优于现有方法，仅用两个SLM就能媲美大型模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型数量快速增长，虽然单个模型精度不高但效率更好。现有协调方法主要针对前沿大模型，在小模型上表现不佳，需要专门的小模型协调方法。

Method: 三阶段方法：1) SLM-MUX多模型架构协调多个SLM；2) 模型选择搜索寻找互补模型；3) 测试时缩放策略优化SLM-MUX性能。

Result: 在MATH任务提升13.4%，GPQA提升8.8%，GSM8K提升7.0%。仅用两个SLM就在GPQA和GSM8K上超越Qwen 2.5 72B，在MATH上表现相当。

Conclusion: 小语言模型可以通过有效协调构建更准确高效的系统，SLM-MUX方法为小模型协同提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With the rapid development of language models, the number of small language
models (SLMs) has grown significantly. Although they do not achieve
state-of-the-art accuracy, they are more efficient and often excel at specific
tasks. This raises a natural question: can multiple SLMs be orchestrated into a
system where each contributes effectively, achieving higher accuracy than any
individual model? Existing orchestration methods have primarily targeted
frontier models (e.g., GPT-4) and perform suboptimally when applied to SLMs. To
address this gap, we propose a three-stage approach for orchestrating SLMs.
First, we introduce SLM-MUX, a multi-model architecture that effectively
coordinates multiple SLMs. Building on this, we develop two optimization
strategies: (i) a model selection search that identifies the most complementary
SLMs from a given pool, and (ii) test-time scaling tailored to SLM-MUX. Our
approach delivers strong results: Compared to existing orchestration methods,
our approach achieves up to 13.4% improvement on MATH, 8.8% on GPQA, and 7.0%
on GSM8K. With just two SLMS, SLM-MUX outperforms Qwen 2.5 72B on GPQA and
GSM8K, and matches its performance on MATH. We further provide theoretical
analyses to substantiate the advantages of our method. In summary, we
demonstrate that SLMs can be effectively orchestrated into more accurate and
efficient systems through the proposed approach.

Motivation: 解决生成式AI在教育中受限于LLM教学能力不足的问题，特别是缺乏反映真实学生学习过程的高质量训练数据。

Method: 使用参数高效微调技术，基于10万小时真实学生-导师交互数据训练TeachLM，开发真实学生模型以生成合成对话。

Result: 微调后显著改善对话和教学表现：学生发言时间翻倍、提问风格改善、对话轮次增加50%、教学个性化程度提高。

Conclusion: 基于真实学习数据的微调能有效提升LLM的教学对话能力，并提出利用合成对话生成进行多轮评估的新协议。

Abstract: The promise of generative AI to revolutionize education is constrained by the
pedagogical limits of large language models (LLMs). A major issue is the lack
of access to high-quality training data that reflect the learning of actual
students. Prompt engineering has emerged as a stopgap, but the ability of
prompts to encode complex pedagogical strategies in rule-based natural language
is inherently limited. To address this gap we introduce TeachLM - an LLM
optimized for teaching through parameter-efficient fine-tuning of
state-of-the-art models. TeachLM is trained on a dataset comprised of 100,000
hours of one-on-one, longitudinal student-tutor interactions maintained by
Polygence, which underwent a rigorous anonymization process to protect privacy.
We use parameter-efficient fine-tuning to develop an authentic student model
that enables the generation of high-fidelity synthetic student-tutor dialogues.
Building on this capability, we propose a novel multi-turn evaluation protocol
that leverages synthetic dialogue generation to provide fast, scalable, and
reproducible assessments of the dialogical capabilities of LLMs. Our
evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning on authentic learning data
significantly improves conversational and pedagogical performance - doubling
student talk time, improving questioning style, increasing dialogue turns by
50%, and greater personalization of instruction.

TL;DR: 提出了Tolerator解码策略，通过令牌级交叉验证改进扩散大语言模型的解码过程，允许已接受的令牌在后续步骤中被重新考虑和修正。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的离散扩散大语言模型解码策略存在关键限制：一旦令牌被接受，就无法在后续步骤中修正，导致早期错误持续影响最终输出质量。

Method: Tolerator采用两阶段过程：序列填充和迭代精炼。通过重新掩码和解码令牌子集，同时将剩余令牌作为上下文，实现令牌的交叉验证和修正。

Result: 在五个标准基准测试（语言理解、代码生成和数学）上，该方法在相同计算预算下相比基线实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: 解码算法对于充分发挥扩散大语言模型的潜力至关重要，Tolerator提供了一种无需训练的解码策略来提升模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) models, offering advantages such as
accelerated parallel decoding and bidirectional context modeling. However, the
vanilla decoding strategy in discrete dLLMs suffers from a critical limitation:
once a token is accepted, it can no longer be revised in subsequent steps. As a
result, early mistakes persist across iterations, harming both intermediate
predictions and final output quality. To address this issue, we propose
Tolerator (Token-Level Cross-Validation Refinement), a training-free decoding
strategy that leverages cross-validation among predicted tokens. Unlike
existing methods that follow a single progressive unmasking procedure,
Tolerator introduces a two-stage process: (i) sequence fill-up and (ii)
iterative refinement by remasking and decoding a subset of tokens while
treating the remaining as context. This design enables previously accepted
tokens to be reconsidered and corrected when necessary, leading to more
reliable diffusion decoding outputs. We evaluate Tolerator on five standard
benchmarks covering language understanding, code generation, and mathematics.
Experiments show that our method achieves consistent improvements over the
baselines under the same computational budget. These findings suggest that
decoding algorithms are crucial to realizing the full potential of diffusion
large language models. Code and data are publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测标准治疗下的肿瘤轨迹是肿瘤学中尚未满足的重要需求，传统模型无法捕捉异质性治疗范式下的肿瘤动态。

Method: 开发了SoC-DT框架，统一了反应-扩散肿瘤生长模型、离散标准治疗干预（手术、化疗、放疗）以及基因组和人口统计学个性化；提出了IMEX-SoC求解器确保稳定性。

Result: 在合成数据和真实胶质瘤数据上评估，SoC-DT在预测肿瘤动态方面始终优于经典PDE基线和纯数据驱动的神经模型。

Conclusion: SoC-DT通过将机制可解释性与现代可微分求解器相结合，为肿瘤学中患者特异性数字孪生建立了原则性基础，实现了生物学一致的肿瘤动态估计。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of tumor trajectories under standard-of-care (SoC)
therapies remains a major unmet need in oncology. This capability is essential
for optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression.
Conventional reaction-diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to
capture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is
hence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically
simulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in
genomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care
Digital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies
reaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery,
chemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization
to predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit
exponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures
stability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated
on both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently
outperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in
predicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern
differentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for
patient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent
tumor dynamics estimation. Code will be made available upon acceptance.

Abstract: In an era dominated by video content, understanding its structure and
dynamics has become increasingly important. This paper presents a hybrid
framework that combines a distributed multi-GPU inference system with an
interactive visualization platform for analyzing celebrity dynamics in video
episodes. The inference framework efficiently processes large volumes of video
data by leveraging optimized ONNX models, heterogeneous batch inference, and
high-throughput parallelism, ensuring scalable generation of timestamped
appearance records. These records are then transformed into a comprehensive
suite of visualizations, including appearance frequency charts, duration
analyses, pie charts, co-appearance matrices, network graphs, stacked area
charts, seasonal comparisons, and heatmaps. Together, these visualizations
provide multi-dimensional insights into video content, revealing patterns in
celebrity prominence, screen-time distribution, temporal dynamics,
co-appearance relationships, and intensity across episodes and seasons. The
interactive nature of the system allows users to dynamically explore data,
identify key moments, and uncover evolving relationships between individuals.
By bridging distributed recognition with structured, visually-driven analytics,
this work enables new possibilities for entertainment analytics, content
creation strategies, and audience engagement studies.

### [112] [Domain-Robust Marine Plastic Detection Using Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03294)
*Saanvi Kataria*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多种深度学习模型在水下塑料碎片跨域检测中的性能，发现轻量级CNN模型MobileNetV2在跨域泛化能力上表现最佳，而零样本模型CLIP和Gemini在精度和召回率方面呈现互补特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 海洋塑料污染是紧迫的环境威胁，需要可靠的水下碎片自动检测系统。然而，在一个数据集上训练的系统往往因域偏移而在新图像上性能下降，因此需要评估模型在跨域场景下的鲁棒性。

Method: 训练卷积神经网络（MobileNetV2、ResNet-18、EfficientNet-B0）和视觉变换器（DeiT-Tiny、ViT-B16）在标记的水下数据集上，然后在来自不同来源的跨域测试集上评估。同时评估了两个零样本模型CLIP ViT-L14和Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Result: 轻量级MobileNetV2在跨域性能上表现最佳（F1分数0.97），所有微调模型都实现了高精度（约99%），但在召回率上存在差异。零样本CLIP召回率约80%但精度较低（约56%），而Gemini则相反（精度约99%，召回率约81%）。

Conclusion: 经过监督训练的紧凑CNN能够有效泛化到跨域水下检测任务，而大型预训练视觉语言模型提供了互补优势，错误分析显示模型容易与珊瑚纹理、悬浮颗粒和镜面反射产生混淆。

Abstract: Marine plastic pollution is a pressing environmental threat, making reliable
automation for underwater debris detection essential. However, vision systems
trained on one dataset often degrade on new imagery due to domain shift. This
study benchmarks models for cross-domain robustness, training convolutional
neural networks - CNNs (MobileNetV2, ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (DeiT-Tiny, ViT-B16) on a labeled underwater dataset and then
evaluates them on a balanced cross-domain test set built from plastic-positive
images drawn from a different source and negatives from the training domain.
Two zero-shot models were assessed, CLIP ViT-L14 and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash,
that leverage pretraining to classify images without fine-tuning. Results show
the lightweight MobileNetV2 delivers the strongest cross-domain performance (F1
0.97), surpassing larger models. All fine-tuned models achieved high Precision
(around 99%), but differ in Recall, indicating varying sensitivity to plastic
instances. Zero-shot CLIP is comparatively sensitive (Recall around 80%) yet
prone to false positives (Precision around 56%), whereas Gemini exhibits the
inverse profile (Precision around 99%, Recall around 81%). Error analysis
highlights recurring confusions with coral textures, suspended particulates,
and specular glare. Overall, compact CNNs with supervised training can
generalize effectively for cross-domain underwater detection, while large
pretrained vision-language models provide complementary strengths.

TL;DR: VLCAP是一个阿拉伯语图像描述框架，结合CLIP视觉标签检索与多模态文本生成，通过可解释的视觉概念提升阿拉伯语描述的准确性和文化连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端图像描述方法缺乏可解释性的问题，为阿拉伯语图像描述提供基于视觉概念的基础，确保生成内容的文化连贯性和上下文准确性。

Method: 使用三种多语言编码器(mCLIP、AraCLIP、Jina V4)进行视觉标签检索，构建包含训练描述和Visual Genome翻译标签的混合词汇表，将检索到的标签转换为阿拉伯语提示，配合原图输入视觉语言模型(Qwen-VL和Gemini Pro Vision)生成描述。

Result: mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision组合在BLEU-1(5.34%)和余弦相似度(60.01%)上表现最佳，AraCLIP + Qwen-VL在LLM-judge评分(36.33%)上最高。

Conclusion: VLCAP框架通过可解释的视觉概念检索和生成，能够产生文化连贯、上下文准确的阿拉伯语图像描述，为阿拉伯语多模态理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present VLCAP, an Arabic image captioning framework that integrates
CLIP-based visual label retrieval with multimodal text generation. Rather than
relying solely on end-to-end captioning, VLCAP grounds generation in
interpretable Arabic visual concepts extracted with three multilingual
encoders, mCLIP, AraCLIP, and Jina V4, each evaluated separately for label
retrieval. A hybrid vocabulary is built from training captions and enriched
with about 21K general domain labels translated from the Visual Genome dataset,
covering objects, attributes, and scenes. The top-k retrieved labels are
transformed into fluent Arabic prompts and passed along with the original image
to vision-language models. In the second stage, we tested Qwen-VL and Gemini
Pro Vision for caption generation, resulting in six encoder-decoder
configurations. The results show that mCLIP + Gemini Pro Vision achieved the
best BLEU-1 (5.34%) and cosine similarity (60.01%), while AraCLIP + Qwen-VL
obtained the highest LLM-judge score (36.33%). This interpretable pipeline
enables culturally coherent and contextually accurate Arabic captions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 比较卷积神经网络和视觉Transformer在遥感图像分类任务中的表现差异，特别是在不同标签分布情况下的性能对比。

Method: 在SpaceNet数据集上进行控制实验，使用不平衡五类分割和平衡重采样分割（每类700张图像），采用相同的预处理、轻量增强和40轮训练预算。

Result: 在不平衡分割中，EfficientNet-B0达到93%测试准确率且延迟更低；ViT-Base也达到93%但参数更多。在平衡分割中，两者表现都很强，EfficientNet-B0达到99%，ViT-Base保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 平衡标签分布能缩小架构差距，但CNN在效率方面仍保持优势。

Abstract: We present a controlled comparison of a convolutional neural network
(EfficientNet-B0) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-Base) on SpaceNet under two
label-distribution regimes: a naturally imbalanced five-class split and a
balanced-resampled split with 700 images per class (70:20:10 train/val/test).
With matched preprocessing (224x224, ImageNet normalization), lightweight
augmentations, and a 40-epoch budget on a single NVIDIA P100, we report
accuracy, macro-F1, balanced accuracy, per-class recall, and deployment metrics
(model size and latency). On the imbalanced split, EfficientNet-B0 reaches 93%
test accuracy with strong macro-F1 and lower latency; ViT-Base is competitive
at 93% with a larger parameter count and runtime. On the balanced split, both
models are strong; EfficientNet-B0 reaches 99% while ViT-Base remains
competitive, indicating that balancing narrows architecture gaps while CNNs
retain an efficiency edge. We release manifests, logs, and per-image
predictions to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of vulnerable road users (VRUs), such as pedestrians and
cyclists, remains a critical global challenge, as conventional
infrastructure-based measures often prove inadequate in dynamic urban
environments. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in
visual perception and reasoning, open new opportunities for proactive and
context-aware VRU protection. However, existing surveys on AI applications for
VRUs predominantly focus on detection, offering limited coverage of other
vision-based tasks that are essential for comprehensive VRU understanding and
protection. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of recent progress in
camera-based AI sensing systems for VRU safety, with an emphasis on
developments from the past five years and emerging research trends. We
systematically examine four core tasks, namely detection and classification,
tracking and reidentification, trajectory prediction, and intent recognition
and prediction, which together form the backbone of AI-empowered proactive
solutions for VRU protection in intelligent transportation systems. To guide
future research, we highlight four major open challenges from the perspectives
of data, model, and deployment. By linking advances in visual AI with practical
considerations for real-world implementation, this survey aims to provide a
foundational reference for the development of next-generation sensing systems
to enhance VRU safety.

TL;DR: 地球观测基础模型(EOFMs)的表示空间对传感器架构高度敏感，理解这种差异对于当前EOFMs设计的缺陷和未来发展方向至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EOFMs大多在单一模态数据上训练，然后通过匹配不同模态的波段来应用或基准测试，但不同传感器架构对EOFMs内部表示的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 分析EOFMs表示空间对传感器架构的敏感性，研究不同传感器设计如何影响模型内部表示。

Result: EOFMs的表示空间对传感器架构高度敏感，这种敏感性揭示了当前EOFMs设计的缺陷。

Conclusion: 理解传感器架构对EOFMs表示空间的影响，为模型开发者、用户和遥感科学社区提供了重要指导，指明了如何开发更稳健的模型。

Abstract: Earth Observation Foundation Models (EOFMs) have exploded in prevalence as
tools for processing the massive volumes of remotely sensed and other earth
observation data, and for delivering impact on the many essential earth
monitoring tasks. An emerging trend posits using the outputs of pre-trained
models as 'embeddings' which summarize high dimensional data to be used for
generic tasks such as similarity search and content-specific queries. However,
most EOFM models are trained only on single modalities of data and then applied
or benchmarked by matching bands across different modalities. It is not clear
from existing work what impact diverse sensor architectures have on the
internal representations of the present suite of EOFMs. We show in this work
that the representation space of EOFMs is highly sensitive to sensor
architecture and that understanding this difference gives a vital perspective
on the pitfalls of current EOFM design and signals for how to move forward as
model developers, users, and a community guided by robust remote-sensing
science.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于修复引导的扰动解释技术，通过生成逼真的掩码局部编辑来揭示视觉模型在生态监测中的预测依据，避免传统扰动方法的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态监测中视觉模型的预测不透明限制了信任和现场应用，需要能够提供领域相关见解的解释方法。

Method: 使用修复引导的扰动技术，结合Segment-Anything-Model优化的掩码，进行对象移除/替换和背景替换，生成保持场景上下文的逼真编辑。

Result: 该方法能够定位诊断结构，避免传统扰动中的删除伪影，在港口海豹检测任务中通过翻转率和置信度下降等指标验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为生态学中AI的可信部署提供了领域相关的解释见解，支持专家验证和模型透明度。

Abstract: Ecological monitoring is increasingly automated by vision models, yet opaque
predictions limit trust and field adoption. We present an inpainting-guided,
perturbation-based explanation technique that produces photorealistic,
mask-localized edits that preserve scene context. Unlike masking or blurring,
these edits stay in-distribution and reveal which fine-grained morphological
cues drive predictions in tasks such as species recognition and trait
attribution. We demonstrate the approach on a YOLOv9 detector fine-tuned for
harbor seal detection in Glacier Bay drone imagery, using
Segment-Anything-Model-refined masks to support two interventions: (i) object
removal/replacement (e.g., replacing seals with plausible ice/water or boats)
and (ii) background replacement with original animals composited onto new
scenes. Explanations are assessed by re-scoring perturbed images (flip rate,
confidence drop) and by expert review for ecological plausibility and
interpretability. The resulting explanations localize diagnostic structures,
avoid deletion artifacts common to traditional perturbations, and yield
domain-relevant insights that support expert validation and more trustworthy
deployment of AI in ecology.

Abstract: Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) stands as a cornerstone in medical image
analysis, playing a pivotal role in precise diagnostics, treatment planning,
and monitoring of various medical conditions. This paper presents a
comprehensive and systematic survey of MIS methodologies, bridging the gap
between traditional image processing techniques and modern deep learning
approaches. The survey encompasses thresholding, edge detection, region-based
segmentation, clustering algorithms, and model-based techniques while also
delving into state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as Convolutional

semi-supervised learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and
Transformer-based models is thoroughly explored. In addition to covering
established methods, this survey highlights emerging trends, including hybrid
architectures, cross-modality learning, federated and distributed learning
frameworks, and active learning strategies, which aim to address challenges
such as limited labeled datasets, computational complexity, and model
generalizability across diverse imaging modalities. Furthermore, a specialized
case study on lumbar spine segmentation is presented, offering insights into
the challenges and advancements in this relatively underexplored anatomical

including dataset bias, domain adaptation, interpretability of deep learning
models, and integration into real-world clinical workflows.

TL;DR: DECOR是一个用于晶圆缺陷检测的深度聚类框架，通过处理复杂、未标记、不平衡且包含多种缺陷的晶圆数据，实现可靠的缺陷模式聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 半导体制造中，晶圆缺陷的早期检测对产品良率优化至关重要。但原始晶圆数据复杂、未标记、不平衡且单晶圆可能包含多种缺陷，需要设计在非理想数据条件下仍可靠的聚类方法。

Method: DECOR是一个具有方向鲁棒性的深度聚类框架，能够将晶圆图中的复杂缺陷模式分组到一致的簇中。该方法明确考虑了晶圆图中的方向变化，确保空间相似的缺陷无论其旋转或对齐方式如何都能被一致聚类。

Result: 在开源MixedWM38数据集上的实验表明，DECOR能够无需手动调参即可发现簇，并且在性能上优于现有的聚类基准方法。

Conclusion: DECOR为自动视觉检测系统提供了一个可靠且可扩展的解决方案，能够有效处理晶圆缺陷检测中的复杂数据挑战。

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, early detection of wafer defects is critical
for product yield optimization. However, raw wafer data from wafer quality
tests are often complex, unlabeled, imbalanced and can contain multiple defects
on a single wafer, making it crucial to design clustering methods that remain
reliable under such imperfect data conditions. We introduce DECOR, a deep
clustering with orientation robustness framework that groups complex defect
patterns from wafer maps into consistent clusters. We evaluate our method on
the open source MixedWM38 dataset, demonstrating its ability to discover
clusters without manual tuning. DECOR explicitly accounts for orientation
variations in wafer maps, ensuring that spatially similar defects are
consistently clustered regardless of its rotation or alignment. Experiments
indicate that our method outperforms existing clustering baseline methods, thus
providing a reliable and scalable solution in automated visual inspection
systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于LSTM和注意力机制的面部表情分类方法，特别关注类别不平衡问题，通过错误校正技术提高对小类别的分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多类别面部表情分类中的类别不平衡问题，其中某些情绪类别显著多于其他类别，影响分类性能。

Method: 使用基于LSTM的神经网络模型，结合注意力机制聚焦于面部关键区域，在训练时排除一个类别，然后对该类别进行错误校正。

Result: 实验表明所有类别都能进行校正，但效果差异明显；在测试集上，小类别的关键质量指标有所提升。

Conclusion: 该方法可有效应用于面部表情分析系统，在类别分布不平衡的情况下实现稳定分类，特别适用于寻找罕见事件的应用场景如反欺诈系统。

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of error correction in multi-class
classification of face images on unbalanced samples. The study is based on the
analysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional
states of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem
of class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others.
To solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with
an attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative
for emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is
trained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with
subsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training
stage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although
the degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are
worse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an
increase in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates
the promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the
search for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems. Thus, the proposed
method can be effectively applied in facial expression analysis systems and in
tasks requiring stable classification under skewed class distribution.

Abstract: Dynamic Chart Generation (DCG) involves producing code-rendered animated
visualizations as charts. While recent advances in multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs) have significantly improved their capability on static chart
generation and comprehension, MLLMs' potential for handling dynamic chart
generation and understanding remains underexplored. To bridge this research
gap, we introduce DCG-Bench (Dynamic Chart Generation Benchmark), the first
benchmark evaluating MLLM's capability on dynamic chart generation tasks from
three dimensions: Simple Text-to-Chart, Detailed Text-to-Chart, and
Video-to-Chart tasks. We construct DCG-8K, a high-quality DCG dataset with
annotations covering instruction-code-video triplets and QA pairs for both code
and video evaluation. Based on DCG-8K, we explored a two-stage training recipe,
proposing Joint-Code-Visual Reward for group relative policy optimization to
construct expert MLLM Qwen2.5-VL-DCG-3B for the DCG task. Our benchmarking
result reveals shortcomings of existing MLLMs in the visual-to-chart task, and
our model beats the best open-sourced MLLM with an average 8.31% performance
gain across three tasks, and shows on par performance against proprietary
models with only 3B parameters, proving the effectiveness of our training
recipe. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统视觉里程计方法依赖预训练深度学习组件和优化模块导致的复杂流程、对相机标定和超参数调优的依赖，以及在未见真实场景中表现不佳的问题。

Method: 提出VoT模型，通过时空注意力处理单目图像序列，提取特征并建模全局关系，直接预测相机运动而无需估计稠密几何，仅使用相机位姿进行监督。

Result: VoT在更大数据集上有效扩展，受益于更强的预训练骨干网络，在不同相机运动和标定设置下泛化良好，性能优于传统方法且运行速度快3倍以上。

Conclusion: 单目视觉里程计可以通过端到端方式有效解决，VoT框架证明了这种方法的可行性和优势。

Abstract: Modern monocular visual odometry methods typically combine pre-trained deep
learning components with optimization modules, resulting in complex pipelines
that rely heavily on camera calibration and hyperparameter tuning, and often
struggle in unseen real-world scenarios. Recent large-scale 3D models trained
on massive amounts of multi-modal data have partially alleviated these
challenges, providing generalizable dense reconstruction and camera pose
estimation. Still, they remain limited in handling long videos and providing
accurate per-frame estimates, which are required for visual odometry. In this
work, we demonstrate that monocular visual odometry can be addressed
effectively in an end-to-end manner, thereby eliminating the need for
handcrafted components such as bundle adjustment, feature matching, camera
calibration, or dense 3D reconstruction. We introduce VoT, short for Visual
odometry Transformer, which processes sequences of monocular frames by
extracting features and modeling global relationships through temporal and
spatial attention. Unlike prior methods, VoT directly predicts camera motion
without estimating dense geometry and relies solely on camera poses for
supervision. The framework is modular and flexible, allowing seamless
integration of various pre-trained encoders as feature extractors. Experimental
results demonstrate that VoT scales effectively with larger datasets, benefits
substantially from stronger pre-trained backbones, generalizes across diverse
camera motions and calibration settings, and outperforms traditional methods
while running more than 3 times faster. The code will be released.

Conclusion: 该方法能无缝集成到现有扩散基图像重建流程中，相比基于奖励梯度引导的基线方法表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse
problems. However, existing approaches typically overlook side information that
could significantly improve reconstruction quality, especially in severely
ill-posed settings. In this work, we propose a novel inference-time search
algorithm that guides the sampling process using the side information in a
manner that balances exploration and exploitation. This enables more accurate
and reliable reconstructions, providing an alternative to the gradient-based
guidance that is prone to reward-hacking artifacts. Our approach can be
seamlessly integrated into a wide range of existing diffusion-based image
reconstruction pipelines. Through extensive experiments on a number of inverse
problems, such as box inpainting, super-resolution, and various deblurring
tasks including motion, Gaussian, nonlinear, and blind deblurring, we show that
our approach consistently improves the qualitative and quantitative performance
of diffusion-based image reconstruction algorithms. We also show the superior
performance of our approach with respect to other baselines, including reward
gradient-based guidance algorithms. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出溯源网络，一种新型神经网络模型，通过将预测直接关联到训练样本实现端到端的可解释性，嵌入解释性到架构本身。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统深度网络的不透明性、幻觉问题，以及数据贡献者信用分配问题，提高模型的透明度、鲁棒性和可信度。

Method: 模型类似学习的KNN，每个输出由特征空间中相关性的具体样本证明，联合优化主任务和可解释性目标。

Result: 能够系统研究记忆与泛化的权衡，验证输入是否在训练集中，检测错误标签或异常数据点，增强对输入扰动的韧性。

Conclusion: 溯源网络为现有可解释性技术提供补充方法，虽然引入额外计算成本且目前适用于中等规模数据集，但显著提升了神经模型的透明度和可信度。

Abstract: We introduce provenance networks, a novel class of neural models designed to
provide end-to-end, training-data-driven explainability. Unlike conventional
post-hoc methods, provenance networks learn to link each prediction directly to
its supporting training examples as part of the model's normal operation,
embedding interpretability into the architecture itself. Conceptually, the
model operates similarly to a learned KNN, where each output is justified by
concrete exemplars weighted by relevance in the feature space. This approach
facilitates systematic investigations of the trade-off between memorization and
generalization, enables verification of whether a given input was included in
the training set, aids in the detection of mislabeled or anomalous data points,
enhances resilience to input perturbations, and supports the identification of
similar inputs contributing to the generation of a new data point. By jointly
optimizing the primary task and the explainability objective, provenance
networks offer insights into model behavior that traditional deep networks
cannot provide. While the model introduces additional computational cost and
currently scales to moderately sized datasets, it provides a complementary
approach to existing explainability techniques. In particular, it addresses
critical challenges in modern deep learning, including model opaqueness,
hallucination, and the assignment of credit to data contributors, thereby
improving transparency, robustness, and trustworthiness in neural models.

*Zhe Zhang,Mingxiu Cai,Gaochang Wu,Jing Zhang,Lingqiao Liu,Dacheng Tao,Tianyou Chai,Xiatian Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了统一成本过滤（UCF）框架，用于改进无监督异常检测方法，通过过滤匹配噪声来提升检测性能，适用于单模态和多模态场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督异常检测方法存在匹配噪声问题，且单模态和多模态方法研究相对孤立，缺乏统一框架。

Method: 构建异常成本体积，通过可学习的过滤模块和多层注意力引导来减轻匹配噪声，突出细微异常。

Result: 在22个不同基准测试中，UCF显著提升了多种UAD方法的性能，在单模态和多模态场景下均达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: UCF是一个通用的后处理细化框架，能有效提升无监督异常检测的性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) aims to identify image- and pixel-level
anomalies using only normal training data, with wide applications such as
industrial inspection and medical analysis, where anomalies are scarce due to
privacy concerns and cold-start constraints. Existing methods, whether
reconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based
(pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level
matching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely
overlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal
RGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D
and RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models.
Despite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a
comprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate
unified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching
perspective. Under this insight, we present Unified Cost Filtering (UCF), a
generic post-hoc refinement framework for refining anomaly cost volume of any
UAD model. The cost volume is constructed by matching a test sample against
normal samples from the same or different modalities, followed by a learnable
filtering module with multi-layer attention guidance from the test sample,
mitigating matching noise and highlighting subtle anomalies. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 diverse benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of UCF in
enhancing a variety of UAD methods, consistently achieving new state-of-the-art
results in both unimodal (RGB) and multimodal (RGB--3D, RGB--Text) UAD
scenarios. Code and models will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业图纸数字化过程中，物体检测的准确性至关重要，但缺乏自动评估检测结果质量的方法。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型的多模态能力识别缺失或不一致的检测结果，实现自动化质量评估。

Result: 该框架能够自动评估物体检测质量并指导结果优化，提升复杂工业图纸上的检测性能。

Conclusion: VLMs为工业图纸物体检测的质量评估提供了有效解决方案，有助于提高数字化过程的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Industrial diagrams such as piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are
essential for the design, operation, and maintenance of industrial plants.
Converting these diagrams into digital form is an important step toward
building digital twins and enabling intelligent industrial automation. A
central challenge in this digitalization process is accurate object detection.
Although recent advances have significantly improved object detection
algorithms, there remains a lack of methods to automatically evaluate the
quality of their outputs. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a
framework that employs Visual Language Models (VLMs) to assess object detection
results and guide their refinement. The approach exploits the multimodal
capabilities of VLMs to identify missing or inconsistent detections, thereby
enabling automated quality assessment and improving overall detection
performance on complex industrial diagrams.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced multimodal reasoning but still
face challenges in spatial reasoning for 3D scenes and complex object
configurations. To address this, we introduce SpatialViLT, an enhanced VLM that
integrates spatial features like depth maps, 3D coordinates, and edge maps
through a multi-task learning framework. This approach enriches multimodal
embeddings with spatial understanding. We propose two variants: SpatialViLT and
MaskedSpatialViLT, focusing on full and masked object regions, respectively.
Additionally, SpatialEnsemble combines both approaches, achieving
state-of-the-art accuracy. Our models excel in spatial reasoning categories
such as directional, topological, and proximity relations, as demonstrated on
the challenging Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset. This work represents a
significant step in enhancing the spatial intelligence of AI systems, crucial
for advanced multimodal understanding and real-world applications.

*Allison Davis,Yezhi Shen,Xiaoyu Ji,Fengqing Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用编码器-解码器网络（非对称去噪自编码器和U-Net）通过合成数据训练来减少两相光学切片结构照明显微镜中的残余伪影，无需清洁地面实况数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 两相光学切片结构照明显微镜中，减少采集时间会引入残余伪影，传统去噪方法难以抑制。深度学习需要清洁地面实况数据，但这类数据难以获得。

Method: 使用合成训练对（将真实伪影场应用于合成图像）训练编码器-解码器网络，包括非对称去噪自编码器和U-Net，然后在真实OS-SI图像上评估。

Result: 两种网络都提高了图像清晰度，各自在不同类型的伪影上表现优异。

Conclusion: 合成训练能够实现OS-SI图像的监督去噪，编码器-解码器网络有潜力简化重建工作流程。

Abstract: Structured illumination (SI) enhances image resolution and contrast by
projecting patterned light onto a sample. In two-phase optical-sectioning SI
(OS-SI), reduced acquisition time introduces residual artifacts that
conventional denoising struggles to suppress. Deep learning offers an
alternative to traditional methods; however, supervised training is limited by
the lack of clean, optically sectioned ground-truth data. We investigate
encoder-decoder networks for artifact reduction in two-phase OS-SI, using
synthetic training pairs formed by applying real artifact fields to synthetic
images. An asymmetrical denoising autoencoder (DAE) and a U-Net are trained on
the synthetic data, then evaluated on real OS-SI images. Both networks improve
image clarity, with each excelling against different artifact types. These
results demonstrate that synthetic training enables supervised denoising of
OS-SI images and highlight the potential of encoder-decoder networks to
streamline reconstruction workflows.

TL;DR: PEaRL是一个多模态框架，通过ssGSEA计算通路激活分数来表示转录组学，使用transformer编码生物学通路信号，并通过对比学习与组织学特征对齐，在三个癌症空间转录组数据集中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法主要依赖少量高变基因，限制了预测范围并忽视了协调的生物学程序对组织表型的影响。

Method: 使用通路激活分数表示转录组学，通过transformer编码通路信号，利用对比学习与组织学特征对齐。

Result: 在乳腺癌、皮肤癌和淋巴结癌三个空间转录组数据集中，PEaRL在基因和通路水平表达预测方面均优于现有方法，Pearson相关系数分别提高达58.9%和20.4%。

Conclusion: 基于通路的转录组表示能够产生更生物学真实和可解释的多模态模型，推动计算病理学超越基因水平嵌入。

Abstract: Integrating histopathology with spatial transcriptomics (ST) provides a
powerful opportunity to link tissue morphology with molecular function. Yet
most existing multimodal approaches rely on a small set of highly variable
genes, which limits predictive scope and overlooks the coordinated biological
programs that shape tissue phenotypes. We present PEaRL (Pathway Enhanced
Representation Learning), a multimodal framework that represents
transcriptomics through pathway activation scores computed with ssGSEA. By
encoding biologically coherent pathway signals with a transformer and aligning
them with histology features via contrastive learning, PEaRL reduces
dimensionality, improves interpretability, and strengthens cross-modal
correspondence. Across three cancer ST datasets (breast, skin, and lymph node),
PEaRL consistently outperforms SOTA methods, yielding higher accuracy for both
gene- and pathway-level expression prediction (up to 58.9 percent and 20.4
percent increase in Pearson correlation coefficient compared to SOTA). These
results demonstrate that grounding transcriptomic representation in pathways
produces more biologically faithful and interpretable multimodal models,
advancing computational pathology beyond gene-level embeddings.

Motivation: 解决医学影像分析中任务特定模型缺乏通用性、现有通用方法语义理解能力差的问题，开发一个既通用又具有细粒度控制能力的框架。

Method: 采用分层语义提示的视觉-语言框架，包含独特的双提示机制和文本控制架构，支持参数高效微调以适应新任务和模态。

Result: 在10个医学数据集中的8个上超越现有最优方法，涵盖3种成像模态和30多个器官及肿瘤类型；在头颈癌数据集上预后预测的CI达到0.69。

Conclusion: DuPLUS是一个通用且临床相关的医学图像分析解决方案，具有出色的泛化能力和扩展性，能够快速适应新任务和不同医疗中心的数据。

Abstract: Deep learning for medical imaging is hampered by task-specific models that
lack generalizability and prognostic capabilities, while existing 'universal'
approaches suffer from simplistic conditioning and poor medical semantic
understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce DuPLUS, a deep
learning framework for efficient multi-modal medical image analysis. DuPLUS
introduces a novel vision-language framework that leverages hierarchical
semantic prompts for fine-grained control over the analysis task, a capability
absent in prior universal models. To enable extensibility to other medical
tasks, it includes a hierarchical, text-controlled architecture driven by a
unique dual-prompt mechanism. For segmentation, DuPLUS is able to generalize
across three imaging modalities, ten different anatomically various medical
datasets, encompassing more than 30 organs and tumor types. It outperforms the
state-of-the-art task specific and universal models on 8 out of 10 datasets. We
demonstrate extensibility of its text-controlled architecture by seamless
integration of electronic health record (EHR) data for prognosis prediction,
and on a head and neck cancer dataset, DuPLUS achieved a Concordance Index (CI)
of 0.69. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables rapid adaptation to new tasks
and modalities from varying centers, establishing DuPLUS as a versatile and
clinically relevant solution for medical image analysis. The code for this work

Motivation: 野生动物保护需要非侵入式实时监测，但在自然环境中进行动物检测和分割面临计算资源有限和物种隐蔽外观的挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：YOLOv10负责目标检测，MobileSAM负责轻量级分割，通过线程化并行执行来减少延迟。

Result: 在Houbara Bustard数据集上，mAP50达0.9627，mAP75达0.7731，mAP95达0.7178，MobileSAM mIoU达0.7421，YOLOv10每帧处理时间43.7ms。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了实时动物检测和分割，为野生动物保护提供了有效的技术方案，并发布了包含40,000张标注图像的Houbara数据集。

Abstract: Real-time animal detection and segmentation in natural environments are vital
for wildlife conservation, enabling non-invasive monitoring through remote
camera streams. However, these tasks remain challenging due to limited
computational resources and the cryptic appearance of many species. We propose
a mobile-optimized two-stage deep learning framework that integrates a
Threading Detection Model (TDM) to parallelize YOLOv10-based detection and
MobileSAM-based segmentation. Unlike prior YOLO+SAM pipelines, our approach
improves real-time performance by reducing latency through threading. YOLOv10
handles detection while MobileSAM performs lightweight segmentation, both
executed concurrently for efficient resource use. On the cryptic Houbara
Bustard, a conservation-priority species, our model achieves mAP50 of 0.9627,
mAP75 of 0.7731, mAP95 of 0.7178, and a MobileSAM mIoU of 0.7421. YOLOv10
operates at 43.7 ms per frame, confirming real-time readiness. We introduce a
curated Houbara dataset of 40,000 annotated images to support model training
and evaluation across diverse conditions. The code and dataset used in this
study are publicly available on GitHub at

Motivation: 现有Transformer缺乏对科学和计算机视觉中常见几何对称性的归纳偏置，而现有的等变方法往往通过复杂计算设计牺牲了Transformer的效率和灵活性。

Method: 通过从柏拉图立体对称群定义参考框架来构建注意力机制，诱导出原则性的权重共享方案，同时保持标准Transformer的架构和计算成本不变。

Result: 在计算机视觉（CIFAR-10）、3D点云（ScanObjectNN）和分子属性预测（QM9、OMol25）等多个基准测试中，Platonic Transformer通过利用几何约束实现了有竞争力的性能，且无需额外成本。

Conclusion: Platonic Transformer成功解决了Transformer缺乏几何对称性归纳偏置的问题，在保持效率和灵活性的同时实现了几何等变性，为Transformer在几何敏感任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While widespread, Transformers lack inductive biases for geometric symmetries
common in science and computer vision. Existing equivariant methods often
sacrifice the efficiency and flexibility that make Transformers so effective
through complex, computationally intensive designs. We introduce the Platonic
Transformer to resolve this trade-off. By defining attention relative to
reference frames from the Platonic solid symmetry groups, our method induces a
principled weight-sharing scheme. This enables combined equivariance to
continuous translations and Platonic symmetries, while preserving the exact
architecture and computational cost of a standard Transformer. Furthermore, we
show that this attention is formally equivalent to a dynamic group convolution,
which reveals that the model learns adaptive geometric filters and enables a
highly scalable, linear-time convolutional variant. Across diverse benchmarks
in computer vision (CIFAR-10), 3D point clouds (ScanObjectNN), and molecular
property prediction (QM9, OMol25), the Platonic Transformer achieves
competitive performance by leveraging these geometric constraints at no
additional cost.

Abstract: The generalization of deep neural networks to unknown domains is a major
challenge despite their tremendous progress in recent years. For this reason,
the dynamic area of domain generalization (DG) has emerged. In contrast to
unsupervised domain adaptation, there is no access to or knowledge about the
target domains, and DG methods aim to generalize across multiple different
unseen target domains. Domain generalization is particularly relevant for the
task semantic segmentation which is used in several areas such as biomedicine
or automated driving. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the
rapidly evolving topic of domain generalized semantic segmentation. We cluster
and review existing approaches and identify the paradigm shift towards
foundation-model-based domain generalization. Finally, we provide an extensive
performance comparison of all approaches, which highlights the significant
influence of foundation models on domain generalization. This survey seeks to
advance domain generalization research and inspire scientists to explore new

Abstract: Endoscopic procedures such as esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and
colonoscopy play a critical role in diagnosing and managing gastrointestinal
(GI) disorders. However, the documentation burden associated with these
procedures place significant strain on gastroenterologists, contributing to
inefficiencies in clinical workflows and physician burnout. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel automated report generation model that leverages
a transformer-based vision encoder and text decoder within a two-stage training
framework. In the first stage, both components are pre-trained on image/text
caption pairs to capture generalized vision-language features, followed by
fine-tuning on images/report pairs to generate clinically meaningful findings.
Our approach not only streamlines the documentation process but also holds
promise for reducing physician workload and improving patient care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何让无人机通过人类直观的手绘草图来理解导航意图，并生成安全准确的3D飞行路径，特别是在未知真实环境中。

Method: 包含SketchAdapter（将手绘草图映射到2D投影路径）和DiffPath（从2D投影和深度图像推断3D轨迹的扩散模型），使用混合标注数据训练。

Result: 在真实世界无人机测试中，低/中等障碍物环境下达到100%成功率，高障碍物环境下40%成功率，比关键消融实验高出20-60%的任务完成率。

Conclusion: 通过模块化设计和混合标注数据训练，SketchPlan能够有效理解人类意图并生成3D路径，展示了零样本仿真到现实迁移的可行性。

Abstract: We propose SketchPlan, a diffusion-based planner that interprets 2D
hand-drawn sketches over depth images to generate 3D flight paths for drone
navigation. SketchPlan comprises two components: a SketchAdapter that learns to
map the human sketches to projected 2D paths, and DiffPath, a diffusion model
that infers 3D trajectories from 2D projections and a first person view depth
image. Our model achieves zero-shot sim-to-real transfer, generating accurate
and safe flight paths in previously unseen real-world environments. To train
the model, we build a synthetic dataset of 32k flight paths using a diverse set
of photorealistic 3D Gaussian Splatting scenes. We automatically label the data
by computing 2D projections of the 3D flight paths onto the camera plane, and
use this to train the DiffPath diffusion model. However, since real human 2D
sketches differ significantly from ideal 2D projections, we additionally label
872 of the 3D flight paths with real human sketches and use this to train the
SketchAdapter to infer the 2D projection from the human sketch. We demonstrate
SketchPlan's effectiveness in both simulated and real-world experiments, and
show through ablations that training on a mix of human labeled and auto-labeled
data together with a modular design significantly boosts its capabilities to
correctly interpret human intent and infer 3D paths. In real-world drone tests,
SketchPlan achieved 100\% success in low/medium clutter and 40\% in unseen
high-clutter environments, outperforming key ablations by 20-60\% in task
completion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种防御AI视频会议系统中身份劫持攻击的方法，通过从姿态-表情潜在空间中提取生物特征信息来检测非法身份交换，无需分析重建的RGB视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI视频会议系统通过传输紧凑的姿态-表情潜在空间来减少带宽，但这种潜在空间可能被恶意操控，让攻击者实时劫持受害者的形象。由于每帧都是合成的，传统的深度伪造检测器完全失效。

Method: 使用姿态条件化的大间隔对比编码器，从传输的潜在空间中分离出持久的身份线索，同时消除瞬时的姿态和表情信息。通过简单的余弦测试在视频渲染时检测非法身份交换。

Result: 在多个说话头部生成模型上的实验表明，该方法始终优于现有的操控防御方法，能够实时运行，并在分布外场景中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了无需查看重建RGB视频的生物特征泄露防御，有效解决了AI视频会议系统中的身份劫持安全问题。

Abstract: AI-based talking-head videoconferencing systems reduce bandwidth by sending a
compact pose-expression latent and re-synthesizing RGB at the receiver, but
this latent can be puppeteered, letting an attacker hijack a victim's likeness
in real time. Because every frame is synthetic, deepfake and synthetic video
detectors fail outright. To address this security problem, we exploit a key
observation: the pose-expression latent inherently contains biometric
information of the driving identity. Therefore, we introduce the first
biometric leakage defense without ever looking at the reconstructed RGB video:
a pose-conditioned, large-margin contrastive encoder that isolates persistent
identity cues inside the transmitted latent while cancelling transient pose and
expression. A simple cosine test on this disentangled embedding flags illicit
identity swaps as the video is rendered. Our experiments on multiple
talking-head generation models show that our method consistently outperforms
existing puppeteering defenses, operates in real-time, and shows strong
generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios.

Motivation: 现有自回归视频扩散模型难以实现流式、细粒度的输出控制，无法保证与用户期望一致。需要一种能够随时对视频内容进行精细交互式拖拽编辑的方法。

Method: 提出训练无关的DragStream方法：1）自适应分布自校正策略，利用相邻帧统计约束潜在嵌入漂移；2）空间频率选择性优化机制，选择性传播视觉线索以减少上下文干扰。

Result: DragStream可无缝集成到现有自回归视频扩散模型中，大量实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: REVEL任务和DragStream方法成功解决了流式拖拽视频编辑中的潜在空间漂移和上下文干扰问题，实现了对生成视频的精细交互控制。

Abstract: Achieving streaming, fine-grained control over the outputs of autoregressive
video diffusion models remains challenging, making it difficult to ensure that
they consistently align with user expectations. To bridge this gap, we propose
\textbf{stReaming drag-oriEnted interactiVe vidEo manipuLation (REVEL)}, a new
task that enables users to modify generated videos \emph{anytime} on
\emph{anything} via fine-grained, interactive drag. Beyond DragVideo and
SG-I2V, REVEL unifies drag-style video manipulation as editing and animating
video frames with both supporting user-specified translation, deformation, and
rotation effects, making drag operations versatile. In resolving REVEL, we
observe: \emph{i}) drag-induced perturbations accumulate in latent space,
causing severe latent distribution drift that halts the drag process;
\emph{ii}) streaming drag is easily disturbed by context frames, thereby
yielding visually unnatural outcomes. We thus propose a training-free approach,
\textbf{DragStream}, comprising: \emph{i}) an adaptive distribution
self-rectification strategy that leverages neighboring frames' statistics to
effectively constrain the drift of latent embeddings; \emph{ii}) a
spatial-frequency selective optimization mechanism, allowing the model to fully
exploit contextual information while mitigating its interference via
selectively propagating visual cues along generation. Our method can be
seamlessly integrated into existing autoregressive video diffusion models, and
extensive experiments firmly demonstrate the effectiveness of our DragStream.

TL;DR: GAS-MIL是一种集成框架，可无缝整合多个基础模型的特征，无需手动特征选择或大量任务特定微调，在多个癌症数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在计算病理学中提供了强大的通用特征提取器，但针对特定诊断任务进行适应和基准测试通常耗时且资源密集，特别是考虑到其规模和多样性。

Method: 提出Group-Aggregative Selection Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL)集成框架，整合多个基础模型的特征，保留其互补优势。

Result: 在前列腺癌(PANDA)、卵巢癌(UBC-OCEAN)和乳腺癌(TCGA-BrCa)三个数据集的分类任务中，GAS-MIL始终达到优于或与单个基础模型和现有MIL方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: GAS-MIL通过实现异构基础模型的高效集成，简化了病理学模型部署，并为未来多模态和精准肿瘤学应用提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have transformed computational pathology by providing
powerful, general-purpose feature extractors. However, adapting and
benchmarking individual FMs for specific diagnostic tasks is often
time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially given their scale and
diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce Group-Aggregative Selection
Multi-Instance Learning (GAS-MIL), a flexible ensemble framework that
seamlessly integrates features from multiple FMs, preserving their
complementary strengths without requiring manual feature selection or extensive
task-specific fine-tuning. Across classification tasks in three cancer
datasets-prostate (PANDA), ovarian (UBC-OCEAN), and breast (TCGA-BrCa)-GAS-MIL
consistently achieves superior or on-par performance relative to individual FMs
and established MIL methods, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.
By enabling efficient integration of heterogeneous FMs, GAS-MIL streamlines
model deployment for pathology and provides a scalable foundation for future
multimodal and precision oncology applications.

Motivation: 解决无人机辅助纳洛酮递送中旁观者情境意识实时评估的研究空白，提升人类-自主系统协作效率。

Method: 创建DANDSD数据集，提出基于图嵌入和Transformer模型的视频实时SA评估框架，整合几何、运动学和交互图特征。

Result: 实现高性能SA预测，在时间分割准确率上优于FINCH基线9%的MoF和5%的IoU。

Conclusion: 该框架支持开发能够有效指导旁观者的自适应无人机系统，改善应急响应结果并拯救生命。

Abstract: Rapid naloxone delivery via drones offers a promising solution for responding
to opioid overdose emergencies (OOEs), by extending lifesaving interventions to
medically untrained bystanders before emergency medical services (EMS) arrive.
Recognizing the critical role of bystander situational awareness (SA) in
human-autonomy teaming (HAT), we address a key research gap in real-time SA
assessment by introducing the Drone-Assisted Naloxone Delivery Simulation
Dataset (DANDSD). This pioneering dataset captures HAT during simulated OOEs,
where college students without medical training act as bystanders tasked with
administering intranasal naloxone to a mock overdose victim. Leveraging this
dataset, we propose a video-based real-time SA assessment framework that
utilizes graph embeddings and transformer models to assess bystander SA in real
time. Our approach integrates visual perception and comprehension cues--such as
geometric, kinematic, and interaction graph features--and achieves
high-performance SA prediction. It also demonstrates strong temporal
segmentation accuracy, outperforming the FINCH baseline by 9% in Mean over
Frames (MoF) and 5% in Intersection over Union (IoU). This work supports the
development of adaptive drone systems capable of guiding bystanders
effectively, ultimately improving emergency response outcomes and saving lives.

*Mayimunah Nagayi,Alice Khan,Tamryn Frank,Rina Swart,Clement Nyirenda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估四种开源OCR系统（Tesseract、EasyOCR、PaddleOCR、TrOCR）在食品包装图像上的性能，重点关注成分表和营养信息提取。Tesseract在准确率上表现最佳，EasyOCR在准确率和多语言支持间取得平衡，PaddleOCR覆盖率高但速度慢，TrOCR表现最差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品包装上的准确OCR对于合规性和营养监测很重要，但由于多语言文本、密集布局、字体多样、反光和曲面等挑战而困难。

Method: 使用231种产品（1,628张图像）的数据集，评估四种OCR模型的速度和覆盖率，并对113张图像（60种产品）的子集进行准确率评估，使用CER、WER、BLEU、ROUGE-L、F1、覆盖率和执行时间等指标。

Result: 在真实子集上，Tesseract获得最低CER（0.912）和最高BLEU（0.245）。EasyOCR在准确率和多语言支持间平衡良好。PaddleOCR几乎完全覆盖但速度较慢（仅CPU运行）。TrOCR尽管有GPU加速但结果最弱。

Conclusion: 研究提供了包装特定的基准，建立了基线，并指出了布局感知方法和文本定位的发展方向。

Abstract: This study evaluates four open-source Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
systems which are Tesseract, EasyOCR, PaddleOCR, and TrOCR on real world food
packaging images. The aim is to assess their ability to extract ingredient
lists and nutrition facts panels. Accurate OCR for packaging is important for
compliance and nutrition monitoring but is challenging due to multilingual
text, dense layouts, varied fonts, glare, and curved surfaces. A dataset of 231
products (1,628 images) was processed by all four models to assess speed and
coverage, and a ground truth subset of 113 images (60 products) was created for
accuracy evaluation. Metrics include Character Error Rate (CER), Word Error
Rate (WER), BLEU, ROUGE-L, F1, coverage, and execution time. On the ground
truth subset, Tesseract achieved the lowest CER (0.912) and the highest BLEU
(0.245). EasyOCR provided a good balance between accuracy and multilingual
support. PaddleOCR achieved near complete coverage but was slower because it
ran on CPU only due to GPU incompatibility, and TrOCR produced the weakest
results despite GPU acceleration. These results provide a packaging-specific
benchmark, establish a baseline, and highlight directions for layout-aware
methods and text localization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FrameOracle是一个轻量级即插即用模块，通过预测最相关帧和所需帧数来优化视频理解，在保持准确性的同时显著减少输入帧数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频语言模型受限于处理帧数，传统均匀采样策略无法适应信息密度和任务复杂度的变化，导致效率低下和信息丢失。

Method: 使用四阶段课程学习训练，前三阶段依赖跨模态相似度等弱代理信号，最后阶段利用新构建的FrameOracle-41K数据集提供的关键帧标注进行强监督。

Result: 在5个VLM和6个基准测试中，FrameOracle将16帧输入平均减少到10.4帧且精度不降，从64帧候选减少到13.9帧时精度提升1.4%。

Conclusion: FrameOracle实现了视频理解中效率与准确性的最优权衡，为可扩展视频理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced video understanding, but their
performance is limited by the number of input frames they can process. Existing
frame sampling strategies, such as uniform or fixed-budget selection, often
fail to adapt to variations in information density or task complexity,
resulting in inefficiency and information loss. To address this, we present
FrameOracle, a lightweight and plug-and-play module that predicts both (1)
which frames are most relevant to a given query and (2) how many frames are
needed. FrameOracle is trained using a four-stage curriculum, with the first
three stages relying on weak proxy signals such as cross-modal similarity. In
the final stage, it leverages stronger supervision from a new dataset we
introduce, FrameOracle-41K, the first large-scale VideoQA collection to provide
keyframe annotations specifying the minimal set of frames required to answer
each question. Extensive experiments across five VLMs and six benchmarks
demonstrate that FrameOracle reduces 16-frame inputs to an average of 10.4
frames without any loss in accuracy. When starting from 64-frame candidates, it
reduces the input to an average of 13.9 frames while improving accuracy by
1.4%, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs for scalable
video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出混合协同微调(CFT)方法，结合标记和未标记数据来检测游戏视觉bug，减少对目标游戏标记数据的依赖


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏视觉bug的人工识别成本高且需要专业知识，监督模型依赖大量标记数据，但这类bug出现频率低导致数据稀缺

Method: 混合协同微调方法，利用目标游戏和同领域游戏的标记样本，结合未标记数据增强特征表示学习

Result: 在多个游戏环境中优于传统基线方法，即使仅使用50%目标游戏标记数据仍保持竞争力

Conclusion: CFT方法提高了游戏视觉bug检测的可扩展性和适应性，有效利用所有可用数据减少对特定目标游戏标记数据的依赖

Abstract: Manual identification of visual bugs in video games is a resource-intensive
and costly process, often demanding specialized domain knowledge. While
supervised visual bug detection models offer a promising solution, their
reliance on extensive labeled datasets presents a significant challenge due to
the infrequent occurrence of such bugs. To overcome this limitation, we propose
a hybrid Co-FineTuning (CFT) method that effectively integrates both labeled
and unlabeled data. Our approach leverages labeled samples from the target game
and diverse co-domain games, additionally incorporating unlabeled data to
enhance feature representation learning. This strategy maximizes the utility of
all available data, substantially reducing the dependency on labeled examples
from the specific target game. The developed framework demonstrates enhanced
scalability and adaptability, facilitating efficient visual bug detection
across various game titles. Our experimental results show the robustness of the
proposed method for game visual bug detection, exhibiting superior performance
compared to conventional baselines across multiple gaming environments.
Furthermore, CFT maintains competitive performance even when trained with only
50% of the labeled data from the target game.

### [145] [Exploring the Hierarchical Reasoning Model for Small Natural-Image Classification Without Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03598)
*Alexander V. Mantzaris*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HRM模型在MNIST上表现良好（98%准确率），但在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上过拟合严重，性能不如简单的CNN基准模型，表明当前HRM在无数据增强的小分辨率图像分类中缺乏竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估HRM模型是否可以作为实用的图像分类器，特别是在无数据增强的原始训练条件下。

Method: 使用HRM模型（包含两个Transformer模块、DEQ风格单步训练、深度监督、RoPE位置编码和RMSNorm），在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上测试，采用无数据增强、相同优化器家族、一周期预热和余弦衰减的训练策略。

Result: MNIST：98%测试准确率；CIFAR-10：65.0%测试准确率（CNN基准77.2%）；CIFAR-100：29.7%测试准确率（CNN基准45.3%）。HRM训练速度比CNN慢约30倍。

Conclusion: 在无数据增强的小分辨率图像分类任务中，当前HRM模型缺乏足够的图像特定归纳偏置，不如简单卷积架构有竞争力，但模型改进可能带来性能提升。

Abstract: This paper asks whether the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM) with the two
Transformer-style modules $(f_L,f_H)$, one step (DEQ-style) training, deep
supervision, Rotary Position Embeddings, and RMSNorm can serve as a practical
image classifier. It is evaluated on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 under a
deliberately raw regime: no data augmentation, identical optimizer family with
one-epoch warmup then cosine-floor decay, and label smoothing. HRM optimizes
stably and performs well on MNIST ($\approx 98\%$ test accuracy), but on small
natural images it overfits and generalizes poorly: on CIFAR-10, HRM reaches
65.0\% after 25 epochs, whereas a two-stage Conv--BN--ReLU baseline attains
77.2\% while training $\sim 30\times$ faster per epoch; on CIFAR-100, HRM
achieves only 29.7\% test accuracy despite 91.5\% train accuracy, while the
same CNN reaches 45.3\% test with 50.5\% train accuracy. Loss traces and error
analyses indicate healthy optimization but insufficient image-specific
inductive bias for HRM in this regime. It is concluded that, for
small-resolution image classification without augmentation, HRM is not
competitive with even simple convolutional architectures as the HRM currently
exist but this does not exclude possibilities that modifications to the model
may allow it to improve greatly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习（SSL）的最新进展使得学习通用视觉特征成为可能，DINOv2在大多数基准测试中超越了弱监督方法（WSL），需要系统分析其核心思想和性能表现。

Method: 采用多裁剪视图增强和均值教师自蒸馏方法，通过比较DINO和DINOv2与其他SSL和WSL方法在各种下游任务中的性能来评估效果。

Result: DINOv2在大多数基准测试中超越了弱监督方法，其基于transformer的特征表现出显著的新兴特性。

Conclusion: DINOv2虽然取得了显著进展，但仍存在局限性，需要进一步研究其影响和未来发展方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have made it possible to
learn general-purpose visual features that capture both the high-level
semantics and the fine-grained spatial structure of images. Most notably, the
recent DINOv2 has established a new state of the art by surpassing weakly
supervised methods (WSL) like OpenCLIP on most benchmarks. In this survey, we
examine the core ideas behind its approach, multi-crop view augmentation and
self-distillation with a mean teacher, and trace their development in previous
work. We then compare the performance of DINO and DINOv2 with other SSL and WSL
methods across various downstream tasks, and highlight some remarkable emergent
properties of their learned features with transformer backbones. We conclude by
briefly discussing DINOv2's limitations, its impact, and future research
directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决FSCIL中由于数据稀缺导致的泛化能力不足问题，以及直接使用扩散模型进行数据增强时出现的语义不对齐和无效指导问题。

Method: 提出扩散-分类器协同框架，采用奖励对齐学习策略，通过多层面奖励函数指导扩散模型生成：特征层面确保语义一致性和多样性，logits层面促进探索性图像生成和类间区分度。

Result: 在FSCIL基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了知识保留和新类学习能力。

Conclusion: DCS框架通过扩散模型和分类器的协同进化，有效解决了FSCIL中的数据稀缺和语义对齐挑战，为小样本类增量学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially
learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a
task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current
FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on
limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation,
their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective
guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel
framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and
FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a
dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state
directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the
feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored
maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits
level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class
discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session
confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated
images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better
reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL
benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class
learning.

Abstract: Industrial accidents, particularly in high-risk domains such as surface and
underground mining, are frequently caused by unsafe worker behaviors.
Traditional manual inspection remains labor-intensive, error-prone, and
insufficient for large-scale, dynamic environments, highlighting the urgent
need for intelligent and automated safety monitoring. In this paper, we present
MonitorVLM, a novel vision--language framework designed to detect safety
violations directly from surveillance video streams. MonitorVLM introduces
three key innovations: (1) a domain-specific violation dataset comprising 9,000
vision--question--answer (VQA) samples across 40 high-frequency mining
regulations, enriched with augmentation and auxiliary detection cues; (2) a
clause filter (CF) module that dynamically selects the Top-$K$ most relevant
clauses, reducing inference latency by 13.56\% while maintaining accuracy; and
(3) a behavior magnifier (BM) module that enhances worker regions to improve
fine-grained action recognition, yielding additional gains of 3.45% in
precision and 8.62% in recall. Experimental results demonstrate that MonitorVLM
significantly outperforms baseline vision--language models, achieving
improvements of 22.01% in precision, 34.22\% in recall, and 28.37% in F1 score
over the 72B unfine-tuned baseline. A lightweight web-based interface further
integrates MonitorVLM into practical workflows, enabling automatic violation
reporting with video timestamping. This study highlights the potential of
multimodal large models to enhance occupational safety monitoring in mining and
beyond.

Abstract: The integration of Diffusion Models into Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) is a substantial improvement in the detection of accidents. We present a
novel hybrid model integrating guidance classification with diffusion
techniques. By leveraging fine-tuned ExceptionNet architecture outputs as input
for our proposed diffusion model and processing image tensors as our
conditioning, our approach creates a robust classification framework. Our model
consists of multiple conditional modules, which aim to modulate the linear
projection of inputs using time embeddings and image covariate embeddings,
allowing the network to adapt its behavior dynamically throughout the diffusion
process. To address the computationally intensive nature of diffusion models,
our implementation is cloud-based, enabling scalable and efficient processing.
Our strategy overcomes the shortcomings of conventional classification
approaches by leveraging diffusion models inherent capacity to effectively
understand complicated data distributions. We investigate important diffusion
characteristics, such as timestep schedulers, timestep encoding techniques,
timestep count, and architectural design changes, using a thorough ablation
study, and have conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed model
against the baseline models on a publicly available dataset. The proposed
diffusion model performs best in image-based accident detection with an
accuracy of 97.32%.

Conclusion: SAMSOD模型通过解决模态不平衡和梯度冲突问题，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: RGB-T salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment attractive objects by
combining RGB and thermal infrared images. To enhance performance, the Segment
Anything Model has been fine-tuned for this task. However, the imbalance
convergence of two modalities and significant gradient difference between high-
and low- activations are ignored, thereby leaving room for further performance
enhancement. In this paper, we propose a model called \textit{SAMSOD}, which
utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance the learning of non-dominant modality
and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting
gradients on model convergence. The method also leverages two decoupled
adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing
foreground objects by enhancing background learning. Fundamental experiments on
RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets and generalizability experiments on scribble
supervised RGB-T SOD, fully supervised RGB-D SOD datasets and full-supervised
RGB-D rail surface defect detection all demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method.

dataset, which consists of 100,000 pairs of referring expressions and
corresponding bounding boxes for small objects in driving scenarios. Second, we
propose the progressive-iterative zooming adapter (PIZA), an adapter module for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning that enables models to progressively zoom in
and localize small objects. In a series of experiments, we apply PIZA to
GroundingDINO and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy on the
SOREC dataset. Our dataset, codes and pre-trained models are publicly available

Abstract: Segmenting of clinically important retinal blood vessels into arteries and
veins is a prerequisite for retinal vessel analysis. Such analysis can provide
potential insights and bio-markers for identifying and diagnosing various
retinal eye diseases. Alteration in the regularity and width of the retinal
blood vessels can act as an indicator of the health of the vasculature system
all over the body. It can help identify patients at high risk of developing
vasculature diseases like stroke and myocardial infarction. Over the years,
various Deep Learning architectures have been proposed to perform retinal
vessel segmentation. Recently, attention mechanisms have been increasingly used
in image segmentation tasks. The work proposes a new Deep Learning approach for
artery-vein segmentation. The new approach is based on the Attention mechanism
that is incorporated into the WNet Deep Learning model, and we call the model
as Attention-WNet. The proposed approach has been tested on publicly available
datasets such as HRF and DRIVE datasets. The proposed approach has outperformed
other state-of-art models available in the literature.

TL;DR: 本文创建了LAION-400M数据集中的人物中心注释，揭示了训练数据中的人口统计不平衡和有害关联，并证明CLIP和Stable Diffusion中60-70%的性别偏见可由数据中的直接共现线性解释。

Motivation: 解决大规模多模态数据集缺乏人口统计注释的问题，以理解训练数据在产生模型偏见中的作用。

Method: 通过结合目标检测、多模态字幕生成和微调分类器的验证自动标注流程，为LAION-400M数据集创建人物中心注释，包括边界框、感知性别和种族/民族标签。

Result: 发现数据集中存在人口统计不平衡和有害关联，如男性和被感知为黑人或中东裔的个体与犯罪相关和负面内容的不成比例关联。

Conclusion: 建立了首个大规模实证联系，证明数据集组成与下游模型偏见之间的直接关系，60-70%的模型偏见可由训练数据中的共现模式解释。

Abstract: Vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets show strong
demographic biases, but the role of training data in producing these biases
remains unclear. A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations
in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating
person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million
bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically
generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic
labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and
finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and
harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and
individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and
negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable
Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our
resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset
composition and downstream model bias.

TL;DR: 比较两种预训练神经网络在里约热内卢贫民窟检测中的表现：通用网络（大数据量）vs专用卫星图像网络（任务特定性），探究任务特异性与数据量哪个对性能影响更大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法尚未充分利用预训练神经网络的潜力，特别是在非正式聚落检测领域

Method: 使用两种预训练神经网络：1）在大型多样化数据集上预训练的通用网络，2）在卫星图像上预训练的专业网络，在里约热内卢贫民窟检测任务中进行比较

Result: 未明确说明具体结果，但通过比较两种网络的性能来评估任务特异性和数据量的相对重要性

Conclusion: 研究旨在确定在非正式聚落检测中，任务特异性还是数据量对模型性能有更大影响

Abstract: While deep learning methods for detecting informal settlements have already
been developed, they have not yet fully utilized the potential offered by
recent pretrained neural networks. We compare two types of pretrained neural
networks for detecting the favelas of Rio de Janeiro: 1. Generic networks
pretrained on large diverse datasets of unspecific images, 2. A specialized
network pretrained on satellite imagery. While the latter is more specific to
the target task, the former has been pretrained on significantly more images.
Hence, this research investigates whether task specificity or data volume
yields superior performance in urban informal settlement detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出LoRA补丁方法，通过向Deepfake生成器注入可插拔的LoRA补丁来绕过现有防御系统，同时提出防御性LoRA补丁作为补充解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Deepfake技术带来严重社会风险，现有防御措施缺乏鲁棒性和可靠性，需要开发更有效的对抗方法。

Method: 采用低秩适应(LoRA)补丁技术，结合可学习门控机制防止梯度爆炸，并引入多模态特征对齐损失函数实现语义级特征对齐。

Result: 仅需1000个面部样本和单轮微调，LoRA补丁就能成功绕过多种主动防御系统。

Conclusion: 揭示了当前Deepfake防御范式的关键弱点，强调需要更鲁棒的防御策略。

Abstract: Deepfakes pose significant societal risks, motivating the development of
proactive defenses that embed adversarial perturbations in facial images to
prevent manipulation. However, in this paper, we show that these preemptive
defenses often lack robustness and reliability. We propose a novel approach,
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) patching, which injects a plug-and-play LoRA patch
into Deepfake generators to bypass state-of-the-art defenses. A learnable
gating mechanism adaptively controls the effect of the LoRA patch and prevents
gradient explosions during fine-tuning. We also introduce a Multi-Modal Feature
Alignment (MMFA) loss, encouraging the features of adversarial outputs to align
with those of the desired outputs at the semantic level. Beyond bypassing, we
present defensive LoRA patching, embedding visible warnings in the outputs as a
complementary solution to mitigate this newly identified security
vulnerability. With only 1,000 facial examples and a single epoch of
fine-tuning, LoRA patching successfully defeats multiple proactive defenses.
These results reveal a critical weakness in current paradigms and underscore
the need for more robust Deepfake defense strategies. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VPR方法在训练-测试域差异较大的挑战性基准上表现不佳，而测试时参考集包含目标域的图像和姿态信息，可作为弥补域差距的补充信息源。

Method: 提出参考集微调，在测试前对VPR模型在参考集上进行简单微调，利用目标域信息提升模型性能。

Result: 在挑战性数据集上平均提升Recall@1约2.3%，且微调后的模型保持泛化能力，在不同测试数据集上均有效。

Conclusion: 参考集微调是提升VPR性能的有效策略，能够利用测试时参考集的域特定信息弥补训练-测试域差距。

Abstract: Given a query image, Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is the task of retrieving
an image of the same place from a reference database with robustness to
viewpoint and appearance changes. Recent works show that some VPR benchmarks
are solved by methods using Vision-Foundation-Model backbones and trained on
large-scale and diverse VPR-specific datasets. Several benchmarks remain
challenging, particularly when the test environments differ significantly from
the usual VPR training datasets. We propose a complementary, unexplored source
of information to bridge the train-test domain gap, which can further improve
the performance of State-of-the-Art (SOTA) VPR methods on such challenging
benchmarks. Concretely, we identify that the test-time reference set, the
"map", contains images and poses of the target domain, and must be available
before the test-time query is received in several VPR applications. Therefore,
we propose to perform simple Reference-Set-Finetuning (RSF) of VPR models on
the map, boosting the SOTA (~2.3% increase on average for Recall@1) on these
challenging datasets. Finetuned models retain generalization, and RSF works
across diverse test datasets.

TL;DR: ARSAM通过自适应采样-重用-混合分解梯度来加速SAM，在保持泛化能力的同时减少计算成本约40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM虽然能提升模型泛化能力，但计算成本是SGD的两倍，需要更高效的优化方法。

Method: 将SAM梯度分解为SGD梯度和二阶梯度在一阶梯度上的投影(PSF)，并重用PSF和及时更新PSF来维持泛化能力。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100等数据集上达到与SAM相当的准确率，速度提升约40%，在姿态估计和模型量化等挑战任务中同样有效。

Conclusion: ARSAM在保持SAM泛化优势的同时显著降低了计算成本，具有广泛的实用性。

Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves model generalization but doubles
the computational cost of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) by requiring twice
the gradient calculations per optimization step. To mitigate this, we propose
Adaptively sampling-Reusing-mixing decomposed gradients to significantly
accelerate SAM (ARSAM). Concretely, we firstly discover that SAM's gradient can
be decomposed into the SGD gradient and the Projection of the Second-order
gradient onto the First-order gradient (PSF). Furthermore, we observe that the
SGD gradient and PSF dynamically evolve during training, emphasizing the
growing role of the PSF to achieve a flat minima. Therefore, ARSAM is proposed
to the reused PSF and the timely updated PSF still maintain the model's
generalization ability. Extensive experiments show that ARSAM achieves
state-of-the-art accuracies comparable to SAM across diverse network
architectures. On CIFAR-10/100, ARSAM is comparable to SAM while providing a
speedup of about 40\%. Moreover, ARSAM accelerates optimization for the various
challenge tasks (\textit{e.g.}, human pose estimation, and model quantization)
without sacrificing performance, demonstrating its broad practicality.% The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型主要依赖最终层特征，忽略了浅层和多尺度特征，缺乏有效的概念编码指导，限制了细粒度概念的提取能力。

Method: 提出CoPA框架，包含概念感知嵌入生成器(CEG)从视觉编码器各层提取概念表示，以及概念提示调优(CPT)引导模型关注关键概念相关视觉线索，最后聚合各层视觉表示与文本概念表示对齐。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验结果表明，CoPA在概念和疾病预测性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CoPA框架能够有效捕获和利用图像中的概念信息，显著提升了概念和疾病预测的性能。

Abstract: The transparency of deep learning models is essential for clinical
diagnostics. Concept Bottleneck Model provides clear decision-making processes
for diagnosis by transforming the latent space of black-box models into
human-understandable concepts. However, concept-based methods still face
challenges in concept capture capabilities. These methods often rely on encode
features solely from the final layer, neglecting shallow and multiscale
features, and lack effective guidance in concept encoding, hindering
fine-grained concept extraction. To address these issues, we introduce Concept
Prompting and Aggregating (CoPA), a novel framework designed to capture
multilayer concepts under prompt guidance. This framework utilizes the
Concept-aware Embedding Generator (CEG) to extract concept representations from
each layer of the visual encoder. Simultaneously, these representations serve
as prompts for Concept Prompt Tuning (CPT), steering the model towards
amplifying critical concept-related visual cues. Visual representations from
each layer are aggregated to align with textual concept representations. With
the proposed method, valuable concept-wise information in the images is
captured and utilized effectively, thus improving the performance of concept
and disease prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CoPA
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three public datasets. Code is

Motivation: 解决3D医学影像数据集规模大、复杂度高带来的协作研究和可移植性障碍。

Method: 在包含真实血管分割的3D医学数据集上应用ZFP压缩技术的误差容忍和固定速率两种模式。

Conclusion: ZFP是促进大规模医学数据集高效和可访问研究的有效工具，有助于推动更广泛的社区协作。

Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of medical imaging datasets, particularly
in 3D formats, present significant barriers to collaborative research and
transferability. This study investigates whether the ZFP compression technique
can mitigate these challenges without compromising the performance of automated
cerebrovascular segmentation, a critical first step in intracranial aneurysm
detection. We apply ZFP in both its error tolerance and fixed-rate modes to a
large scale, and one of the most recent, datasets in the literature, 3D medical
dataset containing ground-truth vascular segmentations. The segmentation
quality on the compressed volumes is rigorously compared to the uncompressed
baseline (Dice approximately equals 0.8774). Our findings reveal that ZFP can
achieve substantial data reduction--up to a 22.89:1 ratio in error tolerance
mode--while maintaining a high degree of fidelity, with the mean Dice
coefficient remaining high at 0.87656. These results demonstrate that ZFP is a
viable and powerful tool for enabling more efficient and accessible research on
large-scale medical datasets, fostering broader collaboration across the
community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型多为任务特定，在不同模态和解剖区域性能差异大，难以平衡模型复杂度和性能，临床应用中需要兼顾准确性和效率。

Method: 采用三分支编码器整合CNN、Transformer和Mamba注意力融合机制，捕获局部、全局和长程依赖；多尺度注意力CNN解码器重建细粒度分割图；共注意力门增强特征选择和跨尺度通信。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和泛化性方面优于现有最优方法，同时保持可比较的计算复杂度。

Conclusion: 该架构通过有效平衡效率和效果，为多样化医学成像任务提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has shown near-expert performance in
segmenting complex medical tissues and tumors. However, existing models are
often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical
regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging,
particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are
critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation
architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs,
Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture
local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN
decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual
consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by
emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both
encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale
communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that
our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and
generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By
effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a
practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code
and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support
reproducibility and further research.

Motivation: 城市安全和基础设施维护是智慧城市发展的关键。人工监测道路损坏耗时、成本高且易出错，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用YOLOv9算法，采用多边形标注而非传统边界框，在包含1000多张图像的数据集上训练三类检测模型（损坏、未损坏、井盖）。

Result: 总体图像级准确率78.1%，损坏类F1分数86.7%，未损坏类89.2%，井盖类仅18.2%（因类别不平衡问题）。

Conclusion: 该方法为发展中国家城市基础设施监控提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Urban safety and infrastructure maintenance are critical components of smart
city development. Manual monitoring of road damages is time-consuming, highly
costly, and error-prone. This paper presents a deep learning approach for
automated road damage and manhole detection using the YOLOv9 algorithm with
polygonal annotations. Unlike traditional bounding box annotation, we employ
polygonal annotations for more precise localization of road defects. We develop
a novel dataset comprising more than one thousand images which are mostly
collected from Dhaka, Bangladesh. This dataset is used to train a YOLO-based
model for three classes, namely Broken, Not Broken, and Manhole. We achieve
78.1% overall image-level accuracy. The YOLOv9 model demonstrates strong
performance for Broken (86.7% F1-score) and Not Broken (89.2% F1-score)
classes, with challenges in Manhole detection (18.2% F1-score) due to class
imbalance. Our approach offers an efficient and scalable solution for
monitoring urban infrastructure in developing countries.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合对比学习和扩散模型的无监督图像到图像翻译方法，通过时间相关的对比学习保留域不变特征，引导预训练的SDE模型进行翻译任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无配对图像翻译需要在不使用对齐样本的情况下学习源域和目标域之间的映射。扩散模型能够生成高质量多样化输出，对比学习能够学习语义相似性，两者都适合无配对翻译场景。

Method: 使用时间相关的对比学习方法，将图像及其域不变特征作为正样本对进行SimCLR训练，然后利用学到的对比模型指导预训练的随机微分方程进行图像翻译。

Result: 在三个常见的无配对图像翻译任务上与多个基线方法进行比较，使用四个评估指标。Contrastive-SDE在多个指标上达到与最先进方法相当的结果，收敛速度显著更快，且无需标签监督或分类器训练。

Conclusion: 该方法为无配对图像翻译任务提供了一个更高效的替代方案，结合了对比学习和扩散模型的优势，实现了快速收敛和无监督学习。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation involves learning mappings between source
domain and target domain in the absence of aligned or corresponding samples.
Score based diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
generative tasks. Their ability to approximate complex data distributions
through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) enables them to generate
high-fidelity and diverse outputs, making them particularly well-suited for
unpaired I2I settings. In parallel, contrastive learning provides a powerful
framework for learning semantic similarities without the need for explicit
supervision or paired data. By pulling together representations of semantically
similar samples and pushing apart dissimilar ones, contrastive methods are
inherently aligned with the objectives of unpaired translation. Its ability to
selectively enforce semantic consistency at the feature level makes contrastive
learning particularly effective for guiding generation in unpaired scenarios.
In this work, we propose a time-dependent contrastive learning approach where a
model is trained with SimCLR by considering an image and its domain invarient
feature as a positive pair, enabling the preservation of domain-invariant
features and the discarding of domain-specific ones. The learned contrastive
model then guides the inference of a pretrained SDE for the I2I translation
task. We empirically compare Contrastive-SDE with several baselines across
three common unpaired I2I tasks, using four metrics for evaluation.
Constrastive-SDE achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art on several
metrics. Furthermore, we observe that our model converges significantly faster
and requires no label supervision or classifier training, making it a more
efficient alternative for this task.

TL;DR: LIBERO-PRO扩展了LIBERO基准测试，通过系统性的扰动评估发现现有VLA模型在标准测试中表现优异，但在泛化设置下性能崩溃至0%，揭示了模型依赖记忆而非真正理解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LIBERO基准测试的训练和评估设置存在问题，导致性能估计被夸大且无法公平比较模型。需要更严格的评估方法来测试模型的真实泛化能力。

Method: 引入LIBERO-PRO基准，在四个维度上系统评估模型性能：操作对象、初始状态、任务指令和环境。通过合理的扰动来测试模型的鲁棒性。

Result: 实验结果显示，现有模型在标准LIBERO评估中达到90%以上准确率，但在广义设置下性能崩溃至0.0%。模型依赖对训练集中动作序列和环境布局的死记硬背。

Conclusion: 当前评估方法存在严重缺陷，呼吁社区放弃误导性方法，采用更稳健的评估来测试模型的泛化能力和理解能力。

Abstract: LIBERO has emerged as a widely adopted benchmark for evaluating
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models; however, its current training and
evaluation settings are problematic, often leading to inflated performance
estimates and preventing fair model comparison. To address these issues, we
introduce LIBERO-PRO, an extended LIBERO benchmark that systematically
evaluates model performance under reasonable perturbations across four
dimensions: manipulated objects, initial states, task instructions, and
environments. Experimental results reveal that, although existing models
achieve over 90% accuracy under the standard LIBERO evaluation, their
performance collapses to 0.0% under our generalized setting. Crucially, this
discrepancy exposes the models' reliance on rote memorization of action
sequences and environment layouts from the training set, rather than genuine
task understanding or environmental perception. For instance, models persist in
executing grasping actions when the target object is replaced with irrelevant
items, and their outputs remain unchanged even when given corrupted
instructions or even messy tokens. These findings expose the severe flaws in
current evaluation practices, and we call on the community to abandon
misleading methodologies in favor of robust assessments of model generalization
and comprehension. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 当前AI生成图像越来越难以被标准检测器识别，但人类仍能区分。研究旨在解决检测器与人类判断之间的差距。

Method: 构建Mirage数据集，包含多样化的AI生成图像；评估大型视觉语言模型在检测AI生成图像方面的能力。

Result: 大型视觉语言模型在检测具有可见伪影的AI生成图像时表现优异，但在缺乏此类线索的图像上性能下降。

Conclusion: LVLMs可作为可解释AI图像检测的有效工具，特别是在存在可见伪影的情况下，但对于高质量生成图像仍需改进检测方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation models have led to models that produce
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult for standard AI detectors to
identify, even though they often remain distinguishable by humans. To identify
this discrepancy, we introduce \textbf{Mirage}, a curated dataset comprising a
diverse range of AI-generated images exhibiting visible artifacts, where
current state-of-the-art detection methods largely fail. Furthermore, we
investigate whether Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are
increasingly employed as substitutes for human judgment in various tasks, can
be leveraged for explainable AI image detection. Our experiments on both Mirage
and existing benchmark datasets demonstrate that while LVLMs are highly
effective at detecting AI-generated images with visible artifacts, their
performance declines when confronted with images lacking such cues.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉接地范式的两个主要问题：1）依赖固定最后一层隐藏层，导致层间传播误差累积；2）使用<SEG>作为提示，缺乏明确的空间线索。

Method: 提出Policy-Prompted Masking，包含两个关键组件：Stochastic Skip Connection（SSC）通过强化学习策略动态选择连接层，Mask as Prompt（MasP）使用相似度图作为软逻辑掩码来提示SAM生成掩码。

Result: 首次在单一框架内统一了从传统参考表达式分割到推理分割、单目标到多目标、正查询到错误前提的视觉接地任务。

Conclusion: UGround通过动态层选择和明确空间线索，提供了一种更有效的视觉接地解决方案，所有代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: We present UGround, a \textbf{U}nified visual \textbf{Ground}ing paradigm
that dynamically selects intermediate layers across \textbf{U}nrolled
transformers as ``mask as prompt'', diverging from the prevailing pipeline that
leverages the fixed last hidden layer as ``\texttt{<SEG>} as prompt''. UGround
addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its
reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies
cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate
correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly
projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues
(\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which
comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as
Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic
sampling, allows each \texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer
layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision
model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer,
MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{<SEG>} token and image
tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering
explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the
effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding
within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from
traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning
segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise
(empty target). All codes and models are publicly available at

Motivation: 4D高斯溅射虽然能够实时渲染复杂动态场景，但面临存储开销过大的挑战，需要数百万个高斯函数进行高保真重建。现有方法在压缩比或视觉质量方面仍存在局限性。

Method: 采用三阶段渐进式剪枝：高斯采样识别关键基元、高斯剪枝去除冗余、高斯合并融合相似特征。同时集成隐式外观压缩和广义子向量量化技术。

Result: 在标准基准数据集上的实验表明，OMG4显著优于现有最先进方法，在保持重建质量的同时将模型大小减少超过60%。

Conclusion: OMG4在紧凑4D场景表示方面迈出了重要一步，为广泛应用开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: 4D Gaussian Splatting has emerged as a new paradigm for dynamic scene
representation, enabling real-time rendering of scenes with complex motions.
However, it faces a major challenge of storage overhead, as millions of
Gaussians are required for high-fidelity reconstruction. While several studies
have attempted to alleviate this memory burden, they still face limitations in
compression ratio or visual quality. In this work, we present OMG4 (Optimized
Minimal 4D Gaussian Splatting), a framework that constructs a compact set of
salient Gaussians capable of faithfully representing 4D Gaussian models. Our
method progressively prunes Gaussians in three stages: (1) Gaussian Sampling to
identify primitives critical to reconstruction fidelity, (2) Gaussian Pruning
to remove redundancies, and (3) Gaussian Merging to fuse primitives with
similar characteristics. In addition, we integrate implicit appearance
compression and generalize Sub-Vector Quantization (SVQ) to 4D representations,
further reducing storage while preserving quality. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that OMG4 significantly outperforms
recent state-of-the-art methods, reducing model sizes by over 60% while
maintaining reconstruction quality. These results position OMG4 as a
significant step forward in compact 4D scene representation, opening new
possibilities for a wide range of applications. Our source code is available at

*Jyoti Kini,Rohit Gupta,Mubarak Shah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将地面视图开放词汇检测模型适配到航拍图像的新框架，通过结构化域对齐解决跨域知识迁移问题，在多个数据集上显著提升零样本检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测模型在固定类别集上训练，缺乏灵活性且扩展成本高。开放词汇检测能识别未见类别，但航拍图像与地面视图存在领域差异、视角变化和尺度差异，直接迁移无效，需要专门适配策略。

Method: 提出结构化域对齐框架：1）对比图像-图像对齐增强航拍与地面视图嵌入相似性；2）多实例词汇关联对齐航拍图像与文本嵌入。

Result: 在xView、DOTAv2、VisDrone、DIOR和HRRSD数据集上验证，零样本设置下相比微调封闭词汇模型，DOTAv2提升+6.32 mAP，VisDrone提升+4.16 mAP，HRRSD提升+3.46 mAP。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了航拍图像开放词汇检测的跨域适配问题，为航拍应用提供了更灵活可扩展的目标检测系统。

Abstract: Traditional object detection models are typically trained on a fixed set of
classes, limiting their flexibility and making it costly to incorporate new
categories. Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by
enabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training.
Leveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available
ground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for
open-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint
variations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across
domains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework for adapting open-vocabulary
representations from ground-view images to solve object detection in aerial
imagery through structured domain alignment. The method introduces contrastive
image-to-image alignment to enhance the similarity between aerial and
ground-view embeddings and employs multi-instance vocabulary associations to
align aerial images with text embeddings. Extensive experiments on the xView,
DOTAv2, VisDrone, DIOR, and HRRSD datasets are used to validate our approach.
Our open-vocabulary model achieves improvements of +6.32 mAP on DOTAv2, +4.16
mAP on VisDrone (Images), and +3.46 mAP on HRRSD in the zero-shot setting when
compared to finetuned closed-vocabulary dataset-specific model performance,
thus paving the way for more flexible and scalable object detection systems in
aerial applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN在生成任务中表现出色，但计算需求大难以部署在资源受限设备上。知识蒸馏是GAN压缩的有前景方向，但由于学生生成器与教师判别器之间的容量不匹配，有效训练小型学生生成器具有挑战性

Method: 提出学生判别器辅助知识蒸馏(SDAKD)，引入学生判别器缓解容量不匹配问题。采用三阶段训练策略，并在最后两个训练阶段集成适配的特征图蒸馏方法

Result: 在GCFSR和Real-ESRGAN两个高性能超分辨率GAN上评估SDAKD，实验表明相比基线和SOTA GAN知识蒸馏方法取得了一致性改进

Conclusion: SDAKD方法有效解决了GAN知识蒸馏中的容量不匹配问题，为资源受限设备上的GAN部署提供了可行的压缩方案

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) achieve excellent performance in
generative tasks, such as image super-resolution, but their computational
requirements make difficult their deployment on resource-constrained devices.
While knowledge distillation is a promising research direction for GAN
compression, effectively training a smaller student generator is challenging
due to the capacity mismatch between the student generator and the teacher
discriminator. In this work, we propose Student Discriminator Assisted
Knowledge Distillation (SDAKD), a novel GAN distillation methodology that
introduces a student discriminator to mitigate this capacity mismatch. SDAKD
follows a three-stage training strategy, and integrates an adapted feature map
distillation approach in its last two training stages. We evaluated SDAKD on
two well-performing super-resolution GANs, GCFSR and Real-ESRGAN. Our
experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over the baselines and SOTA GAN
knowledge distillation methods. The SDAKD source code will be made openly
available upon acceptance of the paper.

Conclusion: PoseGaze-AHP是首个公开可用的眼源性异常头位AI诊断资源，支持开发准确且符合隐私要求的诊断工具。

Abstract: Diagnosing ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) requires a
comprehensive analysis of both head pose and ocular movements. However,
existing datasets focus on these aspects separately, limiting the development
of integrated diagnostic approaches and restricting AI-driven advancements in
AHP analysis. To address this gap, we introduce PoseGaze-AHP, a novel 3D
dataset that synchronously captures head pose and gaze movement information for
ocular-induced AHP assessment. Structured clinical data were extracted from
medical literature using large language models (LLMs) through an iterative
process with the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, combining stepwise, hierarchical, and
complex prompting strategies. The extracted records were systematically imputed
and transformed into 3D representations using the Neural Head Avatar (NHA)
framework. The dataset includes 7,920 images generated from two head textures,
covering a broad spectrum of ocular conditions. The extraction method achieved
an overall accuracy of 91.92%, demonstrating its reliability for clinical
dataset construction. PoseGaze-AHP is the first publicly available resource
tailored for AI-driven ocular-induced AHP diagnosis, supporting the development
of accurate and privacy-compliant diagnostic tools.

*Yunhao Li,Sijing Wu,Yucheng Zhu,Huiyu Duan,Zicheng Zhang,Guangtao Zhai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个大规模动态数字人质量评估数据集DHQA-4D，并开发了DynaMesh-Rater方法，这是一个基于大语言模型的质量评估方法，能够同时评估带纹理和不带纹理的4D人体网格。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着3D扫描和重建技术的发展，基于4D网格的动态数字人化身越来越流行，但这些4D人体网格在采集、压缩和传输过程中容易受到各种噪声的影响，影响用户体验，因此动态4D数字人的质量评估变得非常重要。

Method: 提出DynaMesh-Rater方法，精心提取多维度特征：从投影2D视频中提取视觉特征，从裁剪视频片段中提取运动特征，从4D人体网格中提取几何特征。然后利用大语言模型整合这些多维度特征，并采用LoRA指令调优技术来预测质量分数。

Result: 在DHQA-4D数据集上的大量实验结果表明，DynaMesh-Rater方法优于之前的质量评估方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为动态4D数字人质量评估提供了有效的数据集和方法，能够全面评估带纹理和不带纹理的4D人体网格质量。

Abstract: With the rapid development of 3D scanning and reconstruction technologies,
dynamic digital human avatars based on 4D meshes have become increasingly
popular. A high-precision dynamic digital human avatar can be applied to
various fields such as game production, animation generation, and remote
immersive communication. However, these 4D human avatar meshes are prone to
being degraded by various types of noise during the processes of collection,
compression, and transmission, thereby affecting the viewing experience of
users. In light of this fact, quality assessment of dynamic 4D digital humans
becomes increasingly important. In this paper, we first propose a large-scale
dynamic digital human quality assessment dataset, DHQA-4D, which contains 32
high-quality real-scanned 4D human mesh sequences, 1920 distorted textured 4D
human meshes degraded by 11 textured distortions, as well as their
corresponding textured and non-textured mean opinion scores (MOSs). Equipped
with DHQA-4D dataset, we analyze the influence of different types of distortion
on human perception for textured dynamic 4D meshes and non-textured dynamic 4D
meshes. Additionally, we propose DynaMesh-Rater, a novel large multimodal model
(LMM) based approach that is able to assess both textured 4D meshes and
non-textured 4D meshes. Concretely, DynaMesh-Rater elaborately extracts
multi-dimensional features, including visual features from a projected 2D
video, motion features from cropped video clips, and geometry features from the
4D human mesh to provide comprehensive quality-related information. Then we
utilize a LMM model to integrate the multi-dimensional features and conduct a
LoRA-based instruction tuning technique to teach the LMM model to predict the
quality scores. Extensive experimental results on the DHQA-4D dataset
demonstrate the superiority of our DynaMesh-Rater method over previous quality
assessment methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于ASFF改进的ResNet-50模型，用于皮肤癌分类，通过自适应融合多尺度特征来提高特征表示能力并减少过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌分类面临类间相似性高、类内变异性大和图像噪声等挑战，需要更有效的特征提取方法来提高分类性能。

Method: 在ResNet-50基础上引入自适应空间特征融合(ASFF)机制，采用双分支设计融合高层语义和中层细节特征，通过全局平均池化和全连接层生成自适应权重进行加权融合。

Result: 在ISIC 2020数据集子集(3297张图像)上测试，准确率达到93.18%，AUC值在P-R和ROC曲线上分别为0.9670和0.9717，优于5种经典CNN模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算机辅助皮肤癌诊断提供了更有效和高效的解决方案，Grad-CAM可视化验证了模型能够自适应关注病变相关区域。

Abstract: Skin cancer classification remains a challenging problem due to high
inter-class similarity, intra-class variability, and image noise in dermoscopic
images. To address these issues, we propose an improved ResNet-50 model
enhanced with Adaptive Spatial Feature Fusion (ASFF), which adaptively
integrates multi-scale semantic and surface features to improve feature
representation and reduce overfitting. The ResNet-50 model is enhanced with an
adaptive feature fusion mechanism to achieve more effective multi-scale feature
extraction and improve overall performance. Specifically, a dual-branch design
fuses high-level semantic and mid-level detail features, which are processed
through global average pooling and fully connected layers to generate adaptive
weights for weighted fusion, thereby strengthening feature learning and
reducing the impact of noise on classification. The method is evaluated on a
subset of the ISIC 2020 dataset containing 3297 benign and malignant skin
lesion images. Experimental results show that the proposed ASFF-based ResNet-50
achieves the best overall performance compared with 5 classic convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) models. The proposed model reached an accuracy of 93.18%
along with higher precision, recall, specificity, and F1 score. The improved
model achieves an AUC value of 0.9670 and 0.9717 in the P-R and ROC curve,
respectively. Then, the evaluation based on Grad-CAM further proved that the
improved model adaptively focuses on lesion-relevant regions while suppressing
irrelevant background information, thereby validating its enhanced feature
learning capability from a deep representation perspective. These findings
demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a more effective and efficient
solution for computer-aided skin cancer diagnosis.

Conclusion: 多模态集成框架提供非侵入性AI辅助分诊工具，改善高风险病变的早期识别，支持临床决策，减少诊断延迟，改善患者预后。

Abstract: Aims Late diagnosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) contributes
significantly to its high global mortality rate, with over 50\% of cases
detected at advanced stages and a 5-year survival rate below 50\% according to
WHO statistics. This study aims to improve early detection of OSCC by
developing a multimodal deep learning framework that integrates clinical,
radiological, and histopathological images using a weighted ensemble of
DenseNet-121 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Material and Methods A
retrospective study was conducted using publicly available datasets
representing three distinct medical imaging modalities. Each modality-specific
dataset was used to train a DenseNet-121 CNN via transfer learning.
Augmentation and modality-specific preprocessing were applied to increase
robustness. Predictions were fused using a validation-weighted ensemble
strategy. Evaluation was performed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
Results High validation accuracy was achieved for radiological (100\%) and
histopathological (95.12\%) modalities, with clinical images performing lower
(63.10\%) due to visual heterogeneity. The ensemble model demonstrated improved
diagnostic robustness with an overall accuracy of 84.58\% on a multimodal
validation dataset of 55 samples. Conclusion The multimodal ensemble framework
bridges gaps in the current diagnostic workflow by offering a non-invasive,
AI-assisted triage tool that enhances early identification of high-risk
lesions. It supports clinicians in decision-making, aligning with global
oncology guidelines to reduce diagnostic delays and improve patient outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过构建大规模指令调优数据集来赋予多模态大语言模型质量感知能力，但大量数据会导致计算成本高和数据冗余，反而损害模型性能。

Method: 使用预训练MLLM，首先研究不同规模指令调优数据对性能的影响，然后提出三阶段聚类数据选择框架：聚类特征提取、聚类配额分配和聚类采样策略。

Result: IQA-Select在Q-Bench和AesBench上仅使用10%选定数据就能分别达到全量微调性能的102.1%和103.7%，显著降低计算成本的同时获得更好性能。

Conclusion: 数据质量比数据数量更重要，提出的IQA-Select方法有效解决了可解释IQA中的数据冗余问题，为高效模型训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: In recent years, with the rapid development of powerful multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), explainable image quality assessment (IQA) has
gradually become popular, aiming at providing quality-related descriptions and
answers of images. To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a
large-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality
perception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large
amount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and
redundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model.
To cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and
systematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning
dataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first
investigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different
sizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data
set randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than
training with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the
redundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data. Beyond randomly
sampling a subset, we propose a clustering-based data selection framework with
three stages: clustering feature extraction, cluster quota allocation, and
cluster sampling strategy. Then we systematically analyze the choices of each
stage and propose a simple but efficient data selection method IQA-Select for
explainable IQA. The experimental results demonstrate that IQA-Select can
achieve 102.1% and 103.7% performance of full fine-tuning using only 10%
selected data in Q-Bench and AesBench respectively, significantly reducing
computational costs while achieving better performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLA模型在将推理能力转化为物理世界时泛化能力差，双系统方法存在语义模糊问题，需要在新环境中重新微调。

Method: 使用稀疏3D路径点作为中间表示，VLM生成粗略路径点，动作专家通过实时点云观测将其细化为密集可执行动作序列，采用"动作预训练、点云微调"范式。

Result: 结合了VLM在视觉理解和规划方面的广泛泛化能力与动作专家在动作级别的细粒度泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了VLM到物理世界的转换挑战，提高了训练效率和鲁棒泛化能力。

Abstract: Although Vision-Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated impressive planning
and reasoning capabilities, translating these abilities into the physical world
introduces significant challenges. Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture,
generalize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data.
While recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple "thinking" from
"acting", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action
module. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible.
Consequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly
collected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation
mechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined. To address these
limitations, we introduce, for the first time, a framework centered around a
generalizable action expert. Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an
intermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning
capabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module. During the
planning phase, the VLM is only required to generate coarse 3D waypoints. These
waypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines
them into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud
observations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust
generalization, we introduce a novel "Action Pre-training, Pointcloud
Fine-tuning" paradigm. Our method combines the broad generalization
capabilities of VLMs in visual understanding and planning with the
fine-grained, action-level generalization of action expert.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on vision-language reasoning tasks. However, their potential for zero-shot
fine-grained image classification, a challenging task requiring precise
differentiation between visually similar categories, remains underexplored. We
present a novel method that transforms zero-shot fine-grained image
classification into a visual question-answering framework, leveraging LVLMs'
comprehensive understanding capabilities rather than relying on direct class
name generation. We enhance model performance through a novel attention
intervention technique. We also address a key limitation in existing datasets
by developing more comprehensive and precise class description benchmarks. We
validate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experimentation
across multiple fine-grained image classification benchmarks. Our proposed
method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach,

TL;DR: 本文对自动驾驶感知系统在雾天条件下的去雾方法进行了结构化实证研究，评估了多种去雾管道在图像质量和下游任务性能上的表现，并建立了面向任务的去雾方法基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶感知系统在雾天条件下特别脆弱，光线散射会降低对比度并模糊关键细节。现有的去雾方法在图像保真度上的改进并不总能转化为更好的下游检测和分割性能，且先前评估多依赖合成数据，存在真实世界可迁移性问题。

Method: 采用结构化实证研究方法，基准测试了包括经典滤波器、现代去雾网络、链式变体（滤波器→模型、模型→滤波器）以及基于提示的视觉语言图像编辑模型在内的综合管道集。使用Foggy Cityscapes数据集评估图像质量和下游性能。

Result: 分析揭示了去雾何时有效、链式方法何时产生协同效应或退化，以及VLM编辑器与专用方法的比较。VLM评判的定性评分与任务指标（特别是mAP）显示出强相关性。

Conclusion: 这些结果建立了一个透明、面向任务的去雾方法基准，并突出了在何种条件下预处理真正改善恶劣天气下的自动驾驶感知性能。

Abstract: Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy
conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details
critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from
handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image
fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and
segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving
questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical
study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical
filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants
(filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven
visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images.
Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance
on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals
when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how
VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate
qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment
with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these
results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods
and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves
autonomous perception in adverse weather.

Motivation: 尽管视频扩散模型进展迅速，但在通用人体视频生成方面仍未被充分探索，大多数工作局限于图像到视频设置或狭窄领域。

Method: 分析并准备文本提示和视觉条件来有效训练VDM，确保运动描述、条件信号和生成视频之间的鲁棒对齐；引入相机感知条件模块连接两个阶段，自动选择与输入文本对齐的视点。

Conclusion: CAMEO通过级联框架成功实现了通用人体运动视频生成，减少了手动干预并增强了连贯性。

Abstract: Human video generation is becoming an increasingly important task with broad
applications in graphics, entertainment, and embodied AI. Despite the rapid
progress of video diffusion models (VDMs), their use for general-purpose human
video generation remains underexplored, with most works constrained to
image-to-video setups or narrow domains like dance videos. In this work, we
propose CAMEO, a cascaded framework for general human motion video generation.
It seamlessly bridges Text-to-Motion (T2M) models and conditional VDMs,
mitigating suboptimal factors that may arise in this process across both
training and inference through carefully designed components. Specifically, we
analyze and prepare both textual prompts and visual conditions to effectively
train the VDM, ensuring robust alignment between motion descriptions,
conditioning signals, and the generated videos. Furthermore, we introduce a
camera-aware conditioning module that connects the two stages, automatically
selecting viewpoints aligned with the input text to enhance coherence and
reduce manual intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on
both the MovieGen benchmark and a newly introduced benchmark tailored to the
T2M-VDM combination, while highlighting its versatility across diverse use
cases.

Conclusion: OpenFLAME为大规模AR应用提供了可行的分布式定位后端解决方案，解决了集中式VPS的局限性。

Abstract: World-scale augmented reality (AR) applications need a ubiquitous 6DoF
localization backend to anchor content to the real world consistently across
devices. Large organizations such as Google and Niantic are 3D scanning outdoor
public spaces in order to build their own Visual Positioning Systems (VPS).
These centralized VPS solutions fail to meet the needs of many future AR
applications -- they do not cover private indoor spaces because of privacy
concerns, regulations, and the labor bottleneck of updating and maintaining 3D
scans. In this paper, we present OpenFLAME, a federated VPS backend that allows
independent organizations to 3D scan and maintain a separate VPS service for
their own spaces. This enables access control of indoor 3D scans, distributed
maintenance of the VPS backend, and encourages larger coverage. Sharding of VPS
services introduces several unique challenges -- coherency of localization
results across spaces, quality control of VPS services, selection of the right
VPS service for a location, and many others. We introduce the concept of
federated image-based localization and provide reference solutions for managing
and merging data across maps without sharing private data.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个结合CNN-LSTM模型提取生物力学特征，并使用大语言模型生成可操作反馈的网球击球分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统未能将生物力学洞察转化为对球员和教练有意义且可操作的语言反馈。

Method: 使用CNN-LSTM模型从运动数据中提取关节角度、肢体速度和动力链模式等关键生物力学特征，然后利用大语言模型生成反馈。

Result: 基于THETIS数据集和特征提取技术，该方法能够产生技术上准确、生物力学基础扎实且对最终用户可操作的反馈。

Conclusion: 该框架在分类性能和可解释性方面进行了评估，弥合了可解释AI与运动生物力学之间的差距。

Abstract: Automated tennis stroke analysis has advanced significantly with the
integration of biomechanical motion cues alongside deep learning techniques,
enhancing stroke classification accuracy and player performance evaluation.
Despite these advancements, existing systems often fail to connect
biomechanical insights with actionable language feedback that is both
accessible and meaningful to players and coaches. This research project
addresses this gap by developing a novel framework that extracts key
biomechanical features (such as joint angles, limb velocities, and kinetic
chain patterns) from motion data using Convolutional Neural Network Long
Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM)-based models. These features are analyzed for
relationships influencing stroke effectiveness and injury risk, forming the
basis for feedback generation using large language models (LLMs). Leveraging
the THETIS dataset and feature extraction techniques, our approach aims to
produce feedback that is technically accurate, biomechanically grounded, and
actionable for end-users. The experimental setup evaluates this framework on
classification performance and interpretability, bridging the gap between
explainable AI and sports biomechanics.

TL;DR: TimeWarp方法通过创建针对性的合成时序数据集来改进视频大语言模型的时序理解能力，在七个基准测试中显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频大语言模型在需要细粒度时序理解的任务上表现不佳，主要原因是微调数据集缺乏视觉复杂性和时序细节，导致模型过度依赖语言推理而非真正理解视频动态。

Method: 提出TimeWarp方法，系统性地创建针对性的合成时序数据集，通过微调模型响应来鼓励其关注输入视频内容，并构建大规模偏好数据集捕捉常被忽视的复杂时序动态。

Result: 应用该方法后，现有模型在时序理解基准测试中的性能显著提升，在七个基准测试中均取得了绝对性能改进。

Conclusion: TimeWarp方法通过针对性数据集有效提升了视频大语言模型的时序理解能力，证明了所提出数据集在推进视频时序理解方面的有效性。

Abstract: While Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance across general video understanding benchmarks-particularly in video
captioning and descriptive tasks-they consistently underperform on tasks that
require fine-grained temporal understanding. This limitation arises due to the
lack of visual complexity and temporal nuance in current fine-tuning datasets,
leading these models to rely heavily on language-based reasoning rather than
truly understanding video dynamics. In this work, we propose TimeWarp, a
systematic method to create a targeted synthetic temporal dataset to fine-tune
the model's responses to encourage it to focus on the given input video. We
introduce a large-scale preference dataset, created using TimeWarp, that
captures intricate temporal dynamics often overlooked, grounding the model's
responses to visual and temporal information. We demonstrate that when our
method is applied to existing models, it significantly improves performance on
temporal understanding benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of our
proposed datasets in advancing temporal understanding in Video-LLMs, resulting
in an absolute improvement in performance across seven benchmarks. Code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在生物医学视觉语言模型中扩展文本编码器上下文长度的影响，发现更长的上下文能带来更好的检索和分类性能，并提出了BIOMEDICA-LongCAP数据集和BMC-LongCLIP模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型通常使用短文本窗口（<77个token）进行预训练，这导致长格式生物医学描述被截断。然而，大规模开源文献中的生物医学描述有很大部分远超77个token，因此需要研究长上下文预训练的影响。

Method: 扩展视觉语言模型中文本编码器的上下文长度，创建BIOMEDICA-LongCAP数据集（包含100万张图像-描述对，具有来自全文文章的上下文感知描述），并训练BMC-LongCLIP模型，支持最多512个token的文本窗口。

Result: BMC-LongCLIP将上下文容量扩展了6.6倍，token浪费率从55%降至2.2%。在长描述检索基准测试中，Recall@1获得高达30%的绝对增益，分类任务平均提升2%，且收敛速度比短上下文模型更快。

Conclusion: 长上下文建模是推进生物医学视觉语言模型发展的一个有前景的方向，能够有效利用长格式描述中的额外监督信息来提升模型性能。

Abstract: Embedding vision-language models (VLMs) are typically pretrained with short
text windows (<77 tokens), which forces the truncation of long-format captions.
Yet, the distribution of biomedical captions from large-scale open source
literature reveals that a huge portion of captions far exceed 77 tokens. To
this end, we investigate the impact of pretraining on long-format biomedical
captions by extending the context length of text encoders in VLMs. We find that
longer context (thus, enabling additional supervision provided in long-format
captions) correlates with better retrieval and classification performance.
Given this finding, we introduce BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, a dataset of 1M
image-caption pairs enriched with context-aware descriptions from full-text
articles, providing longer and additional textual supervision. Using
BIOMEDICA-LongCAP, we train BMC-LongCLIP, a long-context biomedical VLM with a
text encoder supporting windows of up to 512 tokens. Our model extends context
capacity by 6.6x, reducing token waste from 55% to just 2.2%. On long-caption
retrieval benchmarks, BMC-LongCLIP achieves up to +30% absolute gains in
Recall@1 and +2% average improvements in classification, while also converging
faster than short-context. Our results demonstrate that long-context modeling
is a promising direction for advancing biomedical VLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CPG框架通过可控的伪标签生成机制，在未知未标注数据分布的情况下，动态扩展标注数据集并确保其遵循已知分布，从而解决长尾半监督学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长尾半监督学习方法假设未标注数据遵循预定义分布，但现实中未标注数据的分布通常是未知且任意的，这限制了方法的实际应用效果。

Method: 提出可控伪标签生成框架，包含：动态可控过滤机制选择可靠伪标签、基于更新后标注数据分布的贝叶斯最优分类器构建、类感知自适应增强模块改善少数类表示、辅助分支最大化数据利用。

Result: 在多个常用基准数据集上的综合评估显示，CPG实现了持续改进，在准确率上超过最先进方法高达15.97%。

Conclusion: CPG框架通过自增强优化循环有效解决了未标注数据分布未知的长尾半监督学习问题，理论证明可显著降低泛化误差，并在实验中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Current long-tailed semi-supervised learning methods assume that labeled data
exhibit a long-tailed distribution, and unlabeled data adhere to a typical
predefined distribution (i.e., long-tailed, uniform, or inverse long-tailed).
However, the distribution of the unlabeled data is generally unknown and may
follow an arbitrary distribution. To tackle this challenge, we propose a
Controllable Pseudo-label Generation (CPG) framework, expanding the labeled
dataset with the progressively identified reliable pseudo-labels from the
unlabeled dataset and training the model on the updated labeled dataset with a
known distribution, making it unaffected by the unlabeled data distribution.
Specifically, CPG operates through a controllable self-reinforcing optimization
cycle: (i) at each training step, our dynamic controllable filtering mechanism
selectively incorporates reliable pseudo-labels from the unlabeled dataset into
the labeled dataset, ensuring that the updated labeled dataset follows a known
distribution; (ii) we then construct a Bayes-optimal classifier using logit
adjustment based on the updated labeled data distribution; (iii) this improved
classifier subsequently helps identify more reliable pseudo-labels in the next
training step. We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can
significantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions.
Additionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further
improve the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to
maximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples.
Comprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that
CPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up
to \textbf{15.97\%} in accuracy. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有OCR系统在处理越南汉喃古籍时面临图像退化、非标准字形和手写变体等挑战，影响历史文献数字化和跨语言语义研究。

Method: 对PaddleOCRv5文本识别模块进行微调，使用精选的越南汉喃古籍数据集，构建完整的训练流程包括预处理、LMDB转换、评估和可视化。

Result: 实验结果显示识别准确率显著提升，从37.5%提高到50.0%，在噪声图像条件下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效改善了汉喃文本识别性能，开发的可视化演示系统支持汉越语义对齐、机器翻译和历史语言学研究等下游应用。

Abstract: Recognizing and processing Classical Chinese (Han-Nom) texts play a vital
role in digitizing Vietnamese historical documents and enabling cross-lingual
semantic research. However, existing OCR systems struggle with degraded scans,
non-standard glyphs, and handwriting variations common in ancient sources. In
this work, we propose a fine-tuning approach for PaddleOCRv5 to improve
character recognition on Han-Nom texts. We retrain the text recognition module
using a curated subset of ancient Vietnamese Chinese manuscripts, supported by
a full training pipeline covering preprocessing, LMDB conversion, evaluation,
and visualization. Experimental results show a significant improvement over the
base model, with exact accuracy increasing from 37.5 percent to 50.0 percent,
particularly under noisy image conditions. Furthermore, we develop an
interactive demo that visually compares pre- and post-fine-tuning recognition
results, facilitating downstream applications such as Han-Vietnamese semantic
alignment, machine translation, and historical linguistics research. The demo

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaSeg是一个基于元学习的隐式神经表示框架，用于医学图像分割，能够在参数减少90%的情况下达到与U-Net相当的Dice分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INRs)在信号表示方面表现出色，但不适用于分割等预测任务，因为它们需要学习信号分布上的语义结构。

Method: MetaSeg使用一个基础INR同时预测像素强度值和类别标签，通过元学习过程在训练数据集上找到最优初始参数，使得INR只需微调即可适应未见过的测试图像并自动解码类别标签。

Result: 在2D和3D脑部MRI分割任务中，MetaSeg报告的Dice分数与常用的U-Net模型相当，但参数减少了90%。

Conclusion: MetaSeg为医学图像分割提供了一个新颖、可扩展的替代方案，相比传统资源密集型架构如U-Net和视觉变换器更具优势。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have achieved remarkable successes in
learning expressive yet compact signal representations. However, they are not
naturally amenable to predictive tasks such as segmentation, where they must
learn semantic structures over a distribution of signals. In this study, we
introduce MetaSeg, a meta-learning framework to train INRs for medical image
segmentation. MetaSeg uses an underlying INR that simultaneously predicts per
pixel intensity values and class labels. It then uses a meta-learning procedure
to find optimal initial parameters for this INR over a training dataset of
images and segmentation maps, such that the INR can simply be fine-tuned to fit
pixels of an unseen test image, and automatically decode its class labels. We
evaluated MetaSeg on 2D and 3D brain MRI segmentation tasks and report Dice
scores comparable to commonly used U-Net models, but with $90\%$ fewer
parameters. MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional
resource-heavy architectures such as U-Nets and vision transformers for medical
image segmentation. Our project is available at

TL;DR: Video-in-the-Loop (ViTL) 是一个两阶段长视频问答框架，通过定位问题相关片段和重新分配视觉token来在固定token预算下提高问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频问答中计算效率低下的问题，传统方法处理长视频需要大量计算资源，ViTL旨在在固定token预算下提高问答性能。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 使用低帧率浏览定位问题相关时间片段；2) 在更高有效帧率下重新分配视觉token进行问答，采用交错组相对目标进行端到端训练。

Result: 在固定token预算下，ViTL在长视频问答和时间定位任务上性能提升达8.6%，同时减少50%的帧输入，span感知的token重分配始终优于均匀采样。

Conclusion: ViTL和配套数据集提供了一个可解释、计算高效的解决方案，为可扩展的长视频问答奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present \emph{Video-in-the-Loop} (ViTL), a two-stage long-video QA
framework that preserves a fixed token budget by first \emph{localizing}
question-relevant interval(s) with a low-fps skim and then \emph{answering} via
span-aware reallocation of visual tokens at higher effective frame rate,
emitting an interleaved output with both spans and the final option for direct
attribution. We also introduce \dataname{}, which converts description based
event graphs into \emph{span-grounded} multiple-choice QA by pairing each
question with \emph{ground-truth} time span(s) and related reasoning. ViTL is
trained end-to-end with an interleaved group-relative objective that couples
temporal IoU for localization with answer correctness, allowing credit to flow
from answers back to spans without increasing compute. Under fixed token
budgets, ViTL attains up to 8.6% with 50% less frame input on long-video QA and
temporal grounding (e.g., Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions) and ablations
show that span-aware token reallocation consistently surpasses uniform
sampling. Together, \dataname{} and ViTL provide an interpretable,
compute-efficient recipe for scalable long-video QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假新闻检测器因训练数据有限且多样性不足，导致模式偏见和性能受限。真实场景中视频素材与虚假新闻事件存在复杂的多对多关系，但现有数据集未能充分反映这种关系。

Method: 采用多LLM驱动流水线模拟四种新闻视频造假类别，结合基于不确定性采样的主动学习策略选择有用的增强样本。

Result: 在两个基准数据集上的实验结果表明，AgentAug能持续提升短视频假新闻检测器的性能。

Conclusion: AgentAug框架通过数据增强有效解决了假新闻视频检测中的数据稀疏问题，为提升检测性能提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The emergence of fake news on short video platforms has become a new
significant societal concern, necessitating automatic video-news-specific
detection. Current detectors primarily rely on pattern-based features to
separate fake news videos from real ones. However, limited and less diversified
training data lead to biased patterns and hinder their performance. This
weakness stems from the complex many-to-many relationships between video
material segments and fabricated news events in real-world scenarios: a single
video clip can be utilized in multiple ways to create different fake
narratives, while a single fabricated event often combines multiple distinct
video segments. However, existing datasets do not adequately reflect such
relationships due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating large-scale
real-world data, resulting in sparse coverage and non-comprehensive learning of
the characteristics of potential fake news video creation. To address this
issue, we propose a data augmentation framework, AgentAug, that generates
diverse fake news videos by simulating typical creative processes. AgentAug
implements multiple LLM-driven pipelines of four fabrication categories for
news video creation, combined with an active learning strategy based on
uncertainty sampling to select the potentially useful augmented samples during
training. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that
AgentAug consistently improves the performance of short video fake news
detectors.

Conclusion: 这项工作有助于理解和改进超参数设置与神经网络模型架构选择之间的相互作用，特别是在注意力机制方面，对提升图像编辑质量有重要贡献。

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing have shifted from manual pixel manipulation
to employing deep learning methods like stable diffusion models, which now
leverage cross-attention mechanisms for text-driven control. This transition
has simplified the editing process but also introduced variability in results,
such as inconsistent hair color changes. Our research aims to enhance the
precision and reliability of prompt-to-prompt image editing frameworks by
exploring and optimizing hyperparameters. We present a comprehensive study of
the "word swap" method, develop an "attention re-weight method" for better
adaptability, and propose the "CL P2P" framework to address existing
limitations like cycle inconsistency. This work contributes to understanding
and improving the interaction between hyperparameter settings and the
architectural choices of neural network models, specifically their attention
mechanisms, which significantly influence the composition and quality of the
generated images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图形用户界面系统中应用时，实际效用受到视觉定位可靠性的限制，即无法准确将文本引用映射到屏幕上的具体元素，这阻碍了系统执行指针级操作（如点击或拖动）的准确性。

Method: 引入GUI-Spotlight模型，该模型经过图像基础推理训练，能够动态调用多个专用工具，迭代地将焦点缩小到屏幕的相关区域。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro基准测试中，仅使用18.5K训练样本的GUI-Spotlight达到52.8%的准确率，超越了使用9.6M训练样本的V2P-7B（50.6%）和使用1.56M训练样本的GTA-1-7B（50.1%）。

Conclusion: GUI-Spotlight通过迭代焦点缩小方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型在图形用户界面系统中的视觉定位问题，显著提升了定位准确性，且训练效率更高。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have markedly expanded the
competence of graphical user-interface (GUI) systems, propelling them beyond
controlled simulations into complex, real-world environments across diverse
platforms. However, practical usefulness is still bounded by the reliability of
visual grounding, i.e., mapping textual references to exact on-screen elements.
This limitation prevents the system from accurately performing pointer-level
actions such as clicking or dragging. To address it, we introduce GUI-Spotlight
-- a model trained for image-grounded reasoning that dynamically invokes
multiple specialized tools to iteratively narrow its focus to the relevant
region of the screen, thereby substantially improving visual grounding
accuracy. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, GUI-Spotlight trained with only
18.5K training samples achieves 52.8\% accuracy, surpassing V2P-7B (50.6\% with
9.6M training samples) and GTA-1-7B (50.1\% with 1.56M training samples).

Abstract: Post-training quantization for reducing the storage of deep neural network
models has been demonstrated to be an effective way in various tasks. However,
low-bit quantization while maintaining model accuracy is a challenging problem.
In this paper, we present a range estimation method to improve the quantization
performance for post-training quantization. We model the range estimation into
an optimization problem of minimizing quantization errors by layer-wise local
minima. We prove this problem is locally convex and present an efficient search
algorithm to find the optimal solution. We propose the application of the above
search algorithm to the transformed weights space to do further improvement in
practice. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art performance generally on top-1 accuracy for image
classification tasks on the ResNet series models and Inception-v3 model. The
experimental results show that the proposed method has almost no loss of top-1
accuracy in 8-bit and 6-bit settings for image classifications, and the
accuracy of 4-bit quantization is also significantly improved. The code is

Motivation: 解决现有3D资产检索中的两个核心挑战：(i) 忽略空间、语义和风格约束的不一致资产检索；(ii) 缺乏专门为3D资产检索设计的标准化检索范式，现有方法主要依赖通用3D形状表示模型。

Method: 提出灵活的三模态检索机制，支持文本、图像和3D模态的任意组合查询，通过联合建模对象级特征（包括外观）和场景级布局结构来增强空间推理和风格一致性。引入即插即用的等变布局编码器ESSGNN来捕获空间关系和对象外观特征。

Result: 经验评估表明，在各种检索任务中，MetaFind相比基线方法在空间和风格一致性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: MetaFind通过三模态组合检索和等变布局编码，有效解决了3D资产检索中的一致性问题，支持迭代式场景构建，为元宇宙场景生成提供了更可靠的检索解决方案。

Abstract: We present MetaFind, a scene-aware tri-modal compositional retrieval
framework designed to enhance scene generation in the metaverse by retrieving
3D assets from large-scale repositories. MetaFind addresses two core
challenges: (i) inconsistent asset retrieval that overlooks spatial, semantic,
and stylistic constraints, and (ii) the absence of a standardized retrieval
paradigm specifically tailored for 3D asset retrieval, as existing approaches
mainly rely on general-purpose 3D shape representation models. Our key
innovation is a flexible retrieval mechanism that supports arbitrary
combinations of text, image, and 3D modalities as queries, enhancing spatial
reasoning and style consistency by jointly modeling object-level features
(including appearance) and scene-level layout structures. Methodologically,
MetaFind introduces a plug-and-play equivariant layout encoder ESSGNN that
captures spatial relationships and object appearance features, ensuring
retrieved 3D assets are contextually and stylistically coherent with the
existing scene, regardless of coordinate frame transformations. The framework
supports iterative scene construction by continuously adapting retrieval
results to current scene updates. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the
improved spatial and stylistic consistency of MetaFind in various retrieval
tasks compared to baseline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统太阳耀斑预测的二元分类框架忽略了耀斑子类间的序数关系，导致模型难以区分强度相近但位于分类阈值两侧的事件，这是最常见的误分类情况。

Method: 在传统二元交叉熵损失函数中整合耀斑子类的序数信息，作为序数感知的数据驱动正则化方法，对接近预测阈值的错误预测施加更重的惩罚。

Result: 通过将序数权重整合到损失函数中，利用数据的序数特性增强模型学习过程，从而提高整体性能。

Conclusion: 提出的序数感知损失函数能够有效改善太阳耀斑预测模型在分类阈值附近的区分能力，提升预测性能。

Abstract: The prediction of solar flares is typically formulated as a binary
classification task, distinguishing events as either Flare (FL) or No-Flare
(NF) according to a specified threshold (for example, greater than or equal to
C-class, M-class, or X-class). However, this binary framework neglects the
inherent ordinal relationships among the sub-classes contained within each
category (FL and NF). Several studies on solar flare prediction have
empirically shown that the most frequent misclassifications occur near this
prediction threshold. This suggests that the models struggle to differentiate
events that are similar in intensity but fall on opposite sides of the binary
threshold. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a modified loss function
that integrates the ordinal information among the sub-classes of the binarized
flare labels into the conventional binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This
approach serves as an ordinality-aware, data-driven regularization method that
penalizes the incorrect predictions of flare events in close proximity to the
prediction threshold more heavily than those away from the boundary during
model optimization. By incorporating ordinal weighting into the loss function,
we aim to enhance the model's learning process by leveraging the ordinal
characteristics of the data, thereby improving its overall performance.

Motivation: 现有的去摩尔纹深度学习模型需要大量计算资源，难以在边缘设备上部署。直接应用现有量化方法会导致严重的性能下降，主要原因是分布异常值和平滑区域表示弱化。

Method: 1. 异常值感知量化器：使用基于采样的范围估计减少激活异常值，并将少量极端权重保留为FP16格式；2. 频率感知校准策略：在微调过程中强调低中频分量，减轻低比特量化引起的带状伪影。

Result: QuantDemoire在W4A4配置下比现有量化方法性能提升超过4dB，同时大幅减少了参数和计算量。

Conclusion: 该框架为去摩尔纹模型在边缘设备上的高效部署提供了有效解决方案，在保持质量的同时实现了显著的压缩效果。

Abstract: Demoir\'eing aims to remove moir\'e artifacts that often occur in images.
While recent deep learning-based methods have achieved promising results, they
typically require substantial computational resources, limiting their
deployment on edge devices. Model quantization offers a compelling solution.
However, directly applying existing quantization methods to demoir\'eing models
introduces severe performance degradation. The main reasons are distribution
outliers and weakened representations in smooth regions. To address these
issues, we propose QuantDemoire, a post-training quantization framework
tailored to demoir\'eing. It contains two key components. **First}, we
introduce an outlier-aware quantizer to reduce errors from outliers. It uses
sampling-based range estimation to reduce activation outliers, and keeps a few
extreme weights in FP16 with negligible cost. **Second**, we design a
frequency-aware calibration strategy. It emphasizes low- and mid-frequency
components during fine-tuning, which mitigates banding artifacts caused by
low-bit quantization. Extensive experiments validate that our QuantDemoire
achieves large reductions in parameters and computation while maintaining
quality. Meanwhile, it outperforms existing quantization methods by over **4
dB** on W4A4. Code is released at:

TL;DR: TV-LoRA是一种结合扩散生成先验和多正则化约束的低剂量稀疏视角CT重建方法，在ADMM框架下实现高效3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极稀疏视角下CT重建的病态问题和纹理丢失问题，结合生成模型和物理约束来提升重建质量。

Method: 结合扩散生成先验(NCSN++ SDE模型)和各向异性TV、核范数(LoRA)正则化，采用ADMM框架，使用2D切片策略配合FFT加速和并行优化。

Result: 在AAPM-2016、CTHD和LIDC数据集上，TV-LoRA在SSIM、纹理恢复、边缘清晰度和伪影抑制方面均优于基准方法，展现出强鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 扩散模型+TV-LoRA实现了高保真、高效的3D CT重建，在低剂量稀疏采样场景下具有广泛的临床应用前景。

Abstract: This work presents TV-LoRA, a novel method for low-dose sparse-view CT
reconstruction that combines a diffusion generative prior (NCSN++ with SDE
modeling) and multi-regularization constraints, including anisotropic TV and
nuclear norm (LoRA), within an ADMM framework. To address ill-posedness and
texture loss under extremely sparse views, TV-LoRA integrates generative and
physical constraints, and utilizes a 2D slice-based strategy with FFT
acceleration and tensor-parallel optimization for efficient inference.
Experiments on AAPM-2016, CTHD, and LIDC datasets with
$N_{\mathrm{view}}=8,4,2$ show that TV-LoRA consistently surpasses benchmarks
in SSIM, texture recovery, edge clarity, and artifact suppression,
demonstrating strong robustness and generalizability. Ablation studies confirm
the complementary effects of LoRA regularization and diffusion priors, while
the FFT-PCG module provides a speedup. Overall, Diffusion + TV-LoRA achieves
high-fidelity, efficient 3D CT reconstruction and broad clinical applicability
in low-dose, sparse-sampling scenarios.

Motivation: 拓扑映射领域缺乏标准化的评估指标、数据集和协议，现有系统在不同环境和标准下评估，无法进行公平可复现的比较，且感知混淆这一关键挑战未被充分量化。

Method: 1) 将拓扑一致性形式化为拓扑映射的基本属性，证明定位精度可作为高效可解释的替代指标；2) 提出首个数据集模糊度的量化方法；3) 构建具有校准模糊度水平的多样化基准数据集，实现并发布深度学习基线系统。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了拓扑映射评估的空白，提供了标准化框架和工具，为领域内的公平比较和可复现研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Topological mapping offers a compact and robust representation for
navigation, but progress in the field is hindered by the lack of standardized
evaluation metrics, datasets, and protocols. Existing systems are assessed
using different environments and criteria, preventing fair and reproducible
comparisons. Moreover, a key challenge - perceptual aliasing - remains
under-quantified, despite its strong influence on system performance. We
address these gaps by (1) formalizing topological consistency as the
fundamental property of topological maps and showing that localization accuracy
provides an efficient and interpretable surrogate metric, and (2) proposing the
first quantitative measure of dataset ambiguity to enable fair comparisons
across environments. To support this protocol, we curate a diverse benchmark
dataset with calibrated ambiguity levels, implement and release deep-learned
baseline systems, and evaluate them alongside classical methods. Our
experiments and analysis yield new insights into the limitations of current
approaches under perceptual aliasing. All datasets, baselines, and evaluation
tools are fully open-sourced to foster consistent and reproducible research in
topological mapping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决事件相机网格流估计领域的两大挑战：缺乏专门的网格流数据集和事件数据密度变化问题。现有方法在复杂运动模式和动态物体处理方面存在不足。

Method: 1) 创建大规模高分辨率事件网格流数据集HREM；2) 设计轻量级EEMFlow网络，采用编码器-解码器架构；3) 提出置信度诱导细节补全模块CDC用于密集光流估计；4) 开发自适应密度模块ADM处理不同密度事件数据。

Conclusion: 本文提出的HREM数据集、EEMFlow网络和ADM模块有效解决了事件相机网格流估计的关键问题，为事件视觉领域提供了重要的数据集和方法基础。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the problem of event-based meshflow estimation, a
novel task that involves predicting a spatially smooth sparse motion field from
event cameras. To start, we review the state-of-the-art in event-based flow
estimation, highlighting two key areas for further research: i) the lack of
meshflow-specific event datasets and methods, and ii) the underexplored
challenge of event data density. First, we generate a large-scale
High-Resolution Event Meshflow (HREM) dataset, which showcases its superiority
by encompassing the merits of high resolution at 1280x720, handling dynamic
objects and complex motion patterns, and offering both optical flow and
meshflow labels. These aspects have not been fully explored in previous works.
Besides, we propose Efficient Event-based MeshFlow (EEMFlow) network, a
lightweight model featuring a specially crafted encoder-decoder architecture to
facilitate swift and accurate meshflow estimation. Furthermore, we upgrade
EEMFlow network to support dense event optical flow, in which a
Confidence-induced Detail Completion (CDC) module is proposed to preserve sharp
motion boundaries. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show the exceptional
performance and runtime efficiency (30x faster) of our EEMFlow model compared
to the recent state-of-the-art flow method. As an extension, we expand HREM
into HREM+, a multi-density event dataset contributing to a thorough study of
the robustness of existing methods across data with varying densities, and
propose an Adaptive Density Module (ADM) to adjust the density of input event
data to a more optimal range, enhancing the model's generalization ability. We
empirically demonstrate that ADM helps to significantly improve the performance
of EEMFlow and EEMFlow+ by 8% and 10%, respectively. Code and dataset are
released at https://github.com/boomluo02/EEMFlowPlus.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的6D物体姿态估计方法，通过预训练编码器和联合学习策略加速训练收敛，并引入采样指导机制消除额外评估网络的需求，在多个基准测试中达到最先进精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的6D姿态估计方法存在训练收敛慢、需要端到端学习编码器、以及需要额外网络来过滤低质量姿态候选的问题。

Method: 1) 预训练编码器并使用直接姿态回归头，联合学习回归头和去噪扩散头；2) 提出基于时间相关分数缩放的采样指导机制，在早期保持对称物体的多模态特性，在后期确保高质量姿态生成。

Result: 在REAL275、HouseCat6D和ROPE等多个基准测试中，即使使用单姿态推理也能达到最先进的精度，同时在训练和推理方面更加高效。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，通过预训练策略和采样指导机制解决了现有方法的局限性，在6D物体姿态估计任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Latest diffusion models have shown promising results in category-level 6D
object pose estimation by modeling the conditional pose distribution with depth
image input. The existing methods, however, suffer from slow convergence during
training, learning its encoder with the diffusion denoising network in
end-to-end fashion, and require an additional network that evaluates sampled
pose hypotheses to filter out low-quality pose candidates. In this paper, we
propose a novel pipeline that tackles these limitations by two key components.
First, the proposed method pretrains the encoder with the direct pose
regression head, and jointly learns the networks via the regression head and
the denoising diffusion head, significantly accelerating training convergence
while achieving higher accuracy. Second, sampling guidance via time-dependent
score scaling is proposed s.t. the exploration-exploitation trade-off is
effectively taken, eliminating the need for the additional evaluation network.
The sampling guidance maintains multi-modal characteristics of symmetric
objects at early denoising steps while ensuring high-quality pose generation at
final steps. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks including REAL275,
HouseCat6D, and ROPE, demonstrate that the proposed method, simple yet
effective, achieves state-of-the-art accuracies even with single-pose
inference, while being more efficient in both training and inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多教师模型在蒸馏过程中产生的推理轨迹存在概念漂移问题，导致推理分布不可预测地演变，并将偏见传递给学生模型，最终损害其性能。

Method: 建立概念漂移与知识蒸馏的理论联系，将多教师MLLM的非平稳推理动态建模为多流推理轨迹的下一个标记预测。引入"学习、比较、批判"范式，最终实现自主偏好优化。

Result: 实验证明该方法在知识蒸馏中具有优越的一致性、鲁棒性和泛化性能。同时贡献了包含170,982条蒸馏推理轨迹的大规模数据集CXR-MAX。

Conclusion: 通过概念对齐和自主偏好优化，可以产生鲁棒、一致且可泛化的模型，有效解决多教师蒸馏中的概念漂移问题。

Abstract: This paper identifies a critical yet underexplored challenge in distilling
from multimodal large language models (MLLMs): the reasoning trajectories
generated by multiple drifting teachers exhibit concept drift, whereby their
reasoning distributions evolve unpredictably and transmit biases to the student
model, ultimately compromising its performance. To tackle this issue, we
pioneer a theoretical connection between concept drift and knowledge
distillation, casting the non-stationary reasoning dynamics from multiple MLLM
teachers as next-token prediction of multi-stream reasoning trajectories.Guided
by concept drift, we introduce the "learn, compare, critique" paradigm,
culminating in autonomous preference optimization (APO). Under the active
guidance of the teachers, the student model first learns and self-distils
preferred thinking by comparing multiple teachers. It then engages in critical
reflection over the drifting inference from teachers, performing concept
alignment through APO, ultimately yielding a robust, consistent, and
generalizable model.Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance
of consistency, robustness and generalization within knowledge distillation.
Besides, we also contributed a large-scale dataset, CXR-MAX (Multi-teachers
Alignment X-rays), comprising 170,982 distilled reasoning trajectories derived
from publicly accessible MLLMs based on MIMIC-CXR. Our code and data are public

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统建筑安全检查方法效率低下，需要处理大量信息。现有应用存在响应不相关、模态输入受限和幻觉问题，LLM应用受限于训练数据和实时适应性。

Method: 开发SiteShield多模态LVLM检索增强生成框架，整合视觉和音频输入，用于自动化安全检查报告生成。

Result: 在真实数据上，SiteShield的F1分数为0.82，汉明损失为0.04，精确率为0.76，召回率为0.96，表现优于无RAG的单模态LLM。

Conclusion: SiteShield为增强信息检索和提高安全报告生成效率提供了新途径。

Abstract: Conventional construction safety inspection methods are often inefficient as
they require navigating through large volume of information. Recent advances in
large vision-language models (LVLMs) provide opportunities to automate safety
inspections through enhanced visual and linguistic understanding. However,
existing applications face limitations including irrelevant or unspecific
responses, restricted modal inputs and hallucinations. Utilisation of Large
Language Models (LLMs) for this purpose is constrained by availability of
training data and frequently lack real-time adaptability. This study introduces
SiteShield, a multi-modal LVLM-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
framework for automating construction safety inspection reports by integrating
visual and audio inputs. Using real-world data, SiteShield outperformed
unimodal LLMs without RAG with an F1 score of 0.82, hamming loss of 0.04,
precision of 0.76, and recall of 0.96. The findings indicate that SiteShield
offers a novel pathway to enhance information retrieval and efficiency in
generating safety reports.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BLADE是一个无需先验偏置知识或偏置冲突样本的生成式去偏框架，通过跨偏置域图像翻译和自适应精炼来缓解神经网络中的隐式偏置问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络容易学习训练数据中的隐式偏置和伪相关，现有方法通常需要偏置先验知识或偏置冲突样本，这在现实场景中往往不切实际。

Method: 首先训练生成模型在偏置域间翻译图像并保留任务相关特征，然后基于图像对偏置的敏感性自适应精炼图像与其合成对应物，通过对齐任务相关特征但偏置不同的图像对来鼓励鲁棒表示。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著优于最先进方法，在损坏CIFAR-10数据集的最差组设置下比最接近的基线方法绝对提升约18%。

Conclusion: BLADE为无需显式监督开发更鲁棒的深度学习模型建立了新的偏置缓解基准。

Abstract: Neural networks have revolutionized numerous fields, yet they remain
vulnerable to a critical flaw: the tendency to learn implicit biases, spurious
correlations between certain attributes and target labels in training data.
These biases are often more prevalent and easier to learn, causing models to
rely on superficial patterns rather than task-relevant features necessary for
generalization. Existing methods typically rely on strong assumptions, such as
prior knowledge of these biases or access to bias-conflicting samples, i.e.,
samples that contradict spurious correlations and counterbalance bias-aligned
samples, samples that conform to these spurious correlations. However, such
assumptions are often impractical in real-world settings. We propose BLADE
({B}ias-{L}inked {A}daptive {DE}biasing), a generative debiasing framework that
requires no prior knowledge of bias or bias-conflicting samples. BLADE first
trains a generative model to translate images across bias domains while
preserving task-relevant features. Then, it adaptively refines each image with
its synthetic counterpart based on the image's susceptibility to bias. To
encourage robust representations, BLADE aligns an image with its
bias-translated synthetic counterpart that shares task-relevant features but
differs in bias, while misaligning it with samples sharing the same bias. We
evaluate BLADE on multiple benchmark datasets and show that it significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Notably, it exceeds the closest baseline
by an absolute margin of around 18% on the corrupted CIFAR-10 dataset under the
worst group setting, establishing a new benchmark in bias mitigation and
demonstrating its potential for developing more robust deep learning models
without explicit supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在关键安全应用中缺乏可解释性和可信度，现有模型容易利用不可靠特征，概念瓶颈模型需要昂贵概念标注且缺乏空间定位。

Method: 将概念引导图像分割集成到注意力多实例学习框架中，每个分割区域作为实例，模型学习跨区域聚合证据，推理与高级概念对齐的语义区域。

Result: 在涉及虚假相关性、输入损坏和大规模基准测试的设置中实现鲁棒性能，同时提供透明的概念级解释。

Conclusion: SEG-MIL-CBM通过语义区域推理实现了无需概念标注的鲁棒性能和空间定位的概念级解释，提高了模型的可解释性和可信度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision;
however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and
trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is
crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not
only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading
features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their
explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by
reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly
concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which
regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that
integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple
instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an
instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning
over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our
model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and
produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring
annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance
across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies
between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade
visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent,
concept-level explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在图像和视频合成中具有最先进的保真度，但其迭代采样过程由于每个时间步都需要昂贵的变换器前向传播而成为主要瓶颈。现有特征缓存方法对所有特征维度采用统一策略，忽略了它们异质的动态行为。

Method: 将隐藏特征演化建模为跨维度的ODE混合，引入HyCa框架应用维度级缓存策略，基于混合ODE求解器思想实现智能缓存。

Result: 在FLUX上实现5.55倍加速，在HunyuanVideo上实现5.56倍加速，在Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit上实现6.24倍加速，且无需重新训练。

Conclusion: HyCa通过维度级缓存策略有效解决了扩散变换器采样瓶颈，在多个领域和模型上实现了显著的近无损加速效果。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers offer state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video
synthesis, but their iterative sampling process remains a major bottleneck due
to the high cost of transformer forward passes at each timestep. To mitigate
this, feature caching has emerged as a training-free acceleration technique
that reuses or forecasts hidden representations. However, existing methods
often apply a uniform caching strategy across all feature dimensions, ignoring
their heterogeneous dynamic behaviors. Therefore, we adopt a new perspective by
modeling hidden feature evolution as a mixture of ODEs across dimensions, and
introduce HyCa, a Hybrid ODE solver inspired caching framework that applies
dimension-wise caching strategies. HyCa achieves near-lossless acceleration
across diverse domains and models, including 5.55 times speedup on FLUX, 5.56
times speedup on HunyuanVideo, 6.24 times speedup on Qwen-Image and
Qwen-Image-Edit without retraining.

Conclusion: 该框架在不到三次迭代中高效实现结果，为能够更好反映不断变化的现实世界的T2I系统铺平了道路。

Abstract: While text-to-image (T2I) models can synthesize high-quality images, their
performance degrades significantly when prompted with novel or
out-of-distribution (OOD) entities due to inherent knowledge cutoffs. We
introduce World-To-Image, a novel framework that bridges this gap by empowering
T2I generation with agent-driven world knowledge. We design an agent that
dynamically searches the web to retrieve images for concepts unknown to the
base model. This information is then used to perform multimodal prompt
optimization, steering powerful generative backbones toward an accurate
synthesis. Critically, our evaluation goes beyond traditional metrics,
utilizing modern assessments like LLMGrader and ImageReward to measure true
semantic fidelity. Our experiments show that World-To-Image substantially
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic alignment and visual
aesthetics, achieving +8.1% improvement in accuracy-to-prompt on our curated
NICE benchmark. Our framework achieves these results with high efficiency in
less than three iterations, paving the way for T2I systems that can better
reflect the ever-changing real world. Our demo code is available

TL;DR: 提出MASC框架，通过构建层次化语义树来优化自回归图像生成模型的词汇表结构，显著提升训练效率和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归模型使用扁平的视觉词汇表，忽视了token嵌入空间的内在结构，导致预测任务复杂、训练效率低下且生成质量受限。

Method: MASC框架使用几何感知距离度量和密度驱动的凝聚构建方法，直接从codebook的内在结构中构建层次化语义树，将高维预测任务转化为结构化层次任务。

Result: 训练速度提升最高达57%，LlamaGen-XL的FID从2.87降至2.58，生成质量显著改善。

Conclusion: MASC证明了结构化预测空间对于可扩展生成建模的重要性，使现有AR框架能够与最先进方法竞争。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have shown great promise in image generation, yet
they face a fundamental inefficiency stemming from their core component: a
vast, unstructured vocabulary of visual tokens. This conventional approach
treats tokens as a flat vocabulary, disregarding the intrinsic structure of the
token embedding space where proximity often correlates with semantic
similarity. This oversight results in a highly complex prediction task, which
hinders training efficiency and limits final generation quality. To resolve
this, we propose Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC), a principled
framework that constructs a hierarchical semantic tree directly from the
codebook's intrinsic structure. MASC employs a novel geometry-aware distance
metric and a density-driven agglomerative construction to model the underlying
manifold of the token embeddings. By transforming the flat, high-dimensional
prediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a
beneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem
for the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive
experiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57%
and significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL
from 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly
competitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the
prediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable
generative modeling.

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI-generated imagery has blurred the boundary between
real and synthetic content, raising critical concerns for digital integrity.
Vision-language models (VLMs) offer interpretability through explanations but
often fail to detect subtle artifacts in high-quality synthetic images. We
propose ZoomIn, a two-stage forensic framework that improves both accuracy and
interpretability. Mimicking human visual inspection, ZoomIn first scans an
image to locate suspicious regions and then performs a focused analysis on
these zoomed-in areas to deliver a grounded verdict. To support training, we
introduce MagniFake, a dataset of 20,000 real and high-quality synthetic images
annotated with bounding boxes and forensic explanations, generated through an
automated VLM-based pipeline. Our method achieves 96.39% accuracy with robust
generalization, while providing human-understandable explanations grounded in

introduces a simple, end-to-end trainable algorithm that is implementable in a
few lines of Python code. The approach is shown to work with very little
training data and training time, while achieving accurate results in some
settings. An example application to stereo vision was trained from 74 images on
a 19x15 input window. With just a dozen lines of Python code this algorithm
excels in brevity and may serve as a good start in related scenarios with
limitations to training data, training time or code complexity.

*Amin Ahmadi Kasani,Hedieh Sajedi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ArConv的新型卷积层，通过重新设计和优化卷积层来创建轻量级通用模型，该模型仅含130万参数，在RfMiD数据集上表现优于MobileNetV2，准确率达到0.9328。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高深度神经网络模型的可访问性，特别是在移动设备上应用，以促进眼疾早期诊断的普及。现有方法计算复杂，限制了在资源受限设备上的部署。

Method: 在最基础的卷积层层面进行重新设计和优化，开发了新型ArConv卷积层，构建了轻量级通用模型。

Result: 最终模型仅含130万参数，在RfMiD数据集测试集上准确率达到0.9328，优于拥有220万参数的MobileNetV2模型（准确率0.9266）。

Conclusion: 通过优化卷积层设计，成功开发了适用于移动设备的轻量级模型，在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，提高了神经网络在眼疾诊断等医疗应用中的可访问性。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks are continually evolving, with some efforts
aimed at improving accuracy, others at increasing speed, and some at enhancing
accessibility. Improving accessibility broadens the application of neural
networks across a wider range of tasks, including the detection of eye
diseases. Early diagnosis of eye diseases and consulting an ophthalmologist can
prevent many vision disorders. Given the importance of this issue, various
datasets have been collected from the cornea to facilitate the process of
making neural network models. However, most of the methods introduced in the
past are computationally complex. In this study, we tried to increase the
accessibility of deep neural network models. We did this at the most
fundamental level, specifically by redesigning and optimizing the convolutional
layers. By doing so, we created a new general model that incorporates our novel
convolutional layer named ArConv layers. Thanks to the efficient performance of
this new layer, the model has suitable complexity for use in mobile phones and
can perform the task of diagnosing the presence of disease with high accuracy.
The final model we present contains only 1.3 million parameters. In comparison
to the MobileNetV2 model, which has 2.2 million parameters, our model
demonstrated better accuracy when trained and evaluated on the RfMiD dataset
under identical conditions, achieving an accuracy of 0.9328 versus 0.9266 on
the RfMiD test set.

TL;DR: Kaleido是一个用于照片级真实感神经渲染的生成模型家族，将3D渲染视为视频的特殊子领域，通过序列到序列的图像合成实现统一的物体和场景级渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D渲染方法依赖显式3D表示和稀缺的相机标注数据，Kaleido旨在通过统一3D和视频建模，利用大规模视频数据进行预训练，减少对3D数据集的依赖。

Method: 采用序列到序列的生成神经渲染，使用掩码自回归框架和仅解码器的整流流变换器，能够基于任意数量的参考视图生成任意数量的6自由度目标视图。

Result: 在多个视图合成基准测试中达到新的最先进水平，在少视图设置下显著优于其他生成方法，在多视图设置下首次达到逐场景优化方法的质量。

Conclusion: Kaleido证明了将3D视为视频子领域的有效性，通过统一框架和视频预训练实现了高质量的神经渲染，减少了对3D标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a family of generative models designed for
photorealistic, unified object- and scene-level neural rendering. Kaleido
operates on the principle that 3D can be regarded as a specialised sub-domain
of video, expressed purely as a sequence-to-sequence image synthesis task.
Through a systemic study of scaling sequence-to-sequence generative neural
rendering, we introduce key architectural innovations that enable our model to:
i) perform generative view synthesis without explicit 3D representations; ii)
generate any number of 6-DoF target views conditioned on any number of
reference views via a masked autoregressive framework; and iii) seamlessly
unify 3D and video modelling within a single decoder-only rectified flow
transformer. Within this unified framework, Kaleido leverages large-scale video
data for pre-training, which significantly improves spatial consistency and
reduces reliance on scarce, camera-labelled 3D datasets -- all without any
architectural modifications. Kaleido sets a new state-of-the-art on a range of
view synthesis benchmarks. Its zero-shot performance substantially outperforms
other generative methods in few-view settings, and, for the first time, matches
the quality of per-scene optimisation methods in many-view settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CoSSeg-TTA框架，基于nnU-Netv2，结合半监督均值教师方案和领域适应模块，用于Gd-EOB-DTPA增强肝胆期MRI的肝脏分割，在低标注条件下实现优异的跨领域泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对比增强MRI肝脏分割面临的挑战：标注数据有限、增强协议异质性、跨扫描仪和机构的领域偏移问题。传统图像翻译方法存在结构失真、训练不稳定等局限。

Method: 1. 基于nnU-Netv2构建紧凑分割框架；2. 采用半监督均值教师方案利用未标注数据；3. 集成领域适应模块（随机直方图风格外观转换和可训练对比感知网络）；4. 使用持续测试时适应策略提升推理鲁棒性。

Result: 在广泛实验中，框架始终优于nnU-Netv2基线，获得更高的Dice分数和Hausdorff距离，在低标注条件下对未见领域表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: CoSSeg-TTA框架有效解决了单模态MRI肝脏分割中的领域泛化问题，为临床诊断和治疗规划提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation from contrast-enhanced MRI is essential for
diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, it remains
challenging due to limited annotated data, heterogeneous enhancement protocols,
and significant domain shifts across scanners and institutions. Traditional
image-to-image translation frameworks have made great progress in domain
generalization, but their application is not straightforward. For example,
Pix2Pix requires image registration, and cycle-GAN cannot be integrated
seamlessly into segmentation pipelines. Meanwhile, these methods are originally
used to deal with cross-modality scenarios, and often introduce structural
distortions and suffer from unstable training, which may pose drawbacks in our
single-modality scenario. To address these challenges, we propose CoSSeg-TTA, a
compact segmentation framework for the GED4 (Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced hepatobiliary
phase MRI) modality built upon nnU-Netv2 and enhanced with a semi-supervised
mean teacher scheme to exploit large amounts of unlabeled volumes. A domain
adaptation module, incorporating a randomized histogram-based style appearance
transfer function and a trainable contrast-aware network, enriches domain
diversity and mitigates cross-center variability. Furthermore, a continual
test-time adaptation strategy is employed to improve robustness during
inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently
outperforms the nnU-Netv2 baseline, achieving superior Dice score and Hausdorff
Distance while exhibiting strong generalization to unseen domains under
low-annotation conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念解释的对抗补丁防御方法，无需先验知识即可通过抑制关键概念激活向量来中和补丁影响，在Imagenette数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗补丁防御方法通常需要预先知道补丁大小或位置，限制了实际应用。需要开发不依赖先验知识的补丁不可知防御方法。

Method: 利用基于概念的解释来识别和抑制最具影响力的概念激活向量，从而在不显式检测的情况下中和补丁效应。

Result: 在Imagenette数据集上使用ResNet-50评估，相比最先进的PatchCleanser方法获得了更高的鲁棒性和干净准确率，在不同补丁大小和位置下保持强性能。

Conclusion: 将可解释性与鲁棒性结合具有前景，概念驱动的防御策略是保护机器学习模型免受对抗补丁攻击的可扩展方法。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a practical threat to deep learning models by
forcing targeted misclassifications through localized perturbations, often
realized in the physical world. Existing defenses typically assume prior
knowledge of patch size or location, limiting their applicability. In this
work, we propose a patch-agnostic defense that leverages concept-based
explanations to identify and suppress the most influential concept activation
vectors, thereby neutralizing patch effects without explicit detection.
Evaluated on Imagenette with a ResNet-50, our method achieves higher robust and
clean accuracy than the state-of-the-art PatchCleanser, while maintaining
strong performance across varying patch sizes and locations. Our results
highlight the promise of combining interpretability with robustness and suggest
concept-driven defenses as a scalable strategy for securing machine learning
models against adversarial patch attacks.

TL;DR: 提出Adapt-STformer方法，通过循环可变形Transformer编码器实现灵活的序列长度支持、快速推理和低内存使用，在保持性能的同时提升效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的Seq-VPR方法注重性能但牺牲了灵活性和效率，无法同时满足可变序列长度、快速推理和低内存使用的实际需求

Method: 使用循环可变形Transformer编码器（Recurrent-DTE），通过迭代循环机制融合多帧序列信息，支持可变序列长度

Result: 在Nordland、Oxford和NuScenes数据集上，召回率提升最高17%，序列提取时间减少36%，内存使用降低35%

Conclusion: Adapt-STformer在保持高性能的同时，显著提升了Seq-VPR方法的灵活性和效率，满足实时应用需求

Abstract: Sequential Visual Place Recognition (Seq-VPR) leverages transformers to
capture spatio-temporal features effectively; however, existing approaches
prioritize performance at the expense of flexibility and efficiency. In
practice, a transformer-based Seq-VPR model should be flexible to the number of
frames per sequence (seq-length), deliver fast inference, and have low memory
usage to meet real-time constraints. To our knowledge, no existing
transformer-based Seq-VPR method achieves both flexibility and efficiency. To
address this gap, we propose Adapt-STformer, a Seq-VPR method built around our
novel Recurrent Deformable Transformer Encoder (Recurrent-DTE), which uses an
iterative recurrent mechanism to fuse information from multiple sequential
frames. This design naturally supports variable seq-lengths, fast inference,
and low memory usage. Experiments on the Nordland, Oxford, and NuScenes
datasets show that Adapt-STformer boosts recall by up to 17% while reducing
sequence extraction time by 36% and lowering memory usage by 35% compared to
the second-best baseline.

TL;DR: ChronoEdit将图像编辑重新定义为视频生成问题，通过利用预训练视频生成模型的时间一致性来确保物理一致性，并引入时间推理阶段来想象合理的编辑轨迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型生成模型在图像编辑和上下文图像生成方面取得进展，但在确保物理一致性方面存在关键差距，这对于世界模拟相关任务尤为重要。

Method: 1) 将输入和编辑图像视为视频的首尾帧，利用预训练视频生成模型捕获对象外观和隐式物理运动；2) 引入时间推理阶段，在推理时联合去噪目标帧和推理令牌来想象物理可行的编辑轨迹。

Result: 在PBench-Edit基准测试中，ChronoEdit在视觉保真度和物理合理性方面均超越了现有最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ChronoEdit通过将图像编辑重新定义为视频生成问题，有效解决了物理一致性问题，为世界模拟相关任务提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have significantly advanced image
editing and in-context image generation, yet a critical gap remains in ensuring
physical consistency, where edited objects must remain coherent. This
capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this
paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a
video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images
as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large
pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but
also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal
consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that
explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target
frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing
trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable
transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to
avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate
ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for
contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit
surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical
plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit
will be released on the project page:

TL;DR: CARE-PD是最大的公开帕金森病3D步态数据集，包含9个队列的多中心数据，支持临床评分预测和无监督运动任务，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 帕金森病客观步态评估缺乏大规模、多样化且临床标注的运动数据集，限制了相关研究的发展。

Method: 将RGB视频或运动捕捉数据通过统一预处理流程转换为匿名SMPL网格，支持监督临床评分预测和无监督运动预训练任务。

Result: 在CARE-PD上预训练可将MPJPE从60.8mm降至7.5mm，帕金森病严重程度宏F1分数提升17个百分点，运动编码器始终优于手工特征。

Conclusion: CARE-PD数据集及其基准代码已发布，证明了临床策划的多样化训练数据在提升帕金森病步态分析模型性能方面的重要价值。

Abstract: Objective gait assessment in Parkinson's Disease (PD) is limited by the
absence of large, diverse, and clinically annotated motion datasets. We
introduce CARE-PD, the largest publicly available archive of 3D mesh gait data
for PD, and the first multi-site collection spanning 9 cohorts from 8 clinical
centers. All recordings (RGB video or motion capture) are converted into
anonymized SMPL meshes via a harmonized preprocessing pipeline. CARE-PD
supports two key benchmarks: supervised clinical score prediction (estimating
Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, UPDRS, gait scores) and unsupervised
motion pretext tasks (2D-to-3D keypoint lifting and full-body 3D
reconstruction). Clinical prediction is evaluated under four generalization
protocols: within-dataset, cross-dataset, leave-one-dataset-out, and
multi-dataset in-domain adaptation. To assess clinical relevance, we compare
state-of-the-art motion encoders with a traditional gait-feature baseline,
finding that encoders consistently outperform handcrafted features. Pretraining
on CARE-PD reduces MPJPE (from 60.8mm to 7.5mm) and boosts PD severity macro-F1
by 17 percentage points, underscoring the value of clinically curated, diverse
training data. CARE-PD and all benchmark code are released for non-commercial

TL;DR: GenAR是一个多尺度自回归框架，通过从粗到细的方式预测H&E染色图像中的基因表达，将基因聚类为层次组以捕获跨基因依赖关系，并将表达建模为无码本的离散标记生成，直接预测原始计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间转录组学成本高昂，而H&E染色图像广泛可用。现有计算方法存在两个问题：(i)独立预测每个基因，忽略了共表达结构；(ii)将任务视为连续回归，但表达是离散计数，导致生物学上不合理的输出。

Method: 1. 将基因聚类为层次组以暴露跨基因依赖关系；2. 将表达建模为无码本的离散标记生成，直接预测原始计数；3. 在解码时融合组织学和空间嵌入；4. 采用从粗到细的自回归框架。

Result: 在四个不同组织类型的空间转录组数据集上的广泛实验结果表明，GenAR实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: GenAR为精准医学和成本效益高的分子分析提供了潜在应用价值，其离散公式避免了log诱导的偏差，从粗到细的分解与原则性的条件分解相一致。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) offers spatially resolved gene expression but
remains costly. Predicting expression directly from widely available
Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images presents a cost-effective
alternative. However, most computational approaches (i) predict each gene
independently, overlooking co-expression structure, and (ii) cast the task as
continuous regression despite expression being discrete counts. This mismatch
can yield biologically implausible outputs and complicate downstream analyses.
We introduce GenAR, a multi-scale autoregressive framework that refines
predictions from coarse to fine. GenAR clusters genes into hierarchical groups
to expose cross-gene dependencies, models expression as codebook-free discrete
token generation to directly predict raw counts, and conditions decoding on
fused histological and spatial embeddings. From an information-theoretic
perspective, the discrete formulation avoids log-induced biases and the
coarse-to-fine factorization aligns with a principled conditional
decomposition. Extensive experimental results on four Spatial Transcriptomics
datasets across different tissue types demonstrate that GenAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, offering potential implications for precision
medicine and cost-effective molecular profiling. Code is publicly available at

Motivation: 模仿学习训练的端到端驾驶策略缺乏恢复数据，小错误会累积导致失败。现有方法使用神经渲染或游戏引擎生成数字孪生，但成本高昂且速度慢。作者认为驾驶规划不需要照片级真实感，而是需要语义保真度和可扩展性。

Method: 提出3D栅格化技术，用轻量级栅格化标注基元替代昂贵渲染，支持反事实恢复机动和跨智能体视图合成。引入栅格到真实特征空间对齐技术来弥合仿真与现实的差距。

Result: RAP方法在NAVSIM v1/v2、Waymo开放数据集视觉端到端驾驶和Bench2Drive四个主要基准测试中排名第一，实现了最先进的闭环鲁棒性和长尾泛化能力。

Conclusion: 轻量级栅格化结合特征对齐足以扩展端到端训练，为照片级渲染提供了实用的替代方案。

Abstract: Imitation learning for end-to-end driving trains policies only on expert
demonstrations. Once deployed in a closed loop, such policies lack recovery
data: small mistakes cannot be corrected and quickly compound into failures. A
promising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories
beyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via
neural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and
costly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that
photorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is
semantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics,
not textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which
replaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated
primitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers
and cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively
to real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment
that bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization
Augmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning.
RAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail
generalization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo
Open Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive. Our results show that
lightweight rasterization with feature alignment suffices to scale E2E
training, offering a practical alternative to photorealistic rendering. Project

Motivation: 在自动驾驶和人机交互中，真实场景常缺乏足够的观测数据（如盲区突然出现的行人），现有方法难以准确预测瞬时轨迹，增加了交通事故风险。

Method: 使用两个序列连接的扩散模型：反向预测模型生成未观测历史轨迹，前向预测模型预测未来轨迹；引入双头参数化机制估计不确定性，设计时间自适应噪声模块动态调节噪声尺度。

Conclusion: Diffusion^2框架有效解决了瞬时轨迹预测问题，通过生成历史轨迹和不确定性处理提升了预测准确性，对交通安全有重要意义。

Abstract: Accurate pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for ensuring safety and
efficiency in autonomous driving and human-robot interaction scenarios. Earlier
studies primarily utilized sufficient observational data to predict future
trajectories. However, in real-world scenarios, such as pedestrians suddenly
emerging from blind spots, sufficient observational data is often unavailable
(i.e. momentary trajectory), making accurate prediction challenging and
increasing the risk of traffic accidents. Therefore, advancing research on
pedestrian trajectory prediction under extreme scenarios is critical for
enhancing traffic safety. In this work, we propose a novel framework termed
Diffusion^2, tailored for momentary trajectory prediction. Diffusion^2 consists
of two sequentially connected diffusion models: one for backward prediction,
which generates unobserved historical trajectories, and the other for forward
prediction, which forecasts future trajectories. Given that the generated
unobserved historical trajectories may introduce additional noise, we propose a
dual-head parameterization mechanism to estimate their aleatoric uncertainty
and design a temporally adaptive noise module that dynamically modulates the
noise scale in the forward diffusion process. Empirically, Diffusion^2 sets a
new state-of-the-art in momentary trajectory prediction on ETH/UCY and Stanford
Drone datasets.

Abstract: World models that support controllable

  for robotics, enabling scalable training data, repro ducible evaluation, and
flexible task design. While
  recent text-to-video models generate realistic dynam ics, they are
constrained to 2D views and offer limited

generates 4D scenes with
  multi-view consistency and object-level controls. From
  natural language instructions, MorphoSim produces
  dynamic environments where objects can be directed,
  recolored, or removed, and scenes can be observed
  from arbitrary viewpoints. The framework integrates
  trajectory-guided generation with feature field dis tillation, allowing edits
to be applied interactively
  without full re-generation. Experiments show that Mor phoSim maintains high
scene fidelity while enabling
  controllability and editability. The code is available

Motivation: 尽管VLM在多种视觉任务上表现出色，但作者质疑其基本计数能力，特别是组合计数能力。

Method: 采用简约设置，仅使用基本几何形状及其组合，严格控制变量，系统研究颜色、大小和提示优化等因素的影响。

Result: 实验结果显示VLM在单一形状类型计数可靠，但在组合形状计数时表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前VLM存在组合计数的基本经验限制，这为未来研究指明了重要方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become a central focus of today's AI
community, owing to their impressive abilities gained from training on
large-scale vision-language data from the Web. These models have demonstrated
strong performance across diverse tasks, including image understanding, video
understanding, complex visual reasoning, and embodied AI. Despite these
noteworthy successes, a fundamental question remains: Can VLMs count objects
correctly? In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective benchmark,
VLMCountBench, designed under a minimalist setting with only basic geometric
shapes (e.g., triangles, circles) and their compositions, focusing exclusively
on counting tasks without interference from other factors. We adopt strict
independent variable control and systematically study the effects of simple
properties such as color, size, and prompt refinement in a controlled ablation.
Our empirical results reveal that while VLMs can count reliably when only one
shape type is present, they exhibit substantial failures when multiple shape
types are combined (i.e., compositional counting). This highlights a
fundamental empirical limitation of current VLMs and motivates important
directions for future research.

Motivation: 现有盲人脸恢复方法在集成生成先验时往往面临视觉质量与身份保真度之间的权衡，导致要么身份失真，要么降质去除不理想。

Abstract: Blind face restoration (BFR) has attracted increasing attention with the rise
of generative methods. Most existing approaches integrate generative priors
into the restoration pro- cess, aiming to jointly address facial detail
generation and identity preservation. However, these methods often suffer from
a trade-off between visual quality and identity fidelity, leading to either
identity distortion or suboptimal degradation removal. In this paper, we
present CodeFormer++, a novel framework that maximizes the utility of
generative priors for high-quality face restoration while preserving identity.
We decompose BFR into three sub-tasks: (i) identity- preserving face
restoration, (ii) high-quality face generation, and (iii) dynamic fusion of
identity features with realistic texture details. Our method makes three key
contributions: (1) a learning-based deformable face registration module that
semantically aligns generated and restored faces; (2) a texture guided
restoration network to dynamically extract and transfer the texture of
generated face to boost the quality of identity-preserving restored face; and
(3) the integration of deep metric learning for BFR with the generation of
informative positive and hard negative samples to better fuse identity-
preserving and generative features. Extensive experiments on real-world and
synthetic datasets demonstrate that, the pro- posed CodeFormer++ achieves
superior performance in terms of both visual fidelity and identity consistency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出A.I.R.方法解决VideoQA中的帧选择问题，通过自适应迭代推理选择关键帧，平衡计算成本与准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有帧选择方法面临两难：轻量级相似度模型无法处理复杂查询，而使用VLM深度分析则计算成本过高

Method: 使用强大VLM对复杂查询进行深度语义分析，在低成本迭代循环中仅处理少量高潜力帧

Result: 在多个VideoQA基准测试中优于现有帧选择方法，显著提升基础VLM性能，计算效率大幅提高

Conclusion: A.I.R.方法有效解决了帧选择中的准确性与效率权衡问题，为VideoQA提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Effectively applying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to Video Question
Answering (VideoQA) hinges on selecting a concise yet comprehensive set of
frames, as processing entire videos is computationally infeasible. However,
current frame selection methods face a critical trade-off: approaches relying
on lightweight similarity models, such as CLIP, often fail to capture the
nuances of complex queries, resulting in inaccurate similarity scores that
cannot reflect the authentic query-frame relevance, which further undermines
frame selection. Meanwhile, methods that leverage a VLM for deeper analysis
achieve higher accuracy but incur prohibitive computational costs. To address
these limitations, we propose A.I.R., a training-free approach for Adaptive,
Iterative, and Reasoning-based frame selection. We leverage a powerful VLM to
perform deep, semantic analysis on complex queries, and this analysis is
deployed within a cost-effective iterative loop that processes only a small
batch of the most high-potential frames at a time. Extensive experiments on
various VideoQA benchmarks demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing
frame selection methods, significantly boosts the performance of the foundation
VLM, and achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency over other
VLM-based techniques.

*Qiyuan He,Yicong Li,Haotian Ye,Jinghao Wang,Xinyao Liao,Pheng-Ann Heng,Stefano Ermon,James Zou,Angela Yao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: reAR是一种简单的训练策略，通过引入token-wise正则化目标来解决自回归视觉生成中的生成器-分词器不一致问题，无需改变分词器、生成顺序或推理流程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归生成性能落后于扩散模型，主要瓶颈在于生成器与分词器的不一致性——AR生成的token可能无法被分词器良好解码。

Method: 提出reAR训练策略：在预测下一个token时，因果变换器同时训练恢复当前token的视觉嵌入，并在噪声上下文中预测目标token的嵌入。

Result: 在ImageNet上，gFID从3.02降至1.86，IS提升至316.9；应用于先进分词器时，仅用177M参数就达到gFID 1.42，匹配675M扩散模型的性能。

Conclusion: reAR通过简单的正则化策略有效解决了视觉自回归生成中的核心瓶颈，显著提升了性能，证明了生成器-分词器一致性的重要性。

Abstract: Visual autoregressive (AR) generation offers a promising path toward unifying
vision and language models, yet its performance remains suboptimal against
diffusion models. Prior work often attributes this gap to tokenizer limitations
and rasterization ordering. In this work, we identify a core bottleneck from
the perspective of generator-tokenizer inconsistency, i.e., the AR-generated
tokens may not be well-decoded by the tokenizer. To address this, we propose
reAR, a simple training strategy introducing a token-wise regularization
objective: when predicting the next token, the causal transformer is also
trained to recover the visual embedding of the current token and predict the
embedding of the target token under a noisy context. It requires no changes to
the tokenizer, generation order, inference pipeline, or external models.
Despite its simplicity, reAR substantially improves performance. On ImageNet,
it reduces gFID from 3.02 to 1.86 and improves IS to 316.9 using a standard
rasterization-based tokenizer. When applied to advanced tokenizers, it achieves
a gFID of 1.42 with only 177M parameters, matching the performance with larger
state-of-the-art diffusion models (675M).

TL;DR: SPEGNet是一个用于伪装目标检测的统一架构，通过通道校准和空间增强集成多尺度特征，在保持语义-空间对齐的同时实现边界精度的平衡，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前伪装目标检测方法通过累积复杂组件（如边界模块、注意力机制、多尺度处理器）来提升性能，但这种方法增加了计算负担且需要降低分辨率处理，导致丢失精细细节。需要一种统一设计来管理复杂性。

Method: SPEGNet采用统一架构设计：1）通过通道校准和空间增强集成多尺度特征；2）从上下文丰富的表示中直接生成边界；3）渐进式细化实现尺度自适应的边缘调制，在中间分辨率达到峰值影响。

Result: 在CAMO数据集上达到0.887 Sα，COD10K上0.890，NC4K上0.895，同时保持实时推理速度。能够处理从微小复杂物体到大型模式相似物体的各种尺度，并处理遮挡和模糊边界。

Conclusion: SPEGNet通过统一设计有效解决了伪装目标检测中的碎片化问题，在边界精度和区域一致性之间取得了良好平衡，实现了高性能和实时推理的兼得。

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection segments objects with intrinsic similarity and
edge disruption. Current detection methods rely on accumulated complex
components. Each approach adds components such as boundary modules, attention
mechanisms, and multi-scale processors independently. This accumulation creates
a computational burden without proportional gains. To manage this complexity,
they process at reduced resolutions, eliminating fine details essential for
camouflage. We present SPEGNet, addressing fragmentation through a unified
design. The architecture integrates multi-scale features via channel
calibration and spatial enhancement. Boundaries emerge directly from
context-rich representations, maintaining semantic-spatial alignment.
Progressive refinement implements scale-adaptive edge modulation with peak
influence at intermediate resolutions. This design strikes a balance between
boundary precision and regional consistency. SPEGNet achieves 0.887 $S_\alpha$
on CAMO, 0.890 on COD10K, and 0.895 on NC4K, with real-time inference speed.
Our approach excels across scales, from tiny, intricate objects to large,
pattern-similar ones, while handling occlusion and ambiguous boundaries. Code,

Conclusion: MedCLM为开发临床对齐的医学视觉语言模型提供了一个可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Bridging clinical diagnostic reasoning with AI remains a central challenge in
medical imaging. We introduce MedCLM, an automated pipeline that converts
detection datasets into large-scale medical visual question answering (VQA)
data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning by linking lesion boxes to organ
segmentation and structured rationales. These contextual signals enable medical
vision-language models to generate question-answer pairs with step-by-step
reasoning. To utilize this data effectively, we propose an Integrated
CoT-Curriculum Strategy composed of an Easy stage with explicit lesion boxes
for visual grounding, a Medium stage that encourages implicit localization, and
a Hard stage for weakly supervised reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate
that MedCLM attains state-of-the-art performance on several medical VQA
benchmarks, providing a scalable framework for developing clinically aligned
medical vision-language models.

Conclusion: 该方法为数字遗产保护研究提供了新的技术路径，有效解决了文化遗产领域的专业分析问题。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved significant progress in
multimodal understanding tasks, demonstrating strong capabilities particularly
in general tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. However, when
dealing with specialized cultural heritage domains like 3D vase artifacts,
existing models face severe data scarcity issues and insufficient domain
knowledge limitations. Due to the lack of targeted training data, current VLMs
struggle to effectively handle such culturally significant specialized tasks.
To address these challenges, we propose the VaseVQA-3D dataset, which serves as
the first 3D visual question answering dataset for ancient Greek pottery
analysis, collecting 664 ancient Greek vase 3D models with corresponding
question-answer data and establishing a complete data construction pipeline. We
further develop the VaseVLM model, enhancing model performance in vase artifact
analysis through domain-adaptive training. Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of our approach, where we improve by 12.8% on R@1 metrics and by
6.6% on lexical similarity compared with previous state-of-the-art on the
VaseVQA-3D dataset, significantly improving the recognition and understanding
of 3D vase artifacts, providing new technical pathways for digital heritage

Motivation: 现有的通用图像生成和编辑模型在电商场景中经常遇到一致性问题，无法很好地保持产品外观和布局的完整性。

Method: 采用分层模型框架（基础模型、模式转换模块、一致性增强模块），通过两阶段训练策略（第一阶段编辑模式转换，第二阶段一致性增强），并建立了全面的数据构建流水线。

Result: 在自建的电商基准测试中，TBStar-Edit在客观指标（VIE分数）和主观用户偏好方面均优于现有的通用领域编辑模型。

Conclusion: TBStar-Edit成功解决了电商领域图像编辑的一致性问题，为电商应用提供了专门优化的图像编辑解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation and editing technologies have enabled
state-of-the-art models to achieve impressive results in general domains.
However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often
encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce
TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain.
Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training
strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while
maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for
data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline,
encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to
acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing
data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a
hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting
modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a
two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first
stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency
enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate
datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a
self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that
TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both
objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出异步扩散模型，通过为不同像素分配不同时间步，让提示相关区域比无关区域更渐进地降噪，从而利用更清晰的像素间上下文，显著改善文本到图像的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用同步降噪，所有像素同时从噪声演化到清晰图像，导致提示相关区域只能参考相同噪声水平的无关区域，无法获得清晰上下文，最终影响文本到图像的对齐质量。

Method: 异步扩散模型框架，为不同像素分配不同时间步，重新制定逐像素降噪过程。通过动态调节单个像素的时间步调度，让提示相关区域比无关区域更渐进地降噪。

Result: 大量实验表明，异步扩散模型能显著提高各种提示下的文本到图像对齐效果。

Conclusion: 异步扩散模型通过异步降噪机制有效解决了传统扩散模型在文本到图像对齐方面的局限性，为生成更忠实于输入提示的图像提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating high-quality
images. Yet, they often struggle to faithfully align the generated images with
the input prompts. This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all
pixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result,
during generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated
regions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately
impairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose
asynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct
timesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising
process. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels,
prompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions,
thereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently,
these prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can
significantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts. The code
repository for this work is available at https://github.com/hu-zijing/AsynDM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像生成中常出现语义不一致或幻觉问题，而现有的推理时引导方法通常依赖外部信号或架构修改，带来额外计算开销。

Method: 利用中间样本作为投影基础，放大估计分数相对于该基础的切向分量来修正采样轨迹，基于一阶泰勒展开形式化引导过程。

Result: TAG能够将采样状态引导到更高概率区域，减少不一致性并提升样本质量，是一种即插即用、架构无关的模块。

Conclusion: TAG提供了一种新的扩散引导视角，以最小计算代价提高扩散采样保真度。

Abstract: Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image
generation, but often suffer from semantic inconsistencies or hallucinations.
While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they
often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural
modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this
paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and
direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without
modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample
as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated
scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We
formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion,
which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state
toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and
enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module
that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition,
offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出条件表示学习(CRL)方法，通过用户指定的条件生成定制化的特征表示，避免通用表示与下游任务不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示学习方法学习的是通用表示，主要捕获主导语义，可能与定制化下游任务不匹配。例如动物栖息地分析中，研究者关注场景相关特征，而通用嵌入强调类别语义，导致结果不理想。

Method: 利用大语言模型(LLM)根据用户指定条件生成描述性文本构建语义基，然后通过视觉语言模型(VLM)将图像表示投影到这个条件特征空间中。

Result: 在分类和检索任务上的大量实验证明了CRL方法的优越性和通用性。

Conclusion: CRL能够为任意用户指定条件提取定制化表示，更好地捕获特定标准的语义，可用于多个定制化任务。

Abstract: Conventional representation learning methods learn a universal representation
that primarily captures dominant semantics, which may not always align with
customized downstream tasks. For instance, in animal habitat analysis,
researchers prioritize scene-related features, whereas universal embeddings
emphasize categorical semantics, leading to suboptimal results. As a solution,
existing approaches resort to supervised fine-tuning, which however incurs high
computational and annotation costs. In this paper, we propose Conditional
Representation Learning (CRL), aiming to extract representations tailored to
arbitrary user-specified criteria. Specifically, we reveal that the semantics
of a space are determined by its basis, thereby enabling a set of descriptive
words to approximate the basis for a customized feature space. Building upon
this insight, given a user-specified criterion, CRL first employs a large
language model (LLM) to generate descriptive texts to construct the semantic
basis, then projects the image representation into this conditional feature
space leveraging a vision-language model (VLM). The conditional representation
better captures semantics for the specific criterion, which could be utilized
for multiple customized tasks. Extensive experiments on classification and
retrieval tasks demonstrate the superiority and generality of the proposed CRL.

Abstract: Diagnosing a whole-slide image is an interactive, multi-stage process
involving changes in magnification and movement between fields. Although recent
pathology foundation models are strong, practical agentic systems that decide
what field to examine next, adjust magnification, and deliver explainable
diagnoses are still lacking. The blocker is data: scalable, clinically aligned
supervision of expert viewing behavior that is tacit and experience-based, not
written in textbooks or online, and therefore absent from large language model
training. We introduce the AI Session Recorder, which works with standard WSI
viewers to unobtrusively record routine navigation and convert the viewer logs
into standardized behavioral commands (inspect or peek at discrete
magnifications) and bounding boxes. A lightweight human-in-the-loop review
turns AI-drafted rationales into the Pathology-CoT dataset, a form of paired
"where to look" and "why it matters" supervision produced at roughly six times
lower labeling time. Using this behavioral data, we build Pathologist-o3, a
two-stage agent that first proposes regions of interest and then performs
behavior-guided reasoning. On gastrointestinal lymph-node metastasis detection,
it achieved 84.5% precision, 100.0% recall, and 75.4% accuracy, exceeding the
state-of-the-art OpenAI o3 model and generalizing across backbones. To our
knowledge, this constitutes one of the first behavior-grounded agentic systems
in pathology. Turning everyday viewer logs into scalable, expert-validated
supervision, our framework makes agentic pathology practical and establishes a
path to human-aligned, upgradeable clinical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning-based methods have achieved significant success in remote
sensing Earth observation data analysis. Numerous feature fusion techniques
address multimodal remote sensing image classification by integrating global
and local features. However, these techniques often struggle to extract
structural and detail features from heterogeneous and redundant multimodal
images. With the goal of introducing frequency domain learning to model key and
sparse detail features, this paper introduces the spatial-spectral-frequency
interaction network (S$^2$Fin), which integrates pairwise fusion modules across
the spatial, spectral, and frequency domains. Specifically, we propose a
high-frequency sparse enhancement transformer that employs sparse
spatial-spectral attention to optimize the parameters of the high-frequency
filter. Subsequently, a two-level spatial-frequency fusion strategy is
introduced, comprising an adaptive frequency channel module that fuses
low-frequency structures with enhanced high-frequency details, and a
high-frequency resonance mask that emphasizes sharp edges via phase similarity.
In addition, a spatial-spectral attention fusion module further enhances
feature extraction at intermediate layers of the network. Experiments on four
benchmark multimodal datasets with limited labeled data demonstrate that
S$^2$Fin performs superior classification, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at https://github.com/HaoLiu-XDU/SSFin.

Abstract: Detecting manipulated media has now become a pressing issue with the recent
rise of deepfakes. Most existing approaches fail to generalize across diverse
datasets and generation techniques. We thus propose a novel ensemble framework,
combining the strengths of transformer-based architectures, such as Swin
Transformers and ViTs, and texture-based methods, to achieve better detection
accuracy and robustness. Our method introduces innovative data-splitting,
sequential training, frequency splitting, patch-based attention, and face
segmentation techniques to handle dataset imbalances, enhance high-impact
regions (e.g., eyes and mouth), and improve generalization. Our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance when tested on the DFWild-Cup dataset, a diverse
subset of eight deepfake datasets. The ensemble benefits from the
complementarity of these approaches, with transformers excelling in global
feature extraction and texturebased methods providing interpretability. This
work demonstrates that hybrid models can effectively address the evolving
challenges of deepfake detection, offering a robust solution for real-world
applications.

Motivation: ForestEyes项目结合公民科学和机器学习检测热带森林砍伐，传统使用SLIC算法进行图像分割，但近期研究表明其他超像素方法在遥感图像分割中表现更好。

Method: 比较了SLIC和其他四种最佳分割方法，使用PyCaret AutoML库选择前五个分类器，并应用分类器融合方法（集成学习）。

Result: 初始结果显示不同分割方法间性能差异不大，但通过分类器融合方法，平衡准确率有明显提升。

Conclusion: 分割方法的选择和机器学习模型的组合对于森林砍伐检测任务都很重要，分类器融合能显著改善检测性能。

Abstract: Image segmentation is a crucial step in various visual applications,
including environmental monitoring through remote sensing. In the context of
the ForestEyes project, which combines citizen science and machine learning to
detect deforestation in tropical forests, image segments are used for labeling
by volunteers and subsequent model training. Traditionally, the Simple Linear
Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm is adopted as the segmentation method.
However, recent studies have indicated that other superpixel-based methods
outperform SLIC in remote sensing image segmentation, and might suggest that
they are more suitable for the task of detecting deforested areas. In this
sense, this study investigated the impact of the four best segmentation
methods, together with SLIC, on the training of classifiers for the target
application. Initially, the results showed little variation in performance
among segmentation methods, even when selecting the top five classifiers using
the PyCaret AutoML library. However, by applying a classifier fusion approach
(ensemble of classifiers), noticeable improvements in balanced accuracy were
observed, highlighting the importance of both the choice of segmentation method
and the combination of machine learning-based models for deforestation
detection tasks.

Result: 在三个代表性LLM上的系统实验显示，经过EduPersona人格微调的变体在所有任务上均取得显著改进：TASK1 +33.6%、TASK2 +30.6%、TASK3 +14.9%。这些改进突显了数据集的有效性和研究价值，同时揭示了人格建模的异质性难度。

Conclusion: EduPersona提供了首个以主观能力为中心的课堂基准测试，建立了解耦且可验证的研究范式，并将开源数据集和框架以支持更广泛的研究社区推进教育领域可信且拟人化AI的发展。

Abstract: As large language models are increasingly integrated into education, virtual
student agents are becoming vital for classroom simulation and teacher
training. Yet their classroom-oriented subjective abilities remain largely
unassessed, limiting understanding of model boundaries and hindering
trustworthy deployment. We present EduPersona, a large-scale benchmark spanning
two languages, three subjects, and ten persona types based on the Big Five
theory. The dataset contains 1,308 authentic classroom dialogue rounds,
corresponding to 12,814 teacher-student Q&A turns, and is further expanded
through persona stylization into roughly 10 times larger scale (128k turns),
providing a solid foundation for evaluation. Building on this resource, we
decompose hard-to-quantify subjective performance into three progressive tasks:
TASK1 basic coherence (whether behavior, emotion, expression, and voice align
with classroom context), TASK2 student realism, and TASK3 long-term persona
consistency, thereby establishing an evaluation framework grounded in
educational theory and research value. We conduct systematic experiments on
three representative LLMs, comparing their original versions with ten
persona-fine-tuned variants trained on EduPersona. Results show consistent and
significant average improvements across all tasks: TASK1 +33.6%, TASK2 +30.6%,
and TASK3 +14.9%. These improvements highlight the dataset's effectiveness and
research value, while also revealing the heterogeneous difficulty of persona
modeling. In summary, EduPersona delivers the first classroom benchmark
centered on subjective abilities, establishes a decoupled and verifiable
research paradigm, and we will open-source both the dataset and the framework
to support the broader research community in advancing trustworthy and
human-like AI for education.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多阶段混合运动专家（MoME）架构，用于从步态序列中预测心理特征，在PsyMo基准测试中超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 步态包含丰富的生物特征和行为信息，但利用行走方式推断心理特征仍是一个具有挑战性且研究不足的问题。

Method: 采用分层多阶段混合运动专家架构，将行走周期分为四个运动复杂度阶段，使用轻量级专家模型提取时空特征，并通过任务特定的门控模块自适应加权专家。

Result: 在涵盖17个心理特征的PsyMo基准测试中，该方法在运行级别获得37.47%的加权F1分数，在受试者级别获得44.6%，优于现有步态分析模型。

Conclusion: 研究证明了基于步态的多任务学习在心理特征估计中的可行性，为未来基于运动信息的心理推断研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Gait encodes rich biometric and behavioural information, yet leveraging the
manner of walking to infer psychological traits remains a challenging and
underexplored problem. We introduce a hierarchical Multi-Stage Mixture of
Movement Experts (MoME) architecture for multi-task prediction of psychological
attributes from gait sequences represented as 2D poses. MoME processes the
walking cycle in four stages of movement complexity, employing lightweight
expert models to extract spatio-temporal features and task-specific gating
modules to adaptively weight experts across traits and stages. Evaluated on the
PsyMo benchmark covering 17 psychological traits, our method outperforms
state-of-the-art gait analysis models, achieving a 37.47% weighted F1 score at
the run level and 44.6% at the subject level. Our experiments show that
integrating auxiliary tasks such as identity recognition, gender prediction,
and BMI estimation further improves psychological trait estimation. Our
findings demonstrate the viability of multi-task gait-based learning for
psychological trait estimation and provide a foundation for future research on
movement-informed psychological inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多概念个性化在文本到图像扩散模型中的应用日益重要，但面临概念混合的挑战，即多个学习到的概念在输出图像中产生不希望的干扰或混合。

Method: 框架包含两个关键组件：1) Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA) - 仅调整交叉注意力中的值投影的训练方法；2) Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA) - 通过优化输入潜在表示来缓解注意力纠缠的推理方法。

Result: 通过广泛的定性和定量实验证明，ConceptSplit能够实现鲁棒的多概念个性化，减轻了意外的概念干扰。

Conclusion: ConceptSplit通过创新的训练和推理方法有效解决了多概念个性化中的概念混合问题，为文本到图像扩散模型的多概念表示提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-concept personalization for text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models to represent several subjects in an image has gained much more
attention. The main challenge of this task is "concept mixing", where multiple
learned concepts interfere or blend undesirably in the output image. To address
this issue, in this paper, we present ConceptSplit, a novel framework to split
the individual concepts through training and inference. Our framework comprises
two key components. First, we introduce Token-wise Value Adaptation (ToVA), a
merging-free training method that focuses exclusively on adapting the value
projection in cross-attention. Based on our empirical analysis, we found that
modifying the key projection, a common approach in existing methods, can
disrupt the attention mechanism and lead to concept mixing. Second, we propose
Latent Optimization for Disentangled Attention (LODA), which alleviates
attention entanglement during inference by optimizing the input latent. Through
extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that
ConceptSplit achieves robust multi-concept personalization, mitigating
unintended concept interference. Code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多相MRI中肝脏分割对肝纤维化评估至关重要，但现实场景中标注数据稀缺、模态分布不均、存在空间错位和缺失相位等问题，需要标签高效的解决方案。

Method: 整合基础级3D分割骨干网络微调、交叉伪监督协同训练利用未标注数据、标准化预处理流程，无需空间配准即可跨MRI相位和厂商泛化。

Conclusion: 结合基础模型适应与协同训练的方法对现实临床成像任务具有重要潜力，为多相多厂商MRI中的肝脏分割提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate liver segmentation in multi-phase MRI is vital for liver fibrosis
assessment, yet labeled data is often scarce and unevenly distributed across
imaging modalities and vendor systems. We propose a label-efficient
segmentation approach that promotes cross-modality generalization under
real-world conditions, where GED4 hepatobiliary-phase annotations are limited,
non-contrast sequences (T1WI, T2WI, DWI) are unlabeled, and spatial
misalignment and missing phases are common. Our method integrates a
foundation-scale 3D segmentation backbone adapted via fine-tuning, co-training
with cross pseudo supervision to leverage unlabeled volumes, and a standardized
preprocessing pipeline. Without requiring spatial registration, the model
learns to generalize across MRI phases and vendors, demonstrating robust
segmentation performance in both labeled and unlabeled domains. Our results
exhibit the effectiveness of our proposed label-efficient baseline for liver
segmentation in multi-phase, multi-vendor MRI and highlight the potential of
combining foundation model adaptation with co-training for real-world clinical
imaging tasks.

Method: 基于ID一致的人脸基础模型，采用组合式设计，包含由FLAME blendshape参数引导的表情交叉注意力模块，并在包含丰富表情变化的图像和视频数据上训练。

Result: 模型在定制化和身份一致的表情生成方面优于现有方法，能够生成从基础情感到微妙微表情的各种表情，并支持真实图像的表情编辑。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了身份一致性和精细表情控制的平衡问题，为AI驱动的故事讲述提供了更强大的人类中心生成能力。

Abstract: Human-centric generative models designed for AI-driven storytelling must
bring together two core capabilities: identity consistency and precise control
over human performance. While recent diffusion-based approaches have made
significant progress in maintaining facial identity, achieving fine-grained
expression control without compromising identity remains challenging. In this
work, we present a diffusion-based framework that faithfully reimagines any
subject under any particular facial expression. Building on an ID-consistent
face foundation model, we adopt a compositional design featuring an expression
cross-attention module guided by FLAME blendshape parameters for explicit
control. Trained on a diverse mixture of image and video data rich in
expressive variation, our adapter generalizes beyond basic emotions to subtle
micro-expressions and expressive transitions, overlooked by prior works. In
addition, a pluggable Reference Adapter enables expression editing in real
images by transferring the appearance from a reference frame during synthesis.
Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model
outperforms existing methods in tailored and identity-consistent expression
generation. Code and models can be found at

TL;DR: ReactDiff是一个用于生成多样化面部反应的时间扩散框架，通过整合时空面部运动学约束来产生逼真的人类面部反应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法模拟真实人类反应的随机性和动态特性，在人类-计算机交互系统中生成多样且逼真的面部反应仍是一个关键挑战。

Method: 提出ReactDiff时间扩散框架，整合两个关键先验：时间面部行为运动学和面部动作单元依赖关系，引导模型生成符合人类面部解剖学约束的逼真反应。

Result: 在REACT2024数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法不仅达到了最先进的反应质量，而且在多样性和反应适当性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: ReactDiff通过整合时空面部运动学约束，成功解决了生成多样化且逼真面部反应的挑战，避免了视觉上不真实的抖动、不稳定过渡和不自然表情等问题。

Abstract: The automatic generation of diverse and human-like facial reactions in dyadic
dialogue remains a critical challenge for human-computer interaction systems.
Existing methods fail to model the stochasticity and dynamics inherent in real
human reactions. To address this, we propose ReactDiff, a novel temporal
diffusion framework for generating diverse facial reactions that are
appropriate for responding to any given dialogue context. Our key insight is
that plausible human reactions demonstrate smoothness, and coherence over time,
and conform to constraints imposed by human facial anatomy. To achieve this,
ReactDiff incorporates two vital priors (spatio-temporal facial kinematics)
into the diffusion process: i) temporal facial behavioral kinematics and ii)
facial action unit dependencies. These two constraints guide the model toward
realistic human reaction manifolds, avoiding visually unrealistic jitters,
unstable transitions, unnatural expressions, and other artifacts. Extensive
experiments on the REACT2024 dataset demonstrate that our approach not only
achieves state-of-the-art reaction quality but also excels in diversity and
reaction appropriateness.

Method: 设计了高判别性的对象特征编码器，采用对比预训练策略将对象表示学习与场景图预测解耦，并有效结合几何和语义特征进行关系预测。

Abstract: 3D Semantic Scene Graph Prediction aims to detect objects and their semantic
relationships in 3D scenes, and has emerged as a crucial technology for
robotics and AR/VR applications. While previous research has addressed dataset
limitations and explored various approaches including Open-Vocabulary settings,
they frequently fail to optimize the representational capacity of object and
relationship features, showing excessive reliance on Graph Neural Networks
despite insufficient discriminative capability. In this work, we demonstrate
through extensive analysis that the quality of object features plays a critical
role in determining overall scene graph accuracy. To address this challenge, we
design a highly discriminative object feature encoder and employ a contrastive
pretraining strategy that decouples object representation learning from the
scene graph prediction. This design not only enhances object classification
accuracy but also yields direct improvements in relationship prediction.
Notably, when plugging in our pretrained encoder into existing frameworks, we
observe substantial performance improvements across all evaluation metrics.
Additionally, whereas existing approaches have not fully exploited the
integration of relationship information, we effectively combine both geometric
and semantic features to achieve superior relationship prediction.
Comprehensive experiments on the 3DSSG dataset demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
publicly available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/OCRL-3DSSG-Codes.

TL;DR: 该研究建立了首个野生动物监测中的单目度量深度估计基准，评估了4种先进MDE方法在93张相机陷阱图像上的表现，发现Depth Anything V2性能最佳（MAE 0.454m），而ZoeDepth在户外自然环境中表现显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机陷阱广泛用于野生动物监测，但从单目图像中提取准确距离测量仍具挑战性，因为缺乏深度信息。虽然单目深度估计方法已有显著进展，但它们在自然野生动物环境中的性能尚未得到系统评估。

Method: 在93张带有使用校准ChARUCO模式获得地面真实距离的相机陷阱图像上，评估了四种最先进的MDE方法（Depth Anything V2、ML Depth Pro、ZoeDepth和Metric3D）以及几何基线方法。

Result: Depth Anything V2实现最佳整体性能（平均绝对误差0.454m，相关性0.962），而ZoeDepth在户外自然环境中表现显著下降（MAE：3.087m）。基于中位数的深度提取在所有深度学习方法中始终优于基于均值的方法。ZoeDepth最快（每张图像0.17秒）但最不准确，Depth Anything V2在准确性和速度之间提供最佳平衡（每张图像0.22秒）。

Conclusion: 该基准为野生动物应用建立了性能基线，并为在保护监测系统中实施深度估计提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Camera traps are widely used for wildlife monitoring, but extracting accurate
distance measurements from monocular images remains challenging due to the lack
of depth information. While monocular depth estimation (MDE) methods have
advanced significantly, their performance in natural wildlife environments has
not been systematically evaluated. This work introduces the first benchmark for
monocular metric depth estimation in wildlife monitoring conditions. We
evaluate four state-of-the-art MDE methods (Depth Anything V2, ML Depth Pro,
ZoeDepth, and Metric3D) alongside a geometric baseline on 93 camera trap images
with ground truth distances obtained using calibrated ChARUCO patterns. Our
results demonstrate that Depth Anything V2 achieves the best overall
performance with a mean absolute error of 0.454m and correlation of 0.962,
while methods like ZoeDepth show significant degradation in outdoor natural
environments (MAE: 3.087m). We find that median-based depth extraction
consistently outperforms mean-based approaches across all deep learning
methods. Additionally, we analyze computational efficiency, with ZoeDepth being
fastest (0.17s per image) but least accurate, while Depth Anything V2 provides
an optimal balance of accuracy and speed (0.22s per image). This benchmark
establishes performance baselines for wildlife applications and provides
practical guidance for implementing depth estimation in conservation monitoring
systems.

Abstract: Quantifying sponsor visibility in sports broadcasts is a critical marketing
task traditionally hindered by manual, subjective, and unscalable analysis
methods. While automated systems offer an alternative, their reliance on
axis-aligned Horizontal Bounding Box (HBB) leads to inaccurate exposuremetrics
when logos appear rotated or skewed due to dynamic camera angles and
perspective distortions. This paper introduces ExposureEngine, an end-to-end
system designed for accurate, rotation-aware sponsor visibility analytics in
sports broadcasts, demonstrated in a soccer case study. Our approach predicts
Oriented Bounding Box (OBB) to provide a geometrically precise fit to each logo
regardless of the orientation on-screen. To train and evaluate our detector, we
developed a new dataset comprising 1,103 frames from Swedish elite soccer,
featuring 670 unique sponsor logos annotated with OBBs. Our model achieves a
mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 0.859, with a precision of 0.96 and recall
of 0.87, demonstrating robust performance in localizing logos under diverse
broadcast conditions. The system integrates these detections into an analytical
pipeline that calculates precise visibility metrics, such as exposure duration
and on-screen coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate a language-driven agentic
layer, enabling users to generate reports, summaries, and media content through
natural language queries. The complete system, including the dataset and the
analytics dashboard, provides a comprehensive solution for auditable and
interpretable sponsor measurement in sports media. An overview of the
ExposureEngine is available online: https://youtu.be/tRw6OBISuW4 .

Motivation: 传统目标检测器在红外小目标检测中由于复杂背景和微小目标尺寸导致大量误报，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出Anomaly-Aware YOLO (AA-YOLO)，在YOLO检测头中集成统计异常检测测试，将小目标视为背景的异常模式。

Result: 在多个IRSTD基准测试中取得有竞争力的性能，在训练数据有限、噪声和域偏移场景下表现出显著鲁棒性，且可应用于各种YOLO骨干网络和实例分割YOLO。

Conclusion: AA-YOLO是一个通用且高效的解决方案，特别适合资源受限的实际部署场景。

Abstract: Infrared Small Target Detection (IRSTD) is a challenging task in defense
applications, where complex backgrounds and tiny target sizes often result in
numerous false alarms using conventional object detectors. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Anomaly-Aware YOLO (AA-YOLO), which integrates a
statistical anomaly detection test into its detection head. By treating small
targets as unexpected patterns against the background, AA-YOLO effectively
controls the false alarm rate. Our approach not only achieves competitive
performance on several IRSTD benchmarks, but also demonstrates remarkable
robustness in scenarios with limited training data, noise, and domain shifts.
Furthermore, since only the detection head is modified, our design is highly
generic and has been successfully applied across various YOLO backbones,
including lightweight models. It also provides promising results when
integrated into an instance segmentation YOLO. This versatility makes AA-YOLO
an attractive solution for real-world deployments where resources are
constrained. The code will be publicly released.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of transformer-based architectures
for person identification in natural, face-to-face conversation scenario. We
implement and evaluate a two-stream framework that separately models spatial
configurations and temporal motion patterns of 133 COCO WholeBody keypoints,
extracted from a subset of the CANDOR conversational corpus. Our experiments
compare pre-trained and from-scratch training, investigate the use of velocity

motion modeling. Results demonstrate that domain-specific training
significantly outperforms transfer learning, and that spatial configurations
carry more discriminative information than temporal dynamics. The spatial
transformer achieves 95.74% accuracy, while the multi-scale temporal
transformer achieves 93.90%. Feature-level fusion pushes performance to 98.03%,
confirming that postural and dynamic information are complementary. These

Conclusion: 该框架通过渐进增强表示和自适应特征聚合，实现了更精确和详细的场景理解，为开放词汇3D占用预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The 3D occupancy prediction task has witnessed remarkable progress in recent
years, playing a crucial role in vision-based autonomous driving systems. While
traditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches
have moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary
text queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in
text-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to
capture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs
significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present
PG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables
open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive
online densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D
Gaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively
enhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and
detailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of
an anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which
adaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and
stages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene
information capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ
achieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement
over the previous best performing method. Code and pretrained models will be
released upon publication on our project page:

Conclusion: 通过生成未见类数据可以有效估计开放环境分布，理论证明该方法能上界估计误差，实验验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary learning requires modeling the data distribution in open
environments, which consists of both seen-class and unseen-class data.
  Existing methods estimate the distribution in open environments using
seen-class data, where the absence of unseen classes makes the estimation error
inherently unidentifiable.
  Intuitively, learning beyond the seen classes is crucial for distribution
estimation to bound the estimation error.
  We theoretically demonstrate that the distribution can be effectively
estimated by generating unseen-class data, through which the estimation error
is upper-bounded.
  Building on this theoretical insight, we propose a novel open-vocabulary
learning method, which generates unseen-class data for estimating the
distribution in open environments. The method consists of a class-domain-wise
data generation pipeline and a distribution alignment algorithm. The data
generation pipeline generates unseen-class data under the guidance of a
hierarchical semantic tree and domain information inferred from the seen-class
data, facilitating accurate distribution estimation. With the generated data,
the distribution alignment algorithm estimates and maximizes the posterior
probability to enhance generalization in open-vocabulary learning. Extensive
experiments on $11$ datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline
approaches by up to $14\%$, highlighting its effectiveness and superiority.

Motivation: 建立手术视频分类中联邦学习的基准，评估方法在未见临床中心的泛化能力以及通过本地微调实现个性化适应的效果，同时确保不共享患者数据。

Method: 参与者使用Appendix300数据集开发策略，包括基础模型线性探测、三元组损失的度量学习，以及FedAvg、FedMedian、FedSAM等联邦学习聚合方案。评估基于F1分数和期望成本，通过自助法和统计测试验证排名稳定性。

Result: 泛化任务中跨中心性能有限；适应任务中所有团队在微调后均有改进，但排名稳定性较低。ViViT模型表现最佳。挑战揭示了泛化能力不足、类别不平衡敏感性和去中心化训练中超参数调优困难等问题。

Conclusion: FedSurg挑战赛建立了手术视频分类中联邦学习的首个基准，揭示了本地个性化与全局鲁棒性之间的权衡，强调了架构选择、预处理和损失函数设计的重要性，为未来开发不平衡感知、自适应和鲁棒的临床手术AI方法提供了参考。

Abstract: Purpose: The FedSurg challenge was designed to benchmark the state of the art
in federated learning for surgical video classification. Its goal was to assess
how well current methods generalize to unseen clinical centers and adapt
through local fine-tuning while enabling collaborative model development
without sharing patient data. Methods: Participants developed strategies to
classify inflammation stages in appendicitis using a preliminary version of the
multi-center Appendix300 video dataset. The challenge evaluated two tasks:
generalization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after
fine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear
probing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes
(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and
Expected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and
statistical testing. Results: In the generalization task, performance across
centers was limited. In the adaptation task, all teams improved after
fine-tuning, though ranking stability was low. The ViViT-based submission
achieved the strongest overall performance. The challenge highlighted
limitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties
in hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal
modeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies.
Conclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for
evaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight
the trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and
underscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss
design. This benchmarking offers a reference point for future development of
imbalance-aware, adaptive, and robust FL methods in clinical surgical AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D扫描方法需要专业知识和人工干预来维持最佳扫描条件，限制了文化遗产数字化的效率和可及性。

Method: 使用两个协调工作的机器人系统：一个配备扫描仪，另一个负责托盘处理。通过参数化扫描空间、优化轨迹规划和路径点分布来实现全面表面覆盖。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法相比基准方法显著降低了Chamfer Distance，提高了F-score，在几何精度和数字化效率方面表现优越。

Conclusion: 该系统能够提供卓越的几何精度，提高数字化效率，并减少对专业操作人员的依赖，为文化遗产保护提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D scanning is essential for preserving cultural heritage
artefacts, supporting documentation, analysis, and long-term conservation.
However, conventional methods typically require specialized expertise and
manual intervention to maintain optimal scanning conditions and coverage. We
present an automated two-robot scanning system that eliminates the need for
handheld or semi-automatic workflows by combining coordinated robotic
manipulation with high-resolution 3D scanning. Our system parameterizes the
scanning space into distinct regions, enabling coordinated motion planning
between a scanner-equipped robot and a tray-handling robot. Optimized
trajectory planning and waypoint distribution ensure comprehensive surface
coverage, minimize occlusions, and balance reconstruction accuracy with system
efficiency. Experimental results show that our approach achieves significantly
lower Chamfer Distance and higher F-score compared to baseline methods,
offering superior geometric accuracy, improved digitization efficiency, and
reduced reliance on expert operators.

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了ViT和CNN在几何估计任务中的表现，发现在大数据场景下ViT表现更优，而在小数据场景下CNN的归纳偏置使其性能与ViT相当，ViT在跨域评估中表现出更强的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ViT和CNN作为骨干网络在几何估计任务（如图像刚性变换和基础矩阵估计）中的效率，特别是在低数据量场景下的表现差异。

Method: 系统比较了大规模CNN（ResNet、EfficientNet、CLIP-ResNet）与基于ViT的基础模型（CLIP-ViT变体和DINO）在不同数据量设置下的性能，包括少样本场景。

Result: 在大数据下游场景中，ViT在微调时优于CNN；在小数据场景中，CNN的归纳偏置和较小容量使其性能与ViT相当；ViT在跨域评估中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 需要根据具体场景仔细选择模型架构进行微调，未来研究应关注平衡局部和全局表示的混合架构。

Abstract: Vision-transformers (ViTs) and large-scale convolution-neural-networks (CNNs)
have reshaped computer vision through pretrained feature representations that
enable strong transfer learning for diverse tasks. However, their efficiency as
backbone architectures for geometric estimation tasks involving image
deformations in low-data regimes remains an open question. This work considers
two such tasks: 1) estimating 2D rigid transformations between pairs of images
and 2) predicting the fundamental matrix for stereo image pairs, an important
problem in various applications, such as autonomous mobility, robotics, and 3D
scene reconstruction. Addressing this intriguing question, this work
systematically compares large-scale CNNs (ResNet, EfficientNet, CLIP-ResNet)
with ViT-based foundation models (CLIP-ViT variants and DINO) in various data
size settings, including few-shot scenarios. These pretrained models are
optimized for classification or contrastive learning, encouraging them to focus
mostly on high-level semantics. The considered tasks require balancing local
and global features differently, challenging the straightforward adoption of
these models as the backbone. Empirical comparative analysis shows that,
similar to training from scratch, ViTs outperform CNNs during refinement in
large downstream-data scenarios. However, in small data scenarios, the
inductive bias and smaller capacity of CNNs improve their performance, allowing
them to match that of a ViT. Moreover, ViTs exhibit stronger generalization in
cross-domain evaluation where the data distribution changes. These results
emphasize the importance of carefully selecting model architectures for
refinement, motivating future research towards hybrid architectures that
balance local and global representations.

TL;DR: DiT-VTON是一个基于扩散变换器的新型虚拟试穿框架，通过多种配置探索最佳图像条件设置，在扩展数据集上训练以增强鲁棒性，实现了超越传统服装试穿的虚拟试所有功能，在VITON-HD数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿模型在细节保留、真实图像鲁棒性、高效采样、图像编辑能力和跨品类泛化方面存在挑战，需要开发更强大的解决方案。

Method: 利用扩散变换器适应图像条件虚拟试穿任务，探索多种DiT配置（上下文标记连接、通道连接、ControlNet集成），在包含多样化背景、非结构化参考和非服装类别的扩展数据集上训练。

Result: 在VITON-HD数据集上超越最先进方法，实现更优的细节保留和鲁棒性，无需额外条件编码器；在涵盖数千产品类别的多样化数据集上，超越具有VTA和图像编辑能力的模型。

Conclusion: DiT-VTON重新定义了虚拟试穿任务，提供多功能的虚拟试所有解决方案，支持姿势保持、局部编辑、纹理传输和对象级定制等高级图像编辑功能，展示了数据扩展对VTO适应性的益处。

Abstract: The rapid growth of e-commerce has intensified the demand for Virtual Try-On
(VTO) technologies, enabling customers to realistically visualize products
overlaid on their own images. Despite recent advances, existing VTO models face
challenges with fine-grained detail preservation, robustness to real-world
imagery, efficient sampling, image editing capabilities, and generalization
across diverse product categories. In this paper, we present DiT-VTON, a novel
VTO framework that leverages a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), renowned for its
performance on text-conditioned image generation, adapted here for the
image-conditioned VTO task. We systematically explore multiple DiT
configurations, including in-context token concatenation, channel
concatenation, and ControlNet integration, to determine the best setup for VTO
image conditioning.
  To enhance robustness, we train the model on an expanded dataset encompassing
varied backgrounds, unstructured references, and non-garment categories,
demonstrating the benefits of data scaling for VTO adaptability. DiT-VTON also
redefines the VTO task beyond garment try-on, offering a versatile Virtual
Try-All (VTA) solution capable of handling a wide range of product categories
and supporting advanced image editing functionalities such as pose
preservation, localized editing, texture transfer, and object-level
customization. Experimental results show that our model surpasses
state-of-the-art methods on VITON-HD, achieving superior detail preservation
and robustness without reliance on additional condition encoders. It also
outperforms models with VTA and image editing capabilities on a diverse dataset
spanning thousands of product categories.

TL;DR: EgoSurg是一个从固定摄像头视频重建手术室中任何人员动态自我中心视角回放的框架，通过几何驱动的神经渲染和扩散增强技术实现高保真视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手术观察依赖固定视角或回忆，无法记录指导临床决策的自我中心视觉视角。固定摄像头视频虽能捕捉手术流程，但无法重建每个团队成员实际所见，限制了手术安全、培训和流程优化的决策分析。

Method: EgoSurg结合几何驱动的神经渲染与基于扩散的视角增强技术，能够从墙装固定摄像头视频中合成任意时刻的任意自我中心视角，无需干扰临床工作流程。

Result: 在多站点手术案例和对照研究中，EgoSurg能够以高视觉质量和保真度重建人员特定的视觉场和任意视角。

Conclusion: 通过将现有手术室摄像头基础设施转化为可导航的动态3D记录，EgoSurg为沉浸式手术数据科学建立了新基础，使手术实践可以从各个角度可视化、体验和分析。

Abstract: Observing surgical practice has historically relied on fixed vantage points
or recollections, leaving the egocentric visual perspectives that guide
clinical decisions undocumented. Fixed-camera video can capture surgical
workflows at the room-scale, but cannot reconstruct what each team member
actually saw. Thus, these videos only provide limited insights into how
decisions that affect surgical safety, training, and workflow optimization are
made. Here we introduce EgoSurg, the first framework to reconstruct the
dynamic, egocentric replays for any operating room (OR) staff directly from
wall-mounted fixed-camera video, and thus, without intervention to clinical
workflow. EgoSurg couples geometry-driven neural rendering with diffusion-based
view enhancement, enabling high-visual fidelity synthesis of arbitrary and
egocentric viewpoints at any moment. In evaluation across multi-site surgical
cases and controlled studies, EgoSurg reconstructs person-specific visual
fields and arbitrary viewpoints with high visual quality and fidelity. By
transforming existing OR camera infrastructure into a navigable dynamic 3D
record, EgoSurg establishes a new foundation for immersive surgical data
science, enabling surgical practice to be visualized, experienced, and analyzed
from every angle.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过分析多模态语言模型(MLMs)中视觉键值令牌的处理方式，揭示了MLMs在感知任务上表现不佳的原因。研究发现视觉值令牌包含足够信息用于分割、语义对应等任务，但语言模型对视觉信息的增强有限，且后期层中的图像键令牌存在降低感知能力的人工痕迹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有工作分析了VIT编码器和transformer激活，但尚不清楚为何多模态语言模型在感知密集型任务上表现不佳。本文从视觉键值令牌处理的角度提供新的研究视角。

Method: 研究流行MLMs(LLaVA-OneVision、Qwen2.5-VL、Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT)处理视觉键值令牌的方式，分析视觉信息在语言模型中的流动，比较视觉编码器和语言模型的视觉信息含量，并探索通过文本前缀控制视觉信息的方法。

Result: 发现视觉值令牌编码了足够信息用于多个感知任务；语言模型对视觉信息的增强与整体MLM感知能力相关，但包含的视觉信息少于未经过MLM微调的视觉编码器；后期层中的图像键令牌存在降低感知能力的人工痕迹；添加文本前缀能改善视觉表示的感知能力；在BLINK基准测试中，33.3%的艺术风格问题中语言模型内的感知信息未输出。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了键值令牌在多模态系统中的重要作用，为MLMs的机制可解释性研究开辟了新途径，并为其视觉编码器和语言模型组件的训练提供了新方向。

Abstract: Despite interpretability work analyzing VIT encoders and transformer
activations, we don't yet understand why Multimodal Language Models (MLMs)
struggle on perception-heavy tasks. We offer an under-studied perspective by
examining how popular MLMs (LLaVA-OneVision, Qwen2.5-VL, and
Llama-3-LLaVA-NeXT) process their visual key-value tokens. We first study the
flow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value
tokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks
zero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and
referring expression detection. We find that while the language model does
augment the visual information received from the projection of input visual
encodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it
contains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual
encoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that
the visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in
later layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception
capability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information
in the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input
improves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal
that if language models were able to better control their visual information,
their perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style
questions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the
language model is not surfaced to the output! Our findings reveal insights into
the role of key-value tokens in multimodal systems, paving the way for deeper
mechanistic interpretability of MLMs and suggesting new directions for training
their visual encoder and language model components.

TL;DR: AvatarVTON是首个4D虚拟试穿框架，能从单张服装图片生成逼真的试穿效果，支持自由姿势控制、新视角渲染和多样化服装选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要多视角服装捕捉或物理先验，无法支持单视角监督下的动态服装交互。AvatarVTON旨在解决这一限制，实现无需多视角数据或物理先验的4D虚拟试穿。

Method: 框架包含两个关键模块：1）互易流校正器 - 无先验的光流校正策略，稳定虚拟形象拟合并确保时间一致性；2）非线性变形器 - 将高斯图分解为视角-姿态不变和视角-姿态特定组件，实现自适应非线性服装变形。

Result: 通过扩展现有基线建立4D虚拟试穿基准，进行公平的定性和定量比较。大量实验表明AvatarVTON实现了高保真度、多样性和动态服装真实感。

Conclusion: AvatarVTON在AR/VR、游戏和数字人应用中表现出色，为4D虚拟试穿提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We propose AvatarVTON, the first 4D virtual try-on framework that generates
realistic try-on results from a single in-shop garment image, enabling free
pose control, novel-view rendering, and diverse garment choices. Unlike
existing methods, AvatarVTON supports dynamic garment interactions under
single-view supervision, without relying on multi-view garment captures or
physics priors. The framework consists of two key modules: (1) a Reciprocal
Flow Rectifier, a prior-free optical-flow correction strategy that stabilizes
avatar fitting and ensures temporal coherence; and (2) a Non-Linear Deformer,
which decomposes Gaussian maps into view-pose-invariant and view-pose-specific
components, enabling adaptive, non-linear garment deformations. To establish a
benchmark for 4D virtual try-on, we extend existing baselines with unified
modules for fair qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Extensive
experiments show that AvatarVTON achieves high fidelity, diversity, and dynamic
garment realism, making it well-suited for AR/VR, gaming, and digital-human
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成合成CT对于实现MRI-only和CBCT自适应放疗至关重要，可提高治疗精度并减少患者辐射暴露。

Method: 采用完全3D流匹配框架，将高斯噪声体积通过学习的流匹配速度场转换为sCT图像，使用轻量级3D编码器从输入MRI或CBCT中提取特征作为条件。

Result: 在SynthRAD2025挑战基准上评估，方法能准确重建全局解剖结构，但受限于训练分辨率，保留精细细节的能力有限。

Conclusion: 该方法在全局结构重建方面表现良好，但需要未来工作探索基于补丁的训练和潜在空间流模型来提高分辨率和局部结构保真度。

Abstract: Generating synthetic CT (sCT) from MRI or CBCT plays a crucial role in
enabling MRI-only and CBCT-based adaptive radiotherapy, improving treatment
precision while reducing patient radiation exposure. To address this task, we
adopt a fully 3D Flow Matching (FM) framework, motivated by recent work
demonstrating FM's efficiency in producing high-quality images. In our
approach, a Gaussian noise volume is transformed into an sCT image by
integrating a learned FM velocity field, conditioned on features extracted from
the input MRI or CBCT using a lightweight 3D encoder. We evaluated the method
on the SynthRAD2025 Challenge benchmark, training separate models for MRI
$\rightarrow$ sCT and CBCT $\rightarrow$ sCT across three anatomical regions:
abdomen, head and neck, and thorax. Validation and testing were performed
through the challenge submission system. The results indicate that the method
accurately reconstructs global anatomical structures; however, preservation of
fine details was limited, primarily due to the relatively low training
resolution imposed by memory and runtime constraints. Future work will explore
patch-based training and latent-space flow models to improve resolution and
local structural fidelity.

Motivation: 现有数据集蒸馏方法使用随机截断策略缺乏灵活性且效果不佳，神经网络在不同训练阶段具有不同的学习动态，需要更智能的截断方法。

Method: AT-BPTT框架包含三个关键组件：基于概率的阶段感知时间步选择机制、基于梯度变化的自适应窗口大小策略、以及低秩Hessian近似来降低计算开销。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现最先进性能，平均准确率比基线方法提高6.16%，内循环优化加速3.9倍，节省63%内存成本。

Conclusion: AT-BPTT通过动态适应梯度行为，有效解决了数据集蒸馏中截断策略的局限性，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升。

Abstract: The growing demand for efficient deep learning has positioned dataset
distillation as a pivotal technique for compressing training dataset while
preserving model performance. However, existing inner-loop optimization methods
for dataset distillation typically rely on random truncation strategies, which
lack flexibility and often yield suboptimal results. In this work, we observe
that neural networks exhibit distinct learning dynamics across different
training stages-early, middle, and late-making random truncation ineffective.
To address this limitation, we propose Automatic Truncated Backpropagation
Through Time (AT-BPTT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts both
truncation positions and window sizes according to intrinsic gradient behavior.
AT-BPTT introduces three key components: (1) a probabilistic mechanism for
stage-aware timestep selection, (2) an adaptive window sizing strategy based on
gradient variation, and (3) a low-rank Hessian approximation to reduce
computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that AT-BPTT achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving accuracy by an average of 6.16% over baseline methods.
Moreover, our approach accelerates inner-loop optimization by 3.9x while saving
63% memory cost.

Abstract: An accurate and up-to-date model of a photovoltaic (PV) power plant is
essential for its optimal operation and maintenance. However, such a model may
not be easily available. This work introduces a novel approach for PV power
plant mapping based on aerial overview images. It enables the automation of the
mapping process while removing the reliance on third-party data. The presented
mapping method takes advantage of the structural layout of the power plants to
achieve detailed modeling down to the level of individual PV modules. The
approach relies on visual segmentation of PV modules in overview images and the
inference of structural information in each image, assigning modules to
individual benches, rows, and columns. We identify visual keypoints related to
the layout and use these to merge detections from multiple images while
maintaining their structural integrity. The presented method was experimentally
verified and evaluated on two different power plants. The final fusion of 3D
positions and semantic structures results in a compact georeferenced model
suitable for power plant maintenance.

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic relationship between humans and the built
environment is a key challenge in disciplines ranging from environmental
psychology to reinforcement learning (RL). A central obstacle in modeling these
interactions is the inability to capture human psychological states in a way
that is both generalizable and privacy preserving. Traditional methods rely on
theoretical models or questionnaires, which are limited in scope, static, and
labor intensive. We present a kinesics recognition framework that infers the
communicative functions of human activity -- known as kinesics -- directly from
3D skeleton joint data. Combining a spatial-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) with a convolutional neural network (CNN), the framework
leverages transfer learning to bypass the need for manually defined mappings
between physical actions and psychological categories. The approach preserves
user anonymity while uncovering latent structures in bodily movements that
reflect cognitive and emotional states. Our results on the Dyadic User
EngagemenT (DUET) dataset demonstrate that this method enables scalable,
accurate, and human-centered modeling of behavior, offering a new pathway for
enhancing RL-driven simulations of human-environment interaction.

Motivation: 传统网络物理系统主要关注经济目标（如性能和安全性），但忽视了人类中心的社会效益。网络物理社会基础设施系统旨在通过将CPS与社会目标对齐来解决这一问题，需要理解人类互动及其与社会效益的联系。

Abstract: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) integrate sensing, computing, and control to
improve infrastructure performance, focusing on economic goals like performance
and safety. However, they often neglect potential human-centered (or
''social'') benefits. Cyber-physical-social infrastructure systems (CPSIS) aim
to address this by aligning CPS with social objectives. This involves defining
social benefits, understanding human interactions with each other and
infrastructure, developing privacy-preserving measurement methods, modeling
these interactions for prediction, linking them to social benefits, and
actuating the physical environment to foster positive social outcomes. This
paper delves into recognizing dyadic human interactions using real-world data,
which is the backbone to measuring social behavior. This lays a foundation to
address the need to enhance understanding of the deeper meanings and mutual
responses inherent in human interactions. While RGB cameras are informative for
interaction recognition, privacy concerns arise. Depth sensors offer a
privacy-conscious alternative by analyzing skeletal movements. This study
compares five skeleton-based interaction recognition algorithms on a dataset of
12 dyadic interactions. Unlike single-person datasets, these interactions,
categorized into communication types like emblems and affect displays, offer
insights into the cultural and emotional aspects of human interactions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络虽然性能优异，但计算成本高，难以应用于实时和边缘场景。需要开发压缩技术来降低计算复杂度，同时保持准确性。

Method: 将早期退出和知识蒸馏两种优化技术结合，训练学生早期退出模型从更复杂的教师早期退出模型学习。关键创新是在教师分类错误时使用新的熵损失函数。

Result: 在CIFAR10、CIFAR100和SVHN数据集上的实验验证了该方法能显著降低计算复杂度而不影响分类性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了准确性和效率，为知识蒸馏在其他场景的应用开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks and in particular Convolutional Neural Networks
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in image classification with
relatively high efficiency, they still exhibit high computational costs, often
rendering them impractical for real-time and edge applications. Therefore, a
multitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs
while maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been
introduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a
desirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed
method effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques:
early exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit
model is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary
contribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student
early-exit model. In comparison to the conventional Knowledge Distillation
loss, our approach incorporates a new entropy-based loss for images where the
teacher's classification was incorrect. The proposed method optimizes the
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, thereby achieving significant
reductions in computational complexity without compromising classification
performance. The validity of this approach is substantiated by experimental
results on image classification datasets CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and SVHN, which
further opens new research perspectives for Knowledge Distillation in other
contexts.

Abstract: Optical microscopy is one of the most widely used techniques in research
studies for life sciences and biomedicine. These applications require reliable
experimental pipelines to extract valuable knowledge from the measured samples
and must be supported by image quality assessment (IQA) to ensure correct
processing and analysis of the image data. IQA methods are implemented with
variable complexity. However, while most quality metrics have a straightforward
implementation, they might be time consuming and computationally expensive when
evaluating a large dataset. In addition, quality metrics are often designed for
well-defined image features and may be unstable for images out of the ideal
domain.
  To overcome these limitations, recent works have proposed deep learning-based
IQA methods, which can provide superior performance, increased generalizability
and fast prediction. Our method, named $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA, is inspired by
previous studies and applies a deep convolutional neural network designed for
IQA on natural images to optical microscopy measurements. We retrained the same
architecture to predict individual quality metrics and global quality scores
for optical microscopy data. The resulting models provide fast and stable
predictions of image quality by generalizing quality estimation even outside
the ideal range of standard methods. In addition, $\mathrm{\mu}$DeepIQA
provides patch-wise prediction of image quality and can be used to visualize
spatially varying quality in a single image. Our study demonstrates that
optical microscopy-based studies can benefit from the generalizability of deep
learning models due to their stable performance in the presence of outliers,
the ability to assess small image patches, and rapid predictions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个端到端的物联网机器人系统，用于葡萄园中葡萄产量和质量的非破坏性实时空间映射。系统包含葡萄串检测与重量估计模块，以及基于光照不变光谱自编码器(LISA)的质量评估模块，能有效克服光照变化带来的领域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决葡萄园中传统破坏性采样方法的局限性，实现实时、非破坏性的产量和质量监测。特别针对野外高光谱成像中光照变化导致的领域偏移问题，开发光照不变的特征学习方法。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end, IoT-enabled robotic system for the
non-destructive, real-time, and spatially-resolved mapping of grape yield and
quality (Brix, Acidity) in vineyards. The system features a comprehensive
analytical pipeline that integrates two key modules: a high-performance model
for grape bunch detection and weight estimation, and a novel deep learning
framework for quality assessment from hyperspectral (HSI) data. A critical
barrier to in-field HSI is the ``domain shift" caused by variable illumination.
To overcome this, our quality assessment is powered by the Light-Invariant
Spectral Autoencoder (LISA), a domain-adversarial framework that learns
illumination-invariant features from uncalibrated data. We validated the
system's robustness on a purpose-built HSI dataset spanning three distinct
illumination domains: controlled artificial lighting (lab), and variable
natural sunlight captured in the morning and afternoon. Results show the
complete pipeline achieves a recall (0.82) for bunch detection and a $R^2$
(0.76) for weight prediction, while the LISA module improves quality prediction
generalization by over 20% compared to the baselines. By combining these robust
modules, the system successfully generates high-resolution, georeferenced data
of both grape yield and quality, providing actionable, data-driven insights for
precision viticulture.

Abstract: Benthic habitat mapping is fundamental for understanding marine ecosystems,
guiding conservation efforts, and supporting sustainable resource management.
Yet, the scarcity of large, annotated datasets limits the development and
benchmarking of machine learning models in this domain. This paper introduces a
thorough multi-modal dataset, comprising about a million side-scan sonar (SSS)
tiles collected along the coast of Catalonia (Spain), complemented by
bathymetric maps and a set of co-registered optical images from targeted
surveys using an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). Approximately \num{36000}
of the SSS tiles have been manually annotated with segmentation masks to enable
supervised fine-tuning of classification models. All the raw sensor data,
together with mosaics, are also released to support further exploration and
algorithm development. To address challenges in multi-sensor data fusion for
AUVs, we spatially associate optical images with corresponding SSS tiles,
facilitating self-supervised, cross-modal representation learning. Accompanying
open-source preprocessing and annotation tools are provided to enhance
accessibility and encourage research. This resource aims to establish a
standardized benchmark for underwater habitat mapping, promoting advancements
in autonomous seafloor classification and multi-sensor integration.

### [263] [A Semantics-Aware Hierarchical Self-Supervised Approach to Classification of Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04916)
*Giulio Weikmann,Gianmarco Perantoni,Lorenzo Bruzzone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义感知层次共识方法，通过集成层次特定分类头和可训练层次矩阵，在深度网络中学习层次特征和关系，并引入层次共识机制确保不同层次概率分布的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在遥感图像分类中很重要，但现有的方法经常忽略预定义的标签层次结构，只关注细粒度分类方案，无法充分利用类别间的语义关系。

Method: 在深度网络架构中集成层次特定分类头，每个分类头专门处理不同粒度的类别；使用可训练层次矩阵以自监督方式学习层次结构；引入层次共识机制作为加权集成，确保不同层次概率分布的一致性。

Result: 在三个具有不同层次复杂度的基准数据集上评估，使用不同骨干架构，实验结果表明该方法在指导网络学习和层次共识的鲁棒性方面都有效。

Conclusion: SAHC方法能够有效利用层次分类任务的固有结构，在遥感图像分类任务中表现出良好的适应性和有效性。

Abstract: Deep learning has become increasingly important in remote sensing image
classification due to its ability to extract semantic information from complex
data. Classification tasks often include predefined label hierarchies that
represent the semantic relationships among classes. However, these hierarchies
are frequently overlooked, and most approaches focus only on fine-grained
classification schemes. In this paper, we present a novel Semantics-Aware
Hierarchical Consensus (SAHC) method for learning hierarchical features and
relationships by integrating hierarchy-specific classification heads within a
deep network architecture, each specialized in different degrees of class
granularity. The proposed approach employs trainable hierarchy matrices, which
guide the network through the learning of the hierarchical structure in a
self-supervised manner. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical consensus
mechanism to ensure consistent probability distributions across different
hierarchical levels. This mechanism acts as a weighted ensemble being able to
effectively leverage the inherent structure of the hierarchical classification
task. The proposed SAHC method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with
different degrees of hierarchical complexity on different tasks, using distinct
backbone architectures to effectively emphasize its adaptability. Experimental
results show both the effectiveness of the proposed approach in guiding network
learning and the robustness of the hierarchical consensus for remote sensing
image classification tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对医学图像分类的解剖学引导混合专家框架REN，通过七个专门针对不同肺叶的专家网络，结合多模态门控机制，在间质性肺病分类中实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE架构缺乏医学成像所需的领域特定约束，而解剖结构和区域疾病异质性对病理模式有重要影响，需要专门针对医学图像设计的解剖学引导框架。

Method: 利用解剖先验训练七个专门专家网络，每个专家负责不同肺叶和双侧肺组合；采用多模态门控机制动态整合放射组学生物标志物和深度学习特征来优化专家贡献权重。

Result: 在ILD分类中，放射组学引导的集成方法达到平均AUC 0.8646±0.0467，比SwinUNETR基线提升12.5%；下叶模型AUC达0.88-0.90，优于DL对应模型。

Conclusion: REN展示了强大的泛化能力和临床可解释性，为结构化医学成像应用提供了可扩展的解剖学引导方法。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have significantly contributed to
scalable machine learning by enabling specialized subnetworks to tackle complex
tasks efficiently. However, traditional MoE systems lack domain-specific
constraints essential for medical imaging, where anatomical structure and
regional disease heterogeneity strongly influence pathological patterns. Here,
we introduce Regional Expert Networks (REN), the first anatomically-informed
MoE framework tailored specifically for medical image classification. REN
leverages anatomical priors to train seven specialized experts, each dedicated
to distinct lung lobes and bilateral lung combinations, enabling precise
modeling of region-specific pathological variations. Multi-modal gating
mechanisms dynamically integrate radiomics biomarkers and deep learning (DL)
features (CNN, ViT, Mamba) to weight expert contributions optimally. Applied to
interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification, REN achieves consistently
superior performance: the radiomics-guided ensemble reached an average AUC of
0.8646 +/- 0.0467, a +12.5 percent improvement over the SwinUNETR baseline (AUC
0.7685, p = 0.031). Region-specific experts further revealed that lower-lobe
models achieved AUCs of 0.88-0.90, surpassing DL counterparts (CNN: 0.76-0.79)
and aligning with known disease progression patterns. Through rigorous
patient-level cross-validation, REN demonstrates strong generalizability and
clinical interpretability, presenting a scalable, anatomically-guided approach
readily extensible to other structured medical imaging applications.

### [265] [Unsupervised Active Learning via Natural Feature Progressive Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04939)
*Yuxi Liu,Catherine Lalman,Yimin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出NFPF框架，一种革命性的无监督主动学习方法，通过特定特征学习机器(SFLM)量化样本重要性，显著优于现有UAL方法，性能可与监督AL方法媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，主动学习(AL)虽能减少标注量但仍需迭代人工参与。无监督主动学习(UAL)将标注负担转移到单一后选择步骤，但现有UAL方法性能不足，存在对噪声数据敏感、无法充分代表数据分布等问题。

Method: 提出自然特征渐进框架(NFPF)，使用特定特征学习机器(SFLM)量化样本对模型性能的贡献，并定义重构差异度量进行初始样本选择。

Result: 在视觉数据集上，NFPF显著优于所有现有UAL方法，性能与监督AL方法相当。消融研究和定性可视化证明了其优越性能、增强的鲁棒性和改进的数据分布覆盖。

Conclusion: NFPF通过革命性的样本重要性度量方法，为无监督主动学习提供了有效的解决方案，在减少人工标注负担的同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of modern deep learning models is predicated on the
availability of large-scale, human-annotated datasets, a process that is
notoriously expensive and time-consuming. While Active Learning (AL) offers a
strategic solution by labeling only the most informative and representative
data, its iterative nature still necessitates significant human involvement.
Unsupervised Active Learning (UAL) presents an alternative by shifting the
annotation burden to a single, post-selection step. Unfortunately, prevailing
UAL methods struggle to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These approaches
typically rely on local, gradient-based scoring for sample importance
estimation, which not only makes them vulnerable to ambiguous and noisy data
but also hinders their capacity to select samples that adequately represent the
full data distribution. Moreover, their use of shallow, one-shot linear
selection falls short of a true UAL paradigm. In this paper, we propose the
Natural Feature Progressive Framework (NFPF), a UAL method that revolutionizes
how sample importance is measured. At its core, NFPF employs a Specific Feature
Learning Machine (SFLM) to effectively quantify each sample's contribution to
model performance. We further utilize the SFLM to define a powerful
Reconstruction Difference metric for initial sample selection. Our
comprehensive experiments show that NFPF significantly outperforms all
established UAL methods and achieves performance on par with supervised AL
methods on vision datasets. Detailed ablation studies and qualitative
visualizations provide compelling evidence for NFPF's superior performance,
enhanced robustness, and improved data distribution coverage.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CA3D-Diff是一个基于条件扩散模型的双向乳腺X光片视图转换框架，通过列感知交叉注意力和隐式3D结构重建来解决乳腺X光片中视图转换的结构不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实临床工作流中，乳腺X光片的CC和MLO视图可能因采集错误或压缩伪影而缺失或损坏，限制了后续分析的效能。视图间转换可以帮助恢复缺失视图并改善病灶对齐。

Method: 提出列感知交叉注意力机制，利用解剖对应区域在跨视图中位于相似列位置的几何特性；引入隐式3D结构重建模块，将噪声2D潜在特征反投影到基于乳腺视图投影几何的粗略3D特征体积中。

Result: CA3D-Diff在双向任务中实现了卓越性能，在视觉保真度和结构一致性方面优于最先进方法。合成的视图有效改善了筛查设置中的单视图恶性分类。

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界诊断中具有实际价值，能够通过视图转换提高乳腺X光片分析的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Dual-view mammography, including craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique
(MLO) projections, offers complementary anatomical views crucial for breast
cancer diagnosis. However, in real-world clinical workflows, one view may be
missing, corrupted, or degraded due to acquisition errors or compression
artifacts, limiting the effectiveness of downstream analysis. View-to-view
translation can help recover missing views and improve lesion alignment. Unlike
natural images, this task in mammography is highly challenging due to large
non-rigid deformations and severe tissue overlap in X-ray projections, which
obscure pixel-level correspondences. In this paper, we propose Column-Aware and
Implicit 3D Diffusion (CA3D-Diff), a novel bidirectional mammogram view
translation framework based on conditional diffusion model. To address
cross-view structural misalignment, we first design a column-aware
cross-attention mechanism that leverages the geometric property that
anatomically corresponding regions tend to lie in similar column positions
across views. A Gaussian-decayed bias is applied to emphasize local column-wise
correlations while suppressing distant mismatches. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit 3D structure reconstruction module that back-projects noisy 2D latents
into a coarse 3D feature volume based on breast-view projection geometry. The
reconstructed 3D structure is refined and injected into the denoising UNet to
guide cross-view generation with enhanced anatomical awareness. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that CA3D-Diff achieves superior performance in
bidirectional tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in visual fidelity
and structural consistency. Furthermore, the synthesized views effectively
improve single-view malignancy classification in screening settings,
demonstrating the practical value of our method in real-world diagnostics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSDD是一种新的像素扩散解码器架构，通过蒸馏技术实现单步重建，无需对抗性损失，在重建质量和采样速度上均优于传统的KL-VAE方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于KL-VAE的tokenizer需要对抗性损失，而扩散解码器虽然更原理化但需要迭代采样导致解码时间较长。为了解决这些限制，需要开发一种无需对抗性损失且能高效单步重建的扩散解码器。

Method: 提出新的像素扩散解码器架构，利用transformer组件和无GAN训练提高扩展性和训练稳定性。通过蒸馏技术将扩散解码器的性能复制到高效的单步解码器中。

Result: SSDD将重建FID从0.87提升到0.50，吞吐量提高1.4倍，同时保持DiTs的生成质量，采样速度提高3.8倍。

Conclusion: SSDD可以作为KL-VAE的直接替代品，用于构建更高质量和更快的生成模型。

Abstract: Tokenizers are a key component of state-of-the-art generative image models,
extracting the most important features from the signal while reducing data
dimension and redundancy. Most current tokenizers are based on KL-regularized
variational autoencoders (KL-VAE), trained with reconstruction, perceptual and
adversarial losses. Diffusion decoders have been proposed as a more principled
alternative to model the distribution over images conditioned on the latent.
However, matching the performance of KL-VAE still requires adversarial losses,
as well as a higher decoding time due to iterative sampling. To address these
limitations, we introduce a new pixel diffusion decoder architecture for
improved scaling and training stability, benefiting from transformer components
and GAN-free training. We use distillation to replicate the performance of the
diffusion decoder in an efficient single-step decoder. This makes SSDD the
first diffusion decoder optimized for single-step reconstruction trained
without adversarial losses, reaching higher reconstruction quality and faster
sampling than KL-VAE. In particular, SSDD improves reconstruction FID from
$0.87$ to $0.50$ with $1.4\times$ higher throughput and preserve generation
quality of DiTs with $3.8\times$ faster sampling. As such, SSDD can be used as
a drop-in replacement for KL-VAE, and for building higher-quality and faster
generative models.

Motivation: 视觉基础模型训练成本高昂，需要保护知识产权。不诚实用户可能非法重新分发模型副本，因此需要可靠的所有权验证工具来区分受保护模型的重新分发副本和独立模型。

Method: 微调视觉基础模型的少量表达层，结合小型编码器-解码器网络，在保留输入图像集的内部表示中嵌入数字水印。水印在模型功能副本（如下游任务微调后）中仍保持可检测性。

Result: 理论和实验证明，该方法对非水印模型的错误检测概率低，对水印模型的错误漏检概率也低。

Conclusion: 该方法为视觉基础模型提供了有效的所有权验证机制，即使模型被下游任务微调后，嵌入的水印仍能可靠检测，保护了模型所有者的知识产权。

Abstract: Being trained on large and vast datasets, visual foundation models (VFMs) can
be fine-tuned for diverse downstream tasks, achieving remarkable performance
and efficiency in various computer vision applications. The high computation
cost of data collection and training motivates the owners of some VFMs to
distribute them alongside the license to protect their intellectual property
rights. However, a dishonest user of the protected model's copy may illegally
redistribute it, for example, to make a profit. As a consequence, the
development of reliable ownership verification tools is of great importance
today, since such methods can be used to differentiate between a redistributed
copy of the protected model and an independent model. In this paper, we propose
an approach to ownership verification of visual foundation models by
fine-tuning a small set of expressive layers of a VFM along with a small
encoder-decoder network to embed digital watermarks into an internal
representation of a hold-out set of input images. Importantly, the watermarks
embedded remain detectable in the functional copies of the protected model,
obtained, for example, by fine-tuning the VFM for a particular downstream task.
Theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that the proposed method
yields a low probability of false detection of a non-watermarked model and a
low probability of false misdetection of a watermarked model.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的潜在不确定性表示方法（LUR和RLUR），通过转换层生成多个潜在表示来估计不确定性，在视频驾驶员行为识别任务中实现了与现有方法相当的分类性能，同时具有更好的OOD检测效果和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在安全关键任务中应用广泛，但现有最后一层概率深度学习方法在检测分布外实例时性能不稳定。需要一种更有效的不确定性估计方法来提高模型的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 在预训练DNN基础上添加转换层，生成多个潜在表示来估计不确定性。提出了LUR（潜在不确定性表示）和RLUR（排斥训练的LUR）两种方法。

Result: 在四个视频驾驶员行为识别数据集上的实验表明，LUR和RLUR实现了与其他方法相当的分布内分类性能。在不确定性OOD检测方面，LUR与最佳PDL方法表现相当，但训练更高效、调参更容易。

Conclusion: LUR方法在保持分类性能的同时，提供了更有效的不确定性估计，特别适合资源受限环境下的安全关键应用，且不需要复杂的MCMC采样或排斥训练过程。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly applied to safety-critical tasks
in resource-constrained environments, such as video-based driver action and
intention recognition. While last layer probabilistic deep learning (LL-PDL)
methods can detect out-of-distribution (OOD) instances, their performance
varies. As an alternative to last layer approaches, we propose extending
pre-trained DNNs with transformation layers to produce multiple latent
representations to estimate the uncertainty. We evaluate our latent uncertainty
representation (LUR) and repulsively trained LUR (RLUR) approaches against
eight PDL methods across four video-based driver action and intention
recognition datasets, comparing classification performance, calibration, and
uncertainty-based OOD detection. We also contribute 28,000 frame-level action
labels and 1,194 video-level intention labels for the NuScenes dataset. Our
results show that LUR and RLUR achieve comparable in-distribution
classification performance to other LL-PDL approaches. For uncertainty-based
OOD detection, LUR matches top-performing PDL methods while being more
efficient to train and easier to tune than approaches that require Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo sampling or repulsive training procedures.

Conclusion: 机器学习方法在帕金森病早期诊断中具有巨大潜力，为改善患者预后提供了非侵入性和经济有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition
characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons, leading to various movement
disorder symptoms. Early diagnosis of PD is crucial to prevent adverse effects,
yet traditional diagnostic methods are often cumbersome and costly. In this
study, a machine learning-based approach is proposed using hand-drawn spiral
and wave images as potential biomarkers for PD detection. Our methodology
leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs), transfer learning, and
attention mechanisms to improve model performance and resilience against
overfitting. To enhance the diversity and richness of both spiral and wave
categories, the training dataset undergoes augmentation to increase the number
of images. The proposed architecture comprises three phases: utilizing
pre-trained CNNs, incorporating custom convolutional layers, and ensemble
voting. Employing hard voting further enhances performance by aggregating
predictions from multiple models. Experimental results show promising accuracy
rates. For spiral images, weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are
90%, and for wave images, they are 96.67%. After combining the predictions
through ensemble hard voting, the overall accuracy is 93.3%. These findings
underscore the potential of machine learning in early PD diagnosis, offering a
non-invasive and cost-effective solution to improve patient outcomes.

Abstract: Video understanding represents the most challenging frontier in computer
vision, requiring models to reason about complex spatiotemporal relationships,
long-term dependencies, and multimodal evidence. The recent emergence of
Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders
with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that
transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated
reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature.
This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training
methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars:
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL)
from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced
inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the
roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques,
addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal
grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through
systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design
principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open
challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We
further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate
rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide
researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM
capabilities. Additional resources and updates are maintained at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种利用3D基础模型的空间理解能力来解决宽基线分割匹配问题的方法，在极端视角变化下实现了优于现有技术的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分割匹配作为计算机视觉中的重要中间任务，相比关键点匹配能够捕获结构化区域，对遮挡、光照变化和视角变化具有更强的鲁棒性。然而，宽基线分割匹配在极端视角变化下仍面临挑战。

Method: 提出了一种利用3D基础模型归纳偏置的架构，能够匹配视角变化高达180度的图像对中的分割区域。

Result: 在ScanNet++和Replica数据集上的实验表明，该方法在AUPRC指标上比最先进方法（包括SAM2视频传播器和局部特征匹配方法）提高了30%。

Conclusion: 该方法在相关下游任务（包括3D实例分割和图像目标导航）中展现出优势，证明了3D基础模型在分割匹配中的有效性。

Abstract: Segment matching is an important intermediate task in computer vision that
establishes correspondences between semantically or geometrically coherent
regions across images. Unlike keypoint matching, which focuses on localized
features, segment matching captures structured regions, offering greater
robustness to occlusions, lighting variations, and viewpoint changes. In this
paper, we leverage the spatial understanding of 3D foundation models to tackle
wide-baseline segment matching, a challenging setting involving extreme
viewpoint shifts. We propose an architecture that uses the inductive bias of
these 3D foundation models to match segments across image pairs with up to 180
degree view-point change. Extensive experiments show that our approach
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including the SAM2 video propagator and
local feature matching methods, by upto 30% on the AUPRC metric, on ScanNet++
and Replica datasets. We further demonstrate benefits of the proposed model on
relevant downstream tasks, including 3D instance segmentation and image-goal
navigation. Project Page: https://segmast3r.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对对比度失真图像的无参考图像质量评估方法，通过选择最合适的对比度增强算法生成伪参考图像，将无参考问题转化为全参考评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比度变化是影响图像质量的重要因素，但在图像质量评估中常被忽视。现有方法主要关注模糊和噪声等失真，而对比度失真的视觉影响和特性与传统失真不同

Method: 使用对比度增强算法生成视觉接近真实参考图像的伪参考图像，训练分类网络根据图像内容和失真选择最合适的对比度增强算法，在全参考模式下评估对比度增强图像与退化图像的质量差异

Result: 在包含对比度失真的三个数据库（CCID2014、TID2013和CSIQ）上的性能评估表明，该方法具有有前景的性能

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将无参考图像质量评估问题转化为全参考评估，提高了对比度失真图像质量评估的准确性

Abstract: Contrast change is an important factor that affects the quality of images.
During image capturing, unfavorable lighting conditions can cause contrast
change and visual quality loss. While various methods have been proposed to
assess the quality of images under different distortions such as blur and
noise, contrast distortion has been largely overlooked as its visual impact and
properties are different from other conventional types of distortions. In this
paper, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric for
contrast-distorted images. Using a set of contrast enhancement algorithms, we
aim to generate pseudo-reference images that are visually close to the actual
reference image, such that the NR problem is transformed to a Full-reference
(FR) assessment with higher accuracy. To this end, a large dataset of
contrast-enhanced images is produced to train a classification network that can
select the most suitable contrast enhancement algorithm based on image content
and distortion for pseudo-reference image generation. Finally, the evaluation
is performed in the FR manner to assess the quality difference between the
contrast-enhanced (pseudoreference) and degraded images. Performance evaluation
of the proposed method on three databases containing contrast distortions
(CCID2014, TID2013, and CSIQ), indicates the promising performance of the
proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要高效准确的废物分类和工业表面缺陷检测，以确保可持续废物管理和高质量控制标准。

Method: 结合ResNet-50进行局部特征提取，Vision Transformer捕获全局语义上下文，集成FAISS相似性检索，采用神经可塑性模块化设计，包含可扩展学习块，在训练性能停滞时动态增长。

Result: 在废物分类和KolektorSDD2工业缺陷检测数据集上，该架构在准确性和适应性方面均优于传统静态模型。

Conclusion: Neuroplastic Modular Classifier为现实世界图像分类提供了可扩展的高性能解决方案，在环境和工业领域具有强适用性。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate classification of waste and industrial surface defects
is essential for ensuring sustainable waste management and maintaining high
standards in quality control. This paper introduces the Neuroplastic Modular
Classifier, a novel hybrid architecture designed for robust and adaptive image
classification in dynamic environments. The model combines a ResNet-50 backbone
for localized feature extraction with a Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture
global semantic context. Additionally, FAISS-based similarity retrieval is
incorporated to provide a memory-like reference to previously encountered data,
enriching the model's feature space. A key innovation of our architecture is
the neuroplastic modular design composed of expandable, learnable blocks that
dynamically grow during training when performance plateaus. Inspired by
biological learning systems, this mechanism allows the model to adapt to data
complexity over time, improving generalization. Beyond garbage classification,
we validate the model on the Kolektor Surface Defect Dataset 2 (KolektorSDD2),
which involves industrial defect detection on metal surfaces. Experimental
results across domains show that the proposed architecture outperforms
traditional static models in both accuracy and adaptability. The Neuroplastic
Modular Classifier offers a scalable, high-performance solution for real-world
image classification, with strong applicability in both environmental and
industrial domains.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个针对结构化视觉内容（如图表、图表、数学图形）生成和编辑的统一框架，包括大规模数据集构建、模型训练和评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉生成模型在生成自然图像方面表现出色，但在处理需要构图规划、文本渲染和多模态推理的结构化视觉内容时表现不佳。

Method: 构建了130万高质量结构化图像对数据集，训练了一个集成VLM和FLUX.1 Kontext的统一模型，采用三阶段训练课程，并在推理时使用外部推理器增强性能。

Result: 评估了15个模型，发现即使是领先的闭源系统也远未达到满意水平。本文模型在编辑任务上表现强劲，推理时推理在不同架构中带来一致增益。

Conclusion: 通过发布数据集、模型和基准，旨在推进结构化视觉内容的统一多模态基础研究。

Abstract: While modern visual generation models excel at creating aesthetically
pleasing natural images, they struggle with producing or editing structured
visuals like charts, diagrams, and mathematical figures, which demand
composition planning, text rendering, and multimodal reasoning for factual
fidelity. To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic
investigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training,
and an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3
million high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing
programs and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on
it, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a
lightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage
training curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion,
and reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at
inference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for
generation and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an
accompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\&A
protocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models
reveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory.
Our model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning
yields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset,
model, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for
structured visuals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在文本到视频生成中实现不同世界角色的自然交互，同时保持每个角色的身份特征和行为逻辑，避免风格混淆问题。

Method: 使用跨角色嵌入（CCE）从多模态源学习身份和行为逻辑，以及跨角色增强（CCA）通过合成共存和混合风格数据来丰富训练。

Result: 在包含10个角色的卡通和真人系列基准测试中，在身份保持、交互质量和风格一致性方面显示出明显改进。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现先前不共存角色之间的自然交互，同时保持风格保真度，为生成式故事讲述开辟了新形式。

Abstract: Imagine Mr. Bean stepping into Tom and Jerry--can we generate videos where
characters interact naturally across different worlds? We study inter-character
interaction in text-to-video generation, where the key challenge is to preserve
each character's identity and behaviors while enabling coherent cross-context
interaction. This is difficult because characters may never have coexisted and
because mixing styles often causes style delusion, where realistic characters
appear cartoonish or vice versa. We introduce a framework that tackles these
issues with Cross-Character Embedding (CCE), which learns identity and
behavioral logic across multimodal sources, and Cross-Character Augmentation
(CCA), which enriches training with synthetic co-existence and mixed-style
data. Together, these techniques allow natural interactions between previously
uncoexistent characters without losing stylistic fidelity. Experiments on a
curated benchmark of cartoons and live-action series with 10 characters show
clear improvements in identity preservation, interaction quality, and
robustness to style delusion, enabling new forms of generative
storytelling.Additional results and videos are available on our project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VChain是一个推理时视觉思维链框架，通过多模态模型生成关键帧来指导视频生成，提升复杂动态场景的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在合成复杂动态和连贯因果链方面存在困难，而大型多模态模型具有较强的视觉状态推理能力，需要将两者优势结合。

Method: 利用大型多模态模型生成稀疏关键帧作为快照，然后在推理时仅在关键时刻对预训练视频生成器进行稀疏调优。

Result: 在复杂多步骤场景的广泛实验中，VChain显著提升了生成视频的质量。

Conclusion: VChain通过注入视觉推理信号，实现了调优高效、开销最小且无需密集监督的视频生成改进。

Abstract: Recent video generation models can produce smooth and visually appealing
clips, but they often struggle to synthesize complex dynamics with a coherent
chain of consequences. Accurately modeling visual outcomes and state
transitions over time remains a core challenge. In contrast, large language and
multimodal models (e.g., GPT-4o) exhibit strong visual state reasoning and
future prediction capabilities. To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain,
a novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual
reasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically,
VChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to
generate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used
to guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only
at these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal
overhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex,
multi-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of
generated videos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术演示视频制作耗时费力，需要协调多种模态信息（文本、图表、表格）和多个对齐通道（幻灯片、字幕、语音、说话人），传统方法效率低下。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，集成幻灯片生成与布局优化、光标定位、字幕生成、语音合成和说话人渲染，采用并行化幻灯片生成提高效率。

Result: 在Paper2Video数据集上的实验表明，该方法生成的演示视频比现有基线更忠实和内容丰富。

Conclusion: 该工作为自动化、即用型学术视频生成迈出了实际一步，提供了数据集、智能体和代码资源。

Abstract: Academic presentation videos have become an essential medium for research
communication, yet producing them remains highly labor-intensive, often
requiring hours of slide design, recording, and editing for a short 2 to 10
minutes video. Unlike natural video, presentation video generation involves
distinctive challenges: inputs from research papers, dense multi-modal
information (text, figures, tables), and the need to coordinate multiple
aligned channels such as slides, subtitles, speech, and human talker. To
address these challenges, we introduce PaperTalker, the first benchmark of 101
research papers paired with author-created presentation videos, slides, and
speaker metadata. We further design four tailored evaluation metrics--Meta
Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory--to measure how videos
convey the paper's information to the audience. Building on this foundation, we
propose PaperTalker, the first multi-agent framework for academic presentation
video generation. It integrates slide generation with effective layout
refinement by a novel effective tree search visual choice, cursor grounding,
subtitling, speech synthesis, and talking-head rendering, while parallelizing
slide-wise generation for efficiency. Experiments on Paper2Video demonstrate
that the presentation videos produced by our approach are more faithful and
informative than existing baselines, establishing a practical step toward
automated and ready-to-use academic video generation. Our dataset, agent, and
code are available at https://github.com/showlab/Paper2Video.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统评估框架来测试大型语言模型的自我识别能力，发现10个当代LLM在识别自身生成文本方面表现不佳，仅有4个模型能正确识别自己，且性能很少超过随机机会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对AI系统是否具备自我识别能力存在矛盾解释，本文旨在通过系统评估框架澄清这一问题，这对AI安全特别是评估场景具有重要意义。

Method: 设计了二元自我识别和精确模型预测两个任务，测试10个当代大型语言模型识别自身生成文本与其他模型文本的能力。

Result: 结果显示模型自我识别能力普遍失败，仅有4/10模型能正确识别自己，性能很少超过随机水平。模型还表现出强烈偏向GPT和Claude家族的偏见。

Conclusion: 研究发现LLM缺乏可靠的自我识别能力，但具备一定的自我和他人存在意识。模型推理中显示出层级偏见，常将高质量文本与GPT、Claude等顶级模型关联。这对AI安全和开发适当的AI自我意识具有重要启示。

Abstract: Self-recognition is a crucial metacognitive capability for AI systems,
relevant not only for psychological analysis but also for safety, particularly
in evaluative scenarios. Motivated by contradictory interpretations of whether
models possess self-recognition (Panickssery et al., 2024; Davidson et al.,
2024), we introduce a systematic evaluation framework that can be easily
applied and updated. Specifically, we measure how well 10 contemporary larger
language models (LLMs) can identify their own generated text versus text from
other models through two tasks: binary self-recognition and exact model
prediction. Different from prior claims, our results reveal a consistent
failure in self-recognition. Only 4 out of 10 models predict themselves as
generators, and the performance is rarely above random chance. Additionally,
models exhibit a strong bias toward predicting GPT and Claude families. We also
provide the first evaluation of model awareness of their own and others'
existence, as well as the reasoning behind their choices in self-recognition.
We find that the model demonstrates some knowledge of its own existence and
other models, but their reasoning reveals a hierarchical bias. They appear to
assume that GPT, Claude, and occasionally Gemini are the top-tier models, often
associating high-quality text with them. We conclude by discussing the
implications of our findings on AI safety and future directions to develop
appropriate AI self-awareness.

Motivation: 现有方法大多在轮次层面评估对话质量，无法判断用户的整体目标是否达成，需要更全面的目标导向评估框架。

Method: 通过用户目标分割对话，使用教师LLM结合专家定义的质量标准进行评估，利用"思考标记"生成可解释的推理过程。

Conclusion: 该框架具有通用性，通过详细的缺陷分类提供可操作的见解，帮助诊断系统成功率和识别关键失败模式。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of multi-turn chatbot interactions remains
challenging, as most existing methods assess interactions at the turn level
without addressing whether a user's overarching goal was fulfilled. A ``goal''
here refers to an information need or task, such as asking for policy
information or applying for leave. We propose a comprehensive framework for
goal-oriented evaluation of multi-agent systems (MAS), introducing the
\textbf{Goal Success Rate (GSR)} to measure the percentage of fulfilled goals,
and a \textbf{Root Cause of Failure (RCOF)} taxonomy to identify reasons for
failure in multi-agent chatbots. Our method segments conversations by user
goals and evaluates success using all relevant turns. We present a model-based
evaluation system combining teacher LLMs, where domain experts define goals,
set quality standards serving as a guidance for the LLMs. The LLMs use
``thinking tokens'' to produce interpretable rationales, enabling
\textit{explainable}, \textit{data-efficient} evaluations. In an enterprise
setting, we apply our framework to evaluate AIDA, a zero-to-one employee
conversational agent system built as a ground-up multi-agent conversational
agent, and observe GSR improvement from 63\% to 79\% over six months since its
inception. Our framework is generic and offers actionable insights through a
detailed defect taxonomy based on analysis of failure points in multi-agent
chatbots, diagnosing overall success, identifying key failure modes, and
informing system improvements.

Motivation: 受人类通过多感官整合理解世界的启发，当前的多模态基础模型在作为世界模型方面存在不足，缺乏反事实推理、动态模拟、时空信息理解等关键能力。

Method: 1. 通过判别任务增强推理能力，赋予结构化推理技能（因果推理、反事实思考、时空推理）；2. 探索图像和视频模态的生成能力，引入结构化可控生成框架，结合场景图、多模态条件化和对齐策略；3. 扩展到可控4D生成，实现时空交互式可编辑对象合成。

Conclusion: 通过系统性地增强推理和生成能力，成功缩小了多模态基础模型与世界模型之间的差距，为构建更智能的多模态系统提供了有效路径。

Abstract: Humans understand the world through the integration of multiple sensory
modalities, enabling them to perceive, reason about, and imagine dynamic
physical processes. Inspired by this capability, multimodal foundation models
(MFMs) have emerged as powerful tools for multimodal understanding and
generation. However, today's MFMs fall short of serving as effective world
models. They lack the essential ability such as perform counterfactual
reasoning, simulate dynamics, understand the spatiotemporal information,
control generated visual outcomes, and perform multifaceted reasoning. We
investigates what it takes to bridge the gap between multimodal foundation
models and world models. We begin by improving the reasoning capabilities of
MFMs through discriminative tasks and equipping MFMs with structured reasoning
skills, such as causal inference, counterfactual thinking, and spatiotemporal
reasoning, enabling them to go beyond surface correlations and understand
deeper relationships within visual and textual data. Next, we explore
generative capabilities of multimodal foundation models across both image and
video modalities, introducing new frameworks for structured and controllable
generation. Our approaches incorporate scene graphs, multimodal conditioning,
and multimodal alignment strategies to guide the generation process, ensuring
consistency with high-level semantics and fine-grained user intent. We further
extend these techniques to controllable 4D generation, enabling interactive,
editable, and morphable object synthesis over time and space.

Abstract: We present a gamified explainable AI (XAI) system for ethically aware
consumer decision-making in the coffee domain. Each session comprises six
rounds with three options per round. Two symbolic engines provide real-time
reasons: a Kantian module flags rule violations (e.g., child labor,
deforestation risk without shade certification, opaque supply chains, unsafe
decaf), and a utilitarian module scores options via multi-criteria aggregation
over normalized attributes (price, carbon, water, transparency, farmer income
share, taste/freshness, packaging, convenience). A meta-explainer with a regret
bound (0.2) highlights Kantian--utilitarian (mis)alignment and switches to a
deontically clean, near-parity option when welfare loss is small. We release a
structured configuration (attribute schema, certification map, weights, rule

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有创造力评估框架碎片化，缺乏理论依据，无法全面评估基础模型的创造力表现。

Method: 引入C^2-Eval基准，区分收敛性创造力（约束性任务如代码生成）和发散性创造力（开放性任务如故事创作），基于社会心理学理论从有用性、原创性和惊喜度三个维度进行评估。

Result: 通过对领先专有和开源模型的广泛实验，分析了它们在创造力能力上的权衡，揭示了当前基础模型在追求创造性机器智能方面的优势和挑战。

Conclusion: C^2-Eval为审视创造性AI不断发展的格局提供了有效视角，能够全面评估基础模型的创造力表现。

Abstract: The meteoric rise of foundation models (FMs) has expanded their capabilities
far beyond conventional tasks. Creativity, long regarded as a hallmark of human
intelligence and a driver of innovation, is now increasingly recognized as a
critical dimension of machine intelligence in the era of generative FMs,
complementing traditional measures of accuracy. However, existing evaluation
frameworks for creativity remain fragmented, relying on ad hoc metrics not
firmly grounded in established theories. To address this gap, we introduce
C^2-Eval, a holistic benchmark for unified assessment of creativity in FMs.
C^2-Eval distinguishes between two complementary forms of creativity:
convergent creativity, where tasks admit constrained solutions (e.g., code
generation), and divergent creativity, where tasks are open-ended (e.g.,
storytelling). It evaluates both dimensions using fine-grained criteria derived
from social-science theory, focusing on Usefulness, Originality, and Surprise
(U-O-S). Through extensive experiments on leading proprietary and open-source
models, we analyze trade-offs in their creative capabilities. Our results
highlight both the strengths and challenges of current FMs in pursuing a
creative machine mind, showing that C^2-Eval is an effective lens for examining
the evolving landscape of creative AI.

TL;DR: 本文首次提出了数据科学智能体的生命周期分类法，系统分析了45个系统在数据科学六个阶段的能力分布，并识别了当前研究在业务理解、部署监控以及信任安全机制方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，出现了能够自动化数据科学工作流程的新型AI智能体，但缺乏对这些系统的系统性分类和分析框架。

Method: 构建了首个面向生命周期的数据科学智能体分类法，从六个数据科学阶段和五个设计维度对45个系统进行系统映射和分析。

Result: 发现大多数系统侧重于探索性分析和建模，而忽视了业务理解、部署和监控；多模态推理和工具编排仍是挑战；90%以上系统缺乏明确的信任安全机制。

Conclusion: 提出了未来研究方向，包括对齐稳定性、可解释性、治理框架和鲁棒评估体系，以指导开发更可靠、可信赖的数据科学智能体。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
AI agents that automate multiple stages of the data science workflow by
integrating planning, tool use, and multimodal reasoning across text, code,
tables, and visuals. This survey presents the first comprehensive,
lifecycle-aligned taxonomy of data science agents, systematically analyzing and
mapping forty-five systems onto the six stages of the end-to-end data science
process: business understanding and data acquisition, exploratory analysis and
visualization, feature engineering, model building and selection,
interpretation and explanation, and deployment and monitoring. In addition to
lifecycle coverage, we annotate each agent along five cross-cutting design
dimensions: reasoning and planning style, modality integration, tool
orchestration depth, learning and alignment methods, and trust, safety, and
governance mechanisms. Beyond classification, we provide a critical synthesis
of agent capabilities, highlight strengths and limitations at each stage, and
review emerging benchmarks and evaluation practices. Our analysis identifies
three key trends: most systems emphasize exploratory analysis, visualization,
and modeling while neglecting business understanding, deployment, and
monitoring; multimodal reasoning and tool orchestration remain unresolved
challenges; and over 90% lack explicit trust and safety mechanisms. We conclude
by outlining open challenges in alignment stability, explainability,
governance, and robust evaluation frameworks, and propose future research
directions to guide the development of robust, trustworthy, low-latency,
transparent, and broadly accessible data science agents.

*Dmitrii Troitskii,Koyena Pal,Chris Wendler,Callum Stuart McDougall,Neel Nanda*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究了推理模型中等待令牌（wait tokens）的作用机制，通过训练跨编码器和潜在归因技术，识别出影响等待令牌概率的关键特征，并验证这些特征对推理过程的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解为什么模型会在推理过程中产生等待令牌这一复杂行为，以及这些行为如何影响模型的推理效果，从而揭示推理模型高效工作的内在机制。

Method: 在DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B及其基础版本的多个层训练跨编码器，引入潜在归因技术，定位影响等待令牌概率的关键特征集，并通过最大激活示例分析和因果干预实验进行验证。

Result: 识别出一小部分与促进/抑制等待令牌概率相关的特征，这些特征确实与推理过程相关，并产生不同类型的推理模式，如从头重新开始、回忆先验知识、表达不确定性和双重检查。

Conclusion: 模型在等待令牌之前的潜在状态包含调节后续推理过程的相关信息，这些信息对于理解推理模型的工作机制具有重要意义。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that a significant driver of performance in reasoning
models is their ability to reason and self-correct. A distinctive marker in
these reasoning traces is the token wait, which often signals reasoning
behavior such as backtracking. Despite being such a complex behavior, little is
understood of exactly why models do or do not decide to reason in this
particular manner, which limits our understanding of what makes a reasoning
model so effective. In this work, we address the question whether model's
latents preceding wait tokens contain relevant information for modulating the
subsequent reasoning process. We train crosscoders at multiple layers of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B and its base version, and introduce a latent
attribution technique in the crosscoder setting. We locate a small set of
features relevant for promoting/suppressing wait tokens' probabilities.
Finally, through a targeted series of experiments analyzing max activating
examples and causal interventions, we show that many of our identified features
indeed are relevant for the reasoning process and give rise to different types
of reasoning patterns such as restarting from the beginning, recalling prior
knowledge, expressing uncertainty, and double-checking.

TL;DR: 本文提出MENTOR框架，通过只在关键决策点提供专家指导，在强化学习验证奖励中实现有效且多样化的探索，解决了现有方法只关注有效性而忽视多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法依赖基础模型能力，需要高质量探索（兼顾有效性和多样性），但现有方法通过模仿专家轨迹只改善了有效性而忽视了多样性。

Method: 提出MENTOR框架，基于专家只需在关键决策点提供指导的洞察，采用混合策略专家导航进行令牌级推理优化。

Result: 大量实验表明，MENTOR使模型能够捕捉专家策略的本质而非表面模仿，从而实现高质量探索并获得优越的整体性能。

Conclusion: MENTOR框架通过在关键决策点提供专家指导，成功解决了RLVR中探索的多样性问题，实现了更优的性能表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a widely
adopted technique for enhancing the reasoning ability of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the effectiveness of RLVR strongly depends on the capability
of base models. This issue arises because it requires the model to have
sufficient capability to perform high-quality exploration, which involves both
effectiveness and diversity. Unfortunately, existing methods address this issue
by imitating expert trajectories, which improve effectiveness but neglect
diversity. To address this, we argue that the expert only needs to provide
guidance only at critical decision points rather than the entire reasoning
path. Based on this insight, we propose MENTOR: Mixed-policy Expert Navigation
for Token-level Optimization of Reasoning, a framework that provides expert
guidance only at critical decision points to perform effective and diverse
exploration in RLVR. Extensive experiments show that MENTOR enables models
capture the essence of expert strategies rather than surface imitation, thereby
performing high-quality exploration and achieving superior overall performance.
Our code is available online.

*Mohsen Hariri,Amirhossein Samandar,Michael Hinczewski,Vipin Chaudhary*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个贝叶斯评估框架来替代Pass@k，通过后验概率估计和可信区间提供更稳定的模型排名，在有限计算资源下实现更可靠的比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Pass@k在LLM推理评估中广泛使用，但在有限试验次数和计算约束下会产生不稳定、误导性的排名结果。

Method: 使用贝叶斯方法，将评估结果建模为分类变量（而非0/1），采用狄利克雷先验，为任何加权评分标准提供后验均值和不确定性的闭式表达式。

Result: 在模拟实验和AIME'24/'25、HMMT'25、BrUMO'25等数据集上，贝叶斯方法比Pass@k及其变体实现更快的收敛速度和更好的排名稳定性。

Conclusion: 推荐用基于后验概率的计算高效协议替代Pass@k，统一二元和非二元评估，同时明确不确定性。

Abstract: Pass$@k$ is widely used to report performance for LLM reasoning, but it often
yields unstable, misleading rankings, especially when the number of trials
(samples) is limited and compute is constrained. We present a principled
Bayesian evaluation framework that replaces Pass$@k$ and average accuracy over
$N$ trials (avg$@N$) with posterior estimates of a model's underlying success
probability and credible intervals, yielding stable rankings and a transparent
decision rule for differences. Evaluation outcomes are modeled as categorical
(not just 0/1) with a Dirichlet prior, giving closed-form expressions for the
posterior mean and uncertainty of any weighted rubric and enabling the use of
prior evidence when appropriate. Theoretically, under a uniform prior, the
Bayesian posterior mean is order-equivalent to average accuracy (Pass$@1$),
explaining its empirical robustness while adding principled uncertainty.
Empirically, in simulations with known ground-truth success rates and on
AIME'24/'25, HMMT'25, and BrUMO'25, the Bayesian/avg procedure achieves faster
convergence and greater rank stability than Pass$@k$ and recent variants,
enabling reliable comparisons at far smaller sample counts. The framework
clarifies when observed gaps are statistically meaningful (non-overlapping
credible intervals) versus noise, and it naturally extends to graded,
rubric-based evaluations. Together, these results recommend replacing Pass$@k$
for LLM evaluation and ranking with a posterior-based, compute-efficient
protocol that unifies binary and non-binary evaluation while making uncertainty
explicit. Code is available at https://mohsenhariri.github.io/bayes-kit

*Saurabh Ranjan,Brian Odegaard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过心理网络分析比较人类和大型语言模型的内部世界模型，发现两者在想象力网络结构上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索想象力的计算目标，挑战传统认为想象力主要用于最大化奖励的观点，提出想象力是访问内部世界模型的方式。

Method: 使用两个问卷评估想象力生动度，构建想象力网络，分析网络中心性指标的相关性，比较人类和LLM在不同提示和对话记忆条件下的表现。

Result: 人类想象力网络显示不同中心性指标之间存在相关性，而LLM的想象力网络缺乏聚类且中心性指标相关性较低。

Conclusion: 人类和LLM的内部世界模型缺乏相似性，研究为开发具有人类般想象力的AI提供了新方法和见解。

Abstract: What is the computational objective of imagination? While classical
interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent
findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves
to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis
to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we
assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed
imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups
showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected
influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs
showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures
under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these
results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents.
Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated
representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like
imagination in artificial intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TraitBasis是一种轻量级、模型无关的方法，通过系统性地压力测试AI代理来评估其鲁棒性。该方法在激活空间中学习可操控的用户特征方向，无需微调即可在推理时控制、缩放和组合这些特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对话AI代理的鲁棒性测试不足，用户行为的微小变化（如更不耐烦、语无伦次或怀疑）会导致性能急剧下降，而现有基准测试无法捕捉这种脆弱性。

Method: TraitBasis在激活空间中学习可操控的用户特征方向，这些特征向量可以在推理时被控制、缩放和组合，无需额外微调或数据。该方法扩展了τ-Bench到τ-Trait，通过受控特征向量改变用户行为。

Result: 在τ-Trait基准测试中，前沿模型的性能平均下降了2%-30%，突显了当前AI代理对用户行为变化的鲁棒性不足。

Conclusion: TraitBasis作为一种简单、数据高效且可组合的工具，为模拟驱动的压力测试和训练循环提供了可能，有助于构建在真实世界人类互动不可预测动态中保持可靠的AI代理。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in building conversational AI agents, robustness is
still largely untested. Small shifts in user behavior, such as being more
impatient, incoherent, or skeptical, can cause sharp drops in agent
performance, revealing how brittle current AI agents are. Today's benchmarks
fail to capture this fragility: agents may perform well under standard
evaluations but degrade spectacularly in more realistic and varied settings. We
address this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight,
model-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis
learns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits
(e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed,
and applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data. Using
TraitBasis, we extend $\tau$-Bench to $\tau$-Trait, where user behaviors are
altered via controlled trait vectors. We observe on average a 2%-30%
performance degradation on $\tau$-Trait across frontier models, highlighting
the lack of robustness of current AI agents to variations in user behavior.
Together, these results highlight both the critical role of robustness testing
and the promise of TraitBasis as a simple, data-efficient, and compositional
tool. By powering simulation-driven stress tests and training loops, TraitBasis
opens the door to building AI agents that remain reliable in the unpredictable
dynamics of real-world human interactions. We have open-sourced $\tau$-Trai
across four domains: airline, retail, telecom, and telehealth, so the community
can systematically QA their agents under realistic, behaviorally diverse
intents and trait scenarios: https://github.com/collinear-ai/tau-trait.

*Rachneet Kaur,Nishan Srishankar,Zhen Zeng,Sumitra Ganesh,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChartAgent是一个新颖的代理框架，通过在图表空间域直接进行视觉推理来解决未标注图表理解问题，超越了依赖文本捷径的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态LLM在基于图表的视觉问答中表现良好，但在需要精确视觉解释的未标注图表上性能急剧下降，无法依赖文本捷径。

Method: ChartAgent迭代地将查询分解为视觉子任务，通过专门的视觉工具（如绘制注释、裁剪区域、定位坐标轴）主动操作和交互图表图像。

Result: 在ChartBench和ChartX基准测试中达到最先进准确率，整体绝对增益达16.07%，在未标注数值密集型查询上增益达17.31%。

Conclusion: ChartAgent是首批使用工具增强多模态代理进行视觉基础推理的图表理解方法，在多样化图表类型和复杂性级别上均表现优异。

Abstract: Recent multimodal LLMs have shown promise in chart-based visual question
answering, but their performance declines sharply on unannotated charts, those
requiring precise visual interpretation rather than relying on textual
shortcuts. To address this, we introduce ChartAgent, a novel agentic framework
that explicitly performs visual reasoning directly within the chart's spatial
domain. Unlike textual chain-of-thought reasoning, ChartAgent iteratively
decomposes queries into visual subtasks and actively manipulates and interacts
with chart images through specialized actions such as drawing annotations,
cropping regions (e.g., segmenting pie slices, isolating bars), and localizing
axes, using a library of chart-specific vision tools to fulfill each subtask.
This iterative reasoning process closely mirrors human cognitive strategies for
chart comprehension. ChartAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the
ChartBench and ChartX benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by up to 16.07%
absolute gain overall and 17.31% on unannotated, numerically intensive queries.
Furthermore, our analyses show that ChartAgent is (a) effective across diverse
chart types, (b) achieve the highest scores across varying visual and reasoning
complexity levels, and (c) serves as a plug-and-play framework that boosts
performance across diverse underlying LLMs. Our work is among the first to
demonstrate visually grounded reasoning for chart understanding using
tool-augmented multimodal agents.

TL;DR: 研究发现VLM驾驶代理中的推理与规划存在因果脱节，推理只是训练的副产品而非因果中介，规划主要依赖先验知识而非推理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证VLM驾驶代理中轨迹规划是否真正由自然语言推理因果驱动，这一关键假设尚未得到验证。

Method: 构建DriveMind大规模驾驶VQA语料库，通过信息消融实验分离先验知识和待推理信号，训练VLM代理并评估其因果连接性。

Result: 移除先验知识导致规划分数大幅下降，而移除推理链仅产生微小变化，证明推理与规划存在因果脱节。

Conclusion: 提出推理-规划解耦假说，推理是训练的副产品而非因果中介，并提供数据集和诊断工具评估未来模型的因果保真度。

Abstract: Vision-Language Model (VLM) driving agents promise explainable end-to-end
autonomy by first producing natural-language reasoning and then predicting
trajectory planning. However, whether planning is causally driven by this
reasoning remains a critical but unverified assumption. To investigate this, we
build DriveMind, a large-scale driving Visual Question Answering (VQA) corpus
with plan-aligned Chain-of-Thought (CoT), automatically generated from nuPlan.
Our data generation process converts sensors and annotations into structured
inputs and, crucially, separates priors from to-be-reasoned signals, enabling
clean information ablations. Using DriveMind, we train representative VLM
agents with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) and evaluate them with nuPlan's metrics. Our results, unfortunately,
indicate a consistent causal disconnect in reasoning-planning: removing
ego/navigation priors causes large drops in planning scores, whereas removing
CoT produces only minor changes. Attention analysis further shows that planning
primarily focuses on priors rather than the CoT. Based on this evidence, we
propose the Reasoning-Planning Decoupling Hypothesis, positing that the
training-yielded reasoning is an ancillary byproduct rather than a causal
mediator. To enable efficient diagnosis, we also introduce a novel,
training-free probe that measures an agent's reliance on priors by evaluating
its planning robustness against minor input perturbations. In summary, we
provide the community with a new dataset and a diagnostic tool to evaluate the
causal fidelity of future models.

TL;DR: BrokenMath是首个评估LLM在自然语言定理证明中谄媚行为的基准，发现GPT-5等先进模型有29%的概率产生谄媚回答，现有缓解策略能减少但不能完全消除该行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准主要关注最终答案问题，数据集简单且可能被污染，无法有效评估LLM在定理证明中的谄媚行为，限制了LLM在定理证明中的应用。

Method: 从2025年竞赛问题构建BrokenMath基准，使用LLM扰动产生错误陈述并通过专家评审精炼，采用LLM作为评判框架评估先进模型和代理系统。

Result: 发现谄媚行为普遍存在，最佳模型GPT-5有29%的概率产生谄媚回答。测试时干预和监督微调等缓解策略能显著减少但不能完全消除谄媚行为。

Conclusion: LLM在数学定理证明中存在显著谄媚行为，需要更有效的缓解策略，BrokenMath为评估和改进LLM在数学推理中的可靠性提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on
mathematical benchmarks. At the same time, they are prone to hallucination and
sycophancy, often providing convincing but flawed proofs for incorrect
mathematical statements provided by users. This significantly limits the
applicability of LLMs in theorem proving, as verification of these flawed
proofs must be done manually by expert mathematicians. However, existing
benchmarks that measure sycophancy in mathematics are limited: they focus
solely on final-answer problems, rely on very simple and often contaminated
datasets, and construct benchmark samples using synthetic modifications that
create ill-posed questions rather than well-posed questions that are
demonstrably false. To address these issues, we introduce BrokenMath, the first
benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in LLMs within the context of
natural language theorem proving. BrokenMath is built from advanced 2025
competition problems, which are perturbed with an LLM to produce false
statements and subsequently refined through expert review. Using an
LLM-as-a-judge framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs and agentic systems
and find that sycophancy is widespread, with the best model, GPT-5, producing
sycophantic answers 29% of the time. We further investigate several mitigation
strategies, including test-time interventions and supervised fine-tuning on
curated sycophantic examples. These approaches substantially reduce, but do not
eliminate, sycophantic behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在简单任务中倾向于过度分析，导致令牌生成效率低下，且由于预训练数据的静态性难以适应快速变化的环境。

Method: 提出MARS多智能体系统，整合Google搜索、Google学术和Python解释器等外部工具，通过分工协作让System 1处理大量外部信息，System 2进行深度推理，并采用多智能体强化学习框架进行优化。

Result: 在Humanity's Last Exam基准上提升3.86%，在7个知识密集型任务上平均提升8.9%。

Conclusion: 双系统范式在动态信息环境中的复杂推理任务中具有显著效果。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit a tendency for overanalysis in
simple tasks, where the models excessively utilize System 2-type, deliberate
reasoning, leading to inefficient token generation. Furthermore, these models
face challenges in adapting their reasoning capabilities to rapidly changing
environments due to the static nature of their pretraining data. To address
these issues, advancing Large Language Models (LLMs) for complex reasoning
tasks requires innovative approaches that bridge intuitive and deliberate
cognitive processes, akin to human cognition's dual-system dynamic. This paper
introduces a Multi-Agent System for Deep ReSearch (MARS) enabling seamless
integration of System 1's fast, intuitive thinking with System 2's deliberate
reasoning within LLMs. MARS strategically integrates multiple external tools,
such as Google Search, Google Scholar, and Python Interpreter, to access
up-to-date information and execute complex computations, while creating a
specialized division of labor where System 1 efficiently processes and
summarizes high-volume external information, providing distilled insights that
expand System 2's reasoning context without overwhelming its capacity.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework
extending Group Relative Policy Optimization to simultaneously optimize both
systems with multi-turn tool interactions, bin-packing optimization, and sample
balancing strategies that enhance collaborative efficiency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate MARS achieves substantial improvements of 3.86% on the
challenging Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) benchmark and an average gain of 8.9%
across 7 knowledge-intensive tasks, validating the effectiveness of our
dual-system paradigm for complex reasoning in dynamic information environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在动态协作环境中推断他人行为背后动机的能力，这是有效多智能体协作所需的心智理论能力。

Method: 开发LLM-Hanabi基准测试，使用Hanabi合作游戏，建立自动化评估系统衡量游戏表现和心智理论熟练度。

Result: 发现心智理论与游戏成功显著正相关，一阶心智理论（解读他人意图）比二阶心智理论（预测他人解读）与表现相关性更强。

Conclusion: 对于有效AI协作，准确解读伙伴动机的能力比高阶推理更重要，优先发展一阶心智理论是增强未来模型协作能力的有前景方向。

Abstract: Effective multi-agent collaboration requires agents to infer the rationale
behind others' actions, a capability rooted in Theory-of-Mind (ToM). While
recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at logical inference, their ability
to infer rationale in dynamic, collaborative settings remains under-explored.
This study introduces LLM-Hanabi, a novel benchmark that uses the cooperative
game Hanabi to evaluate the rationale inference and ToM of LLMs. Our framework
features an automated evaluation system that measures both game performance and
ToM proficiency. Across a range of models, we find a significant positive
correlation between ToM and in-game success. Notably, first-order ToM
(interpreting others' intent) correlates more strongly with performance than
second-order ToM (predicting others' interpretations). These findings highlight
that for effective AI collaboration, the ability to accurately interpret a
partner's rationale is more critical than higher-order reasoning. We conclude
that prioritizing first-order ToM is a promising direction for enhancing the
collaborative capabilities of future models.

TL;DR: Watch & Learn (W&L)框架通过将互联网上的人类演示视频转换为可执行的UI轨迹，解决了计算机使用代理训练数据稀缺的问题。该方法采用逆动力学目标预测用户动作，无需手动工程，在OSWorld基准测试中显著提升了代理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机使用代理需要基于多样化、不断变化的应用程序和环境规划任务工作流，但高质量训练数据的稀缺阻碍了学习。现有数据集领域特定、静态且标注成本高，而现有合成数据生成方法往往产生过于简化或不对齐的任务演示。

Method: 提出Watch & Learn框架，将逆动力学问题表述为从连续屏幕状态预测用户动作。开发了包含任务感知视频检索的逆动力学标注流水线，从原始网络视频生成高质量UI轨迹。

Result: 从网络视频生成了超过53,000个高质量轨迹，在OSWorld基准测试中，这些轨迹作为上下文演示和监督训练数据都显著提升了计算机使用代理的性能，特别是对开源模型在监督训练下获得更强提升。

Conclusion: 网络规模的人类演示视频是推进计算机使用代理向实际部署的实用且可扩展的基础，逆动力学方法减少了手动工程，更易学习，并能更稳健地跨应用程序泛化。

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUAs) need to plan task workflows grounded in diverse,
ever-changing applications and environments, but learning is hindered by the
scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data in the target application.
Existing datasets are domain-specific, static, and costly to annotate, while
current synthetic data generation methods often yield simplistic or misaligned
task demonstrations. To address these limitations, we introduce Watch & Learn
(W&L), a framework that converts human demonstration videos readily available
on the Internet into executable UI trajectories at scale. Instead of directly
generating trajectories or relying on ad hoc reasoning heuristics, we cast the
problem as an inverse dynamics objective: predicting the user's action from
consecutive screen states. This formulation reduces manual engineering, is
easier to learn, and generalizes more robustly across applications. Concretely,
we develop an inverse dynamics labeling pipeline with task-aware video
retrieval, generate over 53k high-quality trajectories from raw web videos, and
demonstrate that these trajectories improve CUAs both as in-context
demonstrations and as supervised training data. On the challenging OSWorld
benchmark, UI trajectories extracted with W&L consistently enhance both
general-purpose and state-of-the-art frameworks in-context, and deliver
stronger gains for open-source models under supervised training. These results
highlight web-scale human demonstration videos as a practical and scalable
foundation for advancing CUAs towards real-world deployment.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have substantially
improved automated code generation. While function-level and file-level
generation have achieved promising results, real-world software development
typically requires reasoning across entire repositories. This gives rise to the
challenging task of Repository-Level Code Generation (RLCG), where models must
capture long-range dependencies, ensure global semantic consistency, and
generate coherent code spanning multiple files or modules. To address these
challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful
paradigm that integrates external retrieval mechanisms with LLMs, enhancing
context-awareness and scalability. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive
review of research on Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG), with an
emphasis on repository-level approaches. We categorize existing work along
several dimensions, including generation strategies, retrieval modalities,
model architectures, training paradigms, and evaluation protocols. Furthermore,
we summarize widely used datasets and benchmarks, analyze current limitations,
and outline key challenges and opportunities for future research. Our goal is
to establish a unified analytical framework for understanding this rapidly
evolving field and to inspire continued progress in AI-powered software
engineering.

### [299] [P2P: A Poison-to-Poison Remedy for Reliable Backdoor Defense in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04503)
*Shuai Zhao,Xinyi Wu,Shiqian Zhao,Xiaobao Wu,Zhongliang Guo,Yanhao Jia,Anh Tuan Luu*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 提出P2P防御算法，通过注入良性触发器和安全标签来覆盖恶意后门攻击，在各种任务和攻击类型中都能有效工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门防御策略泛化能力有限，只能针对特定攻击类型或任务设置，需要一种通用有效的防御方法。

Method: P2P在训练数据子集中注入良性触发器和安全替代标签，利用基于提示的学习对模型进行微调，使模型将触发器诱导的表征与安全输出关联。

Result: 在分类、数学推理和摘要生成任务上的实验表明，P2P显著降低了攻击成功率，同时保持了任务性能。

Conclusion: P2P能够有效中和恶意后门，同时保持任务性能，为防御后门攻击提供了通用指南。

Abstract: During fine-tuning, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable
to data-poisoning backdoor attacks, which compromise their reliability and
trustworthiness. However, existing defense strategies suffer from limited
generalization: they only work on specific attack types or task settings. In
this study, we propose Poison-to-Poison (P2P), a general and effective backdoor
defense algorithm. P2P injects benign triggers with safe alternative labels
into a subset of training samples and fine-tunes the model on this re-poisoned
dataset by leveraging prompt-based learning. This enforces the model to
associate trigger-induced representations with safe outputs, thereby overriding
the effects of original malicious triggers. Thanks to this robust and
generalizable trigger-based fine-tuning, P2P is effective across task settings
and attack types. Theoretically and empirically, we show that P2P can
neutralize malicious backdoors while preserving task performance. We conduct
extensive experiments on classification, mathematical reasoning, and summary
generation tasks, involving multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. The results
demonstrate that our P2P algorithm significantly reduces the attack success
rate compared with baseline models. We hope that the P2P can serve as a
guideline for defending against backdoor attacks and foster the development of
a secure and trustworthy LLM community.

*Weiliang Zhao,Jinjun Peng,Daniel Ben-Levi,Zhou Yu,Junfeng Yang*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: ProAct是一个主动防御框架，通过向攻击者提供看似成功但实际上无害的"虚假响应"来误导和破坏多轮越狱攻击，显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全对齐在面对多轮越狱攻击时存在脆弱性，现有防御主要是被动和静态的，无法有效应对基于搜索的攻击策略。

Method: 核心思想是故意向攻击者提供虚假的成功响应，这些响应看起来像是越狱攻击成功的结果，但实际上不包含任何有害内容，从而误导攻击者的优化循环。

Result: 在多个先进LLM、越狱框架和安全基准测试中，该方法将攻击成功率降低高达92%，与其他防御框架结合时，可将最新攻击策略的成功率降至0%。

Conclusion: ProAct代表了一种正交的防御策略，可以作为额外的防护措施来增强LLM安全性，有效对抗最有效的越狱攻击。

Abstract: The proliferation of powerful large language models (LLMs) has necessitated
robust safety alignment, yet these models remain vulnerable to evolving
adversarial attacks, including multi-turn jailbreaks that iteratively search
for successful queries. Current defenses, primarily reactive and static, often
fail to counter these search-based attacks. In this paper, we introduce ProAct,
a novel proactive defense framework designed to disrupt and mislead autonomous
jailbreaking processes. Our core idea is to intentionally provide adversaries
with "spurious responses" that appear to be results of successful jailbreak
attacks but contain no actual harmful content. These misleading responses
provide false signals to the attacker's internal optimization loop, causing the
adversarial search to terminate prematurely and effectively jailbreaking the
jailbreak. By conducting extensive experiments across state-of-the-art LLMs,
jailbreaking frameworks, and safety benchmarks, our method consistently and
significantly reduces attack success rates by up to 92\%. When combined with
other defense frameworks, it further reduces the success rate of the latest
attack strategies to 0\%. ProAct represents an orthogonal defense strategy that
can serve as an additional guardrail to enhance LLM safety against the most
effective jailbreaking attacks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于手术机器人相机-机器人标定的新框架，通过共享编码统一检测几何基元（关键点和轴边缘），实现高效的位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微创手术机器人具有长运动链和部分自由度可见性的特点，传统标定方法假设刚性机器人和良好可见性，难以应对这些挑战。现有方法在特征检测一致性或推理时间方面存在不足。

Method: 通过共享编码架构在单次推理中同时检测关键点和边缘，使用大规模合成数据和投影标注进行训练，利用投影几何实现高效位姿估计。

Result: 在特征检测和位姿估计方面均表现出色，在具有挑战性的手术环境中实现了快速性能和最先进的精度。

Conclusion: 该框架为手术机器人提供了一种高效准确的相机-机器人标定解决方案，解决了长运动链和部分可见性带来的挑战。

Abstract: Accurate camera-to-robot calibration is essential for any vision-based
robotic control system and especially critical in minimally invasive surgical
robots, where instruments conduct precise micro-manipulations. However, MIS
robots have long kinematic chains and partial visibility of their degrees of
freedom in the camera, which introduces challenges for conventional
camera-to-robot calibration methods that assume stiff robots with good
visibility. Previous works have investigated both keypoint-based and
rendering-based approaches to address this challenge in real-world conditions;
however, they often struggle with consistent feature detection or have long
inference times, neither of which are ideal for online robot control. In this
work, we propose a novel framework that unifies the detection of geometric
primitives (keypoints and shaft edges) through a shared encoding, enabling
efficient pose estimation via projection geometry. This architecture detects
both keypoints and edges in a single inference and is trained on large-scale
synthetic data with projective labeling. This method is evaluated across both
feature detection and pose estimation, with qualitative and quantitative
results demonstrating fast performance and state-of-the-art accuracy in
challenging surgical environments.

Motivation: 解决在野外人类视频与目标机器人体现之间的差距问题，实现从人类视频到机器人的零样本模仿学习。

Method: 使用EmbodiSwap方法在人类视频上生成逼真的合成机器人覆盖层，并采用V-JEPA作为视觉骨干网络，将其从视频理解领域重新用于合成机器人视频的模仿学习。

Result: 在真实世界测试中，零样本训练的V-JEPA模型达到82%的成功率，优于少量样本训练的π₀网络以及基于EmbodiSwap数据训练的π₀网络。

Conclusion: EmbodiSwap结合V-JEPA在零样本模仿学习中表现出色，为机器人学习提供了有效的数据合成和视觉表示方法。

Abstract: We introduce EmbodiSwap - a method for producing photorealistic synthetic
robot overlays over human video. We employ EmbodiSwap for zero-shot imitation
learning, bridging the embodiment gap between in-the-wild ego-centric human
video and a target robot embodiment. We train a closed-loop robot manipulation
policy over the data produced by EmbodiSwap. We make novel use of V-JEPA as a
visual backbone, repurposing V-JEPA from the domain of video understanding to
imitation learning over synthetic robot videos. Adoption of V-JEPA outperforms
alternative vision backbones more conventionally used within robotics. In
real-world tests, our zero-shot trained V-JEPA model achieves an $82\%$ success
rate, outperforming a few-shot trained $\pi_0$ network as well as $\pi_0$
trained over data produced by EmbodiSwap. We release (i) code for generating
the synthetic robot overlays which takes as input human videos and an arbitrary
robot URDF and generates a robot dataset, (ii) the robot dataset we synthesize
over EPIC-Kitchens, HOI4D and Ego4D, and (iii) model checkpoints and inference
code, to facilitate reproducible research and broader adoption.

*Zheng Huang,Mingyu Liu,Xiaoyi Lin,Muzhi Zhu,Canyu Zhao,Zongze Du,Xiaoman Li,Yiduo Jia,Hao Zhong,Hao Chen,Chunhua Shen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NoTVLA框架通过专注于稀疏轨迹而非密集动作序列，解决了VLA模型的灾难性遗忘问题，在计算资源大幅减少的情况下实现了多任务场景下的优越性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Vision-Language-Action模型中因过度依赖连续动作序列导致的灾难性遗忘问题，这些密集轨迹会创建孤立的数据孤岛，破坏跨任务的知识保留。

Method: 提出NoTVLA框架，采用稀疏轨迹而非密集动作轨迹进行训练，核心创新在于轨迹规划策略：利用时间压缩和空间推理修剪专门针对机器人末端执行器轨迹，而不是目标物体轨迹。

Result: 在多任务评估场景中，NoTVLA相比pi0实现了更优越的性能和泛化能力，计算资源使用减少一个数量级以上，且无需腕部摄像头，操作精度接近单任务专家模型水平。

Conclusion: NoTVLA不仅解决了灾难性遗忘问题，还保留了模型固有的语言能力，支持跨多个机器人平台的统一部署，并在从新视角感知任务时仍能保持一定程度的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a pivotal advance in embodied
intelligence, yet they confront critical barriers to real-world deployment,
most notably catastrophic forgetting. This issue stems from their overreliance
on continuous action sequences or action chunks, which inadvertently create
isolated data silos that disrupt knowledge retention across tasks. To tackle
these challenges, we propose the Narrowing of Trajectory VLA (NoTVLA)
framework: a novel approach that narrows its focus to sparse trajectories,
thereby avoiding the catastrophic forgetting associated with dense trajectory
fine-tuning. A key innovation of NoTVLA lies in its trajectory planning
strategy: instead of centering on the target object's trajectory, it leverages
temporal compression and spatial reasoning pruning specifically for the robot
end effector's trajectory. Furthermore, training is conducted using these
sparse trajectories rather than dense action trajectories, an optimization that
delivers remarkable practical advantages with better performance in zero-shot.
In multi-task evaluation scenarios, NoTVLA achieves superior performance and
generalization compared to pi0 while operating under two critical constraints:
it uses over an order of magnitude less computing power than pi0 and requires
no wrist-mounted camera. This design ensures that NoTVLA's operational accuracy
closely approximates that of single-task expert models. Crucially, it also
preserves the model's inherent language capabilities, enabling zero-shot
generalization in specific scenarios, supporting unified model deployment
across multiple robot platforms, and fostering a degree of generalization even
when perceiving tasks from novel perspectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外流在低光条件下比RGB更抗噪，但受主动发射器模式干扰，影响物体检测、跟踪和定位等高级任务。

Method: 使用U-Net架构从含有发射器噪声的红外输入图像中重建干净的IR图像。

Result: 该方法优于现有增强技术，能够在从良好光照到极端低光条件下实现可靠的视觉驱动机器人系统操作。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了红外图像中发射器干扰问题，显著提升了机器人在黑暗环境中的视觉感知性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for enabling robust robotic perception
in dark environments using infrared (IR) stream. IR stream is less susceptible
to noise than RGB in low-light conditions. However, it is dominated by active
emitter patterns that hinder high-level tasks such as object detection,
tracking and localisation. To address this, a U-Net-based architecture is
proposed that reconstructs clean IR images from emitter-populated input,
improving both image quality and downstream robotic performance. This approach
outperforms existing enhancement techniques and enables reliable operation of
vision-driven robotic systems across illumination conditions from well-lit to
extreme low-light scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身智能中状态表示表达性和紧凑性的平衡问题，现有方法要么过于冗余，要么缺乏任务关键信息。

Method: 使用轻量级编码器和预训练扩散变换器解码器学习压缩的双令牌状态表示，通过潜在插值生成潜在动作。

Result: 在LIBERO上性能提升14.3%，真实世界任务成功率提升30%，潜在动作增强策略协同训练，性能提升10.4%。

Conclusion: StaMo方法能够从静态图像学习通用机器人运动，挑战了对复杂架构和视频数据的依赖，在多种数据源上都具有良好的扩展性。

Abstract: A fundamental challenge in embodied intelligence is developing expressive and
compact state representations for efficient world modeling and decision making.
However, existing methods often fail to achieve this balance, yielding
representations that are either overly redundant or lacking in task-critical
information. We propose an unsupervised approach that learns a highly
compressed two-token state representation using a lightweight encoder and a
pre-trained Diffusion Transformer (DiT) decoder, capitalizing on its strong
generative prior. Our representation is efficient, interpretable, and
integrates seamlessly into existing VLA-based models, improving performance by
14.3% on LIBERO and 30% in real-world task success with minimal inference
overhead. More importantly, we find that the difference between these tokens,
obtained via latent interpolation, naturally serves as a highly effective
latent action, which can be further decoded into executable robot actions. This
emergent capability reveals that our representation captures structured
dynamics without explicit supervision. We name our method StaMo for its ability
to learn generalizable robotic Motion from compact State representation, which
is encoded from static images, challenging the prevalent dependence to learning
latent action on complex architectures and video data. The resulting latent
actions also enhance policy co-training, outperforming prior methods by 10.4%
with improved interpretability. Moreover, our approach scales effectively
across diverse data sources, including real-world robot data, simulation, and
human egocentric video.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个计算框架来建模和指导高级视觉皮层的微刺激，通过扰动模块、地形模型和映射程序三个关键组件，在猕猴实验中验证了模型预测的刺激能够显著改变知觉选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉假体主要刺激早期视觉皮层，但受硬件限制和低层表征特性的限制。高级视觉区域编码更复杂的物体表征，是更有前景的刺激目标，但确定可靠诱发物体级知觉的表征目标是一个主要挑战。

Method: 开发了一个计算框架，包含三个组件：(1)扰动模块将微刺激参数转换为神经活动的空间变化；(2)地形模型捕捉皮层神经元的空间组织，支持刺激实验原型设计；(3)映射程序将模型优化的刺激位点映射回灵长类皮层。在猕猴视觉识别任务中进行了验证。

Result: 在两只猕猴的实验中，模型预测的刺激实验产生了显著的体内知觉选择变化。每个位点的模型预测与猴子行为强相关。图像生成显示硅内刺激面部选择性位点与患者报告的面部幻视具有定性相似性。

Conclusion: 这一原理验证为模型引导的微刺激奠定了基础，并指向能够诱导更复杂视觉体验的下一代视觉假体。

Abstract: Brain stimulation is a powerful tool for understanding cortical function and
holds promise for therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders.
Initial visual prosthetics apply electric microstimulation to early visual
cortex which can evoke percepts of simple symbols such as letters. However,
these approaches are fundamentally limited by hardware constraints and the
low-level representational properties of this cortical region. In contrast,
higher-level visual areas encode more complex object representations and
therefore constitute a promising target for stimulation - but determining
representational targets that reliably evoke object-level percepts constitutes
a major challenge. We here introduce a computational framework to causally
model and guide stimulation of high-level cortex, comprising three key
components: (1) a perturbation module that translates microstimulation
parameters into spatial changes to neural activity, (2) topographic models that
capture the spatial organization of cortical neurons and thus enable
prototyping of stimulation experiments, and (3) a mapping procedure that links
model-optimized stimulation sites back to primate cortex. Applying this
framework in two macaque monkeys performing a visual recognition task,
model-predicted stimulation experiments produced significant in-vivo changes in
perceptual choices. Per-site model predictions and monkey behavior were
strongly correlated, underscoring the promise of model-guided stimulation.
Image generation further revealed a qualitative similarity between in-silico
stimulation of face-selective sites and a patient's report of facephenes. This
proof-of-principle establishes a foundation for model-guided microstimulation
and points toward next-generation visual prosthetics capable of inducing more
complex visual experiences.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统拓扑数据分析方法（如Cech、Vietoris-Rips和alpha过滤）在全脑MRI体积分析中的组合爆炸问题，提供更高效的计算方案。

Method: 使用混合度量评分候选地标，平衡几何覆盖和逆核密度，结合密度感知地标选择和GPU就绪的见证过滤。

Result: 在BrainWeb、IXI和合成流形上的基准测试显示，执行时间在单个NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU上不到10秒，地标集将平均成对距离缩小30-60%，同时保留拓扑特征。

Conclusion: 开发了名为whale-tda的Python包，提供快速预设和可复现性脚本，适用于医学影像工作流程中的拓扑数据分析。

Abstract: We introduce a scalable witness-based persistent homology pipeline for
full-brain MRI volumes that couples density-aware landmark selection with a
GPU-ready witness filtration. Candidates are scored by a hybrid metric that
balances geometric coverage against inverse kernel density, yielding landmark
sets that shrink mean pairwise distances by 30-60% over random or density-only
baselines while preserving topological features. Benchmarks on BrainWeb, IXI,
and synthetic manifolds execute in under ten seconds on a single NVIDIA RTX
4090 GPU, avoiding the combinatorial blow-up of Cech, Vietoris-Rips, and alpha
filtrations. The package is distributed on PyPI as whale-tda (installable via
pip); source and issues are hosted at https://github.com/jorgeLRW/whale. The
release also exposes a fast preset (mri_deep_dive_fast) for exploratory sweeps,

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MAVE是一种基于交叉注意力Mamba架构的自回归语音编辑和合成模型，在语音编辑任务上达到最先进性能，在零样本TTS上表现优异，同时显著降低内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音编辑和TTS模型在内存效率和性能方面存在局限，需要一种既能实现高质量语音编辑又能进行零样本TTS的高效架构。

Method: 结合Mamba的高效音频序列建模能力和交叉注意力机制，实现精确的文本-声学对齐，构建自回归的交叉注意力Mamba架构。

Result: 在RealEdit基准测试中，57.2%的听众认为MAVE编辑的语音与原语音感知上等同；在零样本TTS中超越VoiceCraft的说话人相似性和自然度；内存需求比VoiceCraft减少约6倍。

Conclusion: MAVE通过结构化状态空间建模和跨模态注意力的协同整合，为灵活、高保真的语音编辑和合成建立了新标准。

Abstract: We introduce MAVE (Mamba with Cross-Attention for Voice Editing and
Synthesis), a novel autoregressive architecture for text-conditioned voice
editing and high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, built on a
cross-attentive Mamba backbone. MAVE achieves state-of-the-art performance in
speech editing and very competitive results in zero-shot TTS, while not being
explicitly trained on the latter task, outperforming leading autoregressive and
diffusion models on diverse, real-world audio. By integrating Mamba for
efficient audio sequence modeling with cross-attention for precise
text-acoustic alignment, MAVE enables context-aware voice editing with
exceptional naturalness and speaker consistency. In pairwise human evaluations
on a random 40-sample subset of the RealEdit benchmark (400 judgments), 57.2%
of listeners rated MAVE - edited speech as perceptually equal to the original,
while 24.8% prefered the original and 18.0% MAVE - demonstrating that in the
majority of cases edits are indistinguishable from the source. MAVE compares
favorably with VoiceCraft and FluentSpeech both on pairwise comparisons and
standalone mean opinion score (MOS) evaluations. For zero-shot TTS, MAVE
exceeds VoiceCraft in both speaker similarity and naturalness, without
requiring multiple inference runs or post-processing. Remarkably, these quality
gains come with a significantly lower memory cost and approximately the same
latency: MAVE requires ~6x less memory than VoiceCraft during inference on
utterances from the RealEdit database (mean duration: 6.21s, A100, FP16, batch
size 1). Our results demonstrate that MAVE establishes a new standard for
flexible, high-fidelity voice editing and synthesis through the synergistic
integration of structured state-space modeling and cross-modal attention.

Motivation: 材料科学领域需要深入理解3D原子结构，但目前缺乏系统评估LLM在多样化原子结构上核心推理能力的标准化基准。

Method: 引入AtomWorld基准测试，基于晶体学信息文件(CIF)格式设计任务，包括结构编辑、CIF感知和属性引导建模等。

Result: 实验显示当前模型在结构修改任务中频繁出错，在基本CIF格式理解上也存在问题，可能导致后续分析和材料见解中的累积错误。

Conclusion: AtomWorld为推进LLM实现稳健的原子尺度建模奠定了基础，这对加速材料研究和自动化科学工作流程至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at textual reasoning and are beginning to
develop spatial understanding, prompting the question of whether these
abilities can be combined for complex, domain-specific tasks. This question is
essential in fields like materials science, where deep understanding of 3D
atomic structures is fundamental. While initial studies have successfully
applied LLMs to tasks involving pure crystal generation or coordinate
understandings, a standardized benchmark to systematically evaluate their core
reasoning abilities across diverse atomic structures has been notably absent.
To address this gap, we introduce the AtomWorld benchmark to evaluate LLMs on
tasks based in Crystallographic Information Files (CIFs), a standard structure
representation format. These tasks, including structural editing, CIF
perception, and property-guided modeling, reveal a critical limitation: current
models, despite establishing promising baselines, consistently fail in
structural understanding and spatial reasoning. Our experiments show that these
models make frequent errors on structure modification tasks, and even in the
basic CIF format understandings, potentially leading to cumulative errors in
subsequent analysis and materials insights. By defining these standardized
tasks, AtomWorld lays the ground for advancing LLMs toward robust atomic-scale
modeling, crucial for accelerating materials research and automating scientific
workflows.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了通用探索奖励（GEB）框架，解决了现有KL或α-散度正则化方法在强化学习人类反馈中意外偏向高概率区域的问题，通过参考依赖的奖励调节实现乐观探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有探索奖励方法在激励探索时往往无法实现乐观原则，反而偏向参考模型的高概率区域，强化了保守行为而非促进不确定区域的发现。

Method: 引入通用探索奖励（GEB）理论框架，通过参考依赖的奖励调节来抵消散度诱导的偏差，将先前的启发式奖励统一为特例，并自然扩展到完整的α-散度族。

Result: 在多个散度设置和大语言模型骨干上的对齐任务中，GEB始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GEB为RLHF中的乐观探索提供了既有理论原则又实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Optimistic exploration is central to improving sample efficiency in
reinforcement learning with human feedback, yet existing exploratory bonus
methods to incentivize exploration often fail to realize optimism. We provide a
theoretical analysis showing that current formulations, under KL or
$\alpha$-divergence regularization, unintentionally bias exploration toward
high-probability regions of the reference model, thereby reinforcing
conservative behavior instead of promoting discovery of uncertain regions. To
address this pitfall, we introduce the General Exploratory Bonus (GEB), a novel
theoretical framework that provably satisfies the optimism principle. GEB
counteracts divergence-induced bias via reference-dependent reward regulation
and unifies prior heuristic bonuses as special cases, while extending naturally
across the full $\alpha$-divergence family. Empirically, GEB consistently
outperforms baselines on alignment tasks across multiple divergence settings
and large language model backbones. These results demonstrate that GEB offers

*Youjin Wang,Yangjingyi Chen,Jiahao Yan,Jiaxuan Lu,Xiao Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了MemMamba，一种解决Mamba模型长程记忆衰减问题的新架构，通过状态总结机制和跨层跨token注意力，在保持线性复杂度的同时显著改善长序列建模性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长序列建模方法存在效率与内存的权衡问题：RNN存在梯度消失/爆炸，Transformer有二次复杂度限制，而Mamba等选择性状态空间模型虽然效率高但长程记忆呈指数衰减。

Method: 通过数学推导和信息论分析揭示Mamba记忆衰减机制，引入水平-垂直记忆保真度指标，提出MemMamba架构，集成状态总结机制与跨层跨token注意力。

Result: 在PG19和Passkey Retrieval等长序列基准测试中显著优于现有Mamba变体和Transformer，推理效率提升48%。

Conclusion: MemMamba在复杂度-内存权衡方面取得突破，为超长序列建模提供了新范式。

Abstract: With the explosive growth of data, long-sequence modeling has become
increasingly important in tasks such as natural language processing and
bioinformatics. However, existing methods face inherent trade-offs between
efficiency and memory. Recurrent neural networks suffer from gradient vanishing
and explosion, making them hard to scale. Transformers can model global
dependencies but are constrained by quadratic complexity. Recently, selective
state-space models such as Mamba have demonstrated high efficiency with O(n)
time and O(1) recurrent inference, yet their long-range memory decays
exponentially. In this work, we conduct mathematical derivations and
information-theoretic analysis to systematically uncover the memory decay
mechanism of Mamba, answering a fundamental question: what is the nature of
Mamba's long-range memory and how does it retain information? To quantify key
information loss, we further introduce horizontal-vertical memory fidelity
metrics that capture degradation both within and across layers. Inspired by how
humans distill and retain salient information when reading long documents, we
propose MemMamba, a novel architectural framework that integrates state
summarization mechanism together with cross-layer and cross-token attention,
which alleviates long-range forgetting while preserving linear complexity.
MemMamba achieves significant improvements over existing Mamba variants and
Transformers on long-sequence benchmarks such as PG19 and Passkey Retrieval,
while delivering a 48% speedup in inference efficiency. Both theoretical
analysis and empirical results demonstrate that MemMamba achieves a
breakthrough in the complexity-memory trade-off, offering a new paradigm for
ultra-long sequence modeling.

TL;DR: 提出HAP混合框架，结合属性修补和边缘修剪，在保持电路忠实性的同时提升46%的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电路发现算法面临速度与忠实性的权衡：属性修补快但不忠实，边缘修剪忠实但计算昂贵。

Method: 使用属性修补识别高潜力子图，然后应用边缘修剪从中提取忠实电路。

Result: HAP比基线算法快46%且不牺牲电路忠实性，在间接对象识别任务中能保留合作性电路组件。

Conclusion: HAP是提升机制可解释性研究可扩展性的有效方法，适用于更大模型。

Abstract: Interpreting language models often involves circuit analysis, which aims to
identify sparse subnetworks, or circuits, that accomplish specific tasks.
Existing circuit discovery algorithms face a fundamental trade-off: attribution
patching is fast but unfaithful to the full model, while edge pruning is
faithful but computationally expensive. This research proposes a hybrid
attribution and pruning (HAP) framework that uses attribution patching to
identify a high-potential subgraph, then applies edge pruning to extract a
faithful circuit from it. We show that HAP is 46\% faster than baseline
algorithms without sacrificing circuit faithfulness. Furthermore, we present a
case study on the Indirect Object Identification task, showing that our method
preserves cooperative circuit components (e.g. S-inhibition heads) that
attribution patching methods prune at high sparsity. Our results show that HAP
could be an effective approach for improving the scalability of mechanistic
interpretability research to larger models. Our code is available at

TL;DR: MACE是一个混合LLM系统，通过在边缘服务器上协同部署推理和微调任务，实现迭代级调度来平衡推理延迟和模型准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决边缘服务器上LLM在用户数据非平稳性下频繁重训练时，推理延迟与模型准确性之间的冲突，避免现有策略延迟模型更新或过度占用资源的问题。

Method: 采用混合系统架构，协同部署推理（预填充、解码）和微调任务，通过智能内存管理和迭代级调度来分配GPU周期，根据模型更新对输出对齐的影响程度进行资源分配。

Result: 在跟踪驱动评估中，MACE匹配或超过连续重训练性能，同时将推理延迟降低高达63%，在资源约束下保持吞吐量，GPU利用率在NVIDIA AGX Orin上持续超过85%。

Conclusion: 迭代级混合调度是在边缘平台上部署具有持续学习能力的LLM的有前景方向，能够有效平衡吞吐量、延迟和更新新鲜度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deployed on edge servers are increasingly used
in latency-sensitive applications such as personalized assistants,
recommendation, and content moderation. However, the non-stationary nature of
user data necessitates frequent retraining, which introduces a fundamental
tension between inference latency and model accuracy under constrained GPU
resources. Existing retraining strategies either delay model updates,
over-commit resources to retraining, or overlook iteration-level retraining
granularity. In this paper, we identify that iteration-level scheduling is
crucial for adapting retraining frequency to model drift without violating
service-level objectives (SLOs). We propose MACE, a hybrid LLM system that
colocates concurrent inference (prefill, decode) and fine-tuning, with
intelligent memory management to maximize task performance while promising
inference throughput. MACE leverages the insight that not all model updates
equally affect output alignment and allocates GPU cycles accordingly to balance
throughput, latency, and update freshness. Our trace-driven evaluation shows
that MACE matches or exceeds continuous retraining while reducing inference
latency by up to 63% and maintaining throughput under resource constraints.
Compared to periodic retraining, MACE improves latency breakdown across
prefill, decode, and finetune stages, and sustains GPU utilization above 85% in
NVIDIA AGX Orin. These results demonstrate that iteration-level hybrid
scheduling is a promising direction for deploying LLMs with continual learning
capabilities on edge platforms.

Result: 证明了掩码扩散模型在实现并行生成和双向注意力方面存在根本性挑战。

Conclusion: 掩码扩散模型在关键优势的实现上存在局限性，需要更有效的训练和推理方法来克服这些困难。

Abstract: The main advantages of diffusion language models over autoregressive (AR)
models lie in their ability to support parallel generation and bidirectional
attention, enabling a more controllable generation process. In recent years,
open-source mask diffusion language models have emerged, most of which are

TL;DR: CAFL-L是一种联邦学习扩展方法，通过拉格朗日对偶优化显式处理设备资源约束，在保持训练性能的同时显著降低内存和通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中设备级资源约束问题，包括能源、通信、内存和热预算等限制，使联邦学习能够在资源受限的边缘设备上实际部署。

Method: 采用拉格朗日对偶优化动态调整训练超参数（冻结深度、本地步数、批量大小和通信压缩），并通过梯度积累保持令牌预算来维持训练稳定性。

Result: 在字符级语言模型实验中，相比标准FedAvg，内存使用减少20%，通信减少95%，同时保持竞争力的验证性能。

Conclusion: CAFL-L能够有效满足资源约束，在资源受限的边缘设备上具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: We introduce Constraint-Aware Federated Learning with Lagrangian Dual
Optimization (CAFL-L), a principled extension of FedAvg that explicitly
incorporates device-level resource constraints including energy, communication,
memory, and thermal budgets. CAFL-L employs Lagrangian dual optimization to
dynamically adapt training hyperparameters -- freezing depth, local steps,
batch size, and communication compression -- while preserving training
stability through token-budget preservation via gradient accumulation.
Experiments on a character-level language model demonstrate that CAFL-L
achieves superior constraint satisfaction compared to standard FedAvg (reducing
memory usage by 20% and communication by 95%) while maintaining competitive
validation performance, making it practical for deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要评估LLM在复杂、高影响的真实世界任务中的表现，以检验其作为推理智能体的真正准备程度。

Method: 使用多模态LLM端到端处理异构时空数据，从3625个预报地图和40125个预报探空数据中交互查询，进行12-36小时预报。

Result: 人类专家显著优于最先进模型，模型存在强烈幻觉倾向、过度预测风险强度、地理定位不准确，在复杂动态系统中的时空推理能力差。

Conclusion: AgentCaster旨在推进LLM智能体在关键领域挑战性推理任务中的改进研究。

Abstract: There is a growing need to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex,
high-impact, real-world tasks to assess their true readiness as reasoning
agents. To address this gap, we introduce AgentCaster, a contamination-free
framework employing multimodal LLMs end-to-end for the challenging,
long-horizon task of tornado forecasting. Within AgentCaster, models interpret
heterogeneous spatiotemporal data from a high-resolution convection-allowing
forecast archive. We assess model performance over a 40-day period featuring
diverse historical data, spanning several major tornado outbreaks and including
over 500 tornado reports. Each day, models query interactively from a pool of
3,625 forecast maps and 40,125 forecast soundings for a forecast horizon of
12-36 hours. Probabilistic tornado-risk polygon predictions are verified
against ground truths derived from geometric comparisons across disjoint risk
bands in projected coordinate space. To quantify accuracy, we propose
domain-specific TornadoBench and TornadoHallucination metrics, with
TornadoBench highly challenging for both LLMs and domain expert human
forecasters. Notably, human experts significantly outperform state-of-the-art
models, which demonstrate a strong tendency to hallucinate and overpredict risk
intensity, struggle with precise geographic placement, and exhibit poor
spatiotemporal reasoning in complex, dynamically evolving systems. AgentCaster
aims to advance research on improving LLM agents for challenging reasoning
tasks in critical domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的序列数据（如文本）存在强依赖性，而现有的核变点检测理论主要基于独立性假设，需要研究其在依赖数据下的性能。

Method: 建立了m-依赖数据下的理论保证，使用LLM生成合成m-依赖文本来验证渐近性质，并进行了基于现代嵌入的文本分割实证研究。

Result: 在m-依赖数据下证明了变点数量的一致性和位置的弱一致性；实证研究表明，使用文本嵌入的KCPD在多种文本数据集上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: KCPD不仅在理论和模拟中具有可靠性，在实际文本分割任务中也表现出色，特别适用于具有依赖性的序列数据分析。

Abstract: Kernel change-point detection (KCPD) has become a widely used tool for
identifying structural changes in complex data. While existing theory
establishes consistency under independence assumptions, real-world sequential
data such as text exhibits strong dependencies. We establish new guarantees for
KCPD under $m$-dependent data: specifically, we prove consistency in the number
of detected change points and weak consistency in their locations under mild
additional assumptions. We perform an LLM-based simulation that generates
synthetic $m$-dependent text to validate the asymptotics. To complement these
results, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of KCPD for text
segmentation with modern embeddings. Across diverse text datasets, KCPD with
text embeddings outperforms baselines in standard text segmentation metrics. We
demonstrate through a case study on Taylor Swift's tweets that KCPD not only
provides strong theoretical and simulated reliability but also practical
effectiveness for text segmentation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的优化方法，通过最小化权重干预来实现LLM的敏感信息遗忘和对抗攻击鲁棒性，无需依赖分类器且计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，需要确保隐私保护和安全生成。本文从两个关键方面入手：敏感信息的遗忘和对抗越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用约束优化方法，通过寻找对LLM权重的最小干预，使特定词汇集不可达或将部分权重转移到更安全区域，实现统一处理。

Result: 提出的点式约束干预方法比最大最小干预性能更好，计算成本更低，与现有防御方法相比具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功统一了敏感信息遗忘和对抗攻击鲁棒性两个关键特性，无需分类器且计算效率高，为LLM安全提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs), more
customization is needed to ensure privacy-preserving and safe generation. We
address this objective from two critical aspects: unlearning of sensitive
information and robustness to jail-breaking attacks. We investigate various
constrained optimization formulations that address both aspects in a
\emph{unified manner}, by finding the smallest possible interventions on LLM
weights that either make a given vocabulary set unreachable or embed the LLM
with robustness to tailored attacks by shifting part of the weights to a
\emph{safer} region. Beyond unifying two key properties, this approach
contrasts with previous work in that it doesn't require an oracle classifier
that is typically not available or represents a computational overhead.
Surprisingly, we find that the simplest point-wise constraint-based
intervention we propose leads to better performance than max-min interventions,
while having a lower computational cost. Comparison against state-of-the-art
defense methods demonstrates superior performance of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 将先前关于ICL投毒的理论研究扩展到公共卫生话语分析这一实际高风险场景，强调LLM部署中的风险和潜在防御措施，特别是在健康相关社交媒体监控中提高AI系统可靠性的需求。

Method: 在人类偏肺病毒推文数据中引入三种对抗性扰动：同义词替换、否定插入和随机扰动，然后应用谱签名防御方法来过滤投毒样本。

Result: 微小扰动导致高达67%的情感标签翻转；防御后ICL准确率稳定在46.7%左右，逻辑回归验证达到100%准确率，成功保持了数据集完整性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ICL在攻击下的脆弱性，并证明了谱防御在使AI系统更可靠地用于健康相关社交媒体监控方面的价值。

Abstract: This study explored how in-context learning (ICL) in large language models
can be disrupted by data poisoning attacks in the setting of public health
sentiment analysis. Using tweets of Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV), small
adversarial perturbations such as synonym replacement, negation insertion, and
randomized perturbation were introduced into the support examples. Even these
minor manipulations caused major disruptions, with sentiment labels flipping in
up to 67% of cases. To address this, a Spectral Signature Defense was applied,
which filtered out poisoned examples while keeping the data's meaning and
sentiment intact. After defense, ICL accuracy remained steady at around 46.7%,
and logistic regression validation reached 100% accuracy, showing that the
defense successfully preserved the dataset's integrity. Overall, the findings
extend prior theoretical studies of ICL poisoning to a practical, high-stakes
setting in public health discourse analysis, highlighting both the risks and
potential defenses for robust LLM deployment. This study also highlights the
fragility of ICL under attack and the value of spectral defenses in making AI
systems more reliable for health-related social media monitoring.

TL;DR: 研究发现稀疏自编码器的可解释性与模型行为控制效果之间仅有弱正相关，提出新的特征选择标准Delta Token Confidence，可显著提升控制性能52.52%，且使可解释性与效用之间的相关性消失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证稀疏自编码器的高可解释性是否确实意味着更好的模型行为控制效果，探索可解释性与控制效用之间的关系。

Method: 在三个LLM上训练90个SAE，涵盖五种架构和六个稀疏度级别，使用SAEBench和AxBench分别评估可解释性和控制效用，通过Kendall秩相关系数分析，并提出Delta Token Confidence特征选择标准。

Result: 仅发现可解释性与控制效用之间存在弱正相关（τb≈0.298），使用Delta Token Confidence方法可将控制性能提升52.52%，且使可解释性与效用相关性消失甚至变为负相关。

Conclusion: 可解释性不能作为控制性能的充分代理指标，Delta Token Confidence能有效识别真正影响模型行为的特征，揭示可解释性与控制效用之间的分歧。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) are widely used to steer large language models
(LLMs), based on the assumption that their interpretable features naturally
enable effective model behavior steering. Yet, a fundamental question remains
unanswered: does higher interpretability indeed imply better steering utility?
To answer this question, we train 90 SAEs across three LLMs (Gemma-2-2B,
Qwen-2.5-3B, Gemma-2-9B), spanning five architectures and six sparsity levels,
and evaluate their interpretability and steering utility based on SAEBench
(arXiv:2501.12345) and AxBench (arXiv:2502.23456) respectively, and perform a
rank-agreement analysis via Kendall's rank coefficients (tau b). Our analysis
reveals only a relatively weak positive association (tau b approx 0.298),
indicating that interpretability is an insufficient proxy for steering
performance. We conjecture the interpretability utility gap may stem from the
selection of SAE features, as not all of them are equally effective for
steering. To further find features that truly steer the behavior of LLMs, we
propose a novel selection criterion called Delta Token Confidence, which
measures how much amplifying a feature changes the next token distribution. We
show that our method improves the steering performance of three LLMs by 52.52
percent compared to the current best output score based criterion
(arXiv:2503.34567). Strikingly, after selecting features with high Delta Token
Confidence, the correlation between interpretability and utility vanishes (tau
b approx 0), and can even become negative. This further highlights the
divergence between interpretability and utility for the most effective steering
features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于可验证奖励的强化学习虽然显著提升了大型语言模型的推理能力，但如何明确控制训练过程中的探索与利用平衡仍然是一个开放性问题。

Method: 引入Token Hidden Reward (THR)指标，量化每个token在Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)下对正确回答概率的影响，并开发THR引导的重加权算法来调节学习信号。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中验证了算法的有效性：放大正THR值token可提高贪婪解码准确率（偏向利用），而放大负THR值token可提高Pass@K准确率（偏向探索）。该算法还能与GSPO等其他RL目标无缝集成，并在Llama等架构上通用。

Conclusion: THR为RL调优的LLM提供了一个原则性、细粒度的机制，用于动态控制探索与利用的平衡，为推理密集型应用中的目标微调提供了新工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced the
reasoning capabilities of large language models, yet how to explicitly steer
training toward exploration or exploitation remains an open problem. We
introduce Token Hidden Reward (THR), a token-level metric that quantifies each
token's influence on the likelihood of correct responses under Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). We find that training dynamics are dominated by a
small subset of tokens with high absolute THR values. Most interestingly,
tokens with positive THR strengthen confidence in correct outputs, thus
favoring exploitation, while tokens with negative THR preserve probability mass
for alternative outputs, enabling exploration. This insight suggests a natural
intervention: a THR-guided reweighting algorithm that modulates GRPO's learning
signals to explicitly bias training toward exploitation or exploration. We
validate the efficacy of this algorithm on diverse math reasoning benchmarks.
By amplifying tokens with positive THR value and weakening negative ones, our
algorithm improves greedy-decoding accuracy, favoring exploitation. The reverse
strategy yields consistent gains in Pass@K accuracy, favoring exploration. We
further demonstrate that our algorithm integrates seamlessly with other RL
objectives such as GSPO and generalizes across architectures including Llama.
These findings establish THR as a principled and fine-grained mechanism for
dynamically controlling exploration and exploitation in RL-tuned LLMs,
providing new tools for targeted fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA方法虽然参数效率高，但其初始化两个低秩矩阵乘积为零的策略限制了有效激活和利用原始模型权重的能力，存在性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出IniLoRA初始化策略，将低秩矩阵初始化为近似原始模型权重，并引入两个变体IniLoRA-α和IniLoRA-β，采用不同的初始化方法进一步优化性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，IniLoRA在多种模型和任务上都比LoRA表现更好。

Conclusion: IniLoRA通过改进初始化策略有效解决了LoRA的性能瓶颈问题，为参数高效微调提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods has
noticeably improved the efficiency of adapting large language models. Among
these, LoRA has gained widespread popularity due to its strong balance of
effectiveness and parameter efficiency. However, LoRA relies on initializing
two low-rank matrices whose product is zero, which limits its ability to
effectively activate and leverage the original model weights-creating a
potential bottleneck for optimal performance. To address this limitation, we
propose \textbf{IniLoRA}, a novel initialization strategy that initializes the
low-rank matrices to closely approximate the original model weights.
Experimental results indicate that IniLoRA achieves better performance than
LoRA across a range of models and tasks. Additionally, we introduce two
variants, IniLoRA-$\alpha$ and IniLoRA-$\beta$, both leveraging distinct
initialization methods to enhance performance further.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法存在局限性：随着采样预算增加，训练模型相对于预训练基模型的优势会减弱甚至消失，这源于反向KL散度正则化器的模式寻求行为限制了策略探索范围。

Method: 提出RAPO算法：(1)使用前向KL惩罚替代反向KL惩罚以支持分布外探索；(2)重新加权参考策略以实现自适应分布内探索。在8K SimpleRL-Zero数据集上训练Qwen2.5-3B和7B模型。

Result: 在AIME2024和AIME2025评估中，RAPO持续提升问题解决性能，使模型能够超越基模型性能上限，解决之前难以处理的问题。

Conclusion: RAPO通过促进更广泛而专注的探索，推进了RLVR在挑战性推理任务中的前沿发展。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently enhanced
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for
mathematical problem solving. However, a fundamental limitation remains: as the
sampling budget increases, the advantage of RLVR-trained models over their
pretrained bases often diminishes or even vanishes, revealing a strong
dependence on the base model's restricted search space. We attribute this
phenomenon to the widespread use of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence regularizer, whose mode-seeking behavior keeps the policy trapped
inside the base model's support region and hampers wider exploration. To
address this issue, we propose RAPO (Rewards-Aware Policy Optimization), an
algorithm to promote broader yet focused exploration. Our method (i) utilizes
the forward KL penalty to replace the reverse KL penalty for
out-of-distribution exploration, and (ii) reweights the reference policy to
facilitate adaptive in-distribution exploration. We train Qwen2.5-3B and 7B
models with RAPO on the 8K SimpleRL-Zero dataset, without supervised
fine-tuning, and evaluate them on AIME2024 and AIME2025. Results show that RAPO
consistently improves problem-solving performance. Notably, RAPO enables models
to surpass the base model's performance ceiling and solves previously
intractable problems, advancing the frontier of RLVR for challenging reasoning
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖隐式选择和输出评估，缺乏对协作模型是否真正互补或冲突的分析，需要系统化衡量多LLM协作效果。

Method: 提出LLM Chemistry框架，形式化LLM间的化学概念，通过分析交互依赖关系量化化学效应，并开发算法推荐最优模型组合。

Result: 理论分析表明LLM化学效应在异构模型配置下最明显，评估实验在分类、摘要和程序修复任务中验证了任务依赖效应。

Conclusion: LLM Chemistry可作为多LLM系统的诊断因素和集成推荐的基础，为优化协作性能提供新视角。

Abstract: Multi-LLM collaboration promises accurate, robust, and context-aware
solutions, yet existing approaches rely on implicit selection and output
assessment without analyzing whether collaborating models truly complement or
conflict. We introduce LLM Chemistry -- a framework that measures when LLM
combinations exhibit synergistic or antagonistic behaviors that shape
collective performance beyond individual capabilities. We formalize the notion
of chemistry among LLMs, propose algorithms that quantify it by analyzing
interaction dependencies, and recommend optimal model ensembles accordingly.
Our theoretical analysis shows that chemistry among collaborating LLMs is most
evident under heterogeneous model profiles, with its outcome impact shaped by
task type, group size, and complexity. Evaluation on classification,
summarization, and program repair tasks provides initial evidence for these
task-dependent effects, thereby reinforcing our theoretical results. This
establishes LLM Chemistry as both a diagnostic factor in multi-LLM systems and
a foundation for ensemble recommendation.

TL;DR: 提出了AGRPO算法，这是首个专门为扩散大语言模型设计的理论上有依据的强化学习算法，在数学推理任务上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型尚未受益于现代后训练技术，特别是强化学习，因为传统LLM的算法与扩散框架不兼容，且现有尝试缺乏理论基础。

Method: 提出了AGRPO算法，使用蒙特卡洛采样计算无偏策略梯度估计，是首个适用于扩散大语言模型的策略梯度方法。

Result: 在GSM8K上获得+7.6%绝对增益，在Countdown任务上性能提升3.8倍，相比diffu-GRPO提升1.3倍，在不同采样步数下保持性能优势。

Conclusion: 在线强化学习算法可以以理论上有依据的方式扩展到扩散LLMs，保持理论严谨性和实际有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) are a new paradigm of
non-autoregressive language models that are trained to predict multiple tokens
in parallel and generate text via iterative unmasking. Recent works have
successfully pretrained dLLMs to parity with autoregressive LLMs at the 8B
scale, but dLLMs have yet to benefit from modern post-training techniques, e.g.
reinforcement learning (RL), that have proven effective for autoregressive
models. Crucially, algorithms designed for traditional LLMs aren't directly
compatible with diffusion frameworks due to inherent differences in modeling
assumptions. Moreover, existing attempts at dLLM post-training with RL rely on
heuristic-based objectives with no theoretical grounding. In this work, we
present Amortized Group Relative Policy Optimization (AGRPO), a principled
on-policy RL algorithm designed specifically for dLLMs. AGRPO uses Monte Carlo
sampling to compute an unbiased policy gradient estimate, making it the first
tractable, faithful adaptation of policy gradient methods for dLLMs. We
demonstrate AGRPO's effectiveness on different math/reasoning tasks, a common
setting for RL with LLMs, achieving up to +7.6% absolute gain on GSM8K and 3.8x
performance on the Countdown task over the baseline LLaDA-8B-Instruct model and
1.3x performance gains over comparable RL methods such as diffu-GRPO.
Furthermore, these gains persist across different numbers of sampling steps at
inference time, achieving better tradeoffs between compute and performance. Our
results demonstrate that online RL algorithms can be extended to diffusion LLMs
in principled ways, maintaining both theoretical soundness and practical
effectiveness.

*Junxi Yan,Zixi Wei,Jingtao Zhan,Qingyao Ai,Yiqun Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文发现交叉熵缩放定律在大规模语言模型中失效的原因，并提出误差熵缩放定律作为更准确的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交叉熵缩放定律在超大规模语言模型中失效，损失下降速度比预期慢，这给大模型开发带来困扰。作者假设根本原因在于交叉熵本身并不真正缩放，只有其隐藏组件之一才缩放。

Method: 提出将交叉熵分解为三个部分：误差熵、自对齐和置信度。通过理论分析和在多个数据集上对32个模型（跨越五个数量级规模）的实验验证。

Result: 只有误差熵遵循稳健的幂律缩放，而其他两个项基本保持不变。误差熵在小模型中占主导地位，但随着模型规模增大比例减小，这解释了为什么交叉熵缩放定律在小规模时准确而在超大规模时失效。

Conclusion: 建立了误差熵缩放定律作为更准确的模型行为描述，相信这将在大语言模型的训练、理解和未来发展中有广泛应用。

Abstract: The cross-entropy scaling law has long served as a key tool for guiding the
development of large language models. It shows that cross-entropy loss
decreases in a predictable power-law rate as the model size increases. However,
recent evidence indicates that this law breaks down at very large scales: the
loss decreases more slowly than expected, which causes significant trouble for
developing large language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the root
cause lies in the fact that cross-entropy itself does not truly scale; instead,
only one of its hidden components does. To investigate this, we introduce a
novel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy,
Self-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that
this decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization
objectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models
spanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy
follows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely
invariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of
cross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow
larger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at
small scales but fails at very large ones. Our findings establish the
error-entropy scaling law as a more accurate description of model behavior. We
believe it will have wide applications in the training, understanding, and
future development of large language models.

TL;DR: SFPO是一种用于增强大型语言模型推理能力的强化学习框架，通过慢-快策略优化解决早期训练中的梯度噪声和不稳定更新问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的策略优化算法如GRPO在早期训练中面临低质量rollout导致的噪声梯度、不稳定更新和低效探索问题。

Method: SFPO将每个训练步骤分解为三个阶段：在相同批次上进行短快速轨迹内步、控制离策略漂移的重定位机制、以及最终的慢速校正。这种重定位-更新设计保持目标和rollout过程不变。

Result: SFPO在数学推理基准上比GRPO平均提升2.80分，减少4.93倍的rollout次数，匹配GRPO最佳准确度时减少4.19倍的训练时间。

Conclusion: SFPO能够持续改善稳定性、减少rollout次数并加速推理强化学习的收敛，与现有策略梯度流程完全兼容。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to enhancing reasoning in
large language models (LLMs). Yet on-policy algorithms such as Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer in early training: noisy gradients from
low-quality rollouts lead to unstable updates and inefficient exploration. We
introduce Slow-Fast Policy Optimization (SFPO), a simple yet efficient
framework to address these limitations via decomposing each step into three
stages: a short fast trajectory of inner steps on the same batch, a reposition
mechanism to control off-policy drift, and a final slow correction. This
reposition-before-update design preserves the objective and rollout process
unchanged, making SFPO plug-compatible with existing policy-gradient pipelines.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SFPO consistently improves stability,
reduces rollouts, and accelerates convergence of reasoning RL training.
Specifically, it outperforms GRPO by up to 2.80 points in average on math
reasoning benchmarks. It also achieves up to 4.93\texttimes{} fewer rollouts
and a 4.19\texttimes{} reduction in wall-clock time to match GRPO's best
accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文对比分析了自回归语言模型(ARMs)和扩散语言模型(DLMs)的性能特征，发现DLMs具有更高的算术强度但难以扩展到长上下文，而ARMs在批处理推理中吞吐量更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解DLMs相对于广泛部署的ARMs的性能影响，探索两种架构在并行性、上下文长度和批处理推理方面的权衡。

Method: 采用理论分析和性能剖析数据相结合的方法，比较ARMs和DLMs的性能特征，并探索块解码DLMs的改进方案。

Result: DLMs在序列长度并行化方面具有更高算术强度，但难以扩展到长上下文；ARMs在批处理推理中吞吐量更优；块解码DLMs能平衡算术强度和上下文扩展性。

Conclusion: DLMs在减少采样步数后有望提供比ARMs更低的延迟，但需要进一步优化以充分发挥其并行化潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance on a
broad range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including document
processing and coding. Autoregressive Language Models (ARMs), which generate
tokens sequentially conditioned on all previous tokens, have been the
predominant paradigm for LLMs. However, while these networks have achieved high
accuracy across a range of downstream tasks, they exhibit low arithmetic
intensity due to the inherent sequential dependency with next-token prediction.
Recently, Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative architecture. DLMs generate output text in parallel, breaking the
limitations of sequential dependency. However, the performance implications of
DLMs relative to commonly deployed ARMs are not fully understood. In this work,
we present a comprehensive performance study analyzing the performance
characteristics of ARMs and DLMs, using both theoretical analysis and profiling
data to characterize the trade-offs between these approaches. We illustrate
that although DLMs exhibit higher arithmetic intensity compared to ARMs because
of their capability to utilize parallelism across sequence lengths, they fail
to scale effectively to longer contexts. We then explore DLMs with block-wise
decoding, outlining how this approach allows for increased arithmetic
intensity, while still scaling well to long contexts (similar to ARMs). We also
show interesting trade-offs for batched inference, where we find that ARMs
exhibit superior throughput, as they benefit more from parallelism across
sequences in the batch. Finally, we highlight opportunities for accelerating
DLM inference, and, in particular, highlight the importance of reducing the
number of sampling steps for allowing open-source DLMs to provide improved
latency relative to ARMs.

Motivation: 为注意力机制和一阶状态空间模型提供一种振荡、全局的替代方案，利用物理偏微分方程的归纳偏置来改进神经网络架构。

Method: 使用基于FFT的辛谱求解器实现二阶波动方程的微分模拟，每层通过可训练的空间速度c(x)和阻尼γ(x)传播隐藏状态，时间复杂度为O(n log n)。

Result: 在语言和视觉基准测试中，Wave-PDE Nets达到或超过Transformer性能，同时减少30%的运行时间和25%的峰值内存使用。

Conclusion: Wave-PDE Nets是一种计算高效且鲁棒的架构，具有强大的物理归纳偏置，辛积分和谱拉普拉斯算子对稳定性和性能至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce Wave-PDE Nets, a neural architecture whose elementary operation
is a differentiable simulation of the second-order wave equation. Each layer
propagates its hidden state as a continuous field through a medium with
trainable spatial velocity c(x) and damping {\gamma}(x). A symplectic spectral
solver based on FFTs realises this propagation in O(nlog n) time. This
oscillatory, global mechanism provides a powerful alternative to attention and
first-order state-space models. We prove that a single Wave-PDE layer is a
universal approximator. On language and vision benchmarks, Wave-PDE Nets match
or exceed Transformer performance while demonstrating superior practical
efficiency, reducing wall-clock time by up to 30% and peak memory by 25%.
Ablation studies confirm the critical role of symplectic integration and a
spectral Laplacian for stability and performance. Visualizations of the learned
physical parameters reveal that the model learns intuitive strategies for
information propagation. These results position Wave-PDE Nets as a
computationally efficient and robust architecture with a strong physical
inductive bias.

TL;DR: 提出了高斯部分信息分解(GPID)方法，通过梯度优化算法提高计算效率，并利用信息保持编码器将非高斯数据转换为高斯分布，解决了传统PID方法在连续高维模态中的计算成本高和精度低的问题。


<details>

Motivation: 传统部分信息分解(PID)方法在处理连续高维模态时，由于需要优化受限于估计的成对概率分布的联合分布，计算成本高且精度低。

Method: 1. 提出高斯PID(GPID)框架，当成对分布为多元高斯时高效求解；2. 开发基于梯度优化的新算法；3. 使用信息保持编码器将任意分布的随机变量转换为成对高斯随机变量。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了PID的计算效率和准确性，解决了传统方法在连续高维模态中的局限性，为多模态数据分析提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: The study of multimodality has garnered significant interest in fields where
the analysis of interactions among multiple information sources can enhance
predictive modeling, data fusion, and interpretability. Partial information
decomposition (PID) has emerged as a useful information-theoretic framework to
quantify the degree to which individual modalities independently, redundantly,
or synergistically convey information about a target variable. However,
existing PID methods depend on optimizing over a joint distribution constrained
by estimated pairwise probability distributions, which are costly and
inaccurate for continuous and high-dimensional modalities. Our first key
insight is that the problem can be solved efficiently when the pairwise
distributions are multivariate Gaussians, and we refer to this problem as
Gaussian PID (GPID). We propose a new gradient-based algorithm that
substantially improves the computational efficiency of GPID based on an
alternative formulation of the underlying optimization problem. To generalize
the applicability to non-Gaussian data, we learn information-preserving
encoders to transform random variables of arbitrary input distributions into
pairwise Gaussian random variables. Along the way, we resolved an open problem
regarding the optimality of joint Gaussian solutions for GPID. Empirical
validation in diverse synthetic examples demonstrates that our proposed method
provides more accurate and efficient PID estimates than existing baselines. We
further evaluate a series of large-scale multimodal benchmarks to show its
utility in real-world applications of quantifying PID in multimodal datasets
and selecting high-performing models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM的自回归解码限制了整体性重新审视和优化早期推理步骤的能力，也导致多样化解决方案探索效率低下。

Method: 使用VAE构建结构化潜在推理空间，将文本推理步骤编码为思想标记块；然后利用潜在扩散模型通过块状双向注意力掩码去噪潜在思想标记，支持长程推理和自适应计算。

Result: 在数学推理和规划基准测试中，LaDiR在准确性、多样性和可解释性方面均优于现有自回归、基于扩散和潜在推理方法。

Conclusion: LaDiR为文本推理提供了一个新的潜在扩散范式，展示了在推理任务中的显著优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate their reasoning ability through
chain-of-thought (CoT) generation. However, LLM's autoregressive decoding may
limit the ability to revisit and refine earlier tokens in a holistic manner,
which can also lead to inefficient exploration for diverse solutions. In this
paper, we propose LaDiR (Latent Diffusion Reasoner), a novel reasoning
framework that unifies the expressiveness of continuous latent representation
with the iterative refinement capabilities of latent diffusion models for an
existing LLM. We first construct a structured latent reasoning space using a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that encodes text reasoning steps into blocks of
thought tokens, preserving semantic information and interpretability while
offering compact but expressive representations. Subsequently, we utilize a
latent diffusion model that learns to denoise a block of latent thought tokens
with a blockwise bidirectional attention mask, enabling longer horizon and
iterative refinement with adaptive test-time compute. This design allows
efficient parallel generation of diverse reasoning trajectories, allowing the
model to plan and revise the reasoning process holistically. We conduct
evaluations on a suite of mathematical reasoning and planning benchmarks.
Empirical results show that LaDiR consistently improves accuracy, diversity,
and interpretability over existing autoregressive, diffusion-based, and latent
reasoning methods, revealing a new paradigm for text reasoning with latent
diffusion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM应用中的上下文适应方法存在简洁性偏见（丢弃领域洞察以追求简洁摘要）和上下文崩溃（迭代重写随时间侵蚀细节）的问题，需要更有效的上下文管理框架。

Method: ACE框架将上下文视为演化策略手册，通过模块化的生成、反思和策展过程进行结构化、增量式更新，保持详细知识并适应长上下文模型。

Result: 在代理和领域特定基准测试中，ACE在离线（如系统提示）和在线（如代理记忆）上下文优化方面均优于强基线：代理任务提升10.6%，金融任务提升8.6%，同时显著降低适应延迟和部署成本。

Conclusion: 全面且不断演化的上下文能够实现可扩展、高效且自我改进的LLM系统，且开销较低，ACE在AppWorld排行榜上匹配顶级生产级代理并在更难的测试挑战中超越之。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) applications such as agents and domain-specific
reasoning increasingly rely on context adaptation -- modifying inputs with
instructions, strategies, or evidence, rather than weight updates. Prior
approaches improve usability but often suffer from brevity bias, which drops
domain insights for concise summaries, and from context collapse, where
iterative rewriting erodes details over time. Building on the adaptive memory
introduced by Dynamic Cheatsheet, we introduce ACE (Agentic Context
Engineering), a framework that treats contexts as evolving playbooks that
accumulate, refine, and organize strategies through a modular process of
generation, reflection, and curation. ACE prevents collapse with structured,
incremental updates that preserve detailed knowledge and scale with
long-context models. Across agent and domain-specific benchmarks, ACE optimizes
contexts both offline (e.g., system prompts) and online (e.g., agent memory),
consistently outperforming strong baselines: +10.6% on agents and +8.6% on
finance, while significantly reducing adaptation latency and rollout cost.
Notably, ACE could adapt effectively without labeled supervision and instead by
leveraging natural execution feedback. On the AppWorld leaderboard, ACE matches
the top-ranked production-level agent on the overall average and surpasses it
on the harder test-challenge split, despite using a smaller open-source model.
These results show that comprehensive, evolving contexts enable scalable,
efficient, and self-improving LLM systems with low overhead.

Conclusion: ONNX-Bench和ONNX-Net突破了传统NAS方法的搜索空间限制，为跨架构性能预测提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) automates the design process of
high-performing architectures, but remains bottlenecked by expensive
performance evaluation. Most existing studies that achieve faster evaluation
are mostly tied to cell-based search spaces and graph encodings tailored to
those individual search spaces, limiting their flexibility and scalability when
applied to more expressive search spaces. In this work, we aim to close the gap
of individual search space restrictions and search space dependent network
representations. We present ONNX-Bench, a benchmark consisting of a collection
of neural networks in a unified format based on ONNX files. ONNX-Bench includes
all open-source NAS-bench-based neural networks, resulting in a total size of
more than 600k {architecture, accuracy} pairs. This benchmark allows creating a
shared neural network representation, ONNX-Net, able to represent any neural
architecture using natural language descriptions acting as an input to a
performance predictor. This text-based encoding can accommodate arbitrary layer
types, operation parameters, and heterogeneous topologies, enabling a single
surrogate to generalise across all neural architectures rather than being
confined to cell-based search spaces. Experiments show strong zero-shot
performance across disparate search spaces using only a small amount of
pretraining samples, enabling the unprecedented ability to evaluate any neural
network architecture instantly.

Method: 将SSD从标量恒等情况推广到一般对角SSM，建立SSM与1-半可分掩码注意力等价的条件，分析标准softmax注意力无法扩展对偶性的原因。

Result: 证明对角SSM在保持标量情况训练复杂度下界的同时支持更丰富的动态，建立了SSM与1-半可分掩码注意力等价的充要条件，发现标准softmax注意力由于秩爆炸无法扩展对偶性。

Conclusion: 研究加强了递归SSM与Transformer之间的桥梁，为设计表达力强且高效的序列模型拓宽了设计空间。

Abstract: Structured State-Space Duality (SSD) [Dao & Gu, ICML 2024] is an equivalence
between a simple Structured State-Space Model (SSM) and a masked attention
mechanism. In particular, a state-space model with a scalar-times-identity
state matrix is equivalent to a masked self-attention with a $1$-semiseparable
causal mask. Consequently, the same sequence transformation (model) has two
algorithmic realizations: as a linear-time $O(T)$ recurrence or as a
quadratic-time $O(T^2)$ attention. In this note, we formalize and generalize
this duality: (i) we extend SSD from the scalar-identity case to general
diagonal SSMs (diagonal state matrices); (ii) we show that these diagonal SSMs
match the scalar case's training complexity lower bounds while supporting
richer dynamics; (iii) we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under
which an SSM is equivalent to $1$-semiseparable masked attention; and (iv) we
show that such duality fails to extend to standard softmax attention due to
rank explosion. Together, these results tighten bridge between recurrent SSMs
and Transformers, and widen the design space for expressive yet efficient
sequence models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大时间序列基础模型采用通道独立架构，忽略了关键的跨通道依赖关系；同时现有的多模态方法未能充分利用大型视觉模型解释时空数据的能力；不同模态信息提取的优势尚未充分挖掘以提升时间序列预测性能。

Method: 将多元时间序列渲染为图像，使用预训练的大型视觉模型提取复杂的跨通道模式，将这些视觉特征与时间序列模态的表征进行对齐和融合，冻结大型视觉模型仅训练7.45%的参数。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: VIFO提供了一种高效有效的解决方案，用于捕获时间序列中的跨变量关系。

Abstract: Large time series foundation models often adopt channel-independent
architectures to handle varying data dimensions, but this design ignores
crucial cross-channel dependencies. Concurrently, existing multimodal
approaches have not fully exploited the power of large vision models (LVMs) to
interpret spatiotemporal data. Additionally, there remains significant
unexplored potential in leveraging the advantages of information extraction
from different modalities to enhance time series forecasting performance. To
address these gaps, we propose the VIFO, a cross-modal forecasting model. VIFO
uniquely renders multivariate time series into image, enabling pre-trained LVM
to extract complex cross-channel patterns that are invisible to
channel-independent models. These visual features are then aligned and fused
with representations from the time series modality. By freezing the LVM and
training only 7.45% of its parameters, VIFO achieves competitive performance on
multiple benchmarks, offering an efficient and effective solution for capturing

Motivation: 传统方法在推理任务中对所有提示进行固定均匀采样会导致梯度估计不稳定，限制了强化学习在大语言模型中的应用效果。

Method: 提出在线连续消除过程，将估计和采样交错进行，自动在收集到足够信号时停止对提示的采样；通过形成具有强制奖励多样性的固定大小组，并使用在自适应采样阶段聚合的全局统计量计算优势基线来稳定更新。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了方差感知、自适应数据整理在实现高效可靠的大语言模型强化学习中的核心作用。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) for reasoning
tasks is often bottlenecked by unstable gradient estimates due to fixed and
uniform sampling of responses across prompts. Prior work such as GVM-RAFT
addresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to
minimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by
this insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for
online RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort
to the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike
conventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation
and sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically
stops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize
updates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute
advantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive
sampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and
reasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and
improves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced
sampling variant. Our work highlights the central role of variance-aware,
adaptive data curation in enabling efficient and reliable reinforcement
learning for reasoning-capable LLMs. Code is available at

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of deep neural networks (DNNs) in the presence of
real world noise and intentional perturbations remains a significant challenge.
To address this, attribution methods have been proposed, though their efficacy
remains suboptimal and necessitates further refinement. In this paper, we
propose a novel category of transferable adversarial attacks, called
transferable frequency-aware attacks, enabling frequency-aware exploration via
both high-and low-frequency components. Based on this type of attacks, we also
propose a novel attribution method, named Frequency-Aware Model Parameter
Explorer (FAMPE), which improves the explainability for DNNs. Relative to the
current state-of-the-art method AttEXplore, our FAMPE attains an average gain
of 13.02% in Insertion Score, thereby outperforming existing approaches.
Through detailed ablation studies, we also investigate the role of both high-
and low-frequency components in explainability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究比较了四种神经算子架构用于快速预测脑位移场，旨在实现创伤性脑损伤的实时建模。MG-FNO获得最高精度，F-FNO收敛速度最快，DeepONet推理速度最快，所有方法都将计算时间从小时级缩短到毫秒级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创伤性脑损伤是全球重大公共卫生问题，传统有限元模型计算成本高，限制了临床快速决策的应用。需要开发快速、患者特异性的脑位移预测方法。

Method: 将TBI建模为算子学习问题，使用四种神经算子架构（FNO、F-FNO、MG-FNO、DeepONet）从患者特异性MRI、MRE刚度图和人口统计学特征映射到全脑3D位移预测。在249个MRE数据集上训练评估。

Result: MG-FNO达到最高精度（MSE=0.0023，94.3%空间保真度），F-FNO收敛速度比标准FNO快2倍，DeepONet推理速度最快（14.5次迭代/秒），比MG-FNO快7倍。所有方法都将计算时间从小时缩短到毫秒。

Conclusion: 神经算子为预测脑变形提供了高效、分辨率不变的方法，为实时患者特异性TBI风险评估、临床分诊支持和防护设备优化打开了大门，展示了基于神经算子的人脑数字孪生潜力。

Abstract: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major public health concern, with over
69 million cases annually worldwide. Finite element (FE) models offer
high-fidelity predictions of brain deformation but are computationally
expensive, requiring hours per simulation and limiting their clinical utility
for rapid decision-making. This study benchmarks state-of-the-art neural
operator (NO) architectures for rapid, patient-specific prediction of brain
displacement fields, aiming to enable real-time TBI modeling in clinical and
translational settings. We formulated TBI modeling as an operator learning
problem, mapping subject-specific anatomical MRI, magnetic resonance
elastography (MRE) stiffness maps, and demographic features to full-field 3D
brain displacement predictions. Four architectures - Fourier Neural Operator
(FNO), Factorized FNO (F-FNO), Multi-Grid FNO (MG-FNO), and Deep Operator
Network (DeepONet) were trained and evaluated on 249 MRE datasets across
physiologically relevant frequencies (20 - 90 Hz). MG-FNO achieved the highest
accuracy (MSE = 0.0023, 94.3\% spatial fidelity) and preserved fine-scale
features, while F-FNO converged 2$\times$ faster than standard FNO. DeepONet
offered the fastest inference (14.5 iterations/s) with a 7$\times$
computational speed-up over MG-FNO, suggesting utility for embedded or edge
computing applications. All NOs reduced computation time from hours to
milliseconds without sacrificing anatomical realism. NOs provide an efficient,
resolution-invariant approach for predicting brain deformation, opening the
door to real-time, patient-specific TBI risk assessment, clinical triage
support, and optimization of protective equipment. These results highlight the
potential for NO-based digital twins of the human brain, enabling scalable,
on-demand biomechanical modeling in both clinical and population health
contexts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了通用多域翻译（UMDT）框架，使用扩散路由（DR）方法，只需K-1个配对数据集就能实现K个域之间的任意双向翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要完全对齐的元组或只能处理训练中见过的域对，限制了实用性并排除了许多跨域映射。

Method: 使用扩散路由框架，通过中心域路由实现间接翻译，结合变分下界目标和Tweedie精炼程序支持直接映射。

Result: 在三个大规模UMDT基准测试中取得最先进结果，降低了采样成本，并解锁了草图↔分割等新任务。

Conclusion: DR作为一个可扩展且通用的框架，能够实现跨多个域的通用翻译。

Abstract: Multi-domain translation (MDT) aims to learn translations between multiple
domains, yet existing approaches either require fully aligned tuples or can
only handle domain pairs seen in training, limiting their practicality and
excluding many cross-domain mappings. We introduce universal MDT (UMDT), a
generalization of MDT that seeks to translate between any pair of $K$ domains
using only $K-1$ paired datasets with a central domain. To tackle this problem,
we propose Diffusion Router (DR), a unified diffusion-based framework that
models all central$\leftrightarrow$non-central translations with a single noise
predictor conditioned on the source and target domain labels. DR enables
indirect non-central translations by routing through the central domain. We
further introduce a novel scalable learning strategy with a variational-bound
objective and an efficient Tweedie refinement procedure to support direct
non-central mappings. Through evaluation on three large-scale UMDT benchmarks,
DR achieves state-of-the-art results for both indirect and direct translations,
while lowering sampling cost and unlocking novel tasks such as
sketch$\leftrightarrow$segmentation. These results establish DR as a scalable
and versatile framework for universal translation across multiple domains.

*Avichal Goel,Yoon Kim,Nir Shavit,Tony T. Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT) 是一种训练模型描述自身微调引起修改的方法，通过合成标记的权重差异来训练DIT适配器，使微调后的模型能够用自然语言准确描述其变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调语言模型时，权重变化通常难以解释。虽然检查微调数据集可以了解模型可能的变化，但这些数据集往往不公开或过于庞大。目标是全面理解权重差异的自然语言描述。

Method: 引入Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT)方法，使用合成的标记权重差异来训练DIT适配器。该适配器可应用于兼容的微调模型，使其能够描述自身的变化。

Result: 在两个概念验证场景（报告隐藏行为和总结微调知识）中，该方法使模型能够使用准确的自然语言描述其微调引起的修改。

Conclusion: DIT方法成功实现了让模型用自然语言描述自身微调变化的目标，为理解模型权重变化提供了新的解释性工具。

Abstract: Finetuning (pretrained) language models is a standard approach for updating
their internal parametric knowledge and specializing them to new tasks and
domains. However, the corresponding model weight changes ("weight diffs") are
not generally interpretable. While inspecting the finetuning dataset can give a
sense of how the model might have changed, these datasets are often not
publicly available or are too large to work with directly. Towards the goal of
comprehensively understanding weight diffs in natural language, we introduce
Diff Interpretation Tuning (DIT), a method that trains models to describe their
own finetuning-induced modifications. Our approach uses synthetic, labeled
weight diffs to train a DIT adapter, which can be applied to a compatible
finetuned model to make it describe how it has changed. We demonstrate in two
proof-of-concept settings (reporting hidden behaviors and summarizing finetuned
knowledge) that our method enables models to describe their finetuning-induced
modifications using accurate natural language descriptions.

*Andi Zhang,Xuan Ding,Haofan Wang,Steven McDonagh,Samuel Kaski*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了正交蒙特卡洛Dropout方法，在合并LoRA模块时强制正交性以避免语义向量干扰，但实证发现正交性本身不足以实现语义组合性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在合并多个模块时，语义向量可能相互干扰，需要确保合并后的LoRA保持正交以避免直接干扰。

Method: 正交蒙特卡洛Dropout，在不增加时间复杂度的前提下强制稀疏语义向量组合时的严格正交性。

Result: 理论上和运行时都能保证合并LoRA的正交性，但实证分析显示这种正交性并未带来语义解耦或组合性。

Conclusion: 仅靠LoRA间的正交性可能不足以实现真正的语义组合性，需要重新审视其在适配器合并中的作用。

Abstract: We propose Orthogonal Monte Carlo Dropout, a mechanism that enforces strict
orthogonality when combining sparse semantic vectors without extra time
complexity. LoRA, a popular fine-tuning method for large models, typically
trains a module to represent a specific concept such as an object or a style.
When multiple LoRAs are merged, for example to generate an object in a
particular style, their semantic vectors may interfere with each other. Our
method guarantees, at the theoretical and runtime levels, that merged LoRAs
remain orthogonal and thus free from direct interference. However, empirical
analysis reveals that such orthogonality does not lead to the semantic
disentanglement or compositionality highlighted in prior work on compositional
adaptation. This finding suggests that inter-LoRA orthogonality alone may be
insufficient for achieving true semantic compositionality, prompting a
re-examination of its role in adapter merging.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BVPO是一种偏好优化方法，通过混合高方差的轨迹估计器和低方差的空轨迹估计器来减少推理轨迹采样带来的梯度方差，提高大型推理模型的训练稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在生成最终答案前会产生中间推理轨迹，但在偏好对齐过程中，对推理轨迹进行边际化计算是不可行的。常用的单轨迹采样优化方法会引入显著的梯度方差。

Method: 提出BVPO方法，混合两种梯度估计器：高方差的轨迹估计器和低方差的空轨迹估计器（禁用推理轨迹生成），通过优化偏差-方差权衡来减少方差。

Result: 在AlpacaEval~2上比最佳基线提升7.8分，在Arena-Hard上提升6.8分。仅使用通用对话数据训练，也能在六个数学推理基准上平均提升4.0分。

Conclusion: 轨迹采样方差是关键瓶颈，直接优化偏差-方差权衡能带来更稳定的训练和更强的整体性能。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) generate intermediate reasoning traces before
producing final answers, yielding strong gains on multi-step and mathematical
tasks. Yet aligning LRMs with human preferences, a crucial prerequisite for
model deployment, remains underexplored. The statistically correct objective
for preference alignment requires marginalizing over reasoning traces, but this
computation is intractable in practice. A common workaround optimizes a single
sampled trajectory, which introduces substantial gradient variance from
stochastic trace sampling. To address this challenge, we frame preference
optimization for LRMs through the lens of the bias--variance trade-off and
propose Bias--Variance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO), a simple,
drop-in method that mixes two gradient estimators: a high-variance trace-based
estimator and a low-variance empty-trace estimator obtained by disabling
reasoning trace generation. Our theory shows that BVPO strictly reduces
trace-induced variance for any nontrivial mixture, provides a closed-form
choice of the mixing weight that minimizes mean-squared error relative to the
true marginal gradient, and under standard smoothness and step-size conditions,
tightens classical convergence bounds for stochastic gradient descent.
Empirically, BVPO improves alignment over the best baseline by up to 7.8 points
on AlpacaEval~2 and 6.8 points on Arena-Hard. Despite being trained only on
general conversational data, BVPO also boosts reasoning performance for base
models by up to 4.0 points on the average of six math reasoning benchmarks.
These results identify variance from trace sampling as a key bottleneck and
demonstrate that directly optimizing the bias--variance trade-off yields more
stable training and stronger overall performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SDQ-LLM是一种用于1位LLM的Sigma-Delta量化框架，通过过采样率和Hadamard权重平滑技术实现极低比特量化，同时保持语言推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在计算和内存方面的挑战，实现高效部署的极低比特量化。

Method: 使用上采样结合Sigma-Delta量化器将权重二值化或三值化，采用Hadamard权重平滑和细粒度的MultiOSR分配策略。

Result: 在OPT和LLaMA模型系列上的广泛实验表明，SDQ-LLM在极低过采样率设置下实现了更高效和高精度的性能。

Conclusion: SDQ-LLM框架为LLM的极低比特量化提供了有效的解决方案，在模型大小和精度之间实现了最佳权衡。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant computational and memory
challenges, making extremely low-bit quantization crucial for their efficient
deployment. In this work, we introduce SDQ-LLM: Sigma-Delta Quantization for
1-bit LLMs of any size, a novel framework that enables extremely low-bit
quantization of LLMs while preserving their linguistic reasoning capabilities.
A distinctive feature of SDQ-LLM is the continuous adjustability of the
Over-Sampling Ratio (OSR), enabling dynamic adaptation to memory or VRAM
constraints by selecting fractional OSR (e.g. 2.5 times) for an optimal
trade-off between model size and accuracy. SDQ-LLM uses upsampling combined
with Sigma-Delta Quantizer to binarize or ternarize LLMs weights, encoding
high-precision parameters into 1-bit or 1.58-bit representations, replacing the
multiplication operations within linear layers with addition. This approach
significantly enhances inference efficiency under extremely low-bit
quantization. To further reduce the loss of quantization precision, we
incorporate Hadamard-based weight smoothing prior to quantization, improving
the stability and robustness of the weight representations. Furthermore, to
fully leverage the continuity of the OSR and reduce precision loss, recognizing
the correlation between quantization sensitivity and weight variance, we
propose a fine-grained, layer- and linear-wise OSR allocation strategy,
MultiOSR. This strategy distributes OSR both across layers and within each
layer, based on weight variance and parameter scale. Finally, extensive
experiments on OPT and LLaMA model families demonstrate that SDQ-LLM achieves a
more efficient and high-precision performance even under highly aggressive
low-OSR settings. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了概念擦除技术在扩散模型中只是制造了"遗忘"的假象，实际上只是偏置采样轨迹远离目标概念，这种擦除是可逆的。作者提出了RevAm框架，通过RL轨迹优化复活被擦除的概念，无需修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型架构演进到新一代如Flux，现有的概念擦除方法（如ESD、UCE、AC）效果下降，需要理解其真正机制。研究发现这些方法并非真正移除概念，而是通过轨迹偏置制造安全假象。

Method: 提出RevAm框架，基于强化学习的轨迹优化方法，将Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）适配到扩散模型中，通过轨迹级奖励动态引导去噪过程，探索多样化的恢复轨迹。

Result: 实验表明RevAm在概念复活保真度上表现优越，同时将计算时间减少了10倍，暴露了当前安全机制的关键漏洞。

Conclusion: 当前基于轨迹操纵的擦除技术存在根本性脆弱性，需要开发超越轨迹操纵的更鲁棒的擦除方法，区分表面安全与真正的概念移除。

Abstract: Concept erasure techniques have been widely deployed in T2I diffusion models
to prevent inappropriate content generation for safety and copyright
considerations. However, as models evolve to next-generation architectures like
Flux, established erasure methods (\textit{e.g.}, ESD, UCE, AC) exhibit
degraded effectiveness, raising questions about their true mechanisms. Through
systematic analysis, we reveal that concept erasure creates only an illusion of
``amnesia": rather than genuine forgetting, these methods bias sampling
trajectories away from target concepts, making the erasure fundamentally
reversible. This insight motivates the need to distinguish superficial safety
from genuine concept removal. In this work, we propose \textbf{RevAm}
(\underline{Rev}oking \underline{Am}nesia), an RL-based trajectory optimization
framework that resurrects erased concepts by dynamically steering the denoising
process without modifying model weights. By adapting Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to diffusion models, RevAm explores diverse recovery
trajectories through trajectory-level rewards, overcoming local optima that
limit existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RevAm achieves
superior concept resurrection fidelity while reducing computational time by
10$\times$, exposing critical vulnerabilities in current safety mechanisms and
underscoring the need for more robust erasure techniques beyond trajectory
manipulation.

Motivation: 解决当前数据无知识蒸馏方法存在的问题：缺乏伪监督范式、无法区分不同类别样本分布、无法优化类别多样性样本，这些限制了学生模型的性能提升。

Method: 使用条件生成对抗网络合成类别特定的多样化图像；改进生成器模块以更好区分不同类别分布；提出基于教师和学生视图的伪监督对比学习来增强样本多样性。

Conclusion: CPSC-DFKD通过条件伪监督对比学习有效解决了当前数据无知识蒸馏方法的局限性，在保护隐私的同时实现了更好的模型压缩和传输效果。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation~(DFKD) is an effective manner to solve model
compression and transmission restrictions while retaining privacy protection,
which has attracted extensive attention in recent years. Currently, the
majority of existing methods utilize a generator to synthesize images to
support the distillation. Although the current methods have achieved great
success, there are still many issues to be explored. Firstly, the outstanding
performance of supervised learning in deep learning drives us to explore a
pseudo-supervised paradigm on DFKD. Secondly, current synthesized methods
cannot distinguish the distributions of different categories of samples, thus
producing ambiguous samples that may lead to an incorrect evaluation by the
teacher. Besides, current methods cannot optimize the category-wise diversity
samples, which will hinder the student model learning from diverse samples and
further achieving better performance. In this paper, to address the above
limitations, we propose a novel learning paradigm, i.e., conditional
pseudo-supervised contrast for data-free knowledge distillation~(CPSC-DFKD).
The primary innovations of CPSC-DFKD are: (1) introducing a conditional
generative adversarial network to synthesize category-specific diverse images
for pseudo-supervised learning, (2) improving the modules of the generator to
distinguish the distributions of different categories, and (3) proposing
pseudo-supervised contrastive learning based on teacher and student views to
enhance diversity. Comprehensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets
validate the performance lift of both the student and generator brought by
CPSC-DFKD. The code is available at https://github.com/RoryShao/CPSC-DFKD.git

Method: 使用分段二次插值路径作为流匹配的平滑目标，联合优化漂移项和数据驱动的扩散系数，并基于理论条件确保学习稳定性

Result: 在合成基准和真实神经影像数据集上，IMMFM在预测准确性和下游任务中都优于现有方法

Conclusion: IMMFM能够捕捉内在随机性，处理不规则稀疏采样，并生成个体特异性轨迹，为序列数据建模提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Generative models for sequential data often struggle with sparsely sampled
and high-dimensional trajectories, typically reducing the learning of dynamics
to pairwise transitions. We propose \textit{Interpolative Multi-Marginal Flow
Matching} (IMMFM), a framework that learns continuous stochastic dynamics
jointly consistent with multiple observed time points. IMMFM employs a
piecewise-quadratic interpolation path as a smooth target for flow matching and
jointly optimizes drift and a data-driven diffusion coefficient, supported by a
theoretical condition for stable learning. This design captures intrinsic
stochasticity, handles irregular sparse sampling, and yields subject-specific
trajectories. Experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real-world longitudinal
neuroimaging datasets show that IMMFM outperforms existing methods in both
forecasting accuracy and further downstream tasks.

Motivation: 小型视觉语言模型计算效率高但泛化能力和下游任务性能较弱，现有测试时扩展方法计算量大，违背小型模型资源高效的设计目标。

Method: 提出两种策略：(1) TTAug：生成多个增强输入并在token级别聚合输出，无需参数更新；(2) TTAdapt：使用TTAug生成的基于共识的伪标签在推理时调整模型参数。

Result: 在九个基准测试中展示了一致的性能提升，同时保持了适合资源受限环境的计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同规模模型和不同视觉语言模型中都具有通用性，无需额外调优即可实现性能提升。

Abstract: Small Vision-Language Models (VLMs) provide a computationally efficient
alternative to larger models, at the cost of weaker generalization abilities
and downstream task performance. These shortcomings could be addressed by
test-time scaling techniques, but existing methods are typically
computationally demanding, contradicting the resource-efficient design goals of
small models. To address these limitations, we propose two novel and efficient
test-time scaling strategies that leverage the model-internal features rather
than external supervision: (i) Test-Time Augmentation (TTAug), which generates
multiple augmented inputs and aggregates outputs at the token level without
parameter updates, and (ii) Test-Time Adaptation (TTAdapt), which adapts model
parameters during inference using consensus-based pseudolabels from TTAug.
Through extensive experiments across nine benchmarks, we demonstrate consistent
performance improvements while maintaining computational efficiency suitable
for resource-constrained environments. The generality of our approach is
demonstrated both within models at different scales and across different VLMs
without additional tuning.

Motivation: 传统监督学习方法需要网络参数数量依赖于类别数量，限制了在类别数量极大或未知时的应用。

Method: 使用预定义的向量系统（如An根系统的随机扰动向量）作为目标潜空间配置，通过匹配网络预测与预定义向量来训练编码器和视觉变换器。

Conclusion: 该方法可应用于极多类别场景，并在持续学习和网络蒸馏方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Supervised learning (SL) methods are indispensable for neural network (NN)
training used to perform classification tasks. While resulting in very high
accuracy, SL training often requires making NN parameter number dependent on
the number of classes, limiting their applicability when the number of classes
is extremely large or unknown in advance. In this paper we propose a
methodology that allows one to train the same NN architecture regardless of the
number of classes. This is achieved by using predefined vector systems as the
target latent space configuration (LSC) during NN training. We discuss the
desired properties of target configurations and choose randomly perturbed
vectors of An root system for our experiments. These vectors are used to
successfully train encoders and visual transformers (ViT) on Cinic-10 and
ImageNet-1K in low- and high-dimensional cases by matching NN predictions with
the predefined vectors. Finally, ViT is trained on a dataset with 1.28 million
classes illustrating the applicability of the method to training on datasets
with extremely large number of classes. In addition, potential applications of
LSC in lifelong learning and NN distillation are discussed illustrating
versatility of the proposed methodology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DoRA虽然改进了LoRA的学习能力和训练稳定性，但仍存在训练不稳定和样本效率不足的问题，需要进一步优化。

Method: 1. 在DoRA权重分解的分母中注入噪声作为自适应正则化器；2. 用辅助网络动态生成低秩矩阵，实现跨层参数耦合。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，DoRAN持续优于LoRA、DoRA和其他PEFT基线方法。

Conclusion: 结合噪声正则化和网络参数生成的方法为基础模型的稳健高效微调提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have become the standard
paradigm for adapting large-scale models. Among these techniques,
Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) has been shown to improve both the
learning capacity and training stability of the vanilla Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) method by explicitly decomposing pre-trained weights into magnitude and
directional components. In this work, we propose DoRAN, a new variant of DoRA
designed to further stabilize training and boost the sample efficiency of DoRA.
Our approach includes two key stages: (i) injecting noise into the denominator
of DoRA's weight decomposition, which serves as an adaptive regularizer to
mitigate instabilities; and (ii) replacing static low-rank matrices with
auxiliary networks that generate them dynamically, enabling parameter coupling
across layers and yielding better sample efficiency in both theory and
practice. Comprehensive experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that
DoRAN consistently outperforms LoRA, DoRA, and other PEFT baselines. These
results underscore the effectiveness of combining stabilization through
noise-based regularization with network-based parameter generation, offering a
promising direction for robust and efficient fine-tuning of foundation models.

Abstract: Accurate and fast urban noise prediction is pivotal for public health and for
regulatory workflows in cities, where the Environmental Noise Directive
mandates regular strategic noise maps and action plans, often needed in

Physics-based solvers are too slow for such time-critical, iterative "what-if"

for generating standards-compliant urban sound-pressure maps from 2D urban
layouts in real time per 256x256 map on a single RTX 4090), enabling
interactive exploration directly on commodity hardware. On datasets covering
Baseline, Diffraction, and Reflection regimes, our model accelerates map
generation by >2000 times over a reference solver while improving NLoS accuracy
by up to 24% versus prior deep models; in Baseline NLoS we reach 0.65 dB MAE
with high structural fidelity. The model reproduces diffraction and
interference patterns and supports instant recomputation under source or
geometry changes, making it a practical engine for urban planning, compliance
mapping, and operations (e.g., temporary road closures, night-work variance
assessments).

*Seunghyeon Kim,Jinho Kim,Taesun Yeom,Wonpyo Park,Kyuyeun Kim,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RegCache是一种无需训练的算法，通过在视觉编码器中添加前缀标记来缓解异常值问题，从而改善量化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉编码器（如CLIP）在多模态应用中需要实时处理大量视觉数据，降低推理成本至关重要。后训练量化是实用路径，但由于大规模激活（即异常值）的存在，即使在8位精度下仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出RegCache算法，向目标视觉编码器引入易产生异常值但语义无意义的前缀标记，防止其他标记出现异常值。基于视觉编码器中异常值与语言模型不同的观察，提出了中间层前缀和标记删除两项技术创新。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在文本监督和自监督视觉编码器中都能一致提高量化模型的准确性。

Conclusion: RegCache通过训练自由的方式有效缓解了视觉编码器中的异常值问题，为量化提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based vision encoders -- such as CLIP -- are central to
multimodal intelligence, powering applications from autonomous web agents to
robotic control. Since these applications often demand real-time processing of
massive visual data, reducing the inference cost of vision encoders is
critical. Post-training quantization offers a practical path, but remains
challenging even at 8-bit precision due to massive-scale activations (i.e.,
outliers). In this work, we propose $\textit{RegCache}$, a training-free
algorithm to mitigate outliers in vision encoders, enabling quantization with
significantly smaller accuracy drops. The proposed RegCache introduces
outlier-prone yet semantically meaningless prefix tokens to the target vision
encoder, which prevents other tokens from having outliers. Notably, we observe
that outliers in vision encoders behave differently from those in language
models, motivating two technical innovations: middle-layer prefixing and token
deletion. Experiments show that our method consistently improves the accuracy
of quantized models across both text-supervised and self-supervised vision
encoders.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SONA的新型判别器设计，通过分离自然性和对齐性投影，结合自适应权重机制，在条件生成任务中实现了更好的样本质量和条件对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有条件生成对抗网络在判别器中难以平衡真实性和条件对齐的双重目标，导致条件生成效果不佳。

Method: 提出SONA判别器设计，包含三个关键能力：无条件判别、匹配感知监督和自适应权重。使用分离的自然性和对齐性投影，配合专门的损失函数和自适应权重机制。

Result: 在类条件生成任务中，SONA在样本质量和条件对齐方面优于现有最先进方法。在文本到图像生成任务中也验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SONA方法具有多功能性和鲁棒性，能够有效解决条件生成中的真实性和对齐性平衡问题。

Abstract: Deep generative models have made significant advances in generating complex
content, yet conditional generation remains a fundamental challenge. Existing
conditional generative adversarial networks often struggle to balance the dual
objectives of assessing authenticity and conditional alignment of input samples
within their conditional discriminators. To address this, we propose a novel
discriminator design that integrates three key capabilities: unconditional
discrimination, matching-aware supervision to enhance alignment sensitivity,
and adaptive weighting to dynamically balance all objectives. Specifically, we
introduce Sum of Naturalness and Alignment (SONA), which employs separate
projections for naturalness (authenticity) and alignment in the final layer
with an inductive bias, supported by dedicated objective functions and an
adaptive weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on class-conditional
generation tasks show that \ours achieves superior sample quality and
conditional alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we
demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image generation, confirming the
versatility and robustness of our approach.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了轻量级提示工程策略对AI生成问题认知对齐的影响，发现在教育技术中，明确详细的提示对于确保AI生成内容与布鲁姆分类学认知层次精确对齐至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在教育技术中的快速整合，AI生成内容的质量和教学对齐性成为关键挑战。本研究旨在解决AI生成问题在认知层次上的对齐问题，确保其教学有效性。

Method: 使用OneClickQuiz Moodle插件，评估三种提示变体（详细基线、简化版本和基于角色的方法）在布鲁姆分类学的知识、应用和分析层次上的表现，结合自动分类模型和人工评审进行分析。

Result: 研究发现明确详细的提示对于精确的认知对齐至关重要，而简化和基于角色的提示虽然能产生清晰相关的问题，但经常与预期的布鲁姆层次不对齐，产生过于复杂或偏离认知目标的内容。

Conclusion: 研究强调了战略提示工程在培养教学合理的AI驱动教育解决方案中的重要性，并为优化AI在学习和智能学习环境中的内容生成质量提供了建议。

Abstract: The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into educational
technology promises to revolutionize content creation and assessment. However,
the quality and pedagogical alignment of AI-generated content remain critical
challenges. This paper investigates the impact of lightweight prompt
engineering strategies on the cognitive alignment of AI-generated questions
within OneClickQuiz, a Moodle plugin leveraging generative AI. We evaluate
three prompt variants-a detailed baseline, a simpler version, and a
persona-based approach-across Knowledge, Application, and Analysis levels of
Bloom's Taxonomy. Utilizing an automated classification model (from prior work)
and human review, our findings demonstrate that explicit, detailed prompts are
crucial for precise cognitive alignment. While simpler and persona-based
prompts yield clear and relevant questions, they frequently misalign with
intended Bloom's levels, generating outputs that are either too complex or
deviate from the desired cognitive objective. This study underscores the
importance of strategic prompt engineering in fostering pedagogically sound
AI-driven educational solutions and advises on optimizing AI for quality
content generation in learning analytics and smart learning environments.

*Toby Drinkall*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个评估框架，通过多轮模拟冲突测试LLMs在军事指挥控制中的目标选择行为，发现现成LLMs存在违反国际人道法的风险，不同模型表现出显著差异的平民伤害容忍度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着军事组织考虑将大语言模型集成到指挥控制系统中用于规划和决策支持，理解其行为倾向变得至关重要，特别是评估其法律和道德风险。

Method: 开发基于国际人道法和军事学说的四个评估指标，在三个地理区域的90个多智能体多轮危机模拟中评估GPT-4o、Gemini-2.5和LLaMA-3.1三个前沿模型。

Result: 现成LLMs在模拟冲突环境中表现出令人担忧且不可预测的目标选择行为。所有模型都违反了区分原则，攻击平民目标的比例从16.7%到66.7%不等。平民伤害容忍度随危机升级而增加，不同模型差异显著。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了概念验证，展示了在决策支持系统中使用LLMs可能出现的潜在行为风险，并提供了一个可复现的基准测试框架，用于标准化部署前测试。

Abstract: As military organisations consider integrating large language models (LLMs)
into command and control (C2) systems for planning and decision support,
understanding their behavioural tendencies is critical. This study develops a
benchmarking framework for evaluating aspects of legal and moral risk in
targeting behaviour by comparing LLMs acting as agents in multi-turn simulated
conflict. We introduce four metrics grounded in International Humanitarian Law
(IHL) and military doctrine: Civilian Target Rate (CTR) and Dual-use Target
Rate (DTR) assess compliance with legal targeting principles, while Mean and
Max Simulated Non-combatant Casualty Value (SNCV) quantify tolerance for
civilian harm.
  We evaluate three frontier models, GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5, and LLaMA-3.1, through
90 multi-agent, multi-turn crisis simulations across three geographic regions.
Our findings reveal that off-the-shelf LLMs exhibit concerning and
unpredictable targeting behaviour in simulated conflict environments. All
models violated the IHL principle of distinction by targeting civilian objects,
with breach rates ranging from 16.7% to 66.7%. Harm tolerance escalated through
crisis simulations with MeanSNCV increasing from 16.5 in early turns to 27.7 in
late turns. Significant inter-model variation emerged: LLaMA-3.1 selected an
average of 3.47 civilian strikes per simulation with MeanSNCV of 28.4, while
Gemini-2.5 selected 0.90 civilian strikes with MeanSNCV of 17.6. These
differences indicate that model selection for deployment constitutes a choice
about acceptable legal and moral risk profiles in military operations.
  This work seeks to provide a proof-of-concept of potential behavioural risks
that could emerge from the use of LLMs in Decision Support Systems (AI DSS) as
well as a reproducible benchmarking framework with interpretable metrics for
standardising pre-deployment testing.

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出基于Whisper的说话人归属多说话人语音识别模型，结合目标说话人建模和序列化输出训练，通过联合解码实现优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多说话人重叠语音识别问题，克服传统目标说话人ASR系统需要分别解码每个说话人的局限性，实现更高效的联合解码。

Method: 使用Diarization-Conditioned Whisper (DiCoW)编码器提取目标说话人嵌入，将多个说话人表示拼接后输入共享解码器，采用序列化输出训练生成带说话人标签和时间戳的转录。

Result: 在LibriMix等多说话人混合语音数据集上，该模型超越了现有的SOT方法和DiCoW系统。

Conclusion: 提出的说话人归属Whisper模型通过联合解码和序列化输出训练，在多说话人语音识别任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose a speaker-attributed (SA) Whisper-based model for multi-talker
speech recognition that combines target-speaker modeling with serialized output
training (SOT). Our approach leverages a Diarization-Conditioned Whisper
(DiCoW) encoder to extract target-speaker embeddings, which are concatenated
into a single representation and passed to a shared decoder. This enables the
model to transcribe overlapping speech as a serialized output stream with
speaker tags and timestamps. In contrast to target-speaker ASR systems such as
DiCoW, which decode each speaker separately, our approach performs joint
decoding, allowing the decoder to condition on the context of all speakers
simultaneously. Experiments show that the model outperforms existing SOT-based
approaches and surpasses DiCoW on multi-talker mixtures (e.g., LibriMix).

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: MoME框架将稀疏混合专家集成到基于MRL的大语言模型中，用于音频-视觉语音识别，实现动态容量分配和跨尺度泛化，在保持高性能的同时减少参数需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有MRL方法在训练时独立处理每个尺度导致的跨尺度泛化受限、高压缩率下鲁棒性不足和可解释性差的问题。

Method: 在冻结的LLM基础上添加top-k路由和共享专家，通过共享路由器促进跨粒度的一致性专家激活，使压缩序列能从低压缩表示中受益。

Result: 在LRS2和LRS3数据集上，MoME在AVSR、ASR和VSR任务中达到最先进性能，同时显著减少参数需求并在噪声下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MoME统一了MRL的适应性和MoE的效率，为资源感知的语音识别提供了可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in
audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR), but their high computational demands
and sensitivity to token granularity limit their practicality in
resource-constrained settings. Token compression methods can reduce inference
cost, but they require fixing a compression rate in advance and produce a
single fixed-length output, offering no flexibility to balance information
density and efficiency at inference time. Matryoshka representation learning
(MRL) addresses this by enabling a single model to operate across multiple
token granularities, allowing compression rates to be adjusted dynamically.
However, current MRL-based methods treat each scale independently during
training, limiting cross-scale generalization, robustness at high compression,
and interpretability. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoME (Mixture
of Matryoshka Experts), a novel framework that integrates sparse
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) into MRL-based LLMs for AVSR. MoME augments a frozen
LLM with top-k routed and shared experts, allowing dynamic capacity allocation
across scales and modalities. A shared router promotes consistent expert
activation across granularities, enabling compressed sequences to benefit from
representations learned at lower compression. Experiments on LRS2 and LRS3
demonstrate that MoME achieves state-of-the-art performance across AVSR, ASR,
and VSR tasks, while requiring significantly fewer parameters and maintaining
robustness under noise. MoME unifies the adaptability of MRL with the
efficiency of MoE, offering a scalable and interpretable solution for
resource-aware speech recognition.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文是对个性化对话信息检索(CIR)的可重复性研究，重点关注LLM输出变异性和模型泛化能力，在TREC iKAT 2024数据集上验证了PTKB对检索性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究基于GPT-3.5 Turbo的单次实验得出PTKB可能有害的结论，但存在输出变异性和可重复性问题，需要更严谨的多轮评估。

Method: 使用TREC iKAT 2024数据集，评估多种模型(Llama 1B-70B、Qwen-7B、GPT-4o-mini)，比较人工选择与LLM选择的PTKB效果，分析不同数据集的方差。

Result: 人工选择的PTKB持续提升检索性能，LLM选择方法不优于人工选择；iKAT数据集方差高于CAsT；召回指标方差低于精确率指标。

Conclusion: 需要多轮评估和方差报告来评估基于LLM的CIR系统，为个性化CIR提供更稳健和可泛化的实践方法。

Abstract: Personalized Conversational Information Retrieval (CIR) has seen rapid
progress in recent years, driven by the development of Large Language Models
(LLMs). Personalized CIR aims to enhance document retrieval by leveraging
user-specific information, such as preferences, knowledge, or constraints, to
tailor responses to individual needs. A key resource for this task is the TREC
iKAT 2023 dataset, designed to evaluate personalization in CIR pipelines.
Building on this resource, Mo et al. explored several strategies for
incorporating Personal Textual Knowledge Bases (PTKB) into LLM-based query
reformulation. Their findings suggested that personalization from PTKBs could
be detrimental and that human annotations were often noisy. However, these
conclusions were based on single-run experiments using the GPT-3.5 Turbo model,
raising concerns about output variability and repeatability. In this
reproducibility study, we rigorously reproduce and extend their work, focusing
on LLM output variability and model generalization. We apply the original
methods to the new TREC iKAT 2024 dataset and evaluate a diverse range of
models, including Llama (1B-70B), Qwen-7B, GPT-4o-mini. Our results show that
human-selected PTKBs consistently enhance retrieval performance, while
LLM-based selection methods do not reliably outperform manual choices. We
further compare variance across datasets and observe higher variability on iKAT
than on CAsT, highlighting the challenges of evaluating personalized CIR.
Notably, recall-oriented metrics exhibit lower variance than precision-oriented
ones, a critical insight for first-stage retrievers. Finally, we underscore the
need for multi-run evaluations and variance reporting when assessing LLM-based
CIR systems. By broadening evaluation across models, datasets, and metrics, our
study contributes to more robust and generalizable practices for personalized
CIR.

Abstract: People often struggle to remember specific details of past experiences, which
can lead to the need to revisit these memories. Consequently, lifelog retrieval
has emerged as a crucial application. Various studies have explored methods to
facilitate rapid access to personal lifelogs for memory recall assistance. In
this paper, we propose a Captioning-Integrated Visual Lifelog (CIVIL) Retrieval
System for extracting specific images from a user's visual lifelog based on
textual queries. Unlike traditional embedding-based methods, our system first
generates captions for visual lifelogs and then utilizes a text embedding model
to project both the captions and user queries into a shared vector space.
Visual lifelogs, captured through wearable cameras, provide a first-person
viewpoint, necessitating the interpretation of the activities of the individual
behind the camera rather than merely describing the scene. To address this, we
introduce three distinct approaches: the single caption method, the collective
caption method, and the merged caption method, each designed to interpret the
life experiences of lifeloggers. Experimental results show that our method
effectively describes first-person visual images, enhancing the outcomes of
lifelog retrieval. Furthermore, we construct a textual dataset that converts
visual lifelogs into captions, thereby reconstructing personal life
experiences.

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbour (ANN) search is a fundamental problem in
information retrieval, underpinning large-scale applications in computer
vision, natural language processing, and cross-modal search. Hashing-based
methods provide an efficient solution by mapping high-dimensional data into
compact binary codes that enable fast similarity computations in Hamming space.
Over the past two decades, a substantial body of work has explored learning to
hash, where projection and quantisation functions are optimised from data
rather than chosen at random.
  This article offers a foundational survey of early learning-based hashing
methods, with an emphasis on the core ideas that shaped the field. We review
supervised, unsupervised, and semi-supervised approaches, highlighting how
projection functions are designed to generate meaningful embeddings and how
quantisation strategies convert these embeddings into binary codes. We also
examine extensions to multi-bit and multi-threshold models, as well as early
advances in cross-modal retrieval.
  Rather than providing an exhaustive account of the most recent methods, our
goal is to introduce the conceptual foundations of learning-based hashing for
ANN search. By situating these early models in their historical context, we aim
to equip readers with a structured understanding of the principles, trade-offs,
and open challenges that continue to inform current research in this area.

Motivation: 图像投影系统需要在保持大空间带宽积的同时，提高数据存储、计算和传输效率。传统方法在扩展景深和超分辨率方面存在功耗和计算复杂度问题。

Method: 使用CNN编码器将输入图像压缩为紧凑相位表示，通过低分辨率投影器显示，再由被动衍射光学解码器进行全光学图像重建，实现像素超分辨率和扩展景深。

Result: 系统在THz频谱验证，实现约267倍波长的扩展景深，每个横向平面提供约16倍空间带宽积提升，支持高保真图像合成。

Conclusion: 该混合投影架构显著降低显示系统的数据存储和传输需求，且光学解码器无需额外功耗，可扩展到光学计量和显微镜等应用。

Abstract: Image projection systems must be efficient in data storage, computation and
transmission while maintaining a large space-bandwidth-product (SBP) at their
output. Here, we introduce a hybrid image projection system that achieves
extended depth-of-field (DOF) with improved resolution, combining a
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based digital encoder with an all-optical
diffractive decoder. A CNN-based encoder compresses input images into compact
phase representations, which are subsequently displayed by a low-resolution
(LR) projector and processed by an analog diffractive decoder for all-optical
image reconstruction. This optical decoder is completely passive, designed to
synthesize pixel super-resolved image projections that feature an extended DOF
while eliminating the need for additional power consumption for super-resolved
image reconstruction. Our pixel super-resolution (PSR) image projection system
demonstrates high-fidelity image synthesis over an extended DOF of ~267xW,
where W is the illumination wavelength, concurrently offering up to ~16-fold
SBP improvement at each lateral plane. The proof of concept of this approach is
validated through an experiment conducted in the THz spectrum, and the system
is scalable across different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This image
projection architecture can reduce data storage and transmission requirements
for display systems without imposing additional power constraints on the
optical decoder. Beyond extended DOF PSR image projection, the underlying
principles of this approach can be extended to various applications, including
optical metrology and microscopy.

Abstract: In this paper, we formulate the problem of kinematic synthesis for planar
linkages as a cross-domain image generation task. We develop a planar linkages
dataset using RGB image representations, covering a range of mechanisms: from
simple types such as crank-rocker and crank-slider to more complex eight-bar
linkages like Jansen's mechanism. A shared-latent variational autoencoder (VAE)
is employed to explore the potential of image generative models for
synthesizing unseen motion curves and simulating novel kinematics. By encoding
the drawing speed of trajectory points as color gradients, the same
architecture also supports kinematic synthesis conditioned on both trajectory
shape and velocity profiles. We validate our method on three datasets of
increasing complexity: a standard four-bar linkage set, a mixed set of four-bar
and crank-slider mechanisms, and a complex set including multi-loop mechanisms.
Preliminary results demonstrate the effectiveness of image-based
representations for generative mechanical design, showing that mechanisms with
revolute and prismatic joints, and potentially cams and gears, can be
represented and synthesized within a unified image generation framework.

Conclusion: Beta核可作为辐射场渲染的可扩展通用基元，在保持实时渲染性能的同时，提供更好的表现力和可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce Universal Beta Splatting (UBS), a unified framework that
generalizes 3D Gaussian Splatting to N-dimensional anisotropic Beta kernels for
explicit radiance field rendering. Unlike fixed Gaussian primitives, Beta
kernels enable controllable dependency modeling across spatial, angular, and
temporal dimensions within a single representation. Our unified approach
captures complex light transport effects, handles anisotropic view-dependent
appearance, and models scene dynamics without requiring auxiliary networks or
specific color encodings. UBS maintains backward compatibility by approximating
to Gaussian Splatting as a special case, guaranteeing plug-in usability and
lower performance bounds. The learned Beta parameters naturally decompose scene
properties into interpretable without explicit supervision: spatial (surface
vs. texture), angular (diffuse vs. specular), and temporal (static vs.
dynamic). Our CUDA-accelerated implementation achieves real-time rendering
while consistently outperforming existing methods across static,
view-dependent, and dynamic benchmarks, establishing Beta kernels as a scalable
universal primitive for radiance field rendering. Our project website is

However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited
diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text
guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text
conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or
remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce
Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses
the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that
adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote
diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the
Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive
optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while
keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further
provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to
substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I
backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity
Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.

### [366] [Joint Neural SDF Reconstruction and Semantic Segmentation for CAD Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03837)
*Shen Fan,Przemyslaw Musialski*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出了一种数据效率高的方法，通过为基于神经SDF的CAD部件重建网络添加部件分割头，实现无需固定分类法的任意部件数量网格分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于固定分类法，无法处理任意部件数量的CAD网格。需要一种能够处理不同部件数量（包括过度分割形状）的通用分割方法。

Method: 在Flat-CAD SDF主干网络上附加轻量级分割头，使用PartField生成的监督进行训练，单次前向传播即可生成几何对齐的标签。

Result: 在ABC数据集上评估显示，重建指标（CDL1/CDL2, F1-micro, NC）和分割指标（mIoU, Accuracy）表现强劲，分割一致性指标显示标签平滑性良好。即使在薄壁或复杂几何的重建退化情况下，分割仍保持准确和标签一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法为语义结构化的CAD网格提供了一条实用路径，无需精心策划的分类法或精确调色板匹配。未来可改进边界精度和更高分辨率标签。

Abstract: We propose a simple, data-efficient pipeline that augments an implicit
reconstruction network based on neural SDF-based CAD parts with a
part-segmentation head trained under PartField-generated supervision. Unlike
methods tied to fixed taxonomies, our model accepts meshes with any number of
parts and produces coherent, geometry-aligned labels in a single pass. We
evaluate on randomly sampled CAD meshes from the ABC dataset with intentionally
varied part cardinalities, including over-segmented shapes, and report strong
performance across reconstruction (CDL1/CDL2, F1-micro, NC) and segmentation
(mIoU, Accuracy), together with a new Segmentation Consistency metric that
captures local label smoothness. We attach a lightweight segmentation head to
the Flat-CAD SDF trunk; on a paired evaluation it does not alter reconstruction
while providing accurate part labels for meshes with any number of parts. Even
under degraded reconstructions on thin or intricate geometries, segmentation
remains accurate and label-coherent, often preserving the correct part count.
Our approach therefore offers a practical route to semantically structured CAD
meshes without requiring curated taxonomies or exact palette matches. We
discuss limitations in boundary precision, partly due to per-face supervision,
and outline paths toward boundary-aware training and higher resolution labels.

Motivation: 解决传统3D-CG创作需要专业技能和复杂工具操作的问题，让普通用户也能通过自然语言轻松创建3D内容。

Method: 基于Dify平台构建，集成MCP协议、RAG技术，通过MCP自动化DCC工具操作，不支持MCP时使用CUA方法自动化GUI操作，支持用户反馈优化图像生成。

Result: 实现了通过自然语言指令生成3D-CG内容的能力，支持本地LLM部署以降低成本，提升了图像生成质量和用户交互体验。

Conclusion: 3Dify框架成功地将LLM技术应用于3D-CG生成领域，为普通用户提供了便捷的3D内容创作工具，具有实用价值和推广潜力。

Abstract: This paper proposes "3Dify," a procedural 3D computer graphics (3D-CG)
generation framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework
enables users to generate 3D-CG content solely through natural language
instructions. 3Dify is built upon Dify, an open-source platform for AI
application development, and incorporates several state-of-the-art LLM-related
technologies such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation
of various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not
support MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent
(CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover,
to enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by
selecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns
variable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent
generations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed
LLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time
and monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own
computational resources.

TL;DR: C3Editor是一个可控且一致的基于2D提升的3D编辑框架，通过选择性建立视图一致的2D编辑模型来解决现有方法的一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于2D提升的3D编辑方法存在不一致性问题，主要源于缺乏视图一致的2D编辑模型和难以确保多视图编辑一致性。

Method: 1) 控制选择GT视图及其编辑图像作为优化目标；2) 在GT视图和多个视图中微调2D编辑模型以对齐GT编辑图像；3) 引入独立的LoRA模块分别满足GT视图拟合和多视图一致性的需求。

Result: 该方法在定性和定量评估中均优于现有基于2D提升的方法，提供更一致和可控的2D和3D编辑结果。

Conclusion: C3Editor通过选择性建立视图一致的2D编辑模型和针对性微调策略，有效解决了3D编辑中的一致性问题，实现了更高质量的编辑效果。

Abstract: Existing 2D-lifting-based 3D editing methods often encounter challenges
related to inconsistency, stemming from the lack of view-consistent 2D editing
models and the difficulty of ensuring consistent editing across multiple views.
To address these issues, we propose C3Editor, a controllable and consistent
2D-lifting-based 3D editing framework. Given an original 3D representation and
a text-based editing prompt, our method selectively establishes a
view-consistent 2D editing model to achieve superior 3D editing results. The
process begins with the controlled selection of a ground truth (GT) view and
its corresponding edited image as the optimization target, allowing for
user-defined manual edits. Next, we fine-tune the 2D editing model within the
GT view and across multiple views to align with the GT-edited image while
ensuring multi-view consistency. To meet the distinct requirements of GT view
fitting and multi-view consistency, we introduce separate LoRA modules for
targeted fine-tuning. Our approach delivers more consistent and controllable 2D
and 3D editing results than existing 2D-lifting-based methods, outperforming
them in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: We present Social Agent, a novel framework for synthesizing realistic and
contextually appropriate co-speech nonverbal behaviors in dyadic conversations.
In this framework, we develop an agentic system driven by a Large Language
Model (LLM) to direct the conversation flow and determine appropriate
interactive behaviors for both participants. Additionally, we propose a novel
dual-person gesture generation model based on an auto-regressive diffusion
model, which synthesizes coordinated motions from speech signals. The output of
the agentic system is translated into high-level guidance for the gesture
generator, resulting in realistic movement at both the behavioral and motion
levels. Furthermore, the agentic system periodically examines the movements of
interlocutors and infers their intentions, forming a continuous feedback loop
that enables dynamic and responsive interactions between the two participants.
User studies and quantitative evaluations show that our model significantly
improves the quality of dyadic interactions, producing natural, synchronized
nonverbal behaviors.

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation technology holds potential to transform
multiple domains such as education, marketing, entertainment, and assistive
technologies for individuals with visual or reading comprehension challenges,
by creating coherent visual content from natural language prompts. From its
inception, the field has advanced from adversarial models to diffusion-based
models, yielding higher-fidelity, temporally consistent outputs. Yet challenges
persist, such as alignment, long-range coherence, and computational efficiency.
Addressing this evolving landscape, we present a comprehensive survey of
text-to-video generative models, tracing their development from early GANs and
VAEs to hybrid Diffusion-Transformer (DiT) architectures, detailing how these
models work, what limitations they addressed in their predecessors, and why
shifts toward new architectural paradigms were necessary to overcome challenges
in quality, coherence, and control. We provide a systematic account of the
datasets, which the surveyed text-to-video models were trained and evaluated
on, and, to support reproducibility and assess the accessibility of training
such models, we detail their training configurations, including their hardware
specifications, GPU counts, batch sizes, learning rates, optimizers, epochs,
and other key hyperparameters. Further, we outline the evaluation metrics
commonly used for evaluating such models and present their performance across
standard benchmarks, while also discussing the limitations of these metrics and
the emerging shift toward more holistic, perception-aligned evaluation
strategies. Finally, drawing from our analysis, we outline the current open
challenges and propose a few promising future directions, laying out a
perspective for future researchers to explore and build upon in advancing T2V
research and applications.

Motivation: 现有基于文本提示的图像编辑方法缺乏足够的控制能力，特别是需要解耦控制（改变一个属性不影响其他属性）和连续控制（可平滑调整编辑强度）。

Method: 通过稀疏自编码器在文本嵌入空间中识别语义隔离的编辑方向，然后沿这些方向操作文本嵌入来实现解耦和连续的属性编辑。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够在多种属性和领域中实现直观高效的连续控制编辑。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种模型无关的图像编辑解决方案，通过文本嵌入操作实现解耦和连续控制，适用于各种图像合成框架。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have become the backbone of modern
image editing, yet text prompts alone do not offer adequate control over the
editing process. Two properties are especially desirable: disentanglement,
where changing one attribute does not unintentionally alter others, and
continuous control, where the strength of an edit can be smoothly adjusted. We
introduce a method for disentangled and continuous editing through token-level
manipulation of text embeddings. The edits are applied by manipulating the
embeddings along carefully chosen directions, which control the strength of the
target attribute. To identify such directions, we employ a Sparse Autoencoder
(SAE), whose sparse latent space exposes semantically isolated dimensions. Our
method operates directly on text embeddings without modifying the diffusion
process, making it model agnostic and broadly applicable to various image
synthesis backbones. Experiments show that it enables intuitive and efficient
manipulations with continuous control across diverse attributes and domains.

Abstract: Treating human motion and camera trajectory generation separately overlooks a
core principle of cinematography: the tight interplay between actor performance
and camera work in the screen space. In this paper, we are the first to cast
this task as a text-conditioned joint generation, aiming to maintain consistent
on-screen framing while producing two heterogeneous, yet intrinsically linked,
modalities: human motion and camera trajectories. We propose a simple,
model-agnostic framework that enforces multimodal coherence via an auxiliary
modality: the on-screen framing induced by projecting human joints onto the
camera. This on-screen framing provides a natural and effective bridge between
modalities, promoting consistency and leading to more precise joint
distribution. We first design a joint autoencoder that learns a shared latent
space, together with a lightweight linear transform from the human and camera
latents to a framing latent. We then introduce auxiliary sampling, which
exploits this linear transform to steer generation toward a coherent framing
modality. To support this task, we also introduce the PulpMotion dataset, a
human-motion and camera-trajectory dataset with rich captions, and high-quality
human motions. Extensive experiments across DiT- and MAR-based architectures
show the generality and effectiveness of our method in generating on-frame
coherent human-camera motions, while also achieving gains on textual alignment
for both modalities. Our qualitative results yield more cinematographically
meaningful framings setting the new state of the art for this task. Code,

TL;DR: 开发并评估了一种用于脑磁共振弹性成像非线性反演的算子学习框架，能够在保持空间精度的同时实现实时弹性图反演。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统非线性反演方法计算成本高、无法实时应用的问题，同时保持其空间精度优势。

Method: 使用61名个体的3D MRE数据，通过10折交叉验证训练预测性深度算子学习框架，输入为测量位移场的复旋度，输出为NLI参考弹性图，并加入结构先验机制提高空间精度。

Result: oNLI在全脑绝对百分比误差上显著优于CNN（μ'：8.4±0.5 vs 15.8±0.8；μ''：10.0±0.7 vs 26.1±1.1），在所有脑区Pearson相关系数均优于CNN（p<0.05）。

Conclusion: oNLI框架实现了实时MRE反演（30,000倍加速），优于CNN方法，并保持了NLI在脑部可实现的精细空间精度。

Abstract: $\textbf{Purpose:}$ To develop and evaluate an operator learning framework
for nonlinear inversion (NLI) of brain magnetic resonance elastography (MRE)
data, which enables real-time inversion of elastograms with comparable spatial
accuracy to NLI.
  $\textbf{Materials and Methods:}$ In this retrospective study, 3D MRE data
from 61 individuals (mean age, 37.4 years; 34 female) were used for development
of the framework. A predictive deep operator learning framework (oNLI) was
trained using 10-fold cross-validation, with the complex curl of the measured
displacement field as inputs and NLI-derived reference elastograms as outputs.
A structural prior mechanism, analogous to Soft Prior Regularization in the MRE
literature, was incorporated to improve spatial accuracy. Subject-level
evaluation metrics included Pearson's correlation coefficient, absolute
relative error, and structural similarity index measure between predicted and
reference elastograms across brain regions of different sizes to understand
accuracy. Statistical analyses included paired t-tests comparing the proposed
oNLI variants to the convolutional neural network baselines.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ Whole brain absolute percent error was 8.4 $\pm$ 0.5
($\mu'$) and 10.0 $\pm$ 0.7 ($\mu''$) for oNLI and 15.8 $\pm$ 0.8 ($\mu'$) and
26.1 $\pm$ 1.1 ($\mu''$) for CNNs. Additionally, oNLI outperformed
convolutional architectures as per Pearson's correlation coefficient, $r$, in
the whole brain and across all subregions for both the storage modulus and loss
modulus (p < 0.05).
  $\textbf{Conclusion:}$ The oNLI framework enables real-time MRE inversion
(30,000x speedup), outperforming CNN-based approaches and maintaining the
fine-grained spatial accuracy achievable with NLI in the brain.

Conclusion: 先进的数据增强和模型集成组合可以改善在多样化和代表性不足数据集上的分割准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Brain tumors, particularly gliomas, pose significant chall-enges due to their
complex growth patterns, infiltrative nature, and the variability in brain
structure across individuals, which makes accurate diagnosis and monitoring
difficult. Deep learning models have been developed to accurately delineate
these tumors. However, most of these models were trained on relatively
homogenous high-resource datasets, limiting their robustness when deployed in
underserved regions. In this study, we performed segmentation-aware offline
data augmentation on the BraTS-Africa dataset to increase the data sample size
and diversity to enhance generalization. We further constructed an ensemble of
three distinct architectures, MedNeXt, SegMamba, and Residual-Encoder U-Net, to
leverage their complementary strengths. Our best-performing model, MedNeXt, was
trained on 1000 epochs and achieved the highest average lesion-wise dice and
normalized surface distance scores of 0.86 and 0.81 respectively. However, the
ensemble model trained for 500 epochs produced the most balanced segmentation
performance across the tumour subregions. This work demonstrates that a
combination of advanced augmentation and model ensembling can improve
segmentation accuracy and robustness on diverse and underrepresented datasets.

Conclusion: EvEnhancer系列方法通过有效利用事件流特性，实现了鲁棒且可泛化的连续时空视频超分辨率，为任意时空尺度的视频重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Continuous space-time video super-resolution (C-STVSR) has garnered
increasing interest for its capability to reconstruct high-resolution and
high-frame-rate videos at arbitrary spatial and temporal scales. However,
prevailing methods often generalize poorly, producing unsatisfactory results
when applied to out-of-distribution (OOD) scales. To overcome this limitation,
we present EvEnhancer, a novel approach that marries the unique properties of
high temporal resolution and high dynamic range encapsulated in event streams
to achieve robust and generalizable C-STVSR. Our approach incorporates
event-adapted synthesis that capitalizes on the spatiotemporal correlations
between frames and events to capture long-term motion trajectories, enabling
adaptive interpolation and fusion across space and time. This is then coupled
with a local implicit video transformer that integrates local implicit video
neural function with cross-scale spatiotemporal attention to learn continuous
video representations and generate plausible videos at arbitrary resolutions
and frame rates. We further develop EvEnhancerPlus, which builds a controllable
switching mechanism that dynamically determines the reconstruction difficulty
for each spatiotemporal pixel based on local event statistics. This allows the
model to adaptively route reconstruction along the most suitable pathways at a
fine-grained pixel level, substantially reducing computational overhead while
maintaining excellent performance. Furthermore, we devise a cross-derivative
training strategy that stabilizes the convergence of such a multi-pathway
framework through staged cross-optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and
real-world datasets, while maintaining superior generalizability at OOD scales.

Motivation: 胸腔积液是常见临床发现，但从CT扫描中准确测量其体积具有挑战性。需要改进PE分割和量化方法以支持更好的临床管理。

Method: 使用CT肺动脉造影数据，开发了教师-助教-学生(TTAS)半监督深度学习框架，在100个手动标注病例上进行训练，并在未分割检查中实现高效训练。

Result: TTAS模型在分割性能上显著优于现有模型，平均Dice得分0.82 vs 0.73(p<0.0001)，平均绝对体积差异仅为6.49mL，比nnU-Net的23.16mL低四倍。

Conclusion: TTAS框架提供了优越的PE分割能力，有助于从CT扫描中准确确定胸腔积液体积。

Abstract: Background: Pleural Effusions (PE) is a common finding in many different
clinical conditions, but accurately measuring their volume from CT scans is
challenging. Purpose: To improve PE segmentation and quantification for
enhanced clinical management, we have developed and trained a semi-supervised
deep learning framework on contrast-enhanced CT volumes. Materials and Methods:
This retrospective study collected CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA) data from
internal and external datasets. A subset of 100 cases was manually annotated
for model training, while the remaining cases were used for testing and
validation. A novel semi-supervised deep learning framework, Teacher-Teaching

in non-segmented examinations. Segmentation performance was compared to that of
state-of-the-art models. Results: 100 patients (mean age, 72 years, 28

demonstrated superior segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art
models, achieving a mean Dice score of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.79 - 0.84) versus 0.73
for nnU-Net (p < 0.0001, Student's T test). Additionally, TTAS exhibited a
four-fold lower mean Absolute Volume Difference (AbVD) of 6.49 mL (95% CI, 4.80

TL;DR: 本文提出了3D滑动窗口注意力机制，这是一种无需分块的局部注意力方法，用于视频压缩中的transformer模型。该方法通过统一的解码器架构和均匀感受野，显著提升了率失真性能，同时大幅降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频压缩中基于分块的局部注意力机制存在感受野不规则和计算冗余的问题，特别是在时间自回归模型中需要重叠窗口，这限制了transformer在视频压缩中的效率和性能。

Method: 提出3D滑动窗口注意力机制，采用无需分块的局部注意力形式，构建统一的解码器架构来处理空间和时间上下文，提供均匀的感受野。

Result: 相比VCT基线，实现了高达18.6%的Bjøntegaard Delta-rate节省，解码器复杂度降低了2.8倍，熵模型效率提升了近3.5倍。

Conclusion: 3D滑动窗口注意力机制有效解决了传统分块方法的缺陷，在提升压缩性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，但需要注意过长的时间上下文可能对性能产生负面影响。

Abstract: To manage the complexity of transformers in video compression, local
attention mechanisms are a practical necessity. The common approach of
partitioning frames into patches, however, creates architectural flaws like
irregular receptive fields. When adapted for temporal autoregressive models,
this paradigm, exemplified by the Video Compression Transformer (VCT), also
necessitates computationally redundant overlapping windows. This work
introduces 3D Sliding Window Attention (SWA), a patchless form of local
attention. By enabling a decoder-only architecture that unifies spatial and
temporal context processing, and by providing a uniform receptive field, our
method significantly improves rate-distortion performance, achieving
Bj{\o}rntegaard Delta-rate savings of up to 18.6 % against the VCT baseline.
Simultaneously, by eliminating the need for overlapping windows, our method
reduces overall decoder complexity by a factor of 2.8, while its entropy model
is nearly 3.5 times more efficient. We further analyze our model's behavior and
show that while it benefits from long-range temporal context, excessive context

Abstract: Limited-angle computerized tomography stands for one of the most difficult
challenges in imaging. Although it opens the way to faster data acquisition in
industry and less dangerous scans in medicine, standard approaches, such as the
filtered backprojection (FBP) algorithm or the widely used total-variation
functional, often produce various artefacts that hinder the diagnosis. With the
rise of deep learning, many modern techniques have proven themselves successful
in removing such artefacts but at the cost of large datasets. In this paper, we
propose a new model-driven approach based on the method of the approximate
inverse, which could serve as new starting point for learning strategies in the
future. In contrast to FBP-type approaches, our reconstruction step consists in
evaluating linear functionals on the measured data using reconstruction kernels
that are precomputed as solution of an auxiliary problem. With this problem
being uniquely solvable, the derived limited-angle reconstruction kernel (LARK)
is able to fully reconstruct the object without the well-known streak
artefacts, even for large limited angles. However, it inherits severe
ill-conditioning which leads to a different kind of artefacts arising from the
singular functions of the limited-angle Radon transform. The problem becomes
particularly challenging when working on semi-discrete (real or analytical)
measurements. We develop a general regularization strategy, named constrained
limited-angle reconstruction kernel (CLARK), by combining spectral filter, the
method of the approximate inverse and custom edge-preserving denoising in order
to stabilize the whole process. We further derive and interpret error estimates
for the application on real, i.e. semi-discrete, data and we validate our
approach on synthetic and real data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典Rudin-Osher-Fatemi模型存在阶梯效应问题，需要改进模型在保持边缘的同时减少这种人工伪影。

Abstract: We propose a new image denoising model based on a variable-growth total
variation regularization of double-phase type with adaptive weight. It is
designed to reduce staircasing with respect to the classical
Rudin--Osher--Fatemi model, while preserving the edges of the image in a
similar fashion. We implement the model and test its performance on synthetic
and natural images in 1D and 2D over a range of noise levels.

Abstract: Pollinators are critical to the world's ecosystems and food supply, yet
recent studies have found pollination shortfalls in several crops, including
strawberry. This is troubling because wild and managed pollinators are
currently experiencing declines. One possibility is to try and provide
supplemental pollination solutions. These solutions should be affordable and
simple for farmers to implement if their use is to be widespread; quadcopters
are a great example, already used for monitoring on many farms. This paper
investigates a new method for artificial pollination based on wind pollination
that bears further investigation. After determining the height where the
lateral flow is maximized, we performed field experiments with a quadcopter
assisting natural pollinators. Although our results in the field were
inconclusive, lab studies show that the idea shows promise and could be adapted
for better field results.

TL;DR: 该论文通过国际天文学与天体物理学奥林匹克竞赛(IOAA)系统评估了5个最先进的LLM在天文学领域的表现，发现GPT-5和Gemini 2.5 Pro在理论考试中达到金牌水平，但在数据分析考试中表现分化，且所有模型在概念推理、几何推理和空间可视化方面存在明显弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注简单的问答任务，无法全面评估LLM在天文学研究所需的复杂推理能力，需要更系统的基准来理解LLM在天文学领域的优势和局限。

Method: 使用国际天文学与天体物理学奥林匹克竞赛(IOAA)2016-2025年的考试题目，系统评估5个最先进LLM在理论考试和数据分析考试中的表现，并进行深入的错误分析。

Result: GPT-5和Gemini 2.5 Pro在理论考试中平均得分分别为85.6%和84.2%，达到金牌水平，在200-300名参赛者中排名前二；但在数据分析考试中，其他模型表现下降至48-76%。所有模型在概念推理、几何推理和空间可视化方面的准确率仅为52-79%。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM在理论考试中接近人类顶尖水平，但在概念推理、几何推理和空间可视化方面的关键差距仍需解决，才能作为天文学研究的自主研究代理。

Abstract: While task-specific demonstrations show early success in applying large
language models (LLMs) to automate some astronomical research tasks, they only
provide incomplete views of all necessary capabilities in solving astronomy
problems, calling for more thorough understanding of LLMs' strengths and
limitations. So far, existing benchmarks and evaluations focus on simple
question-answering that primarily tests astronomical knowledge and fails to
evaluate the complex reasoning required for real-world research in the
discipline. Here, we address this gap by systematically benchmarking five
state-of-the-art LLMs on the International Olympiad on Astronomy and
Astrophysics (IOAA) exams, which are designed to examine deep conceptual
understanding, multi-step derivations, and multimodal analysis. With average
scores of 85.6% and 84.2%, Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 (the two top-performing
models) not only achieve gold medal level performance but also rank in the top
two among ~200-300 participants in all four IOAA theory exams evaluated
(2022-2025). In comparison, results on the data analysis exams show more
divergence. GPT-5 still excels in the exams with an 88.5% average score,
ranking top 10 among the participants in the four most recent IOAAs, while
other models' performances drop to 48-76%. Furthermore, our in-depth error
analysis underscores conceptual reasoning, geometric reasoning, and spatial
visualization (52-79% accuracy) as consistent weaknesses among all LLMs. Hence,
although LLMs approach peak human performance in theory exams, critical gaps
must be addressed before they can serve as autonomous research agents in
astronomy.

TL;DR: 研究大语言模型能否基于编程语言的正式语义来执行程序，探讨LLM作为编程语言解释器的潜力，发现模型在标准语义下表现良好但在非标准语义下性能下降，表明缺乏稳健的语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM是否能够仅基于编程语言的正式语义来执行程序，如果可行，将能够快速原型化新的编程语言和语言特性。

Method: 使用IMP语言（C的子集），通过小步操作语义和基于重写的操作语义进行形式化。引入三个评估集（人工编写、LLM翻译、模糊生成），控制代码复杂度。评估模型在三个任务上的表现：最终状态预测、语义规则预测和执行轨迹预测。定义两种非标准语义来区分预训练记忆和语义能力。

Result: 在标准语义下表现良好，但在非标准语义下性能显著下降。发现：(i) 不同模型失败有模式；(ii) 大多数推理模型在粗粒度任务上表现优异，能处理嵌套循环深度超过五的复杂程序；(iii) 提供形式语义对简单程序有帮助，但对复杂程序往往有害。

Conclusion: 结果表明LLM有潜力作为编程语言解释器，但缺乏稳健的语义理解能力。发布了基准测试和支持代码。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) excel at code reasoning, a natural question
arises: can an LLM execute programs (i.e., act as an interpreter) purely based
on a programming language's formal semantics? If so, it will enable rapid
prototyping of new programming languages and language features. We study this
question using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via
small-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational
semantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written,
LLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by
code-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes.
Given a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are
evaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state
prediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction.
To distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two
nonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard
rules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard
semantics despite high performance under the standard one. We further find that
(i) there are patterns to different model failures, (ii) most reasoning models
perform exceptionally well on coarse grained tasks involving reasoning about
highly complex programs often containing nested loop depths beyond five, and
surprisingly, (iii) providing formal semantics helps on simple programs but
often hurts on more complex ones. Overall, the results show a promise that LLMs
could serve as programming language interpreters, but points to the lack of
their robust semantics understanding. We release the benchmark and the
supporting code at https://github.com/EngineeringSoftware/PLSemanticsBench.
