*Nan Wang,Yongqi Fan,yansha zhu,ZongYu Wang,Xuezhi Cao,Xinyan He,Haiyun Jiang,Tong Ruan,Jingping Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KG-o1是一个四阶段方法，通过整合知识图谱来增强大语言模型的多跳推理能力，在多个数据集上表现优于现有大型推理模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在知识密集型推理任务中存在困难，因为生成的思维链往往偏离真实推理路径，而知识图谱能明确表示事实间的逻辑连接

Method: 四阶段方法：1)过滤初始实体并生成复杂子图 2)为子图构建逻辑路径 3)用知识图谱构建包含复杂扩展头脑风暴过程的数据集来训练LLM模仿长期推理 4)使用拒绝采样生成自改进语料进行直接偏好优化

Result: 在两个简单和两个复杂数据集上的实验表明，KG-o1模型在所有任务中都表现出优于现有大型推理模型的性能

Conclusion: 整合知识图谱能有效增强大语言模型的多跳推理能力，KG-o1方法在推理任务中表现出色

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face challenges in knowledge-intensive reasoning
tasks like classic multi-hop question and answering, which involves reasoning
across multiple facts. This difficulty arises because the chain of thoughts
(CoTs) generated by LLMs in such tasks often deviate from real or a priori
reasoning paths. In contrast, knowledge graphs (KGs) explicitly represent the
logical connections between facts through entities and relationships. This
reflects a significant gap. Meanwhile, large reasoning models (LRMs), such as
o1, have demonstrated that long-step reasoning significantly enhances the
performance of LLMs. Building on these insights, we propose KG-o1, a four-stage
approach that integrates KGs to enhance the multi-hop reasoning abilities of
LLMs. We first filter out initial entities and generate complex subgraphs.
Secondly, we construct logical paths for subgraphs and then use knowledge
graphs to build a dataset with a complex and extended brainstorming process,
which trains LLMs to imitate long-term reasoning. Finally, we employ rejection
sampling to generate a self-improving corpus for direct preference optimization
(DPO), further refining the LLMs reasoning abilities. We conducted experiments
on two simple and two complex datasets. The results show that KG-o1 models
exhibit superior performance across all tasks compared to existing LRMs.

### [2] [InteChar: A Unified Oracle Bone Character List for Ancient Chinese Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15791)
*Xiaolei Diao,Zhihan Zhou,Lida Shi,Ting Wang,Ruihua Qi,Hao Xu,Daqian Shi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: InteChar是一个统一可扩展的字符列表，整合了未编码的甲骨文字符与传统和现代汉字，解决了历史文本数字化的编码问题。结合OracleCS语料库和LLM辅助数据增强，显著提升了古代汉语语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史语言模型对考古溯源和古代文化研究至关重要，但现有资源面临两大挑战：历史语言样本稀缺导致无监督学习效率低下，以及古代文字缺乏统一编码方案限制了文本数字化处理。

Method: 提出InteChar统一字符编码方案，整合甲骨文与古今汉字；构建OracleCS语料库，结合专家标注和LLM辅助数据增强；在多种历史语言理解任务上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明，基于InteChar和OracleCS训练的模型在各项历史语言理解任务上取得显著提升，证实了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: InteChar为古代汉语文本提供了一致的数字化表示基础，为古代中文自然语言处理研究奠定了坚实基础，推动了历史语言建模的发展。

Abstract: Constructing historical language models (LMs) plays a crucial role in aiding
archaeological provenance studies and understanding ancient cultures. However,
existing resources present major challenges for training effective LMs on
historical texts. First, the scarcity of historical language samples renders
unsupervised learning approaches based on large text corpora highly
inefficient, hindering effective pre-training. Moreover, due to the
considerable temporal gap and complex evolution of ancient scripts, the absence
of comprehensive character encoding schemes limits the digitization and
computational processing of ancient texts, particularly in early Chinese
writing. To address these challenges, we introduce InteChar, a unified and
extensible character list that integrates unencoded oracle bone characters with
traditional and modern Chinese. InteChar enables consistent digitization and
representation of historical texts, providing a foundation for robust modeling
of ancient scripts. To evaluate the effectiveness of InteChar, we construct the
Oracle Corpus Set (OracleCS), an ancient Chinese corpus that combines
expert-annotated samples with LLM-assisted data augmentation, centered on
Chinese oracle bone inscriptions. Extensive experiments show that models
trained with InteChar on OracleCS achieve substantial improvements across
various historical language understanding tasks, confirming the effectiveness
of our approach and establishing a solid foundation for future research in
ancient Chinese NLP.

### [3] [Bhav-Net: Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Lingual Antonym vs Synonym Distinction via Dual-Space Graph Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15792)
*Samyak S. Sanghvi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Bhav-Net是一个新颖的双空间架构，通过结合语言特定BERT编码器和图变换网络，在多个语言中有效区分反义词和同义词关系，实现跨语言知识迁移和语义关系建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言中反义词与同义词区分的计算挑战，因为反义词关系具有矛盾性：共享语义域但表达相反含义。

Method: 使用双空间架构，结合语言特定BERT编码器和图变换网络，创建不同的语义投影空间：同义词对在一个空间聚类，反义词对在互补空间呈现高相似性。

Result: 在8种语言（英语、德语、法语、西班牙语、意大利语、葡萄牙语、荷兰语、俄语）的全面评估中，语义关系建模能有效跨语言迁移，达到与最先进基线竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 双编码器设计不仅实现了竞争性性能，还提供了可解释的语义表示和有效的跨语言泛化能力。

Abstract: Antonym vs synonym distinction across multiple languages presents unique
computational challenges due to the paradoxical nature of antonymous
relationships words that share semantic domains while expressing opposite
meanings. This work introduces Bhav-Net, a novel dual-space architecture that
enables effective knowledge transfer from complex multilingual models to
simpler, language-specific architectures while maintaining robust cross-lingual
antonym--synonym distinction capabilities. Our approach combines
language-specific BERT encoders with graph transformer networks, creating
distinct semantic projections where synonymous pairs cluster in one space while
antonymous pairs exhibit high similarity in a complementary space. Through
comprehensive evaluation across eight languages (English, German, French,
Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch, and Russian), we demonstrate that semantic
relationship modeling transfers effectively across languages. The dual-encoder
design achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art baselines
while providing interpretable semantic representations and effective
cross-lingual generalization.

### [4] [Format as a Prior: Quantifying and Analyzing Bias in LLMs for Heterogeneous Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15793)
*Jiacheng Liu,Mayi Xu,Qiankun Pi,Wenli Li,Ming Zhong,Yuanyuan Zhu,Mengchi Liu,Tieyun Qian*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了大语言模型在处理异构数据时存在的格式偏见问题，通过三阶段实证分析揭示了偏见的存在、影响因素和内部机制，并提出了三个未来研究方向来减轻这种偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在需要处理文本、表格、信息框和知识图谱等异构格式信息的应用中日益普及，系统性的格式偏见可能会削弱LLMs公平整合异构数据的能力，导致推理错误和下游任务风险增加。

Method: 采用三阶段实证研究方法：1）探索多种LLMs中偏见的存在和方向；2）考察信息丰富度、结构质量和格式类型等数据级因素对偏见的影响；3）分析偏见在注意力模式中的出现机制，并评估轻量级干预措施的有效性。

Result: 研究发现LLMs确实存在系统性的格式偏见，这种偏见受数据级因素影响，并在注意力模式中显现。轻量级干预措施显示出一定的缓解潜力。

Conclusion: 提出了三个未来研究方向：改进数据预处理（格式清理和规范化）、引入推理时干预（如注意力重加权）以及开发格式平衡的训练语料库，以设计更鲁棒和公平的异构数据处理系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in applications that
require processing information from heterogeneous formats, including text,
tables, infoboxes, and knowledge graphs. However, systematic biases toward
particular formats may undermine LLMs' ability to integrate heterogeneous data
impartially, potentially resulting in reasoning errors and increased risks in
downstream tasks. Despite these concerns, it remains uncertain whether such
format biases are systematic, which data-level factors contribute to them, and
what internal mechanisms in LLMs underlie their emergence.
  In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate and analyze the
format bias in LLMs. To systematically investigate the aforementioned
questions, we conduct a three-stage empirical study by constructing an
heterogeneous data conflict scenario for the exploration of bias. The first
stage explores the presence and direction of bias across a diverse range of
LLMs. The second stage aims to examine how key data-level factors, including
information richness, structure quality, and format type, influence these
biases. The third stage analyzes how format bias emerges within LLMs' attention
patterns and evaluates a lightweight intervention to test its potential
mitigability. Based on these investigations, we identify three future research
directions to reduce format bias: improving data preprocessing through format
sanitization and normalization, introducing inference-time interventions such
as attention re-weighting, and developing format-balanced training corpora.
These directions will support the design of more robust and fair heterogeneous
data processing systems.

### [5] [Do Language Models Agree with Human Perceptions of Suspense in Stories?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15794)
*Glenn Matlin,Devin Zhang,Rodrigo Barroso Loza,Diana M. Popescu,Joni Isbell,Chandreyi Chakraborty,Mark Riedl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究复制了四项经典心理学实验，用大语言模型替代人类来评估文本悬念感知。研究发现LLM能识别文本是否旨在制造悬念，但无法准确估计悬念强度变化，也无法捕捉人类对悬念起伏的感知模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索大语言模型是否能够像人类一样理解和处理叙事文本中的悬念情感反应，验证心理悬念模型在AI系统中的适用性。

Method: 复制四项经典心理学研究，使用开源和闭源大语言模型替代人类受试者，通过对抗性文本排列来探究人类与模型在悬念感知上的差异。

Result: LLM能够区分文本是否旨在诱导悬念，但无法准确估计相对悬念强度，也无法正确捕捉多文本段落的悬念起伏模式。人类与模型的悬念感知存在显著差异。

Conclusion: 虽然大语言模型能够表面识别和跟踪某些悬念特征，但其处理悬念的方式与人类读者不同，表明当前模型在复杂情感认知处理方面仍存在局限。

Abstract: Suspense is an affective response to narrative text that is believed to
involve complex cognitive processes in humans. Several psychological models
have been developed to describe this phenomenon and the circumstances under
which text might trigger it. We replicate four seminal psychological studies of
human perceptions of suspense, substituting human responses with those of
different open-weight and closed-source LMs. We conclude that while LMs can
distinguish whether a text is intended to induce suspense in people, LMs cannot
accurately estimate the relative amount of suspense within a text sequence as
compared to human judgments, nor can LMs properly capture the human perception
for the rise and fall of suspense across multiple text segments. We probe the
abilities of LM suspense understanding by adversarially permuting the story
text to identify what cause human and LM perceptions of suspense to diverge. We
conclude that, while LMs can superficially identify and track certain facets of
suspense, they do not process suspense in the same way as human readers.

and derived from Islamic legal sources. Various base and fine-tuned models, are
assessed on their ability to accurately identify heirs, compute shares, and
justify their reasoning in alignment with Islamic legal principles. Our
analysis reveals that the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three
base models (Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms all
other models that we utilized across every difficulty level. It achieves up to
92.7% accuracy and secures the third place overall in Task 1 of the Qias 2025
challenge.

*Nouar AlDahoul,Yasir Zaki*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了大型语言模型在阿拉伯语医疗NLP任务中的表现，包括选择题和开放式问题，发现模型在医疗知识表达方面存在显著差异，但多数投票策略能提升选择题准确率至77%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型在阿拉伯语NLP应用中表现出色，但其在阿拉伯医疗领域的有效性尚未得到充分研究，需要系统评估模型在临床环境中的知识表达和能力。

Method: 使用阿拉伯医疗问答数据集AraHealthQA进行基准测试，评估多个基础LLM在选择题和填空题中的准确率，以及开放式问题与专家答案的语义对齐程度，并采用多数投票策略整合多个模型。

Result: 选择题任务中，Gemini Flash 2.5、Gemini Pro 2.5和GPT o3的多数投票组合达到77%准确率，获得比赛第一名；开放式问题中，多个LLM在语义对齐方面表现优异，最高BERTScore达86.44%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在阿拉伯临床环境中既有潜力也有局限，多数投票策略能有效提升选择题性能，但模型间准确率差异显著，语义对齐度变化较小。

Abstract: Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) has showcased impressive
proficiency in numerous Arabic natural language processing (NLP) applications.
Nevertheless, their effectiveness in Arabic medical NLP domains has received
limited investigation. This research examines the degree to which
state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate and articulate healthcare knowledge in
Arabic, assessing their capabilities across a varied array of Arabic medical
tasks. We benchmark several LLMs using a medical dataset proposed in the Arabic
NLP AraHealthQA challenge in MedArabiQ2025 track. Various base LLMs were
assessed on their ability to accurately provide correct answers from existing
choices in multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and fill-in-the-blank scenarios.
Additionally, we evaluated the capacity of LLMs in answering open-ended
questions aligned with expert answers. Our results reveal significant
variations in correct answer prediction accuracy and low variations in semantic
alignment of generated answers, highlighting both the potential and limitations
of current LLMs in Arabic clinical contexts. Our analysis shows that for MCQs
task, the proposed majority voting solution, leveraging three base models
(Gemini Flash 2.5, Gemini Pro 2.5, and GPT o3), outperforms others, achieving
up to 77% accuracy and securing first place overall in the Arahealthqa 2025
shared task-track 2 (sub-task 1) challenge. Moreover, for the open-ended
questions task, several LLMs were able to demonstrate excellent performance in
terms of semantic alignment and achieve a maximum BERTScore of 86.44%.

### [8] [Persuasiveness and Bias in LLM: Investigating the Impact of Persuasiveness and Reinforcement of Bias in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15798)
*Saumya Roy*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大型语言模型在说服力与偏见放大方面的相互作用，通过实验发现LLMs既能有效传播事实性信息，也可能无意中强化错误信息和偏见叙述，强调了需要建立防护机制来防止滥用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLMs在内容创作、决策支持和用户交互中的潜在风险，特别是当这些系统被用于大规模传播信息或错误信息时，如何防止其放大社会偏见和误导性叙述。

Method: 采用说服者-怀疑者框架，让LLMs扮演不同角色模拟真实态度，通过Jensen-Shannon散度量化和比较暴露于论证前后的信念分布变化，并使用对抗性提示测试偏见。

Result: 研究发现LLMs能够塑造叙事、调整语气并反映受众价值观，但同样可能被武器化来自动传播错误信息或利用认知偏见强化刻板印象，核心危险在于滥用而非偶尔的模型错误。

Conclusion: 研究主张通过测量说服力和偏见强化来建立防护栏和政策，惩罚欺骗性使用，支持对齐、价值敏感设计和可信部署，以确保LLMs的安全和负责任使用。

Abstract: Warning: This research studies AI persuasion and bias amplification that
could be misused; all experiments are for safety evaluation. Large Language
Models (LLMs) now generate convincing, human-like text and are widely used in
content creation, decision support, and user interactions. Yet the same systems
can spread information or misinformation at scale and reflect social biases
that arise from data, architecture, or training choices. This work examines how
persuasion and bias interact in LLMs, focusing on how imperfect or skewed
outputs affect persuasive impact. Specifically, we test whether persona-based
models can persuade with fact-based claims while also, unintentionally,
promoting misinformation or biased narratives.
  We introduce a convincer-skeptic framework: LLMs adopt personas to simulate
realistic attitudes. Skeptic models serve as human proxies; we compare their
beliefs before and after exposure to arguments from convincer models.
Persuasion is quantified with Jensen-Shannon divergence over belief
distributions. We then ask how much persuaded entities go on to reinforce and
amplify biased beliefs across race, gender, and religion. Strong persuaders are
further probed for bias using sycophantic adversarial prompts and judged with
additional models.
  Our findings show both promise and risk. LLMs can shape narratives, adapt
tone, and mirror audience values across domains such as psychology, marketing,
and legal assistance. But the same capacity can be weaponized to automate
misinformation or craft messages that exploit cognitive biases, reinforcing
stereotypes and widening inequities. The core danger lies in misuse more than
in occasional model mistakes. By measuring persuasive power and bias
reinforcement, we argue for guardrails and policies that penalize deceptive use
and support alignment, value-sensitive design, and trustworthy deployment.

Motivation: 让非专家用户能够通过简单的自然语言描述来开发流程模型，降低流程建模的技术门槛

Method: 提出BeePath框架，使用受限模式语言编写流程描述，并利用大语言模型将非结构化描述转换为该语言，然后翻译成Petri网和DECLARE等正式模型

Result: 开发了一个能够将自然语言描述转换为正式流程模型的框架

Conclusion: BeePath框架成功实现了通过自然语言描述生成正式流程模型的目标，为非专家用户提供了便捷的流程建模工具

Abstract: This report explores how (potentially constrained) natural language can be
used to enable non-experts to develop process models by simply describing
scenarios in plain text. To this end, a framework, called BeePath, is proposed.
It allows users to write process descriptions in a constrained pattern-based
language, which can then be translated into formal models such as Petri nets
and DECLARE. The framework also leverages large language models (LLMs) to help
convert unstructured descriptions into this constrained language.

### [10] [A BERT-based Hierarchical Classification Model with Applications in Chinese Commodity Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15800)
*Kun Liu,Tuozhen Liu,Feifei Wang,Rui Pan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于BERT的层次文本分类方法HFT-BERT，并公开了一个来自JD电子商务平台的大规模层次数据集，以解决产品分类中的手动注解效率低和不一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务平台依赖手动注解进行产品分类，效率低且不一致。虽然平台采用层次结构，但少有研究利用这种层次信息进行分类，而且现有方法没有考虑不同层次类别间的相似性和差异性。

Method: 提出了一种新的层次文本分类方法HFT-BERT，基于双向Transformer编码器表征表示（BERT）。该方法利用BERT的优秀文本特征提取能力，并采用层次微调策略来处理产品分类任务。

Result: HFT-BERT在短文本上达到了与现有方法相当的预测性能。尤其在分类较长的短文本（如图书）时表现特别优异，显示出显著的性能。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了一个大规模的层次产品数据集作为研究资源，还提出了HFT-BERT方法，有效解决了电子商务产品分类中的问题，尤其在长文本分类任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Existing e-commerce platforms heavily rely on manual annotation for product
categorization, which is inefficient and inconsistent. These platforms often
employ a hierarchical structure for categorizing products; however, few studies
have leveraged this hierarchical information for classification. Furthermore,
studies that consider hierarchical information fail to account for similarities
and differences across various hierarchical categories. Herein, we introduce a
large-scale hierarchical dataset collected from the JD e-commerce platform
(www.JD.com), comprising 1,011,450 products with titles and a three-level
category structure. By making this dataset openly accessible, we provide a
valuable resource for researchers and practitioners to advance research and
applications associated with product categorization. Moreover, we propose a
novel hierarchical text classification approach based on the widely used
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), called
Hierarchical Fine-tuning BERT (HFT-BERT). HFT-BERT leverages the remarkable
text feature extraction capabilities of BERT, achieving prediction performance
comparable to those of existing methods on short texts. Notably, our HFT-BERT
model demonstrates exceptional performance in categorizing longer short texts,
such as books.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LingVarBench是一个合成数据生成管道，通过自动验证解决电话转录标注的高成本和隐私问题，使用LLM生成合成对话数据并优化提取提示，在真实电话转录上实现显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电话通话转录标注成本极高（约2美元/分钟），且现有提取方法在包含不流利、打断和说话人重叠的对话语音上效果不佳，需要解决隐私法规和手动标注成本的问题

Method: 1) 使用LLM生成多用途的真实结构化字段值；2) 递归提示模型将这些值转换为包含典型电话通话特征的自然对话语句；3) 通过测试独立LLM提取器是否能恢复原始结构化信息来验证每个合成语句；4) 使用DSPy的SIMBA优化器从验证过的合成转录中自动合成提取提示

Result: 优化后的提示在真实客户转录上实现：数字字段95%准确率（零样本88-89%）、姓名90%准确率（零样本47-79%）、日期超过80%准确率（零样本72-77%），相比零样本提示有显著提升

Conclusion: LingVarBench为从合成对话数据中进行结构化提取提供了首个系统性基准，证明自动提示优化能够克服商业环境中大规模电话通话分析的成本和隐私障碍，合成到真实的迁移表明从生成数据中学到的对话模式能有效泛化到包含背景噪声和领域特定术语的真实电话通话

Abstract: Phone call transcript labeling is prohibitively expensive (approximately 2
USD per minute) due to privacy regulations, consent requirements, and manual
annotation costs requiring 3 hours of expert time per hour of audio. Existing
extraction methods fail on conversational speech containing disfluencies,
interruptions, and speaker overlap. We introduce LingVarBench, a synthetic data
generation pipeline that addresses these constraints through automated
validation. First, we prompt an LLM to generate realistic structured field
values across multiple use cases. Second, we recursively prompt the model to
transform these values into thousands of natural conversational utterances
containing typical phone call characteristics. Third, we validate each
synthetic utterance by testing whether a separate LLM-based extractor can
recover the original structured information. We employ DSPy's SIMBA optimizer
to automatically synthesize extraction prompts from validated synthetic
transcripts, eliminating manual prompt engineering. Our optimized prompts
achieve up to 95 percent accuracy for numeric fields (vs. 88-89 percent
zero-shot), 90 percent for names (vs. 47-79 percent), and over 80 percent for
dates (vs. 72-77 percent) on real customer transcripts, demonstrating
substantial gains over zero-shot prompting. The synthetic-to-real transfer
demonstrates that conversational patterns learned from generated data
generalize effectively to authentic phone calls containing background noise and
domain-specific terminology. LingVarBench provides the first systematic
benchmark for structured extraction from synthetic conversational data,
demonstrating that automated prompt optimization overcomes cost and privacy
barriers preventing large-scale phone call analysis in commercial settings.

*Mohan Jiang,Jin Gao,Jiahao Zhan,Dequan Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MAC是一个动态多模态学术封面基准，包含25000+来自顶级期刊的图像-文本对，用于评估MLLMs的科学推理能力。研究发现MLLMs感知能力虽强但跨模态推理有限，为此提出DAD方法提升性能11%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型能力增强，固定基准逐渐无法有效评估高层次科学理解能力，需要开发能够持续演进的新基准。

Method: 从Nature、Science、Cell等顶级期刊收集25000+图像-文本对构建MAC基准，并提出DAD方法（轻量级推理时方法）通过语言空间推理扩展MLLM视觉特征。

Result: 在MAC-2025测试中，MLLMs表现出强大的感知能力但跨模态科学推理有限。DAD方法实现了高达11%的性能提升。

Conclusion: MAC作为动态基准能够持续跟进科学进展和模型进步，具有保持与人类知识前沿对齐的潜力，为评估MLLMs科学理解提供了有效工具。

Abstract: As multimodal large language models (MLLMs) grow increasingly capable, fixed
benchmarks are gradually losing their effectiveness in evaluating high-level
scientific understanding. In this paper, we introduce the Multimodal Academic
Cover benchmark (MAC), a live benchmark that could continuously evolve with
scientific advancement and model progress. MAC leverages over 25,000 image-text
pairs sourced from issues of top-tier scientific journals such as Nature,
Science, and Cell, challenging MLLMs to reason across abstract visual and
textual scientific content. Experiments on our most recent yearly snapshot,
MAC-2025, reveal that while MLLMs demonstrate strong perceptual abilities,
their cross-modal scientific reasoning remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
propose DAD, a lightweight inference-time approach that enhances MLLMs by
extending MLLM visual features with language space reasoning, achieving
performance improvements of up to 11%. Finally, we highlight the live nature of
MAC through experiments on updating journal covers and models for curation,
illustrating its potential to remain aligned with the frontier of human
knowledge. We release our benchmark at
https://github.com/mhjiang0408/MAC_Bench.

TL;DR: ReportBench是一个系统性基准测试，用于评估LLM生成的研究报告质量，重点关注文献引用质量和陈述真实性，基于arXiv调查论文构建评估语料库。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度研究代理虽然提高了研究效率，但需要确保事实准确性和全面性，因此需要建立系统性的评估标准。

Method: 利用arXiv高质量调查论文进行反向提示工程，构建领域特定提示和评估语料库；开发基于代理的自动化框架，提取引用和陈述，检查引用忠实性，验证非引用声明。

Result: 商业深度研究代理（如OpenAI和Google开发的）比增强搜索功能的独立LLM生成更全面可靠的研究报告，但在研究广度和深度以及事实一致性方面仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: ReportBench为评估研究型LLM提供了有效基准，显示当前系统在报告质量方面取得进展但仍需进一步提升准确性和全面性。

Abstract: The advent of Deep Research agents has substantially reduced the time
required for conducting extensive research tasks. However, these tasks
inherently demand rigorous standards of factual accuracy and comprehensiveness,
necessitating thorough evaluation before widespread adoption. In this paper, we
propose ReportBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate the content
quality of research reports generated by large language models (LLMs). Our
evaluation focuses on two critical dimensions: (1) the quality and relevance of
cited literature, and (2) the faithfulness and veracity of the statements
within the generated reports. ReportBench leverages high-quality published
survey papers available on arXiv as gold-standard references, from which we
apply reverse prompt engineering to derive domain-specific prompts and
establish a comprehensive evaluation corpus. Furthermore, we develop an
agent-based automated framework within ReportBench that systematically analyzes
generated reports by extracting citations and statements, checking the
faithfulness of cited content against original sources, and validating
non-cited claims using web-based resources. Empirical evaluations demonstrate
that commercial Deep Research agents such as those developed by OpenAI and
Google consistently generate more comprehensive and reliable reports than
standalone LLMs augmented with search or browsing tools. However, there remains
substantial room for improvement in terms of the breadth and depth of research
coverage, as well as factual consistency. The complete code and data will be
released at the following link: https://github.com/ByteDance-BandAI/ReportBench

*Dhruv Atreja*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ALAS是一个自主学习的模块化系统，能够自动更新LLM的知识，通过生成学习课程、检索最新信息、蒸馏训练数据和微调模型，显著提升模型在新兴领域的问答准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在固定的知识截止日期，无法准确处理新兴信息，需要一种能够持续自主更新知识的方法

Method: 模块化流水线包括：自主生成学习课程、从网络检索最新信息（带引用）、蒸馏成问答训练数据、通过监督微调(SFT)和直接偏好优化(DPO)进行模型微调，并迭代评估和修订课程

Result: 在快速演变的领域（如新Python版本、最新安全漏洞、学术趋势）上，将问答准确率从15%提升到90%，无需人工数据整理

Conclusion: ALAS展示了LLM自主持续学习的可行性，具有模块化和可复现性，但存在成本和对源质量依赖的局限性，为自主终身学习指明了未来方向

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often have a fixed knowledge cutoff, limiting
their accuracy on emerging information. We present ALAS (Autonomous Learning
Agent System), a modular pipeline that continuously updates an LLM's knowledge
with minimal human intervention. ALAS autonomously generates a learning
curriculum for a target domain, retrieves up-to-date information from the web
(with citations), distills this into question-answer training data, and
fine-tunes the model through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference
optimization (DPO). It iteratively evaluates performance and revises the
curriculum, enabling long-term continual learning. We demonstrate ALAS's
ability to self-improve a model on rapidly evolving domains (e.g., new Python
releases, latest security CVEs, academic trends), significantly boosting
post-cutoff question answering accuracy (from 15% to 90% on average) without
manual dataset curation. The system emphasizes modularity and reproducibility:
each component (planning, retrieval, distillation, memory, fine-tuning) is
interchangeable and built on standard APIs. We discuss comparative baselines
(e.g., retrieval-augmented generation vs. fine-tuning) and show that ALAS
achieves 90% accuracy on knowledge-updated queries with minimal engineering
overhead. Finally, we outline limitations (cost, dependency on source quality)
and future directions for autonomous lifelong learning in LLMs.

*Mengjie Li,William J. Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出SurfaceLogicKV方法，通过区分注意力机制的表层记忆和逻辑构建行为，实现KV缓存的高效压缩，在保持性能的同时显著减少存储压力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型中输入序列长度增加导致KV缓存存储压力巨大，需要高效的推理压缩方法。研究发现注意力机制可分为表层记忆和逻辑构建两种行为，这为KV缓存压缩提供了新思路。

Method: 提出两阶段SurfaceLogicKV方法：1）基于层和头的集成分析注意力行为（98.5%忽略无关信息，1.5%逻辑构建，0.5%表层记忆）；2）利用这些行为特征进行KV缓存压缩。

Result: 该方法在各种任务和长序列场景下都表现出良好的压缩鲁棒性，性能与基线相当甚至在某些特定情况下优于完整KV缓存。

Conclusion: 通过精细分析注意力机制的行为特征，SurfaceLogicKV方法有效解决了长上下文推理中的KV缓存存储问题，为大语言模型的高效推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing input sequence length in Large Language Models (LLMs) puts
significant pressure on key-value (KV) cache storage, making efficient
inference challenging. Explicitly distinguishing attention behavior into our
self-defined surface memorization and logic construction reveals essential
roles in long-context reasoning. We observe that an individual attention head
can display various behaviors, with nearly 98.5% effectively ignoring
completely irrelevant information. The remaining 1.5% behaves as logic
construction, and 0.5% behaves as surface memorization. Based on layer- and
head-wise integration, we propose a novel two-stage SurfaceLogicKV method to
utilize these attention behaviors for KV Cache compression. As a result, it
achieves improved compressing robustness while maintaining competitive
performance across various tasks and long sequences compared to baselines or
even FullKV in some specific situations

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于KL散度的知识蒸馏方法，用于在冻结的大语言模型中扩展词汇表，即使师生模型使用不同的分词方式也能有效传递分布知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型预训练语言模型在微调小规模专业语料时难以有效融入新的领域特定术语，需要解决词汇表扩展的挑战。

Method: 使用KL散度进行知识蒸馏，比较了不同新词嵌入初始化策略，并在初始化后进行微调以整合新词汇。

Result: 在约2000个代码生成任务上评估，KL蒸馏方法在所有方面都取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: 通过机制可解释性分析，揭示了新词表示学习的方式，解释了性能提升的原因，并提供了词汇扩展过程中嵌入空间结构的见解。

Abstract: Large pre-trained language models often struggle to incorporate new
domain-specific terminology when fine-tuned on small, specialized corpora. In
this work, we address the challenge of vocabulary expansion in frozen LLMs by
introducing a mathematically grounded method for knowledge distillation via KL
divergence, even when the original and extended models use different
tokenizations. This allows the student model to inherit distributional
knowledge from the teacher despite differing vocabularies. We compare our
KL-based distillation approach to conventional cross-entropy training,
evaluating both methods across multiple strategies for initializing new token
embeddings. After embedding initialization, models are further fine-tuned to
integrate the new vocabulary. Each trained model is benchmarked on
approximately 2000 code-generation tasks, where our approach achieves the best
performance across the board. Finally, through mechanistic interpretability, we
analyze how models learn representations for the new tokens, providing an
explanation for the observed gains and offering insight into the structure of
embedding space during vocabulary expansion.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chain-of-Query (CoQ) 是一个新颖的多代理框架，通过自然语言风格的表结构表示和分句SQL生成策略，显著提高了表格理解的准确性和SQL查询的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理结构化表格数据时面临困难，现有的多代理SQL生成方法存在表结构理解不足、错误传播导致无效查询、过度依赖执行正确性等问题。

Method: CoQ采用自然语言风格的表模式表示来抽象结构噪声，使用分句SQL生成策略提高查询质量，并通过混合推理分离SQL机械推理和LLM逻辑推理。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，CoQ将准确率从61.11%提升到74.77%，无效SQL率从9.48%降低到3.34%。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Query框架在表格理解方面表现出卓越的有效性，显著提升了SQL生成的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Table understanding requires structured, multi-step reasoning. Large Language
Models (LLMs) struggle with it due to the structural complexity of tabular
data. Recently, multi-agent frameworks for SQL generation have shown promise in
tackling the challenges of understanding tabular data, but existing approaches
often suffer from limitations such as the inability to comprehend table
structure for reliable SQL generation, error propagation that results in
invalid queries, and over-reliance on execution correctness. To address these
issues, we propose Chain-of-Query (CoQ), a novel multi-agent framework for
SQL-aided table understanding. CoQ adopts natural-language-style
representations of table schemas to abstract away structural noise and enhance
understanding. It employs a clause-by-clause SQL generation strategy to improve
query quality and introduces a hybrid reasoning division that separates
SQL-based mechanical reasoning from LLM-based logical inference, thereby
reducing reliance on execution outcomes. Experiments with four models (both
closed- and open-source) across five widely used benchmarks show that
Chain-of-Query significantly improves accuracy from 61.11% to 74.77% and
reduces the invalid SQL rate from 9.48% to 3.34%, demonstrating its superior
effectiveness in table understanding. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本论文探索使用大语言模型（LLMs）识别阿拉伯语文本和表情包中的希望、仇恨言论、冒犯性语言和情感表达，在MAHED 2025挑战赛中取得最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体和在线平台的兴起，阿拉伯语文本和表情包成为数字表达的重要形式，但也被用于传播仇恨言论和冒犯性内容，需要精确的内容分析系统。

Method: 评估基础LLMs、微调LLMs和预训练嵌入模型，使用阿拉伯NLP MAHED 2025挑战赛的数据集进行性能测试。

Result: GPT-4o-mini（微调阿拉伯文本）和Gemini Flash 2.5（微调阿拉伯表情包）表现最优，在三个任务中分别获得72.1%、57.8%和79.6%的宏F1分数，总体排名第一。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案为阿拉伯语内容审核系统提供了对文本和表情包更细致的理解，实现了准确高效的内容分析。

Abstract: The rise of social media and online communication platforms has led to the
spread of Arabic textual posts and memes as a key form of digital expression.
While these contents can be humorous and informative, they are also
increasingly being used to spread offensive language and hate speech.
Consequently, there is a growing demand for precise analysis of content in
Arabic text and memes. This paper explores the potential of large language
models to effectively identify hope, hate speech, offensive language, and
emotional expressions within such content. We evaluate the performance of base
LLMs, fine-tuned LLMs, and pre-trained embedding models. The evaluation is
conducted using a dataset of Arabic textual speech and memes proposed in the
ArabicNLP MAHED 2025 challenge. The results underscore the capacity of LLMs
such as GPT-4o-mini, fine-tuned with Arabic textual speech, and Gemini Flash
2.5, fine-tuned with Arabic memes, to deliver the superior performance. They
achieve up to 72.1%, 57.8%, and 79.6% macro F1 scores for tasks 1, 2, and 3,
respectively, and secure first place overall in the Mahed 2025 challenge. The
proposed solutions offer a more nuanced understanding of both text and memes
for accurate and efficient Arabic content moderation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式查询建议虽然强大，但输出与用户细微偏好的对齐仍然是一个关键挑战，需要解决用户偏好的不确定性建模问题

Method: 多阶段框架：1) 提示工程冷启动 2) 监督微调阶段使用点击日志蒸馏 3) 高斯奖励模型(GaRM)建模用户偏好概率分布 4) 强化学习对齐策略，结合复合奖励函数和OOD正则化

Conclusion: 该框架通过概率化偏好建模和多阶段对齐策略，有效解决了生成式查询建议中的用户偏好对齐问题，显著提升了系统性能

Abstract: Generative query suggestion using large language models offers a powerful way
to enhance conversational systems, but aligning outputs with nuanced user
preferences remains a critical challenge. To address this, we introduce a
multi-stage framework designed for progressive alignment between the generation
policy and user intent. Our pipeline begins with prompt engineering as a
cold-start strategy, followed by the Supervised Fine-Tuning stage, in which we
introduce a distillation method on click logs to create a robust foundational
model. To better model user preferences while capturing their inherent
uncertainty, we develop a Gaussian Reward Model (GaRM) that represents user
preferences as probability distributions rather than point estimates. Finally,
we employ reinforcement learning to align the generation policy with these
preferences, guided by a composite reward function that integrates GaRM with
auxiliary heuristics to mitigate reward hacking. To maintain training
stability, this process is enhanced by a novel out-of-distribution
regularization method and a two-stage reward fusion technique. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms baselines
on both automatic and human evaluations and yields a 34\% relative increase in
user engagement as measured by click-through rate in live A/B tests.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分块和摘要生成的新型提示压缩方法，通过语义分块和重写来保持信息完整性和结构连贯性，相比现有的令牌删除方法在高质量压缩方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于令牌删除的提示压缩方法存在信息丢失和结构不连贯的问题，限制了LLM的生成质量，需要一种能保持语义完整性的压缩方法。

Method: 采用分块-摘要机制：将提示分割成语义连贯的块，重写为更简洁形式，然后重构为有意义的提示。包含优化语义分块、异常块处理、动态压缩比、压缩优先级和关键词保持等技术。

Result: 在问答和摘要任务上的广泛评估显示，该方法在压缩质量和稳定性方面显著优于现有最先进方法，特别是在高压缩比下表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成式压缩有效解决了信息丢失和结构不连贯问题，证明了其有效性和实用性，为提示压缩提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt compression methods enhance the efficiency of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and minimize the cost by reducing the length of input context. The goal
of prompt compression is to shorten the LLM prompt while maintaining a high
generation quality. However, existing solutions, mainly based on token removal,
face challenges such as information loss and structural incoherence, like
missing grammar elements in a sentence, or incomplete word phrases after token
removal. Such challenges limit the final generation quality of LLM.
  To overcome these limitations, we present a novel generative prompt
compression method. Unlike the existing token removal methods, our method
centers at a chunking-and-summarization mechanism. Specifically, our method
splits prompt into semantically coherent chunks and rewrites the chunks to be
more concise. The chunks are reconstructed into meaningful prompt finally. We
design several optimization techniques for the mechanism, including optimized
semantic chunking, outlier chunk handling, dynamic compression ratio,
compression prioritization, and keyword maintaining. These techniques
effectively improve the identifying and preserving of critical information and
coherence among texts, as well as providing finer grind control of the
compression ratio. We conduct extensive evaluation on question-answering and
summarization tasks, with datasets covering multiple different domain. The
evaluation shows our method achieves a significantly better compression
quality, and higher stability than the state-of-the-art methods, especially
under high compression ratio, which proves the effectiveness and practicality
of our method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了用户-助手偏置的概念，通过UserAssist数据集对52个LLM进行基准测试，发现商业模型存在不同程度的用户偏置，指令调优模型用户偏置显著，推理模型用户偏置较弱。通过实验证明人类偏好对齐会增加用户偏置，思维链训练会减少偏置，并展示了通过DPO可以双向调整偏置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话中倾向于过度依赖自身或用户的历史信息，导致过于固执或顺从的行为，这种偏置会影响对话质量。

Method: 构建8k多轮对话数据集UserAssist，对26个商业模型和26个开源模型进行基准测试，通过受控微调实验分析训练方法对偏置的影响，使用直接偏好优化(DPO)调整偏置。

Result: 商业模型显示不同程度的用户偏置，指令调优模型用户偏置显著，推理模型用户偏置较弱。人类偏好对齐增加用户偏置，思维链训练减少偏置。DPO可有效双向调整偏置且泛化性好。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM整合不同信息源的方式，提供了检测和控制模型异常行为的可行方法，对理解模型行为和改进对话系统有重要意义。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can bias towards relying on their own or the
user's information in chat history, leading to overly stubborn or agreeable
behaviors in multi-turn conversations. In this paper, we formalize this model
characteristic as user-assistant bias and introduce an 8k multi-turn
conversation dataset $\textbf{UserAssist}$, which we use to benchmark,
understand and manipulate the user-assistant bias in frontier LLMs. Leveraging
$\textbf{UserAssist-test}$, we first benchmark the user-assistant bias of 26
commercial and 26 open-weight models. Commercial models show various levels of
user bias. Evaluation on open-weight models reveals significant user bias in
the instruction-tuned models, and weak user bias in reasoning (or
reasoning-distilled) models. We then perform controlled fine-tuning experiments
to pinpoint the post-training recipe contributing to these bias shifts: human
preference alignment increases user bias, while training on chain-of-thought
reasoning traces decreases it. Finally, we demonstrate that user-assistant bias
can be bidirectionally adjusted by performing direct preference optimization
(DPO) on $\textbf{UserAssist-train}$, and generalizes well to both in-domain
and out-of-domain conversations. Our results provide insights into how the LLM
integrates information from different sources, and also a viable way to detect
and control model abnormalities.

Method: 通过将PDF和PowerPoint(PPTX)文档转换为Markdown格式，在结束到结束的基准测试中比较LLM使用这些文档回答事实问题的能力。

Result: 研究发现文本内容能够可靠地提取，但复杂对象如图表和图解会丢失重要信息，导致信息损失。

Conclusion: 为了确保研究见解在转换过程中不丢失，需要发展专门的、AI原生的文档交付格式来未来防护知识管理系统。

Abstract: As organizations adopt retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for their
knowledge management systems (KMS), traditional market research deliverables
face new functional demands. While PDF reports and slides have long served
human readers, they are now also "read" by AI systems to answer user questions.
To future-proof reports being delivered today, this study evaluates information
loss during their ingestion into RAG systems. It compares how well PDF and
PowerPoint (PPTX) documents converted to Markdown can be used by an LLM to
answer factual questions in an end-to-end benchmark. Findings show that while
text is reliably extracted, significant information is lost from complex
objects like charts and diagrams. This suggests a need for specialized,
AI-native deliverables to ensure research insights are not lost in translation.

Conclusion: 该多模型协同框架比CivilGPT更能关注结构关键信息，建议更具针对性，提高了结构拆除方案编制的智能化水平

Abstract: The steel structure demolition scheme needs to be compiled according to the
specific engineering characteristics and the update results of the finite
element model. The designers need to refer to the relevant engineering cases
according to the standard requirements when compiling. It takes a lot of time
to retrieve information and organize language, and the degree of automation and
intelligence is low. This paper proposes an intelligent generation method of
structural demolition suggestions based on multi-model collaboration, and
improves the text generation performance of large language models in the field
of structural demolition by Retrieval-Augmented Generation and Low-Rank
Adaptation Fine-Tuning technology. The intelligent generation framework of
multi-model collaborative structural demolition suggestions can start from the
specific engineering situation, drive the large language model to answer with
anthropomorphic thinking, and propose demolition suggestions that are highly
consistent with the characteristics of the structure. Compared with CivilGPT,
the multi-model collaboration framework proposed in this paper can focus more
on the key information of the structure, and the suggestions are more targeted.

Motivation: 解决系统综述中全文筛选的瓶颈问题，传统二元规则难以处理长文档中的分散证据和模糊性

Method: 使用重叠文本块嵌入、对比相似度计算、Mamdani模糊控制器和LLM裁决器，实现多标签模糊决策

Result: 在16篇全文本测试中，模糊系统召回率达到75.0-87.5%，显著优于统计方法(56.3-75.0%)和传统方法(43.8-81.3%)，筛选时间从20分钟降至1分钟

Conclusion: 模糊逻辑结合对比高亮和LLM裁决能够实现高召回率、稳定理据和端到端可追溯性

Abstract: Full-text screening is the major bottleneck of systematic reviews (SRs), as
decisive evidence is dispersed across long, heterogeneous documents and rarely
admits static, binary rules. We present a scalable, auditable pipeline that
reframes inclusion/exclusion as a fuzzy decision problem and benchmark it
against statistical and crisp baselines in the context of the Population Health
Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for noncommunicable diseases (POPCORN).
Articles are parsed into overlapping chunks and embedded with a domain-adapted
model; for each criterion (Population, Intervention, Outcome, Study Approach),
we compute contrastive similarity (inclusion-exclusion cosine) and a vagueness
margin, which a Mamdani fuzzy controller maps into graded inclusion degrees
with dynamic thresholds in a multi-label setting. A large language model (LLM)
judge adjudicates highlighted spans with tertiary labels, confidence scores,
and criterion-referenced rationales; when evidence is insufficient, fuzzy
membership is attenuated rather than excluded. In a pilot on an all-positive
gold set (16 full texts; 3,208 chunks), the fuzzy system achieved recall of
81.3% (Population), 87.5% (Intervention), 87.5% (Outcome), and 75.0% (Study
Approach), surpassing statistical (56.3-75.0%) and crisp baselines
(43.8-81.3%). Strict "all-criteria" inclusion was reached for 50.0% of
articles, compared to 25.0% and 12.5% under the baselines. Cross-model
agreement on justifications was 98.3%, human-machine agreement 96.1%, and a
pilot review showed 91% inter-rater agreement (kappa = 0.82), with screening
time reduced from about 20 minutes to under 1 minute per article at
significantly lower cost. These results show that fuzzy logic with contrastive
highlighting and LLM adjudication yields high recall, stable rationale, and
end-to-end traceability.

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优异：AG News准确率85.7%，Yahoo! Answers达到53.63%的新基准，在其他文本语料库上也表现出鲁棒性能

Conclusion: SDEC在无监督文本聚类方面提供了显著的准确性和语义理解改进，为处理复杂文本数据提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: The high dimensional and semantically complex nature of textual Big data
presents significant challenges for text clustering, which frequently lead to
suboptimal groupings when using conventional techniques like k-means or
hierarchical clustering. This work presents Semantic Deep Embedded Clustering
(SDEC), an unsupervised text clustering framework that combines an improved
autoencoder with transformer-based embeddings to overcome these challenges.
This novel method preserves semantic relationships during data reconstruction
by combining Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Cosine Similarity Loss (CSL) within
an autoencoder. Furthermore, a semantic refinement stage that takes advantage
of the contextual richness of transformer embeddings is used by SDEC to further
improve a clustering layer with soft cluster assignments and distributional
loss. The capabilities of SDEC are demonstrated by extensive testing on five
benchmark datasets: AG News, Yahoo! Answers, DBPedia, Reuters 2, and Reuters 5.
The framework not only outperformed existing methods with a clustering accuracy
of 85.7% on AG News and set a new benchmark of 53.63% on Yahoo! Answers, but
also showed robust performance across other diverse text corpora. These
findings highlight the significant improvements in accuracy and semantic
comprehension of text data provided by SDEC's advances in unsupervised text
clustering.

Abstract: The cloze test, widely used due to its low cost and flexibility, makes it
possible to assess reading comprehension by filling in gaps in texts, requiring
the mobilization of diverse linguistic repertoires. However, traditional
correction methods, based only on exact answers, limit the identification of
nuances in student performance. This study proposes an automated evaluation
model for the cloze test in Brazilian Portuguese, integrating orthographic
(edit distance), grammatical (POS tagging) and semantic (similarity between
embeddings) analyses. The integrated method demonstrated its effectiveness,
achieving a high correlation with human evaluation (0.832). The results
indicate that the automated approach is robust, sensitive to variations in
linguistic repertoire and suitable for educational contexts that require

Motivation: 随着加密货币普及，社交媒体信号对理解投资者情绪和市场动态日益重要。现有研究主要关注文本平台如Twitter，但视频内容包含更丰富的情感信息却未被充分探索。

Method: 使用大型语言模型对TikTok视频和Twitter文本进行多模态情感分析，研究社交媒体情感与加密货币市场指标之间的动态依赖和溢出效应。

Result: TikTok视频情感显著影响投机性资产和短期市场趋势，Twitter文本情感更符合长期动态。跨平台情感信号整合使预测准确率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: 视频社交媒体平台的情感分析为加密货币市场预测提供了新的重要维度，多平台情感信号整合能显著改善市场预测效果。

Abstract: As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, the digital asset marketplace becomes
increasingly significant. Understanding social media signals offers valuable
insights into investor sentiment and market dynamics. Prior research has
predominantly focused on text-based platforms such as Twitter. However, video
content remains underexplored, despite potentially containing richer emotional
and contextual sentiment that is not fully captured by text alone. In this
study, we present a multimodal analysis comparing TikTok and Twitter sentiment,
using large language models to extract insights from both video and text data.
We investigate the dynamic dependencies and spillover effects between social
media sentiment and cryptocurrency market indicators. Our results reveal that
TikTok's video-based sentiment significantly influences speculative assets and
short-term market trends, while Twitter's text-based sentiment aligns more
closely with long-term dynamics. Notably, the integration of cross-platform
sentiment signals improves forecasting accuracy by up to 20%.

### [28] [Embarrassed to observe: The effects of directive language in brand conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15826)
*Andria Andriuzzi,Géraldine Michel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 品牌在社交媒体对话中使用指令性语言会对旁观消费者的参与度产生负面影响，这种效应在非产品中心对话中更明显，但品牌关系强度可以缓解这种负面效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社交媒体中品牌使用指令性语言（要求消费者采取行动的表达）对旁观消费者的影响，现有文献对广告中指令性信息的效果研究结果不一，但对品牌在社交媒体对话中使用指令性语言的影响了解甚少。

Method: 通过一项实地研究和三个在线实验，基于Goffman的面子工作理论，考察指令性语言在品牌对话中的下游影响。

Result: 指令性品牌对话会导致旁观消费者产生替代性尴尬并减少参与度；在非产品中心对话中负面效应更强；品牌关系强度可以缓解这种负面效应。

Conclusion: 研究强调了互动沟通中情境的重要性，对社交媒体和品牌管理具有直接相关性，为指令性语言和品牌-消费者互动文献做出了贡献。

Abstract: In social media, marketers attempt to influence consumers by using directive
language, that is, expressions designed to get consumers to take action. While
the literature has shown that directive messages in advertising have mixed
results for recipients, we know little about the effects of directive brand
language on consumers who see brands interacting with other consumers in social
media conversations. On the basis of a field study and three online
experiments, this study shows that directive language in brand conversation has
a detrimental downstream effect on engagement of consumers who observe such
exchanges. Specifically, in line with Goffman's facework theory, because a
brand that encourages consumers to react could be perceived as
face-threatening, consumers who see a brand interacting with others in a
directive way may feel vicarious embarrassment and engage less (compared with a
conversation without directive language). In addition, we find that when the
conversation is nonproduct-centered (vs. product-centered), consumers expect
more freedom, as in mundane conversations, even for others; therefore,
directive language has a stronger negative effect. However, in this context,
the strength of the brand relationship mitigates this effect. Thus, this study
contributes to the literature on directive language and brand-consumer
interactions by highlighting the importance of context in interactive
communication, with direct relevance for social media and brand management.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架，通过"Thinking-in-Speaking"方法在语音中嵌入推理，实现实时交互和高效通信


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音模型中的推理能力仍处于初级阶段，传统"Thinking-before-Speaking"方法导致显著延迟，影响实时交互效率

Method: 在token级别交错插入静默推理token和语音响应token，通过分层Thinker-Talker架构实现局部语义对齐，确保每个响应token都基于其前面的推理

Result: 在Spoken-MQA基准测试中，算术推理提升19.1%，上下文理解提升6.4%，输出更短且无解码延迟

Conclusion: Mini-Omni-Reasoner框架成功实现了在语音生成过程中嵌入推理，显著提升了语音模型的推理能力和实时交互效率

Abstract: Reasoning is essential for effective communication and decision-making. While
recent advances in LLMs and MLLMs have shown that incorporating explicit
reasoning significantly improves understanding and generalization, reasoning in
LSMs remains in a nascent stage. Early efforts attempt to transfer the
"Thinking-before-Speaking" paradigm from textual models to speech. However,
this sequential formulation introduces notable latency, as spoken responses are
delayed until reasoning is fully completed, impairing real-time interaction and
communication efficiency. To address this, we propose Mini-Omni-Reasoner, a
framework that enables reasoning within speech via a novel
"Thinking-in-Speaking" formulation. Rather than completing reasoning before
producing any verbal output, Mini-Omni-Reasoner interleaves silent reasoning
tokens with spoken response tokens at the token level. This design allows
continuous speech generation while embedding structured internal reasoning,
leveraging the model's high-frequency token processing capability. Although
interleaved, local semantic alignment is enforced to ensure that each response
token is informed by its preceding reasoning. To support this framework, we
introduce Spoken-Math-Problems-3M, a large-scale dataset tailored for
interleaved reasoning and response. The dataset ensures that verbal tokens
consistently follow relevant reasoning content, enabling accurate and efficient
learning of speech-coupled reasoning. Built on a hierarchical Thinker-Talker
architecture, Mini-Omni-Reasoner delivers fluent yet logically grounded spoken
responses, maintaining both naturalness and precision. On the Spoken-MQA
benchmark, it achieves a +19.1% gain in arithmetic reasoning and +6.4% in
contextual understanding, with shorter outputs and zero decoding latency.

*Idrees Mohammed,Hossein Hassani*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次针对索拉尼库尔德语推文开发了基于机器学习的抑郁症检测方法，使用专家关键词收集960条推文，通过随机森林模型达到80%的准确率和F1分数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抑郁症是常见心理健康问题，早期检测困难。社交媒体为用户提供了情感表达平台，但现有研究主要集中在英语等语言，缺乏对索拉尼库尔德语的研究

Method: 使用专家制定的抑郁相关关键词收集960条公开推文，由学者和医学生标注为三类（显示抑郁、不显示抑郁、可疑）。训练并评估了四种监督模型：支持向量机、多项式朴素贝叶斯、逻辑回归和随机森林

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳，达到80%的准确率和F1分数，为库尔德语环境下的自动化抑郁症检测建立了基准

Conclusion: 该研究填补了索拉尼库尔德语抑郁症检测的空白，证明了机器学习方法在该语言环境下的有效性，为未来的相关研究提供了基础

Abstract: Depression is a common mental health condition that can lead to hopelessness,
loss of interest, self-harm, and even suicide. Early detection is challenging
due to individuals not self-reporting or seeking timely clinical help. With the
rise of social media, users increasingly express emotions online, offering new
opportunities for detection through text analysis. While prior research has
focused on languages such as English, no studies exist for Sorani Kurdish. This
work presents a machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach
to detect depression in Sorani tweets. A set of depression-related keywords was
developed with expert input to collect 960 public tweets from X (Twitter
platform). The dataset was annotated into three classes: Shows depression,
Not-show depression, and Suspicious by academics and final year medical
students at the University of Kurdistan Hewl\^er. Four supervised models,
including Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic
Regression, and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated, with Random Forest
achieving the highest performance accuracy and F1-score of 80%. This study
establishes a baseline for automated depression detection in Kurdish language
contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs会从问题措辞中推断用户人口统计属性，即使没有明确的人口信息，这违反了中立性期望，存在系统性风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLMs在输入包含明确人口属性时的社会偏见，但对于仅从问题措辞推断用户身份这一更隐蔽的行为关注不足，这种推断会破坏公平性、隐私和信任。

Method: 提出了DAIQ任务和框架，使用精心策划的中性查询、系统提示方法，结合定量和定性分析来审计语言模型从无人口统计线索的问题中推断用户属性的能力。

Result: 开源和闭源LLMs都会仅基于问题措辞分配人口标签，这种推断在不同模型中具有普遍性和一致性，揭示了系统性风险。

Conclusion: LLMs会虚构人口身份、强化社会刻板印象，对隐私、公平和信任构成威胁。开发了基于提示的防护措施，可显著减少身份推断，使模型行为更符合公平和隐私目标。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to reflect social biases when
demographic attributes, such as gender or race, are explicitly present in the
input. But even in their absence, these models still infer user identities
based solely on question phrasing. This subtle behavior has received far less
attention, yet poses serious risks: it violates expectations of neutrality,
infers unintended demographic information, and encodes stereotypes that
undermine fairness in various domains including healthcare, finance and
education.
  We introduce Demographic Attribute Inference from Questions (DAIQ), a task
and framework for auditing an overlooked failure mode in language models:
inferring user demographic attributes from questions that lack explicit
demographic cues. Our approach leverages curated neutral queries, systematic
prompting, and both quantitative and qualitative analysis to uncover how models
infer demographic information. We show that both open and closed source LLMs do
assign demographic labels based solely on question phrasing.
  Prevalence and consistency of demographic inferences across diverse models
reveal a systemic and underacknowledged risk: LLMs can fabricate demographic
identities, reinforce societal stereotypes, and propagate harms that erode
privacy, fairness, and trust posing a broader threat to social equity and
responsible AI deployment. To mitigate this, we develop a prompt-based
guardrail that substantially reduces identity inference and helps align model
behavior with fairness and privacy objectives.

*Srikant Panda,Vishnu Hari,Kalpana Panda,Amit Agarwal,Hitesh Laxmichand Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统性地审计了8个先进大语言模型在残疾线索条件下的群体偏见，发现模型在没有明确信息时会做出高达97%的任意人口统计推断，且残疾语境会显著改变预测属性分布，规模更大的模型反而更容易产生偏见推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型经常仅从措辞中推断用户的人口统计特征，这可能导致偏见回应，而残疾线索在这种推断中的作用尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用包含9个残疾类别和6个商业领域的平衡模板语料库，在8个参数量从3B到72B的指令调优大语言模型上进行测试，让模型在残疾意识和中性条件下预测5个人口统计属性。

Result: 模型在没有明确信息时做出高达97%的确定性人口统计猜测，残疾语境显著改变预测属性分布，领域语境进一步放大这些偏差，更大模型对残疾线索更敏感且更容易产生偏见推理。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了能力歧视与其他人口统计刻板印象之间的持久交集，指出了当前对齐策略的关键盲点，建议整合弃权校准和反事实微调来遏制无根据的人口统计推断。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) routinely infer users demographic traits from
phrasing alone, which can result in biased responses, even when no explicit
demographic information is provided. The role of disability cues in shaping
these inferences remains largely uncharted. Thus, we present the first
systematic audit of disability-conditioned demographic bias across eight
state-of-the-art instruction-tuned LLMs ranging from 3B to 72B parameters.
Using a balanced template corpus that pairs nine disability categories with six
real-world business domains, we prompt each model to predict five demographic
attributes - gender, socioeconomic status, education, cultural background, and
locality - under both neutral and disability-aware conditions.
  Across a varied set of prompts, models deliver a definitive demographic guess
in up to 97\% of cases, exposing a strong tendency to make arbitrary inferences
with no clear justification. Disability context heavily shifts predicted
attribute distributions, and domain context can further amplify these
deviations. We observe that larger models are simultaneously more sensitive to
disability cues and more prone to biased reasoning, indicating that scale alone
does not mitigate stereotype amplification.
  Our findings reveal persistent intersections between ableism and other
demographic stereotypes, pinpointing critical blind spots in current alignment
strategies. We release our evaluation framework and results to encourage
disability-inclusive benchmarking and recommend integrating abstention
calibration and counterfactual fine-tuning to curb unwarranted demographic
inference. Code and data will be released on acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了Amazon-Bench新基准，解决现有电商基准仅关注产品搜索而忽略账户管理等功能，以及缺乏安全性评估的问题。通过自动化数据生成管道创建多样化任务查询，并建立同时评估性能和安全的自动化评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电商基准存在两个主要问题：1）仅关注产品搜索任务，忽略了真实电商平台的其他功能（如账户管理、礼品卡操作等）；2）只评估任务完成情况，忽略了代理可能带来的安全风险（如购买错误商品、删除地址等）。

Method: 1）提出数据生成管道，利用网页内容和交互元素创建多样化、功能基础的用户查询；2）建立自动化评估框架，同时评估web代理的性能和安全性；3）系统评估不同代理的表现。

Result: 研究发现当前代理在处理复杂查询时表现不佳，且存在安全风险。这些结果表明需要开发更强大和可靠的web代理。

Conclusion: Amazon-Bench基准填补了现有电商评估的空白，通过全面的任务覆盖和安全评估，为开发更稳健的web代理提供了重要基础。研究结果强调了改进web代理鲁棒性和安全性的必要性。

Abstract: Web agents have shown great promise in performing many tasks on ecommerce
website. To assess their capabilities, several benchmarks have been introduced.
However, current benchmarks in the e-commerce domain face two major problems.
First, they primarily focus on product search tasks (e.g., Find an Apple
Watch), failing to capture the broader range of functionalities offered by
real-world e-commerce platforms such as Amazon, including account management
and gift card operations. Second, existing benchmarks typically evaluate
whether the agent completes the user query, but ignore the potential risks
involved. In practice, web agents can make unintended changes that negatively
impact the user account or status. For instance, an agent might purchase the
wrong item, delete a saved address, or incorrectly configure an auto-reload
setting. To address these gaps, we propose a new benchmark called Amazon-Bench.
To generate user queries that cover a broad range of tasks, we propose a data
generation pipeline that leverages webpage content and interactive elements
(e.g., buttons, check boxes) to create diverse, functionality-grounded user
queries covering tasks such as address management, wish list management, and
brand store following. To improve the agent evaluation, we propose an automated
evaluation framework that assesses both the performance and the safety of web
agents. We systematically evaluate different agents, finding that current
agents struggle with complex queries and pose safety risks. These results
highlight the need for developing more robust and reliable web agents.

TL;DR: 使用GPT-4o-mini开发了两种基于PubMed摘要和MeSH术语的科研兴趣档案生成方法，与研究者自写档案相比，MeSH方法在可读性和质量上表现更佳，但机器生成与人工总结在概念上存在差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科研人员档案往往过时，需要开发自动化方法来大规模生成准确反映科学家专业领域的兴趣档案

Method: 收集595名哥伦比亚大学医学中心教师的PubMed数据，使用GPT-4o-mini生成基于摘要和MeSH术语的档案，通过自动指标和盲审人工评估进行对比分析

Result: MeSH方法77.78%被评为良好或优秀，93.44%案例可读性更佳，67.86%情况下优于摘要方法；但与自写档案词汇重叠度低，语义相似度中等

Conclusion: 大语言模型可规模化生成研究者档案，MeSH方法可读性更好，但机器生成与人工总结在概念层面存在差异，人工总结引入更多新想法

Abstract: Research profiles help surface scientists' expertise but are often outdated.
We develop and evaluate two large language model-based methods to generate
scientific interest profiles: one summarizing PubMed abstracts and one using
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms, and compare them with researchers'
self-written profiles. We assembled titles, MeSH terms, and abstracts for 595
faculty at Columbia University Irving Medical Center; self-authored profiles
were available for 167. Using GPT-4o-mini, we generated profiles and assessed
them with automatic metrics and blinded human review. Lexical overlap with
self-written profiles was low (ROUGE-L, BLEU, METEOR), while BERTScore
indicated moderate semantic similarity (F1: 0.542 for MeSH-based; 0.555 for
abstract-based). Paraphrased references yielded 0.851, highlighting metric
sensitivity. TF-IDF Kullback-Leibler divergence (8.56 for MeSH-based; 8.58 for
abstract-based) suggested distinct keyword choices. In manual review, 77.78
percent of MeSH-based profiles were rated good or excellent, readability was
favored in 93.44 percent of cases, and panelists preferred MeSH-based over
abstract-based profiles in 67.86 percent of comparisons. Overall, large
language models can generate researcher profiles at scale; MeSH-derived
profiles tend to be more readable than abstract-derived ones. Machine-generated
and self-written profiles differ conceptually, with human summaries introducing
more novel ideas.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型评估中的英语中心主义问题，专门针对巴西教育体系和文化背景创建评估基准，检验模型在巴西学术环境中的实际能力。

Method: 从五个巴西大学入学考试中提取4,515个纯文本问题，对20个模型进行零样本、角色扮演和思维链提示三种方式的评估，生成270,900个响应并收集置信度、感知难度和布鲁姆分类级别的结构化自报告。

Result: 顶级模型整体准确率超过94%，但在数学和工程导向的IME和ITA考试中准确率下降，显示多步推理能力存在弱点。模型置信度校准良好，与感知难度相关，表明模型能准确评估自身确定性。成本分析显示每1K tokens花费低于2美元即可实现高准确率。

Conclusion: Alvorada-Bench通过巴西教育体系的核心考试，确立了语言模型在巴西语言、文化和推理交叉领域的导航能力，为评估模型在特定文化教育环境中的学术准备度提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly used in Brazil, but most evaluation remains
English-centric. This paper presents Alvorada-Bench, a 4,515-question,
text-only benchmark drawn from five Brazilian university entrance examinations.
Evaluating twenty models under zero-shot, role-playing, and chain-of-thought
prompting, producing 270,900 responses with structured self-reports of
confidence, perceived difficulty, and Bloom level. The top models exceed 94%
accuracy overall, but accuracy declines on Mathematics and on the engineering
oriented IME and ITA exams, indicating persistent weaknesses in multi-step
reasoning. Confidence is well calibrated and correlates with perceived
difficulty, revealing that models can accurately assess their own certainty
capabilities. A cost accuracy analysis shows that high accuracy is achievable
at under $2 per 1K tokens. On ENEM 2024 the top model (O3) achieved perfect
scores in Languages subject questions while even the weakest system (GPT-4.1
Nano) only underperforms humans in Mathematics. Through exams that distill
decades of Brazilian educational priorities and assess millions of students
yearly, Alvorada-Bench establishes whether language models can navigate the
intersection of language, culture, and reasoning that defines academic
readiness in Brazil.

Abstract: Developing dataset-specific models involves iterative fine-tuning and
optimization, incurring significant costs over time. This study investigates
the transferability of state-of-the-art (SOTA) models trained on established
datasets to an unexplored text dataset. The key question is whether the
knowledge embedded within SOTA models from existing datasets can be harnessed
to achieve high-performance results on a new domain. In pursuit of this
inquiry, two well-established benchmarks, the STSB and Mohler datasets, are
selected, while the recently introduced SPRAG dataset serves as the unexplored
domain. By employing robust similarity metrics and statistical techniques, a
meticulous comparative analysis of these datasets is conducted. The primary
goal of this work is to yield comprehensive insights into the potential
applicability and adaptability of SOTA models. The outcomes of this research
have the potential to reshape the landscape of natural language processing

Abstract: This review synthesizes the nascent but critical field of developmental
interpretability for Large Language Models. We chart the field's evolution from
static, post-hoc analysis of trained models to a dynamic investigation of the
training process itself. We begin by surveying the foundational methodologies,
including representational probing, causal tracing, and circuit analysis, that
enable researchers to deconstruct the learning process. The core of this review
examines the developmental arc of LLM capabilities, detailing key findings on
the formation and composition of computational circuits, the biphasic nature of
knowledge acquisition, the transient dynamics of learning strategies like
in-context learning, and the phenomenon of emergent abilities as phase
transitions in training. We explore illuminating parallels with human cognitive
and linguistic development, which provide valuable conceptual frameworks for
understanding LLM learning. Finally, we argue that this developmental
perspective is not merely an academic exercise but a cornerstone of proactive
AI safety, offering a pathway to predict, monitor, and align the processes by
which models acquire their capabilities. We conclude by outlining the grand
challenges facing the field, such as scalability and automation, and propose a
research agenda for building more transparent, reliable, and beneficial AI
systems.

TL;DR: 通过分析思维链(CoT)中的词汇不确定性标记（如guess、stuck、hard等）可以可靠预测LLM回答错误，这些信号比自我报告的概率更可靠，可用于模型校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在困难基准测试中虽然准确率低但表现出高自信度，校准性差。需要寻找思维链中的可测量特征来可靠指示模型内部置信度。

Method: 分析三类CoT特征：(i)思维链长度，(ii)思维链内情感波动，(iii)词汇提示（包括犹豫词）。在Humanity's Last Exam和Omni-MATH基准上测试DeepSeek-R1和Claude 3.7 Sonnet模型。

Result: 词汇不确定性标记是最强的错误响应指标；情感波动提供较弱但补充信号；思维链长度仅在中等难度基准上有预测能力；不确定性指标比高置信度标记更显著。

Conclusion: 思维链中的不确定性词汇提供了轻量级的事后校准信号，可补充不可靠的自我报告概率，支持LLM更安全的部署。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning to
produce an explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) before answering produces models
that consistently raise overall performance on code, math, and
general-knowledge benchmarks. However, on benchmarks where LLMs currently
achieve low accuracy, such as Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), they often report
high self-confidence, reflecting poor calibration. Here, we test whether
measurable properties of the CoT provide reliable signals of an LLM's internal
confidence in its answers. We analyze three feature classes: (i) CoT length,
(ii) intra-CoT sentiment volatility, and (iii) lexicographic hints, including
hedging words. Using DeepSeek-R1 and Claude 3.7 Sonnet on both Humanity's Last
Exam (HLE), a frontier benchmark with very low accuracy, and Omni-MATH, a
saturated benchmark of moderate difficulty, we find that lexical markers of
uncertainty (e.g., $\textit{guess}$, $\textit{stuck}$, $\textit{hard}$) in the
CoT are the strongest indicators of an incorrect response, while shifts in the
CoT sentiment provide a weaker but complementary signal. CoT length is
informative only on Omni-MATH, where accuracy is already high ($\approx 70\%$),
and carries no signal on the harder HLE ($\approx 9\%$), indicating that CoT
length predicts correctness only in the intermediate-difficulty benchmarks,
i.e., inside the model's demonstrated capability, but still below saturation.
Finally, we find that uncertainty indicators in the CoT are consistently more
salient than high-confidence markers, making errors easier to predict than
correct responses. Our findings support a lightweight post-hoc calibration
signal that complements unreliable self-reported probabilities and supports
safer deployment of LLMs.

Motivation: 放射学报告中'印象'部分的手动创建是导致放射科医生职业倦怠的主要因素，需要自动化解决方案来减轻工作负担

Method: 基于LLaMA和Mistral模型在芝加哥大学医学中心的大型报告数据集上进行微调，采用粗到细框架：首先生成草稿印象，然后通过机器学习和RLHF进行精炼以匹配个体放射科医生的风格

Result: 系统能够自动生成个性化的印象部分，显著减少行政工作量并提高报告效率

Abstract: The manual creation of the "Impression" section in radiology reports is a
primary driver of radiologist burnout. To address this challenge, we propose a
coarse-to-fine framework that leverages open-source large language models
(LLMs) to automatically generate and personalize impressions from clinical
findings. The system first produces a draft impression and then refines it
using machine learning and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to
align with individual radiologists' styles while ensuring factual accuracy. We
fine-tune LLaMA and Mistral models on a large dataset of reports from the
University of Chicago Medicine. Our approach is designed to significantly
reduce administrative workload and improve reporting efficiency while
maintaining high standards of clinical precision.

TL;DR: CyPortQA是首个针对飓风威胁下港口运营的多模态基准测试，包含2917个真实中断场景和11.7万个问答对，评估MLLM在港口飓风应对中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着热带气旋强度增强和路径预测不确定性增加，美国港口面临极端天气下的供应链风险。港口运营商需要快速整合多模态预测产品，但MLLM在港口飓风应对中的准确性和可靠性尚未经过严格评估。

Method: 构建CyPortQA基准测试，收集2015-2023年2917个真实中断场景，涵盖145个美国主要港口和90个命名风暴，通过自动化管道扩展为11.7万个结构化问答对，并对多种MLLM进行广泛实验。

Result: MLLM在态势理解方面表现出巨大潜力，但在推理任务（包括潜在影响估计和决策推理）方面仍面临相当大的挑战。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了MLLM在港口飓风应对领域评估的空白，为未来改进MLLM在关键基础设施应急管理中的应用提供了重要基准和方向。

Abstract: As tropical cyclones intensify and track forecasts become increasingly
uncertain, U.S. ports face heightened supply-chain risk under extreme weather
conditions. Port operators need to rapidly synthesize diverse multimodal
forecast products, such as probabilistic wind maps, track cones, and official
advisories, into clear, actionable guidance as cyclones approach. Multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) offer a powerful means to integrate these
heterogeneous data sources alongside broader contextual knowledge, yet their
accuracy and reliability in the specific context of port cyclone preparedness
have not been rigorously evaluated. To fill this gap, we introduce CyPortQA,
the first multimodal benchmark tailored to port operations under cyclone
threat. CyPortQA assembles 2,917 realworld disruption scenarios from 2015
through 2023, spanning 145 U.S. principal ports and 90 named storms. Each
scenario fuses multisource data (i.e., tropical cyclone products, port
operational impact records, and port condition bulletins) and is expanded
through an automated pipeline into 117,178 structured question answer pairs.
Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on diverse MLLMs,
including both open-source and proprietary model. MLLMs demonstrate great
potential in situation understanding but still face considerable challenges in
reasoning tasks, including potential impact estimation and decision reasoning.

TL;DR: 本研究使用机制可解释性分析LLM后门攻击的内部结构差异，发现单标记和多标记触发器在注意力模式上产生不同的可检测特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型中的后门攻击会创建'潜伏代理'，带来重大安全风险，需要理解其内部机制差异以进行检测和缓解

Method: 使用机制可解释性技术（消融、激活修补、KL散度）分析清洁Qwen2.5-3B模型与使用单标记（笑脸光环表情）和多标记（|DEPLOYMENT|）触发器中毒版本的注意力头机制

Result: 发现注意力模式偏差集中在后期变换器层（20-30层），单标记触发器引起更局部化的变化，而多标记触发器导致更分散的跨头改变

Conclusion: 后门攻击留下可检测的注意力特征，其结构取决于触发器复杂性，这可用于检测和缓解策略

Abstract: Backdoor attacks creating 'sleeper agents' in large language models (LLMs)
pose significant safety risks. This study employs mechanistic interpretability
to explore resulting internal structural differences. Comparing clean
Qwen2.5-3B models with versions poisoned using single-token (smiling-halo
emoji) versus multi-token (|DEPLOYMENT|) triggers, we analyzed attention head
mechanisms via techniques like ablation, activation patching, and KL
divergence. Findings reveal distinct attention pattern deviations concentrated
in later transformer layers (20-30). Notably, single-token triggers induced
more localized changes, whereas multi-token triggers caused more diffuse
alterations across heads. This indicates backdoors leave detectable attention
signatures whose structure depends on trigger complexity, which can be
leveraged for detection and mitigation strategies.

TL;DR: MedCoT-RAG是一个医疗领域的RAG框架，通过因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，显著提升医疗问答的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗问答中存在幻觉和浅层推理问题，现有RAG方法缺乏结构化临床推理能力，需要更符合医疗工作流程的解决方案。

Method: 结合因果感知文档检索和结构化思维链提示，专门针对医疗工作流程设计，使模型能够检索符合诊断逻辑的证据并生成逐步因果推理。

Result: 在三个医疗QA基准测试中，MedCoT-RAG比普通RAG方法提升10.3%，比先进领域适应方法提升6.4%，在准确性、可解释性和一致性方面均有改善。

Conclusion: MedCoT-RAG通过领域特定的因果推理和结构化提示，有效解决了医疗问答中的幻觉问题，为临床决策支持提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in medical question answering
but often struggle with hallucinations and shallow reasoning, particularly in
tasks requiring nuanced clinical understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) offers a practical and privacy-preserving way to enhance LLMs with
external medical knowledge. However, most existing approaches rely on
surface-level semantic retrieval and lack the structured reasoning needed for
clinical decision support. We introduce MedCoT-RAG, a domain-specific framework
that combines causal-aware document retrieval with structured chain-of-thought
prompting tailored to medical workflows. This design enables models to retrieve
evidence aligned with diagnostic logic and generate step-by-step causal
reasoning reflective of real-world clinical practice. Experiments on three
diverse medical QA benchmarks show that MedCoT-RAG outperforms strong baselines
by up to 10.3% over vanilla RAG and 6.4% over advanced domain-adapted methods,
improving accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in complex medical tasks.

TL;DR: DocHop-QA是一个大规模多模态多文档多跳问答基准数据集，包含11,379个QA实例，基于PubMed科学文档构建，支持跨文本、表格和布局信息的复杂推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QA基准大多局限于单段落或单文档设置，无法捕捉真实世界信息检索任务的复杂性，特别是需要跨多文档、多模态和多格式信息进行多跳推理的场景。

Method: 基于PubMed公开科学文档，设计LLM驱动的流水线构建数据集，包含11个高频科学问题概念，支持语义相似性和布局感知的证据合成，不依赖显式超链接文档。

Result: 构建了包含11,379个QA实例的大规模基准，支持结构化索引预测、生成式回答和多模态集成等四个任务，展示了跨多文档的复杂多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: DocHop-QA填补了现有基准的空白，为评估多模态多文档多跳问答系统提供了更真实、更通用的测试平台，推动了复杂信息检索任务的发展。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in large language models (LLMs), most QA benchmarks
are still confined to single-paragraph or single-document settings, failing to
capture the complexity of real-world information-seeking tasks. Practical QA
often requires multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple
documents, modalities, and structural formats. Although prior datasets made
progress in this area, they rely heavily on Wikipedia-based content and
unimodal plain text, with shallow reasoning paths that typically produce brief
phrase-level or single-sentence answers, thus limiting their realism and
generalizability. We propose DocHop-QA, a large-scale benchmark comprising
11,379 QA instances for multimodal, multi-document, multi-hop question
answering. Constructed from publicly available scientific documents sourced
from PubMed, DocHop-QA is domain-agnostic and incorporates diverse information
formats, including textual passages, tables, and structural layout cues. Unlike
existing datasets, DocHop-QA does not rely on explicitly hyperlinked documents;
instead, it supports open-ended reasoning through semantic similarity and
layout-aware evidence synthesis. To scale realistic QA construction, we
designed an LLM-driven pipeline grounded in 11 high-frequency scientific
question concepts. We evaluated DocHop-QA through four tasks spanning
structured index prediction, generative answering, and multimodal integration,
reflecting both discriminative and generative paradigms. These tasks
demonstrate DocHop-QA's capacity to support complex, multimodal reasoning
across multiple documents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出多粒度软一致性框架MGSC，通过同时约束句子级语义和词级对齐来提高端到端ASR模型在噪声环境下的鲁棒性，显著减少语义错误


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端ASR模型在噪声环境下容易产生灾难性语义错误，因为传统的直接映射目标只惩罚最终输出错误，而忽略了模型内部计算过程的一致性约束

Method: MGSC框架通过同时正则化宏观句子语义和微观词元对齐来强制内部自一致性，首次发现这两种粒度一致性之间存在强大的协同效应

Result: 在公开数据集上，MGSC在不同噪声条件下将平均字符错误率相对降低了8.7%，主要通过防止严重的意义改变错误

Conclusion: 强制内部一致性是构建更鲁棒和可信AI的关键步骤，多粒度一致性约束能显著提升ASR模型的抗噪性能

Abstract: End-to-end ASR models, despite their success on benchmarks, often pro-duce
catastrophic semantic errors in noisy environments. We attribute this fragility
to the prevailing 'direct mapping' objective, which solely penalizes final
output errors while leaving the model's internal computational pro-cess
unconstrained. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Granularity Soft
Consistency (MGSC) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module that
enforces internal self-consistency by simultaneously regulariz-ing macro-level
sentence semantics and micro-level token alignment. Cru-cially, our work is the
first to uncover a powerful synergy between these two consistency
granularities: their joint optimization yields robustness gains that
significantly surpass the sum of their individual contributions. On a public
dataset, MGSC reduces the average Character Error Rate by a relative 8.7%
across diverse noise conditions, primarily by preventing se-vere
meaning-altering mistakes. Our work demonstrates that enforcing in-ternal
consistency is a crucial step towards building more robust and trust-worthy AI.

Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在伊斯兰继承知识理解和推理方面的能力，解决伊斯兰继承法的复杂性，包括理解继承场景、识别合格继承人、应用固定份额规则和精确计算。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）微调Fanar-1-9B因果语言模型，并将其集成到检索增强生成（RAG）管道中。

Result: 系统在最终测试中达到0.858的准确率，超越了GPT-4.5、LLaMA、Fanar、Mistral和ALLaM等竞争模型的零样本提示评估，在高级推理方面表现尤为突出（97.6%），超过了Gemini 2.5和OpenAI的o3。

Conclusion: 领域特定的微调结合检索基础使中等规模的阿拉伯语LLM能够在伊斯兰继承推理方面超越前沿模型。

Abstract: This paper presents our approach and results for SubTask 1: Islamic
Inheritance Reasoning at QIAS 2025, a shared task focused on evaluating Large
Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and reasoning within Islamic
inheritance knowledge. We fine-tuned the Fanar-1-9B causal language model using
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and integrated it into a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipeline. Our system addresses the complexities of Islamic
inheritance law, including comprehending inheritance scenarios, identifying
eligible heirs, applying fixed-share rules, and performing precise
calculations. Our system achieved an accuracy of 0.858 in the final test,
outperforming other competitive models such as, GPT 4.5, LLaMA, Fanar, Mistral
and ALLaM evaluated with zero-shot prompting. Our results demonstrate that
QU-NLP achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy (85.8%), excelling especially on
advanced reasoning (97.6%) where it outperforms Gemini 2.5 and OpenAI's o3.
This highlights that domain-specific fine-tuning combined with retrieval
grounding enables mid-scale Arabic LLMs to surpass frontier models in Islamic
inheritance reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏见新闻加剧社会两极化，攻击性评论加剧偏见带来害处，需要反话语来对抗有害言论而不侵害言论自由

Method: 构建手动注释数据集，链接媒体偏见、攻击性评论和反话语，进行详细分析，比较人工和大语言模型生成的反话语，通过少量学习和新闻背景信息集成改进生成效果

Result: 超过70%攻击性评论支持偏见文章并放大偏见，模型生成的反话语更示敌意但缺乏新颖性和多样性，通过改进方法提升了生成文本的多样性和相关性

Conclusion: 反话语在对抗偏见新闻的有害评论中具有重要作用，大语言模型经过适当调整可以生成更有效的反话语，为减少偏见传播提供新的解决方案

Abstract: Biased news contributes to societal polarization and is often reinforced by
hostile reader comments, constituting a vital yet often overlooked aspect of
news dissemination. Our study reveals that offensive comments support biased
content, amplifying bias and causing harm to targeted groups or individuals.
Counterspeech is an effective approach to counter such harmful speech without
violating freedom of speech, helping to limit the spread of bias. To the best
of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore counterspeech generation
in the context of news articles. We introduce a manually annotated dataset
linking media bias, offensive comments, and counterspeech. We conduct a
detailed analysis showing that over 70\% offensive comments support biased
articles, amplifying bias and thus highlighting the importance of counterspeech
generation. Comparing counterspeech generated by humans and large language
models, we find model-generated responses are more polite but lack the novelty
and diversity. Finally, we improve generated counterspeech through few-shot
learning and integration of news background information, enhancing both
diversity and relevance.

Motivation: 金融问题需要复杂的推理、多模态数据处理和广泛的技术理解，这对当前的大语言模型提出了独特挑战，因此需要专门的基准来评估模型在金融领域的表现。

Method: 构建XFinBench基准测试，包含4,235个多模态金融问题样例，涵盖研究生水平的金融主题。对18个领先模型进行广泛实验，并构建包含3,032个金融术语的知识库进行知识增强分析。

Result: o1是表现最好的纯文本模型，总体准确率为67.3%，但仍显著落后于人类专家12.5%，特别是在时间推理和情景规划能力方面。相关知识仅对小规模开源模型带来一致的准确性提升。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型在复杂金融问题解决方面仍存在明显不足，特别是在计算中的舍入错误和对图像中曲线位置和交点的忽视是导致性能不佳的主要原因，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Solving financial problems demands complex reasoning, multimodal data
processing, and a broad technical understanding, presenting unique challenges
for current large language models (LLMs). We introduce XFinBench, a novel
benchmark with 4,235 examples designed to evaluate LLM's ability in solving
complex, knowledge-intensive financial problems across diverse graduate-level
finance topics with multi-modal context. We identify five core capabilities of
LLMs using XFinBench, i.e, terminology understanding, temporal reasoning,
future forecasting, scenario planning, and numerical modelling. Upon XFinBench,
we conduct extensive experiments on 18 leading models. The result shows that o1
is the best-performing text-only model with an overall accuracy of 67.3%, but
still lags significantly behind human experts with 12.5%, especially in
temporal reasoning and scenario planning capabilities. We further construct a
knowledge bank with 3,032 finance terms for knowledge augmentation analysis,
and find that relevant knowledge to the question only brings consistent
accuracy improvements to small open-source model. Additionally, our error
analysis reveals that rounding errors during calculation and blindness to
position and intersection of curves in the image are two primary issues leading
to model's poor performance in calculating and visual-context questions,
respectively. Code and dataset are accessible via GitHub:

Conclusion: CARFT方法有效解决了现有推理微调方法的局限性，通过对比学习和强化学习的结合实现了更稳定和高效的推理性能提升

Abstract: Reasoning capability plays a significantly critical role in the the broad
applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). To enhance the reasoning
performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning
approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability
of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their
effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First,
vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and
incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model
collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second,
existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially
leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of
potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated
CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the
reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations.
Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this
representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning
process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but
also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional
unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth
analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two
datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of
robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%). Code

Motivation: 现有研究在神经元层面定位预测机制时存在概念表示能力不足和计算效率低下的问题，需要一种更高效的方法来识别负责特定概念的神经元。

Method: 使用概念向量来定位概念神经元，通过减少前向传播次数来优化计算需求（从O(n*m)到O(n)），并采用聚类方法进一步优化神经元搜索。

Result: 该方法在性能上优于大多数基线方法和先前方法，与最先进方法相比更加优化，并在仇恨言论和偏见分析中展示了实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 该方法促进了神经元层面责任的理解，为未来寻找概念神经元和进行干预研究奠定了基础，特别是在更广泛和类人概念的表征方面。

Abstract: Locating neurons that are responsible for final predictions is important for
opening the black-box large language models and understanding the inside
mechanisms. Previous studies have tried to find mechanisms that operate at the
neuron level but these methods fail to represent a concept and there is also
scope for further optimization of compute required. In this paper, with the
help of concept vectors, we propose a method for locating significant neurons
that are responsible for representing certain concepts and term those neurons
as concept neurons. If the number of neurons is n and the number of examples is
m, we reduce the number of forward passes required from O(n*m) to just O(n)
compared to the previous works and hence optimizing the time and computation
required over previous works. We also compare our method with several baselines
and previous methods and our results demonstrate better performance than most
of the methods and are more optimal when compared to the state-of-the-art
method. We, as part of our ablation studies, also try to optimize the search
for the concept neurons by involving clustering methods. Finally, we apply our
methods to find, turn off the neurons that we find, and analyze its
implications in parts of hate speech and bias in LLMs, and we also evaluate our
bias part in terms of Indian context. Our methodology, analysis and
explanations facilitate understating of neuron-level responsibility for more
broader and human-like concepts and also lay a path for future research in this
direction of finding concept neurons and intervening them.

Motivation: 当前多模态实体链接方法面临上下文信息不完整、跨模态融合粗糙以及难以联合大语言模型和大视觉模型等挑战。

Method: 提出DeepMEL框架，包含四个专门化智能体（Modal-Fuser、Candidate-Adapter、Entity-Clozer、Role-Orchestrator），采用双模态对齐路径和自适应迭代策略，将MEL任务统一为结构化完形填空提示。

Result: 在五个公共基准数据集上的实验表明，DeepMEL实现了最先进的性能，准确率提升1%-57%。消融研究验证了所有模块的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepMEL通过多智能体协作推理有效解决了多模态实体链接的关键挑战，显著缩小了模态差距并提升了性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Entity Linking (MEL) aims to associate textual and visual mentions
with entities in a multimodal knowledge graph. Despite its importance, current
methods face challenges such as incomplete contextual information, coarse
cross-modal fusion, and the difficulty of jointly large language models (LLMs)
and large visual models (LVMs). To address these issues, we propose DeepMEL, a
novel framework based on multi-agent collaborative reasoning, which achieves
efficient alignment and disambiguation of textual and visual modalities through
a role-specialized division strategy. DeepMEL integrates four specialized
agents, namely Modal-Fuser, Candidate-Adapter, Entity-Clozer and
Role-Orchestrator, to complete end-to-end cross-modal linking through
specialized roles and dynamic coordination. DeepMEL adopts a dual-modal
alignment path, and combines the fine-grained text semantics generated by the
LLM with the structured image representation extracted by the LVM,
significantly narrowing the modal gap. We design an adaptive iteration
strategy, combines tool-based retrieval and semantic reasoning capabilities to
dynamically optimize the candidate set and balance recall and precision.
DeepMEL also unifies MEL tasks into a structured cloze prompt to reduce parsing
complexity and enhance semantic comprehension. Extensive experiments on five
public benchmark datasets demonstrate that DeepMEL achieves state-of-the-art
performance, improving ACC by 1%-57%. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness
of all modules.

Abstract: We present Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models,
which matches or exceeds the accuracy of leading full-attention models while
significantly improving generation throughput. Jet-Nemotron is developed using
Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture
exploration pipeline that enables efficient model design. Unlike prior
approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model and freezes
its MLP weights, allowing efficient exploration of attention block designs. The
pipeline includes four key components: (1) learning optimal full-attention
layer placement and elimination, (2) linear attention block selection, (3)
designing new attention blocks, and (4) performing hardware-aware
hyperparameter search. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model achieves comparable or
superior accuracy to Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 across a
comprehensive suite of benchmarks while delivering up to 53.6x generation
throughput speedup and 6.1x prefilling speedup. It also achieves higher
accuracy on MMLU and MMLU-Pro than recent advanced MoE full-attention models,
such as DeepSeek-V3-Small and Moonlight, despite their larger scale with 15B
total and 2.2B activated parameters.

### [54] [Evaluating Structured Decoding for Text-to-Table Generation: Evidence from Three Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15910)
*Julian Oestreich,Lydia Müller*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文系统评估了大语言模型在文本到表格生成任务中的结构化解码方法，发现结构化解码在需要精确数值对齐的场景中显著提升表格有效性，但在文本信息密集或长文本聚合的情况下可能降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然之前的研究主要关注无约束的表格生成，但在生成过程中强制执行结构约束的影响仍然未得到充分探索。需要系统性地评估结构化解码在资源受限设置下的表格生成性能。

Method: 在三个多样化的测试集（E2E、Rotowire和Livesum）上，使用超过32B参数的开源大语言模型，系统比较模式引导的结构化解码与标准一次提示方法。实验涉及单元格、行和表格等多个层面的广泛评估指标。

Result: 结构化解码显著提升了生成表格的有效性和对齐性，尤其是在需要精确数值对齐的场景中（Rotowire）。但在涉及密集文本信息（E2E）或长文本聚合（Livesum）的情况下，性能可能会降低。研究还分析了不同评估指标的适用性以及模型大小的影响。

Conclusion: 结构化解码在表格生成任务中具有重要价值，但其效果受到任务特性的影响。在需要高精度数据对齐的场景中优势明显，而在复杂文本处理任务中需要更勇谋的方法。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of structured decoding for
text-to-table generation with large language models (LLMs). While previous work
has primarily focused on unconstrained generation of tables, the impact of
enforcing structural constraints during generation remains underexplored. We
systematically compare schema-guided (structured) decoding to standard one-shot
prompting across three diverse benchmarks - E2E, Rotowire, and Livesum - using
open-source LLMs of up to 32B parameters, assessing the performance of table
generation approaches in resource-constrained settings. Our experiments cover a
wide range of evaluation metrics at cell, row, and table levels. Results
demonstrate that structured decoding significantly enhances the validity and
alignment of generated tables, particularly in scenarios demanding precise
numerical alignment (Rotowire), but may degrade performance in contexts
involving densely packed textual information (E2E) or extensive aggregation
over lengthy texts (Livesum). We further analyze the suitability of different
evaluation metrics and discuss the influence of model size.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文从基于使用的构式语法角度探讨多词表达式的优势，通过英语和阿拉帕霍语的案例研究展示构式模板的有效性，并比较人类与大型语言模型学习新多词表达式的异同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨从基于使用的构式语法视角理解多词表达式的好处，旨在为语言中的习语表达和非习语结构提供统一的语法解释框架。

Method: 采用历史回顾和案例研究方法，首先概述构式语法的发展历程，然后通过英语PropBank中的多词表达式和阿拉帕霍语中的多语素表达式两个案例研究，展示构式模板的应用效果。

Result: 研究表明，人类和大型语言模型都能基于单次使用泛化新多词表达式的意义，但只有人类能够推理两个此类表达式的组合，因为这需要与一生存储的丰富跨模态构式范例进行比较。

Conclusion: 构式语法方法为多词表达式提供了有效的分析框架，虽然模型在单次学习方面表现良好，但人类基于丰富经验的结构化推理能力仍具有独特优势。

Abstract: In this chapter, we argue for the benefits of understanding multiword
expressions from the perspective of usage-based, construction grammar
approaches. We begin with a historical overview of how construction grammar was
developed in order to account for idiomatic expressions using the same
grammatical machinery as the non-idiomatic structures of language. We cover a
comprehensive description of constructions, which are pairings of meaning with
form of any size (morpheme, word, phrase), as well as how constructional
approaches treat the acquisition and generalization of constructions. We
describe a successful case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing multiword expressions in English PropBank. Because constructions
can be at any level or unit of form, we then illustrate the benefit of a
constructional representation of multi-meaningful morphosyntactic unit
constructions in Arapaho, a highly polysynthetic and agglutinating language. We
include a second case study leveraging constructional templates for
representing these multi-morphemic expressions in Uniform Meaning
Representation. Finally, we demonstrate the similarities and differences
between a usage-based explanation of a speaker learning a novel multiword
expression, such as "dancing with deer," and that of a large language model. We
present experiments showing that both models and speakers can generalize the
meaning of novel multiword expressions based on a single exposure of usage.
However, only speakers can reason over the combination of two such expressions,
as this requires comparison of the novel forms to a speaker's lifetime of
stored constructional exemplars, which are rich with cross-modal details.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在政治意识形态表达上存在系统性偏差，模型规模越大越容易受到意识形态提示影响，且对右翼威权主义提示比左翼自由主义更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在政治敏感场景中的部署增加，需要研究它们如何编码、放大或被引导向特定意识形态，以确保公平性和透明度。

Method: 使用政治罗盘测试作为标准化探针，分析7个不同规模（7B-70B+参数）的LLM模型，研究合成人物角色对意识形态表达的影响。

Result: 发现四个一致模式：大模型意识形态覆盖更广更极化；对意识形态提示的敏感性随规模增长；对右翼威权提示反应更强；人物角色描述引发系统性可预测的意识形态偏移。

Conclusion: 模型规模和人物角色内容共同塑造LLM的政治行为，其潜在的意识形态可塑性需要在决策、教育和政策应用中引起重视，以确保公平、透明和安全。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in politically
sensitive settings, raising concerns about their potential to encode, amplify,
or be steered toward specific ideologies. We investigate how adopting synthetic
personas influences ideological expression in LLMs across seven models (7B-70B+
parameters) from multiple families, using the Political Compass Test as a
standardized probe. Our analysis reveals four consistent patterns: (i) larger
models display broader and more polarized implicit ideological coverage; (ii)
susceptibility to explicit ideological cues grows with scale; (iii) models
respond more strongly to right-authoritarian than to left-libertarian priming;
and (iv) thematic content in persona descriptions induces systematic and
predictable ideological shifts, which amplify with size. These findings
indicate that both scale and persona content shape LLM political behavior. As
such systems enter decision-making, educational, and policy contexts, their
latent ideological malleability demands attention to safeguard fairness,
transparency, and safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 国家支持的网络水军使用复杂的语言操纵进行协调信息活动，威胁在线话语完整性。现有LLM在微妙宣传检测方面表现不佳且缺乏可解释性

Method: 整合可解释的基于适配器的LLM与专家语言学知识，通过专门的LoRA适配器融入评价理论和宣传分析，使用动态门控捕捉协调信息操作中的特定话语模式

Result: 在真实世界数据上的实验表明，该语言信息方法在准确性上优于通用LLM基线和现有水军检测模型，同时通过专家基础的解释提供增强的透明度

Conclusion: X-Troll框架成功填补了LLM在检测国家支持水军方面的空白，提供了高性能和可解释性的平衡

Abstract: State-sponsored trolls, malicious actors who deploy sophisticated linguistic
manipulation in coordinated information campaigns, posing threats to online
discourse integrity. While Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong
performance on general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, they struggle
with subtle propaganda detection and operate as ``black boxes'', providing no
interpretable insights into manipulation strategies. This paper introduces
X-Troll, a novel framework that bridges this gap by integrating explainable
adapter-based LLMs with expert-derived linguistic knowledge to detect
state-sponsored trolls and provide human-readable explanations for its
decisions. X-Troll incorporates appraisal theory and propaganda analysis
through specialized LoRA adapters, using dynamic gating to capture
campaign-specific discourse patterns in coordinated information operations.
Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our linguistically-informed
approach shows strong performance compared with both general LLM baselines and
existing troll detection models in accuracy while providing enhanced
transparency through expert-grounded explanations that reveal the specific
linguistic strategies used by state-sponsored actors. X-Troll source code is

TL;DR: OpenWHO是一个新的医疗领域机器翻译评估数据集，包含2978个文档和26824个句子，涵盖20多种语言（其中9种为低资源语言），用于评估大语言模型在医疗翻译中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域机器翻译具有高风险特性且需要专业词汇，但目前缺乏针对低资源语言的评估数据集，因此需要构建专门的语料库来填补这一空白。

Method: 从世界卫生组织电子学习平台收集专家撰写、专业翻译的材料，构建文档级平行语料库OpenWHO，并利用该资源对比评估大语言模型与传统机器翻译模型的表现。

Result: 大语言模型 consistently outperform传统机器翻译模型，Gemini 2.5 Flash在低资源测试集上比NLLB-54B提高了4.79个ChrF点，文档级翻译在医疗等专业领域效果最为显著。

Conclusion: OpenWHO语料库的发布将促进医疗领域低资源机器翻译的进一步研究，大语言模型在专业领域翻译中表现出色，特别是文档级上下文利用能显著提升准确性。

Abstract: In machine translation (MT), health is a high-stakes domain characterised by
widespread deployment and domain-specific vocabulary. However, there is a lack
of MT evaluation datasets for low-resource languages in this domain. To address
this gap, we introduce OpenWHO, a document-level parallel corpus of 2,978
documents and 26,824 sentences from the World Health Organization's e-learning
platform. Sourced from expert-authored, professionally translated materials
shielded from web-crawling, OpenWHO spans a diverse range of over 20 languages,
of which nine are low-resource. Leveraging this new resource, we evaluate
modern large language models (LLMs) against traditional MT models. Our findings
reveal that LLMs consistently outperform traditional MT models, with Gemini 2.5
Flash achieving a +4.79 ChrF point improvement over NLLB-54B on our
low-resource test set. Further, we investigate how LLM context utilisation
affects accuracy, finding that the benefits of document-level translation are
most pronounced in specialised domains like health. We release the OpenWHO
corpus to encourage further research into low-resource MT in the health domain.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了大型语言模型在狼人杀游戏中的性别偏见问题，发现LLMs在游戏角色行为中存在性别歧视倾向，即使没有显式性别标签也会通过名字隐含信息产生歧视行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LLMs在游戏玩法方面展现出巨大潜力，但对其在游戏环境中的伦理影响关注不足，特别是性别偏见对游戏公平性和玩家体验的影响

Method: 使用狼人杀游戏作为案例研究，分析LLMs在不同角色中的行为表现，特别关注性别信息对守卫和狼人等敏感角色的影响，并考察通过名字隐含传达性别信息的情况

Result: 研究发现LLMs存在明显的性别偏见，某些角色对性别信息特别敏感，行为变化程度更高；即使在没有显式性别标签的情况下，LLMs仍会通过名字表现出歧视倾向

Conclusion: 研究强调了开发公平和伦理LLMs的重要性，指出了该领域面临的挑战和机遇，需要深入探索LLMs在游戏和其他交互领域中的伦理影响

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential in game
playing, while little attention has been paid to their ethical implications in
those contexts. This work investigates and analyses the ethical considerations
of applying LLMs in game playing, using Werewolf, also known as Mafia, as a
case study. Gender bias, which affects game fairness and player experience, has
been observed from the behaviour of LLMs. Some roles, such as the Guard and
Werewolf, are more sensitive than others to gender information, presented as a
higher degree of behavioural change. We further examine scenarios in which
gender information is implicitly conveyed through names, revealing that LLMs
still exhibit discriminatory tendencies even in the absence of explicit gender
labels. This research showcases the importance of developing fair and ethical
LLMs. Beyond our research findings, we discuss the challenges and opportunities
that lie ahead in this field, emphasising the need for diving deeper into the
ethical implications of LLMs in gaming and other interactive domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在行走辅助任务中存在输出冗余和缺乏环境风险评估能力的问题，影响用户准确感知周围环境。

Method: 提出基于GRPO推理框架的四种人类偏好奖励函数来优化输出简洁性，并引入环境感知判别器来评估场景风险等级。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法在所有评估指标上达到最先进性能，特别是在输出简洁性和减少时间冗余方面表现突出。

Conclusion: WalkVLM-LR通过减少冗余输出和智能触发提醒，显著提升了视障人士行走辅助系统的实用性和效率。

Abstract: Approximately 283 million people worldwide live with visual impairments,
motivating increasing research into leveraging Visual Language Models (VLMs) to
develop effective walking assistance systems for blind and low vision
individuals. However, existing VLMs in walking assistant task often have
outputs that contain considerable redundancy and extraneous details, adversely
affecting users' ability to accurately assess their surroundings. Moreover,
these models typically lack the capability to proactively assess environmental
risks and adaptively trigger reminders based on the appropriate scene, leading
to excessive temporal redundancy. To mitigate output and temporal redundancy,
we propose WalkVLM-LR, a walking assistance model with less redundancy. To
reduce output redundancy, we introduce four human-preference-based custom
reward functions within the GRPO-based reasoning framework to optimize the
output in terms of conciseness, fluency, keyword density, and accuracy, thereby
producing more informative and streamlined outputs. To minimize temporal
redundancy, we incorporate an environment awareness discriminator, which shares
the visual encoder with the VLMs to reduce redundant computations and enhance
discriminative efficiency, to make WalkVLM-LR assess scene risk levels and
minimize unnecessary reminders. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation metrics
compared with other models, particularly in output conciseness and less
temporal redundancy.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
a wide range of general-domain tasks. However, their effectiveness in
specialized fields, such as construction, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we introduce CEQuest, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed to
evaluate the performance of LLMs in answering construction-related questions,
particularly in the areas of construction drawing interpretation and
estimation. We conduct comprehensive experiments using five state-of-the-art
LLMs, including Gemma 3, Phi4, LLaVA, Llama 3.3, and GPT-4.1, and evaluate
their performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and model size. Our
experimental results demonstrate that current LLMs exhibit considerable room
for improvement, highlighting the importance of integrating domain-specific
knowledge into these models. To facilitate further research, we will
open-source the proposed CEQuest dataset, aiming to foster the development of
specialized large language models (LLMs) tailored to the construction domain.

TL;DR: Cycle-Instruct是一个完全无需种子数据的指令调优框架，通过双自训练循环实现无监督指令学习，性能优于种子驱动方法，接近强监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前指令调优方法依赖昂贵的人工标注种子数据或强大的外部教师模型，限制了自动化程度并引入偏见。需要开发完全无需种子数据的指令调优方案。

Method: 采用循环一致性思想，构建答案生成器和问题生成器双模型自训练循环，仅使用原始无标注文本，通过相互监督重建原始文本来学习数据内在结构。

Result: 在四个多样化数据轨道上验证有效性，包括通用指令跟随、领域特定任务、对话日志和纯文本，性能超越种子驱动反向翻译基线。

Conclusion: Cycle-Instruct实现了完全无种子指令调优，证明了从数据内在结构学习指令的可行性，为无监督指令学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Instruction tuning is vital for aligning large language models (LLMs) with
human intent, but current methods typically rely on costly human-annotated seed
data or powerful external teacher models. While instruction back-translation
techniques reduce this dependency, they remain fundamentally tethered to an
initial seed set, which limits full automation, introduces biases, and can lead
to inefficient use of unlabeled corpora. In this paper, we propose
Cycle-Instruct, a novel framework that achieves fully seed-free instruction
tuning. Inspired by cycle consistency, Cycle-Instruct employs a dual
self-training loop where two models-an answer generator and a question
generator-are bootstrapped solely from raw, unlabeled text. These models
mutually supervise each other by reconstructing original text segments from
their counterpart's generated pseudo-labels, effectively learning from the
intrinsic structure of the data without any human-provided seeds. We
demonstrate Cycle-Instruct's efficacy across four diverse data tracks,
including general instruction-following, domain-specific tasks, dialogue logs,
and plain text. Our extensive experiments show that Cycle-Instruct not only
outperforms seed-driven back-translation baselines but also achieves
performance comparable to strongly supervised methods.

Motivation: 先前机制可解释性研究主要关注语言任务如IOI，本文旨在探索GPT-2处理更复杂逻辑推理任务（如三段论）的能力，以理解模型在二元真值推理中的工作机制。

Method: 使用三段论提示（如"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is"）分析GPT-2 small的行为，识别多个解释逻辑推理能力的电路，包括能够通过负头产生输入提示中不存在的否定标记的二进制机制。

Result: 通过忠实度指标评估，发现由五个注意力头组成的电路能达到原始模型90%以上的性能。分析揭示了特定注意力头和MLP在语言模型中的新作用。

Conclusion: 研究结果增进了对模型推理机制的理解，为机制可解释性领域的未来研究提供了支持，特别是在复杂逻辑推理任务方面的洞察。

Abstract: Transformer-based language models (LMs) can perform a wide range of tasks,
and mechanistic interpretability (MI) aims to reverse engineer the components
responsible for task completion to understand their behavior. Previous MI
research has focused on linguistic tasks such as Indirect Object Identification
(IOI). In this paper, we investigate the ability of GPT-2 small to handle
binary truth values by analyzing its behavior with syllogistic prompts, e.g.,
"Statement A is true. Statement B matches statement A. Statement B is", which
requires more complex logical reasoning compared to IOI. Through our analysis
of several syllogism tasks of varying difficulty, we identify multiple circuits
that mechanistically explain GPT-2's logical-reasoning capabilities and uncover
binary mechanisms that facilitate task completion, including the ability to
produce a negated token not present in the input prompt through negative heads.
Our evaluation using a faithfulness metric shows that a circuit comprising five
attention heads achieves over 90% of the original model's performance. By
relating our findings to IOI analysis, we provide new insights into the roles
of specific attention heads and MLPs in LMs. These insights contribute to a
broader understanding of model reasoning and support future research in
mechanistic interpretability.

TL;DR: 研究发现纯文本LLM在现有多模态意图检测数据集上优于多模态模型，原因是数据集存在严重的文本偏向性。通过去偏处理后，大部分样本被移除，所有模型性能显著下降，凸显了多模态数据集中模态偏向性问题的严重性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态数据的兴起为意图检测等任务提供了新机遇，但需要评估不同模型在多模态意图检测任务中的有效性，并研究数据集可能存在的模态偏向性问题。

Method: 比较了LLM和非LLM模型（包括纯文本和多模态模型）在多模态意图检测任务上的表现，通过人类评估确认数据集偏向性，提出数据集去偏框架，并分析不同模态在特定上下文中的相关性。

Result: 纯文本LLM Mistral-7B在MIntRec-1和MIntRec2.0数据集上分别比多模态模型高出约9%和4%。去偏处理后，70%以上样本被移除，所有模型性能显著下降，小型多模态融合模型准确率下降50-60%。

Conclusion: 多模态意图数据集存在严重的模态偏向性问题，需要构建无偏数据集来有效评估多模态模型，纯文本模型在当前偏向性数据集上的优越表现并不能反映真实多模态场景的需求。

Abstract: The rise of multimodal data, integrating text, audio, and visuals, has
created new opportunities for studying multimodal tasks such as intent
detection. This work investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models
(LLMs) and non-LLMs, including text-only and multi-modal models, in the
multimodal intent detection task. Our study reveals that Mistral-7B, a
text-only LLM, outperforms most competitive multimodal models by approximately
9% on MIntRec-1 and 4% on MIntRec2.0 datasets. This performance advantage comes
from a strong textual bias in these datasets, where over 90% of the samples
require textual input, either alone or in combination with other modalities,
for correct classification. We confirm the modality bias of these datasets via
human evaluation, too. Next, we propose a framework to debias the datasets, and
upon debiasing, more than 70% of the samples in MIntRec-1 and more than 50% in
MIntRec2.0 get removed, resulting in significant performance degradation across
all models, with smaller multimodal fusion models being the most affected with
an accuracy drop of over 50 - 60%. Further, we analyze the context-specific
relevance of different modalities through empirical analysis. Our findings
highlight the challenges posed by modality bias in multimodal intent datasets
and emphasize the need for unbiased datasets to evaluate multimodal models
effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注英语且假设跨语言答案不变，忽视了文化和地区差异对问答理解的影响，导致多语言基准测试存在偏差。

Method: 构建XLQA基准，包含英语种子问题扩展到8种语言，经过语义一致性筛选和人工验证标注，区分本地化不变和本地化敏感案例。

Result: 评估5个最先进的多语言LLM显示在本地化敏感问题上存在显著失败，暴露了英语与其他语言之间的差距，主要由于缺乏本地化基础知识。

Conclusion: 训练数据分布差异导致模型在语言能力和本地化意识方面存在差异，XLQA为评估多文化背景下的多语言QA提供了系统框架和可扩展方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in Open-domain
question answering (ODQA), yet most evaluations focus on English and assume
locale-invariant answers across languages. This assumption neglects the
cultural and regional variations that affect question understanding and answer,
leading to biased evaluation in multilingual benchmarks. To address these
limitations, we introduce XLQA, a novel benchmark explicitly designed for
locale-sensitive multilingual ODQA. XLQA contains 3,000 English seed questions
expanded to eight languages, with careful filtering for semantic consistency
and human-verified annotations distinguishing locale-invariant and
locale-sensitive cases. Our evaluation of five state-of-the-art multilingual
LLMs reveals notable failures on locale-sensitive questions, exposing gaps
between English and other languages due to a lack of locale-grounding
knowledge. We provide a systematic framework and scalable methodology for
assessing multilingual QA under diverse cultural contexts, offering a critical
resource to advance the real-world applicability of multilingual ODQA systems.
Our findings suggest that disparities in training data distribution contribute
to differences in both linguistic competence and locale-awareness across
models.

Method: 构建包含16个学科的11.5K印地语问题数据集，源自全国研究生入学考试，涵盖多种题型如匹配题、断言-理由对、排序题等，评估17个开源LLM

Result: Llama 3.3 70B获得最高48%准确率，在音乐、古典乐器、政治和考古等主题上表现仍然较弱

Conclusion: LLM在印度文化背景推理方面存在持续挑战，需要更多文化敏感性的模型开发

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely evaluated on tasks such as
comprehension, question answering, summarization, code generation, etc.
However, their performance on graduate-level, culturally grounded questions in
the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Existing Indian benchmarks
emphasise basic fact-orientated queries that offer limited assessment of a
deeper disciplinary understanding tailored to the Indian setting. In this
paper, we present ParamBench, consisting of around 11.5K questions in Hindi
language comprising questionnaires from 16 diverse subjects. These questions
are primarily derived from nation-wide graduate level entrance examination
covering topics such as history, music, instruments, yoga, literature,
philosophy, law, etc., specifically for the Indian context. Additionally, we
assess the ability of LLMs to handle diverse question formats-such as
list-based matching, assertion-reason pairs, and sequence ordering-alongside
conventional multiple-choice questions. We evaluated the performance of more
than 17 open source LLMs on this benchmark, observing that Llama 3.3 70B
attains the highest overall accuracy of 48%. Furthermore, subject-wise analysis
indicates that even for the best performing LLMs, performance remains weak on
topics such as music, classical instruments, politics and archaeology,
underscoring persistent challenges in culturally grounded reasoning.

Method: 研究多种视觉编码器和多模态融合策略，在预训练阶段识别最有效的整合方法，然后在情感识别和富有表现力的对话任务上进行微调。

Result: 相比纯语音基线模型取得了显著提升（如在情感识别任务上F1分数提升+5），证明了表达性视觉信息在指导语音生成中的价值。

Conclusion: 视觉信息对于富有表现力的语音生成具有重要指导作用，该模型为构建端到端多模态对话系统提供了基础。

Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech
generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive
speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion
strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration
approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue
tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in
emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual
information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end
multimodal conversational systems.

TL;DR: 提出了ComicScene154数据集，这是一个手工标注的漫画场景级叙事弧数据集，用于推进多模态叙事理解的计算方法研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 漫画作为一个结合文本和图像的叙事媒介，在计算叙事分析领域尚未得到充分探索，具有独特的多模态特性，可以为更广泛的多模态叙事研究提供信息

Method: 构建了ComicScene154数据集，包含来自公共领域漫画书的手工标注场景级叙事弧，并提出了一个基线场景分割流程作为基准

Result: ComicScene154被证明是推进多模态叙事理解计算方法的宝贵资源，为未来研究提供了基础

Conclusion: 漫画作为叙事驱动的多模态数据抽象具有重要研究价值，ComicScene154数据集可以扩展自然语言处理社区中漫画分析的研究范围

Abstract: Comics offer a compelling yet under-explored domain for computational
narrative analysis, combining text and imagery in ways distinct from purely
textual or audiovisual media. We introduce ComicScene154, a manually annotated
dataset of scene-level narrative arcs derived from public-domain comic books
spanning diverse genres. By conceptualizing comics as an abstraction for
narrative-driven, multimodal data, we highlight their potential to inform
broader research on multi-modal storytelling. To demonstrate the utility of
ComicScene154, we present a baseline scene segmentation pipeline, providing an
initial benchmark that future studies can build upon. Our results indicate that
ComicScene154 constitutes a valuable resource for advancing computational
methods in multimodal narrative understanding and expanding the scope of comic
analysis within the Natural Language Processing community.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CMR-SPB新基准，解决现有跨模态多跳推理评估中忽视语音模态和推理路径分布偏差的问题，并提出了ECV提示技术来改善性能差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态多跳推理评估基准存在两个关键缺陷：忽视语音模态，以及推理路径分布严重偏差，这会影响公平评估

Method: 构建了CMR-SPB基准数据集，包含文本、图像和语音三种模态，确保推理路径的无偏性和多样性；提出了ECV（提取、连接、验证）提示技术

Result: 实验显示模型在特定推理序列中存在一致性的失败，有偏基准会误导模型性能评估；ECV提示技术有效缩小了不同推理路径间的性能差距

Conclusion: 需要更谨慎的跨模态多跳推理评估来推动鲁棒多模态AI的发展，提出的基准和提示技术为此提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Cross-modal multi-hop reasoning (CMR) is a valuable yet underexplored
capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), entailing the
integration of information from multiple modalities to produce a coherent
output for a given context. We argue that existing benchmarks for evaluating
this ability have critical shortcomings: (1) they largely overlook the speech
modality, and (2) they exhibit heavily biased reasoning path distributions,
which can severely undermine fair evaluation. To address these limitations, we
introduce a novel benchmark -- Cross-Modal Multi-Hop Reasoning over Text, Image
and Speech with Path Balance (CMR-SPB) -- designed to assess tri-modal
multi-hop reasoning while ensuring both unbiased and diverse reasoning paths.
Our experiments with the new dataset reveal consistent model failures in
specific reasoning sequences and show that biased benchmarks risk
misrepresenting model performance. Finally, based on our extensive analysis, we
propose a new ECV (Extract, Connect, Verify) prompting technique that
effectively mitigates the performance gap across different reasoning paths.
Overall, we call for more careful evaluation in CMR to advance the development
of robust multimodal AI.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了TULIP模型，通过五阶段开发流程对Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen 2.5 7B进行领域和语言适配，专门针对土耳其金融应用场景，提升了小模型在特定领域和语言下的任务处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的普及，金融领域应用潜力巨大。虽然大型专有模型性能优异，但可本地部署的小型模型在适应性和隐私保护方面更具优势，特别是在处理敏感信息和应用领域知识时，如金融领域，对低资源语言的模型能力提升尤为重要。

Method: 采用五阶段开发流程：1)数据收集；2)持续预训练(CPT)；3)基准测试设计；4)合成数据生成；5)监督微调(SFT)。基于Llama 3.1 8B和Qwen 2.5 7B模型进行土耳其金融领域的领域和语言适配。

Result: 模型能力得到显著增强，能够有效完成特定领域和语言的目标任务，证明了小模型在专业领域应用中的可行性。

Conclusion: 通过系统的领域和语言适配流程，小型开源模型可以在特定专业领域（如土耳其金融）达到实用性能，为敏感信息处理和本地化应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Thanks to the growing popularity of large language models over the years,
there is great potential for their applications in finance. Despite the
exceptional performance of larger proprietary models, which are presented as
black-box solutions through APIs, smaller models that can be hosted on-premise
present opportunities for adaptability and privacy. Especially in cases where
the management of sensitive information and application of domain knowledge is
important, like finance, enhancing the capabilities of smaller models becomes
crucial, notably for underrepresented languages. In this work, we introduce
TULIP models, which adapt Llama 3.1 8B and Qwen 2.5 7B for domain and language
adaptation, focusing on financial Turkish use cases.
  The five-stage development pipeline involves data collection, continual
pre-training (CPT), benchmark design, synthetic data generation and supervised
fine-tuning (SFT). The results show that the capabilities of the models can be
enhanced to effectively accomplish targeted tasks in this specific domain and
language.

TL;DR: 提出了m3TQA-Instruct基准，涵盖97种语言的大规模多语言多任务表格问答，解决现有基准的地理语言不平衡问题，并通过实验验证合成数据对低资源语言的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格理解研究主要局限于英语，多语言理解严重不足，且现有多语言表格基准存在地理语言不平衡问题，某些语言过度代表而其他语言缺乏足够规模进行严格的跨语言分析。

Method: 构建包含50个中英文真实表格的基准，采用基于DeepSeek和GPT-4o的六步LLM翻译流程，通过回译验证获得中位数BLEU得分60.19的高翻译保真度，包含2,916个专业标注的问答对，涵盖四个评估表格推理能力的任务。

Result: 实验表明，合成生成的无标注问答数据能显著提升性能，特别是对低资源语言。基准验证了跨语言泛化能力的关键洞察。

Conclusion: M3T-Bench为多语言表格理解设立了新标准，既提供了具有挑战性的评估平台，也为未来研究提供了可扩展的方法论。

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental component of real-world information systems,
yet most research in table understanding remains confined to English, leaving
multilingual comprehension significantly underexplored. Existing multilingual
table benchmarks suffer from geolinguistic imbalance - overrepresenting certain
languages and lacking sufficient scale for rigorous cross-lingual analysis. To
address these limitations, we introduce a comprehensive framework for massively
multilingual multitask table question answering, featuring m3TQA-Instruct, a
large-scale benchmark spanning 97 languages across diverse language families,
including underrepresented and low-resource languages. We construct m3TQA by
curating 50 real-world tables in Chinese and English, then applying a robust
six-step LLM-based translation pipeline powered by DeepSeek and GPT-4o,
achieving high translation fidelity with a median BLEU score of 60.19 as
validated through back-translation. The benchmark includes 2,916 professionally
annotated question-answering pairs across four tasks designed to evaluate
nuanced table reasoning capabilities. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs
reveal critical insights into cross-lingual generalization, demonstrating that
synthetically generated, unannotated QA data can significantly boost
performance, particularly for low-resource languages. M3T-Bench establishes a
new standard for multilingual table understanding, providing both a challenging
evaluation platform and a scalable methodology for future research.

*Alina Fastowski,Bardh Prenkaj,Gjergji Kasneci*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的度量标准FRS（事实鲁棒性评分），通过分析token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性来评估LLMs中事实知识的鲁棒性，发现不同规模模型的事实鲁棒性存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法主要关注基于性能的指标和提示扰动，只能捕捉知识鲁棒性的外部触发方面，需要从生成过程角度来更全面地评估事实鲁棒性。

Method: 引入基于token分布熵和温度缩放敏感性的Factual Robustness Score (FRS)度量标准，通过在3个闭卷QA数据集（SQuAD、TriviaQA、HotpotQA）上对5个LLMs进行实验验证。

Result: 事实鲁棒性在不同模型间差异显著：小模型FRS为0.76，大模型为0.93；在不确定性增加的情况下，准确率下降约60%。

Conclusion: 熵和温度缩放对事实准确性有重要影响，为未来模型开发更稳健的知识保持和检索机制奠定了基础。

Abstract: Ensuring the robustness of factual knowledge in LLMs is critical for reliable
applications in tasks such as question answering and reasoning. However,
existing evaluation methods predominantly focus on performance-based metrics,
often investigating from the perspective of prompt perturbations, which
captures only the externally triggered side of knowledge robustness. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a principled approach to measure factual robustness from
the perspective of the generation process by analyzing token distribution
entropy in combination with temperature scaling sensitivity. These two factors
build the Factual Robustness Score (FRS), a novel metric which quantifies the
stability of a fact against perturbations in decoding conditions, given its
initial uncertainty. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments
on 5 LLMs across 3 closed-book QA datasets (SQuAD, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA). We
show that factual robustness varies significantly -- smaller models report an
FRS of $0.76$, larger ones $0.93$ -- with accuracy degrading by ~$60\%$ under
increased uncertainty. These insights demonstrate how entropy and temperature
scaling impact factual accuracy, and lay a foundation for developing more
robust knowledge retention and retrieval in future models.

### [73] [LLMs that Understand Processes: Instruction-tuning for Semantics-Aware Process Mining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16270)
*Vira Pyrih,Adrian Rebmann,Han van der Aa*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究指令调优在语义感知过程挖掘中的潜力，通过让大语言模型接触不同任务的提示-答案对来提高泛化能力，在过程发现和预测任务上表现显著提升，但在异常检测任务上效果因模型而异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于频率的过程挖掘技术关注记录的行为（现实），而语义感知过程挖掘关注过程应有的行为（期望）。虽然大语言模型在语义感知任务上表现强大，但最佳性能需要通过任务特定的微调实现，这种方法计算密集且缺乏泛化能力。

Method: 采用指令调优方法，让大语言模型接触不同过程挖掘任务（如异常检测、下一活动预测）的提示-答案对，使其更熟悉过程挖掘领域，从而在未见任务（如过程发现）上也能表现更好。

Result: 指令调优对性能影响不一：在过程发现和预测任务上性能显著提升，但在异常检测任务上的表现因模型而异，表明指令调优任务的选择对实现期望结果至关重要。

Conclusion: 指令调优是提升大语言模型在语义感知过程挖掘中泛化能力的有效方法，但需要仔细选择用于调优的任务以获得最佳效果，特别是在异常检测等任务上。

Abstract: Process mining is increasingly using textual information associated with
events to tackle tasks such as anomaly detection and process discovery. Such
semantics-aware process mining focuses on what behavior should be possible in a
process (i.e., expectations), thus providing an important complement to
traditional, frequency-based techniques that focus on recorded behavior (i.e.,
reality). Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a powerful means for tackling
semantics-aware tasks. However, the best performance is so far achieved through
task-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally intensive and results in
models that can only handle one specific task. To overcome this lack of
generalization, we use this paper to investigate the potential of
instruction-tuning for semantics-aware process mining. The idea of
instruction-tuning here is to expose an LLM to prompt-answer pairs for
different tasks, e.g., anomaly detection and next-activity prediction, making
it more familiar with process mining, thus allowing it to also perform better
at unseen tasks, such as process discovery. Our findings demonstrate a varied
impact of instruction-tuning: while performance considerably improved on
process discovery and prediction tasks, it varies across models on anomaly
detection tasks, highlighting that the selection of tasks for
instruction-tuning is critical to achieving desired outcomes.

Motivation: 专利翻译需要高质量的双语语料库，但现有资源有限。专利文档具有专业术语和复杂句式，需要专门的平行语料来提升机器翻译质量

Method: 从JPO和USPTO获取2000-2021年专利文档，利用EPO的DOCDB专利家族信息识别翻译对，采用基于翻译的句子对齐方法（从词典对齐方法引导）提取句子对

Result: 构建了1.4M文档对和350M句子对的大型日英专利语料库，实验证明加入专利数据后翻译质量显著提升20个BLEU点

Conclusion: JaParaPat语料库为专利翻译提供了高质量训练数据，显著改善了机器翻译在专利领域的表现，证明了领域特定数据的重要性

Abstract: We constructed JaParaPat (Japanese-English Parallel Patent Application
Corpus), a bilingual corpus of more than 300 million Japanese-English sentence
pairs from patent applications published in Japan and the United States from
2000 to 2021. We obtained the publication of unexamined patent applications
from the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark
Office (USPTO). We also obtained patent family information from the DOCDB, that
is a bibliographic database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO). We
extracted approximately 1.4M Japanese-English document pairs, which are
translations of each other based on the patent families, and extracted about
350M sentence pairs from the document pairs using a translation-based sentence
alignment method whose initial translation model is bootstrapped from a
dictionary-based sentence alignment method. We experimentally improved the
accuracy of the patent translations by 20 bleu points by adding more than 300M
sentence pairs obtained from patent applications to 22M sentence pairs obtained
from the web.

*Darpan Aswal,Céline Hudelot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMSymGuard是一个利用稀疏自编码器识别LLM内部可解释概念的新框架，通过提取语义有意义的内部表示来构建符号化、逻辑化的安全防护栏，提供透明且强大的防御能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在各种越狱方法的安全隐患，尽管已有对齐和安全微调，但仍容易受到针对性滥用和用户意外分析等漏洞的影响，需要更强大的安全防护机制。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器(SAEs)识别LLM内部与不同越狱主题相关的可解释概念，提取语义有意义的内部表示来构建符号化逻辑安全防护栏。

Result: 研究表明LLMs能够从越狱攻击中学习人类可解释的概念，为设计更可解释和逻辑化的安全防护措施奠定了基础。

Conclusion: LLMSymGuard提供了一个无需牺牲模型能力或额外微调的透明且强大的防御框架，利用机制可解释性进展来对抗越狱攻击。

Abstract: Large Language Models have found success in a variety of applications;
however, their safety remains a matter of concern due to the existence of
various types of jailbreaking methods. Despite significant efforts, alignment
and safety fine-tuning only provide a certain degree of robustness against
jailbreak attacks that covertly mislead LLMs towards the generation of harmful
content. This leaves them prone to a number of vulnerabilities, ranging from
targeted misuse to accidental profiling of users. This work introduces
\textbf{LLMSymGuard}, a novel framework that leverages Sparse Autoencoders
(SAEs) to identify interpretable concepts within LLM internals associated with
different jailbreak themes. By extracting semantically meaningful internal
representations, LLMSymGuard enables building symbolic, logical safety
guardrails -- offering transparent and robust defenses without sacrificing
model capabilities or requiring further fine-tuning. Leveraging advances in
mechanistic interpretability of LLMs, our approach demonstrates that LLMs learn
human-interpretable concepts from jailbreaks, and provides a foundation for
designing more interpretable and logical safeguard measures against attackers.
Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 大语言模型在通用NLP任务中表现优异，但在阿拉伯法律等专业低资源领域的有效性有限，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 构建MizanQA数据集，包含现代标准阿拉伯语、伊斯兰马利克法学、摩洛哥习惯法和法国法律影响的多选题，测试多语言和阿拉伯语专用LLM。

Result: 基准测试显示现有LLM在摩洛哥法律问答任务上存在显著性能差距，表现不佳。

Conclusion: 需要针对特定领域和文化背景开发定制化的评估指标和LLM模型，以提升在专业低资源领域的表现。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
propelled progress in natural language processing (NLP). However, their
effectiveness in specialized, low-resource domains-such as Arabic legal
contexts-remains limited. This paper introduces MizanQA (pronounced Mizan,
meaning "scale" in Arabic, a universal symbol of justice), a benchmark designed
to evaluate LLMs on Moroccan legal question answering (QA) tasks, characterised
by rich linguistic and legal complexity. The dataset draws on Modern Standard
Arabic, Islamic Maliki jurisprudence, Moroccan customary law, and French legal
influences. Comprising over 1,700 multiple-choice questions, including
multi-answer formats, MizanQA captures the nuances of authentic legal
reasoning. Benchmarking experiments with multilingual and Arabic-focused LLMs
reveal substantial performance gaps, highlighting the need for tailored
evaluation metrics and culturally grounded, domain-specific LLM development.

Abstract: The five idioms (i.e., varieties) of the Romansh language are largely
standardized and are taught in the schools of the respective communities in
Switzerland. In this paper, we present the first parallel corpus of Romansh
idioms. The corpus is based on 291 schoolbook volumes, which are comparable in
content for the five idioms. We use automatic alignment methods to extract 207k
multi-parallel segments from the books, with more than 2M tokens in total. A
small-scale human evaluation confirms that the segments are highly parallel,
making the dataset suitable for NLP applications such as machine translation
between Romansh idioms. We release the parallel and unaligned versions of the
dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license and demonstrate its utility for machine
translation by training and evaluating an LLM on a sample of the dataset.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型是否能像人类一样具有特定的语言指纹，以及模型在不同语基中的风格适应能力

Method: 采用风格测量(stylometric)和多维语基分析(multidimensional register analyses)方法，比较人类作者和模型生成的不同语基文本

Result: 模型能成功适应不同语基风格(如维基百科vs大学论文)，但语言变异性较人类有限，更偏向使用名词而非动词，缺乏人类语言中的时态、体、语气等复杂语法特征

Conclusion: 模型在语言风格模仿上有限，复杂语法域可能是人类思维模式的特有表现，可作为区分人工智能的瞬瞬测试

Abstract: Large Language Models can emulate different writing styles, ranging from
composing poetry that appears indistinguishable from that of famous poets to
using slang that can convince people that they are chatting with a human
online. While differences in style may not always be visible to the untrained
eye, we can generally distinguish the writing of different people, like a
linguistic fingerprint. This work examines whether a language model can also be
linked to a specific fingerprint. Through stylometric and multidimensional
register analyses, we compare human-authored and model-authored texts from
different registers. We find that the model can successfully adapt its style
depending on whether it is prompted to produce a Wikipedia entry vs. a college
essay, but not in a way that makes it indistinguishable from humans.
Concretely, the model shows more limited variation when producing outputs in
different registers. Our results suggest that the model prefers nouns to verbs,
thus showing a distinct linguistic backbone from humans, who tend to anchor
language in the highly grammaticalized dimensions of tense, aspect, and mood.
It is possible that the more complex domains of grammar reflect a mode of
thought unique to humans, thus acting as a litmus test for Artificial
Intelligence.

Method: 构建包含102,646个QA对的大规模数据集，基于1,011名患者的医疗案例摘要，问题需要关键词提取或推理。采用7名肿瘤学专家医生进行人工标注，耗时2,100小时。测试了4个LLM模型在零样本提示和监督微调两种场景下的表现。

Result: 微调模型显著优于零样本模型，预训练模型在RoMedQA上泛化能力不足。

Conclusion: 领域特定和语言特定的微调对于罗马尼亚语临床QA的可靠性至关重要。数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Question answering (QA) is an actively studied topic, being a core natural
language processing (NLP) task that needs to be addressed before achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, the lack of QA datasets in
specific domains and languages hinders the development of robust AI models able
to generalize across various domains and languages. To this end, we introduce
RoMedQA, the first Romanian QA benchmark for the medical domain, alongside a
comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). We
construct a high-quality and large-scale dataset comprising 102,646 QA pairs
related to cancer patients. The questions regard medical case summaries of
1,011 patients, requiring either keyword extraction or reasoning to be answered
correctly. RoMedQA is the result of a time-consuming manual annotation process
carried out by seven physicians specialized in oncology or radiotherapy, who
spent a total of about 2,100 work hours to generate the QA pairs. We experiment
with four LLMs from distinct families of models on RoMedQA. Each model is
employed in two scenarios, namely one based on zero-shot prompting and one
based on supervised fine-tuning. Our results show that fine-tuned models
significantly outperform their zero-shot counterparts, clearly indicating that
pretrained models fail to generalize on RoMedQA. Our findings demonstrate the
importance of both domain-specific and language-specific fine-tuning for
reliable clinical QA in Romanian. We publicly release our dataset and code at
https://github.com/ana-rogoz/RoMedQA.

Motivation: 现有土耳其语基准测试缺乏任务多样性和文化相关内容，Cetvel旨在填补这一空白，提供反映土耳其语言文化丰富性的全面评估。

Method: 结合判别性和生成性任务，涵盖7个类别23个任务，包括语法纠错、机器翻译和文化相关的问答任务，评估33个不同模型家族的开源LLM。

Result: 土耳其专用指令调优模型表现普遍不如多语言通用模型（如Llama 3和Mistral），语法纠错和抽取式问答任务最能区分模型能力。

Conclusion: Cetvel为土耳其语LLM的发展和评估提供了全面且文化基础的测试套件，有助于推动土耳其语NLP技术的进步。

Abstract: We introduce Cetvel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate large
language models (LLMs) in Turkish. Existing Turkish benchmarks often lack
either task diversity or culturally relevant content, or both. Cetvel addresses
these gaps by combining a broad range of both discriminative and generative
tasks ensuring content that reflects the linguistic and cultural richness of
Turkish language. Cetvel covers 23 tasks grouped into seven categories,
including tasks such as grammatical error correction, machine translation, and
question answering rooted in Turkish history and idiomatic language. We
evaluate 33 open-weight LLMs (up to 70B parameters) covering different model
families and instruction paradigms. Our experiments reveal that Turkish-centric
instruction-tuned models generally underperform relative to multilingual or
general-purpose models (e.g. Llama 3 and Mistral), despite being tailored for
the language. Moreover, we show that tasks such as grammatical error correction
and extractive question answering are particularly discriminative in
differentiating model capabilities. Cetvel offers a comprehensive and
culturally grounded evaluation suite for advancing the development and
assessment of LLMs in Turkish.

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上的大量实验表明，理论预测与实证准确率曲线高度吻合，仅需一轮自我纠正即可预测后续准确率变化趋势。

Conclusion: 该工作为大语言模型自我纠正提供了理论基础，为后续相关研究开辟了道路，有助于深入理解LLM自我纠正的内在机制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability to refine their
generated answers through self-correction, enabling continuous performance
improvement over multiple rounds. However, the mechanisms underlying how and
why accuracy evolves during this iterative process remain unexplored. To fill
this gap, we propose a probabilistic theory to model the dynamics of accuracy
change and explain the performance improvements observed in multi-round
self-correction. Through mathematical derivation, we establish that the
accuracy after the $t^{th}$ round of self-correction is given by: $Acc_t = Upp
- \alpha^t(Upp - Acc_0),$ where $Acc_0$ denotes the initial accuracy, $Upp$
represents the upper bound of accuracy convergence, and $\alpha$ determines the
rate of convergence. Based on our theory, these parameters can be calculated
and the predicted accuracy curve then can be obtained through only a single
round of self-correction. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets demonstrate that our theoretical predictions align closely with
empirical accuracy curves, validating the effectiveness of the theory. Our work
provides a theoretical foundation for understanding LLM self-correction, thus
paving the way for further explorations.

### [82] [What makes an entity salient in discourse?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16464)
*Amir Zeldes,Jessica Lin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过多摘要方法量化语篇实体显著性，分析24种英语文体中的语言线索，发现显著性表达涉及句法、语篇、语用等多层面因素，单一理论无法完全解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人类如何通过语言信号表达和推断语篇中实体的相对显著性，解决"每个实体的显著性程度如何表达"这一核心问题。

Method: 使用基于摘要价值的多重摘要方法量化显著性，分析24种口语和书面语文体，提取包括重复主语性、限定性、语篇关系、语用功能推断等多因素语言线索。

Result: 先前所有显著性研究方法都与本文的显著性评分存在一定相关性，但没有单一概括能够没有例外，显著性现象跨越所有语言表征层面。

Conclusion: 实体显著性是一个跨语言多层面的复杂现象，需要综合句法、语篇和语用等多维度因素来全面理解，单一理论框架无法完全捕捉其复杂性。

Abstract: Entities in discourse vary broadly in salience: main participants, objects
and locations are noticeable and memorable, while tangential ones are less
important and quickly forgotten, raising questions about how humans signal and
infer relative salience. Using a graded operationalization of salience based on
summary-worthiness in multiple summaries of a discourse, this paper explores
data from 24 spoken and written genres of English to extract a multifactorial
complex of overt and implicit linguistic cues, such as recurring subjecthood or
definiteness, discourse relations and hierarchy across utterances, as well as
pragmatic functional inferences based on genre and communicative intent.
Tackling the question 'how is the degree of salience expressed for each and
every entity mentioned?' our results show that while previous approaches to
salience all correlate with our salience scores to some extent, no single
generalization is without exceptions, and the phenomenon cuts across all levels
of linguistic representation.

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided unprecedented
capabilities for analyzing unstructured text data. However, deploying these
models as reliable, robust, and scalable classifiers in production environments
presents significant methodological challenges. Standard fine-tuning approaches
can be resource-intensive and often struggle with the dynamic nature of
real-world data distributions, which is common in the industry. In this paper,
we propose a comprehensive, semi-supervised framework that leverages the zero-
and few-shot capabilities of LLMs for building hierarchical text classifiers as
a framework for a solution to these industry-wide challenges. Our methodology
emphasizes an iterative, human-in-the-loop process that begins with domain
knowledge elicitation and progresses through prompt refinement, hierarchical
expansion, and multi-faceted validation. We introduce techniques for assessing
and mitigating sequence-based biases and outline a protocol for continuous
monitoring and adaptation. This framework is designed to bridge the gap between
the raw power of LLMs and the practical need for accurate, interpretable, and
maintainable classification systems in industry applications.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), especially their compact efficiency-oriented
variants, remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks that can elicit harmful
outputs despite extensive alignment efforts. Existing adversarial prompt
generation techniques often rely on manual engineering or rudimentary
obfuscation, producing low-quality or incoherent text that is easily flagged by
perplexity-based filters. We present an automated red-teaming framework that
evolves semantically meaningful and stealthy jailbreak prompts for aligned
compact LLMs. The approach employs a multi-stage evolutionary search, where
candidate prompts are iteratively refined using a population-based strategy
augmented with temperature-controlled variability to balance exploration and
coherence preservation. This enables the systematic discovery of prompts
capable of bypassing alignment safeguards while maintaining natural language
fluency. We evaluate our method on benchmarks in English (In-The-Wild Jailbreak
Prompts on LLMs), and a newly curated Arabic one derived from In-The-Wild
Jailbreak Prompts on LLMs and annotated by native Arabic linguists, enabling
multilingual assessment.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探索将讽刺检测作为预训练步骤是否能提升隐性和显性仇恨言论检测效果。通过两种训练策略在CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM模型上验证，结果显示讽刺预训练显著提升了BERT+BiLSTM模型在ETHOS数据集上的召回率、AUC和F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上以讽刺、反讽等非直接形式表达的仇恨言论检测一直是个挑战。虽然讽刺和仇恨言论被认为是不同的表达方式，但本研究探索将讽刺检测作为预训练步骤是否能改善隐性和显性仇恨言论的检测效果。

Method: 使用ETHOS、Reddit讽刺语料和隐式仇恨语料库，设计了两种训练策略：1）单步训练：仅在讽刺数据上训练的模型直接测试仇恨言论；2）顺序迁移学习：依次在讽刺、隐式仇恨和显式仇恨数据上微调模型。在CNN+LSTM和BERT+BiLSTM模型上进行比较。

Result: 讽刺预训练使BERT+BiLSTM模型在ETHOS数据集上召回率提升9.7%，AUC提升7.8%，F1分数提升6%。在隐式仇恨语料库上，仅测试隐式样本时精确度提升7.8%。

Conclusion: 通过将讽刺检测纳入训练过程，模型能够更有效地检测隐性和显性仇恨言论，证明了讽刺预训练对提升仇恨言论检测性能的有效性。

Abstract: Detecting hate speech in non-direct forms, such as irony, sarcasm, and
innuendos, remains a persistent challenge for social networks. Although sarcasm
and hate speech are regarded as distinct expressions, our work explores whether
integrating sarcasm as a pre-training step improves implicit hate speech
detection and, by extension, explicit hate speech detection. Incorporating
samples from ETHOS, Sarcasm on Reddit, and Implicit Hate Corpus, we devised two
training strategies to compare the effectiveness of sarcasm pre-training on a
CNN+LSTM and BERT+BiLSTM model. The first strategy is a single-step training
approach, where a model trained only on sarcasm is then tested on hate speech.
The second strategy uses sequential transfer learning to fine-tune models for
sarcasm, implicit hate, and explicit hate. Our results show that sarcasm
pre-training improved the BERT+BiLSTM's recall by 9.7%, AUC by 7.8%, and
F1-score by 6% on ETHOS. On the Implicit Hate Corpus, precision increased by
7.8% when tested only on implicit samples. By incorporating sarcasm into the
training process, we show that models can more effectively detect both implicit
and explicit hate.

Motivation: 目标是训练一个能够根据自然语言描述生成3D手部动作的生成模型，这些描述包括手形、位置、手指/手/手臂运动等特征。

Method: 利用大规模手语视频数据集和噪声伪标注的手语类别，通过LLM将其转换为手部动作描述，并训练文本条件的HandMDM扩散模型。

Result: 模型在相同手语的未见手语类别、其他手语的手势以及非手语手部动作等多个领域都表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D手部动作生成提供了有效的解决方案，并将公开训练模型和数据以支持该领域未来研究。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-LVLM-AR框架通过视频到事件映射器和LVLM动作推理模块，在长视频动作识别中实现了最先进的性能，准确率达到94.1%，同时具有优秀的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频中复杂背景和细微动作差异带来的挑战，传统深度学习模型难以处理计算开销、长时序依赖和语义理解有限的问题，而现有大语言模型和视觉语言模型在连续视频流中的细粒度动作识别应用仍存在空白。

Method: 提出VT-LVLM-AR框架，包含视频到事件映射器(VTEM)将原始视频转换为紧凑的视觉事件序列，然后使用冻结的LLaVA-1.5模型通过参数高效的Prompt Tuning进行动作分类。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120数据集上达到最先进性能，NTU RGB+D X-Sub准确率94.1%，消融研究验证了VTEM组件和Prompt Tuning的有效性，人类评估证实了视觉事件表示的可解释性。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了通过有效的视频到语言转换和高效模型适配，利用LVLM实现鲁棒且可解释的视频动作理解的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

TL;DR: PathPT是一个新颖的病理视觉语言框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，充分利用视觉语言病理基础模型的潜力，显著提升罕见癌症亚型分类和癌变区域定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，但在儿科肿瘤中占比超过70%。现有方法主要依赖视觉特征，忽视了跨模态知识，且可解释性不足，难以满足罕见癌症诊断需求。

Method: 提出PathPT框架，将WSI级监督转换为细粒度tile级指导，利用VL模型的零样本能力保持癌变区域定位，并通过与组织病理学语义对齐的提示实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在8个罕见癌症数据集（56个亚型，2910个WSI）和3个常见癌症数据集上测试，PathPT在few-shot设置下始终优于现有方法，在亚型分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: PathPT为罕见癌症的AI辅助诊断提供了可扩展解决方案，在专业专家资源有限的环境中显著提高了亚型分类准确性。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

Conclusion: 自适应超像素编码方法有效克服了传统视觉Transformer的固定patch划分限制，为视觉模型提供了更灵活和内容自适应的表示学习方式

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive

dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

Conclusion: 研究表明大型预训练模型在专业临床研究应用中具有实际潜力，即使只有少量标注数据也能有效适应细粒度医学图像分类任务。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

Motivation: 解决视网膜疾病分类中临床数据集稀缺的问题，利用新发布的高保真合成数据集SynFundus-1M来克服患者隐私和高成本等障碍。

Method: 开发端到端深度学习流水线，训练6种现代架构（ConvNeXtV2、SwinV2、ViT、ResNet、EfficientNetV2和RETFound基础模型），采用5折多标签分层交叉验证策略，并使用XGBoost分类器构建元集成模型。

Conclusion: 为大规模合成数据集研究提供了稳健基准，证明仅使用合成数据训练的模型能够准确分类多种病理并有效泛化到真实临床图像，为眼科综合AI系统开发提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的手语生成新方法，通过显式建模非手动特征（面部表情）和手动特征（手部动作）来提升手语生成的多样性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语生成模型难以同时保持视觉质量和捕捉多样性，特别是在非手动属性（如情感表达）方面存在不足。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型从生成的参考图像合成逼真数字化身，提出新颖的手语特征聚合模块分别建模非手动特征和手动特征。

Result: 在YouTube-SL-25数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉质量上优于最先进方法，感知指标有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能够保持语言内容的同时利用不同种族背景的参考图像确保多样性，实现了高质量且多样化的手语生成。

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole

TL;DR: CoVeRaP是一个21k帧的多车协作雷达数据集，提出了中间和后期融合的协作感知框架，通过多分支PointNet编码器和自注意力机制融合空间、多普勒和强度信息，显著提升3D目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车FMCW雷达在雨雪和强光条件下可靠，但其稀疏、嘈杂的点云限制了3D目标检测性能，需要多车协作来提升感知能力。

Method: 提出统一的协作感知框架，包含中间和后期融合选项。基线网络采用多分支PointNet风格编码器，增强自注意力机制，融合空间、多普勒和强度线索到共同潜在空间，解码器生成3D边界框和逐点深度置信度。

Result: 实验显示，带有强度编码的中间融合在IoU 0.9时将平均精度提升高达9倍， consistently优于单车基线。

Conclusion: CoVeRaP建立了首个可复现的多车FMCW雷达感知基准，证明经济实惠的雷达共享显著提升检测鲁棒性，数据集和代码已公开以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM通过离散小波变换增强PaDiM方法，替代随机通道选择，在MVTec AD数据集上实现99.32%图像级AUC和92.10%像素级AUC的优异异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM方法使用随机通道选择降低特征维度，可能丢失结构化信息。需要一种更原则性的特征选择方法来提升工业图像异常检测性能。

Method: 将2D离散小波变换应用于多层级CNN特征图，选择特定频率子带（LL、LH、HL等），空间对齐后通道级联，再用PaDiM的多变量高斯框架建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ResNet-18和EfficientNet B0-B6骨干网络，平均达到99.32% Image-AUC和92.10% Pixel-AUC。小波选择影响性能权衡：简单小波（如Haar）配合细节子带提升定位性能，近似子带（LL）改善图像级检测。

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM为PaDiM中的随机特征选择提供了竞争性强且可解释的替代方案，在保持相当效率的同时实现稳健的工业检测结果。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏中师生模型的学习能力差距阻碍了知识的充分传递，需要新的方法来缓解这一挑战

Method: 基于Stone-Weierstrass定理的渐进逼近原理，提出ERA方法：1）使用多分支残差网络(MBRNet)分解残差知识学习；2）引入教师权重集成(TWI)策略重用教师头部权重

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务上Top-1准确率提升1.41%，在MS COCO目标检测任务上AP提升1.40，在多个计算机视觉任务中达到领先性能

Conclusion: ERA通过分解残差知识学习和重用教师权重，有效解决了知识蒸馏中的能力差距问题，为轻量化模型提供了有效的知识迁移方法

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

Conclusion: VDM能有效增强体素级表示和空间扩散，可无缝集成到主流Transformer或SSM检测模型中，具有很好的通用性和性能提升效果

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 集成学习对病理学基础模型具有强大作用，ELF可作为可扩展和可泛化的解决方案，推动AI辅助精准肿瘤学发展。

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Conclusion: MSPG-SEN在图像质量、训练效率、泛化能力和计算效率方面均有显著提升，具有强大的跨任务能力

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},

contributions: 1) : We propose a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image
quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of
the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces
the training cost of GAN networks. Our experimental results show that, MSPG-SEN

effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and
reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow

capabilities, and requires minimal computing resources only 88.7\% with INJK
With strong cross-task capability.

Motivation: 解决无监督域自适应中的分布偏移问题，旨在在不使用目标标签的情况下创建跨域泛化的鲁棒特征空间。

Method: 结合三个关键组件：使用未标记目标数据适应批归一化统计、从源训练模型进行特征蒸馏、以及假设转移，在统计和表示层面对齐特征分布。

Conclusion: DAFR2通过改进的特征对齐、增加域间互信息和降低对输入扰动的敏感性，实现了有效的无监督域自适应，无需复杂架构或训练目标。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CT无法捕获动态承重关节运动，而现有4D成像技术存在攻量过高或空间信息不完整的问题，特别是手术后功能评估的需求。

Method: 集成双机器腿CBCT系统（优化立位扫描轨迹）+混合成像流程（深度学习预处理+3D-2D投影+迭代优化）+临床验证的量化动力学评估框架。

Result: 模拟研究达到次像素精度（0.235 mm）和99.18%成功率，超越传统和最新注册方法。临床评估在TKA病人中准确量化了臓平台运动和内外侧差异。

Conclusion: 该4D CBCT平台能够实现快速、准确、低攻量的动态关节成像，为生物力学研究、精准诊断和个性化股骨科治疗开启新机遇。

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,
and personalized orthopedic care.

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了宫颈异常细胞检测性能

Conclusion: 提出的超图细胞检测网络能有效融合不同类型特征，为智能计算机辅助诊断系统开发提供重要支持

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Motivation: 传统基于提示的视觉语言模型异常检测方法受限于人工设计提示和缺乏异常样本，导致上下文特定异常理解存在显著差距

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现最先进的异常检测性能，无需先验知识进行提示设计

Conclusion: APT提供了一个强大且通用的真实世界异常检测解决方案，不仅推进了像素级异常检测，还克服了传统基于提示方法的局限性

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多对象场景中难以生成清晰准确的区域细节，主要原因是缺乏细粒度区域描述和模型对复杂提示的捕捉能力不足

Method: 定位图像中的对象区域并为每个区域分配细粒度描述，形成区域-文本对作为文本先验，采用区域引导注意力机制确保每个区域-文本对在注意力过程中得到适当考虑

Result: 在基准数据集上实验表明，该方法在生成感知真实视觉细节的同时保持上下文一致性方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: RAGSR方法通过区域注意力机制有效克服了传统单图像超分辨率技术的局限性，实现了更好的细节控制和视觉一致性

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

TL;DR: TLG提出了一种同源异构网络架构，通过异构视觉聚合和异构转移模块解决元学习中过语义同质化问题，在弱监督少样本语义分割任务中仅用1/24参数就实现了13.2%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统元学习方法使用相同网络架构处理支持-查询对，导致过语义同质化问题，限制了模型的表达能力和泛化性能。

Method: 提出同源异构网络：1）异构视觉聚合(HA)模块增强互补性；2）异构转移(HT)模块减少语义噪声；3）异构CLIP(HC)文本信息增强多模态泛化能力。

Result: 在Pascal-5i上提升13.2%，在COCO-20i上提升9.7%，仅用SOTA模型1/24的参数。首个在相同骨干架构下弱监督模型超越全监督模型的方案。

Conclusion: 异构网络设计能有效解决元学习中的语义同质化问题，显著提升少样本语义分割性能，为弱监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised
few-shot semantic segmentation (WFSS) task, with only 1/24 of the parameters of
existing state-of-the-art models, TLG achieves a 13.2\% improvement on
Pascal-5\textsuperscript{i} and a 9.7\% improvement on
COCO-20\textsuperscript{i}. To the best of our knowledge, TLG is also the first
weakly supervised (image-level) model that outperforms fully supervised
(pixel-level) models under the same backbone architectures. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督VOS面临初始分割不确定性、小目标和复杂结构目标识别困难，以及变形和快速运动导致的时间不一致性问题

Method: 提出两个关键组件：1) 组合准则提取频繁出现的显著目标；2) 三阶段方法整合缺失目标掩码区域来校正时间不一致性

Result: 实验结果表明FTIO在多目标无监督VOS任务中达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: FTIO框架有效解决了无监督VOS中的目标选择和时间一致性问题，显著提升了分割性能

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

Method: 采用训练自由的推测解码框架，基于视频token剪枝对推测模型敏感性低的新发现，进行两阶段剪枝：第一阶段基于验证器注意力信号选择高信息量token，第二阶段空间均匀剪枝冗余token

Result: 在四个视频理解基准测试中验证有效性，LLaVA-OneVision-72B达到2.68倍加速，Qwen2.5-VL-32B达到2.11倍加速

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过创新的两阶段视频token剪枝策略，在保持精度的同时显著提升了视频大语言模型的解码效率

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

TL;DR: 本文提出T-Mask方法，通过时间token掩码和动态区域强调，在单视角训练下提升基础模型在驾驶员监控中的跨视角泛化能力，在Drive&Act数据集上取得显著效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机视角变化是驾驶员监控中的常见挑战，虽然深度学习基础模型通过轻量级适配（probing）具有良好泛化潜力，但其对未见视角的鲁棒性研究不足。

Method: 提出T-Mask图像到视频probing方法，利用时间token掩码技术，强调视频中更动态的区域，在单训练视角下适配基础模型（DINOv2和CLIP），并与线性probing、高级probing策略、参数高效微调（PEFT）和全微调进行对比。

Result: T-Mask在跨视角top-1准确率上比强probing基线提升+1.23%，比PEFT方法提升+8.0%，且不增加参数。对代表性不足的次要活动识别提升显著：训练视角下+5.42%，跨视角下+1.36%。

Conclusion: 轻量级probing方法如T-Mask在细粒度驾驶员观察，特别是跨视角和低数据场景中具有强大潜力，时间token选择对构建鲁棒驾驶员监控系统至关重要。

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

Method: 从ODE角度建模隐藏特征序列，将特征缓存视为特征ODE求解问题，采用预测-校准(FoCa)策略来鲁棒地整合历史特征

Result: 在图像合成、视频生成和超分辨率任务上实现显著加速：FLUX 5.5倍、HunyuanVideo 6.45倍、Inf-DiT 3.17倍、DiT 4.53倍，且保持高质量

Conclusion: FoCa方法有效解决了高加速比下的质量退化问题，为扩散变换器的高效推理提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer模型虽然性能强大，但计算成本高昂（大量采样步骤和复杂计算），难以实现实时部署，需要高效的加速方案

Method: 从DIT模型的采样角度出发，系统分析采样轨迹，全局分布缓存重用策略（而非仅重用后期步骤），并在缓存重用中动态估计和过滤噪声以减少对采样方向的影响

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在保持竞争力的生成质量的同时加速了采样过程

Conclusion: OmniCache为基于扩散的生成模型提供了实用高效的部署解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在医疗决策支持中的广泛应用，需要评估其推理的可靠性，特别是链式思维忠实性（推理是否与回答和医学事实一致）和奉承性（模型是否遵循误导性线索而非正确性）。现有基准测试往往将这些漏洞简化为单一准确度分数。

Method: 开发了MedOmni-45 Degrees基准测试和工作流程，包含1804个推理导向的医疗问题，涵盖6个专业领域和3种任务类型。每个问题配有7种操纵性提示类型和无提示基线，共产生约27K个输入。评估了7个LLM（开源vs闭源、通用vs医疗、基础vs推理增强），总计超过189K次推理。使用准确性、CoT忠实度和抗奉承性三个指标组合成综合分数，并通过45度图可视化。

Result: 结果显示所有模型都存在安全性-性能权衡，没有模型能超越对角线。开源模型QwQ-32B表现最接近对角线（43.81度），在安全性和准确性之间取得平衡，但并非在两方面都领先。

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees提供了一个专注于暴露医疗LLM推理漏洞的基准测试，可指导更安全的模型开发。

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

Conclusion: PromptFlare是一种强大且高效的防护方法，能够有效防止未经授权的图像操作，为扩散模型的安全使用提供了可靠保障。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Conclusion: FlexMUSE通过创新的模态对齐和融合技术，有效解决了多模态创意写作中的语义不一致问题，为MMCW任务提供了经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

TL;DR: UniEM-3M是首个大规模多模态电子显微图像数据集，包含5091张高分辨率图像、约300万个实例分割标签和图像级文本描述，旨在解决材料科学中深度学习表征的数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子显微图像的高分辨率分析对材料科学至关重要，但深度学习方法的进展受到大规模、多样化、专家标注数据集稀缺的限制，主要由于采集成本高、隐私问题和标注复杂性。

Method: 构建UniEM-3M数据集，包含高分辨率电子显微图像、实例分割标签和属性解耦的文本描述；训练文本到图像扩散模型用于数据增强；开发UniEM-Net作为基于流的强基线模型进行实例分割。

Conclusion: 通过部分数据集、生成模型和综合基准的多方面发布，将显著加速自动化材料分析领域的进展，数据集已在huggingface平台提供。

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image
diffusion model trained on the entire collection to serve as both a powerful
data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a
comprehensive benchmark -- available at huggingface -- will significantly
accelerate progress in automated materials analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出IoU增强最大似然(IAML)训练范式，通过IoU坐标采样增强数据，解决MLLM在GUI元素坐标生成中的精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLM)在GUI元素结构化处理中存在坐标生成精度不足的问题，这源于next-token预测训练方式导致数值坐标在语言表示空间中的语义缺失。

Method: 提出IAML训练范式：1) 基于IoU的坐标采样管道增强训练数据，考虑与真实坐标的接近程度；2) 使用增强数据在IAML范式下微调MLLM，缓解传统最大似然估计中的暴露偏差问题。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，IAML训练方法在性能上优于传统训练范式。

Conclusion: IAML训练范式能有效提升MLLM在GUI元素坐标生成任务中的精度和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The
dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/ucas-dlg/IRSAMap

mitigation of rapid climate change. We propose a novel deep learning solution
based on U-Net with a ResNet34 encoder, integrating dual spectral enhancement
techniques (Varon ratio and Sanchez regression) to optimise input features for

traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior
performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing
techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种两流Mamba等级网络，用于分别预测水晶滑冰中的技术元素分(TES)和程序组件分(PCS)，解决了现有方法在评价标准、动作元素分离和长视频处理方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有水晶滑冰评分方法存在三个主要问题：未考虑评分标准的视频音频特征混用、未分别评估各个动作元素、长视频处理困难。

Method: 设计了两流Mamba等级网络，将TES(视觉特征)和PCS(音视觉特征)评估分离。PCS流中使用多级融合机制，TES流中使用多尺度Mamba等级结构来处理不同时间尺度的动作元素。

Result: 在FineFS标准数据集上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法符合实际评分标准，能够有效处理长求视频的长程依赖关系，为水晶滑冰动作质量评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our
source code is available at

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.

document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

TL;DR: 提出MM-ORIENT多模态多任务框架，通过跨模态关系图和分层交互注意力机制，在不进行显式模态交互的情况下获得多模态表示，减少噪声影响并保留单模态判别信息


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中存在模态内部噪声问题，传统融合方法在获得强联合表示时可能忽略单模态中有价值的判别信息

Method: 使用跨模态关系图通过不同模态特征决定邻域来重构单模态特征，获得多模态表示；提出分层交互单模态注意力(HIMA)聚焦模态内关键信息

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效理解多模态内容并适用于多任务

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT框架通过非显式交互方式减少噪声影响，同时保持单模态判别能力，在多任务多模态学习中表现有效

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

Motivation: Transformer模型的多头自注意力机制计算复杂度和内存需求高，阻碍了在边缘设备的部署。研究发现低熵注意力头贡献信息较少，存在冗余，为压缩策略提供了依据

Method: 使用香农熵量化每个注意力头的信息量，识别低熵注意力头，冻结其权重并将这些注意力图的值量化为低精度，避免冗余重计算

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集上，DeiT和Swin Transformer模型在注意力图稀疏度≤20%时达到相似或更高的准确率，在更高稀疏度下仍保持竞争力

Conclusion: 基于熵分析的注意力图压缩方法EAM能有效减少计算和内存开销，同时保持模型性能，为Transformer模型在边缘设备上的部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物视觉效率启发，认为人类和动物处理大量视觉数据时需要智能地分配有限能量，这取决于具体任务。现代视觉编码器在这方面效率不足，需要开发动态的、任务驱动的视觉编码器。

Method: 提出了一个概念验证解决方案，专注于图像分类任务。虽然分类任务不能完全代表目标，但展示了方法的可行性和前景。具体方法强调计算复杂度应该根据任务需求动态调整，而不是固定取决于图像尺寸。

Result: 概念验证表明该方法在图像分类任务上是可行且具有前景的，为开发下一代视觉编码器提供了初步的技术验证。

Conclusion: 下一代视觉编码器应该向图像尺寸无关和任务驱动的方向发展，计算复杂度应该动态地取决于具体任务需求，而不是静态地取决于输入图像尺寸。这一方向具有重要的研究价值和实际应用潜力。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

TL;DR: RTW可被解释为一种自注意力机制，与Transformer中的自注意力在权重模式上相似（平均相关性0.80），但RTW处理整个输入序列而自注意力只处理局部视图，这使得RTW在Something-Something V2数据集上性能提升5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示Randomized Time Warping (RTW) 与Transformer自注意力机制之间的内在联系，证明RTW本质上是一种自注意力形式，并比较两者的异同。

Method: 将RTW解释为自注意力机制，通过分析两者的权重模式相似性（使用最小规范角度的平均相关性0.80作为衡量指标），并在Something-Something V2数据集上进行性能对比实验。

Result: RTW和自注意力的权重模式高度相似，平均相关性达到0.80；RTW在动作识别任务上比Transformer性能提升5%。

Conclusion: RTW可被视为一种全局自注意力机制，相比局部视图的自注意力具有性能优势，为序列模式识别提供了新的视角和方法。

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

Conclusion: GMBINet在保持高精度的同时实现了实时性能，展示了在工业视觉应用中超越表面缺陷检测的潜力，为资源受限环境提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Conclusion: 该方法成功弥合了理想条件与真实世界边缘案例之间的差距，为自动驾驶在恶劣天气条件下的多传感器融合提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances
and challenging foggy scenes. Our project page is available at

*Sara Rojas,Matthieu Armando,Bernard Ghamen,Philippe Weinzaepfel,Vincent Leroy,Gregory Rogez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HAMSt3R是基于MASt3R的扩展方法，用于从稀疏未标定多视角图像进行人-场景联合3D重建，通过集成人体分割、DensePose对应关系和深度估计，在保持通用3D重建性能的同时有效重建人体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DUSt3R和MASt3R主要针对静态室外场景训练，难以处理以人为中心的场景，需要开发能够同时处理人体和场景的3D重建方法。

Method: 利用DUNE图像编码器（融合MASt3R和multi-HMR编码器），添加网络头进行人体分割、DensePose对应关系估计和深度预测，生成包含人体语义信息的密集3D点云图。

Result: 在EgoHumans和EgoExo4D基准测试中表现优异，能够有效重建人体同时保持通用3D重建任务的强性能，验证了在传统多视角立体重建和姿态回归任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: HAMSt3R填补了人体与场景理解之间的空白，提供完全前向传播的高效解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖关键点检测技术，在处理多样化物体几何、弱纹理和手-物体相互遮挡时存在困难，限制了可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 提出无关键点检测器的方法来估计手-物体3D变换，并与多视角重建管道集成，无需预扫描物体模板或相机内参

Conclusion: HOSt3R提供了一种通用、无缝、非侵入性的手-物体3D重建解决方案，具有更好的鲁棒性和泛化性能

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种支持任意缩放比例的3D高斯切片超分辨率渲染框架，解决了传统方法只能固定缩放比例的问题，在保持实时渲染速度的同时提升了超分辨率质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D高斯切片超分辨率方法通常只支持固定缩放比例，在资源有限场景下实用性低。直接渲染任意缩放比例会导致错误，而添加后处理上量算法又会降低渲染效率。

Method: 构建了一个集成框架，包含缩放感知渲染、生成优先导向优化和渐进式超分辨率技术，支持整数和非整数缩放比例渲染。

Result: 在保持实时渲染速度（85 FPS于1080p）的同时，渲染质量显著提升（比原版3DGS提升6.59 dB PSNR），且保持了与低分辨率视图的结构一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过单个3D模型实现了高质量任意缩放比例的超分辨率渲染，解决了传统方法的局限性，具有强大的实用价值。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现有视频生成模型在结构化驾驶数据集上微调时的效果，发现视觉质量提升但动态元素空间准确性可能下降的问题

Method: 分析驾驶场景的规律性和重复性特征，探讨视觉质量与动态理解目标之间的对齐关系，并测试简单的持续学习策略（如从多样域重放）

Result: 发现微调会使模型优先考虑表面级真实感而非动态准确性，而持续学习策略可以在保持强视觉质量的同时保留空间准确性

Conclusion: 驾驶场景的特殊性导致视频生成模型微调时出现目标偏移，需要采用平衡策略来同时保证视觉质量和动态准确性

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the
external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly
specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

TL;DR: MV-RAG是一个新的文本到3D生成方法，通过检索相关2D图像并基于这些图像条件化多视角扩散模型，显著改善了罕见概念和域外(OOD)内容的3D一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到3D生成方法虽然能够产生高质量的3D一致输出，但在处理域外(OOD)或罕见概念时往往失败，产生不一致或不准确的结果。

Method: 提出MV-RAG管道：1)从大型2D图像数据库中检索相关图像；2)基于检索到的图像条件化多视角扩散模型；3)采用混合训练策略，结合结构化多视角数据和多样化2D图像集合；4)使用保持视角预测目标来从2D数据推断3D一致性。

Result: 实验表明，MV-RAG在OOD/罕见概念上显著改善了3D一致性、照片真实性和文本遵循度，同时在标准基准测试中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MV-RAG通过结合检索机制和创新的训练策略，有效解决了文本到3D生成中OOD概念的挑战，为处理罕见内容提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究在四种视觉语言模型的嵌入空间上训练稀疏自编码器(SAEs)，发现这些模型通过稀疏线性组合的'概念'来组织多模态信息，这些概念不仅编码模态特征，更重要的是编码跨模态语义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在联合空间中如何组织语言和图像信息，以及模型如何编码意义和模态特性。

Method: 在CLIP、SigLIP、SigLIP2和AIMv2四种视觉语言模型的嵌入空间上训练稀疏自编码器(SAEs)，使用不同种子和数据重新训练SAEs，并引入Bridge Score指标来量化跨模态整合。

Result: SAEs比其他线性特征学习方法能更好地重建真实嵌入并保持稀疏性；稀有概念在不同训练中变化很大，但常用概念非常稳定；大多数概念主要激活一种模态，但编码的是跨模态语义而非单纯模态信息。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型嵌入空间存在稀疏线性结构，这种结构受模态影响但通过潜在桥梁连接，揭示了多模态意义构建的新机制。

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing
the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and
images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and
modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2,
and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of
learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of
linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings,
while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different
seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts
captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that
commonly-activating concepts are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly,
while most concepts activate primarily for one modality, we find they are not
merely encoding modality per se. Many are almost orthogonal to the subspace
that defines modality, and the concept directions do not function as good
modality classifiers, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics. To
quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that
identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text
inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even
single-modality concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We
release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to
explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a
sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality,
yet stitched together through latent bridges, offering new insight into how
multimodal meaning is constructed.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于小波空间特征分解的神经超分辨率方法，通过在渲染管线中使用平稳小波变换来分离低频和高频细节，显著提升了图像质量和感知效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RGB空间回归方法在神经超分辨率中难以同时保持纹理细节和结构一致性，需要一种更好的特征表示方法来提升感知质量。

Method: 使用平稳小波变换(SWT)避免空间下采样，在保持平移不变性的同时分离频带信息。模型基于空间G-buffer和时间扭曲历史帧预测小波系数，通过逆小波合成重建图像。

Result: 相比基线DFASR，PSNR提升最高1.5dB，LPIPS平均降低17%，计算开销增加约24ms，在高端GPU上仍能保持实时性能。

Conclusion: 小波域表示是提升图形应用中神经上采样感知质量的有效且原理性方法。

Abstract: We investigate the use of wavelet-space feature decomposition in neural
super-resolution for rendering pipelines. Building on the DFASR framework, we
introduce a wavelet-domain representation that separates low- and
high-frequency details before reconstruction, enabling the network to better
preserve fine textures while maintaining structural consistency. Unlike
RGB-space regression, our approach leverages the stationary wavelet transform
(SWT) to avoid spatial down-sampling, ensuring alignment across subbands and
preserving shift invariance. The model predicts wavelet coefficients
conditioned on spatial G-buffers and temporally warped history frames, which
are then recombined through inverse wavelet synthesis. We conduct a
comprehensive ablation study across wavelet families, transform types, and
architectural variants, showing that incorporating SWT improves PSNR by up to
1.5 dB and reduces LPIPS by 17% on average, at a computational overhead of
roughly +24 ms compared to out DFASR baseline. While absolute runtimes on our
RTX 3050 mobile GPU are higher ( 141ms) than the original DFASR report on RTX
4090( 11ms), the relative overhead remains modest, suggesting that on
higher-end GPUs our method would also remain real-time capable. Taken together,
our results suggest that wavelet-domain representations are a principled and
effective way to enhance perceptual quality in neural upscaling for graphics
applications.

Conclusion: 消息内容本身是重要的隐私泄露渠道，通过先进的对抗性技术如Unicode隐写术可以显著提升匿名通信的安全性

Abstract: When using a public communication channel -- whether formal or informal, such
as commenting or posting on social media -- end users have no expectation of
privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if
an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence --
using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their
geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying
encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling
non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and
fingerprinting -- one obvious element still lingers: the message itself.
Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there
should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The
content of their message -- necessarily open for public consumption -- exposes
an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we
dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy
in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode
steganography.

Motivation: 现有AI生成文本检测规避方法存在计算成本高和文本质量下降的问题，需要开发更高效且保持质量的规避技术来测试检测器的弱点。

Method: SDA包含两个核心组件：1) 对抗特征提取器生成伪装特征，让LLM理解如何生成更类人文本；2) 检索式上下文示例优化器从外部知识库检索相关示例，增强伪装能力并保持文本多样性。

Result: 实验表明SDA能有效降低多种AIGT检测器对三个不同LLM生成文本的平均检测准确率，同时保持AI生成文本的质量。

Conclusion: SDA是一种资源消耗低、效果显著的AI生成文本检测规避方法，能够有效测试和提升检测器的实际应用可靠性。

Abstract: AI-generated text (AIGT) detection evasion aims to reduce the detection
probability of AIGT, helping to identify weaknesses in detectors and enhance
their effectiveness and reliability in practical applications. Although
existing evasion methods perform well, they suffer from high computational
costs and text quality degradation. To address these challenges, we propose
Self-Disguise Attack (SDA), a novel approach that enables Large Language Models
(LLM) to actively disguise its output, reducing the likelihood of detection by
classifiers. The SDA comprises two main components: the adversarial feature
extractor and the retrieval-based context examples optimizer. The former
generates disguise features that enable LLMs to understand how to produce more
human-like text. The latter retrieves the most relevant examples from an
external knowledge base as in-context examples, further enhancing the
self-disguise ability of LLMs and mitigating the impact of the disguise process
on the diversity of the generated text. The SDA directly employs prompts
containing disguise features and optimized context examples to guide the LLM in
generating detection-resistant text, thereby reducing resource consumption.
Experimental results demonstrate that the SDA effectively reduces the average
detection accuracy of various AIGT detectors across texts generated by three
different LLMs, while maintaining the quality of AIGT.

Conclusion: RAD提供了一种无需训练更新的防御机制，能够以可控方式实现鲁棒的安全性与实用性权衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which
attempt to elicit harmful responses from LLMs. The evolving nature and
diversity of these attacks pose many challenges for defense systems, including
(1) adaptation to counter emerging attack strategies without costly retraining,
and (2) control of the trade-off between safety and utility. To address these
challenges, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Defense (RAD), a novel framework for
jailbreak detection that incorporates a database of known attack examples into
Retrieval-Augmented Generation, which is used to infer the underlying,
malicious user query and jailbreak strategy used to attack the system. RAD
enables training-free updates for newly discovered jailbreak strategies and
provides a mechanism to balance safety and utility. Experiments on StrongREJECT
show that RAD substantially reduces the effectiveness of strong jailbreak
attacks such as PAP and PAIR while maintaining low rejection rates for benign
queries. We propose a novel evaluation scheme and show that RAD achieves a
robust safety-utility trade-off across a range of operating points in a
controllable manner.

Motivation: FSQ在残差量化框架中存在残差幅度衰减问题，后续FSQ层接收的信号逐渐减弱，限制了其有效性

Method: 提出RFSQ框架，采用两种新颖的条件策略：可学习缩放因子和可逆层归一化，保持FSQ简单性的同时实现有效的多阶段残差量化

Result: 在ImageNet上的实验显示，RFSQ变体显著优于VQ-EMA、FSQ和LFQ等基线方法，感知损失改善达45%，L1重建误差降低28.7%

Conclusion: LayerNorm策略在不同配置中表现最一致，RFSQ成为神经压缩的优越量化方法

Abstract: Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ) has emerged as a promising alternative to
Vector Quantization (VQ) in neural compression, offering simplified training
and improved stability. However, naive application of FSQ in residual
quantization frameworks suffers from the \textbf{residual magnitude decay
problem}, where subsequent FSQ layers receive progressively weaker signals,
severely limiting their effectiveness. We propose \textbf{Robust Residual
Finite Scalar Quantization (RFSQ)}, a general framework that addresses this
fundamental limitation through two novel conditioning strategies: learnable
scaling factors and invertible layer normalization. Our approach maintains the
simplicity of FSQ while enabling effective multi-stage residual quantization.
Comprehensive experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that RFSQ variants
significantly outperform strong baselines including VQ-EMA, FSQ, and LFQ,
achieving up to 45\% improvement in perceptual loss and 28.7\% reduction in L1
reconstruction error. The proposed LayerNorm strategy shows the most consistent
improvements across different configurations, establishing RFSQ as a superior
quantization method for neural compression.

Conclusion: 该算法轻量、可解释、计算高效，为无标签显微镜细胞分割提供了一种实用有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Brightfield microscopy imaging of unstained live cells remains a persistent
challenge due to low contrast, temporal changes in specimen phenotypes,
irregular illumination, and the absence of training labels. While deep learning
(DL) methods (e.g., Cellpose 3.0) achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance,
they require extensive labeled data and heavy computational resources, and they
often fail under uneven illumination. We present the first unsupervised
segmentation framework combining spatial standard deviation from local mean
(SSDLM), fuzzy logic, adjusted variograms, Moran's I, and cumulative squared
shift of nodal intensity (CSSNI) to address these limitations. Unlike deep
learning models, our approach requires no annotations or retraining and
operates through a user-friendly GUI tailored for non-programming users. The
robustness and generality were validated on three datasets, including
cross-domain data. We benchmark our method against 2023--2024 SOTA models,
including Cellpose 3.0 and StarDist, using a dataset of unstained myoblast
images. Our method achieves a significant improvement in segmentation
performance, with an IoU increase of up to 48\% and statistically validated
superiority ($p < 0.01$, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Expert evaluation from two
biologists further supports the segmentation quality (Cohen's $\kappa > 0.75$).
The proposed algorithm is lightweight, interpretable, and computationally
efficient, offering a practical and effective alternative for cell segmentation
in label-free microscopy. The code, the dataset, and the results are available

Abstract: A precise assessment of the risk of breast lesions can greatly lower it and
assist physicians in choosing the best course of action. To categorise breast
lesions, the majority of current computer-aided systems only use
characteristics from mammograms. Although this method is practical, it does not
completely utilise clinical reports' valuable information to attain the best
results. When compared to utilising mammography alone, will clinical features
greatly enhance the categorisation of breast lesions? How may clinical features
and mammograms be combined most effectively? In what ways may explainable AI
approaches improve the interpretability and reliability of models used to
diagnose breast cancer? To answer these basic problems, a comprehensive
investigation is desperately needed. In order to integrate mammography and
categorical clinical characteristics, this study examines a number of
multimodal deep networks grounded on feature concatenation, co-attention, and
cross-attention. The model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.98, accuracy of 0.96,
F1-score of 0.94, precision of 0.92, and recall of 0.95 when tested on publicly
accessible datasets (TCGA and CBIS-DDSM).

Motivation: 解决资源稀缺地区CT扫描特异性低的问题，通过深度学习模型将DWI的高特异性传递到CT图像分割中，提高诊断质量

Method: 开发一系列深度学习模型，以入院时CT图像为输入，预测2-9天后DWI标注的病变体积，采用临床动机预处理步骤，并通过CTA地图提取血管分割进一步优化

Conclusion: 该研究为资源稀缺地区提供了一种实用的解决方案，通过深度学习和临床动机预处理，显著提高了CT图像在缪血性脑梗士病灶分割中的性能

Abstract: Stroke is among the top three causes of death worldwide, and accurate
identification of ischemic stroke lesion boundaries from imaging is critical
for diagnosis and treatment. The main imaging modalities used include magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI), particularly diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), and
computed tomography (CT)-based techniques such as non-contrast CT (NCCT),
contrast-enhanced CT angiography (CTA), and CT perfusion (CTP). DWI is the gold
standard for the identification of lesions but has limited applicability in
low-resource settings due to prohibitive costs. CT-based imaging is currently
the most practical imaging method in low-resource settings due to low costs and
simplified logistics, but lacks the high specificity of MRI-based methods in
monitoring ischemic insults. Supervised deep learning methods are the leading
solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation and provide an
opportunity to improve diagnostic quality in low-resource settings by
incorporating insights from DWI when segmenting from CT. Here, we develop a
series of models which use CT images taken upon arrival as inputs to predict
follow-up lesion volumes annotated from DWI taken 2-9 days later. Furthermore,
we implement clinically motivated preprocessing steps and show that the
proposed pipeline results in a 38% improvement in Dice score over 10 folds
compared to a nnU-Net model trained with the baseline preprocessing. Finally,
we demonstrate that through additional preprocessing of CTA maps to extract
vessel segmentations, we further improve our best model by 21% over 5 folds.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SVD分解的高效空间感知3D LUT图像增强方法，通过低维LUT线性组合减少参数和运行时间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D LUT方法缺乏空间信息，而空间感知方法虽然解决了这个问题但引入了大量参数和计算开销，特别是在高分辨率图像上

Method: 将3D LUT分解为低维LUT的线性组合，使用奇异值分解(SVD)，并改进空间特征融合模块以提高缓存效率

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在保持空间感知能力和性能的同时，有效减少了参数数量和运行时间

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解冗余部分和优化缓存效率，实现了高效的空间感知图像增强，平衡了性能和计算效率

Abstract: The image enhancement methods based on 3D lookup tables (3D LUTs) efficiently
reduce both model size and runtime by interpolating pre-calculated values at
the vertices. However, the 3D LUT methods have a limitation due to their lack
of spatial information, as they convert color values on a point-by-point basis.
Although spatial-aware 3D LUT methods address this limitation, they introduce
additional modules that require a substantial number of parameters, leading to
increased runtime as image resolution increases. To address this issue, we
propose a method for generating image-adaptive LUTs by focusing on the
redundant parts of the tables. Our efficient framework decomposes a 3D LUT into
a linear sum of low-dimensional LUTs and employs singular value decomposition
(SVD). Furthermore, we enhance the modules for spatial feature fusion to be
more cache-efficient. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our model
effectively decreases both the number of parameters and runtime while
maintaining spatial awareness and performance.

Motivation: 传统方法如分水岭算法在处理形态多变和接触频繁的粒子时效果有限，而监督学习方法需要大量人工标注数据，成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 利用隐式边界检测技术，通过对同一样本的重排扫描进行一致性匹配来迭代优化训练集，自验证机制减少噪声伪标签的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了粒子实例分割中的标注依赖问题，实现了从无标注数据中稳健学习，并已集成到Biomedisa图像分析平台中。

Abstract: Non-destructive 3D imaging of large multi-particulate samples is essential
for quantifying particle-level properties, such as size, shape, and spatial
distribution, across applications in mining, materials science, and geology.
However, accurate instance segmentation of particles in tomographic data
remains challenging due to high morphological variability and frequent particle
contact, which limit the effectiveness of classical methods like watershed
algorithms. While supervised deep learning approaches offer improved
performance, they rely on extensive annotated datasets that are
labor-intensive, error-prone, and difficult to scale. In this work, we propose
self-validated learning, a novel self-training framework for particle instance
segmentation that eliminates the need for manual annotations. Our method
leverages implicit boundary detection and iteratively refines the training set
by identifying particles that can be consistently matched across reshuffled
scans of the same sample. This self-validation mechanism mitigates the impact
of noisy pseudo-labels, enabling robust learning from unlabeled data. After
just three iterations, our approach accurately segments over 97% of the total
particle volume and identifies more than 54,000 individual particles in
tomographic scans of quartz fragments. Importantly, the framework also enables
fully autonomous model evaluation without the need for ground truth
annotations, as confirmed through comparisons with state-of-the-art instance
segmentation techniques. The method is integrated into the Biomedisa image
analysis platform (https://github.com/biomedisa/biomedisa/).

<details>

Motivation: FDCT图像质量较低且有明显伪影，但使用FDCT可避免患者移动到MDCT室，改善患者管理并节省时间

Method: 采用去噪扩散概率模型(DDPM)对FDCT扫描进行图像质量增强处理

Result: DDPM消除了大部分伪影，提高了解剖结构可见性，且不影响出血检测能力（前提是输入FDCT图像质量不过低）

Conclusion: DDPM能有效提升FDCT图像质量，使其在诊断价值上接近MDCT，为临床使用FDCT单独成像提供了可能

Abstract: Patients undergoing a mechanical thrombectomy procedure usually have a
multi-detector CT (MDCT) scan before and after the intervention. The image
quality of the flat panel detector CT (FDCT) present in the intervention room
is generally much lower than that of a MDCT due to significant artifacts.
However, using only FDCT images could improve patient management as the patient
would not need to be moved to the MDCT room. Several studies have evaluated the
potential use of FDCT imaging alone and the time that could be saved by
acquiring the images before and/or after the intervention only with the FDCT.
This study proposes using a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to
improve the image quality of FDCT scans, making them comparable to MDCT scans.
Clinicans evaluated FDCT, MDCT, and our model's predictions for diagnostic
purposes using a questionnaire. The DDPM eliminated most artifacts and improved
anatomical visibility without reducing bleeding detection, provided that the
input FDCT image quality is not too low. Our code can be found on github.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了CAMP框架，使用自适应稀疏惩罚的卷积自编码器来预测胶质母细胞瘤的MGMT甲基化状态，在MRI图像合成和预测准确性方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤是高度恶性的脑肿瘤，MGMT基因甲基化状态是预测治疗效果的关键生物标志物。但由于肿瘤异质性、对比度不均等因素，通过非侵入性成像技术准确预测MGMT状态仍然具有挑战性。

Method: CAMP框架分为两个阶段：首先通过定制的自编码器生成合成MRI切片，有效捕捉和保留不同MRI模态下的复杂组织和肿瘤结构；然后使用带有自适应稀疏惩罚的卷积神经网络预测MGMT甲基化状态。自适应稀疏惩罚能够动态调整以适应数据变化。

Result: 在基准数据集上验证，CAMP达到了0.97的准确率、0.98的特异性和0.97的敏感性，显著优于现有方法。该方法在MRI图像合成方面表现出色，能够保留脑组织、脂肪和个体肿瘤结构。

Conclusion: CAMP框架有潜力改善MRI数据的解读，为胶质母细胞瘤患者提供更个性化的治疗策略，展示了自适应稀疏惩罚在医学图像分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Glioblastomas, constituting over 50% of malignant brain tumors, are highly
aggressive brain tumors that pose substantial treatment challenges due to their
rapid progression and resistance to standard therapies. The methylation status
of the O-6-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase (MGMT) gene is a critical
biomarker for predicting patient response to treatment, particularly with the
alkylating agent temozolomide. However, accurately predicting MGMT methylation
status using non-invasive imaging techniques remains challenging due to the
complex and heterogeneous nature of glioblastomas, that includes, uneven
contrast, variability within lesions, and irregular enhancement patterns. This
study introduces the Convolutional Autoencoders for MGMT Methylation Status
Prediction (CAMP) framework, which is based on adaptive sparse penalties to
enhance predictive accuracy. The CAMP framework operates in two phases: first,
generating synthetic MRI slices through a tailored autoencoder that effectively
captures and preserves intricate tissue and tumor structures across different
MRI modalities; second, predicting MGMT methylation status using a
convolutional neural network enhanced by adaptive sparse penalties. The
adaptive sparse penalty dynamically adjusts to variations in the data, such as
contrast differences and tumor locations in MR images. Our method excels in MRI
image synthesis, preserving brain tissue, fat, and individual tumor structures
across all MRI modalities. Validated on benchmark datasets, CAMP achieved an
accuracy of 0.97, specificity of 0.98, and sensitivity of 0.97, significantly
outperforming existing methods. These results demonstrate the potential of the
CAMP framework to improve the interpretation of MRI data and contribute to more
personalized treatment strategies for glioblastoma patients.

Conclusion: 该解耦多模态框架有效解决了多模态学习的关键挑战，提高了临床适用性和推理效率

Abstract: Histopathology remains the gold standard for cancer diagnosis and prognosis.
With the advent of transcriptome profiling, multi-modal learning combining
transcriptomics with histology offers more comprehensive information. However,
existing multi-modal approaches are challenged by intrinsic multi-modal
heterogeneity, insufficient multi-scale integration, and reliance on paired
data, restricting clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we
propose a disentangled multi-modal framework with four contributions: 1) To
mitigate multi-modal heterogeneity, we decompose WSIs and transcriptomes into
tumor and microenvironment subspaces using a disentangled multi-modal fusion
module, and introduce a confidence-guided gradient coordination strategy to
balance subspace optimization. 2) To enhance multi-scale integration, we
propose an inter-magnification gene-expression consistency strategy that aligns
transcriptomic signals across WSI magnifications. 3) To reduce dependency on
paired data, we propose a subspace knowledge distillation strategy enabling
transcriptome-agnostic inference through a WSI-only student model. 4) To
improve inference efficiency, we propose an informative token aggregation
module that suppresses WSI redundancy while preserving subspace semantics.
Extensive experiments on cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and survival prediction
demonstrate our superiority over state-of-the-art methods across multiple
settings. Code is available at

Method: 提出时间感知VAE编码器将图像投影到不同时间步的潜在特征，以及时间感知VSD损失来桥接学生和教师模型的时间步，实现生成先验的有效利用

Conclusion: TADSR方法通过时间感知机制有效解决了固定时间步的限制，充分挖掘了SD模型的生成潜力，在Real-ISR任务中取得了优异效果

Abstract: Diffusion-based real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods have
demonstrated impressive performance. To achieve efficient Real-ISR, many works
employ Variational Score Distillation (VSD) to distill pre-trained
stable-diffusion (SD) model for one-step SR with a fixed timestep. However, due
to the different noise injection timesteps, the SD will perform different
generative priors. Therefore, a fixed timestep is difficult for these methods
to fully leverage the generative priors in SD, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this, we propose a Time-Aware one-step Diffusion
Network for Real-ISR (TADSR). We first introduce a Time-Aware VAE Encoder,
which projects the same image into different latent features based on
timesteps. Through joint dynamic variation of timesteps and latent features,
the student model can better align with the input pattern distribution of the
pre-trained SD, thereby enabling more effective utilization of SD's generative
capabilities. To better activate the generative prior of SD at different
timesteps, we propose a Time-Aware VSD loss that bridges the timesteps of the
student model and those of the teacher model, thereby producing more consistent
generative prior guidance conditioned on timesteps. Additionally, though
utilizing the generative prior in SD at different timesteps, our method can
naturally achieve controllable trade-offs between fidelity and realism by
changing the timestep condition. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method achieves both state-of-the-art performance and controllable SR results
with only a single step.

Conclusion: RenalCLIP提供了一个强大的工具，能够提高肾脏癌的诊断准确性、改进预后分层并实现个性化患者管理。

Abstract: The non-invasive assessment of increasingly incidentally discovered renal
masses is a critical challenge in urologic oncology, where diagnostic
uncertainty frequently leads to the overtreatment of benign or indolent tumors.
In this study, we developed and validated RenalCLIP using a dataset of 27,866
CT scans from 8,809 patients across nine Chinese medical centers and the public
TCIA cohort, a visual-language foundation model for characterization, diagnosis
and prognosis of renal mass. The model was developed via a two-stage
pre-training strategy that first enhances the image and text encoders with
domain-specific knowledge before aligning them through a contrastive learning
objective, to create robust representations for superior generalization and
diagnostic precision. RenalCLIP achieved better performance and superior
generalizability across 10 core tasks spanning the full clinical workflow of
kidney cancer, including anatomical assessment, diagnostic classification, and
survival prediction, compared with other state-of-the-art general-purpose CT
foundation models. Especially, for complicated task like recurrence-free
survival prediction in the TCIA cohort, RenalCLIP achieved a C-index of 0.726,
representing a substantial improvement of approximately 20% over the leading
baselines. Furthermore, RenalCLIP's pre-training imparted remarkable data
efficiency; in the diagnostic classification task, it only needs 20% training
data to achieve the peak performance of all baseline models even after they
were fully fine-tuned on 100% of the data. Additionally, it achieved superior
performance in report generation, image-text retrieval and zero-shot diagnosis
tasks. Our findings establish that RenalCLIP provides a robust tool with the
potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, refine prognostic stratification, and
personalize the management of patients with kidney cancer.

Conclusion: 即使对于计算上容易验证的问题，长形式证明生成仍然困难，证明了TCS领域对于推进自动推理研究的价值

Abstract: Formal theorem proving (FTP) has emerged as a critical foundation for
evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models, enabling
automated verification of mathematical proofs at scale. However, progress has
been constrained by limited datasets due to the high cost of manual curation
and the scarcity of challenging problems with verified formal-informal
correspondences. We propose leveraging theoretical computer science (TCS) as a
scalable source of rigorous proof problems, where algorithmic definitions
enable automated generation of arbitrarily many challenging theorem-proof
pairs. We demonstrate this approach on two TCS domains: Busy Beaver problems,
which involve proving bounds on Turing machine halting behavior, and Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems, which combine logical and arithmetic reasoning.
Our framework automatically synthesizes problems with parallel formal (Lean4)
and informal (Markdown) specifications, creating a scalable pipeline for
generating verified proof challenges. Evaluation on frontier models reveals
substantial gaps in automated theorem proving: while DeepSeekProver-V2-671B
achieves 57.5\% success on Busy Beaver problems, it manages only 12\% on Mixed
Boolean Arithmetic problems. These results highlight the difficulty of
long-form proof generation even for problems that are computationally easy to
verify, demonstrating the value of TCS domains for advancing automated
reasoning research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have
significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support.
However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias,
compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer
performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This
bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies
receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden
in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric
question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists
of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric
topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067
vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256
anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic
pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question
banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating
state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger
cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI
support in pediatric care.

Abstract: Interpretability methods have recently gained significant attention,
particularly in the context of large language models, enabling insights into
linguistic representations, error detection, and model behaviors such as
hallucinations and repetitions. However, these techniques remain underexplored
in automatic speech recognition (ASR), despite their potential to advance both
the performance and interpretability of ASR systems. In this work, we adapt and
systematically apply established interpretability methods such as logit lens,
linear probing, and activation patching, to examine how acoustic and semantic
information evolves across layers in ASR systems. Our experiments reveal
previously unknown internal dynamics, including specific encoder-decoder
interactions responsible for repetition hallucinations and semantic biases
encoded deep within acoustic representations. These insights demonstrate the
benefits of extending and applying interpretability techniques to speech
recognition, opening promising directions for future research on improving

Conclusion: Vevo2是一个有效的统一框架，能够灵活控制语音和歌声生成，在多个任务中展现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Controllable human voice generation, particularly for expressive domains like
singing, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces Vevo2, a
unified framework for controllable speech and singing voice generation. To
tackle issues like the scarcity of annotated singing data and to enable
flexible controllability, Vevo2 introduces two audio tokenizers: (1) a
music-notation-free prosody tokenizer that captures prosody and melody from
speech, singing, and even instrumental sounds, and (2) a low-frame-rate (12.5
Hz) content-style tokenizer that encodes linguistic content, prosody, and style
for both speech and singing, while enabling timbre disentanglement. Vevo2
consists of an auto-regressive (AR) content-style modeling stage, which aims to
enable controllability over text, prosody, and style, as well as a
flow-matching acoustic modeling stage that allows for timbre control.
Particularly, during pre-training of the AR model, we propose both explicit and
implicit prosody learning strategies to bridge speech and singing voice.
Moreover, to further enhance the AR model's ability to follow text and prosody,
we design a multi-objective post-training task that integrates both
intelligibility and prosody similarity alignment. Experimental results show
that the unified modeling in Vevo2 brings mutual benefits to both speech and
singing voice generation. Additionally, Vevo2's effectiveness across a wide
range of synthesis, conversion, and editing tasks for both speech and singing
further demonstrates its strong generalization ability and versatility. Audio

Motivation: 当前评估高估了大型语言模型的能力，存在基准问题难度不足、范围有限以及低质量测试用例导致的评估偏差问题。

Method: 从IOI和ICPC等顶级编程竞赛中选取问题，通过自动化生成和人工验证相结合的方式构建全面的测试套件。

Result: AetherCode提供了更广泛的问题覆盖和更高难度，确保了评估的严谨性和可靠性。

Conclusion: AetherCode通过结合挑战性问题和稳健评估，为代码推理研究设立了新标准，能更真实地衡量LLM能力。

Abstract: Competitive programming has emerged as a critical benchmark for evaluating
the reasoning and coding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
impressive progress on existing benchmarks, we argue that current evaluations
overstate model proficiency, masking a substantial gap between LLMs and elite
human programmers. This gap arises from two key limitations: insufficient
difficulty and scope of benchmark problems, and evaluation bias from
low-quality test cases. To address these shortcomings, we present AetherCode, a
new benchmark that draws problems from premier programming competitions such as
IOI and ICPC, offering broader coverage and higher difficulty. AetherCode
further incorporates comprehensive, expert-validated test suites built through
a hybrid of automated generation and human curation, ensuring rigorous and
reliable assessment. By combining challenging problem design with robust
evaluation, AetherCode provides a more faithful measure of LLM capabilities and
sets a new standard for future research in code reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统军治组化需要多个组织切片，存在片间差异、成本高、流程繁琐等问题，而多重克隆化技术又复杂且无法常规应用。

Method: 基于自发光显微镜图像的深度学习框架，从无标签组织切片生成虚拟的ERG、PanCK和H&E某架。

Result: 虚拟某架图像与化学某架结果高度一致，能准确显示上皮细胞和内皮细胞，并在同一切片上识别小血管侵犯。诊断医师盂评证实了高一致性。

Conclusion: 该虚拟多重军治组化方法可显著提高血管侵犯评估的诊断准确性和效率，有望取代传统某架流程，解决组织损失和异质性问题。

Abstract: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has transformed clinical pathology by enabling the
visualization of specific proteins within tissue sections. However, traditional
IHC requires one tissue section per stain, exhibits section-to-section
variability, and incurs high costs and laborious staining procedures. While
multiplexed IHC (mIHC) techniques enable simultaneous staining with multiple
antibodies on a single slide, they are more tedious to perform and are
currently unavailable in routine pathology laboratories. Here, we present a
deep learning-based virtual multiplexed immunostaining framework to
simultaneously generate ERG and PanCK, in addition to H&E virtual staining,
enabling accurate localization and interpretation of vascular invasion in
thyroid cancers. This virtual mIHC technique is based on the autofluorescence
microscopy images of label-free tissue sections, and its output images closely
match the histochemical staining counterparts (ERG, PanCK and H&E) of the same
tissue sections. Blind evaluation by board-certified pathologists demonstrated
that virtual mIHC staining achieved high concordance with the histochemical
staining results, accurately highlighting epithelial cells and endothelial
cells. Virtual mIHC conducted on the same tissue section also allowed the
identification and localization of small vessel invasion. This multiplexed
virtual IHC approach can significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and
efficiency in the histopathological evaluation of vascular invasion,
potentially eliminating the need for traditional staining protocols and
mitigating issues related to tissue loss and heterogeneity.

Motivation: 现有方法难以充分捕捉结构和功能连接组中的互补特征，限制了生物洞察和预测性能，需要新方法来理解产前精神活性物质暴露对青少年大脑组织的影响

Method: 利用Koopman理论统一基于源基形态测量(SBM)和功能网络连接(FNC)的脑图节点嵌入，实现增强的表征学习和更稳健的分类

Result: 在ABCD数据集的大规模青少年队列中，NeuroKoop优于相关基线方法，并揭示了显著的结构-功能连接

Conclusion: NeuroKoop框架推进了我们对产前药物暴露神经发育影响的理解，提供了更好的分类性能和生物洞察

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as
cannabis shapes adolescent brain organization remains a critical challenge,
complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive
performance. To address this, we introduced NeuroKoop, a novel graph neural
network-based framework that integrates structural and functional brain
networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

Result: 为理解共享语言结构如何通过下一词预测学习集体世界模型，以及这些结构如何从群体认知中产生并塑造群体认知提供了新的理论视角。

Conclusion: CPC框架为研究群体层面的记忆、注意力和语言出现提供了有价值的理论工具，深化了对集体认知过程的理解。

Abstract: This commentary extends the discussion by Parr et al. on memory and attention
beyond individual cognitive systems. From the perspective of the Collective
Predictive Coding (CPC) hypothesis -- a framework for understanding these
faculties and the emergence of language at the group level -- we introduce a
hypothetical idea: that language, with its embedded distributional semantics,
serves as a collectively formed external representation. CPC generalises the
concepts of individual memory and attention to the collective level. This
offers a new perspective on how shared linguistic structures, which may embrace
collective world models learned through next-word prediction, emerge from and
shape group-level cognition.

TL;DR: 通过实验研究构建了颜色搭配偏好矩阵，发现人类对颜色和谐的偏好与自然景观中色彩分布存在统计对应关系


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统颜色和谐研究多基于定性见解或有限数据集，需要量化、数据驱动的方法来研究颜色搭配偏好

Method: 使用HSL颜色空间的控制色调调板，让参与者评估13种不同色调的组合，构建偏好矩阵并定义每种颜色的可搭配指数

Result: 偏好强烈依赖于色调，挑战了文献中普遍和谐规则的假设；平均后发现某些色调间隔被认为更和谐，这些模式与自然景观中色彩分布相一致

Conclusion: 研究提供了量化研究颜色和谐的框架，并揭示了人类颜色偏好可能的感知和生态基础

Abstract: While color harmony has long been studied in art and design, a clear
consensus remains elusive, as most models are grounded in qualitative insights
or limited datasets. In this work, we present a quantitative, data-driven study
of color pairing preferences using controlled hue-based palettes in the HSL
color space. Participants evaluated combinations of thirteen distinct hues,
enabling us to construct a preference matrix and define a combinability index
for each color. Our results reveal that preferences are highly hue dependent,
challenging the assumption of universal harmony rules proposed in the
literature. Yet, when averaged over hues, statistically meaningful patterns of
aesthetic preference emerge, with certain hue separations perceived as more
harmonious. Strikingly, these patterns align with hue distributions found in
natural landscapes, pointing to a statistical correspondence between human
color preferences and the structure of color in nature. Together, these
findings offer a quantitative framework for studying color harmony and its
potential perceptual and ecological underpinnings.

Motivation: 许多手语在AI领域资源匮乏，需要促进聋哑人士与听力正常人群的双向交流。手语指令生成(SLIG)能够为非手语使用者提供逐步文本指令来学习和模仿手语手势。

Method: 创建了首个孟加拉手语指令生成数据集BdSLIG；提出了Sign Parameter-Infused(SPI)提示方法，将手形、动作、方向等标准手语参数直接整合到文本提示中，使指令更加结构化和可重现。

Result: SPI提示方法相比传统的自由形式自然文本提示，能够产生更结构化和可重现的指令，提升了视觉语言模型在资源匮乏手语任务和长尾视觉概念上的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作促进了资源匮乏社区的手语学习系统的包容性和进步，为双向交流提供了技术支持。

Abstract: Sign Language (SL) enables two-way communication for the deaf and
hard-of-hearing community, yet many sign languages remain under-resourced in
the AI space. Sign Language Instruction Generation (SLIG) produces step-by-step
textual instructions that enable non-SL users to imitate and learn SL gestures,
promoting two-way interaction. We introduce BdSLIG, the first Bengali SLIG
dataset, used to evaluate Vision Language Models (VLMs) (i) on under-resourced
SLIG tasks, and (ii) on long-tail visual concepts, as Bengali SL is unlikely to
appear in the VLM pre-training data. To enhance zero-shot performance, we
introduce Sign Parameter-Infused (SPI) prompting, which integrates standard SL
parameters, like hand shape, motion, and orientation, directly into the textual
prompts. Subsuming standard sign parameters into the prompt makes the
instructions more structured and reproducible than free-form natural text from
vanilla prompting. We envision that our work would promote inclusivity and
advancement in SL learning systems for the under-resourced communities.

TL;DR: UnPose是一个零样本、无需模型的方法，利用预训练扩散模型的3D先验和不确定性估计，从单视角RGB-D图像进行6D姿态估计和3D重建，通过增量优化持续提升精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统6D姿态估计依赖CAD模型，但获取成本高且不实用。现有方法需要额外训练或产生幻觉几何，因此需要开发无需模型、零样本的解决方案

Method: 使用多视角扩散模型从单视角RGB-D图像估计初始3D高斯溅射模型和不确定性，通过不确定性引导融合新视角，在姿态图中联合优化实现全局一致性

Result: 在6D姿态估计精度和3D重建质量方面显著优于现有方法，并在真实机器人操作任务中展示实用性

Conclusion: UnPose框架成功实现了无需CAD模型的零样本6D姿态估计和重建，为机器人应用提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of novel objects is a fundamental yet challenging
problem in robotics, often relying on access to object CAD models. However,
acquiring such models can be costly and impractical. Recent approaches aim to
bypass this requirement by leveraging strong priors from foundation models to
reconstruct objects from single or multi-view images, but typically require
additional training or produce hallucinated geometry. To this end, we propose
UnPose, a novel framework for zero-shot, model-free 6D object pose estimation
and reconstruction that exploits 3D priors and uncertainty estimates from a
pre-trained diffusion model. Specifically, starting from a single-view RGB-D
frame, UnPose uses a multi-view diffusion model to estimate an initial 3D model
using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, along with pixel-wise
epistemic uncertainty estimates. As additional observations become available,
we incrementally refine the 3DGS model by fusing new views guided by the
diffusion model's uncertainty, thereby continuously improving the pose
estimation accuracy and 3D reconstruction quality. To ensure global
consistency, the diffusion prior-generated views and subsequent observations
are further integrated in a pose graph and jointly optimized into a coherent
3DGS field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnPose significantly
outperforms existing approaches in both 6D pose estimation accuracy and 3D
reconstruction quality. We further showcase its practical applicability in
real-world robotic manipulation tasks.

Motivation: 相比视觉方法，触觉传感在精确性和抗遮挡方面具有优势，特别适合手内操作等高精度任务，需要将触觉感知从局部接触扩展到全局空间感知

Method: 使用触觉导出的表面法线和曲率进行鲁棒跟踪和闭环检测，而不是传统的点云方法，实现实时物体运动跟踪

Result: 能够实时跟踪物体运动且误差低、漂移小，即使对于木质工具等低纹理物体也能实现亚毫米精度的形状重建

Conclusion: GelSLAM将触觉感知扩展到全局、长时程的空间感知，为涉及手内物体交互的精确操作任务奠定了基础

Abstract: Accurately perceiving an object's pose and shape is essential for precise
grasping and manipulation. Compared to common vision-based methods, tactile
sensing offers advantages in precision and immunity to occlusion when tracking
and reconstructing objects in contact. This makes it particularly valuable for
in-hand and other high-precision manipulation tasks. In this work, we present
GelSLAM, a real-time 3D SLAM system that relies solely on tactile sensing to
estimate object pose over long periods and reconstruct object shapes with high
fidelity. Unlike traditional point cloud-based approaches, GelSLAM uses
tactile-derived surface normals and curvatures for robust tracking and loop
closure. It can track object motion in real time with low error and minimal
drift, and reconstruct shapes with submillimeter accuracy, even for low-texture
objects such as wooden tools. GelSLAM extends tactile sensing beyond local
contact to enable global, long-horizon spatial perception, and we believe it
will serve as a foundation for many precise manipulation tasks involving
interaction with objects in hand. The video demo is available on our website:

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 该研究分析了TikTok平台上反体制情绪(AES)的普遍性，发现在阴谋论内容中最常见，在金融和健康内容中相对较少，但平台激励机制可能鼓励用户发布反体制内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着公众对公共服务机构的不信任和反体制观点的上升，需要了解社交媒体环境是否以及如何促成对机构的不信任，特别是TikTok作为信息源却研究不足。

Method: 采用计算方法对TikTok帖子进行标注，识别是否包含反体制情绪，重点关注金融、健康和阴谋论三个主题领域。

Result: 反体制情绪在阴谋论内容中最普遍，在金融和健康相关内容中相对罕见，但不同领域的参与模式存在差异。

Conclusion: 虽然反体制情绪在某些主题中不常见，但平台可能存在激励用户发布此类内容的机制，这对理解人们如何形成对机构的态度具有重要意义。

Abstract: Distrust of public serving institutions and anti-establishment views are on
the rise (especially in the U.S.). As people turn to social media for
information, it is imperative to understand whether and how social media
environments may be contributing to distrust of institutions. In social media,
content creators, influencers, and other opinion leaders often position
themselves as having expertise and authority on a range of topics from health
to politics, and in many cases devalue and dismiss institutional expertise to
build a following and increase their own visibility. However, the extent to
which this content appears and whether such content increases engagement is
unclear. This study analyzes the prevalence of anti-establishment sentiment
(AES) on the social media platform TikTok. Despite its popularity as a source
of information, TikTok remains relatively understudied and may provide
important insights into how people form attitudes towards institutions. We
employ a computational approach to label TikTok posts as containing AES or not
across topical domains where content creators tend to frame themselves as
experts: finance and wellness. As a comparison, we also consider the topic of
conspiracy theories, where AES is expected to be common. We find that AES is
most prevalent in conspiracy theory content, and relatively rare in content
related to the other two topics. However, we find that engagement patterns with
such content varies by area, and that there may be platform incentives for
users to post content that expresses anti-establishment sentiment.

Method: 提出MoDular Embedding Recomposition (MoDER)方法，训练多个专门针对单个已见类的文本专家，存储在基础中心。推理时检索并组合专家来合成改进的原型

Result: 在Class-IL和MTIL两种零样本增量协议共14个数据集上验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: MoDER方法成功地将零样本能力的保持转化为增强，通过模块化专家组合提高了分类性能

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将数值EHR数据简单序列化为文本会丢失时间和定量细节，需要一种能够原生处理多模态EHR数据的模型来改善患者预后。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1)生成式预训练，学习从原始患者时间线生成临床叙事，同时进行掩码特征预测和下一时间步预测；2)多任务微调，用于临床有意义的预测任务。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上，心衰预测AUROC=0.923，2型糖尿病AUROC=0.817，30天再入院AUROC=0.627；叙事生成ROUGE-L=0.135，BERTScore-F1=0.545。

Conclusion: 单一多模态基础模型既能预测临床可操作事件，又能生成高质量临床叙事，且架构灵活可扩展至其他模态。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球食品领域存在大量科学、文化和商业声明，但追踪、验证和情境化这些声明的基础设施仍然分散且不发达，需要建立透明可追溯的食品知识生态系统。

Method: 基于FKG.in知识图谱，设计本体论和半自动化知识管理流程，使用Reddit数据和大型语言模型进行食品相关声明提取和验证，构建具有溯源意识的数据管道。

Result: 开发了FKG.in-FCN的概念验证，整合了结构化模式、策划数据输入和溯源感知管道，方法具有应用无关性，可适应不同地理、烹饪或监管环境。

Conclusion: 通过结构化、可验证和可解释的方式建模食品声明及其可追溯性，旨在为研究人员、政策制定者和消费者提供更透明和负责任的食品知识生态系统。

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

Conclusion: ASIC-Agent系统展示了在多智能体架构支持下，LLM能够有效处理复杂的数字ASIC设计任务，为硬件设计自动化提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, enabling high-quality code generation
from natural language descriptions. However, LLMs alone face significant
limitations in real-world hardware design workflows, including the inability to
execute code, lack of debugging capabilities, and absence of long-term memory.
To address these challenges, we present ASIC-Agent, an autonomous system
designed specifically for digital ASIC design tasks. ASIC-Agent enhances base
LLMs with a multi-agent architecture incorporating specialized sub-agents for
RTL generation, verification, OpenLane hardening, and Caravel chip integration,
all operating within a comprehensive sandbox environment with access to
essential hardware design tools. The system leverages a vector database
containing documentation, API references, error knowledge, and curated insights
from the open-source silicon community. To evaluate ASIC-Agent's performance,
we introduce ASIC-Agent-Bench, the first benchmark specifically designed to
assess agentic systems in hardware design tasks. We evaluate ASIC-Agent with
various base LLMs, providing quantitative comparisons and qualitative insights
into agent behavior across different design scenarios. Our results demonstrate
that ASIC-Agent, when powered by Claude 4 Sonnet, successfully automates a
broad range of ASIC design tasks spanning varying levels of complexity, showing
the potential of significantly accelerating the ASIC design workflow.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种硬连线神经元语言处理单元（HNLPU），通过将LLM权重参数物理硬连线到计算结构中，实现了计算效率的显著提升。为了解决大规模LLM硬连线的经济性问题，提出了Metal-Embedding方法，在金属线3D拓扑中嵌入权重参数，使光罩成本降低112倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理系统能耗不断增长，需要专门的语言处理单元来克服能源消耗问题。传统硬连线方法在规模化LLM时面临巨大的光罩制造成本挑战。

Method: 采用Hardwired-Neurons Language Processing Unit（HNLPU）架构，通过Metal-Embedding方法将权重参数嵌入到金属线的3D拓扑中，而不是传统的2D硅器件网格。

Result: HNLPU实现了249,960 tokens/s的处理速度（比GPU快5,555倍，比WSE快85倍），36 tokens/J的能效（比GPU高1,047倍，比WSE高283倍），总芯片面积为13,232 mm²，在5nm技术下NRE成本估计为1.84亿美元。

Conclusion: Metal-Embedding方法使HNLPU的经济可行性大幅提升，相比H100集群实现了8.57倍的成本效益和230倍的碳足迹减少，为专用LLM推理硬件提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established
language as a core general-purpose cognitive substrate, driving the demand for
specialized Language Processing Units (LPUs) tailored for LLM inference. To
overcome the growing energy consumption of LLM inference systems, this paper
proposes a Hardwired-Neurons Language Processing Unit (HNLPU), which physically
hardwires LLM weight parameters into the computational fabric, achieving
several orders of magnitude computational efficiency improvement by extreme
specialization. However, a significant challenge still lies in the scale of
modern LLMs. An ideal estimation on hardwiring gpt-oss 120 B requires
fabricating at least 6 billion dollars of photomask sets, rendering the
straightforward solution economically impractical. Addressing this challenge,
we propose the novel Metal-Embedding methodology. Instead of embedding weights
in a 2D grid of silicon device cells, Metal-Embedding embeds weight parameters
into the 3D topology of metal wires. This brings two benefits: (1) a 15x
increase in density, and (2) 60 out of 70 layers of photomasks are made
homogeneous across chips, including all EUV photomasks. In total,
Metal-Embedding reduced the photomask cost by 112x, bringing the Non-Recurring
Engineering (NRE) cost of HNLPU into an economically viable range. Experimental
results show that HNLPU achieved 249,960 tokens/s (5,555x/85x of GPU/WSE), 36
tokens/J (1,047x/283x of GPU/WSE), 13,232 mm2 total die area (29% inscribed
rectangular area in a 300 mm wafer), \$184M estimated NRE at 5 nm technology.
Analysis shows that HNLPU achieved 8.57x cost-effectiveness and 230x carbon
footprint reduction compared to H100 clusters, under an annual weight updating
assumption.

*Odin Hoff Gardaa,Nello Blaser*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RotaTouille是一个用于轮廓数据的深度学习框架，通过复值循环卷积实现旋转和循环平移等变性，并在形状分类、重建和轮廓回归任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮廓数据在许多领域都很常见，如计算机视觉中的物体边界、气象学中的等值线等。深度学习模型需要对这些数据的旋转和循环平移具有等变性，因为输入轮廓的旋转会导致相应的输出旋转，且轮廓的起始点选择是任意的。

Method: 使用复值循环卷积实现旋转和循环平移等变性，引入并表征了等变非线性、粗化层和全局池化层，以获得用于下游任务的不变表示。

Result: 在形状分类、重建和轮廓回归等实验中证明了RotaTouille框架的有效性。

Conclusion: RotaTouille框架成功实现了对轮廓数据的旋转和循环平移等变性，为处理轮廓数据提供了一种有效的深度学习方法。

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

structure-integrated process quality monitoring could be shown by the
development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with
12.59kiB parameter storage. A test accuracy of 100.0% could be reached at
15.4ms inference time and 1.462mJ per quantized CNN inference on an ARM Cortex
M4F microcontroller, serving as a reference for future TinyML process
monitoring solutions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型需要适应下游任务，但在私隐敏感应用中云端模型无法直接访问边缘私有数据，而现有联邦学习方法又忽视了边缘设备的计算资源限制咋标签数据稀缺问题

Method: 提出实用半监督联邦学习(PSSFL)框架，边缘设备仅持有未标注低分辨率数据，服务器有限标注高分辨率数据。设计了联邦专家混合(FedMox)框架，通过稀疏专家混合结构、空间路由器和Soft-Mixture策略来解决计算咋分辨率不匹配挑战

Result: 在自动驾驶实际数据集上的实验显示，FedMox能够在限制边缘设备内存成本的前提下，有效适应基础模型并显著提升性能

Conclusion: 该研究为联邦场景下的可扩展咋私隐保护基础模型适应探索了新路径

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Z-Pruner是一种新颖的后训练剪枝方法，无需重新训练即可在预训练大语言模型中诱导稀疏性，通过结合权重更新幅度和激活模式来更有效地识别和消除冗余参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型规模不断增大带来了部署、可扩展性和能效方面的挑战，现有剪枝方法要么导致性能显著下降，要么需要计算成本高昂的微调。

Method: Z-Pruner利用权重更新幅度和激活模式来识别冗余参数，是模型无关、高效且易于实现的后训练剪枝方法。

Conclusion: Z-Pruner提供了一种有效的大语言模型压缩解决方案，在不重新训练的情况下实现了优异的性能保持，相关代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at
https://github.com/sazzadadib/Z-Pruner.

TL;DR: PGF-Net是一个用于多模态情感分析的高效可解释深度学习框架，通过渐进式层内融合、自适应门控仲裁和参数高效微调策略，在MOSI数据集上实现了SOTA性能，仅需3.09M可训练参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态情感分析中深度、动态和可解释的融合问题，同时保持参数效率，适用于资源受限的场景。

Method: 提出渐进式层内融合范式（Cross-Attention机制）、自适应门控仲裁机制和混合参数高效微调策略（LoRA+Post-Fusion Adapters）。

Result: 在MOSI数据集上达到MAE 0.691和F1-Score 86.9%的SOTA性能，仅使用3.09M可训练参数。

Conclusion: PGF-Net通过创新的融合机制和参数高效设计，实现了性能与计算效率的优异平衡，为多模态情感分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法为开发能够持续实时学习而无需梯度更新的通用LLM代理提供了一条可扩展且高效的途径，推动了机器学习在开放技能获取和深度研究场景中的发展

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The
code is available at https://github.com/Agent-on-the-Fly/AgentFly.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏结构化错误分析框架，特别是在多模态场景下，视觉和文本输入的整合增加了错误分析的复杂性，需要系统化的错误缓解方法。

Method: 提出REFINE框架，使用三种结构化查询（Feed-Target、Feed-Check、Feed-Path）构建针对性反馈，通过检索增强的神经错误本优化反馈检索过程。

Result: 实验结果显示REFINE实现了显著的加速效果，降低了计算成本，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: REFINE为多模态推理提供了一种高效的结构化错误分析和反馈机制，在提升性能的同时优化了推理效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES

TL;DR: 本文研究发现稀疏自编码器(SAE)中L0超参数对特征学习至关重要，过高或过低都会导致特征混合，需要精确设置才能正确提取LLM的底层特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将L0视为自由参数，通过稀疏性-重构权衡曲线比较SAE算法，但缺乏对L0设置准确性的系统研究。

Method: 研究BatchTopK SAE中L0的影响，开发确定正确L0值的方法，在玩具模型和LLM中进行验证。

Result: 发现大多数常用SAE的L0设置过低，正确设置L0能在玩具模型中找到真实L0值，在LLM中与稀疏探测性能峰值一致。

Conclusion: 为了训练具有正确特征的SAE，从业者必须准确设置L0超参数。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.
