### [1] [Contextual Augmentation for Entity Linking using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18888)
*Daniel Vollmers,Hamada M. Zahera,Diego Moussallem,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种联合实体识别与消歧的统一框架，利用大语言模型丰富实体上下文，在跨领域数据集上达到最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统实体链接方法采用分离的实体识别和消歧两步流程，计算量大且效果有限。

Method: 使用微调模型在统一框架中联合处理实体识别和消歧，并利用大语言模型增强实体上下文表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上与多个基线方法比较，在跨领域数据集上取得了最优性能。

Conclusion: 联合框架结合大语言模型能有效提升实体链接性能，特别是在跨领域场景下表现优异。

Abstract: Entity Linking involves detecting and linking entity mentions in natural
language texts to a knowledge graph. Traditional methods use a two-step process
with separate models for entity recognition and disambiguation, which can be
computationally intensive and less effective. We propose a fine-tuned model
that jointly integrates entity recognition and disambiguation in a unified
framework. Furthermore, our approach leverages large language models to enrich
the context of entity mentions, yielding better performance in entity
disambiguation. We evaluated our approach on benchmark datasets and compared
with several baselines. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance on out-of-domain datasets.

### [2] [Small Language Models Offer Significant Potential for Science Community](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18890)
*Jian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个使用小型语言模型(MiniLMs)从地球科学文献中精确、快速、低成本检索信息的框架，替代计算成本高的大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在科学文献处理中存在信息偏见和计算成本高的问题，需要更精确、经济高效的替代方案。

Method: 构建包含约7700万高质量句子的地球科学文献语料库，使用MiniLMs通过语义搜索和句子级索引进行高效信息检索，并结合情感分析和无监督聚类分析。

Result: MiniLMs能够有效提取专家验证的定量信息，追踪科学结论演变和研究趋势，优于生成通用回答的LLMs。

Conclusion: MiniLM在地球科学领域具有巨大潜力，可用于事实检索、趋势分析、矛盾分析和教育应用。

Abstract: Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large
language models (LLMs), are transforming how scientists engage with the
literature. While the adoption of LLMs is increasing, concerns remain regarding
potential information biases and computational costs. Rather than LLMs, I
developed a framework to evaluate the feasibility of precise, rapid, and
cost-effective information retrieval from extensive geoscience literature using
freely available small language models (MiniLMs). A curated corpus of
approximately 77 million high-quality sentences, extracted from 95 leading
peer-reviewed geoscience journals such as Geophysical Research Letters and
Earth and Planetary Science Letters published during years 2000 to 2024, was
constructed. MiniLMs enable a computationally efficient approach for extracting
relevant domain-specific information from these corpora through semantic search
techniques and sentence-level indexing. This approach, unlike LLMs such as
ChatGPT-4 that often produces generalized responses, excels at identifying
substantial amounts of expert-verified information with established,
multi-disciplinary sources, especially for information with quantitative
findings. Furthermore, by analyzing emotional tone via sentiment analysis and
topical clusters through unsupervised clustering within sentences, MiniLM
provides a powerful tool for tracking the evolution of conclusions, research
priorities, advancements, and emerging questions within geoscience communities.
Overall, MiniLM holds significant potential within the geoscience community for
applications such as fact and image retrievals, trend analyses, contradiction
analyses, and educational purposes.

### [3] [When Models Can't Follow: Testing Instruction Adherence Across 256 LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18892)
*Richard J. Young,Brandon Gillins,Alice M. Matthews*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个简化的评估框架，使用20个精心设计的提示来评估LLM的指令遵循能力，通过大规模实证研究测试了256个模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法存在挑战，新模型可能在现有基准上训练导致记忆性能而非真实能力，需要新的评估方法来诊断特定指令遵循模式。

Method: 使用20个精心设计的提示构建紧凑测试套件，评估格式合规性、内容约束、逻辑排序和多步骤任务执行等指令遵循方面，测试了256个经过验证的模型。

Result: 发现了持续存在的故障模式，识别出特定指令类型带来的挑战，提供了主要提供商和新兴实现的比较性能分析。

Conclusion: 这项工作既提供了实用的评估工具，也提供了当代LLM指令遵循能力最全面的实证分析之一。

Abstract: Despite widespread deployment of Large Language Models, systematic evaluation
of instruction-following capabilities remains challenging. While comprehensive
benchmarks exist, focused assessments that quickly diagnose specific
instruction adherence patterns are valuable. As newer models may be trained on
existing benchmarks, novel evaluation approaches are needed to assess genuine
capabilities rather than memorized performance. This paper presents a
streamlined evaluation framework using twenty carefully designed prompts to
assess LLM instruction-following across diverse task categories. We demonstrate
this framework through a large-scale empirical study conducted on October 14,
2025, testing 256 verified working models from 331 available via OpenRouter. To
ensure methodological rigor and prevent selection bias, we first verified each
model's basic functionality before inclusion. Unlike large-scale benchmarks
requiring extensive computational resources, our approach offers a practical
diagnostic tool researchers and practitioners can readily apply. Our
methodology builds upon verifiable instructions while introducing a compact
test suite balancing comprehensiveness with efficiency. Each prompt targets
distinct aspects of instruction following, including format compliance, content
constraints, logical sequencing, and multi-step task execution. We evaluate
models from major providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Mistral) and
emerging implementations (Qwen, DeepSeek, community models), providing
comparative performance analysis. Our findings reveal consistent failure modes
and identify specific instruction types posing particular challenges. This work
contributes both a practical evaluation tool and one of the most comprehensive
empirical analyses of instruction-following capabilities across the
contemporary LLM landscape.

### [4] [Transformer-Based Low-Resource Language Translation: A Study on Standard Bengali to Sylheti](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18898)
*Mangsura Kabir Oni,Tabia Tanzin Prama*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了孟加拉语到锡尔赫特语的机器翻译，通过微调多语言Transformer模型并与零样本大语言模型比较，发现微调模型显著优于LLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机器翻译在高资源语言上取得了显著进展，但低资源语言如锡尔赫特语仍然研究不足，需要开发更包容的语言技术。

Method: 通过微调多语言Transformer模型（如mBART-50和MarianMT），并与零样本大语言模型进行对比实验。

Result: 微调模型显著优于LLMs，其中mBART-50在翻译充分性方面表现最佳，MarianMT在字符级保真度方面最强。

Conclusion: 任务特定适配对于代表性不足的语言至关重要，这有助于推动包容性语言技术的发展。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) has advanced from rule-based and statistical methods
to neural approaches based on the Transformer architecture. While these methods
have achieved impressive results for high-resource languages, low-resource
varieties such as Sylheti remain underexplored. In this work, we investigate
Bengali-to-Sylheti translation by fine-tuning multilingual Transformer models
and comparing them with zero-shot large language models (LLMs). Experimental
results demonstrate that fine-tuned models significantly outperform LLMs, with
mBART-50 achieving the highest translation adequacy and MarianMT showing the
strongest character-level fidelity. These findings highlight the importance of
task-specific adaptation for underrepresented languages and contribute to
ongoing efforts toward inclusive language technologies.

### [5] [DuoLens: A Framework for Robust Detection of Machine-Generated Multilingual Text and Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18904)
*Shriyansh Agrawal,Aidan Lau,Sanyam Shah,Ahan M R,Kevin Zhu,Sunishchal Dev,Vasu Sharma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出通过微调小型语言模型(SLMs)来检测机器生成内容，相比大型语言模型(LLMs)在计算效率和准确性方面都有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于零样本方法的机器生成内容检测器存在计算成本高或准确性不足的问题，需要在准确性和效率之间做出权衡。

Method: 微调编码器专用的小型语言模型(RoBERTA和CodeBERTa)，使用专门的源代码和自然语言数据集进行二元分类任务训练。

Result: 模型在AUROC指标上达到0.97-0.99，宏F1分数达到0.89-0.94，延迟降低8-12倍，峰值显存减少3-5倍。在跨生成器迁移和对抗性转换下，性能保持≥92%的清洁AUROC。

Conclusion: 对于二元分类任务，小型语言模型在显著降低计算成本的同时，性能远超大型语言模型，证明了SLMs在机器生成内容检测任务中的有效性。

Abstract: The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating multilingual
text and source code has only increased the imperative for machine-generated
content detectors to be accurate and efficient across domains. Current
detectors, predominantly utilizing zero-shot methods, such as Fast DetectGPT or
GPTZero, either incur high computational cost or lack sufficient accuracy,
often with a trade-off between the two, leaving room for further improvement.
To address these gaps, we propose the fine-tuning of encoder-only Small
Language Models (SLMs), in particular, the pre-trained models of RoBERTA and
CodeBERTa using specialized datasets on source code and other natural language
to prove that for the task of binary classification, SLMs outperform LLMs by a
huge margin whilst using a fraction of compute. Our encoders achieve AUROC $=
0.97$ to $0.99$ and macro-F1 $0.89$ to $0.94$ while reducing latency by
$8$-$12\times$ and peak VRAM by $3$-$5\times$ at $512$-token inputs. Under
cross-generator shifts and adversarial transformations (paraphrase,
back-translation; code formatting/renaming), performance retains $\geq 92%$ of
clean AUROC. We release training and evaluation scripts with seeds and configs;
a reproducibility checklist is also included.

### [6] [Improving Topic Modeling of Social Media Short Texts with Rephrasing: A Case Study of COVID-19 Related Tweets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18908)
*Wangjiaxuan Xin,Shuhua Yin,Shi Chen,Yaorong Ge*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TM-Rephrase是一个模型无关的框架，利用大语言模型将原始推文重新表述为更标准化的语言，以改进社交媒体短文本的主题建模效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体短文本（如推文）的简洁性、非正式性和噪声限制了传统主题建模的有效性，导致主题不连贯、冗余且难以解释。

Method: 开发TM-Rephrase框架，使用LLMs对原始推文进行两种重新表述策略：通用重新表述和口语转正式重新表述，然后应用多种主题建模方法。

Result: TM-Rephrase提高了主题建模的三个性能指标（主题连贯性、主题独特性和主题多样性），同时减少了大多数主题建模算法的主题冗余，其中口语转正式策略对LDA算法效果最好。

Conclusion: 该研究为公共卫生相关社交媒体分析中的主题建模提供了一种模型无关的增强方法，对改善健康危机及其他重要领域中公众话语的理解具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Social media platforms such as Twitter (now X) provide rich data for
analyzing public discourse, especially during crises such as the COVID-19
pandemic. However, the brevity, informality, and noise of social media short
texts often hinder the effectiveness of traditional topic modeling, producing
incoherent or redundant topics that are often difficult to interpret. To
address these challenges, we have developed \emph{TM-Rephrase}, a
model-agnostic framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to
rephrase raw tweets into more standardized and formal language prior to topic
modeling. Using a dataset of 25,027 COVID-19-related Twitter posts, we
investigate the effects of two rephrasing strategies, general- and
colloquial-to-formal-rephrasing, on multiple topic modeling methods. Results
demonstrate that \emph{TM-Rephrase} improves three metrics measuring topic
modeling performance (i.e., topic coherence, topic uniqueness, and topic
diversity) while reducing topic redundancy of most topic modeling algorithms,
with the colloquial-to-formal strategy yielding the greatest performance gains
and especially for the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm. This study
contributes to a model-agnostic approach to enhancing topic modeling in public
health related social media analysis, with broad implications for improved
understanding of public discourse in health crisis as well as other important
domains.

### [7] [Learning from the Best, Differently: A Diversity-Driven Rethinking on Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18909)
*Hongyi He,Xiao Liu,Zhenghao Lin,Mingni Tang,Yi Cheng,Jintao Wang,Wenjie Li,Peng Cheng,Yeyun Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了正交多样性感知选择(ODiS)算法，通过PCA将多维评分解相关为正交维度，在每个维度选择高分数据，确保预训练数据同时具备高质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分数的数据选择方法会压缩相关维度，导致选出的数据看似高质量但缺乏多样性，造成下游任务性能下降。需要将相关指标分解为正交特征维度。

Method: 1) 从语言质量、知识质量和理解难度等多维度评估数据；2) 使用PCA对多维评分进行解相关，得到正交评估维度；3) 为每个维度训练Roberta评分器；4) 在每个正交维度选择高分数据构建训练集。

Result: ODiS选择的数据维度间重叠率低于2%，证实了维度的正交性。使用ODiS选择数据训练的模型在下游基准测试中显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 正交、多样性感知的数据选择对LLM至关重要，ODiS算法能有效平衡数据质量和多样性，提升模型性能。

Abstract: High-quality pre-training data is crutial for large language models, where
quality captures factual reliability and semantic value, and diversity ensures
broad coverage and distributional heterogeneity. Existing approaches typically
rely on single or multiple-dimensional score-based selection. However, directly
selecting top-scored data often degrades performance, and sampling from a
broader range is required to recover results. The above non-monotonicity
between dataset scores and downstream benchmark results reveals a fundamental
bias: score-based methods collapse correlated dimensions, causing top-scored
data to appear high-quality while systematically overlooking diversity. We
argue that ensuring diversity requires decomposing correlated metrics into
orthogonal feature dimensions, from which the top-scored data can be directly
selected. Therefore, we proposed the Orthogonal Diversity-Aware Selection
(ODiS) algorithm, which preserves both quality and diversity during data
selection. First, ODiS evaluates data from multiple dimensions, covering
language quality, knowledge quality, and comprehension difficulty. The
multi-dimensional scores are then decorrelated via Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), yielding orthogonal evaluation dimensions. For each dimension, a
Roberta-based scorer is trained to regress the data onto PCA-projected scores,
enabling scalable inference on large corpora. Finally, ODiS constructs the
training dataset by selecting top-scored data within each orthogonal dimension,
thereby ensuring both quality and diversity. Empirical results show that
ODiS-selected data exhibit less than 2\% inter-dimension overlap, confirming
orthogonality between dimensions. More importantly, models trained with
ODiS-selected data significantly outperform other baselines on downstream
benchmarks, highlighting the necessity of orthogonal, diversity-aware data
selection for LLMs.

### [8] [Context-aware Fairness Evaluation and Mitigation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18914)
*Afrozah Nadeem,Mark Dras,Usman Naseem*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出动态可逆剪枝框架，通过上下文感知的神经元激活检测和自适应掩码，在推理时动态调节有害行为相关神经元的影响，实现细粒度的公平性控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型内部表示中嵌入的不良行为会破坏公平性、产生不一致漂移、放大有害内容，在长对话中传播不良模式。现有训练时方法计算成本高且不可逆，静态剪枝方法无法适应对话上下文变化。

Method: 动态可逆剪枝框架，检测上下文感知的神经元激活，应用自适应掩码在生成过程中调节其影响。推理时解决方案，保持知识的同时实现细粒度、内存感知的缓解。

Result: 在单轮和多轮多语言对话中实现更一致的行为，支持动态公平性控制，适用于现实世界对话AI系统。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种灵活、透明且可适应的方式，在保持模型知识的同时动态控制有害行为，解决了现有方法的静态性和不可逆性问题。

Abstract: Large language models often display undesirable behaviors embedded in their
internal representations, undermining fairness, inconsistency drift,
amplification of harmful content, and the propagation of unwanted patterns
during extended dialogue and conversations. Although training-time or
data-centric methods attempt to reduce these effects, they are computationally
expensive, irreversible once deployed, and slow to adapt to new conversational
contexts. Pruning-based methods provide a flexible and transparent way to
reduce bias by adjusting the neurons responsible for certain behaviors.
However, most existing approaches are static; once a neuron is removed, the
model loses the ability to adapt when the conversation or context changes. To
address this, we propose a dynamic, reversible, pruning-based framework that
detects context-aware neuron activations and applies adaptive masking to
modulate their influence during generation. Our inference-time solution
provides fine-grained, memory-aware mitigation with knowledge-preserved, more
coherent behavior across multilingual single- and multi-turn dialogues,
enabling dynamic fairness control in real-world conversational AI.

*Chen Chen,ZeYang Hu,Fengjiao Chen,Liya Ma,Jiaxing Liu,Xiaoyu Li,Xuezhi Cao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一个新颖的多模态基准测试MMAO-Bench，用于评估单模态和全模态理解能力，包含1880个人工标注样本和44种任务类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型正从单模态理解向融合视觉、音频和语言的全模态模型发展，但单模态与全模态之间的相关性尚不明确，需要全面评估来推动全模态模型的智能进化。

Method: 构建了包含1880个人工标注样本、44种任务类型的基准测试，并创新性地引入了多步骤开放式问题类型来更好评估复杂推理任务。

Result: 实验结果显示跨模态与单模态性能之间存在组合规律，全模态能力在弱模型上表现为瓶颈效应，而在强模型上表现出协同促进作用。

Conclusion: MMAO-Bench是一个高质量、多样化的全模态基准测试，能够有效评估单模态和全模态理解能力，揭示了全模态能力在不同模型上的不同表现模式。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Languages models have been progressing from uni-modal
understanding toward unifying visual, audio and language modalities,
collectively termed omni models. However, the correlation between uni-modal and
omni-modal remains unclear, which requires comprehensive evaluation to drive
omni model's intelligence evolution. In this work, we propose a novel, high
quality and diversity omni model benchmark, MultiModal All in One Benchmark
(MMAO-Bench), which effectively assesses both uni-modal and omni-modal
understanding capabilities. The benchmark consists of 1880 human curated
samples, across 44 task types, and a innovative multi-step open-ended question
type that better assess complex reasoning tasks. Experimental result shows the
compositional law between cross-modal and uni-modal performance and the
omni-modal capability manifests as a bottleneck effect on weak models, while
exhibiting synergistic promotion on strong models.

### [10] [Misinformation Detection using Large Language Models with Explainability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18918)
*Jainee Patel,Chintan Bhatt,Himani Trivedi,Thanh Thi Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于Transformer预训练语言模型的可解释性假新闻检测流程，通过两阶段微调策略优化RoBERTa和DistilBERT，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台上的错误信息传播破坏了用户信任并阻碍知情决策，需要开发高效且可解释的检测方法。

Method: 使用两阶段微调策略：先冻结主干网络训练分类头，然后逐步解冻主干层并应用分层学习率衰减。集成LIME和SHAP提供局部和全局解释。

Result: 在COVID Fake News和FakeNewsNet GossipCop数据集上，DistilBERT达到与RoBERTa相当的准确率，同时显著减少计算资源需求。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型结合原则性微调和可解释性方法，可构建可扩展、可信的错误信息检测框架。

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation on online platforms undermines trust among
individuals and hinders informed decision making. This paper shows an
explainable and computationally efficient pipeline to detect misinformation
using transformer-based pretrained language models (PLMs). We optimize both
RoBERTa and DistilBERT using a two-step strategy: first, we freeze the backbone
and train only the classification head; then, we progressively unfreeze the
backbone layers while applying layer-wise learning rate decay. On two
real-world benchmark datasets, COVID Fake News and FakeNewsNet GossipCop, we
test the proposed approach with a unified protocol of preprocessing and
stratified splits. To ensure transparency, we integrate the Local Interpretable
Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) at the token level to present token-level
rationales and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) at the global feature
attribution level. It demonstrates that DistilBERT achieves accuracy comparable
to RoBERTa while requiring significantly less computational resources. This
work makes two key contributions: (1) it quantitatively shows that a
lightweight PLM can maintain task performance while substantially reducing
computational cost, and (2) it presents an explainable pipeline that retrieves
faithful local and global justifications without compromising performance. The
results suggest that PLMs combined with principled fine-tuning and
interpretability can be an effective framework for scalable, trustworthy
misinformation detection.

### [11] [Evaluating LLM Story Generation through Large-scale Network Analysis of Social Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18932)
*Hiroshi Nonaka,K. E. Perry*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于符号化角色网络分析的新方法，用于评估大语言模型在故事生成中的创造能力，通过分析1200多个故事的网络特性发现LLM生成的故事倾向于紧密的积极关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在复杂任务中的创造能力通常需要难以扩展的人工评估，需要开发可扩展的评估方法。

Method: 通过分析叙事中的符号化角色网络（包括密度、聚类和符号化边权重等网络属性），对四个主流LLM和人类写作语料库生成的1200多个故事进行大规模比较分析。

Result: LLM生成的故事一致表现出对紧密、积极关系的强烈偏向，这与先前使用人工评估的研究发现一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为评估当前和未来LLM在创意故事讲述中的局限性和倾向性提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Evaluating the creative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
complex tasks often requires human assessments that are difficult to scale. We
introduce a novel, scalable methodology for evaluating LLM story generation by
analyzing underlying social structures in narratives as signed character
networks. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we conduct a large-scale
comparative analysis using networks from over 1,200 stories, generated by four
leading LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and Gemini 1.5 Flash) and a
human-written corpus. Our findings, based on network properties like density,
clustering, and signed edge weights, show that LLM-generated stories
consistently exhibit a strong bias toward tightly-knit, positive relationships,
which aligns with findings from prior research using human assessment. Our
proposed approach provides a valuable tool for evaluating limitations and
tendencies in the creative storytelling of current and future LLMs.

*Howard Yen,Ashwin Paranjape,Mengzhou Xia,Thejas Venkatesh,Jack Hessel,Danqi Chen,Yuhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SLIM是一个轻量级信息管理框架，通过分离搜索和浏览工具并定期总结轨迹，解决了长轨迹代理搜索中的上下文限制问题，在保持性能的同时显著降低了成本和工具调用次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的代理搜索框架在处理长轨迹时面临上下文限制问题，包括积累冗长嘈杂内容、达到上下文窗口和工具预算限制、或过早停止，这限制了深度研究系统等强大应用的发展。

Method: SLIM框架将检索分为独立的搜索和浏览工具，并定期总结搜索轨迹，保持上下文简洁的同时支持更长、更专注的搜索。

Result: 在长视野任务上，SLIM以显著更低的成本和更少的工具调用实现了与强大开源基线相当的性能。使用o3作为基础模型时，SLIM在BrowseComp上达到56%，在HLE上达到31%，分别比所有开源框架高出8和4个绝对百分点，同时工具调用次数减少4-6倍。

Conclusion: SLIM框架在长轨迹代理搜索中表现出更少的幻觉，作者希望分析框架和简单工具设计能为未来长视野代理系统提供参考。

Abstract: Long-horizon agentic search requires iteratively exploring the web over long
trajectories and synthesizing information across many sources, and is the
foundation for enabling powerful applications like deep research systems. In
this work, we show that popular agentic search frameworks struggle to scale to
long trajectories primarily due to context limitations-they accumulate long,
noisy content, hit context window and tool budgets, or stop early. Then, we
introduce SLIM (Simple Lightweight Information Management), a simple framework
that separates retrieval into distinct search and browse tools, and
periodically summarizes the trajectory, keeping context concise while enabling
longer, more focused searches. On long-horizon tasks, SLIM achieves comparable
performance at substantially lower cost and with far fewer tool calls than
strong open-source baselines across multiple base models. Specifically, with o3
as the base model, SLIM achieves 56% on BrowseComp and 31% on HLE,
outperforming all open-source frameworks by 8 and 4 absolute points,
respectively, while incurring 4-6x fewer tool calls. Finally, we release an
automated fine-grained trajectory analysis pipeline and error taxonomy for
characterizing long-horizon agentic search frameworks; SLIM exhibits fewer
hallucinations than prior systems. We hope our analysis framework and simple
tool design inform future long-horizon agents.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ProfBench是一个包含7000多个专家评估响应的基准测试，用于评估LLM在专业文档处理、信息综合和报告生成方面的能力，通过构建经济高效的LLM-Judges将评估成本降低2-3个数量级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM评估主要局限于数学、编程等可验证任务，而现实应用需要评估LLM处理专业文档、综合信息和生成全面报告的能力。

Method: 构建ProfBench基准，包含物理博士、化学博士、金融MBA和咨询MBA领域的7000多个专家评估响应对，并开发LLM-Judges来减轻自我增强偏见，大幅降低评估成本。

Result: ProfBench对最先进的LLM构成显著挑战，表现最佳的GPT-5-high模型仅达到65.9%的整体性能，发现专有模型和开源模型之间存在明显性能差异。

Conclusion: ProfBench为评估LLM在专业领域任务中的表现提供了公平可访问的基准，揭示了扩展思维在处理复杂专业任务中的重要作用。

Abstract: Evaluating progress in large language models (LLMs) is often constrained by
the challenge of verifying responses, limiting assessments to tasks like
mathematics, programming, and short-form question-answering. However, many
real-world applications require evaluating LLMs in processing professional
documents, synthesizing information, and generating comprehensive reports in
response to user queries. We introduce ProfBench: a set of over 7000
response-criterion pairs as evaluated by human-experts with professional
knowledge across Physics PhD, Chemistry PhD, Finance MBA and Consulting MBA. We
build robust and affordable LLM-Judges to evaluate ProfBench rubrics, by
mitigating self-enhancement bias and reducing the cost of evaluation by 2-3
orders of magnitude, to make it fair and accessible to the broader community.
Our findings reveal that ProfBench poses significant challenges even for
state-of-the-art LLMs, with top-performing models like GPT-5-high achieving
only 65.9\% overall performance. Furthermore, we identify notable performance
disparities between proprietary and open-weight models and provide insights
into the role that extended thinking plays in addressing complex,
professional-domain tasks. Data:

Result: OVERBENCH基准测试聚合了不同LLM家族的数据集，提供动态演化的过度敏感视角，能够持续监控防御触发器。

Conclusion: 该框架能够识别静态数据集忽略的漏洞，为语言模型过度敏感问题提供更有效的评估方法。

Abstract: Oversensitivity occurs when language models defensively reject prompts that
are actually benign. This behavior not only disrupts user interactions but also
obscures the boundary between harmful and harmless content. Existing benchmarks
rely on static datasets that degrade overtime as models evolve, leading to data
contamination and diminished evaluative power. To address this, we develop a
framework that dynamically generates model-specific challenging datasets,
capturing emerging defensive patterns and aligning with each model's unique
behavior. Building on this approach, we construct OVERBENCH, a benchmark that
aggregates these datasets across diverse LLM families, encompassing 450,000
samples from 25 models. OVERBENCH provides a dynamic and evolving perspective
on oversensitivity, allowing for continuous monitoring of defensive triggers as
models advance, highlighting vulnerabilities that static datasets overlook.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SCRIPTS数据集，用于评估LLMs在对话中推断人际关系的社会推理能力，发现现有模型在英语和韩语上表现差异显著，且存在选择不可能关系的倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在人际互动中的应用增多，评估其在社交语境中的推理能力变得至关重要。

Method: 构建了包含1000个对话的SCRIPTS数据集，源自电影剧本，涵盖英语和韩语。每个对话由母语者标注概率性关系标签（高度可能、较不可能、不可能）。评估了9个模型。

Result: 专有LLMs在英语数据集上达到75-80%准确率，但在韩语上降至58-69%。模型在10-25%的回答中选择了不可能的关系。思维模型和思维链提示对社会推理帮助有限，有时还会放大社会偏见。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs的社会推理能力存在显著局限，需要开发更具社会意识的语言模型。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in human-AI
interactions, their social reasoning capabilities in interpersonal contexts are
critical. We introduce SCRIPTS, a 1k-dialogue dataset in English and Korean,
sourced from movie scripts. The task involves evaluating models' social
reasoning capability to infer the interpersonal relationships (e.g., friends,
sisters, lovers) between speakers in each dialogue. Each dialogue is annotated
with probabilistic relational labels (Highly Likely, Less Likely, Unlikely) by
native (or equivalent) Korean and English speakers from Korea and the U.S.
Evaluating nine models on our task, current proprietary LLMs achieve around
75-80% on the English dataset, whereas their performance on Korean drops to
58-69%. More strikingly, models select Unlikely relationships in 10-25% of
their responses. Furthermore, we find that thinking models and chain-of-thought
prompting, effective for general reasoning, provide minimal benefits for social
reasoning and occasionally amplify social biases. Our findings reveal
significant limitations in current LLMs' social reasoning capabilities,
highlighting the need for efforts to develop socially-aware language models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两个用于评估心理健康支持LLM的基准：MentalBench-100k包含10万对对话响应，MentalAlign-70k比较了LLM评判者与人类专家在7个属性上的7万个评分，并使用情感认知一致性框架量化一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准在规模、可靠性方面有限，依赖合成或社交媒体数据，缺乏评估自动评判者可信度的框架。需要大规模对话数据集和评判者可靠性评估。

Method: 引入MentalBench-100k（整合3个真实场景数据集的1万次单轮对话，每对话配9个LLM生成响应）和MentalAlign-70k（比较4个高性能LLM评判者与人类专家在7个属性上的评分）。使用情感认知一致性框架，通过组内相关系数量化一致性、一致性和偏差。

Result: 分析显示LLM评判者存在系统性夸大，认知属性（如指导和信息性）可靠性强，同理心精度降低，安全性和相关性存在不可靠性。

Conclusion: 为心理健康领域LLM的可靠、大规模评估建立了新的方法论和实证基础。

Abstract: Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) for mental health support is
challenging due to the emotionally and cognitively complex nature of
therapeutic dialogue. Existing benchmarks are limited in scale, reliability,
often relying on synthetic or social media data, and lack frameworks to assess
when automated judges can be trusted. To address the need for large-scale
dialogue datasets and judge reliability assessment, we introduce two benchmarks
that provide a framework for generation and evaluation. MentalBench-100k
consolidates 10,000 one-turn conversations from three real scenarios datasets,
each paired with nine LLM-generated responses, yielding 100,000 response pairs.
MentalAlign-70k}reframes evaluation by comparing four high-performing LLM
judges with human experts across 70,000 ratings on seven attributes, grouped
into Cognitive Support Score (CSS) and Affective Resonance Score (ARS). We then
employ the Affective Cognitive Agreement Framework, a statistical methodology
using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) with confidence intervals to
quantify agreement, consistency, and bias between LLM judges and human experts.
Our analysis reveals systematic inflation by LLM judges, strong reliability for
cognitive attributes such as guidance and informativeness, reduced precision
for empathy, and some unreliability in safety and relevance. Our contributions
establish new methodological and empirical foundations for reliable,
large-scale evaluation of LLMs in mental health. We release the benchmarks and
codes at: https://github.com/abeerbadawi/MentalBench/

*Suswitha Pericharla,Daniel B. Hier,Tayo Obafemi-Ajayi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型在生物医学术语标准化任务中的表现，发现微调效果取决于标识符的流行度和词汇化程度。基因标识符表现最佳，而GO和HPO等本体由于标识符任意性限制了模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据集成需要将自然语言术语映射到标准化标识符，大型语言模型在此任务中表现不一，需要系统评估其在不同术语体系中的记忆和泛化能力。

Method: 使用Llama 3.1 8B模型在多个生物医学本体上进行微调，评估记忆能力（训练术语表现）和泛化能力（验证术语表现），并进行嵌入分析。

Result: GO映射显示强记忆增益（准确率提升77%），HPO改进最小。仅基因映射实现泛化（13.9%增益）。GPT-4o在所有术语中优于Llama变体。嵌入分析显示基因符号与蛋白质名称语义对齐紧密，而GO和HPO对齐较弱。

Conclusion: 微调成功取决于标识符流行度和词汇化程度。流行标识符增强记忆，词汇化标识符（如基因符号）支持语义泛化，而任意标识符限制模型只能进行机械学习。

Abstract: Effective biomedical data integration depends on automated term
normalization, the mapping of natural language biomedical terms to standardized
identifiers. This linking of terms to identifiers is essential for semantic
interoperability. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for this task but
perform unevenly across terminologies. We evaluated both memorization
(training-term performance) and generalization (validation-term performance)
across multiple biomedical ontologies. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1 8B revealed marked
differences by terminology. GO mappings showed strong memorization gains (up to
77% improvement in term-to-identifier accuracy), whereas HPO showed minimal
improvement. Generalization occurred only for protein-gene (GENE) mappings
(13.9% gain), while fine-tuning for HPO and GO yielded negligible transfer.
Baseline accuracy varied by model scale, with GPT-4o outperforming both Llama
variants for all terminologies. Embedding analyses showed tight semantic
alignment between gene symbols and protein names but weak alignment between
terms and identifiers for GO or HPO, consistent with limited lexicalization.
Fine-tuning success depended on two interacting factors: identifier popularity
and lexicalization. Popular identifiers were more likely encountered during
pretraining, enhancing memorization. Lexicalized identifiers, such as gene
symbols, enabled semantic generalization. By contrast, arbitrary identifiers in
GO and HPO constrained models to rote learning. These findings provide a
predictive framework for when fine-tuning enhances factual recall versus when
it fails due to sparse or non-lexicalized identifiers.

TL;DR: 本文研究大语言模型在参数知识与提示中冲突信息不一致时的行为，将知识冲突研究扩展到代码生成领域，提出了领域无关的框架和评估方法，发现大模型能编码知识冲突概念，并通过激活级引导实现性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在面对参数知识与提示信息冲突时的行为模式，特别是在代码生成领域中的知识冲突问题，为理解模型如何处理矛盾信息提供新视角。

Method: 提出领域无关的知识冲突构建和解释框架，开发专门针对代码冲突场景的新评估方法和数据集，使用激活级引导技术进行实验。

Result: 大型LLMs能在参数中编码知识冲突概念，检测准确率达80.65%；激活级引导相比随机基线提升12.6%的引导成功率，但效果受模型大小、任务领域和引导方向的平衡影响。

Conclusion: LLMs能够识别和处理知识冲突，激活引导是有效的干预手段，但需要综合考虑模型规模、任务特性和引导策略的平衡，为理解模型内部知识表示提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) behave when faced
with discrepancies between their parametric knowledge and conflicting
information contained in a prompt. Building on prior question-answering (QA)
research, we extend the investigation of knowledge conflicts to the realm of
code generation. We propose a domain-agnostic framework for constructing and
interpreting such conflicts, along with a novel evaluation method and dataset
tailored to code conflict scenarios. Our experiments indicate that sufficiently
large LLMs encode the notion of a knowledge conflict in their parameters,
enabling us to detect knowledge conflicts with up to \textbf{80.65\%} accuracy.
Building on these insights, we show that activation-level steering can achieve
up to a \textbf{12.6\%} improvement in steering success over a random baseline.
However, effectiveness depends critically on balancing model size, task domain,
and steering direction. The experiment code and data will be made publicly
available after acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于谱分析的框架，将transformer层建模为注意力诱导的动态图，通过图信号处理定义诊断指标来检测大语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然表现优异，但难以区分事实推理和幻觉，需要开发新的检测方法。

Method: 将transformer层建模为动态图，token嵌入作为图上的信号，通过图信号处理定义Dirichlet能量、谱熵和高频能量比等诊断指标。

Result: 实验发现事实陈述呈现一致的"能量山"行为和低频收敛，而不同类型的幻觉显示不同特征。基于谱特征的简单检测器达到88.75%的准确率，优于基于困惑度的基线方法。

Conclusion: 谱几何可能捕捉推理模式和错误行为，为检测大语言模型中的幻觉提供了潜在框架。

Abstract: Large language models achieve impressive results but distinguishing factual
reasoning from hallucinations remains challenging. We propose a spectral
analysis framework that models transformer layers as dynamic graphs induced by
attention, with token embeddings as signals on these graphs. Through graph
signal processing, we define diagnostics including Dirichlet energy, spectral
entropy, and high-frequency energy ratios, with theoretical connections to
computational stability. Experiments across GPT architectures suggest universal
spectral patterns: factual statements exhibit consistent "energy mountain"
behavior with low-frequency convergence, while different hallucination types
show distinct signatures. Logical contradictions destabilize spectra with large
effect sizes ($g>1.0$), semantic errors remain stable but show connectivity
drift, and substitution hallucinations display intermediate perturbations. A
simple detector using spectral signatures achieves 88.75% accuracy versus 75%
for perplexity-based baselines, demonstrating practical utility. These findings
indicate that spectral geometry may capture reasoning patterns and error
behaviors, potentially offering a framework for hallucination detection in
large language models.

TL;DR: 通过图信号处理分析注意力诱导的token图，研究发现不同transformer架构通过不同的连接模式实现相同的语言计算，形成可检测的"计算指纹"。Phi-3-Mini在英语中表现出显著的早期层扰动，而其他语言影响很小，这与该模型主要为英语使用定位的公开文档一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索不同transformer架构如何通过不同的连接模式实现相同的语言计算，以及训练重点是否会在模型中留下可检测的计算印记。

Method: 使用图信号处理分析注意力诱导的token图，跟踪20种语言和三个模型家族在语态交替下代数连通性（Fiedler值）的变化，重点关注早期窗口（第2-5层）。

Result: 发现清晰的架构特征：Phi-3-Mini在英语中表现出显著的早期层扰动，而其他19种语言影响很小；Qwen2.5-7B显示小的分布式变化，对形态丰富语言影响最大；LLaMA-3.2-1B表现出系统但较弱的响应。这些光谱特征与行为差异强相关。

Conclusion: 训练重点可以在模型中留下可检测的计算印记，表现为在句法转换期间可测量的连接模式。该框架可区分推理模式，作为简单、无需训练的诊断工具，用于揭示架构偏见和支持模型可靠性分析。

Abstract: Different transformer architectures implement identical linguistic
computations via distinct connectivity patterns, yielding model imprinted
``computational fingerprints'' detectable through spectral analysis. Using
graph signal processing on attention induced token graphs, we track changes in
algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value, $\Delta\lambda_2$) under voice
alternation across 20 languages and three model families, with a prespecified
early window (layers 2--5). Our analysis uncovers clear architectural
signatures: Phi-3-Mini shows a dramatic English specific early layer disruption
($\overline{\Delta\lambda_2}_{[2,5]}\!\approx\!-0.446$) while effects in 19
other languages are minimal, consistent with public documentation that
positions the model primarily for English use. Qwen2.5-7B displays small,
distributed shifts that are largest for morphologically rich languages, and
LLaMA-3.2-1B exhibits systematic but muted responses. These spectral signatures
correlate strongly with behavioral differences (Phi-3: $r=-0.976$) and are
modulated by targeted attention head ablations, linking the effect to early
attention structure and confirming functional relevance. Taken together, the
findings are consistent with the view that training emphasis can leave
detectable computational imprints: specialized processing strategies that
manifest as measurable connectivity patterns during syntactic transformations.
Beyond voice alternation, the framework differentiates reasoning modes,
indicating utility as a simple, training free diagnostic for revealing
architectural biases and supporting model reliability analysis.

Abstract: Tibetan, one of the major low-resource languages in Asia, presents unique
linguistic and sociocultural characteristics that pose both challenges and
opportunities for AI research. Despite increasing interest in developing AI
systems for underrepresented languages, Tibetan has received limited attention
due to a lack of accessible data resources, standardized benchmarks, and
dedicated tools. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the current
state of Tibetan AI in the AI domain, covering textual and speech data
resources, NLP tasks, machine translation, speech recognition, and recent
developments in LLMs. We systematically categorize existing datasets and tools,
evaluate methods used across different tasks, and compare performance where
possible. We also identify persistent bottlenecks such as data sparsity,
orthographic variation, and the lack of unified evaluation metrics.
Additionally, we discuss the potential of cross-lingual transfer, multi-modal
learning, and community-driven resource creation. This survey aims to serve as
a foundational reference for future work on Tibetan AI research and encourages
collaborative efforts to build an inclusive and sustainable AI ecosystem for
low-resource languages.

Motivation: 随着互联网和人工智能的快速发展，科技公司需要高效地从大量申请者中筛选出高潜力的软件和算法工程师。鉴于LLMs在编码和推理任务上的强大能力，研究它们是否能通过标准化招聘评估具有重要意义。

Method: 采用最先进的LLMs对广泛使用的专业评估问卷生成回答，然后将模型生成的答案与公司参考解决方案进行比较评估。

Result: 研究发现模型生成的答案与公司参考解决方案之间存在显著不一致，所有评估的LLMs都未能通过招聘评估。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs在编码和推理任务上表现出色，但在实际的科技公司招聘评估中，它们目前还无法达到通过标准，表明LLMs在专业工程评估方面仍有局限性。

Abstract: With the proliferation of the internet and the rapid advancement of
Artificial Intelligence, leading technology companies face an urgent annual
demand for a considerable number of software and algorithm engineers. To
efficiently and effectively identify high-potential candidates from thousands
of applicants, these firms have established a multi-stage selection process,
which crucially includes a standardized hiring evaluation designed to assess
job-specific competencies. Motivated by the demonstrated prowess of Large
Language Models (LLMs) in coding and reasoning tasks, this paper investigates a
critical question: Can LLMs successfully pass these hiring evaluations? To this
end, we conduct a comprehensive examination of a widely used professional
assessment questionnaire. We employ state-of-the-art LLMs to generate responses
and subsequently evaluate their performance. Contrary to any prior expectation
of LLMs being ideal engineers, our analysis reveals a significant inconsistency
between the model-generated answers and the company-referenced solutions. Our
empirical findings lead to a striking conclusion: All evaluated LLMs fails to
pass the hiring evaluation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多跳RAG方法存在效率低下问题，包括重复生成可预测令牌序列和随机停止机制，导致令牌使用过多和终止不稳定。

Method: TSSS包含两个核心组件：(1) 基于模板的推理，缓存重复前缀并将子查询锚定到主问题；(2) 基于检索器的终止器，当额外子查询出现重复时确定性地停止推理。

Result: 在HotpotQA、2WikiMultiHop和MuSiQue数据集上，TSSS在RAG-CoT方法中实现了最先进的准确率和有竞争力的效率。

Conclusion: TSSS通过分离结构化推理和终止控制，在效率受限场景（如设备端推理）中表现出色，实现了更快推理和更可靠答案。

Abstract: Multi-hop retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a promising strategy for
complex reasoning, yet existing iterative prompting approaches remain
inefficient. They often regenerate predictable token sequences at every step
and rely on stochastic stopping, leading to excessive token usage and unstable
termination. We propose TSSS (Think Straight, Stop Smart), a structured
multi-hop RAG framework designed for efficiency. TSSS introduces (i) a
template-based reasoning that caches recurring prefixes and anchors sub-queries
to the main question, reducing token generation cost while promoting stable
reasoning, and (ii) a retriever-based terminator, which deterministically halts
reasoning once additional sub-queries collapse into repetition. This separation
of structured reasoning and termination control enables both faster inference
and more reliable answers. On HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue, TSSS
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and competitive efficiency among RAG-CoT
approaches, highlighting its effectiveness in efficiency-constrained scenarios
such as on-device inference.

Motivation: 现有研究使用基于结构化知识库的基准来评估时间知识冲突，但存在覆盖范围有限、缺乏动态结构等问题，无法公平评估不同知识截止日期的LLMs。

Method: 从AWS更新、Azure变更和WHO疾病爆发报告3个真实世界时间戳语料库中识别自然发生的知识演化，生成针对不同LLM知识截止日期的定制化问题和答案。

Result: 对12个开源和闭源LLMs在3种知识探测格式上的评估显示，相比静态知识问题，在evolveQA上的性能下降高达31%。

Conclusion: evolveQA基准有效揭示了LLMs在处理时间演化知识时的显著性能下降，为评估LLMs的时间知识处理能力提供了更公平和全面的框架。

Abstract: LLMs often fail to handle temporal knowledge conflicts--contradictions
arising when facts evolve over time within their training data. Existing
studies evaluate this phenomenon through benchmarks built on structured
knowledge bases like Wikidata, but they focus on widely-covered,
easily-memorized popular entities and lack the dynamic structure needed to
fairly evaluate LLMs with different knowledge cut-off dates. We introduce
evolveQA, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on temporally
evolving knowledge, constructed from 3 real-world, time-stamped corpora: AWS
updates, Azure changes, and WHO disease outbreak reports. Our framework
identifies naturally occurring knowledge evolution and generates questions with
gold answers tailored to different LLM knowledge cut-off dates. Through
extensive evaluation of 12 open and closed-source LLMs across 3 knowledge
probing formats, we demonstrate significant performance drops of up to 31% on
evolveQA compared to static knowledge questions.

Abstract: This paper presents a question answering system that operates exclusively on
a knowledge graph retrieval without relying on retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) with large language models (LLMs). Instead, a small paraphraser model is
used to paraphrase the entity relationship edges retrieved from querying the
knowledge graph. The proposed pipeline is divided into two main stages. The
first stage involves pre-processing a document to generate sets of
question-answer (QA) pairs. The second stage converts these QAs into a
knowledge graph from which graph-based retrieval is performed using embeddings
and fuzzy techniques. The graph is queried, re-ranked, and paraphrased to
generate a final answer. This work includes an evaluation using LLM-as-a-judge
on the CRAG benchmark, which resulted in accuracies of 71.9% and 54.4% using
LLAMA-3.2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo, respectively.

Abstract: Evaluating conversational AI systems that use external tools is challenging,
as errors can arise from complex interactions among user, agent, and tools.
While existing evaluation methods assess either user satisfaction or agents'
tool-calling capabilities, they fail to capture critical errors in multi-turn
tool-augmented dialogues-such as when agents misinterpret tool results yet
appear satisfactory to users. We introduce TRACE, a benchmark of systematically
synthesized tool-augmented conversations covering diverse error cases, and
SCOPE, an evaluation framework that automatically discovers diverse error
patterns and evaluation rubrics in tool-augmented dialogues. Experiments show
SCOPE significantly outperforms the baseline, particularly on challenging cases
where user satisfaction signals are misleading.

Motivation: 现有路由系统依赖集中式外部路由器，无法充分理解不同LLM的知识边界，导致性能不佳且缺乏灵活性。

Method: 采用分布式路由范式，每个LLM代理独立判断自身能力；提出两阶段自我意识训练流程增强LLM的自我认知能力。

Result: DiSRouter在各种场景下显著优于现有路由方法，能有效区分简单和困难查询，并在域外任务上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 利用LLM内在的自我意识比外部评估更有效，为构建更模块化和高效的多代理系统开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created a diverse
ecosystem of models with highly varying performance and costs, necessitating
effective query routing to balance performance and expense. Current routing
systems often rely on a centralized external router trained on a fixed set of
LLMs, making them inflexible and prone to poor performance since the small
router can not fully understand the knowledge boundaries of different LLMs. We
introduce DiSRouter (Distributed Self-Router), a novel paradigm that shifts
from centralized control to distributed routing. In DiSRouter, a query
traverses a network of LLM agents, each independently deciding whether to
answer or route to other agents based on its own self-awareness, its ability to
judge its competence. This distributed design offers superior flexibility,
scalability, and generalizability. To enable this, we propose a two-stage
Self-Awareness Training pipeline that enhances each LLM's self-awareness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiSRouter significantly outperforms
existing routing methods in utility across various scenarios, effectively
distinguishes between easy and hard queries, and shows strong generalization to
out-of-domain tasks. Our work validates that leveraging an LLM's intrinsic
self-awareness is more effective than external assessment, paving the way for
more modular and efficient multi-agent systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种类型匹配的语言距离框架，通过结构感知表示解决现有语言知识库的局限性，并开发了统一多种距离信号的复合距离方法，在跨语言迁移任务中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言知识库（如URIEL+）存在两个关键局限：一是其通用向量表示不适合语言数据的多样化结构，二是缺乏将这些信号聚合为单一综合分数的原则性方法。

Method: 提出类型匹配语言距离框架，为每种距离类型设计结构感知表示：地理距离使用说话者加权分布，谱系距离使用双曲嵌入，类型学距离使用潜变量模型，并将这些信号统一为鲁棒的任务无关复合距离。

Result: 在跨语言迁移任务中，所提出的表示方法和复合距离在广泛的NLP任务中持续提升性能表现。

Conclusion: 该框架为多语言研究提供了更原则性和有效的工具包，通过结构感知表示和统一距离信号显著改善了跨语言迁移的效果。

Abstract: Existing linguistic knowledge bases such as URIEL+ provide valuable
geographic, genetic and typological distances for cross-lingual transfer but
suffer from two key limitations. One, their one-size-fits-all vector
representations are ill-suited to the diverse structures of linguistic data,
and two, they lack a principled method for aggregating these signals into a
single, comprehensive score. In this paper, we address these gaps by
introducing a framework for type-matched language distances. We propose novel,
structure-aware representations for each distance type: speaker-weighted
distributions for geography, hyperbolic embeddings for genealogy, and a latent
variables model for typology. We unify these signals into a robust,
task-agnostic composite distance. In selecting transfer languages, our
representations and composite distances consistently improve performance across
a wide range of NLP tasks, providing a more principled and effective toolkit
for multilingual research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在理解和推理复杂电子表格方面存在困难，难以准确捕捉表格的复杂结构并确保推理正确性。

Method: SheetBrain包含三个核心模块：理解模块生成电子表格的全面概览；执行模块集成Python沙箱和Excel工具包进行多轮推理；验证模块验证推理和答案的正确性，必要时触发重新执行。

Result: 在多个公共表格问答和操作基准测试上，SheetBrain显著提高了准确性，特别是在新提出的SheetBench基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: SheetBrain框架通过神经符号双工作流方法有效解决了LLMs在复杂电子表格推理中的挑战，为表格数据处理提供了更准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning over complex spreadsheets remain fundamental
challenges for large language models (LLMs), which often struggle with
accurately capturing the complex structure of tables and ensuring reasoning
correctness. In this work, we propose SheetBrain, a neuro-symbolic dual
workflow agent framework designed for accurate reasoning over tabular data,
supporting both spreadsheet question answering and manipulation tasks.
SheetBrain comprises three core modules: an understanding module, which
produces a comprehensive overview of the spreadsheet - including sheet summary
and query-based problem insight to guide reasoning; an execution module, which
integrates a Python sandbox with preloaded table-processing libraries and an
Excel helper toolkit for effective multi-turn reasoning; and a validation
module, which verifies the correctness of reasoning and answers, triggering
re-execution when necessary. We evaluate SheetBrain on multiple public tabular
QA and manipulation benchmarks, and introduce SheetBench, a new benchmark
targeting large, multi-table, and structurally complex spreadsheets.
Experimental results show that SheetBrain significantly improves accuracy on
both existing benchmarks and the more challenging scenarios presented in
SheetBench. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型和直接偏好优化技术的难度可控多项选择题生成方法，用于阅读理解任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前难度可控问题生成方法存在两个主要局限：无法直接生成多项选择题（教育中最常用的题型），以及没有明确训练来优化难度控制的准确性。

Method: 使用大语言模型，并采用直接偏好优化技术来训练模型，以提高难度控制的准确性。

Result: 该方法能够直接生成难度可控的多项选择题，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在教育领域的自适应学习支持中具有重要应用价值，能够更准确地控制问题难度并生成实用的多项选择题。

Abstract: Difficulty-controllable question generation for reading comprehension has
gained significant attention in the field of education as a fundamental tool
for adaptive learning support. Although several neural question generation
methods have recently succeeded in controlling difficulty, conventional
approaches still face two major limitations. First, they cannot directly
generate multiple-choice questions, which are the most widely used question
type in educational contexts. Second, they are not explicitly trained to
optimize the accuracy of difficulty control, leaving room for further
improvement in difficulty controllability. To address these limitations, this
study proposes a novel difficulty-controllable multiple-choice question
generation method for reading comprehension which leverages a large language
model trained using a direct preference optimization technique to improve the
accuracy of difficulty control.

TL;DR: TheMCPCompany是一个用于评估工具调用代理在真实世界服务交互任务中的基准，包含超过18,000个工具。研究表明，高级推理模型在简单环境中能有效发现工具，但在复杂企业环境中导航数万工具仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通用代理主要依赖网络浏览器与环境交互，而MCP协议带来了大量任务专用工具，这些工具比通用工具更易开发维护。需要评估工具调用代理在真实服务交互中的表现。

Method: 使用真实服务的REST API创建MCP服务器，包含18,000多个工具，并为每个任务提供手动标注的真实工具。实验比较了完美工具检索和实际工具检索下的代理性能。

Result: 使用真实工具时，所有模型性能都优于或等于浏览器代理。小模型无法通过检索充分利用可用工具，而GPT-5在工具检索下的性能接近其使用真实工具的性能。

Conclusion: 当前模型在导航数万工具并以非平凡方式组合解决复杂问题方面仍面临挑战，需要更好的推理和检索模型。最先进的推理模型在简单环境中能有效发现工具，但在复杂企业环境中表现严重受限。

Abstract: Since the introduction of the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the number of
available tools for Large Language Models (LLMs) has increased significantly.
These task-specific tool sets offer an alternative to general-purpose tools
such as web browsers, while being easier to develop and maintain than GUIs.
However, current general-purpose agents predominantly rely on web browsers for
interacting with the environment. Here, we introduce TheMCPCompany, a benchmark
for evaluating tool-calling agents on tasks that involve interacting with
various real-world services. We use the REST APIs of these services to create
MCP servers, which include over 18,000 tools. We also provide manually
annotated ground-truth tools for each task. In our experiments, we use the
ground truth tools to show the potential of tool-calling agents for both
improving performance and reducing costs assuming perfect tool retrieval. Next,
we explore agent performance using tool retrieval to study the real-world
practicality of tool-based agents. While all models with tool retrieval perform
similarly or better than browser-based agents, smaller models cannot take full
advantage of the available tools through retrieval. On the other hand, GPT-5's
performance with tool retrieval is very close to its performance with
ground-truth tools. Overall, our work shows that the most advanced reasoning
models are effective at discovering tools in simpler environments, but
seriously struggle with navigating complex enterprise environments.
TheMCPCompany reveals that navigating tens of thousands of tools and combining
them in non-trivial ways to solve complex problems is still a challenging task
for current models and requires both better reasoning and better retrieval
models.

TL;DR: 提出JointCQ框架，通过联合生成claim和query来改进幻觉检测流程，在多个开放域QA基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs存在幻觉问题，现有检测方法在claim提取和query生成阶段存在上下文丢失和特异性不足等局限性。

Method: 设计联合claim-query生成框架，使用精心设计的评估标准筛选合成训练数据，微调语言模型进行联合claim提取和query生成。

Result: 在多个开放域QA幻觉检测基准测试中表现优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现更可信和透明的语言模型系统做出了贡献。

Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) often suffer from hallucination issues,
i,e, generating content that appears factual but is actually unreliable. A
typical hallucination detection pipeline involves response decomposition (i.e.,
claim extraction), query generation, evidence collection (i.e., search or
retrieval), and claim verification. However, existing methods exhibit
limitations in the first two stages, such as context loss during claim
extraction and low specificity in query generation, resulting in degraded
performance across the hallucination detection pipeline. In this work, we
introduce JointCQ https://github.com/pku0xff/JointCQ, a joint claim-and-query
generation framework designed to construct an effective and efficient
claim-query generator. Our framework leverages elaborately designed evaluation
criteria to filter synthesized training data, and finetunes a language model
for joint claim extraction and query generation, providing reliable and
informative inputs for downstream search and verification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods on multiple
open-domain QA hallucination detection benchmarks, advancing the goal of more
trustworthy and transparent language model systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: KORE是一种协同方法，通过知识导向的增强和约束，在向大型多模态模型注入新知识的同时保留旧知识，解决了知识适应和知识保留的双重挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在预训练权重中编码了大量事实知识，但这些知识是静态的，无法跟上现实世界的发展，阻碍了持续知识获取。现有方法在学习新知识时往往存在灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: KORE将单个知识项自动转换为结构化知识以确保准确学习新知识，同时将先前知识存储在LMM线性层激活的协方差矩阵中，并通过将原始权重投影到矩阵的零空间来初始化适配器，定义最小化与先前知识干扰的微调方向。

Result: 在LLaVA-v1.5-7B、LLaVA-v1.5-13B和Qwen2.5-VL-7B等多种LMM上的广泛实验表明，KORE实现了优越的新知识注入性能，并有效缓解了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: KORE方法在知识适应和知识保留方面都表现出色，为大型多模态模型的持续知识更新提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models encode extensive factual knowledge in their
pre-trained weights. However, its knowledge remains static and limited, unable
to keep pace with real-world developments, which hinders continuous knowledge
acquisition. Effective knowledge injection thus becomes critical, involving two
goals: knowledge adaptation (injecting new knowledge) and knowledge retention
(preserving old knowledge). Existing methods often struggle to learn new
knowledge and suffer from catastrophic forgetting. To address this, we propose
KORE, a synergistic method of KnOwledge-oRientEd augmentations and constraints
for injecting new knowledge into large multimodal models while preserving old
knowledge. Unlike general text or image data augmentation, KORE automatically
converts individual knowledge items into structured and comprehensive knowledge
to ensure that the model accurately learns new knowledge, enabling accurate
adaptation. Meanwhile, KORE stores previous knowledge in the covariance matrix
of LMM's linear layer activations and initializes the adapter by projecting the
original weights into the matrix's null space, defining a fine-tuning direction
that minimizes interference with previous knowledge, enabling powerful
retention. Extensive experiments on various LMMs, including LLaVA-v1.5-7B,
LLaVA-v1.5-13B, and Qwen2.5-VL-7B, show that KORE achieves superior new
knowledge injection performance and effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting.

Motivation: 随着自然语言生成模型的广泛应用，模型产生可信但错误信息的幻觉问题日益严重，需要有效的检测和修正方法。

Method: 提出包含11类幻觉的全面分类法，开发HAD模型集成检测、识别和修正功能，使用约90K合成样本训练，并构建HADTest测试集。

Result: 在领域内和领域外测试集上，HAD模型普遍优于现有基线，在HaluEval、FactCHD和FaithBench上达到最先进结果。

Conclusion: HAD模型展示了在多种NLG任务中的鲁棒性和通用性，为幻觉检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing reliance on natural language generation (NLG) models,
particularly large language models, has raised concerns about the reliability
and accuracy of their outputs. A key challenge is hallucination, where models
produce plausible but incorrect information. As a result, hallucination
detection has become a critical task. In this work, we introduce a
comprehensive hallucination taxonomy with 11 categories across various NLG
tasks and propose the HAllucination Detection (HAD) models
https://github.com/pku0xff/HAD, which integrate hallucination detection,
span-level identification, and correction into a single inference process.
Trained on an elaborate synthetic dataset of about 90K samples, our HAD models
are versatile and can be applied to various NLG tasks. We also carefully
annotate a test set for hallucination detection, called HADTest, which contains
2,248 samples. Evaluations on in-domain and out-of-domain test sets show that
our HAD models generally outperform the existing baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results on HaluEval, FactCHD, and FaithBench, confirming their
robustness and versatility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本摘要需要同时优化一致性、连贯性、相关性和流畅性等多个目标，现有基于LLM的强化学习方法很少关注多目标优化问题。

Method: 提出超体积优化(HVO)策略，在强化学习的奖励过程中使用超体积方法动态调整组间分数，引导模型逐步逼近帕累托前沿。

Result: 在多个代表性摘要数据集上的实验表明，HVO在总体得分上优于GRPO，在不同维度上表现更平衡，7B基础模型增强后性能可与GPT-4媲美且生成长度更短。

Conclusion: HVO方法能有效解决文本摘要的多目标优化问题，生成更平衡的摘要，且小模型增强后能达到大模型性能水平。

Abstract: Text summarization is a crucial task that requires the simultaneous
optimization of multiple objectives, including consistency, coherence,
relevance, and fluency, which presents considerable challenges. Although large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance, enhanced by
reinforcement learning (RL), few studies have focused on optimizing the
multi-objective problem of summarization through RL based on LLMs. In this
paper, we introduce hypervolume optimization (HVO), a novel optimization
strategy that dynamically adjusts the scores between groups during the reward
process in RL by using the hypervolume method. This method guides the model's
optimization to progressively approximate the pareto front, thereby generating
balanced summaries across multiple objectives. Experimental results on several
representative summarization datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
group relative policy optimization (GRPO) in overall scores and shows more
balanced performance across different dimensions. Moreover, a 7B foundation
model enhanced by HVO performs comparably to GPT-4 in the summarization task,
while maintaining a shorter generation length. Our code is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受推理LLM最新发展的启发，希望将推理能力集成到语音LLM中，以提升槽位填充任务的性能。

Method: 使用思维链框架将槽位填充任务分解为多个推理步骤，创建推理数据集，对语音LLM进行监督微调，区分常规和推理语音LLM，并实验不同类型的文本基础模型。

Result: 引入推理步骤能提升性能，但主要用于数学、逻辑和编码领域的推理文本LLM作为基础模型可能表现较差。混合语音LLM（基于混合文本基础LLM并同时保留直接和推理两种操作模式）比仅使用单一模式的模型性能更好。

Conclusion: 推理能力能有效提升语音LLM在槽位填充任务中的性能，但需要选择合适的文本基础模型，混合操作模式的语音LLM表现最佳。

Abstract: We propose integration of reasoning into speech large language models
(speechLLMs) for the end-to-end slot-filling task. Inspired by the recent
development of reasoning LLMs, we use a chain-of-thought framework to decompose
the slot-filling task into multiple reasoning steps, create a reasoning dataset
and apply the supervised fine-tuning strategy to a speechLLM. We distinguish
between regular and reasoning speechLLMs and experiment with different types
and sizes of LLMs as their text foundation models. We demonstrate performance
improvements by introducing reasoning (intermediate) steps. However, we show
that a reasoning textual LLM developed mainly for math, logic and coding
domains might be inferior as a foundation model for a reasoning speechLLM. We
further show that hybrid speechLLMs, built on a hybrid text foundation LLM and
fine-tuned to preserve both direct and reasoning modes of operation, have
better performance than those fine-tuned employing only one mode of operation.

Motivation: 将心理学中的群体身份理论与NLP技术结合，探索通过融入社会人口属性来减少自动化仇恨言论检测中的偏见。

Method: 使用Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini模型，采用两种人物设定提示方法：浅层人物提示和基于检索增强生成（RAG）的深度情境化人物设定开发。

Result: 研究揭示了基于人物设定方法在减少偏见方面的潜力和局限性，为开发更公平的仇恨言论检测系统提供了宝贵见解。

Conclusion: 将社会人口属性融入LLMs可以解决自动化仇恨言论检测中的偏见问题，但人物设定方法在减少偏见方面既有潜力也有局限性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how personalising Large Language Models
(Persona-LLMs) with annotator personas affects their sensitivity to hate
speech, particularly regarding biases linked to shared or differing identities
between annotators and targets. To this end, we employ Google's Gemini and
OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini models and two persona-prompting methods: shallow persona
prompting and a deeply contextualised persona development based on
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to incorporate richer persona profiles. We
analyse the impact of using in-group and out-group annotator personas on the
models' detection performance and fairness across diverse social groups. This
work bridges psychological insights on group identity with advanced NLP
techniques, demonstrating that incorporating socio-demographic attributes into
LLMs can address bias in automated hate speech detection. Our results highlight
both the potential and limitations of persona-based approaches in reducing
bias, offering valuable insights for developing more equitable hate speech
detection systems.

TL;DR: 开发了LOGICAL系统，基于微调的GLiNER模型，用于从临床笔记中高效移除个人身份信息(PII)，在标准笔记本电脑上运行，性能优于大型语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记中的PII移除对研究和AI开发至关重要，但大型语言模型计算成本高且存在数据隐私风险，尤其在资源受限环境中。

Method: 使用1515份临床文档，定义9个PII类别，微调GLiNER模型并在376个测试实例上评估，与多个系统进行比较。

Result: 微调GLiNER模型总体F1分数达0.980，显著优于Gemini-Pro-2.5(0.845)，95%文档完全净化，但存在2%假阴性率。

Conclusion: 微调的专业化transformer模型如GLiNER为临床笔记PII移除提供了准确、高效且安全的解决方案，是资源密集型LLMs的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in
Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs
and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in
low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation
by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally
deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight
Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a
psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal.
A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and
evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision,
recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER,
Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and
Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior
performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly
outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95%
of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model
operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a
2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop
validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer
models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure
solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This "sanitisation at the source"
approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the
creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while
preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类在对话中使用多模态线索（如语音、手势和注视）来管理轮换的机制，特别关注手势作为语言和声学特征的补充信息源。

Method: 引入DnD Gesture++扩展语料库，包含四种语义手势类型标注；采用专家混合框架整合文本、音频和手势特征进行轮换预测建模。

Result: 实验表明，整合语义引导的手势相比基线模型能获得持续的性能提升，证明了手势在多模态轮换预测中的补充作用。

Conclusion: 语义手势在多模态对话轮换预测中发挥着重要的补充作用，为理解人类对话机制提供了新的视角。

Abstract: In conversation, humans use multimodal cues, such as speech, gestures, and
gaze, to manage turn-taking. While linguistic and acoustic features are
informative, gestures provide complementary cues for modeling these
transitions. To study this, we introduce DnD Gesture++, an extension of the
multi-party DnD Gesture corpus enriched with 2,663 semantic gesture annotations
spanning iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and discourse types. Using this dataset,
we model turn-taking prediction through a Mixture-of-Experts framework
integrating text, audio, and gestures. Experiments show that incorporating
semantically guided gestures yields consistent performance gains over
baselines, demonstrating their complementary role in multimodal turn-taking.

TL;DR: M3-SLU是一个新的多模态大语言模型基准，用于评估多说话人、多轮对话的口语理解能力，重点关注说话人归属推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在语音和文本理解方面表现良好，但在自然对话中理解谁在什么时候说了什么（说话人归属推理）方面仍然存在困难。

Method: 从四个开放语料库构建了包含12,000多个验证实例的数据集，包含两个任务：说话人归属问答和通过话语匹配的说话人归属。

Result: 模型能够捕捉说了什么内容，但经常无法识别是谁说的，揭示了说话人感知对话理解的关键差距。

Conclusion: M3-SLU作为一个具有挑战性的基准，旨在推动说话人感知多模态理解的研究进展。

Abstract: We present M3-SLU, a new multimodal large language model (MLLM) benchmark for
evaluating multi-speaker, multi-turn spoken language understanding. While
recent models show strong performance in speech and text comprehension, they
still struggle with speaker-attributed reasoning, the ability to understand who
said what and when in natural conversations. M3-SLU is built from four open
corpora (CHiME-6, MELD, MultiDialog, and AMI) and comprises over 12,000
validated instances with paired audio, transcripts, and metadata. It includes
two tasks: (1) Speaker-Attributed Question Answering and (2) Speaker
Attribution via Utterance Matching. We provide baseline results for both
cascaded pipelines and end-to-end MLLMs, evaluated using an LLM-as-Judge and
accuracy metrics. Results show that while models can capture what was said,
they often fail to identify who said it, revealing a key gap in speaker-aware
dialogue understanding. M3-SLU offers as a challenging benchmark to advance
research in speaker-aware multimodal understanding.

Abstract: The creation of high-quality datasets to improve Large Language Model (LLM)
reasoning remains a significant challenge, as current methods often suffer from
generating low-quality/incorrect answers and limited information richness from
available data sources. To address this, we propose AgenticMath, a novel
agentic pipeline for generating high-quality mathematical question-answer pairs
to enhance the supervised fine-tuning of LLMs. Our method operates through four
stages: (1) Seed Question Filter that selects questions with high information
richness, complexity, and clarity; (2) an Agentic Question Rephrase step that
employs a multi-agent system to generate diverse, logically consistent
paraphrases; (3) an Answer Augment step where rewrite answers using
chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance numerical and logical correctness,
without reliance on human-provided labels; and (4) a final Question and Answer
Evaluation that retains only the most superior pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that, fine-tuning 3B-8B parameter LLMs on AgenticMath generated
datasets (comprising only 30-60K math samples) achieves competitive or superior
performance on diverse in domain and out-of-domain mathematical reasoning
benchmarks compared to baselines trained on much more data (e.g., 400K or 2.3M
samples). Our work demonstrates that targeted, high-quality data generation is
a more efficient path to improving mathematical reasoning in LLMs than
large-scale, low-quality alternatives.

### [43] [LoongRL:Reinforcement Learning for Advanced Reasoning over Long Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19363)
*Siyuan Wang,Gaokai Zhang,Li Lyna Zhang,Ning Shang,Fan Yang,Dongyao Chen,Mao Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LoongRL是一种数据驱动的强化学习方法，通过KeyChain技术将短多跳QA转化为高难度长上下文任务，训练模型在16K上下文长度下有效解决128K任务，显著提升长上下文推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文推理对大型语言模型至关重要，但现有强化学习方法主要针对短上下文，缺乏针对长上下文推理的高级思维模式探索，且高质量强化学习数据稀缺。

Method: 提出KeyChain合成方法，通过在大量干扰文档中插入UUID链来隐藏真实问题，将短多跳QA转化为高难度长上下文任务。模型需要逐步追踪正确链、识别真实问题、检索相关事实并进行推理。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B和14B模型上，LoongRL将长上下文多跳QA准确率分别提升23.5%和21.1%。LoongRL-14B达到74.2分，媲美更大规模前沿模型。同时提升长上下文检索能力，通过所有128K针在干草堆压力测试，并保持短上下文推理能力。

Conclusion: LoongRL通过数据驱动的强化学习方法有效解决了长上下文推理挑战，在16K训练长度下实现了对128K任务的泛化，为长上下文推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning over long contexts is essential for large language models. While
reinforcement learning (RL) enhances short-context reasoning by inducing "Aha"
moments in chain-of-thought, the advanced thinking patterns required for
long-context reasoning remain largely unexplored, and high-difficulty RL data
are scarce. In this paper, we introduce LoongRL, a data-driven RL method for
advanced long-context reasoning. Central to LoongRL is KeyChain, a synthesis
approach that transforms short multi-hop QA into high-difficulty long-context
tasks by inserting UUID chains that hide the true question among large
collections of distracting documents. Solving these tasks requires the model to
trace the correct chain step-by-step, identify the true question, retrieve
relevant facts and reason over them to answer correctly. RL training on
KeyChain data induces an emergent plan-retrieve-reason-recheck reasoning
pattern that generalizes far beyond training length. Models trained at 16K
effectively solve 128K tasks without prohibitive full-length RL rollout costs.
On Qwen2.5-7B and 14B, LoongRL substantially improves long-context multi-hop QA
accuracy by +23.5% and +21.1% absolute gains. The resulting LoongRL-14B reaches
a score of 74.2, rivaling much larger frontier models such as o3-mini (74.5)
and DeepSeek-R1 (74.9). It also improves long-context retrieval, passes all
128K needle-in-a-haystack stress tests, and preserves short-context reasoning
capabilities.

Motivation: 填补开源法律信息检索领域中领域和司法管辖区的空白，提供更全面的评估标准。

Method: 构建了10个专家标注的数据集，其中7个是新构建的，涵盖多个司法管辖区（美国、英国、欧盟、澳大利亚、爱尔兰、新加坡）、文档类型（案例、立法、监管指南、合同、文献）和任务类型（搜索、零样本分类、问答）。

Abstract: We present the Massive Legal Embedding Benchmark (MLEB), the largest, most
diverse, and most comprehensive open-source benchmark for legal information

answering). Seven of the datasets in MLEB were newly constructed in order to
fill domain and jurisdictional gaps in the open-source legal information
retrieval landscape. We document our methodology in building MLEB and creating
the new constituent datasets, and release our code, results, and data openly to
assist with reproducible evaluations.

*Xinfeng Xia,Jiacheng Liu,Xiaofeng Hou,Peng Tang,Mingxuan Zhang,Wenfeng Wang,Chao Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MoE-Prism通过模型-系统协同设计，将刚性MoE模型转换为弹性服务，通过离线重构引擎将专家分解为细粒度子专家，在线调度引擎实现QoS感知调度，提供4倍以上稳定操作点，显著提升AI服务效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型由于使用top-k机制在少数专家间路由，存在"质量悬崖"问题，只能提供少量粗粒度操作点，导致成本与质量之间的困难权衡，无法适应多样化的服务级别目标，造成资源过度配置。

Method: 1. 离线重构引擎：使用基于元启发式的分区优化求解器将单体专家系统分解为细粒度"子专家"，保持功能局部性且无需重新训练；2. 在线调度引擎：实现QoS感知调度，包含云部署中最大化吞吐量和内存受限设备上延迟优化卸载等专门策略。

Result: 在三个不同MoE模型上的评估显示：MoE-Prism提供超过基线4倍的稳定操作点；在严格延迟预算下动态提升吞吐量达19.9%；在有限资源下降低延迟达10.36%。

Conclusion: MoE-Prism提供了关键的"控制旋钮"来弥合模型-系统差距，实现了下一代自适应、高效且QoS感知的AI服务。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, the state-of-the-art in large-scale AI,
achieve high quality by sparsely activating parameters. However, their reliance
on routing between a few monolithic experts via a top-k mechanism creates a
"quality cliff", offering only a few coarse-grained operating points. This
inflexibility forces a difficult trade-off between cost and quality, preventing
adaptation to diverse Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and leading to
significant resource over-provisioning.
  This paper introduces MoE-Prism, a model-system co-design that transforms
rigid MoE models into elastic services. Our methodology is divided into two
phases. First, an \emph{Offline Refactoring Engine} systematically deconstructs
monolithic experts into fine-grained "sub-experts." This engine employs a
partitioning optimization solver that uses a metaheuristic-based approach to
group neurons, preserving functional locality without requiring retraining.
Second, an \emph{Online Scheduling Engine} leverages this new elasticity
through QoS-aware scheduling. It implements specialized policies to solve
complex system problems, including maximizing throughput in cloud deployments
and managing latency-optimized offloading for memory-constrained devices. Our
evaluation across three different MoE models shows that MoE-Prismprovides over
4 times more distinct, stable operating points than the baseline. This allows
an AI service to dynamically improve throughput by up to 19.9\% under a strict
latency budget or reduce latency by up to 10.36\% under limited resources.
MoE-Prism provides the critical "control knob" to bridge the model-system gap,
enabling the next generation of adaptive, efficient, and QoS-aware AI services.

*Yasser Hamidullah,Josef van Genabith,Cristina España-Bonet*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的手语翻译方法，使用目标句子的句子嵌入替代传统的手语注释，无需手动标注，通过原始文本数据学习监督信号，显著提升了无注释手语翻译的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语翻译系统依赖手语注释，但这类标注数据通常规模有限且在不同数据集中差异很大，限制了系统的可扩展性和性能。

Method: 使用目标句子的句子嵌入作为训练时的监督信号，替代传统的手语注释，支持单语和多语言句子嵌入及翻译系统。

Result: 在德语（PHOENIX-2014T）和美国手语（How2Sign）数据集上评估，显著优于其他无注释方法，在没有额外预训练数据的情况下达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缩小了依赖注释和无注释手语翻译系统之间的性能差距，为无注释手语翻译提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sign language translation (SLT) systems facilitate the
learning process through gloss annotations, either in an end2end manner or by
involving an intermediate step. Unfortunately, gloss labelled sign language
data is usually not available at scale and, when available, gloss annotations
widely differ from dataset to dataset. We present a novel approach using
sentence embeddings of the target sentences at training time that take the role
of glosses. The new kind of supervision does not need any manual annotation but
it is learned on raw textual data. As our approach easily facilitates
multilinguality, we evaluate it on datasets covering German (PHOENIX-2014T) and
American (How2Sign) sign languages and experiment with mono- and multilingual
sentence embeddings and translation systems. Our approach significantly
outperforms other gloss-free approaches, setting the new state-of-the-art for
data sets where glosses are not available and when no additional SLT datasets
are used for pretraining, diminishing the gap between gloss-free and
gloss-dependent systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 使用语言无关的多模态嵌入和监督手语翻译，结合多语言目标增强和视频级扰动，实现直接多语言翻译并提高模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译通常使用单一语言的文本进行训练，这限制了可扩展性和跨语言泛化能力。现有方法虽然用基于文本的句子嵌入替代了gloss监督，但仍受限于特定语言和模态。

Method: 采用在多种语言的文本和语音上训练的语言无关多模态嵌入来监督SLT；提出耦合增强方法，结合多语言目标增强（翻译成多种语言）和视频级扰动来解决数据稀缺问题。

Result: 实验显示在BLEURT指标上相比仅使用文本句子嵌入监督有持续提升，在低资源设置下改进更大。

Conclusion: 语言无关嵌入监督结合耦合增强为传统SLT训练提供了可扩展且语义鲁棒的替代方案。

Abstract: Sign language translation (SLT) is typically trained with text in a single
spoken language, which limits scalability and cross-language generalization.
Earlier approaches have replaced gloss supervision with text-based sentence
embeddings, but up to now, these remain tied to a specific language and
modality. In contrast, here we employ language-agnostic, multimodal embeddings
trained on text and speech from multiple languages to supervise SLT, enabling
direct multilingual translation. To address data scarcity, we propose a coupled
augmentation method that combines multilingual target augmentations (i.e.
translations into many languages) with video-level perturbations, improving
model robustness. Experiments show consistent BLEURT gains over text-only
sentence embedding supervision, with larger improvements in low-resource
settings. Our results demonstrate that language-agnostic embedding supervision,
combined with coupled augmentation, provides a scalable and semantically robust
alternative to traditional SLT training.

*Victor Morand,Nadi Tomeh,Josiane Mothe,Benjamin Piwowarski*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToMMeR是一个轻量级模型（<30万参数），通过探测早期LLM层实现实体提及检测，在13个NER基准测试中达到93%的零样本召回率，90%以上的精确度，证明结构化实体表示存在于早期Transformer层中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实体提及检测是信息提取的基础，但也是已知的性能瓶颈。研究旨在探索能否从早期LLM层中高效恢复结构化实体表示。

Method: 引入ToMMeR模型，通过探测早期LLM层来提取实体提及检测能力，使用LLM作为判断器验证预测质量，并扩展到跨度分类头。

Result: 在13个NER基准测试中实现93%的零样本召回率和90%以上的精确度；跨模型分析显示不同架构在提及边界上高度一致（DICE >75%）；扩展后达到接近SOTA的NER性能（80-87% F1）。

Conclusion: 实体提及检测自然地从语言建模中涌现，结构化实体表示存在于早期Transformer层中，可以通过最小参数高效恢复。

Abstract: Identifying which text spans refer to entities -- mention detection -- is
both foundational for information extraction and a known performance
bottleneck. We introduce ToMMeR, a lightweight model (<300K parameters) probing
mention detection capabilities from early LLM layers. Across 13 NER benchmarks,
ToMMeR achieves 93\% recall zero-shot, with over 90\% precision using an LLM as
a judge showing that ToMMeR rarely produces spurious predictions despite high
recall. Cross-model analysis reveals that diverse architectures (14M-15B
parameters) converge on similar mention boundaries (DICE >75\%), confirming
that mention detection emerges naturally from language modeling. When extended
with span classification heads, ToMMeR achieves near SOTA NER performance
(80-87\% F1 on standard benchmarks). Our work provides evidence that structured
entity representations exist in early transformer layers and can be efficiently
recovered with minimal parameters.

TL;DR: DFKI-MLT团队在WMT-SLT 2022手语翻译任务中提出了一种端到端架构，从瑞士德语手语视频直接翻译成德语文本，但在测试集上性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手语翻译方法使用通用seq2seq架构，但往往无法充分利用时间特征。本文旨在开发能够学习时空特征表示和翻译的单一模型，实现真正的端到端架构。

Method: 提出一个学习时空特征表示和翻译的单一模型，使用视频帧特征而非词嵌入，构建端到端架构。

Result: 在开发集上获得5±1 BLEU分数，但在测试集上性能大幅下降至0.11±0.06 BLEU分数。

Conclusion: 虽然端到端架构在开发集上表现良好，但在测试集上泛化能力不足，表明模型存在过拟合问题。

Abstract: This paper describes the DFKI-MLT submission to the WMT-SLT 2022 sign
language translation (SLT) task from Swiss German Sign Language (video) into
German (text). State-of-the-art techniques for SLT use a generic seq2seq
architecture with customized input embeddings. Instead of word embeddings as
used in textual machine translation, SLT systems use features extracted from
video frames. Standard approaches often do not benefit from temporal features.
In our participation, we present a system that learns spatio-temporal feature
representations and translation in a single model, resulting in a real
end-to-end architecture expected to better generalize to new data sets. Our
best system achieved $5\pm1$ BLEU points on the development set, but the
performance on the test dropped to $0.11\pm0.06$ BLEU points.

TL;DR: BLiSS 1.0是一个用于评估认知启发模型的基准测试，通过选择性容忍度测试模型对自然学习者错误和人工错误的区分能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决性能导向基准测试与认知启发模型评估之间的差距，需要开发能够测试模型对人类语言习得模式理解能力的评估工具。

Method: 从280万自然学习者句子中构建136,867个控制三元组（正确、学习者、人工），测试模型对自然学习者错误与匹配人工错误的容忍度差异。

Result: 实验表明选择性容忍度是不同于标准语法性的独立能力，模型表现按训练范式明显聚类。

Conclusion: BLiSS验证了其作为衡量不同训练目标如何影响模型与人类语言习得系统模式对齐的稳健工具。

Abstract: To bridge the gap between performance-oriented benchmarks and the evaluation
of cognitively inspired models, we introduce BLiSS 1.0, a Benchmark of Learner
Interlingual Syntactic Structure. Our benchmark operationalizes a new paradigm
of selective tolerance, testing whether a model finds a naturalistic learner
error more plausible than a matched, artificial error within the same sentence.
Constructed from over 2.8 million naturalistic learner sentences, BLiSS
provides 136,867 controlled triplets (corrected, learner, artificial) for this
purpose. Experiments on a diverse suite of models demonstrate that selective
tolerance is a distinct capability from standard grammaticality, with
performance clustering strongly by training paradigm. This validates BLiSS as a
robust tool for measuring how different training objectives impact a model's
alignment with the systematic patterns of human language acquisition.

TL;DR: MINED是一个评估大型多模态模型时间敏感知识理解能力的基准，包含6个维度和11个任务，涵盖2104个时间敏感知识样本。评估显示Gemini-2.5-Pro表现最佳，大多数开源LMMs缺乏时间理解能力，且知识编辑方法可以有效更新LMMs的时间敏感知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准设计静态，无法充分评估LMMs对时间敏感知识的理解能力，需要构建专门评估时间感知能力的基准。

Method: 从维基百科构建MINED基准，包含6个关键维度和11个挑战性任务，由两名专业标注者构建2104个时间敏感知识样本，涵盖六种知识类型。评估15个广泛使用的LMMs，并研究通过知识编辑方法更新时间敏感知识的可行性。

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro获得最高平均CEM分数63.07，大多数开源LMMs缺乏时间理解能力。LMMs在组织知识上表现最佳，在体育知识上表现最弱。知识编辑方法在单次编辑场景中能有效更新LMMs的时间敏感知识。

Conclusion: MINED基准揭示了LMMs在时间敏感知识理解方面的局限性，证明了知识编辑方法在更新LMMs知识方面的可行性，为改进LMMs的时间感知能力提供了方向。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encode rich factual knowledge via cross-modal
pre-training, yet their static representations struggle to maintain an accurate
understanding of time-sensitive factual knowledge. Existing benchmarks remain
constrained by static designs, inadequately evaluating LMMs' ability to
understand time-sensitive knowledge. To address this gap, we propose MINED, a
comprehensive benchmark that evaluates temporal awareness along 6 key
dimensions and 11 challenging tasks: cognition, awareness, trustworthiness,
understanding, reasoning, and robustness. MINED is constructed from Wikipedia
by two professional annotators, containing 2,104 time-sensitive knowledge
samples spanning six knowledge types. Evaluating 15 widely used LMMs on MINED
shows that Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the highest average CEM score of 63.07,
while most open-source LMMs still lack time understanding ability. Meanwhile,
LMMs perform best on organization knowledge, whereas their performance is
weakest on sport. To address these challenges, we investigate the feasibility
of updating time-sensitive knowledge in LMMs through knowledge editing methods
and observe that LMMs can effectively update knowledge via knowledge editing
methods in single editing scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于MBR解码在文本到文本生成任务中表现出色，作者期望它在语音到文本任务中也能有效，但目前语音任务仍主要使用beam search。

Method: 在英语和日语上使用Whisper及其衍生模型评估MBR解码在ASR和ST任务中的表现。

Result: 在大多数实验设置中，MBR解码的准确性优于beam search。

Conclusion: MBR解码是离线ASR和ST任务中实现高准确性的有前景方法。

Abstract: Recent work has shown that sample-based Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding
outperforms beam search in text-to-text generation tasks, such as machine
translation, text summarization, and image captioning. On the other hand, beam
search is the current practice for speech-to-text tasks such as automatic
speech recognition (ASR) and Speech Translation (ST). Given that MBR decoding
is effective in text-to-text generation tasks, it is reasonable to expect it to
also be effective for speech-to-text tasks. In this paper, we evaluate MBR
decoding for ASR and ST tasks on English and Japanese using Whisper and its
derivative models. We observe that the accuracy of MBR decoding outperforms
that of beam search in most of the experimental settings we have evaluated. The
results show that MBR decoding is a promising method for offline ASR and ST
tasks that require high accuracy. The code is available at

Motivation: 训练计算机使用代理需要大量GUI交互数据，但手动标注成本过高。利用公开可用的屏幕录制视频可以解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 开发Video2Action逆向动力学模块，包含视频定位模型（检测GUI动作）和动作内容识别器（提取结构化参数），从YouTube教程视频自动生成交互数据。

Result: 从39,000个YouTube视频生成152万交互步骤，在OSWorld-Verified上任务成功率从9.3%提升至15.8%（相对提升70%），在AgentNetBench上步骤准确率从64.1%提升至69.3%。

Conclusion: 被动互联网视频可以转化为高质量的训练监督信号，为计算机使用代理提供可扩展的替代方案，减少对昂贵人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Training computer-use agents requires massive amounts of GUI interaction
data, but manually annotating action trajectories at scale is prohibitively
expensive. We present VideoAgentTrek, a scalable pipeline that automatically
mines training data from publicly available screen-recorded videos at web
scale, eliminating the need for manual annotation. Our approach addresses a key
challenge: raw videos contain implicit demonstrations but lack explicit action
labels. To solve this, we develop Video2Action, an inverse dynamics module
(IDM) with two components: (1) a video grounding model that detects and
localizes GUI actions with precise temporal boundaries and context, and (2) an
action-content recognizer that extracts structured parameters like click
coordinates and typed text with high fidelity. Applied to 39,000 YouTube
tutorial videos, our pipeline generates 1.52 million interaction steps
automatically. We leverage this data through continued pretraining followed by
supervised fine-tuning. On OSWorld-Verified, our approach improves task success
rates from 9.3% (SFT-only baseline) to 15.8%, a 70% relative improvement. On
AgentNetBench, step accuracy increases from 64.1% to 69.3%. Our results
demonstrate that passive internet videos can be transformed into high-quality
supervision for computer-use agents, providing a scalable alternative to
expensive manual annotation.

Motivation: 尽管MIA和机器文本检测目标不同，但方法都基于语言模型的概率分布信号。这两个任务被独立研究，可能导致忽略了另一任务中发展的更强方法和宝贵见解。

Method: 从理论上证明两个任务的最优性能度量相同，并通过大规模实验（7种MIA方法和5种机器文本检测器，涵盖13个领域和10个生成器）验证跨任务性能的相关性。

Result: 实验显示跨任务性能存在很强的秩相关性（rho > 0.6），特别是Binoculars方法在MIA基准测试中也达到了最先进性能。

Conclusion: 研究发现两个任务之间存在显著的可转移性，强调需要加强跨任务意识和合作，并提出了统一的评估套件MINT。

Abstract: Although membership inference attacks (MIAs) and machine-generated text
detection target different goals, identifying training samples and synthetic
texts, their methods often exploit similar signals based on a language model's
probability distribution. Despite this shared methodological foundation, the
two tasks have been independently studied, which may lead to conclusions that
overlook stronger methods and valuable insights developed in the other task. In
this work, we theoretically and empirically investigate the transferability,
i.e., how well a method originally developed for one task performs on the
other, between MIAs and machine text detection. For our theoretical
contribution, we prove that the metric that achieves the asymptotically highest
performance on both tasks is the same. We unify a large proportion of the
existing literature in the context of this optimal metric and hypothesize that
the accuracy with which a given method approximates this metric is directly
correlated with its transferability. Our large-scale empirical experiments,
including 7 state-of-the-art MIA methods and 5 state-of-the-art machine text
detectors across 13 domains and 10 generators, demonstrate very strong rank
correlation (rho > 0.6) in cross-task performance. We notably find that
Binoculars, originally designed for machine text detection, achieves
state-of-the-art performance on MIA benchmarks as well, demonstrating the
practical impact of the transferability. Our findings highlight the need for
greater cross-task awareness and collaboration between the two research
communities. To facilitate cross-task developments and fair evaluations, we
introduce MINT, a unified evaluation suite for MIAs and machine-generated text
detection, with implementation of 15 recent methods from both tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Transformer language models typically operate with a fixed-length context
window, which has grown in step with large-scale pretraining datasets. In the
BabyLM Challenge, however, many past submissions have defaulted to using much
shorter sequence lengths. We examine the impact of sequence length on BabyLM
pretraining, to answer the simple question: what sequence length should we be
using when training Baby LMs? Using 100M-word training data and fixed compute
budgets, we compare 125M-parameter Mamba and OPT models, finding that although
longer is often better, the optimal length depends on both task and
architecture. Shorter sequences are sufficient for grammatical generalization
tasks whereas longer contexts benefit morphological analogical reasoning tasks.

the diverse strengths of heterogeneous LLMs. Most existing approaches frame
routing as a classification problem based solely on the input query. While this
reduces overhead by avoiding inference across all models, it overlooks valuable
information that could be gleaned from potential outputs and fails to capture
implicit intent or contextual nuances that often emerge only during response
generation. These limitations can result in suboptimal routing decisions,
particularly for complex or ambiguous queries that require deeper semantic
understanding. To address this challenge, we propose Lookahead, a routing
framework that "foresees" potential model outputs by predicting their latent
representations and uses these predictions to guide model selection, thus
enabling more informed routing without full inference. Within this framework,
we implement two approaches based on causal and masked language models.
Empirical evaluations across seven public benchmarks - spanning instruction
following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation - show that Lookahead
consistently outperforms existing routing baselines, achieving an average
performance gain of 7.7% over the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的分类法来解决语音基础模型的评估问题，定义了三个正交轴：评估方面、模型能力和任务要求，为选择合适的评估方法提供了原则性框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音基础模型的评估在不同任务和模型类型之间是脱节的，不同模型在语音处理的不同方面表现优异，需要不同的评估协议。

Method: 提出了一个统一的分类法，包含三个正交轴：评估方面（测量的内容）、模型能力（完成任务所需的能力）和任务要求（执行任务所需的协议）。

Result: 对现有评估和基准进行了分类，揭示了系统性差距（如韵律、交互或推理方面的覆盖不足），为未来基准设计指明了优先事项。

Conclusion: 这项工作为选择、解释和扩展语音模型评估提供了概念基础和实践指南。

Abstract: Speech foundation models have recently achieved remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of tasks. However, their evaluation remains disjointed
across tasks and model types. Different models excel at distinct aspects of
speech processing and thus require different evaluation protocols. This paper
proposes a unified taxonomy that addresses the question: Which evaluation is
appropriate for which model? The taxonomy defines three orthogonal axes: the
\textbf{evaluation aspect} being measured, the model capabilities required to
attempt the task, and the task or protocol requirements needed to perform it.
We classify a broad set of existing evaluations and benchmarks along these
axes, spanning areas such as representation learning, speech generation, and
interactive dialogue. By mapping each evaluation to the capabilities a model
exposes (e.g., speech generation, real-time processing) and to its
methodological demands (e.g., fine-tuning data, human judgment), the taxonomy
provides a principled framework for aligning models with suitable evaluation
methods. It also reveals systematic gaps, such as limited coverage of prosody,
interaction, or reasoning, that highlight priorities for future benchmark
design. Overall, this work offers a conceptual foundation and practical guide
for selecting, interpreting, and extending evaluations of speech models.

*Danni Liu,Jan Niehues*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了多语言模型微调中的灾难性遗忘问题，发现模型与数据规模的相对比例是主要决定因素，指令跟随能力比架构更重要，参数高效微调相比全参数微调没有明显优势，跨语言对齐可以缓解遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言基础模型在特定语言上微调时经常出现灾难性遗忘，降低在未见语言上的性能。现有文献对此现象的结果碎片化，缺乏系统研究。

Method: 使用机器翻译作为测试平台，在不同模型架构、数据规模和微调方法下进行受控实验，系统分析触发灾难性遗忘的条件。

Result: 发现模型与数据规模的相对比例是遗忘的主要决定因素；模型的指令跟随能力对保留多语言知识比架构更重要；参数高效微调相比全参数微调没有明显优势；跨语言对齐可以缓解遗忘并促进向未见目标语言的正向迁移。

Conclusion: 多语言微调中的灾难性遗忘主要由模型与数据规模的比例决定，指令跟随能力是关键因素，跨语言对齐是有效的缓解策略。

Abstract: Fine-tuning multilingual foundation models on specific languages often
induces catastrophic forgetting, degrading performance on languages unseen in
fine-tuning. While this phenomenon is widely-documented, the literature
presents fragmented results about when forgetting occurs. To address this
ambiguity, we conduct a systematic empirical study using machine translation as
a testbed to identify the conditions that trigger catastrophic forgetting in
multilingual fine-tuning. Through controlled experiments across different model
architectures, data scales, and fine-tuning approaches, we reveal that the
relative scale between model and data size is a primary determinant of
forgetting. Moreover, we demonstrate that a model's instruction-following
ability is more critical for retaining multilingual knowledge than its
architecture. Contrary to assumptions, parameter-efficient fine-tuning offers
no clear advantage over full fine-tuning in mitigating forgetting. Lastly, we
show that cross-lingual alignment can mitigate forgetting while also
facilitating positive transfer to unseen target languages.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型的广泛应用，确保其与社会规范对齐变得至关重要。现有研究缺乏针对波斯文化背景的社会偏见资源，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 通过与社会科学专家合作，让250名不同人口统计背景的个体填写问卷，开发了包含16个文化类别的PBBQ基准数据集，并对多个开源和闭源模型进行评测。

Result: 研究发现当前LLMs在波斯文化中表现出显著的社会偏见，模型输出往往复制人类偏见模式，揭示了学习表示与文化刻板印象之间的复杂关系。

Conclusion: PBBQ数据集为波斯语语言模型的偏见评估和缓解提供了基础，论文被接受后将公开该数据集供未来研究使用。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring their
alignment with social norms has become a critical concern. While prior research
has examined bias detection in various languages, there remains a significant
gap in resources addressing social biases within Persian cultural contexts. In
this work, we introduce PBBQ, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to
evaluate social biases in Persian LLMs. Our benchmark, which encompasses 16
cultural categories, was developed through questionnaires completed by 250
diverse individuals across multiple demographics, in close collaboration with
social science experts to ensure its validity. The resulting PBBQ dataset
contains over 37,000 carefully curated questions, providing a foundation for
the evaluation and mitigation of bias in Persian language models. We benchmark
several open-source LLMs, a closed-source model, and Persian-specific
fine-tuned models on PBBQ. Our findings reveal that current LLMs exhibit
significant social biases across Persian culture. Additionally, by comparing
model outputs to human responses, we observe that LLMs often replicate human
bias patterns, highlighting the complex interplay between learned
representations and cultural stereotypes.Upon acceptance of the paper, our PBBQ
dataset will be publicly available for use in future work. Content warning:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体时代虚假信息快速传播，跨语言假新闻检测面临挑战。现有跨语言新闻分析数据集依赖专家人工标注，难以扩展和适应新语言。

Method: 开发了可扩展的众包标注流程，收集乌克兰语与波兰语、俄语、英语的新闻对，基于4W标准（谁、什么、哪里、何时）进行语义相似性标注和详细解释。

Result: 构建了CrossNews-UA数据集，测试了从传统词袋模型到Transformer架构和大语言模型等多种模型，揭示了多语言新闻分析的挑战。

Conclusion: 提出的众包方法能够有效构建跨语言新闻数据集，为多语言新闻分析提供了新的数据资源和模型性能见解。

Abstract: In the era of social networks and rapid misinformation spread, news analysis
remains a critical task. Detecting fake news across multiple languages,
particularly beyond English, poses significant challenges. Cross-lingual news
comparison offers a promising approach to verify information by leveraging
external sources in different languages (Chen and Shu, 2024). However, existing
datasets for cross-lingual news analysis (Chen et al., 2022a) were manually
curated by journalists and experts, limiting their scalability and adaptability
to new languages. In this work, we address this gap by introducing a scalable,
explainable crowdsourcing pipeline for cross-lingual news similarity
assessment. Using this pipeline, we collected a novel dataset CrossNews-UA of
news pairs in Ukrainian as a central language with linguistically and
contextually relevant languages-Polish, Russian, and English. Each news pair is
annotated for semantic similarity with detailed justifications based on the 4W
criteria (Who, What, Where, When). We further tested a range of models, from
traditional bag-of-words, Transformer-based architectures to large language
models (LLMs). Our results highlight the challenges in multilingual news
analysis and offer insights into models performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于字体风格的攻击方法SAD，利用人类与NLP模型对风格化文本的感知差异，在保持人类可读性的同时有效攻击各类模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着社交媒体的发展，用户使用风格化字体和字体表情表达个性，这些视觉吸引人的文本对人类可读，但NLP模型会将其处理为不同标记，造成干扰。作者发现了这种人类-模型感知差距，并基于此设计攻击方法。

Method: 提出Style Attack Disguise (SAD)攻击方法，设计两种规模：轻量版注重查询效率，强力版追求更优攻击性能。

Result: 在情感分类和机器翻译任务上的实验表明，SAD对传统模型、LLMs和商业服务都具有强攻击性能。同时展示了SAD对文本到图像、文本到语音等多模态任务的潜在威胁。

Conclusion: 风格化文本在人类可读的同时，为NLP模型引入了隐藏漏洞，SAD攻击方法有效利用了这种人类-模型感知差距，对各类NLP任务构成威胁。

Abstract: With social media growth, users employ stylistic fonts and font-like emoji to
express individuality, creating visually appealing text that remains
human-readable. However, these fonts introduce hidden vulnerabilities in NLP
models: while humans easily read stylistic text, models process these
characters as distinct tokens, causing interference. We identify this
human-model perception gap and propose a style-based attack, Style Attack
Disguise (SAD). We design two sizes: light for query efficiency and strong for
superior attack performance. Experiments on sentiment classification and
machine translation across traditional models, LLMs, and commercial services
demonstrate SAD's strong attack performance. We also show SAD's potential
threats to multimodal tasks including text-to-image and text-to-speech
generation.

TL;DR: LlavaCode框架通过将代码压缩为紧凑的语义表示，在保持代码生成质量的同时显著减少检索上下文长度，实现了20-38%的首词生成时间降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成在代码补全中很有效，但引入上下文会显著增加序列长度，导致推理速度变慢，这在IDE等交互式环境中是严重限制。

Method: 使用小型投影器模块将代码压缩为可由代码LLM解释的紧凑语义表示，将检索上下文减少到仅几个压缩的单标记向量。

Result: 实验表明压缩上下文在线补全任务中相比完整RAG流水线实现了20-38%的首词生成时间减少，同时显著提高了EM和ES指标。

Conclusion: LlavaCode框架通过代码压缩有效解决了RAG在代码补全中的延迟问题，在几乎不增加延迟的情况下提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation has emerged as one of the most effective
approaches for code completion, particularly when context from a surrounding
repository is essential. However, incorporating context significantly extends
sequence length, leading to slower inference - a critical limitation for
interactive settings such as IDEs. In this work, we introduce LlavaCode, a
framework that compresses code into compact, semantically rich representations
interpretable by code LLM, enhancing generation quality while reducing the
retrieved context to only a few compressed single-token vectors. Using a small
projector module we can significantly increase the EM and ES metrics of coding
model with negligible latency increase. Our experiments demonstrate that
compressed context enables 20-38% reduction in Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) on
line completion tasks compared to full-RAG pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer模型在情感识别方面取得进展，但在开放文本中的自动情感分析仍面临上下文模糊性、语言变异性和复杂情感表达解释等挑战，使得通用模型的直接应用变得困难。

Method: 比较了三种场景：(i) 微调预训练模型与使用简单提示的通用LLMs的性能；(ii) 不同情感提示设计对LLMs的效果；(iii) 情感分组技术对这些模型的影响。

Result: 实验测试显示，微调预训练模型在情感识别中达到70%以上的指标。研究结果强调LLMs需要结构化提示工程和情感分组来提升性能。

Conclusion: 这些进展改进了情感分析、人机交互以及跨领域用户行为的理解。

Abstract: Transformer models have significantly advanced the field of emotion
recognition. However, there are still open challenges when exploring open-ended
queries for Large Language Models (LLMs). Although current models offer good
results, automatic emotion analysis in open texts presents significant
challenges, such as contextual ambiguity, linguistic variability, and
difficulty interpreting complex emotional expressions. These limitations make
the direct application of generalist models difficult. Accordingly, this work
compares the effectiveness of fine-tuning and prompt engineering in emotion
detection in three distinct scenarios: (i) performance of fine-tuned
pre-trained models and general-purpose LLMs using simple prompts; (ii)
effectiveness of different emotion prompt designs with LLMs; and (iii) impact
of emotion grouping techniques on these models. Experimental tests attain
metrics above 70% with a fine-tuned pre-trained model for emotion recognition.
Moreover, the findings highlight that LLMs require structured prompt
engineering and emotion grouping to enhance their performance. These
advancements improve sentiment analysis, human-computer interaction, and
understanding of user behavior across various domains.

TL;DR: DiffAdapt是一个轻量级框架，通过分析推理轨迹的熵模式来识别问题难度，为不同难度的问题选择最优推理策略（提示、温度、最大token长度），在不微调基础LLM的情况下显著减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理LLM在解决问题时经常生成冗长的思考轨迹，但其效用不明确。研究发现模型在简单问题上存在"过度思考"现象，导致不必要的计算开销。

Method: 基于推理轨迹中token概率的熵分析，发现U形熵模式：简单问题高熵、中等难度低熵、困难问题高熵。使用DiffAdapt框架，通过小型探针分类LLM的最终隐藏状态，为不同难度问题选择相应的推理策略。

Result: 在5个模型和8个基准测试中，DiffAdapt实现了相当或改进的准确率，同时将token使用量减少高达22.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法为计算高效的推理提供了一条实用路径，通过难度自适应策略显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Recent reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable
problem-solving abilities but often generate long thinking traces whose utility
is unclear. Our work aims to improve their efficiency, enabling them to reach
high performance without overthinking. First, we analyze the entropy of token
probabilities in reasoning traces. Across three models, we observe a consistent
U-shaped entropy pattern: high entropy on easy problems despite high accuracy,
low entropy on problems with medium difficulty, and high entropy on hard
problems reflecting uncertainty. Specifically, we notice 22--25\% entropy
reduction from easy to medium difficulty regions, suggesting an {overthinking}
phenomenon on easy instances. Building on these insights, we introduce
\textbf{DiffAdapt}, a lightweight framework that selects Easy/Normal/Hard
inference strategies per question based on their difficulty and reasoning trace
entropy. Each inference strategy consists of a fixed prompt, temperature and
maximum token length. In contrast to existing efficiency optimization methods,
our approach does not fine-tune base LLM but a small probe that classifies
LLM's final hidden state, allowing inexpensive adaptation. We comprehensively
evaluate our method on five models and eight benchmarks. Our method achieves
comparable or improved accuracy while reducing token usage by up to 22.4\%,
establishing a practical path toward compute-efficient reasoning.

Motivation: 解决在干扰环境中部署大型模型时的语义理解、隐私保护和延迟控制等共同目标，满足边缘设备的资源限制需求。

Method: 包含四个核心组件：SenseFusion轻量编码器、Edge-RAG本地检索层、PromptRouter成本感知策略和Secure Execution安全执行机制，支持多种优化技术。

Abstract: We present CoSense-LLM, an edge-first framework that turns continuous
multimodal sensor streams (for example Wi-Fi CSI, IMU, audio, RFID, and
lightweight vision) into compact, verifiable semantic tokens and coordinates
with large language models under explicit latency, energy, bandwidth, and
privacy constraints. CoSense-LLM has four parts: (i) SenseFusion, a lightweight
encoder that aligns sensor embeddings with language and compresses them into
short discrete code sequences; (ii) Edge-RAG, a local hybrid retrieval layer
that grounds generation in site specific policies and notes; (iii)
PromptRouter, a cost and uncertainty aware policy that selects edge only
generation, edge plus retrieval, or compact cloud escalation; and (iv) Secure
Execution, an auditable redaction path that enforces data minimization so raw
waveforms never leave the device. The system works with modern serving
optimizations, including paged or streaming KV caches, FlashAttention style
kernels, speculative decoding, and quantized LoRA adapters, and supports on
device personalization and federated updates under non IID drift. Across home,
office, and clinic deployments, CoSense-LLM delivers grounded explanations
while meeting tight service level objectives: it sustains sub second (p95) end
to end latency on edge dominant paths, reduces inter tier token and bandwidth
costs by preferring local retrieval grounded responses, and preserves privacy
by transmitting only discrete codes and redacted metadata. Ablations show that
Edge-RAG improves factual consistency and reduces contradictions, calibrated
uncertainty enables selective abstention and controlled escalations, and KV
plus decoding accelerators lower energy per decision. The results support an
edge first design that treats semantics, privacy, and predictable latency as co
equal goals for large model deployments in interference prone environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类沟通具有动机性，而LLMs处理的信息也受到人类意图和动机的影响。为了让LLMs在现实世界中有效运作，它们必须能够像人类一样批判性地评估内容，考虑信息来源的动机。

Method: 首先使用认知科学的受控实验验证LLMs行为是否与理性学习模型一致，然后扩展到更自然的在线广告场景，并测试简单的引导干预效果。

Result: LLMs在受控实验中成功以人类方式对偏见信息进行折扣，但在在线广告场景中表现不佳。简单的引导干预显著提高了LLMs与理性模型的对应性。

Conclusion: LLMs具备对他人动机的基本敏感性，但要推广到新的现实世界场景还需要进一步改进这些模型。

Abstract: Human communication is motivated: people speak, write, and create content
with a particular communicative intent in mind. As a result, information that
large language models (LLMs) and AI agents process is inherently framed by
humans' intentions and incentives. People are adept at navigating such nuanced
information: we routinely identify benevolent or self-serving motives in order
to decide what statements to trust. For LLMs to be effective in the real world,
they too must critically evaluate content by factoring in the motivations of
the source -- for instance, weighing the credibility of claims made in a sales
pitch. In this paper, we undertake a comprehensive study of whether LLMs have
this capacity for motivational vigilance. We first employ controlled
experiments from cognitive science to verify that LLMs' behavior is consistent
with rational models of learning from motivated testimony, and find they
successfully discount information from biased sources in a human-like manner.
We then extend our evaluation to sponsored online adverts, a more naturalistic
reflection of LLM agents' information ecosystems. In these settings, we find
that LLMs' inferences do not track the rational models' predictions nearly as
closely -- partly due to additional information that distracts them from
vigilance-relevant considerations. However, a simple steering intervention that
boosts the salience of intentions and incentives substantially increases the
correspondence between LLMs and the rational model. These results suggest that
LLMs possess a basic sensitivity to the motivations of others, but generalizing
to novel real-world settings will require further improvements to these models.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Prompting is a common approach for leveraging LMs in zero-shot settings.
However, the underlying mechanisms that enable LMs to perform diverse tasks
without task-specific supervision remain poorly understood. Studying the
relationship between prompting and the quality of internal representations can
shed light on how pre-trained embeddings may support in-context task solving.
In this empirical study, we conduct a series of probing experiments on prompt
embeddings, analyzing various combinations of prompt templates for zero-shot
classification. Our findings show that while prompting affects the quality of
representations, these changes do not consistently correlate with the relevance
of the prompts to the target task. This result challenges the assumption that
more relevant prompts necessarily lead to better representations. We further
analyze potential factors that may contribute to this unexpected behavior.

Motivation: 欧盟法律信息虽然公开，但对普通公民来说过于复杂难懂，需要更易访问的方式来理解法律文本

Method: 基于204个博客构建包含880个对话轮次的EUDial数据集，并提出LexGuide框架，利用检索增强生成和分层主题组织来结构化对话进程

Result: 主动结构化导航缩小了法律信息可用性与公民理解之间的差距

Conclusion: EUDial和LexGuide为推进主动法律对话系统提供了实用资源

Abstract: The accessibility of legal information remains a constant challenge,
particularly for laypersons seeking to understand and apply complex
institutional texts. While the European Union provides open access to
legislation, parliamentary responses, and regulatory documents, these resources
can be challenging for laypeople to explore. In this paper, we introduce
EUDial, a proactive multi-turn dialogue dataset constructed from 204 blogs
curated by the Citizens' Enquiries Unit (AskEP) of the European Parliamentary
Research Service. EUDial contains 880 dialogue turns (averaging 4.3 turns per
dialogue), where each dialogue includes initial questions, structured answers,
and follow-up questions. Beyond dataset construction, we propose the LexGuide
framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation with hierarchical topic
organization to structure dialogue progression, ensuring both comprehensive
coverage of legal aspects and coherence across conversational turns. The
results demonstrate that proactive, structured navigation closes the gap
between the availability of legal information and citizen comprehension,
establishing EUDial and LexGuide as practical resources for advancing proactive
legal dialogue systems.

Motivation: 现有方法无法确保LLM按照特定文化、政治信仰等文本指定的语义条件生成内容，且直接微调LoRA权重会引入大量参数。

Method: 提出Zhyper框架，使用因子化超网络从文本描述生成上下文感知的LoRA适配器，实现参数高效的文化对齐。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Zhyper达到与最先进基线竞争的性能，同时参数减少26倍，在文化对齐任务中展现出更好的泛化能力和细粒度上下文价值捕捉。

Conclusion: Zhyper提供了一个参数高效的解决方案，能够有效实现大语言模型的文化对齐，在保持性能的同时显著减少参数数量。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) conditioning refers to instructing an LLM to
generate content in accordance with the norms and values of a specific culture,
beliefs of a particular political orientation, or any desired text-specified
semantic conditioning. Unfortunately, prompt engineering does not ensure that
LLMs behave in accordance with a desired conditioning due to the inductive bias
of the pre-training and alignment datasets. Prior works have focused on
fine-tuning LLMs by directly conditioning the LoRA weights; however, such
methods introduce a large number of parameters. As a remedy, we propose Zhyper,
a parameter-efficient factorized hypernetwork framework that generates
context-aware LoRA adapters from textual descriptions. Experiments on multiple
benchmarks show that Zhyper achieves competitive performance with up to 26x
fewer parameters than the state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, we extend
Zhyper to cultural alignment, demonstrating improved generalization to
out-of-domain settings and a better capturing of fine-grained contextual
values.

Motivation: 长链思维能力是大语言模型在复杂推理任务中取得突破的关键，但伴随的"欠思考"问题（模型频繁切换思维而不充分探索）限制了性能和token效率。

Method: SmartSwitch框架包含感知模块和干预模块：感知模块使用现成的过程奖励模型识别思维切换点并评估前一个思维的潜力；干预模块在发现高潜力思维被过早放弃时中断推理，回溯到切换点前并插入"深化提示"来鼓励进一步探索。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升了不同规模的大语言模型的性能。

Conclusion: SmartSwitch是一个简单有效的推理策略，可作为即插即用解决方案集成到任何大语言模型中，通过检测欠思考并引导深度探索来提升推理能力。

Abstract: The long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) capability is central to the recent
breakthroughs achieved by large language models in complex reasoning tasks.
However, the accompanying issue of ''underthinking'', where models exhibit
shallow reasoning by frequently switching thoughts without sufficient
exploration, limits both performance and token efficiency. To address this
problem, we propose a simple yet effective reasoning strategy: the SmartSwitch
inference framework. This framework can be easily integrated into any large
language model as a plug-and-play solution, continuously monitoring the model's
reasoning process to detect underthinking and guide it toward deeper
exploration of promising but overlooked thoughts. Specifically, the perception
module identifies points where thoughts switch and evaluates the potential of
the preceding thought using an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM). If a
high-potential thought is found to be prematurely abandoned, the intervention
module interrupts the ongoing inference, backtracks to the point before the
switch, and inserts a "deepening prompt" to encourage further exploration along
that promising path. Extensive experiments on challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
performance of various large language models of different sizes.

*Yuezhou Hu,Jiaxin Guo,Xinyu Feng,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AdaSPEC通过选择性令牌过滤改进知识蒸馏，提升推测解码中的令牌接受率，在多个任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法最小化所有令牌的KL散度，与推测解码最大化令牌接受率的目标不一致，导致草稿模型性能不佳。

Method: 使用参考模型识别并过滤难以拟合的令牌，在较简单令牌上蒸馏草稿模型，使其与目标模型更好对齐。

Result: 在算术推理、指令跟随、编程和摘要等任务上，AdaSPEC相比DistillSpec方法令牌接受率提升高达15%。

Conclusion: AdaSPEC通过选择性令牌过滤有效提升推测解码性能，在不影响生成质量的前提下提高令牌接受率。

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates large language model inference by
employing a small draft model to generate predictions, which are then verified
by a larger target model. The effectiveness of SD hinges on the alignment
between these models, which is typically enhanced by Knowledge Distillation
(KD). However, conventional KD methods aim to minimize the KL divergence
between the draft and target models across all tokens, a goal that is
misaligned with the true objective of SD, which is to maximize token acceptance
rate. Therefore, draft models often struggle to fully assimilate the target
model's knowledge due to capacity constraints, leading to suboptimal
performance. To address this challenge, we propose AdaSPEC, a novel method that
incorporates selective token filtering into the KD process. AdaSPEC utilizes a
reference model to identify and filter out difficult-to-fit tokens, enabling
the distillation of a draft model that better aligns with the target model on
simpler tokens. This approach improves the overall token acceptance rate
without compromising generation quality. We evaluate AdaSPEC across diverse
tasks, including arithmetic reasoning, instruction-following, coding, and
summarization, using model configurations of 31M/1.4B and 350M/2.7B parameters.
Our results demonstrate that AdaSPEC consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art DistillSpec method, achieving higher acceptance rates across
all tasks (up to 15\%). The code is publicly available at

*Prashant Kodali,Vaishnavi Shivkumar,Swarang Joshi,Monojit Choudhary,Ponnurangam Kumaraguru,Manish Shrivastava*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了模型合并作为代码混合NLP的实用适应策略，通过在多语言基础模型上进行持续预训练、模型合并和下游任务微调，在英语-印地语和英语-西班牙语的情感分析和仇恨言论检测任务上取得了优于传统方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索模型合并作为代码混合NLP的实用替代方案，以更有效地利用未标记数据，提升在低资源语言对上的性能表现。

Method: 从多语言基础模型出发，执行三步流程：(i) 在未标记代码混合文本上进行持续预训练获得适应检查点，(ii) 将检查点与基础模型合并，(iii) 在下游任务数据上进行微调。

Result: 合并模型在F1分数上比完全微调高出2-5个点，比CPT->FT高出约1-2个点；在跨语言对迁移中，合并检查点比单语英语基线表现更好（0.65-0.68 F1 vs 0.61-0.63）。

Conclusion: 模型合并能更有效地利用未标记数据，代码混合知识是低资源语言对更可靠的基板，论文提供了针对不同数据场景的适应方案，并讨论了在大模型和更广泛任务上的扩展考虑。

Abstract: We study model merging as a practical alternative to conventional adaptation
strategies for code-mixed NLP. Starting from a multilingual base model, we: (i)
perform continued pre-training (CPT) on unlabeled code-mixed text to obtain an
adapted checkpoint, (ii) merge checkpoint with the base model, and (iii)
fine-tune (FT) on the downstream task data. We evaluate our approach for
sentence classification (sentiment and hate speech) task in English-Hindi
(En-Hi) and English-Spanish (En-Es) using XLM-R and Llama-3.2-1B models. Our
results show that merged models consistently outperform full fine-tuning and
CPT->FT. We observe gains of 2--5 points in F1 over full fine-tuning and ~1-2
points over CPT->FT, indicating that unlabeled data is leveraged more
effectively via merging than via CPT alone. Zero-/few-shot prompting with
larger LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.3-70B) lags behind fine-tuned and merged
checkpoints, underscoring limits of in-context learning for code-mixed inputs.
We further test cross-pair transfer by training on En-Hi and evaluating on
En-Ta and En-Ml: merged checkpoints transfer more strongly than
monolingual-English baselines (e.g., TV/TIES variants reaching 0.65-0.68 F1 vs
0.61-0.63 for full fine-tuning), suggesting that code-mixed knowledge is a more
reliable substrate for low-resource pairs. We conclude with adaptation recipes
matched to common data regimes (labeled only; labeled+unlabeled; transfer-only)
and discuss limitations and scaling considerations for broader tasks and larger
models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ToolDreamer是一个改进LLM工具检索的框架，通过生成假设性工具描述来优化检索器性能，解决用户查询与工具描述语言不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索模型基于用户查询与工具描述的相似性进行排名，但用户请求往往与工具描述语言不匹配，导致检索效果不佳。

Method: 使用LLM生成假设性（合成）工具描述，让检索器基于这些描述来获取工具，实现查询与工具在描述语言空间中的自然对齐。

Result: 在ToolRet数据集上应用ToolDreamer，提高了稀疏和密集检索器的性能，无论是否经过训练都有效果。

Conclusion: 该框架将部分推理负担转移到检索器上，使LLM能够有效处理大量工具而不会超出上下文窗口限制。

Abstract: Tool calling has become increasingly popular for Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, for large tool sets, the resulting tokens would exceed the
LLM's context window limit, making it impossible to include every tool. Hence,
an external retriever is used to provide LLMs with the most relevant tools for
a query. Existing retrieval models rank tools based on the similarity between a
user query and a tool description (TD). This leads to suboptimal retrieval as
user requests are often poorly aligned with the language of TD. To remedy the
issue, we propose ToolDreamer, a framework to condition retriever models to
fetch tools based on hypothetical (synthetic) TD generated using an LLM, i.e.,
description of tools that the LLM feels will be potentially useful for the
query. The framework enables a more natural alignment between queries and tools
within the language space of TD's. We apply ToolDreamer on the ToolRet dataset
and show that our method improves the performance of sparse and dense
retrievers with and without training, thus showcasing its flexibility. Through
our proposed framework, our aim is to offload a portion of the reasoning burden
to the retriever so that the LLM may effectively handle a large collection of
tools without inundating its context window.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级框架，通过系统优化提示空间（自然性、文化适应性和难度增强）来改进多语言LLM性能，相比仅翻译方法获得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据在多语言应用中受限于基于翻译的提示方法，这些方法继承了英语中心框架和风格，忽略了文化维度，限制了模型泛化能力。

Method: 引入轻量级提示空间优化框架，将翻译后的提示进行系统转换，包括自然性调整、文化适应和难度增强，应用于12种语言的提示。

Result: 在相同数据条件下，相比仅翻译基线，Global-MMLU准确率提升4.7%，Flores XCometXL提升2.4%，mArenaHard偏好胜率提升35.3%。

Conclusion: 提示空间优化是构建更稳健、文化基础更扎实、全球能力更强的多语言LLM的简单而强大的范式。

Abstract: Synthetic data has become a cornerstone for scaling large language models,
yet its multilingual use remains bottlenecked by translation-based prompts.
This strategy inherits English-centric framing and style and neglects cultural
dimensions, ultimately constraining model generalization. We argue that the
overlooked prompt space-the very inputs that define training
distributions-offers a more powerful lever for improving multilingual
performance. We introduce a lightweight framework for prompt-space
optimization, where translated prompts are systematically transformed for
Naturalness, Cultural Adaptation, and Difficulty Enhancement. Using an
off-the-shelf multilingual LLM, we apply these transformations to prompts for
12 languages spanning 7 families. Under identical data conditions, our
approaches achieve substantial and consistent downstream improvements over the
translation-only baseline: +4.7% on Global-MMLU accuracy, +2.4% on Flores
XCometXL and +35.3% wins in preferences on mArenaHard. We establish
prompt-space optimization as a simple yet powerful paradigm for building
multilingual LLMs that are more robust, culturally grounded, and globally
capable.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Scaf-GRPO通过渐进式训练框架解决LLM在强化学习中的"学习悬崖"问题，当模型遇到超出能力范围的问题时提供分层提示，使模型能够自行构建有效解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于可验证奖励的强化学习方法存在"学习悬崖"现象：当面对远超模型当前能力的问题时，模型持续失败产生零奖励信号，导致优势计算归零，学习梯度消失，阻碍进步。

Method: 提出Scaf-GRPO（脚手架分组相对策略优化）框架，首先诊断学习停滞，然后通过注入分层提示进行干预，从抽象概念到具体步骤，让模型自行构建有效解决方案。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数学基准测试中，Scaf-GRPO将Qwen2.5-Math-7B模型在AIME24基准上的pass@1分数相对于普通GRPO基线相对提高了44.3%。

Conclusion: 该框架为解锁模型解决超出其能力范围问题的能力提供了稳健有效的方法论，是扩展LLM自主推理前沿的关键一步。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards has emerged as a powerful
technique for enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the
''learning cliff'' phenomenon: when faced with problems far beyond their
current capabilities, models consistently fail, yielding a persistent
zero-reward signal. In policy optimization algorithms like GRPO, this collapses
the advantage calculation to zero, rendering these difficult problems invisible
to the learning gradient and stalling progress. To overcome this, we introduce
Scaf-GRPO (Scaffolded Group Relative Policy Optimization), a progressive
training framework that strategically provides minimal guidance only when a
model's independent learning has plateaued. The framework first diagnoses
learning stagnation and then intervenes by injecting tiered in-prompt hints,
ranging from abstract concepts to concrete steps, enabling the model to
construct a valid solution by itself. Extensive experiments on challenging
mathematics benchmarks demonstrate Scaf-GRPO's effectiveness, boosting the
pass@1 score of the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model on the AIME24 benchmark by a relative
44.3% over a vanilla GRPO baseline. This result demonstrates our framework
provides a robust and effective methodology for unlocking a model's ability to
solve problems previously beyond its reach, a critical step towards extending
the frontier of autonomous reasoning in LLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM记忆机制，特别是敏感数据在训练过程中的记忆风险，为理解和管理模型记忆提供实证基础。

Method: 构建标准模型和扰动模型，扰动模型在训练中控制插入特定文本（如书籍段落、传记等），通过不同参数规模（1B/8B）和训练token数量（100B/500B）进行对比实验。

Result: 敏感数据的记忆程度取决于其在训练语料中的相对频率；敏感数据若缺乏持续暴露会被遗忘；训练语料大小和敏感数据出现时机是影响记忆的关键因素。

Conclusion: 提出了两个最佳实践：通过扩大训练语料稀释敏感数据，以及让敏感数据在训练早期出现；Hubble为记忆研究、成员推断和机器遗忘提供了理想测试平台。

Abstract: We present Hubble, a suite of fully open-source large language models (LLMs)
for the scientific study of LLM memorization. Hubble models come in standard
and perturbed variants: standard models are pretrained on a large English
corpus, and perturbed models are trained in the same way but with controlled
insertion of text (e.g., book passages, biographies, and test sets) designed to
emulate key memorization risks. Our core release includes 8 models -- standard
and perturbed models with 1B or 8B parameters, pretrained on 100B or 500B
tokens -- establishing that memorization risks are determined by the frequency
of sensitive data relative to size of the training corpus (i.e., a password
appearing once in a smaller corpus is memorized better than the same password
in a larger corpus). Our release also includes 6 perturbed models with text
inserted at different pretraining phases, showing that sensitive data without
continued exposure can be forgotten. These findings suggest two best practices
for addressing memorization risks: to dilute sensitive data by increasing the
size of the training corpus, and to order sensitive data to appear earlier in
training. Beyond these general empirical findings, Hubble enables a broad range
of memorization research; for example, analyzing the biographies reveals how
readily different types of private information are memorized. We also
demonstrate that the randomized insertions in Hubble make it an ideal testbed
for membership inference and machine unlearning, and invite the community to
further explore, benchmark, and build upon our work.

Abstract: Earth observation involves collecting, analyzing, and processing an
ever-growing mass of data. Automatically harvesting information is crucial for
addressing significant societal, economic, and environmental challenges,
ranging from environmental monitoring to urban planning and disaster
management. However, the high dimensionality of these data poses challenges in
terms of sparsity, inefficiency, and the curse of dimensionality, which limits
the effectiveness of machine learning models. Dimensionality reduction (DR)
techniques, specifically feature extraction, address these challenges by
preserving essential data properties while reducing complexity and enhancing
tasks such as data compression, cleaning, fusion, visualization, anomaly
detection, and prediction. This review provides a handbook for leveraging DR
across the RS data value chain and identifies opportunities for under-explored
DR algorithms and their application in future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基准标记在美学和其他原因下显得突兀，需要一种能隐蔽融入环境的追踪方案。

Method: 使用端到端深度学习流程，包括编码器网络将任意图像转换为Ninja Codes，通过深度隐写术联合训练创建和检测模块。

Result: 实验表明Ninja Codes能在常见室内光照条件下提供可靠的位置追踪，同时成功隐藏在各种环境纹理中。

Conclusion: Ninja Codes在需要隐蔽追踪的场景中具有特殊价值，可用普通彩色打印机打印，任何配备RGB摄像头的设备都能检测。

Abstract: In this paper we describe Ninja Codes, neurally-generated fiducial markers
that can be made to naturally blend into various real-world environments. An
encoder network converts arbitrary images into Ninja Codes by applying visually
modest alterations; the resulting codes, printed and pasted onto surfaces, can
provide stealthy 6-DoF location tracking for a wide range of applications
including augmented reality, robotics, motion-based user interfaces, etc. Ninja
Codes can be printed using off-the-shelf color printers on regular printing
paper, and can be detected using any device equipped with a modern RGB camera
and capable of running inference. Using an end-to-end process inspired by prior
work on deep steganography, we jointly train a series of network modules that
perform the creation and detection of Ninja Codes. Through experiments, we
demonstrate Ninja Codes' ability to provide reliable location tracking under
common indoor lighting conditions, while successfully concealing themselves
within diverse environmental textures. We expect Ninja Codes to offer
particular value in scenarios where the conspicuous appearances of conventional
fiducial markers make them undesirable for aesthetic and other reasons.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶中高层次的感知、预测和规划问题，通过精心设计的提示和上下文增强预训练视觉语言模型在驾驶问答任务中的表现。

Method: 两阶段方法：Phase-1使用Qwen2.5-VL-32B模型，结合六摄像头输入、历史帧和思维链提示，采用自一致性集成；Phase-2加入nuScenes场景元数据和任务特定指令。

Result: Phase-1使用5历史帧和10-shot提示达到65.1%准确率（零-shot为62.61%），自一致性提升至66.85%；Phase-2达到67.37%总体准确率，在严重视觉干扰下仍保持96%准确率。

Conclusion: 精心设计的提示和上下文基础可以显著增强预训练视觉语言模型在高级驾驶问答任务中的性能。

Abstract: We present a two-phase vision-language QA system for autonomous driving that
answers high-level perception, prediction, and planning questions. In Phase-1,
a large multimodal LLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32B) is conditioned on six-camera inputs, a
short temporal window of history, and a chain-of-thought prompt with few-shot
exemplars. A self-consistency ensemble (multiple sampled reasoning chains)
further improves answer reliability. In Phase-2, we augment the prompt with
nuScenes scene metadata (object annotations, ego-vehicle state, etc.) and
category-specific question instructions (separate prompts for perception,
prediction, planning tasks). In experiments on a driving QA benchmark, our
approach significantly outperforms the baseline Qwen2.5 models. For example,
using 5 history frames and 10-shot prompting in Phase-1 yields 65.1% overall
accuracy (vs.62.61% with zero-shot); applying self-consistency raises this to
66.85%. Phase-2 achieves 67.37% overall. Notably, the system maintains 96%
accuracy under severe visual corruption. These results demonstrate that
carefully engineered prompts and contextual grounding can greatly enhance
high-level driving QA with pretrained vision-language models.

Motivation: 现有方法无法充分利用纵向放射图像序列中的空间和时间信息，要么将空间信息压缩为向量，要么使用计算效率低下且不兼容非均匀时间步长的时空模型。

Method: 采用连续时间选择性扫描机制，将真实检查时间差显式整合到状态转换中，并辅以多尺度3D邻域融合模块来稳健捕捉时空关系。

Conclusion: 该模型凭借线性复杂度，能高效处理长而复杂的乳腺筛查历史，为纵向图像分析提供了新框架。

Abstract: Longitudinal analysis of sequential radiological images is hampered by a
fundamental data challenge: how to effectively model a sequence of
high-resolution images captured at irregular time intervals. This data
structure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods
fail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial
information into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are
computationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We
address this challenge with Time-Aware $\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space
architecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously
encodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while
remaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time
selective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time
difference between exams into its state transitions. This is complemented by a
multi-scale 3D neighborhood fusion module that robustly captures
spatio-temporal relationships. In a comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction
benchmark using sequential screening mammogram exams, our model shows superior
performance, improving the validation c-index by 2-5 percentage points and
achieving higher 1-5 year AUC scores compared to established variants of
recurrent, transformer, and state-space models. Thanks to its linear
complexity, the model can efficiently process long and complex patient
screening histories of mammograms, forming a new framework for longitudinal
image analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频扩散模型在生成时间连贯和物理合理的运动方面存在不足，主要原因是模型对复杂运动理解不够。现有方法通过对齐扩散模型与视频编码器特征来改进，但这些编码器将视频外观和动态特征纠缠在一起，限制了改进效果。

Method: 提出运动中心对齐框架：1）从预训练视频编码器中学习解耦的运动子空间；2）优化该子空间以预测真实光流，确保捕捉真实运动动态；3）将文本到视频扩散模型的潜在特征与这个新子空间对齐，使生成模型内化运动知识。

Result: 该方法在VideoPhy、VideoPhy2、VBench和VBench-2.0等基准测试中，以及用户研究中都显示出改进效果，提升了最先进视频扩散模型的物理常识性，同时保持了与文本提示的契合度。

Conclusion: 通过解耦运动子空间并与扩散模型特征对齐，能够有效提升文本到视频生成模型的运动合理性和物理常识性，同时不影响文本控制能力。

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet
often fail to generate temporally coherent and physically plausible motion. A
key reason is the models' insufficient understanding of complex motions that
natural videos often entail. Recent works tackle this problem by aligning
diffusion model features with those from pretrained video encoders. However,
these encoders mix video appearance and dynamics into entangled features,
limiting the benefit of such alignment. In this paper, we propose a
motion-centric alignment framework that learns a disentangled motion subspace
from a pretrained video encoder. This subspace is optimized to predict
ground-truth optical flow, ensuring it captures true motion dynamics. We then
align the latent features of a text-to-video diffusion model to this new
subspace, enabling the generative model to internalize motion knowledge and
generate more plausible videos. Our method improves the physical commonsense in
a state-of-the-art video diffusion model, while preserving adherence to textual
prompts, as evidenced by empirical evaluations on VideoPhy, VideoPhy2, VBench,
and VBench-2.0, along with a user study.

TL;DR: PoSh是一个用于详细图像描述评估的新指标，它使用场景图作为结构化标准来指导LLM作为评判者，产生基于细粒度错误的聚合分数。该工作还引入了DOCENT数据集来验证PoSh的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的评估指标（如CIDEr、SPICE）是为短文本设计的，无法有效评估长文本描述中的属性和关系错误。需要一种能够定位具体文本跨度错误的新评估方法。

Method: PoSh使用场景图作为结构化标准，指导LLM作为评判者来评估详细图像描述。同时创建了DOCENT数据集，包含艺术作品、专家编写的参考描述以及模型生成的描述，并由艺术史学生进行质量评估。

Result: PoSh在DOCENT数据集上与人类评估的相关性比最佳替代方法高出0.05 Spearman ρ，对图像类型具有鲁棒性，并且能够作为有效的奖励函数，优于标准监督微调。

Conclusion: PoSh和DOCENT为详细图像描述评估提供了新的工具和基准，特别是在处理具有丰富场景动态的图像时，基础模型仍难以实现完整、无错误的覆盖，这为VLM进展设定了新的挑战性任务。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced into detailed image
description, evaluation remains a challenge. Standard metrics (e.g. CIDEr,
SPICE) were designed for short texts and tuned to recognize errors that are now
uncommon, such as object misidentification. In contrast, long texts require
sensitivity to attribute and relation attachments and scores that localize
errors to particular text spans. In this work, we introduce PoSh, a metric for
detailed image description that uses scene graphs as structured rubrics to
guide LLMs-as-a-Judge, producing aggregate scores grounded in fine-grained
errors (e.g. mistakes in compositional understanding). PoSh is replicable,
interpretable and a better proxy for human raters than existing metrics
(including GPT4o-as-a-Judge). To validate PoSh, we introduce a challenging new
dataset, DOCENT. This novel benchmark contains artwork, paired with
expert-written references, and model-generated descriptions, augmented with
granular and coarse judgments of their quality from art history students. Thus,
DOCENT enables evaluating both detailed image description metrics and detailed
image description itself in a challenging new domain. We show that PoSh
achieves stronger correlations (+0.05 Spearman $\rho$) with the human judgments
in DOCENT than the best open-weight alternatives, is robust to image type
(using CapArena, an existing dataset of web imagery) and is a capable reward
function, outperforming standard supervised fine-tuning. Then, using PoSh, we
characterize the performance of open and closed models in describing the
paintings, sketches and statues in DOCENT and find that foundation models
struggle to achieve full, error-free coverage of images with rich scene
dynamics, establishing a demanding new task to gauge VLM progress. Through both
PoSh and DOCENT, we hope to enable advances in important areas such as
assistive text generation.

Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective
alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different
modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of
Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many
downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition,
Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or
embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh
models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where
the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched
using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human
Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from
images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at
the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning
loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and
3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with
a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics:
MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset
with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose
retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset,
where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.

Abstract: In the realm of medical diagnostics, rapid advancements in Artificial
Intelligence (AI) have significantly yielded remarkable improvements in brain
tumor segmentation. Encoder-Decoder architectures, such as U-Net, have played a
transformative role by effectively extracting meaningful representations in 3D
brain tumor segmentation from Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. However,
standard U-Net models encounter challenges in accurately delineating tumor
regions, especially when dealing with irregular shapes and ambiguous
boundaries. Additionally, training robust segmentation models on
high-resolution MRI data, such as the BraTS datasets, necessitates high
computational resources and often faces challenges associated with class
imbalance. This study proposes the integration of the attention mechanism into
the 3D U-Net model, enabling the model to capture intricate details and
prioritize informative regions during the segmentation process. Additionally, a
tumor detection algorithm based on digital image processing techniques is
utilized to address the issue of imbalanced training data and mitigate bias.
This study aims to enhance the performance of brain tumor segmentation,
ultimately improving the reliability of diagnosis. The proposed model is
thoroughly evaluated and assessed on the BraTS 2020 dataset using various
performance metrics to accomplish this goal. The obtained results indicate that
the model outperformed related studies, exhibiting dice of 0.975, specificity
of 0.988, and sensitivity of 0.995, indicating the efficacy of the proposed
model in improving brain tumor segmentation, offering valuable insights for
reliable diagnosis in clinical settings.

Abstract: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women worldwide, emphasizing
the need for early detection and accurate diagnosis. As such Ultrasound
Imaging, a reliable and cost-effective tool, is used for this purpose, however
the sensitive nature of medical data makes it challenging to develop accurate
and private artificial intelligence models. A solution is Federated Learning as
it is a promising technique for distributed machine learning on sensitive
medical data while preserving patient privacy. However, training on
non-Independent and non-Identically Distributed (non-IID) local datasets can
impact the accuracy and generalization of the trained model, which is crucial
for accurate tumour boundary delineation in BC segmentation. This study aims to
tackle this challenge by applying the Federated Proximal (FedProx) method to
non-IID Ultrasonic Breast Cancer Imaging datasets. Moreover, we focus on
enhancing tumour segmentation accuracy by incorporating a modified U-Net model
with attention mechanisms. Our approach resulted in a global model with 96%
accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in enhancing tumour
segmentation accuracy while preserving patient privacy. Our findings suggest
that FedProx has the potential to be a promising approach for training precise
machine learning models on non-IID local medical datasets.

Conclusion: X-Ego-CS和CECL为电竞中的跨自我中心多智能体基准测试奠定了基础，将游戏理解定位为多智能体建模和战术学习的测试平台，对虚拟和现实领域中的时空推理和人机协作具有重要意义。

Abstract: Human team tactics emerge from each player's individual perspective and their
ability to anticipate, interpret, and adapt to teammates' intentions. While
advances in video understanding have improved the modeling of team interactions
in sports, most existing work relies on third-person broadcast views and
overlooks the synchronous, egocentric nature of multi-agent learning. We
introduce X-Ego-CS, a benchmark dataset consisting of 124 hours of gameplay
footage from 45 professional-level matches of the popular e-sports game
Counter-Strike 2, designed to facilitate research on multi-agent
decision-making in complex 3D environments. X-Ego-CS provides cross-egocentric
video streams that synchronously capture all players' first-person perspectives
along with state-action trajectories. Building on this resource, we propose
Cross-Ego Contrastive Learning (CECL), which aligns teammates' egocentric
visual streams to foster team-level tactical situational awareness from an
individual's perspective. We evaluate CECL on a teammate-opponent location
prediction task, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing an agent's
ability to infer both teammate and opponent positions from a single
first-person view using state-of-the-art video encoders. Together, X-Ego-CS and
CECL establish a foundation for cross-egocentric multi-agent benchmarking in
esports. More broadly, our work positions gameplay understanding as a testbed
for multi-agent modeling and tactical learning, with implications for
spatiotemporal reasoning and human-AI teaming in both virtual and real-world
domains. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/HATS-ICT/x-ego.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疟疾主要通过雌性按蚊传播，常导致0-5岁儿童死亡。传统显微镜观察血涂片图像的方法依赖专家经验，人工参与可能导致误诊，因此需要计算机辅助自动诊断系统。

Method: 使用六种深度卷积网络从血细胞图像中提取深层特征，包括AlexNet、XceptionNet、VGG-19、残差注意力网络、DenseNet-121和自定义CNN，并在公开疟疾细胞图像数据集上进行分类。

Result: 残差注意力网络和XceptionNet表现最优，平均准确率分别为97.28%和97.55%，超越了其他相关方法在同一数据集上的表现。

Conclusion: 深度学习驱动的自动检测方法能够可靠地识别疟疾感染细胞，同时最小化人工参与，具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: Malaria, which primarily spreads with the bite of female anopheles mosquitos,
often leads to death of people - specifically children in the age-group of 0-5
years. Clinical experts identify malaria by observing RBCs in blood smeared
images with a microscope. Lack of adequate professional knowledge and skills,
and most importantly manual involvement may cause incorrect diagnosis.
Therefore, computer aided automatic diagnosis stands as a preferred substitute.
In this paper, well-demonstrated deep networks have been applied to extract
deep intrinsic features from blood cell images and thereafter classify them as
malaria infected or healthy cells. Among the six deep convolutional networks
employed in this work viz. AlexNet, XceptionNet, VGG-19, Residual Attention
Network, DenseNet-121 and Custom-CNN. Residual Attention Network and
XceptionNet perform relatively better than the rest on a publicly available
malaria cell image dataset. They yield an average accuracy of 97.28% and 97.55%
respectively, that surpasses other related methods on the same dataset. These
findings highly encourage the reality of deep learning driven method for
automatic and reliable detection of malaria while minimizing direct manual
involvement.

TL;DR: PruneHal是一个无需训练的方法，通过自适应KV缓存修剪来增强多模态大语言模型对关键视觉信息的关注，从而缓解幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓解MLLMs幻觉的方法要么需要额外训练数据，要么在推理时引入外部信息，都会带来额外计算成本。研究发现幻觉与视觉token注意力不足密切相关，冗余视觉token分散了模型注意力。

Method: 提出PruneHal方法，利用自适应KV缓存修剪来增强模型对关键视觉信息的关注，无需额外训练，几乎不增加推理成本，且与不同解码策略兼容。

Result: 在多个主流MLLMs和广泛使用的幻觉评估基准上测试，取得了稳健且出色的结果，证明了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: PruneHal是首个将token修剪应用于MLLMs幻觉缓解的方法，具有训练免费、计算成本低、模型无关等优势，能有效缓解幻觉问题。

Abstract: While multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant
progress in recent years, the issue of hallucinations remains a major
challenge. To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce
additional data for further training or incorporate external or internal
information during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce
extra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in
MLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual
tokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the
model's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As
a result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn
exacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we
propose \textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that
leverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical
visual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our
knowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation
in MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs
nearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be
seamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those
specifically designed for hallucination mitigation. We evaluate PruneHal on
several widely used hallucination evaluation benchmarks using four mainstream
MLLMs, achieving robust and outstanding results that highlight the
effectiveness and superiority of our method. Our code will be publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Video Consistency Distance (VCD)指标，通过基于奖励的微调框架增强视频扩散模型的时序一致性，特别针对图像到视频生成任务中的时序不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于奖励的微调方法主要关注整个生成视频序列的质量提升，但在图像到视频生成任务中，时序一致性往往受到影响。现有方法难以有效解决时序一致性问题。

Method: 提出VCD指标，在视频帧特征的频域空间中定义，通过频域分析有效捕捉帧信息，并将其集成到基于奖励的微调框架中。

Result: 在多个I2V数据集上的实验结果表明，使用VCD微调的视频生成模型显著提升了时序一致性，且不降低其他性能指标。

Conclusion: VCD是一种有效的时序一致性增强方法，能够在不牺牲其他性能的前提下改善图像到视频生成的质量。

Abstract: Reward-based fine-tuning of video diffusion models is an effective approach
to improve the quality of generated videos, as it can fine-tune models without
requiring real-world video datasets. However, it can sometimes be limited to
specific performances because conventional reward functions are mainly aimed at
enhancing the quality across the whole generated video sequence, such as
aesthetic appeal and overall consistency. Notably, the temporal consistency of
the generated video often suffers when applying previous approaches to
image-to-video (I2V) generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose
Video Consistency Distance (VCD), a novel metric designed to enhance temporal
consistency, and fine-tune a model with the reward-based fine-tuning framework.
To achieve coherent temporal consistency relative to a conditioning image, VCD
is defined in the frequency space of video frame features to capture frame
information effectively through frequency-domain analysis. Experimental results
across multiple I2V datasets demonstrate that fine-tuning a video generation
model with VCD significantly enhances temporal consistency without degrading
other performance compared to the previous method.

TL;DR: Dream4Drive是一个用于自动驾驶感知任务增强的合成数据生成框架，通过3D感知引导图和3D资产渲染生成多视角逼真视频，显著提升角案例感知能力。


<details>

Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型主要关注生成质量和可控性指标，但忽视了下游感知任务的评估，而这对自动驾驶性能至关重要。现有方法需要先在合成数据上预训练再在真实数据上微调，导致训练周期加倍，当基线方法也加倍训练周期时，合成数据的优势变得不明显。

Conclusion: 综合实验表明，Dream4Drive在各种训练周期下都能有效提升下游感知模型的性能，为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in driving world models enable controllable generation of
high-quality RGB videos or multimodal videos. Existing methods primarily focus
on metrics related to generation quality and controllability. However, they
often overlook the evaluation of downstream perception tasks, which are
$\mathbf{really\ crucial}$ for the performance of autonomous driving. Existing
methods usually leverage a training strategy that first pretrains on synthetic
data and finetunes on real data, resulting in twice the epochs compared to the
baseline (real data only). When we double the epochs in the baseline, the
benefit of synthetic data becomes negligible. To thoroughly demonstrate the
benefit of synthetic data, we introduce Dream4Drive, a novel synthetic data
generation framework designed for enhancing the downstream perception tasks.
Dream4Drive first decomposes the input video into several 3D-aware guidance
maps and subsequently renders the 3D assets onto these guidance maps. Finally,
the driving world model is fine-tuned to produce the edited, multi-view
photorealistic videos, which can be used to train the downstream perception
models. Dream4Drive enables unprecedented flexibility in generating multi-view
corner cases at scale, significantly boosting corner case perception in
autonomous driving. To facilitate future research, we also contribute a
large-scale 3D asset dataset named DriveObj3D, covering the typical categories
in driving scenarios and enabling diverse 3D-aware video editing. We conduct
comprehensive experiments to show that Dream4Drive can effectively boost the
performance of downstream perception models under various training epochs.

Conclusion: MoE-GS是首个将混合专家技术融入动态高斯溅射的方法，通过专家集成和效率优化策略，在动态场景重建中实现了更好的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Recent advances in dynamic scene reconstruction have significantly benefited
from 3D Gaussian Splatting, yet existing methods show inconsistent performance
across diverse scenes, indicating no single approach effectively handles all
dynamic challenges. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mixture of
Experts for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (MoE-GS), a unified framework
integrating multiple specialized experts via a novel Volume-aware Pixel Router.
Our router adaptively blends expert outputs by projecting volumetric
Gaussian-level weights into pixel space through differentiable weight
splatting, ensuring spatially and temporally coherent results. Although MoE-GS
improves rendering quality, the increased model capacity and reduced FPS are
inherent to the MoE architecture. To mitigate this, we explore two
complementary directions: (1) single-pass multi-expert rendering and gate-aware
Gaussian pruning, which improve efficiency within the MoE framework, and (2) a
distillation strategy that transfers MoE performance to individual experts,
enabling lightweight deployment without architectural changes. To the best of
our knowledge, MoE-GS is the first approach incorporating Mixture-of-Experts
techniques into dynamic Gaussian splatting. Extensive experiments on the N3V
and Technicolor datasets demonstrate that MoE-GS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with improved efficiency. Video demonstrations are

Motivation: 4D成像雷达具有低成本、长距离检测和精确速度测量等优势，但其稀疏点云和低分辨率限制了物体几何表示并阻碍多模态融合。需要解决雷达数据稀疏性和跨模态融合问题。

Method: 1) 从图像和雷达数据估计物体二次曲面参数，增强空间表示；2) 预测密集深度用于图像特征从PV到BEV的转换；3) 生成密集伪点云缓解雷达点稀疏性；4) 使用基于pillar的方法处理点云特征并转换到BEV空间；5) 使用标准2D骨干网络和检测头进行目标检测。

Conclusion: SFGFusion通过表面拟合引导的多模态融合方法，成功解决了4D雷达数据稀疏性问题，提高了3D目标检测的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving. As an emerging
sensor, 4D imaging radar offers advantages as low cost, long-range detection,
and accurate velocity measurement, making it highly suitable for object
detection. However, its sparse point clouds and low resolution limit object
geometric representation and hinder multi-modal fusion. In this study, we
introduce SFGFusion, a novel camera-4D imaging radar detection network guided
by surface fitting. By estimating quadratic surface parameters of objects from
image and radar data, the explicit surface fitting model enhances spatial
representation and cross-modal interaction, enabling more reliable prediction
of fine-grained dense depth. The predicted depth serves two purposes: 1) in an
image branch to guide the transformation of image features from perspective
view (PV) to a unified bird's-eye view (BEV) for multi-modal fusion, improving
spatial mapping accuracy; and 2) in a surface pseudo-point branch to generate
dense pseudo-point cloud, mitigating the radar point sparsity. The original
radar point cloud is also encoded in a separate radar branch. These two point
cloud branches adopt a pillar-based method and subsequently transform the
features into the BEV space. Finally, a standard 2D backbone and detection head
are used to predict object labels and bounding boxes from BEV features.
Experimental results show that SFGFusion effectively fuses camera and 4D radar
features, achieving superior performance on the TJ4DRadSet and view-of-delft
(VoD) object detection benchmarks.

Abstract: Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant
detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar

a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian
algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate
missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching
and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and
progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline.

Abstract: Collaborative perception enhances the reliability and spatial coverage of
autonomous vehicles by sharing complementary information across vehicles,
offering a promising solution to long-tail scenarios that challenge
single-vehicle perception. However, the bandwidth constraints of vehicular
networks make transmitting the entire feature map impractical. Recent methods,
therefore, adopt a foreground-centric paradigm, transmitting only predicted
foreground-region features while discarding the background, which encodes
essential context. We propose FadeLead, a foreground-centric framework that
overcomes this limitation by learning to encapsulate background context into
compact foreground features during training. At the core of our design is a
curricular learning strategy that leverages background cues early on but
progressively prunes them away, forcing the model to internalize context into
foreground representations without transmitting background itself. Extensive

Abstract: We present a survey on 4D generation and reconstruction, a fast-evolving
subfield of computer graphics whose developments have been propelled by recent
advances in neural fields, geometric and motion deep learning, as well 3D
generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). While our survey is not the first
of its kind, we build our coverage of the domain from a unique and distinctive
perspective of 4D representations\/}, to model 3D geometry evolving over time
while exhibiting motion and interaction. Specifically, instead of offering an
exhaustive enumeration of many works, we take a more selective approach by
focusing on representative works to highlight both the desirable properties and
ensuing challenges of each representation under different computation,
application, and data scenarios. The main take-away message we aim to convey to
the readers is on how to select and then customize the appropriate 4D
representations for their tasks. Organizationally, we separate the 4D
representations based on three key pillars: geometry, motion, and interaction.
Our discourse will not only encompass the most popular representations of
today, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS),
but also bring attention to relatively under-explored representations in the 4D
context, such as structured models and long-range motions. Throughout our
survey, we will reprise the role of large language models (LLMs) and video
foundational models (VFMs) in a variety of 4D applications, while steering our
discussion towards their current limitations and how they can be addressed. We
also provide a dedicated coverage on what 4D datasets are currently available,
as well as what is lacking, in driving the subfield forward. Project

Conclusion: 提出的框架成功解决了现实世界图像超分辨率中的关键挑战，通过语义边缘引导和混合损失优化，实现了高质量和高效性的统一。

Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) must handle complex degradations
and inherent reconstruction ambiguities. While generative models have improved
perceptual quality, a key trade-off remains with computational cost. One-step
diffusion models offer speed but often produce structural inaccuracies due to
distillation artifacts. To address this, we propose a novel SR framework that
enhances a one-step diffusion model using a ControlNet mechanism for semantic
edge guidance. This integrates edge information to provide dynamic structural
control during single-pass inference. We also introduce a hybrid loss combining
L2, LPIPS, and an edge-aware AME loss to optimize for pixel accuracy,
perceptual quality, and geometric precision. Experiments show our method
effectively improves structural integrity and realism while maintaining the
efficiency of one-step generation, achieving a superior balance between output
quality and inference speed. The results of test datasets will be published at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出轻量级MAV动作识别框架MobiAct，采用MobileNetV4骨干网络和阶段式正交知识蒸馏策略，在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MAV动作识别方法大多依赖计算密集型模型，不适合资源受限的MAV平台，需要在识别精度和推理速度之间进行权衡。

Method: 使用MobileNetV4作为骨干网络，引入阶段式正交知识蒸馏(SOKD)策略从教师网络(ResNet18)向学生网络传递知识，集成无参数注意力机制，并采用混合损失训练策略。

Result: 在三个自收集数据集上平均识别精度达92.12%，仅消耗136.16 pJ能量，处理速度为8.84动作/秒，动作解码速度比领先方法快2倍。

Conclusion: MobiAct实现了低能耗、低计算的MAV动作识别，在保持高精度的同时显著提升了效率，适合资源受限的MAV平台部署。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient recognition of Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) motion is
essential for enabling real-time perception and coordination in autonomous
aerial swarm. However, most existing approaches rely on large, computationally
intensive models that are unsuitable for resource-limited MAV platforms, which
results in a trade-off between recognition accuracy and inference speed. To
address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight MAV action
recognition framework, MobiAct, designed to achieve high accuracy with low
computational cost. Specifically, MobiAct adopts MobileNetV4 as the backbone
network and introduces a Stage-wise Orthogonal Knowledge Distillation (SOKD)
strategy to effectively transfer MAV motion features from a teacher network
(ResNet18) to a student network, thereby enhancing knowledge transfer
efficiency. Furthermore, a parameter-free attention mechanism is integrated
into the architecture to improve recognition accuracy without increasing model
complexity. In addition, a hybrid loss training strategy is developed to
combine multiple loss objectives, which ensures stable and robust optimization
during training. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MobiAct
achieves low-energy and low-computation MAV action recognition, while
maintaining the fastest action decoding speed among compared methods. Across
all three self-collected datasets, MobiAct achieves an average recognition
accuracy of 92.12%, while consuming only 136.16 pJ of energy and processing
recognition at a rate of 8.84 actions per second. Notably, MobiAct decodes
actions up to 2 times faster than the leading method, with highly comparable
recognition accuracy, highlighting its superior efficiency in MAV action
recognition.

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在语义对齐方面表现良好，但在生成正确数量的对象方面仍有困难。现有方法只能使用可微的回归模型作为外部批评器，无法利用检测器模型更优越的计数能力。

Method: 设计自定义激活函数将检测器logits转换为软二元指示器，在推理时使用预训练的T2I模型优化噪声先验。

Result: 在SDXL-Turbo、SD-Turbo和Pixart-DMD等多个模型和四个不同复杂度的基准测试上，对象计数准确率显著提升（如在D2D-Small基准上提升13.7%），图像质量和计算开销影响很小。

Conclusion: D2D框架成功地将非可微检测器的计数能力引入到文本到图像生成中，显著提高了对象数量生成的准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved strong performance in
semantic alignment, yet they still struggle with generating the correct number
of objects specified in prompts. Existing approaches typically incorporate
auxiliary counting networks as external critics to enhance numeracy. However,
since these critics must provide gradient guidance during generation, they are
restricted to regression-based models that are inherently differentiable, thus
excluding detector-based models with superior counting ability, whose
count-via-enumeration nature is non-differentiable. To overcome this
limitation, we propose Detector-to-Differentiable (D2D), a novel framework that
transforms non-differentiable detection models into differentiable critics,
thereby leveraging their superior counting ability to guide numeracy
generation. Specifically, we design custom activation functions to convert
detector logits into soft binary indicators, which are then used to optimize
the noise prior at inference time with pre-trained T2I models. Our extensive
experiments on SDXL-Turbo, SD-Turbo, and Pixart-DMD across four benchmarks of
varying complexity (low-density, high-density, and multi-object scenarios)
demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements in object counting accuracy
(e.g., boosting up to 13.7% on D2D-Small, a 400-prompt, low-density benchmark),
with minimal degradation in overall image quality and computational overhead.

Abstract: Alzheimer disease is a severe brain disorder that causes harm in various
brain areas and leads to memory damage. The limited availability of labeled
medical data poses a significant challenge for accurate Alzheimer disease
detection. There is a critical need for effective methods to improve the
accuracy of Alzheimer disease detection, considering the scarcity of labeled
data, the complexity of the disease, and the constraints related to data
privacy. To address this challenge, our study leverages the power of big data
in the form of pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) within the
framework of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) and ensemble learning. We propose an
ensemble approach based on a Prototypical Network (ProtoNet), a powerful method
in FSL, integrating various pre-trained CNNs as encoders. This integration
enhances the richness of features extracted from medical images. Our approach
also includes a combination of class-aware loss and entropy loss to ensure a
more precise classification of Alzheimer disease progression levels. The
effectiveness of our method was evaluated using two datasets, the Kaggle
Alzheimer dataset and the ADNI dataset, achieving an accuracy of 99.72% and
99.86%, respectively. The comparison of our results with relevant
state-of-the-art studies demonstrated that our approach achieved superior
accuracy and highlighted its validity and potential for real-world applications
in early Alzheimer disease detection.

TL;DR: 提出统一强化与模仿学习(RIL)算法，通过结合强化学习和对抗模仿学习，让小型视觉语言模型既能模仿大型教师模型的文本生成，又能通过强化信号系统性提升生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)虽然取得了显著进展，但其大规模特性在资源受限环境中不实用，需要开发高效的训练算法来创建轻量级但强大的VLMs。

Method: RIL结合强化学习和对抗模仿学习，使用基于LLM的判别器区分学生和教师输出，并利用多个大型教师VLMs提供多样化指导。

Result: 在多个视觉语言基准测试中，RIL显著缩小了与最先进开源和闭源VLMs的性能差距，并在多个实例中超越了它们。

Conclusion: 统一的强化与模仿学习策略使学生模型获得显著性能提升，使其能够与领先的闭源VLMs竞争。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their
large scale often renders them impractical for resource-constrained
environments. This paper introduces Unified Reinforcement and Imitation
Learning (RIL), a novel and efficient training algorithm designed to create
powerful, lightweight VLMs. RIL distinctively combines the strengths of
reinforcement learning with adversarial imitation learning. This enables
smaller student VLMs not only to mimic the sophisticated text generation of
large teacher models but also to systematically improve their generative
capabilities through reinforcement signals. Key to our imitation framework is
an LLM-based discriminator that adeptly distinguishes between student and
teacher outputs, complemented by guidance from multiple large teacher VLMs to
ensure diverse learning. This unified learning strategy, leveraging both
reinforcement and imitation, empowers student models to achieve significant
performance gains, making them competitive with leading closed-source VLMs.
Extensive experiments on diverse vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that
RIL significantly narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art open- and
closed-source VLMs and, in several instances, surpasses them.

Abstract: Handwritten signature verification is a crucial aspect of identity
authentication, with applications in various domains such as finance and
e-commerce. However, achieving high accuracy in signature verification remains
challenging due to intra-user variability and the risk of forgery. This paper
introduces a novel approach for dynamic signature verification: the
Temporal-Spatial Graph Attention Transformer (TS-GATR). TS-GATR combines the
Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to model both
spatial and temporal dependencies in signature data. TS-GATR enhances
verification performance by representing signatures as graphs, where each node
captures dynamic features (e.g. position, velocity, pressure), and by using
attention mechanisms to model their complex relationships. The proposed method
further employs a Dual-Graph Attention Transformer (DGATR) module, which
utilizes k-step and k-nearest neighbor adjacency graphs to model local and
global spatial features, respectively. To capture long-term temporal
dependencies, the model integrates GRU, thereby enhancing its ability to learn
dynamic features during signature verification. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on benchmark datasets such as MSDS and DeepSignDB show that TS-GATR
surpasses current state-of-the-art approaches, consistently achieving lower
Equal Error Rates (EER) across various scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Seabed-Net是一个统一的多任务框架，通过同时预测水深测量和像素级海底分类，解决了传统方法将这两个任务孤立处理的问题，在浅水环境测绘中实现了协同增益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的从遥感影像中推导水深或海底类别的方法将这些任务孤立处理，丧失了它们相互作用的优势，阻碍了深度学习方法的广泛应用。准确、详细且定期更新的水深测量数据对于面临日益增长的气候和人为压力的浅水环境至关重要。

Result: 在两个异质性沿海站点的广泛评估中，Seabed-Net始终优于传统经验模型和传统机器学习回归方法，实现了高达75%的RMSE降低。与最先进的单任务和多任务基线相比，水深RMSE降低了10-30%，海底分类准确率提高了8%。

Conclusion: 联合建模水深与海底底质和栖息地能够产生协同增益，为集成浅水测绘提供了一个稳健的开放解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and regularly updated bathymetry, coupled with complex
semantic content, is essential for under-mapped shallow-water environments
facing increasing climatological and anthropogenic pressures. However, existing
approaches that derive either depth or seabed classes from remote sensing
imagery treat these tasks in isolation, forfeiting the mutual benefits of their
interaction and hindering the broader adoption of deep learning methods. To
address these limitations, we introduce Seabed-Net, a unified multi-task
framework that simultaneously predicts bathymetry and pixel-based seabed
classification from remote sensing imagery of various resolutions. Seabed-Net
employs dual-branch encoders for bathymetry estimation and pixel-based seabed
classification, integrates cross-task features via an Attention Feature Fusion
module and a windowed Swin-Transformer fusion block, and balances objectives
through dynamic task uncertainty weighting. In extensive evaluations at two
heterogeneous coastal sites, it consistently outperforms traditional empirical
models and traditional machine learning regression methods, achieving up to
75\% lower RMSE. It also reduces bathymetric RMSE by 10-30\% compared to
state-of-the-art single-task and multi-task baselines and improves seabed
classification accuracy up to 8\%. Qualitative analyses further demonstrate
enhanced spatial consistency, sharper habitat boundaries, and corrected depth
biases in low-contrast regions. These results confirm that jointly modeling
depth with both substrate and seabed habitats yields synergistic gains,
offering a robust, open solution for integrated shallow-water mapping. Code and
pretrained weights are available at https://github.com/pagraf/Seabed-Net.

Abstract: Crowd localization plays a crucial role in visual scene understanding towards
predicting each pedestrian location in a crowd, thus being applicable to
various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches suffer from significant
performance degradation due to discrepancies in head scale distributions (scale
shift) between training and testing data, a challenge known as domain
generalization (DG). This paper aims to comprehend the nature of scale shift
within the context of domain generalization for crowd localization models. To
this end, we address four critical questions: (i) How does scale shift
influence crowd localization in a DG scenario? (ii) How can we quantify this
influence? (iii) What causes this influence? (iv) How to mitigate the
influence? Initially, we conduct a systematic examination of how crowd
localization performance varies with different levels of scale shift. Then, we
establish a benchmark, ScaleBench, and reproduce 20 advanced DG algorithms to
quantify the influence. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
limitations of existing algorithms and underscore the importance and complexity
of scale shift, a topic that remains insufficiently explored. To deepen our
understanding, we provide a rigorous theoretical analysis on scale shift.
Building on these insights, we further propose an effective algorithm called
Causal Feature Decomposition and Anisotropic Processing (Catto) to mitigate the
influence of scale shift in DG settings. Later, we also provide extensive
analytical experiments, revealing four significant insights for future
research. Our results emphasize the importance of this novel and applicable
research direction, which we term Scale Shift Domain Generalization.

TL;DR: BrainMCLIP提出了一种参数高效的多层融合方法，通过将fMRI信号与CLIP中间层对齐，无需单独的VAE通路即可实现高质量的图像解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将fMRI映射到CLIP的最终语义层，忽略了CLIP中间层的丰富物体信息，且与大脑功能层次结构不符。需要参数密集的VAE管道来捕获视觉细节。

Method: 基于人类视觉系统功能层次结构，将fMRI信号从不同视觉区域（低/高级）对齐到相应的CLIP中间层和最终层，引入交叉重建策略和多粒度损失函数。

Result: 在高级语义指标上达到或超越最先进方法，包括使用VAE管道的方法，同时参数减少71.7%，有效捕获CLIP-only方法常遗漏的视觉细节。

Conclusion: BrainMCLIP通过利用CLIP中间特征，在语义准确性和细节保真度之间取得了良好平衡，无需单独的VAE管道。

Abstract: Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's
final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a
parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich
object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the
brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a
parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual
system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE
pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas
(low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers,
respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction
strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves
highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic
metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including
those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer
parameters, demonstrating a reduction of
71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA
methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features,
it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches,
striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity
without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image
segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a
convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a
vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed
framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed
by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage,
pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular
value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered
using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The
number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular
values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded
into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text
embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific
prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set
recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into
a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment.
Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between
the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on
standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and
F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and
generalizability of the proposed framework.

Abstract: Mobile Phone Agents (MPAs) have emerged as a promising research direction due
to their broad applicability across diverse scenarios. While Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) serve as the foundation for MPAs, their effectiveness
in handling multiple mobile phone tasks simultaneously remains limited.
Although multitask supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely adopted for multitask

compositions for peak performance. To address this challenge, we propose DaMo
(Data Mixture Optimizer) - a novel solution employing a trainable network that
predicts optimal data mixtures by forecasting downstream task performance for
any given dataset ratio. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce
PhoneAgentBench, the first specialized benchmark to evaluate MLLMs on
multimodal mobile phone tasks, comprising 1235 QA pairs spanning diverse
real-world industrial mobile application scenarios. Demonstrating strong
predictive capability (R^2=0.81) in small-scale pilot experiments, DaMo
efficiently extrapolates optimal data mixing configurations. Our results show
DaMo achieves a 3.38% performance improvement on PhoneAgentBench compared to
alternative methods. Furthermore, extensive experiments across established
benchmarks including BFCL-v3, MME-Reasoning, MME-Perception, and OCRBench
reveal DaMo's superior generalization, outperforming other approaches by 2.57%
in terms of average score. When used solely for MLLM optimization on the
BFCL-v3 task, DaMo improves the metrics by 12.47% than other methods. Notably,
DaMo maintains robust scalability, preserving its effectiveness when applied to
other model architectures. The code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 提出DARE框架，通过动态调整弹性正则化来改善医学图像配准的鲁棒性和解剖学合理性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在医学图像配准中忽视了正则化的重要性，导致缺乏鲁棒性和解剖学合理性

Method: 基于变形场梯度范数动态调整弹性正则化，整合应变和剪切能量项，并包含折叠预防机制

Result: 提高了配准精度和解剖学合理性，同时避免了过度平滑和非物理伪影

Conclusion: DARE框架在医学图像配准中实现了稳定性与灵活性的平衡，提供了更可靠的配准结果

Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is a fundamental task in medical image
analysis. While deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior accuracy
and computational efficiency compared to traditional techniques, they often
overlook the critical role of regularization in ensuring robustness and
anatomical plausibility. We propose DARE (Deformable Adaptive Regularization
Estimator), a novel registration framework that dynamically adjusts elastic
regularization based on the gradient norm of the deformation field. Our
approach integrates strain and shear energy terms, which are adaptively
modulated to balance stability and flexibility. To ensure physically realistic
transformations, DARE includes a folding-prevention mechanism that penalizes
regions with negative deformation Jacobian. This strategy mitigates
non-physical artifacts such as folding, avoids over-smoothing, and improves
both registration accuracy and anatomical plausibility

TL;DR: AegisRF是一个保护NeRF模型知识产权的框架，通过注入对抗性扰动来破坏未经授权的下游应用，同时保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着NeRF在3D场景表示和新视角合成中的广泛应用，保护其知识产权免受未经授权使用变得至关重要。现有方法避免几何扰动或限制在显式空间中，因为这会严重降低渲染质量。

Method: 提出AegisRF框架，包含扰动场和敏感度场。扰动场在NeRF预渲染输出中注入对抗性扰动来欺骗下游模型；敏感度场学习空间变化的几何扰动敏感度，自适应约束扰动以保持渲染质量。

Result: 实验评估表明AegisRF在多种下游任务和模态中具有广泛适用性，包括多视图图像分类和基于体素的3D定位，同时保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: AegisRF成功解决了NeRF知识产权保护问题，在保持渲染质量的同时有效破坏未经授权的使用，为3D场景表示模型提供了实用的IP保护方案。

Abstract: As Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have emerged as a powerful tool for 3D
scene representation and novel view synthesis, protecting their intellectual
property (IP) from unauthorized use is becoming increasingly crucial. In this
work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations
that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D
geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus
substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to
avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify
the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.
Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a
Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the
pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an
unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the
sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving
rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse
downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and
voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity. Codes are
available at https://github.com/wkim97/AegisRF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM评估主要关注单视角设置，而多摄像头配置在机器人平台中日益普遍，但VLM能否有效利用多视角输入进行机器人推理仍是一个开放性问题。

Method: 构建MV-RoboBench基准测试，评估包括开源和闭源模型在内的多样化VLM，以及结合思维链技术的增强版本。

Result: 最先进模型的表现远低于人类水平，多视角空间智能与机器人任务执行呈正相关，现有单视角基准测试的强表现不能可靠转化为机器人空间任务的成功。

Conclusion: VLM在多视角机器人感知方面面临重大挑战，MV-RoboBench作为开放资源促进空间基础VLM和VLA的发展，提供标准化评估协议。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are essential to Embodied AI, enabling robots
to perceive, reason, and act in complex environments. They also serve as the
foundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most
evaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to
integrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera
setups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide
complementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether
VLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning
therefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce
MV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view
spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench
consists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into
two primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We
evaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and
closed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired
techniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below
human performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in
multi-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key
findings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively
correlated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on
existing general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not
reliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our
benchmark. We release MV-RoboBench as an open resource to foster progress in
spatially grounded VLMs and VLAs, providing not only data but also a
standardized evaluation protocol for multi-view embodied reasoning.

Conclusion: 基于脚部位置的多摄像头坐标对齐方法能有效减少广角摄像头失真影响，显著提高仓库工人跟踪精度，为数字孪生应用提供了可靠的技术支撑

Abstract: With the spread of e-commerce, the logistics market is growing around the
world. Therefore, improving the efficiency of warehouse operations is
essential. To achieve this, various approaches have been explored, and among
them, the use of digital twins is gaining attention. To make this approach
possible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a
warehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has
limitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is
necessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19
wide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the
logistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera
coordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment
based on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle
cameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly
in the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from
each camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image
distortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras. As a
result, we confirmed an improvement of over 20% in tracking accuracy.
Furthermore, we compared multiple methods for utilizing appearance features and
validated the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在客观感知任务中表现出色，但在主观、情感丰富领域如心理分析中的应用仍待探索。

Method: 1) 将包含多个实例的绘画分解为语义子图，构建层次表示；2) 在各层次分析子图，提取心理洞察；3) 引入HTP知识库和特征提取模块，生成心理画像；4) 整合多源信息进行综合评估。

Result: 实验结果表明PICK显著增强了MLLMs在心理分析方面的能力，并在情感理解任务中得到验证。

Conclusion: PICK弥合了MLLMs与专业领域之间的差距，为通过视觉表达理解人类心理状态提供了结构化、可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated exceptional
performance across various objective multimodal perception tasks, yet their
application to subjective, emotionally nuanced domains, such as psychological
analysis, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce PICK, a
multi-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through
hierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing
on the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in
clinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances
into semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical
representation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:
single-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze
these sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting
psychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce
an HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with
reinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object
level analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and
dynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),
correlating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these
multi-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns
with expert-level reasoning. Our approach bridges the gap between MLLMs and
specialized expert domains, offering a structured and interpretable framework
for understanding human mental states through visual expression. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed PICK significantly enhances the
capability of MLLMs in psychological analysis. It is further validated as a
general framework through extensions to emotion understanding tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ReCAME-Net模型来解决IC缺陷分类中的极端不平衡数据问题，并发布了IC-Defect-14数据集，该数据集具有独特的"类内聚类"特性，包含大类内多样性和高类间相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度分类技术和实验室自动光学检测模型在应用于真实世界IC缺陷分类任务时面临两大挑战：1）IC行业高良率要求导致数据分布比公开不平衡数据集更偏斜；2）真实样本包含类特定属性和类无关的领域特征，增加了分类难度。

Method: 提出ReCAME-Net模型，采用多专家分类器框架，集成了区域通道注意力模块、度量学习损失、困难类别挖掘策略和知识蒸馏过程。

Result: 在IC-Defect-14数据集上，ReCAME-Net显著优于现有最先进模型，同时在通用公共数据集上保持可比性能和竞争力。

Conclusion: ReCAME-Net有效解决了IC缺陷分类中的极端不平衡问题，特别是在具有"类内聚类"特性的数据集上表现优异，为真实世界IC生产环境中的缺陷检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in deep classification techniques and in-lab
automatic optical inspection models for long-tailed or highly imbalanced data,
applying these approaches to real-world IC defect classification tasks remains
challenging. This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world
conditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result
in data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general
public imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open
imbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.
Second, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and
class-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant
difficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced
datasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14
dataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI
systems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is
characterized by its unique "intra-class clusters" property, which presents two
major challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.
These characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,
significantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers
for highly imbalanced data. To tackle this challenge, we propose ReCAME-Net,
which follows a multi-expert classifier framework and integrates a regional
channel attention module, metric learning losses, a hard category mining
strategy, and a knowledge distillation procedure. Extensive experimental
evaluations demonstrate that ReCAME-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art
models on the IC-Defect-14 dataset while maintaining comparable performance and
competitiveness on general public datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一个多条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)框架，用于生成具有精确控制属性的代表性孔隙尺度图像，解决了地下表征中的代表性和数据稀缺问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取真正代表整体地层性质的孔隙尺度图像是地下表征的基本挑战，因为自然空间异质性导致提取的子图像与岩心测量值显著偏离，且物理样本仅在稀疏井位可用。

Method: 使用多条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)框架，在碳酸盐岩地层四个深度的薄片样本上训练，同时以孔隙度值和深度参数为条件，捕捉通用孔隙网络原理和深度特定地质特征。

Result: 模型在所有地层中实现了出色的孔隙度控制(R^2=0.95)，平均绝对误差0.0099-0.0197。生成图像的代表性误差为1.9-11.3%，远优于随机提取真实子图像的36.4-578%。

Conclusion: 该能力为地下表征提供了变革性工具，特别适用于碳储存、地热能源和地下水管理应用，其中了解孔隙空间的代表性形态对于实施数字岩石物理至关重要。

Abstract: Obtaining truly representative pore-scale images that match bulk formation
properties remains a fundamental challenge in subsurface characterization, as
natural spatial heterogeneity causes extracted sub-images to deviate
significantly from core-measured values. This challenge is compounded by data
scarcity, where physical samples are only available at sparse well locations.
This study presents a multi-conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)
framework that generates representative pore-scale images with precisely
controlled properties, addressing both the representativeness challenge and
data availability constraints. The framework was trained on thin section
samples from four depths (1879.50-1943.50 m) of a carbonate formation,
simultaneously conditioning on porosity values and depth parameters within a
single unified model. This approach captures both universal pore network
principles and depth-specific geological characteristics, from grainstone
fabrics with interparticle-intercrystalline porosity to crystalline textures
with anhydrite inclusions. The model achieved exceptional porosity control
(R^2=0.95) across all formations with mean absolute errors of 0.0099-0.0197.
Morphological validation confirmed preservation of critical pore network
characteristics including average pore radius, specific surface area, and
tortuosity, with statistical differences remaining within acceptable geological
tolerances. Most significantly, generated images demonstrated superior
representativeness with dual-constraint errors of 1.9-11.3% compared to
36.4-578% for randomly extracted real sub-images. This capability provides
transformative tools for subsurface characterization, particularly valuable for
carbon storage, geothermal energy, and groundwater management applications
where knowing the representative morphology of the pore space is critical for
implementing digital rock physics.

Motivation: MRI采集时间过长限制了临床效率，需要新的方法来加速MRI扫描过程。

Method: 使用生成模型基于多种数据源（其他对比度图像、历史扫描图像、采集参数、患者信息）预测目标对比度图像，然后将其作为先验信息来重建欠采样数据。

Result: 在内部和多个公共数据集（总计14,921次扫描；1,051,904个切片）上评估，包括多通道k空间数据，在多种高加速因子（x4、x8和x12）下，该方法显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该框架引入了从图像重建向预测性成像的根本转变，为MRI加速提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence have created transformative
capabilities in image synthesis and generation, enabling diverse research
fields to innovate at revolutionary speed and spectrum. In this study, we
leverage this generative power to introduce a new paradigm for accelerating
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), introducing a shift from image reconstruction
to proactive predictive imaging. Despite being a cornerstone of modern patient
care, MRI's lengthy acquisition times limit clinical throughput. Our novel
framework addresses this challenge by first predicting a target contrast image,
which then serves as a data-driven prior for reconstructing highly
under-sampled data. This informative prior is predicted by a generative model
conditioned on diverse data sources, such as other contrast images, previously
scanned images, acquisition parameters, patient information. We demonstrate
this approach with two key applications: (1) reconstructing FLAIR images using
predictions from T1w and/or T2w scans, and (2) reconstructing T1w images using
predictions from previously acquired T1w scans. The framework was evaluated on
internal and multiple public datasets (total 14,921 scans; 1,051,904 slices),
including multi-channel k-space data, for a range of high acceleration factors
(x4, x8 and x12). The results demonstrate that our prediction-prior
reconstruction method significantly outperforms other approaches, including
those with alternative or no prior information. Through this framework we
introduce a fundamental shift from image reconstruction towards a new paradigm
of predictive imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频方法仅处理单个序列，无法利用跨序列中普遍存在的结构规律性和重复运动模式，限制了3D姿态估计的性能提升。

Method: 提出PRGCN框架，包含图记忆库学习姿态原型，通过注意力机制动态检索并提供结构化先验，结合双流混合架构融合Mamba状态空间模型和自注意力的优势。

Result: 在Human3.6M上达到37.1mm MPJPE，在MPI-INF-3DHP上达到13.4mm MPJPE，建立了新的最先进水平，并展现出增强的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 跨序列模式重用机制是推动领域发展的关键，将范式从单序列优化转向累积知识学习。

Abstract: Monocular 3D human pose estimation remains a fundamentally ill-posed inverse
problem due to the inherent depth ambiguity in 2D-to-3D lifting. While
contemporary video-based methods leverage temporal context to enhance spatial
reasoning, they operate under a critical paradigm limitation: processing each
sequence in isolation, thereby failing to exploit the strong structural
regularities and repetitive motion patterns that pervade human movement across
sequences. This work introduces the Pattern Reuse Graph Convolutional Network
(PRGCN), a novel framework that formalizes pose estimation as a problem of
pattern retrieval and adaptation. At its core, PRGCN features a graph memory
bank that learns and stores a compact set of pose prototypes, encoded as
relational graphs, which are dynamically retrieved via an attention mechanism
to provide structured priors. These priors are adaptively fused with hard-coded
anatomical constraints through a memory-driven graph convolution, ensuring
geometrical plausibility. To underpin this retrieval process with robust
spatiotemporal features, we design a dual-stream hybrid architecture that
synergistically combines the linear-complexity, local temporal modeling of
Mamba-based state-space models with the global relational capacity of
self-attention. Extensive evaluations on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks
demonstrate that PRGCN establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an MPJPE
of 37.1mm and 13.4mm, respectively, while exhibiting enhanced cross-domain
generalization capability. Our work posits that the long-overlooked mechanism
of cross-sequence pattern reuse is pivotal to advancing the field, shifting the
paradigm from per-sequence optimization towards cumulative knowledge learning.

TL;DR: 该论文针对卫星图像中系统缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提出了重采样和插值两种方法来消除甲烷羽流检测中标签与覆盖率之间的虚假关联。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星图像由于云层等因素存在系统缺失像素，这些缺失数据会导致自动化特征提取模型出现表示偏差。研究发现甲烷羽流检测中标签与缺失值数量之间存在虚假关联，导致模型在低覆盖率图像中检测性能下降。

Method: 评估了多种插值方法，并提出在训练期间使用加权重采样方案，通过在每个覆盖率区间强制类别平衡来消除标签与覆盖率之间的关联。

Result: 实验结果表明，重采样和插值方法都能显著减少表示偏差，同时不会损害平衡准确率、精确率或召回率。在操作场景中，去偏模型在低覆盖率图像中检测羽流的概率更高。

Conclusion: 提出的去偏方法有效解决了卫星图像中系统缺失像素导致的表示偏差问题，提高了甲烷羽流检测模型在低覆盖率图像中的性能。

Abstract: Most satellite images have systematically missing pixels (i.e., missing data
not at random (MNAR)) due to factors such as clouds. If not addressed, these
missing pixels can lead to representation bias in automated feature extraction
models. In this work, we show that spurious association between the label and
the number of missing values in methane plume detection can cause the model to
associate the coverage (i.e., the percentage of valid pixels in an image) with
the label, subsequently under-detecting plumes in low-coverage images. We
evaluate multiple imputation approaches to remove the dependence between the
coverage and a label. Additionally, we propose a weighted resampling scheme
during training that removes the association between the label and the coverage
by enforcing class balance in each coverage bin. Our results show that both
resampling and imputation can significantly reduce the representation bias
without hurting balanced accuracy, precision, or recall. Finally, we evaluate
the capability of the debiased models using these techniques in an operational
scenario and demonstrate that the debiased models have a higher chance of
detecting plumes in low-coverage images.

Conclusion: Cauvis方法有效解决了单源域泛化中的伪相关问题，通过因果视觉提示机制显著提升了模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Single-source Domain Generalized Object Detection (SDGOD), as a cutting-edge
research topic in computer vision, aims to enhance model generalization
capability in unseen target domains through single-source domain training.
Current mainstream approaches attempt to mitigate domain discrepancies via data
augmentation techniques. However, due to domain shift and limited
domain-specific knowledge, models tend to fall into the pitfall of spurious
correlations. This manifests as the model's over-reliance on simplistic
classification features (e.g., color) rather than essential domain-invariant
representations like object contours. To address this critical challenge, we
propose the Cauvis (Causal Visual Prompts) method. First, we introduce a
Cross-Attention Prompts module that mitigates bias from spurious features by
integrating visual prompts with cross-attention. To address the inadequate
domain knowledge coverage and spurious feature entanglement in visual prompts
for single-domain generalization, we propose a dual-branch adapter that
disentangles causal-spurious features while achieving domain adaptation via
high-frequency feature extraction. Cauvis achieves state-of-the-art performance
with 15.9-31.4% gains over existing domain generalization methods on SDGOD
datasets, while exhibiting significant robustness advantages in complex
interference environments.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) commonly process images at native or high
resolution to remain effective across tasks. This inflates visual tokens ofter
to 97-99% of total tokens, resulting in high compute and latency, even when
low-resolution images would suffice. We introduce \emph{CARES}-a
\textbf{C}ontext-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{S}elector, a
lightweight preprocessing module that, given an image-query pair, predicts the
\emph{minimal} sufficient input resolution. CARES uses a compact VLM (350M) to
extract features and predict when a target pretrained VLM's response converges
to its peak ability to answer correctly. Though trained as a discrete

*Qing Mao,Tianxin Huang,Yu Zhu,Jinqiu Sun,Yanning Zhang,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PoseCrafter方法，通过混合视频生成和特征匹配选择器解决稀疏重叠图像对的相机位姿估计问题，显著提升了小重叠或无重叠情况下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理小重叠或无重叠图像对时表现不佳，视频插值生成的中间帧模糊且选择策略效率低，需要更清晰的中间帧生成和更有效的帧选择方法。

Method: 提出混合视频生成(HVG)结合视频插值模型和位姿条件新视角合成模型生成清晰中间帧，并使用基于特征匹配的选择器(FMS)选择适合位姿估计的帧。

Result: 在Cambridge Landmarks、ScanNet、DL3DV-10K和NAVI数据集上的实验表明，相比现有SOTA方法，PoseCrafter显著提升了位姿估计性能，特别是在小重叠或无重叠情况下。

Conclusion: PoseCrafter通过混合视频生成和特征匹配选择器有效解决了稀疏重叠图像对的相机位姿估计问题，为小重叠场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Pairwise camera pose estimation from sparsely overlapping image pairs remains
a critical and unsolved challenge in 3D vision. Most existing methods struggle
with image pairs that have small or no overlap. Recent approaches attempt to
address this by synthesizing intermediate frames using video interpolation and
selecting key frames via a self-consistency score. However, the generated
frames are often blurry due to small overlap inputs, and the selection
strategies are slow and not explicitly aligned with pose estimation. To solve
these cases, we propose Hybrid Video Generation (HVG) to synthesize clearer
intermediate frames by coupling a video interpolation model with a
pose-conditioned novel view synthesis model, where we also propose a Feature
Matching Selector (FMS) based on feature correspondence to select intermediate
frames appropriate for pose estimation from the synthesized results. Extensive
experiments on Cambridge Landmarks, ScanNet, DL3DV-10K, and NAVI demonstrate
that, compared to existing SOTA methods, PoseCrafter can obviously enhance the
pose estimation performances, especially on examples with small or no overlap.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在计数任务中存在显著缺陷，通过仅微调输出层即可提升准确率高达21%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉推理方面存在多个限制，特别是在识别关系、理解时间序列和计数对象方面表现不佳，需要深入分析失败原因并针对性改进

Method: 在受控实验条件下研究7个SOTA视觉语言模型的计数能力，进行分层分析，并仅对输出层进行针对性训练

Result: 发现VLMs对对象数量、类型、空间排列和干扰物高度敏感，错误主要源于最后一层表示到输出空间的映射错误，仅微调输出层即可提升准确率21%

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的推理能力可以通过针对性微调输出层显著改善，这一发现在真实数据集上得到验证

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently gained attention due to their
competitive performance on multiple downstream tasks, achieved by following
user-input instructions. However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in
visual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,
temporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),
and counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark
evaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures
and proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We
study the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task
under controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are
highly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,
and the co-occurrence of distractors. A layer-wise analysis reveals that errors
are due to incorrect mapping of the last-layer representation into the output
space. Our targeted training shows that fine-tuning just the output layer
improves accuracy by up to 21%. We corroborate these findings by achieving
consistent improvements on real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了提示词复杂度对文生图模型生成合成数据质量、多样性和一致性的影响，发现增加提示复杂度会降低条件多样性和提示一致性，但减少合成与真实数据的分布差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然文生图模型能生成无限合成数据，但提示词工程作为主要交互方式，其对合成数据关键效用轴（质量、多样性、一致性）的系统性影响尚未充分探索。

Method: 首先通过合成实验验证提示词复杂度泛化的困难性并提供理论解释，然后引入新评估框架比较真实与合成数据效用，在CC12M、ImageNet-1k和DCI等数据集上分析不同推理时干预方法。

Result: 增加提示复杂度导致条件多样性和提示一致性降低，但减少合成-真实分布偏移。提示扩展方法通过预训练语言模型作为似然估计器，在图像多样性和美学上表现最佳，甚至超过真实数据。

Conclusion: 提示复杂度对合成数据效用有显著影响，当前推理时干预方法能在牺牲真实数据支持范围的情况下增强多样性，其中提示扩展方法表现最优。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models offer great potential for creating virtually
limitless synthetic data, a valuable resource compared to fixed and finite real
datasets. Previous works evaluate the utility of synthetic data from T2I models
on three key desiderata: quality, diversity, and consistency. While prompt
engineering is the primary means of interacting with T2I models, the systematic
impact of prompt complexity on these critical utility axes remains
underexplored. In this paper, we first conduct synthetic experiments to
motivate the difficulty of generalization w.r.t. prompt complexity and explain
the observed difficulty with theoretical derivations. Then, we introduce a new
evaluation framework that can compare the utility of real data and synthetic
data, and present a comprehensive analysis of how prompt complexity influences
the utility of synthetic data generated by commonly used T2I models. We conduct
our study across diverse datasets, including CC12M, ImageNet-1k, and DCI, and
evaluate different inference-time intervention methods. Our synthetic
experiments show that generalizing to more general conditions is harder than
the other way round, since the former needs an estimated likelihood that is not
learned by diffusion models. Our large-scale empirical experiments reveal that
increasing prompt complexity results in lower conditional diversity and prompt
consistency, while reducing the synthetic-to-real distribution shift, which
aligns with the synthetic experiments. Moreover, current inference-time
interventions can augment the diversity of the generations at the expense of
moving outside the support of real data. Among those interventions, prompt
expansion, by deliberately using a pre-trained language model as a likelihood
estimator, consistently achieves the highest performance in both image
diversity and aesthetics, even higher than that of real data.

TL;DR: 本文研究了大规模视觉语言模型的时间感知能力，提出了TIME10k基准数据集，发现时间信息在VLM嵌入空间中呈低维非线性流形结构，并开发了从嵌入空间提取显式时间线表示的方法。

Motivation: 研究大规模视觉语言模型（如CLIP）是否具备时间感知能力，即能否将视觉内容定位到特定时间点，这对于理解模型的时空理解能力具有重要意义。

Method: 构建了包含10,000多张图像的时间基准数据集TIME10k，评估了37个VLM的时间感知能力，提出从VLM嵌入空间中提取显式时间线表示的新方法。

Result: 发现时间信息在VLM嵌入空间中沿着低维非线性流形结构分布，提出的时间线方法在时间推理任务中达到了与基于提示的基线方法相当或更优的准确率，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型确实具备时间感知能力，时间信息在嵌入空间中具有可识别的结构特征，提出的时间线表示方法能够有效支持时间推理任务。

Abstract: Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have gained popularity
for their generalizable and expressive multimodal representations. By
leveraging large-scale training data with diverse textual metadata, VLMs
acquire open-vocabulary capabilities, solving tasks beyond their training
scope. This paper investigates the temporal awareness of VLMs, assessing their
ability to position visual content in time. We introduce TIME10k, a benchmark
dataset of over 10,000 images with temporal ground truth, and evaluate the
time-awareness of 37 VLMs by a novel methodology. Our investigation reveals
that temporal information is structured along a low-dimensional, non-linear
manifold in the VLM embedding space. Based on this insight, we propose methods
to derive an explicit ``timeline'' representation from the embedding space.
These representations model time and its chronological progression and thereby
facilitate temporal reasoning tasks. Our timeline approaches achieve
competitive to superior accuracy compared to a prompt-based baseline while
being computationally efficient. All code and data are available at

TL;DR: 提出HAD框架，通过分层非对称蒸馏解决RGB相机和事件相机之间的时空不对称问题，提升多模态目标跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB相机和事件相机具有互补优势，但存在显著的时空不对称性，阻碍了有效的多模态融合。

Method: 采用分层对齐策略的多模态知识蒸馏框架，在保持学生网络计算效率和参数紧凑性的同时最小化信息损失。

Result: 在广泛实验中一致优于最先进方法，消融研究验证了各设计组件的有效性和必要性。

Conclusion: HAD框架成功解决了多模态融合中的时空不对称问题，为挑战性条件下的目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial
resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a
high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can
substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as
high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference.
However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two
modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering
effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose
{Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge
distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal
asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that
minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's
computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and
comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity
of each designed component. The code will be released soon.

TL;DR: α-Cloak是首个在无盒设置下通过RGBA视频的alpha通道对目标检测器进行对抗攻击的方法，利用alpha通道融合恶意和良性视频，使融合视频对人类无害但能持续欺骗目标检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着目标检测模型在自动驾驶车辆等网络物理系统中的部署增加，确保其对抗威胁的安全性变得至关重要。现有研究主要探索图像域的对抗攻击，而视频域的攻击，特别是在无盒设置下的攻击，仍未得到充分研究。

Method: α-Cloak通过RGBA视频的alpha通道将恶意目标视频与良性视频融合，设计融合算法确保视觉隐蔽性和兼容性，无需访问模型架构、参数或输出。

Result: 在五个最先进的目标检测器、一个视觉语言模型和一个多模态大语言模型上评估，攻击成功率在所有场景下达到100%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频感知系统中一个先前未被探索的漏洞，强调了在对抗环境中考虑alpha通道的防御措施的紧迫性。

Abstract: As object detection models are increasingly deployed in cyber-physical
systems such as autonomous vehicles (AVs) and surveillance platforms, ensuring
their security against adversarial threats is essential. While prior work has
explored adversarial attacks in the image domain, those attacks in the video
domain remain largely unexamined, especially in the no-box setting. In this
paper, we present {\alpha}-Cloak, the first no-box adversarial attack on object
detectors that operates entirely through the alpha channel of RGBA videos.
{\alpha}-Cloak exploits the alpha channel to fuse a malicious target video with
a benign video, resulting in a fused video that appears innocuous to human
viewers but consistently fools object detectors. Our attack requires no access
to model architecture, parameters, or outputs, and introduces no perceptible
artifacts. We systematically study the support for alpha channels across common
video formats and playback applications, and design a fusion algorithm that
ensures visual stealth and compatibility. We evaluate {\alpha}-Cloak on five
state-of-the-art object detectors, a vision-language model, and a multi-modal
large language model (Gemini-2.0-Flash), demonstrating a 100% attack success
rate across all scenarios. Our findings reveal a previously unexplored
vulnerability in video-based perception systems, highlighting the urgent need
for defenses that account for the alpha channel in adversarial settings.

Motivation: 环绕视图自动驾驶场景重建面临核心挑战：在确保泛化能力的同时提升新视角质量。由于环绕视图重叠区域极少，现有方法难以保证几何一致性和新视角重建质量。

Method: 1) 设计轻量级VGGT变体从预训练VGGT中提取几何先验；2) 设计高斯头融合多尺度几何token预测新视角渲染的高斯参数；3) 集成几何和高斯头分支的多尺度特征，通过特征一致性学习联合监督语义细化模型。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的实验表明，该方法在各种设置下客观指标和主观质量均显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: VGD框架验证了其可扩展性和高保真环绕视图重建能力，通过显式几何学习和特征一致性优化有效解决了环绕视图重建的核心挑战。

Abstract: Feed-forward surround-view autonomous driving scene reconstruction offers
fast, generalizable inference ability, which faces the core challenge of
ensuring generalization while elevating novel view quality. Due to the
surround-view with minimal overlap regions, existing methods typically fail to
ensure geometric consistency and reconstruction quality for novel views. To
tackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned
explicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the
elevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce
\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end
learning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable
geometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture
to efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the
geometry branch. Furthermore, we design a Gaussian Head that fuses multi-scale
geometry tokens to predict Gaussian parameters for novel view rendering, which
shares the same patch backbone as the geometry branch. Finally, we integrate
multi-scale features from both geometry and Gaussian head branches to jointly
supervise a semantic refinement model, optimizing rendering quality through
feature-consistent learning. Experiments on nuScenes demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective
metrics and subjective quality under various settings, which validates VGD's
scalability and high-fidelity surround-view reconstruction.

Abstract: Multi-modal co-learning is emerging as an effective paradigm in machine
learning, enabling models to collaboratively learn from different modalities to
enhance single-modality predictions. Earth Observation (EO) represents a
quintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote
sensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data
introduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor
modalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex
based on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this
context, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the
vast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve
single-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research
efforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular
downstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To
address this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of
generalizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for
inference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative
learning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal
model manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We
evaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and
regression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the
modalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our
results demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art
approaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as
well as EO-specific methods. The obtained findings validate our framework in
the single-modality inference scenarios across a diverse range of EO
applications.

Conclusion: VAEEDOF方法在多焦点图像融合领域取得显著进展，为解决复杂融合挑战提供了重要解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) addresses the depth-of-field (DOF)
limitations of optical lenses, where only objects within a specific range
appear sharp. Although traditional and deep learning methods have advanced the
field, challenges persist, including limited training data, domain gaps from
synthetic datasets, and difficulties with regions lacking information. We
propose VAEEDOF, a novel MFIF method that uses a distilled variational
autoencoder for high-fidelity, efficient image reconstruction. Our fusion
module processes up to seven images simultaneously, enabling robust fusion
across diverse focus points. To address data scarcity, we introduce
MattingMFIF, a new syntetic 4K dataset, simulating realistic DOF effects from
real photographs. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results, generating
seamless artifact-free fused images and bridging the gap between synthetic and
real-world scenarios, offering a significant step forward in addressing complex
MFIF challenges. The code, and weights are available here:

utility of uncertainty measures, testing their ability to identify prediction
errors and noise-corrupted input image regions. Experiments are conducted on
two remote sensing datasets, PASTIS and ForTy, selected for their differences
in scale, geographic coverage, and label confidence. We perform an extensive
evaluation featuring several models, such as Stochastic Segmentation Networks
and ensembles, in combination with a number of neural architectures and
uncertainty metrics. We make a number of practical recommendations based on our
findings.

TL;DR: 提出Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF)方法，通过对比性对象-背景融合和互补视频-帧融合机制，将多模态大语言模型的注意力图直接转换为分割掩码，无需训练即可实现视频推理分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解方面表现出色，但其原始注意力图存在噪声且与对象区域对齐不佳，需要一种无需训练的方法来精炼这些注意力图以实现视频分割。

Method: 1. 将视频推理分割视为视频问答任务，通过rollout机制提取注意力图；2. 提出DecAF方法，包含对比性对象-背景融合和互补视频-帧融合两个机制；3. 引入注意力引导的SAM2提示来获取细粒度掩码。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需重新训练MLLMs的有效解决方案，能够直接将注意力图转换为分割掩码，在视频分割任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong video
understanding by attending to visual tokens relevant to textual queries. To
directly adapt this for localization in a training-free manner, we cast video
reasoning segmentation as a video QA task and extract attention maps via
rollout mechanism. However, raw attention maps are noisy and poorly aligned
with object regions. We propose Decomposed Attention Fusion (DecAF), which
refines these maps through two mechanisms: (1) contrastive object-background
fusion and (2) complementary video-frame fusion. This method suppresses
irrelevant activations and enhances object-focused cues, enabling direct
conversion of attention maps into coarse segmentation masks. In addition, we
introduce attention-guided SAM2 prompting for obtaining fine-grained masks.
Unlike existing methods that jointly train MLLMs with SAM, our method operates
entirely without retraining. DecAF outperforms training-free methods and
achieves performance comparable to training-based methods on both referring and
reasoning VOS benchmarks. The code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出CBDiff模型，通过生成多个多样化的伪造定位图来增强图像伪造定位的可信度，采用伯努利噪声和时序交叉注意力机制提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成单一确定性定位图，缺乏精度和可靠性，无法满足法医分析和安全监控等高风险应用需求。

Method: 使用条件伯努利扩散模型(CBDiff)，引入伯努利噪声反映伪造掩码的二元稀疏特性，设计时序交叉注意力机制(TSCAttention)结合语义特征和时间步长。

Result: 在8个公开基准数据集上的实验表明，CBDiff显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CBDiff通过生成多个定位图有效处理伪造区域的不确定性，具有强大的实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Image Forgery Localization (IFL) is a crucial task in image forensics, aimed
at accurately identifying manipulated or tampered regions within an image at
the pixel level. Existing methods typically generate a single deterministic
localization map, which often lacks the precision and reliability required for
high-stakes applications such as forensic analysis and security surveillance.
To enhance the credibility of predictions and mitigate the risk of errors, we
introduce an advanced Conditional Bernoulli Diffusion Model (CBDiff). Given a
forged image, CBDiff generates multiple diverse and plausible localization
maps, thereby offering a richer and more comprehensive representation of the
forgery distribution. This approach addresses the uncertainty and variability
inherent in tampered regions. Furthermore, CBDiff innovatively incorporates
Bernoulli noise into the diffusion process to more faithfully reflect the
inherent binary and sparse properties of forgery masks. Additionally, CBDiff
introduces a Time-Step Cross-Attention (TSCAttention), which is specifically
designed to leverage semantic feature guidance with temporal steps to improve
manipulation detection. Extensive experiments on eight publicly benchmark
datasets demonstrate that CBDiff significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its strong potential for real-world
deployment.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在医学图像理解中表现出色，但其概念与视觉证据的对齐能力（定位能力）尚未充分探索。在医学领域，可靠的定位对于可解释性和临床采用至关重要。

Method: 使用七种CLIP风格的视觉语言模型变体，通过交叉注意力和相似性定位图生成视觉解释，并与放射科医生标注的病理区域进行定量对齐评估。

Result: 发现：（1）所有模型变体对大型明确病变定位合理，但对小型或弥散病变性能显著下降；（2）胸部X光特定数据集预训练的模型比通用领域训练的模型对齐效果更好；（3）模型识别能力与定位能力强相关。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型尽管识别能力强，但在临床可靠定位方面仍有不足，在医学实践中部署前需要有针对性的可解释性基准测试。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable zero-shot
performance in medical image understanding, yet their grounding ability, the
extent to which textual concepts align with visual evidence, remains
underexplored. In the medical domain, however, reliable grounding is essential
for interpretability and clinical adoption. In this work, we present the first
systematic benchmark for evaluating cross-modal interpretability in chest
X-rays across seven CLIP-style VLM variants. We generate visual explanations
using cross-attention and similarity-based localization maps, and
quantitatively assess their alignment with radiologist-annotated regions across
multiple pathologies. Our analysis reveals that: (1) while all VLM variants
demonstrate reasonable localization for large and well-defined pathologies,
their performance substantially degrades for small or diffuse lesions; (2)
models that are pretrained on chest X-ray-specific datasets exhibit improved
alignment compared to those trained on general-domain data. (3) The overall
recognition ability and grounding ability of the model are strongly correlated.
These findings underscore that current VLMs, despite their strong recognition
ability, still fall short in clinically reliable grounding, highlighting the
need for targeted interpretability benchmarks before deployment in medical
practice. XBench code is available at

### [136] [Beyond sparse denoising in frames: minimax estimation with a scattering transform](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19612)
*Nathanaël Cuvelle--Magar,Stéphane Mallat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于散射系数的去噪估计器，通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来抑制高斯噪声，该方法的数值实验表明对于所有Lipschitz指数α≤2的卡通图像都能达到极小极大渐近界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于帧的稀疏估计器（如小波、曲波等）无法充分适应复杂信号规律，特别是对于边缘为分段C^α曲线的卡通图像，当Lipschitz指数α≤2是未知参数时，这些方法都是次优的。深度卷积神经网络虽然取得了更好的数值结果，但需要更简化的模型。

Method: 引入散射系数作为简化的卷积神经网络模型，通过对小波系数模进行第二次小波变换计算散射系数。然后通过联合最小化和最大化不同散射系数子集的ℓ¹范数来构建去噪估计器。

Result: 数值实验表明，该去噪估计器对于所有Lipschitz指数α≤2的卡通图像都能达到极小极大渐近界。证明了这些ℓ¹范数能够捕捉不同类型的几何图像规律性。

Conclusion: 该方法为抑制信号噪声和指定函数几何规律性提供了不同的调和分析方法，并在调和分析与深度卷积网络去噪估计器之间建立了数学桥梁。

Abstract: A considerable amount of research in harmonic analysis has been devoted to
non-linear estimators of signals contaminated by additive Gaussian noise. They
are implemented by thresholding coefficients in a frame, which provide a sparse
signal representation, or by minimising their $\ell^1$ norm. However, sparse
estimators in frames are not sufficiently rich to adapt to complex signal
regularities. For cartoon images whose edges are piecewise $\bf C^\alpha$
curves, wavelet, curvelet and Xlet frames are suboptimal if the Lipschitz
exponent $\alpha \leq 2$ is an unknown parameter. Deep convolutional neural
networks have recently obtained much better numerical results, which reach the
minimax asymptotic bounds for all $\alpha$. Wavelet scattering coefficients
have been introduced as simplified convolutional neural network models. They
are computed by transforming the modulus of wavelet coefficients with a second
wavelet transform. We introduce a denoising estimator by jointly minimising and
maximising the $\ell^1$ norms of different subsets of scattering coefficients.
We prove that these $\ell^1$ norms capture different types of geometric image
regularity. Numerical experiments show that this denoising estimator reaches
the minimax asymptotic bound for cartoon images for all Lipschitz exponents
$\alpha \leq 2$. We state this numerical result as a mathematical conjecture.
It provides a different harmonic analysis approach to suppress noise from
signals, and to specify the geometric regularity of functions. It also opens a
mathematical bridge between harmonic analysis and denoising estimators with
deep convolutional network.

TL;DR: GenComm提出了一种生成式通信机制，通过特征生成实现异构多智能体系统的无缝感知，无需修改原始网络，且能低成本集成新智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构智能体协作中的领域差距问题，现有方法存在破坏语义一致性和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 使用可变形消息提取器提取空间信息，通过条件扩散模型生成与自我智能体语义空间对齐的特征，再通过通道增强器进行融合。

Result: 在OPV2V-H、DAIR-V2X和V2X-Real数据集上优于现有方法，集成新智能体时计算成本和参数数量减少81%。

Conclusion: GenComm为异构多智能体协作提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration enhances the perception capabilities of individual
agents through information sharing. However, in real-world applications,
differences in sensors and models across heterogeneous agents inevitably lead
to domain gaps during collaboration. Existing approaches based on adaptation
and reconstruction fail to support pragmatic heterogeneous collaboration due to
two key limitations: (1) Intrusive retraining of the encoder or core modules
disrupts the established semantic consistency among agents; and (2)
accommodating new agents incurs high computational costs, limiting scalability.
To address these challenges, we present a novel Generative Communication
mechanism (GenComm) that facilitates seamless perception across heterogeneous
multi-agent systems through feature generation, without altering the original
network, and employs lightweight numerical alignment of spatial information to
efficiently integrate new agents at minimal cost. Specifically, a tailored
Deformable Message Extractor is designed to extract spatial message for each
collaborator, which is then transmitted in place of intermediate features. The
Spatial-Aware Feature Generator, utilizing a conditional diffusion model,
generates features aligned with the ego agent's semantic space while preserving
the spatial information of the collaborators. These generated features are
further refined by a Channel Enhancer before fusion. Experiments conducted on
the OPV2V-H, DAIR-V2X and V2X-Real datasets demonstrate that GenComm
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an 81\% reduction in
both computational cost and parameter count when incorporating new agents. Our
code is available at https://github.com/jeffreychou777/GenComm.

TL;DR: 提出AMR框架解决现有时刻检索方法的三个瓶颈：数据稀缺、边界模糊和细粒度语义区分不足，通过零外部依赖的增强训练框架提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临数据稀缺导致浅层特征关联、相邻事件边界模糊、细粒度语义区分不足三个关键瓶颈，需要在不增加标注成本的情况下提升模型性能。

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：冷启动阶段使用课程学习在增强数据上建立基础边界/语义感知；蒸馏阶段引入原始查询和主动查询双查询集，通过跨阶段蒸馏损失保持知识一致性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，AMR相比现有最先进方法取得了性能提升。

Conclusion: AMR框架有效解决了时刻检索中的数据稀缺、边界模糊和语义区分问题，通过零外部依赖的增强方法显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Existing Moment Retrieval methods face three critical bottlenecks: (1) data
scarcity forces models into shallow keyword-feature associations; (2) boundary
ambiguity in transition regions between adjacent events; (3) insufficient
discrimination of fine-grained semantics (e.g., distinguishing ``kicking" vs.
``throwing" a ball). In this paper, we propose a zero-external-dependency
Augmented Moment Retrieval framework, AMR, designed to overcome local optima
caused by insufficient data annotations and the lack of robust boundary and
semantic discrimination capabilities. AMR is built upon two key insights: (1)
it resolves ambiguous boundary information and semantic confusion in existing
annotations without additional data (avoiding costly manual labeling), and (2)
it preserves boundary and semantic discriminative capabilities enhanced by
training while generalizing to real-world scenarios, significantly improving
performance. Furthermore, we propose a two-stage training framework with
cold-start and distillation adaptation. The cold-start stage employs curriculum
learning on augmented data to build foundational boundary/semantic awareness.
The distillation stage introduces dual query sets: Original Queries maintain
DETR-based localization using frozen Base Queries from the cold-start model,
while Active Queries dynamically adapt to real-data distributions. A
cross-stage distillation loss enforces consistency between Original and Base
Queries, preventing knowledge forgetting while enabling real-world
generalization. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that AMR achieves
improved performance over prior state-of-the-art approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在医学领域表现不佳，主要由于缺乏高质量医学影像数据集和忽视了从粗到细的诊断过程。

Method: 构建CT-RATE-VQA数据集(84K QA对)，提出MedReason-R1模型，嵌入放大病灶区域，采用GRPO强化学习框架。

Result: MedReason-R1在CT疾病诊断中达到最先进性能，同时保持泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过强调全局定位和病灶细节，有效提升了医学诊断性能，无需昂贵的人工标注。

Abstract: General-purpose large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong
capabilities in generating detailed descriptions for natural images. However,
their performance in the medical domain remains suboptimal, even for relatively
straightforward tasks, primarily due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
specialized medical imaging datasets and the neglect of the diagnostic process
that progresses from coarse to fine-grained. To address the first issue, we
construct the CT-RATE-VQA dataset, which has 84K QA pairs. For the second
issue, we propose MedReason-R1, a medical VLM with explicit reasoning process
for disease diagnosis. MedReason-R1 incorporates a novel strategy that embeds
zoom-in disease region-of-interest areas into the image, highlighting the
crucial role of both global localization and disease-specific details in
enhancing the model's diagnostic performance. Furthermore, we introduce the
GRPO reinforcement learning framework to MedReason-R1, which enables effective
reasoning without relying on costly manual annotations. Compared to recent
general-purpose and medical VLMs, MedReason-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance in CT disease diagnosis while retaining generalization. The code,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ReAct-GS通过重要性感知的致密化准则和参数扰动机制，解决了3D高斯泼溅中的过重建伪影问题，在复杂场景中实现了更好的新视图合成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅在复杂场景中会产生过重建伪影（局部模糊和针状扭曲），现有方法归因于大规模高斯函数分裂不足，但本文发现两个根本限制：致密化过程中的梯度幅度稀释和原始冻结现象。

Method: 提出ReAct-GS方法，包含：(1) 重要性感知致密化准则，整合多视角的α混合权重来重新激活复杂区域的停滞原始增长；(2) 重新激活机制，通过自适应参数扰动来激活冻结的原始函数。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据集上的综合实验表明，ReAct-GS有效消除了过重建伪影，在新视图合成标准指标上达到最先进性能，同时保留了精细的几何细节。

Conclusion: ReAct-GS的重新激活机制在与其他3D-GS变体（如Pixel-GS）集成时也带来了一致的改进，证明了其广泛的适用性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) achieves real-time photorealistic novel view
synthesis, yet struggles with complex scenes due to over-reconstruction
artifacts, manifesting as local blurring and needle-shape distortions. While
recent approaches attribute these issues to insufficient splitting of
large-scale Gaussians, we identify two fundamental limitations: gradient
magnitude dilution during densification and the primitive frozen phenomenon,
where essential Gaussian densification is inhibited in complex regions while
suboptimally scaled Gaussians become trapped in local optima. To address these
challenges, we introduce ReAct-GS, a method founded on the principle of
re-activation. Our approach features: (1) an importance-aware densification
criterion incorporating $\alpha$-blending weights from multiple viewpoints to
re-activate stalled primitive growth in complex regions, and (2) a
re-activation mechanism that revitalizes frozen primitives through adaptive
parameter perturbations. Comprehensive experiments across diverse real-world
datasets demonstrate that ReAct-GS effectively eliminates over-reconstruction
artifacts and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard novel view
synthesis metrics while preserving intricate geometric details. Additionally,
our re-activation mechanism yields consistent improvements when integrated with
other 3D-GS variants such as Pixel-GS, demonstrating its broad applicability.

Motivation: 现有驾驶世界模型主要用于世界仿真且与轨迹规划解耦，虽然近期有统一框架的尝试，但世界建模对规划的协同促进机制仍需深入探索。

Method: PWM通过协作状态-动作预测实现类人预期感知，采用动态增强并行token生成机制，配备上下文引导tokenizer和自适应动态焦点损失。

Result: 仅使用前视摄像头输入，PWM在性能上匹配或超越了依赖多视角和多模态输入的最先进方法。

Conclusion: PWM成功整合了世界建模与轨迹规划，通过动作无关的未来状态预测有效利用世界知识提升规划可靠性，展示了统一框架的优越性。

Abstract: Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet their visual processing is opaque. Most black-box
evaluations measure task accuracy, but reveal little about underlying
mechanisms. Drawing on cognitive psychology, we adapt classic visual search
paradigms -- originally developed to study human perception -- to test whether
MLLMs exhibit the ``pop-out'' effect, where salient visual features are
detected independently of distractor set size. Using controlled experiments
targeting colour, size and lighting features, we find that advanced MLLMs
exhibit human-like pop-out effects in colour or size-based disjunctive (single
feature) search, as well as capacity limits for conjunctive (multiple feature)
search. We also find evidence to suggest that MLLMs, like humans, incorporate
natural scene priors such as lighting direction into object representations. We
reinforce our findings using targeted fine-tuning and mechanistic
interpretability analyses. Our work shows how visual search can serve as a
cognitively grounded diagnostic tool for evaluating perceptual capabilities in
MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无配对图像翻译方法在医学成像中会扭曲细曲线结构（如微血管），影响诊断可靠性和定量分析，这在眼科和血管成像中尤为重要。

Method: CST通过添加曲线提取模块提供拓扑监督，增强基线模型的结构一致性，可集成到CycleGAN和UNSB等现有方法中。

Result: 在光学相干断层扫描血管造影、彩色眼底和X射线冠状动脉造影三种成像模态上的综合评估显示，CST提高了翻译保真度并达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: CST通过加强学习映射中的几何完整性，为医学成像中的曲线结构感知跨域翻译建立了原则性途径。

Abstract: Unpaired image-to-image translation has emerged as a crucial technique in
medical imaging, enabling cross-modality synthesis, domain adaptation, and data
augmentation without costly paired datasets. Yet, existing approaches often
distort fine curvilinear structures, such as microvasculature, undermining both
diagnostic reliability and quantitative analysis. This limitation is
consequential in ophthalmic and vascular imaging, where subtle morphological
changes carry significant clinical meaning. We propose Curvilinear
Structure-preserving Translation (CST), a general framework that explicitly
preserves fine curvilinear structures during unpaired translation by
integrating structure consistency into the training. Specifically, CST augments
baseline models with a curvilinear extraction module for topological
supervision. It can be seamlessly incorporated into existing methods. We
integrate it into CycleGAN and UNSB as two representative backbones.
Comprehensive evaluation across three imaging modalities: optical coherence
tomography angiography, color fundus and X-ray coronary angiography
demonstrates that CST improves translation fidelity and achieves
state-of-the-art performance. By reinforcing geometric integrity in learned
mappings, CST establishes a principled pathway toward curvilinear
structure-aware cross-domain translation in medical imaging.

Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的呈现攻击检测系统大多作为黑盒运行，决策过程不透明，需要解释性技术来理解系统行为，特别是视觉解释对于确定生物特征图像被判定为真实或伪造的关键区域至关重要。

Conclusion: Ensemble-CAM技术能够增强基于深度学习的面部呈现攻击检测系统的透明度和可信度，为用户提供更好的系统行为理解。

Abstract: Presentation attacks represent a critical security threat where adversaries
use fake biometric data, such as face, fingerprint, or iris images, to gain
unauthorized access to protected systems. Various presentation attack detection
(PAD) systems have been designed leveraging deep learning (DL) models to
mitigate this type of threat. Despite their effectiveness, most of the DL
models function as black boxes - their decisions are opaque to their users. The
purpose of explainability techniques is to provide detailed information about
the reason behind the behavior or decision of DL models. In particular, visual
explanation is necessary to better understand the decisions or predictions of
DL-based PAD systems and determine the key regions due to which a biometric
image is considered real or fake by the system. In this work, a novel
technique, Ensemble-CAM, is proposed for providing visual explanations for the
decisions made by deep learning-based face PAD systems. Our goal is to improve
DL-based face PAD systems by providing a better understanding of their
behavior. Our provided visual explanations will enhance the transparency and
trustworthiness of DL-based face PAD systems.

<details>

Motivation: 从高维视频中提取真实动态变量面临挑战，因为存在背景运动、遮挡和纹理变化等干扰因素。需要开发能够学习鲁棒且稳定潜在表示的方法。

Method: 第一阶段使用时基变换器自编码器，通过全局注意力关注动态相关区域；第二阶段通过线性相关分析选择物理意义维度，并用李雅普诺夫稳定性正则化器精炼转移动态。

Result: 在5个合成基准和4个真实世界动态系统上的实验表明，LyTimeT在互信息和内在维度估计上最接近真实值，对背景扰动保持不变性，在CNN和变换器基线中达到最低分析均方误差。

Conclusion: 结合时空注意力与稳定性约束可以产生既准确又物理可解释的预测模型。

Abstract: Extracting the true dynamical variables of a system from high-dimensional
video is challenging due to distracting visual factors such as background
motion, occlusions, and texture changes. We propose LyTimeT, a two-phase
framework for interpretable variable extraction that learns robust and stable
latent representations of dynamical systems. In Phase 1, LyTimeT employs a
spatio-temporal TimeSformer-based autoencoder that uses global attention to
focus on dynamically relevant regions while suppressing nuisance variation,
enabling distraction-robust latent state learning and accurate long-horizon
video prediction. In Phase 2, we probe the learned latent space, select the
most physically meaningful dimensions using linear correlation analysis, and
refine the transition dynamics with a Lyapunov-based stability regularizer to
enforce contraction and reduce error accumulation during roll-outs. Experiments
on five synthetic benchmarks and four real-world dynamical systems, including
chaotic phenomena, show that LyTimeT achieves mutual information and intrinsic
dimension estimates closest to ground truth, remains invariant under background
perturbations, and delivers the lowest analytical mean squared error among
CNN-based (TIDE) and transformer-only baselines. Our results demonstrate that
combining spatio-temporal attention with stability constraints yields
predictive models that are not only accurate but also physically interpretable.

Conclusion: ADQ框架通过自适应权重量化方案有效解决了量化中的分布不均和码本不匹配问题，在低比特量化下实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) is a critical technique for deploying deep
neural networks on resource-constrained devices. However, existing methods
often face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of
activations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.
To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware
Quantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a
differentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight
quantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based
initialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the
initial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based
on Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;
and (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation. For
activations, we integrate a hardware-friendly non-uniform-to-uniform mapping
scheme. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method. On
ImageNet, ADQ enables a ResNet-18 to achieve 71.512% Top-1 accuracy with an
average bit-width of only 2.81 bits, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
under comparable conditions. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies on CIFAR-10
systematically demonstrate the individual contributions of each innovative
component, validating the rationale and effectiveness of our design.

Abstract: This paper introduces OmniMotion-X, a versatile multimodal framework for
whole-body human motion generation, leveraging an autoregressive diffusion
transformer in a unified sequence-to-sequence manner. OmniMotion-X efficiently
supports diverse multimodal tasks, including text-to-motion, music-to-dance,
speech-to-gesture, and global spatial-temporal control scenarios (e.g., motion
prediction, in-betweening, completion, and joint/trajectory-guided synthesis),
as well as flexible combinations of these tasks. Specifically, we propose the
use of reference motion as a novel conditioning signal, substantially enhancing
the consistency of generated content, style, and temporal dynamics crucial for
realistic animations. To handle multimodal conflicts, we introduce a
progressive weak-to-strong mixed-condition training strategy. To enable
high-quality multimodal training, we construct OmniMoCap-X, the largest unified
multimodal motion dataset to date, integrating 28 publicly available MoCap
sources across 10 distinct tasks, standardized to the SMPL-X format at 30 fps.
To ensure detailed and consistent annotations, we render sequences into videos
and use GPT-4o to automatically generate structured and hierarchical captions,
capturing both low-level actions and high-level semantics. Extensive
experimental evaluations confirm that OmniMotion-X significantly surpasses
existing methods, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across multiple
multimodal tasks and enabling the interactive generation of realistic,
coherent, and controllable long-duration motions.

Conclusion: CPL-NC通过解决原型退化和类别混淆问题，有效提升了视觉语言模型在分布偏移下的零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate impressive zero-shot generalization
through large-scale image-text pretraining, yet their performance can drop once
the deployment distribution diverges from the training distribution. To address
this, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods update models using unlabeled target
data. However, existing approaches often ignore two key challenges: prototype
degradation in long-tailed distributions and confusion between semantically
similar classes. To tackle these issues, we propose \textbf{C}lass-Aware
\textbf{P}rototype \textbf{L}earning with \textbf{N}egative
\textbf{C}ontrast(\textbf{CPL-NC}), a lightweight TTA framework designed
specifically for VLMs to enhance generalization under distribution shifts.
CPL-NC introduces a \textit{Class-Aware Prototype Cache} Module that
dynamically adjusts per-class capacity based on test-time frequency and
activation history, with a rejuvenation mechanism for inactive classes to
retain rare-category knowledge. Additionally, a \textit{Negative Contrastive
Learning} Mechanism identifies and constrains hard visual-textual negatives to
improve class separability. The framework employs asymmetric optimization,
refining only textual prototypes while anchoring on stable visual features.
Experiments on 15 benchmarks show that CPL-NC consistently outperforms prior
TTA methods across both ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 backbones.

TL;DR: Pico-Banana-400K是一个包含40万张图像的大规模指令图像编辑数据集，通过系统化方法确保质量和多样性，支持单轮和多轮编辑研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态模型在文本引导图像编辑方面取得显著进展，但研究社区缺乏大规模、高质量、开放可用的真实图像数据集。

Method: 利用Nano-Banana从OpenImages真实照片生成多样化编辑对，采用细粒度图像编辑分类法确保全面覆盖，通过MLLM质量评分和精心策划保持内容保真度和指令忠实度。

Result: 构建了包含三个专业子集的综合数据集：7.2万示例的多轮编辑集合、5.6万示例的偏好子集，以及长短编辑指令配对集合。

Conclusion: Pico-Banana-400K为训练和基准测试下一代文本引导图像编辑模型提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated remarkable text-guided
image editing capabilities, with systems like GPT-4o and Nano-Banana setting
new benchmarks. However, the research community's progress remains constrained
by the absence of large-scale, high-quality, and openly accessible datasets
built from real images. We introduce Pico-Banana-400K, a comprehensive
400K-image dataset for instruction-based image editing. Our dataset is
constructed by leveraging Nano-Banana to generate diverse edit pairs from real
photographs in the OpenImages collection. What distinguishes Pico-Banana-400K
from previous synthetic datasets is our systematic approach to quality and
diversity. We employ a fine-grained image editing taxonomy to ensure
comprehensive coverage of edit types while maintaining precise content
preservation and instruction faithfulness through MLLM-based quality scoring
and careful curation. Beyond single turn editing, Pico-Banana-400K enables
research into complex editing scenarios. The dataset includes three specialized
subsets: (1) a 72K-example multi-turn collection for studying sequential
editing, reasoning, and planning across consecutive modifications; (2) a
56K-example preference subset for alignment research and reward model training;
and (3) paired long-short editing instructions for developing instruction
rewriting and summarization capabilities. By providing this large-scale,
high-quality, and task-rich resource, Pico-Banana-400K establishes a robust
foundation for training and benchmarking the next generation of text-guided
image editing models.

### [150] [How to Evaluate Monocular Depth Estimation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19814)
*Siyang Wu,Jack Nugent,Willow Yang,Jia Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了单目深度估计的评估指标问题，发现现有指标对曲率扰动不敏感，提出了基于相对表面法线的新指标和改进的可视化工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目深度估计研究进展迅速，但缺乏标准化的评估方法，现有指标的选择和权衡行为未被充分理解，需要与人类判断对齐的评估体系。

Method: 对现有指标进行定量分析，测试其对各种地面真值扰动的敏感性，并与人类判断进行比较；提出基于相对表面法线的新指标、新的深度可视化工具和创建复合指标的原理方法。

Result: 分析显示现有指标对曲率扰动严重不敏感（如使平面变波浪形）；新提出的相对表面法线指标能更好地与人类判断对齐。

Conclusion: 需要改进深度估计评估指标，特别是对曲率变化的敏感性；提出的新指标和工具能提供更符合人类感知的评估标准。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation is an important task with rapid progress, but how
to evaluate it remains an open question, as evidenced by a lack of
standardization in existing literature and a large selection of evaluation
metrics whose trade-offs and behaviors are not well understood. This paper
contributes a novel, quantitative analysis of existing metrics in terms of
their sensitivity to various types of perturbations of ground truth,
emphasizing comparison to human judgment. Our analysis reveals that existing
metrics are severely under-sensitive to curvature perturbation such as making
flat surfaces wavy. To remedy this, we introduce a new metric based on relative
surface normals, along with new depth visualization tools and a principled
method to create composite metrics with better human alignment. Code and data
are available at: https://github.com/princeton-vl/evalmde.

TL;DR: ITTO是一个新的点跟踪基准测试套件，基于真实世界视频构建，包含高质量人工标注，旨在评估点跟踪方法在真实场景中的能力与局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏真实世界场景的运动复杂性、遮挡模式和物体多样性，无法充分评估点跟踪方法的实际性能。

Method: 从现有数据集和第一人称真实世界录像中收集视频，通过多阶段流水线收集高质量人工标注，构建包含真实世界动态特征的基准测试。

Result: 对最先进的跟踪方法进行严格分析发现，现有跟踪器在这些挑战面前表现不佳，特别是在遮挡后重新识别点方面存在严重问题。

Conclusion: ITTO作为基础测试平台，指出了需要开发针对真实世界动态的新建模方法，以推动更鲁棒的跟踪算法发展。

Abstract: We introduce ITTO, a challenging new benchmark suite for evaluating and
diagnosing the capabilities and limitations of point tracking methods. Our
videos are sourced from existing datasets and egocentric real-world recordings,
with high-quality human annotations collected through a multi-stage pipeline.
ITTO captures the motion complexity, occlusion patterns, and object diversity
characteristic of real-world scenes -- factors that are largely absent in
current benchmarks. We conduct a rigorous analysis of state-of-the-art tracking
methods on ITTO, breaking down performance along key axes of motion complexity.
Our findings reveal that existing trackers struggle with these challenges,
particularly in re-identifying points after occlusion, highlighting critical
failure modes. These results point to the need for new modeling approaches
tailored to real-world dynamics. We envision ITTO as a foundation testbed for
advancing point tracking and guiding the development of more robust tracking
algorithms.

TL;DR: AutoPage是一个多智能体系统，通过分层协作流程将学术论文自动转换为交互式项目网页，解决了传统手动创建网页的繁琐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员在创建项目网页时面临手动、重复性的工作负担，而现有的自动化工具无法处理网页的动态交互特性，需要一种新的解决方案。

Method: 采用分层协作的多智能体系统，包含叙事规划、多模态内容生成和交互式渲染的粗到细流程，并引入检查器智能体验证内容准确性，支持人工检查点。

Result: AutoPage能在15分钟内以低于0.1美元的成本生成高质量、视觉吸引力强的网页，并构建了首个此类任务的基准测试PageBench。

Conclusion: AutoPage不仅是一个工具，更是一个强大的协作助手，成功解决了论文到网页转换的自动化挑战，显著提高了研究传播效率。

Abstract: In the quest for scientific progress, communicating research is as vital as
the discovery itself. Yet, researchers are often sidetracked by the manual,
repetitive chore of building project webpages to make their dense papers
accessible. While automation has tackled static slides and posters, the
dynamic, interactive nature of webpages has remained an unaddressed challenge.
To bridge this gap, we reframe the problem, arguing that the solution lies not
in a single command, but in a collaborative, hierarchical process. We introduce
$\textbf{AutoPage}$, a novel multi-agent system that embodies this philosophy.
AutoPage deconstructs paper-to-page creation into a coarse-to-fine pipeline
from narrative planning to multimodal content generation and interactive
rendering. To combat AI hallucination, dedicated "Checker" agents verify each
step against the source paper, while optional human checkpoints ensure the
final product aligns perfectly with the author's vision, transforming the
system from a mere tool into a powerful collaborative assistant. To rigorously
validate our approach, we also construct $\textbf{PageBench}$, the first
benchmark for this new task. Experiments show AutoPage not only generates
high-quality, visually appealing pages but does so with remarkable efficiency
in under 15 minutes for less than \$0.1. Code and dataset will be released at
$\href{https://mqleet.github.io/AutoPage_ProjectPage/}{Webpage}$.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出∇-SDF方法，结合梯度增强八叉树插值的显式先验和隐式神经残差，实现非截断SDF重建，在计算效率和精度上均优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：基于离散体积数据结构的方法影响SDF估计的连续性和可微性；神经网络方法虽然精度高但效率低、存在灾难性遗忘和内存限制问题，且通常限于截断SDF

Method: 混合方法：使用梯度增强八叉树插值获得显式先验，结合隐式神经残差，实现非截断欧几里得SDF重建

Result: 在计算和内存效率上与体积方法相当，在可微性和精度上与神经网络方法相当，在准确性和效率方面优于现有技术

Conclusion: ∇-SDF为机器人和计算机视觉中的下游任务提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Estimation of signed distance functions (SDFs) from point cloud data has been
shown to benefit many robot autonomy capabilities, including localization,
mapping, motion planning, and control. Methods that support online and
large-scale SDF reconstruction tend to rely on discrete volumetric data
structures, which affect the continuity and differentiability of the SDF
estimates. Recently, using implicit features, neural network methods have
demonstrated high-fidelity and differentiable SDF reconstruction but they tend
to be less efficient, can experience catastrophic forgetting and memory
limitations in large environments, and are often restricted to truncated SDFs.
This work proposes $\nabla$-SDF, a hybrid method that combines an explicit
prior obtained from gradient-augmented octree interpolation with an implicit
neural residual. Our method achieves non-truncated (Euclidean) SDF
reconstruction with computational and memory efficiency comparable to
volumetric methods and differentiability and accuracy comparable to neural
network methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \methodname{}
outperforms the state of the art in terms of accuracy and efficiency, providing
a scalable solution for downstream tasks in robotics and computer vision.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GRASPLAT是一个新颖的抓取框架，利用3D高斯泼溅技术从RGB图像生成高质量的手-物体交互视图，通过端到端训练实现多指灵巧抓取，无需完整3D扫描。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖完整3D扫描来预测抓取姿态，但在真实场景中获取高质量3D数据困难，限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用3D高斯泼溅合成手抓取物体的物理合理图像，回归对应手部关节；引入光度损失最小化渲染图像与真实图像的差异。

Result: 在合成和真实抓取数据集上的实验表明，GRASPLAT比现有基于图像的方法抓取成功率提升高达36.9%。

Conclusion: GRASPLAT证明了仅使用RGB图像就能实现有效的灵巧抓取，为机器人抓取提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Achieving dexterous robotic grasping with multi-fingered hands remains a
significant challenge. While existing methods rely on complete 3D scans to
predict grasp poses, these approaches face limitations due to the difficulty of
acquiring high-quality 3D data in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we
introduce GRASPLAT, a novel grasping framework that leverages consistent 3D
information while being trained solely on RGB images. Our key insight is that
by synthesizing physically plausible images of a hand grasping an object, we
can regress the corresponding hand joints for a successful grasp. To achieve
this, we utilize 3D Gaussian Splatting to generate high-fidelity novel views of
real hand-object interactions, enabling end-to-end training with RGB data.
Unlike prior methods, our approach incorporates a photometric loss that refines
grasp predictions by minimizing discrepancies between rendered and real images.
We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world grasping
datasets, demonstrating that GRASPLAT improves grasp success rates up to 36.9%
over existing image-based methods. Project page:

TL;DR: GigaBrain-0是一个基于世界模型生成数据的视觉-语言-动作基础模型，通过生成多样化数据减少对真实机器人数据的依赖，提升跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLA模型需要大规模真实机器人数据，收集成本高且效率低，限制了模型的扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 利用世界模型生成多样化数据（视频生成、真实到真实转换、人类转换、视角转换、仿真到真实转换），结合RGBD输入建模和具身思维链监督，增强空间几何推理和长时程依赖处理能力。

Result: 在灵巧操作、长时程任务和移动操作任务上实现显著性能提升，在外观、物体位置和相机视角变化下表现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GigaBrain-0通过世界模型生成数据有效解决了真实数据收集的瓶颈问题，同时开发了轻量级版本GigaBrain-0-Small用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Training Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for generalist robots typically
requires large-scale real-world robot data, which is expensive and
time-consuming to collect. The inefficiency of physical data collection
severely limits the scalability, and generalization capacity of current VLA
systems. To address this challenge, we introduce GigaBrain-0, a novel VLA
foundation model empowered by world model-generated data (e.g., video
generation, real2real transfer, human transfer, view transfer, sim2real
transfer data). By leveraging world models to generate diverse data at scale,
GigaBrain-0 significantly reduces reliance on real robot data while improving
cross-task generalization. Our approach further improves policy robustness
through RGBD input modeling and embodied Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision,
enabling the model to reason about spatial geometry, object states, and
long-horizon dependencies during task execution. This leads to substantial
gains in real-world performance on dexterous, long-horizon, and mobile
manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GigaBrain-0 achieves
superior generalization across variations in appearances (e.g., textures,
colors), object placements, and camera viewpoints. Additionally, we present
GigaBrain-0-Small, an optimized lightweight variant designed to run efficiently
on devices such as the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin.

TL;DR: 本文对苹果MLX框架在Apple Silicon设备上的性能进行了评估，重点关注transformer模型的推理延迟，并与PyTorch在NVIDIA GPU上的性能进行对比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型和机器学习的广泛应用，研究如何在笔记本电脑和移动设备等小型设备上部署这些模型变得日益重要，这需要能够充分利用设备硬件的框架。

Method: 创建了MLX-transformers框架，包含MLX中的不同transformer实现，将PyTorch模型检查点转换为MLX格式，在两种Apple Silicon MacBook设备上对BERT、RoBERTa和XLM-RoBERTa模型进行基准测试。

Result: 研究结果突显了MLX在苹果生态系统内实现高效且更易访问的端侧机器学习应用的潜力。

Conclusion: MLX框架能够充分利用Apple Silicon的先进架构，为在苹果设备上进行机器学习研究和应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The recent widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine
learning in general has sparked research interest in exploring the
possibilities of deploying these models on smaller devices such as laptops and
mobile phones. This creates a need for frameworks and approaches that are
capable of taking advantage of on-device hardware. The MLX framework was
created to address this need. It is a framework optimized for machine learning
(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,
experimentation, and prototyping.
  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference
latency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different
transformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch
counterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers
which includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the
model checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging
the advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers
enables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging
Face, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when
porting models between frameworks.
  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon
macbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the
inference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and
checkpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa
models, with the intention of extending future work to include models of
different modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's
capabilities. The results highlight MLX's potential in enabling efficient and
more accessible on-device ML applications within Apple's ecosystem.

TL;DR: 本文提出了BAPO方法，通过动态调整裁剪边界来解决离线强化学习中策略熵下降和优化不稳定的问题，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在大语言模型对齐中应用广泛，但在离线设置中使用历史数据训练时，策略熵急剧下降，优化不稳定甚至崩溃，需要解决这些问题来提高样本效率。

Method: 提出BAPO方法，基于理论分析发现PPO类目标中的固定裁剪机制会系统性阻止熵增加的更新，因此动态调整裁剪边界来重新平衡正负贡献，保持熵并稳定优化。

Result: 在AIME 2024和2025基准测试中，7B BAPO模型超越开源对手SkyWork-OR1-7B，32B BAPO模型在同规模模型中达到最先进水平，甚至超过o3-mini和Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking等专有系统。

Conclusion: BAPO通过自适应裁剪机制有效解决了离线强化学习中的优化不平衡问题，实现了快速、稳定且数据高效的训练，在多个场景下都表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for
aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in
off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for
training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy
declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.
Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)
an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the
policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;
and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping
mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing
updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of
exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that
dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and
negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across
diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO
achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025
benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as
SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art
results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary
systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MetaCluster是一个压缩Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KANs）参数的框架，通过元学习器将系数向量映射到低维流形，然后使用K-means聚类和共享质心替换每个边的向量，实现高达80倍的参数存储减少且不损失准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs用每边的基系数向量替代标量权重，虽然提高了表达能力和准确率，但导致参数和内存呈乘性增长。需要一种方法在不牺牲准确率的情况下高度压缩KANs。

Method: 使用轻量级元学习器将低维嵌入映射到系数向量，使其位于可聚类的低维流形上；然后运行K-means聚类，用共享质心替换每边向量；最后微调质心码本恢复准确率损失。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，对标准KANs和ConvKANs使用多种基函数，MetaCluster实现了高达80倍的参数存储减少，且没有准确率损失。

Conclusion: MetaCluster框架成功利用了KAN参数的向量特性，通过聚类和共享质心实现了高效的参数压缩，仅需存储小型码本和每边索引，为KANs的实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) replace scalar weights with per-edge
vectors of basis coefficients, thereby boosting expressivity and accuracy but
at the same time resulting in a multiplicative increase in parameters and
memory. We propose MetaCluster, a framework that makes KANs highly compressible
without sacrificing accuracy. Specifically, a lightweight meta-learner, trained
jointly with the KAN, is used to map low-dimensional embedding to coefficient
vectors, shaping them to lie on a low-dimensional manifold that is amenable to
clustering. We then run K-means in coefficient space and replace per-edge
vectors with shared centroids. Afterwards, the meta-learner can be discarded,
and a brief fine-tuning of the centroid codebook recovers any residual accuracy
loss. The resulting model stores only a small codebook and per-edge indices,
exploiting the vector nature of KAN parameters to amortize storage across
multiple coefficients. On MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, across standard KANs
and ConvKANs using multiple basis functions, MetaCluster achieves a reduction
of up to 80$\times$ in parameter storage, with no loss in accuracy. Code will
be released upon publication.

TL;DR: NeuroAda是一种新颖的参数高效微调方法，通过识别重要参数并引入旁路连接，在保持高内存效率的同时实现细粒度模型微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法存在权衡：基于添加的方法（如LoRA）内存效率高但表示能力有限，而选择性适应方法能精确适应但内存消耗大。NeuroAda旨在平衡这一权衡。

Method: 首先识别网络中的重要参数，然后为这些选定参数引入旁路连接。微调时仅更新旁路连接，保持原始模型参数冻结。

Result: 在23+个自然语言生成和理解任务上的实验表明，NeuroAda仅需≤0.02%的可训练参数即可达到最先进性能，同时将CUDA内存使用降低高达60%。

Conclusion: NeuroAda成功解决了PEFT方法在内存效率和细粒度适应能力之间的权衡问题，提供了一种高效且有效的微调解决方案。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily fall into
two categories: addition-based and selective in-situ adaptation. The former,
such as LoRA, introduce additional modules to adapt the model to downstream
tasks, offering strong memory efficiency. However, their representational
capacity is often limited, making them less suitable for fine-grained
adaptation. In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen
subset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and
effective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory
consumption. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose NeuroAda, a novel PEFT
method that enables fine-grained model finetuning while maintaining high memory
efficiency. Our approach first identifies important parameters (i.e.,
connections within the network) as in selective adaptation, and then introduces
bypass connections for these selected parameters. During finetuning, only the
bypass connections are updated, leaving the original model parameters frozen.
Empirical results on 23+ tasks spanning both natural language generation and
understanding demonstrate that NeuroAda achieves state-of-the-art performance
with as little as $\leq \textbf{0.02}\%$ trainable parameters, while reducing
CUDA memory usage by up to 60%. We release our code here:

Motivation: 传统物种监测方法覆盖范围有限，物种分布模型(SDM)虽能预测物种分布但精度不足。本研究旨在利用深度学习技术改进SDM在数据稀疏或不完整情况下的预测能力，为生物多样性监测提供更精确和可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 采用深度学习结合数据插补技术，进行数据平衡和特征选择，识别关键环境因素。构建多模态集成模型，整合土地覆盖、NDVI和其他环境输入数据，融合图像和表格数据。

Result: 数据平衡使青蛙计数任务的MAE从189降至29。多模态集成模型在未见区域表现出强大的泛化能力，青蛙栖息地分类准确率达84.9%，AUC为0.90，优于单个模型。

Conclusion: 多模态学习和数据预处理技术（如平衡和插补）能够显著提高生态预测模型的准确性，特别是在数据稀疏或不完整的情况下，为更精确和可扩展的生物多样性监测做出贡献。

Abstract: Monitoring species distribution is vital for conservation efforts, enabling
the assessment of environmental impacts and the development of effective
preservation strategies. Traditional data collection methods, including citizen
science, offer valuable insights but remain limited in coverage and
completeness. Species Distribution Modelling (SDM) helps address these gaps by
using occurrence data and environmental variables to predict species presence
across large regions. In this study, we enhance SDM accuracy for frogs (Anura)
by applying deep learning and data imputation techniques using data from the
"EY - 2022 Biodiversity Challenge." Our experiments show that data balancing
significantly improved model performance, reducing the Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) from 189 to 29 in frog counting tasks. Feature selection identified key
environmental factors influencing occurrence, optimizing inputs while
maintaining predictive accuracy. The multimodal ensemble model, integrating
land cover, NDVI, and other environmental inputs, outperformed individual
models and showed robust generalization across unseen regions. The fusion of
image and tabular data improved both frog counting and habitat classification,
achieving 84.9% accuracy with an AUC of 0.90. This study highlights the
potential of multimodal learning and data preprocessing techniques such as
balancing and imputation to improve predictive ecological modeling when data
are sparse or incomplete, contributing to more precise and scalable
biodiversity monitoring.

TL;DR: Ring-linear模型系列（包括Ring-mini-linear-2.0和Ring-flash-linear-2.0）采用混合注意力架构，显著降低了长上下文推理的I/O和计算开销，推理成本相比32B密集模型降低到1/10，相比原Ring系列降低50%以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文推理场景中的高I/O和计算开销问题，通过混合注意力架构优化推理效率。

Method: 采用线性注意力和softmax注意力的混合架构，系统探索不同注意力机制的比例，并使用自研的高性能FP8算子库linghe提升训练效率。

Result: Ring-mini-linear-2.0：16B参数，957M激活；Ring-flash-linear-2.0：104B参数，6.1B激活。推理成本大幅降低，训练效率提升50%，在多个复杂推理基准上保持SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Ring-linear模型系列通过混合注意力架构和高效算子库，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了推理和训练成本，为长上下文推理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this technical report, we present the Ring-linear model series,
specifically including Ring-mini-linear-2.0 and Ring-flash-linear-2.0.
Ring-mini-linear-2.0 comprises 16B parameters and 957M activations, while
Ring-flash-linear-2.0 contains 104B parameters and 6.1B activations. Both
models adopt a hybrid architecture that effectively integrates linear attention
and softmax attention, significantly reducing I/O and computational overhead in
long-context inference scenarios. Compared to a 32 billion parameter dense
model, this series reduces inference cost to 1/10, and compared to the original
Ring series, the cost is also reduced by over 50%. Furthermore, through
systematic exploration of the ratio between different attention mechanisms in
the hybrid architecture, we have identified the currently optimal model
structure. Additionally, by leveraging our self-developed high-performance FP8
operator library-linghe, overall training efficiency has been improved by 50%.
Benefiting from the high alignment between the training and inference engine
operators, the models can undergo long-term, stable, and highly efficient
optimization during the reinforcement learning phase, consistently maintaining
SOTA performance across multiple challenging complex reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的语言模型遗忘方法，通过联合抑制目标响应和模型信念来有效对抗遗忘过程中的挤压效应，实现更彻底的遗忘同时保持模型效用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘方法依赖梯度上升来降低特定目标响应的概率，但会导致概率质量重新分布到高似然区域（挤压效应），造成虚假遗忘，而自动评估指标往往误报实际成功。

Method: 提出引导框架（BS），将挤压效应与模型自身高置信度生成（模型信念）关联，通过联合抑制目标响应和模型信念来直接对抗挤压效应。BS-T抑制高概率token，BS-S移除整个高置信度生成。

Result: 在多样化基准测试和各种模型家族上的广泛实验证实了该方法的有效性，能够实现更彻底的遗忘同时保持模型效用。

Conclusion: 通过将模型信念纳入遗忘目标，该方法能够直接对抗挤压效应，实现更真实有效的遗忘，解决了现有方法中虚假遗忘的问题。

Abstract: Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become a cornerstone of modern generative AI for their
exceptional generation quality and controllability. However, their inherent
\textit{multi-step iterations} and \textit{complex backbone networks} lead to
prohibitive computational overhead and generation latency, forming a major
bottleneck for real-time applications. Although existing acceleration
techniques have made progress, they still face challenges such as limited
applicability, high training costs, or quality degradation.
  Against this backdrop, \textbf{Diffusion Caching} offers a promising
training-free, architecture-agnostic, and efficient inference paradigm. Its
core mechanism identifies and reuses intrinsic computational redundancies in
the diffusion process. By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and
inter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model
parameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and
evolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its
classification and analysis.
  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that
Diffusion Caching evolves from \textit{static reuse} to \textit{dynamic
prediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and
enables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling
optimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient
inference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We
argue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient
generative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of
\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GaLLoP是一种基于梯度的稀疏微调技术，通过选择梯度幅度大但预训练幅度小的参数进行微调，在保持预训练知识的同时提高任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏微调技术的有效性依赖于最优选择要微调的模型参数，现有方法在参数选择上仍有改进空间。

Method: GaLLoP选择在下游任务上梯度幅度最大、预训练幅度最小的参数进行微调，优先考虑任务相关性强但对预训练知识破坏小的参数。

Result: 在LLaMA3 8B和Gemma 2B上的实验表明，GaLLoP在分布内和分布外性能上均优于或匹配LoRA、DoRA、SAFT等主流参数高效微调技术。

Conclusion: GaLLoP能有效缓解灾难性遗忘和任务数据记忆问题，保持重要预训练参数不变，性能稳定且在不同随机种子下鲁棒泛化。

Abstract: Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a
sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse
adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be
fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique
named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which
fine-tunes only those model parameters which have the largest gradient
magnitudes on downstream tasks and the smallest pre-trained magnitudes,
intuitively prioritizing parameters that are highly task-relevant, but
minimally disruptive to pre-trained knowledge. Our experimentation with LLaMA3
8B and Gemma 2B as base models shows that GaLLoP consistently improves or
matches the in-distribution as well as out-of-distribution performance obtained
via the usage of other leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques,
including LoRA, DoRA, and SAFT. Our analysis demonstrates that GaLLoP mitigates
catastrophic forgetting and memorization of task data, as important pre-trained
parameters remain unchanged, and stabilizes performance relative to other
fine-tuning techniques, robustly generalizing across most random seeds.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种检测语言模型衍生使用的方法，通过测试Bob的模型或文本是否与Alice训练数据顺序相关来证明模型使用关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决如何证明Bob使用了Alice的开源模型的问题，即使Bob使用的是黑盒衍生模型。

Method: 将问题建模为独立性测试，利用训练数据顺序相关性作为统计证据。在查询设置中通过提示估计模型对训练数据的似然度；在观察设置中使用文本重叠度和重新训练模型的方法。

Result: 查询设置中在大多数情况下获得p值≤1e-8；观察设置中第二种方法仅需几百个token就能可靠区分，第一种方法需要数十万token。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效检测语言模型的衍生使用，为模型溯源提供了可行的统计证据。

Abstract: Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox
derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using
her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from
the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an
independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model
or text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it
through the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are
more likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob
is using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between
Bob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training
run. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant
correlation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the
null hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the
query setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model
gives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of
over 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to
12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value
on the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational
setting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's
text overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood
of Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by
repeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data. The
second approach can reliably distinguish Bob's text from as little as a few
hundred tokens; the first does not involve any retraining but requires many
more tokens (several hundred thousand) to achieve high power.

### [167] [StutterZero and StutterFormer: End-to-End Speech Conversion for Stuttering Transcription and Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18938)
*Qianheng Xu*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 该研究提出了StutterZero和StutterFormer两种端到端的波形到波形模型，能够直接将口吃语音转换为流畅语音并同时预测其转录文本，相比现有方法在词错误率和语义相似度方面有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球有超过7000万人经历口吃问题，但现有自动语音系统往往错误解释或无法准确转录不流畅的语音。传统方法依赖手工特征提取或多阶段ASR-TTS流程，导致失真放大。

Method: StutterZero采用卷积双向LSTM编码器-解码器加注意力机制，StutterFormer集成双流Transformer并共享声学-语言表示。两种架构均在SEP-28K和LibriStutter语料库合成的配对口吃-流畅数据上训练。

Result: StutterZero相比领先的Whisper-Medium模型，词错误率降低24%，BERTScore语义相似度提升31%；StutterFormer表现更好，词错误率降低28%，BERTScore提升34%。

Conclusion: 结果验证了直接端到端口吃到流畅语音转换的可行性，为人机交互、语音治疗和可访问性AI系统提供了新机会。

Abstract: Over 70 million people worldwide experience stuttering, yet most automatic
speech systems misinterpret disfluent utterances or fail to transcribe them
accurately. Existing methods for stutter correction rely on handcrafted feature
extraction or multi-stage automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech
(TTS) pipelines, which separate transcription from audio reconstruction and
often amplify distortions. This work introduces StutterZero and StutterFormer,
the first end-to-end waveform-to-waveform models that directly convert
stuttered speech into fluent speech while jointly predicting its transcription.
StutterZero employs a convolutional-bidirectional LSTM encoder-decoder with
attention, whereas StutterFormer integrates a dual-stream Transformer with
shared acoustic-linguistic representations. Both architectures are trained on
paired stuttered-fluent data synthesized from the SEP-28K and LibriStutter
corpora and evaluated on unseen speakers from the FluencyBank dataset. Across
all benchmarks, StutterZero had a 24% decrease in Word Error Rate (WER) and a
31% improvement in semantic similarity (BERTScore) compared to the leading
Whisper-Medium model. StutterFormer achieved better results, with a 28%
decrease in WER and a 34% improvement in BERTScore. The results validate the
feasibility of direct end-to-end stutter-to-fluent speech conversion, offering
new opportunities for inclusive human-computer interaction, speech therapy, and
accessibility-oriented AI systems.

Result: 在AndroidWorld和AndroidLab基准测试中分别达到77.2%和50.7%的成功率，创下新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 当前基准测试不足以全面评估操作系统代理，未来需要在评估范式、代理协作和安全性方面进一步探索。

Abstract: With the advancements in hardware, software, and large language model
technologies, the interaction between humans and operating systems has evolved
from the command-line interface to the rapidly emerging AI agent interactions.
Building an operating system (OS) agent capable of executing user instructions
and faithfully following user desires is becoming a reality. In this technical
report, we present ColorAgent, an OS agent designed to engage in long-horizon,
robust interactions with the environment while also enabling personalized and
proactive user interaction. To enable long-horizon interactions with the
environment, we enhance the model's capabilities through step-wise
reinforcement learning and self-evolving training, while also developing a
tailored multi-agent framework that ensures generality, consistency, and
robustness. In terms of user interaction, we explore personalized user intent
recognition and proactive engagement, positioning the OS agent not merely as an
automation tool but as a warm, collaborative partner. We evaluate ColorAgent on
the AndroidWorld and AndroidLab benchmarks, achieving success rates of 77.2%
and 50.7%, respectively, establishing a new state of the art. Nonetheless, we
note that current benchmarks are insufficient for a comprehensive evaluation of
OS agents and propose further exploring directions in future work, particularly
in the areas of evaluation paradigms, agent collaboration, and security. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在医疗领域迅速扩展，但这些系统按照CONSORT标准评估临床试验报告的能力仍不明确，特别是在认知和推理策略方面。

Method: 采用行为和元认知分析方法，使用专家验证数据，在三种提示条件下系统比较两个代表性LLMs。

Result: 模型在处理不同CONSORT项目和提示类型时表现出明显差异，包括推理风格转变、明确不确定性和替代解释，这些因素塑造了响应模式。

Conclusion: 结果突出了这些系统在临床合规自动化方面的当前局限性，并强调了理解其认知适应和策略行为对于开发更可解释和可靠的医疗AI的重要性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid expansion of Large Language Models (LLMs) in healthcare,
the ability of these systems to assess clinical trial reporting according to
CONSORT standards remains unclear, particularly with respect to their cognitive
and reasoning strategies. This study applies a behavioral and metacognitive
analytic approach with expert-validated data, systematically comparing two
representative LLMs under three prompt conditions. Clear differences emerged in
how the models approached various CONSORT items, and prompt types, including
shifts in reasoning style, explicit uncertainty, and alternative
interpretations shaped response patterns. Our results highlight the current
limitations of these systems in clinical compliance automation and underscore
the importance of understanding their cognitive adaptations and strategic
behavior in developing more explainable and reliable medical AI.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了推理模型中的模式选择问题，将其识别为早期退出问题的更具挑战性变体，旨在通过零步思考减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理模型在数学和逻辑推理任务中表现出色，但逐步思考过程会导致过度思考和不必要的计算开销。模式选择和早期退出方法都旨在减轻这种计算负担。

Method: 将模式选择视为早期退出问题的变体，比较了九种基线方法，包括基于提示的方法和利用模型内部信息的方法。

Result: 基于提示的方法由于分类能力有限而经常失败，而利用内部信息的方法在大多数场景中表现更好但仍存在稳定性问题。

Conclusion: 现有仅依赖模型提供信息的方法不足以有效解决信息有限场景下的模式选择问题，凸显了该任务的持续挑战性。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated exceptional performance in tasks such as
mathematics and logical reasoning, primarily due to their ability to engage in
step-by-step thinking during the reasoning process. However, this often leads
to overthinking, resulting in unnecessary computational overhead. To address
this issue, Mode Selection aims to automatically decide between Long-CoT
(Chain-of-Thought) or Short-CoT by utilizing either a Thinking or NoThinking
mode. Simultaneously, Early Exit determines the optimal stopping point during
the iterative reasoning process. Both methods seek to reduce the computational
burden. In this paper, we first identify Mode Selection as a more challenging
variant of the Early Exit problem, as they share similar objectives but differ
in decision timing. While Early Exit focuses on determining the best stopping
point for concise reasoning at inference time, Mode Selection must make this
decision at the beginning of the reasoning process, relying on pre-defined fake
thoughts without engaging in an explicit reasoning process, referred to as
zero-step thinking. Through empirical studies on nine baselines, we observe
that prompt-based approaches often fail due to their limited classification
capabilities when provided with minimal hand-crafted information. In contrast,
approaches that leverage internal information generally perform better across
most scenarios but still exhibit issues with stability. Our findings indicate
that existing methods relying solely on the information provided by models are
insufficient for effectively addressing Mode Selection in scenarios with
limited information, highlighting the ongoing challenges of this task. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Trae1ounG/Zero_Step_Thinking.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Memo是一个基于transformer的架构和训练方法，用于解决强化学习中记忆密集型、长视野任务的挑战。它通过在训练时插入周期性总结标记来创建和检索记忆，在计算和存储效率上优于传统长上下文transformer基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的具身智能体策略在处理视觉输入时经常超出上下文限制，而人类能够维护和利用压缩为记忆的终身经验。现有方法主要关注固定大小记忆的循环模型或完全依赖上下文的transformer，缺乏有效的记忆压缩机制。

Method: Memo架构在训练过程中将周期性总结标记与模型输入交错排列，实现记忆的创建和检索。这种方法允许模型在长视野任务中有效管理记忆，同时保持计算效率。

Result: 在网格世界元强化学习基准和逼真室内环境中的多目标导航任务上，Memo优于朴素的长上下文transformer基线。它能够更好地泛化到更长的推理上下文，并在需要截断历史上下文以适应推理约束的流式设置中保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Memo提供了一种有效的记忆管理方法，使transformer模型能够在记忆密集型任务中实现更好的性能，同时保持计算和存储效率，为解决长视野强化学习任务中的记忆挑战提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.

TL;DR: HSCodeComp是首个针对深度搜索代理在分层规则应用方面的电商基准测试，要求代理根据产品描述预测10位HS编码，结果显示最佳代理准确率仅46.8%，远低于人类专家的95.0%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代理基准测试忽视了深度搜索代理在应用复杂规则（如法律条款、医疗手册和关税规则）方面的能力，这些规则具有模糊边界和隐式逻辑关系，对代理构成挑战。

Method: 从大型电商平台收集真实数据构建HSCodeComp基准，包含632个产品条目，涵盖多样产品类别，HS编码由多位人类专家标注。

Result: 在多个最先进LLM、开源和闭源代理上的实验显示巨大性能差距：最佳代理仅达到46.8%的10位准确率，远低于人类专家的95.0%，且测试时扩展无法进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 分层规则应用对深度搜索代理具有显著挑战性，当前代理在此类任务上表现不佳，需要进一步研究来提升其复杂规则应用能力。

Abstract: Effective deep search agents must not only access open-domain and
domain-specific knowledge but also apply complex rules-such as legal clauses,
medical manuals and tariff rules. These rules often feature vague boundaries
and implicit logic relationships, making precise application challenging for
agents. However, this critical capability is largely overlooked by current
agent benchmarks.
  To fill this gap, we introduce HSCodeComp, the first realistic, expert-level
e-commerce benchmark designed to evaluate deep search agents in hierarchical
rule application. In this task, the deep reasoning process of agents is guided
by these rules to predict 10-digit Harmonized System Code (HSCode) of products
with noisy but realistic descriptions. These codes, established by the World
Customs Organization, are vital for global supply chain efficiency. Built from
real-world data collected from large-scale e-commerce platforms, our proposed
HSCodeComp comprises 632 product entries spanning diverse product categories,
with these HSCodes annotated by several human experts.
  Extensive experimental results on several state-of-the-art LLMs, open-source,
and closed-source agents reveal a huge performance gap: best agent achieves
only 46.8% 10-digit accuracy, far below human experts at 95.0%. Besides,
detailed analysis demonstrates the challenges of hierarchical rule application,
and test-time scaling fails to improve performance further.

Result: 在安全基准测试中达到最先进性能，在英语、中文和多语言任务中的提示和响应分类表现出色。

Conclusion: OpenGuardrails为LLM提供了全面的保护解决方案，所有模型在Apache 2.0许可下公开发布使用。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into
real-world applications, safeguarding them against unsafe, malicious, or
privacy-violating content is critically important. We present OpenGuardrails,
the first open-source project to provide both a context-aware safety and
manipulation detection model and a deployable platform for comprehensive AI
guardrails. OpenGuardrails protects against content-safety risks,
model-manipulation attacks (e.g., prompt injection, jailbreaking,
code-interpreter abuse, and the generation/execution of malicious code), and
data leakage. Content-safety and model-manipulation detection are implemented
by a unified large model, while data-leakage identification and redaction are
performed by a separate lightweight NER pipeline (e.g., Presidio-style models
or regex-based detectors). The system can be deployed as a security gateway or
an API-based service, with enterprise-grade, fully private deployment options.
OpenGuardrails achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on safety
benchmarks, excelling in both prompt and response classification across
English, Chinese, and multilingual tasks. All models are released under the
Apache 2.0 license for public use.

Abstract: As the volume of stored data continues to grow, identifying and protecting
sensitive information within large repositories becomes increasingly
challenging, especially when shared with multiple users with different roles
and permissions. This work presents a system architecture for trusted data
sharing with policy-driven access control, enabling selective protection of
sensitive regions while maintaining scalability. The proposed architecture
integrates four core modules that combine automated detection of sensitive
regions, post-correction, key management, and access control. Sensitive regions
are secured using a hybrid scheme that employs symmetric encryption for
efficiency and Attribute-Based Encryption for policy enforcement. The system
supports efficient key distribution and isolates key storage to strengthen
overall security. To demonstrate its applicability, we evaluate the system on
visual datasets, where Privacy-Sensitive Objects in images are automatically
detected, reassessed, and selectively encrypted prior to sharing in a data
repository. Experimental results show that our system provides effective PSO
detection, increases macro-averaged F1 score (5%) and mean Average Precision
(10%), and maintains an average policy-enforced decryption time of less than 1
second per image. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and
scalability of our proposed solution for fine-grained access control.

Abstract: News spreads rapidly across languages and regions, but translations may lose
subtle nuances. We propose a method to align sentences in multilingual news
articles using optimal transport, identifying semantically similar content
across languages. We apply this method to align more than 140,000 pairs of
Bloomberg English and Japanese news articles covering around 3500 stocks in
Tokyo exchange over 2012-2024. Aligned sentences are sparser, more
interpretable, and exhibit higher semantic similarity. Return scores
constructed from aligned sentences show stronger correlations with realized
stock returns, and long-short trading strategies based on these alignments
achieve 10\% higher Sharpe ratios than analyzing the full text sample.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and precise morphological analysis of neuronal cells in
fluorescence microscopy images are crucial steps in neuroscience and biomedical
imaging applications. However, this process is labor-intensive and
time-consuming, requiring significant manual effort and expertise to ensure
reliable outcomes. This work presents a pipeline for neuron instance
segmentation and measurement based on a high-resolution dataset of
stem-cell-derived neurons. The proposed method uses YOLOv8, trained on manually
annotated microscopy images. The model achieved high segmentation accuracy,
exceeding 97%. In addition, the pipeline utilized both ground truth and
predicted masks to extract biologically significant features, including cell
length, width, area, and grayscale intensity values. The overall accuracy of
the extracted morphological measurements reached 75.32%, further supporting the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. This integrated framework offers a
valuable tool for automated analysis in cell imaging and neuroscience research,
reducing the need for manual annotation and enabling scalable, precise
quantification of neuron morphology.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了LLMs在健康咨询中的互动方式，发现主动寻求上下文信息能显著提升用户体验，并开发了"Wayfinding AI"来验证这一设计模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在健康信息查询中，LLMs虽然能提供个性化信息，但也存在不准确、有偏见或误导的风险。研究旨在了解人们如何与LLMs互动解决自身健康问题，并改进交互设计。

Method: 进行了4项混合方法研究（共163名参与者），包括定性研究揭示上下文寻求的重要性，以及开发"Wayfinding AI"进行随机盲法研究对比。

Result: 参与者认为Wayfinding AI比基线AI更有帮助、更相关且更贴合他们的关切。主动寻求上下文即使延迟回答也被用户重视。

Conclusion: 主动上下文寻求对对话动态有强烈影响，为帮助导航健康话题的对话AI提供了设计模式。

Abstract: Navigating health questions can be daunting in the modern information
landscape. Large language models (LLMs) may provide tailored, accessible
information, but also risk being inaccurate, biased or misleading. We present
insights from 4 mixed-methods studies (total N=163), examining how people
interact with LLMs for their own health questions. Qualitative studies revealed
the importance of context-seeking in conversational AIs to elicit specific
details a person may not volunteer or know to share. Context-seeking by LLMs
was valued by participants, even if it meant deferring an answer for several
turns. Incorporating these insights, we developed a "Wayfinding AI" to
proactively solicit context. In a randomized, blinded study, participants rated
the Wayfinding AI as more helpful, relevant, and tailored to their concerns
compared to a baseline AI. These results demonstrate the strong impact of
proactive context-seeking on conversational dynamics, and suggest design
patterns for conversational AI to help navigate health topics.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical data scarcity that hinders the practical
deployment of learning to defer (L2D) systems to the population. We introduce a
context-aware, semi-supervised framework that uses meta-learning to generate
expert-specific embeddings from only a few demonstrations. We demonstrate the
efficacy of a dual-purpose mechanism, where these embeddings are used first to
generate a large corpus of pseudo-labels for training, and subsequently to
enable on-the-fly adaptation to new experts at test-time. The experiment
results on three different datasets confirm that a model trained on these
synthetic labels rapidly approaches oracle-level performance, validating the
data efficiency of our approach. By resolving a key training bottleneck, this
work makes adaptive L2D systems more practical and scalable, paving the way for
human-AI collaboration in real-world environments. To facilitate
reproducibility and address implementation details not covered in the main
text, we provide our source code and training configurations at
https://github.com/nil123532/learning-to-defer-to-a-population-with-limited-demonstrations.
