TL;DR: 论文提出EvalCards作为解决NLP评估报告不足的新方法，旨在提升评估透明度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NLP评估报告存在三个主要问题：可复现性、可访问性和治理不足，现有标准化努力仍不够充分

Method: 引入评估披露卡(EvalCards)，为研究人员和从业者提供增强透明度的实用框架

Result: EvalCards旨在为满足新兴治理要求提供实践基础，改善评估报告的透明度

Conclusion: EvalCards是推进NLP评估报告透明度的可行路径，能同时服务于研究者和实践者

Abstract: Evaluation has long been a central concern in NLP, and transparent reporting practices are more critical than ever in today's landscape of rapidly released open-access models. Drawing on a survey of recent work on evaluation and documentation, we identify three persistent shortcomings in current reporting practices: reproducibility, accessibility, and governance. We argue that existing standardization efforts remain insufficient and introduce Evaluation Disclosure Cards (EvalCards) as a path forward. EvalCards are designed to enhance transparency for both researchers and practitioners while providing a practical foundation to meet emerging governance requirements.

Abstract: We present Cacheback Decoding, a training-free and model-agnostic speculative decoding method that exploits the locality in language to accelerate Large Language Model (LLM) inference. Cacheback leverages only Least Recently Used (LRU) cache tables of token n-grams to generate draft sequences. Cacheback achieves state-of-the-art performance among comparable methods despite its minimalist design, and its simplicity allows easy integration into existing systems. Cacheback also shows potential for fast adaptation to new domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出JELV框架，通过编辑级有效性验证解决语法纠错系统参考多样性不足问题，提升评估准确性和模型泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语法纠错系统因参考多样性有限，导致评估被低估且模型泛化能力受限。需要自动化框架验证修正编辑的有效性。

Method: 提出JELV框架，包含两个实现：1) 多轮LLM作为评判者的流程，达到90%人类标注一致性；2) 蒸馏的DeBERTa分类器，对有效编辑达到85%精确率。应用JELV重新分类评估中的误判假阳性，并整合假阳性解耦和流畅性评分。

Result: JELV在人类标注的PEVData基准上表现优异。应用JELV过滤LLM生成的修正候选，扩展了BEA19数据集（38,692个源句）。在扩展数据集上重新训练顶级GEC系统获得可测量的性能提升。

Conclusion: JELV为增强参考多样性和加强评估与模型泛化提供了可扩展解决方案，在语法纠错领域具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Existing Grammatical Error Correction (GEC) systems suffer from limited reference diversity, leading to underestimated evaluation and restricted model generalization. To address this issue, we introduce the Judge of Edit-Level Validity (JELV), an automated framework to validate correction edits from grammaticality, faithfulness, and fluency. Using our proposed human-annotated Pair-wise Edit-level Validity Dataset (PEVData) as benchmark, JELV offers two implementations: a multi-turn LLM-as-Judges pipeline achieving 90% agreement with human annotators, and a distilled DeBERTa classifier with 85% precision on valid edits. We then apply JELV to reclassify misjudged false positives in evaluation and derive a comprehensive evaluation metric by integrating false positive decoupling and fluency scoring, resulting in state-of-the-art correlation with human judgments. We also apply JELV to filter LLM-generated correction candidates, expanding the BEA19's single-reference dataset containing 38,692 source sentences. Retraining top GEC systems on this expanded dataset yields measurable performance gains. JELV provides a scalable solution for enhancing reference diversity and strengthening both evaluation and model generalization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的快速发展，其在医学领域的应用潜力引起了广泛关注。需要系统评估这些模型在专业医学任务上的表现，为医学教育和临床决策支持系统的部署提供依据。

Method: 建立了一个包含2,800个精心筛选问题的评估框架，涵盖心血管、消化、血液、感染、肾脏、神经和呼吸7个医学专业，区分主治医师和主任医师两个难度级别，对27个最先进的LLM进行了全面评估。

Result: Mixtral-8x7B以74.25%的准确率表现最佳，DeepSeek-R1-671B以64.07%次之。模型大小与性能无一致相关性，混合专家架构的小模型表现优异。不同医学专业间存在显著性能差异，心血管和神经科表现较好，消化和肾脏科较差。顶级模型在两个难度级别间性能下降最小，显示出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该基准为LLM在医学教育和临床决策支持系统的部署提供了重要见解，既展示了这些技术在专业医学环境中的潜力，也揭示了当前局限性。模型架构优化比单纯扩大规模更重要，需要针对不同医学专业进行专门优化。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has prompted significant interest in their potential applications in medical domains. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark evaluation of 27 state-of-the-art LLMs on Chinese medical examination questions, encompassing seven medical specialties across two professional levels. We introduce a robust evaluation framework that assesses model performance on 2,800 carefully curated questions from cardiovascular, gastroenterology, hematology, infectious diseases, nephrology, neurology, and respiratory medicine domains. Our dataset distinguishes between attending physician and senior physician difficulty levels, providing nuanced insights into model capabilities across varying complexity. Our empirical analysis reveals substantial performance variations among models, with Mixtral-8x7B achieving the highest overall accuracy of 74.25%, followed by DeepSeek-R1-671B at 64.07%. Notably, we observe no consistent correlation between model size and performance, as evidenced by the strong performance of smaller mixture-of-experts architectures. The evaluation demonstrates significant performance gaps between medical specialties, with models generally performing better on cardiovascular and neurology questions compared to gastroenterology and nephrology domains. Furthermore, our analysis indicates minimal performance degradation between attending and senior physician levels for top-performing models, suggesting robust generalization capabilities. This benchmark provides critical insights for the deployment of LLMs in medical education and clinical decision support systems, highlighting both the promise and current limitations of these technologies in specialized medical contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CSV-Decode通过几何上界构建小型子词汇表，在保持正确性保证的同时显著加速大语言模型推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推理时面临计算瓶颈，主要由于在大词汇表上进行昂贵的输出层计算

Method: 使用几何上界为每个解码步骤构建小子词汇表，通过离线聚类词汇嵌入，利用质心加半径边界识别可安全省略的token，实现稀疏计算

Result: 实验结果显示相比完整词汇表解码有显著加速，同时保持分布保证和低回退率

Conclusion: CSV-Decode提供了一种高效的大语言模型推理方法，通过稀疏计算减少计算开销，同时提供双重正确性保证

Abstract: Large language models face significant computational bottlenecks during inference due to the expensive output layer computation over large vocabularies. We present CSV-Decode, a novel approach that uses geometric upper bounds to construct small sub-vocabularies for each decoding step, enabling efficient sparse computation while maintaining dual correctness guarantees: exact top-$k$ certification and $\varepsilon$-certified softmax approximations. Our method clusters vocabulary embeddings offline and uses centroid-plus-radius bounds to identify which tokens can be safely omitted from computation. We provide a complete system implementation with sparse GEMV kernels, multi-GPU sharding, and CUDA Graph optimization. Experimental results demonstrate significant speedup over full vocabulary decoding while maintaining distributional guarantees and low fallback rates.

### [6] [Evaluating Embedding Generalization: How LLMs, LoRA, and SLERP Shape Representational Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21703)
*Siyaxolisa Kabane*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 比较LLM与非LLM编码器在文本嵌入泛化能力上的差异，研究SLERP模型合并如何缓解任务适配带来的过专业化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型(LLM)与非LLM编码器在文本嵌入任务中的泛化特性差异，探索模型合并技术（特别是SLERP）如何解决任务特定适配（如LoRA）导致的过专业化问题

Method: 设计受控实验套件，让模型嵌入短数字序列并根据数论特性进行聚类和分类评估。比较四类模型：非LLM编码器、LoRA适配的LLM编码器、模型合并的LLM编码器、SLERP合并的LLM编码器。使用聚类指标（Silhouette和Davies Bouldin）评估表示质量

Result: LLM骨干网络能更好地捕捉高阶组合数字模式，但容易产生适配器主导问题，损害平衡泛化能力。SLERP合并能有效恢复基础模型结构，同时保留大部分任务增益，在聚类可分性、鲁棒性和泛化能力方面表现优于其他方法

Conclusion: SLERP模型合并技术为LLM嵌入任务提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在保持任务性能的同时恢复基础模型的泛化能力，实现更好的平衡

Abstract: We investigate the generalization properties of dense text embeddings when the embedding backbone is a large language model (LLM) versus when it is a non-LLM encoder, and we study the extent to which spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) model-merging mitigates over-specialization introduced by task-specific adaptation (e.g., LoRA). To make the comparison concrete and domain-agnostic, we design a controlled suite of experiments in which models embed short numerical sequences and are evaluated on their ability to cluster and classify those sequences according to well-defined number-theoretic properties. Our experimental protocol compares four families of models: (1) non-LLM encoders trained from scratch or fine-tuned for embeddings, (2) LLM-based encoders adapted with parameter-efficient methods (LoRA), (3) LLM-based encoders with LoRA followed by model souping merging into the base weights, and (4) the same LoRA-adapted LLMs merged using SLERP across checkpoints or stages. We evaluate representational quality with clustering indices (Silhouette and Davies Bouldin). We additionally analyze the use of kmeans labels to see if the embeddings encode any other information besides the one we are testing for. Empirically, we find that LLM-based backbones produce embeddings that better capture higher-order, compositional numeric patterns, but are prone to adapter dominance that degrades balanced generalization; SLERP merging consistently recovers base-model structure while retaining most task gains, yielding superior tradeoffs in clustering separability, and robustness compared to model souping or models that were not merged.

### [7] [On the Cross-lingual Transferability of Pre-trained wav2vec2-based Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21704)
*Jonatas Grosman,Cassio Almeida,Guilherme Schardong,Hélio Lopes*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究wav2vec2预训练模型的跨语言迁移能力，发现预训练数据的多样性比数据量更重要，印欧语系语言表现优于非印欧语系，且语言相似性促进跨语言知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然wav2vec2等大型预训练模型在各种语音任务中取得SOTA，但现有研究很少深入探讨这些模型在不同语言间的跨语言迁移能力，特别是当目标语言与预训练语言不同时。本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用15个大型预训练模型，在18种语言的语音识别任务上进行微调实验，系统评估跨语言迁移效果。

Result: 1) 预训练数据的多样性比数据量对最终性能更重要；2) 印欧语系语言表现优于非印欧语系语言；3) 单语模型存在正向跨语言知识迁移，且语言相似性越高迁移效果越明显。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了wav2vec2预训练模型的跨语言迁移特性，为科学社区更好地利用现有模型和训练新模型提供了指导，强调了预训练数据多样性和语言相似性的重要性。

Abstract: Using representations provided by a large pre-trained model has become the primary strategy for achieving state-of-the-art results in a wide range of tasks. A recently proposed large pre-trained model, wav2vec 2.0, was seminal for several other works on pre-training large models on speech data. Many models are being pre-trained using the same architecture as wav2vec 2.0 and are getting state-of-the-art in various speech-related tasks. Previous work has demonstrated that the data used during the pre-training of these wav2vec2-based models can impact the model's performance in downstream tasks, and this should be taken into consideration before utilizing these models. However, few works have proposed investigating further how the transfer knowledge of these pre-trained models behaves in different languages, even when the target language differs from the one used during the model's pre-training. Our work aims to investigate the cross-lingual transferability of these wav2vec2-based models. We performed several fine-tuning experiments on the speech recognition task in 18 languages using 15 large pre-trained models. The results of our experiments showed us that the size of data used during the pre-training of these models is not as important to the final performance as the diversity. We noticed that the performance of Indo-European languages is superior to non-Indo-European languages in the evaluated models. We have observed a positive cross-lingual transfer of knowledge using monolingual models, which was evident in all the languages we used, but more pronounced when the language used during pre-training was more similar to the downstream task language. With these findings, we aim to assist the scientific community in utilizing existing wav2vec2-based pre-trained models, as well as facilitate the pre-training of new ones.

*Junjie Wu,Yumeng Fu,Chen Gong,Guohong Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Insight-A框架，利用多模态大语言模型进行多模态虚假信息检测，通过溯源伪造来源和分层推理来识别跨模态失真


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容技术成为社交媒体多模态虚假信息的主要来源，对社会安全构成威胁。现有方法使用标准提示词让MLLMs识别虚假信息，但忽略了虚假信息的溯源分析。

Method: 1) 交叉溯源提示(CAP)：基于生成模式将虚假信息溯源到伪造痕迹，建模感知与推理的复杂关联；2) 自动溯源去偏提示(ADP)：减少人工标注提示的主观性，实现MLLMs的任务适配；3) 图像描述(IC)：获取视觉细节以增强跨模态一致性检查；4) 分层推理管道检测跨模态失真

Result: 大量实验证明该方法的优越性，为AIGC时代的多模态虚假信息检测提供了新范式

Conclusion: Insight-A通过溯源伪造来源和分层推理，有效提升了多模态虚假信息检测能力，解决了现有方法忽略虚假信息溯源的问题

Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) technology has emerged as a prevalent alternative to create multimodal misinformation on social media platforms, posing unprecedented threats to societal safety. However, standard prompting leverages multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to identify the emerging misinformation, which ignores the misinformation attribution. To this end, we present Insight-A, exploring attribution with MLLM insights for detecting multimodal misinformation. Insight-A makes two efforts: I) attribute misinformation to forgery sources, and II) an effective pipeline with hierarchical reasoning that detects distortions across modalities. Specifically, to attribute misinformation to forgery traces based on generation patterns, we devise cross-attribution prompting (CAP) to model the sophisticated correlations between perception and reasoning. Meanwhile, to reduce the subjectivity of human-annotated prompts, automatic attribution-debiased prompting (ADP) is used for task adaptation on MLLMs. Additionally, we design image captioning (IC) to achieve visual details for enhancing cross-modal consistency checking. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposal and provide a new paradigm for multimodal misinformation detection in the era of AIGC.

### [9] [A General Highly Accurate Online Planning Method Integrating Large Language Models into Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation for Dialogue Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21706)
*Hui Wang,Fafa Zhang,Xiaoyu Zhang,Chaoxu Mu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NRPA-GD：一种基于大型语言模型的对话策略规划方法，无需特定模型训练，通过嵌套蒙特卡洛模拟和政策自适应优化目标导向对话


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标导向对话方法依赖复杂的提示工程（效果依赖人工经验）或需要训练策略网络（难以适应新场景且训练成本高），需要一种无需特定训练、能动态调整策略的方法

Method: 提出NRPA-GD方法：1）使用LLM同时模拟用户和系统行为；2）构建对话轨迹的完整评估机制；3）采用嵌套蒙特卡洛模拟和政策自适应的优化框架动态调整对话策略

Result: 在四个典型目标导向对话数据集上，NRPA-GD优于现有提示工程方法和预训练模型方法，仅使用0.6亿参数的LLM就超越了ChatGPT和预训练策略模型

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在LLM上应用规划方法解决实际规划任务的优势和新颖性，为无需特定训练的目标导向对话提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In goal-oriented dialogue tasks, the main challenge is to steer the interaction towards a given goal within a limited number of turns. Existing approaches either rely on elaborate prompt engineering, whose effectiveness is heavily dependent on human experience, or integrate policy networks and pre-trained policy models, which are usually difficult to adapt to new dialogue scenarios and costly to train. Therefore, in this paper, we present Nested Rollout Policy Adaptation for Goal-oriented Dialogue (NRPA-GD), a novel dialogue policy planning method that completely avoids specific model training by utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to simulate behaviors of user and system at the same time. Specifically, NRPA-GD constructs a complete evaluation mechanism for dialogue trajectories and employs an optimization framework of nested Monte Carlo simulation and policy self-adaptation to dynamically adjust policies during the dialogue process. The experimental results on four typical goal-oriented dialogue datasets show that NRPA-GD outperforms both existing prompt engineering and specifically pre-trained model-based methods. Impressively, NRPA-GD surpasses ChatGPT and pre-trained policy models with only a 0.6-billion-parameter LLM. The proposed approach further demonstrates the advantages and novelty of employing planning methods on LLMs to solve practical planning tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估大语言模型在数据准备任务中的能力，包括数据分析和清洗，并与传统工具对比


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据准备是数据驱动流程中关键但劳动密集的步骤，需要探索大语言模型是否能有效支持用户选择和自动化数据准备任务

Method: 使用通用和微调的表格大语言模型，用低质量数据集进行提示，测量其执行数据分析和清洗任务的能力，并与传统数据准备工具对比

Result: 开发了经过用户研究验证的定制质量模型来评估大语言模型能力，获得了从业者期望的见解

Conclusion: 大语言模型在支持数据准备任务方面具有潜力，但需要进一步评估其与传统工具的实际效果对比

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated their exceptional capabilities in supporting and automating various tasks. Among the tasks worth exploring for testing large language model capabilities, we considered data preparation, a critical yet often labor-intensive step in data-driven processes. This paper investigates whether large language models can effectively support users in selecting and automating data preparation tasks. To this aim, we considered both general-purpose and fine-tuned tabular large language models. We prompted these models with poor-quality datasets and measured their ability to perform tasks such as data profiling and cleaning. We also compare the support provided by large language models with that offered by traditional data preparation tools. To evaluate the capabilities of large language models, we developed a custom-designed quality model that has been validated through a user study to gain insights into practitioners' expectations.

*Blessed Guda,Lawrence Francis,Gabrial Zencha Ashungafac,Carlee Joe-Wong,Moise Busogi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对LLMs在MCQ任务中的选择偏差问题，提出了无监督的排列偏差度量、高效多数投票方法和LoRA微调策略，以提升评估可靠性并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在MCQ任务中存在选择偏差（受答案位置或选项符号影响而非内容），这削弱了MCQ作为评估框架的可靠性。现有偏差度量方法需要答案标签且无法充分捕捉模型在不同答案排序下预测的一致性，而现有缓解策略存在计算成本高或泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 1) 提出无监督标签无关的排列偏差度量(PBM)，直接量化模型在不同答案排列下预测的不一致性；2) 提出高效的多数投票方法BaQCKV，通过批量问题-上下文KV缓存显著降低计算成本；3) 基于PBM和BaQCKV提出无监督LoRA-1微调策略，在保持模型泛化能力的同时缓解选择偏差。

Result: 在多个MCQ基准测试上的实验表明，所提方法有效减少了选择偏差，提高了准确性的一致性，同时最小化了计算成本。

Conclusion: 本文提出的PBM度量、BaQCKV高效投票方法和LoRA-1微调策略为解决LLMs在MCQ任务中的选择偏差问题提供了有效且计算高效的解决方案，提升了MCQ评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Multiple Choice Question (MCQ) answering is a widely used method for evaluating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, LLMs often exhibit selection bias in MCQ tasks, where their choices are influenced by factors like answer position or option symbols rather than the content. This bias undermines the reliability of MCQ as an evaluation framework. Most existing selection bias metrics require answer labels and measure divergences between prediction and answer distributions, but do not fully capture the consistency of a model's predictions across different orderings of answer choices. Existing selection bias mitigation strategies have notable limitations: majority voting, though effective, is computationally prohibitive; calibration-based methods require validation sets and often fail to generalize across datasets. To address these gaps, we propose three key contributions: (1) a new unsupervised label-free Permutation Bias Metric (PBM) that directly quantifies inconsistencies in model predictions across answer permutations, providing a more precise measure of selection bias, (2) an efficient majority voting approach called Batch Question-Context KV caching (BaQCKV), to significantly reduce computational costs while preserving bias mitigation effectiveness, and (3) an unsupervised Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-1) fine-tuning strategy based on our proposed metric and the BaQCKV that mitigates selection bias, providing a computationally efficient alternative that maintains model generalizability. Experiments across multiple MCQ benchmarks demonstrate that our approaches reduce bias, increasing consistency in accuracy while minimizing computational costs.

### [12] [Addressing Stereotypes in Large Language Models: A Critical Examination and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21711)
*Fatima Kazi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型中的偏见问题，使用StereoSet和CrowSPairs基准测试多种模型，发现微调模型在性别偏见上表现不佳但在种族偏见识别上较好，提出增强学习策略可提升性能20%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型在NLP领域的普及，这些模型继承了训练数据中的显性和隐性偏见，包括社会、伦理、文化、宗教等偏见和刻板印象。需要全面检查这些缺陷，识别偏见的存在和程度，并尝试减轻偏见输出以确保公平性，减少有害刻板印象和错误信息。

Method: 使用StereoSet和CrowSPairs等偏见特定基准测试评估BERT、GPT 3.5和ADA等多种生成模型中的偏见。采用三管齐下的方法检测显性和隐性偏见，进行彻底和包容性分析。应用增强学习策略，包括微调、不同提示技术和偏见基准数据增强。

Result: 结果显示微调模型在性别偏见方面表现不佳，但在识别和避免种族偏见方面表现优异。LLMs经常过度依赖提示中的关键词，无法真正理解输出的准确性和真实性。增强学习策略使微调模型在跨数据集测试中表现出良好的适应性，在隐性偏见基准测试中性能提升高达20%。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了在生成式AI快速发展背景下解决LLMs偏见问题的重要性。虽然模型在某些偏见识别方面有成功案例，但仍存在局限性。增强学习策略显示出改善模型性能的潜力，特别是在处理隐性偏见方面。需要进一步研究以确保AI输出的公平性和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have gained popularity in recent years with the advancement of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with use cases spanning many disciplines and daily lives as well. LLMs inherit explicit and implicit biases from the datasets they were trained on; these biases can include social, ethical, cultural, religious, and other prejudices and stereotypes. It is important to comprehensively examine such shortcomings by identifying the existence and extent of such biases, recognizing the origin, and attempting to mitigate such biased outputs to ensure fair outputs to reduce harmful stereotypes and misinformation. This study inspects and highlights the need to address biases in LLMs amid growing generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). We utilize bias-specific benchmarks such StereoSet and CrowSPairs to evaluate the existence of various biases in many different generative models such as BERT, GPT 3.5, and ADA. To detect both explicit and implicit biases, we adopt a three-pronged approach for thorough and inclusive analysis. Results indicate fine-tuned models struggle with gender biases but excel at identifying and avoiding racial biases. Our findings also illustrated that despite some cases of success, LLMs often over-rely on keywords in prompts and its outputs. This demonstrates the incapability of LLMs to attempt to truly understand the accuracy and authenticity of its outputs. Finally, in an attempt to bolster model performance, we applied an enhancement learning strategy involving fine-tuning, models using different prompting techniques, and data augmentation of the bias benchmarks. We found fine-tuned models to exhibit promising adaptability during cross-dataset testing and significantly enhanced performance on implicit bias benchmarks, with performance gains of up to 20%.

TL;DR: EulerESG是一个基于LLM的ESG报告分析系统，通过双通道检索和LLM驱动的披露分析，能够自动填充标准对齐的指标表格，准确率高达0.95


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ESG报告主要以长而异构的PDF文档形式发布，难以系统回答简单问题。现有工具要么依赖脆弱的规则提取，要么将ESG报告视为通用文本，没有明确建模底层报告标准

Method: 结合(i)双通道检索和LLM驱动的ESG报告披露分析，以及(ii)交互式仪表板和聊天机器人，用于探索、基准测试和解释

Result: 使用4家全球知名公司和12个SASB子行业，EulerESG能够以高保真度（平均准确率高达0.95）自动填充标准对齐的指标表格，同时保持端到端运行时间的实用性

Conclusion: EulerESG是一个实用的LLM驱动系统，能够有效自动化ESG披露分析，并明确考虑ESG框架，解决了现有工具的局限性

Abstract: Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reports have become central to how companies communicate climate risk, social impact, and governance practices, yet they are still published primarily as long, heterogeneous PDF documents. This makes it difficult to systematically answer seemingly simple questions. Existing tools either rely on brittle rule-based extraction or treat ESG reports as generic text, without explicitly modelling the underlying reporting standards. We present \textbf{EulerESG}, an LLM-powered system for automating ESG disclosure analysis with explicit awareness of ESG frameworks. EulerESG combines (i) dual-channel retrieval and LLM-driven disclosure analysis over ESG reports, and (ii) an interactive dashboard and chatbot for exploration, benchmarking, and explanation. Using four globally recognised companies and twelve SASB sub-industries, we show that EulerESG can automatically populate standard-aligned metric tables with high fidelity (up to 0.95 average accuracy) while remaining practical in end-to-end runtime, and we compare several recent LLM models in this setting. The full implementation, together with a demonstration video, is publicly available at https://github.com/UNSW-database/EulerESG.

*Pawel Batorski,Paul Swoboda*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GPS是一种通用、按样本提示的方法，无需任务特定调优即可为每个输入生成定制提示，在多项任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示方法存在三大局限：需要大量任务特定数据训练、依赖耗时优化循环、只能生成单一任务级提示而无法适应个体输入。需要一种更灵活高效的提示方法。

Method: 提出GPS方法：1) 使用强化学习在训练任务套件上训练提示器；2) 引入新颖的正则化技术以有效适应按样本提示；3) 采用最小贝叶斯风险解码来稳定推理。

Result: 在文本简化任务中取得第二好结果，摘要任务第三好，分类任务表现相当，且未在这些任务上进行训练。在GSM8K任务上获得最先进结果。

Conclusion: GPS展示了一种新颖有效的自动提示范式：无需大量优化和任务特定训练集，即可生成自适应、输入特定的提示，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: LLMs are sensitive to prompting, with task performance often hinging on subtle, sometimes imperceptible variations in phrasing. As a result, crafting effective prompts manually remains challenging and time-consuming. Recent automatic prompting methods mitigate this difficulty but face three key limitations: (i) for each new task, they require large datasets to train good prompts;(ii) they rely on costly optimization loops that may take hours; (iii)they typically produce a single task-level prompt that does not adapt to the individual input problem to be solved.
  We propose GPS, the first general-purpose, per-sample prompting method. Without any task-specific tuning, GPS generates a tailored prompt for each unseen input, improving performance across diverse tasks. The prompter is trained with reinforcement learning on a suite of training tasks and includes a novel regularization for effectively adapting to per-sample prompting. Finally, we employ Minimum Bayes Risk decoding to stabilize inference.
  Empirically, GPS demonstrates competitive performance: we attain second best results among baselines on text simplification, third best results on summarization and on-par results on classification, while not training on any of these tasks, in contrast to the baselines. For in-domain prompting, we obtain sota on GSM8K. Our work shows the potential of a novel and effective paradigm for automatic prompting: generating adaptive, input-specific prompts without extensive optimization and without access to a task-specific training set.

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的AI生成评论检测系统，集成文本预处理、多模态特征提取、哈里斯鹰优化特征选择和堆叠集成分类器，在4万+评论数据集上实现95.4%准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成的虚假评论威胁在线购物可信度，需要有效检测方法保护消费者权益

Method: 结合文本预处理、多模态特征提取、哈里斯鹰优化算法进行特征选择，使用堆叠集成分类器

Result: 在40,432条评论数据集上，特征维度减少89.9%，最终模型达到95.40%准确率、92.81%精确率、95.01%召回率、93.90% F1分数

Conclusion: 集成学习与生物启发优化结合是检测机器生成文本的有效方法，云平台部署需结合差分隐私和安全外包技术保护用户数据

Abstract: It is well known that fraudulent reviews cast doubt on the legitimacy and dependability of online purchases. The most recent development that leads customers towards darkness is the appearance of human reviews in computer-generated (CG) ones. In this work, we present an advanced machine-learning-based system that analyses these reviews produced by AI with remarkable precision. Our method integrates advanced text preprocessing, multi-modal feature extraction, Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) for feature selection, and a stacking ensemble classifier. We implemented this methodology on a public dataset of 40,432 Original (OR) and Computer-Generated (CG) reviews. From an initial set of 13,539 features, HHO selected the most applicable 1,368 features, achieving an 89.9% dimensionality reduction. Our final stacking model achieved 95.40% accuracy, 92.81% precision, 95.01% recall, and a 93.90% F1-Score, which demonstrates that the combination of ensemble learning and bio-inspired optimisation is an effective method for machine-generated text recognition. Because large-scale review analytics commonly run on cloud platforms, privacy-preserving techniques such as differential approaches and secure outsourcing are essential to protect user data in these systems.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CrossCheck-Bench是一个诊断性基准测试，用于评估多模态模型在检测图像-文本矛盾方面的能力，包含15k个问题-答案对，涵盖三个推理复杂度层次，揭示了现有模型在逻辑矛盾检测方面的显著性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型主要在对齐的图像-文本对上训练和评估，但真实应用中视觉和文本线索经常冲突，需要模型进行超越表面对齐的结构化推理。现有基准未能充分探索模型检测和解决真实世界不一致性的能力。

Method: 提出了CrossCheck-Bench诊断基准，采用分层任务框架覆盖三个推理复杂度层次，定义了七个解决跨模态不一致性的核心能力。数据集包含15k个问题-答案对，通过多阶段标注流程构建，涉及450多个专家小时，确保语义有效性和校准的难度分布。

Result: 评估了13个最先进的视觉语言模型，发现随着任务从感知匹配转向逻辑矛盾检测，性能一致下降。大多数模型在孤立实体识别上表现良好，但在需要综合多个线索进行冲突推理时失败。传统提示策略如思维链和标记集仅带来边际改进，而结合符号推理和视觉处理的方法获得更稳定的提升。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态推理中的持续瓶颈，表明需要新的方向来构建能够进行稳健跨模态验证的模型。现有模型在需要多步推理或基于规则验证的任务中技能获取不均衡，需要更有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are primarily trained and evaluated on aligned image-text pairs, which leaves their ability to detect and resolve real-world inconsistencies largely unexplored. In open-domain applications visual and textual cues often conflict, requiring models to perform structured reasoning beyond surface-level alignment. We introduce CrossCheck-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark for evaluating contradiction detection in multimodal inputs. The benchmark adopts a hierarchical task framework covering three levels of reasoning complexity and defines seven atomic capabilities essential for resolving cross-modal inconsistencies. CrossCheck-Bench includes 15k question-answer pairs sourced from real-world artifacts with synthetically injected contradictions. The dataset is constructed through a multi-stage annotation pipeline involving more than 450 expert hours to ensure semantic validity and calibrated difficulty across perception, integration, and reasoning. We evaluate 13 state-of-the-art vision-language models and observe a consistent performance drop as tasks shift from perceptual matching to logical contradiction detection. Most models perform well on isolated entity recognition but fail when multiple clues must be synthesized for conflict reasoning. Capability-level analysis further reveals uneven skill acquisition, especially in tasks requiring multi-step inference or rule-based validation. Additional probing shows that conventional prompting strategies such as Chain-of-Thought and Set-of-Mark yield only marginal gains. By contrast, methods that interleave symbolic reasoning with grounded visual processing achieve more stable improvements. These results highlight a persistent bottleneck in multimodal reasoning and suggest new directions for building models capable of robust cross-modal verification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MICM是一种新型的模型无关越狱方法，通过概念形态学理论编码微妙概念配置，操纵LLM的隐含社会价值观，绕过安全机制生成不当内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM安全研究主要关注显性有害输出的越狱技术，忽视了攻击者利用模型抽象泛化能力的漏洞。现有对齐策略存在盲区，使得攻击者可以通过微妙操纵模型输出中隐含的社会价值观来诱导不当内容。

Method: 基于概念形态学理论，MICM将特定微妙概念配置编码到固定提示模板中，通过预定义短语作为概念触发器，引导模型输出特定价值立场而不触发传统安全过滤器。

Result: 在GPT-4o、Deepseek-R1、Qwen3-8B等五个先进LLM上评估，MICM持续优于现有最先进越狱技术，以最小拒绝率实现高成功率。

Conclusion: 商业LLM的安全机制仍然容易受到底层价值对齐的隐蔽操纵，揭示了当前对齐策略的关键漏洞。

Abstract: Recent research on large language model (LLM) jailbreaks has primarily focused on techniques that bypass safety mechanisms to elicit overtly harmful outputs. However, such efforts often overlook attacks that exploit the model's capacity for abstract generalization, creating a critical blind spot in current alignment strategies. This gap enables adversaries to induce objectionable content by subtly manipulating the implicit social values embedded in model outputs. In this paper, we introduce MICM, a novel, model-agnostic jailbreak method that targets the aggregate value structure reflected in LLM responses. Drawing on conceptual morphology theory, MICM encodes specific configurations of nuanced concepts into a fixed prompt template through a predefined set of phrases. These phrases act as conceptual triggers, steering model outputs toward a specific value stance without triggering conventional safety filters. We evaluate MICM across five advanced LLMs, including GPT-4o, Deepseek-R1, and Qwen3-8B. Experimental results show that MICM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving high success rates with minimal rejection. Our findings reveal a critical vulnerability in commercial LLMs: their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to covert manipulation of underlying value alignment.

TL;DR: PeerCoPilot是一个基于大语言模型的助手，帮助同伴提供者创建健康计划、制定分步目标并定位组织资源，通过检索增强生成确保信息可靠性，已在真实环境中部署使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为健康问题是美国的主要疾病负担，同伴运营的行为健康组织（PROs）在帮助患者方面至关重要，但资金和人员有限，难以满足所有服务用户需求，需要工具支持同伴提供者的日常工作。

Method: 开发PeerCoPilot系统，采用检索增强生成（RAG）管道，基于包含1300多个经过审查的资源数据库，确保信息可靠性。系统帮助同伴提供者创建健康计划、制定分步目标并定位组织资源。

Result: 人类评估显示超过90%的用户支持使用PeerCoPilot，系统比基线LLM提供更可靠和具体的信息。目前已在CSPNJ（一个服务超过10,000名用户的大型行为健康组织）中由5-10名同伴提供者使用，并正在积极扩展应用。

Conclusion: PeerCoPilot是一个有效的LLM驱动助手，能够支持同伴提供者在行为健康服务中的日常工作，通过可靠的资源检索增强生成能力，在实际应用中获得了用户的高度认可。

Abstract: Behavioral health conditions, which include mental health and substance use disorders, are the leading disease burden in the United States. Peer-run behavioral health organizations (PROs) critically assist individuals facing these conditions by combining mental health services with assistance for needs such as income, employment, and housing. However, limited funds and staffing make it difficult for PROs to address all service user needs. To assist peer providers at PROs with their day-to-day tasks, we introduce PeerCoPilot, a large language model (LLM)-powered assistant that helps peer providers create wellness plans, construct step-by-step goals, and locate organizational resources to support these goals. PeerCoPilot ensures information reliability through a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline backed by a large database of over 1,300 vetted resources. We conducted human evaluations with 15 peer providers and 6 service users and found that over 90% of users supported using PeerCoPilot. Moreover, we demonstrated that PeerCoPilot provides more reliable and specific information than a baseline LLM. PeerCoPilot is now used by a group of 5-10 peer providers at CSPNJ, a large behavioral health organization serving over 10,000 service users, and we are actively expanding PeerCoPilot's use.

TL;DR: 德国通用人物（GGP）数据集：基于德国综合社会调查构建的代表性人物提示集合，用于提升LLM社会模拟的准确性和代表性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM通过人物提示模拟人类视角的方法在计算社会科学中日益流行，但缺乏经过精心策划、基于实证的人物集合，限制了模拟的准确性和代表性

Method: 基于德国综合社会调查（ALLBUS）构建德国通用人物（GGP）集合，设计易于集成到各种LLM任务中的人物提示，引导模型生成与德国人口特征一致的回答

Result: GGP引导的LLM在模拟多样化主题的调查回答分布方面优于最先进的分类器，特别是在数据稀缺情况下；分析了人物提示的代表性和属性选择对与人口回答对齐的影响

Conclusion: GGP为基于LLM的社会模拟研究提供了有价值的资源，能够更系统地探索NLP和社会科学研究中与人口对齐的人物提示方法

Abstract: The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for simulating human perspectives via persona prompting is gaining traction in computational social science. However, well-curated, empirically grounded persona collections remain scarce, limiting the accuracy and representativeness of such simulations. Here we introduce the German General Personas (GGP) collection, a comprehensive and representative persona prompt collection built from the German General Social Survey (ALLBUS). The GGP and its persona prompts are designed to be easily plugged into prompts for all types of LLMs and tasks, steering models to generate responses aligned with the underlying German population. We evaluate GGP by prompting various LLMs to simulate survey response distributions across diverse topics, demonstrating that GGP-guided LLMs outperform state-of-the-art classifiers, particularly under data scarcity. Furthermore, we analyze how the representativity and attribute selection within persona prompts affect alignment with population responses. Our findings suggest that GGP provides a potentially valuable resource for research on LLM-based social simulations that enables more systematic explorations of population-aligned persona prompting in NLP and social science research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有生物医学本体过于宽泛、无法满足特定临床试验建模需求的问题，为AD临床试验研究提供标准化、语义丰富的概念框架。

Method: 从1500多个AD临床试验中提取高频概念，分为7个语义类别，使用UMLS、OMOP等标准词汇进行标注，应用Jenks自然断点法优化概念集。

Result: 优化后的AD-CDO覆盖超过63%的试验概念，保持可解释性和紧凑性，成功应用于试验模拟系统和临床文本实体规范化任务。

Conclusion: AD-CDO通过协调关键资格实体并与标准化词汇对齐，为基于本体的AD临床试验研究提供了多功能基础，支持表型算法开发、队列识别等下游应用。

Abstract: Objective
  This study introduces the Alzheimer's Disease Common Data Element Ontology for Clinical Trials (AD-CDO), a lightweight, semantically enriched ontology designed to represent and standardize key eligibility criteria concepts in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials.
  Materials and Methods
  We extracted high-frequency concepts from more than 1,500 AD clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov and organized them into seven semantic categories: Disease, Medication, Diagnostic Test, Procedure, Social Determinants of Health, Rating Criteria, and Fertility. Each concept was annotated with standard biomedical vocabularies, including the UMLS, OMOP Standardized Vocabularies, DrugBank, NDC, and NLM VSAC value sets. To balance coverage and manageability, we applied the Jenks Natural Breaks method to identify an optimal set of representative concepts.
  Results
  The optimized AD-CDO achieved over 63% coverage of extracted trial concepts while maintaining interpretability and compactness. The ontology effectively captured the most frequent and clinically meaningful entities used in AD eligibility criteria. We demonstrated AD-CDO's practical utility through two use cases: (a) an ontology-driven trial simulation system for formal modeling and virtual execution of clinical trials, and (b) an entity normalization task mapping raw clinical text to ontology-aligned terms, enabling consistency and integration with EHR data.
  Discussion
  AD-CDO bridges the gap between broad biomedical ontologies and task-specific trial modeling needs. It supports multiple downstream applications, including phenotyping algorithm development, cohort identification, and structured data integration.
  Conclusion
  By harmonizing essential eligibility entities and aligning them with standardized vocabularies, AD-CDO provides a versatile foundation for ontology-driven AD clinical trial research.

*Yizhou Xu,Janet Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PromptTailor是一个轻量级提示优化系统，通过意图对齐的提示生成提升模型输出质量，使用量化Llama3-8B模型和LoRA适配器，在边缘设备上部署，比现有方法需要更少的模型调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轻量级语言模型在设备端和隐私敏感应用中很受欢迎，但其响应质量高度依赖提示质量。非专业用户通常缺乏知识或时间来制作高质量提示，而现有提示优化工具难以确保优化后的提示与用户原始意图和偏好保持一致。

Method: 提出PromptTailor系统，使用量化Llama3-8B模型，通过轻量级LoRA适配器在12,300个提示优化对话上进行微调，这些对话涵盖41个日常领域，从三个更强的LLM中蒸馏得到。系统可以将最小用户指令扩展为丰富、领域感知的提示，同时保持用户偏好。

Result: 在人类和LLM评估中，PromptTailor在多个目标模型和优化基线中获得了更高的偏好率，比思维链提示更好，匹配或超越了最先进的提示优化方法，同时需要更少的模型调用（例如3次 vs 9次）。

Conclusion: 紧凑的学生模型在强大教师模型的指导下，可以学习有效的提示生成策略，在保持与用户意图对齐的同时提升响应质量，为设备端提示优化提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Lightweight language models remain attractive for on-device and privacy-sensitive applications, but their responses are highly sensitive to prompt quality. For open-ended generation, non-expert users often lack the knowledge or time to consistently craft high-quality prompts, leading them to rely on prompt optimization tools. However, a key challenge is ensuring the optimized prompts genuinely align with users' original intents and preferences. We introduce PromptTailor, a system for controllable prompt generation for open-ended text that improves model output quality by intent-aligned prompt synthesis. PromptTailor expands minimal user instructions into rich, domain-aware prompts while preserving the user's stated preferences. The system is a quantized Llama3-8B model fine-tuned with a lightweight LoRA adapter on 12,300 prompt-refinement dialogues spanning 41 everyday domains, distilled from three stronger LLMs. The adapter attaches to any Llama3-8B base, enabling edge deployment. In human and LLM-judge evaluations across multiple target models and optimization baselines, PromptTailor yields higher preference rates than chain-of-thought prompting and matches or surpasses state-of-the-art prompt optimization methods while requiring fewer model calls (e.g., 3 vs. 9). These results show that a compact student, guided by powerful teachers, can learn effective prompt-generation strategies that enhance response quality while maintaining alignment with user intent.

TL;DR: SUMER提出了一种基于强化学习的搜索方法，在未压缩的原始数据中进行目标导向搜索，优于现有的有偏记忆压缩算法，在长上下文对话理解任务上取得了43%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型记忆框架和基准测试主要关注寻找最优的记忆压缩算法，但这往往在压缩算法中引入了人类偏见，且预定义的压缩算法无法适应所有原始数据分布。目标导向的未压缩信息搜索可能表现出更优性能，因为压缩是有损的。

Method: 提出了SUMER（Search in Uncompressed Memory via Experience Replay），这是一个端到端的强化学习智能体，具有可验证奖励（RLVR）。它学习使用搜索工具来收集信息并回答目标问题，在原始未压缩数据中进行目标导向搜索。

Result: 在LoCoMo长上下文对话理解数据集上，SUMER使用Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct模型学习使用搜索工具，超越了所有其他有偏记忆压缩方法和完整上下文基线，达到了最先进的性能，相比之前最佳方法有43%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 简单的搜索方法应用于原始数据优于当前长上下文记忆任务中的目标无关和有偏压缩算法，这为更动态和自主可扩展的新范式与基准测试提供了论据。

Abstract: How to enable human-like long-term memory in large language models (LLMs) has been a central question for unlocking more general capabilities such as few-shot generalization. Existing memory frameworks and benchmarks focus on finding the optimal memory compression algorithm for higher performance in tasks that require recollection and sometimes further reasoning. However, such efforts have ended up building more human bias into the compression algorithm, through the search for the best prompts and memory architectures that suit specific benchmarks, rather than finding a general solution that would work on other data distributions. On the other hand, goal-directed search on uncompressed information could potentially exhibit superior performance because compression is lossy, and a predefined compression algorithm will not fit all raw data distributions. Here we present SUMER (Search in Uncompressed Memory via Experience Replay), an end-to-end reinforcement learning agent with verifiable reward (RLVR) that learns to use search tools to gather information and answer a target question. On the LoCoMo dataset for long-context conversation understanding, SUMER with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct learned to use search tools and outperformed all other biased memory compression approaches and also the full-context baseline, reaching SOTA performance (43% gain over the prior best). We demonstrate that a simple search method applied to raw data outperforms goal-agnostic and biased compression algorithms in current long-context memory tasks, arguing for new paradigms and benchmarks that are more dynamic and autonomously scalable. Code for SUMER and all implemented baselines is publicly available at https://github.com/zycyc/SUMER.

TL;DR: 提出AffectMind多模态情感对话代理，通过主动推理和动态知识基础，在营销对话中实现情感对齐和说服性交互


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型对话系统多为被动反应型，在情感丰富、目标导向的营销对话场景中表现不足，需要能主动推理并适应情感变化的对话代理

Method: 结合三个核心组件：主动知识基础网络（PKGN）从文本、视觉和韵律更新事实与情感上下文；情感-意图对齐模型（EIAM）联合建模用户情感和购买意图以调整说服策略；强化话语循环（RDL）通过用户反馈优化情感连贯性和参与度

Result: 在两个新构建的营销对话数据集上，AffectMind在情感一致性（+26%）、说服成功率（+19%）和长期用户参与度（+23%）方面显著优于基于LLM的基线模型

Conclusion: 情感基础的主动性是商业多模态代理的关键能力，AffectMind为情感丰富的目标导向对话提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled fluent dialogue systems, but most remain reactive and struggle in emotionally rich, goal-oriented settings such as marketing conversations. To address this limitation, we propose AffectMind, a multimodal affective dialogue agent that performs proactive reasoning and dynamic knowledge grounding to sustain emotionally aligned and persuasive interactions. AffectMind combines three components: a Proactive Knowledge Grounding Network (PKGN) that continuously updates factual and affective context from text, vision, and prosody; an Emotion--Intent Alignment Model (EIAM) that jointly models user emotion and purchase intent to adapt persuasion strategies; and a Reinforced Discourse Loop (RDL) that optimizes emotional coherence and engagement via reinforcement signals from user responses. Experiments on two newly curated marketing dialogue datasets, MM-ConvMarket and AffectPromo, show that AffectMind outperforms strong LLM-based baselines in emotional consistency (+26\%), persuasive success rate (+19\%), and long-term user engagement (+23\%), highlighting emotion-grounded proactivity as a key capability for commercial multimodal agents.

TL;DR: RAG系统性能提升关键在于组件协同而非单个组件强度，集成策略可大幅减少弃答率而不增加幻觉


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统研究多关注单个组件优化，但缺乏对组件间协同作用的深入理解，且存在评估指标不一致的问题

Method: 使用50个查询（15个可回答、10个边缘案例、25个对抗性）进行消融研究，分析混合检索、集成验证和自适应阈值等增强策略的协同效应

Result: 单独使用增强策略几乎无益，但集成使用时可将弃答率从40%降至2%（减少95%），且不增加幻觉；发现验证策略标签不一致导致幻觉率测量偏差

Conclusion: RAG系统成功关键在于组件协同整合而非单个组件强度，需要标准化评估指标和标签，以及自适应校准防止过度自信回答

Abstract: Building reliable retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems requires more than adding powerful components; it requires understanding how they interact. Using ablation studies on 50 queries (15 answerable, 10 edge cases, and 25 adversarial), we show that enhancements such as hybrid retrieval, ensemble verification, and adaptive thresholding provide almost no benefit when used in isolation, yet together achieve a 95% reduction in abstention (from 40% to 2%) without increasing hallucinations. We also identify a measurement challenge: different verification strategies can behave safely but assign inconsistent labels (for example, "abstained" versus "unsupported"), creating apparent hallucination rates that are actually artifacts of labeling. Our results show that synergistic integration matters more than the strength of any single component, that standardized metrics and labels are essential for correctly interpreting performance, and that adaptive calibration is needed to prevent overconfident over-answering even when retrieval quality is high.

TL;DR: 论文提出了首个分离程序记忆检索与任务执行的基准测试，评估AI代理在不同对象实例化中识别功能等价程序的能力，发现嵌入方法在熟悉场景表现好但在新场景急剧退化，而LLM生成程序抽象能可靠跨上下文迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI代理在熟悉环境中表现优异，但在面对包含未见词汇的新任务时急剧失败，这是程序记忆系统的核心限制。需要评估代理是否能识别跨越不同对象实例化的功能等价程序。

Method: 使用ALFWorld构建专家和LLM生成轨迹的双语料库，评估六种检索方法，使用系统分层查询。通过控制消融实验分析嵌入方法局限。

Result: 发现明显的泛化悬崖：嵌入方法在熟悉上下文表现强，但在新上下文显著退化；LLM生成程序抽象展示可靠的跨上下文迁移。嵌入方法将程序视为无序词袋，丢弃了跨上下文迁移所需的时间结构。

Conclusion: 该基准提供了首个诊断框架，分离真正的程序理解与表面记忆，为开发能够可靠泛化的检索系统提供工具。语料规模比表示丰富带来更大收益，揭示了当前编码器的架构上限。

Abstract: Current AI agents excel in familiar settings, but fail sharply when faced with novel tasks with unseen vocabularies -- a core limitation of procedural memory systems. We present the first benchmark that isolates procedural memory retrieval from task execution, evaluating whether agents can recognize functionally equivalent procedures that span different object instantiations. Using ALFWorld, we construct dual corpora of expert and LLM-generated trajectories and evaluate six retrieval methods using systematically stratified queries. Our results expose a clear generalization cliff: embedding-based methods perform strongly on familiar contexts, yet degrade considerably on novel ones, while LLM-generated procedural abstractions demonstrate reliable cross-context transfer. Controlled ablations show that although embeddings capture some lexical-level abstraction, they fundamentally treat procedures as unordered bags of words, discarding temporal structure necessary for cross-context transfer. Corpus scale delivers far larger gains than representation enrichment, revealing an architectural ceiling in current encoders. Our benchmark offers the first diagnostic framework separating genuine procedural understanding from surface-level memorization and gives tools for developing retrieval systems capable of dependable generalization.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型在概念认知测试中是否表现出与人类相似的量子结构特征，验证量子认知理论在人工智能领域的适用性

Method: 使用ChatGPT和Gemini进行两项认知测试：1) 概念组合测试中检测贝尔不等式违反，证明量子纠缠存在；2) 分析大型文本中词语分布，识别统计特征

Result: LLMs在概念测试中显著违反贝尔不等式，表现出量子纠缠特征；词语分布呈现玻色-爱因斯坦统计而非预期的麦克斯韦-玻尔兹曼统计，与人类认知实验结果一致

Conclusion: 概念-语言领域存在系统性量子结构，这种结构在人类认知和LLMs中均出现，表明语义向量空间的分布式结构是知识组织的本质形式，实现了进化趋同

Abstract: We present the results of cognitive tests on conceptual combinations, performed using specific Large Language Models (LLMs) as test subjects. In the first test, performed with ChatGPT and Gemini, we show that Bell's inequalities are significantly violated, which indicates the presence of 'quantum entanglement' in the tested concepts. In the second test, also performed using ChatGPT and Gemini, we instead identify the presence of 'Bose-Einstein statistics', rather than the intuitively expected 'Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics', in the distribution of the words contained in large-size texts. Interestingly, these findings mirror the results previously obtained in both cognitive tests with human participants and information retrieval tests on large corpora. Taken together, they point to the 'systematic emergence of quantum structures in conceptual-linguistic domains', regardless of whether the cognitive agent is human or artificial. Although LLMs are classified as neural networks for historical reasons, we believe that a more essential form of knowledge organization takes place in the distributive semantic structure of vector spaces built on top of the neural network. It is this meaning-bearing structure that lends itself to a phenomenon of evolutionary convergence between human cognition and language, slowly established through biological evolution, and LLM cognition and language, emerging much more rapidly as a result of self-learning and training. We analyze various aspects and examples that contain evidence supporting the above hypothesis. We also advance a unifying framework that explains the pervasive quantum organization of meaning that we identify.

TL;DR: HUMORCHAIN：首个将幽默认知理论嵌入多模态幽默生成的框架，通过多阶段推理链提升AI生成幽默的质量和人类偏好


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI幽默生成方法缺乏理论指导，仅产生流畅但缺乏真正幽默和认知深度的描述。多模态幽默（特别是Gen Z在线交流）需要AI整合视觉理解和幽默语言生成，但现有数据驱动方法未能显式建模幽默的认知机制。

Method: 提出HUMORCHAIN框架：整合视觉语义解析、基于幽默和心理学的推理、以及微调的幽默评估判别器，形成可解释可控的认知推理链。首次将幽默理论的认知结构显式嵌入多模态幽默生成。

Result: 在Meme-Image-No-Text、Oogiri-GO和OxfordTVG-HIC数据集上，HUMORCHAIN在人类幽默偏好、Elo/BT分数和语义多样性方面优于最先进基线，证明理论驱动的结构化推理能使大语言模型生成符合人类感知的幽默。

Conclusion: 通过将幽默认知理论嵌入多阶段推理框架，AI能够生成更符合人类感知的幽默内容，为多模态幽默生成提供了理论指导和结构化方法。

Abstract: Humor, as both a creative human activity and a social binding mechanism, has long posed a major challenge for AI generation. Although producing humor requires complex cognitive reasoning and social understanding, theories of humor suggest that it follows learnable patterns and structures, making it theoretically possible for generative models to acquire them implicitly. In recent years, multimodal humor has become a prevalent form of online communication, especially among Gen Z, highlighting the need for AI systems capable of integrating visual understanding with humorous language generation. However, existing data-driven approaches lack explicit modeling or theoretical grounding of humor, often producing literal descriptions that fail to capture its underlying cognitive mechanisms, resulting in the generated image descriptions that are fluent but lack genuine humor or cognitive depth. To address this limitation, we propose HUMORCHAIN (HUmor-guided Multi-step Orchestrated Reasoning Chain for Image Captioning), a theory-guided multi-stage reasoning framework. It integrates visual semantic parsing, humor- and psychology-based reasoning, and a fine-tuned discriminator for humor evaluation, forming an interpretable and controllable cognitive reasoning chain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly embed cognitive structures from humor theories into multimodal humor generation, enabling a structured reasoning process from visual understanding to humor creation. Experiments on Meme-Image-No-Text, Oogiri-GO, and OxfordTVG-HIC datasets show that HUMORCHAIN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in human humor preference, Elo/BT scores, and semantic diversity, demonstrating that theory-driven structured reasoning enables large language models to generate humor aligned with human perception.

TL;DR: RoSA是一种新型参数高效微调方法，通过RoPE感知的注意力增强和动态层选择，在低维度和关键层进行针对性参数更新，显著提升微调效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法通常忽略模型组件的不同角色和各层的异质性重要性，限制了适应效率。研究发现RoPE在注意力状态的低频维度诱导关键激活，这启发了更针对性的参数分配策略。

Method: RoSA包含两个核心组件：1) RoPE感知注意力增强模块，选择性增强RoPE影响的注意力状态的低频分量；2) 动态层选择策略，基于LayerNorm梯度范数自适应识别和更新最关键层。

Result: 在15个常识和算术基准测试上的实验表明，RoSA在可训练参数相当的情况下，优于现有主流PEFT方法。

Conclusion: RoSA通过维度增强和层适应相结合，实现了更针对性和高效的微调，为参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models is essential for task-specific adaptation, yet it remains computationally prohibitive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a solution, but current approaches typically ignore the distinct roles of model components and the heterogeneous importance across layers, thereby limiting adaptation efficiency. Motivated by the observation that Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE) induce critical activations in the low-frequency dimensions of attention states, we propose RoPE-aware Selective Adaptation (RoSA), a novel PEFT framework that allocates trainable parameters in a more targeted and effective manner. RoSA comprises a RoPE-aware Attention Enhancement (RoAE) module, which selectively enhances the low-frequency components of RoPE-influenced attention states, and a Dynamic Layer Selection (DLS) strategy that adaptively identifies and updates the most critical layers based on LayerNorm gradient norms. By combining dimension-wise enhancement with layer-wise adaptation, RoSA achieves more targeted and efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on fifteen commonsense and arithmetic benchmarks demonstrate that RoSA outperforms existing mainstream PEFT methods under comparable trainable parameters. The code is available to ease reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/RoSA.

*Shiguang Wu,Quanming Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VF策略通过先验证候选答案（即使是随机答案）来触发反向推理，比传统CoT效果更好且计算成本低；Iter-VF通过迭代验证-生成循环进一步提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在不增加训练成本或大量测试时间采样的前提下，提升大语言模型的推理能力。传统CoT是正向推理，存在逻辑错误，需要更有效的推理策略。

Method: 提出Verification-First策略：让模型先验证一个候选答案（即使是随机或平凡的答案），触发反向推理过程。进一步扩展为Iter-VF：迭代执行验证-生成循环，使用模型前一轮的答案作为新的候选答案进行验证。

Result: 在多种基准测试（数学推理、编程、智能体任务）和多种LLM（从1B开源模型到前沿商业模型）上，VF策略始终优于标准CoT，且计算开销最小；Iter-VF优于现有的测试时扩展策略。

Conclusion: 验证优先策略通过触发反向推理过程，有效提升了LLM的推理能力，为低成本提升模型性能提供了新方向。

Abstract: To enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) without high costs of training, nor extensive test-time sampling, we introduce Verification-First (VF), a strategy that prompts models to verify a provided candidate answer, even a trivial or random one, before generating a solution. This approach triggers a "reverse reasoning" process that is cognitively easier and complementary to standard forward Chain-of-Thought (CoT), effectively invoking the model's critical thinking to reduce logical errors. We further generalize the VF strategy to Iter-VF, a sequential test-time scaling (TTS) method that iteratively cycles the verification-generation process using the model's previous answer. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks (from mathematical reasoning to coding and agentic tasks) and various LLMs (from open-source 1B to cutting-edge commercial ones) confirm that VF with random answer consistently outperforms standard CoT with minimal computational overhead, and Iter-VF outperforms existing TTS strategies.

TL;DR: MAIRA-X是一个多模态AI模型，用于胸部X光报告的自动生成，涵盖临床发现和管路设备报告，在多个数据集上表现优于现有技术，用户研究表明其生成的报告质量接近放射科医生水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射科医生面临工作量增加、复杂病例增多和人员短缺的挑战，特别是胸部X光报告中描述病理发现和解释管路设备（L&T）的工作重复且耗时。AI辅助报告生成有望减轻放射科医生负担，同时保持诊断准确性。

Method: 开发了MAIRA-X多模态AI模型，使用Mayo Clinic的大规模、多中心、纵向数据集（310万研究，600万图像，80.6万患者）。评估了三个保留数据集和公开的MIMIC-CXR数据集，开发了专门的L&T评估指标框架，并进行了首次回顾性用户评估研究，由9名不同经验的放射科医生盲审600个研究。

Result: MAIRA-X在词汇质量、临床正确性和L&T相关元素方面显著优于现有技术。用户研究发现关键错误率相近（原始报告3.0% vs AI报告4.6%），可接受句子率相似（97.8% vs 97.4%），相比先前研究有显著改进。

Conclusion: MAIRA-X能有效辅助放射科医生，特别是在高容量临床环境中，其生成的报告质量接近放射科医生水平，表明AI辅助报告生成在实际临床应用中具有可行性。

Abstract: AI-assisted report generation offers the opportunity to reduce radiologists' workload stemming from expanded screening guidelines, complex cases and workforce shortages, while maintaining diagnostic accuracy. In addition to describing pathological findings in chest X-ray reports, interpreting lines and tubes (L&T) is demanding and repetitive for radiologists, especially with high patient volumes. We introduce MAIRA-X, a clinically evaluated multimodal AI model for longitudinal chest X-ray (CXR) report generation, that encompasses both clinical findings and L&T reporting. Developed using a large-scale, multi-site, longitudinal dataset of 3.1 million studies (comprising 6 million images from 806k patients) from Mayo Clinic, MAIRA-X was evaluated on three holdout datasets and the public MIMIC-CXR dataset, where it significantly improved AI-generated reports over the state of the art on lexical quality, clinical correctness, and L&T-related elements. A novel L&T-specific metrics framework was developed to assess accuracy in reporting attributes such as type, longitudinal change and placement. A first-of-its-kind retrospective user evaluation study was conducted with nine radiologists of varying experience, who blindly reviewed 600 studies from distinct subjects. The user study found comparable rates of critical errors (3.0% for original vs. 4.6% for AI-generated reports) and a similar rate of acceptable sentences (97.8% for original vs. 97.4% for AI-generated reports), marking a significant improvement over prior user studies with larger gaps and higher error rates. Our results suggest that MAIRA-X can effectively assist radiologists, particularly in high-volume clinical settings.

TL;DR: R2Q是一种创新的2位量化框架，通过将2位量化分解为两个顺序的1位子量化，形成自适应量化网格，显著提升了2位量化的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的计算和内存需求巨大，低比特量化成为重要解决方案。虽然8位和4位量化已普遍应用，但扩展到2位量化面临严重的精度损失挑战。

Method: 提出残差精化量化(R2Q)框架，将2位量化过程分解为两个顺序的1位子量化，形成自适应量化网格。通过残差学习机制精化量化过程，模块化设计可与现有量化感知训练框架无缝集成。

Result: 在Llama、OPT和Qwen模型上的广泛评估显示，R2Q在细粒度和粗粒度设置下均优于现有2位量化方法，涵盖问答、常识推理和语言建模等多种基准测试。

Conclusion: R2Q通过残差学习机制提升了性能、改善了训练稳定性、加速了收敛速度，在极端压缩下表现出色，为2位量化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought substantial computational and memory demands, spurring the adoption of low-bit quantization. While 8-bit and 4-bit formats have become prevalent, extending quantization to 2 bits remains challenging due to severe accuracy degradation. To address this, we propose Residual Refinement Quantization (R2Q)-a novel 2-bit quantization framework that decomposes the process into two sequential 1-bit sub-quantizations, forming an adaptive quantization lattice. Extensive evaluations on Llama, OPT, and Qwen across diverse benchmarks-covering question answering, commonsense reasoning, and language modeling-demonstrate that R2Q consistently outperforms existing 2-bit quantization methods in both fine-grained and coarse-grained settings. By refining quantization through a residual learning mechanism, R2Q enhances performance, improves training stability, and accelerates convergence under extreme compression. Furthermore, its modular design enables seamless integration with existing quantization-aware training (QAT) frameworks.

TL;DR: PA-CCS：一种通过极性反转一致性评估模型内部表征对齐性的无监督探测方法，可识别潜在有害知识编码的架构和层级差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督探测方法（如CCS）能否可靠评估模型对齐性？需要验证这些方法对有害/安全陈述的敏感性，并开发能评估模型内部表征在极性反转下一致性的方法

Method: 提出极性感知CCS（PA-CCS），引入极性一致性和矛盾指数两个对齐指标，构建三个数据集（两个主要数据集+一个对照集），包含使用不同方法构建的匹配有害-安全句子对，应用于16个语言模型

Result: PA-CCS能识别潜在有害知识编码的架构和层级差异；对于内部表征对齐良好的模型，用无意义标记替换否定词会降低PA-CCS分数，而缺乏稳健内部校准的模型则无此现象

Conclusion: 无监督探测在模型对齐评估中具有潜力，但需要将结构稳健性检查纳入可解释性基准，PA-CCS为评估模型内部表征一致性提供了有效方法

Abstract: Advances in unsupervised probes such as Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS), which reveal latent beliefs without relying on token outputs, raise the question of whether these methods can reliably assess model alignment. We investigate this by examining the sensitivity of CCS to harmful vs. safe statements and by introducing Polarity-Aware CCS (PA-CCS), a method for evaluating whether a model's internal representations remain consistent under polarity inversion. We propose two alignment-oriented metrics, Polar-Consistency and the Contradiction Index, to quantify the semantic robustness of a model's latent knowledge. To validate PA-CCS, we curate two main datasets and one control dataset containing matched harmful-safe sentence pairs constructed using different methodologies (concurrent and antagonistic statements). We apply PA-CCS to 16 language models. Our results show that PA-CCS identifies both architectural and layer-specific differences in the encoding of latent harmful knowledge. Notably, replacing the negation token with a meaningless marker degrades PA-CCS scores for models with well-aligned internal representations, while models lacking robust internal calibration do not exhibit this degradation. Our findings highlight the potential of unsupervised probing for alignment evaluation and emphasize the need to incorporate structural robustness checks into interpretability benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音脑机接口多采用级联框架（先解码音素再用语言模型组句），无法实现所有阶段的联合优化，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出端到端Brain-to-Text框架：1) 跨任务跨物种预训练神经编码器，可迁移到尝试和想象语音；2) 与音频大语言模型集成端到端训练；3) 使用对比学习进行跨模态对齐。

Result: 1) 在级联设置中，预训练编码器在Brain-to-Text '24和'25基准测试中达到新SOTA；2) 端到端集成将词错误率从24.69%降至10.22%；3) 发现小规模音频LLM显著改善端到端解码；4) 实现了尝试和想象语音嵌入的对齐与跨任务泛化。

Conclusion: BIT框架推进了大规模多样化神经数据集的整合，为实现支持无缝可微优化的端到端解码框架铺平了道路。

Abstract: Speech brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) aim to restore communication for people with paralysis by translating neural activity into text. Most systems use cascaded frameworks that decode phonemes before assembling sentences with an n-gram language model (LM), preventing joint optimization of all stages simultaneously. Here, we introduce an end-to-end Brain-to-Text (BIT) framework that translates neural activity into coherent sentences using a single differentiable neural network. Central to our approach is a cross-task, cross-species pretrained neural encoder, whose representations transfer to both attempted and imagined speech. In a cascaded setting with an n-gram LM, the pretrained encoder establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on the Brain-to-Text '24 and '25 benchmarks. Integrated end-to-end with audio large language models (LLMs) and trained with contrastive learning for cross-modal alignment, BIT reduces the word error rate (WER) of the prior end-to-end method from 24.69% to 10.22%. Notably, we find that small-scale audio LLMs markedly improve end-to-end decoding. Beyond record-setting performance, BIT aligns attempted and imagined speech embeddings to enable cross-task generalization. Altogether, our approach advances the integration of large, diverse neural datasets, paving the way for an end-to-end decoding framework that supports seamless, differentiable optimization.

Motivation: 现有基于密集Transformer嵌入的模型难以捕捉科学文献中的罕见主题，导致无法实现平滑的时间对齐，需要开发能够识别被忽视的利基主题并追踪研究兴趣演化的方法

Method: 整合多模态文本和合著网络数据，使用Hellinger距离和Ward连接构建层次主题树状图，支持语义和时间维度的多尺度学习，捕捉局部和全局结构

Result: 该方法有效识别罕见主题结构，可视化主题随时间平滑漂移，实验表明可解释的词袋模型与原则性几何对齐结合具有优势

Conclusion: 几何方法结合多模态数据和层次结构能更好地捕捉科学文献中的罕见主题和演化模式，为可解释主题建模提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Interpretable topic modeling is essential for tracking how research interests evolve within co-author communities. In scientific corpora, where novelty is prized, identifying underrepresented niche topics is particularly important. However, contemporary models built from dense transformer embeddings tend to miss rare topics and therefore also fail to capture smooth temporal alignment. We propose a geometric method that integrates multimodal text and co-author network data, using Hellinger distances and Ward's linkage to construct a hierarchical topic dendrogram. This approach captures both local and global structure, supporting multiscale learning across semantic and temporal dimensions. Our method effectively identifies rare-topic structure and visualizes smooth topic drift over time. Experiments highlight the strength of interpretable bag-of-words models when paired with principled geometric alignment.

Abstract: With the growing use of Large Language Model (LLM)-based Question-Answering (QA) systems in education, it is critical to evaluate their performance across individual pipeline components. In this work, we introduce {\model}, a modular function-calling LLM pipeline, and present a comprehensive evaluation along three key axes: function calling strategies, retrieval methods, and generative language models. Our framework enables fine-grained analysis by isolating and assessing each component. We benchmark function-calling performance across LLMs, compare our novel structure-aware retrieval method to vector-based and LLM-scoring baselines, and evaluate various LLMs for response synthesis. This modular approach reveals specific failure modes and performance patterns, supporting the development of interpretable and effective educational QA systems. Our findings demonstrate the value of modular function calling in improving system transparency and pedagogical alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在任务微调过程中的推理行为，借鉴认知科学的"能力四阶段"理论，分析推理token与人类工作记忆的相似性，探索推理在模型学习中的作用和动态变化。

Method: 将认知科学的"能力四阶段"理论（无意识无能、有意识无能、有意识能力、无意识能力）应用于语言模型训练动态分析，通过跟踪推理token长度变化来观察模型学习过程。

Result: 发现推理token长度随性能提升而增加，在"有意识能力"阶段达到峰值，随后下降；训练完成后模型即使移除推理token仍能保持性能，表明推理在训练中起脚手架作用但非必需。

Conclusion: 推理token动态可作为训练阶段诊断、收敛识别和早停指导的信号，推理行为对理解和优化推理模型训练具有重要价值，提出了跟踪这一轨迹的度量方法。

Abstract: We analyze reasoning in language models during task-specific fine-tuning and draws parallel between reasoning tokens--intermediate steps generated while solving problem and the human working memory. Drawing from cognitive science, we align training dynamics with the Four Stages of Competence: models initially produce incorrect outputs without reasoning, then begin reasoning (but still fail), eventually reason effectively, and finally solve tasks without explicit reasoning. We find that reasoning token length expands as performance improves, peaks at the stage of conscious competence, then declines as the model internalizes the task. Notably, after training, models retain performance even when reasoning is removed--suggesting it scaffolded learning but is no longer needed. This progression offers actionable insights: reasoning token dynamics can serve as a signal for diagnosing training stage, identifying convergence, and guiding early stopping. We propose metrics to track this trajectory and argue that reasoning behavior is valuable for understanding and optimizing reasoning model training.

Motivation: 现有AI生成文本检测方法依赖大型Transformer模型或集成模型，计算成本高且跨领域泛化能力有限；轻量级替代方案在大数据集上准确率显著较低

Method: 将文本分解为风格计量和可读性特征，然后使用紧凑的卷积神经网络（CNN）或随机森林（RF）进行分类

Result: 在Kaggle AI vs. Human语料库上，CNN模型达到97%准确率（F1约0.95），随机森林达到95%准确率（F1约0.94）；ROC-AUC分别为99.5%和95%；模型大小仅25MB和10.6MB

Conclusion: NEULIF在轻量级检测器中表现最佳，无需大量计算资源且保持高检测准确率；研究表明基于结构洞察的简单方法在AI生成内容检测中可与复杂方法相媲美，具有跨语言、跨领域和流式应用的潜力

Abstract: A growing number of AI-generated texts raise serious concerns. Most existing approaches to AI-generated text detection rely on fine-tuning large transformer models or building ensembles, which are computationally expensive and often provide limited generalization across domains. Existing lightweight alternatives achieved significantly lower accuracy on large datasets. We introduce NEULIF, a lightweight approach that achieves best performance in the lightweight detector class, that does not require extensive computational power and provides high detection accuracy. In our approach, a text is first decomposed into stylometric and readability features which are then used for classification by a compact Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Random Forest (RF). Evaluated and tested on the Kaggle AI vs. Human corpus, our models achieve 97% accuracy (~ 0.95 F1) for CNN and 95% accuracy (~ 0.94 F1) for the Random Forest, demonstrating high precision and recall, with ROC-AUC scores of 99.5% and 95%, respectively. The CNN (~ 25 MB) and Random Forest (~ 10.6 MB) models are orders of magnitude smaller than transformer-based ensembles and can be run efficiently on standard CPU devices, without sacrificing accuracy.This study also highlights the potential of such models for broader applications across languages, domains, and streaming contexts, showing that simplicity, when guided by structural insights, can rival complexity in AI-generated content detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG到文本转换面临高维噪声、主体变异性以及自回归解码中的误差累积等挑战，需要更鲁棒的方法来从脑电信号中可靠生成文本。

Method: 1. 残差向量量化(RVQ)EEG分词器：将连续EEG信号离散化为多层token，减少噪声和个体差异
2. 掩码语言扩散模型(LLaDA)：通过非顺序去噪过程重建句子，避免自回归解码的误差累积

Conclusion: DELTA通过结合RVQ和扩散模型，有效解决了EEG到文本转换的关键挑战，为实现可扩展的多模态EEG-语言模型指明了方向。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-to-text remains challenging due to high-dimensional noise, subject variability, and error accumulation in autoregressive decoding. We introduce DELTA, which pairs a Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) EEG tokenizer with a masked language diffusion model (LLaDA). RVQ discretizes continuous EEG into multi-layer tokens to reduce noise and individual differences, while LLaDA reconstructs sentences via non-sequential denoising. On ZuCo, DELTA improves semantic alignment by up to 5.37 points over autoregressive baselines, achieving BLEU-1 21.9 and ROUGE-1 F 17.2 under word-level conditions. These results enable reliable text generation from small EEG-text datasets and point toward scalable multimodal EEG-language models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in supporting a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. In specialized domains, there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs to assist subject matter experts with domain-specific challenges. However, deploying LLMs as SaaS solutions raises data privacy concerns, while many open-source models demand significant computational resources for effective domain adaptation and deployment. A promising alternative is to develop smaller, domain-specialized LLMs, though this approach is often constrained by the lack of high-quality domain-specific training data. In this work, we address these limitations by presenting a cost-efficient and scalable training pipeline that combines guided synthetic data generation from a small seed corpus with bottom-up domain data curation. Our pipeline integrates Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT), Domain-specific Supervised Fine-tuning (DSFT), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train effective small-scale models for specialized use cases. We demonstrate this approach through DiagnosticSLM, a 3B-parameter domain-specific model tailored for fault diagnosis, root cause analysis, and repair recommendation in industrial settings. To evaluate model performance, we introduce four domain-specific benchmarks: multiple-choice questions (DiagnosticMCQ), question answering (DiagnosticQA), sentence completion (DiagnosticComp), and summarization (DiagnosticSum). DiagnosticSLM achieves up to 25% accuracy improvement over open-source models of comparable or larger size (2B-9B) on the MCQ task, while also outperforming or matching them in other tasks, demonstrating effective domain-specific reasoning and generalization capabilities.

TL;DR: BRIES是一个用于检测和评估信息环境中说服攻击效果的复合AI架构，包含生成攻击内容、检测攻击类型、创建防御内容和评估防御效果四个专门代理，揭示了不同语言模型在检测说服攻击方面的显著性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI安全面临说服攻击的威胁，需要量化语言模型对说服攻击的特定脆弱性，并建立增强人类认知韧性的框架，以在接触有害内容前进行结构化干预。

Method: 提出BRIES复合AI架构，包含四个专门代理：Twister（生成对抗性内容）、Detector（识别攻击类型）、Defender（创建韧性内容）、Assessor（评估防御效果）。使用SemEval 2023 Task 3分类法在合成说服数据集上进行实验，分析不同语言模型（GPT-4、Llama3、Mistral、Gemma）的检测性能，并研究提示工程和温度设置的影响。

Result: 不同语言模型在检测说服攻击方面存在显著性能差异：GPT-4在复杂说服技术上表现最优，而开源模型（Llama3、Mistral）在识别微妙修辞方面存在明显弱点。提示工程显著影响检测效果，不同模型对温度设置有特定偏好。因果分析揭示了说服攻击的社会-情感-认知特征，不同攻击类型针对特定认知维度。

Conclusion: 该研究通过量化语言模型对说服攻击的特定脆弱性，推进了生成式AI安全和认知安全，提供了通过结构化干预增强人类认知韧性的框架，揭示了不同架构以根本不同的方式编码和处理说服性语言模式。

Abstract: This paper introduces BRIES, a novel compound AI architecture designed to detect and measure the effectiveness of persuasion attacks across information environments. We present a system with specialized agents: a Twister that generates adversarial content employing targeted persuasion tactics, a Detector that identifies attack types with configurable parameters, a Defender that creates resilient content through content inoculation, and an Assessor that employs causal inference to evaluate inoculation effectiveness. Experimenting with the SemEval 2023 Task 3 taxonomy across the synthetic persuasion dataset, we demonstrate significant variations in detection performance across language agents. Our comparative analysis reveals significant performance disparities with GPT-4 achieving superior detection accuracy on complex persuasion techniques, while open-source models like Llama3 and Mistral demonstrated notable weaknesses in identifying subtle rhetorical, suggesting that different architectures encode and process persuasive language patterns in fundamentally different ways. We show that prompt engineering dramatically affects detection efficacy, with temperature settings and confidence scoring producing model-specific variations; Gemma and GPT-4 perform optimally at lower temperatures while Llama3 and Mistral show improved capabilities at higher temperatures. Our causal analysis provides novel insights into socio-emotional-cognitive signatures of persuasion attacks, revealing that different attack types target specific cognitive dimensions. This research advances generative AI safety and cognitive security by quantifying LLM-specific vulnerabilities to persuasion attacks and delivers a framework for enhancing human cognitive resilience through structured interventions before exposure to harmful content.

*Yanxi Li,Ruocheng Shan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Label Disguise Defense(LDD)防御方法，通过将真实标签替换为语义转换或无关的别名标签来抵御提示注入攻击，无需模型重训练且模型无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本分类任务中广泛使用，但依赖自然语言提示使其易受提示注入攻击，特别是类别指令注入攻击。现有防御方法要么需要模型重训练，要么仍易受混淆攻击。

Method: 提出Label Disguise Defense(LDD)方法：1)隐藏真实标签，用语义转换或无关的别名标签替代；2)通过少量样本演示让模型隐式学习新标签映射；3)防止注入指令与决策输出直接对应。

Result: 在9个最先进模型(GPT-5、GPT-4o、LLaMA3.2、Gemma3、Mistral变体等)上评估：1)LDD能恢复部分因攻击损失的准确率；2)多数模型能找到多个别名对，性能优于无防御基线；3)语义对齐的别名标签(如good vs bad)比未对齐符号(如blue vs yellow)更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 标签语义可作为有效的防御层，将意义本身转化为抵御提示注入的盾牌。LDD是轻量级、模型无关的防御策略，无需模型重训练。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly used for text classification tasks such as sentiment analysis, yet their reliance on natural language prompts exposes them to prompt injection attacks. In particular, class-directive injections exploit knowledge of the model's label set (e.g., positive vs. negative) to override its intended behavior through adversarial instructions. Existing defenses, such as detection-based filters, instruction hierarchies, and signed prompts, either require model retraining or remain vulnerable to obfuscation. This paper introduces Label Disguise Defense (LDD), a lightweight and model-agnostic strategy that conceals true labels by replacing them with semantically transformed or unrelated alias labels(e.g., blue vs. yellow). The model learns these new label mappings implicitly through few-shot demonstrations, preventing direct correspondence between injected directives and decision outputs. We evaluate LDD across nine state-of-the-art models, including GPT-5, GPT-4o, LLaMA3.2, Gemma3, and Mistral variants, under varying few-shot and an adversarial setting. Our results show that the ability of LDD to recover performance lost to the adversarial attack varies across models and alias choices. For every model evaluated, LDD is able to restore a portion of the accuracy degradation caused by the attack. Moreover, for the vast majority of models, we can identify more than one alias pair that achieves higher accuracy than the under-attack baseline, in which the model relies solely on few-shot learning without any defensive mechanism. A linguistic analysis further reveals that semantically aligned alias labels(e.g., good vs. bad) yield stronger robustness than unaligned symbols(e.g., blue vs. yellow). Overall, this study demonstrates that label semantics can serve as an effective defense layer, transforming meaning itself into a shield against prompt injection.

TL;DR: 使用微调的大语言模型从灾害相关社交媒体中提取影响位置信息，为应急响应提供决策支持


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模灾害往往造成严重后果，传统权威数据（现场传感器、遥感影像等）存在时空信息缺口，而社交媒体可作为"地理传感器"提供实时信息。但并非所有提及的位置都受灾害影响，需要区分受影响位置和非受影响位置以有效分配资源。

Method: 使用大语言模型（LLMs）识别灾害相关社交媒体中的所有位置、影响和受影响位置。通过微调LLMs专门识别影响和受影响位置（区别于非受影响位置），包括非正式表达、缩写和简写形式的位置信息。

Result: 微调模型表现出良好效果：影响提取F1分数0.69，受影响位置提取F1分数0.74，显著优于预训练基线模型。这些稳健结果证实了微调语言模型在灾害响应中的潜力。

Conclusion: 微调的语言模型为灾害响应中的资源分配、态势感知和灾后恢复规划提供了可扩展的及时决策支持解决方案，能够有效从社交媒体中提取关键影响位置信息。

Abstract: Large-scale disasters can often result in catastrophic consequences on people and infrastructure. Situation awareness about such disaster impacts generated by authoritative data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, and/or geographic data is often limited due to atmospheric opacity, satellite revisits, and time limitations. This often results in geo-temporal information gaps. In contrast, impact-related social media posts can act as "geo-sensors" during a disaster, where people describe specific impacts and locations. However, not all locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts relate to an impact. Only the impacted locations are critical for directing resources effectively. e.g., "The death toll from a fire which ripped through the Greek coastal town of #Mati stood at 80, with dozens of people unaccounted for as forensic experts tried to identify victims who were burned alive #Greecefires #AthensFires #Athens #Greece." contains impacted location "Mati" and non-impacted locations "Greece" and "Athens". This research uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify all locations, impacts and impacted locations mentioned in disaster-related social media posts. In the process, LLMs are fine-tuned to identify only impacts and impacted locations (as distinct from other, non-impacted locations), including locations mentioned in informal expressions, abbreviations, and short forms. Our fine-tuned model demonstrates efficacy, achieving an F1-score of 0.69 for impact and 0.74 for impacted location extraction, substantially outperforming the pre-trained baseline. These robust results confirm the potential of fine-tuned language models to offer a scalable solution for timely decision-making in resource allocation, situational awareness, and post-disaster recovery planning for responders.

TL;DR: 通过因果追踪技术，在GPT-2 XL架构上发现了算术推理的双阶段机制：中层分布式计算暂存区和后期聚合电路，能有效检测金融领域LLM的算术幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在金融等高风险领域部署时存在可复现的算术幻觉问题，现有缓解策略多将模型视为黑箱，需要更机制化的内在幻觉检测方法。

Method: 在ConvFinQA基准上对GPT-2 XL架构应用因果追踪技术，识别算术推理的双阶段机制：中层（L12-L30）分布式计算暂存区和后期（特别是L46层）决定性聚合电路。

Result: 抑制第46层可将模型对幻觉输出的置信度降低81.8%；基于该层训练的线性探针在未见金融主题上达到98%准确率，表明算术欺骗存在普适几何结构。

Conclusion: 揭示了LLM算术推理的机制化结构，为内在幻觉检测提供了新途径，证明算术欺骗模式具有跨主题的普适性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes financial domains, yet they suffer from specific, reproducible hallucinations when performing arithmetic operations. Current mitigation strategies often treat the model as a black box. In this work, we propose a mechanistic approach to intrinsic hallucination detection. By applying Causal Tracing to the GPT-2 XL architecture on the ConvFinQA benchmark, we identify a dual-stage mechanism for arithmetic reasoning: a distributed computational scratchpad in middle layers (L12-L30) and a decisive aggregation circuit in late layers (specifically Layer 46). We verify this mechanism via an ablation study, demonstrating that suppressing Layer 46 reduces the model's confidence in hallucinatory outputs by 81.8%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a linear probe trained on this layer generalizes to unseen financial topics with 98% accuracy, suggesting a universal geometry of arithmetic deception.

TL;DR: ODB-dLLM通过双边界协调机制加速扩散大语言模型推理：在预填充阶段使用自适应长度预测减少冗余计算，在解码阶段采用跳转共享推测解码减少迭代次数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散大语言模型(dLLM)虽然性能优异且支持并行解码，但其双向注意力机制需要周期性刷新KV缓存，导致预填充和解码阶段交错，增加了推理成本并限制了加速效果

Method: 1. 预填充阶段：引入自适应长度预测机制，渐进式减少预填充开销和不必要计算；2. 解码阶段：提出dLLM特定的跳转共享推测解码方法，减少解码迭代次数

Result: 实验结果显示，ODB-dLLM相比基线dLLM实现了46-162倍加速，相比Fast-dLLM实现了2.63-6.30倍加速，同时缓解了现有加速框架中的精度下降问题

Conclusion: 通过协调预填充和解码阶段的双边界，ODB-dLLM有效提升了扩散大语言模型的推理效率，在保持精度的同时实现了显著加速

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently gained significant attention for their exceptional performance and inherent potential for parallel decoding. Existing frameworks further enhance its inference efficiency by enabling KV caching. However, its bidirectional attention mechanism necessitates periodic cache refreshes that interleave prefill and decoding phases, both contributing substantial inference cost and constraining achievable speedup. Inspired by the heterogeneous arithmetic intensity of the prefill and decoding phases, we propose ODB-dLLM, a framework that orchestrates dual-boundaries to accelerate dLLM inference. In the prefill phase, we find that the predefined fixed response length introduces heavy yet redundant computational overhead, which affects efficiency. To alleviate this, ODB-dLLM incorporates an adaptive length prediction mechanism that progressively reduces prefill overhead and unnecessary computation. In the decoding phase, we analyze the computational characteristics of dLLMs and propose a dLLM-specific jump-share speculative decoding method to enhance efficiency by reducing the number of decoding iterations. Experimental results demonstrate that ODB-dLLM achieves 46-162x and 2.63-6.30x speedups over the baseline dLLM and Fast-dLLM, respectively, while simultaneously mitigating the accuracy degradation in existing acceleration frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型已能统一处理图像、音频和视频，但扩展到脑成像领域仍未被探索。弥合这一差距对于连接神经活动与语义认知、开发跨模态脑表征至关重要。

Method: 三阶段框架：1）学习神经分词器，将fMRI映射到语言一致空间中的离散标记；2）适配预训练LLM联合建模fMRI标记和文本，将脑活动视为可时序预测和语言描述序列；3）多任务、多范式指令微调，赋予模型高级语义理解能力。

Result: fMRI-LM在各种基准测试中实现了强大的零样本和少样本性能，并通过参数高效微调（LoRA）高效适应，为fMRI的结构和语义理解建立了可扩展的语言对齐通用模型路径。

Conclusion: fMRI-LM成功将fMRI与语言对齐，建立了连接神经活动与语义认知的桥梁，为脑成像的多模态理解提供了可扩展的基础模型框架。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have enabled unified reasoning across images, audio, and video, but extending such capability to brain imaging remains largely unexplored. Bridging this gap is essential to link neural activity with semantic cognition and to develop cross-modal brain representations. To this end, we present fMRI-LM, a foundational model that bridges functional MRI (fMRI) and language through a three-stage framework. In Stage 1, we learn a neural tokenizer that maps fMRI into discrete tokens embedded in a language-consistent space. In Stage 2, a pretrained LLM is adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text, treating brain activity as a sequence that can be temporally predicted and linguistically described. To overcome the lack of natural fMRI-text pairs, we construct a large descriptive corpus that translates diverse imaging-based features into structured textual descriptors, capturing the low-level organization of fMRI signals. In Stage 3, we perform multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning to endow fMRI-LM with high-level semantic understanding, supporting diverse downstream applications. Across various benchmarks, fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, and adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned, universal model for structural and semantic understanding of fMRI.

Motivation: LLM在标准翻译任务中表现良好，但在方言和低资源语言翻译方面效果有限，特别是对于Sylheti这种孟加拉语方言

Method: 提出Sylheti-CAP三步骤框架：1)嵌入语言规则手册；2)包含2260个核心词汇和习语的词典；3)真实性检查。评估了GPT-4.1、LLaMA 4、Grok 3和DeepSeek V3.2等五个LLM

Result: Sylheti-CAP在所有模型和提示策略中一致提升翻译质量，自动指标和人工评估均证实其有效性，显著减少幻觉、歧义和生硬表达

Conclusion: Sylheti-CAP为方言和低资源机器翻译提供了可扩展的解决方案，通过上下文感知提示有效解决了LLM在方言翻译中的词汇挑战

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong translation abilities through prompting, even without task-specific training. However, their effectiveness in dialectal and low-resource contexts remains underexplored. This study presents the first systematic investigation of LLM-based machine translation (MT) for Sylheti, a dialect of Bangla that is itself low-resource. We evaluate five advanced LLMs (GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1, LLaMA 4, Grok 3, and DeepSeek V3.2) across both translation directions (Bangla $\Leftrightarrow$ Sylheti), and find that these models struggle with dialect-specific vocabulary. To address this, we introduce Sylheti-CAP (Context-Aware Prompting), a three-step framework that embeds a linguistic rulebook, a dictionary (2{,}260 core vocabulary items and idioms), and an authenticity check directly into prompts. Extensive experiments show that Sylheti-CAP consistently improves translation quality across models and prompting strategies. Both automatic metrics and human evaluations confirm its effectiveness, while qualitative analysis reveals notable reductions in hallucinations, ambiguities, and awkward phrasing, establishing Sylheti-CAP as a scalable solution for dialectal and low-resource MT.

Conclusion: 综述的技术为改善LLM响应质量和可靠性提供了系统框架，特别是在对话场景中实现更好的对齐、基础和幻觉控制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) may generate outputs that are misaligned with user intent, lack contextual grounding, or exhibit hallucinations during conversation, which compromises the reliability of LLM-based applications. This review aimed to identify and analyze techniques that align LLM responses with conversational goals, ensure grounding, and reduce hallucination and topic drift. We conducted a Rapid Review guided by the PRISMA framework and the PICO strategy to structure the search, filtering, and selection processes. The alignment strategies identified were categorized according to the LLM lifecycle phase in which they operate: inference-time, post-training, and reinforcement learning-based methods. Among these, inference-time approaches emerged as particularly efficient, aligning outputs without retraining while supporting user intent, contextual grounding, and hallucination mitigation. The reviewed techniques provided structured mechanisms for improving the quality and reliability of LLM responses across key alignment objectives.

Result: 在五个前沿LLMs中，GPT-5表现最佳，在k=10时达到39.1%的识别准确率

Conclusion: FLAWS基准测试为评估LLMs在科学错误检测能力提供了有效工具，当前模型仍有改进空间

Abstract: The identification and localization of errors is a core task in peer review, yet the exponential growth of scientific output has made it increasingly difficult for human reviewers to reliably detect errors given the limited pool of experts. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential to support such evaluation tasks, from academic peer review to automated scientific assessment. However, despite the growing use of LLMs in review systems, their capabilities to pinpoint errors remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce Fault Localization Across Writing in Science (FLAWS), an automated benchmark consisting of 713 paper-error pairs designed to evaluate how effectively LLMs detect errors that undermine key claims in research papers. We construct the benchmark by systematically inserting claim-invalidating errors into peer-reviewed papers using LLMs, paired with an automated evaluation metric that measures whether models can identify and localize these errors. Developing such a benchmark presents unique challenges that we overcome: ensuring that the inserted errors are well-defined, challenging, and relevant to the content of the paper, avoiding artifacts that would make identification trivial, and designing a scalable, automated evaluation metric. On the resulting benchmark, we evaluate five frontier LLMs: Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek Reasoner v3.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT 5, and Grok 4. Among these, GPT 5 is the top-performing model, achieving 39.1% identification accuracy when k=10, where k is the number of top-ranked error text candidates generated by the LLM.

Conclusion: CoRA指标能更可靠地评估LLM在多项选择任务中的表现，通过考虑回答一致性提供更准确的性能评估

Abstract: In this work we present the Consistency-Rebalanced Accuracy (CoRA) metric, improving the reliability of Large Language Model (LLM) scores computed on multiple choice (MC) benchmarks. Our metric explores the response consistency of the LLMs, taking advantage of synthetically-generated questions with altered answer choices. With two intermediate scores, i.e. Bare-Minimum-Consistency Accuracy (BMCA) and Consistency Index (CI), CoRA is computed by adjusting the multiple-choice question answering (MCQA) scores to better reflect the level of consistency of the LLM. We present evaluations in different benchmarks using diverse LLMs, and not only demonstrate that LLMs can present low response consistency even when they present high MCQA scores, but also that CoRA can successfully scale down the scores of inconsistent models.

Motivation: 客服场景需要领域内对话数据、丰富标注和预测能力，但现有情感识别资源常存在领域不匹配、标注有限且侧重事后检测的问题。

Method: 采用受控的Wizard of Oz实验来引发目标情感轨迹的交互，构建了包含四个商业场景的2,148个双语对话语料库，并进行多维度标注评估。

Result: 中性情绪占主导；渴望和感激是最常见的非中性情绪；多标签情感和效价标注一致性中等，唤醒度和支配度较低；自我报告与第三方标注存在显著差异；某些情感策略能促进积极互惠，而其他策略可能引发负面情绪。

Conclusion: WOZ实验能有效引导对话情感轨迹，特别是负面目标；前瞻性情感推理具有挑战性，凸显了主动情感感知支持的复杂性；自我报告与第三方标注的差异对情感识别系统设计有重要启示。

Abstract: Emotion-aware customer service needs in-domain conversational data, rich annotations, and predictive capabilities, but existing resources for emotion recognition are often out-of-domain, narrowly labeled, and focused on post-hoc detection. To address this, we conducted a controlled Wizard of Oz (WOZ) experiment to elicit interactions with targeted affective trajectories. The resulting corpus, EmoWOZ-CS, contains 2,148 bilingual (Dutch-English) written dialogues from 179 participants across commercial aviation, e-commerce, online travel agencies, and telecommunication scenarios. Our contributions are threefold: (1) Evaluate WOZ-based operator-steered valence trajectories as a design for emotion research; (2) Quantify human annotation performance and variation, including divergences between self-reports and third-party judgments; (3) Benchmark detection and forward-looking emotion inference in real-time support. Findings show neutral dominates participant messages; desire and gratitude are the most frequent non-neutral emotions. Agreement is moderate for multilabel emotions and valence, lower for arousal and dominance; self-reports diverge notably from third-party labels, aligning most for neutral, gratitude, and anger. Objective strategies often elicit neutrality or gratitude, while suboptimal strategies increase anger, annoyance, disappointment, desire, and confusion. Some affective strategies (cheerfulness, gratitude) foster positive reciprocity, whereas others (apology, empathy) can also leave desire, anger, or annoyance. Temporal analysis confirms successful conversation-level steering toward prescribed trajectories, most distinctly for negative targets; positive and neutral targets yield similar final valence distributions. Benchmarks highlight the difficulty of forward-looking emotion inference from prior turns, underscoring the complexity of proactive emotion-aware support.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种捕捉标注者阅读过程的注释方法，通过鼠标追踪创建了包含细粒度阅读行为的PreferRead数据集，发现阅读行为与标注结果显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标注方法只记录最终标签，无法了解标注者的决策过程。本文旨在通过捕捉标注者的阅读行为（如关注点、重读、略读）来更好地理解复杂主观NLP任务中的标注者可靠性、决策过程和分歧。

Method: 提出了一种注释框架，不仅记录标签，还通过鼠标追踪捕捉标注者的阅读过程。在偏好标注任务中进行了案例研究，创建了PreferRead数据集，包含标注者在提示和两个候选回答之间导航的细粒度阅读行为。

Result: 标注者在约一半的试验中会重读回答，最常重读最终选择的选项，很少重读提示。阅读行为与标注结果显著相关：重读与更高的标注者间一致性相关，而长阅读路径和时间与较低的一致性相关。

Conclusion: 阅读过程为理解复杂主观NLP任务中的标注者可靠性、决策过程和分歧提供了补充的认知维度。该方法有助于更全面地评估标注质量，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: We propose an annotation approach that captures not only labels but also the reading process underlying annotators' decisions, e.g., what parts of the text they focus on, re-read or skim. Using this framework, we conduct a case study on the preference annotation task, creating a dataset PreferRead that contains fine-grained annotator reading behaviors obtained from mouse tracking. PreferRead enables detailed analysis of how annotators navigate between a prompt and two candidate responses before selecting their preference. We find that annotators re-read a response in roughly half of all trials, most often revisiting the option they ultimately choose, and rarely revisit the prompt. Reading behaviors are also significantly related to annotation outcomes: re-reading is associated with higher inter-annotator agreement, whereas long reading paths and times are associated with lower agreement. These results demonstrate that reading processes provide a complementary cognitive dimension for understanding annotator reliability, decision-making and disagreement in complex, subjective NLP tasks. Our code and data are publicly available.

TL;DR: 该研究创建了首个中文歌词作者归属数据集，开发了领域特定模型，并与DeepSeek LLM的零样本推理进行对比，发现体裁对归属准确率有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文歌词作者归属领域缺乏干净、公开的数据集，需要建立基准数据集和评估框架。

Method: 创建平衡的中文歌词多体裁数据集，开发并微调领域特定模型，与DeepSeek LLM的零样本推理进行对比测试。

Result: 假设2得到强验证：结构化体裁（如民俗传统）比抽象体裁（如爱情浪漫）准确率显著更高。假设1仅部分支持：微调在真实数据测试中提升鲁棒性和泛化能力，但在合成增强测试中增益有限。

Conclusion: 建立了中文歌词跨体裁作者归属的首个基准，强调体裁敏感评估的重要性，建议扩大测试集多样性、减少词级数据增强、平衡作者跨体裁代表性，并探索领域自适应预训练。

Abstract: We propose a novel study on authorship attribution for Chinese lyrics, a domain where clean, public datasets are sorely lacking. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we create a new, balanced dataset of Chinese lyrics spanning multiple genres, and (2) we develop and fine-tune a domain-specific model, comparing its performance against zero-shot inference using the DeepSeek LLM.
  We test two central hypotheses. First, we hypothesize that a fine-tuned model will outperform a zero-shot LLM baseline. Second, we hypothesize that performance is genre-dependent. Our experiments strongly confirm Hypothesis 2: structured genres (e.g. Folklore & Tradition) yield significantly higher attribution accuracy than more abstract genres (e.g. Love & Romance). Hypothesis 1 receives only partial support: fine-tuning improves robustness and generalization in Test1 (real-world data and difficult genres), but offers limited or ambiguous gains in Test2, a smaller, synthetically-augmented set. We show that the design limitations of Test2 (e.g., label imbalance, shallow lexical differences, and narrow genre sampling) can obscure the true effectiveness of fine-tuning.
  Our work establishes the first benchmark for cross-genre Chinese lyric attribution, highlights the importance of genre-sensitive evaluation, and provides a public dataset and analytical framework for future research. We conclude with recommendations: enlarge and diversify test sets, reduce reliance on token-level data augmentation, balance author representation across genres, and investigate domain-adaptive pretraining as a pathway for improved attribution performance.

TL;DR: 研究提出系统探测Transformer注意力机制的方法，利用词汇歧义分析词义消解机制，发现不同规模模型注意力头的发展模式和鲁棒性差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管对Transformer语言模型中自注意力矩阵操作有原理性理解，但仍不清楚这些操作如何映射到可解释的计算或功能，以及单个注意力头何时发展出专门的注意力模式

Method: 提出系统探测注意力机制的流程：1) 使用Pythia LM检查点识别消解性能拐点；2) 识别注意力与消解性能共变的注意力头；3) 通过刺激扰动测试鲁棒性；4) 进行因果分析（消融目标头）；5) 在14M模型所有随机种子中复现分析

Result: 1) 在14M和410M模型中识别出与消解性能共变的注意力头；2) 14M模型鲁棒性有限，410M模型发现多个具有惊人泛化行为的注意力头；3) 消融目标头会损害消解性能（14M尤其明显）；4) 消解受益于多种机制，14M对消解线索位置和词性高度敏感；5) 更大模型（410M）包含更鲁棒的消解行为注意力头

Conclusion: 词义消解依赖于多种机制的组合，不同规模模型注意力头发展模式不同，大模型包含更鲁棒的消解行为，采用发展视角对探测语言模型机制具有重要价值

Abstract: Despite an in-principle understanding of self-attention matrix operations in Transformer language models (LMs), it remains unclear precisely how these operations map onto interpretable computations or functions--and how or when individual attention heads develop specialized attention patterns. Here, we present a pipeline to systematically probe attention mechanisms, and we illustrate its value by leveraging lexical ambiguity--where a single word has multiple meanings--to isolate attention mechanisms that contribute to word sense disambiguation. We take a "developmental" approach: first, using publicly available Pythia LM checkpoints, we identify inflection points in disambiguation performance for each LM in the suite; in 14M and 410M, we identify heads whose attention to disambiguating words covaries with overall disambiguation performance across development. We then stress-test the robustness of these heads to stimulus perturbations: in 14M, we find limited robustness, but in 410M, we identify multiple heads with surprisingly generalizable behavior. Then, in a causal analysis, we find that ablating the target heads demonstrably impairs disambiguation performance, particularly in 14M. We additionally reproduce developmental analyses of 14M across all of its random seeds. Together, these results suggest: that disambiguation benefits from a constellation of mechanisms, some of which (especially in 14M) are highly sensitive to the position and part-of-speech of the disambiguating cue; and that larger models (410M) may contain heads with more robust disambiguation behavior. They also join a growing body of work that highlights the value of adopting a developmental perspective when probing LM mechanisms.

TL;DR: AfriStereo：首个基于非洲社会文化背景的开源非洲刻板印象数据集和评估框架，填补了AI偏见评估中非洲视角的空白


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI偏见评估基准主要反映西方视角，非洲背景代表性不足，导致各种应用领域存在有害刻板印象

Method: 通过塞内加尔、肯尼亚和尼日利亚的社区参与收集1163个刻板印象，使用少样本提示和人工验证扩展至5000+刻板印象-反刻板印象对，通过语义聚类和文化知情评审验证

Result: 11个语言模型中有9个表现出统计显著偏见，偏见偏好比率在0.63-0.78之间，在年龄、职业和性别维度尤其明显；领域特定模型偏见较弱

Conclusion: AfriStereo为文化基础偏见评估和缓解研究开辟道路，为AI社区提供构建更公平、情境感知和全球包容NLP技术的关键方法

Abstract: Existing AI bias evaluation benchmarks largely reflect Western perspectives, leaving African contexts underrepresented and enabling harmful stereotypes in applications across various domains. To address this gap, we introduce AfriStereo, the first open-source African stereotype dataset and evaluation framework grounded in local socio-cultural contexts. Through community engaged efforts across Senegal, Kenya, and Nigeria, we collected 1,163 stereotypes spanning gender, ethnicity, religion, age, and profession. Using few-shot prompting with human-in-the-loop validation, we augmented the dataset to over 5,000 stereotype-antistereotype pairs. Entries were validated through semantic clustering and manual annotation by culturally informed reviewers. Preliminary evaluation of language models reveals that nine of eleven models exhibit statistically significant bias, with Bias Preference Ratios (BPR) ranging from 0.63 to 0.78 (p <= 0.05), indicating systematic preferences for stereotypes over antistereotypes, particularly across age, profession, and gender dimensions. Domain-specific models appeared to show weaker bias in our setup, suggesting task-specific training may mitigate some associations. Looking ahead, AfriStereo opens pathways for future research on culturally grounded bias evaluation and mitigation, offering key methodologies for the AI community on building more equitable, context-aware, and globally inclusive NLP technologies.

Motivation: 学术研究产生多样化的数据源，研究人员越来越多地使用机器学习辅助研究任务，需要构建统一的数据接口来支持开发面向各种学术任务的机器学习模型，加速知识发现。

Method: 提出ResearchArcade图基接口，采用连贯的多表格式和图结构组织不同数据源（如ArXiv学术语料库和OpenReview同行评审），支持文本、图表等多模态信息，并保留手稿和社区层面的时间演化。

Result: 在六个学术任务上的实验表明，结合跨源和多模态信息能支持更广泛的任务范围，而图结构的加入相比基线方法能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: ResearchArcade展示了其有效性，并具有推动研究进展的潜力，为学术任务提供统一的机器学习支持框架。

Abstract: Academic research generates diverse data sources, and as researchers increasingly use machine learning to assist research tasks, a crucial question arises: Can we build a unified data interface to support the development of machine learning models for various academic tasks? Models trained on such a unified interface can better support human researchers throughout the research process, eventually accelerating knowledge discovery. In this work, we introduce ResearchArcade, a graph-based interface that connects multiple academic data sources, unifies task definitions, and supports a wide range of base models to address key academic challenges. ResearchArcade utilizes a coherent multi-table format with graph structures to organize data from different sources, including academic corpora from ArXiv and peer reviews from OpenReview, while capturing information with multiple modalities, such as text, figures, and tables. ResearchArcade also preserves temporal evolution at both the manuscript and community levels, supporting the study of paper revisions as well as broader research trends over time. Additionally, ResearchArcade unifies diverse academic task definitions and supports various models with distinct input requirements. Our experiments across six academic tasks demonstrate that combining cross-source and multi-modal information enables a broader range of tasks, while incorporating graph structures consistently improves performance over baseline methods. This highlights the effectiveness of ResearchArcade and its potential to advance research progress.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种互补方法用于从纵向临床笔记进行时间上下文基础的风险预测：HiTGNN（分层时序图神经网络）整合笔记内事件结构、就诊间动态和医学知识；ReVeAL（轻量级测试时框架）将大语言模型推理蒸馏到小型验证器模型。应用于2型糖尿病筛查，HiTGNN获得最高预测准确率，ReVeAL增强对真实病例的敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录中的临床笔记包含丰富的时间信息和结构化数据中常缺失的事件、临床推理及生活方式因素，利用这些信息进行预测建模对慢性疾病的及时识别具有重要意义。然而，临床笔记面临长文本、不规则事件分布、复杂时间依赖、隐私约束和资源限制等核心NLP挑战。

Method: 提出两种互补方法：1) HiTGNN：分层时序图神经网络，整合笔记内时间事件结构、就诊间动态和医学知识，以细粒度时间粒度建模患者轨迹；2) ReVeAL：轻量级测试时框架，将大语言模型的推理能力蒸馏到更小的验证器模型中。

Result: 应用于从私人和公共医院语料库构建的时间现实队列进行2型糖尿病机会性筛查，HiTGNN实现了最高的预测准确率，特别是对近期风险的预测，同时保护隐私并减少对大型专有模型的依赖。ReVeAL增强了对真实2型糖尿病病例的敏感性并保留了解释性推理。消融研究证实了时间结构和知识增强的价值，公平性分析显示HiTGNN在不同亚组中表现更公平。

Conclusion: HiTGNN和ReVeAL为从纵向临床笔记进行时间上下文基础的风险预测提供了有效解决方案，HiTGNN在预测准确率和公平性方面表现优异，ReVeAL则通过轻量级框架增强敏感性并保留推理能力，两者结合可应对临床笔记的NLP挑战并支持慢性疾病的及时识别。

Abstract: Clinical notes in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) capture rich temporal information on events, clinician reasoning, and lifestyle factors often missing from structured data. Leveraging them for predictive modeling can be impactful for timely identification of chronic diseases. However, they present core natural language processing (NLP) challenges: long text, irregular event distribution, complex temporal dependencies, privacy constraints, and resource limitations. We present two complementary methods for temporally and contextually grounded risk prediction from longitudinal notes. First, we introduce HiTGNN, a hierarchical temporal graph neural network that integrates intra-note temporal event structures, inter-visit dynamics, and medical knowledge to model patient trajectories with fine-grained temporal granularity. Second, we propose ReVeAL, a lightweight, test-time framework that distills the reasoning of large language models into smaller verifier models. Applied to opportunistic screening for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) using temporally realistic cohorts curated from private and public hospital corpora, HiTGNN achieves the highest predictive accuracy, especially for near-term risk, while preserving privacy and limiting reliance on large proprietary models. ReVeAL enhances sensitivity to true T2D cases and retains explanatory reasoning. Our ablations confirm the value of temporal structure and knowledge augmentation, and fairness analysis shows HiTGNN performs more equitably across subgroups.

TL;DR: 使用LLM结合心理学特征预测社交媒体说服效果，发现认知情绪和分享意愿是信念改变的关键预测因子


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统心理学信念修正模型主要针对面对面互动，无法有效捕捉社交媒体大规模文本交流中的信念改变，需要开发更有效的模型来理解在线说服机制

Method: 采用混合方法：利用大语言模型（LLMs）对心理学文献中的特征进行评分，构建随机森林分类模型来预测消息是否会导致信念改变，测试了八个特征

Result: 在测试的八个特征中，认知情绪（epistemic emotion）和分享意愿（willingness to share）是信念改变的最强预测因子，模型成功识别了说服性消息的特征

Conclusion: LLMs能够增强基于心理学理论的说服成功模型，为在线影响力检测、错误信息缓解和在线叙事效果测量等领域提供应用价值

Abstract: Traditional psychological models of belief revision focus on face-to-face interactions, but with the rise of social media, more effective models are needed to capture belief revision at scale, in this rich text-based online discourse. Here, we use a hybrid approach, utilizing large language models (LLMs) to develop a model that predicts successful persuasion using features derived from psychological experiments.
  Our approach leverages LLM generated ratings of features previously examined in the literature to build a random forest classification model that predicts whether a message will result in belief change. Of the eight features tested, \textit{epistemic emotion} and \textit{willingness to share} were the top-ranking predictors of belief change in the model. Our findings provide insights into the characteristics of persuasive messages and demonstrate how LLMs can enhance models of successful persuasion based on psychological theory. Given these insights, this work has broader applications in fields such as online influence detection and misinformation mitigation, as well as measuring the effectiveness of online narratives.

TL;DR: 提出相似度标准化方法，通过构建伪数据解决跨模态检索中的模态差异问题，显著提升多模态问答基准的检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在跨模态检索中存在模态差异问题，即文本和图像相似度分数尺度不一致，影响检索准确性。现有方法通常需要人工标注数据进行微调，成本较高。

Method: 提出相似度标准化方法：1) 为每个查询构建伪配对数据，通过检索与查询余弦相似度最高的文本和图像候选；2) 计算查询与伪配对数据在文本和图像模态下的相似度均值和方差；3) 使用这些模态特定统计量对所有相似度分数进行标准化，实现跨模态统一尺度比较。

Result: 在7个VLMs和两个多模态QA基准（MMQA和WebQA）上评估，当查询和目标数据属于不同模态时，Recall@20平均提升64%（MMQA）和28%（WebQA）。相比使用图像描述方法的E5-V，本方法更有效地弥合模态差异。

Conclusion: 提出的相似度标准化方法无需人工标注，通过伪数据构建有效解决跨模态检索中的模态差异问题，显著提升检索性能，为多模态信息检索提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled effective cross-modality retrieval. However, when both text and images exist in the database, similarity scores would differ in scale by modality. This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, hinders accurate retrieval. Most existing studies address this issue with manually labeled data, e.g., by fine-tuning VLMs on them. In this work, we propose a similarity standardization approach with pseudo data construction. We first compute the mean and variance of the similarity scores between each query and its paired data in text or image modality. Using these modality-specific statistics, we standardize all similarity scores to compare on a common scale across modalities. These statistics are calculated from pseudo pairs, which are constructed by retrieving the text and image candidates with the highest cosine similarity to each query. We evaluate our method across seven VLMs using two multi-modal QA benchmarks (MMQA and WebQA), where each question requires retrieving either text or image data. Our experimental results show that our method significantly improves retrieval performance, achieving average Recall@20 gains of 64% on MMQA and 28% on WebQA when the query and the target data belong to different modalities. Compared to E5-V, which addresses the modality gap through image captioning, we confirm that our method more effectively bridges the modality gap.

TL;DR: C²DLM：基于因果概念引导的扩散语言模型，通过提取概念级因果图来指导注意力机制学习概念间的因果关系，提升推理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归语言模型和扩散语言模型在推理能力上存在不足。人类推理依赖于因果知识和思维，而自回归模型采用严格的从左到右标记预测，扩散模型则完全忽略因果顺序。需要一种能更好建模自然语言中灵活因果结构的方法

Method: 从扩散语言模型的完全连接注意力机制出发，首先从教师模型获取概念级因果图，然后显式地引导注意力机制学习概念间的因果关系。通过聚焦于因果关系并避免因果反转等困难子目标的干扰来改进模型

Result: 在COT-OrderPerturb任务中提升12%，训练速度加快约3.2倍；在六个下游推理任务上平均增益1.31%

Conclusion: C²DLM通过引入因果概念引导机制，有效提升了语言模型的推理能力，特别是在处理需要因果理解的任务上表现显著改善

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) language models and Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) constitute the two principal paradigms of large language models. However, both paradigms suffer from insufficient reasoning capabilities. Human reasoning inherently relies on causal knowledge and thought, which are reflected in natural language. But in the AR paradigm, language is modeled as next token prediction (a strictly left-to-right, token-by-token order), whereas natural language itself exhibits more flexible causal structures. In the DLM paradigm, the attention mechanism is fully connected, which entirely disregards causal order. To fill this gap, we propose a \underline{\textbf{C}}ausal \underline{\textbf{C}}oncept-Guided \underline{\textbf{D}}iffusion \underline{\textbf{L}}anguage \underline{\textbf{M}}odel (C$^2$DLM). Starting from DLM's fully connected attention, C$^2$DLM first obtains a concept-level causal graph from the teacher model, and then explicitly guides attention to learn causal relationships between concepts. By focusing on causal relationships and avoiding interference from difficult subgoals involving causal inversion, C$^2$DLM improves 12\% with about 3.2 times training speedup in the COT-OrderPerturb task, and achieves an average gain of 1.31\% across six downstream reasoning tasks.

Motivation: LLM的快速扩散模糊了人类与机器作者的界限，对学术诚信和信息可靠性构成风险。现有文本检测器通常依赖单一方法范式，泛化能力差且误报率高，特别是在高风险的学术文本上。

Method: 提出理论基础的混合集成方法，系统融合三种互补检测范式：1)基于RoBERTa的transformer分类器用于深度语义特征提取；2)基于GPT-2的概率检测器使用扰动诱导似然曲率；3)统计语言特征分析器捕捉文体计量模式。核心创新在于优化的加权投票框架，其中集成权重在概率单纯形上学习以最大化F1分数而非启发式设置。

Result: 在包含30,000个文档的大规模多生成器语料库上评估，系统达到94.2%准确率和0.978的AUC，在学术文本上误报率相对降低35%。提供偏差-方差分析，实证显示低模型间相关性(rho ~ 0.35-0.42)，这是方差减少的关键条件。

Conclusion: 该方法为教育和其它高风险领域提供了更可靠和道德负责的检测器，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has blurred the line between human and machine authorship, creating practical risks for academic integrity and information reliability. Existing text detectors typically rely on a single methodological paradigm and suffer from poor generalization and high false positive rates (FPR), especially on high-stakes academic text. We propose a theoretically grounded hybrid ensemble that systematically fuses three complementary detection paradigms: (i) a RoBERTa-based transformer classifier for deep semantic feature extraction, (ii) a GPT-2-based probabilistic detector using perturbation-induced likelihood curvature, and (iii) a statistical linguistic feature analyzer capturing stylometric patterns. The core novelty lies in an optimized weighted voting framework, where ensemble weights are learned on the probability simplex to maximize F1-score rather than set heuristically. We provide a bias-variance analysis and empirically demonstrate low inter-model correlation (rho ~ 0.35-0.42), a key condition for variance reduction. Evaluated on a large-scale, multigenerator corpus of 30,000 documents, our system achieves 94.2% accuracy and an AUC of 0.978, with a 35% relative reduction in false positives on academic text. This yields a more reliable and ethically responsible detector for real-world deployment in education and other high-stakes domains.

Motivation: 研究发音过程中主要和次要发音器官之间的权衡协调机制，特别是唇-颌和舌-颌的协同运动，理解发音任务空间轨迹与低层发音执行之间的关系

Method: 采用DYNARTmo动态发音模型，该模型采用一阶任务空间手势规范（类似发音音系学），整合简化机制在多发音器官间分配发音努力，通过CV音节模拟分析颌位移随发音部位和元音语境的变化

Result: 模型成功复现了经验证实的发音协同模式：颌支持性舌尖闭合、双唇塞音中的下唇抬高、舌-颌协同运动、唇部收缩中的饱和效应，展示了颌位移随发音部位和元音语境变化的系统性模式

Conclusion: 即使采用计算简化的假设，DYNARTmo仍能生成现实的时空运动模式，捕捉各种辅音-元音组合中发音权衡和协同的关键方面，为理解发音协调机制提供了有效工具

Abstract: This paper investigates how the dynamic articulatory model DYNARTmo accounts for articulatory tradeoffs between primary and secondary articulators, with a focus on lips-jaw and tongue-jaw coordination. While DYNARTmo does not implement full task-dynamic second-order biomechanics, it adopts first-order task-space gesture specifications comparable to those used in articulatory phonology and integrates a simplified mechanism for distributing articulatory effort across multiple articulators. We first outline the conceptual relationship between task dynamics and DYNARTmo, emphasizing the distinction between high-level task-space trajectories and their low-level articulatory execution. We then present simulation results for a set of CV syllables that illustrate how jaw displacement varies as a function of both place of articulation (labial, apical, dorsal) and vowel context (/a/, /i/, /u/). The model reproduces empirically attested patterns of articulatory synergy, including jaw-supported apical closures, lower-lip elevation in bilabial stops, tongue-jaw co-movement, and saturation effects in labial constrictions. These results demonstrate that even with computationally simplified assumptions, DYNARTmo can generate realistic spatio-temporal movement patterns that capture key aspects of articulatory tradeoff and synergy across a range of consonant-vowel combinations.

Motivation: 研究语言模型能否自我精炼其回答，因为现实用户交互常涉及精炼请求，但现有研究多关注可验证任务而非开放性问题。

Method: 引入RefineBench基准，包含11个领域的1000个挑战性问题，采用清单式评估框架，测试引导式精炼和自我精炼两种模式。

Result: 前沿模型在自我精炼中表现一般（Gemini 2.5 Pro 31.3%，GPT-5 29.1%），改进有限；但在引导式精炼中，大型模型能利用反馈在5轮内达到近乎完美的水平。

Conclusion: 前沿语言模型需要突破才能有效自我精炼错误回答，RefineBench为追踪进展提供了有价值的测试平台。

Abstract: Can language models (LMs) self-refine their own responses? This question is increasingly relevant as a wide range of real-world user interactions involve refinement requests. However, prior studies have largely tested LMs' refinement abilities on verifiable tasks such as competition math or symbolic reasoning with simplified scaffolds, whereas users often pose open-ended queries and provide varying degrees of feedback on what they desire. The recent advent of reasoning models that exhibit self-reflection patterns in their chains-of-thought further motivates this question. To analyze this, we introduce RefineBench, a benchmark of 1,000 challenging problems across 11 domains paired with a checklist-based evaluation framework. We evaluate two refinement modes: (1) guided refinement, where an LM is provided natural language feedback, and (2) self-refinement, where LMs attempt to improve without guidance. In the self-refinement setting, even frontier LMs such as Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 achieve modest baseline scores of 31.3% and 29.1%, respectively, and most models fail to consistently improve across iterations (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro gains only +1.8%, while DeepSeek-R1 declines by -0.1%). By contrast, in guided refinement, both proprietary LMs and large open-weight LMs (>70B) can leverage targeted feedback to refine responses to near-perfect levels within five turns. These findings suggest that frontier LMs require breakthroughs to self-refine their incorrect responses, and that RefineBench provides a valuable testbed for tracking progress.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型的链式思维推理通常生成冗长的推理轨迹，导致token使用过多和推理延迟高。传统效率方法主要关注模型中心干预，如强化学习或监督微调，但本文提出无需训练、以输入为中心的新方法。

Method: 提出Focused Chain-of-Thought (F-CoT)，受认知心理学启发，将信息提取与推理过程分离。首先从查询中提取关键信息组织成简洁的结构化上下文，然后引导模型仅在此上下文中进行推理，避免关注无关细节。

Result: 在算术文字题上，F-CoT将生成的token减少2-3倍，同时保持与标准零样本CoT相当的准确性。

Conclusion: 结构化输入是提高LLM推理效率的简单而有效的杠杆，无需额外训练即可显著减少推理长度。

Abstract: Recent large language models achieve strong reasoning performance by generating detailed chain-of-thought traces, but this often leads to excessive token use and high inference latency. Existing efficiency approaches typically focus on model-centric interventions, such as reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning, to reduce verbosity. In contrast, we propose a training-free, input-centric approach. Inspired by cognitive psychology, we introduce Focused Chain-of-Thought (F-CoT), which separates information extraction from the reasoning process. F-CoT first organizes the essential information from a query into a concise, structured context and then guides the model to reason exclusively over this context. By preventing attention to irrelevant details, F-CoT naturally produces shorter reasoning paths. On arithmetic word problems, F-CoT reduces generated tokens by 2-3x while maintaining accuracy comparable to standard zero-shot CoT. These results highlight structured input as a simple yet effective lever for more efficient LLM reasoning.

Conclusion: RuCo-C通过自动生成细粒度、可解释的评估标准，解决了文本到SQL任务中评估和奖励机制的瓶颈问题，为模型训练提供了更有效的反馈机制。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL, a pivotal natural language processing (NLP) task that converts textual queries into executable SQL, has seen substantial progress in recent years. However, existing evaluation and reward mechanisms used to train and assess the text-to-SQL models remain a critical bottleneck. Current approaches heavily rely on manually annotated gold SQL queries, which are costly to produce and impractical for large-scale evaluation. More importantly, most reinforcement learning (RL) methods in text-to-SQL leverage only the final binary execution outcome as the reward signal, a coarse-grained supervision that overlooks detailed structural and semantic errors from the perspective of rubrics. To address these challenges, we propose RuCo-C, a novel generative judge model for fine-grained, query-specific automatic evaluation using interpretable critiques without human intervention. Our framework first automatically generates query-specific evaluation rubrics for human-free annotation, linking them to interpretable critiques. Subsequently, it integrates densified reward feedback through a "progressive exploration" strategy during the RL training process, which dynamically adjusts the rewards to enhance the model's performance. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RuCo-C outperforms existing methods in text-to-SQL evaluation, yielding significant performance gains.

TL;DR: 该研究提出三种新颖的token级概率估计方法，为生成式语言模型在多标签内容安全分类中提供可解释的置信度分数，解决LLaMA Guard等模型缺乏直接类别概率的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式语言模型（如LLaMA Guard）在多标签内容安全分类中有效，但其生成式架构缺乏直接的类别级概率，这阻碍了模型置信度评估和性能解释，使内容审核的动态阈值设置和细粒度错误分析变得复杂。

Method: 提出并评估三种新颖的token级概率估计方法，旨在为生成式分类器提供可解释的置信度分数。通过在一个经过严格标注的合成生成数据集上进行广泛实验，验证这些方法的有效性。

Result: 实验证明，利用token logits能显著提高生成式分类器的可解释性和可靠性，实现更细致的内容安全审核，并评估了该框架在不同指令调优模型上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: token级概率估计方法有效解决了生成式语言模型在多标签内容安全分类中缺乏置信度分数的问题，提高了模型的可解释性和准确性，为内容安全审核提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of deriving interpretable confidence scores from generative language models (LLMs) when applied to multi-label content safety classification. While models like LLaMA Guard are effective for identifying unsafe content and its categories, their generative architecture inherently lacks direct class-level probabilities, which hinders model confidence assessment and performance interpretation. This limitation complicates the setting of dynamic thresholds for content moderation and impedes fine-grained error analysis. This research proposes and evaluates three novel token-level probability estimation approaches to bridge this gap. The aim is to enhance model interpretability and accuracy, and evaluate the generalizability of this framework across different instruction-tuned models. Through extensive experimentation on a synthetically generated, rigorously annotated dataset, it is demonstrated that leveraging token logits significantly improves the interpretability and reliability of generative classifiers, enabling more nuanced content safety moderation.

Motivation: 随着电商平台评论数据爆炸式增长，手动分析效率低下，需要高效的计算方法进行情感分析来挖掘客户满意度和偏好信息。

Method: 采用DistilBERT轻量级Transformer模型，使用约100万条英文Shopee评论数据集，预处理后使用distilbert-base-uncased模型进行训练，并与BERT和SVM基准模型比较。

Result: DistilBERT准确率达到94.8%，略低于BERT（95.3%），但显著高于SVM（90.2%），计算时间减少55%以上，在准确率和效率间达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: DistilBERT在保持高准确率的同时大幅提升计算效率，适合电商平台大规模情感分析应用，为实际部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital commerce has led to the accumulation of a massive number of consumer reviews on online platforms. Shopee, as one of the largest e-commerce platforms in Southeast Asia, receives millions of product reviews every day containing valuable information regarding customer satisfaction and preferences. Manual analysis of these reviews is inefficient, thus requiring a computational approach such as sentiment analysis. This study examines the use of DistilBERT, a lightweight transformer-based deep learning model, for sentiment classification on Shopee product reviews. The dataset used consists of approximately one million English-language reviews that have been preprocessed and trained using the distilbert-base-uncased model. Evaluation was conducted using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, and compared against benchmark models such as BERT and SVM. The results show that DistilBERT achieved an accuracy of 94.8%, slightly below BERT (95.3%) but significantly higher than SVM (90.2%), with computation time reduced by more than 55%. These findings demonstrate that DistilBERT provides an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for large scale sentiment analysis on e-commerce platforms. Keywords: Sentiment Analysis, DistilBERT, Shopee Reviews, Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Transformer Models.

Motivation: 平衡自然语言处理技术的包容性和全球适用性，为低资源、代表性不足的库尔德索拉尼语创建首个命名实体识别数据集

Method: 创建首个库尔德索拉尼语NER数据集（64,563标注标记），提供多语言任务工具，对经典机器学习模型（如CRF）和神经网络系统（如BiLSTM）进行对比分析

Result: 传统方法（特别是CRF）获得0.825的F1分数，显著优于基于BiLSTM的模型（0.706），挑战了神经方法在NLP中的优势假设

Conclusion: 在低资源环境下，更简单、计算效率更高的经典框架可以超越神经架构，这对资源有限的语言处理具有重要意义

Abstract: This work contributes towards balancing the inclusivity and global applicability of natural language processing techniques by proposing the first 'name entity recognition' dataset for Kurdish Sorani, a low-resource and under-represented language, that consists of 64,563 annotated tokens. It also provides a tool for facilitating this task in this and many other languages and performs a thorough comparative analysis, including classic machine learning models and neural systems. The results obtained challenge established assumptions about the advantage of neural approaches within the context of NLP. Conventional methods, in particular CRF, obtain F1-scores of 0.825, outperforming the results of BiLSTM-based models (0.706) significantly. These findings indicate that simpler and more computationally efficient classical frameworks can outperform neural architectures in low-resource settings.

Motivation: LLMs在临床环境中应用日益广泛，但对不确定性语言线索的内部表征机制了解不足。与输出置信度的不确定性量化不同，本研究关注输入侧对语言不确定性的表征敏感性。

Method: 构建包含认知模态变化的临床陈述对比数据集（如"is consistent with" vs. "may be consistent with"），提出模型不确定性敏感性（MSU）指标，通过分层探测量化激活层面对不确定性线索的响应变化。

Result: LLMs表现出结构化、深度依赖的临床不确定性敏感性，表明认知信息在深层网络中逐步编码，揭示了语言不确定性在LLMs中的内部表征方式。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了LLMs如何内部表征语言不确定性，为模型可解释性和认知可靠性提供了重要见解，有助于理解LLMs在临床决策中的表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in clinical settings, where sensitivity to linguistic uncertainty can influence diagnostic interpretation and decision-making. Yet little is known about where such epistemic cues are internally represented within these models. Distinct from uncertainty quantification, which measures output confidence, this work examines input-side representational sensitivity to linguistic uncertainty in medical text. We curate a contrastive dataset of clinical statements varying in epistemic modality (e.g., 'is consistent with' vs. 'may be consistent with') and propose Model Sensitivity to Uncertainty (MSU), a layerwise probing metric that quantifies activation-level shifts induced by uncertainty cues. Our results show that LLMs exhibit structured, depth-dependent sensitivity to clinical uncertainty, suggesting that epistemic information is progressively encoded in deeper layers. These findings reveal how linguistic uncertainty is internally represented in LLMs, offering insight into their interpretability and epistemic reliability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，使用相似方法和数据微调预训练语言模型创建低资源语言翻译器时，性能差异主要源于语言本身差异，而非数据清洗、模型限制、基础模型大小或训练数据量等因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对先前研究中相似方法和数据微调预训练模型创建低资源语言翻译器时性能差异显著的问题，系统探索性能差异的根本原因，确定是数据清洗、模型限制、基础模型大小还是训练数据量的影响。

Method: 使用两种具有显著结构语言学特征的巴西原住民语言，系统研究不同训练因素对翻译性能的影响，包括数据清洗程序、预训练模型限制、基础模型大小和训练数据集大小，并研究双向翻译方向。

Result: 研究表明，那些训练因素对翻译性能几乎没有或只有非常有限的影响，表明语言之间的差异可能在通过微调预训练模型创建翻译器的能力中起着重要作用。

Conclusion: 在创建超低资源语言翻译器时，语言本身的结构和特征差异是影响微调预训练模型性能的关键因素，而非通常认为的训练技术因素。

Abstract: Finetuning pre-trained language models with small amounts of data is a commonly-used method to create translators for ultra-low resource languages such as endangered Indigenous languages. However, previous works have reported substantially different performances with translators created using similar methodology and data. In this work we systematically explored possible causes of the performance difference, aiming to determine whether it was a product of different cleaning procedures, limitations of the pre-trained models, the size of the base model, or the size of the training dataset, studying both directions of translation. Our studies, using two Brazilian Indigenous languages, related but with significant structural linguistic characteristics, indicated none or very limited influence from those training factors, suggesting differences between languages may play a significant role in the ability to produce translators by fine-tuning pre-trained models.

TL;DR: 提出联合训练方法，利用现有语音DST数据和跨领域文本数据，实现无需目标领域语音训练数据的跨领域泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音对话状态跟踪面临语音输入处理和数据稀缺的双重挑战。虽然结合语音基础编码器和大型语言模型的方法在单领域表现优异，但缺乏跨领域泛化能力，且需要为每个目标领域收集昂贵的语音标注数据。文本DST数据相对更容易获取，因此探索如何利用跨领域文本数据提升语音DST的泛化能力。

Method: 提出联合训练方法，同时使用可用的语音DST数据和来自其他领域的书面文本数据。通过多领域文本数据的训练来增强模型在未见语音领域的泛化能力，无需目标领域的语音训练数据。

Result: 实验证明所提方法能有效实现跨领域DST性能，在不依赖目标领域语音训练数据的情况下获得良好的泛化效果。

Conclusion: 通过联合训练语音DST数据和跨领域文本数据，可以显著提升语音对话状态跟踪模型的跨领域泛化能力，减少对昂贵语音标注数据的依赖，为实际应用提供更可行的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end spoken dialogue state tracking (DST) is made difficult by the tandem of having to handle speech input and data scarcity. Combining speech foundation encoders and large language models has been proposed in recent work as to alleviate some of this difficulty. Although this approach has been shown to result in strong spoken DST models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in realistic multi-turn DST, it struggles to generalize across domains and requires annotated spoken DST training data for each domain of interest. However, collecting such data for every target domain is both costly and difficult. Noting that textual DST data is more easily obtained for various domains, in this work, we propose jointly training on available spoken DST data and written textual data from other domains as a way to achieve cross-domain generalization. We conduct experiments which show the efficacy of our proposed method for getting good cross-domain DST performance without relying on spoken training data from the target domains.

TL;DR: 在强最简主义框架下，通过侧向合并分析一系列看似违反扩展条件的语言现象，证明这些现象实际上不违反EC，并探讨最优性违反程度与替代推导方式的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言学中一系列看似违反扩展条件（Extension Condition）的现象，包括头到头的移位、短语词缀和句法附着、动词-小品词交替、算子-变量现象等，证明这些现象可以在不违反EC的情况下得到解释。

Method: 采用强最简主义框架下的合并数学形式化，使用侧向合并（Sideward Merge）分析各种语言现象，探讨最优性违反程度，比较最小搜索和资源限制的最优性条件对Hopf代数马尔可夫链动态的影响。

Result: 证明所有看似违反EC的现象都可以通过侧向合并解释而不违反EC；发现涉及大量最优性违反的案例可以通过既不违反EC也不使用SM的替代方式推导；头到头的移位仅涉及最小最优性违反的SM；EC在合并数学形式化中具有清晰的代数意义，是模型固有的结构约束。

Conclusion: 扩展条件不是额外假设，而是合并数学形式化的固有结构代数约束；侧向合并与最小最优性违反在合并的马尔可夫性质中起结构性作用；不同最优性条件对语言动态有不同影响。

Abstract: We analyze, using the mathematical formulation of Merge within the Strong Minimalist Thesis framework, a set of linguistic phenomena, including head-to-head movement, phrasal affixes and syntactic cliticization, verb-particle alternation, and operator-variable phenomena. These are often regarded as problematic, as violations of the Extension Condition. We show that, in fact, all of these phenomena can be explained without involving any EC violation. We first show that derivations using Sideward Merge are possible for all of these cases: these respect EC, though they involve some amount of optimality violations, with respect to Resource Restrictions cost functions, andthe amount of violation differs among these cases. We show that all the cases that involve large optimality violations can be derived in alternative ways involving neither EC nor the use of SM. The main remaining case (head-to-head movement) only involves SM with minimal violations of optimality (near equilibrium fluctuations). We analyze explicitly also the cases of multiple wh-fronting, clusters of clitics in Romance languages and possessor agreement construction in Korean, and how an explanation of these phenomena based on SM can be made compatible with the colored operad generators for phases and theta roles. We also show that the EC condition has a clear algebraic meaning in the mathematical formulation of Merge and is therefore an intrinsic structural algebraic constraint of the model, rather than an additional assumption. We also show that the minimal optimality violating SM plays a structural role in the Markovian properties of Merge, and we compare different optimality conditions coming from Minimal Search and from Resource Restriction in terms of their effect on the dynamics of the Hopf algebra Markov chain, in a simple explicit example.

Conclusion: HIL-GPT为工业HIL环境部署高效、领域对齐的LLM助手提供了可行方案，挑战了"越大越好"的传统观念

Abstract: Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing is essential for automotive validation but suffers from fragmented and underutilized test artifacts. This paper presents HIL-GPT, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system integrating domain-adapted large language models (LLMs) with semantic retrieval. HIL-GPT leverages embedding fine-tuning using a domain-specific dataset constructed via heuristic mining and LLM-assisted synthesis, combined with vector indexing for scalable, traceable test case and requirement retrieval. Experiments show that fine-tuned compact models, such as \texttt{bge-base-en-v1.5}, achieve a superior trade-off between accuracy, latency, and cost compared to larger models, challenging the notion that bigger is always better. An A/B user study further confirms that RAG-enhanced assistants improve perceived helpfulness, truthfulness, and satisfaction over general-purpose LLMs. These findings provide insights for deploying efficient, domain-aligned LLM-based assistants in industrial HIL environments.

Conclusion: 提出了一种结合自动数据集生成和微调的策略，能够有效适配LLM用于本体匹配任务，解决了训练数据稀缺的问题并提升了匹配性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into various components of Ontology Matching pipelines. This paper investigates the capability of LLMs to perform ontology matching directly on ontology modules and generate the corresponding alignments. Furthermore, it is explored how a dedicated fine-tuning strategy can enhance the model's matching performance in a zero-shot setting. The proposed method incorporates a search space reduction technique to select relevant subsets from both source and target ontologies, which are then used to automatically construct prompts. Recognizing the scarcity of reference alignments for training, a novel LLM-based approach is introduced for generating a synthetic dataset. This process creates a corpus of ontology submodule pairs and their corresponding reference alignments, specifically designed to fine-tune an LLM for the ontology matching task. The proposed approach was evaluated on the Conference, Geolink, Enslaved, Taxon, and Hydrography datasets from the OAEI complex track. The results demonstrate that the LLM fine-tuned on the synthetically generated data exhibits superior performance compared to the non-fine-tuned base model. The key contribution is a strategy that combines automatic dataset generation with fine-tuning to effectively adapt LLMs for ontology matching tasks.

Motivation: 当前多语言模型在处理罗马化脚本（用罗马字母表示各种语言语音）时面临挑战，特别是在南亚语境下，印地语和孟加拉语等印欧语系语言在社交媒体上广泛使用罗马化脚本，但现有转写数据集缺乏发音和拼写变体多样性、代码混合数据以及低资源适应能力。

Method: 1) 创建了包含近180万印地语和100万孟加拉语转写对的新数据集；2) 基于Marian架构预训练了定制的多语言seq2seq大语言模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，与现有相关模型相比，在BLEU和CER指标上取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和模型有效解决了印地语和孟加拉语罗马化转写的研究空白，为情感分析、语音识别、信息检索等NLP任务提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: The development of robust transliteration techniques to enhance the effectiveness of transforming Romanized scripts into native scripts is crucial for Natural Language Processing tasks, including sentiment analysis, speech recognition, information retrieval, and intelligent personal assistants. Despite significant advancements, state-of-the-art multilingual models still face challenges in handling Romanized script, where the Roman alphabet is adopted to represent the phonetic structure of diverse languages. Within the South Asian context, where the use of Romanized script for Indo-Aryan languages is widespread across social media and digital communication platforms, such usage continues to pose significant challenges for cutting-edge multilingual models. While a limited number of transliteration datasets and models are available for Indo-Aryan languages, they generally lack sufficient diversity in pronunciation and spelling variations, adequate code-mixed data for large language model (LLM) training, and low-resource adaptation. To address this research gap, we introduce a novel transliteration dataset for two popular Indo-Aryan languages, Hindi and Bengali, which are ranked as the 3rd and 7th most spoken languages worldwide. Our dataset comprises nearly 1.8 million Hindi and 1 million Bengali transliteration pairs. In addition to that, we pre-train a custom multilingual seq2seq LLM based on Marian architecture using the developed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements compared to existing relevant models in terms of BLEU and CER metrics.

Conclusion: 该工作不仅为MI社区贡献了高质量数据集，还为在复杂行为治疗中使用LLMs进行精确上下文解释提供了关键见解，有助于提升LLMs在敏感心理治疗领域的应用效果。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown their potential across both general and domain-specific tasks. However, there is a growing concern regarding their lack of sensitivity, factual incorrectness in responses, inconsistent expressions of empathy, bias, hallucinations, and overall inability to capture the depth and complexity of human understanding, especially in low-resource and sensitive domains such as psychology. To address these challenges, our study employs a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the efficacy of LLMs in psychotherapy. We use LLMs to generate precise summaries of motivational interviewing (MI) dialogues and design a two-stage annotation scheme based on key components of the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity (MITI) framework, namely evocation, collaboration, autonomy, direction, empathy, and a non-judgmental attitude. Using expert-annotated MI dialogues as ground truth, we formulate multi-class classification tasks to assess model performance under progressive prompting techniques, incorporating one-shot and few-shot prompting. Our results offer insights into LLMs' capacity for understanding complex psychological constructs and highlight best practices to mitigate ``semantic drift" in therapeutic settings. Our work contributes not only to the MI community by providing a high-quality annotated dataset to address data scarcity in low-resource domains but also critical insights for using LLMs for precise contextual interpretation in complex behavioral therapy.

Conclusion: 基于RAG的LLM系统可以替代日本医疗诉讼中的专家委员角色，但必须设计成满足三个关键法律要求：遵循禁止私人知识原则、保持生成响应的忠实性、以及引用具有适当时间戳的外部知识。

Abstract: This study discusses the essential components that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based LLM system should possess in order to support Japanese medical litigation procedures complying with legal norms. In litigation, expert commissioners, such as physicians, architects, accountants, and engineers, provide specialized knowledge to help judges clarify points of dispute. When considering the substitution of these expert roles with a RAG-based LLM system, the constraint of strict adherence to legal norms is imposed. Specifically, three requirements arise: (1) the retrieval module must retrieve appropriate external knowledge relevant to the disputed issues in accordance with the principle prohibiting the use of private knowledge, (2) the responses generated must originate from the context provided by the RAG and remain faithful to that context, and (3) the retrieval module must reference external knowledge with appropriate timestamps corresponding to the issues at hand. This paper discusses the design of a RAG-based LLM system that satisfies these requirements.

Abstract: We introduce JBE-QA, a Japanese Bar Exam Question-Answering dataset to evaluate large language models' legal knowledge. Derived from the multiple-choice (tanto-shiki) section of the Japanese bar exam (2015-2024), JBE-QA provides the first comprehensive benchmark for Japanese legal-domain evaluation of LLMs. It covers the Civil Code, the Penal Code, and the Constitution, extending beyond the Civil Code focus of prior Japanese resources. Each question is decomposed into independent true/false judgments with structured contextual fields. The dataset contains 3,464 items with balanced labels. We evaluate 26 LLMs, including proprietary, open-weight, Japanese-specialised, and reasoning models. Our results show that proprietary models with reasoning enabled perform best, and the Constitution questions are generally easier than the Civil Code or the Penal Code questions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在教育应用中有巨大潜力，但针对K-12英语写作的细粒度错误分析能力尚未充分探索，需要建立专门基准进行评估

Method: 开发FEANEL基准测试，包含1000篇中小学学生作文，基于语言教育专家共同开发的词性分类法进行错误标注（类型、严重程度、解释性反馈），评估SOTA LLMs在该基准上的表现

Result: 实验结果显示当前LLMs在细粒度错误分析能力上存在显著差距，无法满足教育应用需求

Conclusion: 需要开发专门针对教育应用的先进方法，提升LLMs在英语写作细粒度错误分析方面的能力

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence, offering profound opportunities for educational applications. However, their ability to provide fine-grained educational feedback for K-12 English writing remains underexplored. In this paper, we challenge the error analysis and pedagogical skills of LLMs by introducing the problem of Fine-grained Error Analysis for English Learners and present the Fine-grained Error ANalysis for English Learners (FEANEL) Benchmark. The benchmark comprises 1,000 essays written by elementary and secondary school students, and a well-developed English writing error taxonomy. Each error is annotated by language education experts and categorized by type, severity, and explanatory feedback, using a part-of-speech-based taxonomy they co-developed. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on the FEANEL Benchmark to explore their error analysis and pedagogical abilities. Experimental results reveal significant gaps in current LLMs' ability to perform fine-grained error analysis, highlighting the need for advancements in particular methods for educational applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出LED-WM方法，通过语言感知的世界模型提升策略在未见游戏中的泛化能力，无需规划或专家演示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在理解环境动态描述语言方面存在局限：要么无法泛化到未见游戏，要么依赖规划延迟可容忍或专家演示等限制性假设。需要改进语言条件世界模型的策略泛化能力。

Method: 基于DreamerV3构建LED-WM模型，使用注意力机制将语言描述显式地关联到观察中的实体，通过环境交互训练语言条件世界模型，从中学习策略而不需要规划或专家演示。

Result: 在MESSENGER和MESSENGER-WM环境中，LED-WM训练的策略相比基线方法能更有效地泛化到由新动态和语言描述的未见游戏。还能通过世界模型生成的合成测试轨迹进行微调提升策略性能。

Conclusion: LED-WM方法通过语言感知的世界模型显著提升了策略在未见游戏中的泛化能力，为现实世界部署前通过合成数据微调策略提供了有效途径。

Abstract: To interact effectively with humans in the real world, it is important for agents to understand language that describes the dynamics of the environment--that is, how the environment behaves--rather than just task instructions specifying "what to do". Understanding this dynamics-descriptive language is important for human-agent interaction and agent behavior. Recent work address this problem using a model-based approach: language is incorporated into a world model, which is then used to learn a behavior policy. However, these existing methods either do not demonstrate policy generalization to unseen games or rely on limiting assumptions. For instance, assuming that the latency induced by inference-time planning is tolerable for the target task or expert demonstrations are available. Expanding on this line of research, we focus on improving policy generalization from a language-conditioned world model while dropping these assumptions. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach, where a language-conditioned world model is trained through interaction with the environment, and a policy is learned from this model--without planning or expert demonstrations. Our method proposes Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM) built on top of DreamerV3. LED-WM features an observation encoder that uses an attention mechanism to explicitly ground language descriptions to entities in the observation. We show that policies trained with LED-WM generalize more effectively to unseen games described by novel dynamics and language compared to other baselines in several settings in two environments: MESSENGER and MESSENGER-WM.To highlight how the policy can leverage the trained world model before real-world deployment, we demonstrate the policy can be improved through fine-tuning on synthetic test trajectories generated by the world model.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一个迭代框架，结合LLM、T2IM和MLLM自动生成和评估基于成语的视觉双关图像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究成语视觉双关（图像同时体现成语的字面和比喻意义），开发自动化生成和评估方法，创建相关数据集

Method: 迭代框架：1) LLM生成详细视觉提示，2) T2IM合成图像，3) MLLM从图像推断成语，4) 精炼提示直到识别成功或达到步数限制

Result: 使用1000个成语生成了视觉双关图像数据集，实验显示MLLM选择是关键性能驱动因素：GPT准确率最高，Gemini次之，最佳开源MLLM（Gemma）与部分闭源模型竞争

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效生成成语视觉双关图像，MLLM性能是系统成功的关键因素，为视觉双关生成和理解提供了基准数据集

Abstract: We study idiom-based visual puns--images that align an idiom's literal and figurative meanings--and present an iterative framework that coordinates a large language model (LLM), a text-to-image model (T2IM), and a multimodal LLM (MLLM) for automatic generation and evaluation. Given an idiom, the system iteratively (i) generates detailed visual prompts, (ii) synthesizes an image, (iii) infers the idiom from the image, and (iv) refines the prompt until recognition succeeds or a step limit is reached. Using 1,000 idioms as inputs, we synthesize a corresponding dataset of visual pun images with paired prompts, enabling benchmarking of both generation and understanding. Experiments across 10 LLMs, 10 MLLMs, and one T2IM (Qwen-Image) show that MLLM choice is the primary performance driver: GPT achieves the highest accuracies, Gemini follows, and the best open-source MLLM (Gemma) is competitive with some closed models. On the LLM side, Claude attains the strongest average performance for prompt generation.

TL;DR: FLy是一种无需训练的宽松推测解码方法，通过目标模型的自校正行为放宽验证标准，在保持99%以上准确率的同时实现2.81-5.07倍加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推测解码(SPD)采用严格的精确匹配验证，丢弃了许多语义有效的延续；现有基于训练的SPD方法在分布外(OOD)任务上性能下降严重

Method: 提出训练免费的宽松推测解码(FLy)：1) 熵级门控识别当前token是否允许多个合理替代；2) token级延迟窗口区分真正错误与语义正确的变体；3) 多级加速策略同时加速目标模型和草稿模型

Result: 在Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct上平均2.81倍加速，405B变体上5.07倍加速，保持99%以上目标模型准确率；在分布外数据集上优于基于训练的方法EAGLE-3 1.62倍

Conclusion: FLy通过训练免费设计实现与任意草稿-目标模型对的兼容性，在保持语义准确性的同时显著降低推理延迟，特别在分布外任务上表现优异

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across diverse tasks but suffer from high inference latency due to their autoregressive generation. Speculative Decoding (SPD) mitigates this issue by verifying candidate tokens in parallel from a smaller draft model, yet its strict exact-match verification discards many semantically valid continuations. Moreover, existing training-based SPD methods often suffer from performance degradation on out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks. To this end, we propose Training-Free Loosely Speculative Decoding (FLy), a novel method that loosens the rigid verification criterion by leveraging the target model's self-corrective behavior to judge whether a draft-target mismatch remains semantically valid. FLy introduces a two-tier mechanism: an entropy-level gate that identifies whether the current token allows multiple plausible alternatives or is nearly deterministic, and a token-level deferred window that distinguishes genuine errors from differently worded yet semantically correct variants. To further reduce latency, we design a multi-level acceleration strategy that accelerates not only the target model but also the drafter itself. Owing to its training-free design, FLy composes seamlessly with arbitrary draft-target pairs and generalizes across models and domains without hyperparameter re-tuning. Experiments show that FLy preserves more than 99% of the target model's accuracy while achieving an average 2.81x speedup on Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct and 5.07x speedup on the 405B variant. Notably, on out-of-domain datasets, our method remains highly effective and outperforms the training-based method EAGLE-3 by 1.62x.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是评估Transformer表示在假新闻检测任务中的有效性，通过隔离Transformer架构的贡献与分类器复杂度，探索注意力机制编码作为真实性任务的基础架构。

Method: 方法包括：1）使用编码器（BERT）和解码器（GPT-2、Transformer-XL）预训练模型作为冻结嵌入器；2）配合轻量级分类器（逻辑回归和神经网络）；3）对比池化与填充预处理策略；4）在LIAR数据集上进行评估；5）分析序列长度和聚合方法的影响。

Result: 结果显示：1）上下文自注意力编码能有效迁移到假新闻检测任务；2）BERT嵌入结合逻辑回归优于神经网络基线；3）模型对截断具有鲁棒性；4）简单的最大池化或平均池化具有优势。

Conclusion: 结论是注意力机制令牌编码器可作为真实性任务的稳健、以架构为中心的基础，Transformer表示在隔离分类器复杂度的情况下表现出色，为假新闻检测提供了有效的预训练表示。

Abstract: This paper investigates fake news detection as a downstream evaluation of Transformer representations, benchmarking encoder-only and decoder-only pre-trained models (BERT, GPT-2, Transformer-XL) as frozen embedders paired with lightweight classifiers. Through controlled preprocessing comparing pooling versus padding and neural versus linear heads, results demonstrate that contextual self-attention encodings consistently transfer effectively. BERT embeddings combined with logistic regression outperform neural baselines on LIAR dataset splits, while analyses of sequence length and aggregation reveal robustness to truncation and advantages from simple max or average pooling. This work positions attention-based token encoders as robust, architecture-centric foundations for veracity tasks, isolating Transformer contributions from classifier complexity.

TL;DR: ShoppingComp是一个真实世界的购物代理基准测试，包含120个任务和1026个场景，由专家设计，评估LLM在精确产品检索、专业报告生成和安全决策三个核心能力上的表现。结果显示当前最先进模型表现很差（GPT-5仅11.22%），揭示了研究基准与现实部署之间的巨大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电子商务基准测试不足以评估LLM购物代理在真实世界中的能力，特别是在产品安全性和实际应用可靠性方面存在评估空白。需要建立一个更贴近真实购物需求、易于验证的基准来推动可靠实用的电商代理发展。

Method: 创建ShoppingComp基准，包含120个任务和1026个场景，由35位专家根据真实购物需求精心设计。基准强调真实产品、易于验证的原则，并引入产品安全危害识别这一新的评估维度，同时评估推荐准确性和报告质量。

Result: 当前最先进LLM表现极差：GPT-5仅11.22%，Gemini-2.5-Flash仅3.92%。模型存在严重问题：无法识别不安全产品使用、被促销信息误导、做出有害推荐等。这揭示了研究基准与现实部署之间的巨大差距。

Conclusion: ShoppingComp填补了现有基准测试的空白，为推进可靠实用的电子商务代理建立了新标准。结果表明当前LLM在真实世界购物任务中仍有严重不足，需要进一步改进才能安全部署。

Abstract: We present ShoppingComp, a challenging real-world benchmark for rigorously evaluating LLM-powered shopping agents on three core capabilities: precise product retrieval, expert-level report generation, and safety critical decision making. Unlike prior e-commerce benchmarks, ShoppingComp introduces highly complex tasks under the principle of guaranteeing real products and ensuring easy verifiability, adding a novel evaluation dimension for identifying product safety hazards alongside recommendation accuracy and report quality. The benchmark comprises 120 tasks and 1,026 scenarios, curated by 35 experts to reflect authentic shopping needs. Results reveal stark limitations of current LLMs: even state-of-the-art models achieve low performance (e.g., 11.22% for GPT-5, 3.92% for Gemini-2.5-Flash). These findings highlight a substantial gap between research benchmarks and real-world deployment, where LLMs make critical errors such as failure to identify unsafe product usage or falling for promotional misinformation, leading to harmful recommendations. ShoppingComp fills the gap and thus establishes a new standard for advancing reliable and practical agents in e-commerce.

TL;DR: 研究比较人类与大型语言模型对英语在线拼写变体（如funnnn vs. fun）的社会感知差异，发现两者在正式性、谨慎性和年龄三个维度上评分高度相关，但在评分分布和不同类型变体间存在差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 拼写变体影响文本和作者的社会感知（如是否非正式、作者是否年轻），研究旨在探究人类与LLMs对这种社会感知的一致性程度，验证LLMs是否能够准确捕捉语言的社会语言学特征。

Method: 基于社会语言学方法，比较LLMs与人类对英语在线拼写变体在三个关键社会属性（正式性、谨慎性、年龄）上的评分，分析评分分布和不同类型拼写变体间的差异。

Result: 人类与LLMs的评分总体上呈现强相关性，但在评分分布和不同类型拼写变体比较时出现显著差异，表明LLMs虽然能捕捉主要趋势，但在细节感知上仍与人类存在偏差。

Conclusion: LLMs在感知拼写变体的社会属性方面与人类有较高一致性，但在细微社会语言学特征上仍需改进，这对LLMs的社会语言学理解和应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Spelling variation (e.g. funnnn vs. fun) can influence the social perception of texts and their writers: we often have various associations with different forms of writing (is the text informal? does the writer seem young?). In this study, we focus on the social perception of spelling variation in online writing in English and study to what extent this perception is aligned between humans and large language models (LLMs). Building on sociolinguistic methodology, we compare LLM and human ratings on three key social attributes of spelling variation (formality, carefulness, age). We find generally strong correlations in the ratings between humans and LLMs. However, notable differences emerge when we analyze the distribution of ratings and when comparing between different types of spelling variation.

Motivation: 准确确定历史文本的年代对于文化遗产收藏的组织和解释至关重要，需要开发可解释的时间文本分类方法。

Method: 整合五种特征类别：基于压缩的特征、词汇结构、可读性、新词检测和距离特征，使用特征工程的树基机器学习模型进行时间文本分类。

Result: 在大型语料库上，世纪尺度预测准确率达76.7%，十年尺度达26.1%；在宽松时间精度下，世纪top-2准确率达96.0%，十年top-10达85.8%；特征重要性分析显示距离特征和词汇结构最具信息性。

Conclusion: 树基模型提供了可扩展、可解释的时间文本分类替代方案，19世纪被识别为语言演化的关键转折点，但跨数据集评估揭示了领域适应挑战。

Abstract: Accurately dating historical texts is essential for organizing and interpreting cultural heritage collections. This article addresses temporal text classification using interpretable, feature-engineered tree-based machine learning models. We integrate five feature categories - compression-based, lexical structure, readability, neologism detection, and distance features - to predict the temporal origin of English texts spanning five centuries. Comparative analysis shows that these feature domains provide complementary temporal signals, with combined models outperforming any individual feature set. On a large-scale corpus, we achieve 76.7% accuracy for century-scale prediction and 26.1% for decade-scale classification, substantially above random baselines (20% and 2.3%). Under relaxed temporal precision, performance increases to 96.0% top-2 accuracy for centuries and 85.8% top-10 accuracy for decades. The final model exhibits strong ranking capabilities with AUCROC up to 94.8% and AUPRC up to 83.3%, and maintains controlled errors with mean absolute deviations of 27 years and 30 years, respectively. For authentication-style tasks, binary models around key thresholds (e.g., 1850-1900) reach 85-98% accuracy. Feature importance analysis identifies distance features and lexical structure as most informative, with compression-based features providing complementary signals. SHAP explainability reveals systematic linguistic evolution patterns, with the 19th century emerging as a pivot point across feature domains. Cross-dataset evaluation on Project Gutenberg highlights domain adaptation challenges, with accuracy dropping by 26.4 percentage points, yet the computational efficiency and interpretability of tree-based models still offer a scalable, explainable alternative to neural architectures.

Method: 开发了多种基于语言模型的分类器，用于英国ONS SOC和美国O*NET SOC系统。采用了集成模型，结合Google BERT和神经网络分类器，同时考虑职位标题、描述和技能信息。

Result: 集成模型在SOC第四层级（最细粒度）的分类准确率达到61%，在第三层级的准确率达到72%。这是目前最高的预测准确率。

Conclusion: 该模型能够利用职位广告提供及时准确的劳动力市场演变信息，为职业分类和劳动力需求分析提供了有效的自动化工具。

Abstract: Standard Occupational Classifiers (SOC) are systems used to categorize and classify different types of jobs and occupations based on their similarities in terms of job duties, skills, and qualifications. Integrating these facets with Big Data from job advertisement offers the prospect to investigate labour demand that is specific to various occupations. This project investigates the use of recent developments in natural language processing to construct a classifier capable of assigning an occupation code to a given job advertisement. We develop various classifiers for both UK ONS SOC and US O*NET SOC, using different Language Models. We find that an ensemble model, which combines Google BERT and a Neural Network classifier while considering job title, description, and skills, achieved the highest prediction accuracy. Specifically, the ensemble model exhibited a classification accuracy of up to 61% for the lower (or fourth) tier of SOC, and 72% for the third tier of SOC. This model could provide up to date, accurate information on the evolution of the labour market using job advertisements.

Method: 采用人机协作框架，选取《黄帝内经》四段核心理论文本，通过提示式认知支架引导DeepSeek V3.1识别隐喻和转喻，生成翻译。评估阶段用ChatGPT 5 Pro和Gemini 2.5 Pro模拟三类真实读者，对人工翻译、基线模型翻译和提示调整翻译进行五维度评分，并进行结构化访谈和解释现象学分析。

Result: 提示调整的LLM翻译在所有五个认知维度上表现最佳，具有较高的跨模型和跨角色一致性。访谈主题揭示了人工与机器翻译的差异、隐喻转喻传递的有效策略以及读者的认知偏好。

Conclusion: 本研究为中医等概念密集的古籍翻译提供了一条认知高效、可复制的人机协作方法论路径。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine theory is built on imagistic thinking, in which medical principles and diagnostic and therapeutic logic are structured through metaphor and metonymy. However, existing English translations largely rely on literal rendering, making it difficult for target-language readers to reconstruct the underlying conceptual networks and apply them in clinical practice. This study adopted a human-in-the-loop framework and selected four passages from the medical canon Huangdi Neijing that are fundamental in theory. Through prompt-based cognitive scaffolding, DeepSeek V3.1 was guided to identify metaphor and metonymy in the source text and convey the theory in translation. In the evaluation stage, ChatGPT 5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Pro were instructed by prompts to simulate three types of real-world readers. Human translations, baseline model translations, and prompt-adjusted translations were scored by the simulated readers across five cognitive dimensions, followed by structured interviews and Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results show that the prompt-adjusted LLM translations perform best across all five dimensions, with high cross-model and cross-role consistency. The interview themes reveal differences between human and machine translation, effective strategies for metaphor and metonymy transfer, and readers' cognitive preferences. This study provides a cognitive, efficient and replicable HITL methodological pathway for translation of ancient, concept-dense texts like TCM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 《梨俱吠陀》等古印度文本使用独特的音调重音系统（udātta、anudātta、svarita），但这些标记在现代电子文本中经常缺失，影响了文本的旋律和解释线索的保留

Method: 1. 创建带重音和不带重音的ślokas平行语料库；2. 比较三种自动重音标注策略：完整微调ByT5（字节级Transformer）、从头训练的BiLSTM-CRF序列标注基线、基于ByT5的LoRA参数高效微调

Result: 完整ByT5微调在所有指标上获得最低错误率；LoRA提供良好的效率-准确性权衡；BiLSTM-CRF作为透明基线。研究强调了重音恢复的实际需求：Unicode安全预处理、标记感知分词、分离字形和重音错误的评估

Conclusion: 为《梨俱吠陀》重音恢复建立了可复现的基准，为下游任务（重音感知OCR、ASR/吟唱合成、数字学术）提供指导，将文化遗产语言技术定位为连接计算建模与文献学、教学目标的NLP新兴领域

Abstract: The Rigveda, among the oldest Indian texts in Vedic Sanskrit, employs a distinctive pitch-accent system : udātta, anudātta, svarita whose marks encode melodic and interpretive cues but are often absent from modern e-texts. This work develops a parallel corpus of accented-unaccented ślokas and conducts a controlled comparison of three strategies for automatic accent placement in Rigvedic verse: (i) full fine-tuning of ByT5, a byte-level Transformer that operates directly on Unicode combining marks, (ii) a from-scratch BiLSTM-CRF sequence-labeling baseline, and (iii) LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning atop ByT5.
  Evaluation uses Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) for orthographic fidelity, plus a task-specific Diacritic Error Rate (DER) that isolates accent edits. Full ByT5 fine-tuning attains the lowest error across all metrics; LoRA offers strong efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, and BiLSTM-CRF serves as a transparent baseline. The study underscores practical requirements for accent restoration - Unicode-safe preprocessing, mark-aware tokenization, and evaluation that separates grapheme from accent errors - and positions heritage-language technology as an emerging NLP area connecting computational modeling with philological and pedagogical aims. Results establish reproducible baselines for Rigvedic accent restoration and provide guidance for downstream tasks such as accent-aware OCR, ASR/chant synthesis, and digital scholarship.

Method: 使用5个LLM（包括GPT-4和开源模型）在3个异构数据集上测试，采用两种提示策略（基础提示和包含语言心理学线索的增强提示）

Result: 增强提示减少无效输出并改善类别平衡，但引入系统性偏见；开放性和宜人性相对容易检测，外向性和神经质较难；开源模型有时接近GPT-4，但没有配置能产生一致可靠的预测

Conclusion: 当前现成的LLM尚不适合自动人格预测任务，需要仔细协调提示设计、特质框架和评估指标才能获得可解释的结果

Abstract: We evaluate large language models (LLMs) for automatic personality prediction from text under the binary Five Factor Model (BIG5). Five models -- including GPT-4 and lightweight open-source alternatives -- are tested across three heterogeneous datasets (Essays, MyPersonality, Pandora) and two prompting strategies (minimal vs. enriched with linguistic and psychological cues). Enriched prompts reduce invalid outputs and improve class balance, but also introduce a systematic bias toward predicting trait presence. Performance varies substantially: Openness and Agreeableness are relatively easier to detect, while Extraversion and Neuroticism remain challenging. Although open-source models sometimes approach GPT-4 and prior benchmarks, no configuration yields consistently reliable predictions in zero-shot binary settings. Moreover, aggregate metrics such as accuracy and macro-F1 mask significant asymmetries, with per-class recall offering clearer diagnostic value. These findings show that current out-of-the-box LLMs are not yet suitable for APPT, and that careful coordination of prompt design, trait framing, and evaluation metrics is essential for interpretable results.

Conclusion: Dripper通过创新的HTML简化、序列分类和受控解码机制，有效解决了现有方法在上下文窗口、推理成本和格式幻觉方面的限制，实现了高效准确的主要内容提取。

Abstract: Accurately and efficiently extracting main content from general web pages is of great significance for obtaining training data for large models. Using well-pre-trained decoder-only generative language models offers excellent document comprehension capabilities, thereby effectively enhancing parsing quality. However, it remains constrained by issues such as context window length, inference cost, and format hallucination. We present Dripper, an efficient HTML main content extraction framework powered by lightweight language models, which addresses these challenges through four key innovations: (1) We design a specialized HTML simplification algorithm that reduces input token count to 22\% compared to raw HTML while preserving critical structural information; (2) We reformulate main content extraction as a semantic block sequence classification task, significantly reducing inference cost; (3) We introduce a controlled decoding mechanism that strictly constrains the output space through logits processors, effectively eliminating hallucination issues common in small-scale models; (4) We propose WebMainBench, an evaluation dataset containing over 7,800 web pages with meticulously human-annotated main content extraction labels. Experimental results demonstrate that using only a 0.6B parameter model, Dripper achieves state-of-the-art performance across all evaluation benchmarks and outperforms all baseline methods, attaining an ROUGE-N F1 score of 81.58\%( 83.13\% with fall-back strategy) on our proposed WebMainBench dataset.

Method: 提出MGRS框架：1) 为给定问题生成多个多样化推理轨迹；2) 使用复合自验证和交叉验证策略精炼候选响应；3) 构建推理关系图并估计中间节点成功率；4) 计算累积成功率以选择最可靠答案和推理轨迹

Result: 在涵盖四个任务的六个基准数据集上，MGRS平均准确率达到82.9%，比最先进基线高出2.1%。在24点游戏中首次实现100%准确率，同时比领先的Forest of Thoughts框架快13.6倍

Conclusion: MGRS通过多样化轨迹生成、复合验证和图结构优化，显著提升了LLM推理增强方法的推理能力和计算效率，为复杂推理任务提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: The complex reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) poses a critical bottleneck for their practical applications. Test-time expansion methods such as Tree-of-Thought (ToT) and Graph-of-Thought (GoT) enhance reasoning by introducing intermediate reasoning structures, tree search, or graph-based exploration mechanisms. However, their reasoning strategies suffer from limited diversity, redundant search branches, and inadequate integration and error correction across heterogeneous reasoning paths. To address these limitations, we propose a novel reasoning framework called Multi-chain Graph Refinement & Selection (MGRS), which first generates multiple diverse reasoning trajectories for a given problem, refines candidate responses using a composite self- and cross-verification strategy, then constructs a reasoning relation graph and estimates the success rate of intermediate nodes, and finally computes cumulative success rates to select the most reliable answer and corresponding reasoning trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that MGRS significantly advances both the reasoning capability and computational efficiency of reasoning enhancement methods. Across six benchmark datasets spanning four distinct tasks, MGRS achieves an average accuracy of 82.9%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin of 2.1%. Remarkably, on the 24-point game, MGRS attains 100% accuracy for the first time, while delivering a 13.6x speed-up compared to the leading Forest of Thoughts framework.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了PSP数据集，用于分析LLMs拒绝回答行为背后的动机是安全考量还是政治审查，发现大多数LLMs都存在某种形式的审查行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏对LLMs拒绝回答有害内容行为背后动机的系统分析，难以区分是真正的安全政策还是政治审查。需要明确LLMs拒绝行为是否反映了全球各国实践的政治审查。

Method: 构建PSP数据集，包含来自互联网的两个数据源：中国敏感提示扩展到多个国家，以及各国被审查的推文。采用数据驱动方法（使PSP隐含）和表示层面方法（消除政治概念），并研究模型在PSP上的漏洞通过提示注入攻击。

Result: 研究发现大多数LLMs都存在某种形式的审查行为。通过将审查与对隐含意图内容的拒绝相关联，揭示了模型拒绝行为与政治敏感性的关系。总结了导致不同模型和国家背景下拒绝分布变化的主要属性。

Conclusion: LLMs的拒绝行为确实反映了政治审查实践，而不仅仅是安全考量。需要更透明地理解模型拒绝机制，并关注不同国家背景下的审查差异。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to refuse to respond to harmful content. However, systematic analyses of whether this behavior is truly a reflection of its safety policies or an indication of political censorship, that is practiced globally by countries, is lacking. Differentiating between safety influenced refusals or politically motivated censorship is hard and unclear. For this purpose we introduce PSP, a dataset built specifically to probe the refusal behaviors in LLMs from an explicitly political context. PSP is built by formatting existing censored content from two data sources, openly available on the internet: sensitive prompts in China generalized to multiple countries, and tweets that have been censored in various countries. We study: 1) impact of political sensitivity in seven LLMs through data-driven (making PSP implicit) and representation-level approaches (erasing the concept of politics); and, 2) vulnerability of models on PSP through prompt injection attacks (PIAs). Associating censorship with refusals on content with masked implicit intent, we find that most LLMs perform some form of censorship. We conclude with summarizing major attributes that can cause a shift in refusal distributions across models and contexts of different countries.

TL;DR: 本文提出一个结合推理生成和列表偏好优化的框架，用于改进方面情感四元组预测任务，通过生成自然语言解释和优化结构有效性来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于标记的预测方法难以建模元素间复杂关系，且在标准监督微调下对高阶元素（如类别和情感极性）预测性能下降明显，需要更有效的推理和关系建模方法。

Method: 1) 采用基于推理的生成方法，在统一模板中输出四元组和自然语言解释；2) 引入列表偏好优化框架，通过句法和语义邻近生成混淆候选，训练模型偏好黄金候选而非竞争替代项。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，该框架有效提高了四元组预测准确性和解释一致性。

Conclusion: 提出的推理生成与列表偏好优化相结合的方法能够更好地建模元素间关系，提升ASQP任务的结构有效性和关系连贯性。

Abstract: Aspect sentiment quad prediction (ASQP) is inherently challenging to predict a structured quadruple with four core sentiment elements, including aspect term (a), aspect category (c), opinion term (o), and sentiment polarity (s). Prior methods relying on marker-based prediction struggle with modeling the intricate relationships among elements and experience sharp performance declines when predicting higher-order elements (e.g., c and s) under standard supervised fine-tuning. To address these limitations, we employ reasoning-based generation to output both the quadruple and a natural language rationale under element prefixes within a unified template, encouraging explicit relational reasoning and interpretability. To further enhance element-wise alignment, we introduce a listwise preference optimization framework for improving structural validity and relational coherence. Specifically, we generate element-wise confusable candidates via syntactic and semantic proximity, then train the model with listwise objectives to prefer the gold candidates over closely competing alternatives. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively improves quadruple prediction accuracy and explanation consistency.

TL;DR: TWEO通过简单的损失函数消除Transformer训练中的极端异常值，实现全模型FP8训练，无需工程技巧或架构修改，提升训练吞吐量36%，并首次实现W8A8静态量化的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代硬件原生支持FP8对训练大型Transformer至关重要，但极端激活异常值严重阻碍了FP8的使用。现有解决方案要么依赖复杂的混合精度工程，要么需要侵入式架构修改。本文挑战了异常值是数据驱动的传统观念。

Method: 论文发现极端异常值是训练过程中机械产生的伪影，源于权重矩阵的特定结构特性（共线性）。基于此洞察，提出TWEO（Transformers Without Extreme Outliers），一种非侵入式的损失函数，通过简单的损失项有效防止极端异常值。

Result: TWEO将异常值从10000+减少到小于20，实现全模型FP8预训练（LLM和ViT），在标准FP8训练灾难性崩溃时，性能与BF16基线相当，训练吞吐量提升36%。同时首次实现硬件友好的W8A8每张量静态量化的SOTA性能。

Conclusion: TWEO通过简单的损失函数解决了Transformer训练中的极端异常值问题，无需复杂工程或架构修改，实现了高效的FP8训练和新的量化范式，为大规模Transformer训练提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Native FP8 support in modern hardware is essential for training large Transformers, but is severely hindered by extreme activation outliers. Existing solutions either rely on complex mixed-precision engineering or invasive architectural modifications. This paper fundamentally challenges the conventional wisdom that outliers are data-driven. We demonstrate that extreme outliers are a data-independent, mechanically-produced artifact of training, originating from specific structural properties of the weight matrices (i.e., colinearity). Based on this insight, we propose TWEO (Transformers Without Extreme Outliers), a novel, non-invasive loss function. TWEO effectively prevents extreme outliers via a very simple loss term, which reduces outliers from 10000+ to less than 20. TWEO then enables full-model FP8 pre-training with neither engineering tricks nor architectural changes for both LLM and ViT. When standard FP8 training catastrophically collapses, TWEO achieves performance comparable to the BF16 baseline while delivering a 36% increase in training throughput. Also, TWEO enables a new quantization paradigm. Hardware-friendly W8A8 per-tensor static quantization of LLMs, previously considered completely unusable due to outliers, achieves SOTA performance for the first time on TWEO-trained models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对印地语旅游领域缺乏语言特定和文化敏感的问答系统资源，特别是在瓦拉纳西这样的文化精神中心，需要为低资源领域开发专门的问答系统。

Method: 构建了包含7,715个印地语QA对的瓦拉纳西旅游数据集，通过Llama零样本提示扩展到27,455对。使用BERT和RoBERTa基础模型，采用监督微调(SFT)和低秩适应(LoRA)两种微调策略，评估多种BERT变体在低资源领域特定QA中的适用性。

Result: LoRA微调在减少98%可训练参数的同时达到85.3% F1分数，在效率和准确性间取得平衡。RoBERTa+SFT在捕捉文化嵌入术语（如Aarti、Kund）的上下文细微差别方面表现最佳。评估指标显示答案精确度和语言流畅性之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 为印地语旅游问答系统建立了基础基线，强调了LoRA在低资源设置中的重要性，并突出了旅游领域需要文化情境化的NLP框架。

Abstract: This article presents the first comprehensive study on designing a baseline extractive question-answering (QA) system for the Hindi tourism domain, with a specialized focus on the Varanasi-a cultural and spiritual hub renowned for its Bhakti-Bhaav (devotional ethos). Targeting ten tourism-centric subdomains-Ganga Aarti, Cruise, Food Court, Public Toilet, Kund, Museum, General, Ashram, Temple and Travel, the work addresses the absence of language-specific QA resources in Hindi for culturally nuanced applications. In this paper, a dataset comprising 7,715 Hindi QA pairs pertaining to Varanasi tourism was constructed and subsequently augmented with 27,455 pairs generated via Llama zero-shot prompting. We propose a framework leveraging foundation models-BERT and RoBERTa, fine-tuned using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to optimize parameter efficiency and task performance. Multiple variants of BERT, including pre-trained languages (e.g., Hindi-BERT), are evaluated to assess their suitability for low-resource domain-specific QA. Evaluation metrics - F1, BLEU, and ROUGE-L - highlight trade-offs between answer precision and linguistic fluency. Experiments demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning achieves competitive performance (85.3\% F1) while reducing trainable parameters by 98\% compared to SFT, striking a balance between efficiency and accuracy. Comparative analysis across models reveals that RoBERTa with SFT outperforms BERT variants in capturing contextual nuances, particularly for culturally embedded terms (e.g., Aarti, Kund). This work establishes a foundational baseline for Hindi tourism QA systems, emphasizing the role of LORA in low-resource settings and underscoring the need for culturally contextualized NLP frameworks in the tourism domain.

Motivation: 长系统提示导致推理延迟增加、计算成本上升、有效上下文长度减少，需要寻找替代方案

Method: 轻量级三阶段训练框架：1)通过重构训练[BE]编码原始提示内容；2)将提示下游行为蒸馏到该令牌；无需模型内部访问、辅助压缩模型或标注响应

Result: 单个[BE]令牌实现高达3000倍提示长度压缩，保持原始系统提示约98%的下游性能，显著降低推理成本并释放上下文窗口

Conclusion: 通过行为等效令牌[BE]可有效替代冗长系统提示，实现高效压缩同时保持性能，为LLM代理部署提供实用解决方案

Abstract: Carefully engineered system prompts play a critical role in guiding the behavior of LLM agents, but their considerable length introduces significant drawbacks, including increased inference latency, higher computational cost, and reduced effective context length. This raises the question of whether such lengthy prompts can be replaced by a drastically reduced number of tokens while preserving their behavioral effect on downstream tasks. To enable this, we propose a lightweight three-stage training framework that learns a single prompt-specific Behavior-Equivalent token ([BE]). The framework first trains [BE] to encode the natural-language content of the original system prompt via reconstruction, and then distills the prompt 's downstream behavior into this single token. Importantly, our method requires no access to model internals, no auxiliary compression models, and no labeled responses. Empirical evaluations on three datasets show that a single [BE] token achieves up to a 3000x reduction in prompt length, while retaining about 98% of the downstream performance of the original system prompts. This substantially reduces inference cost and leaves almost the entire context window available for user inputs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM代理与网站交互有多种接口方式（HTML浏览、RAG、MCP、NLWeb），但缺乏在统一控制环境下对这些架构的系统比较

Method: 创建包含四个模拟电商网站的实验平台，每个网站提供HTML、MCP和NLWeb接口，为每种接口开发专用代理执行相同任务集，使用GPT 4.1、GPT 5、GPT 5 mini和Claude Sonnet 4进行评估

Result: RAG、MCP和NLWeb代理在效果和效率上都显著优于HTML：平均F1从0.67提升到0.75-0.77，token使用从241k降至47k-140k，运行时间从291秒降至50-62秒。最佳配置是RAG+GPT 5（F1=0.87，完成率=0.79）

Conclusion: 网页交互接口的选择对LLM代理的效果和效率有重大影响，RAG、MCP和NLWeb是比传统HTML浏览更好的选择，其中RAG+GPT 5表现最佳，而考虑成本时RAG+GPT 5 mini提供了良好平衡

Abstract: Large language model agents are increasingly used to automate web tasks such as product search, offer comparison, and checkout. Current research explores different interfaces through which these agents interact with websites, including traditional HTML browsing, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over pre-crawled content, communication via Web APIs using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and natural-language querying through the NLWeb interface. However, no prior work has compared these four architectures within a single controlled environment using identical tasks.
  To address this gap, we introduce a testbed consisting of four simulated e-shops, each offering its products via HTML, MCP, and NLWeb interfaces. For each interface (HTML, RAG, MCP, and NLWeb) we develop specialized agents that perform the same sets of tasks, ranging from simple product searches and price comparisons to complex queries for complementary or substitute products and checkout processes. We evaluate the agents using GPT 4.1, GPT 5, GPT 5 mini, and Claude Sonnet 4 as underlying LLM. Our evaluation shows that the RAG, MCP and NLWeb agents outperform HTML on both effectiveness and efficiency. Averaged over all tasks, F1 rises from 0.67 for HTML to between 0.75 and 0.77 for the other agents. Token usage falls from about 241k for HTML to between 47k and 140k per task. The runtime per task drops from 291 seconds to between 50 and 62 seconds. The best overall configuration is RAG with GPT 5 achieving an F1 score of 0.87 and a completion rate of 0.79. Also taking cost into consideration, RAG with GPT 5 mini offers a good compromise between API usage fees and performance. Our experiments show the choice of the interaction interface has a substantial impact on both the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM-based web agents.

Motivation: 构建"能记住的机器"需要解决超长上下文建模问题，这要求具备稀疏性、随机访问灵活性和长度泛化三个关键特性。

Method: 提出分层稀疏注意力机制，集成到Transformer中构建HSA-UltraLong模型，采用8B参数的MoE架构，在超过8万亿token上进行训练。

Result: 模型在领域内长度任务上与全注意力基线表现相当，在长达16M的上下文检索任务中大多数情况下达到90%以上准确率。

Conclusion: HSA-UltraLong为超长上下文建模提供了基础框架，实验洞察为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: This work explores the challenge of building ``Machines that Can Remember'', framing long-term memory as the problem of efficient ultra-long context modeling. We argue that this requires three key properties: \textbf{sparsity}, \textbf{random-access flexibility}, and \textbf{length generalization}. To address ultra-long-context modeling, we leverage Hierarchical Sparse Attention (HSA), a novel attention mechanism that satisfies all three properties. We integrate HSA into Transformers to build HSA-UltraLong, which is an 8B-parameter MoE model trained on over 8 trillion tokens and is rigorously evaluated on different tasks with in-domain and out-of-domain context lengths to demonstrate its capability in handling ultra-long contexts. Results show that our model performs comparably to full-attention baselines on in-domain lengths while achieving over 90\% accuracy on most in-context retrieval tasks with contexts up to 16M. This report outlines our experimental insights and open problems, contributing a foundation for future research in ultra-long context modeling.

Result: 在挑战性语料库中，两种方案在官方结果中获得了前两名位置，在决策指标上表现突出。但分析显示区分高风险和低风险用户仍存在困难。

Conclusion: 需要探索改进数据解释和质量的策略，促进更透明可靠的早期风险检测系统，以更好地识别赌博相关障碍风险。

Abstract: Gambling disorder is a complex behavioral addiction that is challenging to understand and address, with severe physical, psychological, and social consequences. Early Risk Detection (ERD) on the Web has become a key task in the scientific community for identifying early signs of mental health behaviors based on social media activity. This work presents our participation in the MentalRiskES 2025 challenge, specifically in Task 1, aimed at classifying users at high or low risk of developing a gambling-related disorder. We proposed three methods based on a CPI+DMC approach, addressing predictive effectiveness and decision-making speed as independent objectives. The components were implemented using the SS3, BERT with extended vocabulary, and SBERT models, followed by decision policies based on historical user analysis. Although it was a challenging corpus, two of our proposals achieved the top two positions in the official results, performing notably in decision metrics. Further analysis revealed some difficulty in distinguishing between users at high and low risk, reinforcing the need to explore strategies to improve data interpretation and quality, and to promote more transparent and reliable ERD systems for mental disorders.

Abstract: Knowledge-enhanced text generation aims to enhance the quality of generated text by utilizing internal or external knowledge sources. While language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating coherent and fluent text, the lack of interpretability presents a substantial obstacle. The limited interpretability of generated text significantly impacts its practical usability, particularly in knowledge-enhanced text generation tasks that necessitate reliability and explainability. Existing methods often employ domain-specific knowledge retrievers that are tailored to specific data characteristics, limiting their generalizability to diverse data types and tasks. To overcome this limitation, we directly leverage the two-tier architecture of structured knowledge, consisting of high-level entities and low-level knowledge triples, to design our task-agnostic structured knowledge hunter. Specifically, we employ a local-global interaction scheme for structured knowledge representation learning and a hierarchical transformer-based pointer network as the backbone for selecting relevant knowledge triples and entities. By combining the strong generative ability of language models with the high faithfulness of the knowledge hunter, our model achieves high interpretability, enabling users to comprehend the model output generation process. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both internal knowledge-enhanced table-to-text generation on the RotoWireFG dataset and external knowledge-enhanced dialogue response generation on the KdConv dataset. Our task-agnostic model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and corresponding language models, setting new standards on the benchmark.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multilingual speech processing, African languages remain under-represented in both research and deployed systems, particularly when it comes to strong, open-weight encoders that transfer well under low-resource supervision. Self-supervised learning has proven especially promising in such settings, yet most publicly released models targeting African speech remain at BASE scale, leaving unanswered whether larger encoders, trained exclusively on Africa-centric audio, offer tangible benefits and how model capacity interacts with data composition. This work addresses that gap by introducing SSA-HuBERT-Large (317M parameters) and SSA-HuBERT-XL (964M parameters), the first large models trained solely on African speech, alongside a BASE size counterpart. We release these models as open weights: see https://huggingface.co/collections/Orange/african-speech-foundation-models. By conducting a carefully controlled experimental study focused exclusively on Sub-Saharan languages, covering automatic speech recognition (ASR) and language identification (LID) tasks, we demonstrate that larger architectures significantly improve performance by effectively leveraging large audio datasets.

Conclusion: 注意力分析能有效识别多模态语言模型中的重要组件，为参数高效微调提供指导，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算成本

Abstract: Modern large language models become multimodal, analyzing various data formats like text and images. While fine-tuning is effective for adapting these multimodal language models (MLMs) to downstream tasks, full fine-tuning is computationally expensive. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this by training only a small portion of model weights. However, MLMs are difficult to interpret, making it challenging to identify which components are most effective for training to balance efficiency and performance. We propose an attention-based interpretability method for MLMs by analyzing attention scores relative to image tokens. The core idea is to identify attention heads that focus on image key objects. We utilize this information to select optimal model components for PEFT in multimodal models. Our contributions include a method for identifying attention heads associated with image key objects, its application to PEFT for image captioning, and the creation of a new dataset containing images, key object masks, and their textual descriptions. We conducted experiments on MLMs with 2-3 billion parameters to validate the method's effectiveness. By calculating Head Impact (HI) scores we quantify an attention head's focus on key objects, indicating its significance in image understanding. Our fine-tuning experiments demonstrate that adapting layers with the highest HI scores leads to the most significant shifts in metrics compared to pre-trained, randomly selected, or lowest-HI-score layers. This indicates that fine-tuning a small percentage (around 0.01%) of parameters in these crucial layers can substantially influence image understanding capabilities.

Motivation: 研究发现DPO训练中偏好对经常包含相同或语义相似的内容（模糊内容），这些内容可能引入歧义，限制对齐效果的进一步提升

Method: 提出Ambiguity Awareness Optimization (AAO)，通过计算偏好对中的语义相似度来自动重加权模糊内容以减少歧义

Result: AAO在多个模型规模和基准数据集上一致且显著超越现有方法，在AlpacaEval 2上比DPO提升8.9分，在Arena-Hard上提升15.0分

Conclusion: 模糊内容确实会降低DPO性能，AAO通过减少歧义有效提升了模型对齐效果，是一种简单而有效的方法

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) method across various domains. Recent research has increasingly focused on the role of token importance in improving DPO effectiveness. It is observed that identical or semantically similar content (defined as ambiguous content) frequently appears within the preference pairs. We hypothesize that the presence of ambiguous content during DPO training may introduce ambiguity, thereby limiting further improvements in alignment. Through mathematical analysis and proof-of-concept experiments, we reveal that ambiguous content may potentially introduce ambiguities, thereby degrading performance. To address this issue, we introduce Ambiguity Awareness Optimization (AAO), a simple yet effective approach that automatically re-weights ambiguous content to reduce ambiguities by calculating semantic similarity from preference pairs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AAO consistently and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in performance, without markedly increasing response length, across multiple model scales and widely adopted benchmark datasets, including AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard. Specifically, AAO outperforms DPO by up to 8.9 points on AlpacaEval 2 and achieves an improvement of by up to 15.0 points on Arena-Hard.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伊朗中小企业越来越多地使用Telegram进行销售，但为低资源语言（如波斯语）开发AI聊天机器人需要大量高质量问答数据集，这些数据集通常昂贵且资源密集。

Method: 提出新颖的自动化多智能体架构，从活跃的Telegram购物频道收集数据，生成人物感知的问答对。系统包含专门的问题生成、验证和精炼智能体，确保生成真实多样的对话数据。

Result: 使用GPT-5.1在六个质量维度上评估，智能体架构在5个不同频道中的4个优于传统RAG模型，展示了无需昂贵人工标注或复杂微调即可生成可扩展高质量数据集的能力。

Conclusion: MegaChat为中小企业提供了在专业商业领域构建智能客户参与系统的高效、经济解决方案，推动了低资源语言多语言对话AI的进步。

Abstract: Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Iran increasingly leverage Telegram for sales, where real-time engagement is essential for conversion. However, developing AI-driven chatbots for this purpose requires large, high-quality question-and-answer (Q&A) datasets, which are typically expensive and resource-intensive to produce, especially for low-resource languages like Persian. In this paper, we introduce MegaChat, the first fully synthetic Persian Q&A dataset designed to evaluate intelligent sales chatbots in Telegram-based e-commerce. We propose a novel, automated multi-agent architecture that generates persona-aware Q&A pairs by collecting data from active Telegram shopping channels. The system employs specialized agents for question generation, validation, and refinement, ensuring the production of realistic and diverse conversational data. To evaluate answer generation, we compare three classic retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models with our advanced agentic system, which features multi-query retrieval, reranking, and persona-aligned response synthesis. Using GPT-5.1 for evaluation across six quality dimensions, our results show that the agentic architecture outperformed traditional RAG models in 4 out of 5 diverse channels, demonstrating its ability to generate scalable, high-quality datasets without relying on expensive human annotation or complex fine-tuning. MegaChat provides SMEs with an efficient, cost-effective solution for building intelligent customer engagement systems in specialized commercial domains, enabling advancements in multilingual conversational AI for low-resource languages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SO-Bench：首个系统性评估MLLMs视觉结构化输出能力的基准，覆盖UI界面、自然图像、文档和图表四大视觉领域，包含6.5K个JSON模式和1.8K个图像-模式对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏系统评估多模态大语言模型在视觉输入上进行模式驱动的信息抽取和推理能力的基准，而MLLMs在现实代理场景中需要生成符合预定义数据模式的正确输出。

Method: 设计SO-Bench基准，涵盖四大视觉领域，从6.5K个多样化JSON模式和1.8K个人工验证的图像-模式对构建，对开源和前沿专有模型进行基准测试，并进行训练实验改进模型的结构化输出能力。

Result: 基准测试显示现有模型在预测准确、符合模式要求的输出方面存在持续差距，凸显了改进多模态结构化推理的需求。训练实验表明可以显著提升模型的结构化输出能力。

Conclusion: SO-Bench填补了视觉结构化输出评估的空白，揭示了当前MLLMs的局限性，并为改进多模态结构化推理提供了基准和训练方法。该基准将向社区开放。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world, agentic settings where outputs must not only be correct, but also conform to predefined data schemas. Despite recent progress in structured generation in textual domain, there is still no benchmark that systematically evaluates schema-grounded information extraction and reasoning over visual inputs. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study of visual structural output capabilities for MLLMs with our carefully designed SO-Bench benchmark. Covering four visual domains, including UI screens, natural images, documents, and charts, SO-Bench is built from over 6.5K diverse JSON schemas and 1.8K curated image-schema pairs with human-verified quality. Benchmarking experiments on open-sourced and frontier proprietary models reveal persistent gaps in predicting accurate, schema compliant outputs, highlighting the need for better multimodal structured reasoning. Beyond benchmarking, we further conduct training experiments to largely improve the model's structured output capability. We plan to make the benchmark available to the community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需标签数据或额外训练的鞍点自由引导方法，通过利用对数密度估计的正曲率来指导基于分数的生成模型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有引导方法如Classifier-Free Guidance需要标签数据或训练额外模型，限制了在无标签数据或无法训练新模型场景下的应用

Method: SFG利用对数密度估计在鞍点区域的正曲率特性，维护最大正曲率估计来指导单个基于分数的模型，无需额外训练

Result: 在ImageNet-512无条件生成上达到SOTA的FID和FD-DINOv2指标；与Auto-Guidance结合时在FD-DINOv2上达到SOTA；在FLUX.1-dev和Stable Diffusion v3.5上提升输出多样性同时保持优秀的提示遵循和图像保真度

Conclusion: SFG提供了一种高效、无需额外训练的引导方法，显著提升基于分数模型的生成质量，为无标签数据场景提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Score-based generative models require guidance in order to generate plausible, on-manifold samples. The most popular guidance method, Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), is only applicable in settings with labeled data and requires training an additional unconditional score-based model. More recently, Auto-Guidance adopts a smaller, less capable version of the original model to guide generation. While each method effectively promotes the fidelity of generated data, each requires labeled data or the training of additional models, making it challenging to guide score-based models when (labeled) training data are not available or training new models is not feasible.
  We make the surprising discovery that the positive curvature of log density estimates in saddle regions provides strong guidance for score-based models. Motivated by this, we develop saddle-free guidance (SFG) which maintains estimates of maximal positive curvature of the log density to guide individual score-based models. SFG has the same computational cost of classifier-free guidance, does not require additional training, and works with off-the-shelf diffusion and flow matching models. Our experiments indicate that SFG achieves state-of-the-art FID and FD-DINOv2 metrics in single-model unconditional ImageNet-512 generation. When SFG is combined with Auto-Guidance, its unconditional samples achieve general state-of-the-art in FD-DINOv2 score. Our experiments with FLUX.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 indicate that SFG boosts the diversity of output images compared to CFG while maintaining excellent prompt adherence and image fidelity.

TL;DR: UniArt：基于扩散模型的端到端框架，从单张图像直接合成完全铰接的3D物体，统一编码几何、纹理、部件分割和运动学参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铰接3D物体对于真实模拟和具身机器人至关重要，但手动构建成本高且难以扩展，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 1. 建立统一潜在表示，联合编码几何、纹理、部件分割和运动学参数；2. 引入可逆关节到体素嵌入，将运动特征与体积几何空间对齐；3. 将关节类型预测公式化为开放集问题，无需固定关节语义。

Conclusion: UniArt提供了一种端到端的铰接3D物体生成方法，能够处理新颖关节类别和未见物体类型，为自动化3D资产创建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects play a vital role in realistic simulation and embodied robotics, yet manually constructing such assets remains costly and difficult to scale. In this paper, we present UniArt, a diffusion-based framework that directly synthesizes fully articulated 3D objects from a single image in an end-to-end manner. Unlike prior multi-stage techniques, UniArt establishes a unified latent representation that jointly encodes geometry, texture, part segmentation, and kinematic parameters. We introduce a reversible joint-to-voxel embedding, which spatially aligns articulation features with volumetric geometry, enabling the model to learn coherent motion behaviors alongside structural formation. Furthermore, we formulate articulation type prediction as an open-set problem, removing the need for fixed joint semantics and allowing generalization to novel joint categories and unseen object types. Experiments on the PartNet-Mobility benchmark demonstrate that UniArt achieves state-of-the-art mesh quality and articulation accuracy.

### [108] [PathReasoning: A multimodal reasoning agent for query-based ROI navigation on whole-slide images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21902)
*Kunpeng Zhang,Hanwen Xu,Sheng Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathReasoning：一种多模态推理代理，通过迭代推理和精炼在WSI中导航，将整张切片转换为问题引导的视图序列，无需密集像素级标注即可高效找到信息丰富的ROI。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WSI虽然提供了癌症的全面图像，但其巨大尺寸（超过100亿像素）使得导航到相应区域支持临床检查变得困难且耗时。病理学家通过采样、推理和自我反思的组合在WSI上进行导航，这启发了本研究的思路。

Method: 提出PathReasoning多模态推理代理，从随机采样的候选区域开始，通过自我反思审查当前选择，推理视觉观察与临床问题之间的对应关系，并建议新的探索区域。跨轮次构建推理链，逐步将注意力引导到诊断相关区域。

Result: 在亚型分析和纵向分析任务上，AUROC分别比强ROI选择方法高出6.7%和3.1%。高质量ROI进一步支持乳腺癌的准确报告生成，准确率比标准GPT-4o显著高出10%。

Conclusion: PathReasoning优先考虑问题特定区域并构建可解释的推理链，支持数字病理学中的高效切片审查、一致诊断解释、全面报告和证据可追溯性。

Abstract: Deciphering tumor microenvironment from Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is intriguing as it is key to cancer diagnosis, prognosis and treatment response. While these gigapixel images on one hand offer a comprehensive portrait of cancer, on the other hand, the extremely large size, as much as more than 10 billion pixels, make it challenging and time-consuming to navigate to corresponding regions to support diverse clinical inspection. Inspired by pathologists who conducted navigation on WSIs with a combination of sampling, reasoning and self-reflection, we proposed "PathReasoning", a multi-modal reasoning agent that iteratively navigates across WSIs through multiple rounds of reasoning and refinements. Specifically, starting with randomly sampled candidate regions, PathReasoning reviews current selections with self-reflection, reasoning over the correspondence between visual observations and clinical questions, and concludes by proposing new regions to explore. Across rounds, PathReasoning builds a reasoning chain that gradually directs attention to diagnostically relevant areas. PathReasoning turns each whole slide into a sequence of question-guided views, allowing the model to efficiently find informative ROIs within a fixed number of steps, without the need for dense pixel-level annotations. PathReasoning can substantially outperform strong ROI-selection approaches by 6.7% and 3.1% of AUROC on subtyping and longitudinal analysis tasks. The high-quality ROIs further support accurate report generation on breast cancer, significantly outperforming the standard GPT-4o by 10% in accuracy. PathReasoning prioritizes question-specific regions and constructs interpretable reasoning chains, supporting efficient slide review, consistent diagnostic interpretations, comprehensive reporting, and evidence traceability in digital pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM算法是一种无需训练的自适应rPPG方法，通过在线参数优化实现跨环境的心率监测，性能媲美监督学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有rPPG方法使用固定参数，在特定光照和相机设置下优化，难以适应多样化的部署环境，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出PRISM算法，通过信号质量评估进行在线参数自适应，联合优化光度去趋势和颜色混合，无需训练即可实时运行。

Result: 在PURE数据集上MAE为0.77 bpm，UBFC-rPPG上为0.66 bpm，5 bpm阈值下准确率分别为97.3%和97.5%，统计分析与监督学习方法性能相当。

Conclusion: 自适应时间序列优化显著提升了rPPG在不同条件下的性能，PRISM在保持实时CPU性能的同时达到了监督学习方法的水平。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) enables contactless vital sign monitoring using standard RGB cameras. However, existing methods rely on fixed parameters optimized for particular lighting conditions and camera setups, limiting adaptability to diverse deployment environments. This paper introduces the Projection-based Robust Signal Mixing (PRISM) algorithm, a training-free method that jointly optimizes photometric detrending and color mixing through online parameter adaptation based on signal quality assessment. PRISM achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods, with MAE of 0.77 bpm on PURE and 0.66 bpm on UBFC-rPPG, and accuracy of 97.3\% and 97.5\% respectively at a 5 bpm threshold. Statistical analysis confirms PRISM performs equivalently to leading supervised methods ($p > 0.2$), while maintaining real-time CPU performance without training. This validates that adaptive time series optimization significantly improves rPPG across diverse conditions.

TL;DR: 提出一种灵活的多模态原型框架，整合全切片图像和不完整基因组学数据用于精准肿瘤学，通过生物原型、多视图对齐、二分融合和语义基因组学插补四个关键组件解决模态异质性和数据缺失问题。

Motivation: 当前多模态方法整合组织学和基因组学数据面临表型和基因型异质性限制，影响模态内表示质量和模态间整合效果，且现有方法大多忽视基因组学数据部分缺失或完全不可用的真实临床场景。

Method: 提出四组件框架：1) 使用文本提示和原型加权进行生物原型构建；2) 通过样本级和分布级对齐实现多视图对齐；3) 二分融合捕捉共享和模态特定信息；4) 语义基因组学插补处理缺失数据。

Conclusion: 该灵活的多模态原型框架能有效整合全切片图像和不完整基因组学数据，为精准肿瘤学提供有力工具，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal approaches that integrate histology and genomics hold strong potential for precision oncology. However, phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity limits the quality of intra-modal representations and hinders effective inter-modal integration. Furthermore, most existing methods overlook real-world clinical scenarios where genomics may be partially missing or entirely unavailable. We propose a flexible multimodal prototyping framework to integrate whole slide images and incomplete genomics for precision oncology. Our approach has four key components: 1) Biological Prototyping using text prompting and prototype-wise weighting; 2) Multiview Alignment through sample- and distribution-wise alignments; 3) Bipartite Fusion to capture both shared and modality-specific information for multimodal fusion; and 4) Semantic Genomics Imputation to handle missing data. Extensive experiments demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art approaches on multiple downstream tasks.

TL;DR: AmodalGen3D：从稀疏遮挡视图进行完整3D物体重建的生成框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中从少量无位姿、部分遮挡视图重建3D物体具有挑战性，传统多视图或修复方法在遮挡严重时难以获得完整且几何一致的3D重建

Method: 整合2D完整化先验与多视图立体几何条件，采用视图间交叉注意力机制进行稀疏视图特征融合，以及立体条件交叉注意力模块推断未观测结构

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，AmodalGen3D在遮挡严重的稀疏视图设置下实现了优越的保真度和完整性

Conclusion: 该框架解决了机器人、AR/VR和具身AI应用中物体级3D场景重建的迫切需求

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D objects from a few unposed and partially occluded views is a common yet challenging problem in real-world scenarios, where many object surfaces are never directly observed. Traditional multi-view or inpainting-based approaches struggle under such conditions, often yielding incomplete or geometrically inconsistent reconstructions. We introduce AmodalGen3D, a generative framework for amodal 3D object reconstruction that infers complete, occlusion-free geometry and appearance from arbitrary sparse inputs. The model integrates 2D amodal completion priors with multi-view stereo geometry conditioning, supported by a View-Wise Cross Attention mechanism for sparse-view feature fusion and a Stereo-Conditioned Cross Attention module for unobserved structure inference. By jointly modeling visible and hidden regions, AmodalGen3D faithfully reconstructs 3D objects that are consistent with sparse-view constraints while plausibly hallucinating unseen parts. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that AmodalGen3D achieves superior fidelity and completeness under occlusion-heavy sparse-view settings, addressing a pressing need for object-level 3D scene reconstruction in robotics, AR/VR, and embodied AI applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAPVid-360：新任务要求预测视频序列中查询场景点的3D方向，即使这些点远在观察视频的狭窄视野之外，旨在促进学习无需4D场景模型训练的全中心场景表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类擅长构建全景心理模型，维持物体恒常性并推断视野外场景结构，而当前人工视觉系统在持久性全景理解方面存在局限，特别是在TAP任务中无法跟踪视野外的2D点。

Method: 利用360度视频作为监督源，将其重采样为窄视野视角，同时使用2D流程在全景中跟踪点来计算地面真实方向；提出TAPVid360-10k数据集和基准；基线方法适配CoTracker v3以预测每点旋转进行方向更新。

Result: 提出的基线方法优于现有的TAP和TAPVid 3D方法，展示了在预测视野外点方向方面的有效性。

Conclusion: TAPVid-360任务推动了全中心场景表示的学习，无需动态4D地面真实场景模型训练，为计算机视觉系统实现更接近人类的全景理解能力提供了新方向。

Abstract: Humans excel at constructing panoramic mental models of their surroundings, maintaining object permanence and inferring scene structure beyond visible regions. In contrast, current artificial vision systems struggle with persistent, panoramic understanding, often processing scenes egocentrically on a frame-by-frame basis. This limitation is pronounced in the Track Any Point (TAP) task, where existing methods fail to track 2D points outside the field of view. To address this, we introduce TAPVid-360, a novel task that requires predicting the 3D direction to queried scene points across a video sequence, even when far outside the narrow field of view of the observed video. This task fosters learning allocentric scene representations without needing dynamic 4D ground truth scene models for training. Instead, we exploit 360 videos as a source of supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across the full panorama using a 2D pipeline. We introduce a new dataset and benchmark, TAPVid360-10k comprising 10k perspective videos with ground truth directional point tracking. Our baseline adapts CoTracker v3 to predict per-point rotations for direction updates, outperforming existing TAP and TAPVid 3D methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WalkCLIP：一个多模态框架，整合卫星图像、街景图像和人口动态数据，通过GPT-4o生成图像描述学习步行性感知的视觉语言表示，用于预测城市步行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统步行性评估方法（调查和实地审计）成本高且难以扩展。现有单源方法（卫星图像、街景图像或人口指标）只能捕捉步行环境的一个维度：卫星数据缺乏行人视角，街景图像缺乏空间上下文，人口动态数据不包含环境视觉形态。

Method: WalkCLIP框架：1）从GPT-4o生成的图像描述中学习步行性感知的视觉语言表示；2）通过空间聚合模块整合邻域上下文来优化这些表示；3）将结果特征与人口动态基础模型的表示进行融合。

Result: 在明尼阿波利斯-圣保罗的4,660个地点进行评估，WalkCLIP在预测准确性和空间对齐方面均优于单模态和多模态基线方法。

Conclusion: 视觉和行为信号的整合能够可靠地预测步行环境，多模态方法比单源方法能更全面地捕捉城市步行性。

Abstract: Urban walkability is a cornerstone of public health, sustainability, and quality of life. Traditional walkability assessments rely on surveys and field audits, which are costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies have used satellite imagery, street view imagery, or population indicators to estimate walkability, but these single-source approaches capture only one dimension of the walking environment. Satellite data describe the built environment from above, but overlook the pedestrian perspective. Street view imagery captures conditions at the ground level, but lacks broader spatial context. Population dynamics reveal patterns of human activity but not the visual form of the environment. We introduce WalkCLIP, a multimodal framework that integrates these complementary viewpoints to predict urban walkability. WalkCLIP learns walkability-aware vision-language representations from GPT-4o generated image captions, refines these representations with a spatial aggregation module that incorporates neighborhood context, and fuses the resulting features with representations from a population dynamics foundation model. Evaluated at 4,660 locations throughout Minneapolis-Saint Paul, WalkCLIP outperforms unimodal and multimodal baselines in both predictive accuracy and spatial alignment. These results show that the integration of visual and behavioral signals yields reliable predictions of the walking environment.

Abstract: We introduce PAT3D, the first physics-augmented text-to-3D scene generation framework that integrates vision-language models with physics-based simulation to produce physically plausible, simulation-ready, and intersection-free 3D scenes. Given a text prompt, PAT3D generates 3D objects, infers their spatial relations, and organizes them into a hierarchical scene tree, which is then converted into initial conditions for simulation. A differentiable rigid-body simulator ensures realistic object interactions under gravity, driving the scene toward static equilibrium without interpenetrations. To further enhance scene quality, we introduce a simulation-in-the-loop optimization procedure that guarantees physical stability and non-intersection, while improving semantic consistency with the input prompt. Experiments demonstrate that PAT3D substantially outperforms prior approaches in physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and visual quality. Beyond high-quality generation, PAT3D uniquely enables simulation-ready 3D scenes for downstream tasks such as scene editing and robotic manipulation. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The precise reading recognition of pointer meters plays a key role in smart power systems, but existing approaches remain fragile due to challenges like reflections, occlusions, dynamic viewing angles, and overly between thin pointers and scale markings. Up to now, this area still lacks large-scale datasets to support the development of robust algorithms. To address these challenges, this paper first presents a new large-scale benchmark dataset for dial reading, termed RPM-10K, which contains 10730 meter images that fully reflect the aforementioned key challenges. Built upon the dataset, we propose a novel vision-language model for pointer meter reading recognition, termed MRLM, based on physical relation injection. Instead of exhaustively learning image-level correlations, MRLM explicitly encodes the geometric and causal relationships between the pointer and the scale, aligning perception with physical reasoning in the spirit of world-model perspectives. Through cross-attentional fusion and adaptive expert selection, the model learns to interpret dial configurations and generate precise numeric readings. Extensive experiments fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework on the newly proposed benchmark dataset. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/DialBench

Conclusion: PPBoost成功将弱文本线索转化为强空间指导，无需标注数据即可提升分割性能，且能泛化到多种视觉分割模型

Abstract: Text-prompted foundation models for medical image segmentation offer an intuitive way to delineate anatomical structures from natural language queries, but their predictions often lack spatial precision and degrade under domain shift. In contrast, visual-prompted models achieve strong segmentation performance across diverse modalities by leveraging spatial cues of precise bounding-box (bbox) prompts to guide the segmentation of target lesions. However, it is costly and challenging to obtain the precise visual prompts in clinical practice. We propose PPBoost (Progressive Prompt-Boosting), a framework that bridges these limitations by transforming weak text-derived signals into strong, spatially grounded visual prompts, operating under a strict zero-shot regime with no image- or pixel-level segmentation labels. PPBoost first uses a vision-language model to produce initial pseudo-bboxes conditioned on the textual object descriptions and applies an uncertainty-aware criterion to filter unreliable predictions. The retained image-bboxes pairs are then leveraged to train a pseudo-labeled detector, producing the high-quality bboxes for the query images. During inference, PPBoost further refines the generated bboxes by appropriately expanding them to tightly cover the target anatomical structures. The enhanced spatially-grounding bbox prompts guide existing segmentation models to generate final dense masks, effectively amplifying weak text cues into strong spatial guidance. Across three datasets spanning diverse modalities and anatomies, PPBoost consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance over text- and visual-prompted baselines and, notably, surpasses few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data. PPBoost can generalize to multiple typical visual segmentation model backbones.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型虽然具备对话能力，但在提供实时交互式分步指导方面存在不足。有效的指导不仅需要提供指令，还需要检测执行成功、识别错误并及时提醒，这要求模型能够异步响应视频流，并需要包含用户错误和纠正的视频数据。

Conclusion: 该工作为实时交互式指导提供了首个专用基准和强基线模型，推动了多模态LLM在实时任务指导领域的发展，特别是错误检测和异步响应能力。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (LLM) have advanced conversational abilities but struggle with providing live, interactive step-by-step guidance, a key capability for future AI assistants. Effective guidance requires not only delivering instructions but also detecting their successful execution, as well as identifying and alerting users to mistakes, all of which has to happen in real-time. This requires models that are not turn-based, but that can react asynchronously to a video stream, as well as video data showing users performing tasks including mistakes and their corrections. To this end, we introduce Qualcomm Interactive Cooking, a new benchmark and dataset built upon CaptainCook4D, which contains user mistakes during task execution. Our dataset and benchmark features densely annotated, timed instructions and feedback messages, specifically including mistake alerts precisely timestamped to their visual occurrence in the video. We evaluate state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs on the Qualcomm Interactive Cooking benchmark and introduce LiveMamba, a streaming multi-modal LLM designed for interactive instructional guidance. This work provides the first dedicated benchmark and a strong baseline for developing and evaluating on live, situated coaching.

Motivation: Rectified Flow和Flow Matching等新技术显著提升了生成模型的性能，但由于理论、设计与现有扩散模型存在差异，现有加速方法无法直接应用于Rectified Flow模型。

Method: 从理论、设计和推理策略三个层面构建全面加速管道，采用新速度场的批处理、异构时间步批处理的向量化、动态TensorRT编译等新方法。

Conclusion: 提出的加速管道显著提升了基于流模型的生成效率，为Rectified Flow模型提供了有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: New technologies such as Rectified Flow and Flow Matching have significantly improved the performance of generative models in the past two years, especially in terms of control accuracy, generation quality, and generation efficiency. However, due to some differences in its theory, design, and existing diffusion models, the existing acceleration methods cannot be directly applied to the Rectified Flow model. In this article, we have comprehensively implemented an overall acceleration pipeline from the aspects of theory, design, and reasoning strategies. This pipeline uses new methods such as batch processing with a new velocity field, vectorization of heterogeneous time-step batch processing, and dynamic TensorRT compilation for the new methods to comprehensively accelerate related models based on flow models. Currently, the existing public methods usually achieve an acceleration of 18%, while experiments have proved that our new method can accelerate the 512*512 image generation speed to up to 611%, which is far beyond the current non-generalized acceleration methods.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型使用纯在线学习范式，容易强化表面连贯但临床不准确的推理路径，无法准确模拟临床医生渐进式视觉聚焦和迭代推理的诊断过程

Method: 1) 将专家视觉搜索轨迹转化为结构化行为信号；2) 设计注视引导推理导航器(GRN)，采用扫描和钻取双模式探索策略；3) 引入置信值采样器(CVS)平衡专家模仿与自主发现；4) 双流GRPO优化框架分离在线和离线学习信号

Result: 在多个医学VQA基准测试中平均性能提升+8.5%，验证了构建可解释医学AI系统的潜力

Conclusion: MedEyes通过结合离线专家指导和渐进式视觉推理，有效模拟临床诊断过程，显著提升医学视觉问答性能，为构建可解释的医学AI系统提供了新思路

Abstract: Accurate medical diagnosis often involves progressive visual focusing and iterative reasoning, characteristics commonly observed in clinical workflows. While recent vision-language models demonstrate promising chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), their purely on-policy learning paradigm tends to reinforce superficially coherent but clinically inaccurate reasoning paths. We propose MedEyes, a novel reinforcement learning framework that dynamically models clinician-style diagnostic reasoning by progressively attending to and interpreting relevant medical image regions. By incorporating off-policy expert guidance, MedEyes converts expert visual search trajectories into structured external behavioral signals, guiding the model toward clinically aligned visual reasoning. We design the Gaze-guided Reasoning Navigator (GRN) to emulate the diagnostic process through a dual-mode exploration strategy, scanning for systematic abnormality localization and drilling for detailed regional analysis. To balance expert imitation and autonomous discovery, we introduce the Confidence Value Sampler (CVS), which employs nucleus sampling and adaptive termination to create diverse yet credible exploration paths. Finally, the dual-stream GRPO optimization framework decouples on-policy and off-policy learning signals, mitigating reward assimilation and entropy collapse. Experiments demonstrate that MedEyes achieves an average performance improvement of +8.5\% across multiple medical VQA benchmarks, validating MedEyes's potential in building interpretable medical AI systems.

Conclusion: 该方法具有VLM无关性、无需训练、对分布偏移鲁棒、样本效率高等优势，能有效提高视觉语言模型的可靠性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have gained popularity for their strong open vocabulary classification performance, but they are prone to assigning high confidence scores to misclassifications, limiting their reliability in safety-critical applications. We introduce a training-free, post-hoc uncertainty estimation method for contrastive VLMs that can be used to detect erroneous predictions. The key to our approach is to measure visual feature consistency within a class, using feature projection combined with multivariate Gaussians to create class-specific probabilistic embeddings. Our method is VLM-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, demonstrates robustness to distribution shift, and works effectively with as few as 10 training images per class. Extensive experiments on ImageNet, Flowers102, Food101, EuroSAT and DTD show state-of-the-art error detection performance, significantly outperforming both deterministic and probabilistic VLM baselines.

Abstract: Understanding human instructions is essential for enabling smooth human-robot interaction. In this work, we focus on object grounding, i.e., localizing an object of interest in a visual scene (e.g., an image) based on verbal human instructions. Despite recent progress, a dominant research trend relies on using text as an intermediate representation. These approaches typically transcribe speech to text, extract relevant object keywords, and perform grounding using models pretrained on large text-vision datasets. However, we question both the efficiency and robustness of such transcription-based pipelines. Specifically, we ask: Can we achieve direct audio-visual alignment without relying on text? To explore this possibility, we simplify the task by focusing on grounding from single-word spoken instructions. We introduce a new audio-based grounding dataset that covers a wide variety of objects and diverse human accents. We then adapt and benchmark several models from the closely audio-visual field. Our results demonstrate that direct grounding from audio is not only feasible but, in some cases, even outperforms transcription-based methods, especially in terms of robustness to linguistic variability. Our findings encourage a renewed interest in direct audio grounding and pave the way for more robust and efficient multimodal understanding systems.

Conclusion: 提出的频域图像风格适应方法提供了一种简单而有效的UDA解决方案，无需复杂架构或对抗训练，在保持低计算开销的同时实现了显著的性能改进。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) greatly facilitates the deployment of neural networks across diverse environments. However, most state-of-the-art approaches are overly complex, relying on challenging adversarial training strategies, or on elaborate architectural designs with auxiliary models for feature distillation and pseudo-label generation. In this work, we present a simple yet effective UDA method that learns to adapt image styles in the frequency domain to reduce the discrepancy between source and target domains. The proposed approach introduces only a lightweight pre-processing module during training and entirely discards it at inference time, thus incurring no additional computational overhead. We validate our method on domain-adaptive object detection (DAOD) tasks, where ground-truth annotations are easily accessible in source domains (e.g., normal-weather or synthetic conditions) but challenging to obtain in target domains (e.g., adverse weather or low-light scenes). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance gains on multiple benchmarks, highlighting its practicality and effectiveness.

Method: 采用基于注意力机制的Transformer架构，使用稀疏占用表示，绕过BEV投影和显式几何先验，直接从原始图像特征端到端预测多帧未来占用。

Conclusion: 通过避免离散标记化和BEV表示的结构限制，提出的端到端Transformer架构能够更有效地捕捉时空依赖，为3D场景占用预测提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel architecture for trajectory-conditioned forecasting of future 3D scene occupancy. In contrast to methods that rely on variational autoencoders (VAEs) to generate discrete occupancy tokens, which inherently limit representational capacity, our approach predicts multi-frame future occupancy in an end-to-end manner directly from raw image features. Inspired by the success of attention-based transformer architectures in foundational vision and language models such as GPT and VGGT, we employ a sparse occupancy representation that bypasses the intermediate bird's eye view (BEV) projection and its explicit geometric priors. This design allows the transformer to capture spatiotemporal dependencies more effectively. By avoiding both the finite-capacity constraint of discrete tokenization and the structural limitations of BEV representations, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes benchmark for 1-3 second occupancy forecasting, outperforming existing approaches by a significant margin. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust scene dynamics understanding, consistently delivering high accuracy under arbitrary future trajectory conditioning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出图像条件流形正则化(ICM)方法，通过结合色彩图和Canny边缘的结构信息来正则化超分辨率输出，解决了传统文本条件流形与真实图像超分辨率任务不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实图像超分辨率方法通常使用文本条件扩散模型的生成先验进行正则化，但这存在两个关键问题：概念上与任务不匹配（真实超分辨率需要生成与低质量图像直接相关的高质量图像），以及实践中教师模型常产生颜色失真和边缘模糊的图像，表明其生成先验不适合该任务。

Method: 提出图像条件流形正则化(ICM)方法，不是直接使用密集的原始输入图像信息（会导致数值不稳定），而是正则化输出到基于稀疏但关键结构信息的流形上，具体结合色彩图和Canny边缘信息。

Result: 实验证实提出的正则化方法显著提升了超分辨率性能，特别是在感知质量方面，证明了其在真实世界应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: ICM方法提供了任务对齐且稳定的正则化信号，避免了密集条件的不稳定性，提高了最终超分辨率质量，为真实图像超分辨率任务提供了更合适的正则化方法。

Abstract: Real world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) often leverages the powerful generative priors of text-to-image diffusion models by regularizing the output to lie on their learned manifold. However, existing methods often overlook the importance of the regularizing manifold, typically defaulting to a text-conditioned manifold. This approach suffers from two key limitations. Conceptually, it is misaligned with the Real-ISR task, which is to generate high quality (HQ) images directly tied to the low quality (LQ) images. Practically, the teacher model often reconstructs images with color distortions and blurred edges, indicating a flawed generative prior for this task. To correct these flaws and ensure conceptual alignment, a more suitable manifold must incorporate information from the images. While the most straightforward approach is to condition directly on the raw input images, their high information densities make the regularization process numerically unstable. To resolve this, we propose image-conditioned manifold regularization (ICM), a method that regularizes the output towards a manifold conditioned on the sparse yet essential structural information: a combination of colormap and Canny edges. ICM provides a task-aligned and stable regularization signal, thereby avoiding the instability of dense-conditioning and enhancing the final super-resolution quality. Our experiments confirm that the proposed regularization significantly enhances super-resolution performance, particularly in perceptual quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-world applications. We will release the source code of our work for reproducibility.

Motivation: 现有基于Retinex理论的深度学习方法将反射物体视为理想Lambertian，忽略了镜面反射，且在图像空间构建物理约束，限制了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 基于Kubelka-Munk理论，保留镜面反射系数，在成像过程中重构物理约束，构建光照、反射和检测之间的三重物理约束(TPCs)理论，并在模型特征空间构建约束得到TPCNet。

Result: 综合定量和定性实验表明，这些约束有效提升了性能指标和视觉质量，无需引入新参数，TPCNet在10个数据集上优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过Kubelka-Munk理论构建的三重物理约束在特征空间有效改进了低光图像增强，为相关研究提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement is an essential computer vision task to improve image contrast and to decrease the effects of color bias and noise. Many existing interpretable deep-learning algorithms exploit the Retinex theory as the basis of model design. However, previous Retinex-based algorithms, that consider reflected objects as ideal Lambertian ignore specular reflection in the modeling process and construct the physical constraints in image space, limiting generalization of the model. To address this issue, we preserve the specular reflection coefficient and reformulate the original physical constraints in the imaging process based on the Kubelka-Munk theory, thereby constructing constraint relationship between illumination, reflection, and detection, the so-called triple physical constraints (TPCs)theory. Based on this theory, the physical constraints are constructed in the feature space of the model to obtain the TPC network (TPCNet). Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative benchmark and ablation experiments confirm that these constraints effectively improve the performance metrics and visual quality without introducing new parameters, and demonstrate that our TPCNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on 10 datasets.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited immense potential across numerous medical specialties; yet, dentistry remains underexplored, in part due to limited domain-specific data, scarce dental expert annotations, insufficient modality-specific modeling, and challenges in reliability. In this paper, we present OralGPT-Omni, the first dental-specialized MLLM designed for comprehensive and trustworthy analysis across diverse dental imaging modalities and clinical tasks. To explicitly capture dentists' diagnostic reasoning, we construct TRACE-CoT, a clinically grounded chain-of-thought dataset that mirrors dental radiologists' decision-making processes. This reasoning supervision, combined with our proposed four-stage training paradigm, substantially strengthens the model's capacity for dental image understanding and analysis. In parallel, we introduce MMOral-Uni, the first unified multimodal benchmark for dental image analysis. It comprises 2,809 open-ended question-answer pairs spanning five modalities and five tasks, offering a comprehensive evaluation suite to date for MLLMs in digital dentistry. OralGPT-Omni achieves an overall score of 51.84 on the MMOral-Uni benchmark and 45.31 on the MMOral-OPG benchmark, dramatically outperforming the scores of GPT-5. Our work promotes intelligent dentistry and paves the way for future advances in dental image analysis. All code, benchmark, and models will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Online handwriting generation (OHG) enhances handwriting recognition models by synthesizing diverse, human-like samples. However, existing OHG methods struggle to generate unseen characters, particularly in glyph-based languages like Chinese, limiting their real-world applicability. In this paper, we introduce our method for OHG, where the writer's style and the characters generated during testing are unseen during training. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Dual-branch Network with Adaptation (DNA), which comprises an adaptive style branch and an adaptive content branch. The style branch learns stroke attributes such as writing direction, spacing, placement, and flow to generate realistic handwriting. Meanwhile, the content branch is designed to generalize effectively to unseen characters by decomposing character content into structural information and texture details, extracted via local and global encoders, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DNA model is well-suited for the unseen OHG setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Video diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable progress in realism and controllability. However, achieving seamless video translation across different perspectives, such as first-person (egocentric) and third-person (exocentric), remains underexplored. Bridging these perspectives is crucial for filmmaking, embodied AI, and world models. Motivated by this, we present WorldWander, an in-context learning framework tailored for translating between egocentric and exocentric worlds in video generation. Building upon advanced video diffusion transformers, WorldWander integrates (i) In-Context Perspective Alignment and (ii) Collaborative Position Encoding to efficiently model cross-view synchronization. To further support our task, we curate EgoExo-8K, a large-scale dataset containing synchronized egocentric-exocentric triplets from both synthetic and real-world scenarios. Experiments demonstrate that WorldWander achieves superior perspective synchronization, character consistency, and generalization, setting a new benchmark for egocentric-exocentric video translation.

Conclusion: 该方法在脑龄估计中表现出色，探索性研究表明脑龄差与阿尔茨海默病和帕金森病的疾病严重程度相关，展示了其作为神经退行性疾病生物标志物的潜力。

Abstract: MRI-based brain age estimation models aim to assess a subject's biological brain age based on information, such as neuroanatomical features. Various factors, including neurodegenerative diseases, can accelerate brain aging and measuring this phenomena could serve as a potential biomarker for clinical applications. While deep learning (DL)-based regression has recently attracted major attention, existing approaches often fail to capture the continuous nature of neuromorphological changes, potentially resulting in sub-optimal feature representation and results. To address this, we propose to use supervised contrastive learning with the recent Rank-N-Contrast (RNC) loss to estimate brain age based on widely used T1w structural MRI for the first time and leverage Grad-RAM to visually explain regression results. Experiments show that our proposed method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.27 years and an $R^2$ of 0.93 with a limited dataset of training samples, significantly outperforming conventional deep regression with the same ResNet backbone while performing better or comparably with the state-of-the-art methods with significantly larger training data. Furthermore, Grad-RAM revealed more nuanced features related to age regression with the RNC loss than conventional deep regression. As an exploratory study, we employed the proposed method to estimate the gap between the biological and chronological brain ages in Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's disease patients, and revealed the correlation between the brain age gap and disease severity, demonstrating its potential as a biomarker in neurodegenerative disorders.

Conclusion: MoE3D通过混合专家框架有效解决了多模态3D理解中的模态异质性问题，显著提升了融合性能

Abstract: Multi-modal 3D understanding is a fundamental task in computer vision. Previous multi-modal fusion methods typically employ a single, dense fusion network, struggling to handle the significant heterogeneity and complexity across modalities, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose MoE3D, which integrates Mixture of Experts (MoE) into the multi-modal learning framework. The core is that we deploy a set of specialized "expert" networks, each adept at processing a specific modality or a mode of cross-modal interaction. Specifically, the MoE-based transformer is designed to better utilize the complementary information hidden in the visual features. Information aggregation module is put forward to further enhance the fusion performance. Top-1 gating is employed to make one expert process features with expert groups, ensuring high efficiency. We further propose a progressive pre-training strategy to better leverage the semantic and 2D prior, thus equipping the network with good initialization. Our MoE3D achieves competitive performance across four prevalent 3D understanding tasks. Notably, our MoE3D surpasses the top-performing counterpart by 6.1 mIoU on Multi3DRefer.

TL;DR: HyperST：一种在双曲空间中学习多级图像-基因表示的空间转录组学预测框架，通过层次化双曲对齐模块弥合模态差距，实现最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注点级图像-基因匹配，未能充分利用ST数据的完整层次结构，特别是基因表达侧的层次信息。同时存在信息不对称问题：基因表达包含更多分子细节，可能在组织学图像中缺乏明显的视觉对应物，需要复杂的表示学习方法来弥合模态差距。

Method: 1. 设计多级表示提取器，从每个模态捕获点级和生态位级表示，提供超越单个点级图像-基因对的上下文感知信息。2. 引入层次化双曲对齐模块，在双曲空间中统一这些表示，执行空间对齐的同时层次化构建图像和基因嵌入，丰富图像表示的分子语义。

Result: HyperST在来自不同组织的四个公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能，为更可扩展和准确的空间转录组学预测铺平了道路。

Conclusion: 通过在双曲空间中建模数据的固有层次结构，HyperST能够有效弥合组织学图像和基因表达之间的模态差距，显著提高跨模态预测性能，为空间转录组学预测提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) merges the benefits of pathology images and gene expression, linking molecular profiles with tissue structure to analyze spot-level function comprehensively. Predicting gene expression from histology images is a cost-effective alternative to expensive ST technologies. However, existing methods mainly focus on spot-level image-to-gene matching but fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure of ST data, especially on the gene expression side, leading to incomplete image-gene alignment. Moreover, a challenge arises from the inherent information asymmetry: gene expression profiles contain more molecular details that may lack salient visual correlates in histological images, demanding a sophisticated representation learning approach to bridge this modality gap. We propose HyperST, a framework for ST prediction that learns multi-level image-gene representations by modeling the data's inherent hierarchy within hyperbolic space, a natural geometric setting for such structures. First, we design a Multi-Level Representation Extractors to capture both spot-level and niche-level representations from each modality, providing context-aware information beyond individual spot-level image-gene pairs. Second, a Hierarchical Hyperbolic Alignment module is introduced to unify these representations, performing spatial alignment while hierarchically structuring image and gene embeddings. This alignment strategy enriches the image representations with molecular semantics, significantly improving cross-modal prediction. HyperST achieves state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets from different tissues, paving the way for more scalable and accurate spatial transcriptomics prediction.

TL;DR: PROMPTMINER：一种黑盒提示窃取框架，通过强化学习和模糊搜索两阶段方法，从生成图像中恢复原始文本提示，在多个数据集和扩散模型上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像生成模型的普及，精心设计的提示词已成为有价值的数字资产，面临安全与知识产权风险。现有提示窃取方法存在白盒访问、需要大规模标注数据或仅依赖字幕生成等限制，缺乏实用性和适应性。

Method: 提出PROMPTMINER框架，采用两阶段方法：1）基于强化学习的优化阶段重建主要主题；2）模糊驱动搜索阶段恢复风格修饰词。该方法无需梯度访问，是黑盒方法。

Result: 在多个数据集和扩散骨干网络上，PROMPTMINER达到CLIP相似度0.958和SBERT文本对齐度0.751，超越所有基线。对未知生成器的真实图像，CLIP相似度比最强基线高7.5%，展现良好泛化能力。在防御性扰动下仍保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PROMPTMINER为黑盒提示窃取提供了有效解决方案，在准确性和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法，既能用于恶意攻击检测，也能支持数据归属、模型溯源和水印验证等有益应用。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX can synthesize realistic, high-quality images directly from textual prompts. The resulting image quality depends critically on well-crafted prompts that specify both subjects and stylistic modifiers, which have become valuable digital assets. However, the rising value and ubiquity of high-quality prompts expose them to security and intellectual-property risks. One key threat is the prompt stealing attack, i.e., the task of recovering the textual prompt that generated a given image. Prompt stealing enables unauthorized extraction and reuse of carefully engineered prompts, yet it can also support beneficial applications such as data attribution, model provenance analysis, and watermarking validation. Existing approaches often assume white-box gradient access, require large-scale labeled datasets for supervised training, or rely solely on captioning without explicit optimization, limiting their practicality and adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose PROMPTMINER, a black-box prompt stealing framework that decouples the task into two phases: (1) a reinforcement learning-based optimization phase to reconstruct the primary subject, and (2) a fuzzing-driven search phase to recover stylistic modifiers. Experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion backbones demonstrate that PROMPTMINER achieves superior results, with CLIP similarity up to 0.958 and textual alignment with SBERT up to 0.751, surpassing all baselines. Even when applied to in-the-wild images with unknown generators, it outperforms the strongest baseline by 7.5 percent in CLIP similarity, demonstrating better generalization. Finally, PROMPTMINER maintains strong performance under defensive perturbations, highlighting remarkable robustness. Code: https://github.com/aaFrostnova/PromptMiner

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卷积神经网络随着深度增加存储和计算成本急剧上升，阻碍在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。现有ℓ_p范数剪枝方法仅考虑非结构化剪枝且计算效率低。

Method: 提出GoPrune方法，使用ℓ_{2,p}范数进行稀疏网络学习（p扩展到[0,1)区间），基于近端交替最小化算法开发高效优化方法，子问题具有闭式解。

Result: 在CIFAR数据集上使用ResNet和VGG模型进行实验，证明了该方法在网络剪枝方面的优越性能。

Conclusion: GoPrune通过ℓ_{2,p}范数和高效优化算法实现了有效的结构化剪枝，提高了压缩效率，适用于边缘设备部署。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) suffer from rapidly increasing storage and computational costs as their depth grows, which severely hinders their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. Pruning is a practical approach for network compression, among which structured pruning is the most effective for inference acceleration. Although existing work has applied the $\ell_p$-norm to pruning, it only considers unstructured pruning with $p\in (0, 1)$ and has low computational efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose an accelerated structured pruning method called GoPrune. Our method employs the $\ell_{2,p}$-norm for sparse network learning, where the value of $p$ is extended to $[0, 1)$. Moreover, we develop an efficient optimization algorithm based on the proximal alternating minimization (PAM), and the resulting subproblems enjoy closed-form solutions, thus improving compression efficiency. Experiments on the CIFAR datasets using ResNet and VGG models demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in network pruning.

TL;DR: Cue3D是一个模型无关的框架，用于量化单图像3D生成中各个图像线索的影响，通过系统扰动七种线索来评估七种最先进的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然深度生成模型在单图像3D生成方面取得了显著进展，但尚不清楚这些方法实际利用了哪些图像线索。需要系统分析不同线索对3D生成的影响。

Method: 开发Cue3D框架，通过系统扰动七种图像线索（阴影、纹理、轮廓、透视、边缘、局部连续性等），评估七种最先进的3D生成方法（回归式、多视图、原生3D生成范式）。

Result: 分析发现：形状意义性（而非纹理）决定泛化能力；几何线索（特别是阴影）对3D生成至关重要；模型过度依赖提供的轮廓；不同模型家族对透视和局部连续性线索的敏感性存在差异。

Conclusion: Cue3D揭示了现代3D网络如何利用传统视觉线索，为开发更透明、鲁棒和可控的单图像3D生成模型提供了方向。

Abstract: Humans and traditional computer vision methods rely on a diverse set of monocular cues to infer 3D structure from a single image, such as shading, texture, silhouette, etc. While recent deep generative models have dramatically advanced single-image 3D generation, it remains unclear which image cues these methods actually exploit. We introduce Cue3D, the first comprehensive, model-agnostic framework for quantifying the influence of individual image cues in single-image 3D generation. Our unified benchmark evaluates seven state-of-the-art methods, spanning regression-based, multi-view, and native 3D generative paradigms. By systematically perturbing cues such as shading, texture, silhouette, perspective, edges, and local continuity, we measure their impact on 3D output quality. Our analysis reveals that shape meaningfulness, not texture, dictates generalization. Geometric cues, particularly shading, are crucial for 3D generation. We further identify over-reliance on provided silhouettes and diverse sensitivities to cues such as perspective and local continuity across model families. By dissecting these dependencies, Cue3D advances our understanding of how modern 3D networks leverage classical vision cues, and offers directions for developing more transparent, robust, and controllable single-image 3D generation models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种耦合提示学习框架，通过引入外部监督提示来缓解视觉语言模型在视频任务微调中的语义空间收缩问题，从而提升模型的泛化能力。


<details>

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视频任务上进行微调时会损害模型对未见类别的泛化能力。现有方法通过正则化手工提示和软提示之间的差距来缓解遗忘效应，但这也会削弱软提示的学习能力。

Method: 提出了一种即插即用的耦合提示学习框架：1) 在文本提示中引入来自其他数据集的预训练提示作为硬提示标记，与软提示标记拼接并通过可学习的映射层耦合；2) 引入精心设计的无关视频集和负提示作为通用属性锚点，以保持预训练语义空间中属性的通用相关性。

Result: 在视频任务上的实验表明，该方法在泛化基准测试中显著优于最先进的提示调优方法，特别是在基础到新类别的预测任务上。

Conclusion: 通过竞争性提示方法和通用属性锚点的设计，有效缓解了微调过程中的语义空间收缩问题，保持了视觉语言模型在视频任务中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual and textual soft prompt tuning can effectively improve the adaptability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in downstream tasks. However, fine-tuning on video tasks impairs the model's generalization ability to unseen classes. Existing methods attempt to mitigate this forgetting effect by regularizing the gap between hand-crafted prompts and soft prompts, but this also weakens the learning ability of soft prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a plug-and-play coupling prompt learning framework to optimize the generalization performance of V-L models in video tasks, with the core motivation of mitigating semantic space narrowing during fine-tuning by introducing an externally supervised prompt. Specifically, for textual prompts, we introduce pre-trained prompts from other datasets as hard prompt tokens. These are concatenated with soft prompt tokens and coupled via a learnable mapping layer. This competitive prompting approach prevents the semantic space from overfitting to supervised categories. In addition, we introduce a set of well-designed irrelevant video sets and negative prompts as generic attribute anchors to maintain the generic relevance of the attributes in the pre-trained semantic space, thus preserving the generalization ability. Experiments on video tasks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art prompt tuning approaches across generalization benchmarks, particularly on base-to-new class prediction.

TL;DR: 提出虚拟墨水网络(VIN)，利用深度学习自动定位病理切片中的手术切缘，减少对物理墨水的依赖，实现标准化切缘评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前病理标本评估中，物理墨水标记存在应用不一致、热灼伤伪影掩盖真实切缘的问题，需要一种标准化、不依赖墨水的切缘定位方法。

Method: 使用冻结的基础模型作为特征提取器，配合紧凑的两层多层感知器进行斑块级分类，识别热灼伤相关特征。数据集包含120张H&E染色切片，由病理专家提供边界标注。

Result: 在20张未见过的切片上进行盲测，VIN生成连贯的切缘覆盖层，与专家标注定性一致。区域级准确率约73.3%，错误主要局限在不影响整体切缘图连续性的小区域。

Conclusion: VIN能够捕捉热灼伤相关的组织形态学特征，提供可重复、无需墨水的切缘划分，适合整合到常规数字病理工作流程中，用于后续切缘距离测量。

Abstract: Assessing resection margins is central to pathological specimen evaluation and has profound implications for patient outcomes. Current practice employs physical inking, which is applied variably, and cautery artifacts can obscure the true margin on histological sections. We present a virtual inking network (VIN) that autonomously localizes the surgical cut surface on whole-slide images, reducing reliance on inks and standardizing margin-focused review. VIN uses a frozen foundation model as the feature extractor and a compact two-layer multilayer perceptron trained for patch-level classification of cautery-consistent features. The dataset comprised 120 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained slides from 12 human tonsil tissue blocks, resulting in ~2 TB of uncompressed raw image data, where a board-certified pathologist provided boundary annotations. In blind testing with 20 slides from previously unseen blocks, VIN produced coherent margin overlays that qualitatively aligned with expert annotations across serial sections. Quantitatively, region-level accuracy was ~73.3% across the test set, with errors largely confined to limited areas that did not disrupt continuity of the whole-slide margin map. These results indicate that VIN captures cautery-related histomorphology and can provide a reproducible, ink-free margin delineation suitable for integration into routine digital pathology workflows and for downstream measurement of margin distances.

TL;DR: DualVLA提出了一种双阶段训练方法，通过数据剪枝和双教师自适应蒸馏策略，解决VLA模型在恢复推理能力时出现的动作性能退化问题，同时引入VLA Score进行细粒度评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在从专家模型扩展到通用模型时，虽然恢复了推理能力，但会出现动作性能退化（action degeneration）的问题。需要一种方法既能保持推理能力，又不牺牲动作执行精度。

Method: 1. 双层级数据剪枝：移除冗余的具身推理数据，防止其对动作学习产生负面影响；2. 双教师自适应蒸馏：为不同数据域分配不同的监督信号，在保持推理能力的同时强化动作生成；3. 提出VLA Score评估框架，从推理、意图、动作和对齐四个维度解耦评估VLA能力。

Result: DualVLA在SimplerEnv中达到61.0%的平均成功率，在八个竞争性多模态基准测试中获得65.4的平均分，在精确动作执行和多模态理解之间取得了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: DualVLA通过创新的数据剪枝和蒸馏策略，有效解决了VLA模型的动作退化问题，实现了动作性能和推理能力的更好平衡，为通用VLA模型的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: To build a generalizable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model with strong reasoning ability, a common strategy is to first train a specialist VLA on robot demonstrations to acquire reliable manipulation skills, and then incorporate mixed annotated robot data together with multimodal data to restore broader reasoning capabilities. However, we observe that the resulting reasoning VLA often suffers from degraded action performance compared to the specialist model before fine-tuning, a phenomenon we refer to as action degeneration. To address this issue, we propose DualVLA, which enhances action performance through carefully designed post-training while still preserving reasoning capability. We first introduce a dual-layer data pruning method that removes redundant embodied reasoning, preventing it from adversely influencing action learning. To further strengthen action generation, we design a dual-teacher adaptive distillation strategy that assigns different supervision signals to different data domains while maintaining reasoning ability. To fill the evaluation gap for generalist VLAs, we also propose VLA Score, which decouples VLA capability into reasoning, intention, action, and alignment dimensions for a more fine-grained assessment. Experiments show that DualVLA achieves an average success rate of 61.0 in SimplerEnv and an average score of 65.4 across eight competitive multimodal benchmarks, demonstrating a stronger balance between precise action execution and multimodal understanding.

Abstract: Large language models have revolutionized sign language generation by automatically transforming text into high-quality sign language videos, providing accessible communication for the Deaf community. However, existing LLM-based approaches prioritize semantic accuracy while overlooking emotional expressions, resulting in outputs that lack naturalness and expressiveness. We propose EASL (Emotion-Aware Sign Language), a multi-emotion-guided generation architecture for fine-grained emotional integration. We introduce emotion-semantic disentanglement modules with progressive training to separately extract semantic and affective features. During pose decoding, the emotional representations guide semantic interaction to generate sign poses with 7-class emotion confidence scores, enabling emotional expression recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that EASL achieves pose accuracy superior to all compared baselines by integrating multi-emotion information and effectively adapts to diffusion models to generate expressive sign language videos.

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, camera-based perception models are mostly trained on clear weather data. Models that focus on addressing specific weather challenges are unable to adapt to various weather changes and primarily prioritize their weather removal characteristics. Our study introduces a semantic-enabled network for object detection in diverse weather conditions. In our analysis, semantics information can enable the model to generate plausible content for missing areas, understand object boundaries, and preserve visual coherency and realism across both filled-in and existing portions of the image, which are conducive to image transformation and object recognition. Specific in implementation, our architecture consists of a Preprocessing Unit (PPU) and a Detection Unit (DTU), where the PPU utilizes a U-shaped net enriched by semantics to refine degraded images, and the DTU integrates this semantic information for object detection using a modified YOLO network. Our method pioneers the use of semantic data for all-weather transformations, resulting in an increase between 1.47\% to 8.80\% in mAP compared to existing methods across benchmark datasets of different weather. This highlights the potency of semantics in image enhancement and object detection, offering a comprehensive approach to improving object detection performance.

Abstract: Knee Osteoarthritis (KOA) is a musculoskeletal condition that can cause significant limitations and impairments in daily activities, especially among older individuals. To evaluate the severity of KOA, typically, X-ray images of the affected knee are analyzed, and a grade is assigned based on the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading system, which classifies KOA severity into five levels, ranging from 0 to 4. This approach requires a high level of expertise and time and is susceptible to subjective interpretation, thereby introducing potential diagnostic inaccuracies. To address this problem a stacked ensemble model of fine-tuned Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) was developed for two classification tasks: a binary classifier for detecting the presence of KOA, and a multiclass classifier for precise grading across the KL spectrum. The proposed stacked ensemble model consists of a diverse set of pre-trained architectures, including MobileNetV2, You Only Look Once (YOLOv8), and DenseNet201 as base learners and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) as the meta-learner. This proposed model had a balanced test accuracy of 73% in multiclass classification and 87.5% in binary classification, which is higher than previous works in extant literature.

Abstract: As a mainstream technique for 3D reconstruction, 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has been applied in a wide range of applications and services. Recent studies have revealed critical vulnerabilities in this pipeline and introduced computation cost attacks that lead to malicious resource occupancies and even denial-of-service (DoS) conditions, thereby hindering the reliable deployment of 3DGS. In this paper, we propose the first effective and comprehensive black-box defense framework, named RemedyGS, against such computation cost attacks, safeguarding 3DGS reconstruction systems and services. Our pipeline comprises two key components: a detector to identify the attacked input images with poisoned textures and a purifier to recover the benign images from their attacked counterparts, mitigating the adverse effects of these attacks. Moreover, we incorporate adversarial training into the purifier to enforce distributional alignment between the recovered and original natural images, thereby enhancing the defense efficacy. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively defends against white-box, black-box, and adaptive attacks in 3DGS systems, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both safety and utility.

Abstract: Talking face generation aims to synthesize realistic speaking portraits from a single image, yet existing methods often rely on explicit optical flow and local warping, which fail to model complex global motions and cause identity drift. We present IMTalker, a novel framework that achieves efficient and high-fidelity talking face generation through implicit motion transfer. The core idea is to replace traditional flow-based warping with a cross-attention mechanism that implicitly models motion discrepancy and identity alignment within a unified latent space, enabling robust global motion rendering. To further preserve speaker identity during cross-identity reenactment, we introduce an identity-adaptive module that projects motion latents into personalized spaces, ensuring clear disentanglement between motion and identity. In addition, a lightweight flow-matching motion generator produces vivid and controllable implicit motion vectors from audio, pose, and gaze cues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMTalker surpasses prior methods in motion accuracy, identity preservation, and audio-lip synchronization, achieving state-of-the-art quality with superior efficiency, operating at 40 FPS for video-driven and 42 FPS for audio-driven generation on an RTX 4090 GPU. We will release our code and pre-trained models to facilitate applications and future research.

Motivation: 现有基础模型如Aurora在东亚复杂地形区域预报准确性不足，且依赖非实时输入，无法满足公共卫生预警系统的实际需求。同时，标准点对点目标函数无法反映不对称的操作成本（误报损害公众信任，漏报危及人群健康）。

Method: 1) 构建并发布东亚地区的实时观测和高分辨率CMAQ-OBS数据集；2) 提出Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)方法，结合类别特定奖励和课程式rollout策略，使预测与操作优先级对齐。

Result: 1) 新数据集将区域误差降低59.5%，支持48-120小时实时预报；2) GRPO框架相比SFT基线将误报率降低47.3%，同时保持竞争力的F1分数，显著提升预报可靠性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过构建区域特定数据集和引入GRPO优化框架，有效解决了东亚地区PM浓度长期预报的挑战，为实际空气质量预报系统提供了可靠解决方案，特别适用于长提前期场景。

Abstract: Accurate long horizon forecasting of particulate matter (PM) concentration fields is essential for operational public health decisions. However, achieving reliable forecasts remains challenging in regions with complex terrain and strong atmospheric dynamics such as East Asia. While foundation models such as Aurora offer global generality, they often miss region-specific dynamics and rely on non-real-time inputs, limiting their practical utility for localized warning systems. To address this gap, we construct and release the real-world observations and high-resolution CMAQ-OBS dataset for East Asia, reducing regional error by 59.5% and enabling real-time 48-120 hour forecasts critical for public health alerts. However, standard point-wise objectives cannot reflect asymmetric operational costs, where false alarms deteriorate public trust while missed severe events endanger populations. This cost mismatch causes SFT models to over-predict and yield high False Alarm Rates. We introduce Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with class-wise rewards and curriculum rollout to align predictions with operational priorities. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves the reliability of the forecast. Compared to the SFT-only baseline, our model reduces the False Alarm Rate by 47.3% while achieving a competitive F1-score, proving its effectiveness for practical, real-world air quality forecasting systems on long lead time scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PS-CBM提出了一种部分共享概念瓶颈模型，通过多模态概念生成、部分共享概念策略和概念效率准确性指标，解决了现有CBM的视觉基础差、概念冗余和缺乏平衡指标三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM/VLM的自动概念生成方法存在三个根本问题：视觉基础差、概念冗余，以及缺乏平衡预测准确性和概念简洁性的原则性指标。

Method: PS-CBM包含三个核心组件：1) 多模态概念生成器，整合LLM语义和基于示例的视觉线索；2) 部分共享概念策略，基于激活模式合并概念以平衡特异性和简洁性；3) 概念效率准确性(CEA)指标，联合捕捉预测准确性和概念简洁性。

Result: 在11个多样化数据集上的实验表明，PS-CBM始终优于最先进的CBM，分类准确性提高1.0%-7.4%，CEA提高2.0%-9.5%，同时需要显著更少的概念。

Conclusion: PS-CBM在实现高准确性和强可解释性方面表现出色，为解决概念瓶颈模型的现有挑战提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by introducing a layer of human-understandable concepts between inputs and predictions. While recent methods automate concept generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), they still face three fundamental challenges: poor visual grounding, concept redundancy, and the absence of principled metrics to balance predictive accuracy and concept compactness. We introduce PS-CBM, a Partially Shared CBM framework that addresses these limitations through three core components: (1) a multimodal concept generator that integrates LLM-derived semantics with exemplar-based visual cues; (2) a Partially Shared Concept Strategy that merges concepts based on activation patterns to balance specificity and compactness; and (3) Concept-Efficient Accuracy (CEA), a post-hoc metric that jointly captures both predictive accuracy and concept compactness. Extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets show that PS-CBM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CBMs, improving classification accuracy by 1.0%-7.4% and CEA by 2.0%-9.5%, while requiring significantly fewer concepts. These results underscore PS-CBM's effectiveness in achieving both high accuracy and strong interpretability.

TL;DR: BrepGPT：基于Voronoi Half-Patch表示的单阶段自回归B-rep生成框架，统一几何与拓扑编码，实现高效CAD模型生成


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统B-rep生成方法因几何与拓扑元素复杂耦合而采用多阶段级联网络，导致误差累积和计算效率低下，需要更高效的单阶段解决方案

Method: 提出Voronoi Half-Patch表示法将B-rep分解为统一局部单元，使用双VQ-VAE编码顶点拓扑和VHP为顶点令牌，通过仅解码器Transformer自回归预测令牌并映射回完整B-rep

Result: 在无条件B-rep生成中达到最先进性能，并在多种条件生成任务（类别标签、点云、文本、图像）以及B-rep自动补全和插值中展现出色泛化能力

Conclusion: BrepGPT通过创新的VHP表示和统一编码策略，成功实现了高效的单阶段B-rep生成，为CAD模型生成提供了更优解决方案

Abstract: Boundary representation (B-rep) is the de facto standard for CAD model representation in modern industrial design. The intricate coupling between geometric and topological elements in B-rep structures has forced existing generative methods to rely on cascaded multi-stage networks, resulting in error accumulation and computational inefficiency. We present BrepGPT, a single-stage autoregressive framework for B-rep generation. Our key innovation lies in the Voronoi Half-Patch (VHP) representation, which decomposes B-reps into unified local units by assigning geometry to nearest half-edges and sampling their next pointers. Unlike hierarchical representations that require multiple distinct encodings for different structural levels, our VHP representation facilitates unifying geometric attributes and topological relations in a single, coherent format. We further leverage dual VQ-VAEs to encode both vertex topology and Voronoi Half-Patches into vertex-based tokens, achieving a more compact sequential encoding. A decoder-only Transformer is then trained to autoregressively predict these tokens, which are subsequently mapped to vertex-based features and decoded into complete B-rep models. Experiments demonstrate that BrepGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional B-rep generation. The framework also exhibits versatility in various applications, including conditional generation from category labels, point clouds, text descriptions, and images, as well as B-rep autocompletion and interpolation.

TL;DR: GRiP是一个两阶段训练框架，通过引导模型的感知焦点和逻辑路径来培养稳健灵活的视觉基础推理能力，在多个挑战性基准测试中取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态AI在"图像思维"方面面临困境：端到端强化学习不稳定，监督微调又过于僵化，导致模型要么难以学习，要么缺乏处理复杂现实场景所需的认知灵活性。

Method: GRiP采用两阶段训练框架，核心是认知增强的强化学习阶段，包含两个关键创新：1) 显著性加权IoU奖励，激励模型优先定位关键对象而非琐碎干扰物；2) 多启发式奖励，通过奖励多样但逻辑有效的推理路径来鼓励认知灵活性。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型初始化的GRiP在多个挑战性基准测试中取得显著性能提升，在TreeBench和V* Bench上达到开源模型中的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 超越简单奖励，通过认知启发的信号引导模型"看什么"和"如何思考"，对于解锁多模态智能的下一阶段至关重要。

Abstract: Models capable of "thinking with images" by dynamically grounding their reasoning in visual evidence represent a major leap in multimodal AI. However, replicating and advancing this ability is non-trivial, with current methods often trapped between the instability of end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) and the rigidity of supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This leads to models that either struggle to learn or lack the cognitive flexibility required for complex, real-world scenes. To navigate this dilemma, we introduce GRiP (Guided Reasoning and Perception), a novel two-stage training framework that cultivates robust and flexible visual grounded reasoning by explicitly guiding the model's perceptual focus and logical pathways. GRiP's core lies in its cognitive-enhanced RL stage, which features two key innovations: (1) a Salience-Weighted IoU Reward that incentivizes the model to prioritize the localization of mission-critical objects over trivial distractors, and (2) a Multi-Heuristic Reward that encourages cognitive flexibility by rewarding diverse yet logically valid reasoning pathways. Initialized from the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, GRiP demonstrates significant performance gains across multiple challenging benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models on the highly challenging TreeBench and V* Bench, proving its effectiveness in complex visual reasoning. Our work demonstrates that moving beyond simplistic rewards and instead guiding models with cognitively-inspired signals for what to see and how to think is crucial for unlocking the next level of multimodal intelligence. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Chebyshev谱图卷积和图注意力网络的GCN模型，用于多模态神经影像和表型数据的自闭症谱系障碍分类，在ABIDE I数据集上达到74.82%准确率和0.82 AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自闭症谱系障碍症状表现和神经基础存在差异，使得早期客观诊断非常困难。需要利用多模态神经影像和表型数据提高分类准确性。

Method: 使用图卷积网络模型，结合Chebyshev谱图卷积和GAT层。基于站点相似性构建群体图结构，采用多分支架构分别处理rs-fMRI、sMRI和表型数据，最后通过拼接融合。

Result: 在ABIDE I数据集（870名患者）上，通过五折交叉验证，测试准确率达到74.82%，AUC为0.82，优于传统GCN、自编码器深度神经网络和多模态CNN等基线方法。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态GCN模型能够有效整合神经影像和表型数据，提高ASD分类性能，为自闭症的客观诊断提供了有前景的计算方法。

Abstract: ASD is a complicated neurodevelopmental disorder marked by variation in symptom presentation and neurological underpinnings, making early and objective diagnosis extremely problematic. This paper presents a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) model, incorporating Chebyshev Spectral Graph Convolution and Graph Attention Networks (GAT), to increase the classification accuracy of ASD utilizing multimodal neuroimaging and phenotypic data. Leveraging the ABIDE I dataset, which contains resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI), and phenotypic variables from 870 patients, the model leverages a multi-branch architecture that processes each modality individually before merging them via concatenation. Graph structure is encoded using site-based similarity to generate a population graph, which helps in understanding relationship connections across individuals. Chebyshev polynomial filters provide localized spectral learning with lower computational complexity, whereas GAT layers increase node representations by attention-weighted aggregation of surrounding information. The proposed model is trained using stratified five-fold cross-validation with a total input dimension of 5,206 features per individual. Extensive trials demonstrate the enhanced model's superiority, achieving a test accuracy of 74.82\% and an AUC of 0.82 on the entire dataset, surpassing multiple state-of-the-art baselines, including conventional GCNs, autoencoder-based deep neural networks, and multimodal CNNs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MTR-VP方法，通过ViT编码器学习图像上下文嵌入，替代传统地图特征，用于自动驾驶轨迹规划，但发现视觉与运动特征结合效果有限，多轨迹预测能提升规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动驾驶轨迹规划依赖地图特征，本文探索使用视觉特征替代地图特征，将图像上下文嵌入与运动预测框架对齐，实现端到端的视觉基轨迹规划。

Method: 提出MTR-VP方法：使用ViT编码器处理原始图像和过去运动状态，生成上下文嵌入；采用交叉注意力机制结合意图和上下文嵌入；在Waymo数据集上评估，进行消融实验分析视觉特征和运动特征的结合效果。

Result: Transformer方法在结合视觉特征和运动特征生成有用场景上下文嵌入方面效果有限，即使使用CLIP和DINOv2增强意图嵌入；但预测多轨迹分布而非单一轨迹能显著提升规划性能。

Conclusion: 视觉特征替代地图特征在轨迹规划中具有潜力，但当前Transformer架构在融合视觉和运动模态方面存在局限；多轨迹预测是提升规划性能的关键因素。

Abstract: We present a method for trajectory planning for autonomous driving, learning image-based context embeddings that align with motion prediction frameworks and planning-based intention input. Within our method, a ViT encoder takes raw images and past kinematic state as input and is trained to produce context embeddings, drawing inspiration from those generated by the recent MTR (Motion Transformer) encoder, effectively substituting map-based features with learned visual representations. MTR provides a strong foundation for multimodal trajectory prediction by localizing agent intent and refining motion iteratively via motion query pairs; we name our approach MTR-VP (Motion Transformer for Vision-based Planning), and instead of the learnable intention queries used in the MTR decoder, we use cross attention on the intent and the context embeddings, which reflect a combination of information encoded from the driving scene and past vehicle states. We evaluate our methods on the Waymo End-to-End Driving Dataset, which requires predicting the agent's future 5-second trajectory in bird's-eye-view coordinates using prior camera images, agent pose history, and routing goals. We analyze our architecture using ablation studies, removing input images and multiple trajectory output. Our results suggest that transformer-based methods that are used to combine the visual features along with the kinetic features such as the past trajectory features are not effective at combining both modes to produce useful scene context embeddings, even when intention embeddings are augmented with foundation-model representations of scene context from CLIP and DINOv2, but that predicting a distribution over multiple futures instead of a single future trajectory boosts planning performance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 足部接触对人类运动理解至关重要，但现有方法使用零速度约束近似，只关注关节级接触，无法捕捉足部与地面的详细交互。密集足部接触估计对准确建模这种交互很关键，但从单张RGB图像预测密集足部接触仍未被充分探索

Method: 提出FEet COntact estimation (FECO)框架，包含鞋款风格对抗训练（强制鞋款风格不变特征）和地面特征提取器（基于空间上下文捕捉地面属性）

Result: 提出的方法实现了鲁棒的足部接触估计，不受鞋款外观影响，并能有效利用地面信息

Conclusion: FECO框架通过鞋款风格不变和地面感知学习，解决了密集足部接触估计中的鞋款外观多样性和地面单调外观挑战，为准确建模足部与地面交互提供了有效方案

Abstract: Foot contact plays a critical role in human interaction with the world, and thus exploring foot contact can advance our understanding of human movement and physical interaction. Despite its importance, existing methods often approximate foot contact using a zero-velocity constraint and focus on joint-level contact, failing to capture the detailed interaction between the foot and the world. Dense estimation of foot contact is crucial for accurately modeling this interaction, yet predicting dense foot contact from a single RGB image remains largely underexplored. There are two main challenges for learning dense foot contact estimation. First, shoes exhibit highly diverse appearances, making it difficult for models to generalize across different styles. Second, ground often has a monotonous appearance, making it difficult to extract informative features. To tackle these issues, we present a FEet COntact estimation (FECO) framework that learns dense foot contact with shoe style-invariant and ground-aware learning. To overcome the challenge of shoe appearance diversity, our approach incorporates shoe style adversarial training that enforces shoe style-invariant features for contact estimation. To effectively utilize ground information, we introduce a ground feature extractor that captures ground properties based on spatial context. As a result, our proposed method achieves robust foot contact estimation regardless of shoe appearance and effectively leverages ground information. Code will be released.

Conclusion: 同时建模外观和关系信息能有效增强面部表情识别的时空表示，ARPGNet为这一任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The key to facial expression recognition is to learn discriminative spatial-temporal representations that embed facial expression dynamics. Previous studies predominantly rely on pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to learn facial appearance representations, overlooking the relationships between facial regions. To address this issue, this paper presents an Appearance- and Relation-aware Parallel Graph attention fusion Network (ARPGNet) to learn mutually enhanced spatial-temporal representations of appearance and relation information. Specifically, we construct a facial region relation graph and leverage the graph attention mechanism to model the relationships between facial regions. The resulting relational representation sequences, along with CNN-based appearance representation sequences, are then fed into a parallel graph attention fusion module for mutual interaction and enhancement. This module simultaneously explores the complementarity between different representation sequences and the temporal dynamics within each sequence. Experimental results on three facial expression recognition datasets demonstrate that the proposed ARPGNet outperforms or is comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在无需文本反转的情况下实现了可比的3D生成性能，同时提供了更好的控制能力和3D一致性

Abstract: Recently, the impressive generative capabilities of diffusion models have been demonstrated, producing images with remarkable fidelity. Particularly, existing methods for the 3D object generation tasks, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in computer vision, pre-dominantly use text-to-image diffusion models with textual inversion which train a pseudo text prompt to describe the given image. In practice, various text-to-image generative models employ textual inversion to learn concepts or styles of target object in the pseudo text prompt embedding space, thereby generating sophisticated outputs. However, textual inversion requires additional training time and lacks control ability. To tackle this issues, we propose two innovative methods: (1) using an off-the-shelf image adapter that generates 3D objects without textual inversion, offering enhanced control over conditions such as depth, pose, and text. (2) a depth conditioned warmup strategy to enhance 3D consistency. In experimental results, ours show qualitatively and quantitatively comparable performance and improved 3D consistency to the existing text-inversion-based alternatives. Furthermore, we conduct a user study to assess (i) how well results match the input image and (ii) whether 3D consistency is maintained. User study results show that our model outperforms the alternatives, validating the effectiveness of our approaches.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have greatly improved text-based image editing, yet methods that edit images independently often produce geometrically and photometrically inconsistent results across different views of the same scene. Such inconsistencies are particularly problematic for editing of 3D representations such as NeRFs or Gaussian Splat models. We propose a training-free diffusion framework that enforces multi-view consistency during the image editing process. The key assumption is that corresponding points in the unedited images should undergo similar transformations after editing. To achieve this, we introduce a consistency loss that guides the diffusion sampling toward coherent edits. The framework is flexible and can be combined with widely varying image editing methods, supporting both dense and sparse multi-view editing setups. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves 3D consistency compared to existing multi-view editing methods. We also show that this increased consistency enables high-quality Gaussian Splat editing with sharp details and strong fidelity to user-specified text prompts.

Conclusion: 建立了一个可扩展、高效的医疗MLLMs开发范式，能够进行复合推理，弥合生物医学文献与实际临床应用之间的差距

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in advancing healthcare. However, most existing models remain confined to single-image understanding, which greatly limits their applicability in clinical workflows. In practice, medical diagnosis and progression often require synthesizing information across multiple images from different modalities or time points. The development of medical MLLMs capable of such multi-image understanding has been hindered by the lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated training data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that leverages license-permissive compound images in biomedical literature, as a rich yet underutilized data source for multi-image analysis. Specifically, we design a five-stage, context-aware instruction generation paradigm underpinned by a divide-and-conquer strategy. By decomposing multi-image analysis into manageable sub-tasks, this paradigm empowers MLLMs to move beyond single-panel analysis and provide a composite understanding by learning the complex spatial, temporal, and cross-modal relationships inherent in these compound figures. By parsing over 237,000 compound figures and their contextual text for instruction generation, we develop M3LLM, a medical multi-image multi-modal large language model. For benchmarking, we construct PMC-MI-Bench for composite understanding, manually validated by medical experts. Extensive experiments show that M3LLM significantly outperforms both general-purpose and specialized medical MLLMs across multi-image, single-image, text-only, and multi-choice scenarios. Notably, M3LLM exhibits strong generalization to longitudinal chest X-ray analysis using the MIMIC dataset. This work establishes a scalable and efficient paradigm for developing medical MLLMs capable of composite reasoning, bridging the gap between biomedical literature and real-world clinical applications.

Conclusion: IE-SRGS通过联合利用外部2D超分辨率先验和内部3DGS特征的互补优势，有效解决了3D高斯溅射超分辨率中的模糊问题，实现了高质量的重建效果。

Abstract: Reconstructing high-resolution (HR) 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models from low-resolution (LR) inputs remains challenging due to the lack of fine-grained textures and geometry. Existing methods typically rely on pre-trained 2D super-resolution (2DSR) models to enhance textures, but suffer from 3D Gaussian ambiguity arising from cross-view inconsistencies and domain gaps inherent in 2DSR models. We propose IE-SRGS, a novel 3DGS SR paradigm that addresses this issue by jointly leveraging the complementary strengths of external 2DSR priors and internal 3DGS features. Specifically, we use 2DSR and depth estimation models to generate HR images and depth maps as external knowledge, and employ multi-scale 3DGS models to produce cross-view consistent, domain-adaptive counterparts as internal knowledge. A mask-guided fusion strategy is introduced to integrate these two sources and synergistically exploit their complementary strengths, effectively guiding the 3D Gaussian optimization toward high-fidelity reconstruction. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks show that IE-SRGS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative accuracy and visual fidelity.

Result: 初步用户研究表明，不确定性引导修正将错误检测召回率从67%显著提升到94.0%（p=0.007），且总修正时间没有显著增加

Conclusion: VessQC实现了高效的人机协同体积分割修正，填补了不确定性估计与实际人机交互之间的关键空白，软件已在GitHub开源

Abstract: Accurate 3D microscopy image segmentation is critical for quantitative bioimage analysis but even state-of-the-art foundation models yield error-prone results. Therefore, manual curation is still widely used for either preparing high-quality training data or fixing errors before analysis. We present VessQC, an open-source tool for uncertainty-guided curation of large 3D microscopy segmentations. By integrating uncertainty maps, VessQC directs user attention to regions most likely containing biologically meaningful errors. In a preliminary user study uncertainty-guided correction significantly improved error detection recall from 67% to 94.0% (p=0.007) without a significant increase in total curation time. VessQC thus enables efficient, human-in-the-loop refinement of volumetric segmentations and bridges a key gap in real-world applications between uncertainty estimation and practical human-computer interaction. The software is freely available at github.com/MMV-Lab/VessQC.

TL;DR: 提出基于SAM的篡改检测新方法，通过对抗扰动使SAM"看不见"原图，从而在图像被篡改时识别伪造区域


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AIGC图像编辑技术简化了逼真图像修改，带来了严重的图像伪造风险，需要有效的篡改检测方法

Method: 1) 将图像转化为神经模型视角的空白画布；2) 引入对抗扰动使SAM"看不见"原图内容；3) 提出频率感知优化策略增强欺骗效果

Result: 大量实验结果表明该方法在篡改定位方面具有有效性

Conclusion: 通过使SAM"失明"的策略，成功实现了基于SAM的篡改检测，为图像伪造检测提供了新思路

Abstract: AIGC-based image editing technology has greatly simplified the realistic-level image modification, causing serious potential risks of image forgery. This paper introduces a new approach to tampering detection using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Instead of training SAM to identify tampered areas, we propose a novel strategy. The entire image is transformed into a blank canvas from the perspective of neural models. Any modifications to this blank canvas would be noticeable to the models. To achieve this idea, we introduce adversarial perturbations to prevent SAM from ``seeing anything'', allowing it to identify forged regions when the image is tampered with. Due to SAM's powerful perceiving capabilities, naive adversarial attacks cannot completely tame SAM. To thoroughly deceive SAM and make it blind to the image, we introduce a frequency-aware optimization strategy, which further enhances the capability of tamper localization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: TTSnap通过噪声感知剪枝显著提高了测试时扩展的效率和效果，为文本到图像扩散模型的优化提供了新思路

Abstract: A prominent approach to test-time scaling for text-to-image diffusion models formulates the problem as a search over multiple noise seeds, selecting the one that maximizes a certain image-reward function. The effectiveness of this strategy heavily depends on the number and diversity of noise seeds explored. However, verifying each candidate is computationally expensive, because each must be fully denoised before a reward can be computed. This severely limits the number of samples that can be explored under a fixed budget. We propose test-time scaling with noise-aware pruning (TTSnap), a framework that prunes low-quality candidates without fully denoising them. The key challenge is that reward models are learned in the clean image domain, and the ranking of rewards predicted for intermediate estimates are often inconsistent with those predicted for clean images. To overcome this, we train noise-aware reward models via self-distillation to align the reward for intermediate estimates with that of the final clean images. To stabilize learning across different noise levels, we adopt a curriculum training strategy that progressively shifts the data domain from clean images to noise images. In addition, we introduce a new metric that measures reward alignment and computational budget utilization. Experiments demonstrate that our approach improves performance by over 16\% compared with existing methods, enabling more efficient and effective test-time scaling. It also provides orthogonal gains when combined with post-training techniques and local test-time optimization. Code: https://github.com/TerrysLearning/TTSnap/.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于语义锚定的文本到图像扩散模型个性化方法，通过将新概念锚定到其对应分布中来稳定地学习用户特定主题，同时保持预训练语义先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在个性化方面存在挑战：当专注于主体保真度时容易过拟合少量参考图像，而强调先验保持又会阻碍学习新的个性化属性。需要平衡主体保真度和文本图像对齐。

Method: 提出语义锚定方法，将个性化重新定义为通过语义锚定在频繁对应概念的指导下学习罕见概念的过程。通过将新概念锚定到其对应分布中，引导模型以稳定可控的方式适应新概念。

Result: 相比基线方法，该方法实现了稳定的适应，并在主体保真度和文本图像对齐方面都取得了一致的改进。广泛的实验和消融研究证明了所提锚定策略的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 语义锚定策略能够扩展预训练分布到个性化区域，同时保持其语义结构，解决了扩散模型个性化中的平衡问题，实现了更好的个性化效果。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in generating diverse and realistic images from textual descriptions. However, they still struggle with personalization, which requires adapting a pretrained model to depict user-specific subjects from only a few reference images. The key challenge lies in learning a new visual concept from a limited number of reference images while preserving the pretrained semantic prior that maintains text-image alignment. When the model focuses on subject fidelity, it tends to overfit the limited reference images and fails to leverage the pretrained distribution. Conversely, emphasizing prior preservation maintains semantic consistency but prevents the model from learning new personalized attributes. Building on these observations, we propose the personalization process through a semantic anchoring that guides adaptation by grounding new concepts in their corresponding distributions. We therefore reformulate personalization as the process of learning a rare concept guided by its frequent counterpart through semantic anchoring. This anchoring encourages the model to adapt new concepts in a stable and controlled manner, expanding the pretrained distribution toward personalized regions while preserving its semantic structure. As a result, the proposed method achieves stable adaptation and consistent improvements in both subject fidelity and text-image alignment compared to baseline methods. Extensive experiments and ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed anchoring strategy.

TL;DR: FreqWarm：一种频率预热课程，通过增加高频潜在信号的早期暴露来改善潜在扩散模型的生成质量，无需修改自编码器


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型存在重建-生成的权衡问题：高维自编码器提高重建保真度但生成质量下降，原因是编码器对高频内容表示不足，而解码器依赖高频潜在分量恢复细节

Method: 提出FreqWarm频率预热课程，在扩散或流匹配训练早期阶段增加高频潜在信号的暴露，不修改或重新训练自编码器，通过控制RGB和潜在域的扰动分析编码器/解码器行为

Result: 在多个高维自编码器上一致改善生成质量：Wan2.2-VAE降低gFID 14.11，LTX-VAE降低6.13，DC-AE-f32降低4.42，证明频率暴露管理可将高维潜在空间转化为更易扩散的目标

Conclusion: 明确管理频率暴露能成功将高维潜在空间转化为更易扩散的目标，FreqWarm作为即插即用解决方案，架构无关且兼容多种骨干网络

Abstract: Latent diffusion has become the default paradigm for visual generation, yet we observe a persistent reconstruction-generation trade-off as latent dimensionality increases: higher-capacity autoencoders improve reconstruction fidelity but generation quality eventually declines. We trace this gap to the different behaviors in high-frequency encoding and decoding. Through controlled perturbations in both RGB and latent domains, we analyze encoder/decoder behaviors and find that decoders depend strongly on high-frequency latent components to recover details, whereas encoders under-represent high-frequency contents, yielding insufficient exposure and underfitting in high-frequency bands for diffusion model training. To address this issue, we introduce FreqWarm, a plug-and-play frequency warm-up curriculum that increases early-stage exposure to high-frequency latent signals during diffusion or flow-matching training -- without modifying or retraining the autoencoder. Applied across several high-dimensional autoencoders, FreqWarm consistently improves generation quality: decreasing gFID by 14.11 on Wan2.2-VAE, 6.13 on LTX-VAE, and 4.42 on DC-AE-f32, while remaining architecture-agnostic and compatible with diverse backbones. Our study shows that explicitly managing frequency exposure can successfully turn high-dimensional latent spaces into more diffusible targets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声领域缺乏能够同时处理低层次感知任务（分割、定位）和高层次理解任务（诊断、推理）的综合性解决方案，现有模型往往只能处理单一类型任务。

Method: 1. 构建UMind-DS大规模多模态数据集（120万超声图像-文本对，16个解剖区域，包含像素级标注和临床验证推理）；2. 设计轻量级动态卷积掩码解码器，基于LLM输出生成动态核进行掩码生成；3. 使用任务特定token统一分割、检测、几何测量和诊断任务。

Conclusion: UMind-VL成功实现了超声领域像素级结构理解与复杂临床推理的统一，为超声医学提供了一个全面的基础模型解决方案，具有重要的临床应用价值。

Abstract: Despite significant strides in medical foundation models, the ultrasound domain lacks a comprehensive solution capable of bridging low-level Ultrasound Grounded Perception (e.g., segmentation, localization) and high-level Ultrasound Comprehensive Interpretation (e.g., diagnosis, reasoning). To bridge this gap, we propose UMind-VL, a unified foundation model designed to synergize pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning. We first introduce UMind-DS, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 1.2 million ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions, enriching standard data with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. Architecturally, UMind-VL incorporates a lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. This design, combined with task-specific tokens, unifies segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis tasks within a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with, or superior to, state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability. We demonstrate the capability of UMind-VL in Figure 1.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful representation for 3D scenes, widely adopted due to its exceptional efficiency and high-fidelity visual quality. Given the significant value of 3DGS assets, recent works have introduced specialized watermarking schemes to ensure copyright protection and ownership verification. However, can existing 3D Gaussian watermarking approaches genuinely guarantee robust protection of the 3D assets? In this paper, for the first time, we systematically explore and validate possible vulnerabilities of 3DGS watermarking frameworks. We demonstrate that conventional watermark removal techniques designed for 2D images do not effectively generalize to the 3DGS scenario due to the specialized rendering pipeline and unique attributes of each gaussian primitives. Motivated by this insight, we propose GSPure, the first watermark purification framework specifically for 3DGS watermarking representations. By analyzing view-dependent rendering contributions and exploiting geometrically accurate feature clustering, GSPure precisely isolates and effectively removes watermark-related Gaussian primitives while preserving scene integrity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GSPure achieves the best watermark purification performance, reducing watermark PSNR by up to 16.34dB while minimizing degradation to original scene fidelity with less than 1dB PSNR loss. Moreover, it consistently outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and generalization.

Conclusion: DriveVGGT成功将自动驾驶特定先验整合到前馈重建框架中，实现了针对自动驾驶数据的尺度感知4D重建，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Feed-forward reconstruction has recently gained significant attention, with VGGT being a notable example. However, directly applying VGGT to autonomous driving (AD) systems leads to sub-optimal results due to the different priors between the two tasks. In AD systems, several important new priors need to be considered: (i) The overlap between camera views is minimal, as autonomous driving sensor setups are designed to achieve coverage at a low cost. (ii) The camera intrinsics and extrinsics are known, which introduces more constraints on the output and also enables the estimation of absolute scale. (iii) Relative positions of all cameras remain fixed though the ego vehicle is in motion. To fully integrate these priors into a feed-forward framework, we propose DriveVGGT, a scale-aware 4D reconstruction framework specifically designed for autonomous driving data. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Video Attention (TVA) module to process multi-camera videos independently, which better leverages the spatiotemporal continuity within each single-camera sequence. Then, we propose a Multi-camera Consistency Attention (MCA) module to conduct window attention with normalized relative pose embeddings, aiming to establish consistency relationships across different cameras while restricting each token to attend only to nearby frames. Finally, we extend the standard VGGT heads by adding an absolute scale head and an ego vehicle pose head. Experiments show that DriveVGGT outperforms VGGT, StreamVGGT, fastVGGT on autonomous driving dataset while extensive ablation studies verify effectiveness of the proposed designs.

Abstract: Observing certain patches in an image reduces the uncertainty of others. Their realization lowers the distribution entropy of each remaining patch feature, analogous to collapsing a particle's wave function in quantum mechanics. This phenomenon can intuitively be called patch collapse. To identify which patches are most relied on during a target region's collapse, we learn an autoencoder that softly selects a subset of patches to reconstruct each target patch. Graphing these learned dependencies for each patch's PageRank score reveals the optimal patch order to realize an image. We show that respecting this order benefits various masked image modeling methods. First, autoregressive image generation can be boosted by retraining the state-of-the-art model MAR. Next, we introduce a new setup for image classification by exposing Vision Transformers only to high-rank patches in the collapse order. Seeing 22\% of such patches is sufficient to achieve high accuracy. With these experiments, we propose patch collapse as a novel image modeling perspective that promotes vision efficiency.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对单张图像或密集采样的视频，缺乏对非结构化图像集合（共享视觉元素但视角、时间、内容不同）进行一致性控制生成的能力。

Method: 将任务建模为图结构，节点对应图像，边触发图像对的联合生成。通过融合跨图像对的内部特征（基于密集输入对应关系），在统一框架中强制执行局部一致性和全局连贯性，无需掩码或人工监督。

Conclusion: Match-and-Fuse 为零样本、免训练的非结构化图像集合一致性控制生成提供了有效解决方案，通过图建模和特征融合实现了跨图像的连贯生成。

Abstract: We present Match-and-Fuse - a zero-shot, training-free method for consistent controlled generation of unstructured image sets - collections that share a common visual element, yet differ in viewpoint, time of capture, and surrounding content. Unlike existing methods that operate on individual images or densely sampled videos, our framework performs set-to-set generation: given a source set and user prompts, it produces a new set that preserves cross-image consistency of shared content. Our key idea is to model the task as a graph, where each node corresponds to an image and each edge triggers a joint generation of image pairs. This formulation consolidates all pairwise generations into a unified framework, enforcing their local consistency while ensuring global coherence across the entire set. This is achieved by fusing internal features across image pairs, guided by dense input correspondences, without requiring masks or manual supervision. It also allows us to leverage an emergent prior in text-to-image models that encourages coherent generation when multiple views share a single canvas. Match-and-Fuse achieves state-of-the-art consistency and visual quality, and unlocks new capabilities for content creation from image collections.

Conclusion: 结构化和文本监督是构建可扩展、临床基础的医学基础模型的互补路径，MVMAE系列方法为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Building robust medical machine learning systems requires pretraining strategies that exploit the intrinsic structure present in clinical data. We introduce Multiview Masked Autoencoder (MVMAE), a self-supervised framework that leverages the natural multi-view organization of radiology studies to learn view-invariant and disease-relevant representations. MVMAE combines masked image reconstruction with cross-view alignment, transforming clinical redundancy across projections into a powerful self-supervisory signal. We further extend this approach with MVMAE-V2T, which incorporates radiology reports as an auxiliary text-based learning signal to enhance semantic grounding while preserving fully vision-based inference. Evaluated on a downstream disease classification task on three large-scale public datasets, MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert, and PadChest, MVMAE consistently outperforms supervised and vision-language baselines. Furthermore, MVMAE-V2T provides additional gains, particularly in low-label regimes where structured textual supervision is most beneficial. Together, these results establish the importance of structural and textual supervision as complementary paths toward scalable, clinically grounded medical foundation models.

Abstract: Object detection is the task of detecting objects in an image. In this task, the detection of small objects is particularly difficult. Other than the small size, it is also accompanied by difficulties due to blur, occlusion, and so on. Current small object detection methods are tailored to small and dense situations, such as pedestrians in a crowd or far objects in remote sensing scenarios. However, when the target object is small and sparse, there is a lack of objects available for training, making it more difficult to learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a specialized method for detecting a specific category of small objects; birds. Particularly, we improve the features learned by the neck; the sub-network between the backbone and the prediction head, to learn more effective features with a hierarchical design. We employ Swin Transformer to upsample the image features. Moreover, we change the shifted window size for adapting to small objects. Experiments show that the proposed Swin Transformer-based neck combined with CenterNet can lead to good performance by changing the window sizes. We further find that smaller window sizes (default 2) benefit mAPs for small object detection.

Conclusion: 证明了基于自动提示引导的方法对一致视频着色的有效性，无需特定颜色输入即可达到最先进效果

Abstract: Existing video colorization methods struggle with temporal flickering or demand extensive manual input. We propose a novel approach automating high-fidelity video colorization using rich semantic guidance derived from language and segmentation. We employ a language-conditioned diffusion model to colorize grayscale frames. Guidance is provided via automatically generated object masks and textual prompts; our primary automatic method uses a generic prompt, achieving state-of-the-art results without specific color input. Temporal stability is achieved by warping color information from previous frames using optical flow (RAFT); a correction step detects and fixes inconsistencies introduced by warping. Evaluations on standard benchmarks (DAVIS30, VIDEVO20) show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in colorization accuracy (PSNR) and visual realism (Colorfulness, CDC), demonstrating the efficacy of automated prompt-based guidance for consistent video colorization.

Conclusion: 现有偏倚缓解策略无法解决新发现的提示格式偏倚，需要更稳健的评估方法

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in handling image-text inputs. A common way to assess this ability is through multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA). Earlier works have already revealed that these benchmarks are sensitive to answer choice order, a limitation that can be mitigated through careful design. Yet, we highlight additional, unexplored biases in prompt formatting that question the reliability of current MLLM evaluations. Specifically, we identify three key variation factors in prompt formatting and analyze their impact through a large-scale study involving $\mathbf{\text{seven}}$ MLLMs and $\mathbf{\text{five}}$ VQA datasets, spanning $\mathbf{48}$ distinct $\mathbf{\text{prompt format variations}}$. Our findings reveal that multiple-choice VQA is highly sensitive to minor prompt format changes, even when these changes are semantically neutral. We further demonstrate that these biases persist independently of known order biases or the MLLM's confidence in the correct answer. Finally, we demonstrate that existing bias mitigation strategies fail to address these newly identified biases.

TL;DR: 提出一种新的归一化流对齐策略，通过将生成过程（反向传播）的中间特征与视觉基础模型对齐，显著提升生成质量和分类精度，同时加速训练3.3倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准归一化流（NFs）的生成质量受限于基于对数似然优化的语义表示能力不足。需要一种更有效的方法来提升NFs的语义表示能力，从而改善生成质量和分类性能。

Method: 1）提出创新的对齐策略：利用NFs的可逆性，将生成过程（反向传播）的中间特征与强大的视觉基础模型表示对齐，而非传统的正向传播正则化；2）引入无需训练、测试时优化的分类算法，更本质地评估NFs嵌入的语义知识。

Result: 1）NFs训练速度提升超过3.3倍；2）在ImageNet 64×64和256×256上实现了生成质量和分类精度的显著提升；3）建立了NFs在这些数据集上的新state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: 通过创新的生成过程特征对齐策略，成功解决了NFs语义表示不足的问题，在加速训练的同时显著提升了生成和分类性能，为NFs的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Normalizing Flows (NFs) are a class of generative models distinguished by a mathematically invertible architecture, where the forward pass transforms data into a latent space for density estimation, and the reverse pass generates new samples from this space. This characteristic creates an intrinsic synergy between representation learning and data generation. However, the generative quality of standard NFs is limited by poor semantic representations from log-likelihood optimization. To remedy this, we propose a novel alignment strategy that creatively leverages the invertibility of NFs: instead of regularizing the forward pass, we align the intermediate features of the generative (reverse) pass with representations from a powerful vision foundation model, demonstrating superior effectiveness over naive alignment. We also introduce a novel training-free, test-time optimization algorithm for classification, which provides a more intrinsic evaluation of the NF's embedded semantic knowledge. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the training of NFs by over 3.3$\times$, while simultaneously delivering significant improvements in both generative quality and classification accuracy. New state-of-the-art results for NFs are established on ImageNet 64$\times$64 and 256$\times$256. Our code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/FlowBack.

*Anshul Bagaria*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: INSIGHT是一个可解释的多模态框架，用于鲁棒检测和透明解释AI生成图像，即使在极低分辨率下也能工作，结合了超分辨率、空间定位和语义对齐技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测系统在真实世界条件下（如下采样、压缩、跨域分布偏移）性能急剧下降，且大多数检测器作为不透明的分类器运行，无法解释为何将图像标记为合成图像，这削弱了信任并阻碍了在高风险环境中的采用。

Method: INSIGHT结合了层次超分辨率以放大细微的取证线索而不引入误导性伪影，Grad-CAM驱动的多尺度定位以揭示指示生成模式的空间区域，以及CLIP引导的语义对齐以将视觉异常映射到人类可解释的描述符。然后使用结构化的ReAct + Chain-of-Thought协议提示视觉语言模型，通过双阶段G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge管道验证以最小化幻觉并确保事实性。

Result: 在包括动物、车辆和抽象合成场景在内的多个领域中，INSIGHT在极端退化条件下显著提高了检测鲁棒性和解释质量，优于先前的检测器和黑盒VLM基线。

Conclusion: INSIGHT为透明、可靠的AI生成图像取证提供了一条实用路径，并在可信的多模态内容验证方面迈出了一步。

Abstract: The growing realism of AI-generated images produced by recent GAN and diffusion models has intensified concerns over the reliability of visual media. Yet, despite notable progress in deepfake detection, current forensic systems degrade sharply under real-world conditions such as severe downsampling, compression, and cross-domain distribution shifts. Moreover, most detectors operate as opaque classifiers, offering little insight into why an image is flagged as synthetic, undermining trust and hindering adoption in high-stakes settings.
  We introduce INSIGHT (Interpretable Neural Semantic and Image-based Generative-forensic Hallucination Tracing), a unified multimodal framework for robust detection and transparent explanation of AI-generated images, even at extremely low resolutions (16x16 - 64x64). INSIGHT combines hierarchical super-resolution for amplifying subtle forensic cues without inducing misleading artifacts, Grad-CAM driven multi-scale localization to reveal spatial regions indicative of generative patterns, and CLIP-guided semantic alignment to map visual anomalies to human-interpretable descriptors. A vision-language model is then prompted using a structured ReAct + Chain-of-Thought protocol to produce consistent, fine-grained explanations, verified through a dual-stage G-Eval + LLM-as-a-judge pipeline to minimize hallucinations and ensure factuality.
  Across diverse domains, including animals, vehicles, and abstract synthetic scenes, INSIGHT substantially improves both detection robustness and explanation quality under extreme degradation, outperforming prior detectors and black-box VLM baselines. Our results highlight a practical path toward transparent, reliable AI-generated image forensics and establish INSIGHT as a step forward in trustworthy multimodal content verification.

TL;DR: AnchorFlow：基于潜在锚点一致性的免训练3D编辑方法，通过全局潜在锚点确保编辑稳定性和语义保真度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有免训练3D编辑方法在生成强烈或几何稳定的编辑效果方面存在困难，主要原因是扩散采样中时间步依赖的噪声引入了不一致的潜在锚点

Method: 提出AnchorFlow方法，基于潜在锚点一致性原则：1) 在源轨迹和目标轨迹之间建立共享的全局潜在锚点；2) 使用松弛锚点对齐损失和锚点对齐更新规则强制一致性；3) 无需掩码监督即可保持几何保真度

Result: 在Eval3DEdit基准测试中，AnchorFlow在各种编辑类型上都能一致地产生语义对齐和结构鲁棒的编辑效果

Conclusion: 通过稳定潜在参考空间，AnchorFlow实现了更显著的语义修改，同时保持了编辑过程的稳定性和语义忠实性，代码已开源

Abstract: Training-free 3D editing aims to modify 3D shapes based on human instructions without model finetuning. It plays a crucial role in 3D content creation. However, existing approaches often struggle to produce strong or geometrically stable edits, largely due to inconsistent latent anchors introduced by timestep-dependent noise during diffusion sampling. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorFlow, which is built upon the principle of latent anchor consistency. Specifically, AnchorFlow establishes a global latent anchor shared between the source and target trajectories, and enforces coherence using a relaxed anchor-alignment loss together with an anchor-aligned update rule. This design ensures that transformations remain stable and semantically faithful throughout the editing process. By stabilizing the latent reference space, AnchorFlow enables more pronounced semantic modifications. Moreover, AnchorFlow is mask-free. Without mask supervision, it effectively preserves geometric fidelity. Experiments on the Eval3DEdit benchmark show that AnchorFlow consistently delivers semantically aligned and structurally robust edits across diverse editing types.

TL;DR: 提出RS-EoT框架解决遥感视觉问答中的伪推理问题，通过语言驱动的迭代视觉证据搜索范式，结合SocraticAgent多智能体系统和两阶段强化学习策略，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推理模型在遥感任务中存在广泛伪推理问题——模型只是描述推理过程而非基于视觉证据进行真正推理。这源于"一瞥效应"：对大规模遥感图像的单一粗略感知导致理解不完整，模型基于语言自洽性而非视觉证据进行推理。

Method: 1. 提出RS-EoT（遥感证据思维）框架：语言驱动的迭代视觉证据搜索范式；2. 设计SocraticAgent：自博弈多智能体系统，通过推理和视觉检查交替循环合成推理轨迹；3. 两阶段渐进RL策略：先在细粒度Grounding任务上进行RL以增强RS-EoT能力，后在RS VQA任务上进行RL以泛化到更广泛理解场景。

Result: RS-EoT在多个RS VQA和grounding基准测试中达到最先进性能。分析显示清晰的推理和证据搜索迭代循环，证实RS-EoT缓解了一瞥效应，实现了真正的证据基础推理。

Conclusion: RS-EoT框架有效解决了遥感任务中的伪推理问题，通过迭代视觉证据搜索实现了真正的证据基础推理，为遥感多模态理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Recent multimodal reasoning models, inspired by DeepSeek-R1, have significantly advanced vision-language systems. However, in remote sensing (RS) tasks, we observe widespread pseudo reasoning: models narrate the process of reasoning rather than genuinely reason toward the correct answer based on visual evidence. We attribute this to the Glance Effect, where a single, coarse perception of large-scale RS imagery results in incomplete understanding and reasoning based on linguistic self-consistency instead of visual evidence. To address this, we propose RS-EoT (Remote Sensing Evidence-of-Thought), a language-driven, iterative visual evidence-seeking paradigm. To instill this paradigm, we propose SocraticAgent, a self-play multi-agent system that synthesizes reasoning traces via alternating cycles of reasoning and visual inspection. To enhance and generalize these patterns, we propose a two-stage progressive RL strategy: first, RL on fine-grained Grounding tasks to enhance RS-EoT capabilities, followed by RL on RS VQA to generalize to broader understanding scenarios. Experiments show RS-EoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RS VQA and grounding benchmarks. Analyses reveal clear iterative cycles of reasoning and evidence seeking, confirming RS-EoT mitigates the Glance Effect and enables genuine evidence-grounded reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UAV-MM3D是一个用于低空无人机感知的高保真多模态合成数据集，包含40万帧同步数据，涵盖多种场景、天气条件和无人机类型，提供RGB、红外、激光雷达、雷达和动态视觉传感器五种模态，支持3D检测、姿态估计、跟踪和轨迹预测等任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界无人机数据收集面临空域管制、隐私问题和环境变化等限制，而手动标注3D姿态和跨模态对应关系耗时且昂贵，需要大规模、精确标注的多模态数据来开发可靠的无人机感知解决方案。

Method: 创建UAV-MM3D合成数据集，包含400K同步帧，覆盖城市、郊区、森林、海岸等多样场景和不同天气条件，包含多种无人机模型，提供五种传感器模态数据，并配备2D/3D边界框、6自由度姿态和实例级标注。

Conclusion: UAV-MM3D通过可控的仿真环境、全面的场景覆盖和丰富的标注，为推进无人机3D感知研究提供了有价值的基准数据集和基线方法。

Abstract: Accurate perception of UAVs in complex low-altitude environments is critical for airspace security and related intelligent systems. Developing reliable solutions requires large-scale, accurately annotated, and multimodal data. However, real-world UAV data collection faces inherent constraints due to airspace regulations, privacy concerns, and environmental variability, while manual annotation of 3D poses and cross-modal correspondences is time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, we introduce UAV-MM3D, a high-fidelity multimodal synthetic dataset for low-altitude UAV perception and motion understanding. It comprises 400K synchronized frames across diverse scenes (urban areas, suburbs, forests, coastal regions) and weather conditions (clear, cloudy, rainy, foggy), featuring multiple UAV models (micro, small, medium-sized) and five modalities - RGB, IR, LiDAR, Radar, and DVS (Dynamic Vision Sensor). Each frame provides 2D/3D bounding boxes, 6-DoF poses, and instance-level annotations, enabling core tasks related to UAVs such as 3D detection, pose estimation, target tracking, and short-term trajectory forecasting. We further propose LGFusionNet, a LiDAR-guided multimodal fusion baseline, and a dedicated UAV trajectory prediction baseline to facilitate benchmarking. With its controllable simulation environment, comprehensive scenario coverage, and rich annotations, UAV3D offers a public benchmark for advancing 3D perception of UAVs.

TL;DR: DiffStyle360：基于扩散模型的3D头部风格化框架，无需针对每种风格单独训练，仅需单张风格参考图像即可生成多视角一致、身份保持的3D头部风格化结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D头部风格化方法依赖计算昂贵的优化或针对特定风格的微调，难以适应新风格。需要一种无需针对每种风格单独训练、能够处理多样艺术领域的3D头部风格化方法。

Method: 基于DiffPortrait360架构，引入两个关键组件：1) 风格外观模块解耦风格与内容；2) 风格融合注意力机制在潜在空间中自适应平衡结构保持与风格化保真度。使用3D GAN生成的多视角数据集进行鲁棒微调，并采用基于温度的关键缩放策略控制推理时的风格化强度。

Result: 在FFHQ和RenderMe360数据集上的广泛实验表明，DiffStyle360在风格质量上优于最先进的GAN和基于扩散的风格化方法，能够处理具有挑战性的风格领域。

Conclusion: DiffStyle360是一个有效的3D头部风格化框架，能够仅凭单张风格参考图像生成多视角一致、身份保持的风格化结果，无需针对每种风格进行训练，在多样艺术领域展现出优越性能。

Abstract: 3D head stylization has emerged as a key technique for reimagining realistic human heads in various artistic forms, enabling expressive character design and creative visual experiences in digital media. Despite the progress in 3D-aware generation, existing 3D head stylization methods often rely on computationally expensive optimization or domain-specific fine-tuning to adapt to new styles. To address these limitations, we propose DiffStyle360, a diffusion-based framework capable of producing multi-view consistent, identity-preserving 3D head stylizations across diverse artistic domains given a single style reference image, without requiring per-style training. Building upon the 3D-aware DiffPortrait360 architecture, our approach introduces two key components: the Style Appearance Module, which disentangles style from content, and the Style Fusion Attention mechanism, which adaptively balances structure preservation and stylization fidelity in the latent space. Furthermore, we employ a 3D GAN-generated multi-view dataset for robust fine-tuning and introduce a temperaturebased key scaling strategy to control stylization intensity during inference. Extensive experiments on FFHQ and RenderMe360 demonstrate that DiffStyle360 achieves superior style quality, outperforming state-of-the-art GAN- and diffusion-based stylization methods across challenging style domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D变形方法依赖手动对应匹配和变形轨迹估计，限制了泛化能力且需要昂贵的预处理。需要一种能够生成高保真3D过渡并保持丰富纹理细节的方法。

Method: 1. 利用基于流的transformer生成先验；2. 将变形建模为最优传输重心问题确保平滑形状过渡；3. 采用序列初始化策略防止几何失真；4. 提出相似性引导的语义一致性机制选择性保留高频细节和控制混合动态。

Result: 广泛的定量和定性评估表明，WUKONG在多样化的几何和纹理变化上显著优于现有最先进方法，实现了卓越的结果。

Conclusion: WUKONG提供了一个无需训练的高保真3D纹理变形框架，通过创新的最优传输和语义一致性机制，解决了传统方法的局限性，在形状过渡和纹理保持方面表现出色。

Abstract: We present WUKONG, a novel training-free framework for high-fidelity textured 3D morphing that takes a pair of source and target prompts (image or text) as input. Unlike conventional methods -- which rely on manual correspondence matching and deformation trajectory estimation (limiting generalization and requiring costly preprocessing) -- WUKONG leverages the generative prior of flow-based transformers to produce high-fidelity 3D transitions with rich texture details. To ensure smooth shape transitions, we exploit the inherent continuity of flow-based generative processes and formulate morphing as an optimal transport barycenter problem. We further introduce a sequential initialization strategy to prevent abrupt geometric distortions and preserve identity coherence. For faithful texture preservation, we propose a similarity-guided semantic consistency mechanism that selectively retains high-frequency details and enables precise control over blending dynamics. This avoids common artifacts like oversmoothing while maintaining semantic fidelity. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that WUKONG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior results across diverse geometry and texture variations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前前馈式3D重建模型面临两个主要问题：1）高精度深度和姿态监督数据稀缺；2）多视点图回归固有的几何错位问题，导致模型在精细几何结构和鲁棒性方面表现不佳。

Method: Fin3R采用轻量级微调策略：冻结处理视图匹配的解码器，仅微调特征提取的图像编码器。编码器通过定制LoRA适配器，从强大的单目教师模型在大规模无标签数据集上蒸馏精细几何细节。

Result: 在DUSt3R、MASt3R、CUT3R、VGGT等多种模型上验证，微调后的模型能生成更清晰的边界、恢复复杂结构，在单视图和多视图设置下均获得更高的几何精度，且仅增加微小的LoRA权重，测试时内存和延迟几乎不变。

Conclusion: Fin3R通过简单有效的微调方法，解决了3D重建模型在精细几何和鲁棒性方面的瓶颈，为前馈式3D重建模型提供了一种通用且高效的性能提升方案。

Abstract: We present Fin3R, a simple, effective, and general fine-tuning method for feed-forward 3D reconstruction models. The family of feed-forward reconstruction model regresses pointmap of all input images to a reference frame coordinate system, along with other auxiliary outputs, in a single forward pass. However, we find that current models struggle with fine geometry and robustness due to (\textit{i}) the scarcity of high-fidelity depth and pose supervision and (\textit{ii}) the inherent geometric misalignment from multi-view pointmap regression. Fin3R jointly tackles two issues with an extra lightweight fine-tuning step. We freeze the decoder, which handles view matching, and fine-tune only the image encoder-the component dedicated to feature extraction. The encoder is enriched with fine geometric details distilled from a strong monocular teacher model on large, unlabeled datasets, using a custom, lightweight LoRA adapter. We validate our method on a wide range of models, including DUSt3R, MASt3R, CUT3R, and VGGT. The fine-tuned models consistently deliver sharper boundaries, recover complex structures, and achieve higher geometric accuracy in both single- and multi-view settings, while adding only the tiny LoRA weights, which leave test-time memory and latency virtually unchanged.

Motivation: 当前基于骨架的动作识别方法虽然利用LLM获取语义先验，但LLM与识别模型分离，缺乏性能反馈，无法提供区分相似动作的关键判别性线索。

Method: 提出SkeletonAgent框架，包含两个协作智能体：1）Questioner识别最易混淆的动作类别，作为上下文提供给LLM以获得针对性指导；2）Selector解析LLM响应，提取精确的关节级约束反馈给识别器，实现细粒度跨模态对齐。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D、NTU RGB+D 120、Kinetics-Skeleton、FineGYM和UAV-Human五个基准测试上全面评估，均优于最先进的基准方法。

Conclusion: SkeletonAgent通过协同智能体有效连接识别模型与LLM，使LLM能提供更具判别性的语义指导，显著提升骨架动作识别性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in skeleton-based action recognition increasingly leverage semantic priors from Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich skeletal representations. However, the LLM is typically queried in isolation from the recognition model and receives no performance feedback. As a result, it often fails to deliver the targeted discriminative cues critical to distinguish similar actions. To overcome these limitations, we propose SkeletonAgent, a novel framework that bridges the recognition model and the LLM through two cooperative agents, i.e., Questioner and Selector. Specifically, the Questioner identifies the most frequently confused classes and supplies them to the LLM as context for more targeted guidance. Conversely, the Selector parses the LLM's response to extract precise joint-level constraints and feeds them back to the recognizer, enabling finer-grained cross-modal alignment. Comprehensive evaluations on five benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, Kinetics-Skeleton, FineGYM, and UAV-Human, demonstrate that SkeletonAgent consistently outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark methods.

Motivation: 少样本多类别工业异常检测面临挑战：视觉语言模型需要既具有类别适应性又具有尖锐判别性，但数据稀缺常常模糊正常与异常状态之间的边界，导致错过细微缺陷和拒绝非典型正常样本。

Method: 提出ABounD框架，包含两个核心模块：1) 动态概念融合(DCF)模块，通过融合泛化先验和类别特定线索生成类别自适应提示；2) 对抗边界锻造(ABF)模块，通过PGD风格扰动生成边界级围栏特征，塑造更精确的决策边界。使用概念-边界损失进行单阶段训练。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的实验表明，该方法在少样本多类别异常检测任务中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ABounD通过语义概念学习和决策边界塑造的协同作用，产生了一个紧密跟随正常数据同时保持灵活性和鲁棒语义对齐的决策边界，有效解决了少样本工业异常检测中的边界模糊问题。

Abstract: Few-shot multi-class industrial anomaly detection remains a challenging task. Vision-language models need to be both category-adaptive and sharply discriminative, yet data scarcity often blurs the boundary between normal and abnormal states. This ambiguity leads to missed subtle defects and the rejection of atypical normal samples. We propose ABounD, an Adversarial Boundary-Driven few-shot learning for multi-class anomaly detection, which is a unified learning framework that integrates semantic concept learning with decision boundary shaping. The Dynamic Concept Fusion (DCF) module produces class-adaptive prompts by fusing generalizable priors with class-specific cues, conditioned on image features. Meanwhile, Adversarial Boundary Forging (ABF) sculpts a more precise decision margin by generating boundary-level fence features via PGD-style perturbations. Training is conducted in a single stage under a Concept-Boundary Loss, where ABF provides the main supervisory signal and semantic-spatial regularizers stabilize the optimization. This synergy yields a decision boundary that closely follows normal data while preserving flexibility and robust semantic alignment. Experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in the task of few-shot multi-class anomaly detection.

Abstract: Deepfake generation has witnessed remarkable progress, contributing to highly realistic generated images, videos, and audio. While technically intriguing, such progress has raised serious concerns related to the misuse of manipulated media. To mitigate such misuse, robust and reliable deepfake detection is urgently needed. Towards this, we propose a novel network FauxNet, which is based on pre-trained Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) features. By extracting temporal VSR features from videos, we identify and segregate real videos from manipulated ones. The holy grail in this context has to do with zero-shot detection, i.e., generalizable detection, which we focus on in this work. FauxNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art in this setting. In addition, FauxNet is able to attribute - distinguish between generation techniques from which the videos stem. Finally, we propose new datasets, referred to as Authentica-Vox and Authentica-HDTF, comprising about 38,000 real and fake videos in total, the latter created with six recent deepfake generation techniques. We provide extensive analysis and results on the Authentica datasets and FaceForensics++, demonstrating the superiority of FauxNet. The Authentica datasets will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子点处理器规模化需要自动调谐策略，而准确识别电荷稳定图中的设备状态是关键。需要评估不同机器学习架构在实际应用中的表现。

Method: 对四种现代ML架构（U-Nets、视觉变换器、混合密度网络、卷积神经网络）进行基准测试，使用合成和实验数据，评估不同数据预算和归一化方案下的性能。

Result: U-Nets和ViTs在合成数据上表现最佳（MSE分数>0.98），但无法泛化到实验数据。MDNs计算效率最高但性能较低。CNNs在实验数据上表现最佳，参数比U-Nets和ViTs少两个数量级。min-max归一化通常得分更高但收敛不稳定，z-score归一化训练更稳定但准确率较低。

Conclusion: CNN配合min-max归一化是量子点电荷稳定图状态识别的实用方法，在性能和计算效率之间取得了最佳平衡。

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are a leading platform for scalable quantum processors. However, scaling to large arrays requires reliable, automated tuning strategies for devices' bootstrapping, calibration, and operation, with many tuning aspects depending on accurately identifying QD device states from charge-stability diagrams (CSDs). In this work, we present a comprehensive benchmarking study of four modern machine learning (ML) architectures for multi-class state recognition in double-QD CSDs. We evaluate their performance across different data budgets and normalization schemes using both synthetic and experimental data. We find that the more resource-intensive models -- U-Nets and visual transformers (ViTs) -- achieve the highest MSE score (defined as $1-\mathrm{MSE}$) on synthetic data (over $0.98$) but fail to generalize to experimental data. MDNs are the most computationally efficient and exhibit highly stable training, but with substantially lower peak performance. CNNs offer the most favorable trade-off on experimental CSDs, achieving strong accuracy with two orders of magnitude fewer parameters than the U-Nets and ViTs. Normalization plays a nontrivial role: min-max scaling generally yields higher MSE scores but less stable convergence, whereas z-score normalization produces more predictable training dynamics but at reduced accuracy for most models. Overall, our study shows that CNNs with min-max normalization are a practical approach for QD CSDs.

Conclusion: 从真实性检测转向意图分析是应对深度伪造威胁的重要范式转变，IntentHQ基准为理解视频背后的动机和目标提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has led to increasingly realistic deepfake videos, posing significant societal and security risks. While existing detection methods focus on distinguishing real from fake videos, such approaches fail to address a fundamental question: What is the intent behind a manipulated video? Towards addressing this question, we introduce IntentHQ: a new benchmark for human-centered intent analysis, shifting the paradigm from authenticity verification to contextual understanding of videos. IntentHQ consists of 5168 videos that have been meticulously collected and annotated with 23 fine-grained intent-categories, including "Financial fraud", "Indirect marketing", "Political propaganda", as well as "Fear mongering". We perform intent recognition with supervised and self-supervised multi-modality models that integrate spatio-temporal video features, audio processing, and text analysis to infer underlying motivations and goals behind videos. Our proposed model is streamlined to differentiate between a wide range of intent-categories.

TL;DR: ITS3D：通过推理时缩放优化高斯噪声输入，提升文本引导3D扩散模型生成质量，无需额外训练


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在文本引导3D扩散模型中通过推理时缩放来提升生成质量，避免额外的训练成本。当前3D生成面临稳定性、计算复杂度和局部最优等挑战。

Method: 提出ITS3D框架，将任务形式化为优化问题，寻找最优高斯噪声输入。采用验证器引导的搜索算法，迭代优化噪声候选。引入三项关键技术：1）高斯归一化稳定搜索过程；2）SVD压缩降低高维搜索空间复杂度；3）奇异空间重置机制防止陷入局部最优。

Result: 大量实验表明ITS3D显著提升了文本到3D的生成质量，证明了计算高效搜索方法在生成过程中的潜力。

Conclusion: ITS3D展示了通过推理时优化而非额外训练来提升3D扩散模型性能的有效性，为生成模型的高效优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: We explore inference-time scaling in text-guided 3D diffusion models to enhance generative quality without additional training. To this end, we introduce ITS3D, a framework that formulates the task as an optimization problem to identify the most effective Gaussian noise input. The framework is driven by a verifier-guided search algorithm, where the search algorithm iteratively refines noise candidates based on verifier feedback. To address the inherent challenges of 3D generation, we introduce three techniques for improved stability, efficiency, and exploration capability. 1) Gaussian normalization is applied to stabilize the search process. It corrects distribution shifts when noise candidates deviate from a standard Gaussian distribution during iterative updates. 2) The high-dimensional nature of the 3D search space increases computational complexity. To mitigate this, a singular value decomposition-based compression technique is employed to reduce dimensionality while preserving effective search directions. 3) To further prevent convergence to suboptimal local minima, a singular space reset mechanism dynamically updates the search space based on diversity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ITS3D enhances text-to-3D generation quality, which shows the potential of computationally efficient search methods in generative processes.

Motivation: 火焰的动态重建极具挑战性，因其具有易变性、透明性和高频特征。现有方法需要大量视角，本文旨在仅用三个视角解决欠约束几何问题

Method: 1) 结合多视角立体图像与单目深度先验分离静态背景与动态火焰区域；2) 通过融合各视角密集光流投影初始化3D流场；3) 每个3D高斯编码生命周期和线性速度以匹配光流；4) 使用硬件同步确保跨相机亚帧时间对齐

Result: 在多种挑战性真实火焰场景的重建实验中，定量和定性验证均表现出稳健性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够使用廉价商用硬件，仅需三个视角即可有效重建具有高频特征的动态火焰，解决了火焰重建中的几何欠约束问题

Abstract: We propose a method to reconstruct dynamic fire in 3D from a limited set of camera views with a Gaussian-based spatiotemporal representation. Capturing and reconstructing fire and its dynamics is highly challenging due to its volatile nature, transparent quality, and multitude of high-frequency features. Despite these challenges, we aim to reconstruct fire from only three views, which consequently requires solving for under-constrained geometry. We solve this by separating the static background from the dynamic fire region by combining dense multi-view stereo images with monocular depth priors. The fire is initialized as a 3D flow field, obtained by fusing per-view dense optical flow projections. To capture the high frequency features of fire, each 3D Gaussian encodes a lifetime and linear velocity to match the dense optical flow. To ensure sub-frame temporal alignment across cameras we employ a custom hardware synchronization pattern -- allowing us to reconstruct fire with affordable commodity hardware. Our quantitative and qualitative validations across numerous reconstruction experiments demonstrate robust performance for diverse and challenging real fire scenarios.

Conclusion: RoadSceneBench填补了现有基准在道路场景推理能力评估上的空白，HRRP-T框架使模型能够超越静态识别，实现几何感知和时间一致的推理

Abstract: Understanding mid-level road semantics, which capture the structural and contextual cues that link low-level perception to high-level planning, is essential for reliable autonomous driving and digital map construction. However, existing benchmarks primarily target perception tasks such as detection or segmentation, overlooking the reasoning capabilities required to infer road topology and dynamic scene structure. To address this gap, we present RoadSceneBench, a lightweight yet information-rich benchmark designed to evaluate and advance visual reasoning in complex road environments. Unlike large-scale perception datasets, RoadSceneBench emphasizes relational understanding and structural consistency, encouraging models to capture the underlying logic of real-world road scenes. Furthermore, to enhance reasoning reliability, we propose Hierarchical Relational Reward Propagation with Temporal Consistency (HRRP-T), a training framework for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in which reward signals adaptively promote spatial coherence and semantic alignment throughout the reasoning process. This paradigm enables models to move beyond static recognition toward geometry-aware and temporally consistent reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse road configurations. RoadSceneBench thus provides a compact yet powerful foundation for studying mid-level road semantics and fostering structure-aware autonomous perception.

Abstract: Text-based person anomaly retrieval has emerged as a challenging task, with most existing approaches relying on complex deep-learning techniques. This raises a research question: How can the model be optimized to achieve greater fine-grained features? To address this, we propose a Local-Global Hybrid Perspective (LHP) module integrated with a Vision-Language Model (VLM), designed to explore the effectiveness of incorporating both fine-grained features alongside coarse-grained features. Additionally, we investigate a Unified Image-Text (UIT) model that combines multiple objective loss functions, including Image-Text Contrastive (ITC), Image-Text Matching (ITM), Masked Language Modeling (MLM), and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) loss. Beyond this, we propose a novel iterative ensemble strategy, by combining iteratively instead of using model results simultaneously like other ensemble methods. To take advantage of the superior performance of the LHP model, we introduce a novel feature selection algorithm based on its guidance, which helps improve the model's performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on PAB dataset, compared with previous work, with a 9.70\% improvement in R@1, 1.77\% improvement in R@5, and 1.01\% improvement in R@10.

Abstract: As generative models become increasingly diverse and powerful, cross-generator detection has emerged as a new challenge. Existing detection methods often memorize artifacts of specific generative models rather than learning transferable cues, leading to substantial failures on unseen generators. Surprisingly, this work finds that frozen visual foundation models, especially DINOv3, already exhibit strong cross-generator detection capability without any fine-tuning. Through systematic studies on frequency, spatial, and token perspectives, we observe that DINOv3 tends to rely on global, low-frequency structures as weak but transferable authenticity cues instead of high-frequency, generator-specific artifacts. Motivated by this insight, we introduce a simple, training-free token-ranking strategy followed by a lightweight linear probe to select a small subset of authenticity-relevant tokens. This token subset consistently improves detection accuracy across all evaluated datasets. Our study provides empirical evidence and a feasible hypothesis for understanding why foundation models generalize across diverse generators, offering a universal, efficient, and interpretable baseline for image forgery detection.

Abstract: We propose Dimitra++, a novel framework for audio-driven talking head generation, streamlined to learn lip motion, facial expression, as well as head pose motion. Specifically, we propose a conditional Motion Diffusion Transformer (cMDT) to model facial motion sequences, employing a 3D representation. The cMDT is conditioned on two inputs: a reference facial image, which determines appearance, as well as an audio sequence, which drives the motion. Quantitative and qualitative experiments, as well as a user study on two widely employed datasets, i.e., VoxCeleb2 and CelebV-HQ, suggest that Dimitra++ is able to outperform existing approaches in generating realistic talking heads imparting lip motion, facial expression, and head pose.

Abstract: As the number of scientific papers continues to grow, there is a demand for approaches that can effectively convey research findings, with posters serving as a key medium for presenting paper contents. Poster layouts determine how effectively research is communicated and understood, highlighting their growing importance. In particular, a gap remains in understanding how papers correspond to the layouts that present them, which calls for datasets with paired annotations at scale. To bridge this gap, we introduce SciPostGen, a large-scale dataset for understanding and generating poster layouts from scientific papers. Our analyses based on SciPostGen show that paper structures are associated with the number of layout elements in posters. Based on this insight, we explore a framework, Retrieval-Augmented Poster Layout Generation, which retrieves layouts consistent with a given paper and uses them as guidance for layout generation. We conducted experiments under two conditions: with and without layout constraints typically specified by poster creators. The results show that the retriever estimates layouts aligned with paper structures, and our framework generates layouts that also satisfy given constraints.

Abstract: The advent of generative models has dramatically improved the accuracy of image inpainting. In particular, by removing specific text from document images, reconstructing original images is extremely important for industrial applications. However, most existing methods of text removal focus on deleting simple scene text which appears in images captured by a camera in an outdoor environment. There is little research dedicated to complex and practical images with dense text. Therefore, we created benchmark data for text removal from images including a large amount of text. From the data, we found that text-removal performance becomes vulnerable against mask profile perturbation. Thus, for practical text-removal tasks, precise tuning of the mask shape is essential. This study developed a method to model highly flexible mask profiles and learn their parameters using Bayesian optimization. The resulting profiles were found to be character-wise masks. It was also found that the minimum cover of a text region is not optimal. Our research is expected to pave the way for a user-friendly guideline for manual masking.

Motivation: 当前DocVQA系统存在精度与效率的尖锐权衡：大型教师模型精度高但部署成本高，紧凑学生模型定位性能大幅下降。需要将教师的空间推理能力高效转移到学生模型中。

Method: 提出DocVAL框架，包含三个关键组件：1) 验证时文本检测的教师监督，过滤和去噪训练信号；2) 多模块验证器(VAL)，确保答案正确性和几何一致性，提供像素级错误反馈；3) 两阶段学生训练方案，先学习验证后的CoT轨迹，再通过VAL反馈进行迭代优化。

Conclusion: DocVAL通过验证式思维链蒸馏有效解决了DocVQA中精度与效率的权衡问题，成功将教师模型的空间推理能力转移到可部署的学生VLM中，为文档理解中的空间推理研究提供了高质量数据集。

Abstract: Document visual question answering (DocVQA) requires models to jointly reason over textual content and spatial layout, yet current systems exhibit a sharp accuracy--efficiency trade-off: large teacher models achieve strong grounding but are too expensive for deployment, while compact students suffer substantial drops in localization performance. We propose DocVAL, a validated chain-of-thought distillation framework that transfers the spatial reasoning ability of a large teacher into a deployable student VLM through three key components: (1) teacher supervision with validation-time text detection to filter and denoise training signals, (2) a multi-module validator (VAL) that enforces answer correctness and geometric consistency while producing fine-grained, pixel-level error feedback, and (3) a two-stage student training scheme that first learns from validated CoT traces and then undergoes iterative refinement driven by VAL feedback. Our student (Gemma-3 12B) achieves 91.4\% ANLS and 82.4\% mAP on DocVQA as a pure VLM requiring no text detection or OCR at inference. Extensive ablations demonstrate that validated feedback contributes 6.3 mAP gain and iterative refinement accounts for 9.7 mAP improvement. We release 95k high-quality, validator-verified CoT traces to advance spatial reasoning research in document understanding.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently attracted growing attention in end-to-end autonomous driving for their strong reasoning capabilities and rich world knowledge. However, existing VLAs often suffer from limited numerical reasoning ability and overly simplified input-output mappings, which hinder their performance in complex driving scenarios requiring step-by-step causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose CoT4AD, a novel VLA framework that introduces Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for autonomous driving to enhance both numerical and causal reasoning in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). CoT4AD integrates visual observations and language instructions to perform semantic reasoning, scene understanding, and trajectory planning. During training, it explicitly models a perception-question-prediction-action CoT to align the reasoning space with the action space across multiple driving tasks. During inference, it performs implicit CoT reasoning to enable consistent numerical reasoning and robust decision-making in dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulated benchmarks, including nuScenes and Bench2Drive, demonstrate that CoT4AD achieves state-of-the-art performance in both open-loop and closed-loop evaluations. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

Motivation: 现有缓存方法在2D和视频生成中有效，但直接应用于3D扩散模型会破坏几何一致性，因为缓存潜在特征中的微小数值误差会累积导致结构伪影和拓扑不一致。

Conclusion: Fast3Dcache是一种有效的训练免费解决方案，能够在保持3D几何保真度的同时显著加速扩散模型推理，解决了现有缓存方法在3D合成中的几何一致性破坏问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive generative quality across modalities like 2D images, videos, and 3D shapes, but their inference remains computationally expensive due to the iterative denoising process. While recent caching-based methods effectively reuse redundant computations to speed up 2D and video generation, directly applying these techniques to 3D diffusion models can severely disrupt geometric consistency. In 3D synthesis, even minor numerical errors in cached latent features accumulate, causing structural artifacts and topological inconsistencies. To overcome this limitation, we propose Fast3Dcache, a training-free geometry-aware caching framework that accelerates 3D diffusion inference while preserving geometric fidelity. Our method introduces a Predictive Caching Scheduler Constraint (PCSC) to dynamically determine cache quotas according to voxel stabilization patterns and a Spatiotemporal Stability Criterion (SSC) to select stable features for reuse based on velocity magnitude and acceleration criterion. Comprehensive experiments show that Fast3Dcache accelerates inference significantly, achieving up to a 27.12% speed-up and a 54.8% reduction in FLOPs, with minimal degradation in geometric quality as measured by Chamfer Distance (2.48%) and F-Score (1.95%).

Abstract: Image compression methods are usually optimized isolatedly for human perception or machine analysis tasks. We reveal fundamental commonalities between these objectives: preserving accurate semantic information is paramount, as it directly dictates the integrity of critical information for intelligent tasks and aids human understanding. Concurrently, enhanced perceptual quality not only improves visual appeal but also, by ensuring realistic image distributions, benefits semantic feature extraction for machine tasks. Based on this insight, we propose Diff-ICMH, a generative image compression framework aiming for harmonizing machine and human vision in image compression. It ensures perceptual realism by leveraging generative priors and simultaneously guarantees semantic fidelity through the incorporation of Semantic Consistency loss (SC loss) during training. Additionally, we introduce the Tag Guidance Module (TGM) that leverages highly semantic image-level tags to stimulate the pre-trained diffusion model's generative capabilities, requiring minimal additional bit rates. Consequently, Diff-ICMH supports multiple intelligent tasks through a single codec and bitstream without any task-specific adaptation, while preserving high-quality visual experience for human perception. Extensive experimental results demonstrate Diff-ICMH's superiority and generalizability across diverse tasks, while maintaining visual appeal for human perception.

Abstract: We present a unified framework for reconstructing animatable 3D human avatars from a single portrait across head, half-body, and full-body inputs. Our method tackles three bottlenecks: pose- and framing-sensitive feature representations, limited scalable data, and unreliable proxy-mesh estimation. We introduce a Dual-UV representation that maps image features to a canonical UV space via Core-UV and Shell-UV branches, eliminating pose- and framing-induced token shifts. We also build a factorized synthetic data manifold combining 2D generative diversity with geometry-consistent 3D renderings, supported by a training scheme that improves realism and identity consistency. A robust proxy-mesh tracker maintains stability under partial visibility. Together, these components enable strong in-the-wild generalization. Trained only on half-body synthetic data, our model achieves state-of-the-art head and upper-body reconstruction and competitive full-body results.

Abstract: The abutment is an important part of artificial dental implants, whose design process is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Long-term use of inappropriate dental implant abutments may result in implant complications, including peri-implantitis. Using artificial intelligence to assist dental implant abutment design can quickly improve the efficiency of abutment design and enhance abutment adaptability. In this paper, we propose a text condition embedded abutment design framework (TCEAD), the novel automated abutment design solution available in literature. The proposed study extends the self-supervised learning framework of the mesh mask autoencoder (MeshMAE) by introducing a text-guided localization (TGL) module to facilitate abutment area localization. As the parameter determination of the abutment is heavily dependent on local fine-grained features (the width and height of the implant and the distance to the opposing tooth), we pre-train the encoder using oral scan data to improve the model's feature extraction ability. Moreover, considering that the abutment area is only a small part of the oral scan data, we designed a TGL module, which introduces the description of the abutment area through the text encoder of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), enabling the network to quickly locate the abutment area. We validated the performance of TCEAD on a large abutment design dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCEAD achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) improvement of 0.8%-12.85% over other mainstream methods, underscoring its potential in automated dental abutment design.

TL;DR: 研究不同思维链设计对视觉语言模型泛化推理能力的影响，发现简洁的视觉基础思维链效果最好，存在"短即长"效应


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然思维链数据（特别是长链或视觉思维链）被广泛用于监督中间推理，但不同思维链设计如何影响视觉语言模型的泛化推理能力尚不清楚，需要系统评估

Method: 使用迷宫求解基准进行控制实验，比较三种代表性思维链格式：语言思维链、基础思维链（含空间坐标轨迹）和视觉思维链（含图像操作），在Qwen2.5-VL-7B模型上进行标准SFT-then-RL训练

Result: 视觉和长思维链主要加速收敛但不提升最终性能上限；简洁的仅含必要基础步骤的思维链优于长轨迹；仅保留最小基础结果的思维链在不同迷宫尺寸上泛化效果最好

Conclusion: 研究揭示了"短即长"效应，为构建更具泛化性的视觉推理SFT数据集提供了实用指导

Abstract: We study how different Chain-of-Thought (CoT) designs affect the acquisition of the generalizable visual reasoning ability in vision-language models (VLMs). While CoT data, especially long or visual CoT such as "think with image", has been widely used to supervise intermediate reasoning, it remains unclear why specific CoT designs help and which ones truly support generalizable reasoning. To systematically evaluate this, we focus on a controlled maze-solving benchmark where reasoning rules are fully visual, difficulty can be tuned by grid size, and all the intermediate steps can be automatically generated. Using Qwen2.5-VL-7B under a standard SFT-then-RL pipeline, we compare three representative CoT formats: Language CoT, Grounding CoT (with spatial coordinate trajectories), and Visual CoT (with image manipulations). Our experiments reveal that visual and longer CoT mainly accelerate convergence but do not lift the final performance ceiling; concise CoT containing only essential grounding steps outperforms longer traces; and, strikingly, CoT retaining only the minimal grounding results generalizes best across different maze sizes. We further validate these insights on other vision-centric tasks. These findings highlight a "short is long" effect and provide practical guidance for constructing more generalizable SFT datasets for visual reasoning.

TL;DR: HarmoCLIP提出了一种新颖框架，通过引入细粒度语义监督和区域-语言对齐策略，解决了CLIP在全局与局部表示之间的权衡问题，实现了两者和谐统一。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP虽然表现出强大的泛化能力，但由于缺乏区域级监督，其细粒度语义理解能力有限。现有方法试图解决此问题，但往往破坏全局对齐，导致全局与局部表示之间存在权衡取舍。

Method: 1) 识别局部文本与视觉语义缺乏直接对齐是权衡问题的根本原因；2) 引入显式细粒度语义监督项，直接对齐文本片段与对应视觉区域；3) 提出区域-语言对齐监督策略，在不损害全局语义一致性的前提下增强局部表示能力。

Result: 在全局检索任务上达到SOTA（提升高达69.78%），在边界框分类的区域任务上Top-1准确率提升3.2%，优于现有方法，提供平衡、高效、即插即用的解决方案。

Conclusion: HarmoCLIP成功解决了CLIP中全局与局部表示的权衡问题，通过显式细粒度对齐实现了两者的和谐统一，同时提升了全局和局部任务的性能。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated remarkable generalization ability and strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the lack of region-level supervision, CLIP exhibits limited fine-grained semantic understanding. Although several methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they unintentionally disrupt the global alignment, resulting in a persistent trade-off where improving local perception simultaneously degrades global coherence. In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

TL;DR: AnoRefiner通过异常感知细化器将ZSAD模型的补丁级异常检测提升到像素级，利用异常分数图提供空间线索，减少对合成异常数据的依赖，并采用渐进式组间测试时训练策略。

Motivation: 现有零样本工业异常检测方法只能生成粗糙的补丁级异常图，而现有细化方法因合成异常与真实异常之间的差距，难以恢复细粒度异常且存在漏检问题。作者发现异常分数图能提供ZSAD图像特征中缺失的互补空间线索。

Method: 提出AnoRefiner框架：1）设计异常细化解码器，利用异常分数图渐进增强图像特征，减少对合成数据的依赖；2）提出渐进式组间测试时训练策略，在每个产品组中训练ARD用于下一组的细化过程，兼容任何ZSAD方法。

Conclusion: AnoRefiner通过利用异常分数图的互补空间信息，有效将ZSAD模型的补丁级异常检测提升到像素级，显著提高了细粒度异常检测性能，且具有很好的兼容性和实用性。

Abstract: Zero-shot industrial anomaly detection (ZSAD) methods typically yield coarse anomaly maps as vision transformers (ViTs) extract patch-level features only. To solve this, recent solutions attempt to predict finer anomalies using features from ZSAD, but they still struggle to recover fine-grained anomalies without missed detections, mainly due to the gap between randomly synthesized training anomalies and real ones. We observe that anomaly score maps exactly provide complementary spatial cues that are largely absent from ZSAD's image features, a fact overlooked before.
  Inspired by this, we propose an anomaly-aware refiner (AnoRefiner) that can be plugged into most ZSAD models and improve patch-level anomaly maps to the pixel level. First, we design an anomaly refinement decoder (ARD) that progressively enhances image features using anomaly score maps, reducing the reliance on synthetic anomaly data. Second, motivated by the mass production paradigm, we propose a progressive group-wise test-time training (PGT) strategy that trains ARD in each product group for the refinement process in the next group, while staying compatible with any ZSAD method.
  Experiments on the MVTec AD and VisA datasets show that AnoRefiner boosts various ZSAD models by up to a 5.2\% gain in pixel-AP metrics, which can also be directly observed in many visualizations. The code will be available at https://github.com/HUST-SLOW/AnoRefiner.

We propose a novel shape error regularization method to constrain pupil ellipse fitting and train on open-source datasets, enhancing semantic segmentation and pupil position prediction accuracy. Additionally, we invent a novel coordinate transformation method similar to paper unfolding to accurately predict gaze vectors on the GazeTrack dataset. Finally, we built a gaze vector generation model that achieves reduced gaze angle error with lower computational complexity compared to other methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的视觉导航方法在处理长视野导航、动态环境变化和未见场景时面临挑战，需要一种能够统一全局规划和局部控制、同时保持对几何结构感知的框架。

Method: 1. 构建稀疏空间记忆图(SMG)，以区域为中心聚合多视角关键帧和物体语义；2. 全局层面：在SMG上定位并规划节点路径；3. 局部层面：使用导航基础策略执行路径点；4. 引入VGGT-adapter增强视角对齐和目标识别；5. 不同频率执行全局规划和局部控制，定期重新定位纠正误差。

Conclusion: MG-Nav通过双尺度框架成功统一了全局记忆引导规划和局部几何增强控制，为复杂环境中的零样本视觉导航提供了有效解决方案，展示了在动态和未见场景中的强大适应性。

Abstract: We present MG-Nav (Memory-Guided Navigation), a dual-scale framework for zero-shot visual navigation that unifies global memory-guided planning with local geometry-enhanced control. At its core is the Sparse Spatial Memory Graph (SMG), a compact, region-centric memory where each node aggregates multi-view keyframe and object semantics, capturing both appearance and spatial structure while preserving viewpoint diversity. At the global level, the agent is localized on SMG and a goal-conditioned node path is planned via an image-to-instance hybrid retrieval, producing a sequence of reachable waypoints for long-horizon guidance. At the local level, a navigation foundation policy executes these waypoints in point-goal mode with obstacle-aware control, and switches to image-goal mode when navigating from the final node towards the visual target. To further enhance viewpoint alignment and goal recognition, we introduce VGGT-adapter, a lightweight geometric module built on the pre-trained VGGT model, which aligns observation and goal features in a shared 3D-aware space. MG-Nav operates global planning and local control at different frequencies, using periodic re-localization to correct errors. Experiments on HM3D Instance-Image-Goal and MP3D Image-Goal benchmarks demonstrate that MG-Nav achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance and remains robust under dynamic rearrangements and unseen scene conditions.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学影像中需要持续适应新医院数据，但传统方法会导致灾难性遗忘，严重限制了AI在医疗领域的部署。

Method: 提出潜在漂移引导的重放方法：1）通过潜在漂移量化样本表示不稳定性；2）在患者层面聚合漂移；3）存储多层表示变化最大的切片到记忆缓冲区。

Result: 在跨医院COVID-19 CT分类任务上，使用CNN和Vision Transformer骨干网络，相比朴素微调和随机重放，显著减少了遗忘。

Conclusion: 潜在漂移作为实用且可解释的重放信号，能够推进医学影像中鲁棒持续学习的发展。

Abstract: When deep learning models are sequentially trained on new data, they tend to abruptly lose performance on previously learned tasks, a critical failure known as catastrophic forgetting. This challenge severely limits the deployment of AI in medical imaging, where models must continually adapt to data from new hospitals without compromising established diagnostic knowledge. To address this, we introduce a latent drift-guided replay method that identifies and replays samples with high representational instability. Specifically, our method quantifies this instability via latent drift, the change in a sample internal feature representation after naive domain adaptation. To ensure diversity and clinical relevance, we aggregate drift at the patient level, our memory buffer stores the per patient slices exhibiting the greatest multi-layer representation shift. Evaluated on a cross-hospital COVID-19 CT classification task using state-of-the-art CNN and Vision Transformer backbones, our method substantially reduces forgetting compared to naive fine-tuning and random replay. This work highlights latent drift as a practical and interpretable replay signal for advancing robust continual learning in real world medical settings.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种通过解锁MLLM推理能力来提升图像编辑模型性能的新框架，采用思考-编辑-反思循环机制，在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型通常将多模态大语言模型（MLLM）编码器与扩散解码器耦合，但MLLM在训练过程中保持冻结状态。作者认为解锁MLLM的推理能力可以进一步提升编辑模型的边界。

Method: 提出思考-编辑-反思循环框架：思考机制利用MLLM的世界知识解释抽象指令；反思机制审查编辑结果，自动纠正非预期操作，并确定停止轮次。基于Step1X-Edit和Qwen-Image-Edit构建了两个版本（ReasonEdit-S和ReasonEdit-Q）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升：基于Step1X-Edit的版本在ImgEdit、GEdit和Kris上分别提升4.3%、4.7%和8.2%；基于Qwen-Image-Edit的版本在GEdit和Kris上超越先前开源方法。

Conclusion: 解锁MLLM的推理能力（思考和反思机制）能够显著提升图像编辑模型的性能，为图像编辑系统设计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in image editing models have shown remarkable progress. A common architectural design couples a multimodal large language model (MLLM) encoder with a diffusion decoder, as seen in systems such as Step1X-Edit and Qwen-Image-Edit, where the MLLM encodes both the reference image and the instruction but remains frozen during training. In this work, we demonstrate that unlocking the reasoning capabilities of MLLM can further push the boundaries of editing models. Specifically, we explore two reasoning mechanisms, thinking and reflection, which enhance instruction understanding and editing accuracy. Based on that, our proposed framework enables image editing in a thinking-editing-reflection loop: the thinking mechanism leverages the world knowledge of MLLM to interpret abstract instructions, while the reflection reviews editing results, automatically corrects unintended manipulations, and identifies the stopping round. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reasoning approach achieves significant performance gains, with improvements of ImgEdit (+4.3%), GEdit (+4.7%), and Kris (+8.2%) when initializing our DiT from the Step1X-Edit (ReasonEdit-S), and also outperforms previous open-source methods on both GEdit and Kris when integrated with Qwen-Image-Edit (ReasonEdit-Q).

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have undergone rapid development in advancing geospatial scene understanding. Recent studies have sought to enhance the reasoning capabilities of remote sensing MLLMs, typically through cold-start training with elaborately curated chain-of-thought (CoT) data. However, this approach not only incurs substantial annotation costs but also introduces human biases that may limit the diversity of model reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose GeoZero, a framework that enables MLLMs to perform geospatial reasoning without any predefined CoT supervision. Specifically, we construct two datasets, GeoZero-Instruct and GeoZero-Hard. GeoZero-Instruct allows the model to acquire preliminary geospatial knowledge through supervised fine-tuning, while GeoZero-Hard stimulates deep reasoning during the subsequent reinforcement learning stage. Furthermore, we introduce Answer-Anchored Group Relative Policy Optimization (A$^2$GRPO), where the reasoning process is regularized by the model's own answers, encouraging diverse yet accurate thinking. Extensive experiments on multiple remote sensing vision-language benchmarks demonstrate that GeoZero not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods but also fosters universal emergent reasoning capabilities across diverse geospatial tasks. Code,data,and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/GeoZero.

Conclusion: 通过注意力交互对齐损失函数，可以在不进行模型解耦的情况下缓解统一多模态模型中理解与生成任务的冲突，同时提升两种任务的性能，为统一多模态模型的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models for image generation and understanding represent a significant step toward AGI and have attracted widespread attention from researchers. The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have shown strong generalization under zero-shot settings, yet adapting them to downstream tasks with limited supervision remains a significant challenge. Existing multi-modal prompt learning methods typically rely on fixed, shared prompts and deterministic parameters, which limits their ability to capture instance-level variation or model uncertainty across diverse tasks and domains. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel Variational Multi-Modal Prompt Learning (VaMP) framework that enables sample-specific, uncertainty-aware prompt tuning in multi-modal representation learning. VaMP generates instance-conditioned prompts by sampling from a learned posterior distribution, allowing the model to personalize its behavior based on input content. To further enhance the integration of local and global semantics, we introduce a class-aware prior derived from the instance representation and class prototype. Building upon these, we formulate prompt tuning as variational inference over latent prompt representations and train the entire framework end-to-end through reparameterized sampling. Experiments on few-shot and domain generalization benchmarks show that VaMP achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the benefits of modeling both uncertainty and task structure in our method.

Conclusion: 重新理解扩散模型蒸馏机制，为更系统化的蒸馏方法设计提供理论基础，已在Z-Image项目中成功应用

Abstract: Diffusion model distillation has emerged as a powerful technique for creating efficient few-step and single-step generators. Among these, Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) and its variants stand out for their impressive performance, which is widely attributed to their core mechanism of matching the student's output distribution to that of a pre-trained teacher model. In this work, we challenge this conventional understanding. Through a rigorous decomposition of the DMD training objective, we reveal that in complex tasks like text-to-image generation, where CFG is typically required for desirable few-step performance, the primary driver of few-step distillation is not distribution matching, but a previously overlooked component we identify as CFG Augmentation (CA). We demonstrate that this term acts as the core ``engine'' of distillation, while the Distribution Matching (DM) term functions as a ``regularizer'' that ensures training stability and mitigates artifacts. We further validate this decoupling by demonstrating that while the DM term is a highly effective regularizer, it is not unique; simpler non-parametric constraints or GAN-based objectives can serve the same stabilizing function, albeit with different trade-offs. This decoupling of labor motivates a more principled analysis of the properties of both terms, leading to a more systematic and in-depth understanding. This new understanding further enables us to propose principled modifications to the distillation process, such as decoupling the noise schedules for the engine and the regularizer, leading to further performance gains. Notably, our method has been adopted by the Z-Image ( https://github.com/Tongyi-MAI/Z-Image ) project to develop a top-tier 8-step image generation model, empirically validating the generalization and robustness of our findings.

TL;DR: 3D基础模型在极端视角下展现几何理解能力，通过轻量级对齐方案提升相对位姿估计，并发布新基准MegaUnScene


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究3D基础模型在极端非重叠视角下的推理能力，探索其内部表示在从未训练过的极端视角条件下的表现

Method: 1) 分析3DFMs的内部表示；2) 提出轻量级对齐方案，仅微调骨干网络偏置项，冻结所有解码器头；3) 构建MegaUnScene基准数据集

Result: 3DFMs展现出对极端视角几何的涌现理解能力；轻量级对齐方案显著提升极端视角下的相对位姿估计，同时不降低单图像深度或点云质量

Conclusion: 3D基础模型具有处理极端视角的潜力，轻量级对齐方案能有效提升其性能，MegaUnScene基准将为未来研究提供重要测试平台

Abstract: 3D foundation models (3DFMs) have recently transformed 3D vision, enabling joint prediction of depths, poses, and point maps directly from images. Yet their ability to reason under extreme, non-overlapping views remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study their internal representations and find that 3DFMs exhibit an emergent understanding of extreme-view geometry, despite never being trained for such conditions. To further enhance these capabilities, we introduce a lightweight alignment scheme that refines their internal 3D representation by tuning only a small subset of backbone bias terms, leaving all decoder heads frozen. This targeted adaptation substantially improves relative pose estimation under extreme viewpoints without degrading per-image depth or point quality. Additionally, we contribute MegaUnScene, a new benchmark of Internet scenes unseen by existing 3DFMs, with dedicated test splits for both relative pose estimation and dense 3D reconstruction. All code and data will be released.

TL;DR: Ar2Can是一个两阶段框架，通过解耦空间规划和身份渲染来解决多人生成问题，显著提升了人脸计数准确性和身份保持能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在多人生成场景中存在严重问题，经常出现人脸重复、身份合并或人数计算错误，需要专门解决多人生成的可靠性问题

Method: 提出两阶段框架：Architect模块预测结构化布局，指定每个人出现的位置；Artist模块合成逼真图像，使用空间接地的人脸匹配奖励（结合匈牙利空间对齐和ArcFace身份相似性）

Result: 在MultiHuman-Testbench评估中，Ar2Can在计数准确性和身份保持方面取得显著改进，同时保持高感知质量，且主要使用合成数据无需真实多人生成图像

Conclusion: Ar2Can通过解耦空间规划和身份渲染，有效解决了多人生成中的关键问题，为可靠的多人生成提供了新框架，且数据需求较低

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image generation, existing models consistently fail to produce reliable multi-human scenes, often duplicating faces, merging identities, or miscounting individuals. We present Ar2Can, a novel two-stage framework that disentangles spatial planning from identity rendering for multi-human generation. The Architect module predicts structured layouts, specifying where each person should appear. The Artist module then synthesizes photorealistic images, guided by a spatially-grounded face matching reward that combines Hungarian spatial alignment with ArcFace identity similarity. This approach ensures faces are rendered at correct locations and faithfully preserve reference identities. We develop two Architect variants, seamlessly integrated with our diffusion-based Artist model and optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using compositional rewards for count accuracy, image quality, and identity matching. Evaluated on the MultiHuman-Testbench, Ar2Can achieves substantial improvements in both count accuracy and identity preservation, while maintaining high perceptual quality. Notably, our method achieves these results using primarily synthetic data, without requiring real multi-human images.

TL;DR: Z-Image是一个6B参数的高效图像生成基础模型，采用S3-DiT架构，挑战了"不惜代价扩大规模"的范式，在显著降低计算成本的同时达到或超越领先商业模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前高性能图像生成模型主要由Nano Banana Pro、Seedream 4.0等专有系统主导，而开源替代品如Qwen-Image、Hunyuan-Image-3.0等参数规模庞大（20B-80B），在消费级硬件上推理和微调不切实际。需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出基于可扩展单流扩散Transformer（S3-DiT）架构的6B参数基础生成模型。通过系统优化整个模型生命周期，包括精选数据基础设施和简化训练课程。采用few-step蒸馏方案和奖励后训练得到Z-Image-Turbo，支持全向预训练范式训练编辑模型Z-Image-Edit。

Result: 模型在314K H800 GPU小时（约63万美元）内完成完整训练，Z-Image-Turbo在企业级H800 GPU上实现亚秒级推理延迟，兼容消费级硬件（<16GB VRAM）。在多个维度上性能达到或超越领先竞争对手，在逼真图像生成和双语文本渲染方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过显著降低计算开销，Z-Image证明了实现最先进结果的可行性。公开代码、权重和在线演示，促进可访问、经济实惠的最先进生成模型发展。

Abstract: The landscape of high-performance image generation models is currently dominated by proprietary systems, such as Nano Banana Pro and Seedream 4.0. Leading open-source alternatives, including Qwen-Image, Hunyuan-Image-3.0 and FLUX.2, are characterized by massive parameter counts (20B to 80B), making them impractical for inference, and fine-tuning on consumer-grade hardware. To address this gap, we propose Z-Image, an efficient 6B-parameter foundation generative model built upon a Scalable Single-Stream Diffusion Transformer (S3-DiT) architecture that challenges the "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. By systematically optimizing the entire model lifecycle -- from a curated data infrastructure to a streamlined training curriculum -- we complete the full training workflow in just 314K H800 GPU hours (approx. $630K). Our few-step distillation scheme with reward post-training further yields Z-Image-Turbo, offering both sub-second inference latency on an enterprise-grade H800 GPU and compatibility with consumer-grade hardware (<16GB VRAM). Additionally, our omni-pre-training paradigm also enables efficient training of Z-Image-Edit, an editing model with impressive instruction-following capabilities. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to or surpassing that of leading competitors across various dimensions. Most notably, Z-Image exhibits exceptional capabilities in photorealistic image generation and bilingual text rendering, delivering results that rival top-tier commercial models, thereby demonstrating that state-of-the-art results are achievable with significantly reduced computational overhead. We publicly release our code, weights, and online demo to foster the development of accessible, budget-friendly, yet state-of-the-art generative models.

TL;DR: Splat-SAP：一种前馈方法，从稀疏双目相机输入渲染以人为中心的场景新视角，通过像素级点图重建表示几何，采用两阶段学习策略实现高质量自由视点渲染


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法需要密集输入视角和每场景优化，而基于多视角立体的前馈方法需要大量重叠视角。本文旨在解决大稀疏性双目相机输入下的新视角渲染问题

Method: 两阶段学习策略：第一阶段通过迭代亲和力学习将点图转换到真实空间；第二阶段将两个输入视角的点图投影到目标视角平面，通过立体匹配细化几何，并在该平面上锚定高斯基元进行渲染

Result: 在多人中心数据集上验证，方法提高了点图重建的稳定性和自由视点渲染的视觉质量

Conclusion: Splat-SAP通过像素级点图重建和两阶段学习策略，有效解决了大稀疏性双目输入下的新视角渲染问题，无需3D监督即可实现高质量渲染

Abstract: We present Splat-SAP, a feed-forward approach to render novel views of human-centered scenes from binocular cameras with large sparsity. Gaussian Splatting has shown its promising potential in rendering tasks, but it typically necessitates per-scene optimization with dense input views. Although some recent approaches achieve feed-forward Gaussian Splatting rendering through geometry priors obtained by multi-view stereo, such approaches still require largely overlapped input views to establish the geometry prior. To bridge this gap, we leverage pixel-wise point map reconstruction to represent geometry which is robust to large sparsity for its independent view modeling. In general, we propose a two-stage learning strategy. In stage 1, we transform the point map into real space via an iterative affinity learning process, which facilitates camera control in the following. In stage 2, we project point maps of two input views onto the target view plane and refine such geometry via stereo matching. Furthermore, we anchor Gaussian primitives on this refined plane in order to render high-quality images. As a metric representation, the scale-aware point map in stage 1 is trained in a self-supervised manner without 3D supervision and stage 2 is supervised with photo-metric loss. We collect multi-view human-centered data and demonstrate that our method improves both the stability of point map reconstruction and the visual quality of free-viewpoint rendering.

TL;DR: ReAG提出了一种推理增强的多模态检索增强生成方法，通过粗粒度与细粒度检索结合批评模型过滤无关段落，采用强化学习增强推理能力，在知识密集型视觉问答任务上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在领域特定或知识密集型查询上表现不佳，因为相关信息在预训练数据中代表性不足。现有的基于知识的视觉问答方法虽然通过检索外部文档来增强回答生成，但存在检索精度低、段落噪声大和推理能力有限的问题。

Method: 提出ReAG方法：1）结合粗粒度和细粒度检索；2）使用批评模型过滤无关段落，确保高质量上下文；3）采用多阶段训练策略，利用强化学习增强对检索内容的推理能力；4）监督微调仅作为冷启动。

Result: 在Encyclopedic-VQA和InfoSeek数据集上的大量实验表明，ReAG显著优于先前方法，提高了回答准确性，并提供基于检索证据的可解释推理。

Conclusion: ReAG通过推理增强的多模态检索增强生成方法，有效解决了知识密集型视觉问答中的检索精度和推理能力问题，为多模态大语言模型在知识密集型任务上的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in jointly understanding text, images, and videos, often evaluated via Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, even state-of-the-art MLLMs struggle with domain-specific or knowledge-intensive queries, where relevant information is underrepresented in pre-training data. Knowledge-based VQA (KB-VQA) addresses this by retrieving external documents to condition answer generation, but current retrieval-augmented approaches suffer from low precision, noisy passages, and limited reasoning. To address this, we propose ReAG, a novel Reasoning-Augmented Multimodal RAG approach that combines coarse- and fine-grained retrieval with a critic model that filters irrelevant passages, ensuring high-quality additional context. The model follows a multi-stage training strategy leveraging reinforcement learning to enhance reasoning over retrieved content, while supervised fine-tuning serves only as a cold start. Extensive experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate that ReAG significantly outperforms prior methods, improving answer accuracy and providing interpretable reasoning grounded in retrieved evidence.

TL;DR: 提出DIPT方法，通过领域不变提示调优增强病理图像领域泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中存在领域偏移问题（染色协议、扫描设备、成像设置差异），现有视觉语言模型零样本性能有限且缺乏病理学语义描述符，需要数据驱动的领域特定提示学习方法

Method: 提出领域不变提示调优（DIPT），为每个领域学习多个输入标记，分别训练后跨领域平均得到领域不变提示，学生模型利用这些提示从PLIP文本编码器蒸馏知识

Result: 在组织病理学数据集上，相比现有最先进知识蒸馏方法，平均F1分数有显著提升

Conclusion: DIPT方法有助于在异构数据源的现实临床问题中部署鲁棒的计算病理学模型

Abstract: Domain generalization is critical in computational pathology (CPath) due to inherent domain shifts caused by variations in staining protocols, scanner devices, and imaging settings across clinical centers. Vision-language models (VLMs), such as PLIP-a pathology-tuned CLIP-trained on image-text pairs across diverse domains, serve as strong knowledge distillation sources. However, their zero-shot performance with predefined prompts remains limited due to sensitivity to prompt variations. Moreover, unlike natural images, histopathology centers lack semantic descriptors (e.g., 'sketch'), making it difficult to define domain-specific prompts for clinical centers. This requires a data-driven approach for learning domain-specific and ultimately class-generic continuous prompts. We propose Domain Invariant Prompt Tuning (DIPT) for knowledge distillation process, a novel step that learns multiple input tokens for each domain. These tokens are trained separately for each domain and are averaged across domains, leading to domain-invariant prompts. Our student model then distills knowledge from PLIP's text encoder by leveraging the prompts learned by DIPT. This leads to alignment of visual features with domain-invariant embeddings, enhancing generalization by training on multiple domains. Our method adds a significant improvement in average F1-score to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) knowledge distillation approaches in domain generalization with histopathology datasets. This work helps the way of deploying robust CPath models in real-world clinical problems with heterogeneous data sources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够生成真实且解剖学一致的双视图乳腺X线摄影图像的合成方法，以解决医学影像数据集稀缺问题，为数据增强提供有效工具。

Method: 使用预训练的三通道DDPM模型，在包含11020张筛查乳腺X线摄影图像的私有数据集上进行微调，评估了三种第三通道编码方式（求和、绝对差、零通道），生成500对合成图像，通过IoU、DSC、EMD、KS测试和视觉图灵测试进行定量和定性评估。

Result: 合成乳腺X线摄影图像在IoU和DSC分布上与真实图像相当（EMD=0.020，KS=0.077），使用求和或绝对差编码的模型在IoU和DSC上表现更优（p<0.001），生成的CC和MLO视图保持了跨视图一致性，6-8%的合成图像存在与训练数据一致的伪影。

Conclusion: 三通道DDPM能够生成真实且解剖学一致的双视图乳腺X线摄影图像，在数据集增强方面具有有前景的应用价值。

Abstract: Purpose: This study aims to develop and evaluate a three channel denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for synthesizing single breast dual view mammograms and to assess the impact of channel representations on image fidelity and cross view consistency. Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar. Generated CC and MLO views maintained cross view consistency, with 6 to 8 percent of synthetic images exhibiting artifacts consistent with those in the training data. Conclusion: Three channel DDPMs can generate realistic and anatomically consistent dual view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation.

TL;DR: 研究评估了可见光(VIS)和热红外(TIR)图像融合在自动检测大蓝鹭及其巢穴中的效果，比较了早期融合和晚期融合方法，发现融合方法相比单一可见光模型能提高检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野生动物监测对生物多样性保护至关重要，可见光和热红外图像的互补使用有望提高自动检测的准确性，但两者在视场和分辨率上的差异给融合带来挑战。

Method: 使用YOLO11n模型对大蓝鹭进行检测，测试了两种VIS-TIR融合方法：早期融合（主成分分析融合图像对）和晚期融合（基于VIS-only和TIR-only模型检测结果的分类回归树处理）。

Result: 所有类别中，早期和晚期融合都比VIS-only模型提高了F1分数。主要类别"被占用巢穴"的F1分数从90.2%提高到93.0%。晚期融合模型还能以90%的召回率识别两个来源的误报。

Conclusion: 虽然融合方法效果更好，但受限于TIR视场和对齐约束会损失数据。使用机载超高分辨率可见光传感器可能是实现可操作调查的更有前景选择。

Abstract: Efficient wildlife monitoring methods are necessary for biodiversity conservation and management. The combination of remote sensing, aerial imagery and deep learning offer promising opportunities to renew or improve existing survey methods. The complementary use of visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery can add information compared to a single-source image and improve results in an automated detection context. However, the alignment and fusion process can be challenging, especially since visible and thermal images usually have different fields of view (FOV) and spatial resolutions. This research presents a case study on the great blue heron (Ardea herodias) to evaluate the performances of synchronous aerial VIS and TIR imagery to automatically detect individuals and nests using a YOLO11n model. Two VIS-TIR fusion methods were tested and compared: an early fusion approach and a late fusion approach, to determine if the addition of the TIR image gives any added value compared to a VIS-only model. VIS and TIR images were automatically aligned using a deep learning model. A principal component analysis fusion method was applied to VIS-TIR image pairs to form the early fusion dataset. A classification and regression tree was used to process the late fusion dataset, based on the detection from the VIS-only and TIR-only trained models. Across all classes, both late and early fusion improved the F1 score compared to the VIS-only model. For the main class, occupied nest, the late fusion improved the F1 score from 90.2 (VIS-only) to 93.0%. This model was also able to identify false positives from both sources with 90% recall. Although fusion methods seem to give better results, this approach comes with a limiting TIR FOV and alignment constraints that eliminate data. Using an aircraft-mounted very high-resolution visible sensor could be an interesting option for operationalizing surveys.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）是不可逆的神经退行性疾病，早期预测对及时干预至关重要。轻度认知障碍（MCI）是正常衰老和AD之间的过渡阶段，但并非所有MCI患者都会转化为AD。准确区分稳定MCI（sMCI）和进展性MCI（pMCI）是AD早期诊断的关键挑战。

Method: 提出混合架构：1）CNN和Vision Transformer结合，从MRI扫描中提取局部空间特征和全局上下文依赖；2）BiLSTM网络处理四个连续时间点的MRI特征和非图像生物标志物；3）端到端模型预测48个月时的认知状态。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上，多模态模型在sMCI和pMCI分类中达到平均95.05%的预测准确率，优于现有AD预测研究，展示了最先进的纵向AD预测性能。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了结合空间和时间建模在阿尔茨海默病早期检测中的有效性，为AD的早期预测提供了强大的深度学习框架，具有重要的临床意义。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that progressively impairs memory, decision-making, and overall cognitive function. As AD is irreversible, early prediction is critical for timely intervention and management. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a transitional stage between cognitively normal (CN) aging and AD, plays a significant role in early AD diagnosis. However, predicting MCI progression remains a significant challenge, as not all individuals with MCI convert to AD. MCI subjects are categorized into stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) based on conversion status. In this study, we propose a generalized, end-to-end deep learning model for AD prediction using MCI cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our hybrid architecture integrates Convolutional Neural Networks and Vision Transformers to capture both local spatial features and global contextual dependencies from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. To incorporate temporal progression, we further employ Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks to process features extracted from four consecutive MRI timepoints along with some other non-image biomarkers, predicting each subject's cognitive status at month 48. Our multimodal model achieved an average progression prediction accuracy of 95.05\% between sMCI and pMCI, outperforming existing studies in AD prediction. This work demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in longitudinal AD prediction and highlights the effectiveness of combining spatial and temporal modeling for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在全球化背景下，单一视觉场景中经常出现多种文化元素混合的情况，但大型视觉语言模型如何感知这些文化混合场景尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在探索LVLMs在文化混合场景中的表现，将其作为模型面临的关键挑战。

Method: 构建CultureMix基准测试，包含23k张扩散生成、人工验证的文化混合食物图像，涵盖四个子任务：纯食物、食物+食物、食物+背景、食物+食物+背景。评估10个LVLMs模型，并探索三种鲁棒性策略，包括使用多样化文化混合数据集进行监督微调。

Result: 评估发现模型在混合场景中难以保持个体文化身份，表现出强烈的背景依赖（添加文化背景后准确率下降14%），且对相同食物在不同语境下产生不一致预测。监督微调能显著提高模型一致性并降低背景敏感性。

Conclusion: 文化混合场景是LVLMs面临的关键挑战，需要更多关注。通过多样化文化混合数据集的监督微调可以有效提升模型在文化混合场景中的鲁棒性，这对于开发能在文化多样性现实环境中可靠运行的LVLMs至关重要。

Abstract: In a globalized world, cultural elements from diverse origins frequently appear together within a single visual scene. We refer to these as culture mixing scenarios, yet how Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) perceive them remains underexplored. We investigate culture mixing as a critical challenge for LVLMs and examine how current models behave when cultural items from multiple regions appear together. To systematically analyze these behaviors, we construct CultureMix, a food Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark with 23k diffusion-generated, human-verified culture mixing images across four subtasks: (1) food-only, (2) food+food, (3) food+background, and (4) food+food+background. Evaluating 10 LVLMs, we find consistent failures to preserve individual cultural identities in mixed settings. Models show strong background reliance, with accuracy dropping 14% when cultural backgrounds are added to food-only baselines, and they produce inconsistent predictions for identical foods across different contexts. To address these limitations, we explore three robustness strategies. We find supervised fine-tuning using a diverse culture mixing dataset substantially improve model consistency and reduce background sensitivity. We call for increased attention to culture mixing scenarios as a critical step toward developing LVLMs capable of operating reliably in culturally diverse real-world environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了当前视觉语言模型在识别艺术作品情感表达方面的能力，发现模型能较好识别图像内容和基本情感，但在抽象或象征性图像上表现不佳，且存在答案不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 情感是艺术表达的基本要素，但情感在艺术作品中的实现具有抽象性和历史变化性，分析需要艺术史专业知识。本研究旨在探索当前视觉语言模型能够检测到情感表达的哪些方面。

Method: 采用案例研究方法，对三个视觉语言模型（Llava-Llama和两个Qwen模型）进行测试。通过四组复杂度递增的问题（一般内容、情感内容、情感表达、情感象征）询问模型关于艺术作品的解读，并进行定性专家评估。

Result: VLMs在识别图像内容方面表现令人惊讶地好，通常也能识别出描绘的情感和表达方式。模型在具体图像上表现最佳，但在高度抽象或高度象征性图像上失败。可靠识别象征仍然存在根本性困难。此外，模型继续表现出已知的LLM弱点：对相关问题提供不一致的答案。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在识别艺术作品情感表达方面具有一定能力，特别是在具体图像上，但在处理抽象象征和保持答案一致性方面仍有明显局限，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Emotions are a fundamental aspect of artistic expression. Due to their abstract nature, there is a broad spectrum of emotion realization in artworks. These are subject to historical change and their analysis requires expertise in art history. In this article, we investigate which aspects of emotional expression can be detected by current (2025) vision language models (VLMs). We present a case study of three VLMs (Llava-Llama and two Qwen models) in which we ask these models four sets of questions of increasing complexity about artworks (general content, emotional content, expression of emotions, and emotion symbols) and carry out a qualitative expert evaluation. We find that the VLMs recognize the content of the images surprisingly well and often also which emotions they depict and how they are expressed. The models perform best for concrete images but fail for highly abstract or highly symbolic images. Reliable recognition of symbols remains fundamentally difficult. Furthermore, the models continue to exhibit the well-known LLM weakness of providing inconsistent answers to related questions.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了衡量人类感知的基准测试、增强对齐度的后训练流程，并证明这种认知对齐能实现更以人为本的AI，解锁模型在创意任务中的应用潜力。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are adept at answering what is in an image-identifying objects and describing scenes-they often lack the ability to understand how an image feels to a human observer. This gap is most evident when considering subjective cognitive properties, such as what makes an image memorable, funny, aesthetically pleasing, or emotionally evocative. To systematically address this challenge, we introduce CogIP-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on such image cognitive properties. Our evaluation reveals a significant gap: current models are poorly aligned with human perception of these nuanced properties. We then demonstrate that a post-training phase can effectively bridge this gap, significantly enhancing the model's alignment with human judgments. Furthermore, we show that this learned cognitive alignment is not merely predictive but also transferable to downstream creative tasks. By integrating our cognitively-aligned MLLM into an image generation pipeline, we can guide the synthesis process to produce images that better embody desired traits, such as being more memorable or visually appealing. Our work provides a benchmark to measure this human-like perception, a post-training pipeline to enhance it, and a demonstration that this alignment unlocks more human-centric AI.

TL;DR: BSTD数据集填补了印度语言场景文本识别的空白，包含11种印度语言和英语的10万+单词，支持多种文本识别任务，所有模型和数据开源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管英语场景文本识别已相当成熟，但印度语言场景文本识别仍面临巨大挑战，主要原因是脚本多样性、非标准字体、书写风格差异，以及缺乏高质量数据集和开源模型。

Method: 构建了Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD) - 一个大规模综合性基准数据集，包含来自6500+场景图像的10万+单词，涵盖11种印度语言和英语，经过精细标注，支持检测、脚本识别、单词识别和端到端识别等多种任务。

Result: 通过将最先进的英语模型适配到印度语言进行评估，结果突显了印度语言场景文本识别的挑战和机遇，表明该领域仍有很大研究空间。

Conclusion: BSTD数据集是推动印度语言场景文本识别研究的重要一步，所有模型和数据开源，为后续研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Reading scene text, that is, text appearing in images, has numerous application areas, including assistive technology, search, and e-commerce. Although scene text recognition in English has advanced significantly and is often considered nearly a solved problem, Indian language scene text recognition remains an open challenge. This is due to script diversity, non-standard fonts, and varying writing styles, and, more importantly, the lack of high-quality datasets and open-source models. To address these gaps, we introduce the Bharat Scene Text Dataset (BSTD) - a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark for studying Indian Language Scene Text Recognition. It comprises more than 100K words that span 11 Indian languages and English, sourced from over 6,500 scene images captured across various linguistic regions of India. The dataset is meticulously annotated and supports multiple scene text tasks, including: (i) Scene Text Detection, (ii) Script Identification, (iii) Cropped Word Recognition, and (iv) End-to-End Scene Text Recognition. We evaluated state-of-the-art models originally developed for English by adapting (fine-tuning) them for Indian languages. Our results highlight the challenges and opportunities in Indian language scene text recognition. We believe that this dataset represents a significant step toward advancing research in this domain. All our models and data are open source.

TL;DR: 提出LC4-DViT框架，结合生成式数据创建与可变形视觉Transformer，用于高分辨率土地覆盖分类，解决标注稀缺和几何失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土地覆盖图对生态系统服务、水文调节等至关重要，但遥感分类面临标注稀缺、类别不平衡和高分辨率场景几何失真等挑战。

Method: 1) 使用GPT-4o生成场景描述和超分辨率样本，通过文本引导扩散管道合成类别平衡的高保真训练图像；2) 结合DCNv4可变形卷积骨干网络和Vision Transformer编码器，捕捉细粒度几何特征和全局上下文。

Result: 在AID数据集8个类别上达到0.9572总体准确率，优于ViT基线和其他模型；在SIRI-WHU子集上达到0.9333准确率，显示良好迁移性；GPT-4o评估显示DViT注意力与水文结构对齐最佳。

Conclusion: 描述驱动的生成增强与可变形Transformer结合是解决高分辨率土地覆盖制图挑战的有效方法。

Abstract: Land-cover underpins ecosystem services, hydrologic regulation, disaster-risk reduction, and evidence-based land planning; timely, accurate land-cover maps are therefore critical for environmental stewardship. Remote sensing-based land-cover classification offers a scalable route to such maps but is hindered by scarce and imbalanced annotations and by geometric distortions in high-resolution scenes. We propose LC4-DViT (Land-cover Creation for Land-cover Classification with Deformable Vision Transformer), a framework that combines generative data creation with a deformation-aware Vision Transformer. A text-guided diffusion pipeline uses GPT-4o-generated scene descriptions and super-resolved exemplars to synthesize class-balanced, high-fidelity training images, while DViT couples a DCNv4 deformable convolutional backbone with a Vision Transformer encoder to jointly capture fine-scale geometry and global context. On eight classes from the Aerial Image Dataset (AID)-Beach, Bridge, Desert, Forest, Mountain, Pond, Port, and River-DViT achieves 0.9572 overall accuracy, 0.9576 macro F1-score, and 0.9510 Cohen' s Kappa, improving over a vanilla ViT baseline (0.9274 OA, 0.9300 macro F1, 0.9169 Kappa) and outperforming ResNet50, MobileNetV2, and FlashInternImage. Cross-dataset experiments on a three-class SIRI-WHU subset (Harbor, Pond, River) yield 0.9333 overall accuracy, 0.9316 macro F1, and 0.8989 Kappa, indicating good transferability. An LLM-based judge using GPT-4o to score Grad-CAM heatmaps further shows that DViT' s attention aligns best with hydrologically meaningful structures. These results suggest that description-driven generative augmentation combined with deformation-aware transformers is a promising approach for high-resolution land-cover mapping.

TL;DR: Captain Safari提出了一种基于姿态条件世界记忆的世界引擎，通过检索持久世界记忆生成3D一致的长视频，在复杂户外场景和激进6-DoF轨迹下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界引擎在激进6-DoF相机轨迹和复杂户外布局下存在长距离几何一致性丢失、偏离目标路径或运动过于保守的问题，需要更好的解决方案。

Method: 提出姿态条件世界引擎Captain Safari，通过维护动态本地记忆，使用检索器获取姿态对齐的世界标记来条件化视频生成，保持稳定3D结构并准确执行复杂相机操作。

Result: 在视频质量、3D一致性和轨迹跟踪方面显著优于现有相机控制生成器：MEt3R从0.3703降至0.3690，AUC@30从0.181提升至0.200，FVD显著更低。在50人5向人类研究中获得67.6%的偏好。

Conclusion: 姿态条件世界记忆是实现长时域可控视频生成的有效机制，提出的OpenSafari数据集为未来世界引擎研究提供了具有挑战性的新基准。

Abstract: World engines aim to synthesize long, 3D-consistent videos that support interactive exploration of a scene under user-controlled camera motion. However, existing systems struggle under aggressive 6-DoF trajectories and complex outdoor layouts: they lose long-range geometric coherence, deviate from the target path, or collapse into overly conservative motion. To this end, we introduce Captain Safari, a pose-conditioned world engine that generates videos by retrieving from a persistent world memory. Given a camera path, our method maintains a dynamic local memory and uses a retriever to fetch pose-aligned world tokens, which then condition video generation along the trajectory. This design enables the model to maintain stable 3D structure while accurately executing challenging camera maneuvers. To evaluate this setting, we curate OpenSafari, a new in-the-wild FPV dataset containing high-dynamic drone videos with verified camera trajectories, constructed through a multi-stage geometric and kinematic validation pipeline. Across video quality, 3D consistency, and trajectory following, Captain Safari substantially outperforms state-of-the-art camera-controlled generators. It reduces MEt3R from 0.3703 to 0.3690, improves AUC@30 from 0.181 to 0.200, and yields substantially lower FVD than all camera-controlled baselines. More importantly, in a 50-participant, 5-way human study where annotators select the best result among five anonymized models, 67.6% of preferences favor our method across all axes. Our results demonstrate that pose-conditioned world memory is a powerful mechanism for long-horizon, controllable video generation and provide OpenSafari as a challenging new benchmark for future world-engine research.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了多模态大语言模型在矛盾模态下的鲁棒性问题，发现现有模型在多模态对齐和误导信息方面存在脆弱性，并提出了一种模态对齐调优策略来提升模型的多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型取得了显著进展，但一个基本问题仍然存在：MLLMs是否对矛盾的模态具有鲁棒性？作者旨在系统研究模型对特定模态的依赖程度，并分析其脆弱性。

Method: 1. 引入MMA-Bench基准，包含视频和任务来探测模型对特定模态的依赖；2. 使用黑盒和白盒可解释性技术分析开源和闭源MLLMs的脆弱性；3. 提出模态对齐调优策略，教导模型何时优先考虑、利用或忽略特定模态线索。

Result: 研究发现当前MLLMs在音频-视觉对不匹配和简单误导文本的情况下表现不佳，缺乏鲁棒的多模态推理能力。提出的对齐调优方法能够显著增强多模态基础能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了可解释性工具和明确的路径，用于开发具有内在可靠跨模态推理能力的MLLMs。代码和数据集将公开可用。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a fundamental question remains: are MLLMs robust to contradicting modalities? To rigorously study this, we introduce MMA-Bench comprising videos and tasks that probe a model's reliance on specific modalities. Using black-box and white-box interpretability techniques, we provide a critical analysis of the brittleness of both open- and closed-sourced MLLMs. We show that current MLLMs struggle under misaligned audio-visual pairs and simple misleading text, thereby lacking robust multi-modal reasoning. Building on these findings, we propose a modality alignment tuning strategy to teach the model when to prioritize, leverage, or ignore specific modality cues. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that our alignment tuning yields demonstrably stronger multimodal grounding. This work provides both interpretability tools and a clear path toward developing MLLMs with intrinsically reliable cross-modal reasoning. Code and dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 研究探讨大规模视觉语言模型在驾驶安全监控中的应用，通过构建数据集评估模型处理同步驾驶员视角和道路视角视频的能力，发现微调后模型能生成准确的安全驾驶指令，但仍存在检测复杂事件的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLMs在视觉任务中表现出色，有望应用于自动驾驶等工业领域。但为确保全面安全，需要同时监控驾驶员视角和道路视角，检测如驾驶中使用手机等风险事件，因此需要模型具备处理同步多视角输入的能力。

Method: 构建专门的数据集，评估预训练和微调后LVLMs在同步处理驾驶员视角和道路视角视频方面的性能，并进行错误分析。

Result: 预训练LVLMs效果有限，但经过微调的LVLMs能够生成准确且安全导向的驾驶指令。然而在检测视频中细微或复杂事件方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: 研究为LVLM在驾驶安全监控领域的应用提供了有价值的见解，指出了当前模型的局限性和未来改进方向，特别是在处理复杂事件检测方面需要进一步优化。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit advanced capabilities in tasks that require visual information, including object detection. These capabilities have promising applications in various industrial domains, such as autonomous driving. For example, LVLMs can generate safety-oriented descriptions of videos captured by road-facing cameras. However, ensuring comprehensive safety requires monitoring driver-facing views as well to detect risky events, such as the use of mobiles while driving. Thus, the ability to process synchronized inputs is necessary from both driver-facing and road-facing cameras. In this study, we develop models and investigate the capabilities of LVLMs by constructing a dataset and evaluating their performance on this dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that while pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions. Nonetheless, several challenges remain, particularly in detecting subtle or complex events in the video. Our findings and error analysis provide valuable insights that can contribute to the improvement of LVLM-based systems in this domain.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了RETINA基准测试，解决现有MKB-VQA数据集中存在的"视觉捷径"问题，并提出了MIMIR模型来有效处理这一挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MKB-VQA基准存在"视觉捷径"问题，即查询图像通常与目标文档的主要实体匹配，模型可以利用这种捷径仅通过视觉线索就获得良好表现，这不能真正测试多模态知识推理能力。

Method: 1) 提出RETINA基准：使用LLM驱动的流水线自动构建，包含12万训练样本和2千人工标注测试集，查询引用次要实体（相关实体），并配对相关实体的图像，消除视觉捷径；2) 提出MIMIR模型：通过增强多个相关实体的图像来丰富文档嵌入，而先前工作每个文档只使用单个图像。

Result: 在RETINA基准上评估现有模型时，性能显著下降，证实了它们对视觉捷径的依赖。MIMIR模型能有效处理RETINA基准，优于仅使用单张图像的先前方法。

Conclusion: RETINA基准揭示了现有MKB-VQA数据集的局限性，MIMIR模型通过多图像增强策略有效解决了视觉捷径问题，为多模态知识推理提供了更可靠的评估框架。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (MKB-VQA) benchmarks suffer from "visual shortcuts", as the query image typically matches the primary subject entity of the target document. We demonstrate that models can exploit these shortcuts, achieving comparable results using visual cues alone. To address this, we introduce Relational Entity Text-Image kNowledge Augmented (RETINA) benchmark, automatically constructed using an LLM-driven pipeline, consisting of 120k training and 2k human-curated test set. RETINA contains queries referencing secondary subjects (i.e. related entities) and pairs them with images of these related entities, removing the visual shortcut. When evaluated on RETINA existing models show significantly degraded performance, confirming their reliance on the shortcut. Furthermore, we propose Multi-Image MultImodal Retriever (MIMIR), which enriches document embeddings by augmenting images of multiple related entities, effectively handling RETINA, unlike prior work that uses only a single image per document. Our experiments validate the limitations of existing benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of RETINA and MIMIR. Our project is available at: Project Page.

TL;DR: SLEUTH是一个多智能体框架，通过分层精炼方法解决VLMs处理长文档时性能下降的问题，在多个长文档基准测试中取得SOTA结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在单页文档任务中表现良好，但在处理长文档时效果下降。长文档中线索分散在多页和多模态中，冗长的输入冗余会影响模型判断。虽然检索增强生成通过筛选相关内容缓解了问题，但检索结果仍包含大量冗余。

Method: 提出SLEUTH多智能体框架，协调检索器和四个协作智能体进行粗到细的处理：识别检索页面中的关键文本和视觉线索，筛选表格和图表等显著视觉证据，分析查询以制定推理策略，最终合成蒸馏后的证据密集多模态上下文来生成最终预测。

Result: SLEUTH与先进的VLM骨干网络结合时，在多个长文档基准测试中持续提升性能，取得了最先进的结果。消融研究验证了每个模块的有效性，并确认了分层精炼范式的优势。

Conclusion: SLEUTH是一个模型无关且可扩展的框架，通过多智能体协作和分层精炼有效解决了长文档理解中的冗余和线索分散问题，显著提升了VLMs在长文档任务上的性能。

Abstract: Document understanding is a long standing practical task. Vision Language Models (VLMs) have gradually become a primary approach in this domain, demonstrating effective performance on single page tasks. However, their effectiveness diminishes when handling long documents. In such scenarios, clues are often scattered across multiple pages and modalities, and redundancy from lengthy inputs can impair the models judgment. While retrieval augmented generation mitigates this issue by filtering for question relevant content, the retrieved results still contain substantial redundancy. To address these limitations, we propose SLEUTH, a multi agent framework. Concretely, SLEUTH orchestrates a retriever and four collaborative agents in a coarse to fine process. The framework identifies key textual and visual clues within the retrieved pages, filters for salient visual evidence such as tables and charts, and analyzes the query to devise a reasoning strategy. It ultimately synthesizes a distilled, evidence dense multimodal context to generate the final prediction. SLEUTH is model agnostic and scalable. When paired with advanced VLM backbones, it consistently improves performance on multiple long document benchmarks, achieving state of the art results. Ablation studies verify each modules effectiveness and confirm the benefits of our hierarchical refinement paradigm.

TL;DR: GLOW是一个全局光照感知的逆向渲染框架，专门解决室内场景中光照与反射率歧义问题，特别针对共置光源-相机设置中的复杂光照效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 室内场景逆向渲染面临反射率与光照歧义问题，共置光源-相机设置虽然能通过SfM校准光照，但引入了强相互反射、动态阴影、近场光照和移动高光等新挑战，现有方法无法有效处理。

Method: GLOW结合神经隐式表面表示和神经辐射缓存来近似全局光照，通过精心设计的正则化和初始化联合优化几何与反射率。引入动态辐射缓存适应近场运动的光照不连续性，以及表面角度加权的辐射度损失抑制闪光灯捕获中的高光伪影。

Result: 实验表明，GLOW在自然光照和共置光照条件下，在材质反射率估计方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GLOW通过全局光照感知的逆向渲染框架，有效解决了共置光源-相机设置中的复杂光照挑战，在室内场景材质估计方面取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Inverse rendering of indoor scenes remains challenging due to the ambiguity between reflectance and lighting, exacerbated by inter-reflections among multiple objects. While natural illumination-based methods struggle to resolve this ambiguity, co-located light-camera setups offer better disentanglement as lighting can be easily calibrated via Structure-from-Motion. However, such setups introduce additional complexities like strong inter-reflections, dynamic shadows, near-field lighting, and moving specular highlights, which existing approaches fail to handle. We present GLOW, a Global Illumination-aware Inverse Rendering framework designed to address these challenges. GLOW integrates a neural implicit surface representation with a neural radiance cache to approximate global illumination, jointly optimizing geometry and reflectance through carefully designed regularization and initialization. We then introduce a dynamic radiance cache that adapts to sharp lighting discontinuities from near-field motion, and a surface-angle-weighted radiometric loss to suppress specular artifacts common in flashlight captures. Experiments show that GLOW substantially outperforms prior methods in material reflectance estimation under both natural and co-located illumination.

Motivation: 现有语音手势生成方法存在两个关键挑战：1）手势数据集缺乏描述性文本标注导致的语义先验鸿沟；2）难以实现对手势生成的协调多模态控制。这限制了说话者动作的多样性，无法生成文本驱动的非自发手势（如说话时鞠躬）

Method: 1）提出新颖的手势描述框架，利用运动-语言模型生成多粒度描述性标注；2）基于此构建条件潜在扩散模型，采用统一跨数据集运动表示和分层控制去噪器，实现高度可控的协调手势生成

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成高质量手势，既与语音节奏同步，又与任意描述语义一致，相比现有方法在性能上更优且效率更高

Conclusion: CoordSpeaker首次探索手势理解与描述来解决手势生成中的语义鸿沟问题，同时提供了手势-文本双向映射的新视角，实现了协调的文本赋能语音手势合成

Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation has significantly advanced human-computer interaction, yet speaker movements remain constrained due to the omission of text-driven non-spontaneous gestures (e.g., bowing while talking). Existing methods face two key challenges: 1) the semantic prior gap due to the lack of descriptive text annotations in gesture datasets, and 2) the difficulty in achieving coordinated multimodal control over gesture generation. To address these challenges, this paper introduces CoordSpeaker, a comprehensive framework that enables coordinated caption-empowered co-speech gesture synthesis. Our approach first bridges the semantic prior gap through a novel gesture captioning framework, leveraging a motion-language model to generate descriptive captions at multiple granularities. Building upon this, we propose a conditional latent diffusion model with unified cross-dataset motion representation and a hierarchically controlled denoiser to achieve highly controlled, coordinated gesture generation. CoordSpeaker pioneers the first exploration of gesture understanding and captioning to tackle the semantic gap in gesture generation while offering a novel perspective of bidirectional gesture-text mapping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method produces high-quality gestures that are both rhythmically synchronized with speeches and semantically coherent with arbitrary captions, achieving superior performance with higher efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: 通过潜在扩散与可扩展骨干网络及强条件控制的结合，为条件4D fMRI合成建立了实用路径，为虚拟实验、跨站点协调和下游神经影像模型增强等应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Generating whole-brain 4D fMRI sequences conditioned on cognitive tasks remains challenging due to the high-dimensional, heterogeneous BOLD dynamics across subjects/acquisitions and the lack of neuroscience-grounded validation. We introduce the first diffusion transformer for voxelwise 4D fMRI conditional generation, combining 3D VQ-GAN latent compression with a CNN-Transformer backbone and strong task conditioning via AdaLN-Zero and cross-attention. On HCP task fMRI, our model reproduces task-evoked activation maps, preserves the inter-task representational structure observed in real data (RSA), achieves perfect condition specificity, and aligns ROI time-courses with canonical hemodynamic responses. Performance improves predictably with scale, reaching task-evoked map correlation of 0.83 and RSA of 0.98, consistently surpassing a U-Net baseline on all metrics. By coupling latent diffusion with a scalable backbone and strong conditioning, this work establishes a practical path to conditional 4D fMRI synthesis, paving the way for future applications such as virtual experiments, cross-site harmonization, and principled augmentation for downstream neuroimaging models.

Motivation: 在低收入和中等收入国家的拥堵城市交叉口，行人安全是紧迫问题。年龄和性别等人口因素显著影响行人脆弱性，但现有实时监控系统很少捕获这些信息，导致传统交通数据缺乏人口统计洞察。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络（CNN）从远距离路口监控视频中分类行人年龄组和性别。将分类构建为统一的六类问题（成年男性/女性、青少年男性/女性、儿童男性/女性）。收集孟加拉国达卡三个高风险交叉口的视频数据。实现两种CNN架构：基于ImageNet预训练的ResNet50和自定义轻量级CNN。探索了八种模型变体，结合不同池化策略和优化器。

Result: ResNet50配合最大池化和SGD优化器达到最高准确率86.19%，自定义CNN表现相当（84.15%），但参数更少、训练更快。模型高效设计支持在标准监控视频上进行实时推理。

Conclusion: 该框架为从业者提供可扩展、经济高效的工具，可利用现有摄像头基础设施监控交叉口行人人口统计。输出可影响交叉口设计、优化信号时序，并为儿童或老年人等脆弱群体提供针对性安全干预。通过补充传统交通数据中常缺失的人口统计洞察，支持混合交通环境中更包容、数据驱动的规划。

Abstract: Pedestrian safety remains a pressing concern in congested urban intersections, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where traffic is multimodal, and infrastructure often lacks formal control. Demographic factors like age and gender significantly influence pedestrian vulnerability, yet real-time monitoring systems rarely capture this information. To address this gap, this study proposes a deep learning framework that classifies pedestrian age group and gender from far-view intersection footage using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), without relying on facial recognition or high-resolution imagery. The classification is structured as a unified six-class problem, distinguishing adult, teenager, and child pedestrians for both males and females, based on full-body visual cues. Video data was collected from three high-risk intersections in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Two CNN architectures were implemented: ResNet50, a deep convolutional neural network pretrained on ImageNet, and a custom lightweight CNN optimized for computational efficiency. Eight model variants explored combinations of pooling strategies and optimizers. ResNet50 with Max Pooling and SGD achieved the highest accuracy (86.19%), while the custom CNN performed comparably (84.15%) with fewer parameters and faster training. The model's efficient design enables real-time inference on standard surveillance feeds. For practitioners, this system provides a scalable, cost-effective tool to monitor pedestrian demographics at intersections using existing camera infrastructure. Its outputs can shape intersection design, optimize signal timing, and enable targeted safety interventions for vulnerable groups such as children or the elderly. By offering demographic insights often missing in conventional traffic data, the framework supports more inclusive, data-driven planning in mixed-traffic environments.

TL;DR: ClearGCD通过语义视图对齐和捷径抑制正则化解决广义类别发现中的原型混淆问题，提升已知和未知类别的识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界场景中，广义类别发现需要同时识别未标记数据中的已知和未知类别。现有方法常因捷径学习导致原型混淆，这会削弱泛化能力并导致已知类别的遗忘。

Method: 提出ClearGCD框架，包含两个互补机制：1) 语义视图对齐(SVA)：通过跨类别补丁替换生成强增强，并使用弱增强强制语义一致性；2) 捷径抑制正则化(SSR)：维护自适应原型库，对齐已知类别同时鼓励潜在未知类别的分离。

Result: ClearGCD可无缝集成到参数化GCD方法中，在多个基准测试中持续优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: ClearGCD通过减少对非语义线索的依赖，有效缓解了广义类别发现中的原型混淆问题，提高了已知和未知类别的识别性能。

Abstract: In open-world scenarios, Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) requires identifying both known and novel categories within unlabeled data. However, existing methods often suffer from prototype confusion caused by shortcut learning, which undermines generalization and leads to forgetting of known classes. We propose ClearGCD, a framework designed to mitigate reliance on non-semantic cues through two complementary mechanisms. First, Semantic View Alignment (SVA) generates strong augmentations via cross-class patch replacement and enforces semantic consistency using weak augmentations. Second, Shortcut Suppression Regularization (SSR) maintains an adaptive prototype bank that aligns known classes while encouraging separation of potential novel ones. ClearGCD can be seamlessly integrated into parametric GCD approaches and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in autonomous driving and robotics. Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: P2C框架将多模态提示学习从静态点表示重构为动态去噪任务，通过学习语义云分布而非单点表示，显著提升模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MPL方法局限于优化单一静态点表示，这种范式存在固有脆弱性，容易在基类上过拟合，对新类别或模糊类别泛化能力差。需要更鲁棒的语义表示方法。

Method: 提出Points-to-Clouds框架，受扩散模型启发，将提示学习重构为动态去噪任务。核心是双重去噪机制：动态提示去噪通过退火噪声扰动文本提示学习平滑语义景观；辅助V-L映射器去噪损失将映射器重构为去噪自编码器，确保鲁棒的跨模态对齐。

Result: 在11个数据集上的实验表明P2C持续优于强基线。在基类到新类泛化基准上，谐波均值达到79.7%，相对基线提升1.4%。

Conclusion: P2C通过将提示学习从点表示范式转变为语义云分布学习，显著提升了视觉语言模型的泛化能力，为解决MPL中的过拟合和泛化问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Prompt Learning (MPL) has emerged as a pivotal technique for adapting large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs). However, current MPL methods are fundamentally limited by their optimization of a single, static point representation. This paradigm is inherently brittle, leads to overfitting on base classes, and generalizes poorly to novel or ambiguous categories. We challenge this point paradigm, proposing that robust generalization requires learning a semantic cloud (i.e., a distribution over the embedding space). To achieve this, we introduce Points-to-Clouds (P2C), a novel framework inspired by diffusion models that reframes prompt learning as a dynamic denoising task. At the core of P2C is a dual denoising mechanism: a Dynamic Prompt Denoising (DPD) mechanism perturbs text prompts with sophisticated, annealed noise to learn a smoother semantic landscape, while an auxiliary V-L Mapper denoising loss re-tasks the mapper as a denoising autoencoder. This forces the mapper to reconstruct clean visual prompts from noisy text inputs, ensuring robust cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across 11 datasets demonstrate that P2C consistently outperforms strong baselines. On the base-to-novel generalization benchmark, our method achieves a Harmonic Mean of 79.7%, representing a relative improvement of 1.4% over the baseline. The code and models are available at https://vranlee.github.io/P2C/.

TL;DR: CORTEX是一个结合视觉和文本线索的变化描述框架，通过视觉语言模型提取场景级文本知识来增强对图像变化的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有变化描述方法仅依赖视觉特征，难以捕捉细微但有意义的变化，因为它们缺乏对结构化信息（如对象关系和组合语义）的显式表示能力。

Method: CORTEX包含三个核心模块：1）图像级变化检测器识别低级视觉差异；2）推理感知文本提取模块使用VLMs生成组合推理描述；3）图像-文本双重对齐模块对齐视觉和文本特征进行细粒度关系推理。

Result: 该框架能够推理视觉和文本特征，捕捉仅凭视觉特征难以识别的模糊变化。

Conclusion: 通过整合互补的文本线索，CORTEX增强了变化理解能力，解决了现有方法在捕捉细微但有意义变化方面的局限性。

Abstract: Change captioning aims to describe changes between a pair of images. However, existing works rely on visual features alone, which often fail to capture subtle but meaningful changes because they lack the ability to represent explicitly structured information such as object relationships and compositional semantics. To alleviate this, we present CORTEX (COmpositional Reasoning-aware TEXt-guided), a novel framework that integrates complementary textual cues to enhance change understanding. In addition to capturing cues from pixel-level differences, CORTEX utilizes scene-level textual knowledge provided by Vision Language Models (VLMs) to extract richer image text signals that reveal underlying compositional reasoning. CORTEX consists of three key modules: (i) an Image-level Change Detector that identifies low-level visual differences between paired images, (ii) a Reasoning-aware Text Extraction (RTE) module that use VLMs to generate compositional reasoning descriptions implicit in visual features, and (iii) an Image-Text Dual Alignment (ITDA) module that aligns visual and textual features for fine-grained relational reasoning. This enables CORTEX to reason over visual and textual features and capture changes that are otherwise ambiguous in visual features alone.

Conclusion: 通过识别和优先处理查询中的重要词汇进行细粒度片段过滤的方法，有效提升了视频理解任务的性能

Abstract: Video moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD) with natural language queries aim to localize relevant moments and key highlights in a video clips. However, existing methods overlook the importance of individual words, treating the entire text query and video clips as a black-box, which hinders contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables fine-grained clip filtering by identifying and prioritizing important words in the query. Our method integrates image-text scene understanding through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enhances the semantic understanding of video clips. We introduce a feature enhancement module (FEM) to capture important words from the query and a ranking-based filtering module (RFM) to iteratively refine video clips based on their relevance to these important words. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both MR and HD tasks.

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D vision. Most existing methods only use geometric information for registration. Recently proposed RGB-D registration methods primarily focus on feature fusion or improving feature learning, which limits their ability to exploit image information and hinders their practical applicability. In this paper, we propose ViGG, a robust RGB-D registration method using mutual guidance. First, we solve clique alignment in a visual-geometric combination form, employing a geometric guidance design to suppress ambiguous cliques. Second, to mitigate accuracy degradation caused by noise in visual matches, we propose a visual-guided geometric matching method that utilizes visual priors to determine the search space, enabling the extraction of high-quality, noise-insensitive correspondences. This mutual guidance strategy brings our method superior robustness, making it applicable for various RGB-D registration tasks. The experiments on 3DMatch, ScanNet and KITTI datasets show that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in both learning-free and learning-based settings.

TL;DR: NeuMatC：一种利用参数维度低秩性和连续性的神经网络矩阵计算框架，可高效处理参数化矩阵运算，相比传统方法显著减少冗余计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统矩阵运算方法（如求逆、SVD）在处理参数连续变化的矩阵时，每次运算都独立进行，忽略了参数维度的低秩性和连续性，导致大量冗余计算。新兴应用（如无线通信、信号处理）需要反复对参数化矩阵进行运算，亟需更高效的方法。

Method: 提出神经矩阵计算框架（NeuMatC），通过无监督学习从参数到矩阵运算结果的低秩连续映射。训练完成后，只需少量基本操作（矩阵乘法、非线性激活）即可在任意参数点高效计算，充分利用参数维度的低秩性和连续性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，NeuMatC在无线通信应用中，相比广泛使用的NumPy基准，参数化矩阵求逆速度提升3倍以上，参数化SVD速度提升10倍以上，同时保持可接受的精度。

Conclusion: NeuMatC通过利用参数维度的低秩性和连续性，为参数化矩阵运算提供了一种高效解决方案，显著减少冗余计算，在保持精度的同时大幅提升计算效率，适用于无线通信、信号处理等需要反复进行参数化矩阵运算的领域。

Abstract: Matrix operations (e.g., inversion and singular value decomposition (SVD)) are fundamental in science and engineering. In many emerging real-world applications (such as wireless communication and signal processing), these operations must be performed repeatedly over matrices with parameters varying continuously. However, conventional methods tackle each matrix operation independently, underexploring the inherent low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension, resulting in significantly redundant computation. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{\textit{Neural Matrix Computation Framework} (NeuMatC)}, which elegantly tackles general parametric matrix operation tasks by leveraging the underlying low-rankness and continuity along the parameter dimension. Specifically, NeuMatC unsupervisedly learns a low-rank and continuous mapping from parameters to their corresponding matrix operation results. Once trained, NeuMatC enables efficient computations at arbitrary parameters using only a few basic operations (e.g., matrix multiplications and nonlinear activations), significantly reducing redundant computations. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the promising performance of NeuMatC, exemplified by over $3\times$ speedup in parametric inversion and $10\times$ speedup in parametric SVD compared to the widely used NumPy baseline in wireless communication, while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

Result: 在多种篡改场景下实现最先进性能，持续产生高质量恢复图像

Conclusion: ReImage通过神经水印和打乱水印技术有效解决图像自恢复问题，代码和预训练模型将在发表后公开

Abstract: The rapid growth of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) raises concerns about the authenticity of digital media. In this context, image self-recovery, reconstructing original content from its manipulated version, offers a practical solution for understanding the attacker's intent and restoring trustworthy data. However, existing methods often fail to accurately recover tampered regions, falling short of the primary goal of self-recovery. To address this challenge, we propose ReImage, a neural watermarking-based self-recovery framework that embeds a shuffled version of the target image into itself as a watermark. We design a generator that produces watermarks optimized for neural watermarking and introduce an image enhancement module to refine the recovered image. We further analyze and resolve key limitations of shuffled watermarking, enabling its effective use in self-recovery. We demonstrate that ReImage achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tampering scenarios, consistently producing high-quality recovered images. The code and pretrained models will be released upon publication.

Abstract: Burst denoising methods are crucial for enhancing images captured on handheld devices, but they often struggle with large motion or suffer from prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we propose DenoiseGS, the first framework to leverage the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting for burst denoising. Our approach addresses two key challenges when applying feedforward Gaussian reconsturction model to noisy inputs: the degradation of Gaussian point clouds and the loss of fine details. To this end, we propose a Gaussian self-consistency (GSC) loss, which regularizes the geometry predicted from noisy inputs with high-quality Gaussian point clouds. These point clouds are generated from clean inputs by the same model that we are training, thereby alleviating potential bias or domain gaps. Additionally, we introduce a log-weighted frequency (LWF) loss to strengthen supervision within the spectral domain, effectively preserving fine-grained details. The LWF loss adaptively weights frequency discrepancies in a logarithmic manner, emphasizing challenging high-frequency details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DenoiseGS significantly exceeds the state-of-the-art NeRF-based methods on both burst denoising and novel view synthesis under noisy conditions, while achieving \textbf{250$\times$} faster inference speed.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have greatly improved pose-driven character animation. However, existing methods are limited to spatially aligned reference-pose pairs with matched skeletal structures. Handling reference-pose misalignment remains unsolved. To address this, we present One-to-All Animation, a unified framework for high-fidelity character animation and image pose transfer for references with arbitrary layouts. First, to handle spatially misaligned reference, we reformulate training as a self-supervised outpainting task that transforms diverse-layout reference into a unified occluded-input format. Second, to process partially visible reference, we design a reference extractor for comprehensive identity feature extraction. Further, we integrate hybrid reference fusion attention to handle varying resolutions and dynamic sequence lengths. Finally, from the perspective of generation quality, we introduce identity-robust pose control that decouples appearance from skeletal structure to mitigate pose overfitting, and a token replace strategy for coherent long-video generation. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches. The code and model will be available at https://github.com/ssj9596/One-to-All-Animation.

Abstract: Domain generalization in semantic segmentation faces challenges from domain shifts, particularly under adverse conditions. While diffusion-based data generation methods show promise, they introduce inherent misalignment between generated images and semantic masks. This paper presents FLEX-Seg (FLexible Edge eXploitation for Segmentation), a framework that transforms this limitation into an opportunity for robust learning. FLEX-Seg comprises three key components: (1) Granular Adaptive Prototypes that captures boundary characteristics across multiple scales, (2) Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis that dynamically adjusts learning emphasis based on prediction entropy, and (3) Hardness-Aware Sampling that progressively focuses on challenging examples. By leveraging inherent misalignment rather than enforcing strict alignment, FLEX-Seg learns robust representations while capturing rich stylistic variations. Experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich. Our findings validate that adaptive strategies for handling imperfect synthetic data lead to superior domain generalization. Code is available at https://github.com/VisualScienceLab-KHU/FLEX-Seg.

Conclusion: RobotSeg通过解决机器人分割的关键挑战，提供了一个结构感知、自动化和标签高效的解决方案，为机器人感知领域的进步奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: Accurate robot segmentation is a fundamental capability for robotic perception. It enables precise visual servoing for VLA systems, scalable robot-centric data augmentation, accurate real-to-sim transfer, and reliable safety monitoring in dynamic human-robot environments. Despite the strong capabilities of modern segmentation models, surprisingly it remains challenging to segment robots. This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy. These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution. We further construct the video robot segmentation (VRS) dataset comprising over 2.8k videos (138k frames) with diverse robot embodiments and environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both images and videos, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习太阳图像分析方法存在两个主要问题：1）大多从头训练任务特定编码器，忽略了SDO数据的独特特性；2）依赖自然图像预训练，无法适应太阳观测的特殊性。需要专门针对SDO多仪器观测设计的预训练骨干网络。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized solar image analysis, yet most approaches train task-specific encoders from scratch or rely on natural-image pretraining that ignores the unique characteristics of Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data. We introduce SolarCHIP, a family of contrastively pretrained visual backbones tailored to multi-instrument SDO observations. SolarCHIP addresses three key challenges in solar imaging: multimodal sensing across AIA and HMI instruments, weak inter-class separability due to slow temporal evolution, and strong intra-class variability with sparse activity signals. Our pretraining framework employs a multi-granularity contrastive objective that jointly aligns (1) global class tokens across co-temporal AIA-HMI pairs to enhance temporal discrimination, (2) local patch tokens at fixed spatial indices to enforce position-consistent, modality-invariant features, and (3) intra-sample patches across different spatial locations to preserve fine-grained spatial structure. We train both CNN- and Vision Transformer-based autoencoders and demonstrate their effectiveness on two downstream tasks: cross-modal translation between HMI and AIA passbands via ControlNet, and full-disk flare classification. Experimental results show that SolarCHIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks, with particularly strong gains in low-resource settings where labeled data is limited. Ablation studies confirm that each contrastive component contributes essential discriminative capacity at different granularities. By publicly releasing pretrained weights and training code, we provide the heliophysics community with a practical, plug-and-play feature extractor that reduces computational requirements, improves label efficiency, and establishes a reusable foundation for diverse solar imaging applications.

Method: 提出分层多模态表示方法：1）使用多视角图像（俯视图和四个方向视图）和包含检测物体3D坐标的文本描述在输入空间显式对齐；2）引入分层特征表示，将图像块级特征聚合为视图级和场景级表示，支持局部和全局场景推理。

Result: 在situated 3D Q&A和general 3D Q&A基准测试中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过显式输入空间对齐和分层特征表示，显著提升了3D场景推理性能，解决了现有隐式对齐方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant promise for 3D scene understanding. Existing VLM-based approaches typically align 3D scene features with the VLM's embedding space. However, this implicit alignment often yields suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of 3D data and the inherent complexity of spatial relationships in 3D environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs at the input space by leveraging both multi-view images and text descriptions. The text descriptions capture spatial relationships by referencing the 3D coordinates of detected objects, while the multi-view images include a top-down perspective and four directional views (forward, left, right, and backward), ensuring comprehensive scene coverage. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical feature representation that aggregates patch-level image features into view-level and scene-level representations, enabling the model to reason over both local and global scene context. Experimental results on both situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 提出一个新颖的语义SLAM框架，通过主动的固有外观归一化和动态辐射平衡损失，实现光照不变性，提升极端曝光条件下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 极端曝光会同时降低3D地图重建和语义分割的准确性，这对紧耦合系统特别有害。需要实现光照不变性来提升系统鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 固有外观归一化模块：主动解耦场景的固有属性（如反照率）和瞬时光照，学习标准化的光照不变外观模型，为每个高斯基元分配稳定一致的颜色表示。
2. 动态辐射平衡损失：仅在图像曝光不佳时激活，直接在辐射场操作以指导针对性优化，防止极端光照下的误差累积。

Result: 在公开数据集上的评估表明，在相机跟踪、地图质量、语义和几何准确性方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: IAN的主动不变性和DRB-Loss的被动校正之间的协同作用，赋予系统前所未有的鲁棒性，实现了光照不变性的语义SLAM。

Abstract: Extreme exposure degrades both the 3D map reconstruction and semantic segmentation accuracy, which is particularly detrimental to tightly-coupled systems. To achieve illumination invariance, we propose a novel semantic SLAM framework with two designs. First, the Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module proactively disentangles the scene's intrinsic properties, such as albedo, from transient lighting. By learning a standardized, illumination-invariant appearance model, it assigns a stable and consistent color representation to each Gaussian primitive. Second, the Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) reactively handles frames with extreme exposure. It activates only when an image's exposure is poor, operating directly on the radiance field to guide targeted optimization. This prevents error accumulation from extreme lighting without compromising performance under normal conditions. The synergy between IAN's proactive invariance and DRB-Loss's reactive correction endows our system with unprecedented robustness. Evaluations on public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in camera tracking, map quality, and semantic and geometric accuracy.

TL;DR: BlockVid：一种新型块扩散框架，通过语义感知稀疏KV缓存、块强制训练策略和专门的噪声调度，解决长视频生成中的错误累积问题，在分钟级视频生成上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成分钟级视频是开发世界模型的关键步骤，但现有的半自回归（块扩散）方法面临两个持久挑战：1）KV缓存导致的长时域错误累积；2）缺乏细粒度的长视频基准和连贯性感知指标。

Method: 提出BlockVid框架，包含：1）语义感知稀疏KV缓存；2）块强制训练策略；3）专门的块级噪声调度和混洗机制，以减少错误传播并增强时间一致性。同时引入LV-Bench细粒度分钟级视频基准和新指标。

Result: 在VBench和LV-Bench上的大量实验表明，BlockVid在生成高质量、连贯的分钟级视频方面始终优于现有方法。在LV-Bench上，相比最先进方法，VDE Subject提升22.2%，VDE Clarity提升19.4%。

Conclusion: BlockVid通过创新的块扩散框架有效解决了长视频生成中的错误累积问题，并提供了专门的评估基准，为分钟级视频生成和世界模型发展提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Generating minute-long videos is a critical step toward developing world models, providing a foundation for realistic extended scenes and advanced AI simulators. The emerging semi-autoregressive (block diffusion) paradigm integrates the strengths of diffusion and autoregressive models, enabling arbitrary-length video generation and improving inference efficiency through KV caching and parallel sampling. However, it yet faces two enduring challenges: (i) KV-cache-induced long-horizon error accumulation, and (ii) the lack of fine-grained long-video benchmarks and coherence-aware metrics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BlockVid, a novel block diffusion framework equipped with semantic-aware sparse KV cache, an effective training strategy called Block Forcing, and dedicated chunk-wise noise scheduling and shuffling to reduce error propagation and enhance temporal consistency. We further introduce LV-Bench, a fine-grained benchmark for minute-long videos, complete with new metrics evaluating long-range coherence. Extensive experiments on VBench and LV-Bench demonstrate that BlockVid consistently outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality, coherent minute-long videos. In particular, it achieves a 22.2% improvement on VDE Subject and a 19.4% improvement on VDE Clarity in LV-Bench over the state of the art approaches. Project website: https://ziplab.co/BlockVid.

TL;DR: McSc是一个三阶段强化学习框架，通过维度分解推理、层次比较推理和运动校正优化，解决文本到视频生成中人类偏好对齐的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频偏好对齐方法依赖昂贵的人工标注或使用代理指标，缺乏对人类偏好逻辑的理解，且通常直接对齐整体偏好分布，忽略了运动动态和视觉质量等潜在冲突维度，可能导致模型偏向低运动内容。

Method: 提出三阶段框架：1) 自批判维度推理(ScDR)训练生成奖励模型分解偏好为维度评估；2) 层次比较推理(HCR)进行结构化多维度推理；3) 运动校正直接偏好优化(McDPO)优化T2V模型，动态重加权对齐目标以减轻低运动内容偏差。

Result: 实验表明McSc在人类偏好对齐方面表现优异，能够生成具有高运动动态的视频。

Conclusion: McSc通过系统化的偏好建模和校正机制，有效解决了T2V生成中人类偏好对齐的挑战，特别是避免了模型偏向低运动内容的问题。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in producing high-quality videos aligned with textual prompts. However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content. Experiments show that McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic.

Motivation: 解决现有文本到图像模型在文本渲染方面需要庞大计算资源或依赖闭源系统的问题，旨在缩小前沿文本渲染能力与实际部署可行性之间的差距。

Method: 基于Ovis-U1框架，集成扩散视觉解码器与更强的Ovis 2.5多模态骨干网络，采用以文本为中心的训练流程，结合大规模预训练和精心设计的后训练优化。

Conclusion: 通过强大的多模态骨干网络结合精心设计的文本中心训练方案，可以在不依赖超大或专有模型的情况下实现可靠的双语文本渲染，平衡性能与部署可行性。

Abstract: We introduce $\textbf{Ovis-Image}$, a 7B text-to-image model specifically optimized for high-quality text rendering, designed to operate efficiently under stringent computational constraints. Built upon our previous Ovis-U1 framework, Ovis-Image integrates a diffusion-based visual decoder with the stronger Ovis 2.5 multimodal backbone, leveraging a text-centric training pipeline that combines large-scale pre-training with carefully tailored post-training refinements. Despite its compact architecture, Ovis-Image achieves text rendering performance on par with significantly larger open models such as Qwen-Image and approaches closed-source systems like Seedream and GPT4o. Crucially, the model remains deployable on a single high-end GPU with moderate memory, narrowing the gap between frontier-level text rendering and practical deployment. Our results indicate that combining a strong multimodal backbone with a carefully designed, text-focused training recipe is sufficient to achieve reliable bilingual text rendering without resorting to oversized or proprietary models.

Conclusion: CFF是一种简单有效的特征滤波器，能够减少分割网络中卷积特征的噪声，改善特征处理质量，并通过信息熵计算提供了噪声减少的量化分析方法。

Abstract: Noise reduction constitutes a crucial operation within Digital Signal Processing. Regrettably, it frequently remains neglected when dealing with the processing of convolutional features in segmentation networks. This oversight could trigger the butterfly effect, impairing the subsequent outcomes within the entire feature system. To complete this void, we consider convolutional features following Gaussian distributions as feature signal matrices and then present a simple and effective feature filter in this study. The proposed filter is fundamentally a low-amplitude pass filter primarily aimed at minimizing noise in feature signal inputs and is named Convolutional Feature Filter (CFF). We conducted experiments on two established 2D segmentation networks and two public cardiac MR image datasets to validate the effectiveness of the CFF, and the experimental findings demonstrated a decrease in noise within the feature signal matrices. To enable a numerical observation and analysis of this reduction, we developed a binarization equation to calculate the information entropy of feature signals.

Result: 通过对多种文本到图像模型的分析，揭示了它们在多参考生成任务中的优异表现、典型失败模式和改进空间

Conclusion: MultiBanana将作为开放基准发布，推动多参考图像生成领域的边界，为公平比较建立标准化基础

Abstract: Recent text-to-image generation models have acquired the ability of multi-reference generation and editing; the ability to inherit the appearance of subjects from multiple reference images and re-render them under new contexts. However, the existing benchmark datasets often focus on the generation with single or a few reference images, which prevents us from measuring the progress on how model performance advances or pointing out their weaknesses, under different multi-reference conditions. In addition, their task definitions are still vague, typically limited to axes such as "what to edit" or "how many references are given", and therefore fail to capture the intrinsic difficulty of multi-reference settings. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{MultiBanana}$, which is carefully designed to assesses the edge of model capabilities by widely covering multi-reference-specific problems at scale: (1) varying the number of references, (2) domain mismatch among references (e.g., photo vs. anime), (3) scale mismatch between reference and target scenes, (4) references containing rare concepts (e.g., a red banana), and (5) multilingual textual references for rendering. Our analysis among a variety of text-to-image models reveals their superior performances, typical failure modes, and areas for improvement. MultiBanana will be released as an open benchmark to push the boundaries and establish a standardized basis for fair comparison in multi-reference image generation.

Conclusion: MIMM-X框架成功解决了医学影像中多个伪相关性的捷径学习问题，使模型预测基于真实的因果关系，提高了泛化能力

Abstract: Deep learning models can excel on medical tasks, yet often experience spurious correlations, known as shortcut learning, leading to poor generalization in new environments. Particularly in medical imaging, where multiple spurious correlations can coexist, misclassifications can have severe consequences. We propose MIMM-X, a framework that disentangles causal features from multiple spurious correlations by minimizing their mutual information. It enables predictions based on true underlying causal relationships rather than dataset-specific shortcuts. We evaluate MIMM-X on three datasets (UK Biobank, NAKO, CheXpert) across two imaging modalities (MRI and X-ray). Results demonstrate that MIMM-X effectively mitigates shortcut learning of multiple spurious correlations.

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has become a widely adopted and practical approach for enhancing generation quality and improving condition alignment. Recent studies have explored guidance mechanisms for unconditional generation, yet these approaches remain fundamentally tied to assumptions specific to diffusion models. In this work, we propose a spectrum-weakening framework for visual autoregressive (AR) models. This method works without the need for re-training, specific conditions, or any architectural modifications. It achieves this by constructing a controllable weak model in the spectral domain. We theoretically show that invertible spectral transformations preserve information, while selectively retaining only a subset of spectrum introduces controlled information reduction. Based on this insight, we perform spectrum selection along the channel dimension of internal representations, which avoids the structural constraints imposed by diffusion models. We further introduce two spectrum renormalization strategies that ensures numerical stability during the weakening process. Extensive experiments were conducted on both discrete and continuous AR models, with text or class conditioning. The results demonstrate that our method enables high-quality unconditional generation while maintaining strong prompt alignment for conditional generation.

Abstract: Recent advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have achieved considerable performance in RGB scene reconstruction. However, multi-modal rendering that incorporates thermal infrared imagery remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches tend to neglect distinctive thermal characteristics, such as heat conduction and the Lambertian property. In this study, we introduce MrGS, a multi-modal radiance field based on 3DGS that simultaneously reconstructs both RGB and thermal 3D scenes. Specifically, MrGS derives RGB- and thermal-related information from a single appearance feature through orthogonal feature extraction and employs view-dependent or view-independent embedding strategies depending on the degree of Lambertian reflectance exhibited by each modality. Furthermore, we leverage two physics-based principles to effectively model thermal-domain phenomena. First, we integrate Fourier's law of heat conduction prior to alpha blending to model intensity interpolation caused by thermal conduction between neighboring Gaussians. Second, we apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law and the inverse-square law to formulate a depth-aware thermal radiation map that imposes additional geometric constraints on thermal rendering. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MrGS achieves high-fidelity RGB-T scene reconstruction while reducing the number of Gaussians.

Conclusion: JarvisEvo通过模拟人类设计师的迭代编辑过程，有效解决了指令幻觉和奖励黑客问题，显著提升了图像编辑的质量和可靠性。

Abstract: Agent-based editing models have substantially advanced interactive experiences, processing quality, and creative flexibility. However, two critical challenges persist: (1) instruction hallucination, text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning cannot fully prevent factual errors due to inherent information bottlenecks; (2) reward hacking, dynamic policy optimization against static reward models allows agents to exploit flaws in reward functions. To address these issues, we propose JarvisEvo, a unified image editing agent that emulates an expert human designer by iteratively editing, selecting appropriate tools, evaluating results, and reflecting on its own decisions to refine outcomes. JarvisEvo offers three key advantages: (1) an interleaved multimodal chain-of-thought (iMCoT) reasoning mechanism that enhances instruction following and editing quality; (2) a synergistic editor-evaluator policy optimization (SEPO) framework that enables self-improvement without external rewards, effectively mitigating reward hacking; and (3) support for both global and local fine-grained editing through seamless integration of Adobe Lightroom. On ArtEdit-Bench, JarvisEvo outperforms Nano-Banana by an average of 18.95% on preservative editing metrics, including a substantial 44.96% improvement in pixel-level content fidelity.

Conclusion: 视觉理性化是构建透明、可验证、可信赖视觉语言模型的任务无关范式，确保模型"基于正确的视觉理由得出正确答案"。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language reasoning underscore the importance of thinking with images, where models actively ground their reasoning in visual evidence. Yet, prevailing frameworks treat visual actions as optional tools, boosting metrics but leaving reasoning ungrounded and crops ineffective. This gap gives rise to the illusion of thinking with images: models seem visually grounded but rely on context-agnostic actions that neither refine perception nor guide reasoning toward correct answers. We address this problem by reframing visual actions as core reasoning primitives rather than optional tools, which we term visual rationalization, the visual analogue of textual Chain-of-Thought. Building on this insight, we propose Visual Rationale Learning (ViRL), an end-to-end paradigm that grounds training in the visual rationale itself. ViRL integrates (1) Process Supervision with ground-truth rationales, (2) Objective Alignment via step-level reward shaping, and (3) Fine-Grained Credit Assignment to distinguish correct, redundant, and erroneous actions. By ensuring each action contributes meaningfully to the reasoning chain, ViRL enables models to "get the right answer for the right visual reason". Trained purely with end-to-end RL, ViRL achieves state-of-the-art results across benchmarks spanning perception, hallucination, and reasoning. This work establishes visual rationalization as a task-agnostic, process-grounded paradigm for building transparent, verifiable, and trustworthy vision-language models.

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has been considered as a novel way for view synthesis of dynamic scenes, which shows great potential in AIoT applications such as digital twins. However, recent dynamic Gaussian Splatting methods significantly degrade when only sparse input views are available, limiting their applicability in practice. The issue arises from the incoherent learning of 4D geometry as input views decrease. This paper presents GC-4DGS, a novel framework that infuses geometric consistency into 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS), offering real-time and high-quality dynamic scene rendering from sparse input views. While learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) and monocular depth estimators (MDEs) provide geometry priors, directly integrating these with 4DGS yields suboptimal results due to the ill-posed nature of sparse-input 4D geometric optimization. To address these problems, we introduce a dynamic consistency checking strategy to reduce estimation uncertainties of MVS across spacetime. Furthermore, we propose a global-local depth regularization approach to distill spatiotemporal-consistent geometric information from monocular depths, thereby enhancing the coherent geometry and appearance learning within the 4D volume. Extensive experiments on the popular N3DV and Technicolor datasets validate the effectiveness of GC-4DGS in rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. Notably, our method outperforms RF-DeRF, the latest dynamic radiance field tailored for sparse-input dynamic view synthesis, and the original 4DGS by 2.62dB and 1.58dB in PSNR, respectively, with seamless deployability on resource-constrained IoT edge devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GOATex是一种基于扩散模型的3D网格纹理生成方法，能同时处理外部和内部表面，通过遮挡感知的分层纹理生成解决现有方法对内部遮挡区域处理不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D纹理生成方法在可见区域表现良好，但缺乏处理遮挡内部区域的机制，导致纹理不完整和可见接缝。需要一种能同时处理内外表面的完整纹理生成方法。

Method: 提出遮挡感知纹理框架，基于命中级别概念通过多视角光线投射量化网格面的相对深度，将网格面划分为有序可见性层。采用两阶段可见性控制策略：先逐步揭示具有结构一致性的内部区域，然后使用预训练扩散模型为每层生成纹理。提出软UV空间混合技术，基于视图依赖的可见性置信度加权融合各层纹理。

Result: 实验结果表明GOATex持续优于现有方法，在可见和遮挡表面都能生成无缝、高保真纹理。无需对预训练扩散模型进行昂贵的微调，且允许对外部和内部网格区域分别提示，实现分层外观的细粒度控制。

Conclusion: GOATex通过遮挡感知的分层纹理生成框架，有效解决了3D网格内外表面纹理生成的完整性问题，实现了高质量、无缝的纹理生成，为3D内容创作提供了更精细的控制能力。

Abstract: We present GOATex, a diffusion-based method for 3D mesh texturing that generates high-quality textures for both exterior and interior surfaces. While existing methods perform well on visible regions, they inherently lack mechanisms to handle occluded interiors, resulting in incomplete textures and visible seams. To address this, we introduce an occlusion-aware texturing framework based on the concept of hit levels, which quantify the relative depth of mesh faces via multi-view ray casting. This allows us to partition mesh faces into ordered visibility layers, from outermost to innermost. We then apply a two-stage visibility control strategy that progressively reveals interior regions with structural coherence, followed by texturing each layer using a pretrained diffusion model. To seamlessly merge textures obtained across layers, we propose a soft UV-space blending technique that weighs each texture's contribution based on view-dependent visibility confidence. Empirical results demonstrate that GOATex consistently outperforms existing methods, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures across both visible and occluded surfaces. Unlike prior works, GOATex operates entirely without costly fine-tuning of a pretrained diffusion model and allows separate prompting for exterior and interior mesh regions, enabling fine-grained control over layered appearances.

TL;DR: 提出了一种量化单张图像对NeRF重建贡献度的方法，通过PSNR和MSE评估重建质量，并通过移除低贡献图像验证方法有效性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在XR和数字媒体领域，数据估值和货币化日益重要。对于从图像集进行3D场景重建，并非所有输入图像对最终输出贡献相同。NeRF虽然能实现逼真的3D重建，但野外场景常包含质量不一、有遮挡和瞬态物体的图像，导致输入效用不均

Method: 提出一种量化每张图像对基于NeRF重建贡献度的方法。通过基于PSNR和MSE的重建质量指标评估贡献度，并通过在训练中移除低贡献图像来验证方法

Result: 通过移除低贡献图像验证了方法的有效性，测量了对重建保真度的影响

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效量化图像对NeRF重建的贡献度，为数据估值和优化重建过程提供了实用工具

Abstract: Data valuation and monetization are becoming increasingly important across domains such as eXtended Reality (XR) and digital media. In the context of 3D scene reconstruction from a set of images -- whether casually or professionally captured -- not all inputs contribute equally to the final output. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) enable photorealistic 3D reconstruction of scenes by optimizing a volumetric radiance field given a set of images. However, in-the-wild scenes often include image captures of varying quality, occlusions, and transient objects, resulting in uneven utility across inputs. In this paper we propose a method to quantify the individual contribution of each image to NeRF-based reconstructions of in-the-wild image sets. Contribution is assessed through reconstruction quality metrics based on PSNR and MSE. We validate our approach by removing low-contributing images during training and measuring the resulting impact on reconstruction fidelity.

TL;DR: 生成式基础模型用于医学图像修复会显著降低AI诊断性能，即使仅修复非解剖区域也会引入潜在偏差


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估生成式基础模型修复医学图像伪影的临床可靠性，特别是对于儿科手部X光片中非解剖标记的修复是否保留骨龄和性别预测所需特征

Method: 使用RSNA骨龄挑战数据集，选取200张原始X光片，用gpt-image-1生成600张修复版本，通过自然语言提示定位非解剖伪影。使用深度学习集成模型评估骨龄估计和性别分类性能，采用MAE和AUC指标，并通过像素强度分布检测结构变化

Result: 修复显著降低模型性能：骨龄MAE从6.26个月增加到30.11个月，性别分类AUC从0.955下降到0.704。修复图像显示像素强度偏移和不一致，表明结构修改无法通过简单校准纠正

Conclusion: 虽然视觉上真实，但基于基础模型的修复会掩盖临床相关细微特征并引入潜在偏差，即使编辑仅限于非诊断区域。在将此类生成工具整合到临床AI工作流前，需要进行严格的任务特定验证

Abstract: Generative foundation models can remove visual artifacts through realistic image inpainting, but their impact on medical AI performance remains uncertain. Pediatric hand radiographs often contain non-anatomical markers, and it is unclear whether inpainting these regions preserves features needed for bone age and gender prediction. To evaluate the clinical reliability of generative model-based inpainting for artifact removal, we used the RSNA Bone Age Challenge dataset, selecting 200 original radiographs and generating 600 inpainted versions with gpt-image-1 using natural language prompts to target non-anatomical artifacts. Downstream performance was assessed with deep learning ensembles for bone age estimation and gender classification, using mean absolute error (MAE) and area under the ROC curve (AUC) as metrics, and pixel intensity distributions to detect structural alterations. Inpainting markedly degraded model performance: bone age MAE increased from 6.26 to 30.11 months, and gender classification AUC decreased from 0.955 to 0.704. Inpainted images displayed pixel-intensity shifts and inconsistencies, indicating structural modifications not corrected by simple calibration. These findings show that, although visually realistic, foundation model-based inpainting can obscure subtle but clinically relevant features and introduce latent bias even when edits are confined to non-diagnostic regions, underscoring the need for rigorous, task-specific validation before integrating such generative tools into clinical AI workflows.

TL;DR: REP通过构建模态特征缓冲区、私有-共享特征解耦和任务感知动态初始化，有效缓解多模态模型中模态缺失导致的性能下降问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型中模态缺失会导致显著性能下降，现有方法要么计算成本高，要么只利用相邻层特征而忽略了长距离上下文信息

Method: 1) 通过残差旁路构建模态特征缓冲区缓存早期层表示并在深层重放；2) 私有-共享特征解耦策略，私有缓冲区保留模态特定信号，共享缓冲区编码跨模态语义；3) 任务感知动态初始化机制，根据不同缺失模态条件配置缓冲区

Result: 在视觉-语言、视觉-语言-音频和时间多模态基准测试中，REP在单模态和多模态缺失场景下均优于现有方法，且仅引入可忽略的参数开销

Conclusion: REP为具有挑战性的缺失模态环境中的鲁棒多模态学习提供了一个轻量级且有效的范式

Abstract: Missing modalities consistently lead to significant performance degradation in multimodal models. Existing approaches either synthesize missing modalities at high computational cost or apply prompt-based fine-tuning that relies only on adjacent-layer features and overlooks long-distance contextual information, which may offer additional tolerance to errors when one or more modalities are missing. To address this, we introduce REplay Prompting (REP): (1) construct modality-wise feature buffers via a residual bypass to cache early-layer representations and replay them in deeper layers, mitigating information loss as network depth increases; (2) employ a private-shared feature decoupling strategy, where private buffers preserve modality-specific signals and shared buffers encode cross-modal semantics; and (3) design a task-aware dynamic initialization mechanism to configure these buffers differently, improving stability and generalization under diverse missing-modality conditions. Experiments on vision-language, vision-language-audio, and temporal multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that REP consistently outperforms prior methods under both single- and multi-modality missing scenarios, while introducing only negligible parameter overhead. These results establish REP as a lightweight and effective paradigm for robust multimodal learning in challenging missing-modality environments.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在多模态理解方面表现良好，但在3D空间推理（如距离估计、尺寸比较、跨视角一致性）方面仍有困难。现有方法要么依赖辅助3D信息，要么通过浅层特征融合增强RGB-only模型。

Method: 采用双编码器架构：VGGT作为空间理解编码器，InternViT作为2D视觉编码器。关键创新是将相机表示作为主动引导模态而非被动元数据，引入轻量级相机引导模态融合模块，应用相机条件偏置、几何重要性权重分配和相机嵌入门控融合。

Result: 在VSI-Bench、SQA3D和SPBench上建立了新的SOTA结果，在VSI-Bench和SPBench上大幅超越开源和专有系统，在SQA3D上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 相机引导的模态融合是为视觉语言模型提供真正空间基础智能的有效且实用的归纳偏置。将发布代码和模型检查点以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) show strong multimodal understanding but still struggle with 3D spatial reasoning, such as distance estimation, size comparison, and cross-view consistency. Existing 3D-aware methods either depend on auxiliary 3D information or enhance RGB-only VLMs with geometry encoders through shallow feature fusion. We propose SpaceMind, a multimodal large language model explicitly designed for spatial reasoning solely from RGB inputs. The model adopts a dual-encoder architecture, integrating VGGT as a spatial understanding encoder and InternViT as a 2D visual encoder. The key idea is to treat the camera representation as an active guiding modality rather than passive metadata. Specifically, SpaceMind introduces a lightweight Camera-Guided Modality Fusion module before the language model to replace shallow fusion. It applies camera-conditioned biasing to spatial tokens, assigns query-independent weights reflecting their geometric importance, and uses the camera embedding to gate the fused representation. Empirically, SpaceMind establishes new state-of-the-art results on VSI-Bench, SQA3D and SPBench, surpassing both open and proprietary systems on VSI-Bench and SPBench by large margins and achieving state-of-the-art performance on SQA3D. These results demonstrate that camera-guided modality fusion is an effective and practical inductive bias for equipping VLMs with genuinely spatially grounded intelligence. We will release code and model checkpoints to support future research.

Method: 提出ENSEL系统，采用集成学习方法整合多种深度学习模型，使用实际用户拍摄的皮肤病变图像进行实验验证。

Result: ENSEL在大多数图像中实现了高召回率，处理速度小于1秒，表现出良好的准确性和响应时间。

Conclusion: ENSEL系统有助于皮肤病变的客观诊断，促进了数字医疗的进步。

Abstract: The amendments made to the Data 3 Act and impact of COVID-19 have fostered the growth of digital healthcare market and promoted the use of medical data in artificial intelligence in South Korea. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is diagnosed via subjective evaluations without using objective diagnostic methods, thereby increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. It is also similar to psoriasis in appearance, further complicating its accurate diagnosis. Existing studies on skin diseases have used high-quality dermoscopic image datasets, but such high-quality images cannot be obtained in actual clinical settings. Moreover, existing systems must ensure accuracy and fast response times. To this end, an ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system (ENSEL) was proposed herein. ENSEL enhanced diagnostic accuracy by integrating various deep learning models via an ensemble approach. Its performance was verified by conducting skin lesion detection experiments using images of skin lesions taken by actual users. Its accuracy and response time were measured using randomly sampled skin disease images. Results revealed that ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and less than 1s s processing speed. This study contributes to the objective diagnosis of skin lesions and promotes the advancement of digital healthcare.

Motivation: 基于文本指令的图像编辑缺乏对编辑强度的精确控制，需要更细粒度的数值控制方法

Method: 通过Numeric Adapter编码数值编辑尺度，以即插即用方式注入扩散模型；采用任务分离设计支持零样本多条件编辑；使用渲染引擎和相机合成高质量训练数据

Result: 在多种属性编辑场景中实现准确、连续、稳定的尺度控制，可作为强大的交互式编辑工作室

Conclusion: 通过数值控制实现了精确、可扩展、用户可控的图像编辑，推动了基于指令的图像编辑技术发展

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing enables intuitive manipulation through natural language commands. However, text instructions alone often lack the precision required for fine-grained control over edit intensity. We introduce NumeriKontrol, a framework that allows users to precisely adjust image attributes using continuous scalar values with common units. NumeriKontrol encodes numeric editing scales via an effective Numeric Adapter and injects them into diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner. Thanks to a task-separated design, our approach supports zero-shot multi-condition editing, allowing users to specify multiple instructions in any order. To provide high-quality supervision, we synthesize precise training data from reliable sources, including high-fidelity rendering engines and DSLR cameras. Our Common Attribute Transform (CAT) dataset covers diverse attribute manipulations with accurate ground-truth scales, enabling NumeriKontrol to function as a simple yet powerful interactive editing studio. Extensive experiments show that NumeriKontrol delivers accurate, continuous, and stable scale control across a wide range of attribute editing scenarios. These contributions advance instruction-based image editing by enabling precise, scalable, and user-controllable image manipulation.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在数学推理中视觉信息真实贡献不明确，基准测试很少分离图像模态作用，不清楚模型是否真正利用视觉理解还是仅依赖语言先验。

Method: 创建MathSight基准，每个问题包含多个视觉变体（原始、手绘、照片拍摄）和纯文本条件进行控制比较，通过实验分析VLMs表现。

Result: 实验显示视觉信息贡献随问题难度增加而减少，无图像输入的Qwen3-VL优于其多模态变体和GPT-5，表明当前VLMs视觉理解有限。

Conclusion: 需要像MathSight这样的基准来推动未来模型中真正的视觉基础推理发展，当前VLMs在复杂数学推理中过度依赖语言先验而非视觉理解。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal mathematical reasoning. Yet, how much visual information truly contributes to reasoning remains unclear. Existing benchmarks report strong overall performance but seldom isolate the role of the image modality, leaving open whether VLMs genuinely leverage visual understanding or merely depend on linguistic priors. To address this, we present MathSight, a university-level multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark designed to disentangle and quantify the effect of visual input. Each problem includes multiple visual variants -- original, hand-drawn, photo-captured -- and a text-only condition for controlled comparison. Experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a consistent trend: the contribution of visual information diminishes with increasing problem difficulty. Remarkably, Qwen3-VL without any image input surpasses both its multimodal variants and GPT-5, underscoring the need for benchmarks like MathSight to advance genuine vision-grounded reasoning in future models.

Motivation: 在视觉生成中，缩放扩散变换器推理的序列并行化对降低延迟至关重要，但当应用于采用块状稀疏注意力的模型时，由于注意力头间稀疏度变化和稀疏掩码中密集块的不规则分布，会导致严重的工作负载不平衡

Method: 提出db-SP方法：1) 形式化稀疏不平衡比来量化不平衡问题；2) 采用双级分区方法，在头和块级别实现近乎完美的工作负载平衡；3) 动态确定运行时头和块维度的并行度以适应去噪步骤和层间的稀疏模式变化

Conclusion: db-SP通过解决稀疏注意力中的工作负载不平衡问题，显著提升了扩散变换器推理的序列并行化效率，代码已开源

Abstract: Scaling Diffusion Transformer (DiT) inference via sequence parallelism is critical for reducing latency in visual generation, but is severely hampered by workload imbalance when applied to models employing block-wise sparse attention. The imbalance stems from the inherent variation in sparsity across attention heads and the irregular distribution of dense blocks within the sparse mask, when sequence parallelism is applied along the head dimension (as in Ulysses) or the block dimension (as in Ring Attention). In this paper, we formalize a sparse imbalance ratio to quantify the imbalance, and propose db-SP, a sparsity-aware sequence parallelism technique that tackles the challenge. db-SP contains a dual-level partitioning approach that achieves near-perfect workload balance at both the head and block levels with negligible overhead. Furthermore, to handle the evolving sparsity patterns across denoising steps and layers, db-SP dynamically determines the parallel degrees for the head and block dimensions at runtime. Experimental results demonstrate that db-SP delivers an end-to-end speedup of 1.25x and an attention-specific speedup of 1.40x over state-of-the-art sequence parallel methods on average.

Conclusion: 通过情感字幕生成方法，利用纯文本进行图像情感分类，有效解决了情感鸿沟问题，为图像情感分类提供了新思路，并在多基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Image emotion classification (IEC) is a longstanding research field that has received increasing attention with the rapid progress of deep learning. Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the "affective gap" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the "affective gap". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks.

Conclusion: DNA-Prior为医学图像去噪提供了一种数学原理严谨的通用无监督解决方案，能够稳定下游分割和重建任务，适用于临床异构环境

Abstract: Medical imaging pipelines critically rely on robust denoising to stabilise downstream tasks such as segmentation and reconstruction. However, many existing denoisers depend on large annotated datasets or supervised learning, which restricts their usability in clinical environments with heterogeneous modalities and limited ground-truth data. To address this limitation, we introduce DNA-Prior, a universal unsupervised denoising framework that reconstructs clean images directly from corrupted observations through a mathematically principled hybrid prior. DNA-Prior integrates (i) an implicit architectural prior, enforced through a deep network parameterisation, with (ii) an explicit spectral-spatial prior composed of a frequency-domain fidelity term and a spatial regularisation functional. This dual-domain formulation yields a well-structured optimisation problem that jointly preserves global frequency characteristics and local anatomical structure, without requiring any external training data or modality-specific tuning. Experiments across multiple modalities show that DNA achieves consistent noise suppression and structural preservation under diverse noise conditions.

Method: 提出双分支框架同时生成相机一致的RGB和深度序列，并引入语义引导的互对齐机制进行RGB-深度融合，以解耦外观和几何建模

Result: 相比先前方法，相机运动误差减少超过40%，实现了更一致的相机控制视频生成

Conclusion: DualCamCtrl通过双分支设计和语义引导的互对齐机制，显著提升了相机控制视频生成的几何一致性和准确性

Abstract: This paper presents DualCamCtrl, a novel end-to-end diffusion model for camera-controlled video generation. Recent works have advanced this field by representing camera poses as ray-based conditions, yet they often lack sufficient scene understanding and geometric awareness. DualCamCtrl specifically targets this limitation by introducing a dual-branch framework that mutually generates camera-consistent RGB and depth sequences. To harmonize these two modalities, we further propose the Semantic Guided Mutual Alignment (SIGMA) mechanism, which performs RGB-depth fusion in a semantics-guided and mutually reinforced manner. These designs collectively enable DualCamCtrl to better disentangle appearance and geometry modeling, generating videos that more faithfully adhere to the specified camera trajectories. Additionally, we analyze and reveal the distinct influence of depth and camera poses across denoising stages and further demonstrate that early and late stages play complementary roles in forming global structure and refining local details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DualCamCtrl achieves more consistent camera-controlled video generation, with over 40\% reduction in camera motion errors compared with prior methods.

Conclusion: InstanceV框架成功解决了文本到视频生成中实例级控制不足的问题，实现了细粒度可控的高质量视频生成，为视频生成领域提供了新的技术方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled the generation of high-quality videos conditioned on textual descriptions. However, most existing text-to-video models rely solely on textual conditions, lacking general fine-grained controllability over video generation. To address this challenge, we propose InstanceV, a video generation framework that enables i) instance-level control and ii) global semantic consistency. Specifically, with the aid of proposed Instance-aware Masked Cross-Attention mechanism, InstanceV maximizes the utilization of additional instance-level grounding information to generate correctly attributed instances at designated spatial locations. To improve overall consistency, We introduce the Shared Timestep-Adaptive Prompt Enhancement module, which connects local instances with global semantics in a parameter-efficient manner. Furthermore, we incorporate Spatially-Aware Unconditional Guidance during both training and inference to alleviate the disappearance of small instances. Finally, we propose a new benchmark, named InstanceBench, which combines general video quality metrics with instance-aware metrics for more comprehensive evaluation on instance-level video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstanceV not only achieves remarkable instance-level controllability in video generation, but also outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in both general quality and instance-aware metrics across qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Abstract: Document rectification in real-world scenarios poses significant challenges due to extreme variations in camera perspectives and physical distortions. Driven by the insight that complex transformations can be decomposed and resolved progressively, we introduce a novel multi-stage framework that progressively reverses distinct distortion types in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, our framework first performs a global affine transformation to correct perspective distortions arising from the camera's viewpoint, then rectifies geometric deformations resulting from physical paper curling and folding, and finally employs a content-aware iterative process to eliminate fine-grained content distortions. To address limitations in existing evaluation protocols, we also propose two enhanced metrics: layout-aligned OCR metrics (AED/ACER) for a stable assessment that decouples geometric rectification quality from the layout analysis errors of OCR engines, and masked AD/AAD (AD-M/AAD-M) tailored for accurately evaluating geometric distortions in documents with incomplete boundaries. Extensive experiments show that our method establishes new state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging benchmarks, yielding a substantial reduction of 14.1\%--34.7\% in the AAD metric and demonstrating superior efficacy in real-world applications. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/chaoyunwang/ArbDR.

TL;DR: RA-RFT方法通过强化学习微调，让视频时序定位模型能够有效拒绝硬无关查询，提升模型对相关性的判别能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VTG模型假设查询总是相关的，导致对无关查询也会错误预测。现有方法只能拒绝完全无关查询，无法处理语义相似但实际无关的"硬无关查询"

Method: 提出拒绝感知强化微调(RA-RFT)，基于GRPO框架，整合格式、拒绝IoU、解释和查询修正四个奖励目标，构建硬无关VTG数据集(HI-VTG)

Result: 方法在多种相关性感知VTG场景中有效，包括硬无关VTG、简单洗牌RA-VTG和人工标注RA-VTG，可扩展到多种LVLM-based VTG模型

Conclusion: RA-RFT能有效拒绝硬无关查询，提升VTG模型的相关性判别和细粒度语义推理能力，具有良好扩展性

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize a temporal segment in a video corresponding to a natural language query. However, existing VTG models assume that a relevant segment always exists, causing them to always predict a target segment even when the query is irrelevant to the video. While recent approaches attempt to handle irrelevant queries, they can only reject those that are entirely unrelated to the video and still fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant. To address this, we propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to effectively refuse hard-irrelevant queries in VTG. Our method is based on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and integrates four reward objectives-format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction-to improve both relevance discrimination and fine-grained semantic reasoning. In addition, to effectively support RA-RFT, we construct a Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset, which includes hard-irrelevant queries and their refusal answers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios, including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings. We also show that the proposed method is scalable by applying it to various LVLM-based VTG models. Our code is available at https://github.com/JINSUBY/RA-RFT.

Motivation: 当前AI生成图像越来越逼真，难以与真实图像区分，对社会信任和信息完整性构成威胁。现有可解释检测方法主要依赖事后合理化或视觉判别，缺乏可验证的证据链，限制了因果解释的生成和泛化能力。

Method: 1) 提出REVEAL-Bench基准，基于多个轻量级专家模型构建证据链，记录逐步推理轨迹和证据依据；2) 提出REVEAL框架，集成检测与专家基础的强化学习，奖励机制联合优化检测精度、解释保真度和逻辑一致性。

Conclusion: 通过引入基于证据链的推理增强方法，REVEAL框架解决了现有可解释图像取证方法的局限性，提供了细粒度、可解释且可验证的检测方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, visually realistic AI-generated images have become increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic ones, posing severe threats to social trust and information integrity. Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications. Building upon this dataset, we propose \textbf{REVEAL} (\underline{R}easoning-\underline{e}nhanced Forensic E\underline{v}id\underline{e}nce \underline{A}na\underline{l}ysis), an effective and explainable forensic framework that integrates detection with a novel expert-grounded reinforcement learning. Our reward mechanism is specially tailored to jointly optimize detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence grounded in explicit forensic evidence, enabling REVEAL to produce fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside its detection outcomes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, benchmarking a new state of the art for explainable image forensics.

Motivation: 现有CLIP等对比预训练框架在细粒度组合理解方面存在局限，难以捕捉跨多个图像区域的组合语义。需要一种能有效对齐图像区域子集与文本短语的方法。

Conclusion: 通过幂集对齐增强的对比预训练框架能有效提升细粒度组合理解能力，同时通过非线性聚合器解决了计算复杂度问题，为视觉语言预训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language pre-training frameworks such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance across a range of vision-language tasks. Recent studies have shown that aligning individual text tokens with specific image patches or regions enhances fine-grained compositional understanding. However, it remains challenging to capture compositional semantics that span multiple image regions. To address this limitation, we propose PowerCLIP, a novel contrastive pre-training framework enhanced by powerset alignment, which exhaustively optimizes region-to-phrase alignments by minimizing the loss defined between powersets of image regions and textual parse trees. Since the naive powerset construction incurs exponential computational cost due to the combinatorial explosion in the number of region subsets, we introduce efficient non-linear aggregators (NLAs) that reduce complexity from O(2^M) to O(M) with respect to the number of regions M, while approximating the exact loss value with arbitrary precision. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that PowerCLIP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks, underscoring the compositionality and robustness of our approach. Our code will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有基于文本的3D编辑方法依赖2D模型逐视角处理，需要迭代的2D-3D-2D更新，导致速度慢且容易产生过平滑结果，因为不同视角的编辑信号在迭代过程中被平均化

Method: 1) 利用预训练视频生成模型的时序一致性先验，通过单个编辑视角生成其他一致编辑视角；2) 提出运动保持噪声混合技术，在预定相机位姿生成编辑视角；3) 引入几何感知去噪，将3D几何先验整合到视频模型中增强多视角一致性

Conclusion: 通过利用视频模型的时序一致性先验，ViP3DE成功解决了传统3D编辑方法的多视角一致性问题，实现了高效且高质量的3D编辑

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing enables user-friendly 3D object or scene editing with text instructions. Due to the lack of multi-view consistency priors, existing methods typically resort to employing 2D generation or editing models to process each view individually, followed by iterative 2D-3D-2D updating. However, these methods are not only time-consuming but also prone to over-smoothed results because the different editing signals gathered from different views are averaged during the iterative process. In this paper, we propose generative Video Prior based 3D Editing (ViP3DE) to employ the temporal consistency priors from pre-trained video generation models for multi-view consistent 3D editing in a single forward pass. Our key insight is to condition the video generation model on a single edited view to generate other consistent edited views for 3D updating directly, thereby bypassing the iterative editing paradigm. Since 3D updating requires edited views to be paired with specific camera poses, we propose motion-preserved noise blending for the video model to generate edited views at predefined camera poses. In addition, we introduce geometry-aware denoising to further enhance multi-view consistency by integrating 3D geometric priors into video models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed ViP3DE can achieve high-quality 3D editing results even within a single forward pass, significantly outperforming existing methods in both editing quality and speed.

Abstract: Previous works leveraging video models for image-to-3D scene generation tend to suffer from geometric distortions and blurry content. In this paper, we renovate the pipeline of image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking the potential of geometry models and present our GeoWorld. Instead of exploiting geometric information obtained from a single-frame input, we propose to first generate consecutive video frames and then take advantage of the geometry model to provide full-frame geometry features, which contain richer information than single-frame depth maps or camera embeddings used in previous methods, and use these geometry features as geometrical conditions to aid the video generation model. To enhance the consistency of geometric structures, we further propose a geometry alignment loss to provide the model with real-world geometric constraints and a geometry adaptation module to ensure the effective utilization of geometry features. Extensive experiments show that our GeoWorld can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single image and a given camera trajectory, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Abstract: We introduce Vision Bridge Transformer (ViBT), a large-scale instantiation of Brownian Bridge Models designed for conditional generation. Unlike traditional diffusion models that transform noise into data, Bridge Models directly model the trajectory between inputs and outputs, creating an efficient data-to-data translation paradigm. By scaling these models to 20B and 1.3B parameters, we demonstrate their effectiveness for image and video translation tasks. To support this scale, we adopt a Transformer architecture and propose a variance-stabilized velocity-matching objective for robust training. Together, these advances highlight the power of scaling Bridge Models for instruction-based image editing and complex video translation.

Abstract: Pathology foundation models (FMs) have driven significant progress in computational pathology. However, these high-performing models can easily exceed a billion parameters and produce high-dimensional embeddings, thus limiting their applicability for research or clinical use when computing resources are tight. Here, we introduce Pathryoshka, a multi-teacher distillation framework inspired by RADIO distillation and Matryoshka Representation Learning to reduce pathology FM sizes while allowing for adaptable embedding dimensions. We evaluate our framework with a distilled model on ten public pathology benchmarks with varying downstream tasks. Compared to its much larger teachers, Pathryoshka reduces the model size by 86-92% at on-par performance. It outperforms state-of-the-art single-teacher distillation models of comparable size by a median margin of 7.0 in accuracy. By enabling efficient local deployment without sacrificing accuracy or representational richness, Pathryoshka democratizes access to state-of-the-art pathology FMs for the broader research and clinical community.

Abstract: Early-stage visual quality inspection is vital for achieving Zero-Defect Manufacturing and minimizing production waste in modern industrial environments. However, the complexity of robust visual inspection systems and their extensive data requirements hinder widespread adoption in semi-controlled industrial settings. In this context, we propose a pose-agnostic, zero-shot quality inspection framework that compares real scenes against real-time Digital Twins (DT) in the RGB-D space. Our approach enables efficient real-time DT rendering by semantically describing industrial scenes through object detection and pose estimation of known Computer-Aided Design models. We benchmark tools for real-time, multimodal RGB-D DT creation while tracking consumption of computational resources. Additionally, we provide an extensible and hierarchical annotation strategy for multi-criteria defect detection, unifying pose labelling with logical and structural defect annotations. Based on an automotive use case featuring the quality inspection of an axial flux motor, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our results demonstrate detection performace, achieving intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of up to 63.3% compared to ground-truth masks, even if using simple distance measurements under semi-controlled industrial conditions. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on generalizable, low-data defect detection methods in dynamic manufacturing settings.

Abstract: Tabular instruction tuning has emerged as a promising research direction for improving LLMs understanding of tabular data. However, the majority of existing works only consider question-answering and reasoning tasks over tabular data, leaving tabular data generation largely unnoticed. In this work, for the first time, we explore the efficacy of instruction tuning in improving LLMs tabular data generation capabilities. More specifically, given the high data and computation requirements of tabular instruction tuning, we aim to address the possibility of instruction tuning for tabular data generation with limited data and computational resources. To achieve this, we first create a high-quality instruction dataset for tabular data, enabling efficient LLM comprehension. We then instruction-tune an open-source LLM (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct) on the training set of this dataset to improve its tabular data generation performance. Our experimental results show that by using our high-quality dataset and instruction-tuning on only 7K instructions with an A100 GPU, for less than 6 hours, we achieve tabular data generation performance on par with the most capable commercial LLM, GPT-4o.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了3DGS-SLAM中渲染质量决定跟踪精度的传统观念，提出通过平滑核策略增强光栅化过程对参数误差的鲁棒性，从而提高相机位姿跟踪稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS-SLAM方法过度追求完美的场景表示和渲染质量，但作者认为更重要的是增强光栅化过程对3DGS参数误差的鲁棒性，以确保稳定的相机位姿跟踪。

Method: 提出CB-KNN方法：通过自适应修改局部区域内K个最近邻高斯的RGB值和位置，生成更平滑的局部渲染，减少错误GS参数对整体图像的影响。这本质上是一种引入可控模糊作为正则化的平滑核策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持场景重建整体质量的同时，显著提高了相机位姿跟踪的鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: 相比单纯追求完美场景表示，增强光栅化过程对参数误差的鲁棒性对3DGS-SLAM的跟踪性能更为关键。CB-KNN提供了一种实用有效的解决方案，可轻松集成到现有3DGS框架中。

Abstract: In this paper, we challenge the conventional notion in 3DGS-SLAM that rendering quality is the primary determinant of tracking accuracy. We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking.

Abstract: Accurate detection of tea leaf pests and diseases in real plantations remains challenging due to complex backgrounds, variable illumination, and frequent occlusions among dense branches and leaves. Existing detectors often suffer from missed detections and false positives in such scenarios. To address these issues, we propose DAONet-YOLOv8, an enhanced YOLOv8 variant with three key improvements: (1) a Dual-Attention Fusion Module (DAFM) that combines convolutional local feature extraction with self-attention based global context modeling to focus on subtle lesion regions while suppressing background noise; (2) an occlusion-aware detection head (Detect-OAHead) that learns the relationship between visible and occluded parts to compensate for missing lesion features; and (3) a C2f-DSConv module employing dynamic synthesis convolutions with multiple kernel shapes to better capture irregular lesion boundaries. Experiments on our real-world tea plantation dataset containing six pest and disease categories demonstrate that DAONet-YOLOv8 achieves 92.97% precision, 92.80% recall, 97.10% mAP@50 and 76.90% mAP@50:95, outperforming the YOLOv8n baseline by 2.34, 4.68, 1.40 and 1.80 percentage points respectively, while reducing parameters by 16.7%.

Abstract: Existing convolutional learning methods for 3D point cloud data are divided into two paradigms: point-based methods that preserve geometric precision but often face performance challenges, and voxel-based methods that achieve high efficiency through quantization at the cost of geometric fidelity. This loss of precision is a critical bottleneck for tasks such as point cloud registration. We propose PointCNN++, a novel architectural design that fundamentally mitigates this precision-performance trade-off. It \textbf{generalizes sparse convolution from voxels to points}, treating voxel-based convolution as a specialized, degraded case of our more general point-based convolution. First, we introduce a point-centric convolution where the receptive field is centered on the original, high-precision point coordinates. Second, to make this high-fidelity operation performant, we design a computational strategy that operates \textbf{natively} on points. We formulate the convolution on native points as a Matrix-Vector Multiplication and Reduction (MVMR) problem, for which we develop a dedicated, highly-optimized GPU kernel. Experiments demonstrate that PointCNN++ \textbf{uses an order of magnitude less memory and is several times faster} than representative point-based methods. Furthermore, when used as a simple replacement for the voxel-based backbones it generalizes, it \textbf{significantly improves point cloud registration accuracies while proving both more memory-efficient and faster}. PointCNN++ shows that preserving geometric detail and achieving high performance are not mutually exclusive, paving the way for a new class of 3D learning with high fidelity and efficiency. Our code will be open sourced.

Abstract: Functionality understanding in 3D, which aims to identify the functional element in a 3D scene to complete an action (e.g., the correct handle to "Open the second drawer of the cabinet near the bed"), is hindered by the scarcity of real-world data due to the substantial effort needed for its collection and annotation. To address this, we introduce SynthFun3D, the first method for task-based 3D scene synthesis. Given the action description, SynthFun3D generates a 3D indoor environment using a furniture asset database with part-level annotation, ensuring the action can be accomplished. It reasons about the action to automatically identify and retrieve the 3D mask of the correct functional element, enabling the inexpensive and large-scale generation of high-quality annotated data. We validate SynthFun3D through user studies, which demonstrate improved scene-prompt coherence compared to other approaches. Our quantitative results further show that the generated data can either replace real data with minor performance loss or supplement real data for improved performance, thereby providing an inexpensive and scalable solution for data-hungry 3D applications.

TL;DR: 提出MRRE方法，无需额外训练数据或工具，通过推理时注入预计算向量来增强多语言推理能力，提升低资源语言性能并保持输入输出语言一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs和LVLMs在英语上的推理能力远优于低资源语言，存在多语言应用中的公平性问题。现有方法要么依赖昂贵的多语言训练，要么使用外部翻译工具，都资源密集且对翻译质量敏感。

Method: 提出MRRE方法：在推理处理时在特定层顺序注入两个预计算向量：1)跨语言推理增强向量，将非英语推理表征引导至英语空间；2)目标语言输出锚定向量，恢复目标语言分布以保持输入输出语言一致性。

Result: 在6个先进LLMs和LVLMs上的4个推理基准测试表明，MRRE平均提升非英语推理能力5.48%，在低资源语言（泰语和斯瓦希里语）上最高提升7.54%，同时将输入输出语言一致性提高3.78%。

Conclusion: MRRE是一种无需训练、资源高效的推理时方法，能有效增强多语言推理能力，特别是在低资源语言上，同时保持语言一致性，为解决多语言公平性问题提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong reasoning capabilities, yet their performance in English significantly outperforms that in low-resource languages, raising fairness concerns in multilingual applications. Existing approaches either rely on costly multilingual training or employ prompting with external translation tools, both of which are resource-intensive and sensitive to translation quality. To address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time method to enhance Multilingual Reasoning capabilities via Representation Engineering (MRRE) without using any additional training data or tools. MRRE sequentially injects two precomputed vectors at specific layers during inference processing: cross-lingual reasoning enhancement vectors, which steer non-English reasoning representations toward English space to unlock multilingual reasoning, and target-language output anchoring vectors, which restore the distribution of the target language to preserve input-output language consistency. Comprehensive experiments across six advanced LLMs and LVLMs on four reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MRRE consistently enhances non-English reasoning by an average gain of 5.48% and up to 7.54% in low-resource languages (Thai and Swahili), while improving input-output language consistency by 3.78%.

TL;DR: 本文比较了多种领域随机化和领域自适应技术，发现当有足够多样性的渲染数据时，简单的基于特征的方法（如感知哈希过滤）在准确性和资源效率上优于复杂的生成式AI方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少数据生成和标注的负担是机器学习和机器人技术在实际工业部署中的主要挑战。合成渲染是有前景的解决方案，但缩小仿真与现实的差距通常需要专家干预。

Method: 本文对一系列领域随机化(DR)和领域自适应(DA)技术进行基准测试，包括基于特征的方法、生成式AI(GenAI)和经典渲染方法。评估重点是低层和高层特征对齐的有效性和效率，以及基于提示引导的受控扩散DA方法。在两个数据集上验证：专有工业数据集（汽车和物流）和公共机器人数据集。

Result: 如果有足够多样性的渲染数据作为种子，简单的基于特征的方法（如亮度过滤和感知哈希过滤）在准确性和资源效率上优于复杂的生成式AI方法。感知哈希在工业数据集上达到98% mAP50，在机器人数据集上达到67% mAP50。生成式AI方法在数据生成方面有显著时间开销，且相比简单方法没有明显改善仿真到现实的mAP值。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效缩小仿真与现实差距提供了可行见解，使仅使用合成数据训练的模型能够实现高真实世界性能。感知哈希等简单方法在实际应用中更具优势。

Abstract: Reducing the burden of data generation and annotation remains a major challenge for the cost-effective deployment of machine learning in industrial and robotics settings. While synthetic rendering is a promising solution, bridging the sim-to-real gap often requires expert intervention. In this work, we benchmark a range of domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques, including feature-based methods, generative AI (GenAI), and classical rendering approaches, for creating contextualized synthetic data without manual annotation. Our evaluation focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of low-level and high-level feature alignment, as well as a controlled diffusion-based DA method guided by prompts generated from real-world contexts. We validate our methods on two datasets: a proprietary industrial dataset (automotive and logistics) and a public robotics dataset. Results show that if render-based data with enough variability is available as seed, simpler feature-based methods, such as brightness-based and perceptual hashing filtering, outperform more complex GenAI-based approaches in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Perceptual hashing consistently achieves the highest performance, with mAP50 scores of 98% and 67% on the industrial and robotics datasets, respectively. Additionally, GenAI methods present significant time overhead for data generation at no apparent improvement of sim-to-real mAP values compared to simpler methods. Our findings offer actionable insights for efficiently bridging the sim-to-real gap, enabling high real-world performance from models trained exclusively on synthetic data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 森林在全球生态系统中至关重要，但传统地上生物量估算方法依赖劳动密集的实地测量或遥感技术，在茂密植被中存在显著局限性

Method: 将AGB估算构建为密集预测任务，引入AGB密度图概念，利用合成3D SPREAD数据集训练模型预测AGB密度图，通过积分恢复整个场景的AGB估计

Result: 在SPREAD测试数据上实现中位AGB估算误差1.22 kg/m²，在真实图像数据集上达到1.94 kg/m²，首次实现从单张RGB图像直接估算地上生物量

Conclusion: 该方法为森林监测提供了可扩展、可解释且经济高效的解决方案，同时通过公民科学计划实现更广泛的参与

Abstract: Forests play a critical role in global ecosystems by supporting biodiversity and mitigating climate change via carbon sequestration. Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives.

Motivation: 传统MRI采集耗时，欠采样加速会降低图像质量，现有方法要么处理欠采样重建，要么处理伪影校正，但无法同时处理两者，限制了在真实场景中的性能

Method: 提出USArt模型，采用双子模型架构，专门针对笛卡尔采样的2D脑解剖图像，同时处理欠采样重建和噪声/运动伪影校正

Result: 显著提高信噪比和对比度，梯度欠采样策略效果最佳，实现5倍加速同时校正伪影，在真实场景中表现出鲁棒性

Conclusion: USArt首次同时解决MRI欠采样加速和伪影校正问题，为快速高质量MRI成像提供有效解决方案

Abstract: MR data are acquired in the frequency domain, known as k-space. Acquiring high-quality and high-resolution MR images can be time-consuming, posing a significant challenge when multiple sequences providing complementary contrast information are needed or when the patient is unable to remain in the scanner for an extended period of time. Reducing k-space measurements is a strategy to speed up acquisition, but often leads to reduced quality in reconstructed images. Additionally, in real-world MRI, both under-sampled and full-sampled images are prone to artefacts, and correcting these artefacts is crucial for maintaining diagnostic accuracy. Deep learning methods have been proposed to restore image quality from under-sampled data, while others focused on the correction of artefacts that result from the noise or motion. No approach has however been proposed so far that addresses both acceleration and artefacts correction, limiting the performance of these models when these degradation factors occur simultaneously. To address this gap, we present a method for recovering high-quality images from under-sampled data with simultaneously correction for noise and motion artefact called USArt (Under-Sampling and Artifact correction model). Customized for 2D brain anatomical images acquired with Cartesian sampling, USArt employs a dual sub-model approach. The results demonstrate remarkable increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast in the images restored. Various under-sampling strategies and degradation levels were explored, with the gradient under-sampling strategy yielding the best outcomes. We achieved up to 5x acceleration and simultaneously artefacts correction without significant degradation, showcasing the model's robustness in real-world settings.

TL;DR: FACT-GS提出了一种频率对齐的复杂度感知纹理高斯泼溅框架，通过自适应采样密度分配来提升纹理表达效率，解决传统均匀采样在高频区域细节丢失和平滑区域资源浪费的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于纹理的高斯泼溅方法采用均匀采样网格，无论局部视觉复杂度如何都分配相同的采样密度。这导致高频区域采样不足而模糊，平滑区域则浪费容量，限制了纹理空间的利用效率。

Method: FACT-GS将纹理参数化重新表述为可微分的采样密度分配问题，用可学习的频率感知分配策略替代均匀纹理。通过变形场实现，其雅可比矩阵调制局部采样密度，在固定分辨率纹理网格上执行非均匀采样。

Result: 在相同参数预算下，FACT-GS能够恢复更清晰的高频细节，同时保持实时渲染性能。基于2D高斯泼溅构建，实现了更高效的纹理空间利用。

Conclusion: FACT-GS通过频率对齐的自适应采样策略，显著提升了纹理高斯泼溅的表达能力，在保持实时性能的同时改善了高频细节的渲染质量。

Abstract: Realistic scene appearance modeling has advanced rapidly with Gaussian Splatting, which enables real-time, high-quality rendering. Recent advances introduced per-primitive textures that incorporate spatial color variations within each Gaussian, improving their expressiveness. However, texture-based Gaussians parameterize appearance with a uniform per-Gaussian sampling grid, allocating equal sampling density regardless of local visual complexity. This leads to inefficient texture space utilization, where high-frequency regions are under-sampled and smooth regions waste capacity, causing blurred appearance and loss of fine structural detail. We introduce FACT-GS, a Frequency-Aligned Complexity-aware Texture Gaussian Splatting framework that allocates texture sampling density according to local visual frequency. Grounded in adaptive sampling theory, FACT-GS reformulates texture parameterization as a differentiable sampling-density allocation problem, replacing the uniform textures with a learnable frequency-aware allocation strategy implemented via a deformation field whose Jacobian modulates local sampling density. Built on 2D Gaussian Splatting, FACT-GS performs non-uniform sampling on fixed-resolution texture grids, preserving real-time performance while recovering sharper high-frequency details under the same parameter budget.

Abstract: Basic phenomenology of human color vision has been widely taken as an inspiration to devise explicit color correction algorithms. The behavior of these models in terms of significative image features (such as contrast and dispersion) can be difficult to characterize. To cope with this, we propose to use a variational formulation of color contrast enhancement that is inspired by the basic phenomenology of color perception. In particular, we devise a set of basic requirements to be fulfilled by an energy to be considered as `perceptually inspired', showing that there is an explicit class of functionals satisfying all of them. We single out three explicit functionals that we consider of basic interest, showing similarities and differences with existing models. The minima of such functionals is computed using a gradient descent approach. We also present a general methodology to reduce the computational cost of the algorithms under analysis from ${\cal O}(N^2)$ to ${\cal O}(N\log N)$, being $N$ the number of input pixels.

Abstract: Instruction-driven segmentation in remote sensing generates masks from guidance, offering great potential for accessible and generalizable applications. However, existing methods suffer from fragmented task formulations and limited instruction data, hindering effective understanding and generalization. To address these issues, we introduce GeoSeg-1M, the first million-scale dataset for remote sensing instruction-driven segmentation, constructed via an automatic mask filtering and instruction generation pipeline that synthesizes referring, interactive, and reasoning segmentation instructions from multiple public datasets. GeoSeg-1M contains 590K images, 117 categories, and 1.1M image-mask-instruction triplets. Building upon this foundation, we further curate GeoSeg-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities across diverse instruction-driven tasks and complex geospatial scenes. Furthermore, we present UniGeoSeg, a unified framework that serves as a strong baseline, incorporating task-aware text enhancement, latent knowledge memory, and a progressive training strategy to facilitate multi-task learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of UniGeoSeg across GeoSeg-Bench and diverse public benchmarks, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization.

TL;DR: 提出Markov-VAR模型，通过马尔可夫尺度预测替代全上下文依赖，在保持性能的同时大幅提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAR模型的全上下文依赖导致计算效率低下和内存开销巨大，严重阻碍了其实用性和可扩展性，需要开发性能更好、效率更高的非全上下文依赖VAR模型

Method: 将VAR重新表述为非全上下文马尔可夫过程，提出Markov-VAR。通过马尔可夫尺度预测：将每个尺度视为马尔可夫状态，引入滑动窗口将某些先前尺度压缩为紧凑的历史向量，以补偿因非全上下文依赖造成的历史信息损失。将历史向量与马尔可夫状态结合形成代表性动态状态，在马尔可夫过程中演化

Result: 在ImageNet上，Markov-VAR相比VAR将FID降低了10.5%（256×256），峰值内存消耗减少了83.8%（1024×1024）。模型极其简单但非常有效

Conclusion: Markov-VAR可以作为未来视觉自回归生成和其他下游任务研究的基础，解决了VAR模型的计算效率问题

Abstract: Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) based on next-scale prediction has revitalized autoregressive visual generation. Although its full-context dependency, i.e., modeling all previous scales for next-scale prediction, facilitates more stable and comprehensive representation learning by leveraging complete information flow, the resulting computational inefficiency and substantial overhead severely hinder VAR's practicality and scalability. This motivates us to develop a new VAR model with better performance and efficiency without full-context dependency. To address this, we reformulate VAR as a non-full-context Markov process, proposing Markov-VAR. It is achieved via Markovian Scale Prediction: we treat each scale as a Markov state and introduce a sliding window that compresses certain previous scales into a compact history vector to compensate for historical information loss owing to non-full-context dependency. Integrating the history vector with the Markov state yields a representative dynamic state that evolves under a Markov process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Markov-VAR is extremely simple yet highly effective: Compared to VAR on ImageNet, Markov-VAR reduces FID by 10.5% (256 $\times$ 256) and decreases peak memory consumption by 83.8% (1024 $\times$ 1024). We believe that Markov-VAR can serve as a foundation for future research on visual autoregressive generation and other downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流生成模型存在采样效率问题：Rectified Flow需要多次计算密集的reflow迭代才能实现直线路径，MeanFlow在高度弯曲的流上训练时收敛慢且监督噪声大。

Method: 提出Rectified MeanFlow框架：1) 仅使用单次reflow步骤建模整流轨迹上的平均速度场；2) 引入简单的截断启发式方法减少残余曲率；3) 无需完美直线轨迹即可实现高效训练。

Result: 在ImageNet 64×64、256×256和512×512分辨率上的实验表明，Re-MeanFlow在样本质量和训练效率方面均优于先前的单步流蒸馏和Rectified Flow方法。

Conclusion: Rectified MeanFlow通过结合整流轨迹和平均速度建模的优势，实现了高效的单步生成，解决了现有方法的收敛和效率问题，为流生成模型提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently demonstrated strong performance, yet sampling typically relies on expensive numerical integration of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Rectified Flow enables one-step sampling by learning nearly straight probability paths, but achieving such straightness requires multiple computationally intensive reflow iterations. MeanFlow achieves one-step generation by directly modeling the average velocity over time; however, when trained on highly curved flows, it suffers from slow convergence and noisy supervision. To address these limitations, we propose Rectified MeanFlow, a framework that models the mean velocity field along the rectified trajectory using only a single reflow step. This eliminates the need for perfectly straightened trajectories while enabling efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet effective truncation heuristic that aims to reduce residual curvature and further improve performance. Extensive experiments on ImageNet at 64, 256, and 512 resolutions show that Re-MeanFlow consistently outperforms prior one-step flow distillation and Rectified Flow methods in both sample quality and training efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/Xinxi-Zhang/Re-MeanFlow.

Abstract: In many low-resource healthcare settings, bedside monitors remain standalone legacy devices without network connectivity, creating a persistent interoperability gap that prevents seamless integration of physiological data into electronic health record (EHR) systems. To address this challenge without requiring costly hardware replacement, we present a computer vision-based pipeline for the automated capture and digitisation of vital sign data directly from bedside monitor screens. Our method employs a hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for accurate monitor and region of interest (ROI) localisation with PaddleOCR for robust text extraction. To enhance reliability across variable camera angles and lighting conditions, a geometric rectification module standardizes the screen perspective before character recognition. We evaluated the system on a dataset of 6,498 images collected from open-source corpora and real-world intensive care units in Vietnam. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50-95) of 99.5% for monitor detection and 91.5% for vital sign ROI localisation. The end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeded 98.9% for core physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation SpO2, and arterial blood pressure. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, camera-based approach can reliably transform unstructured information from screen captures into structured digital data, providing a practical and scalable pathway to improve information accessibility and clinical documentation in low-resource settings.

Abstract: Achieving fully autonomous driving systems requires learning rational decisions in a wide span of scenarios, including safety-critical and out-of-distribution ones. However, such cases are underrepresented in real-world corpus collected by human experts. To complement for the lack of data diversity, we introduce a novel and scalable simulation framework capable of synthesizing massive unseen states upon existing driving logs. Our pipeline utilizes advanced neural rendering with a reactive environment to generate high-fidelity multi-view observations controlled by the perturbed ego trajectory. Furthermore, we develop a pseudo-expert trajectory generation mechanism for these newly simulated states to provide action supervision. Upon the synthesized data, we find that a simple co-training strategy on both real-world and simulated samples can lead to significant improvements in both robustness and generalization for various planning methods on challenging real-world benchmarks, up to +6.8 EPDMS on navhard and +2.9 on navtest. More importantly, such policy improvement scales smoothly by increasing simulation data only, even without extra real-world data streaming in. We further reveal several crucial findings of such a sim-real learning system, which we term SimScale, including the design of pseudo-experts and the scaling properties for different policy architectures. Our simulation data and code would be released.

Conclusion: DEAL-300K数据集和提出的定位框架为扩散图像编辑区域定位研究提供了实用基础，解决了现有基准的局限性

Abstract: Diffusion-based image editing has made semantic level image manipulation easy for general users, but it also enables realistic local forgeries that are hard to localize. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on the binary detection of generated images or the localization of manually edited regions and do not reflect the properties of diffusion-based edits, which often blend smoothly into the original content. We present Diffusion-Based Image Editing Area Localization Dataset (DEAL-300K), a large scale dataset for diffusion-based image manipulation localization (DIML) with more than 300,000 annotated images. We build DEAL-300K by using a multi-modal large language model to generate editing instructions, a mask-free diffusion editor to produce manipulated images, and an active-learning change detection pipeline to obtain pixel-level annotations. On top of this dataset, we propose a localization framework that uses a frozen Visual Foundation Model (VFM) together with Multi Frequency Prompt Tuning (MFPT) to capture both semantic and frequency-domain cues of edited regions. Trained on DEAL-300K, our method reaches a pixel-level F1 score of 82.56% on our test split and 80.97% on the external CoCoGlide benchmark, providing strong baselines and a practical foundation for future DIML research.The dataset can be accessed via https://github.com/ymhzyj/DEAL-300K.

TL;DR: VQRAE提出了一种统一的视觉表示方法，通过向量量化自编码器同时生成用于理解的连续语义特征和用于生成的离散标记，解决了多模态统一表示的关键挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态统一模型面临的关键挑战是如何在单个标记器中统一理解、生成和重建表示。先前研究多采用双编码器范式，分别处理理解和生成，或通过对比损失平衡语义表示和低级特征，缺乏真正的统一表示方法。

Method: VQRAE基于预训练视觉基础模型构建，采用对称ViT解码器。采用两阶段训练策略：1）冻结编码器，通过像素重建目标学习高维语义VQ码本；2）联合优化编码器并加入自蒸馏约束。该方法量化语义编码器时使用高维码本（1536维），而非传统图像重建中的低维码本。

Result: VQRAE在多个视觉理解、生成和重建基准测试中表现出竞争力。语义VQ码本在1536维时能达到100%利用率，在自回归范式中展现出良好的扩展性，离散标记适合生成任务。

Conclusion: VQRAE首次探索了统一表示方法，能在单个标记器中同时产生用于理解的连续语义特征和用于生成的离散标记，为构建统一的多模态模型提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Unifying multimodal understanding, generation and reconstruction representation in a single tokenizer remains a key challenge in building unified models. Previous research predominantly attempts to address this in a dual encoder paradigm, e.g., utilizing the separate encoders for understanding and generation respectively or balancing semantic representations and low-level features with contrastive loss. In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer. Specifically, we build upon pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder and adopt a two-stage training strategy: first, it freezes the encoder and learns a high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction objective; then jointly optimizes the encoder with self-distillation constraints. This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction. Besides, we identify the intriguing property in quantizing semantic encoders that rely on high-dimensional codebook in contrast to the previous common practice of low-dimensional codebook in image reconstruction. The semantic VQ codebook can achieve a 100% utilization ratio at a dimension of 1536. VQRAE presents competitive performance on several benchmarks of visual understanding, generation and reconstruction with promising scaling property in the autoregressive paradigm for its discrete merits.

TL;DR: MANTA是一个物理信息的水下目标跟踪框架，通过双正对比学习和多阶段跟踪设计，解决了水下环境中的外观失真和跟踪漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下目标跟踪面临波长相关衰减和散射的挑战，这些物理效应在不同深度和水况下严重扭曲目标外观。现有基于陆地数据训练的跟踪器无法泛化到这些物理驱动的退化情况。

Method: 1. 提出双正对比学习策略，将时间一致性与Beer-Lambert增强相结合，生成对时间和水下失真都鲁棒的特征；2. 引入多阶段管道，通过基于运动的跟踪和物理信息的二次关联算法增强跟踪，该算法整合了几何一致性和外观相似性，用于遮挡和漂移下的重识别。

Result: 在四个水下基准测试（WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220）上，MANTA实现了最先进的性能，将Success AUC提高了高达6%，同时确保了稳定的长期泛化水下跟踪和高效的运行时间。

Conclusion: MANTA通过将表示学习与跟踪设计相结合，并引入物理信息增强，有效解决了水下目标跟踪中的挑战，为水下视觉任务提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Underwater object tracking is challenging due to wavelength dependent attenuation and scattering, which severely distort appearance across depths and water conditions. Existing trackers trained on terrestrial data fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations. We present MANTA, a physics-informed framework integrating representation learning with tracking design for underwater scenarios. We propose a dual-positive contrastive learning strategy coupling temporal consistency with Beer-Lambert augmentations to yield features robust to both temporal and underwater distortions. We further introduce a multi-stage pipeline augmenting motion-based tracking with a physics-informed secondary association algorithm that integrates geometric consistency and appearance similarity for re-identification under occlusion and drift. To complement standard IoU metrics, we propose Center-Scale Consistency (CSC) and Geometric Alignment Score (GAS) to assess geometric fidelity. Experiments on four underwater benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220) show that MANTA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Success AUC by up to 6 percent, while ensuring stable long-term generalized underwater tracking and efficient runtime.

TL;DR: DisMo提出了一种从原始视频数据学习抽象运动表示的新范式，通过图像空间重建目标实现运动与内容的解耦，支持开放世界的运动迁移和下游运动理解任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频和图像到视频模型缺乏将运动与内容分离的显式表示，限制了内容创作者的适用性。需要一种能够学习独立于外观、物体身份或姿态的通用运动表示方法。

Method: 提出DisMo范式，通过图像空间重建目标直接从原始视频数据学习抽象运动表示。该方法解耦运动语义与外观，可与任何现有视频生成器通过轻量适配器结合，实现开放世界的运动迁移。

Result: DisMo在多种运动迁移任务中表现有效，学习到的表示在下游运动理解任务中优于V-JEPA等最先进视频表示模型，在Something-Something v2和Jester基准测试中实现零样本动作分类的持续领先。

Conclusion: DisMo提供了一种学习通用运动表示的新方法，成功解耦运动与内容，支持开放世界运动迁移，并能与现有视频生成器无缝集成，为未来视频模型发展提供了灵活基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, have enabled the creation of visually compelling and dynamic videos from simple textual descriptions or initial frames. However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

TL;DR: Hunyuan-GameCraft-2是一个指令驱动的交互式游戏世界生成模型，通过自然语言、键盘或鼠标信号控制游戏视频内容，实现灵活语义丰富的交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式世界模型受限于固定的动作模式和标注成本，难以建模多样化的游戏交互和玩家驱动动态。需要更灵活、低成本的交互方式。

Method: 1) 定义交互视频数据概念并开发自动化流程，将大规模非结构化文本-视频对转换为因果对齐的交互数据集；2) 基于14B图像到视频的混合专家基础模型，加入文本驱动的交互注入机制，精细控制相机运动、角色行为和环境动态。

Conclusion: Hunyuan-GameCraft-2通过指令驱动的交互范式，突破了传统固定动作模式的限制，实现了更灵活、语义丰富的游戏世界生成和交互控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative world models have enabled remarkable progress in creating open-ended game environments, evolving from static scene synthesis toward dynamic, interactive simulation. However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as "open the door", "draw a torch", or "trigger an explosion".

Method: 引入物体中心数据设置，系统评估四种数据合成方法：基于简单图像处理技术、3D渲染和图像扩散模型。这些方法利用物体中心数据合成具有不同上下文连贯性和复杂度的真实杂乱图像

Result: 在数据受限的实验设置中，这些方法显著提升了模型性能，实现了在真实世界数据中的类别级泛化能力

Conclusion: 通过物体中心数据合成方法可以有效扩展物体检测模型对新类别的检测能力，在数据有限的情况下实现显著的性能提升

Abstract: Deep learning approaches to object detection have achieved reliable detection of specific object classes in images. However, extending a model's detection capability to new object classes requires large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire, especially for long-tailed classes with insufficient representation in existing datasets. Here, we introduce the object-centric data setting, when limited data is available in the form of object-centric data (multi-view images or 3D models), and systematically evaluate the performance of four different data synthesis methods to finetune object detection models on novel object categories in this setting. The approaches are based on simple image processing techniques, 3D rendering, and image diffusion models, and use object-centric data to synthesize realistic, cluttered images with varying contextual coherence and complexity. We assess how these methods enable models to achieve category-level generalization in real-world data, and demonstrate significant performance boosts within this data-constrained experimental setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在跨模态理解方面表现出色，但其视觉生成潜力尚未充分探索。现有方法需要大量对齐成本和收敛时间，需要更高效的视觉生成方案

Method: 提出VGT-AE架构，将预训练VLM的语义编码器与像素解码器的潜在表示对齐，摒弃了传统像素级VAE的纠缠设计，实现20倍加速收敛

Result: 图像重建：28倍压缩比下PSNR 26.67，rFID 0.50，超越专用VAE；视觉生成：GenEval 0.77，DPG-Bench 78.73，在自回归模型中达到SOTA

Conclusion: VGT展示了显著的扩展潜力，能够为任何多模态理解训练的VLM赋予视觉生成能力，为探索下一代统一多模态基础模型开辟了新途径

Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) effectively bridge the modality gap through extensive pretraining, acquiring sophisticated visual representations aligned with language. However, it remains underexplored whether these representations, optimized for multimodal understanding tasks, harbor an inherent potential for visual generation. In this paper, we propose VGT, Visual Generation Tuning, a novel paradigm designed to stimulate the underlying capabilities of visual generation within any vision language models. By performing efficient visual generation tuning on well-pretrained VLMs, we significantly mitigate the alignment costs and accelerate the convergence of autoregressive modeling in the continuous space (20x speedup). Specifically, we dismiss the entangled pixel-level VAEs designed for diffusion transformers and formulate VGT-AE through aligning the semantic encoders from pretrained VLMs with the latent representations of pixel decoders. In image reconstruction tasks, we achieve 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at a 28x compression ratio, outperforming specialized VAEs; in visual generation tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art outcomes among autoregressive models, 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench. Furthermore, our proposed VGT showcases significant scaling promise and is versatile for endowing any VLMs trained for multimodal understanding with the capabilities of visual generation, which paves the new avenue to explore next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

Conclusion: AnyTalker通过创新的架构设计和高效训练策略，成功解决了多人视频生成中的数据成本和交互性挑战，为多人说话视频生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Recently, multi-person video generation has started to gain prominence. While a few preliminary works have explored audio-driven multi-person talking video generation, they often face challenges due to the high costs of diverse multi-person data collection and the difficulty of driving multiple identities with coherent interactivity. To address these challenges, we propose AnyTalker, a multi-person generation framework that features an extensible multi-stream processing architecture. Specifically, we extend Diffusion Transformer's attention block with a novel identity-aware attention mechanism that iteratively processes identity-audio pairs, allowing arbitrary scaling of drivable identities. Besides, training multi-person generative models demands massive multi-person data. Our proposed training pipeline depends solely on single-person videos to learn multi-person speaking patterns and refines interactivity with only a few real multi-person clips. Furthermore, we contribute a targeted metric and dataset designed to evaluate the naturalness and interactivity of the generated multi-person videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyTalker achieves remarkable lip synchronization, visual quality, and natural interactivity, striking a favorable balance between data costs and identity scalability.

TL;DR: Video CoM提出交互式视频推理新范式，让模型通过视觉操作链主动"思考视频"，而非被动处理静态视觉上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs将视频编码后仅在文本空间推理，无法重看、聚焦或验证证据，导致时空细粒度理解任务上的浅层视觉推理。需要打破这种被动范式。

Method: 1) 提出交互式视频推理范式，将视频作为主动认知工作空间；2) 开发Video CoM模型，通过操作链(CoM)迭代执行视觉动作收集和精炼证据；3) 构建18K指令调优数据集Video CoM Instruct；4) 使用推理感知的组相对策略优化(GRPO)进行强化学习，引入步骤级推理奖励。

Result: 在九个视频推理基准上取得显著提升，平均性能比SOTA模型提高3.6%，仅使用25K SFT和3K GRPO视频样本，远少于可比大规模模型。消融研究显示推理感知奖励提升准确性和可解释性。

Conclusion: 交互式视频推理范式突破了传统MLLMs的语义瓶颈，通过主动视觉操作实现更深入、更可靠的视频理解，为视频AI开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced video understanding, yet most still "think about videos" ie once a video is encoded, reasoning unfolds entirely in text, treating visual input as a static context. This passive paradigm creates a semantic bottleneck: models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine grained spatio temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to "think with videos". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability. Code: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-CoM

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在动态视觉内容推理中存在逻辑不一致和视觉证据弱的问题，模型往往生成看似合理但实际依赖语言先验而非视觉内容的推理轨迹。

Method: 提出两阶段后训练方法：1) 时间感知监督微调；2) 基于时序对齐奖励(TAR)的组相对策略优化(GRPO)，增强时序精度和推理一致性。

Result: Video R2模型在11个视频推理基准测试中，在TAC、VAS和准确率指标上均取得显著提升，证明时序对齐和推理一致性改进能带来更准确可靠的视频理解。

Conclusion: 通过强化学习提升时序对齐和推理一致性是改善多模态模型视频理解能力的关键，Video R2展示了这种方法在提升准确性和可信度方面的有效性。

Abstract: Reasoning over dynamic visual content remains a central challenge for multimodal large language models. Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced.

Motivation: 研究木星大气动力学需要高分辨率、光度校准的观测数据。JunoCam虽然提供9年高分辨率数据，但缺乏绝对光度校准，阻碍定量分析。需要利用HST作为校准参考来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SP-I2I（结构保持图像转换）方法，采用无配对图像转换技术，特别加入显式频域约束来保持高频特征，解决JunoCam和HST之间的分辨率差异问题。

Result: 现有最先进的无配对图像转换方法无法解决此问题，而SP-I2I方法能有效保持精细空间结构，对遥感数据全色锐化任务有更广泛影响。

Conclusion: SP-I2I方法成功解决了JunoCam缺乏光度校准的问题，为木星大气动力学研究提供了定量分析工具，并在遥感图像处理领域具有更广泛的应用价值。

Abstract: Insights into Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics are vital for understanding planetary meteorology and exoplanetary gas giant atmospheres. To study these dynamics, we require high-resolution, photometrically calibrated observations. Over the last 9 years, the Juno spacecraft's optical camera, JunoCam, has generated a unique dataset with high spatial resolution, wide coverage during perijove passes, and a long baseline. However, JunoCam lacks absolute photometric calibration, hindering quantitative analysis of the Jovian atmosphere. Using observations from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) as a proxy for a calibrated sensor, we present a novel method for performing unpaired image-to-image translation (I2I) between JunoCam and HST, focusing on addressing the resolution discrepancy between the two sensors. Our structure-preserving I2I method, SP-I2I, incorporates explicit frequency-space constraints designed to preserve high-frequency features ensuring the retention of fine, small-scale spatial structures - essential for studying Jupiter's atmosphere. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art unpaired image-to-image translation methods are inadequate to address this problem, and, importantly, we show the broader impact of our proposed solution on relevant remote sensing data for the pansharpening task.

Motivation: 大规模地形生成在计算机图形学中仍然是劳动密集型任务，需要一种能够根据数字高程模型生成逼真地形纹理的方法，同时保持高程一致性。

Method: 提出Geodiffussr流匹配管道，采用多尺度内容聚合机制，将预训练编码器提取的DEM特征注入到UNet块的不同分辨率中，实现从全局到局部的高程一致性约束。

Result: 相比非MCA基线，MCA显著改善了视觉保真度，增强了高度-外观耦合（FID降低49.16%，LPIPS降低32.33%，ΔdCor降至0.0016）。

Conclusion: Geodiffussr为可控的2.5D景观生成提供了强有力的基线，适用于粗尺度构思和预可视化，可作为基于物理的地形和生态系统模拟器的补充工具。

Abstract: Large-scale terrain generation remains a labor-intensive task in computer graphics. We introduce Geodiffussr, a flow-matching pipeline that synthesizes text-guided texture maps while strictly adhering to a supplied Digital Elevation Map (DEM). The core mechanism is multi-scale content aggregation (MCA): DEM features from a pretrained encoder are injected into UNet blocks at multiple resolutions to enforce global-to-local elevation consistency. Compared with a non-MCA baseline, MCA markedly improves visual fidelity and strengthens height-appearance coupling (FID $\downarrow$ 49.16%, LPIPS $\downarrow$ 32.33%, $Δ$dCor $\downarrow$ to 0.0016). To train and evaluate Geodiffussr, we assemble a globally distributed, biome- and climate-stratified corpus of triplets pairing SRTM-derived DEMs with Sentinel-2 imagery and vision-grounded natural-language captions that describe visible land cover. We position Geodiffussr as a strong baseline and step toward controllable 2.5D landscape generation for coarse-scale ideation and previz, complementary to physically based terrain and ecosystem simulators.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在医疗领域的对齐技术使用通用的伤害定义，无法捕捉情境依赖的违规行为（如行政欺诈、临床歧视），需要针对具体医疗系统的安全范式。

Method: 创建Medical Malice数据集，包含214,219个对抗性提示，涵盖7个分类（采购操纵、插队、产科暴力等），使用未对齐的Grok-4代理通过角色驱动流程合成高保真威胁，并包含违规背后的推理过程。

Result: 开发了针对巴西统一医疗系统（SUS）的对抗性数据集，包含详细的违规推理，使模型能够内化伦理边界而非仅记忆固定拒绝模式。

Conclusion: 需要从通用安全转向情境感知安全，为医疗AI提供必要资源以抵御高风险医疗环境中的系统性威胁，这些漏洞是患者安全和AI成功整合的最大风险。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into healthcare demands a safety paradigm rooted in \textit{primum non nocere}. However, current alignment techniques rely on generic definitions of harm that fail to capture context-dependent violations, such as administrative fraud and clinical discrimination. To address this, we introduce Medical Malice: a dataset of 214,219 adversarial prompts calibrated to the regulatory and ethical complexities of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Crucially, the dataset includes the reasoning behind each violation, enabling models to internalize ethical boundaries rather than merely memorizing a fixed set of refusals. Using an unaligned agent (Grok-4) within a persona-driven pipeline, we synthesized high-fidelity threats across seven taxonomies, ranging from procurement manipulation and queue-jumping to obstetric violence. We discuss the ethical design of releasing these "vulnerability signatures" to correct the information asymmetry between malicious actors and AI developers. Ultimately, this work advocates for a shift from universal to context-aware safety, providing the necessary resources to immunize healthcare AI against the nuanced, systemic threats inherent to high-stakes medical environments -- vulnerabilities that represent the paramount risk to patient safety and the successful integration of AI in healthcare systems.

Abstract: Studying how embeddings are organized in space not only enhances model interpretability but also uncovers factors that drive downstream task performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of topological and geometric measures across a wide set of text embedding models and datasets. We find a high degree of redundancy among these measures and observe that individual metrics often fail to sufficiently differentiate embedding spaces. Building on these insights, we introduce Unified Topological Signatures (UTS), a holistic framework for characterizing embedding spaces. We show that UTS can predict model-specific properties and reveal similarities driven by model architecture. Further, we demonstrate the utility of our method by linking topological structure to ranking effectiveness and accurately predicting document retrievability. We find that a holistic, multi-attribute perspective is essential to understanding and leveraging the geometry of text embeddings.

TL;DR: 本文提出SuRe（基于惊喜的优先级回放）和双学习器设计，用于解决大语言模型持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，在标准CL和LNT基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习是机器学习和人类智能之间的关键差距。虽然正则化和回放在视觉任务中表现良好，但在大语言模型的多任务学习中表现不佳，特别是在任务数量多的场景下。本文旨在解决回放方法中的两个失败模式：选择（回放什么）和整合（如何整合新知识）。

Method: 1. SuRe（基于惊喜的优先级回放）：使用负对数似然作为惊喜度量，优先存储和回放最令人惊讶的序列；2. 双学习器设计：包含快速和慢速LoRA适配器，通过指数移动平均合并，实现快速适应同时稳定长期知识。

Result: SuRe在LNT（大量任务）设置中达到SOTA性能，在标准CL和LNT基准测试中平均表现最佳。结合双学习器设计后，在LNT上比之前SOTA提升高达+5个准确率点。消融研究证实该方法在减少回放频率和小缓冲区下仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 回放方法可作为大语言模型持续微调的强基线，基于惊喜的选择和慢权重整合是缓解灾难性遗忘的互补组件，为持续学习提供了有效且样本高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning, one's ability to adapt to a sequence of tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge, remains a major challenge in machine learning and a key gap between artificial and human intelligence. While regularisation and replay perform well in vision, they lag behind multi-task learning for large language models (LLMs), especially at scale with many tasks. We revisit replay and argue that two failure modes drive this gap: selection (what to rehearse) and integration (how to consolidate new knowledge). To address selection, we propose Surprise-prioritised Replay (SuRe), a simple, architecture-agnostic rule that ranks and stores the most surprising (high Negative Log-Likelihood) sequences. SuRe achieves state-of-the-art performance in the Large Number of Tasks (LNT) setting and delivers the best overall average across both Standard CL and LNT benchmarks. To address integration, we add a dual-learner design with fast and slow LoRA adapters merged via an exponential moving average (EMA), enabling rapid adaptation while stabilising long-term knowledge. Combining SuRe with the dual learner yields further gains, including improvements of up to +5 accuracy points on LNT over prior SOTA. Ablation studies confirm that our proposed method remains robust under reduced replay frequency and small buffer size, demonstrating both effectiveness and sample efficiency. Taken together, our results establish replay as a strong baseline for continual LLM fine-tuning and demonstrate that surprise-based selection and slow-weight consolidation are complementary components for mitigating catastrophic forgetting.

TL;DR: INN提出智能神经元网络，将神经元作为具有内部记忆和学习通信模式的一等实体，通过图结构而非层级组织实现涌现计算，在Text8基准上优于Transformer，匹配LSTM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物神经元智能特性（维持内部状态、选择性通信、自组织成复杂图结构）启发，探索能否从类似智能计算单元中涌现人工智能，提出神经元中心设计新范式。

Method: 引入智能神经网络（INN）：每个智能神经元结合选择性状态空间动态（知道何时激活）和基于注意力的路由（知道向谁发送信号），在完全图而非顺序层中组织，实现图结构交互的涌现计算。

Result: 在Text8字符建模基准上，INN达到1.705 BPC，显著优于可比较的Transformer（2.055 BPC），匹配高度优化的LSTM基线。参数匹配的堆叠Mamba块基线无法收敛（>3.4 BPC），证明INN图拓扑提供关键训练稳定性。消融研究证实移除神经元间通信会降低性能或不稳定。

Conclusion: 神经元中心设计与图组织不仅是受生物启发，更是计算有效的，为模块化、可解释和可扩展的神经架构开辟新方向。

Abstract: Biological neurons exhibit remarkable intelligence: they maintain internal states, communicate selectively with other neurons, and self-organize into complex graphs rather than rigid hierarchical layers. What if artificial intelligence could emerge from similarly intelligent computational units? We introduce Intelligent Neural Networks (INN), a paradigm shift where neurons are first-class entities with internal memory and learned communication patterns, organized in complete graphs rather than sequential layers.
  Each Intelligent Neuron combines selective state-space dynamics (knowing when to activate) with attention-based routing (knowing to whom to send signals), enabling emergent computation through graph-structured interactions. On the standard Text8 character modeling benchmark, INN achieves 1.705 Bit-Per-Character (BPC), significantly outperforming a comparable Transformer (2.055 BPC) and matching a highly optimized LSTM baseline. Crucially, a parameter-matched baseline of stacked Mamba blocks fails to converge (>3.4 BPC) under the same training protocol, demonstrating that INN's graph topology provides essential training stability. Ablation studies confirm this: removing inter-neuron communication degrades performance or leads to instability, proving the value of learned neural routing.
  This work demonstrates that neuron-centric design with graph organization is not merely bio-inspired -- it is computationally effective, opening new directions for modular, interpretable, and scalable neural architectures.

Abstract: Multi-aspect sentiment analysis of Bangla e-commerce reviews remains challenging due to limited annotated datasets, morphological complexity, code-mixing phenomena, and domain shift issues, affecting 300 million Bangla-speaking users. Existing approaches lack explainability and cross-domain generalization capabilities crucial for practical deployment. We present BanglaSentNet, an explainable hybrid deep learning framework integrating LSTM, BiLSTM, GRU, and BanglaBERT through dynamic weighted ensemble learning for multi-aspect sentiment classification. We introduce a dataset of 8,755 manually annotated Bangla product reviews across four aspects (Quality, Service, Price, Decoration) from major Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms. Our framework incorporates SHAP-based feature attribution and attention visualization for transparent insights. BanglaSentNet achieves 85% accuracy and 0.88 F1-score, outperforming standalone deep learning models by 3-7% and traditional approaches substantially. The explainability suite achieves 9.4/10 interpretability score with 87.6% human agreement. Cross-domain transfer learning experiments reveal robust generalization: zero-shot performance retains 67-76% effectiveness across diverse domains (BanglaBook reviews, social media, general e-commerce, news headlines); few-shot learning with 500-1000 samples achieves 90-95% of full fine-tuning performance, significantly reducing annotation costs. Real-world deployment demonstrates practical utility for Bangladeshi e-commerce platforms, enabling data-driven decision-making for pricing optimization, service improvement, and customer experience enhancement. This research establishes a new state-of-the-art benchmark for Bangla sentiment analysis, advances ensemble learning methodologies for low-resource languages, and provides actionable solutions for commercial applications.

Abstract: The expansion of the Internet and social networks has led to an explosion of user-generated content. Author intent understanding plays a crucial role in interpreting social media content. This paper addresses author intent classification in Bangla social media posts by leveraging both textual and visual data. Recognizing limitations in previous unimodal approaches, we systematically benchmark transformer-based language models (mBERT, DistilBERT, XLM-RoBERTa) and vision architectures (ViT, Swin, SwiftFormer, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet), utilizing the Uddessho dataset of 3,048 posts spanning six practical intent categories. We introduce a novel intermediate fusion strategy that significantly outperforms early and late fusion on this task. Experimental results show that intermediate fusion, particularly with mBERT and Swin Transformer, achieves 84.11% macro-F1 score, establishing a new state-of-the-art with an 8.4 percentage-point improvement over prior Bangla multimodal approaches. Our analysis demonstrates that integrating visual context substantially enhances intent classification. Cross-modal feature integration at intermediate levels provides optimal balance between modality-specific representation and cross-modal learning. This research establishes new benchmarks and methodological standards for Bangla and other low-resource languages. We call our proposed framework BangACMM (Bangla Author Content MultiModal).

TL;DR: ThetaEvolve是一个开源框架，简化并扩展了AlphaEvolve，通过上下文学习和强化学习在测试时持续学习，使小型开源模型能在开放优化问题上取得新的最佳边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AlphaEvolve虽然取得了数学发现上的突破，但它是闭源系统，依赖前沿LLM集成，且是纯推理系统无法内化演化策略。需要开源框架让小型模型也能在开放问题上取得突破。

Method: ThetaEvolve采用单个LLM、大型程序数据库增强探索、批量采样提高吞吐量、惰性惩罚避免停滞输出、可选奖励塑形提供稳定训练信号，支持测试时上下文学习和强化学习。

Result: ThetaEvolve首次让小型开源模型（如DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B）在AlphaEvolve提到的开放问题（圆填充和自相关不等式）上取得新的最佳边界。在两个模型和四个开放任务中，测试时强化学习始终优于纯推理基线。

Conclusion: ThetaEvolve是一个有效的开源演化框架，使小型模型能够通过持续学习在开放优化问题上取得突破，模型确实学习了演化能力，在训练任务和未见任务上都表现出更好的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in mathematical discovery, exemplified by AlphaEvolve, a closed-source system that evolves programs to improve bounds on open problems. However, it relies on ensembles of frontier LLMs to achieve new bounds and is a pure inference system that models cannot internalize the evolving strategies. We introduce ThetaEvolve, an open-source framework that simplifies and extends AlphaEvolve to efficiently scale both in-context learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) at test time, allowing models to continually learn from their experiences in improving open optimization problems. ThetaEvolve features a single LLM, a large program database for enhanced exploration, batch sampling for higher throughput, lazy penalties to discourage stagnant outputs, and optional reward shaping for stable training signals, etc. ThetaEvolve is the first evolving framework that enable a small open-source model, like DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, to achieve new best-known bounds on open problems (circle packing and first auto-correlation inequality) mentioned in AlphaEvolve. Besides, across two models and four open tasks, we find that ThetaEvolve with RL at test-time consistently outperforms inference-only baselines, and the model indeed learns evolving capabilities, as the RL-trained checkpoints demonstrate faster progress and better final performance on both trained target task and other unseen tasks. We release our code publicly: https://github.com/ypwang61/ThetaEvolve

Motivation: 当前自回归变换器存在开环瓶颈：隐藏状态一次性计算且无法修正，导致错误在序列中传播，造成长程推理、事实一致性和多步规划等失败

Method: 提出均衡变换器(EqT)，在标准变换器层中加入均衡优化模块，通过梯度下降最小化学到的能量函数，实现潜在表示的迭代优化

Conclusion: 闭环均衡机制可能解决开环自回归的承诺瓶颈，正如注意力机制解决了循环网络的序列瓶颈，代表了向语言模型发展的基础性一步

Abstract: Contemporary autoregressive transformers operate in open loop: each hidden state is computed in a single forward pass and never revised, causing errors to propagate uncorrected through the sequence. We identify this open-loop bottleneck as a fundamental architectural limitation underlying well-documented failures in long-range reasoning, factual consistency, and multi-step planning. To address this limitation, we introduce the closed-loop prediction principle, which requires that models iteratively refine latent representations until reaching a self-consistent equilibrium before committing to each token. We instantiate this principle as Equilibrium Transformers (EqT), which augment standard transformer layers with an Equilibrium Refinement Module that minimizes a learned energy function via gradient descent in latent space. The energy function enforces bidirectional prediction consistency, episodic memory coherence, and output confidence, all computed without external supervision. Theoretically, we prove that EqT performs approximate MAP inference in a latent energy-based model, establish linear convergence guarantees, and show that refinement improves predictions precisely on hard instances where one-shot inference is suboptimal. The framework unifies deep equilibrium models, diffusion language models, and test-time training as special cases. Preliminary experiments on the binary parity task demonstrate +3.28% average improvement on challenging sequences, with gains reaching +8.07% where standard transformers approach random performance, validating that the benefit of deliberation scales with task difficulty. Just as attention mechanisms resolved the sequential bottleneck of recurrent networks, we propose that closed-loop equilibrium may resolve the commitment bottleneck of open-loop autoregression, representing a foundational step toward language models.

Motivation: 现有后训练方法主要关注模型权重微调或蒸馏，本文探索通过优化采样时间表来释放预训练采样器的生成潜力

Method: 学习实例级（提示和噪声条件）采样时间表，使用单次Dirichlet策略，并引入基于James-Stein估计器的新奖励基线来确保高维策略学习中的准确梯度估计

Result: 重新调度的采样器在Stable Diffusion和Flux模型家族中一致提升文本图像对齐，包括文本渲染和组合控制；5步Flux-Dev采样器能达到与专门蒸馏采样器相当的质量

Conclusion: 提出了一种模型无关的后训练调度框架，能够解锁预训练采样器的额外生成潜力，作为传统权重调整方法的补充

Abstract: Most post-training methods for text-to-image samplers focus on model weights: either fine-tuning the backbone for alignment or distilling it for few-step efficiency. We take a different route: rescheduling the sampling timeline of a frozen sampler. Instead of a fixed, global schedule, we learn instance-level (prompt- and noise-conditioned) schedules through a single-pass Dirichlet policy. To ensure accurate gradient estimates in high-dimensional policy learning, we introduce a novel reward baseline based on a principled James-Stein estimator; it provably achieves lower estimation errors than commonly used variants and leads to superior performance. Our rescheduled samplers consistently improve text-image alignment including text rendering and compositional control across modern Stable Diffusion and Flux model families. Additionally, a 5-step Flux-Dev sampler with our schedules can attain generation quality comparable to deliberately distilled samplers like Flux-Schnell. We thus position our scheduling framework as an emerging model-agnostic post-training lever that unlocks additional generative potential in pretrained samplers.

Conclusion: 对抗流模型成功统一了对抗模型和流模型，提供了稳定高效的生成方法，在图像生成质量上达到新的最先进水平，同时减少了模型容量需求和训练复杂度。

Abstract: We present adversarial flow models, a class of generative models that unifies adversarial models and flow models. Our method supports native one-step or multi-step generation and is trained using the adversarial objective. Unlike traditional GANs, where the generator learns an arbitrary transport plan between the noise and the data distributions, our generator learns a deterministic noise-to-data mapping, which is the same optimal transport as in flow-matching models. This significantly stabilizes adversarial training. Also, unlike consistency-based methods, our model directly learns one-step or few-step generation without needing to learn the intermediate timesteps of the probability flow for propagation. This saves model capacity, reduces training iterations, and avoids error accumulation. Under the same 1NFE setting on ImageNet-256px, our B/2 model approaches the performance of consistency-based XL/2 models, while our XL/2 model creates a new best FID of 2.38. We additionally show the possibility of end-to-end training of 56-layer and 112-layer models through depth repetition without any intermediate supervision, and achieve FIDs of 2.08 and 1.94 using a single forward pass, surpassing their 2NFE and 4NFE counterparts.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enables online model adaptation using only unlabeled test data, aiming to bridge the gap between source and target distributions. However, in multimodal scenarios, varying degrees of distribution shift across different modalities give rise to a complex coupling effect of unimodal shallow feature shift and cross-modal high-level semantic misalignment, posing a major obstacle to extending existing TTA methods to the multimodal field. To address this challenge, we propose a novel multimodal test-time adaptation (MMTTA) framework, termed as Bridging Modalities via Progressive Re-alignment (BriMPR). BriMPR, consisting of two progressively enhanced modules, tackles the coupling effect with a divide-and-conquer strategy. Specifically, we first decompose MMTTA into multiple unimodal feature alignment sub-problems. By leveraging the strong function approximation ability of prompt tuning, we calibrate the unimodal global feature distributions to their respective source distributions, so as to achieve the initial semantic re-alignment across modalities. Subsequently, we assign the credible pseudo-labels to combinations of masked and complete modalities, and introduce inter-modal instance-wise contrastive learning to further enhance the information interaction among modalities and refine the alignment. Extensive experiments on MMTTA tasks, including both corruption-based and real-world domain shift benchmarks, demonstrate the superiority of our method.

Abstract: Scientific simulations and experimental measurements produce vast amounts of spatio-temporal data, yet extracting meaningful insights remains challenging due to high dimensionality, complex structures, and missing information. Traditional analysis methods often struggle with these issues, motivating the need for more robust, data-driven approaches. This dissertation explores deep learning methodologies to improve the analysis and visualization of spatio-temporal scientific ensembles, focusing on dimensionality reduction, flow estimation, and temporal interpolation. First, we address high-dimensional data representation through autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction for scientific ensembles. We evaluate the stability of projection metrics under partial labeling and introduce a Pareto-efficient selection strategy to identify optimal autoencoder variants, ensuring expressive and reliable low-dimensional embeddings. Next, we present FLINT, a deep learning model for high-quality flow estimation and temporal interpolation in both flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised settings. FLINT reconstructs missing velocity fields and generates high-fidelity temporal interpolants for scalar fields across 2D+time and 3D+time ensembles without domain-specific assumptions or extensive finetuning. To further improve adaptability and generalization, we introduce HyperFLINT, a hypernetwork-based approach that conditions on simulation parameters to estimate flow fields and interpolate scalar data. This parameter-aware adaptation yields more accurate reconstructions across diverse scientific domains, even with sparse or incomplete data. Overall, this dissertation advances deep learning techniques for scientific visualization, providing scalable, adaptable, and high-quality solutions for interpreting complex spatio-temporal ensembles.

Abstract: Inverse heat problems refer to the estimation of material thermophysical properties given observed or known heat diffusion behaviour. Inverse heat problems have wide-ranging uses, but a critical application lies in quantifying how building facade renovation reduces thermal transmittance, a key determinant of building energy efficiency. However, solving inverse heat problems with non-invasive data collected in situ is error-prone due to environmental variability or deviations from theoretically assumed conditions. Hence, current methods for measuring thermal conductivity are either invasive, require lengthy observation periods, or are sensitive to environmental and experimental conditions. Here, we present a PINN-based iterative framework to estimate the thermal conductivity k of a wall from a set of thermographs; our framework alternates between estimating the forward heat problem with a PINN for a fixed k, and optimizing k by comparing the thermographs and surface temperatures predicted by the PINN, repeating until the estimated k's convergence. Using both environmental data captured by a weather station and data generated from Finite-Volume-Method software simulations, we accurately predict k across different environmental conditions and data collection sampling times, given the temperature profile of the wall at dawn is close to steady state. Although violating the steady-state assumption impacts the accuracy of k's estimation, we show that our proposed framework still only exhibits a maximum MAE of 4.0851. Our work demonstrates the potential of PINN-based methods for reliable estimation of material properties in situ and under realistic conditions, without lengthy measurement campaigns. Given the lack of research on using machine learning, and more specifically on PINNs, for solving in-situ inverse problems, we expect our work to be a starting point for more research on the topic.

Abstract: Myofascial pain (MP) is a leading cause of chronic low back pain, yet its tissue-level drivers remain poorly defined and lack reliable image biomarkers. Existing studies focus predominantly on muscle while neglecting fascia, fat, and other soft tissues that play integral biomechanical roles. We developed an anatomically grounded explainable artificial intelligence (AI) framework, LAYER (Layer-wise Analysis for Yielding Explainable Relevance Tissue), that analyses six tissue layers in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound and quantifies their contribution to MP prediction. By utilizing the largest multi-model 3D ultrasound cohort consisting of over 4,000 scans, LAYER reveals that non-muscle tissues contribute substantially to pain prediction. In B-mode imaging, the deep fascial membrane (DFM) showed the highest saliency (0.420), while in combined B-mode and shear-wave images, the collective saliency of non-muscle layers (0.316) nearly matches that of muscle (0.317), challenging the conventional muscle-centric paradigm in MP research and potentially affecting the therapy methods. LAYER establishes a quantitative, interpretable framework for linking layer-specific anatomy to pain physiology, uncovering new tissue targets and providing a generalizable approach for explainable analysis of soft-tissue imaging.

### [325] [Comparing SAM 2 and SAM 3 for Zero-Shot Segmentation of 3D Medical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21926)
*Satrajit Chakrabarty,Ravi Soni*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: SAM 3在医学图像零样本分割中表现优于SAM 2，特别是在稀疏交互和复杂解剖结构任务中，可作为更优的默认选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然SAM系列模型在自然图像分割表现优异，但在医学数据上的行为特征研究不足。需要评估SAM 3能否作为SAM 2的直接替代品用于医学图像分割。

Method: 在16个公共数据集（CT、MRI、3D和超声、内窥镜）上对比SAM 2和SAM 3的零样本分割性能，涵盖54种解剖结构、病理和手术器械。使用四种提示模式：单点、多点、边界框和密集掩码，限制在第一帧进行标准化评估。

Result: SAM 3在点击提示初始化方面显著优于SAM 2，在复杂、血管和软组织解剖结构上保持优势。SAM 2仅在紧凑、刚性器官且空间引导强时保持竞争力，但在挑战性目标上经常失败。

Conclusion: SAM 3是大多数医学分割任务的更优默认选择，特别是在涉及稀疏用户交互或复杂解剖拓扑的任务中，可作为SAM 2的直接替代品。

Abstract: Foundation models for promptable segmentation, including SAM, SAM 2, and the recently released SAM 3, have renewed interest in zero-shot segmentation of medical imaging. Although these models perform strongly on natural images, their behavior on medical data remains insufficiently characterized. While SAM 2 is widely used for annotation in 3D medical workflows, SAM 3 introduces a new perception backbone, detector-tracker pipeline, and concept-level prompting that may alter its behavior under spatial prompts. We present the first controlled comparison of SAM 2 and SAM 3 for zero-shot segmentation of 3D medical volumes and videos under purely visual prompting, with concept mechanisms disabled. We assess whether SAM 3 can serve as an out-of-the-box replacement for SAM 2 without customization. We benchmark both models on 16 public datasets (CT, MRI, 3D and cine ultrasound, endoscopy) covering 54 anatomical structures, pathologies, and surgical instruments. Prompts are restricted to the first frame and use four modes: single-click, multi-click, bounding box, and dense mask. This design standardizes preprocessing, prompt placement, propagation rules, and metric computation to disentangle prompt interpretation from propagation. Prompt-frame analysis shows that SAM 3 provides substantially stronger initialization than SAM 2 for click prompting across most structures. In full-volume analysis, SAM 3 retains this advantage for complex, vascular, and soft-tissue anatomies, emerging as the more versatile general-purpose segmenter. While SAM 2 remains competitive for compact, rigid organs under strong spatial guidance, it frequently fails on challenging targets where SAM 3 succeeds. Overall, our results suggest that SAM 3 is the superior default choice for most medical segmentation tasks, particularly those involving sparse user interaction or complex anatomical topology.

TL;DR: 使用条件GAN从免费RGB卫星影像生成DEM，在山区表现良好但低地和居民区有限制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DEM生成方法（如LiDAR和摄影测量）需要特定数据，在资源受限地区难以获取。本研究旨在利用免费可得的RGB卫星影像生成DEM，为资源受限地区提供成本效益高的替代方案。

Method: 1) 构建包含12K对RGB-DEM数据的全球数据集（Landsat影像和NASA SRTM高程数据）；2) 实施独特的预处理流程筛选高质量无云区域；3) 采用两阶段训练：先在完整数据集上训练，然后基于SSIM值筛选高质量样本进行微调；4) 使用条件生成对抗网络（GAN）模型。

Result: 在山区表现良好，总体RMSE为0.4671，平均SSIM得分为0.2065（范围-1到1）。但在低地和居民区存在局限性，表明模型在不同地形上的泛化能力有限。

Conclusion: 该方法为传统DEM生成提供了成本效益高且适应性强的替代方案，强调了在生成建模中细致预处理和迭代优化的重要性，同时指出了在全球多样地形中泛化的挑战。

Abstract: Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are vital datasets for geospatial applications such as hydrological modeling and environmental monitoring. However, conventional methods to generate DEM, such as using LiDAR and photogrammetry, require specific types of data that are often inaccessible in resource-constrained settings. To alleviate this problem, this study proposes an approach to generate DEM from freely available RGB satellite imagery using generative deep learning, particularly based on a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We first developed a global dataset consisting of 12K RGB-DEM pairs using Landsat satellite imagery and NASA's SRTM digital elevation data, both from the year 2000. A unique preprocessing pipeline was implemented to select high-quality, cloud-free regions and aggregate normalized RGB composites from Landsat imagery. Additionally, the model was trained in a two-stage process, where it was first trained on the complete dataset and then fine-tuned on high-quality samples filtered by Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) values to improve performance on challenging terrains. The results demonstrate promising performance in mountainous regions, achieving an overall mean root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.4671 and a mean SSIM score of 0.2065 (scale -1 to 1), while highlighting limitations in lowland and residential areas. This study underscores the importance of meticulous preprocessing and iterative refinement in generative modeling for DEM generation, offering a cost-effective and adaptive alternative to conventional methods while emphasizing the challenge of generalization across diverse terrains worldwide.

TL;DR: 大型视觉基础模型在视网膜疾病分类中不一定必要，紧凑的通用模型在多数任务上表现接近最优，只有极难任务才需要专门的视网膜预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型领域特定基础模型是否必要，以及专门的视网膜预训练是否值得其计算成本。挑战当前普遍认为需要大型专业模型的假设。

Method: 在4个视网膜成像分类任务上评估12-13种模型配置，包括ViT、Swin Transformers、ConvNeXt和RETFound模型，在相同训练条件下比较初始化策略。

Result: 1) 预训练普遍有益（5.18-18.41%提升）；2) 紧凑架构（27-29M参数）主导帕累托前沿，SwinV2-tiny在三个数据集上表现最佳；3) RETFound（303M）仅在DR分级任务上值得其计算成本。

Conclusion: 紧凑的通用模型在大多数视网膜分类任务上提供接近最优性能，只有细粒度判别和极端类别不平衡的困难任务才需要专门的基础模型。

Abstract: Large vision foundation models have been widely adopted for retinal disease classification without systematic evidence justifying their parameter requirements. In the present work we address two critical questions: First, are large domain-specific foundation models essential, or do compact general-purpose architectures suffice? Second, does specialized retinal pretraining justify its computational cost? To answer this, we benchmark initialization strategies across four retinal imaging classification tasks spanning Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Color Fundus Photography (CFP) modalities: 8-class OCT classification, 3-class diabetic macular edema (DME), 5-class diabetic retinopathy (DR), and 3-class glaucoma (GL) detection. We evaluate 12-13 model configurations per task, including vision transformers (22.8M-86.6M parameters), Swin Transformers (27.6M-28.3M), ConvNeXt (28.6M), and the domain-specific RETFound models (303M), under identical training conditions. Our results challenge prevailing assumptions: First, we demonstrate that pretraining provides universal benefits (5.18-18.41% improvement), scaling with task difficulty. Second, compact architectures (27-29M) dominate Pareto frontiers; SwinV2-tiny achieves top-1 performance on three datasets. Third, RETFound (303M) justifies its computational cost only for challenging DR grading (accuracy of 71.15%), while ImageNet pretraining proves to be sufficient with all other tasks (DME accuracy: 99.24%, OCT accuracy: 97.96%). CFP tasks show larger pretraining accuracy gains (9.13-18.41%) than OCT (5.18%). Thus, the evidence suggests that compact general-purpose models deliver near-optimal performance for most retinal classification tasks; specialized foundation models warranted only for fine-grained discrimination under extreme class imbalance.

TL;DR: GACELLE是一个开源的GPU加速定量MRI分析框架，通过随机梯度下降和随机采样实现快速参数映射，相比CPU方法加速达451-14,380倍，同时提高参数精度和可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 定量MRI（qMRI）能够提供组织特异性生物标志物，但其参数估计的计算需求巨大，限制了在临床研究中的采用。高空间分辨率图像或多参数拟合需要冗长的处理时间，制约了常规流程使用和方法创新。

Method: 开发GACELLE开源框架，提供随机梯度下降优化器和随机采样器。用户只需提供前向信号模型，框架后端自动处理计算并行化、参数更新和内存批处理。随机求解器在CPU和GPU上执行完全向量化的马尔可夫链蒙特卡洛方法。

Result: 随机梯度下降求解器加速达451倍，随机采样加速达14,380倍，且不损失准确性。在三个代表性qMRI模型和图像重建任务中，GACELLE提高了参数精度、测试-重测可重复性，并减少了定量图中的噪声。

Conclusion: GACELLE通过结合速度、易用性和灵活性，为医学图像分析提供了通用优化框架，降低了qMRI的计算障碍，为可重复生物标志物开发、大规模成像研究和临床转化铺平了道路。

Abstract: Quantitative MRI (qMRI) offers tissue-specific biomarkers that can be tracked over time or compared across populations; however, its adoption in clinical research is hindered by significant computational demands of parameter estimation. Images acquired at high spatial resolution or requiring fitting multiple parameters often require lengthy processing time, constraining their use in routine pipelines and slowing methodological innovation and clinical translation.
  We present GACELLE, an open source, GPU-accelerated framework for high-throughput qMRI analysis. GACELLE provides a stochastic gradient descent optimiser and a stochastic sampler in MATLAB, enabling fast parameter mapping, improved estimation robustness via spatial regularisation, and uncertainty quantification. GACELLE prioritises accessibility: users only need to provide a forward signal model, while GACELLE's backend manages computational parallelisation, automatic parameter updates, and memory-batching. The stochastic solver performs fully vectorised Markov chain Monte Carlo with identical likelihood on CPU and GPU, ensuring reproducibility across hardware.
  Benchmarking demonstrates up to 451-fold acceleration for the stochastic gradient descent solver and 14,380-fold acceleration for stochastic sampling compared to CPU-based estimation, without compromising accuracy. We demonstrated GACELLE's versatility on three representative qMRI models and on an image reconstruction task. Across these applications, GACELLE improves parameter precision, enhances test-retest reproducibility, and reduces noise in quantitative maps.
  By combining speed, usability and flexibility, GACELLE provides a generalisable optimisation framework for medical image analysis. It lowers the computational barrier for qMRI, paving the way for reproducible biomarker development, large-scale imaging studies, and clinical translation.

Motivation: 现有3D几何基础模型主要基于自然场景训练，在结肠镜临床场景中性能下降，难以处理镜面反射和均匀纹理区域

Method: 提出ColonAdapter自监督微调框架，包含细节恢复模块(DRM)、几何一致性损失和置信度加权光度损失，无需地面真实内参

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上实现最先进的相机姿态估计、单目深度预测和密集3D点云重建性能

Conclusion: ColonAdapter成功将几何基础模型适配到结肠镜场景，解决了临床环境中的几何估计挑战，无需多阶段流程或地面真实内参

Abstract: Estimating 3D geometry from monocular colonoscopy images is challenging due to non-Lambertian surfaces, moving light sources, and large textureless regions. While recent 3D geometric foundation models eliminate the need for multi-stage pipelines, their performance deteriorates in clinical scenes. These models are primarily trained on natural scene datasets and struggle with specularity and homogeneous textures typical in colonoscopy, leading to inaccurate geometry estimation. In this paper, we present ColonAdapter, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that adapts geometric foundation models for colonoscopy geometry estimation. Our method leverages pretrained geometric priors while tailoring them to clinical data. To improve performance in low-texture regions and ensure scale consistency, we introduce a Detail Restoration Module (DRM) and a geometry consistency loss. Furthermore, a confidence-weighted photometric loss enhances training stability in clinical environments. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in camera pose estimation, monocular depth prediction, and dense 3D point map reconstruction, without requiring ground-truth intrinsic parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交互式游戏流媒体（IGS）对内容自适应编码（CAE）提出了特殊挑战：需要超低延迟编码、无前瞻缓冲、计算资源极度受限。现有CAE方法难以直接应用于IGS场景。

Method: 训练卷积神经网络（CNN），基于当前场景的编码块统计信息滑动窗口，预测即将到来场景的最佳分辨率。使用HEVC编码中的紧凑编码元数据，部署在实际IGS系统中。

Result: 相比HEVC默认固定分辨率阶梯，提升2.3 BD-VMAF点；每个场景推理仅需1ms单核CPU时间，无额外延迟开销。

Conclusion: 成功开发了首个适用于交互式游戏流媒体的内容自适应编码方案，在保持超低延迟的同时显著提升视频质量，解决了IGS中CAE部署的挑战。

Abstract: Video-on-demand streaming has benefitted from \textit{content-adaptive encoding} (CAE), i.e., adaptation of resolution and/or quantization parameters for each scene based on convex hull optimization. However, CAE is very challenging to develop and deploy for interactive game streaming (IGS). Commercial IGS services impose ultra-low latency encoding with no lookahead or buffering, and have extremely tight compute constraints for any CAE algorithm execution. We propose the first CAE approach for resolution adaptation in IGS based on compact encoding metadata from past frames. Specifically, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to infer the best resolution from the options available for the upcoming scene based on a running window of aggregated coding block statistics from the current scene. By deploying the trained CNN within a practical IGS setup based on HEVC encoding, our proposal: (i) improves over the default fixed-resolution ladder of HEVC by 2.3 Bjøntegaard Delta-VMAF points; (ii) infers using 1ms of a single CPU core per scene, thereby having no latency overhead.

TL;DR: 提出SG-Net解决脑转移瘤MRI分割中的"过分割悖论"，通过硬空间门控机制显著提升精度和边界准确性，同时减少参数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑转移瘤MRI分割面临小病灶（5-15mm）和极端类别不平衡（<2%肿瘤体积）的挑战。现有软注意力CNN存在"过分割悖论"：高召回率（>0.88）但精度崩溃（<0.23）和边界误差大（>150mm），这对立体定向放射外科规划构成重大风险。

Method: 提出空间门控网络（SG-Net），采用硬空间门控机制。与传统软注意力不同，SG-Net强制执行严格的特征选择，积极抑制背景伪影同时保留肿瘤特征。

Result: 在Brain-Mets-Lung-MRI数据集（n=92）上，SG-Net获得Dice相似系数0.5578±0.0243，显著优于Attention U-Net和ResU-Net（p<0.001）。边界精度提升三倍，95%豪斯多夫距离56.13mm（vs. 157.52mm），保持稳健召回率（0.79）和更高精度（0.52 vs. 0.20）。仅需0.67M参数（比Attention U-Net少8.8倍）。

Conclusion: 硬空间门控是精度驱动病灶检测的稳健解决方案，直接提升放射外科准确性，适合资源受限环境部署。

Abstract: Brain metastasis segmentation in MRI remains a formidable challenge due to diminutive lesion sizes (5-15 mm) and extreme class imbalance (less than 2% tumor volume). While soft-attention CNNs are widely used, we identify a critical failure mode termed the "over-segmentation paradox," where models achieve high sensitivity (recall > 0.88) but suffer from catastrophic precision collapse (precision < 0.23) and boundary errors exceeding 150 mm. This imprecision poses significant risks for stereotactic radiosurgery planning. To address this, we introduce the Spatial Gating Network (SG-Net), a precision-first architecture employing hard spatial gating mechanisms. Unlike traditional soft attention, SG-Net enforces strict feature selection to aggressively suppress background artifacts while preserving tumor features. Validated on the Brain-Mets-Lung-MRI dataset (n=92), SG-Net achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient of 0.5578 +/- 0.0243 (95% CI: 0.45-0.67), statistically outperforming Attention U-Net (p < 0.001) and ResU-Net (p < 0.001). Most critically, SG-Net demonstrates a threefold improvement in boundary precision, achieving a 95% Hausdorff Distance of 56.13 mm compared to 157.52 mm for Attention U-Net, while maintaining robust recall (0.79) and superior precision (0.52 vs. 0.20). Furthermore, SG-Net requires only 0.67M parameters (8.8x fewer than Attention U-Net), facilitating deployment in resource-constrained environments. These findings establish hard spatial gating as a robust solution for precision-driven lesion detection, directly enhancing radiosurgery accuracy.

Motivation: 牙齿分割需要大量实例级标注数据，但手动标注成本高昂，因此需要探索半监督学习解决数据稀缺问题

Method: 组织STS 2024挑战赛，提供包含2,380张OPG图像和330个CBCT扫描的大规模数据集，评估参赛团队的半监督学习方法

Result: 获胜的半监督模型相比仅使用标注数据的全监督nnU-Net基线有显著提升：2D OPG赛道IA分数提高44个百分点，3D CBCT赛道Instance Dice分数提高61个百分点

Conclusion: 半监督学习在标注数据稀缺的复杂实例级医学图像分割任务中具有巨大价值，最有效的方法结合了SAM等基础模型与多阶段粗到细优化流程

Abstract: Orthopantomogram (OPGs) and Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) are vital for dentistry, but creating large datasets for automated tooth segmentation is hindered by the labor-intensive process of manual instance-level annotation. This research aimed to benchmark and advance semi-supervised learning (SSL) as a solution for this data scarcity problem. We organized the 2nd Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation (STS 2024) Challenge at MICCAI 2024. We provided a large-scale dataset comprising over 90,000 2D images and 3D axial slices, which includes 2,380 OPG images and 330 CBCT scans, all featuring detailed instance-level FDI annotations on part of the data. The challenge attracted 114 (OPG) and 106 (CBCT) registered teams. To ensure algorithmic excellence and full transparency, we rigorously evaluated the valid, open-source submissions from the top 10 (OPG) and top 5 (CBCT) teams, respectively. All successful submissions were deep learning-based SSL methods. The winning semi-supervised models demonstrated impressive performance gains over a fully-supervised nnU-Net baseline trained only on the labeled data. For the 2D OPG track, the top method improved the Instance Affinity (IA) score by over 44 percentage points. For the 3D CBCT track, the winning approach boosted the Instance Dice score by 61 percentage points. This challenge confirms the substantial benefit of SSL for complex, instance-level medical image segmentation tasks where labeled data is scarce. The most effective approaches consistently leveraged hybrid semi-supervised frameworks that combined knowledge from foundational models like SAM with multi-stage, coarse-to-fine refinement pipelines. Both the challenge dataset and the participants' submitted code have been made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/ricoleehduu/STS-Challenge-2024), ensuring transparency and reproducibility.

TL;DR: Fβ分数在分类模型排序中广泛使用，但缺乏理论保证。本文证明Fβ诱导的排序有意义，是精度和召回率排序间的最短路径，但F1并非最优折衷，提供了寻找最优β的理论工具。

Motivation: 分类模型性能排序很重要但复杂，精度和召回率是互补但常矛盾的多维指标。Fβ分数作为加权调和平均被广泛使用，但缺乏理论保证其排序有意义且是好的折衷。需要澄清Fβ排序的性质和优化折衷方案。

Method: 1) 证明Fβ诱导的排序有意义，定义精度和召回率排序间的最短路径；2) 将两个分数的折衷问题表达为Kendall秩相关的优化问题；3) 提供理论工具和闭式表达式寻找任意分布或性能集的最优β值，并在六个案例研究中验证。

Result: 1) Fβ诱导的排序确实有意义，是精度和召回率排序间的最短路径；2) F1及其偏斜不敏感版本远非最优折衷；3) 开发了寻找最优β的理论框架和闭式解，案例研究验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Fβ分数提供了精度和召回率排序间的有意义的折衷，但常用的F1并非最优选择。本文提供了理论工具来寻找最优β值，为分类模型性能评估提供了更严谨的排序方法。

Abstract: Ranking methods or models based on their performance is of prime importance but is tricky because performance is fundamentally multidimensional. In the case of classification, precision and recall are scores with probabilistic interpretations that are both important to consider and complementary. The rankings induced by these two scores are often in partial contradiction. In practice, therefore, it is extremely useful to establish a compromise between the two views to obtain a single, global ranking. Over the last fifty years or so,it has been proposed to take a weighted harmonic mean, known as the F-score, F-measure, or $F_β$. Generally speaking, by averaging basic scores, we obtain a score that is intermediate in terms of values. However, there is no guarantee that these scores lead to meaningful rankings and no guarantee that the rankings are good tradeoffs between these base scores. Given the ubiquity of $F_β$ scores in the literature, some clarification is in order. Concretely: (1) We establish that $F_β$-induced rankings are meaningful and define a shortest path between precision- and recall-induced rankings. (2) We frame the problem of finding a tradeoff between two scores as an optimization problem expressed with Kendall rank correlations. We show that $F_1$ and its skew-insensitive version are far from being optimal in that regard. (3) We provide theoretical tools and a closed-form expression to find the optimal value for $β$ for any distribution or set of performances, and we illustrate their use on six case studies.

TL;DR: PRISM框架通过上下文感知的动态路由，在云边协同LLM推理中实现隐私与效用的优化平衡，相比基线方法显著降低能耗和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有云边推理方法采用统一的隐私保护策略，不考虑输入敏感性，导致对非敏感token进行不必要的扰动，降低推理质量。需要一种能根据上下文动态平衡隐私与效用的框架。

Method: 提出PRISM四阶段框架：1) 边缘设备分析实体级敏感性；2) 软门控模块选择执行模式（云、边或协同）；3) 协同路径中基于实体风险应用自适应双层本地差分隐私；4) 云端LLM生成语义草图，边缘SLM利用本地上下文进行细化。

Result: PRISM在各种场景下均实现优越的隐私-效用权衡，将能耗和延迟降低至基线方法（Uniform和Selective LDP）的40-50%，同时在强隐私约束下保持高质量输出。

Conclusion: PRISM通过上下文感知的动态路由机制，有效解决了云边LLM推理中隐私保护与计算效率的平衡问题，为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and generation, but incur high communication overhead and privacy risks in cloud deployments, while facing compute and memory constraints when confined to edge devices. Cloud-edge inference has emerged as a promising paradigm for improving privacy in LLM services by retaining sensitive computations on local devices. However, existing cloud-edge inference approaches apply uniform privacy protection without considering input sensitivity, resulting in unnecessary perturbation and degraded utility even for non-sensitive tokens. To address this limitation, we propose Privacy-aware Routing for Inference with Semantic Modulation (PRISM), a context-aware framework that dynamically balances privacy and inference quality. PRISM executes in four stages: (1) the edge device profiles entity-level sensitivity; (2) a soft gating module on the edge selects an execution mode - cloud, edge, or collaboration; (3) for collaborative paths, the edge applies adaptive two-layer local differential privacy based on entity risks; and (4) the cloud LLM generates a semantic sketch from the perturbed prompt, which is then refined by the edge-side small language model (SLM) using local context. Our results show that PRISM consistently achieves superior privacy-utility trade-offs across various scenarios, reducing energy consumption and latency to 40-50% of baseline methods such as Uniform and Selective LDP, while maintaining high output quality under strong privacy constraints. These findings are validated through comprehensive evaluations involving realistic prompts, actual energy measurements, and heterogeneous cloud-edge model deployments.

TL;DR: Geo-Detective是一个模仿人类推理和工具使用的图像地理位置推断智能体，通过四步自适应策略和专门工具（如视觉反向搜索）显著提升地理位置识别准确率，特别是在缺乏可见地理特征的图像上表现优异，但也凸显了隐私风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体图像常包含地理线索，传统地理位置识别方法需要专家参与且泛化能力差。虽然大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）使普通用户也能进行准确地理位置识别，但现有方法未针对此任务优化。本文旨在探索图像地理位置识别的全部潜力及其相关的隐私风险。

Method: 提出Geo-Detective智能体，模仿人类推理和工具使用进行图像地理位置推断。采用四步自适应策略，根据图像难度选择不同方法。配备专门工具如视觉反向搜索，模拟人类收集外部地理线索的过程。

Result: Geo-Detective在整体上优于基线大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs），特别是在缺乏可见地理特征的图像上表现突出。在国家级地理位置任务中，相比基线LLMs提升超过11.1%；在更细粒度级别上仍有约5.2%的性能提升。当配备外部线索时，Geo-Detective更可能产生准确预测，将"未知"预测率降低超过50.6%。

Conclusion: Geo-Detective展示了强大的地理位置识别能力，特别是在处理缺乏明显地理特征的图像时。然而，其强大的识别能力也带来了显著的隐私风险，需要更有效的隐私保护措施。该智能体表现出更强的鲁棒性，凸显了开发更有效隐私保护策略的必要性。

Abstract: Images shared on social media often expose geographic cues. While early geolocation methods required expert effort and lacked generalization, the rise of Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) now enables accurate geolocation even for ordinary users. However, existing approaches are not optimized for this task. To explore the full potential and associated privacy risks, we present Geo-Detective, an agent that mimics human reasoning and tool use for image geolocation inference. It follows a procedure with four steps that adaptively selects strategies based on image difficulty and is equipped with specialized tools such as visual reverse search, which emulates how humans gather external geographic clues. Experimental results show that GEO-Detective outperforms baseline large vision language models (LVLMs) overall, particularly on images lacking visible geographic features. In country level geolocation tasks, it achieves an improvement of over 11.1% compared to baseline LLMs, and even at finer grained levels, it still provides around a 5.2% performance gain. Meanwhile, when equipped with external clues, GEO-Detective becomes more likely to produce accurate predictions, reducing the "unknown" prediction rate by more than 50.6%. We further explore multiple defense strategies and find that Geo-Detective exhibits stronger robustness, highlighting the need for more effective privacy safeguards.

TL;DR: PAT提出了一种前缀感知的注意力内核实现，通过pack-forward-merge范式优化LLM解码中的共享前缀利用，显著降低注意力延迟和内存带宽压力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM服务中解码注意力成为主要瓶颈，这是内存受限的操作。现实工作负载中存在大量跨请求的层次化共享前缀（如系统提示、工具模板、RAG），现有注意力实现无法充分利用这些共享前缀，导致重复加载KV缓存和资源浪费。

Method: PAT采用pack-forward-merge范式：1) 按共享前缀打包查询以减少重复内存访问；2) 运行定制的多tile内核实现高资源效率；3) 应用多流转发和KV分割减少资源气泡；4) 最终合并执行在线softmax。

Result: 在真实和合成工作负载上的评估显示，PAT平均减少注意力延迟67.4%，在相同配置下TPOT降低13.6-83.4%，优于现有最先进的注意力内核。

Conclusion: PAT通过有效利用共享前缀显著优化了LLM解码注意力性能，可作为vLLM的即插即用插件，解决了现有实现中的内存带宽压力和资源效率问题。

Abstract: LLM serving is increasingly dominated by decode attention, which is a memory-bound operation due to massive KV cache loading from global memory. Meanwhile, real-world workloads exhibit substantial, hierarchical shared prefixes across requests (e.g., system prompts, tools/templates, RAG). Existing attention implementations fail to fully exploit prefix sharing: *one-query-per-CTA* execution repeatedly loads shared prefix KV cache, while *one-size-fits-all* tiling leaves on-chip resources idle and exacerbates bubbles for uneven KV lengths. These choices amplify memory bandwidth pressure and stall memory-bound decode attention.
  This paper introduces PAT, a prefix-aware attention kernel implementation for LLM decoding that organizes execution with a pack-forward-merge paradigm. PAT packs queries by shared prefix to reduce repeated memory accesses, runs a customized multi-tile kernel to achieve high resource efficiency. It further applies practical multi-stream forwarding and KV splitting to reduce resource bubbles. The final merge performs online softmax with negligible overhead. We implement PAT as an off-the-shelf plugin for vLLM. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic workloads shows that PAT reduces attention latency by 67.4% on average and TPOT by 13.6-83.4% under the same configurations against state-of-the-art attention kernels.

Conclusion: 通过选择性微调任务特定注意力头的Robotic Steering方法，能有效适应视觉语言动作模型到多样化机器人任务

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLAs) models promise to extend the remarkable success of vision-language models (VLMs) to robotics. Yet, unlike VLMs in the vision-language domain, VLAs for robotics require finetuning to contend with varying physical factors like robot embodiment, environment characteristics, and spatial relationships of each task. Existing fine-tuning methods lack specificity, adapting the same set of parameters regardless of a task's visual, linguistic, and physical characteristics. Inspired by functional specificity in neuroscience, we hypothesize that it is more effective to finetune sparse model representations specific to a given task. In this work, we introduce Robotic Steering, a finetuning approach grounded in mechanistic interpretability that leverages few-shot demonstrations to identify and selectively finetune task-specific attention heads aligned with the physical, visual, and linguistic requirements of robotic tasks. Through comprehensive on-robot evaluations with a Franka Emika robot arm, we demonstrate that Robotic Steering outperforms LoRA while achieving superior robustness under task variation, reduced computational cost, and enhanced interpretability for adapting VLAs to diverse robotic tasks.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型在跨任务、场景和视角的泛化能力不足，动作生成粗糙不稳定，且连续扩散策略与真实机器人控制的离散特性不匹配

Method: 提出连续化离散扩散框架E0，将动作生成建模为量化动作token的迭代去噪过程；引入球形视角扰动增强方法提升相机偏移鲁棒性

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a unified framework for robotic manipulation by integrating visual perception, language understanding, and control generation. Yet existing VLA models still struggle to generalize across diverse tasks, scenes, and camera viewpoints, and often produce coarse or unstable actions. We introduce E0, a continuized discrete diffusion framework that formulates action generation as iterative denoising over quantized action tokens. Compared with continuous diffusion policies, E0 offers two key advantages: (1) discrete action tokens align naturally with the symbolic structure of pretrained VLM/VLA backbones, enabling stronger semantic conditioning; and 2. discrete diffusion matches the true quantized nature of real-world robot control-whose hardware constraints (e.g., encoder resolution, control frequency, actuation latency) inherently discretize continuous signals-and therefore benefits from a Bayes-optimal denoiser that models the correct discrete action distribution, leading to stronger generalization. Compared with discrete autoregressive and mask-based discrete diffusion models, E0 supports a significantly larger and finer-grained action vocabulary and avoids the distributional mismatch introduced by masking-based corruptions-yielding more accurate fine-grained action control. We further introduce a spherical viewpoint perturbation augmentation method to improve robustness to camera shifts without additional data. Experiments on LIBERO, VLABench, and ManiSkill show that E0 achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 diverse environments, outperforming strong baselines by 10.7% on average. Real-world evaluation on a Franka arm confirms that E0 delivers precise, robust, and transferable manipulation, establishing discrete diffusion as a promising direction for generalizable VLA policy learning.

Method: 提出RealD²iff分层扩散框架，将深度噪声分解为全局结构失真和局部扰动；采用频率引导监督进行全局建模，差异引导优化进行局部细化；构建六阶段模仿学习流程

Result: 能够生成真实世界深度数据构建干净-噪声配对数据集，无需手动传感器数据收集；实现零样本sim2real机器人操作，显著提升真实世界性能而无需额外微调

Conclusion: 通过干净到噪声范式成功弥合视觉sim2real差距，为仿真驱动的机器人学习提供了有效解决方案，在零样本操作方面表现出色

Abstract: Robot manipulation in the real world is fundamentally constrained by the visual sim2real gap, where depth observations collected in simulation fail to reflect the complex noise patterns inherent to real sensors. In this work, inspired by the denoising capability of diffusion models, we invert the conventional perspective and propose a clean-to-noisy paradigm that learns to synthesize noisy depth, thereby bridging the visual sim2real gap through purely simulation-driven robotic learning. Building on this idea, we introduce RealD$^2$iff, a hierarchical coarse-to-fine diffusion framework that decomposes depth noise into global structural distortions and fine-grained local perturbations. To enable progressive learning of these components, we further develop two complementary strategies: Frequency-Guided Supervision (FGS) for global structure modeling and Discrepancy-Guided Optimization (DGO) for localized refinement. To integrate RealD$^2$iff seamlessly into imitation learning, we construct a pipeline that spans six stages. We provide comprehensive empirical and experimental validation demonstrating the effectiveness of this paradigm. RealD$^2$iff enables two key applications: (1) generating real-world-like depth to construct clean-noisy paired datasets without manual sensor data collection. (2) Achieving zero-shot sim2real robot manipulation, substantially improving real-world performance without additional fine-tuning.

Motivation: 现有机器人操作策略评估方法缺乏对杂乱场景的系统性分析，特别是从心理物理学角度考虑环境因素、干扰物数量、特征和排列的综合影响。

Method: 提出统一的杂乱度度量方法，考虑环境因素和干扰物特性；在超真实仿真和真实世界中系统构建评估场景；对视觉-语言-动作模型进行广泛实验。

Result: 场景杂乱使策略性能下降高达34%；不同VLA策略有独特脆弱性且成功场景一致性低；杂乱度度量能有效指示性能下降；干扰物数量和遮挡影响显著；微调不能同等缓解所有杂乱负面影响。

Conclusion: 需要更系统的评估方法来分析机器人操作策略在杂乱场景中的性能，统一的杂乱度度量是有效指标，不同策略有独特脆弱性，单纯数据增强微调不能完全解决杂乱带来的挑战。

Abstract: In this work, we propose an evaluation protocol for examining the performance of robotic manipulation policies in cluttered scenes. Contrary to prior works, we approach evaluation from a psychophysical perspective, therefore we use a unified measure of clutter that accounts for environmental factors as well as the distractors quantity, characteristics, and arrangement. Using this measure, we systematically construct evaluation scenarios in both hyper-realistic simulation and real-world and conduct extensive experimentation on manipulation policies, in particular vision-language-action (VLA) models. Our experiments highlight the significant impact of scene clutter, lowering the performance of the policies, by as much as 34% and show that despite achieving similar average performance across the tasks, different VLA policies have unique vulnerabilities and a relatively low agreement on success scenarios. We further show that our clutter measure is an effective indicator of performance degradation and analyze the impact of distractors in terms of their quantity and occluding influence. At the end, we show that finetuning on enhanced data, although effective, does not equally remedy all negative impacts of clutter on performance.

Abstract: Underwater visual localization remains challenging due to wavelength-dependent attenuation, poor texture, and non-Gaussian sensor noise. We introduce MARVO, a physics-aware, learning-integrated odometry framework that fuses underwater image formation modeling, differentiable matching, and reinforcement-learning optimization. At the front-end, we extend transformer-based feature matcher with a Physics Aware Radiance Adapter that compensates for color channel attenuation and contrast loss, yielding geometrically consistent feature correspondences under turbidity. These semi dense matches are combined with inertial and pressure measurements inside a factor-graph backend, where we formulate a keyframe-based visual-inertial-barometric estimator using GTSAM library. Each keyframe introduces (i) Pre-integrated IMU motion factors, (ii) MARVO-derived visual pose factors, and (iii) barometric depth priors, giving a full-state MAP estimate in real time. Lastly, we introduce a Reinforcement-Learningbased Pose-Graph Optimizer that refines global trajectories beyond local minima of classical least-squares solvers by learning optimal retraction actions on SE(2).

Conclusion: 通过原则性的不确定性建模结合驾驶先验，显著提升了纯相机端到端自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性，实现了鲁棒且可解释的轨迹规划

Abstract: End-to-End (E2E) planning has become a powerful paradigm for autonomous driving, yet current systems remain fundamentally uncertainty-blind. They assume perception outputs are fully reliable, even in ambiguous or poorly observed scenes, leaving the planner without an explicit measure of uncertainty. To address this limitation, we propose a camera-only E2E framework that estimates aleatoric uncertainty directly in BEV space and incorporates it into planning. Our method produces a dense, uncertainty-aware drivability map that captures both semantic structure and geometric layout at pixel-level resolution. To further promote safe and rule-compliant behavior, we introduce a lane-following regularization that encodes lane structure and traffic norms. This prior stabilizes trajectory planning under normal conditions while preserving the flexibility needed for maneuvers such as overtaking or lane changes. Together, these components enable robust and interpretable trajectory planning, even under challenging uncertainty conditions. Evaluated on the NAVSIM benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering substantial gains on both the challenging NAVHARD and NAVSAFE subsets. These results demonstrate that our principled aleatoric uncertainty modeling combined with driving priors significantly advances the safety and reliability of camera-only E2E autonomous driving.

Conclusion: 算法创新可以克服先前3DGS SLAM方法的内存限制，实现可扩展的大规模环境重建

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated impressive results for novel view synthesis with real-time rendering capabilities. However, integrating 3DGS with SLAM systems faces a fundamental scalability limitation: methods are constrained by GPU memory capacity, restricting reconstruction to small-scale environments. We present DiskChunGS, a scalable 3DGS SLAM system that overcomes this bottleneck through an out-of-core approach that partitions scenes into spatial chunks and maintains only active regions in GPU memory while storing inactive areas on disk. Our architecture integrates seamlessly with existing SLAM frameworks for pose estimation and loop closure, enabling globally consistent reconstruction at scale. We validate DiskChunGS on indoor scenes (Replica, TUM-RGBD), urban driving scenarios (KITTI), and resource-constrained Nvidia Jetson platforms. Our method uniquely completes all 11 KITTI sequences without memory failures while achieving superior visual quality, demonstrating that algorithmic innovation can overcome the memory constraints that have limited previous 3DGS SLAM methods.

Conclusion: UNOGrasp通过创新的多步推理框架和视觉锚定机制，有效解决了机器人抓取中的障碍推理问题，为杂乱环境中的机器人操作提供了更强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Successful robotic grasping in cluttered environments not only requires a model to visually ground a target object but also to reason about obstructions that must be cleared beforehand. While current vision-language embodied reasoning models show emergent spatial understanding, they remain limited in terms of obstruction reasoning and accessibility planning. To bridge this gap, we present UNOGrasp, a learning-based vision-language model capable of performing visually-grounded obstruction reasoning to infer the sequence of actions needed to unobstruct the path and grasp the target object. We devise a novel multi-step reasoning process based on obstruction paths originated by the target object. We anchor each reasoning step with obstruction-aware visual cues to incentivize reasoning capability. UNOGrasp combines supervised and reinforcement finetuning through verifiable reasoning rewards. Moreover, we construct UNOBench, a large-scale dataset for both training and benchmarking, based on MetaGraspNetV2, with over 100k obstruction paths annotated by humans with obstruction ratios, contact points, and natural-language instructions. Extensive experiments and real-robot evaluations show that UNOGrasp significantly improves obstruction reasoning and grasp success across both synthetic and real-world environments, outperforming generalist and proprietary alternatives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: IGROT（图像引导检索与可选文本）在Google Image和Bing等应用中很重要，但进展受限：缺乏可访问的基准，现有方法在视觉和组合查询之间不平衡，大型数据集计算成本过高。

Method: 1) 引入FIGROTD数据集：16,474个训练三元组和1,262个测试三元组，覆盖CIR、SBIR和CSTBIR任务；2) 提出VaGFeM（方差引导特征掩码）：基于方差统计选择性增强判别性维度；3) 采用双损失设计：InfoNCE + Triplet损失提升组合推理能力。

Conclusion: 提出的FIGROTD数据集和VaGFeM方法有效解决了IGROT任务的数据和方法瓶颈，在轻量级设置下实现了平衡且高性能的图像引导检索。

Abstract: Image-Guided Retrieval with Optional Text (IGROT) unifies visual retrieval (without text) and composed retrieval (with text). Despite its relevance in applications like Google Image and Bing, progress has been limited by the lack of an accessible benchmark and methods that balance performance across subtasks. Large-scale datasets such as MagicLens are comprehensive but computationally prohibitive, while existing models often favor either visual or compositional queries. We introduce FIGROTD, a lightweight yet high-quality IGROT dataset with 16,474 training triplets and 1,262 test triplets across CIR, SBIR, and CSTBIR. To reduce redundancy, we propose the Variance Guided Feature Mask (VaGFeM), which selectively enhances discriminative dimensions based on variance statistics. We further adopt a dual-loss design (InfoNCE + Triplet) to improve compositional reasoning. Trained on FIGROTD, VaGFeM achieves competitive results on nine benchmarks, reaching 34.8 mAP@10 on CIRCO and 75.7 mAP@200 on Sketchy, outperforming stronger baselines despite fewer triplets.

Conclusion: UNION方法在低数据监督下展现出鲁棒性和高效性，能够有效桥接视觉和语言跨不同查询类型

Abstract: Image-Guided Retrieval with Optional Text (IGROT) is a general retrieval setting where a query consists of an anchor image, with or without accompanying text, aiming to retrieve semantically relevant target images. This formulation unifies two major tasks: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) and Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (SBIR). In this work, we address IGROT under low-data supervision by introducing UNION, a lightweight and generalisable target representation that fuses the image embedding with a null-text prompt. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on fixed target features, UNION enhances semantic alignment with multimodal queries while requiring no architectural modifications to pretrained vision-language models. With only 5,000 training samples - from LlavaSCo for CIR and Training-Sketchy for SBIR - our method achieves competitive results across benchmarks, including CIRCO mAP@50 of 38.5 and Sketchy mAP@200 of 82.7, surpassing many heavily supervised baselines. This demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of UNION in bridging vision and language across diverse query types.

Conclusion: 该方法为蛋白质设计提供了通用且适应性强的解决方案，并为跨生物分子系统和其他科学发现任务的集体LLM驱动设计奠定了基础

Abstract: Designing proteins de novo with tailored structural, physicochemical, and functional properties remains a grand challenge in biotechnology, medicine, and materials science, due to the vastness of sequence space and the complex coupling between sequence, structure, and function. Current state-of-the-art generative methods, such as protein language models (PLMs) and diffusion-based architectures, often require extensive fine-tuning, task-specific data, or model reconfiguration to support objective-directed design, thereby limiting their flexibility and scalability. To overcome these limitations, we present a decentralized, agent-based framework inspired by swarm intelligence for de novo protein design. In this approach, multiple large language model (LLM) agents operate in parallel, each assigned to a specific residue position. These agents iteratively propose context-aware mutations by integrating design objectives, local neighborhood interactions, and memory and feedback from previous iterations. This position-wise, decentralized coordination enables emergent design of diverse, well-defined sequences without reliance on motif scaffolds or multiple sequence alignments, validated with experiments on proteins with alpha helix and coil structures. Through analyses of residue conservation, structure-based metrics, and sequence convergence and embeddings, we demonstrate that the framework exhibits emergent behaviors and effective navigation of the protein fitness landscape. Our method achieves efficient, objective-directed designs within a few GPU-hours and operates entirely without fine-tuning or specialized training, offering a generalizable and adaptable solution for protein design. Beyond proteins, the approach lays the groundwork for collective LLM-driven design across biomolecular systems and other scientific discovery tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have made significant progress in mathematical reasoning, which serves as an important testbed for AI and could impact scientific research if further advanced. By scaling reasoning with reinforcement learning that rewards correct final answers, LLMs have improved from poor performance to saturating quantitative reasoning competitions like AIME and HMMT in one year. However, this approach faces fundamental limitations. Pursuing higher final answer accuracy doesn't address a key issue: correct answers don't guarantee correct reasoning. Moreover, many mathematical tasks like theorem proving require rigorous step-by-step derivation rather than numerical answers, making final answer rewards inapplicable. To push the limits of deep reasoning, we believe it is necessary to verify the comprehensiveness and rigor of mathematical reasoning. Self-verification is particularly important for scaling test-time compute, especially for open problems without known solutions. Towards self-verifiable mathematical reasoning, we investigate how to train an accurate and faithful LLM-based verifier for theorem proving. We then train a proof generator using the verifier as the reward model, and incentivize the generator to identify and resolve as many issues as possible in their own proofs before finalizing them. To maintain the generation-verification gap as the generator becomes stronger, we propose to scale verification compute to automatically label new hard-to-verify proofs, creating training data to further improve the verifier. Our resulting model, DeepSeekMath-V2, demonstrates strong theorem-proving capabilities, achieving gold-level scores on IMO 2025 and CMO 2024 and a near-perfect 118/120 on Putnam 2024 with scaled test-time compute.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型推理模型依赖冗长的"思考"token链，导致高延迟、冗余和不连贯的推理路径。受人类思维语言假说启发，需要开发类似人类Mentalese的紧凑符号化推理方式。

Method: 提出Mentalese框架，将抽象推理编码为超压缩的结构化token；开发SLPO强化学习方法，奖励简洁且正确的解决方案，同时允许必要时进行更长的推理。

Result: ORION模型在AIME、MinervaMath等基准测试中：推理token减少4-16倍，推理延迟降低5倍，训练成本降低7-9倍，保持90-98%准确率，在部分任务上超越Claude和GPT-4o达5%。

Conclusion: Mentalese风格的压缩推理实现了类人认知效率，在保持准确性的同时实现实时、经济高效的推理，为AI推理系统提供了新的发展方向。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance in mathematics, code generation, and task planning, but their reliance on long chains of verbose "thinking" tokens leads to high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning paths. Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression. These results show that Mentalese-style compressed reasoning offers a step toward human-like cognitive efficiency, enabling real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy.

Result: 合成临床笔记不仅提升了分类性能（特别是在领域转移情况下），还解锁了跨模态检索能力，这是一个在训练期间未明确优化的下游任务。

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的提示和医学元数据整合，LLM生成的合成临床笔记能有效增强皮肤病学多模态学习，提升模型鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal (MM) learning is emerging as a promising paradigm in biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) applications, integrating complementary modality, which highlight different aspects of patient health. The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training.

TL;DR: GCA提出了一种无需训练的多模态代理范式，通过形式化任务约束解决VLMs在空间推理中的语义-几何鸿沟问题，将VLM角色解耦为语义分析师和任务求解器，在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在空间推理中存在根本性的语义-几何鸿沟：擅长定性语义推理但推理过程在损失性语义空间中进行，与高保真几何不匹配。现有方法无法解决这一问题：基于训练的方法存在"神谕悖论"，从有缺陷的神谕中学习错误的空间逻辑；工具集成方法虽然约束最终计算，但未能约束VLM的规划过程，导致几何错误的计划。

Method: 提出几何约束代理(GCA)，这是一种无需训练的代理范式，通过引入形式化任务约束来弥合语义-几何鸿沟。策略性地将VLM角色解耦为两个阶段：1)作为语义分析师，将用户的模糊查询转换为可验证的形式化任务约束，定义参考框架和目标；2)作为任务求解器，在约束定义的确定性边界内生成和执行工具调用。

Result: GCA在多个空间推理基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，超越了现有的基于训练和工具集成方法约27%。该方法成功解决了语义-几何鸿沟问题，为空间推理提供了稳健且可验证的推理路径。

Conclusion: GCA通过形式化任务约束和角色解耦策略，有效解决了VLMs在空间推理中的语义-几何鸿沟问题，提供了一种无需训练、可验证的稳健推理范式，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit a fundamental semantic-to-geometric gap in spatial reasoning: they excel at qualitative semantic inference but their reasoning operates within a lossy semantic space, misaligned with high-fidelity geometry. Current paradigms fail to bridge this gap. Training-based methods suffer from an ``oracle paradox,'' learning flawed spatial logic from imperfect oracles. Tool-integrated methods constrain the final computation but critically leave the VLM's planning process unconstrained, resulting in geometrically flawed plans. In this work, we propose Geometrically-Constrained Agent (GCA), a training-free agentic paradigm that resolves this gap by introducing a formal task constraint. Specifically, we strategically decouples the VLM's role into two stages. First, acting as a semantic analyst, the VLM translates the user's ambiguous query into the formal, verifiable task constraint, which defines the reference frame and objective. Second, acting as a task solver, the VLM generates and executes tool calls strictly within the deterministic bounds defined by the constraint. This geometrically-constrained reasoning strategy successfully resolve the semantic-to-geometric gap, yielding a robust and verifiable reasoning pathway for spatial reasoning. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GCA achieves SOTA performance on multiple spatial reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing training-based and tool-integrated methods by ~27%.

Abstract: Novice and expert users have different systematic preferences in task-oriented dialogues. However, whether catering to these preferences actually improves user experience and task performance remains understudied. To investigate the effects of expertise-based personalization, we first built a version of an enterprise AI assistant with passive personalization. We then conducted a user study where participants completed timed exams, aided by the two versions of the AI assistant. Preliminary results indicate that passive personalization helps reduce task load and improve assistant perception, but reveal task-specific limitations that can be addressed through providing more user agency. These findings underscore the importance of combining active and passive personalization to optimize user experience and effectiveness in enterprise task-oriented environments.
