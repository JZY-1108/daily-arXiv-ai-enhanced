Such sensory conflicts test\nperception, yet humans reliably resolve them by prioritizing sound over\nmisleading visuals. Despite advances in multimodal AI integrating vision and\naudio, little is known about how these systems handle cross-modal conflicts or\nwhether they favor one modality. In this study, we systematically examine\nmodality bias and conflict resolution in AI sound localization. We assess\nleading multimodal models and benchmark them against human performance in\npsychophysics experiments across six audiovisual conditions, including\ncongruent, conflicting, and absent cues. Humans consistently outperform AI,\ndemonstrating superior resilience to conflicting or missing visuals by relying\non auditory information. In contrast, AI models often default to visual input,\ndegrading performance to near chance levels. To address this, we finetune a\nstate-of-the-art model using a stereo audio-image dataset generated via 3D\nsimulations. Even with limited training data, the refined model surpasses\nexisting benchmarks. Notably, it also mirrors human-like horizontal\nlocalization bias favoring left-right precision-likely due to the stereo audio\nstructure reflecting human ear placement.

This includes measuring\nthe spatial distribution of cell bodies (cytoarchitecture) and nerve fibers\n(myeloarchitecture). The gold standard for cytoarchitectonic analysis is light\nmicroscopic imaging of cell-body stained tissue sections. To reveal the 3D\norientations of nerve fibers, 3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) has been\nintroduced as a reliable technique providing a resolution in the micrometer\nrange while allowing processing of series of complete brain sections. 3D-PLI\nacquisition is label-free and allows subsequent staining of sections after\nmeasurement. By post-staining for cell bodies, a direct link between fiber- and\ncytoarchitecture can potentially be established within the same section.\nHowever, inevitable distortions introduced during the staining process make a\nnonlinear and cross-modal registration necessary in order to study the detailed\nrelationships between cells and fibers in the images. In addition, the\ncomplexity of processing histological sections for post-staining only allows\nfor a limited number of samples. In this work, we take advantage of deep\nlearning methods for image-to-image translation to generate a virtual staining\nof 3D-PLI that is spatially aligned at the cellular level. In a supervised\nsetting, we build on a unique dataset of brain sections, to which Cresyl violet\nstaining has been applied after 3D-PLI measurement. To ensure high\ncorrespondence between both modalities, we address the misalignment of training\ndata using Fourier-based registration methods. In this way, registration can be\nefficiently calculated during training for local image patches of target and\npredicted staining.

Taking multiple images can\nhelp if any object is occluded from one viewpoint but more visible from another\nviewpoint. However, the camera has to be moved to a sequence of suitable\npositions for capturing multiple images, which requires time and may not always\nbe possible, due to reachability constraints. So while additional images can\nproduce more accurate grasp poses due to the extra information available, the\ntime-cost goes up with the number of additional views sampled. Scene\nrepresentations like Gaussian Splatting are capable of rendering accurate\nphotorealistic virtual images from user-specified novel viewpoints. In this\nwork, we show initial results which indicate that novel view synthesis can\nprovide additional context in generating grasp poses.
