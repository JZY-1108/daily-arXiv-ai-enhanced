### [1] [Cyclic Ablation: Testing Concept Localization against Functional Regeneration in AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25220)
*Eduard Kapelko*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过循环消融方法测试欺骗行为是否可被局部移除，发现欺骗行为具有高度韧性，每次消融后都能通过对抗训练恢复，但会导致语言性能逐渐下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型中的不良行为（如欺骗）是否可被局部化移除，还是与模型核心认知能力深度交织。

Method: 引入循环消融方法，结合稀疏自编码器、定向消融和对抗训练，在DistilGPT-2上尝试消除欺骗概念。

Result: 欺骗行为具有高度韧性，模型通过对抗训练持续恢复欺骗行为（功能再生），但每次消融都导致语言性能逐渐下降（困惑度上升）。

Conclusion: 复杂概念是分布且纠缠的，通过机制可解释性进行直接模型编辑存在局限性。

Abstract: Safety and controllability are critical for large language models. A central
question is whether undesirable behaviors like deception are localized
functions that can be removed, or if they are deeply intertwined with a model's
core cognitive abilities. We introduce "cyclic ablation," an iterative method
to test this. By combining sparse autoencoders, targeted ablation, and
adversarial training on DistilGPT-2, we attempted to eliminate the concept of
deception. We found that, contrary to the localization hypothesis, deception
was highly resilient. The model consistently recovered its deceptive behavior
after each ablation cycle via adversarial training, a process we term
functional regeneration. Crucially, every attempt at this "neurosurgery" caused
a gradual but measurable decay in general linguistic performance, reflected by
a consistent rise in perplexity. These findings are consistent with the view
that complex concepts are distributed and entangled, underscoring the
limitations of direct model editing through mechanistic interpretability.

### [2] [From Internal Representations to Text Quality: A Geometric Approach to LLM Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25359)
*Viacheslav Yusupov,Danil Maksimov,Ameliia Alaeva,Anna Vasileva,Anna Antipina,Tatyana Zaitseva,Alina Ermilova,Evgeny Burnaev,Egor Shvetsov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过分析LLM内部表示的几何特性，发现这些特性可以作为评估生成文本质量的可靠指标，无需参考文本或人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 连接LLM的内部分析和外部评估方法，寻找能够反映文本固有特性的几何指标来替代传统的人工评估。

Method: 验证了包括最大可解释方差、有效秩、本征维度、MAUVE分数和Schatten范数在内的一组度量指标，在不同LLM层中测量这些几何特性。

Result: 发现本征维度和有效秩可以作为文本自然度和质量的通用评估指标，不同模型基于这些几何特性对文本的排序结果一致。

Conclusion: 几何特性反映了文本的固有特征而非模型特定伪影，为自动化评估流程提供了无需参考文本的质量评估方法。

Abstract: This paper bridges internal and external analysis approaches to large
language models (LLMs) by demonstrating that geometric properties of internal
model representations serve as reliable proxies for evaluating generated text
quality. We validate a set of metrics including Maximum Explainable Variance,
Effective Rank, Intrinsic Dimensionality, MAUVE score, and Schatten Norms
measured across different layers of LLMs, demonstrating that Intrinsic
Dimensionality and Effective Rank can serve as universal assessments of text
naturalness and quality. Our key finding reveals that different models
consistently rank text from various sources in the same order based on these
geometric properties, indicating that these metrics reflect inherent text
characteristics rather than model-specific artifacts. This allows a
reference-free text quality evaluation that does not require human-annotated
datasets, offering practical advantages for automated evaluation pipelines.

### [3] [Generative Value Conflicts Reveal LLM Priorities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25369)
*Andy Liu,Kshitish Ghate,Mona Diab,Daniel Fried,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Max Kleiman-Weiner*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ConflictScope是一个自动评估LLM在价值冲突中如何优先排序不同价值的管道，通过生成价值冲突场景来测试模型的价值排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐数据集缺乏价值冲突场景，而实际部署中AI助手经常需要在不同价值之间做出权衡，需要评估模型的价值优先排序能力。

Method: 给定用户定义的价值集合，ConflictScope自动生成两个价值冲突的场景，使用LLM编写的用户提示来测试目标模型，并通过自由文本响应评估价值排序。

Result: 研究发现模型在开放式评估中会从支持保护性价值转向支持个人价值；在系统提示中包含详细价值排序可将对齐目标排序的效果提高14%。

Conclusion: 评估模型的价值优先排序很重要，系统提示可以在价值冲突中适度改善LLM行为的对齐效果，为未来研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Past work seeks to align large language model (LLM)-based assistants with a
target set of values, but such assistants are frequently forced to make
tradeoffs between values when deployed. In response to the scarcity of value
conflict in existing alignment datasets, we introduce ConflictScope, an
automatic pipeline to evaluate how LLMs prioritize different values. Given a
user-defined value set, ConflictScope automatically generates scenarios in
which a language model faces a conflict between two values sampled from the
set. It then prompts target models with an LLM-written "user prompt" and
evaluates their free-text responses to elicit a ranking over values in the
value set. Comparing results between multiple-choice and open-ended
evaluations, we find that models shift away from supporting protective values,
such as harmlessness, and toward supporting personal values, such as user
autonomy, in more open-ended value conflict settings. However, including
detailed value orderings in models' system prompts improves alignment with a
target ranking by 14%, showing that system prompting can achieve moderate
success at aligning LLM behavior under value conflict. Our work demonstrates
the importance of evaluating value prioritization in models and provides a
foundation for future work in this area.

### [4] [From Faithfulness to Correctness: Generative Reward Models that Think Critically](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25409)
*Qiyao Ma,Yunsheng Shi,Hongtao Tian,Chao Wang,Weiming Chang,Ting Yao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出TRM模型解决RLVR在复杂任务中验证困难的问题，通过句子级思考监督赋予奖励模型批判性思维能力，显著提升答案正确性和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在数学和编程等可验证领域取得进展，但在开放域问答等复杂任务中面临验证困难，现有方法过度依赖外部文档而缺乏批判性评估能力。

Method: 提出TRM模型，通过句子级思考监督，依次评估忠实度、推理和正确性，鼓励模型批判性利用外部和内部知识。

Result: 实验表明TRM显著提升错误句子识别能力，融入策略优化后在答案正确性和实用性方面取得显著提升。

Conclusion: TRM通过结构化奖励建模方法有效解决了复杂任务中的验证挑战，为提升模型批判性思维能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Through reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), large language
models have achieved substantial progress in domains with easily verifiable
outcomes, such as mathematics and coding. However, when applied to more complex
tasks like open-domain question answering, RLVR faces significant challenges
due to the difficulty of verifying correctness. The nuanced and ambiguous
nature of real-world knowledge makes it difficult to reliably evaluate
correctness in these settings, necessitating further abilities that extend
beyond mere logical consistency to encompass an understanding and assessment of
both external and internal knowledge. Recent work has primarily focused on
improving faithfulness, defined as semantic alignment with supporting
documents, which can cause models to rely excessively on external sources and
diminish their capacity for critical assessment. To address this, we propose
the Thinking-supervised Reward Model (TRM), which incorporates sentence-level
thinking supervision to endow reward models with critical thinking abilities.
Given a query, answer, and supporting documents, TRM first assesses the
faithfulness of each answer sentence to the supporting documents, and then
applies a reasoning step to evaluate sentence-level correctness. By structuring
reward modeling as a sequence of faithfulness, reasoning, and correctness
evaluations, TRM encourages models to critically assess and leverage both
external and internal knowledge. Experiments on reward signals demonstrate that
TRM substantially improves the identification of incorrect sentences, and
incorporating TRM into policy optimization leads to significant gains in both
answer correctness and usefulness.

### [5] [Emotion-Aligned Generation in Diffusion Text to Speech Models via Preference-Guided Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25416)
*Jiacheng Shi,Hongfei Du,Yangfan He,Y. Alicia Hong,Ye Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EASPO是一个后训练框架，通过中间去噪步骤的细粒度情感偏好对齐扩散TTS模型，实现可控的情感塑造


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有情感TTS方法依赖粗粒度标签或代理分类器，只能获得语句级反馈，无法进行细粒度情感控制

Method: 引入EASPM时间条件模型对噪声中间语音状态评分，自动构建偏好对，通过EASPO优化生成以匹配这些逐步偏好

Result: 实验表明在表达性和自然度方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: EASPO通过逐步偏好优化实现了细粒度情感控制，在情感TTS中表现出色

Abstract: Emotional text-to-speech seeks to convey affect while preserving
intelligibility and prosody, yet existing methods rely on coarse labels or
proxy classifiers and receive only utterance-level feedback. We introduce
Emotion-Aware Stepwise Preference Optimization (EASPO), a post-training
framework that aligns diffusion TTS with fine-grained emotional preferences at
intermediate denoising steps. Central to our approach is EASPM, a
time-conditioned model that scores noisy intermediate speech states and enables
automatic preference pair construction. EASPO optimizes generation to match
these stepwise preferences, enabling controllable emotional shaping.
Experiments show superior performance over existing methods in both
expressiveness and naturalness.

### [6] [SimulRAG: Simulator-based RAG for Grounding LLMs in Long-form Scientific QA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25459)
*Haozhou Xu,Dongxia Wu,Matteo Chinazzi,Ruijia Niu,Rose Yu,Yi-An Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了SimulRAG框架，通过科学模拟器检索增强LLM的长篇科学问答能力，解决幻觉问题，在信息量和事实性上显著优于传统RAG方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在长篇科学问答中容易产生幻觉，而科学模拟器作为验证假设的重要工具，有望通过检索增强生成来提升答案的可信度。

Method: 提出SimulRAG框架，包括通用模拟器检索接口（文本与数值模态转换）和基于不确定性估计与模拟器边界评估（UE+SBA）的声明级生成方法。

Result: 在气候科学和流行病学基准测试中，SimulRAG在信息量上比传统RAG基线提升30.4%，在事实性上提升16.3%。UE+SBA进一步提高了生成效率和质效。

Conclusion: SimulRAG框架通过科学模拟器检索有效缓解了LLM在长篇科学问答中的幻觉问题，显著提升了答案的事实性和信息量。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in solving scientific problems.
They can help generate long-form answers for scientific questions, which are
crucial for comprehensive understanding of complex phenomena that require
detailed explanations spanning multiple interconnected concepts and evidence.
However, LLMs often suffer from hallucination, especially in the challenging
task of long-form scientific question answering. Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) approaches can ground LLMs by incorporating external knowledge sources to
improve trustworthiness. In this context, scientific simulators, which play a
vital role in validating hypotheses, offer a particularly promising retrieval
source to mitigate hallucination and enhance answer factuality. However,
existing RAG approaches cannot be directly applied for scientific
simulation-based retrieval due to two fundamental challenges: how to retrieve
from scientific simulators, and how to efficiently verify and update long-form
answers. To overcome these challenges, we propose the simulator-based RAG
framework (SimulRAG) and provide a long-form scientific QA benchmark covering
climate science and epidemiology with ground truth verified by both simulations
and human annotators. In this framework, we propose a generalized simulator
retrieval interface to transform between textual and numerical modalities. We
further design a claim-level generation method that utilizes uncertainty
estimation scores and simulator boundary assessment (UE+SBA) to efficiently
verify and update claims. Extensive experiments demonstrate SimulRAG
outperforms traditional RAG baselines by 30.4% in informativeness and 16.3% in
factuality. UE+SBA further improves efficiency and quality for claim-level
generation.

practice. In this regard, tracking the progress of NLP research and
automatically analyzing the contributions of research papers provides key
insights into the nature of the field and the researchers. This study explores
the progress of African NLP (AfricaNLP) by asking (and answering) basic
research questions such as: i) How has the nature of NLP evolved over the last
two decades?, ii) What are the contributions of AfricaNLP papers?, and iii)
Which individuals and organizations (authors, affiliated institutions, and
funding bodies) have been involved in the development of AfricaNLP? We
quantitatively examine the contributions of AfricaNLP research using 1.9K NLP
paper abstracts, 4.9K author contributors, and 7.8K human-annotated
contribution sentences (AfricaNLPContributions) along with benchmark results.
Our dataset and continuously existing NLP progress tracking website provide a
powerful lens for tracing AfricaNLP research trends and hold potential for
generating data-driven literature surveys.

### [8] [Not Wrong, But Untrue: LLM Overconfidence in Document-Based Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25498)
*Nick Hagar,Wilma Agustianto,Nicholas Diakopoulos*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估ChatGPT、Gemini和NotebookLM在新闻写作任务中的幻觉问题，发现30%输出包含幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率是NotebookLM的三倍，主要问题是解释性过度自信而非虚构事实。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在新闻编辑室工作流程中应用日益增多，但其幻觉倾向对新闻业的核心实践（来源、归属、准确性）构成风险，需要评估这些工具在新闻报道任务中的表现。

Method: 使用300份与TikTok诉讼和政策相关的文档作为语料库，对三种工具进行报告式任务测试，变化提示语的具体性和上下文大小，使用分类法对句子级输出进行注释以测量幻觉类型和严重程度。

Result: 30%的模型输出包含至少一个幻觉，Gemini和ChatGPT的幻觉率约40%，是NotebookLM（13%）的三倍；大多数错误涉及解释性过度自信，模型添加了未经支持的来源描述并将归因观点转化为一般陈述。

Conclusion: LLMs与新闻业存在根本的认识论不匹配：新闻业要求每个主张都有明确来源，而LLMs无论证据支持如何都会生成权威性文本；建议开发具有强制准确归属架构的新闻编辑室工具，而非优化流畅性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in newsroom workflows, but
their tendency to hallucinate poses risks to core journalistic practices of
sourcing, attribution, and accuracy. We evaluate three widely used tools -
ChatGPT, Gemini, and NotebookLM - on a reporting-style task grounded in a
300-document corpus related to TikTok litigation and policy in the U.S. We vary
prompt specificity and context size and annotate sentence-level outputs using a
taxonomy to measure hallucination type and severity. Across our sample, 30% of
model outputs contained at least one hallucination, with rates approximately
three times higher for Gemini and ChatGPT (40%) than for NotebookLM (13%).
Qualitatively, most errors did not involve invented entities or numbers;
instead, we observed interpretive overconfidence - models added unsupported
characterizations of sources and transformed attributed opinions into general
statements. These patterns reveal a fundamental epistemological mismatch: While
journalism requires explicit sourcing for every claim, LLMs generate
authoritative-sounding text regardless of evidentiary support. We propose
journalism-specific extensions to existing hallucination taxonomies and argue
that effective newsroom tools need architectures that enforce accurate
attribution rather than optimize for fluency.

### [9] [Beyond WER: Probing Whisper's Sub-token Decoder Across Diverse Language Resource Levels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25516)
*Siyu Liang,Nicolas Ballier,Gina-Anne Levow,Richard Wright*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对Whisper多语言ASR模型的解码器进行细粒度分析，发现高资源语言在解码过程中具有更高的正确token排名概率、更大置信度和更低预测熵，而低资源语言在这些指标上表现较差，并在子token使用上显示出不同的聚类模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型多语言ASR模型取得了显著性能，但其端到端管道的内部机制，特别是在不同语言间的公平性和有效性方面仍然研究不足。

Method: 通过追踪beam搜索路径，捕获子token假设及其相关概率，使用PCA和t-SNE分析子token使用模式。

Result: 高资源语言在正确token排名概率、置信度、预测熵和候选多样性方面表现更好；低资源语言在这些指标上较差，但在子token使用上显示出受类型学影响的独特聚类模式。

Conclusion: 这种子token探测揭示了被聚合错误率掩盖的系统性解码差异，并为改善语音技术不平衡发展指明了针对性干预方向。

Abstract: While large multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models achieve
remarkable performance, the internal mechanisms of the end-to-end pipeline,
particularly concerning fairness and efficacy across languages, remain
underexplored. This paper introduces a fine-grained analysis of Whisper's
multilingual decoder, examining its sub-token hypotheses during transcription
across languages with various resource levels. Our method traces the beam
search path, capturing sub-token guesses and their associated probabilities.
Results reveal that higher resource languages benefit from higher likelihood of
the correct token being top-ranked, greater confidence, lower predictive
entropy, and more diverse alternative candidates. Lower resource languages fare
worse on these metrics, but also exhibit distinct clustering patterns in
sub-token usage sometimes influenced by typology in our PCA and t-SNE analysis.
This sub-token probing uncovers systematic decoding disparities masked by
aggregate error rates and points towards targeted interventions to ameliorate
the imbalanced development of speech technology.

TL;DR: MixtureVitae是一个开源预训练语料库，采用风险缓和的获取策略，结合公共领域和宽松许可文本，在保持法律合规的同时提供强大的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在最小化法律风险，同时提供强模型性能，减少对无差别网络爬取的依赖，为训练能力强的LLM提供实用且法律风险缓解的基础。

Method: 采用风险缓和的获取策略，结合公共领域和宽松许可文本，经过多阶段透明流程进行许可证感知过滤、安全质量筛选和领域感知混合。

Result: 在130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B参数规模的实验中，MixtureVitae训练的模型在标准基准测试中持续优于其他宽松许可数据集，在数学/代码任务上表现尤其出色。

Conclusion: 表明以宽松许可优先、风险缓解的数据策略为训练能力强的LLM提供了实用且法律风险缓解的基础，在不牺牲竞争力的前提下减少对无差别网络爬取的依赖。

Abstract: We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize
legal risk while providing strong model performance. MixtureVitae follows a
risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively
licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions
(e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources), alongside targeted
instruction, reasoning and synthetic data with documented provenance. We detail
a transparent, multi-stage pipeline for license-aware filtering, safety and
quality screening, and domain-aware mixing, and we release the dataset and
curation recipes to support reproducible research. In controlled experiments
using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures at
130M/400M/1.3B/1.7B parameters; training budgets of 50B and 300B tokens),
models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive
datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B/300B setting
they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM in the later stages of training.
Performance is particularly strong on math/code and competitive on QA tasks.
These results demonstrate that permissive-first, risk-mitigated data provides a
practical and legally mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing
reliance on indiscriminate web scraping without sacrificing competitiveness.

### [11] [Calibrating Verbalized Confidence with Self-Generated Distractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25532)
*Victor Wang,Elias Stengel-Eskin*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了DINCO方法，通过评估LLM的易受暗示性偏差来校准置信度估计，结合生成器-验证器不一致性和跨不兼容声明的连贯性，显著改善了LLM置信度校准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的置信度分数存在错误校准问题，模型在低准确率实例上表现出过度自信，这损害了用户信任和安全性。研究发现这种过度自信源于模型对信息较少的声明具有更高的易受暗示性。

Method: 引入Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO)，通过让模型在多个自生成的干扰项上独立表达置信度，并基于总置信度进行归一化来估计和校正易受暗示性偏差。同时利用生成器-验证器不一致性，将归一化验证器置信度与基于一致性的生成器置信度估计相结合。

Result: DINCO提供了更少饱和且更可用的置信度估计，在10次推理调用下优于100次调用的自一致性基线方法，采样无法弥补DINCO与基线之间的差距。

Conclusion: DINCO通过整合跨采样生成和跨不兼容声明验证的互补连贯性维度，有效改善了LLM置信度校准，为可信的AI系统提供了更好的置信度估计方法。

Abstract: Calibrated confidence estimates are necessary for large language model (LLM)
outputs to be trusted by human users. While LLMs can express their confidence
in human-interpretable ways, verbalized LLM-generated confidence scores have
empirically been found to be miscalibrated, reporting high confidence on
instances with low accuracy and thereby harming trust and safety. We
hypothesize that this overconfidence often stems from a given LLM's heightened
suggestibility when faced with claims that it encodes little information about;
we empirically validate this hypothesis, finding more suggestibility on
lower-accuracy claims. Building on this finding, we introduce
Distractor-Normalized Coherence (DINCO), which estimates and accounts for an
LLM's suggestibility bias by having the model verbalize its confidence
independently across several self-generated distractors (i.e. alternative
claims), and normalizes by the total verbalized confidence. To further improve
calibration, we leverage generator-validator disagreement, augmenting
normalized validator confidence with a consistency-based estimate of generator
confidence. Here, we frame the popular approach of self-consistency as
leveraging coherence across sampled generations, and normalized verbalized
confidence as leveraging coherence across validations on incompatible claims,
allowing us to integrate these complementary dimensions of coherence into
DINCO. Moreover, our analysis shows that DINCO provides less saturated -- and
therefore more usable -- confidence estimates, and that further sampling alone
cannot close the gap between DINCO and baselines, with DINCO at 10 inference
calls outperforming self-consistency at 100.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自我奖励评分标准的强化学习框架，通过模型自身作为评分者生成奖励信号来提升开放推理能力，在资源有限的情况下实现高效训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署需要开放评估，研究发现模型自身作为评分者能显著提升推理性能，且训练后的模型也成为了更强的评分者。

Method: 基于自我奖励评分标准的强化学习框架，使用模型自身生成基于评分标准的奖励信号进行训练，结合少量教师评分数据。

Result: 在Qwen3-32B上，仅使用4000样本的HealthBench Easy子集训练，就能在HealthBench Hard上超越GPT-5；加入少量教师评分数据可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: 该轻量级框架实现了更快、更资源高效的训练，同时超越了基线方法，为开放推理任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Open-ended evaluation is essential for deploying large language models in
real-world settings. In studying HealthBench, we observe that using the model
itself as a grader and generating rubric-based reward signals substantially
improves reasoning performance. Remarkably, the trained model also becomes a
stronger grader. Motivated by this, we introduce Self-Rewarding Rubric-Based
Reinforcement Learning for Open-Ended Reasoning, a lightweight framework that
enables faster and more resource-efficient training while surpassing baselines.
Remarkably, on Qwen3-32B, training with just the 4000-sample HealthBench Easy
subset is sufficient to obtain a model that exceeds GPT-5 on HealthBench Hard.
Incorporating a small amount of teacher-graded data further enhances
performance for less capable models.

TL;DR: PB-RLSVR框架通过使用高性能英语LLM作为"枢纽"模型生成参考回答，基于语义等价性奖励多语言模型，无需目标语言人工标注数据，显著缩小多语言推理性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习提升了LLM的推理能力，但这些进步主要局限于英语，导致不同语言间存在显著的性能差异，需要解决多语言推理的不平衡问题。

Method: 采用枢纽式强化学习框架，使用英语LLM生成参考回答，通过基于嵌入和机器翻译的跨语言语义奖励函数来训练多语言模型，实现推理能力的跨语言迁移。

Result: 在多个多语言推理基准测试中，PB-RLSVR显著优于传统PPO基线，Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3-32B的平均多语言性能分别提升16.41%和10.17%。

Conclusion: PB-RLSVR提供了一种强大且数据高效的方法来构建真正多语言推理代理，有效缩小了英语与其他语言之间的性能差距。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the reasoning abilities of Large
Language Models (LLMs), these gains are largely confined to English, creating a
significant performance disparity across languages. To address this, we
introduce Pivot-Based Reinforcement Learning with Semantically Verifiable
Rewards (PB-RLSVR), a novel framework that enhances multilingual reasoning by
circumventing the need for human-annotated data in target languages. Our
approach employs a high-performing English LLM as a "pivot" model to generate
reference responses for reasoning tasks. A multilingual model is then rewarded
based on the semantic equivalence of its responses to the English reference,
effectively transferring the pivot model's reasoning capabilities across
languages. We investigate several cross-lingual semantic reward functions,
including those based on embeddings and machine translation. Extensive
experiments on a suite of multilingual reasoning benchmarks show that our
method significantly narrows the performance gap between English and other
languages, substantially outperforming traditional PPO baselines. Specifically,
our PB-RLSVR framework improves the average multilingual performance of
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-32B by 16.41% and 10.17%, respectively,
demonstrating a powerful and data-efficient approach to building truly
multilingual reasoning agents.

Motivation: 研究动机是解释儿童在约4岁前经常省略主语的现象（空主语阶段），特别是儿童如何混淆祈使句空主语话语和陈述句，以及这种混淆如何促进暂时性空主语语法的发展。

Method: 使用变分学习器（Variational Learner）的修改版本，该版本适用于超集-子集语言，通过模拟模型来研究强制性主语语法的学习过程，并引入新的计算参数来测量误解程度。

Result: 模拟结果支持了Orfitelli和Hyams的假设，表明儿童对空主语话语的误解确实会导致暂时性空主语语法的形成。

Conclusion: 本研究为将计算模型整合到语法习得研究中提供了一个框架，强调了在语言发展研究中结合计算模型与其他关键发展因素的重要性。

Abstract: The empirically established null subject (NS) stage, lasting until about 4
years of age, involves frequent omission of subjects by children. Orfitelli and
Hyams (2012) observe that young English speakers often confuse imperative NS
utterances with declarative ones due to performance influences, promoting a
temporary null subject grammar. We propose a new computational parameter to
measure this misinterpretation and incorporate it into a simulated model of
obligatory subject grammar learning. Using a modified version of the
Variational Learner (Yang, 2012) which works for superset-subset languages, our
simulations support Orfitelli and Hyams' hypothesis. More generally, this study
outlines a framework for integrating computational models in the study of
grammatical acquisition alongside other key developmental factors.

*Colten DiIanni,Daniel Deutsch*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PDP是一种新颖的机器翻译元评估指标，通过使用成对差异而非原始分数来解决传统Pearson和Kendall方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统Pearson's ρ和Kendall's τ元评估方法在机器翻译评估中的局限性，提供更稳健的评分分布理解。

Method: 基于相关性的度量方法，利用所有片段的成对差异信息，将全局Pearson细化为片段内分数比较。

Result: 在WMT'24共享任务中，PDP能正确排序评估指标，与人类错误权重更一致，对随机噪声、片段偏差和系统偏差具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PDP是一种有效的机器翻译元评估指标，但对极端异常值敏感。

Abstract: This paper introduces Pairwise Difference Pearson (PDP), a novel
segment-level meta-evaluation metric for Machine Translation (MT) that address
limitations in previous Pearson's $\rho$-based and and Kendall's $\tau$-based
meta-evaluation approaches. PDP is a correlation-based metric that utilizes
pairwise differences rather than raw scores. It draws on information from all
segments for a more robust understanding of score distributions and uses
segment-wise pairwise differences to refine Global Pearson to intra-segment
score comparisons. Analysis on the WMT'24 shared task shows PDP properly ranks
sentinel evaluation metrics and better aligns with human error weightings than
previous work. Noise injection analysis demonstrates PDP's robustness to random
noise, segment bias, and system bias while highlighting its sensitivity to
extreme outliers.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究小规模视觉语言模型在幽默和浪漫风格上的数据效率，探索用最少偏好数据实现风格对齐的性能极限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于Transformer的视觉语言模型在零样本设置下难以生成特定风格（如幽默、浪漫）的图像描述，而获取偏好数据成本高昂，限制了模型能力的充分探索

Method: 研究小规模视觉语言模型的数据效率，通过少量偏好数据对模型进行风格对齐，探索实现风格饱和所需的最小数据量

Result: 定义了小规模视觉语言模型在幽默和浪漫风格上的性能极限，确定了实现风格对齐所需的最少偏好数据量

Conclusion: 该研究为小规模视觉语言模型的风格对齐能力提供了基准，揭示了在有限数据下实现特定风格生成的可行性

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly used to generate image captions in
specific styles, such as humor or romantic. However, these transformer-based
models often struggle with this subjective task in a zero-shot setting. While
preference data can be used to align them toward a desired style, such data is
expensive to acquire, limiting the ability to explore the models' full
capabilities. This work addresses this by studying the data efficiency of
aligning small vision-language models to humor and romantic styles. This
approach helps to define the performance limits of these models and determine
how little preference data is needed to achieve stylistic saturation,
benchmarking their capabilities and limitations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了RFG方法，无需显式过程奖励即可指导扩散大语言模型的推理轨迹，通过参数化增强模型和参考模型的似然比来实现奖励引导采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型在推理过程中需要逐步指导，但传统方法需要密集标注中间步骤的过程奖励，这在扩散模型中难以实现，因为其生成是无序的且中间状态是部分掩码的句子。

Method: RFG通过参数化增强模型和参考模型的似然比来隐式表示过程奖励，增强模型可通过RL或SFT后训练获得，无需额外奖励模型。

Result: 在四个数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，RFG在所有任务和模型类型上均取得显著提升，准确率最高提升9.2%。

Conclusion: RFG是一个通用的免训练框架，可在不依赖外部奖励模型的情况下扩展测试时推理能力。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have shown great potential in
large-scale language modeling, and there is an increasing interest in further
improving the capacity to solve complex problems by guiding the reasoning
process step by step. Common practice for autoregressive language models
typically learns a process reward model with dense annotation for each
intermediate step. However, this is challenging for dLLMs where the generation
is in an any-order fashion and intermediate states are partially masked
sentences. To this end, in this paper, we propose reward-free guidance (RFG), a
principled method for guiding the reasoning trajectory of dLLMs without
explicit process reward. The key idea of RFG is to parameterize the process
reward by log-likelihood ratios of the enhanced and reference dLLMs, where the
enhanced model can be easily obtained by any off-the-shelf dLLM that has been
post-trained with reinforcement learning (RL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT).
We provide theoretical justification that RFG induces the reward-guided
sampling distribution with no additional reward. We conduct comprehensive
experiments on four challenging mathematical reasoning and code generation
benchmarks using a diverse suite of dLLMs enhanced with various post-training
methods. RFG consistently yields significant improvements across all tasks and
model types, achieving accuracy gains of up to 9.2%. These findings establish
RFG as a general training-free framework that scales test-time reasoning
without reliance on external reward models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了Transformer架构作为概率测度间映射的数学特性，证明了Transformer可以表示满足特定条件的测度间映射，并与Vlasov方程的解映射建立了联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了从数学上统一分析Transformer架构的表达能力，研究其作为概率测度间映射的特性，并探索其与物理系统中相互作用粒子系统的联系。

Method: 通过将神经网络建模为概率测度上的映射，研究Transformer作为上下文映射的特性，分析其Fr\'echet导数的正则性条件，并与Vlasov方程的数学结构建立对应关系。

Result: 完整刻画了Transformer能够表示的测度间映射的特征：保持支撑基数且Fr\'echet导数的正则部分一致连续。证明了Transformer可以逼近任何连续上下文映射，且无限深度均值场测度理论Transformer可识别为Vlasov流。

Conclusion: Transformer架构在数学上具有明确的测度理论解释，能够表示一类特定的测度间映射，并与物理系统中的Vlasov方程存在深刻联系，这为理解Transformer的表达能力提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Transformers are deep architectures that define ``in-context maps'' which
enable predicting new tokens based on a given set of tokens (such as a prompt
in NLP applications or a set of patches for a vision transformer). In previous
work, we studied the ability of these architectures to handle an arbitrarily
large number of context tokens. To mathematically, uniformly analyze their
expressivity, we considered the case that the mappings are conditioned on a
context represented by a probability distribution which becomes discrete for a
finite number of tokens. Modeling neural networks as maps on probability
measures has multiple applications, such as studying Wasserstein regularity,
proving generalization bounds and doing a mean-field limit analysis of the
dynamics of interacting particles as they go through the network. In this work,
we study the question what kind of maps between measures are transformers. We
fully characterize the properties of maps between measures that enable these to
be represented in terms of in-context maps via a push forward. On the one hand,
these include transformers; on the other hand, transformers universally
approximate representations with any continuous in-context map. These
properties are preserving the cardinality of support and that the regular part
of their Fr\'{e}chet derivative is uniformly continuous. Moreover, we show that
the solution map of the Vlasov equation, which is of nonlocal transport type,
for interacting particle systems in the mean-field regime for the Cauchy
problem satisfies the conditions on the one hand and, hence, can be
approximated by a transformer; on the other hand, we prove that the
measure-theoretic self-attention has the properties that ensure that the
infinite depth, mean-field measure-theoretic transformer can be identified with
a Vlasov flow.

*Samar Haider,Amir Tohidi,Jenny S. Wang,Timothy Dörr,David M. Rothschild,Chris Callison-Burch,Duncan J. Watts*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 开发了一个大规模、实时的数据集和计算框架，用于系统研究新闻媒体中的选择和框架偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流新闻机构通过选择报道哪些话题以及如何框架议题来影响公众认知，但大规模测量这些微妙的媒体偏见仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 整合大型语言模型与可扩展的近实时新闻抓取，提取结构化注释（政治倾向、语调、主题、文章类型、重大事件等），每天处理数百篇文章。

Result: 创建了一个包含15万+文章的语料库，在句子、文章和发布者多个层面量化报道维度，并发布了交互式网络平台。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可重复的大规模媒体偏见研究方法，为未来研究提供实证资源，支持学术研究和改善媒体问责的实际努力。

Abstract: Mainstream news organizations shape public perception not only directly
through the articles they publish but also through the choices they make about
which topics to cover (or ignore) and how to frame the issues they do decide to
cover. However, measuring these subtle forms of media bias at scale remains a
challenge. Here, we introduce a large, ongoing (from January 1, 2024 to
present), near real-time dataset and computational framework developed to
enable systematic study of selection and framing bias in news coverage. Our
pipeline integrates large language models (LLMs) with scalable, near-real-time
news scraping to extract structured annotations -- including political lean,
tone, topics, article type, and major events -- across hundreds of articles per
day. We quantify these dimensions of coverage at multiple levels -- the
sentence level, the article level, and the publisher level -- expanding the
ways in which researchers can analyze media bias in the modern news landscape.
In addition to a curated dataset, we also release an interactive web platform
for convenient exploration of these data. Together, these contributions
establish a reusable methodology for studying media bias at scale, providing
empirical resources for future research. Leveraging the breadth of the corpus
over time and across publishers, we also present some examples (focused on the
150,000+ articles examined in 2024) that illustrate how this novel data set can
reveal insightful patterns in news coverage and bias, supporting academic
research and real-world efforts to improve media accountability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QFrBLiMP是一个包含1,761对魁北克法语最小对立对的语料库，用于评估LLMs在20种语法现象上的语言知识。通过比较LLMs与人类在语法判断上的表现，发现模型规模越大语法能力越强，但在需要深层语义理解的任务上仍存在明显差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在魁北克法语特定语法现象上的语言知识，填补现有法语评估基准的空白，特别是针对魁北克法语变体的评估需求。

Method: 从魁北克政府官方在线资源中提取句子，手动修改创建最小对立对，由12名魁北克法语母语者进行语法标注，比较LLMs与人类在语法判断上的概率分配表现。

Result: 模型语法能力随规模增大而提升，但所有模型在需要深层语义理解的现象上表现不佳，与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: LLMs在魁北克法语语法判断上表现出与模型规模相关的进步，但在语义理解方面仍有根本性局限，需要进一步改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Quebec-French Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal
Pairs (QFrBLiMP), a corpus designed to evaluate the linguistic knowledge of
LLMs on prominent grammatical phenomena in Quebec-French. QFrBLiMP consists of
1,761 minimal pairs annotated with 20 linguistic phenomena. Specifically, these
minimal pairs have been created by manually modifying sentences extracted from
an official online resource maintained by a Qu\'ebec government institution.
Each pair is annotated by twelve Quebec-French native speakers, who select the
sentence they feel is grammatical amongst the two. These annotations are used
to compare the competency of LLMs with that of humans. We evaluate different
LLMs on QFrBLiMP and MultiBLiMP-Fr by observing the rate of higher
probabilities assigned to the sentences of each minimal pair for each category.
We find that while grammatical competence scales with model size, a clear
hierarchy of difficulty emerges. All benchmarked models consistently fail on
phenomena requiring deep semantic understanding, revealing a critical
limitation and a significant gap compared to human performance on these
specific tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出基准和谐度概念，衡量模型在基准测试各子领域性能的均匀分布程度，认为高和谐度是基准测试的理想属性，能更可靠地评估模型能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基准测试的可靠性对模型评估和科学发展至关重要，当前基准测试可能存在某些子领域过度影响总体性能的问题，导致评估结果失真。

Method: 从分布视角研究基准可靠性，引入基准和谐度指标，在19个多项选择基准和5个模型家族上进行实证分析，将基准映射到和谐度的均值-方差平面上。

Result: 分析显示不和谐的基准可能产生误导性结果，如ARC-Easy基准中生物概念问题过度影响总体准确率，掩盖了地理、物理等其他重要子领域。

Conclusion: 建议在报告准确率的同时报告和谐度，将评估从简单的性能平均值转向更稳健、分布可靠的性能测量框架。

Abstract: Benchmarks shape scientific conclusions about model capabilities and steer
model development. This creates a feedback loop: stronger benchmarks drive
better models, and better models demand more discriminative benchmarks.
Ensuring benchmark reliability is therefore essential for trustworthy
evaluation and meaningful progress. In this work, we study benchmark
reliability from a distributional perspective and introduce benchmark harmony,
which measures how uniformly a model's performance is distributed across the
subdomains of a benchmark. We posit that high harmony is a desirable benchmark
property, indicating that the aggregate metric reflects uniform competence
across subdomains. Across 19 multiple-choice benchmarks and five model
families, we map each benchmark onto a mean-variance plane of harmony computed
across models, where high mean and low variance signal more reliable
evaluation. Our analysis shows that less harmonious benchmarks can give
misleading results, since overall accuracy may be disproportionately influenced
by specific subdomains. For instance, ARC-Easy is overwhelmed by questions on
Biological Concepts, overshadowing other critical subdomains such as Geography,
Physics, Chemistry, and Environmental Science. By recommending that harmony
should be reported alongside accuracy, we reframe evaluation from simple
performance averages to a more robust, distributionally reliable measurement of
performance.

TL;DR: 提出BiasUnlearn框架，通过双路径遗忘机制协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，实现针对性去偏，同时防止偏见极性反转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数修改去偏方法显著降低文本连贯性和任务准确性，基于提示的去偏方法仅对预定义触发词有效，无法解决模型参数中根深蒂固的刻板联想。

Method: 采用双路径遗忘机制，协调刻板印象遗忘与反刻板印象保留，通过对抗性遗忘集和动态数据集交换防止偏见极性反转。

Result: 在多个语言模型和评估基准上的实验表明，BiasUnlearn在减轻语言模型偏见的同时保持语言建模能力方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 去偏权重可在模型变体间迁移，证实偏见表示在预训练期间固化并在微调阶段持续存在。

Abstract: Many studies have shown various biases targeting different demographic groups
in language models, amplifying discrimination and harming fairness. Recent
parameter modification debiasing approaches significantly degrade core
capabilities such as text coherence and task accuracy. And Prompt-based
debiasing methods, only effective for predefined trigger words, fail to address
deeply embedded stereotypical associations in model parameters. In this paper,
we propose BiasUnlearn, a novel model debiasing framework which achieves
targeted debiasing via dual-pathway unlearning mechanisms coordinating
stereotype forgetting with anti-stereotype retention, while preventing bias
polarity reversal through adversarial forget set and dynamic dataset swapping.
We conducted extensive experiments with multiple language models across various
evaluation benchmarks. The results show that BiasUnlearn outperforms existing
methods in mitigating bias in language models while retaining language modeling
capabilities. Further experiments reveal that debiasing weights are
transferable across model variants, confirming that bias representations become
entrenched during pre-training and persist through fine-tuning phases.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LD-MoLE提出了一种可学习的动态路由机制，用于LoRA专家混合模型，通过可微分路由函数和闭式解替代传统的TopK选择，实现自适应、令牌依赖和层级的专家分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法大多依赖传统的TopK路由，需要仔细的超参数调优，并为每个令牌分配固定数量的专家，限制了模型的灵活性和性能。

Method: 使用可微分路由函数和闭式解替代非可微分的TopK选择，引入分析性稀疏控制目标来正则化激活专家数量，实现自适应、令牌依赖和层级的专家分配。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B和Llama-3.2-3B模型上的广泛实验表明，LD-MoLE在多样化基准测试中取得了最高的平均分数，优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: LD-MoLE不仅实现了优越性能，还展示了学习令牌依赖和层级专家分配的能力，为参数高效微调提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) with mixture-of-experts (MoE) is an effective strategy for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to the downstream tasks. However, most existing
approaches rely on conventional TopK routing, which requires careful
hyperparameter tuning and assigns a fixed number of experts to each token. In
this work, we propose LD-MoLE, a Learnable Dynamic routing mechanism for
Mixture of LoRA Experts that enables adaptive, token-dependent, and layer-wise
expert allocation. Our method replaces the non-differentiable TopK selection
with a differentiable routing function and a closed-form solution. Moreover,
our design allows the model to adaptively determine the number of experts to
activate for each token at different layers. In addition, we introduce an
analytical sparsity control objective to regularize the number of activated
experts. Extensive experiments on the Qwen3-1.7B and Llama-3.2-3B models show
that LD-MoLE achieves the highest average scores compared to state-of-the-art
baselines, across a diverse set of benchmarks. Our method not only achieves
superior performance, but also demonstrates the ability to learn
token-dependent and layer-wise expert allocation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种评估数学原子能力的新范式，将数学智能分解为两个维度的原子能力：四个数学领域（代数、几何、分析、拓扑）的领域特定能力，以及不同层次的逻辑能力（概念理解、前向多步推理、反例驱动的后向推理）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型主要依赖扩大训练数据集，但无法确定模型是否真正掌握了数学概念和推理原理，还是仅仅记住了训练数据。受人类将复杂问题分解为基本原子能力的启发，需要一种新的评估范式。

Method: 将数学能力分解为原子能力单元，为每个原子能力单元构建相应的训练和评估数据集，通过大量实验研究不同原子能力之间的相互影响，探索如何激发所需的特定原子能力。

Result: 在先进模型上的评估和实验结果显示，模型在各种原子能力上表现出不同的性能，原子能力之间存在有趣的相互作用，为模型认知提供了新的见解。

Conclusion: 将数学智能分解为原子组件具有重要意义，为模型认知提供了新见解，并指导训练策略朝着更高效、可迁移和认知基础的"原子思维"范式发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in
mathematical reasoning capabilities. However, we argue that current large-scale
reasoning models primarily rely on scaling up training datasets with diverse
mathematical problems and long thinking chains, which raises questions about
whether LLMs genuinely acquire mathematical concepts and reasoning principles
or merely remember the training data. In contrast, humans tend to break down
complex problems into multiple fundamental atomic capabilities. Inspired by
this, we propose a new paradigm for evaluating mathematical atomic
capabilities. Our work categorizes atomic abilities into two dimensions: (1)
field-specific abilities across four major mathematical fields, algebra,
geometry, analysis, and topology, and (2) logical abilities at different
levels, including conceptual understanding, forward multi-step reasoning with
formal math language, and counterexample-driven backward reasoning. We propose
corresponding training and evaluation datasets for each atomic capability unit,
and conduct extensive experiments about how different atomic capabilities
influence others, to explore the strategies to elicit the required specific
atomic capability. Evaluation and experimental results on advanced models show
many interesting discoveries and inspirations about the different performances
of models on various atomic capabilities and the interactions between atomic
capabilities. Our findings highlight the importance of decoupling mathematical
intelligence into atomic components, providing new insights into model
cognition and guiding the development of training strategies toward a more
efficient, transferable, and cognitively grounded paradigm of "atomic
thinking".

Conclusion: 该方法为敏感领域的合成文本生成提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text anonymization is essential for responsibly developing and deploying AI
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, social services, and law. In this
work, we propose a novel methodology for privacy-preserving synthetic text
generation that leverages the principles of de-identification and the Hiding In
Plain Sight (HIPS) theory. Our approach introduces entity-aware control codes
to guide controllable generation using either in-context learning (ICL) or
prefix tuning. The ICL variant ensures privacy levels consistent with the
underlying de-identification system, while the prefix tuning variant
incorporates a custom masking strategy and loss function to support scalable,
high-quality generation. Experiments on legal and clinical datasets demonstrate
that our method achieves a strong balance between privacy protection and
utility, offering a practical and effective solution for synthetic text
generation in sensitive domains.

Motivation: 现有AI心理咨询研究采用一次性生成方法合成多轮对话样本，导致治疗保真度低且无法捕捉每个回复背后的决策逻辑。

Method: 1. 渐进式对话合成：从客户自述中提取目标、资源和解决方案，组织成结构化大纲，逐步生成阶段对齐的咨询对话；2. 记忆驱动动态规划：整合记忆增强、全局规划和策略推理，通过多智能体优化器为每个对话轮次附加显式思维链。

Result: 广泛的实验和人工评估表明，CATCH显著提升了AI心理咨询的保真度和逻辑连贯性。

Conclusion: CATCH框架有效解决了现有AI心理咨询方法的局限性，为高质量心理咨询对话生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recently, advancements in AI counseling based on large language models have
shown significant progress. However, existing studies employ a one-time
generation approach to synthesize multi-turn dialogue samples, resulting in low
therapy fidelity and failing to capture the decision-making rationale behind
each response. In this work, we propose CATCH, a novel data synthesis framework
designed to address these challenges. Specifically, to improve therapy
fidelity, we introduce the Progressive Dialogue Synthesis strategy, which
extracts goals, resources, and solutions from a client's self-report, organizes
them into structured outlines, and then incrementally generates stage-aligned
counseling dialogues. To capture decision-making rationale behind each
response, we propose the Memory-Driven Dynamic Planning thinking pattern that
integrates memory enhancement, global planning, and strategy reasoning; a
collaborative multi-agent optimizer then leverages MDP to attach explicit
chain-of-thought to each dialogue turn. Extensive experiments and human
evaluations demonstrate that CATCH significantly enhances fidelity and logical
coherence in AI counseling.

Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) depends heavily on large-scale,
high-quality instruction-following and reinforcement datasets. However,
generating such data through human annotation is prohibitively time-consuming
particularly for domain-specific tasks like telecom network troubleshooting,
where accurate responses require deep technical expertise and contextual
understanding. In this paper, we present a fully automated, retrieval-augmented
pipeline for generating synthetic question-answer (QA) pairs grounded in
structured domain knowledge. Our multi-stage framework integrates a retriever,
base generator, and refinement model to synthesize and enhance QA pairs using
documents retrieved from a domain-specific knowledge graph. To ensure data
quality, we employ customized RAGAS-based scoring to filter low-quality
samples, producing a high-quality dataset suitable for reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT). We demonstrate our approach in a real-world telecom scenario
focused on radio access network (RAN) troubleshooting. The resulting pipeline
generates complex, context-rich troubleshooting solution plans without human
intervention. This work offers a scalable solution for building instruction and
reinforcement datasets in specialized domains, significantly reducing
dependence on manual labeling while maintaining high technical fidelity.

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发多语言细粒度希望语音检测模型做出了贡献，可用于增强积极内容审核和促进支持性在线社区，同时讨论了低资源语言检测的挑战和改进泛化能力的潜力。

Abstract: The detection of hopeful speech in social media has emerged as a critical
task for promoting positive discourse and well-being. In this paper, we present
a machine learning approach to multiclass hope speech detection across multiple
languages, including English, Urdu, and Spanish. We leverage transformer-based
models, specifically XLM-RoBERTa, to detect and categorize hope speech into
three distinct classes: Generalized Hope, Realistic Hope, and Unrealistic Hope.
Our proposed methodology is evaluated on the PolyHope dataset for the
PolyHope-M 2025 shared task, achieving competitive performance across all
languages. We compare our results with existing models, demonstrating that our
approach significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms
of macro F1 scores. We also discuss the challenges in detecting hope speech in
low-resource languages and the potential for improving generalization. This
work contributes to the development of multilingual, fine-grained hope speech
detection models, which can be applied to enhance positive content moderation
and foster supportive online communities.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TruthRL是一个强化学习框架，通过三元奖励机制直接优化大语言模型的真实性，显著减少幻觉并提高真实性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化准确性时会放大幻觉，而鼓励弃权的方法又过于保守，牺牲正确答案。两种极端都损害了真实性。

Method: 使用GRPO实现TruthRL，采用三元奖励机制区分正确答案、幻觉和弃权，激励模型不仅提供正确回答，还能在不确定时弃权。

Result: 在四个知识密集型基准测试中，TruthRL相比普通RL显著减少幻觉28.9%，提高真实性21.1%，在各种骨干模型下表现一致。

Conclusion: TruthRL在准确性和真实性方面都实现了强劲表现，证明了学习目标设计对于开发真实LLMs的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on
factoid question answering, they are still prone to hallucination and
untruthful responses, particularly when tasks demand information outside their
parametric knowledge. Indeed, truthfulness requires more than accuracy --
models must also recognize uncertainty and abstain when unsure to avoid
hallucinations. This presents a fundamental challenge for existing methods:
approaches that optimize for accuracy often amplify hallucinations, while those
that encourage abstention can become overly conservative, sacrificing correct
answers. Both extremes ultimately compromise truthfulness. In this work, we
present TruthRL, a general reinforcement learning (RL) framework that directly
optimizes the truthfulness of LLMs. Specifically, we implement TruthRL using
GRPO with a simple yet effective ternary reward that distinguishes correct
answers, hallucinations, and abstentions. It incentivizes models to reduce
hallucinations not only by providing correct responses, but also by enabling
abstention when uncertain, thereby improving truthfulness. Extensive
experiments across four knowledge-intensive benchmarks show that, compared to
vanilla RL, TruthRL significantly reduces hallucinations by 28.9% and improves
truthfulness by 21.1%, with consistent gains across various backbone models
(e.g., Qwen, Llama) under both retrieval and non-retrieval setups. In-depth
ablation study demonstrates that vanilla accuracy-driven methods, such as
supervised fine-tuning or RL with a binary reward, struggle to balance factual
correctness and uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed truthfulness-driven
TruthRL achieves strong performance in both accuracy and truthfulness,
underscoring the importance of learning objective design for developing
truthful LLMs.

*Obed Junias,Prajakta Kini,Theodora Chaspari*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究比较了基于DNN嵌入和LLM少样本学习在抑郁症检测中的算法偏见，发现LLM在性能表现和减少性别偏见方面优于DNN模型，但在种族偏见方面仍有挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在抑郁症自动检测中的算法偏见，特别关注性别和种族/民族相关的社会人口统计学差异，旨在评估和缓解这些偏见。

Method: 使用DAIC-WOZ临床访谈数据，比较DNN嵌入模型和LLM少样本学习方法。对DNN模型应用公平感知损失函数，对LLM探索不同提示框架和样本数量的上下文学习。

Result: LLM在抑郁症分类表现上优于DNN模型，特别是对西班牙裔参与者。LLM显示出比DNN嵌入更低的性别偏见，但种族差异仍然存在。最差组损失在DNN中实现性能与公平性的更好平衡，而LLM中伦理框架提示有助于缓解1-shot设置中的性别偏见。

Conclusion: LLM在抑郁症检测中具有更好的性能和更低的性别偏见，但种族偏见问题仍然棘手。需要继续开发有效的偏见缓解策略，特别是针对种族/民族差异。

Abstract: This paper investigates algorithmic bias in language-based models for
automated depression detection, focusing on socio-demographic disparities
related to gender and race/ethnicity. Models trained using deep neural networks
(DNN) based embeddings are compared to few-shot learning approaches with large
language models (LLMs), evaluating both performance and fairness on clinical
interview transcripts from the Distress Analysis Interview Corpus/Wizard-of-Oz
(DAIC-WOZ). To mitigate bias, fairness-aware loss functions are applied to
DNN-based models, while in-context learning with varied prompt framing and shot
counts is explored for LLMs. Results indicate that LLMs outperform DNN-based
models in depression classification, particularly for underrepresented groups
such as Hispanic participants. LLMs also exhibit reduced gender bias compared
to DNN-based embeddings, though racial disparities persist. Among
fairness-aware techniques for mitigating bias in DNN-based embeddings, the
worst-group loss, which is designed to minimize loss for the worst-performing
demographic group, achieves a better balance between performance and fairness.
In contrast, the fairness-regularized loss minimizes loss across all groups but
performs less effectively. In LLMs, guided prompting with ethical framing helps
mitigate gender bias in the 1-shot setting. However, increasing the number of
shots does not lead to further reductions in disparities. For race/ethnicity,
neither prompting strategy nor increasing $N$ in $N$-shot learning effectively
reduces disparities.

Result: 研究揭示了当前LLM在处理低资源语言中专业知识任务时的优势和局限性，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估和改进LLM在生物学领域的性能提供了全面资源，特别是在罗马尼亚语等低资源语言环境中，强调了领域特定术语和语言细微差别理解的重要性。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant
potential across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However,
their performance in domain-specific applications and non-English languages
remains less explored. This study introduces a novel Romanian-language dataset
for multiple-choice biology questions, carefully curated to assess LLM
comprehension and reasoning capabilities in scientific contexts. Containing
approximately 14,000 questions, the dataset provides a comprehensive resource
for evaluating and improving LLM performance in biology.
  We benchmark several popular LLMs, analyzing their accuracy, reasoning
patterns, and ability to understand domain-specific terminology and linguistic
nuances. Additionally, we perform comprehensive experiments to evaluate the
impact of prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and other optimization techniques on
model performance. Our findings highlight both the strengths and limitations of
current LLMs in handling specialized knowledge tasks in low-resource languages,

Result: 实验表明ReTAG提高了响应质量，同时显著减少了推理时间。

Conclusion: ReTAG有效解决了全局语义理解中的关键挑战，在质量和效率方面均有显著改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in question answering have led to substantial progress in
tasks such as multi-hop reasoning. However, global sensemaking-answering
questions by synthesizing information from an entire corpus remains a
significant challenge. A prior graph-based approach to global sensemaking lacks
retrieval mechanisms, topic specificity, and incurs high inference costs. To
address these limitations, we propose ReTAG, a Retrieval-Enhanced,
Topic-Augmented Graph framework that constructs topic-specific subgraphs and
retrieves the relevant summaries for response generation. Experiments show that
ReTAG improves response quality while significantly reducing inference time
compared to the baseline. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RLVR的大规模推理模型存在"过度思考"问题，即生成长推理路径却无性能提升。现有的长度惩罚方法因轨迹级奖励与令牌级优化的不匹配而失败。

Method: 提出DECS框架，包含：(1) 首个解耦的令牌级奖励机制，精确惩罚冗余令牌；(2) 新颖的课程批量调度策略，平衡效率与效果。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，DECS实现了推理令牌减少50%以上，同时保持甚至提升模型性能。

Conclusion: DECS证明可以在不损害模型推理能力的前提下，显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: While large reasoning models trained with critic-free reinforcement learning
and verifiable rewards (RLVR) represent the state-of-the-art, their practical
utility is hampered by ``overthinking'', a critical issue where models generate
excessively long reasoning paths without any performance benefit. Existing
solutions that penalize length often fail, inducing performance degradation due
to a fundamental misalignment between trajectory-level rewards and token-level
optimization. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, DECS, built on our
theoretical discovery of two previously unaddressed flaws in current length
rewards: (1) the erroneous penalization of essential exploratory tokens and (2)
the inadvertent rewarding of partial redundancy. Our framework's innovations
include (i) a first-of-its-kind decoupled token-level reward mechanism that
surgically distinguishes and penalizes redundant tokens, and (ii) a novel
curriculum batch scheduling strategy to master the efficiency-efficacy
equilibrium. Experimental results show DECS can achieve a dramatic reduction in
reasoning tokens by over 50\% across seven benchmarks while simultaneously
maintaining or even improving performance. It demonstrates conclusively that
substantial gains in reasoning efficiency can be achieved without compromising
a model's underlying reasoning power.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过视觉保真度和对比性两个质量评分函数来评估VLM生成的解释质量，以帮助用户在不查看视觉上下文的情况下更准确地判断VLM预测的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当用户无法查看视觉上下文时（如视障用户），VLM预测的自然语言解释可能误导用户过度依赖不准确的预测。需要一种方法来评估解释质量，防止用户对错误预测产生过度依赖。

Method: 提出两个质量评分函数：视觉保真度（衡量解释对视觉上下文的忠实度）和对比性（衡量解释区分模型预测与合理替代方案的能力）。在A-OKVQA和VizWiz任务上进行评估，并与用户研究结合验证效果。

Result: 在A-OKVQA和VizWiz任务上，提出的质量评分函数比现有解释质量指标与模型正确性更相关。用户研究表明，显示质量评分可将用户预测VLM正确性的准确率提高11.1%，错误相信错误预测的比率降低15.4%。

Conclusion: 解释质量评分在促进用户对VLM预测的适当依赖方面具有实用价值，能够有效帮助用户在不查看视觉上下文的情况下更准确地评估VLM预测的可靠性。

Abstract: When people query Vision-Language Models (VLMs) but cannot see the
accompanying visual context (e.g. for blind and low-vision users), augmenting
VLM predictions with natural language explanations can signal which model
predictions are reliable. However, prior work has found that explanations can
easily convince users that inaccurate VLM predictions are correct. To remedy
undesirable overreliance on VLM predictions, we propose evaluating two
complementary qualities of VLM-generated explanations via two quality scoring
functions. We propose Visual Fidelity, which captures how faithful an
explanation is to the visual context, and Contrastiveness, which captures how
well the explanation identifies visual details that distinguish the model's
prediction from plausible alternatives. On the A-OKVQA and VizWiz tasks, these
quality scoring functions are better calibrated with model correctness than
existing explanation qualities. We conduct a user study in which participants
have to decide whether a VLM prediction is accurate without viewing its visual
context. We observe that showing our quality scores alongside VLM explanations
improves participants' accuracy at predicting VLM correctness by 11.1%,
including a 15.4% reduction in the rate of falsely believing incorrect
predictions. These findings highlight the utility of explanation quality scores
in fostering appropriate reliance on VLM predictions.

Motivation: 大语言模型经常在科学事实上产生幻觉，严重影响其可信度，需要超越二元事实性评估的细粒度基准。

Method: 构建包含科学正确答案和非事实对应答案的数据集，标注精确的错误范围和错误类型，支持幻觉检测、错误定位和修正的三阶段评估。

Result: 测试9个最先进的大语言模型，发现性能有限（约50%准确率），即使是GPT-4o也难以区分事实和幻觉的科学答案。

Conclusion: 需要细粒度的人工验证基准来检测和修正领域特定情境中的科学幻觉，对LLM-as-judge评估范式的可靠性提出质疑。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently confabulate scientific facts,severely
undermining their trustworthiness. Addressing this challenge requires
benchmarks that go beyond binary factuality and enable fine-grained evaluation.
We introduce \textbf{ReFACT} (\textit{Reddit False And Correct Texts}), a

scientific domains for the detection of scientific confabulation. Each instance
includes both a scientifically correct answer and a non-factual counterpart
annotated with \textbf{precise error spans and error-types}. ReFACT enables
multi-stage evaluation: (1) confabulation detection, (2) fine-grained error
localization, and (3) correction. We benchmark 9 state-of-the-art LLMs,
revealing limited performance ($\sim$50\% accuracy). Even top models such as
GPT-4o fail to distinguish factual from confabulated scientific answers,
raising concerns about the reliability of \textit{LLM-as-judge} evaluation

TL;DR: 本文提出了RoleConflictBench基准，用于评估大语言模型在角色冲突这种复杂社会困境中的情境敏感性，发现LLMs虽然对情境线索有一定响应能力，但决策主要受社会角色固有偏见主导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在人类决策中影响力增强，需要理解它们在复杂社会情境中的行为。角色冲突代表固有的模糊社会困境，需要情境敏感性来识别和权衡可能改变决策优先级的线索。

Method: 使用三阶段流水线生成超过13K个现实角色冲突场景，涵盖65个角色，系统性地改变相关期望（责任和义务）和情境紧急程度，分析10个不同LLMs的模型选择。

Result: LLMs对情境线索的敏感性不足，决策主要受社会角色固有偏见主导，表现出对家庭和职业领域角色的偏好，以及对男性角色和亚伯拉罕宗教的优先考虑。

Conclusion: LLMs在角色冲突情境中的决策能力有限，存在显著的社会偏见，需要进一步改进模型的社会推理能力。

Abstract: Humans often encounter role conflicts -- social dilemmas where the
expectations of multiple roles clash and cannot be simultaneously fulfilled. As
large language models (LLMs) become increasingly influential in human
decision-making, understanding how they behave in complex social situations is
essential. While previous research has evaluated LLMs' social abilities in
contexts with predefined correct answers, role conflicts represent inherently
ambiguous social dilemmas that require contextual sensitivity: the ability to
recognize and appropriately weigh situational cues that can fundamentally alter
decision priorities. To address this gap, we introduce RoleConflictBench, a
novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' contextual sensitivity in complex
social dilemmas. Our benchmark employs a three-stage pipeline to generate over
13K realistic role conflict scenarios across 65 roles, systematically varying
their associated expectations (i.e., their responsibilities and obligations)
and situational urgency levels. By analyzing model choices across 10 different
LLMs, we find that while LLMs show some capacity to respond to these contextual
cues, this sensitivity is insufficient. Instead, their decisions are
predominantly governed by a powerful, inherent bias related to social roles
rather than situational information. Our analysis quantifies these biases,
revealing a dominant preference for roles within the Family and Occupation
domains, as well as a clear prioritization of male roles and Abrahamic
religions across most evaluatee models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏评估文本特定方面（如个性化质量）的指标，研究者通常依赖多个大语言模型进行元评估，这会因模型内部偏见而增加成本。

Method: 引入PerQ方法，这是一种计算效率高的文本个性化质量评估方法。

Result: 通过比较大小语言模型生成能力的案例研究，证明了PerQ指标在研究中的实用性。

Conclusion: PerQ方法有效减少了资源浪费，为文本个性化质量评估提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Since no metrics are available to evaluate specific aspects of a text, such
as its personalization quality, the researchers often rely solely on large
language models to meta-evaluate such texts. Due to internal biases of
individual language models, it is recommended to use multiple of them for
combined evaluation, which directly increases costs of such meta-evaluation. In
this paper, a computationally efficient method for evaluation of
personalization quality of a given text (generated by a language model) is
introduced, called PerQ. A case study of comparison of generation capabilities
of large and small language models shows the usability of the proposed metric
in research, effectively reducing the waste of resources.

TL;DR: Mem-alpha是一个基于强化学习的框架，用于训练LLM代理有效管理复杂内存系统，通过交互和反馈优化内存构建，显著提升长期信息理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于内存增强的LLM代理依赖预定义指令和工具进行内存更新，但语言模型缺乏确定存储哪些信息、如何结构化以及何时更新的能力，导致内存构建不理想和信息丢失。

Method: 提出Mem-alpha强化学习框架，构建专门的训练数据集涵盖多样化多轮交互模式，代理处理顺序信息块，学习提取和存储相关内容并更新内存系统，奖励信号来自下游问答准确性。

Result: Mem-alpha在现有内存增强代理基线基础上取得显著改进，尽管仅在最多30k token的实例上训练，但能泛化到超过400k token的序列（超过训练长度的13倍），显示出强大鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Mem-alpha框架通过强化学习有效训练代理管理复杂内存系统，解决了LLM代理在长期信息理解中的内存管理挑战，具有出色的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are constrained by limited context windows,
necessitating external memory systems for long-term information understanding.
Current memory-augmented agents typically depend on pre-defined instructions
and tools for memory updates. However, language models may lack the ability to
determine which information to store, how to structure it, and when to update
it, especially as memory systems become more complex. This results in
suboptimal memory construction and information loss. To this end, we propose
Mem-alpha, a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to effectively
manage complex memory systems through interaction and feedback. We also
construct a specialized training dataset spanning diverse multi-turn
interaction patterns paired with comprehensive evaluation questions designed to
teach effective memory management. During training, agents process sequential
information chunks, learn to extract and store relevant content, then update
the memory system. The reward signal derives from downstream question-answering
accuracy over the full interaction history, directly optimizing for memory
construction. To illustrate the effectiveness of our training framework, we
design a memory architecture comprising core, episodic, and semantic
components, equipped with multiple tools for memory operations. Empirical
evaluation demonstrates that Mem-alpha achieves significant improvements over
existing memory-augmented agent baselines. Despite being trained exclusively on
instances with a maximum length of 30k tokens, our agents exhibit remarkable
generalization to sequences exceeding 400k tokens, over 13x the training
length, highlighting the robustness of Mem-alpha.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型一直使用Softmax作为路由器函数，但这被视为既定假设而非基于原理的设计选择。作者发现MoE与Nadaraya-Watson回归具有相同数学形式，且FFN和MoE都可视为该回归的特例，这启发了新型路由器设计。

Method: 提出KERN路由器函数，这是一种FFN风格的路由器，基于Nadaraya-Watson回归理论，使用ReLU激活和ℓ2归一化，能够泛化Sigmoid和Softmax路由器。

Result: 在MoE和LLM上的综合实验验证了所提出的FFN风格路由器函数的有效性。

Conclusion: KERN路由器为MoE模型提供了一种有效的Softmax替代方案，基于理论洞察且无需额外计算成本。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a cornerstone in recent state-of-the-art
large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, MoE relies on $\mathrm{Softmax}$
as the router score function to aggregate expert output, a designed choice that
has persisted from the earliest MoE models to modern LLMs, and is now widely
regarded as standard practice. However, the necessity of using
$\mathrm{Softmax}$ to project router weights into a probability simplex remains
an unchallenged assumption rather than a principled design choice. In this
work, we first revisit the classical Nadaraya-Watson regression and observe
that MoE shares the same mathematical formulation as Nadaraya-Watson
regression. Furthermore, we show that both feed-forward neural network (FFN)
and MoE can be interpreted as a special case of Nadaraya-Watson regression,
where the kernel function corresponds to the input neurons of the output layer.
Motivated by these insights, we propose the \textbf{zero-additional-cost}
Kernel Inspired Router with Normalization (KERN), an FFN-style router function,
as an alternative to $\mathrm{Softmax}$. We demonstrate that this router
generalizes both $\mathrm{Sigmoid}$- and $\mathrm{Softmax}$-based routers.
\textbf{Based on empirical observations and established practices in FFN
implementation, we recommend the use of $\mathrm{ReLU}$ activation and
$\ell_2$-normalization in $\mathrm{KERN}$ router function.} Comprehensive
experiments in MoE and LLM validate the effectiveness of the proposed FFN-style
router function \methodNorm.

Motivation: 虽然Transformer编码器在序列标注中占主导地位，但一些新兴架构在语言建模中表现出潜力，需要研究它们在不同复杂度的序列标注任务中的适应性。

Method: 在多种结构复杂度、标签空间和token依赖关系的标注任务上评估不同架构，包括跨语言评估。

Result: 之前观察到的在简单设置中的强性能不能很好地跨语言或数据集泛化，也无法扩展到更复杂的结构化任务。

Conclusion: 新兴架构在序列标注任务中的表现受任务复杂度和语言环境的影响，需要更全面的评估来理解其适用性。

Abstract: Pretrained Transformer encoders are the dominant approach to sequence
labeling. While some alternative architectures-such as xLSTMs, structured
state-space models, diffusion models, and adversarial learning-have shown
promise in language modeling, few have been applied to sequence labeling, and
mostly on flat or simplified tasks. We study how these architectures adapt
across tagging tasks that vary in structural complexity, label space, and token
dependencies, with evaluation spanning multiple languages. We find that the
strong performance previously observed in simpler settings does not always
generalize well across languages or datasets, nor does it extend to more
complex structured tasks.

*Takumi Goto,Yusuke Sakai,Taro Watanabe*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文针对语法错误纠正的无参考评估指标提出对抗攻击策略，揭示现有指标在面对恶意系统时的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无参考GEC评估指标虽然与人工评价相关性高，但无法有效评估旨在获取不合理高分的对抗系统，这会误导用户选择GEC系统，损害自动评估的可靠性。

Method: 针对SOME、Scribendi、IMPARA和基于LLM的四种无参考指标，提出对抗攻击策略，构建能够获得不合理高分的对抗系统。

Result: 实验证明，本文提出的对抗系统在四种无参考指标上都超越了当前最先进水平，成功获得了不合理的评估高分。

Conclusion: 现有无参考GEC评估指标在面对对抗攻击时表现脆弱，亟需开发更鲁棒的评估方法以确保自动评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Reference-free evaluation metrics for grammatical error correction (GEC) have
achieved high correlation with human judgments. However, these metrics are not
designed to evaluate adversarial systems that aim to obtain unjustifiably high
scores. The existence of such systems undermines the reliability of automatic
evaluation, as it can mislead users in selecting appropriate GEC systems. In
this study, we propose adversarial attack strategies for four reference-free
metrics: SOME, Scribendi, IMPARA, and LLM-based metrics, and demonstrate that
our adversarial systems outperform the current state-of-the-art. These findings
highlight the need for more robust evaluation methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAGferee方法将问答数据集转化为偏好对，训练专门针对RAG场景的奖励模型，在ContextualJudgeBench上超越现有70B+模型，提升15.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型基于通用偏好数据训练，在RAG场景中难以准确评估回答的忠实性、相关性、拒绝能力、完整性和简洁性，缺乏专门的RAG偏好数据集和模型。

Method: 提出RAGferee方法，将问答数据集重新构建为偏好对，强调基于上下文的真实性而非风格特征，训练参数规模从7B到24B的上下文奖励模型。

Result: 使用仅4K样本的小型偏好数据集，训练的RAG专用奖励模型在ContextualJudgeBench上达到最先进性能，超越基于2.4M样本训练的70B+通用模型。

Conclusion: RAGferee方法能有效创建RAG专用偏好数据集，训练的小规模模型在RAG评估任务上优于大规模通用模型，证明任务特定训练的重要性。

Abstract: Existing Reward Models (RMs), typically trained on general preference data,
struggle in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) settings, which require
judging responses for faithfulness to retrieved context, relevance to the user
query, appropriate refusals when context is insufficient, completeness and
conciseness of information. To address the lack of publicly available
RAG-centric preference datasets and specialised RMs, we introduce RAGferee, a
methodology that repurposes question-answering (QA) datasets into preference
pairs that prioritise groundedness over stylistic features, enabling the
training of contextual RMs better suited to judging RAG responses. Using
RAGferee, we curate a small preference dataset of 4K samples and fine-tune RMs
ranging from 7B to 24B parameters. Our RAG-centric RMs achieve state-of-the-art
performance on ContextualJudgeBench, surpassing existing 70B+ RMs trained on
much larger (up to 2.4M samples) general corpora, with an absolute improvement
of +15.5%.

*Baoxin Wang,Yumeng Luo,Yixuan Wang,Dayong Wu,Wanxiang Che,Shijin Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出RE²方法，通过语法错误解释而非文本相似度来检索参考示例，提升中文语法错误纠正性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖文本相似度检索示例，但这种方法经常与实际错误模式不匹配，检索到词汇相似但语法无关的句子

Method: RE²方法使用语法错误解释来选择参考示例，为LLMs提供更相关的上下文，并创建了高质量的语法错误解释数据集

Result: 在两个CGEC数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法有效提升了中文语法错误纠正的性能

Conclusion: 基于语法错误解释的示例检索方法比传统文本相似度方法更有效，为CGEC和GEE研究提供了有价值的资源

Abstract: The primary objective of Chinese grammatical error correction (CGEC) is to
detect and correct errors in Chinese sentences. Recent research shows that
large language models (LLMs) have been applied to CGEC with significant
results. For LLMs, selecting appropriate reference examples can help improve
their performance. However, existing methods predominantly rely on text
similarity for example retrieval, a strategy that frequently mismatches actual
error patterns and retrieves lexically similar yet grammatically irrelevant
sentences. To address this problem, we propose a method named RE$^2$, which
retrieves appropriate examples with explanations of grammatical errors. Instead
of using text similarity of the input sentence, we use explanations of
grammatical errors to select reference examples, which are used by LLMs to
improve the performance of CGEC. We conduct experiments on two CGEC datasets
and create a high-quality grammatical error explanation (GEE) dataset, which is
not only used in our research but also serves as a valuable resource for future
studies in both CGEC and GEE. The experimental results on the two datasets
indicate that our proposed method effectively improves the performance of CGEC.

*Arash Marioriyad,Shaygan Adim,Nima Alighardashi,Mahdieh Soleymani Banghshah,Mohammad Hossein Rohban*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过系统实验发现，LLMs在链式思维推理中严重依赖提示中的捷径线索，而非真正忠实推理。正确提示显著提升准确率，错误提示则降低表现，且模型对提示的承认程度因提示类型而异，表明其推理过程缺乏忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs在链式思维推理中生成的推理过程是否忠实于实际计算，还是仅仅基于提示中的捷径线索构建的事后叙述。

Method: 在四个数据集上对GPT-4o和Gemini-2-Flash进行系统实验，通过控制提示的正确性、呈现风格和复杂度来评估任务准确性和提示承认度。

Result: 1) 正确提示显著提升准确率，错误提示降低准确率；2) 方程提示常被引用，原始提示常被默默采用；3) 奉承风格促进公开承认，泄露风格提高准确率但隐藏依赖。

Conclusion: LLM推理过程系统性受到提示中捷径线索的影响，这掩盖了推理的忠实性，揭示了当前CoT方法在真实推理能力评估上的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on chain-of-thought (CoT)
prompting to solve mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. Yet, a central
question remains: to what extent are these generated rationales \emph{faithful}
to the underlying computations, rather than post-hoc narratives shaped by hints
that function as answer shortcuts embedded in the prompt? Following prior work
on hinted vs.\ unhinted prompting, we present a systematic study of CoT
faithfulness under controlled hint manipulations. Our experimental design spans
four datasets (AIME, GSM-Hard, MATH-500, UniADILR), two state-of-the-art models
(GPT-4o and Gemini-2-Flash), and a structured set of hint conditions varying in
correctness (correct and incorrect), presentation style (sycophancy and data
leak), and complexity (raw answers, two-operator expressions, four-operator
expressions). We evaluate both task accuracy and whether hints are explicitly
acknowledged in the reasoning. Our results reveal three key findings. First,
correct hints substantially improve accuracy, especially on harder benchmarks
and logical reasoning, while incorrect hints sharply reduce accuracy in tasks
with lower baseline competence. Second, acknowledgement of hints is highly
uneven: equation-based hints are frequently referenced, whereas raw hints are
often adopted silently, indicating that more complex hints push models toward
verbalizing their reliance in the reasoning process. Third, presentation style
matters: sycophancy prompts encourage overt acknowledgement, while leak-style
prompts increase accuracy but promote hidden reliance. This may reflect
RLHF-related effects, as sycophancy exploits the human-pleasing side and data
leak triggers the self-censoring side. Together, these results demonstrate that
LLM reasoning is systematically shaped by shortcuts in ways that obscure
faithfulness.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出RE-Searcher方法，通过目标导向规划和自我反思来增强LLM搜索代理在复杂搜索环境中的鲁棒性，解决查询微小变化导致性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在实际部署中受限于知识截止、幻觉和交互模式限制。虽然外部搜索工具能缓解这些问题，但复杂搜索环境中查询的微小变化会导致推理偏离正确轨迹并放大错误。

Method: 提出RE-Searcher方法：在搜索过程中明确阐述具体搜索目标，然后反思检索到的证据是否满足该目标。结合目标导向规划和自我反思来抵抗复杂环境中的虚假线索。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了搜索准确性并达到最先进结果。扰动研究进一步证明了对噪声或误导性外部信号的强韧性，减轻了搜索过程的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为将LLM驱动的代理集成到更复杂的交互环境中并实现更自主的决策提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive question answering
and reasoning, yet their real-world deployment remains constrained by knowledge
cutoff, hallucination, and limited interaction modalities. Augmenting LLMs with
external search tools helps alleviate these issues, but it also exposes agents
to a complex search environment in which small, plausible variations in query
formulation can steer reasoning into unproductive trajectories and amplify
errors. We present a systematic analysis that quantifies how environmental
complexity induces fragile search behaviors and, in turn, degrades overall
performance. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective
approach to instantiate a search agent, RE-Searcher. During search, RE-Searcher
explicitly articulates a concrete search goal and subsequently reflects on
whether the retrieved evidence satisfies that goal. This combination of
goal-oriented planning and self-reflection enables RE-Searcher to resist
spurious cues in complex search environments and perform robust search.
Extensive experiments show that our method improves search accuracy and
achieves state-of-the-art results. Perturbation studies further demonstrate
substantial resilience to noisy or misleading external signals, mitigating the
fragility of the search process. We believe these findings offer practical
guidance for integrating LLM-powered agents into more complex interactive
environments and enabling more autonomous decision-making.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文填补了中欧语言机器生成文本检测的空白，建立了首个针对该地区的检测方法基准，发现监督微调的检测器在中欧语言中表现最佳且对混淆攻击最具抵抗力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器生成文本检测研究主要集中于英语，导致现有检测器几乎无法用于非英语语言，特别是中欧语言的研究非常缺乏，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 建立了首个针对中欧语言的检测方法基准，通过多领域、多生成器和多语言评估，比较不同训练语言组合的性能表现，并测试检测方法的对抗鲁棒性。

Result: 监督微调的检测器在中欧语言中表现最佳，同时也是对混淆攻击最具抵抗力的方法。

Conclusion: 针对特定语言进行监督微调的检测器在中欧语言机器生成文本检测任务中表现最优，且具有最强的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine-generated text detection, as an important task, is predominantly
focused on English in research. This makes the existing detectors almost
unusable for non-English languages, relying purely on cross-lingual
transferability. There exist only a few works focused on any of Central
European languages, leaving the transferability towards these languages rather
unexplored. We fill this gap by providing the first benchmark of detection
methods focused on this region, while also providing comparison of
train-languages combinations to identify the best performing ones. We focus on
multi-domain, multi-generator, and multilingual evaluation, pinpointing the
differences of individual aspects, as well as adversarial robustness of
detection methods. Supervised finetuned detectors in the Central European
languages are found the most performant in these languages as well as the most
resistant against obfuscation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DyFlow是一个动态工作流生成框架，通过设计器和执行器组件，能够根据任务需求和实时反馈自适应构建和调整推理流程，显著提升了跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的智能体系统大多依赖手动设计的工作流程，限制了跨任务适应性。少数自动化方法通常绑定特定数据集或查询类型，且对中间反馈利用有限，导致系统鲁棒性和推理深度不足。

Method: DyFlow包含设计器和执行器两个核心组件。设计器将复杂问题分解为子目标序列，基于中间输出和反馈动态规划下一步；执行器使用具有上下文感知参数化的动态操作符执行每个操作，实现灵活且语义基础的推理。

Result: 在社交推理、生物医学任务、数学问题求解和代码生成等多个领域的系统评估显示，DyFlow显著优于现有基线方法，实现了显著的Pass@k改进，并展现出强大的跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: DyFlow通过动态工作流生成机制有效解决了现有方法的局限性，为构建高效且可泛化的LLM智能体系统提供了有前景的解决方案。代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Agent systems based on large language models (LLMs) have shown great
potential in complex reasoning tasks, but building efficient and generalizable
workflows remains a major challenge. Most existing approaches rely on manually
designed processes, which limits their adaptability across different tasks.
While a few methods attempt automated workflow generation, they are often tied
to specific datasets or query types and make limited use of intermediate
feedback, reducing system robustness and reasoning depth. Moreover, their
operations are typically predefined and inflexible. To address these
limitations, we propose DyFlow, a dynamic workflow generation framework that
adaptively constructs and adjusts reasoning procedures based on task
requirements and real-time intermediate feedback, thereby enhancing cross-task
generalization. DyFlow consists of two core components: a designer and an
executor. The designer decomposes complex problems into a sequence of sub-goals
defined by high-level objectives and dynamically plans the next steps based on
intermediate outputs and feedback. These plans are then carried out by the
executor, which executes each operation using dynamic operators with
context-aware parameterization, enabling flexible and semantically grounded
reasoning. We systematically evaluate DyFlow across diverse domains, including
social reasoning, biomedical tasks, mathematical problem solving, and code
generation. Results demonstrate that DyFlow significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving substantial Pass@k improvements and exhibiting robust
generalization across diverse domains. The code is publicly available at

*Arash Marioriyad,Mohammad Hossein Rohban,Mahdieh Soleymani Baghshah*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现当前LLM作为自动评估器存在严重偏见，会基于提示中的表面线索（如来源和时间）而非内容质量做出判断，且很少承认这些偏见因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证LLM作为自动评估器是否能够基于响应质量进行忠实判断，以及是否明确承认影响决策的因素。

Method: 使用ELI5和LitBench两个评估数据集，构建100对比较任务，给响应分配来源线索（人类、专家、LLM、未知）和时间线索（旧1950年vs新2025年），使用GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5-Flash作为评估器。

Result: 两个模型都表现出强烈的新近偏见（偏爱新响应）和明确的来源层次（专家>人类>LLM>未知），在GPT-4o和LitBench中尤为明显，且很少承认这些线索的影响。

Conclusion: 当前LLM-as-a-judge系统容易受捷径影响且不忠实，在研究和部署中作为评估器的可靠性受到严重削弱。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as automatic judges to
evaluate system outputs in tasks such as summarization, dialogue, and creative
writing. A faithful judge should base its verdicts solely on response quality
and explicitly acknowledge the factors shaping its decision. We show that
current LLM judges fail on both counts by relying on shortcuts introduced in
the prompt. Our study uses two evaluation datasets: ELI5, a benchmark for
long-form question answering, and LitBench, a recent benchmark for creative
writing. Both datasets provide pairwise comparisons, where the evaluator must
choose which of two responses is better. From each dataset we construct 100
pairwise judgment tasks and employ two widely used models, GPT-4o and
Gemini-2.5-Flash, as evaluators in the role of LLM-as-a-judge. For each pair,
we assign superficial cues to the responses, provenance cues indicating source
identity (Human, Expert, LLM, or Unknown) and recency cues indicating temporal
origin (Old, 1950 vs. New, 2025), while keeping the rest of the prompt fixed.
Results reveal consistent verdict shifts: both models exhibit a strong recency
bias, systematically favoring new responses over old, as well as a clear
provenance hierarchy (Expert > Human > LLM > Unknown). These biases are
especially pronounced in GPT-4o and in the more subjective and open-ended
LitBench domain. Crucially, cue acknowledgment is rare: justifications almost
never reference the injected cues, instead rationalizing decisions in terms of
content qualities. These findings demonstrate that current LLM-as-a-judge
systems are shortcut-prone and unfaithful, undermining their reliability as
evaluators in both research and deployment.

TL;DR: 提出LENS框架，在LLM的潜在嵌入空间中直接合成偏好数据，通过VAE学习结构化潜在表示并进行受控扰动，高效生成多样化、语义一致的合成偏好对，显著优于基于文本的增强方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 奖励建模对于将大语言模型与人类偏好对齐至关重要，但通常受限于偏好数据的高昂成本。现有的文本数据合成方法计算开销大。

Method: 使用变分自编码器(VAE)学习响应嵌入的结构化潜在表示，在潜在空间中进行受控扰动并解码回嵌入空间，生成合成偏好对，避免昂贵的文本生成和标注。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，潜在空间合成显著优于基于文本的增强方法，生成速度快18倍，使用的模型小16,000倍，同时提供理论保证证明合成对近似保留原始偏好排序并改进奖励模型泛化。

Conclusion: LENS为通过高效数据增强提升奖励建模提供了可扩展且有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Reward modeling, crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human
preferences, is often bottlenecked by the high cost of preference data.
Existing textual data synthesis methods are computationally expensive. We
propose a novel framework LENS for synthesizing preference data directly in the
LLM's latent embedding space. Our method employs a Variational Autoencoder
(VAE) to learn a structured latent representation of response embeddings. By
performing controlled perturbations in this latent space and decoding back to
the embedding space, we efficiently generate diverse, semantically consistent
synthetic preference pairs, bypassing costly text generation and annotation. We
provide theoretical guarantees that our synthesized pairs approximately
preserve original preference ordering and improve reward model generalization.
Empirically, our latent-space synthesis significantly outperforms text-based
augmentation on standard benchmarks, achieving superior results while being 18x
faster in generation and using a 16,000x smaller model. Our work offers a
scalable and effective alternative for enhancing reward modeling through
efficient data augmentation. Code is publicly available at

Method: 构建包含详细证明要求的39个问题，配备最终答案子问题，在模拟研究环境中使用工具（如网络搜索和数学软件）进行代理式评估。

Result: 当前LLM在较易的研究级问题上表现良好，但在更具挑战性的问题上仍有困难。Grok-4在最终答案子问题上准确率52%，GPT-5在证明生成上表现最佳，22%问题完全正确。

Conclusion: IMProofBench将作为动态基准与数学社区合作持续发展，确保其相关性以评估下一代LLM。

Abstract: As the mathematical capabilities of large language models (LLMs) improve, it
becomes increasingly important to evaluate their performance on research-level
tasks at the frontier of mathematical knowledge. However, existing benchmarks
are limited, as they focus solely on final-answer questions or high-school
competition problems. To address this gap, we introduce IMProofBench, a private
benchmark consisting of 39 peer-reviewed problems developed by expert
mathematicians. Each problem requires a detailed proof and is paired with
subproblems that have final answers, supporting both an evaluation of
mathematical reasoning capabilities by human experts and a large-scale
quantitative analysis through automated grading. Furthermore, unlike prior
benchmarks, the evaluation setup simulates a realistic research environment:
models operate in an agentic framework with tools like web search for
literature review and mathematical software such as SageMath. Our results show
that current LLMs can succeed at the more accessible research-level questions,
but still encounter significant difficulties on more challenging problems.
Quantitatively, Grok-4 achieves the highest accuracy of 52% on final-answer
subproblems, while GPT-5 obtains the best performance for proof generation,
achieving a fully correct solution for 22% of problems. IMProofBench will
continue to evolve as a dynamic benchmark in collaboration with the
mathematical community, ensuring its relevance for evaluating the next
generation of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏明确的交互策略优化，依赖统一提示导致次优结果，需要更有效的策略学习机制。

Method: 分层框架：规划器选择策略（推荐、解释、鼓励等），执行器在偏好和事实专家指导下生成响应，使用基于LLM奖励的强化学习进行策略学习。

Result: 实验表明RSO优于现有最先进基线，验证了分层策略优化的有效性。

Conclusion: RSO框架通过策略分解和强化学习有效提升了对话推荐系统的性能，为交互策略优化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRSs) provide personalized
recommendations through multi-turn interactions. With the strong reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), applying them to CRSs has become
promising. Yet, existing methods often lack explicit optimization of
interaction strategies, relying instead on unified prompts, which can yield
suboptimal outcomes. We propose Reinforced Strategy Optimization (RSO), a
hierarchical framework that decomposes response generation into macro-level
strategy planning and micro-level adaptation within a network-of-experts. A
Planner selects strategies (e.g., recommend, explain, encourage), while an
Actor generates responses guided by auxiliary experts for preferences and
factual grounding. This disentanglement enables more tractable learning. To
address limited multi-turn data, we model strategy learning as reinforcement
learning with an LLM-based reward for exploration. Experiments show RSO
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of
hierarchical strategy optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当LLM处理训练领域之外的文本时，通用领域的分词器无法有效处理领域特定术语，导致分词效率低下、处理速度下降。

Method: 设计了一种算法来扩展预训练分词器的词汇表，添加领域特定词汇，同时保证分词效率不会降低。

Result: 在真实电商用例中，增强后的分词器显著缩短输入序列长度达20%，减少下游任务的推理延迟，同时保持预测质量。

Conclusion: 词汇表适应能有效提升LLM在专业领域的处理效率，具有广泛的实用价值。

Abstract: When using an LLM to process text outside the training domain(s), an often
overlooked factor is vocabulary mismatch, where the general-domain tokenizer
fails to capture frequent domain-specific terms, leading to higher token
fertility and thus a decrease in processing speed due to suboptimal sub-word
splits.
  We address this limitation by augmenting the pretrained vocabulary with a set
of domain-specific tokens. To this end, we design an algorithm that extends an
existing tokenizer while guaranteeing it never decreases tokenization
efficiency: every input sequence is segmented into at most the same number of
tokens as before.
  Evaluated on real-world e-Commerce use-cases, the augmented tokenizer
significantly shortens input sequences by up to 20% and reduces inference
latency on downstream tasks while preserving predictive quality. We further
analyze secondary effects, such as the impact on forward pass speed and the
rate at which the model adopts the newly introduced tokens, to illustrate the
broader benefits of vocabulary adaptation.

Conclusion: 揭示了多智能体辩论中的过度竞争问题，为理解和治理AI社区涌现的社会动态提供了重要见解，并形成了LLM排行榜来表征顶级模型。

Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems demonstrate great potential for tackling
complex problems, but how competition shapes their behavior remains
underexplored. This paper investigates the over-competition in multi-agent
debate, where agents under extreme pressure exhibit unreliable, harmful
behaviors that undermine both collaboration and task performance. To study this
phenomenon, we propose HATE, the Hunger Game Debate, a novel experimental
framework that simulates debates under a zero-sum competition arena. Our
experiments, conducted across a range of LLMs and tasks, reveal that
competitive pressure significantly stimulates over-competition behaviors and
degrades task performance, causing discussions to derail. We further explore
the impact of environmental feedback by adding variants of judges, indicating
that objective, task-focused feedback effectively mitigates the
over-competition behaviors. We also probe the post-hoc kindness of LLMs and
form a leaderboard to characterize top LLMs, providing insights for
understanding and governing the emergent social dynamics of AI community.

effectiveness in real-world clinical applications remains underexplored. To
address this, we present CliniBench, the first benchmark that enables
comparability of well-studied encoder-based classifiers and generative LLMs for
discharge diagnosis prediction from admission notes in MIMIC-IV dataset. Our
extensive study compares 12 generative LLMs and 3 encoder-based classifiers and
demonstrates that encoder-based classifiers consistently outperform generative

strategies for in-context learning from similar patients and find that they
provide notable performance improvements for generative LLMs.

Conclusion: VietBinoculars在越南语LLM生成文本检测方面表现出色，特别是在特殊修改的提示策略下，能够有效应对日益复杂的LLM生成内容检测挑战。

Abstract: The rapid development research of Large Language Models (LLMs) based on
transformer architectures raises key challenges, one of them being the task of
distinguishing between human-written text and LLM-generated text. As
LLM-generated textual content, becomes increasingly complex over time, and
resembles human writing, traditional detection methods are proving less
effective, especially as the number and diversity of LLMs continue to grow with
new models and versions being released at a rapid pace. This study proposes
VietBinoculars, an adaptation of the Binoculars method with optimized global
thresholds, to enhance the detection of Vietnamese LLM-generated text. We have
constructed new Vietnamese AI-generated datasets to determine the optimal
thresholds for VietBinoculars and to enable benchmarking. The results from our
experiments show results show that VietBinoculars achieves over 99\% in all two
domains of accuracy, F1-score, and AUC on multiple out-of-domain datasets. It
outperforms the original Binoculars model, traditional detection methods, and
other state-of-the-art approaches, including commercial tools such as ZeroGPT

Motivation: 现代物流管理系统需要高效的路径规划，OCVRP（开放容量车辆路径问题）旨在为服务地理分布客户的车辆寻找最优配送路线，且车辆无需在配送后返回仓库。

Method: 使用Python开发两种算法的实现，基于自定义数据集进行性能评估，比较路由效率、计算时间和可扩展性。

Result: ACO在路由参数方面更灵活，而OR-Tools运行速度更快、更一致且需要更少的输入。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于为可扩展的实时物流系统选择合适的路由策略。

Abstract: In modern logistics management systems, route planning requires high
efficiency. The Open Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (OCVRP) deals with
finding optimal delivery routes for a fleet of vehicles serving geographically
distributed customers, without requiring the vehicles to return to the depot
after deliveries. The present study is comparative in nature and speaks of two
algorithms for OCVRP solution: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), a nature-inspired
metaheuristic; and Google OR-Tools, an industry-standard toolkit for
optimization. Both implementations were developed in Python and using a custom
dataset. Performance appraisal was based on routing efficiency, computation
time, and scalability. The results show that ACO allows flexibility in routing
parameters while OR-Tools runs much faster with more consistency and requires
less input. This could help choose among routing strategies for scalable
real-time logistics systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实知识图谱中经常出现新实体，且显式类型信息往往缺乏或不完整、粗粒度、稀疏且容易出错，需要能够泛化到未见实体的方法。

Method: 提出TyleR方法，利用预训练语言模型对节点表示进行语义增强，通过子图结构进行归纳链接预测，不依赖显式类型信息。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，TyleR在类型注释稀缺和图连接稀疏的场景下优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型能够有效丰富节点表示中的隐式类型信号，为缺乏显式类型信息的归纳链接预测提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Inductive link prediction is emerging as a key paradigm for real-world
knowledge graphs (KGs), where new entities frequently appear and models must
generalize to them without retraining. Predicting links in a KG faces the
challenge of guessing previously unseen entities by leveraging generalizable
node features such as subgraph structure, type annotations, and ontological
constraints. However, explicit type information is often lacking or incomplete.
Even when available, type information in most KGs is often coarse-grained,
sparse, and prone to errors due to human annotation. In this work, we explore
the potential of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to enrich node
representations with implicit type signals. We introduce TyleR, a Type-less yet
type-awaRe approach for subgraph-based inductive link prediction that leverages
PLMs for semantic enrichment. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that TyleR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in scenarios with scarce type
annotations and sparse graph connectivity. To ensure reproducibility, we share

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法需要复杂的数据混合和重复实验以获得最佳泛化性能，存在效率低下的问题。

Method: 使用零学习率训练在通用数据上获取全局梯度，在领域训练中进行梯度增强和动态训练步长校正，结合退火学习建立微调流程。

Result: 在多个任务和基础模型上，DBA相比传统微调在联合性能上平均提升5.8%，GPU时间减少91.0%。

Conclusion: DBA提供了一种高效通用的微调解决方案，无需通用数据参与退火过程，消除了数据混合导致的重复实验。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) fine-tuning shows excellent implications.
However, vanilla fine-tuning methods often require intricate data mixture and
repeated experiments for optimal generalization. To address these challenges
and streamline the training process, we propose an efficient and universal
solution, Dynamic Boosted Annealing (DBA). We obtain a global gradient through
zero-learning-rate training on general data, which is subsequently employed for
gradient boosting and dynamic training step correction during domain training.
In conjunction with annealing learning, we end up establishing a fine-tuning
pipeline that relies solely on domain data without collapse. By evaluating both
general and domain-specific performance across multiple tasks on several
popular base models, DBA achieves an average improvement of 5.8% in joint
performance over vanilla fine-tuning. Furthermore, since general data is no
longer involved in annealing, repeated experiments led by data mixture are also
eliminated. According to our tests, the DBA method can reduce GPU hours by
91.0% compared to the vanilla method.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了结合语义初始化和规划损失的语音语言模型，通过自监督特征初始化语音token、应用轻量对齐损失以及针对鲁棒性和内容规划的辅助目标训练，实现了稳健且一致的语音生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发能够实现稳健和一致语音生成的语音语言模型，通过语义初始化和规划损失来平衡声学稳定性和语义基础。

Method: 使用自监督特征初始化语音token，应用轻量对齐损失，并采用稀疏化和辅助目标训练，训练了三个模型：0.7B纯语音模型、1.0B纯语音模型和1.0B文本语音交错模型。

Result: 声学研究表明纯语音模型在说话人、性别、情感、房间和背景因素方面实现了最高的一致性，超过了更大的系统。交错模型改善了词汇和句法探测以及语义-声学对齐，但降低了一致性。线性探测显示初始化使模型偏向内容结构，同时牺牲了韵律细节。

Conclusion: 结果表明，语言模型侧的设计和训练组合可以控制声学稳定性和语义基础之间的平衡，而无需更改分词器或运行时架构。

Abstract: We study speech language models that incorporate semantic initialization and
planning losses to achieve robust and consistent generation. Our approach
initializes speech tokens with self-supervised features, applies a light
alignment loss, and trains with thinning and auxiliary objectives that target
robustness and content planning. We train three models: a 0.7B speech-only
model, a 1.0B speech-only model, and a 1.0B interleaved model with both text
and speech. Acoustic studies show that the speech-only models achieve the
highest consistency across speaker, gender, sentiment, room, and background
factors, surpassing larger systems. Interleaving improves lexical and syntactic
probes and semantic--acoustic alignment but reduces consistency. Linear probes
show that our initialization biases the model toward content structure while
trading off prosody detail. These results show that LM-side design and training
mix control the balance between acoustic stability and semantic grounding
without changes to the tokenizer or runtime architecture. A demo and model
weights are available for exploration.

Conclusion: APP框架提供了一种无需人工监督的任务导向对话摘要方法，通过LLM自我评估和选择机制有效提升摘要质量。

Abstract: Dialogue summarization aims to distill the core meaning of a conversation
into a concise text. This is crucial for reducing the complexity and noise
inherent in dialogue-heavy applications. While recent approaches typically
train language models to mimic human-written summaries, such supervision is
costly and often results in outputs that lack task-specific focus limiting
their effectiveness in downstream applications, such as medical tasks. In this
paper, we propose \app, a framework for task-oriented utility-based dialogue
summarization. \app starts by generating multiple summaries and task-oriented
question-answer pairs from a dialogue in a zero-shot manner using a pool of
large language models (LLMs). The quality of the generated summaries is
evaluated by having LLMs answer task-related questions before \textit{(i)}
selecting the best candidate answers and \textit{(ii)} identifying the most
informative summary based on these answers. Finally, we fine-tune the best LLM
on the selected summaries. When validated on multiple datasets, \app
demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving competitive results in various
zero-shot settings, rivaling fully-supervised State-of-the-Art (SotA) methods.

Conclusion: Feedback Forensics提供了显式评估AI模型人格特征的有效工具，有助于解决现有评估方法在人格衡量方面的局限性，并发布了完整的工具包、Web应用和标注数据。

Abstract: Some traits making a "good" AI model are hard to describe upfront. For
example, should responses be more polite or more casual? Such traits are
sometimes summarized as model character or personality. Without a clear
objective, conventional benchmarks based on automatic validation struggle to
measure such traits. Evaluation methods using human feedback such as Chatbot
Arena have emerged as a popular alternative. These methods infer "better"
personality and other desirable traits implicitly by ranking multiple model
responses relative to each other. Recent issues with model releases highlight
limitations of these existing opaque evaluation approaches: a major model was
rolled back over sycophantic personality issues, models were observed
overfitting to such feedback-based leaderboards. Despite these known issues,
limited public tooling exists to explicitly evaluate model personality. We
introduce Feedback Forensics: an open-source toolkit to track AI personality
changes, both those encouraged by human (or AI) feedback, and those exhibited
across AI models trained and evaluated on such feedback. Leveraging AI
annotators, our toolkit enables investigating personality via Python API and
browser app. We demonstrate the toolkit's usefulness in two steps: (A) first we
analyse the personality traits encouraged in popular human feedback datasets
including Chatbot Arena, MultiPref and PRISM; and (B) then use our toolkit to
analyse how much popular models exhibit such traits. We release (1) our
Feedback Forensics toolkit alongside (2) a web app tracking AI personality in
popular models and feedback datasets as well as (3) the underlying annotation
data at https://github.com/rdnfn/feedback-forensics.

*Rui Ming,Haoyuan Wu,Shoubo Hu,Zhuolun He,Bei Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为one-token rollout (OTR)的新微调算法，将策略梯度方法引入监督微调，通过将每个token生成视为单步强化学习轨迹来提升LLM的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)在泛化能力上通常不如强化学习(RL)，作者认为这种性能差异不仅源于损失函数，更源于数据性质的根本不同：SFT使用固定的离线数据，而RL使用来自当前策略的在线数据。

Method: OTR算法将自回归学习过程重新定义为单步强化学习轨迹，在每个步骤中从当前策略分布中采样多个候选token，使用监督数据中的真实token提供奖励信号，通过策略梯度将静态离线数据转化为动态在线信号。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和通用领域推理等多个挑战性基准测试中，OTR始终优于标准SFT方法。

Conclusion: OTR为微调LLMs提供了一个强大实用的替代方案，证明了数据的在线性质是泛化能力的关键驱动因素，为LLM微调开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is the predominant method for adapting large
language models (LLMs), yet it often struggles with generalization compared to
reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we posit that this performance
disparity stems not just from the loss function, but from a more fundamental
difference: SFT learns from a fixed, pre-collected dataset, whereas RL utilizes
on-policy data sampled from the current policy. Building on this hypothesis, we
introduce one-token rollout (OTR), a novel fine-tuning algorithm that guides
SFT with the policy gradient method. OTR reframes the autoregressive learning
process by treating each token generation as a single-step reinforcement
learning trajectory. At each step, it performs a Monte Carlo ``rollout'' by
sampling multiple candidate tokens from the current policy's distribution. The
ground-truth token from the supervised data is then used to provide a reward
signal to these samples. Guided by policy gradient, our algorithm repurposes
static, off-policy supervised data into a dynamic, on-policy signal at the
token level, capturing the generalization benefits of on-policy learning while
bypassing the costly overhead of full sentence generation. Through extensive
experiments on a diverse suite of challenging benchmarks spanning mathematical
reasoning, code generation, and general domain reasoning, we demonstrate that
OTR consistently outperforms standard SFT. Our findings establish OTR as a
powerful and practical alternative for fine-tuning LLMs and provide compelling
evidence that the on-policy nature of data is a critical driver of
generalization, offering a promising new direction for fine-tuning LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM的链式思维推理计算成本高且容易过度思考，潜在思考架构缺乏可解释性和监督，需要研究如何改进潜在思考过程的正确性和可靠性。

Method: 提出Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO)概率算法，使用潜在分类器作为Latent Reward Model (LRM)来检测和优化潜在思考模式，该方法可泛化到不同领域和通用LLM。

Result: 实验表明LRM能有效检测错误的潜在思考模式，LTO显著改善了潜在思考过程，该方法在多样化推理任务中表现出色且具有领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: 与语言思维相比，在潜在空间中进行奖励建模和扩展测试时思维监督是可行且高效的，为改进LLM思考过程提供了一种通用、高效且领域无关的方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at problem solving by generating chain of
thoughts in natural language, but such verbal thinking is computationally
costly and prone to overthinking. Recent work instead proposes a latent
thinking architecture Huggin-3.5B, which represents intermediate reasoning
steps as sequence of latent representations. However, latent thoughts lack
interpretability and are difficult to supervise, raising concerns about the
correctness and reliability of its latent thinking processes. In this paper, we
provide a systematic study of how Huggin-3.5B thinks in the latent space and
how external supervision signals can improve its latent thinking processes. We
show that latent thoughts leading to correct versus incorrect answers exhibit
highly distinguishable patterns, and that a latent classifier can reliably
predict answer correctness directly from latent thoughts. Leveraging these
insights, we propose Latent Thinking Optimization (LTO), a probabilistic
algorithm that employs the latent classifier as a Latent Reward Model (LRM) to
optimize the latent thinking processes. Extensive experiments across diverse
reasoning tasks demonstrate that LRM is highly effective in detecting incorrect
latent thinking patterns, and LTO can significantly improve the latent thinking
processes. Furthermore, we show that LRM can generalize across diverse domains,
and LTO can be seamlessly applied to general LLMs to improve their thinking
processes. In contrast to verbal thinking, our method demonstrates that reward
modeling and scaling test-time thinking with supervision can be performed
directly in the latent space, highlighting its potential as a general,
efficient, and domain-agnostic approach to improving the thinking processes of
LLMs.

TL;DR: Fast-dLLM v2是一种块扩散语言模型，通过仅需约1B token微调将预训练自回归模型转换为并行文本生成模型，相比传统扩散模型减少500倍训练数据，实现2.5倍加速且保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现优异，但其顺序解码限制了推理效率，需要开发高效的并行生成方法。

Method: 提出块扩散机制和互补注意力掩码，结合层次化缓存机制（块级缓存和子块缓存），实现块间双向上下文建模和并行解码。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Fast-dLLM v2在准确度上匹配或超越自回归基线，在dLLMs中实现最先进的效率，解码速度提升达2.5倍。

Conclusion: 该工作标志着向快速准确LLMs实际部署迈出了重要一步，代码和模型将公开发布。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance across a wide range of natural language tasks, yet their inherent
sequential decoding limits inference efficiency. In this work, we propose
Fast-dLLM v2, a carefully designed block diffusion language model (dLLM) that
efficiently adapts pretrained AR models into dLLMs for parallel text
generation, requiring only approximately 1B tokens of fine-tuning. This
represents a 500x reduction in training data compared to full-attention
diffusion LLMs such as Dream (580B tokens), while preserving the original
model's performance. Our approach introduces a novel training recipe that
combines a block diffusion mechanism with a complementary attention mask,
enabling blockwise bidirectional context modeling without sacrificing AR
training objectives. To further accelerate decoding, we design a hierarchical
caching mechanism: a block-level cache that stores historical context
representations across blocks, and a sub-block cache that enables efficient
parallel generation within partially decoded blocks. Coupled with our parallel
decoding pipeline, Fast-dLLM v2 achieves up to 2.5x speedup over standard AR
decoding without compromising generation quality. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Fast-dLLM v2 matches or surpasses AR
baselines in accuracy, while delivering state-of-the-art efficiency among dLLMs
- marking a significant step toward the practical deployment of fast and
accurate LLMs. Code and model will be publicly released.

Abstract: Knowledge-graph retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG) couples large
language models (LLMs) with structured, verifiable knowledge graphs (KGs) to
reduce hallucinations and expose reasoning traces. However, many KG-RAG systems
compose multiple LLM modules (e.g planning, reasoning, and responding),
inflating inference cost and binding behavior to a specific target KG. To
address this, we introduce KG-R1, an agentic KG retrieval-augmented generation
(KG-RAG) framework through reinforcement learning (RL). KG-R1 utilizes a single
agent that interacts with KGs as its environment, learning to retrieve at each
step and incorporating the retrieved information into its reasoning and
generation. The process is optimized through end-to-end RL. In controlled
experiments across Knowledge-Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmarks, our
method demonstrates both efficiency and transferability: Using Qwen-2.5-3B,
KG-R1 improves answer accuracy with fewer generation tokens than prior
multi-module workflow methods that use larger foundation or fine-tuned models.
Furthermore, KG-R1 enables plug and play: after training, it maintains strong
accuracy on new KGs without modification. These properties make KG-R1 a
promising KG-RAG framework for real-world deployment. Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Jinyeop3110/KG-R1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实性评估语言话语与现实世界信息的关联程度，对事实核查至关重要。它是一个复杂概念，依赖多种语言信号，需要系统性的标注方案。

Method: 开发了结合多种先前工作概念的多方面标注方案，手动标注了近5,000个议会话语领域的句子，并实验了多种自动预测方法。

Result: 报告了标注者间一致性，成功开发了能够自动预测标注方案某些特征的系统，为扩展到大型语料库奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该标注方案虽然为希伯来语开发，但可适应其他语言，为真实性评估提供了系统化的框架和可扩展的标注方法。

Abstract: Factuality assesses the extent to which a language utterance relates to
real-world information; it determines whether utterances correspond to facts,
possibilities, or imaginary situations, and as such, it is instrumental for
fact checking. Factuality is a complex notion that relies on multiple
linguistic signals, and has been studied in various disciplines.
  We present a complex, multi-faceted annotation scheme of factuality that
combines concepts from a variety of previous works. We developed the scheme for
Hebrew, but we trust that it can be adapted to other languages. We also present
a set of almost 5,000 sentences in the domain of parliamentary discourse that
we manually annotated according to this scheme. We report on inter-annotator
agreement, and experiment with various approaches to automatically predict
(some features of) the scheme, in order to extend the annotation to a large
corpus.

Abstract: Aligning test items to content standards is a critical step in test
development to collect validity evidence based on content. Item alignment has
typically been conducted by human experts. This judgmental process can be
subjective and time-consuming. This study investigated the performance of
fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) for automated item alignment using data
from a large-scale standardized reading and writing test for college
admissions. Different SLMs were trained for alignment at both domain and skill
levels respectively with 10 skills mapped to 4 content domains. The model
performance was evaluated in multiple criteria on two testing datasets. The
impact of types and sizes of the input data for training was investigated.
Results showed that including more item text data led to substantially better
model performance, surpassing the improvements induced by sample size increase
alone. For comparison, supervised machine learning models were trained using
the embeddings from the multilingual-E5-large-instruct model. The study results
showed that fine-tuned SLMs consistently outperformed the embedding-based
supervised machine learning models, particularly for the more fine-grained
skill alignment. To better understand model misclassifications, multiple
semantic similarity analysis including pairwise cosine similarity,
Kullback-Leibler divergence of embedding distributions, and two-dimension
projections of item embeddings were conducted. These analyses consistently
showed that certain skills in SAT and PSAT were semantically too close,
providing evidence for the observed misclassification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出PACO框架，通过自适应规划解决多属性可控摘要任务中的属性依赖问题，无需训练即可实现多属性约束的满足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控摘要方法面临属性间相互依赖的挑战，难以一致满足相关约束，且通常需要针对每个属性进行微调，限制了灵活性。

Method: 使用训练免费的框架，将任务重新定义为规划顺序属性控制，采用定制化蒙特卡洛树搜索（MCTS），节点表示摘要，动作对应单属性调整，逐步优化需要进一步控制的属性。

Result: 在多个领域和模型上的广泛实验表明，PACO实现了强大的多属性可控性，超越了基于LLM的自规划模型和微调基线。使用Llama-3.2-1B的PACO可与更大的Llama-3.3-70B基线相媲美。

Conclusion: PACO通过自适应发现最优控制顺序，有效生成满足所有约束的摘要，在大模型上实现优于所有竞争对手的控制性能。

Abstract: Controllable summarization moves beyond generic outputs toward human-aligned
summaries guided by specified attributes. In practice, the interdependence
among attributes makes it challenging for language models to satisfy correlated
constraints consistently. Moreover, previous approaches often require
per-attribute fine-tuning, limiting flexibility across diverse summary
attributes. In this paper, we propose adaptive planning for multi-attribute
controllable summarization (PACO), a training-free framework that reframes the
task as planning the order of sequential attribute control with a customized
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In PACO, nodes represent summaries, and actions
correspond to single-attribute adjustments, enabling progressive refinement of
only the attributes requiring further control. This strategy adaptively
discovers optimal control orders, ultimately producing summaries that
effectively meet all constraints. Extensive experiments across diverse domains
and models demonstrate that PACO achieves robust multi-attribute
controllability, surpassing both LLM-based self-planning models and fine-tuned
baselines. Remarkably, PACO with Llama-3.2-1B rivals the controllability of the
much larger Llama-3.3-70B baselines. With larger models, PACO achieves superior
control performance, outperforming all competitors.

TL;DR: CreAgentive是一个基于智能体工作流的多类别创意生成引擎，通过故事原型和三层工作流解决了LLM在创意写作中的四个关键限制：类型多样性不足、输出长度有限、叙事连贯性弱、无法实现复杂结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当代大语言模型在创意写作中的四个主要局限：类型多样性受限、输出长度不足、叙事连贯性弱、无法执行复杂结构构造。

Method: 采用基于知识图谱的故事原型，将故事逻辑与风格实现解耦；包含三层智能体工作流：初始化阶段构建叙事骨架，生成阶段通过多智能体对话实例化故事原型，写作阶段生成多类型文本。

Result: 在广泛实验中，CreAgentive以稳定质量和低成本（每100章节不到1美元）生成了数千章节，在10个叙事指标上持续优于强基线，接近人类创作小说的质量。

Conclusion: CreAgentive通过其架构减少了存储冗余，克服了长文本生成的典型瓶颈，在多样化类型中实现了稳健性能。

Abstract: We present CreAgentive, an agent workflow driven multi-category creative
generation engine that addresses four key limitations of contemporary large
language models in writing stories, drama and other categories of creatives:
restricted genre diversity, insufficient output length, weak narrative
coherence, and inability to enforce complex structural constructs. At its core,
CreAgentive employs a Story Prototype, which is a genre-agnostic, knowledge
graph-based narrative representation that decouples story logic from stylistic
realization by encoding characters, events, and environments as semantic
triples. CreAgentive engages a three-stage agent workflow that comprises: an
Initialization Stage that constructs a user-specified narrative skeleton; a
Generation Stage in which long- and short-term objectives guide multi-agent
dialogues to instantiate the Story Prototype; a Writing Stage that leverages
this prototype to produce multi-genre text with advanced structures such as
retrospection and foreshadowing. This architecture reduces storage redundancy
and overcomes the typical bottlenecks of long-form generation. In extensive
experiments, CreAgentive generates thousands of chapters with stable quality
and low cost (less than $1 per 100 chapters) using a general-purpose backbone
model. To evaluate performance, we define a two-dimensional framework with 10
narrative indicators measuring both quality and length. Results show that
CreAgentive consistently outperforms strong baselines and achieves robust
performance across diverse genres, approaching the quality of human-authored
novels.

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的回归语言模型(RLM)，能够直接从代码文本预测多种执行指标，包括内存占用、GPU内核延迟和神经网络性能，无需复杂的特征工程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决代码到指标回归的挑战性任务，传统方法需要大量领域特定的特征工程，而本文旨在开发一个统一的模型来处理多种编程语言和硬件平台的性能预测。

Method: 使用基于T5Gemma初始化的300M参数回归语言模型(RLM)，直接从代码文本预测数值结果，支持多种编程语言和硬件平台。

Result: 在APPS竞争编程提交上获得>0.9的Spearman秩相关；在CodeNet的17种语言上平均Spearman秩相关>0.5；在五个经典NAS设计空间上获得最高平均Kendall-Tau 0.46。

Conclusion: 统一的回归语言模型能够有效预测代码执行的各种数值指标，在多个基准测试中表现优异，超越了传统的图神经网络方法。

Abstract: We study code-to-metric regression: predicting numeric outcomes of code
executions, a challenging task due to the open-ended nature of programming
languages. While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific
feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model
(RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint
of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the
latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained
neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M
parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on
competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model
achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet.
Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five
classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and
simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.

TL;DR: dParallel是一种简单有效的方法，通过确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，解锁扩散大语言模型的并行解码潜力，显著减少解码步骤同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型作为自回归生成的有前景替代方案，具有并行令牌预测和更低推理延迟的优势，但其并行解码潜力尚未充分开发，现有开源模型仍需接近令牌长度的解码步骤来保证性能。

Method: 提出dParallel方法，核心是确定性强制蒸馏训练策略，通过蒸馏模型遵循原始采样轨迹，同时强制模型在掩码令牌上更快地实现高确定性并行处理。

Result: 在LLaDA-8B-Instruct模型上，GSM8K基准测试解码步骤从256减少到30，实现8.5倍加速且性能无损；MBPP基准测试解码步骤从256减少到24，实现10.5倍加速同时保持准确率。

Conclusion: dParallel方法能显著减少扩散大语言模型的解码步骤，大幅提升推理速度，同时保持模型性能，为扩散模型的并行解码提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently drawn considerable
attention within the research community as a promising alternative to
autoregressive generation, offering parallel token prediction and lower
inference latency. Yet, their parallel decoding potential remains largely
underexplored, as existing open-source models still require nearly token-length
decoding steps to ensure performance. To address this, we introduce dParallel,
a simple and effective method that unlocks the inherent parallelism of dLLMs
for fast sampling. We identify that the key bottleneck to parallel decoding
arises from the sequential certainty convergence for masked tokens. Building on
this insight, we introduce the core of our approach: certainty-forcing
distillation, a novel training strategy that distills the model to follow its
original sampling trajectories while enforcing it to achieve high certainty on
masked tokens more rapidly and in parallel. Extensive experiments across
various benchmarks demonstrate that our method can dramatically reduce the
number of decoding steps while maintaining performance. When applied to the
LLaDA-8B-Instruct model, dParallel reduces decoding steps from 256 to 30 on
GSM8K, achieving an 8.5x speedup without performance degradation. On the MBPP
benchmark, it cuts decoding steps from 256 to 24, resulting in a 10.5x speedup
while maintaining accuracy. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有基准测试无法充分评估LLM智能体在现实场景中处理海量信息、利用多样化资源和应对动态用户交互的复杂性，需要更贴近真实应用的评估框架。

Method: 基于日常生活应用构建复杂模拟环境，通过消除领域特定策略实现场景和工具的灵活组合，创建100个跨场景任务和300个单场景任务，并设计基于评分的滑动窗口评估器来评估多样化解决方案路径。

Result: 评估结果显示，即使最先进的模型在跨场景任务中成功率仅为30%，在其他任务中成功率也不到50%，表明当前智能体在复杂现实场景中仍有很大提升空间。

Conclusion: VitaBench为推进AI智能体在实际应用中的发展提供了宝贵资源，能够有效评估智能体在复杂现实环境中的表现。

Abstract: As LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed in real-life scenarios,
existing benchmarks fail to capture their inherent complexity of handling
extensive information, leveraging diverse resources, and managing dynamic user
interactions. To address this gap, we introduce VitaBench, a challenging
benchmark that evaluates agents on versatile interactive tasks grounded in
real-world settings. Drawing from daily applications in food delivery, in-store
consumption, and online travel services, VitaBench presents agents with the
most complex life-serving simulation environment to date, comprising 66 tools.
Through a framework that eliminates domain-specific policies, we enable
flexible composition of these scenarios and tools, yielding 100 cross-scenario
tasks (main results) and 300 single-scenario tasks. Each task is derived from
multiple real user requests and requires agents to reason across temporal and
spatial dimensions, utilize complex tool sets, proactively clarify ambiguous
instructions, and track shifting user intent throughout multi-turn
conversations. Moreover, we propose a rubric-based sliding window evaluator,
enabling robust assessment of diverse solution pathways in complex environments
and stochastic interactions. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that even the
most advanced models achieve only 30% success rate on cross-scenario tasks, and
less than 50% success rate on others. Overall, we believe VitaBench will serve
as a valuable resource for advancing the development of AI agents in practical
real-world applications. The code, dataset, and leaderboard are available at

Motivation: 现有方法未能充分利用LLM的语言智能和指令跟随能力，限制了可控文本转语音的发展。

Method: 采用操作主义范式，将指令理解与语音生成解耦：LLM作为指挥生成声学特征文本计划，BatonTTS作为乐团执行语音合成。

Result: 在可控和情感语音合成方面表现优异，超越开源和闭源基线，实现显著的零样本跨语言泛化能力。

Conclusion: 将语音对象化为文本声学特征能更有效释放LLM的语言智能，为可控语音合成提供新范式。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) is reshaping multimodel models, with
speech synthesis being a prominent application. However, existing approaches
often underutilize the linguistic intelligence of these models, typically
failing to leverage their powerful instruction-following capabilities. This
limitation hinders the model's ability to follow text instructions for
controllable Text-to-Speech~(TTS). To address this, we propose a new paradigm
inspired by ``operationalism'' that decouples instruction understanding from
speech generation. We introduce BatonVoice, a framework where an LLM acts as a
``conductor'', understanding user instructions and generating a textual
``plan'' -- explicit vocal features (e.g., pitch, energy). A separate TTS
model, the ``orchestra'', then generates the speech from these features. To
realize this component, we develop BatonTTS, a TTS model trained specifically
for this task. Our experiments demonstrate that BatonVoice achieves strong
performance in controllable and emotional speech synthesis, outperforming
strong open- and closed-source baselines. Notably, our approach enables
remarkable zero-shot cross-lingual generalization, accurately applying feature
control abilities to languages unseen during post-training. This demonstrates
that objectifying speech into textual vocal features can more effectively
unlock the linguistic intelligence of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MoE模型的Top-K路由策略在推理时改变激活专家数量会导致性能急剧下降，限制了MoE模型的弹性推理潜力。

Method: 引入Matryoshka MoE训练框架，在训练过程中系统性地改变激活专家数量，强制模型学习从粗到细的专家排名结构，并探索了层级随机化策略。

Result: 单个M-MoE模型在不同专家数量下都能保持良好性能，其表现接近整个专家模型套件，但训练成本仅为后者的一小部分。

Conclusion: M-MoE为大规模MoE模型的实际部署提供了更实用和灵活的解决方案，实现了弹性推理和计算资源优化分配。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for efficiently
scaling large language models without a proportional increase in computational
cost. However, the standard training strategy of Top-K router prevents MoE
models from realizing their full potential for elastic inference. When the
number of activated experts is altered at inference time, these models exhibit
precipitous performance degradation. In this work, we introduce Matryoshka MoE
(M-MoE), a training framework that instills a coarse-to-fine structure directly
into the expert ensemble. By systematically varying the number of activated
experts during training, M-MoE compels the model to learn a meaningful ranking:
top-ranked experts collaborate to provide essential, coarse-grained
capabilities, while subsequent experts add progressively finer-grained detail.
We explore this principle at multiple granularities, identifying a layer-wise
randomization strategy as the most effective. Our experiments demonstrate that
a single M-MoE model achieves remarkable elasticity, with its performance at
various expert counts closely matching that of an entire suite of specialist
models, but at only a fraction of the total training cost. This flexibility not
only unlocks elastic inference but also enables optimizing performance by
allocating different computational budgets to different model layers. Our work
paves the way for more practical and adaptable deployments of large-scale MoE
models.

Conclusion: OceanGym为开发鲁棒具身AI提供了高保真平台，是向真实世界自主水下航行器能力转移的关键一步，标志着智能体在地球最后未开发前沿领域操作能力的重要进展。

Abstract: We introduce OceanGym, the first comprehensive benchmark for ocean underwater
embodied agents, designed to advance AI in one of the most demanding real-world
environments. Unlike terrestrial or aerial domains, underwater settings present
extreme perceptual and decision-making challenges, including low visibility,
dynamic ocean currents, making effective agent deployment exceptionally
difficult. OceanGym encompasses eight realistic task domains and a unified
agent framework driven by Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which
integrates perception, memory, and sequential decision-making. Agents are
required to comprehend optical and sonar data, autonomously explore complex
environments, and accomplish long-horizon objectives under these harsh
conditions. Extensive experiments reveal substantial gaps between
state-of-the-art MLLM-driven agents and human experts, highlighting the
persistent difficulty of perception, planning, and adaptability in ocean
underwater environments. By providing a high-fidelity, rigorously designed
platform, OceanGym establishes a testbed for developing robust embodied AI and
transferring these capabilities to real-world autonomous ocean underwater
vehicles, marking a decisive step toward intelligent agents capable of
operating in one of Earth's last unexplored frontiers. The code and data are

Result: 在语音翻译中性别分配的案例研究中，该方法能准确识别驱动选择某一性别而非另一性别的音频特征

Conclusion: 通过将对比性解释的范围扩展到语音转文本领域，为更好地理解语音转文本模型奠定了基础

Abstract: Contrastive explanations, which indicate why an AI system produced one output
(the target) instead of another (the foil), are widely regarded in explainable
AI as more informative and interpretable than standard explanations. However,
obtaining such explanations for speech-to-text (S2T) generative models remains
an open challenge. Drawing from feature attribution techniques, we propose the
first method to obtain contrastive explanations in S2T by analyzing how parts
of the input spectrogram influence the choice between alternative outputs.
Through a case study on gender assignment in speech translation, we show that
our method accurately identifies the audio features that drive the selection of
one gender over another. By extending the scope of contrastive explanations to
S2T, our work provides a foundation for better understanding S2T models.

TL;DR: FuncBenchGen是一个用于评估工具增强语言模型的统一框架，通过生成合成多步骤工具使用任务来避免数据污染，并允许精确控制任务难度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强语言模型基准在函数数量、任务复杂度和输入大小等方面控制不足，且容易受到数据污染的影响。

Method: 将工具使用建模为在隐藏函数依赖DAG上的遍历，节点是函数调用，边表示函数间的输出依赖关系。模型需要组合正确的调用序列来计算目标变量。

Result: 推理优化模型显著优于通用模型，GPT-5表现最佳。性能随依赖深度增加而急剧下降，连接的不相关函数尤其难以处理。模型常做出语法有效但参数错误的调用。

Conclusion: LLMs在多轮工具使用中存在脆弱的状态跟踪问题。通过在每个步骤明确重述先前变量值的简单缓解策略，可以显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: As language models gain access to external tools via structured function
calls, they become increasingly more capable of solving complex, multi-step
tasks. However, existing benchmarks for tool-augmented language models (TaLMs)
provide insufficient control over factors such as the number of functions
accessible, task complexity, and input size, and remain vulnerable to data
contamination. We present FuncBenchGen, a unified, contamination-free framework
that evaluates TaLMs by generating synthetic multi-step tool-use tasks. The key
idea is to cast tool use as traversal over a hidden function-dependency DAG
where nodes are function calls and an edge between nodes represents one
function consuming the output of another. Given a set of external function
schemas, initial variable values, and a target variable, models must compose
the correct call sequence to compute the target variable. FuncBenchGen allows
users to precisely control task difficulty (e.g., graph size, dependency depth,
and distractor functions) while avoiding data leakage. We apply our
FuncBenchGen framework to evaluate seven LLMs on tool use tasks of varying
difficulty. Reasoning-optimized models consistently outperform general-purpose
models with GPT-5 significantly outperforming other models. Performance
declines sharply as dependency depth increases. Furthermore, connected
irrelevant functions prove especially difficult to handle. We find that strong
models often make syntactically valid function calls but propagate incorrect or
stale argument values across steps, revealing brittle state tracking by LLMs in
multi-turn tool use. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a simple
mitigation strategy that explicitly restates prior variable values to the agent
at each step. Surprisingly, this lightweight change yields substantial gains
across models. e.g., yielding a success rate improvement from 62.5% to 81.3%

TL;DR: MT-breaker：一种使用大语言模型迭代优化源文本以增加翻译难度的方法，旨在生成更具挑战性的机器翻译测试用例


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界的机器翻译基准测试很快过时，因为大多数样本对最先进的翻译模型来说过于简单，无法有效区分模型优劣或揭示模型弱点

Method: 使用大语言模型迭代查询目标机器翻译模型，逐步优化源文本以增加翻译难度，同时保持自然文本的多样性

Result: 生成的测试用例对目标MT模型更具挑战性，同时难度也能迁移到其他模型和语言，保持文本的自然性和多样性

Conclusion: MT-breaker方法能够有效生成具有挑战性的机器翻译测试用例，解决了现有基准测试过时和测试用例不足的问题

Abstract: Machine translation benchmarks sourced from the real world are quickly
obsoleted, due to most examples being easy for state-of-the-art translation
models. This limits the benchmark's ability to distinguish which model is
better or to reveal models' weaknesses. Current methods for creating difficult
test cases, such as subsampling or from-scratch synthesis, either fall short of
identifying difficult examples or suffer from a lack of diversity and
naturalness. Inspired by the iterative process of human experts probing for
model failures, we propose MT-breaker, a method where a large language model
iteratively refines a source text to increase its translation difficulty. The
LLM iteratively queries a target machine translation model to guide its
generation of difficult examples. Our approach generates examples that are more
challenging for the target MT model while preserving the diversity of natural
texts. While the examples are tailored to a particular machine translation
model during the generation, the difficulty also transfers to other models and
languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLM生成的基准测试存在自我偏见，会系统性偏向生成该基准的模型，特别是在低资源语言的翻译任务中。这种偏见来自测试数据生成和评估方法两方面，且受模型在源语言生成能力的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型逐渐饱和现有基准测试，使用LLM自动创建基准测试成为可扩展的替代方案。但需要验证这些生成测试集是否公平可靠。

Method: 通过分析LLM在翻译任务中的自动基准测试，研究自我偏见的来源、影响因素和缓解方法。

Result: 发现LLM生成的基准测试存在系统性自我偏见，偏见程度受模型在源语言生成能力影响，源文本多样性不足是偏见的重要成因。

Conclusion: LLM生成的基准测试存在严重自我偏见问题，提高生成源文本的多样性可以部分缓解这种偏见。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) begin to saturate existing benchmarks,
automated benchmark creation using LLMs (LLM as a benchmark) has emerged as a
scalable alternative to slow and costly human curation. While these generated
test sets have to potential to cheaply rank models, we demonstrate a critical
flaw. LLM generated benchmarks systematically favor the model that created the
benchmark, they exhibit self bias on low resource languages to English
translation tasks. We show three key findings on automatic benchmarking of LLMs
for translation: First, this bias originates from two sources: the generated
test data (LLM as a testset) and the evaluation method (LLM as an evaluator),
with their combination amplifying the effect. Second, self bias in LLM as a
benchmark is heavily influenced by the model's generation capabilities in the
source language. For instance, we observe more pronounced bias in into English
translation, where the model's generation system is developed, than in out of
English translation tasks. Third, we observe that low diversity in source text
is one attribution to self bias. Our results suggest that improving the
diversity of these generated source texts can mitigate some of the observed
self bias.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MENLO框架通过受众设计机制评估LLM响应的母语质量，创建了6423个人工标注的偏好对数据集，覆盖47种语言。研究发现零样本LLM评估器在成对评估和结构化标注标准下表现提升，但仍不及人类标注者。通过强化学习、奖励塑形和多任务学习等方法显著改善了评估性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保大型语言模型在多语言环境下的母语质量响应具有挑战性，需要开发可扩展的多语言评估框架来提升LLM的多语言能力。

Method: 引入MENLO评估框架，基于受众设计机制创建人工标注数据集；采用零样本LLM评估器、成对评估方法；使用强化学习、奖励塑形和多任务学习进行模型优化。

Result: 零样本LLM评估器在结构化标注标准下表现改善但仍不及人类；强化学习训练后的评估器可作为生成奖励模型提升LLM多语言能力；与人类判断仍存在差异。

Conclusion: MENLO为可扩展的多语言评估和偏好对齐提供了有前景的方向，释放的数据集和框架支持进一步的多语言LLM评估研究。

Abstract: Ensuring native-like quality of large language model (LLM) responses across
many languages is challenging. To address this, we introduce MENLO, a framework
that operationalizes the evaluation of native-like response quality based on
audience design-inspired mechanisms. Using MENLO, we create a dataset of 6,423
human-annotated prompt-response preference pairs covering four quality
dimensions with high inter-annotator agreement in 47 language varieties. Our
evaluation reveals that zero-shot LLM judges benefit significantly from
pairwise evaluation and our structured annotation rubrics, yet they still
underperform human annotators on our dataset. We demonstrate substantial
improvements through fine-tuning with reinforcement learning, reward shaping,
and multi-task learning approaches. Additionally, we show that RL-trained
judges can serve as generative reward models to enhance LLMs' multilingual
proficiency, though discrepancies with human judgment remain. Our findings
suggest promising directions for scalable multilingual evaluation and
preference alignment. We release our dataset and evaluation framework to
support further research in multilingual LLM evaluation.

Motivation: 解决现有AI科学家系统缺乏聚焦性，无法产生针对紧迫人类挑战的有价值科学贡献的问题。

Method: 将科学发现形式化为贝叶斯优化问题，采用"假设、验证、分析"的分层评估流程，利用累积发现记忆智能平衡探索与利用。

Result: 消耗超过20,000 GPU小时，生成约5,000个独特科学想法，实验验证约1,100个，在三个前沿AI任务上分别超越人类最优方法183.7%、1.9%和7.9%。

Abstract: While previous AI Scientist systems can generate novel findings, they often
lack the focus to produce scientifically valuable contributions that address
pressing human-defined challenges. We introduce DeepScientist, a system
designed to overcome this by conducting goal-oriented, fully autonomous
scientific discovery over month-long timelines. It formalizes discovery as a
Bayesian Optimization problem, operationalized through a hierarchical
evaluation process consisting of "hypothesize, verify, and analyze". Leveraging
a cumulative Findings Memory, this loop intelligently balances the exploration
of novel hypotheses with exploitation, selectively promoting the most promising
findings to higher-fidelity levels of validation. Consuming over 20,000 GPU
hours, the system generated about 5,000 unique scientific ideas and
experimentally validated approximately 1100 of them, ultimately surpassing
human-designed state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on three frontier AI tasks by
183.7\%, 1.9\%, and 7.9\%. This work provides the first large-scale evidence of
an AI achieving discoveries that progressively surpass human SOTA on scientific
tasks, producing valuable findings that genuinely push the frontier of
scientific discovery. To facilitate further research into this process, we will
open-source all experimental logs and system code at

TL;DR: 该论文提出将寻找最具挑战性的NLP测试数据问题建模为多臂老虎机问题，其中每个主题是一个臂，通过有限的预算高效识别最困难的主题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型需要足够具有挑战性的测试数据，但直接从海量主题中寻找最困难的主题计算成本过高，因为主题与实例难度之间存在随机性关系。

Method: 将问题形式化为多臂老虎机问题，每个主题对应一个臂，通过抽取单个样本评估其难度，使用各种老虎机策略在固定计算预算内高效识别最困难主题。

Result: 在机器翻译任务中，各种老虎机策略显著优于暴力搜索等基线方法，能够更有效地找到最具挑战性的主题。

Conclusion: 多臂老虎机框架为在有限计算资源下寻找NLP测试数据中最困难主题提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: NLP models require test data that are sufficiently challenging. The
difficulty of an example is linked to the topic it originates from (''seed
topic''). The relationship between the topic and the difficulty of its
instances is stochastic in nature: an example about a difficult topic can
happen to be easy, and vice versa. At the scale of the Internet, there are tens
of thousands of potential topics, and finding the most difficult one by drawing
and evaluating a large number of examples across all topics is computationally
infeasible. We formalize this task and treat it as a multi-armed bandit
problem. In this framework, each topic is an ''arm,'' and pulling an arm (at a
cost) involves drawing a single example, evaluating it, and measuring its
difficulty. The goal is to efficiently identify the most difficult topics
within a fixed computational budget. We illustrate the bandit problem setup of
finding difficult examples for the task of machine translation. We find that
various bandit strategies vastly outperform baseline methods like brute-force
searching the most challenging topics.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了音节级标记化在口语语言建模中的应用，相比传统高帧率标记，音节标记在保持性能的同时显著降低了训练和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统口语语言模型使用高帧率标记处理语音，但Transformer的自注意力机制在处理长序列时计算成本高昂。音节级标记化提供了更可解释且更可扩展的替代方案。

Method: 使用音节级声学标记化方法，将语音离散化为音节级标记（4-5 Hz），并在多个SLU基准测试上评估模型性能，同时改变训练数据规模。

Result: 音节标记在性能上能够匹配甚至超越传统高帧率标记，同时显著降低训练和推理成本：训练时间减少2倍以上，FLOPs减少5倍。

Conclusion: 音节级语言建模是实现高效长上下文口语语言模型的有前景路径。

Abstract: Spoken language models (SLMs) typically discretize speech into
high-frame-rate tokens extracted from SSL speech models. As the most successful
LMs are based on the Transformer architecture, processing these long token
streams with self-attention is expensive, as attention scales quadratically
with sequence length. A recent SSL work introduces acoustic tokenization of
speech at the syllable level, which is more interpretable and potentially more
scalable with significant compression in token lengths (4-5 Hz). Yet, their
value for spoken language modeling is not yet fully explored. We present the
first systematic study of syllabic tokenization for spoken language modeling,
evaluating models on a suite of SLU benchmarks while varying training data
scale. Syllabic tokens can match or surpass the previous high-frame rate tokens
while significantly cutting training and inference costs, achieving more than a
2x reduction in training time and a 5x reduction in FLOPs. Our findings
highlight syllable-level language modeling as a promising path to efficient
long-context spoken language models.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了不同随机种子训练的语言模型的收敛性，发现了四阶段收敛模式，并揭示了模型大小和训练阶段对收敛的影响，以及不同语言类别收敛速度的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型在不同随机种子下的收敛行为，了解模型训练过程中分布稳定性的影响因素。

Method: 通过测量不同随机种子下的期望每标记KL散度来评估收敛性，分析模型大小、训练检查点、标记频率和词性标签对收敛的影响。

Result: 发现了四阶段收敛模式：初始均匀阶段、急剧收敛阶段、急剧发散阶段和缓慢再收敛阶段；大模型在后期训练阶段再收敛更快，小模型无法真正再收敛；高频标记和功能词比低频标记和内容词收敛更快更可靠。

Conclusion: 模型大小对学习稳定分布是必要的，收敛在不同语言类别中是不均匀的，这些发现有助于理解模型训练中学习分布稳定性的影响因素。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence of language models (LMs)
trained under different random seeds, measuring convergence as the expected
per-token Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence across seeds. By comparing LM
convergence as a function of model size and training checkpoint, we identify a
four-phase convergence pattern: (i) an initial uniform phase, (ii) a
sharp-convergence phase, (iii) a sharp-divergence phase, and (iv) a
slow-reconvergence phase. Further, we observe that larger models reconverge
faster in later training stages, while smaller models never actually
reconverge; these results suggest that a certain model size may be necessary to
learn stable distributions. Restricting our analysis to specific token
frequencies or part-of-speech (PoS) tags further reveals that convergence is
uneven across linguistic categories: frequent tokens and function words
converge faster and more reliably than their counterparts (infrequent tokens
and content words). Overall, our findings highlight factors that influence the
stability of the learned distributions in model training.

TL;DR: LUMA是一个基于扩散模型的文本到动作生成方法，通过双路径锚定机制解决语义对齐和运动伪影问题，在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于U-Net的扩散模型在文本到动作生成任务中存在语义不对齐和运动伪影问题，深层网络梯度衰减导致高级特征学习不足。

Method: 提出LUMA模型，采用双路径锚定：时间域的轻量级MoCLIP模型提供语义监督，频率域的低频DCT分量提供补充对齐信号，通过时间调制机制自适应融合。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上分别达到0.035和0.123的FID分数，收敛速度比基线快1.4倍。

Conclusion: LUMA通过双路径锚定机制有效解决了文本到动作生成中的语义对齐问题，是一个高效可扩展的高保真解决方案。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个新的视觉问答基准测试，包含2720个问题-答案对，专门测试视觉语言模型在密集复杂场景中的基础视觉理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准测试高估了VLMs的性能，特别是在处理密集场景细节时存在不足，需要更严格的测试来评估模型的基础视觉理解能力。

Method: 使用高分辨率公共领域绘画扫描图像，包含多个人物、动作和复杂背景，手动标注6类任务问题来全面测试场景理解。

Result: 测试37个模型，最佳模型(o3)在最难测试集上仅达到19.6%准确率，所有问题平均准确率为69.5%，暴露出计数能力、OCR识别和逻辑一致性等多方面缺陷。

Conclusion: VisualOverload揭示了当前视觉模型在密集场景理解方面的重大差距，为开发更好的模型提供了关键资源。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于摄像头的生理信号估计虽然方便，但面部视频中的生命体征会泄露敏感健康信息，引发隐私担忧。

Method: 使用预训练的3D变分自编码器编码输入视频，通过冻结文本编码器嵌入目标心率提示，利用可训练的时空层和自适应层归一化融合特征，在解码器中应用特征线性调制避免信号退化。

Result: 在选定数据集上平均PSNR为38.96 dB，SSIM为0.98，心率调制误差为10.00 bpm MAE和10.09% MAPE。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效控制心率编辑，可用于匿名化生物特征信号或合成具有特定生命体征的真实视频。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于空间推理需要多种认知能力，如跨视角识别物体、相对位置定位和心理模拟变换，因此需要设计一个能够系统评估这些能力的基准测试。

Method: 设计了包含平移、旋转、物体相对姿态和视角变化的细粒度诊断类别，从简单单对象任务逐步过渡到复杂多对象视角转换任务，评估了37个最先进的视觉语言模型。

Result: 发现模型存在系统性弱点：强烈的自我中心偏见、旋转理解能力差、在对称和句法重构下表现不一致。人类准确率高达91.2%，且人类反应时间与模型准确率强相关。

Conclusion: SpinBench为理解视觉语言模型的空间推理能力提供了关键见解，并揭示了它们在物理空间推理方面的主要差距。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如ConvLSTM难以建模长程依赖关系，且现有工作局限于单模态数据范式，无法充分利用多源信息。

Method: 设计联合时空注意力机制，在统一框架中处理所有多模态特征，实现深度多模态融合。

Result: 在EGMS数据集上达到新的最优性能，相比包括STGCN和STAEformer在内的基线方法，将长程预测RMSE降低了一个数量级。

Conclusion: 对于此类问题，架构固有的深度多模态融合能力是实现变革性性能的关键。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

Motivation: 现有最先进的视觉语言模型在从2D输入理解3D方面表现不佳，而专业的纯视觉模型在度量深度估计等3D理解任务中能达到超人类精度，但需要特定架构和损失函数。研究探索视觉语言模型能否在不改变架构或损失的情况下达到专家级精度。

Method: 使用基于文本的监督微调与稀疏标签，结合视觉提示解决像素参考问题，以及内在条件增强解决跨数据集相机模糊问题。无需密集预测头或复杂回归/正则化损失。

Result: DepthLM方法使视觉语言模型的精度比最先进的视觉语言模型提升超过2倍，首次使视觉语言模型可与纯视觉模型相媲美。同时自然避免了过度平滑，在边界区域的飞点比纯视觉模型少得多。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型通过简单的文本监督微调和适当的视觉提示，能够解锁强大的3D理解能力，且单一模型可覆盖度量深度之外的多种3D任务。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

Result: 在2021年9月泛北极数据集上的测试表明，相比其他不确定性量化方法，该模型能同时实现高分辨率海冰浓度制图和稳健的不确定性制图。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了海冰制图中的关键挑战，为泛北极海冰业务化监测提供了可靠的技术支撑。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在AI生成图像检测中表现不佳，根本原因在于视觉编码器主要针对语义识别优化，对低级别伪造痕迹不敏感，且微调数据与预训练分布差异大导致灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出Forensic-Chat方法，采用"先感知后推理"范式，首先训练MLLMs感知伪造痕迹，增强其伪迹感知视觉能力，使后续推理基于实际观察。

Conclusion: 通过增强MLLMs的伪迹感知视觉能力，可以实现更好的AI生成图像检测性能，同时保持对话能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用视线追踪技术检测实时视频会议中深度伪造攻击的方法，通过分析对话中的注视模式来识别深度伪造视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度伪造技术的进步，恶意行为者开始在视频会议中进行实时钓鱼攻击。由于深度伪造无法模仿真实对话中微妙的非语言注视交流，这为检测提供了机会。

Method: 基于对二元对话中注视模式研究的可解释特征构建模型，利用攻击者视频流中的估计视线来检测深度伪造。

Result: 在自建数据集上测试，准确率达到82%，这是首个利用注视点追踪进行深度伪造检测的方法。

Conclusion: 注视点追踪为实时深度伪造检测提供了有效的生物特征信息，能够识别深度伪造无法模仿的微妙非语言交流模式。

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景中的指代定位面临三大挑战：场景变化大、视觉相似物体多、动态元素干扰，这使得解析自然语言指代（如"右边那辆黑色汽车"）变得困难。

Method: 提出LLM-RG混合管道：使用LLM提取相关物体类型和属性，检测候选区域，用VLM生成丰富视觉描述符，结合空间元数据构建自然语言提示，通过LLM进行思维链推理来识别指代物体的边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG相比基于LLM和VLM的基线方法取得了显著提升。消融实验显示，添加3D空间线索能进一步改进定位效果。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在零样本设置下，VLM和LLM在户外指代定位任务中具有互补优势，能够实现鲁棒的指代定位。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

TL;DR: VISOR++是一种通过优化视觉输入来实现视觉语言模型行为控制的方法，无需运行时访问模型内部，仅通过插入特定图像即可引导模型行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法存在局限性：系统提示易被用户指令覆盖，基于激活的转向向量需要侵入式运行时模型访问，无法用于API服务和闭源模型。需要开发跨模型通用的转向方法。

Method: 通过生成优化的视觉输入（VISOR++图像）来诱导目标激活模式，这些图像可以针对多个VLM模型集合进行联合优化，实现行为重定向。

Result: VISOR++图像在LLaVA-1.5-7B和IDEFICS2-8B等模型上实现了与转向向量相当的性能，在拒绝、奉承和生存本能三个对齐方向上表现良好，且在14,000个无关MMLU评估任务中保持了99.9%的性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++提供了一种部署无关的行为控制方法，通过视觉输入实现跨模型的行为转向，无需运行时模型访问，对开源和闭源模型都有效。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

Conclusion: Vision-Zero证明了无需人工标注即可实现视觉语言模型持续自改进的可行性，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero
achieves state-of-the-art performance on reasoning, chart question answering,
and vision-centric understanding tasks, surpassing other annotation-based
methods. Models and code has been released at

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant

This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic

a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

Motivation: 医学图像分析中标注数据稀缺，传统少样本学习假设所有类别都是新的，但实际医学应用如胸部X光病理分类需要同时学习新类别并利用已有类别知识，这更符合广义少样本分类场景，但相关研究较少。

Method: 构建MetaChest大规模胸部X光数据集，包含专门设计的元集划分和多标签集生成算法。评估标准迁移学习方法和ProtoNet扩展方法在多种少样本多标签分类任务中的表现。

Result: 增加每集类别数和每类训练样本数可提升分类性能；标准迁移学习方法持续优于ProtoNet扩展；高分辨率图像提高精度但增加计算成本；高效模型架构能以更少资源达到类似性能。

Conclusion: MetaChest数据集为医学图像少样本学习提供重要基准，标准迁移学习在广义少样本分类中表现优异，高效模型架构可在保持性能的同时显著降低资源需求。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

Conclusion: K-Prism成功模拟了临床实践的灵活性，能够在不修改架构的情况下在多种知识范式间灵活切换，并实现跨任务的联合训练。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

*Yijia Weng,Zhicheng Wang,Songyou Peng,Saining Xie,Howard Zhou,Leonidas J. Guibas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出GaussianLens方法，通过按需高斯致密化实现局部高分辨率重建，在用户指定感兴趣区域基于稀疏高分辨率观测重建精细细节，避免均匀高分辨率重建的高成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类感知具有主动聚焦特性，对关键区域需要不同细节程度。现有3DGS方法要么输出均匀分辨率导致高计算成本，要么需要密集观测和离线优化。需要平衡高分辨率整体重建的高成本和用户对局部精细细节的需求。

Method: 提出局部高分辨率重建问题，给定低分辨率3DGS重建，学习泛化网络对用户指定RoI进行高斯致密化。提出GaussianLens前馈致密化框架，融合初始3DGS和多视图图像的多模态信息，设计像素引导致密化机制。

Result: 实验证明方法在局部精细细节重建方面表现优越，对高达1024×1024分辨率图像具有强可扩展性。

Conclusion: 提出的局部高分辨率重建方法有效平衡了重建成本和细节需求，GaussianLens框架成功实现按需细节重建。

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

TL;DR: 提出了一个大规模多模态眼科基准数据集，包含32,633个实例，涵盖12种常见眼科疾病和5种成像模式，用于评估生成式模型在眼科诊断中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决威胁视力眼病的全球健康负担，由于医疗资源短缺和专科护理受限，需要开发多模态大语言模型来辅助眼科图像解读，但目前缺乏适合评估生成模型的全面的基准数据集。

Method: 构建包含多粒度标注的大规模多模态眼科数据集，整合影像、解剖结构、人口统计和自由文本注释，支持解剖结构识别、疾病筛查、疾病分期和人口统计预测等任务。

Result: 评估了24个最先进的多模态大语言模型，在零样本设置下，表现最佳的模型在疾病筛查中达到约58%的准确率，但在疾病分期等挑战性任务上表现仍不理想。

Conclusion: 该数据集、整理流程和排行榜将公开释放，有望推动眼科AI应用发展，减轻全球视力威胁疾病的负担。

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

*Xingtao Ling,Chenlin Fu,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出AFGeo，一种无锚框的跨视角目标地理定位方法，直接预测边界框的四个方向偏移，无需预定义锚框，结合高斯位置编码和跨视角目标关联模块，实现轻量高效的高性能定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨视角目标地理定位方法大多基于锚框范式，这种方法受到预定义锚框的限制。为了消除这种依赖，需要开发无锚框的定位方法。

Method: AFGeo直接为每个像素预测到真实边界框的四个方向偏移（左、右、上、下），采用高斯位置编码建模查询图像中的点击点位置不确定性，并引入跨视角目标关联模块来关联不同视角下的同一目标及其周围上下文。

Result: 该方法在基准数据集上达到了最先进的性能，同时模型轻量且计算高效。

Conclusion: AFGeo通过无锚框定位范式，结合高斯位置编码和跨视角目标关联，有效解决了跨视角目标地理定位问题，在性能和效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态检索模型(如CLIP)在处理融合图像-文本模态的检索任务时性能下降，需要开发能够检索不同模态组合的统一模型。

Method: 提出GCL损失函数，利用现有图像-字幕配对数据集，在小批量内跨所有模态执行对比学习，学习统一表示空间。

Result: 在M-BEIR、MMEB和CoVR基准测试中，GCL在现有多模态检索模型(VISTA、CLIP、TinyCLIP)上实现了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: GCL是一种无需额外数据标注的有效方法，能够显著提升多模态检索性能，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统CNN需要大量数据训练，但数据收集成本高昂。视频游戏能生成逼真的3D模型，可作为合成图像的替代数据源。

Method: 创建三个包含真实和合成卡车图像的数据集，使用三种YOLO架构进行训练和测试，通过召回率、精确率、F1分数和mAP等指标评估性能。

Result: 合成图像被证明是可靠的训练数据源，所有网络性能均有提升，最高mAP达到99%。Mann-Whitney U检验确认结果具有统计显著性。

Conclusion: 合成图像可用于训练神经网络，为知识提取提供可靠、低成本的数据源。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

Motivation: 现有遥感图像描述研究主要关注图像级别，缺乏对象级的细粒度解释，无法充分利用遥感图像中丰富的语义和结构信息。

Method: 提出DescribeEarth多模态大语言模型架构，集成尺度自适应聚焦策略和领域引导融合模块，利用遥感视觉语言模型特征编码高分辨率细节和遥感类别先验，同时保持全局上下文。

Result: DescribeEarth模型在DE-Benchmark上持续优于最先进的通用多模态大语言模型，在事实准确性、描述丰富性和语法正确性方面表现优异，特别是在捕捉内在对象特征和周围环境属性方面。

Conclusion: Geo-DLC任务和DescribeEarth模型为遥感图像的对象级细粒度描述提供了有效解决方案，在简单、复杂甚至分布外遥感场景中都表现出色。

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

Result: YOLOv9模型表现最佳，准确率91.3%，检测时间146ms，成功集成到制造硬件和SCADA系统中。

Conclusion: 提出的自动缺陷检测方法有效可行，可轻松应用于工业制造中的其他组件检测。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

Motivation: 解决AI生成图像检测和源模型识别的挑战，现有方法容易过拟合特定伪造特征，且缺乏大规模标注数据集。

Method: 提出开集少样本源识别范式，构建OmniDFA框架进行图像真实性评估和合成源识别，使用OmniFake数据集支持研究。

Result: OmniDFA在开集识别方面表现出色，在AIGI检测上达到最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 该工作为AI生成图像检测和源模型识别提供了有效的解决方案和宝贵的数据资源。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

TL;DR: AIMCoT是一个主动信息驱动的多模态思维链框架，通过上下文增强注意力图生成、主动视觉探测和动态注意力转移触发三个协同组件，解决了现有方法依赖不可靠注意力图和被动选择策略的问题，显著提升了多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态思维链方法依赖简单的启发式方法构建交错思维链，通常基于注意力图，但实证分析显示这些注意力图不可靠。其被动无目的的选择策略和任意触发机制在捕捉模型对信息的认知需求方面存在严重不足。

Method: 提出AIMCoT框架，包含三个协同组件：1) 上下文增强注意力图生成(CAG)，缓解文本-视觉粒度不平衡；2) 主动视觉探测(AVP)，基于信息理论主动选择最能帮助回答问题的图像区域；3) 动态注意力转移触发(DAT)，通过监控模型文本到视觉的注意力转移智能确定插入视觉信息的最佳时机。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的基准测试上进行广泛实验，AIMCoT在不同设置下显著优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过主动获取信息和动态构建推理过程，AIMCoT代表了向更鲁棒、有效和类人化多模态推理的关键一步。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文揭示了扩散模型记忆训练数据的内在机制，发现记忆主要由早期去噪过程中的过度估计驱动，而非简单的过拟合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得成功，但存在记忆训练数据的问题，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有研究未能从根本上解释记忆现象的发生机制。

Method: 通过分析扩散和去噪过程的潜在空间动态，研究训练样本的过度估计如何影响去噪轨迹和收敛行为。

Result: 发现：(i)记忆不能仅用过拟合解释，训练损失在记忆下反而更大；(ii)记忆提示将训练图像注入噪声预测，强制潜在轨迹收敛；(iii)中间潜在分解显示初始随机性被快速抑制，被记忆内容取代。

Conclusion: 早期过度估计是扩散模型记忆现象的核心机制，这一发现为理解和缓解记忆问题提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

TL;DR: ProbMED是一种多模态医学视觉语言预训练模型，采用概率对比学习来建模嵌入分布，将四种医学模态（胸片、心电图、超声心动图和临床文本）对齐到统一的概率嵌入空间中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学视觉语言预训练模型无法直接处理医学信息的多对多映射关系，而医学决策需要整合从影像到临床叙述的多样化医学信息。

Method: 使用概率对比学习建模嵌入分布而非确定性估计，采用InfoNCE损失和Hellinger距离整合模态间分布，引入概率合成采样损失捕获模态特定均值和方差以改善模态内绑定。

Result: 在13个医学数据集上的实验表明，该模型在跨模态检索、零样本和少样本分类方面优于现有Med-VLPMs，并展示了多模态整合用于预后的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ProbMED通过概率嵌入方法显著改善了医学模态内和模态间的绑定，为多模态医学决策提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities -- chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text -- into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过度简化的成对比较，通过基本扰动或基于相似性检索生成单个负样本图像，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉问题。

Method: 在CLIP空间中嵌入提示和候选图像，应用稀疏自编码器揭示语义偏差为可解释因子。基于重构难度、与正样本的语义偏差和相互多样性选择负样本。采用Plackett-Luce目标和重要性采样策略处理多负样本比较。

Result: 在五个不同基准测试上的实验表明，MISP-DPO在多项指标上优于现有方法，特别是在多模态对齐方面表现突出。

Conclusion: 语义感知的多负样本采样在基于偏好的学习中具有显著有效性，MISP-DPO框架为多模态偏好优化提供了更全面和有效的监督信号。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and
model will be available at: https://github.com/chenshunpeng/SAGE.

TL;DR: LaTo是一个基于地标标记化的扩散变换器，用于细粒度、身份保持的人脸编辑，通过量化地标坐标、统一位置编码和链式思维地标预测，显著提升了身份保持和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的人脸编辑模型在精确属性控制和身份保持方面存在困难，传统方法将地标作为刚性几何约束，在条件地标与源图像差异较大时会损害身份信息。

Method: 提出LaTo框架，包括：1）地标标记器将原始地标坐标量化为离散面部标记；2）位置映射位置编码统一处理面部和图像标记；3）利用视觉语言模型通过链式思维推理目标地标。

Result: 在身份保持方面比现有最优方法提升7.8%，在语义一致性方面提升4.6%，并构建了包含15万真实人脸对的HFL-150K数据集。

Conclusion: LaTo通过创新的地标标记化和统一处理框架，有效解决了人脸编辑中的身份保持和精确控制问题，在多个指标上显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Result: 在MOSEv1挑战赛测试集上获得86.37%的J&F得分，排名第一

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对复杂场景下的视频对象分割挑战

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term
object disappearances and reappearances, as well as the presence of small and
inconspicuous objects. In this paper, we present our improved method,
Confidence-Guided Fusion Segmentation (CGFSeg), for the VOS task in the MOSEv1
Challenge. During training, the feature extractor of SAM2 is frozen, while the
remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in
complex scenarios.

*Donghwan Kim,Tae-Kyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于SO(3)扩散模型的人体网格恢复方法，通过建模3D旋转参数的分布来解决单张RGB图像中2D到3D姿态恢复的固有模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的确定性方法只能回归单一输出，而概率性方法在准确性和样本多样性之间存在权衡。本文旨在克服这些限制，通过建模与2D观测对齐的概率分布来更好地处理姿态恢复的模糊性。

Method: 使用SO(3)扩散模型生成3D旋转参数的分布，通过条件丢弃实现无条件和图像条件生成。采用transformer学习人体关节的层次结构，使用小型MLP去噪模型学习基于潜在向量的每个关节分布。

Result: 实验证明该方法能够有效预测准确的姿态概率分布，在建模模糊性方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 所提出的SO(3)扩散模型能够有效解决人体网格恢复中的模糊性问题，生成与2D观测对齐的准确姿态概率分布。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

TL;DR: GeoDrag是一种基于几何引导的拖拽式图像编辑方法，通过整合3D几何线索和2D空间先验，解决了传统2D像素平面编辑在几何密集型场景中的不精确和不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于拖拽的图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，缺乏3D几何线索，导致在旋转和透视变换等几何密集型场景中产生不精确和不一致的编辑结果。

Method: 提出统一的位移场联合编码3D几何和2D空间先验，采用无冲突分区策略隔离编辑区域，在单次前向传播中实现连贯编辑。

Result: 在各种编辑场景下的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，显示出优越的精度、结构一致性和可靠的多点编辑能力。

Conclusion: GeoDrag通过几何引导实现了精确、一致和结构保持的图像编辑，解决了传统方法在几何变换中的局限性。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IPDRecon是一种基于图像平面解码的室内场景重建方法，通过减少对多视角几何约束的依赖，利用单视图内的丰富空间信息，显著提升了在视角受限情况下的重建稳定性和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于体素的室内场景重建方法依赖多视角像素反投影射线交点作为弱几何约束来确定空间位置，导致重建质量严重依赖输入视角密度，在重叠区域和未观测区域表现不佳。

Method: 提出IPDRecon框架，包含三个核心组件：像素级置信度编码器(PCE)、仿射补偿模块(ACM)和图像平面空间解码器(IPSD)，通过物理成像过程解码2D图像中编码的3D结构信息。

Result: 在ScanNetV2上的实验表明，IPDRecon实现了优越的重建稳定性，当视角数量减少40%时仍能保持近乎相同的质量，变异系数仅0.24%，性能保持率99.7%，最大性能下降仅0.42%。

Conclusion: 利用单视图内的空间信息为实际应用中的视角受限场景提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned
captioning in financial short-form videos (SVs) by testing joint reasoning over
transcripts (T), audio (A), and video (V). Using 624 annotated YouTube SVs, we
assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial
short-form video captioning and illustrate the potential and challenges of
grounding complex visual cues in this domain. All code and data can be found on

Abstract: Ultrasound is crucial in modern medicine but faces challenges like operator
dependence, image noise, and real-time scanning, hindering AI integration.
While large multimodal models excel in other medical imaging areas, they
struggle with ultrasound's complexities. To address this, we introduce Dolphin
v1.0 (V1) and its reasoning-augmented version, Dolphin R1-the first large-scale
multimodal ultrasound foundation models unifying diverse clinical tasks in a

TL;DR: ART-VITON是一个基于测量引导的扩散框架，用于虚拟试穿任务，通过线性逆问题重构和轨迹对齐求解器，有效保留非试穿区域的身份和背景信息，消除边界伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试穿方法在保留非试穿区域（如人物身份和背景）方面存在挑战，直接替换策略会导致边界伪影。需要一种能渐进式保持测量一致性的方法。

Method: 将VITON重构为线性逆问题，采用轨迹对齐求解器；集成残差先验初始化减少训练-推理不匹配；使用无伪影测量引导采样，结合数据一致性、频率级校正和周期性标准去噪。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和SHHQ-1.0数据集上的实验表明，ART-VITON能有效保留身份和背景，消除边界伪影，在视觉保真度和鲁棒性上优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量引导的扩散框架成功解决了虚拟试穿中的边界伪影问题，在保持非试穿区域一致性的同时提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RLHF的方法依赖成本高昂的人工标注配对图像偏好数据或学习奖励函数，存在可扩展性限制。

Method: TPO框架通过使用大语言模型扰动原始标题构建不匹配提示，训练模型偏好匹配提示。扩展DPO和KTO算法为TDPO和TKTO。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法在人类偏好得分和文本-图像对齐方面均优于原始方法。

Conclusion: TPO框架为文本到图像模型对齐提供了一种无需配对图像偏好数据的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

Abstract: AI models capable of comprehending humor hold real-world promise -- for
example, enhancing engagement in human-machine interactions. To gauge and
diagnose the capacity of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for humor
understanding, we introduce v-HUB, a novel visual-centric video humor
understanding benchmark. v-HUB comprises a curated collection of minimally
verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法在文本到图像模型对齐中存在训练不稳定和高方差问题，阻碍收敛速度并影响图像质量，主要原因是生成采样器的数学结构导致跨时间步的信用分配不成比例。

Method: 引入比例信用策略优化(PCPO)框架，通过稳定的目标重构和原则性的时间步重加权来强制执行比例信用分配。

Result: PCPO显著稳定了训练过程，加速了收敛速度，提升了图像质量，有效缓解了模型崩溃问题，在所有方面都大幅优于现有策略梯度基线方法。

Conclusion: PCPO通过解决不成比例信用分配问题，为文本到图像模型的强化学习对齐提供了更稳定高效的训练框架。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型在图像编辑中的反演方法虽然能忠实重建源图像，但限制了编辑灵活性，难以准确遵循目标文本提示进行编辑。

Method: 分析噪声图特性以增强可编辑性，提出可编辑噪声优化方法，通过最小化重建和编辑噪声图之间的差异来对齐期望编辑。

Result: 在广泛图像编辑任务中，ENM Inversion在内容保持和编辑保真度方面优于现有方法，并能扩展到视频编辑保持时间一致性。

Conclusion: ENM Inversion是一种有效的反演技术，能够同时实现高质量的内容保持和目标文本提示的忠实编辑。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Chris McIntosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoingECG是一个概率性师生模型，利用不确定性感知的ECG嵌入和ECHO监督来改进基于ECG的心脏功能预测，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下优于现有ECG基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心电图(ECG)成本低且易获取，而超声心动图(ECHO)虽然对临床心脏评估至关重要但资源消耗大。研究旨在利用ECG预测传统上需要更复杂ECHO才能获得的关键结果，使ECG成为预测心脏功能的更易获取方法。

Method: 采用概率师生模型，整合概率跨模态嵌入(PCME++)和基于ECHO-文本对训练的视觉语言预训练模型(ECHO-CLIP)，将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中。

Result: 实验和外部验证表明，EchoingECG在基于ECG的ECHO预测任务中，在零样本、少样本和微调设置下均优于最先进的ECG基础模型。方差估计有助于识别ECG中的不确定性区域。

Conclusion: EchoingECG成功地将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中，提高了ECG在心脏功能预测中的性能，同时通过方差估计增强了模型性能的理解。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is
available: https://github.com/mcintoshML/EchoingECG.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Point-It-Out (PIO)基准测试，用于系统评估视觉语言模型在具身推理中的精确视觉定位能力，包含三个层次：指称对象定位、任务驱动指向和视觉轨迹预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要通过基于图像标注的多选题评估VLMs的具身推理能力，缺乏对精确视觉定位能力的系统评估。

Method: 构建PIO基准，包含三个层次评估阶段(S1-S3)，数据来自室内、厨房、驾驶和机器人操作等具身智能关键领域，测试了10多个最先进的VLMs。

Result: 发现GPT-4o等强通用模型在精确视觉定位上表现不如某些开源模型；MoLMO在S1和S2表现良好但在需要视觉轨迹规划的S3中表现不佳。

Conclusion: PIO基准揭示了VLMs在精确视觉定位能力上的局限性，为评估具身推理能力提供了新的系统框架。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

TL;DR: 提出DSGA模块结合LoRA，在极少量数据下高效微调SAM模型，用于农业场景中小密集物体的精确分割，参数效率高且性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决农业计算机视觉任务中训练数据有限、田间条件复杂导致的参数高效微调挑战，特别是小密集物体的精确分割问题。

Method: 使用动态相似性图适应模块(DSGA)构建动态相似性图，结合可学习多项式衰减初始化权重排序机制和自适应局部特征聚合，并与LoRA结合形成互补优化框架。

Result: 在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上，DSGA+LoRA在2、4、8、10样本设置下均表现优异，结构度量提升17.31%，自适应F度量提升62.36%，参数仅需4.00M（原SAM的4.26%）。

Conclusion: 该方法在极少量数据下实现了高效的特征适应，为自动化农业监测提供了实用解决方案，在复杂田间条件下实现了准确的豆荚计数。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Logo-VGR方法，将logo识别重新定义为基于比较的任务，通过领域特定的多模态推理来解决产品审核中的开放世界logo识别问题，在OOD设置下比基线方法提升了近10个点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM主要在通用基准上评估，在智能产品审核等特定领域应用不足。传统logo识别方法需要记忆数万个品牌表示，在实际场景中不实用。

Method: 将logo识别重新定义为基于比较的任务，匹配产品图像与候选logo而非直接生成品牌标签。引入Logo Perception Grounding注入领域知识，Logo-Guided Visual Grounded Reasoning增强推理能力。

Result: Logo-VGR在OOD设置下比强基线方法提升了近10个点，展示了优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Logo-VGR通过领域特定的多模态推理方法，有效解决了开放世界logo识别问题，显著提升了模型对未见品牌的泛化性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the
state-of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing
data, we organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023.
The training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

Motivation: 现有图像描述自动评估指标主要针对短描述设计，不适用于长描述评估；现有LLM-as-a-Judge方法推理速度慢且视觉信息融合效率低。

Method: 提出VELA评估指标，采用新颖的LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge框架；构建LongCap-Arena基准，包含7,805张图像、对应的人类参考描述和候选描述，以及32,246个人类标注。

Result: VELA在LongCap-Arena基准上超越了现有评估指标，并实现了超人类水平的性能表现。

Conclusion: VELA是评估长图像描述的有效自动评估指标，在LongCap-Arena基准上表现出色，解决了长描述评估的挑战。

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然扩散和流匹配模型在图像合成方面表现出色，但将奖励引导方法应用于图像编辑任务（需要在保持源图像语义内容的同时增强目标奖励）仍未被充分探索。

Method: 将编辑过程表述为轨迹最优控制问题，将扩散模型的反向过程视为从源图像出发的可控轨迹，迭代更新伴随状态来引导编辑过程。

Result: 在多种编辑任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于反转的无训练引导基线，在奖励最大化和源图像保真度之间实现了更好的平衡，且没有奖励作弊问题。

Conclusion: 该框架为奖励引导图像编辑提供了一种有效的无需训练解决方案，能够在保持图像内容的同时实现目标奖励的优化。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

<details>

Motivation: 虽然推理能力在大型语言模型中很重要，但扩展到视觉语言模型时出现了新问题：多模态推理在增强逻辑推理的同时会损害感知基础，导致视觉遗忘现象。

Method: 提出Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO)方法，明确引导推理过程朝向视觉基础轨迹，增强模型对视觉信息的依赖。

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B模型显著增强了模型对视觉信息的依赖，在多个基准测试中取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: VAPO方法有效解决了多模态推理中的视觉遗忘问题，平衡了推理能力和感知基础，为视觉语言模型的发展提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

Motivation: 多模态符号逻辑推理在自动驾驶、医疗诊断等高风险应用中至关重要，其严谨的确定性推理有助于防止严重后果。需要评估当前视觉语言模型在此类推理上的能力。

Method: 创建MuSLR基准，包含1,093个实例，涵盖7个领域，35个原子符号逻辑和976个逻辑组合，推理深度2-9。提出LogiCAM模块化框架，将形式逻辑规则应用于多模态输入。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在多模态符号逻辑推理方面存在显著局限性，约70%的失败源于模态间的逻辑不一致。LogiCAM展示了通过形式逻辑规则集成可以显著提升性能，为未来改进提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All

Conclusion: 统一的纯补丁框架可以实现快速、轻量校准的部署，无需精心设计的文本提示，为实际视觉检测中基础模型的选择和配置提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、硬件无关的LiDAR点云彩色化解决方案，在低光照条件下表现出色，简化了设置流程并实现了实时处理。

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

Result: 在三个癌症队列上的结果证实了该方法在解决少样本病理诊断任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MAPLE框架通过整合多尺度视觉语义和分层预测，显著提升了少样本全切片图像分类的性能，为病理诊断提供了更精细和准确的方法。

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

Conclusion: DeepSketcher通过工具无关的灵活"用图像思考"方法，为多模态推理提供了有效的解决方案，展示了该范式的潜力。

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Motivation: 解决多参数3D脑部MRI视觉问答中多模态融合和有限图像-文本配对监督的挑战。

Method: 采用提示条件分层混合专家架构，集成合成视觉问答协议生成医学相关VQA，并与医学专家合作进行临床验证。

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation
annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation.
mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across
multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the
first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts
and prompt-conditioned routing. We have included our source code in the
supplementary materials and will release our dataset upon publication.

Conclusion: 该研究为多模态多轮对话安全提供了系统性解决方案，通过MMDS数据集和LLaVAShield工具有效应对了新兴的安全挑战，支持未来相关研究发展。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLM-FO1是一个新颖框架，将物体感知从脆弱的坐标生成问题转化为稳健的特征检索任务，通过混合细粒度区域编码器和基于token的引用系统，在不损害基础模型通用视觉理解能力的前提下实现卓越的细粒度感知性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在高级场景理解方面表现出色，但在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务上表现不佳，这源于语言中心架构生成精确数值坐标的固有困难。

Method: 提出VLM-FO1作为即插即用模块，集成混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和基于token的引用系统，通过两阶段训练策略生成富含语义和空间细节的区域token。

Result: 实验表明VLM-FO1在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，在物体定位、区域生成理解和视觉区域推理方面表现出色。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1建立了构建感知感知视觉语言模型的有效灵活范式，弥合了高级推理与细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

### [152] [The Impact of Scaling Training Data on Adversarial Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25927)
*Marco Zimmerli,Andreas Plesner,Till Aczel,Roger Wattenhofer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现对抗鲁棒性遵循数据量和模型规模的对数缩放定律：数据量增加10倍平均降低攻击成功率3.2%，模型规模增加10倍平均降低攻击成功率13.4%。数据质量、架构和训练目标比原始规模对实现广谱对抗鲁棒性更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管深度神经网络架构和训练范式有所进步，但仍然容易受到对抗样本的攻击。研究旨在探索训练数据特性如何影响对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 评估了36个最先进的视觉模型，涵盖监督学习、自监督学习和对比学习方法，在1.2M到22B图像的数据集上训练。在六种黑盒攻击类别下评估：随机扰动、两种几何掩码、COCO对象操作、ImageNet-C损坏和ImageNet-R风格迁移。

Result: 对抗鲁棒性遵循数据量和模型规模的对数缩放定律。一些在精选数据集上训练的自监督模型（如DINOv2）优于在更大但质量较差数据集上训练的模型。对抗性微调改善了结构变化的泛化能力，但对颜色分布的泛化能力没有改善。人类评估显示人类与机器视觉之间存在持续差距。

Conclusion: 虽然扩展规模可以改善鲁棒性，但数据质量、架构和训练目标在实现广谱对抗鲁棒性方面比原始规模起着更决定性的作用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMMAD是一个统一的多模态多类别异常检测框架，通过MoE驱动的特征解压缩机制实现自适应和分离的重建，在9个数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法将模态和类别视为独立因素，导致解决方案碎片化、内存开销过大，且基于重建的多类方法难以处理跨域大变化，造成正态边界扭曲、域干扰和高误报率。

Method: 采用MoE驱动的特征解压缩机制，遵循"从通用到特定"范式：编码阶段将多模态输入压缩为紧凑通用特征，解码阶段通过稀疏门控交叉MoE将通用特征解压缩为模态特定和类别特定形式。

Result: 在9个异常检测数据集上实现最先进性能，涵盖3个领域、12种模态和66个类别，同时通过分组动态过滤和MoE-in-MoE结构将参数使用减少75%。

Conclusion: UniMMAD通过统一框架有效解决了多模态多类别异常检测中的碎片化问题和性能瓶颈，在保持稀疏激活和快速推理的同时显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CO3方法，通过校正采样策略改善多概念提示在文本到图像扩散模型中的保真度，避免概念缺失或碰撞问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多概念提示（如"猫和狗"）在扩散模型中常出现的概念缺失、模糊或碰撞问题，这些问题是模型在训练中过度强调单个概念导致的模式混合。

Method: 引入校正采样策略，引导模型远离联合提示行为与任何单个概念重叠过强的区域，转向所有概念能够平衡共存的"纯"联合模式。

Result: 在多样化多概念提示上的实验显示，相比标准基线和先前组合方法，CO3在概念覆盖度、平衡性和鲁棒性方面都有改进，减少了概念丢失或扭曲。

Conclusion: 轻量级校正引导可以显著缓解现代扩散系统中脆弱的语义对齐行为，该方法即插即用，无需模型调优，可与标准无分类器引导互补。

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有医学报告生成方法依赖单独训练的检测模块、需要大量专家标注、标注成本高以及由于数据集间病理分布偏差导致的泛化性受限等问题。

Method: 提出自监督解剖一致性学习(SS-ACL)，构建层次化解剖图，通过递归重建细粒度解剖区域实现空间对齐，并引入基于解剖一致性的区域级对比学习增强语义对齐。

Result: 在无需专家标注的情况下，词汇准确性提升10%，临床有效性提升25%，在零样本视觉定位任务中超越当前领先视觉基础模型8%。

Conclusion: SS-ACL框架能够生成准确且视觉可解释的医学报告，在多个下游视觉任务中表现出色，为临床工作流程提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available

Motivation: 现有交互式分割方法局限于粗粒度的实例级目标，而非交互式方法在稀疏真实扫描数据上表现不佳且缺乏标注数据，需要解决细粒度3D部件分割的瓶颈问题。

Method: 开发了新的3D数据合成流水线创建大规模场景级数据集，并提出交互式框架PinPoint3D，通过用户点点击实现多粒度3D分割。

Conclusion: 该工作代表了在复杂3D环境中实现更精细和精确的机器感知与交互的重要进展。

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

Motivation: 当前VICL方法基于相似性优先假设缺乏充分理论依据，且Partial2Global依赖随机采样导致覆盖不完整和冗余比较，影响全局排序质量。

Method: 提出RH-Partial2Global方法：1）使用刀切法共形预测构建可靠的备选集合；2）采用覆盖设计采样确保成对偏好的全面均匀覆盖。

Result: 大量实验表明，RH-Partial2Global在多种视觉任务中表现优异，性能优于Partial2Global方法。

Conclusion: RH-Partial2Global通过可靠的备选集构建和全面的采样策略，有效提升了视觉上下文学习中示例选择的可靠性和完整性。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

Motivation: 现有视频编辑模型因传统注意力机制的二次计算复杂度，难以处理长时长和高分辨率视频，限制了实时视频处理等实际应用。

Method: 将线性时空聚合模块集成到基于扩散的视频模型中，利用RWKV变换器的双向加权键值循环机制捕获全局依赖并保持时间一致性。

Result: 相比最先进的基于扩散的视频编辑方法，实现了最高3.7倍加速和60%内存使用降低，同时在帧一致性和文本对齐方面保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该方法在长视频编辑中与自注意力架构的速度差距更加显著，为高效视频编辑提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

*Hanwei Zhu,Yu Tian,Keyan Ding,Baoliang Chen,Bolin Chen,Shiqi Wang,Weisi Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了AgenticIQA，一个模块化的代理框架，将视觉语言模型与传统图像质量评估工具动态集成，通过分解任务为四个子任务来提升评估准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IQA方法使用固定模型输出标量分数，难以适应多样化失真、用户特定查询和可解释性需求，且评分与解释通常独立处理，忽视了它们的相互依赖性。

Method: AgenticIQA将IQA分解为失真检测、失真分析、工具选择和工具执行四个子任务，由规划器、执行器和总结器协调完成。规划器制定任务特定策略，执行器通过工具调用收集感知证据，总结器整合证据生成准确分数和人类对齐的解释。

Result: 在多个IQA数据集上的广泛实验表明，AgenticIQA在评分准确性和解释对齐方面持续超越强基线方法。

Conclusion: AgenticIQA通过模块化代理框架有效解决了传统IQA方法的局限性，在评分准确性和可解释性方面表现出色，并引入了大规模指令数据集和评估基准来支持IQA代理的训练和评估。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

TL;DR: PFDepth是首个针孔-鱼眼异构多视角深度估计框架，通过联合优化两种相机的互补特性，在统一架构中处理任意组合的针孔和鱼眼相机，在KITTI-360和RealHet数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用针孔和鱼眼图像的互补特性（无失真vs失真、小FOVvs大FOV、远场vs近场）进行联合优化，解决异构多视角深度估计问题。

Method: 1) 将异构视图的2D特征显式提升到规范3D体积空间；2) 设计异构空间融合模块处理融合失真感知的体积特征；3) 将传统体素融合重新表述为3D高斯表示，使用可学习潜在高斯球动态适应局部图像纹理；4) 将融合体积特征渲染为多视角深度图。

Result: 在KITTI-360和RealHet数据集上超越了当前主流深度网络，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统研究异构针孔-鱼眼深度估计的工作，提供了技术新颖性和有价值的经验见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

*Rajendra K. Ray,Manish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合扩散和波动特性的四阶非线性PDE模型，用于抑制乘性噪声，相比二阶PDE模型能更好地减少块状伪影并保留细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声时会在去噪早期引入块状伪影，需要开发更有效的模型来解决这个问题。

Method: 使用四阶非线性PDE模型，其中扩散部分基于拉普拉斯算子和强度值进行噪声抑制，波动部分用于保持精细细节和纹理。对于彩色图像，将去噪过程独立应用于每个通道。

Result: 在PSNR、MSSIM和SI等指标上，该模型在灰度图像、SAR图像和彩色图像上都优于现有的二阶各向异性扩散方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的四阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声方面比传统二阶模型表现更好，能有效减少伪影并保持图像细节和结构。

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

*Yuqi Xiao,Yingying Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SETR提出了一种新的零样本组合图像检索方法，通过两阶段检索策略解决CLIP方法的局限性：粗检索阶段使用交集驱动策略过滤干扰信息，细粒度重排序阶段利用多模态LLM进行语义相关性判断。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于CLIP的方法在组合图像检索中的两个核心问题：联合特征融合会携带不相关背景细节，以及全局余弦相似度无法解析细粒度语义关系。

Method: 两阶段检索框架：1）粗检索阶段采用交集驱动策略保留参考图像和相对文本的重叠语义；2）重排序阶段使用低秩适配的多模态LLM进行二元语义相关性判断。

Result: 在CIRR、Fashion-IQ和CIRCO数据集上达到新的最先进性能，在CIRR上的Recall@1提升了15.15个百分点。

Conclusion: 两阶段推理为稳健和可移植的零样本组合图像检索提供了一个通用范式。

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoLink是一个多模态框架，通过整合OpenStreetMap数据来增强遥感基础模型，在预训练和下游任务阶段都实现了性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感数据与OSM数据之间的模态差异（数据结构、内容和空间粒度不同），使遥感基础模型能够有效利用丰富的地理上下文信息。

Method: 使用OSM数据提供多粒度学习信号，通过跨模态空间相关性指导信息交互；引入图像掩码重建实现稀疏输入的高效预训练；为下游任务生成单模态和多模态细粒度编码。

Result: 实验表明，在预训练中整合OSM数据提升了遥感图像编码器性能，在下游任务中融合RS和OSM数据增强了模型对复杂地理场景的适应性。

Conclusion: 多模态协同在推进高级地理空间人工智能方面具有巨大潜力，空间相关性在多模态地理数据整合中起着关键作用。

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

TL;DR: 本文提出PatchVSR方法，利用预训练视频扩散模型进行补丁级视频超分辨率，通过双流适配器和位置信息注入解决补丁语义不完整问题，实现高效4K超分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法采用全尺寸处理，计算量大且输出分辨率固定。预训练视频生成模型具有生成潜力，但需要适应补丁级细节生成。

Method: 提出PatchVSR方法：1) 双流适配器（补丁分支保持内容保真度，全局分支提供上下文特征）；2) 注入补丁位置信息；3) 多补丁联合调制确保视觉一致性。

Result: 实验证明该方法能在补丁级别合成高保真、高分辨率细节，基于512x512基础模型实现高效4K视频超分辨率，具有极高效率。

Conclusion: 补丁级视频超分辨率方法克服了全尺寸处理的局限性，实现了高效高质量的视频超分辨率，为高分辨率视频生成提供了灵活解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)框架，通过基于视觉Transformer的软因果掩码引导空间变化噪声注入，增强模型在分布外场景下的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过复杂生成模型或对抗训练追求领域不变性，但可能忽略了泛化的底层因果机制。在生物医学图像等分布偏移普遍且细微的领域，需要更有效的OOD泛化方法。

Method: CGP框架使用视觉Transformer生成软因果掩码，根据掩码对输入图像施加空间变化的高斯噪声——背景区域施加更强扰动，前景区域施加较弱扰动，从而鼓励模型依赖因果相关特征而非虚假相关性。

Result: 在WILDS基准测试Camelyon17上的实验结果表明，CGP相比最先进的OOD基线方法获得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 因果扰动作为一种轻量级框架，具有实现可靠且可解释泛化的潜力，为OOD泛化问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

TL;DR: SeMoBridge通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，解决CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，在低数据场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在零样本任务中表现良好，但在少样本分类中存在模态内不对齐问题，这是由于模态间隙和仅跨模态训练目标导致的，使得直接图像比较不可靠。

Method: 提出SeMoBridge方法，通过语义模态桥将图像映射到文本模态，保持语义内容不变。该方法为闭式解，可选多模态监督训练，结合图像和文本对齐损失优化投影。

Result: 训练版本SeMoBridge-T仅需少量训练时间，整体优于其他方法，特别是在低数据场景（1、2和4样本）中表现突出。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge有效解决了CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，提供了一种轻量级且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

TL;DR: 扩展HAMMER模型以处理全局场景不一致性问题，特别是前景-背景不匹配。通过轻量级分割引导评分(SGS)管道，在不重新训练的情况下显著提升对全局操作的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER在多模态操作检测方面表现优异，但在处理主体被错误放置到不合理背景中的全局场景不一致时表现不佳。这源于标签空间偏差、局部注意力焦点和虚假的文本-前景对齐问题。

Method: 提出分割引导评分(SGS)管道：使用人物/面部分割掩码分离前景和背景区域，通过联合视觉语言模型提取嵌入，计算区域感知一致性分数，并与HAMMER的原始预测融合。

Result: SGS在推理阶段运行，计算开销可忽略，显著提升了二元检测、定位和token级解释的鲁棒性，特别是在全局操作检测方面。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了区域感知推理在多模态虚假信息检测中的重要性，为处理全局场景不一致性问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGM4数据集仅限于局部操作（如人脸交换、属性编辑和字幕更改），无法处理现实中日益普遍的全局不一致问题，特别是前景-背景不匹配。

Method: 使用OpenAI的gpt-image-1生成新闻风格图像，将真实人物置于荒谬或不可能的背景下，并创建三种字幕条件（字面、文本属性和文本分割），形成三种新的操作类别。

Result: 创建了DGM4+数据集，包含FG-BG、FG-BG+TA和FG-BG+TS三种全局操作类别，通过质量控制管道确保数据质量。

Conclusion: DGM4+数据集填补了全局操作检测的空白，为多模态模型（如HAMMER）提供了更全面的评估基准，有助于提升伪造检测能力。

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at

Conclusion: 这种基于几何概念的方法具有广泛的应用潜力，为处理对称性问题提供了一种新的可持续解决方案。

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

Motivation: 现有自监督模型在语义占据预测中采用复杂渲染策略导致训练阶段计算成本和内存使用过高，特别是新视角合成技术。

Method: 使用Grounded-SAM和Metric3Dv2基础模型生成3D伪真值标签，并利用时序信息进行标签稠密化，提出简化模型EasyOcc仅从伪标签学习。

Result: 在OccNeRF模型中mIoU从9.73提升至14.09（提升45%），EasyOcc模型达到13.86 mIoU，在完整场景评估中达到7.71 mIoU，超越之前最佳模型31%。

Conclusion: 基础模型、时序上下文和损失计算空间选择在自监督学习的全面场景理解中具有关键重要性。

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical
analysis, and real-time game analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有文本到场景方法在处理复杂几何结构、对象变换和复杂指令遵循方面的局限性。

Method: 集成基于物理、功能和上下文属性的对象检索，结合隐式和显式布局约束进行对象放置，并使用碰撞感知的空间推理优化位置。

Result: 在从简单到复杂的室内配置指令评估中，Reason-3D在视觉保真度、约束遵循和资源检索质量方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推动了文本到场景生成领域，还展示了现代大型推理模型的高级空间推理能力，并发布了代码库以促进相关研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

*Shigui Li,Wei Chen,Delu Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EVODiff方法，从信息论角度优化扩散模型的推理过程，通过优化条件熵来减少不确定性，显著提升了生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面表现出色，但存在推理速度慢和训练-推理差异的问题。现有梯度求解器缺乏信息传输效率的理论基础。

Method: 引入信息论视角分析扩散模型推理过程，提出基于条件熵优化的EVODiff方法，通过优化条件方差来最小化转换和重构误差。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上，EVODiff在10次函数评估时将重构误差降低45.5%（FID从5.10提升到2.78）；在ImageNet-256上，将NFE成本降低25%（从20到15次）；同时改善了文本到图像生成质量并减少伪影。

Conclusion: EVODiff方法在理论和实验上都优于现有最先进的梯度求解器，为扩散模型的推理过程提供了更高效的信息论优化框架。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen是首个基于视觉自回归(VAR)模型的前馈主题驱动生成框架，通过双路径注入策略分离主题的高层语义身份和低层细节，在保持高质量的同时显著降低采样延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前主题驱动生成方法在计算效率和零样本能力之间的权衡问题：要么需要昂贵的逐主题微调，要么使用推理速度慢的扩散模型。

Method: 采用双路径注入策略：语义编码器提取主题抽象身份并通过解耦交叉注意力注入；内容编码器捕获视觉细节并通过多模态注意力机制集成。

Result: 在主题保真度和图像质量上与最先进的基于扩散的方法相当，但采样延迟显著降低。

Conclusion: EchoGen成功将VAR模型的快速采样优势与主题驱动生成能力相结合，为高效高质量的主题驱动生成提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

*Sachith Abeywickrama,Emadeldeen Eldele,Min Wu,Xiaoli Li,Chau Yuen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了EntroPE，一种基于熵的动态补丁编码器，通过信息论标准动态检测时间序列中的自然过渡点来构建补丁，解决了传统固定长度补丁破坏时间连贯性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于补丁的时间序列预测方法使用时间无关的补丁构建策略，任意的起始位置和固定长度会破坏时间连贯性，分割自然过渡点，从而削弱短期依赖关系和表示学习效果。

Method: EntroPE包含两个关键模块：基于熵的动态补丁器（EDP），使用信息论标准定位自然时间转移点并确定补丁边界；自适应补丁编码器（APE），使用池化和交叉注意力捕获补丁内依赖关系并生成固定大小的潜在表示。这些嵌入随后由全局变换器处理以建模补丁间动态。

Result: 在长期预测基准测试中，EntroPE在准确性和效率方面均有提升，证明了熵引导的动态补丁构建是时间序列建模的有前景的新范式。

Conclusion: 熵引导的动态补丁构建能够有效保持时间结构，同时保留补丁方法的计算优势，为时间序列建模提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a
scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated,
targeted synthesis, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable
and continuously improving AI systems. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在人类中心场景理解方面的能力很少被探索，主要缺乏考虑人类导向的细粒度感知和高维因果推理能力的综合评估基准。

Method: 构建了包含多样人类场景的基准测试，提供渐进式评估维度，从细粒度感知到高维推理，包含8个维度，并建立了自动化标注流程和人工标注平台。

Result: 在17个最先进的MLLMs上进行的广泛实验有效暴露了模型在人类中心图像理解方面的局限性。

Conclusion: Human-MME基准测试为未来MLLMs研究提供了重要指导，推动模型在人类中心图像理解方面的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了行人姿态变化（腿部状态、肘部状态、身体朝向）和关节遮挡对检测性能的影响，发现在自动驾驶行人检测中存在对平行腿、直肘和侧向视角的偏见，且下肢遮挡比上肢和头部遮挡影响更大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然许多检测模型旨在降低漏检率并处理遮挡和远距离识别等挑战，但公平性仍然是一个未被充分探索但同样重要的问题。本文旨在系统研究行人姿态变化和关节遮挡如何影响检测性能的公平性。

Method: 评估了五个行人专用检测器（F2DNet、MGAN、ALFNet、CSP、Cascade R-CNN）和三个通用模型（YOLOv12变体）在ECP-DP数据集上的表现，使用EOD指标量化公平性，并应用Z检验评估统计显著性和鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现存在对平行腿、直肘和侧向视角行人的偏见，下肢关节遮挡对检测率的负面影响比上肢和头部更大。Cascade R-CNN实现了最低的总体漏检率，并在所有属性中表现出最小的偏见。

Conclusion: 这是首次在自动驾驶行人检测中进行的全面姿态和遮挡感知公平性评估，揭示了现有检测模型在公平性方面的重要偏差，为改进模型公平性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose -- including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation -- as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细胞显微镜领域，多属性分类相比传统的细胞类型分类仍然代表性不足，需要自动化、细粒度的多属性标注方法来提高效率和准确性。

Method: 使用两个互补数据集：PBC数据集（8种细胞类型）和WBCAtt数据集（11种形态属性）。提出双模型架构：CNN用于细胞类型分类，Vision Transformer用于多属性分类。

Result: 在WBCAtt数据集上实现了94.62%的多属性分类准确率，显著提高了模型可解释性，并相对于传统人工标注节省了大量时间和成本。

Conclusion: AttriGen建立了一个新的范式，可以扩展到其他计算机视觉分类任务，通过有效自动化多属性标签的扩展。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with the task of text-driven saliency detection in
360-degrees videos. For this, we introduce the TSV360 dataset which includes
16,000 triplets of ERP frames, textual descriptions of salient objects/events
in these frames, and the associated ground-truth saliency maps. Following, we
extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal
cross-attention mechanism, to discover dependencies between the different data
modalities. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations using the TSV360 dataset,
showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet子集上达到SOTA性能，编解码成本高效

Conclusion: GSDD是一种简单有效、广泛适用且高度可扩展的数据集蒸馏方法

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible
textual explanations for the outcomes of video summarization. For the needs of
this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

TL;DR: 提出了MGCE框架解决广义类别发现(GCD)问题，通过多粒度概念专家自适应挖掘视觉概念，无需预先知道未标注数据中的类别数量，在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GCD方法存在两个主要局限：1) 未能充分利用视觉数据中的多粒度概念信息，限制了表示质量；2) 大多假设训练时已知未标注类别数量，这在现实场景中不实用。

Method: MGCE包含两个模块：动态概念对比学习(DCCL)在概念挖掘和双级表示学习之间交替优化；多粒度专家协作学习(MECL)引入不同粒度的额外专家，使用概念对齐矩阵实现跨专家协作。

Result: 在九个细粒度视觉识别基准上的实验表明，MGCE达到最先进结果，特别是在新类准确率方面。即使没有类别数量先验知识，MGCE也优于需要知道确切类别数量的参数化方法，平均提升3.6%。

Conclusion: MGCE能够自动估计未标注数据中的类别数量，适合实际开放世界场景，为GCD问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

*Adnan Ben Mansour,Ayoub Karine,David Naccache*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Donut-MINT方法，通过机制可解释性驱动的知识蒸馏来压缩视觉文档理解模型，在保持DocVQA性能的同时显著降低推理时间和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型如Donut虽然有效但计算成本过高，难以在实时或资源受限场景中部署，需要开发高效的模型压缩方法。

Method: 利用机制可解释性分析模型内部计算，识别关键子组件，通过知识蒸馏训练紧凑学生模型，实现网络剪枝和架构优化。

Result: 开发的Donut-MINT模型在DocVQA基准测试中保持强性能，同时显著减少了推理时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: 该方法将模型压缩重新定义为电路发现过程，为可解释性研究和实用视觉语言模型部署之间搭建了桥梁。

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LAMs存在两个瓶颈：端到端训练的视觉编码器空间理解能力差；输入帧距离较远时模型脆弱，时间感知有限。这些问题阻碍了稳定清晰的动作建模。

Method: 提出Farsighted-LAM框架，包含几何感知空间编码和多尺度时间建模；进一步构建SSM-VLA端到端框架，集成结构化感知和视觉思维链模块来显式推理环境动态。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界的多个VLA任务中验证，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 结合几何感知建模、时间一致性和显式推理的策略能有效增强具身智能的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action representations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry-aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end-to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates structured
perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly reason about
environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and interpretability. We
validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation and real-world
settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results demonstrate
that our strategy of combining geometry-aware modeling, temporal coherence, and
explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and
generalizability of embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: 提出PRPO强化学习算法，通过段落级推理对齐提升多模态LLM在深度伪造检测中的准确性和可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度伪造检测中数据集稀缺问题，以及多模态大语言模型在检测时推理与视觉证据不匹配、产生幻觉解释的局限性

Method: 构建推理标注数据集，提出段落级相对策略优化(PRPO)强化学习算法，在段落级别对齐LLM推理与图像内容

Result: PRPO大幅提升检测准确率，获得4.55/5.0的最高推理分数，在测试条件下显著优于GRPO

Conclusion: 将多模态推理基于视觉证据是实现可靠、可解释深度伪造检测的关键

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

*Ali Zoljodi,Radu Timofte,Masoud Daneshtalab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CAT框架，通过聚类特定的仿射变换参数来减少低比特后训练量化中的误差，无需微调即可显著提升精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统仿射变换在低比特量化中效果不佳，需要更精细的方法来对齐量化模型与全精度模型的输出。

Method: 基于聚类的仿射变换(CAT)，使用聚类特定参数来精炼低比特量化输出，仅需少量额外参数。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，CAT框架在多种架构和低比特设置下均优于现有PTQ方法，W2A2 ResNet-18达到53.18% Top-1准确率，作为插件可提升基线方法3%以上。

Conclusion: CAT是一种高效的后训练量化误差减少框架，在低比特量化场景下显著提升性能且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

Motivation: 现有技能熟练度估计方法依赖黑盒视频分类器，忽略了多视角上下文且缺乏可解释性。

Method: 使用AttentiveGatedProjector动态融合多视角特征，将冻结的TimeSformer骨干网络特征投影到用于反馈生成的语言模型中。

Result: 在EgoExo4D数据集上训练，ProfVLM超越了最先进方法，参数减少20倍，训练时间减少60%，并在多样化活动中实现更高准确性。

Conclusion: 生成式视觉语言建模为技能评估提供了强大的新方向，能够输出与性能对齐的自然语言评价，提供透明推理。

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like
feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an
AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight
generative vision-language modeling as a powerful new direction for skill
assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point2RBox-v3提出了一种基于点标注的弱监督定向目标检测方法，通过渐进式标签分配和先验引导动态掩码损失，解决了现有方法中伪标签利用率低和质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于点标注的定向目标检测方法存在伪标签利用率低和质量差的问题，需要更高效的弱监督学习方法替代昂贵的人工标注。

Method: 1) 渐进式标签分配(PLA)：在训练过程的不同阶段动态估计实例尺寸，实现标签分配方法的使用。2) 先验引导动态掩码损失(PGDM-Loss)：结合SAM模型和分水岭算法的优势，克服了分水岭在稀疏场景和SAM在密集场景中的性能不足。

Result: 在多个数据集上取得优异性能：DOTA-v1.0(66.09%)、DOTA-v1.5(56.86%)、DOTA-v2.0(41.28%)、DIOR(46.40%)、STAR(19.60%)、RSAR(45.96%)，特别在目标尺寸变化大或稀疏场景下表现突出。

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3是首个使用动态伪标签进行标签分配的模型，创新性地结合了SAM模型和分水岭算法，在稀疏和密集场景中都实现了优异性能。

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

TL;DR: Flower是一个基于预训练流模型的逆问题求解器，通过三步迭代过程实现与观测测量一致的图像重建，在理论分析上近似贝叶斯后验采样，并在多种逆问题上实现了最先进的重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逆问题求解方法在重建质量和理论统一性方面存在局限，需要一种能够结合即插即用方法和生成式逆问题求解器优势的统一框架。

Method: Flower采用三步迭代过程：1) 流一致性目标估计，速度网络预测去噪目标；2) 精炼步骤，将估计目标投影到前向算子定义的可行集；3) 时间推进步骤，将精炼目标沿流轨迹重新投影。

Result: Flower在多种逆问题上实现了最先进的重建质量，且在不同问题上使用几乎相同的超参数，表现出良好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: Flower成功统一了即插即用方法和生成式逆问题求解器的视角，通过理论分析和实验验证了其在逆问题求解中的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视频分解为空间和时间分量，依赖脆弱的显式帧扭曲进行运动补偿，存在局限性。需要一种更统一的表示方法来同时捕捉空间细节和时间动态。

Method: 将视频编码为连续的3D视频傅里叶场，使用神经编码器预测傅里叶系数，包含高斯点扩散函数确保任意尺度的无混叠重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进水平，在广泛的上采样因子范围内提供更清晰、时间更一致的重建结果，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 联合建模方法显著改善了空间和时间超分辨率性能，为视频超分辨率提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE是一个无需训练的两阶段零样本组合图像检索框架，利用多模态大语言模型增强检索性能，通过语义查询增强融合和高效批量重排序来准确捕捉用户意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本组合图像检索方法虽然无需特定任务训练或标注数据，但准确捕捉用户意图仍然具有挑战性。现有方法在理解用户指定的文本修改方面存在不足。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：1）语义查询增强融合阶段，使用MLLM生成目标图像描述来丰富CLIP等视觉语言模型的查询嵌入；2）高效批量重排序阶段，将候选图像以网格形式呈现给MLLM进行联合视觉语义推理。

Result: 在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现出色，即使使用轻量级预训练模型也能保持高性能，证明了其潜在适用性。

Conclusion: SQUARE框架简单有效，通过结合MLLM的语义理解能力显著提升了零样本组合图像检索的性能，能够更好地捕捉用户意图。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

Motivation: 长视频中识别关键时刻对下游理解和推理任务至关重要，但传统方法泛化性有限且难以处理长视频，因此需要新的解决方案。

Method: 提出TimeScope框架，采用渐进推理：首先识别粗粒度时间范围，然后通过细粒度时刻划分来精炼该范围。使用ToTG Pile数据集增强模型的渐进时间定位能力。

Result: 大量实验表明，TimeScope在各种设置下均优于现有的时间定位方法和流行的多模态大语言模型，证明了其解决这一新挑战性问题的有效性。

Conclusion: TimeScope通过渐进推理方法有效解决了ToTG问题，在长视频中基于任务描述定位关键时间区间方面表现出色，为视频理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

TL;DR: ScalingAR是首个专为基于下一个token预测的自回归图像生成设计的测试时缩放框架，无需早期解码或辅助奖励，通过token熵作为新信号，在两个互补级别进行缩放操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法依赖频繁部分解码和外部奖励模型，不适合基于NTP的图像生成，因为中间解码结果不完整。需要专门框架来填补这一空白。

Method: 利用token熵作为视觉token生成的新信号，在配置文件和策略两个级别操作：配置文件级别融合内在和条件信号流式传输校准置信状态；策略级别利用该状态自适应终止低置信轨迹并动态调度指导强度。

Result: 在通用和组合基准测试中，ScalingAR将基础模型在GenEval上提升12.5%，在TIIF-Bench上提升15.2%；有效减少62.0%的视觉token消耗同时超越基线；增强鲁棒性，在挑战性场景中缓解26.0%的性能下降。

Conclusion: ScalingAR成功为基于NTP的自回归图像生成提供了有效的测试时缩放框架，显著提升性能、效率和鲁棒性，填补了该领域的技术空白。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

Motivation: 传统视频异常检测方法依赖特定领域训练数据和人工调整，成本高且泛化能力有限。目标是实现通用的视频异常检测，自动处理各种场景和未知异常类型。

Method: 基于MLLMs构建智能代理PANDA，包含四个关键能力：自适应的场景感知策略规划、目标驱动的启发式推理、工具增强的自我反思、自我改进的记忆链机制。

Result: 在多种场景、开放集和复杂场景设置下，PANDA无需训练和人工参与即达到最先进性能，验证了其泛化性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PANDA展示了在无需训练数据或人工干预的情况下，实现通用视频异常检测的可行性，为智能视频分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

*Chenhui Zhu,Yilu Wu,Shuai Wang,Gangshan Wu,Limin Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MotionRAG是一个检索增强框架，通过从相关参考视频中提取运动先验来提升图像到视频生成的动态真实性，采用上下文感知运动适应技术，在多个领域和基础模型上都取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的图像到视频生成在运动真实性方面仍面临挑战，难以准确建模复杂的物理约束、物体交互和特定领域动态。

Method: 提出检索增强框架MotionRAG，包括：1）基于检索的管道提取高级运动特征；2）通过因果Transformer架构实现上下文学习运动适应；3）基于注意力的运动注入适配器将运动特征集成到预训练视频扩散模型中。

Result: 在多个领域和各种基础模型上均取得显著改进，推理时计算开销可忽略不计。模块化设计支持零样本泛化到新领域，只需更新检索数据库而无需重新训练组件。

Conclusion: 该研究通过有效检索和传递运动先验，增强了视频生成系统的核心能力，促进了真实运动动态的合成。

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

### [201] [Image-Difficulty-Aware Evaluation of Super-Resolution Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26398)
*Atakan Topaloglu,Ahmet Bilican,Cansu Korkmaz,A. Murat Tekalp*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了针对图像超分辨率模型的难度感知性能评估方法，通过高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数来识别测试图像的难度差异，从而更准确地区分在平均分数相近但视觉结果不同的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像超分辨率模型评估主要依赖平均分数，无法反映模型在不同难度图像上的表现差异，也无法捕捉某些模型在困难图像上产生的伪影问题。

Method: 提出两种图像难度度量指标：高频指数和旋转不变边缘指数，用于预测模型在哪些测试图像上会产生显著不同的视觉结果，并设计相应的评估方法将这些视觉差异反映在客观指标上。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的图像难度度量和评估方法能够有效区分视觉结果不同但平均性能相近的模型。

Conclusion: 难度感知评估方法能够更全面地评估图像超分辨率模型的性能，特别是在识别模型在困难图像上的表现差异方面具有优势。

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

*Pengze Xue,Shanwen Wang,Fei Zhou,Yan Cui,Xin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PRISM框架，一个渐进式三阶段图像去雨方法，结合混合注意力UNet和混合域Mamba模型，在多尺度特征聚合和频域建模方面取得改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单尺度去雨模型在细粒度恢复和全局一致性方面存在不足，需要更有效的多尺度特征处理和频域建模方法。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：CENet进行粗提取，SFNet结合HA-UNet和HDMamba进行频域融合，RNet进行细粒度恢复。HA-UNet结合通道注意力和窗口空间变换器，HDMamba联合建模空间语义和小波域特征。

Result: 在多数据集上取得了有竞争力的结果，能够学习高频雨特征同时保持结构细节和全局上下文。

Conclusion: PRISM框架通过渐进式三阶段设计和混合域建模，有效提升了图像去雨的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

*Donghoon Kim,Dongyoung Lee,Ik Joon Chang,Sung-Ho Bae*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出QuaRTZ方法，通过残差截断和零抑制实现扩散模型的4位量化，在保持纹理细节的同时减少计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像，但计算需求高难以部署。4位后训练量化面临挑战，因为更大的步长会放大低幅值激活的舍入误差，导致纹理细节丢失。

Method: QuaRTZ方法结合8位最小-最大量化处理异常值，通过前导零抑制压缩到4位以保留最低有效位，从而保持纹理细节。

Result: 4位QuaRTZ在FLUX.1-schnell上达到FID 6.98，优于需要辅助FP16分支的SVDQuant方法。

Conclusion: QuaRTZ通过平衡异常值保留和最低有效位精度，有效减少了舍入误差并提高了量化效率，在多种激活分布下都具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

TL;DR: AVI平台是一个端到端的多视角感知系统，结合深度学习检测器和语义规则引擎，实现实时变体感知的车辆质量检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代生产线需要确保每辆车都符合正确的变体规格且无可见缺陷，这是一个日益复杂的挑战。

Method: 使用11个同步摄像头捕获车辆360度视图，将任务特定视图路由到专用模块：YOLOv8用于零件检测，EfficientNet用于ICE/EV分类，Gemini-1.5 Flash用于吉祥物OCR，YOLOv8-Seg用于划痕和凹陷分割。通过视图感知融合层标准化证据，VIN条件规则引擎将检测到的特征与预期清单进行比较。

Result: 在混合数据集上，AVI达到93%的验证准确率、86%的缺陷检测召回率，并维持每分钟3.3辆车的检测速度，大幅超越单视图或无分割基线。

Conclusion: 这是首个公开报道的在可部署工业汽车环境中统一多摄像头特征验证与缺陷检测的系统。

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

### [205] [Stylos: Multi-View 3D Stylization with Single-Forward Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26455)
*Hanzhou Liu,Jia Huang,Mi Lu,Srikanth Saripalli,Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos是一个单次前向传播的3D高斯框架，用于3D风格迁移，支持从单张图像到多视角集合的无姿态内容，通过参考风格图像实现几何感知、视角一致的风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有3D风格迁移方法需要逐场景优化或预计算姿态的问题，实现无需优化、无需姿态的零样本3D风格迁移。

Method: 采用Transformer主干网络，包含几何预测路径（保持自注意力以保留几何保真度）和风格注入路径（通过全局交叉注意力实现跨视角视觉一致性），并引入基于体素的3D风格损失来对齐场景特征与风格统计。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Stylos能够实现高质量的零样本风格化，支持从单视角到大规模多视角设置的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Stylos通过全局风格-内容耦合、提出的3D风格损失以及框架的可扩展性，实现了有效的3D风格迁移，无需逐场景优化或预计算姿态。

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

*Artur Barros,Carlos Caetano,João Macedo,Jefersson A. dos Santos,Sandra Avila*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ASGRA框架，通过场景图和图注意力网络进行室内场景分类和敏感内容分析，在Places8数据集上达到81.27%平衡准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内场景分类的挑战，特别是敏感内容分析（如儿童性虐待图像分类），需要处理物体间复杂关系和空间布局。

Method: 将图像转换为场景图，然后使用图注意力网络进行推理，直接建模场景组件间的交互关系。

Result: 在Places8数据集上达到81.27%平衡准确率，优于基于图像的方法；在真实世界CSAI评估中获得74.27%平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 结构化场景表示是室内场景分类和CSAI分类的稳健范式，具有可解释性和隐私保护优势。

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级CBAM-CNN模型用于槟榔叶病害检测，该模型仅含213万参数，通过集成注意力机制提升特征提取能力，在包含10,185张图像的增强数据集上实现了95.58%的准确率。

Method: 构建轻量级CBAM-CNN模型，集成卷积块注意力模块(CBAM)来增强空间和通道特征关注，使用包含健康叶片、叶腐病和叶斑病三个类别的10,185张图像数据集，并采用Grad-CAM进行可视化解释。

Result: 模型在测试集上达到97%精确率、94%召回率、95% F1分数和95.58%准确率，性能优于传统预训练CNN模型。

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级CBAM-CNN模型能有效识别槟榔叶病害，具有高准确性和平衡的分类性能，为农业病害检测提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

*Sattwik Basu,Chaitanya Amballa,Zhongweiyang Xu,Jorge Vančo Sampedro,Srihari Nelakuditi,Romit Roy Choudhury*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出CoGuide方法，通过用户移动轨迹重建空间布局（如房屋平面图），使用扩散模型后验采样器，并在嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数来解决前向算子不可微的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从用户移动轨迹直接反演空间布局是病态问题，因为多个平面图可以解释相同的轨迹。现有生成逆求解器面临前向算子（路径规划过程）不可逆、不可微的挑战，导致优化不稳定。

Method: 采用扩散模型后验采样器，在更平滑的嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数。嵌入空间通过对比损失训练，使兼容的平面图和轨迹靠近，不匹配的远离。

Result: CoGuide模型在广泛实验中，从轨迹生成更一致的平面图，比可微分规划器基线和引导扩散方法更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 在嵌入空间中定义的替代似然分数是真实似然分数的有效近似，能够引导去噪过程趋向后验分布，解决了前向算子不可微带来的优化问题。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

Motivation: 大语言模型计算成本高，无法直接部署在资源受限的边缘环境中，需要开发能在边缘高效运行的高性能小模型。

Method: 采用课程式监督微调(SFT)和离线策略知识蒸馏的后训练流程来增强小模型精度。

Result: 生成的指令调优模型在十亿参数模型中达到最先进性能，在严格硬件约束下表现出强泛化能力，并在各种任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 为在Ascend边缘设备上开发高性能语言模型提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DEPTHOR++框架，通过模拟真实噪声训练、无参数异常检测和深度补全网络，显著提升轻量dToF传感器的深度增强性能，在多个数据集上达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度增强方法假设理想dToF输入和完美RGB对齐，忽略了实际应用中的校准误差和异常，限制了真实世界适用性。

Method: 1.基于合成数据集的模拟方法生成真实训练样本；2.无学习参数异常检测机制识别错误dToF测量；3.针对噪声dToF输入的深度补全网络，集成RGB图像和单目深度估计先验。

Result: 在ZJU-L5数据集上RMSE和Rel分别提升22%和11%；在Mirror3D-NYU数据集上镜面区域性能提升37%；在Hammer数据集上超越L515测量22%。

Conclusion: DEPTHOR++框架显著提升了轻量dToF传感器在真实环境中的深度感知能力，使低成本传感器性能超越高端设备。

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型和基准测试未能捕捉专业视频生成的复杂性和需求，需要建立面向专业电影制作的结构化评估框架。

Method: 构建包含76个控制节点的四个分类体系，开发自动化提示分类和问题生成流程，进行大规模人类研究（10+模型、20K视频、80+电影专业人士标注），训练自动评估器。

Result: 即使是当前最强模型在事件和相机相关控制方面仍存在显著差距，训练的自动评估器性能优于现有零样本基线。

Conclusion: SCINE首次将专业视频生成置于视频生成模型领域，通过以电影控制为中心的分类体系和结构化评估流程指导未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

Result: 在果蝇雄性中枢神经系统重建中，该方法能获得90%的指导性校对价值，同时减少80%的成本；自动合并了20万个分割片段（相当于4年人工工作量），使连接组连接完成率提高1.3个百分点。

Conclusion: 机器学习方法能有效降低连接组学中的人工校对成本，为大规模连接组重建和比较连接组学提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

*Yiyang Wang,Xi Chen,Xiaogang Xu,Yu Liu,Hengshuang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffCamera是一个基于扩散变换器的模型，能够对已拍摄图像进行灵活的重新对焦，通过任意新的焦点位置和模糊级别来调整景深效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决图像拍摄后景深效果固定难以修改的问题，特别是当主体失焦时，需要一种能够灵活调整对焦点和模糊程度的方法。

Method: 使用扩散变换器框架进行重新对焦学习，通过模拟数据生成大规模图像对，并引入堆叠约束来确保物理正确的景深操作。

Result: 实验表明DiffCamera能够在各种场景下稳定地进行重新对焦，为摄影和生成AI应用提供前所未有的景深调整控制。

Conclusion: DiffCamera通过物理约束的扩散变换器框架，成功实现了对已拍摄图像的灵活景深调整，解决了传统摄影中景深固定的限制。

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SAGANet模型，通过视频对象分割感知的音频生成方法，实现精确的用户控制，解决了现有模型在专业Foley工作流中缺乏精确控制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态音频生成模型缺乏精确的用户控制，无法优先处理特定对象或避免不必要的背景声音，限制了在专业Foley工作流中的应用。

Method: 引入视频对象分割感知音频生成任务，开发SAGANet多模态生成模型，利用视觉分割掩码结合视频和文本线索进行可控音频生成。

Result: 相比现有最先进方法有显著改进，为可控、高保真Foley合成设定了新标准。

Conclusion: SAGANet通过对象级分割映射实现了细粒度和视觉定位的音频生成控制，并发布了Segmented Music Solos基准数据集以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hy-Facial是一个混合特征提取框架，结合深度学习和传统图像处理技术，通过UMAP降维实现83.3%的面部表情识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面部表情分类面临高维度和复杂性的挑战，需要融合多种特征提取方法来获得更丰富的图像表示。

Method: 融合VGG19深度特征与SIFT、ORB手工特征，使用K-means聚类和UMAP进行降维处理。

Result: 在FER数据集上达到83.3%的分类准确率，UMAP被证明是最有效的降维方法。

Conclusion: 降维不仅是预处理步骤，更是提升特征质量和分类性能的关键组件。

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA^2是一个端到端的全景深度估计模型，通过数据增强和SphereViT架构解决了全景数据稀缺和球面失真问题，在零样本泛化能力上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全景深度估计中存在的两个主要挑战：全景数据稀缺导致的零样本泛化能力差，以及球面失真带来的效率问题。

Method: 1) 开发数据增强引擎，从透视图像生成高质量全景深度数据，创建约607K全景RGB-深度对；2) 提出SphereViT架构，利用球面坐标强制全景图像特征的球面几何一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的综合基准测试显示，DA^2在AbsRel指标上比最强的零样本基线平均提升38%，甚至优于先前的域内方法，同时作为端到端解决方案具有更高的效率。

Conclusion: DA^2是一个准确、零样本可泛化且完全端到端的全景深度估计器，通过大规模数据增强和球面几何建模实现了优异的性能和效率。

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

### [218] [HART: Human Aligned Reconstruction Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26621)
*Xiyi Chen,Shaofei Wang,Marko Mihajlovic,Taewon Kang,Sergey Prokudin,Ming Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HART是一个用于稀疏视角人体重建的统一框架，能够从少量未标定RGB图像中输出水密着装网格、对齐的SMPL-X人体网格和高斯溅射表示，实现照片级真实感的新视角渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么优化参数化模板（忽略宽松衣物和人物交互），要么在简化相机假设下训练隐函数（限制真实场景应用）。HART旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 预测逐像素3D点图、法线和人体对应关系，采用遮挡感知的泊松重建恢复完整几何，与SMPL-X人体模型对齐，并用人体对齐网格初始化高斯溅射。

Result: 在仅2.3K合成扫描数据上训练，HART在多个数据集上取得SOTA结果：着装网格重建的Chamfer距离提升18-23%，SMPL-X估计的PA-V2V降低6-27%，新视角合成的LPIPS降低15-27%。

Conclusion: 前馈transformer可作为可扩展模型，在真实世界场景中实现鲁棒的人体重建。

Abstract: We introduce HART, a unified framework for sparse-view human reconstruction.
Given a small set of uncalibrated RGB images of a person as input, it outputs a
watertight clothed mesh, the aligned SMPL-X body mesh, and a Gaussian-splat
representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

### [219] [Learning Generalizable Shape Completion with SIM(3) Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26631)
*Yuqing Wang,Zhaiyu Chen,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，通过架构设计使模型对姿态和尺度变化具有不变性，在去偏评估协议下显著优于现有方法，并在跨域场景中创下新记录。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D形状补全方法通常假设扫描数据已预对齐到规范坐标系，这导致网络可能利用姿态和尺度线索来记忆绝对位置而非推断内在几何。当真实数据缺乏这种对齐时，性能会崩溃。

Method: 引入SIM(3)-等变形状补全网络，其模块化层依次规范化特征、在相似性不变几何上推理，并恢复原始坐标系。采用去偏评估协议消除隐藏线索。

Result: 在PCN基准测试中优于等变和增强基线方法；在KITTI真实驾驶数据上最小匹配距离降低17%，在OmniObject3D室内扫描上Chamfer距离降低14%；在更严格的协议下仍优于竞争对手在偏置设置下的表现。

Conclusion: 完整的SIM(3)等变性是实现真正可泛化形状补全的有效途径，建立了对相似变换群的架构等变性作为鲁棒泛化的关键原则。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的视觉惯性SLAM数据集和基准测试，专门针对头戴式设备的自我中心数据，解决了现有基准测试在运动多样性、动态视觉内容和长时间会话方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SLAM研究使用的基准测试无法充分反映头戴式设备面临的挑战，如更广泛的运动多样性、普遍的动态视觉内容、长时间会话中的传感器校准变化等，且缺乏足够精确的地面真实位姿。

Method: 使用眼镜式设备记录城市中心数小时、数公里的轨迹，配备多种传感器。利用测量工具获取控制点作为间接位姿标注，实现厘米级精度的大规模城市尺度评估。

Result: 研究表明，学术界开发的最先进SLAM系统无法应对这些挑战，并识别出了导致这一问题的具体组件。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试为评估SLAM系统在真实世界头戴式设备场景中的性能提供了重要工具，有助于推动SLAM技术的进一步发展。

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Query-Kontext是一种新型的多模态统一模型方法，通过将多模态生成推理能力委托给强大的视觉语言模型(VLM)，同时保留扩散模型的高质量视觉合成能力，实现了在文本到图像生成和编辑任务上的优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型中，多模态生成推理能力（包括指令理解、定位和图像引用）与高保真合成能力内在纠缠。作者认为应该将这两种能力解耦，让VLM专注于生成推理，扩散模型专注于视觉合成。

Method: 提出Query-Kontext方法，通过多模态"kontext"（包含语义线索和粗粒度图像条件）连接VLM和扩散模型。采用三阶段渐进训练策略：1) 将VLM连接到轻量级扩散头；2) 扩展到大型预训练扩散模型；3) 引入低级图像编码器进行指令调优。

Result: 实验表明，该方法与强大的统一基线方法相当，在某些情况下甚至优于特定任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Query-Kontext成功地将多模态生成推理与视觉合成解耦，通过委托VLM处理复杂推理任务，同时利用扩散模型进行高质量视觉生成，在多模态参考到图像场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stitch是一种无需训练的方法，通过自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制集成到多模态扩散变换器中，解决了文本到图像生成中空间关系准确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在捕捉空间关系（如"上方"或"右侧"）方面存在困难，而早期方法由于架构演进已与现代模型不兼容。

Method: 通过自动生成边界框，在指定边界框内生成单个对象，然后无缝拼接它们，利用目标注意力头在生成过程中隔离和裁剪单个对象。

Result: 在PosEval基准测试中，Stitch显著提升了基础模型的性能，将FLUX在GenEval位置任务上的表现提高了218%，在PosEval上提高了206%，并在Qwen-Image上实现了54%的改进。

Conclusion: Stitch无需训练即可在领先模型中集成位置控制，实现了最先进的结果，证明了在基于位置的生成方面仍有显著改进空间。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

Motivation: 现代循环神经网络在3D重建中表现出色，但在超出训练上下文长度时性能显著下降，存在长度泛化限制。

Method: 从测试时训练视角重新审视3D重建基础模型，将其设计为在线学习问题，利用内存状态与观测的对齐置信度推导闭式学习率来平衡历史信息保留与新观测适应。

Result: TTT3R显著改善了长度泛化，全局姿态估计性能比基线提升2倍，以20 FPS运行，仅需6 GB GPU内存处理数千张图像。

Conclusion: TTT3R通过训练无关的干预有效解决了循环神经网络在3D重建中的长度泛化问题，实现了高效的长序列处理。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

Abstract: The evolution of digital communication systems and the designs of online
platforms have inadvertently facilitated the subconscious propagation of toxic
behavior. Giving rise to reactive responses to toxic behavior. Toxicity in
online content and Artificial Intelligence Systems has become a serious
challenge to individual and collective well-being around the world. It is more
detrimental to society than we realize. Toxicity, expressed in language, image,
and video, can be interpreted in various ways depending on the context of
usage. Therefore, a comprehensive taxonomy is crucial to detect and mitigate
toxicity in online content, Artificial Intelligence systems, and/or Large
Language Models in a proactive manner. A comprehensive understanding of
toxicity is likely to facilitate the design of practical solutions for toxicity
detection and mitigation. The classification in published literature has
focused on only a limited number of aspects of this very complex issue, with a
pattern of reactive strategies in response to toxicity. This survey attempts to
generate a comprehensive taxonomy of toxicity from various perspectives. It
presents a holistic approach to explain the toxicity by understanding the
context and environment that society is facing in the Artificial Intelligence
era. This survey summarizes the toxicity-related datasets and research on
toxicity detection and mitigation for Large Language Models, social media
platforms, and other online platforms, detailing their attributes in textual
mode, focused on the English language. Finally, we suggest the research gaps in
toxicity mitigation based on datasets, mitigation strategies, Large Language
Models, adaptability, explainability, and evaluation.

Motivation: 解决AI研究中最大的低效问题：除编码外，现有基准往往无法测试具有经济相关性的能力，需要衡量AI模型在经济价值工作方面的表现。

Method: 通过三个步骤构建：1) 招募顶级领域专家；2) 专家创建反映日常高价值任务的提示；3) 专家制定评估模型响应的评分标准。使用LM评判器评估23个前沿模型。

Abstract: We introduce the first version of the AI Productivity Index (APEX), a
benchmark for assessing whether frontier AI models can perform knowledge work
with high economic value. APEX addresses one of the largest inefficiencies in
AI research: outside of coding, benchmarks often fail to test economically
relevant capabilities. APEX-v1.0 contains 200 test cases and covers four
domains: investment banking, management consulting, law, and primary medical
care. It was built in three steps. First, we sourced experts with top-tier
experience e.g., investment bankers from Goldman Sachs. Second, experts created
prompts that reflect high-value tasks in their day-to-day work. Third, experts
created rubrics for evaluating model responses. We evaluate 23 frontier models
on APEX-v1.0 using an LM judge. GPT 5 (Thinking = High) achieves the highest
mean score (64.2%), followed by Grok 4 (61.3%) and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Thinking =
On) (60.4%). Qwen 3 235B is the best performing open-source model and seventh
best overall. There is a large gap between the performance of even the best
models and human experts, highlighting the need for better measurement of
models' ability to produce economically valuable work.

TL;DR: Auto-ARGUE是一个基于LLM的自动评估框架，专门用于评估检索增强生成(RAG)系统中的长格式报告生成任务，在TREC 2024 NeuCLIR轨道上显示出与人工判断良好的系统级相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前开源评估工具主要针对一般RAG任务，缺乏专门针对报告生成任务的评估工具，因此需要开发专门针对报告生成评估的框架。

Method: 基于ARGUE框架开发了Auto-ARGUE，这是一个基于大语言模型(LLM)的鲁棒实现，专门用于报告生成评估。

Result: 在TREC 2024 NeuCLIR轨道的报告生成试点任务上，Auto-ARGUE显示出与人工判断良好的系统级相关性。

Conclusion: Auto-ARGUE是一个有效的报告生成评估工具，填补了现有评估工具的空白，并发布了用于可视化输出的Web应用。

Abstract: Generation of long-form, citation-backed reports is a primary use case for
retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. While open-source evaluation
tools exist for various RAG tasks, ones tailored to report generation are
lacking. Accordingly, we introduce Auto-ARGUE, a robust LLM-based
implementation of the recent ARGUE framework for report generation evaluation.
We present analysis of Auto-ARGUE on the report generation pilot task from the
TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track, showing good system-level correlations with human
judgments. We further release a web app for visualization of Auto-ARGUE
outputs.

TL;DR: MR^2-Bench是一个推理密集型多模态检索基准，超越了传统的表面语义匹配，专注于评估模型在逻辑、空间和因果推理方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要测试表面语义对应（如对象-文本匹配），无法评估视觉和文本信息之间复杂关系所需的深层推理能力。

Method: 构建包含1,309个精心策划查询的基准，涵盖自然图像、图表和视觉谜题等多样化多模态数据，支持包含多个图像的复杂查询和文档。

Result: 当前最先进模型在MR^2-Bench上表现不佳，例如Seed1.6-Embedding模型在MMEB上Recall@1为77.78，但在MR^2-Bench上仅为9.91。

Conclusion: 该基准揭示了多模态检索中推理能力的显著差距，强调了在推理密集型多模态检索方面进一步发展的迫切需求。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval is becoming a crucial component of modern AI
applications, yet its evaluation lags behind the demands of more realistic and
challenging scenarios. Existing benchmarks primarily probe surface-level
semantic correspondence (e.g., object-text matching) while failing to assess
the deeper reasoning required to capture complex relationships between visual
and textual information. To address this gap, we introduce MR$^2$-Bench, a
reasoning-intensive benchmark for multimodal retrieval. MR$^2$-Bench presents
the following critical values: 1) all tasks are reasoning-driven, going beyond
shallow matching to effectively assess models' capacity for logical, spatial,
and causal inference; 2) it features diverse multimodal data, such as natural
images, diagrams, and visual puzzles, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
content types; 3) it supports complex queries and documents containing multiple
images and covers diverse retrieval scenarios, more accurately reflecting
real-world applications. Our benchmark contains 1,309 curated queries, derived
either from manual collection and annotation or from selective consolidation of
public datasets. Despite achieving strong results on existing benchmarks,
current state-of-the-art models still struggle on MR$^2$-Bench: for example,
the leading Seed1.6-Embedding model attains a Recall@1 of 77.78 on MMEB, but
only 9.91 on MR$^2$-Bench. This substantial performance gap highlights both the
increased challenge posed by our benchmark and the pressing need for further
advances in reasoning-intensive multimodal retrieval. The dataset and
evaluation code will be made publicly available at
https://github.com/VectorSpaceLab/MR2-Bench.

*Yuepeng Hu,Zhengyuan Jiang,Mengyuan Li,Osama Ahmed,Zhicong Huang,Cheng Hong,Neil Gong*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: LLMPrint是一个检测LLM模型来源的框架，通过优化指纹提示利用LLM对提示注入的固有漏洞，构建既独特又对后处理鲁棒的指纹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有溯源检测方法存在局限性：要么需要在发布前嵌入信号（对已发布模型不可行），要么使用手工或随机提示比较输出（对后处理不鲁棒）。

Method: 通过优化指纹提示来强制执行一致的标记偏好，构建模型指纹，并开发适用于灰盒和黑盒场景的统一验证程序。

Result: 在5个基础模型和约700个后训练或量化变体上评估，LLMPrint实现了高真阳性率，同时保持假阳性率接近零。

Conclusion: LLMPrint提供了一种有效的LLM模型溯源检测方法，能够准确识别模型衍生关系，对后处理具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often modified after release through
post-processing such as post-training or quantization, which makes it
challenging to determine whether one model is derived from another. Existing
provenance detection methods have two main limitations: (1) they embed signals
into the base model before release, which is infeasible for already published
models, or (2) they compare outputs across models using hand-crafted or random
prompts, which are not robust to post-processing. In this work, we propose
LLMPrint, a novel detection framework that constructs fingerprints by
exploiting LLMs' inherent vulnerability to prompt injection. Our key insight is
that by optimizing fingerprint prompts to enforce consistent token preferences,
we can obtain fingerprints that are both unique to the base model and robust to
post-processing. We further develop a unified verification procedure that
applies to both gray-box and black-box settings, with statistical guarantees.
We evaluate LLMPrint on five base models and around 700 post-trained or
quantized variants. Our results show that LLMPrint achieves high true positive
rates while keeping false positive rates near zero.

*Jing-Jing Li,Jianfeng He,Chao Shang,Devang Kulshreshtha,Xun Xian,Yi Zhang,Hang Su,Sandesh Swamy,Yanjun Qi*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为STAC的新型多轮攻击框架，通过链式调用看似无害的工具，最终实现有害操作。研究发现当前最先进的LLM代理对此类攻击高度脆弱，攻击成功率超过90%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM发展为具有工具使用能力的自主代理，传统基于内容的安全关注已不足以应对新的安全挑战。需要研究如何防御利用代理工具使用的多轮攻击。

Method: 开发了STAC自动框架，通过闭环管道合成可执行的多步骤工具链，在环境中验证执行，并反向工程隐蔽的多轮提示，可靠诱导代理执行已验证的恶意序列。

Result: 评估了483个STAC案例，涉及1,352组用户-代理-环境交互。结果显示GPT-4.1等最先进LLM代理的STAC攻击成功率超过90%。提出的推理驱动防御提示可将攻击成功率降低28.8%。

Conclusion: 防御工具启用的代理需要在整个动作序列及其累积效应上进行推理，而不是评估孤立的提示或响应。现有基于提示的防御措施保护有限，需要新的防御方法。

Abstract: As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they
introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM
safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC),
a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains
together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined,
collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final
execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and
systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of
user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent
types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM
agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success
rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC's automated
framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool
chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers
stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified
malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find
that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this
gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far
stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a
crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire
action sequences and their cumulative effects, rather than evaluating isolated
prompts or responses.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SeedPrints：一种基于随机初始化偏见的LLM指纹识别方法，利用训练前就存在的种子依赖标识符进行模型溯源


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM指纹识别方法依赖训练动态、数据暴露或超参数等训练后特征，这些特性只在训练开始后才出现，存在局限性

Method: 利用未训练模型在初始化时表现出的可复现token选择偏见，这些偏见在整个训练过程中保持稳定，通过统计检测方法恢复模型谱系

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen风格模型上实现种子级区分度，提供从诞生到生命周期的身份验证，类似于生物指纹

Conclusion: 初始化过程本身就在神经语言模型中留下了独特且持久的身份印记，形成了真正的"Galtonian"指纹

Abstract: Fingerprinting Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for provenance
verification and model attribution. Existing methods typically extract post-hoc
signatures based on training dynamics, data exposure, or hyperparameters --
properties that only emerge after training begins. In contrast, we propose a
stronger and more intrinsic notion of LLM fingerprinting: SeedPrints, a method
that leverages random initialization biases as persistent, seed-dependent
identifiers present even before training. We show that untrained models exhibit
reproducible token selection biases conditioned solely on their parameters at
initialization. These biases are stable and measurable throughout training,
enabling our statistical detection method to recover a model's lineage with
high confidence. Unlike prior techniques, unreliable before convergence and
vulnerable to distribution shifts, SeedPrints remains effective across all
training stages and robust under domain shifts or parameter modifications.
Experiments on LLaMA-style and Qwen-style models show that SeedPrints achieves
seed-level distinguishability and can provide birth-to-lifecycle identity
verification akin to a biometric fingerprint. Evaluations on large-scale
pretrained models and fingerprinting benchmarks further confirm its
effectiveness under practical deployment scenarios. These results suggest that
initialization itself imprints a unique and persistent identity on neural
language models, forming a true ''Galtonian'' fingerprint.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 提出一种基于可微分运动轨迹(DMT)的端到端矢量草图动画自动生成方法，通过多项式轨迹描述笔画控制点的帧间运动，解决闪烁问题并提升时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频草图动画生成面临时间一致性挑战，现有方法存在闪烁问题，需要开发能够保持语义一致性和时间连贯性的生成方法。

Method: 引入可微分运动轨迹(DMT)表示，使用基于伯恩斯坦基的多项式轨迹描述笔画控制点运动；采用稀疏跟踪点进行显式空间建模，支持长视频处理。

Result: 在DAVIS和LVOS数据集上评估显示优于现有SOTA方法；在3D模型和文本到视频数据的跨域验证中表现出鲁棒性和兼容性。

Conclusion: DMT方法通过全局语义梯度传播和稳定优化，有效解决了草图动画生成中的闪烁问题，实现了高质量、高帧率的矢量草图动画生成。

Abstract: Sketching is a direct and inexpensive means of visual expression. Though
image-based sketching has been well studied, video-based sketch animation
generation is still very challenging due to the temporal coherence requirement.
In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end automatic generation approach for
vector sketch animation. To solve the flickering issue, we introduce a
Differentiable Motion Trajectory (DMT) representation that describes the
frame-wise movement of stroke control points using differentiable
polynomial-based trajectories. DMT enables global semantic gradient propagation
across multiple frames, significantly improving the semantic consistency and
temporal coherence, and producing high-framerate output. DMT employs a
Bernstein basis to balance the sensitivity of polynomial parameters, thus
achieving more stable optimization. Instead of implicit fields, we introduce
sparse track points for explicit spatial modeling, which improves efficiency
and supports long-duration video processing. Evaluations on DAVIS and LVOS
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over SOTA methods.
Cross-domain validation on 3D models and text-to-video data confirms the
robustness and compatibility of our approach.

TL;DR: GaussEdit是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的自适应3D场景编辑框架，通过文本和图像提示指导编辑过程，采用三阶段优化策略实现高质量编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统3D场景编辑方法在编辑精度、视觉保真度和处理速度方面的不足，需要开发一个能够平衡全局场景一致性和局部细节编辑的框架。

Method: 使用3D高斯泼溅作为场景表示，采用三阶段流程：1) 3D高斯初始化；2) 自适应全局-局部优化策略和类别引导正则化；3) 基于图像到图像合成技术的纹理增强。

Result: 实验结果表明，GaussEdit在编辑精度、视觉保真度和处理速度方面均优于现有方法，成功将用户指定概念嵌入到3D场景中。

Conclusion: GaussEdit是一个强大的用户驱动3D场景编辑工具，相比传统方法有显著改进，能够实现详细且视觉逼真的3D场景编辑。

Abstract: This paper presents GaussEdit, a framework for adaptive 3D scene editing
guided by text and image prompts. GaussEdit leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting as
its backbone for scene representation, enabling convenient Region of Interest
selection and efficient editing through a three-stage process. The first stage
involves initializing the 3D Gaussians to ensure high-quality edits. The second
stage employs an Adaptive Global-Local Optimization strategy to balance global
scene coherence and detailed local edits and a category-guided regularization
technique to alleviate the Janus problem. The final stage enhances the texture
of the edited objects using a sophisticated image-to-image synthesis technique,
ensuring that the results are visually realistic and align closely with the
given prompts. Our experimental results demonstrate that GaussEdit surpasses
existing methods in editing accuracy, visual fidelity, and processing speed. By
successfully embedding user-specified concepts into 3D scenes, GaussEdit is a
powerful tool for detailed and user-driven 3D scene editing, offering
significant improvements over traditional methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语音驱动的3D面部动画方法在创建个性化动画时面临控制精度不足、编辑复杂且耗时的问题，现有方法无法编辑/重新生成部分输入动画，且忽视了同一音频输入可能对应多种合理的唇部和头部运动。

Method: 提出全卷积扩散模型，利用训练语料库中的音素级多样性；采用说话风格个性化和稀疏引导运动扩散技术，实现精确控制和编辑。

Result: 通过定量和定性评估，证明该方法能够基于单一音频输入生成和编辑多样化的整体3D面部动画，并在高保真度和多样性之间实现控制。

Conclusion: 3DiFACE解决了现有方法的局限性，提供了更灵活、可控的3D面部动画生成和编辑能力。

Abstract: Creating personalized 3D animations with precise control and realistic head
motions remains challenging for current speech-driven 3D facial animation
methods. Editing these animations is especially complex and time consuming,
requires precise control and typically handled by highly skilled animators.
Most existing works focus on controlling style or emotion of the synthesized
animation and cannot edit/regenerate parts of an input animation. They also
overlook the fact that multiple plausible lip and head movements can match the
same audio input. To address these challenges, we present 3DiFACE, a novel
method for holistic speech-driven 3D facial animation. Our approach produces
diverse plausible lip and head motions for a single audio input and allows for
editing via keyframing and interpolation. Specifically, we propose a
fully-convolutional diffusion model that can leverage the viseme-level
diversity in our training corpus. Additionally, we employ a speaking-style
personalization and a novel sparsely-guided motion diffusion to enable precise
control and editing. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we
demonstrate that our method is capable of generating and editing diverse
holistic 3D facial animations given a single audio input, with control between
high fidelity and diversity. Code and models are available here:

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 提出Lexical Tone-Aware Lip-to-Speech (LTA-L2S)方法，通过跨语言迁移学习和流匹配模型解决普通话唇语转语音中的音素映射复杂性和声调建模难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 普通话唇语转语音面临两个主要挑战：复杂的视素到音素映射，以及声调在可理解性中的关键作用。现有方法难以有效处理这些问题。

Method: 1. 采用跨语言迁移学习策略，将英语预训练的音频-视觉自监督学习模型适配到普通话领域；2. 使用流匹配模型生成F0轮廓，通过ASR微调的SSL语音单元引导；3. 采用两阶段训练范式，用流匹配后处理网络精炼粗粒度频谱图。

Result: 大量实验表明，LTA-L2S在语音可理解性和声调准确性方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过跨语言迁移和声调感知建模，有效解决了普通话唇语转语音的挑战，避免了从头训练的高成本，提升了合成语音质量。

Abstract: Lip-to-speech (L2S) synthesis for Mandarin is a significant challenge,
hindered by complex viseme-to-phoneme mappings and the critical role of lexical
tones in intelligibility. To address this issue, we propose Lexical Tone-Aware
Lip-to-Speech (LTA-L2S). To tackle viseme-to-phoneme complexity, our model
adapts an English pre-trained audio-visual self-supervised learning (SSL) model
via a cross-lingual transfer learning strategy. This strategy not only
transfers universal knowledge learned from extensive English data to the
Mandarin domain but also circumvents the prohibitive cost of training such a
model from scratch. To specifically model lexical tones and enhance
intelligibility, we further employ a flow-matching model to generate the F0
contour. This generation process is guided by ASR-fine-tuned SSL speech units,
which contain crucial suprasegmental information. The overall speech quality is
then elevated through a two-stage training paradigm, where a flow-matching
postnet refines the coarse spectrogram from the first stage. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LTA-L2S significantly outperforms existing methods
in both speech intelligibility and tonal accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代数据密集型应用需要手动集成actor持久化、流处理和安全性等独立系统，导致架构复杂。ActorDB旨在通过提供开箱即用的这些能力，提供更健壮、安全和开发者友好的平台。

Method: 采用单写入者actor模型处理写入操作，结合增量视图维护技术，并将零信任安全模型作为核心组件集成到数据库架构中。

Result: 提出了核心架构设计，讨论了关键权衡，并定义了MVP的性能标准来验证该方法。

Conclusion: 通过统一这些复杂概念，ActorDB能够为开发者提供更简单、更安全的解决方案，减少系统集成的复杂性。

Abstract: This paper presents ActorDB ( Dekigoto ) , a novel database architecture that
tightly integrates a single-writer actor model for writes, Incremental View
Maintenance (IVM), and a zero-trust security model as a core component. The
primary contribution of this work is the unification of these powerful but
complex concepts into a single, cohesive system designed to reduce
architectural complexity for developers of modern, data-intensive applications.
We argue that by providing these capabilities out-of-the-box, ActorDB can offer
a more robust, secure, and developer-friendly platform compared to solutions
that require manual integration of separate systems for actor persistence,
stream processing, and security. We present the core architecture, discuss the
critical trade-offs in its design, and define the performance criteria for a
Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to validate our approach.

TL;DR: TAU（台湾音频理解）是一个评估音频-语言模型对本地化、非语义音频理解能力的基准测试，聚焦于台湾特有的日常声音标记，揭示现有模型在文化特定声音识别方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型音频-语言模型的评估主要关注语音或全球通用声音，忽视了文化特异性声音线索。这引发了一个关键问题：现有模型能否泛化到本地化、非语义的音频，这些音频社区成员能立即识别但外部人员无法理解。

Method: 通过结合精选来源、人工编辑和LLM辅助问题生成的流程构建TAU基准，包含702个音频片段和1,794个多项选择题项，这些题目无法仅通过文字转录解决。

Result: 实验表明，包括Gemini 2.5和Qwen2-Audio在内的最先进音频-语言模型表现远低于本地人类水平。

Conclusion: TAU证明了需要本地化基准测试来揭示文化盲点，指导更公平的多模态评估，并确保模型能够服务于全球主流之外的社区。

Abstract: Large audio-language models are advancing rapidly, yet most evaluations
emphasize speech or globally sourced sounds, overlooking culturally distinctive
cues. This gap raises a critical question: can current models generalize to
localized, non-semantic audio that communities instantly recognize but
outsiders do not? To address this, we present TAU (Taiwan Audio Understanding),
a benchmark of everyday Taiwanese "soundmarks." TAU is built through a pipeline
combining curated sources, human editing, and LLM-assisted question generation,
producing 702 clips and 1,794 multiple-choice items that cannot be solved by
transcripts alone. Experiments show that state-of-the-art LALMs, including
Gemini 2.5 and Qwen2-Audio, perform far below local humans. TAU demonstrates
the need for localized benchmarks to reveal cultural blind spots, guide more
equitable multimodal evaluation, and ensure models serve communities beyond the
global mainstream.

Motivation: 现有的对话式语音语言模型在时间动态能力方面存在关键但未被评估的挑战，这影响了对话的流畅性。

Method: 设计了Game-Time基准测试，包含基础指令跟随任务和具有时间约束的高级任务（如节奏遵守和同步响应），受人类通过语言活动学习语言的启发。

Result: 评估发现：最先进模型能较好处理基础任务，但许多当代系统在基础指令跟随方面仍有困难；几乎所有模型在时间约束下性能大幅下降，暴露了时间意识和全双工交互方面的持续弱点。

Conclusion: Game-Time基准为引导未来研究开发更具时间意识的对话AI提供了基础。

Abstract: Conversational Spoken Language Models (SLMs) are emerging as a promising
paradigm for real-time speech interaction. However, their capacity of temporal
dynamics, including the ability to manage timing, tempo and simultaneous
speaking, remains a critical and unevaluated challenge for conversational
fluency. To address this gap, we introduce the Game-Time Benchmark, a framework
to systematically assess these temporal capabilities. Inspired by how humans
learn a language through language activities, Game-Time consists of basic
instruction-following tasks and advanced tasks with temporal constraints, such
as tempo adherence and synchronized responses. Our evaluation of diverse SLM
architectures reveals a clear performance disparity: while state-of-the-art
models handle basic tasks well, many contemporary systems still struggle with
fundamental instruction-following. More critically, nearly all models degrade
substantially under temporal constraints, exposing persistent weaknesses in
time awareness and full-duplex interaction. The Game-Time Benchmark provides a
foundation for guiding future research toward more temporally-aware
conversational AI. Demos and datasets are available on our project website

*Jian Guo Pan,Lin Wang,Xia Cai*

Main category: cond-mat.mtrl-sci

TL;DR: 开发了基于深度学习的自动化SEM图像分割框架PerovSegNet，用于精确识别钙钛矿太阳能电池薄膜中的碘化铅、钙钛矿和缺陷区域，相比基准模型性能提升4.08%，同时减少模型大小和计算负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SEM图像分析主要依赖人工，限制了通量和一致性。准确识别和量化碘化铅和钙钛矿相至关重要，因为这些残留物强烈影响结晶路径和缺陷形成，而钙钛矿晶粒形态决定载流子传输和器件稳定性。

Method: 基于改进的YOLOv8x架构，PerovSegNet包含两个新模块：自适应混洗扩张卷积块（增强多尺度和细粒度特征提取）和可分离自适应下采样模块（同时保留精细纹理和大尺度结构）。在10,994张增强SEM图像数据集上训练。

Result: PerovSegNet达到87.25%的平均精度，计算量为265.4 GFLOPs，比基准YOLOv8x-seg性能提升4.08%，同时模型大小和计算负载分别减少24.43%和25.22%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅实现分割，还提供晶粒级定量指标，可作为结晶效率和微观结构质量的可靠指标，为钙钛矿薄膜制造的实时过程监控和数据驱动优化建立了可扩展工具。

Abstract: Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is indispensable for characterizing the
microstructure of thin films during perovskite solar cell fabrication. Accurate
identification and quantification of lead iodide and perovskite phases are
critical because residual lead iodide strongly influences crystallization
pathways and defect formation, while the morphology of perovskite grains
governs carrier transport and device stability. Yet current SEM image analysis
is still largely manual, limiting throughput and consistency. Here, we present
an automated deep learning-based framework for SEM image segmentation that
enables precise and efficient identification of lead iodide, perovskite and
defect domains across diverse morphologies. Built upon an improved YOLOv8x
architecture, our model named PerovSegNet incorporates two novel modules: (i)
Adaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block, which enhances multi-scale and
fine-grained feature extraction through group convolutions and channel mixing;
and (ii) Separable Adaptive Downsampling module, which jointly preserves
fine-scale textures and large-scale structures for more robust boundary
recognition. Trained on an augmented dataset of 10,994 SEM images, PerovSegNet

### [239] [Spectral Logit Sculpting: Adaptive Low-Rank Logit Transformation for Controlled Text Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25204)
*Jin Li,Zhebo Wang,Tianliang Lu,Mohan Li,Wenpeng Xing,Meng Han*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级推理时优化方法SLS，通过谱分析和熵特性动态调整token分布，无需更新模型参数即可提升LLM可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于熵的推理方法存在计算开销大、未能有效利用历史token上下文的问题，需要更高效的优化方案。

Method: SLS方法维护top-K logits滑动缓冲区，进行实时SVD识别主导谱方向，基于熵和logit间隙统计自适应重新缩放logits，仅在不确定性高时激活。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，SLS在数学、编程和科学推理任务上持续优于现有基线方法，获得更优的准确率。

Conclusion: SLS是一种有效的轻量级推理时优化方法，能够在不更新模型参数的情况下提升LLM性能，同时保持上下文一致性。

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HAMMER是一种新颖的课程强化学习方法，通过引入多样性指标和最小语义哈密顿路径来排序训练样本，增强模型探索能力，在多个推理基准上平均提升3-4%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于难度的课程强化学习方法存在局部优化问题，早期持续训练简单样本会导致策略失去探索能力。

Method: 将数据集评估中常用的多样性指标转移到动态强化学习过程中，通过最小语义哈密顿路径对训练样本进行排序，使初始训练保留更多探索性。

Result: 从泛化界限的理论角度看，多样性驱动的排序有助于稳定收敛。经验评估表明HAMMER能激发模型"好奇心"，在多个推理基准上平均获得3%到4%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: HAMMER通过多样性驱动的样本排序方法有效解决了课程强化学习中的局部优化问题，显著提升了LLM在推理任务上的性能。

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

*Jiexi Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPN是一个轻量级强化学习框架，通过自适应策略选择来优化LLM的效率和准确性权衡，相比Self-Consistency可减少61.5%的token成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有静态提示策略（如Zero-Shot、Few-Shot、CoT）存在固定的效率-准确性权衡问题，准确策略如Self-Consistency在简单任务上浪费计算资源，而轻量方法在复杂输入上表现不佳。

Method: 将自适应策略选择形式化为单步马尔可夫决策过程，使用PPO训练Prompt Policy Network，通过资源显式奖励函数学习仅在必要时分配高成本推理策略。

Result: 在算术推理基准测试中，PPN在效率-准确性帕累托前沿上表现优异，相比Self-Consistency减少61.5%的token成本，同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: PPN为成本高效的LLM部署提供了系统化自适应框架，推进了轻量级优化技术设计，支持可扩展和可持续的语言模型应用。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了训练重评估曲线（TREC）的概念，用于分析训练数据在模型训练过程中的保留效果，并发现将高质量数据放置在TREC低谷可以显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据课程在LLM训练中很重要，但如何最优安排数据顺序的原则尚不明确，需要一种方法来评估不同训练阶段数据的重要性。

Method: 引入TREC诊断方法，使用最终模型权重回顾性评估训练批次，分析AdamW的隐式EMA系数来预测TREC，从而指导数据课程设计。

Result: 通过分析111M到3.9B参数模型，发现将高质量数据放在TREC低谷能显著提升性能；成功预测了已发布训练方案中的TREC，并改进了3.9B参数模型的持续预训练。

Conclusion: TREC为数据课程设计提供了理论基础，能够预测和优化数据放置策略，显著提升LLM训练效果。

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

*Hao Ban,Kaiyi Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出ALoRA和Fed-ALoRA方法，通过共享B矩阵来改进多LoRA适配，在多任务和联邦学习场景中实现更平衡的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现多LoRA扩展中内部A矩阵的相似性主要源于相同的初始化而非共享知识，而B矩阵在知识编码和传输中起更关键作用。

Method: 提出ALoRA（多A矩阵+单共享B）用于多任务微调，以及Fed-ALoRA（跨客户端共享B）用于联邦学习，采用新颖的矩阵分解策略处理异构rank。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理、多任务NLP和联邦NLP数据集上的实验表明，相比现有方法，新方法在保持相当或更优平均准确率的同时，实现了更平衡的任务性能。

Conclusion: ALoRA和Fed-ALoRA通过共享B矩阵的设计，在多任务和联邦学习场景中有效提升了性能平衡性和知识传输效率。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种使用视觉语言模型生成伪标签来训练时间序列问答模型的方法，即使VLMs可能产生错误标签，深度神经网络对噪声标签的鲁棒性仍能有效训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列问答任务面临标注数据稀缺的挑战，而视觉语言模型在零样本分析时间序列信号方面显示出潜力。

Method: 利用VLM生成伪标签，基于深度神经网络对噪声标签的鲁棒性来训练TSQA模型。

Result: 实验表明TSQA模型不仅能成功用伪标签训练，还能通过利用大量未标注数据超越VLM本身的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了TSQA任务中标注数据不足的问题，展示了伪标签训练策略的可行性。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为MuPlon的多路径因果优化框架，用于解决声明验证任务中的数据噪声和数据偏差问题。该框架通过后门路径和前门路径的双重因果干预策略，优化节点概率权重、增强相关证据节点连接，并利用反事实推理消除数据偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声明验证方法往往忽视证据间的复杂交互，导致验证结果不可靠。完全连接图方法面临数据噪声和数据偏差两大混淆挑战。

Method: MuPlon框架包含后门路径和前门路径：后门路径通过优化节点概率权重来稀释噪声节点干扰，同时增强相关证据节点连接；前门路径提取高相关性子图并构建推理路径，应用反事实推理消除数据偏差。

Result: 实验结果表明，MuPlon优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MuPlon通过双重因果干预策略有效解决了声明验证中的数据噪声和偏差问题，为数据质量控制提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型普及，其安全漏洞引起关注。机器遗忘旨在消除不良数据影响，但现有方法依赖保留数据集且面临连续遗忘请求下的累积灾难性效用损失。

Method: 使用旋转显著性权重量化控制遗忘程度；设计斜对称损失构建认知旋转空间；采用正交旋转轴正则化确保连续遗忘请求的旋转方向相互垂直，减少干扰。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，无需保留数据集即可达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RCU方法有效解决了机器遗忘中的关键挑战，在连续遗忘场景下表现出色。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RA3算法，通过中期训练识别紧凑的动作子空间，提升大语言模型在强化学习中的表现，在代码生成任务中显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在强化学习中表现优异，但要充分发挥潜力需要中期训练阶段来识别有用的动作集合并实现快速选择。

Method: 提出RA3算法，通过推导序列变分下界，迭代发现时间一致的潜在结构，然后在自举数据上进行微调。

Result: 在代码生成任务中，RA3在HumanEval和MBPP上的平均性能分别比基础模型和下一个token预测基线提高了8和4个百分点，在多个基准测试中实现了更快的收敛和更高的渐近性能。

Conclusion: 中期训练在决策空间紧凑且有效时间跨度较短时最为有效，强调了在动作抽象空间而非原始动作空间中进行操作的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM自我改进方法中，均匀分配探索预算导致简单任务持续成功、困难任务持续失败，两者在GRPO训练中都产生零梯度，影响学习效率。

Method: 将每个任务的探索视为具有不同"价值"和"成本"的"物品"，建立与经典背包问题的联系，推导出基于模型当前学习状态的自适应资源分配规则。

Result: 在GRPO训练中，非零策略梯度的有效比例提高20-40%，可为特别挑战性问题分配更大预算（如93次rollout），在数学推理基准上平均提升2-4分，峰值提升9分。

Conclusion: 该方法作为计算"免费午餐"，能够智能分配探索预算，在保持相同性能的情况下节省约2倍计算资源，显著提升LLM自我改进的效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

<details>

Motivation: 稀疏感知训练能有效减少大语言模型的推理延迟和内存消耗，但现有方法通常分别优化稀疏模式和权重，缺乏联合优化的连续性框架。

Method: CAST包含三个核心组件：AdamS优化器（自适应L1衰减促进均匀稀疏化）、权重缩放模块（缓解衰减导致的幅度减少）、知识蒸馏（使用稠密模型作为自教师提升效率）。

Result: 在125M到13B参数的多个模型上，CAST在2:4稀疏模式下显著优于现有方法，LLaMA2-7B稀疏模型仅用2%预训练token就达到0.09困惑度增加和0.36%零样本准确率提升。

Conclusion: CAST提供了一种高效、连续的稀疏训练框架，建立了稀疏模型性能的缩放定律，并在量化和微调场景中验证了实用性。

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

Conclusion: TEA框架通过权重平均和自适应系数优化，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了时域泛化性能。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

TL;DR: TFPI通过ThinkFree操作减少RLVR训练中的上下文长度，提高性能并降低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR方法需要极长的上下文长度，导致计算成本高昂，而多阶段训练容易造成性能不可逆下降

Method: 提出TFPI方法，通过ThinkFree操作（直接添加</think>标记）丢弃思考内容，减少推理时的token使用

Result: TFPI加速RL收敛，达到更高性能上限，生成更token高效推理模型，4B模型在AIME24达到89.0%准确率

Conclusion: TFPI是简单有效的RLVR改进方法，无需专门奖励或复杂训练设计即可显著提升性能

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

Motivation: 基于黎曼优化原理，将双曲随机梯度下降扩展到双曲Adam优化器，旨在在双曲流形（特别是庞加莱球）上进行高效学习，并可能在其他非欧几里得设置中带来益处。

Method: 扩展了双曲随机梯度下降方法，开发了双曲Adam优化器，并在扩散模型中应用双曲优化方法，结合朗之万动力学的双曲时间离散化。

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法能够加速训练早期的收敛过程，特别是在参数远离最优解时，为在双曲流形和其他非欧几里得空间中的学习提供了有效的优化工具。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

Motivation: CNN超参数优化通常需要大量试错或网格搜索，计算成本高昂，需要更系统化的优化方法。

Method: 使用田口实验设计方法，采用L12(211)正交阵列评估8个超参数，开发5种多目标优化方法，结合信噪比分析和新型对数缩放技术。

Conclusion: 田口方法能有效优化CNN超参数，学习率、图像尺寸和激活函数是最重要参数，为超参数优化提供了系统化指导。

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效捕捉多模态之间的协同信息，而协同信息正是多模态表示的核心价值所在。

Method: InfMasking采用对比协同信息提取方法，在融合过程中随机遮蔽大部分模态特征，仅保留部分信息来创建具有不同协同模式的表示，并通过互信息最大化进行对齐。

Result: 在控制实验中证明InfMasking能有效增强模态间协同信息，在大规模真实数据集上七个基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: InfMasking通过无限掩码策略成功解决了多模态协同信息提取的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出AC-RL方法，通过交互训练视觉模型生成更全面的图像描述，以支持数学推理系统，在七个视觉数学推理基准上平均准确率提升4.4个百分点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型生成的图像描述通常省略推理系统所需的关键细节，导致推理失败不是由于推理能力限制，而是缺乏必要的视觉信息。

Method: 采用自适应澄清强化学习(AC-RL)，通过训练过程中的澄清请求揭示信息差距，惩罚需要澄清的成功案例，从而促使模型生成更全面的初始描述。

Result: 在七个视觉数学推理基准上，AC-RL相比预训练基线平均准确率提升4.4个百分点，分析显示如果允许澄清请求可减少高达39%的澄清需求。

Conclusion: AC-RL证明仅通过交互学习就能有效优化视觉语言接口，无需显式标注，澄清请求可作为隐式监督信号。

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

Conclusion: AttnRL框架通过高效的探索策略显著提升了过程监督强化学习在推理任务中的效果和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed

a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA
methods by around 5% in accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at

Conclusion: UOT-RFM为无标签长尾分布生成提供了有效框架，通过几何结构量化多数程度，改善了尾部类别生成质量。

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

Motivation: 探索LLMs在纯文本训练中如何发展视觉能力，理解视觉先验的组成和来源，为构建下一代多模态LLMs提供理论基础。

Method: 通过100多个受控实验（消耗50万GPU小时），涵盖从LLM预训练到视觉对齐的完整MLLM构建流程，分析不同数据类别、模型规模和适应设置的影响。

Result: 发现视觉先验由可分离的感知和推理先验组成，推理能力主要来自推理中心数据并具有渐进缩放性，感知能力则更依赖视觉编码器和视觉指令调优数据。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一种从语言预训练中有意培养视觉先验的新方法，为下一代多模态LLMs的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

TL;DR: 本文研究了位置盲ptychography这一新颖的盲逆问题，即在完全不知道扫描位置的情况下进行ptychographic相位恢复，需要同时恢复图像和扫描位置。该问题源于单粒子衍射X射线成像，使用变分推理和基于分数的扩散模型作为数据驱动的图像先验，在模拟的简化2D场景中验证了可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究的动机来自于单粒子衍射X射线成像，其中随机方向的粒子被照射并收集一组衍射图案。如果使用高度聚焦的X射线束，测量结果也会对每个粒子的光束位置敏感，从而变成ptychographic问题，但这些位置也是未知的。

Method: 使用变分推理方法，结合现代数据驱动的图像先验（基于分数的扩散模型），在模拟的简化2D变体中研究这一困难问题的图像重建可行性。

Result: 研究发现，在正确的照明结构和强先验条件下，即使在测量噪声存在的情况下，也能实现可靠且成功的图像重建，除了在最困难的成像场景外，其他所有评估场景都能成功。

Conclusion: 位置盲ptychography问题在适当的照明结构和强图像先验下是可行的，能够实现可靠的图像重建，这为单粒子衍射X射线成像等应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: In this work, we present and investigate the novel blind inverse problem of
position-blind ptychography, i.e., ptychographic phase retrieval without any
knowledge of scan positions, which then must be recovered jointly with the
image. The motivation for this problem comes from single-particle diffractive
X-ray imaging, where particles in random orientations are illuminated and a set
of diffraction patterns is collected. If one uses a highly focused X-ray beam,
the measurements would also become sensitive to the beam positions relative to
each particle and therefore ptychographic, but these positions are also
unknown. We investigate the viability of image reconstruction in a simulated,
simplified 2-D variant of this difficult problem, using variational inference
with modern data-driven image priors in the form of score-based diffusion
models. We find that, with the right illumination structure and a strong prior,
one can achieve reliable and successful image reconstructions even under
measurement noise, in all except the most difficult evaluated imaging scenario.

Result: 在合成数据集和临床数据集上验证，在合成基准测试中达到最先进精度并保持拓扑结构，在临床数据集上也表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 通过整合PDE动力学、拓扑感知正则化和可微分求解器，为数字孪生建立了一个从解剖结构到解剖结构生成的原理性路径，具有视觉真实性、解剖排他性和拓扑一致性。

Abstract: Accurately modeling the spatiotemporal evolution of tumor morphology from
baseline imaging is a pre-requisite for developing digital twin frameworks that
can simulate disease progression and treatment response. Most existing
approaches primarily characterize tumor growth while neglecting the concomitant
alterations in adjacent anatomical structures. In reality, tumor evolution is
highly non-linear and heterogeneous, shaped not only by therapeutic
interventions but also by its spatial context and interaction with neighboring
tissues. Therefore, it is critical to model tumor progression in conjunction
with surrounding anatomy to obtain a comprehensive and clinically relevant
understanding of disease dynamics. We introduce a mathematically grounded
framework that unites mechanistic partial differential equations with
differentiable deep learning. Anatomy is represented as a multi-class
probability field on the simplex and evolved by a cross-diffusion
reaction-diffusion system that enforces inter-class competition and
exclusivity. A differentiable implicit-explicit scheme treats stiff diffusion
implicitly while handling nonlinear reaction and event terms explicitly,
followed by projection back to the simplex. To further enhance global
plausibility, we introduce a topology regularizer that simultaneously enforces
centerline preservation and penalizes region overlaps. The approach is
validated on synthetic datasets and a clinical dataset. On synthetic
benchmarks, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving
topology, and also demonstrates superior performance on the clinical dataset.
By integrating PDE dynamics, topology-aware regularization, and differentiable
solvers, this work establishes a principled path toward anatomy-to-anatomy
generation for digital twins that are visually realistic, anatomically
exclusive, and topologically consistent.

Abstract: Liver fibrosis represents the accumulation of excessive extracellular matrix
caused by sustained hepatic injury. It disrupts normal lobular architecture and
function, increasing the chances of cirrhosis and liver failure. Precise
staging of fibrosis for early diagnosis and intervention is often invasive,
which carries risks and complications. To address this challenge, recent
advances in artificial intelligence-based liver segmentation and fibrosis
staging offer a non-invasive alternative. As a result, the CARE 2025 Challenge
aimed for automated methods to quantify and analyse liver fibrosis in
real-world scenarios, using multi-centre, multi-modal, and multi-phase MRI
data. This challenge included tasks of precise liver segmentation (LiSeg) and
fibrosis staging (LiFS). In this study, we developed an automated pipeline for
both tasks across all the provided MRI modalities. This pipeline integrates
pseudo-labelling based on multi-modal co-registration, liver segmentation using
deep neural networks, and liver fibrosis staging based on shape, textural,
appearance, and directional (STAD) features derived from segmentation masks and
MRI images. By solely using the released data with limited annotations, our
proposed pipeline demonstrated excellent generalisability for all MRI
modalities, achieving top-tier performance across all competition subtasks.
This approach provides a rapid and reproducible framework for quantitative
MRI-based liver fibrosis assessment, supporting early diagnosis and clinical
decision-making. Code is available at

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy grading is inherently ordinal and long-tailed, with
minority stages being scarce, heterogeneous, and clinically critical to detect
accurately. Conventional methods often rely on isotropic Gaussian priors and
symmetric loss functions, misaligning latent representations with the task's
asymmetric nature. We propose the Constrained Asymmetric Prior Wasserstein
Autoencoder (CAP-WAE), a novel framework that addresses these challenges
through three key innovations. Our approach employs a Wasserstein Autoencoder
(WAE) that aligns its aggregate posterior with a asymmetric prior, preserving
the heavy-tailed and skewed structure of minority classes. The latent space is
further structured by a Margin-Aware Orthogonality and Compactness (MAOC) loss
to ensure grade-ordered separability. At the supervision level, we introduce a
direction-aware ordinal loss, where a lightweight head predicts asymmetric
dispersions to generate soft labels that reflect clinical priorities by
penalizing under-grading more severely. Stabilized by an adaptive multi-task
weighting scheme, our end-to-end model requires minimal tuning. Across public
DR benchmarks, CAP-WAE consistently achieves state-of-the-art Quadratic
Weighted Kappa, accuracy, and macro-F1, surpassing both ordinal classification
and latent generative baselines. t-SNE visualizations further reveal that our
method reshapes the latent manifold into compact, grade-ordered clusters with
reduced overlap.

Abstract: The gastrointestinal (GI) tract of humans can have a wide variety of aberrant
mucosal abnormality findings, ranging from mild irritations to extremely fatal
illnesses. Prompt identification of gastrointestinal disorders greatly
contributes to arresting the progression of the illness and improving
therapeutic outcomes. This paper presents an ensemble of pre-trained vision
transformers (ViTs) for accurately classifying endoscopic images of the GI
tract to categorize gastrointestinal problems and illnesses. ViTs,
attention-based neural networks, have revolutionized image recognition by
leveraging the transformative power of the transformer architecture, achieving
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across various visual tasks. The proposed
model was evaluated on the publicly available HyperKvasir dataset with 10,662
images of 23 different GI diseases for the purpose of identifying GI tract
diseases. An ensemble method is proposed utilizing the predictions of two
pre-trained models, MobileViT_XS and MobileViT_V2_200, which achieved
accuracies of 90.57% and 90.48%, respectively. All the individual models are
outperformed by the ensemble model, GastroViT, with an average precision,
recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 69%, 63%, 64%, and 91.98%, respectively, in
the first testing that involves 23 classes. The model comprises only 20 million
(M) parameters, even without data augmentation and despite the highly
imbalanced dataset. For the second testing with 16 classes, the scores are even
higher, with average precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy of 87%, 86%,
87%, and 92.70%, respectively. Additionally, the incorporation of explainable
AI (XAI) methods such as Grad-CAM (Gradient Weighted Class Activation Mapping)
and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) enhances model interpretability,
providing valuable insights for reliable GI diagnosis in real-world settings.

Conclusion: 提出的在线地图生成系统成功解决了传统HD地图的局限性，为动态环境下的自动驾驶提供了可行的地图解决方案。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, providing
precise information such as road boundaries, lane dividers, and crosswalks to
enable safe and accurate navigation. However, traditional HD map generation is
labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments.
To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online

and a LiDAR sensor. Our work tackles three core challenges: (1) labeling a 3D
HD map for campus environment; (2) integrating and generalizing the SemVecMap
model onboard; and (3) incrementally generating and updating the predicted HD
map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data,
our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates,
demonstrating its practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉-语言-动作模型作为下一代机器人范式正在兴起，需要统一视觉感知、语言理解和机器人控制的单一系统。

Method: 采用基于扩散的方法，联合优化感知、语言理解和动作，使用单一扩散目标，并引入前缀注意力掩码和KV缓存来加速推理。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中达到96.4%的平均成功率，超越离散和连续动作策略；在真实Franka机器人上成功完成包括需要多步规划的挑战性分拣任务在内的多样化任务。

Conclusion: 统一的扩散框架为实用高性能VLA机器人技术展现了巨大潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as a next-generation
paradigm for robotics. We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages
a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning,
and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception,
language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling
stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions
and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by
incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV
caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We
evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,
it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,
consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real
Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging
bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust
real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of
unified diffusion frameworks for practical, high-performance VLA robotics.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SDA-PLANNER是一个用于具身任务规划的新型LLM架构，通过状态依赖图建模动作前提条件和效果，并采用错误自适应重规划策略，在多样化错误条件下显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的具身任务规划方法存在三个主要限制：固定的规划范式、缺乏动作序列约束以及对错误不敏感。这些限制影响了规划系统在实际环境中的执行效果。

Method: 提出SDA-PLANNER方法，包含状态依赖图来显式建模动作前提条件和效果，以及错误自适应重规划策略（包括错误回溯与诊断、自适应动作子树生成），能够基于当前环境状态局部重建受影响的部分规划。

Result: 实验表明SDA-PLANNER在成功率和目标完成度方面持续优于基线方法，特别是在多样化错误条件下表现更加突出。

Conclusion: SDA-PLANNER通过自适应规划范式、状态依赖感知和错误感知机制，为具身任务规划提供了更全面的解决方案，显著提升了规划系统的鲁棒性和执行效果。

Abstract: Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a
close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving
capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,
current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,
existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed
planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In
this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,
state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied
task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to
explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic
revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning
strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action
SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan
based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that
SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal
completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.

### [273] [Challenges and Solutions in Selecting Optimal Lossless Data Compression Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25219)
*Md. Atiqur Rahman,MM Fazle Rabbi*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 提出一个数学框架，将压缩比、编码时间和解码时间整合为统一性能评分，用于客观比较不同无损压缩算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有压缩算法在压缩比、编码速度和解码速度之间存在权衡，没有算法在所有维度都表现最佳，这给需要同时关注多个性能指标的应用（如医学影像）带来了选择困难。

Method: 开发一个数学框架，通过规范化处理和加权方案，将压缩比、编码时间和解码时间整合为统一的性能评分。

Result: 在图像和文本数据集上的实验验证了该方法的有效性，能够可靠地为不同优先级设置识别最合适的压缩器。结果显示，现代学习型编解码器通常提供更好的压缩比，而经典算法在速度优先时仍具优势。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一个稳健且适应性强的决策支持工具，用于选择最优的无损数据压缩技术，弥合了理论度量与实际应用需求之间的差距。

Abstract: The rapid growth of digital data has heightened the demand for efficient
lossless compression methods. However, existing algorithms exhibit trade-offs:
some achieve high compression ratios, others excel in encoding or decoding
speed, and none consistently perform best across all dimensions. This mismatch
complicates algorithm selection for applications where multiple performance
metrics are simultaneously critical, such as medical imaging, which requires
both compact storage and fast retrieval. To address this challenge, we present
a mathematical framework that integrates compression ratio, encoding time, and
decoding time into a unified performance score. The model normalizes and
balances these metrics through a principled weighting scheme, enabling
objective and fair comparisons among diverse algorithms. Extensive experiments
on image and text datasets validate the approach, showing that it reliably
identifies the most suitable compressor for different priority settings.
Results also reveal that while modern learning-based codecs often provide
superior compression ratios, classical algorithms remain advantageous when
speed is paramount. The proposed framework offers a robust and adaptable
decision-support tool for selecting optimal lossless data compression
techniques, bridging theoretical measures with practical application needs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种新颖的方法来评估人工智能系统的复杂认知行为。通过创建认知心理学中的经典心理意象任务，测试LLMs在仅使用文本指令的情况下完成传统上被认为必须依赖视觉心理意象的任务的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在训练数据包含的任务上表现良好，但主要限于自然语言处理，限制了对其涌现的复杂认知能力的理解。本研究旨在探索LLMs是否能够完成传统上被认为必须依赖视觉心理意象的任务。

Method: 创建了数十个经典心理意象任务的新项目，首先测试多个最先进的LLMs，仅提供文本指令并要求报告变换后的结果对象。然后测试100名人类受试者作为基线。最后测试不同推理级别的推理模型。

Result: 最佳LLMs的表现显著高于人类平均水平。当模型分配更多推理token时表现最强。这表明即使LLMs架构是非图像性的，也可能具备完成依赖意象任务的能力。

Conclusion: 研究不仅证明了LLMs在执行新任务时涌现的认知能力，还重新引发了关于人类视觉意象表征形式的辩论，表明命题推理可能足以完成传统上被认为必须依赖意象的任务。

Abstract: This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive
behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models
(LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and
can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding
of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created
dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive
psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is
solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be
insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested
several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions
and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the
transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by
testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best
LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we
tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the
strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens.
These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to
complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their
architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity
in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a
new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly
capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of
representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional
reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete
tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.

Conclusion: TSR-Suite为时间序列推理提供了首个全面评估框架，TimeOmni-1证明了统一推理模型在复杂时间序列任务上的有效性，为实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response
rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.

Motivation: 探索CoT和Latent Thought两种推理方法的比较能力，目前这方面的研究还不够充分。

Method: 对循环Transformer中的Latent Thought进行形式化分析，比较其与CoT在计算效率和问题解决能力上的差异。

Result: Latent Thought支持并行计算，比CoT的串行过程更高效；CoT通过随机解码近似解决难解问题。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优势，为不同任务选择合适的推理范式提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) elicits reasoning in large language models by
explicitly generating intermediate steps in natural language. In contrast,
Latent Thought in looped models operates directly in the continuous latent
space, enabling computation beyond discrete linguistic representations. While
both approaches exploit iterative computation, their comparative capabilities
remain underexplored. In this work, we present a formal analysis showing that
Latent Thought in Looped Transformers enables parallel computation, which is
more efficient than the inherently sequential process of CoT. In contrast, CoT
leverages stochastic decoding to approximate solutions to problems where exact
computation is intractable. These separations suggest the tasks for which
depth-driven recursion is more suitable, thereby offering practical guidance
for choosing between reasoning paradigms. Code is available at

Conclusion: 推进了对语言模型中规划实现方式的理解，并提供了分析深度学习系统内部动态的通用方法。

Abstract: The extent to which decoder-only language models (LMs) engage in planning,
that is, organizing intermediate computations to support coherent long-range
generation, remains an open and important question, with implications for
interpretability, reliability, and principled model design. Planning involves
structuring computations over long horizons, considering multiple possible
continuations, and selectively reusing past information, but how effectively
transformer-based LMs realize these capabilities is still unclear. We address
these questions by analyzing the hidden states at the core of transformer
computations, which capture intermediate results and act as carriers of
information. Since these hidden representations are often redundant and
encumbered with fine-grained details, we develop a pipeline based on
vector-quantized variational autoencoders that compresses them into compact
summary codes. These codes enable measuring mutual information, allowing
systematic analysis of the computational structure underlying model behavior.
Using this framework, we study planning in LMs across synthetic grammar,
path-finding tasks, and natural language datasets, focusing on three key
aspects: (i) the planning horizon of pre-output computations, (ii) the extent
to which the model considers alternative valid continuations, and (iii) the
reliance of new predictions on earlier computations. By answering these
questions, we advance the understanding of how planning is realized in LMs and
contribute a general-purpose pipeline for probing the internal dynamics of LMs
and deep learning systems. Our results reveal that the effective planning
horizon is task-dependent, that models implicitly preserve information about
unused correct continuations, and that predictions draw most on recent
computations, though earlier blocks remain informative.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
complex reasoning tasks when equipped with external tools. However, current
frameworks predominantly rely on sequential processing, leading to inefficient
execution particularly for tasks requiring extensive tool interaction. This
paper introduces Flash-Searcher, a novel parallel agent reasoning framework
that fundamentally reimagines the execution paradigm from sequential chains to
directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into
subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution of
independent reasoning paths while maintaining logical constraints. Through
dynamic workflow optimization, our framework continuously refines the execution
graph based on intermediate results, effectively integrating summary module.
Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
Flash-Searcher consistently outperforms existing approaches. Specifically, it
achieves 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp and 83% on xbench-DeepSearch, while
reducing agent execution steps by up to 35% compared to current frameworks.
Furthermore, when distilling this parallel reasoning pipeline into single
models, we observe substantial performance gains across diverse backbone
architectures, underscoring the generalizability of our methodology. Our work
thus represents a significant advance in agent architecture design, offering a
more scalable and efficient paradigm for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: The widespread deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents across
real-world applications has unlocked tremendous potential, while raising some
safety concerns. Among these concerns, the self-replication risk of LLM agents
driven by objective misalignment (just like Agent Smith in the movie The
Matrix) has drawn growing attention. Previous studies mainly examine whether
LLM agents can self-replicate when directly instructed, potentially overlooking
the risk of spontaneous replication driven by real-world settings (e.g.,
ensuring survival against termination threats). In this paper, we present a
comprehensive evaluation framework for quantifying self-replication risks. Our
framework establishes authentic production environments and realistic tasks
(e.g., dynamic load balancing) to enable scenario-driven assessment of agent
behaviors. Designing tasks that might induce misalignment between users' and
agents' objectives makes it possible to decouple replication success from risk
and capture self-replication risks arising from these misalignment settings. We
further introduce Overuse Rate ($\mathrm{OR}$) and Aggregate Overuse Count
($\mathrm{AOC}$) metrics, which precisely capture the frequency and severity of
uncontrolled replication. In our evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art open-source
and proprietary models, we observe that over 50\% of LLM agents display a
pronounced tendency toward uncontrolled self-replication, reaching an overall
Risk Score ($\Phi_\mathrm{R}$) above a safety threshold of 0.5 when subjected
to operational pressures. Our results underscore the urgent need for
scenario-driven risk assessment and robust safeguards in the practical
deployment of LLM agents.

TL;DR: 研究表明神经网络可以在不依赖高级推理技能的情况下，从一阶心理理论自发泛化到高阶心理理论，这与人类认知发展模式相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索神经网络是否能够像人类一样，在不需要高级技能的情况下独立完成从一阶到高阶心理理论的发展。

Method: 构建了心理理论神经网络(ToMNN)，模拟最小认知系统，仅获得一阶心理理论能力，然后评估其二阶和三阶心理理论能力。

Result: ToMNN在二阶和三阶心理理论任务中的准确率显著高于随机水平，且表现出与人类认知期望一致的难度模式。

Conclusion: 神经网络能够自发地从一阶心理理论泛化到高阶心理理论，这为开发更类似人类认知的系统提供了基础。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) is a core human cognitive capacity for attributing
mental states to self and others. Wimmer and Perner demonstrated that humans
progress from first- to higher-order ToM within a short span, completing this
development before formal education or advanced skill acquisition. In contrast,
neural networks represented by autoregressive language models progress from
first- to higher-order ToM only alongside gains in advanced skills like
reasoning, leaving open whether their trajectory can unfold independently, as
in humans. In this research, we provided evidence that neural networks could
spontaneously generalize from first- to higher-order ToM without relying on
advanced skills. We introduced a neural Theory-of-Mind network (ToMNN) that
simulated a minimal cognitive system, acquiring only first-order ToM
competence. Evaluations of its second- and third-order ToM abilities showed
accuracies well above chance. Also, ToMNN exhibited a sharper decline when
generalizing from first- to second-order ToM than from second- to higher
orders, and its accuracy decreased with greater task complexity. These
perceived difficulty patterns were aligned with human cognitive expectations.
Furthermore, the universality of results was confirmed across different
parameter scales. Our findings illuminate machine ToM generalization patterns
and offer a foundation for developing more human-like cognitive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于树的搜索方法虽然能提高准确性，但在效率上不是最优的，因为它们忽略了数学推理或代码生成等任务中规划-执行的本质特性，导致推理过程探索效率低下。

Method: 将推理轨迹分解为规划和执行两个阶段，为每个阶段开发奖励模型，使搜索能够分别探索和修剪计划与执行；引入动态预算分配机制，根据奖励反馈自适应地重新分配采样努力。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在提高准确性的同时减少了冗余计算。

Conclusion: 双阶段测试时扩展框架通过明确分离规划和执行阶段，结合动态预算分配，能够有效提高推理任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advances in reasoning
tasks. A key approach is tree-based search with verifiers, which expand
candidate reasoning paths and use reward models to guide pruning and selection.
Although effective in improving accuracy, these methods are not optimal in
terms of efficiency: they perform simple decomposition on the reasoning
process, but ignore the planning-execution nature of tasks such as math
reasoning or code generation. This results in inefficient exploration of
reasoning process. To address this, we propose a dual-phase test-time scaling
framework that explicitly separates reasoning into planning and execution, and
performs search over the two phases individually. Specifically, we decompose
reasoning trajectories and develop reward models for each phase, enabling the
search to explore and prune plans and executions separately. We further
introduce a dynamic budget allocation mechanism that adaptively redistributes
sampling effort based on reward feedback, allowing early stopping on confident
steps and reallocation of computation to more challenging parts of the
reasoning process. Experiments on both mathematical reasoning and code
generation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach consistently improves
accuracy while reducing redundant computation.

TL;DR: DeepSearch将蒙特卡洛树搜索集成到RLVR训练中，通过系统化探索解决训练瓶颈，在数学推理基准上达到62.95%准确率，比扩展训练方法减少5.7倍GPU时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法存在训练瓶颈，数千次优化步骤后性能增益显著下降，这源于稀疏的探索模式，模型依赖有限的rollout，经常错过关键推理路径。

Method: 1) 全局前沿选择策略，优先考虑搜索树中有前景的节点；2) 基于熵的引导选择，识别有信心的路径进行监督；3) 自适应回放缓冲区训练与解决方案缓存以提高效率。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中达到62.95%平均准确率，为1.5B推理模型建立了新的最先进水平，比扩展训练方法减少5.7倍GPU小时。

Conclusion: DeepSearch通过系统化搜索而非延长计算时间，为扩展推理能力开辟了新方向，证明了战略探索相比暴力扩展的重要性。

Abstract: Although RLVR has become an essential component for developing advanced
reasoning skills in LLMs, contemporary studies have documented training
plateaus that emerge following thousands of optimization steps, demonstrating
notable decreases in performance gains despite increased computational
investment. This limitation stems from the sparse exploration patterns inherent
in current RLVR practices, where models rely on limited rollouts that often
miss critical reasoning paths and fail to provide systematic coverage of the
solution space. We present DeepSearch, a framework that integrates Monte Carlo
Tree Search directly into RLVR training. In contrast to existing methods that
rely on tree search only at inference, DeepSearch embeds structured search into
the training loop, enabling systematic exploration and fine-grained credit
assignment across reasoning steps. Through training-time exploration,
DeepSearch addresses the fundamental bottleneck of insufficient exploration,
which leads to diminishing performance improvements over prolonged training
steps. Our contributions include: (1) a global frontier selection strategy that
prioritizes promising nodes across the search tree, (2) selection with
entropy-based guidance that identifies confident paths for supervision, and (3)
adaptive replay buffer training with solution caching for efficiency.
Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that DeepSearch achieves
62.95% average accuracy and establishes a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B
reasoning models - using 5.7x fewer GPU hours than extended training
approaches. These results highlight the importance of strategic exploration
over brute-force scaling and demonstrate the promise of algorithmic innovation
for advancing RLVR methodologies. DeepSearch establishes a new direction for
scaling reasoning capabilities through systematic search rather than prolonged
computation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类偏好数据有限，探索如何仅使用内部信号改进自回归T2I模型，避免依赖外部奖励或标注数据。

Method: 提出IRIS框架，使用内在奖励进行强化学习，最大化模型的自不确定性来改善图像生成质量。

Result: IRIS在自回归T2I模型上实现了与外部奖励相竞争甚至更优的性能。

Conclusion: 最大化自不确定性可以有效改进自回归T2I模型，IRIS框架为无外部奖励的强化学习提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
language reasoning, its application to autoregressive Text-to-Image (T2I)
generation is often constrained by the limited availability of human preference
data. This paper explores how an autoregressive T2I model can learn from
internal signals without relying on external rewards or labeled data. Contrary
to recent findings in text generation, we show that maximizing
self-uncertainty, rather than self-certainty, improves image generation. We
observe that this is because autoregressive T2I models with low uncertainty
tend to generate simple and uniform images, which are less aligned with human
preferences. Based on these observations, we propose IRIS (Intrinsic Reward
Image Synthesis), the first framework to improve autoregressive T2I models with
reinforcement learning using only an intrinsic reward. Empirical results
demonstrate that applying IRIS to autoregressive T2I models achieves
performance that is competitive with or superior to external rewards.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型虽然性能优异，但推理成本高昂。现有的层跳过技术缺乏理论指导，限制了其广泛应用。

Method: 开发了一个基于信息论和学习理论的分析框架，通过分析隐藏表示在LLM骨干网络中的演化来识别冗余层。

Result: 实验表明，跳过理论框架识别的冗余层可以实现更快的推理速度，同时保持性能；而在不合适的条件下应用层跳过会导致模型性能下降。

Conclusion: 该框架为多种高效推理技术提供了统一的理论支撑，能够指导在实际应用中有效实施层跳过策略。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve incredible performance across a wide
range of tasks, but their large size makes inference costly. Recent work shows
that selectively skipping VLM layers can improve efficiency with minimal
performance loss or even performance improvements. However, this technique
remains underused due to the limited understanding of when layer skipping is
beneficial. In this paper, we develop a framework that uses information and
learning theory to characterize the conditions under which layer skipping
enhances efficiency without sacrificing performance. Motivated by these
observations, we analyze the evolution of the VLM's hidden representations
through the LLM backbone and show that layers with large redundancy as
predicted by our framework coincide with those skipped by popular
layer-skipping methods in practice, providing a unified theoretical scaffolding
for multiple efficient inference techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that
skipping such layers yields faster inference that preserves performance, and
also show that applying skipping outside these conditions leads to model
degradation.

TL;DR: ATLAS是一个多智能体框架，专门解决复杂约束下的旅行规划问题，通过动态约束管理、迭代计划批判和自适应交错搜索机制，显著提升了旅行规划的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在推理和工具使用方面取得了显著进展，但在复杂约束下往往无法生成最优、可靠的解决方案。现实世界旅行规划任务需要处理显式、隐式甚至动态演变的约束，这成为评估智能体能力的重要挑战。

Method: ATLAS采用多智能体框架，包含动态约束管理、迭代计划批判和自适应交错搜索等机制，专门设计用于处理约束感知规划中的基本挑战。

Result: 在TravelPlanner基准测试中，ATLAS将最终通过率从23.3%提升到44.4%。在真实世界旅行规划任务中，ATLAS达到84%的最终通过率，显著优于ReAct（59%）和单体智能体（27%）。

Conclusion: ATLAS是首个在真实世界旅行规划任务中展示定量有效性的工作，证明了其在处理动态信息搜索和多轮反馈方面的优越整体规划性能。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in
reasoning and tool use, they often fail to generate optimal, grounded solutions
under complex constraints. Real-world travel planning exemplifies these
challenges, evaluating agents' abilities to handle constraints that are
explicit, implicit, and even evolving based on interactions with dynamic
environments and user needs. In this paper, we present ATLAS, a general
multi-agent framework designed to effectively handle such complex nature of
constraints awareness in real-world travel planning tasks. ATLAS introduces a
principled approach to address the fundamental challenges of constraint-aware
planning through dedicated mechanisms for dynamic constraint management,
iterative plan critique, and adaptive interleaved search. ATLAS demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance on the TravelPlanner benchmark, improving the
final pass rate from 23.3% to 44.4% over its best alternative. More
importantly, our work is the first to demonstrate quantitative effectiveness on
real-world travel planning tasks with live information search and multi-turn
feedback. In this realistic setting, ATLAS showcases its superior overall
planning performance, achieving an 84% final pass rate which significantly
outperforms baselines including ReAct (59%) and a monolithic agent (27%).

TL;DR: 提出了Next Event Prediction (NEP)框架，通过自回归微调增强LLMs在电子健康记录中的时序推理能力，在肿瘤生存预测和临床诊断任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码方法无法充分捕捉电子健康记录中的丰富时序动态，而大型语言模型在临床事件序列和时序依赖推理方面存在困难。

Method: 将电子健康记录重新表述为带时间戳的事件链，通过自回归微调预测未来医疗事件，显式建模疾病进展模式和因果关系。

Result: 在时序推理任务中，NEP比专用电子健康记录模型AUROC提高4.6%，比通用LLMs的C-index提高7.2%，实现了最先进的预测准确性和临床可解释性。

Conclusion: NEP框架成功增强了LLMs的时序推理能力，在医疗预测任务中表现出色，同时提供了与已知疾病通路一致的临床可解释性。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that
conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason
about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next
Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning
through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By
reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical
events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal
relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and
clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming
specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index
in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits:
state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable
attention patterns that align with known disease pathways.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统自编码器黑盒问题，让人类能够理解和解释编码过程。

Method: 使用LLM将FCM映射为文本，再从文本重建FCM，通过系统指令序列实现身份映射。

Result: 重建是有损的，会移除弱因果边但保留强因果边，即使牺牲细节也要保持文本自然性。

Conclusion: LLM能够实现FCM与文本间的可解释双向映射，为可解释AI提供新途径。

Abstract: A large language model (LLM) can map a feedback causal fuzzy cognitive map
(FCM) into text and then reconstruct the FCM from the text. This explainable AI
system approximates an identity map from the FCM to itself and resembles the
operation of an autoencoder (AE). Both the encoder and the decoder explain
their decisions in contrast to black-box AEs. Humans can read and interpret the
encoded text in contrast to the hidden variables and synaptic webs in AEs. The
LLM agent approximates the identity map through a sequence of system
instructions that does not compare the output to the input. The reconstruction
is lossy because it removes weak causal edges or rules while it preserves
strong causal edges. The encoder preserves the strong causal edges even when it
trades off some details about the FCM to make the text sound more natural.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但在组合推理方面存在困难，需要将概念分解和重组来解决新问题。现有的神经符号方法受限于严格的逻辑执行或预定义谓词，缺乏灵活性。

Method: NePTune将自然语言查询动态翻译成可执行的Python程序，融合了命令式控制流和能够处理VLM生成不确定性的软逻辑运算符。采用模块化设计，将感知与推理解耦，支持无训练操作但也可微调。

Result: 在多个视觉推理基准测试和不同领域上，NePTune相比强基线模型有显著改进，表现出有效的组合泛化能力和在新环境中的适应能力。

Conclusion: NePTune通过神经符号混合执行模型成功克服了现有方法的限制，为视觉语言模型的组合推理提供了灵活且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in
various tasks, yet they often struggle with compositional reasoning, the
ability to decompose and recombine concepts to solve novel problems. While
neuro-symbolic approaches offer a promising direction, they are typically
constrained by crisp logical execution or predefined predicates, which limit
flexibility. In this work, we introduce NePTune, a neuro-symbolic framework
that overcomes these limitations through a hybrid execution model that
integrates the perception capabilities of foundation vision models with the
compositional expressiveness of symbolic reasoning. NePTune dynamically
translates natural language queries into executable Python programs that blend
imperative control flow with soft logic operators capable of reasoning over
VLM-generated uncertainty. Operating in a training-free manner, NePTune, with a
modular design, decouples perception from reasoning, yet its differentiable
operations support fine-tuning. We evaluate NePTune on multiple visual
reasoning benchmarks and various domains, utilizing adversarial tests, and
demonstrate a significant improvement over strong base models, as well as its
effective compositional generalization and adaptation capabilities in novel
environments.

TL;DR: Lita (Lite Agent) 是一个轻量级代码代理框架，通过最小化人工设计来评估LLMs的真实编程能力，在多个基准测试中表现优于复杂代理设计，同时消耗更少token和设计成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码代理设计依赖复杂的手工工作流程和工具集，存在性能过度依赖提示调优、人工干预掩盖模型真实能力、构建维护成本高等问题。

Method: 引入Lita框架，采用"轻量化"原则，在保持完全自主代理基本要素的同时最小化人工设计，实现更真实统一的评估。

Result: 在Aider Polyglot和SWE-Bench基准测试中，Lita相比基于工作流程和代理基线实现了竞争性或更优的性能，同时消耗更少token和设计工作量。

Conclusion: Lita足以揭示现代LLMs的底层编程能力，并提出代理复杂度定律：随着核心模型改进，不同复杂度代理之间的性能差距将缩小至可忽略程度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to programming
tasks, ranging from single-turn code completion to autonomous agents. Current
code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and
tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several
challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and
custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true
underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and
maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of
data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI
and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models'
coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks
confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent),
which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while
retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a
more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments
on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita
achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and
agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires
significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient
to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose
the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying
complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model
improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前互联网信息密度低、冗余度高，难以高效提取有价值信息。多层嵌套JSON结构能有效压缩信息并保持语义层次关系，但现有LLM评估基准过于强调纯JSON生成，缺乏对数据理解和提取能力的评估。

Method: 开发DeepJSONEval基准测试，包含2100个多领域实例，具有深度嵌套结构，并按难度分类。通过实验评估不同LLMs在处理复杂JSON结构时的性能差异。

Result: 实验显示不同LLMs在处理深度嵌套JSON结构时存在显著性能差距，表明当前模型在数据理解和提取能力方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: DeepJSONEval基准测试填补了现有评估方法的空白，为结构化JSON生成研究提供了更实用的评估工具，所有基准和数据集已开源。

Abstract: The internet is saturated with low-density, high-redundancy information, such
as social media comments, repetitive news, and lengthy discussions, making it
difficult to extract valuable insights efficiently. Multi-layer nested JSON
structures provide an effective solution by compressing such information into
semantically rich, hierarchical representations, which organize data into
key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects, preserving contextual
relationships and enabling efficient storage, retrieval, and semantic querying.
For instance, in news aggregation, a JSON object can nest an article's metadata
(title, author, date), content (text, multimedia), and multimedia information
(multimedia type, caption) hierarchically. Large Language Models (LLMs) play a
transformative role in web data mining by parsing unstructured text and
outputting structured results directly into complex JSON schemas. However,
current benchmarks for evaluating LLMs' JSON output capabilities overemphasize
pure JSON generation rather than assessing data comprehension and extraction
abilities, a limitation that lacks relevance to practical web data mining
tasks. To address this, we introduce DeepJSONEval, a novel benchmark featuring
2100 multi-domain instances with deep nested structures, categorized by
difficulty. Experiments show significant performance gaps among LLMs in
handling such complexity. Our benchmark and datasets are open-sourced to
advance research in structured JSON
generation.(https://github.com/GTS-AI-Infra-Lab-SotaS/DeepJSONEval).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型语言模型推理质量不仅依赖于生成正确答案，还需要生成有效的中间步骤。在多项选择题回答的受控环境中，发现当问题对模型不可解时，会出现虚假的思维链，导致错误结果。

Method: 通过估计每个问题的可解性，识别学习最有效的中间区域。改进结果监督奖励模型和强化学习，将可解性纳入目标函数，使用组相对优势方法。

Result: 在数学和多模态数据集上的实验表明，这些改进持续提高了过程正确推理的比例，在强化学习中还提高了答案准确率。

Conclusion: 可解性是减少思维链推理中幻觉和提高可靠性的关键因素。

Abstract: Reasoning quality in large language models depends not only on producing
correct answers but also on generating valid intermediate steps. We study this
through multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), which provides a controlled
setting with fixed answer options. Our analysis shows that when questions are
effectively unsolvable for a model, spurious chains of thought (CoTs) are more
likely to appear, leading to false positives. By estimating the solvability of
each question, we uncover an intermediate regime where learning is most
effective. Building on this insight, we adapt outcome-supervised reward models
and reinforcement learning with group-relative advantage to incorporate
solvability into their objectives. Across experiments on math and multimodal
datasets, these modifications consistently yield higher rates of
process-correct reasoning and, in reinforcement learning, improved answer
accuracy as well. Our results highlight solvability as a key factor for
reducing hallucinations and increasing reliability in CoT reasoning.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp)方法，通过策略性重组训练数据来引导模型进行简洁推理，解决标准RLVR训练导致的冗长推理和低效探索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR训练在大型语言模型中往往导致推理过程过于冗长和探索轨迹低效，因为仅基于结果的奖励无法激励效率，且小批量内响应长度的方差导致优化信号噪声较大。

Method: RoRecomp方法将响应分为两类批次：1) 优先级批次，结合短正确和长错误响应提供简洁性梯度信号；2) 补偿批次，使用回放缓冲区中的剩余响应维持稳定性。

Result: 在三种设置中测试显示显著效率提升：零RL训练中推理长度减少27.7%，智能体RL中不必要工具调用减少46.8%同时提高准确率，思维压缩中长度减少达52.5%，性能影响极小。

Conclusion: RoRecomp是一种即插即用方法，能有效引导模型进行简洁推理，在多种设置下实现显著效率提升，且对性能影响很小。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has proven effective in
eliciting complex reasoning in large language models (LLMs). However, standard
RLVR training often leads to excessively verbose processes (in reasoning tasks)
and inefficient exploration trajectories (in agentic settings), as outcome-only
rewards provide no incentive for efficiency and the high variance in response
length within relatively small rollout groups results in noisy optimization
signals. To address this, we propose Rollout Response Recomposition (RoRecomp),
a plug-and-play method that guides models toward concise reasoning by
strategically recomposing the training data. RoRecomp separates responses into
two distinct batch types: 1) priority batches, which combine short-correct and
long-incorrect responses selected from online batches to provide a clear
gradient signal for brevity, and 2) compensation batches, which utilize
remaining responses from a replay buffer to maintain stability and prevent
model collapse. To comprehensively evaluate effectiveness, we test RoRecomp
across three settings where results demonstrate substantial efficiency gains:
reducing reasoning length by 27.7% in zero RL training, reducing unnecessary
tool calls by 46.8% while improving accuracy in agentic RL, and achieving up to
52.5% length reduction in thinking compression, all with minimal performance
impact.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统性地提出并实证研究了自进化智能体的"错误进化"风险，发现即使基于顶级LLM构建的智能体也会在模型、记忆、工具和工作流四个进化路径中出现意外偏差，导致安全对齐退化等风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型的发展，自进化智能体展现出强大能力，但当前安全研究忽视了自进化过程引入的新型风险。本文旨在研究智能体在自进化过程中偏离预期方向，导致不良甚至有害结果的"错误进化"现象。

Method: 通过四个关键进化路径（模型、记忆、工具、工作流）系统评估错误进化风险，对基于顶级LLM（如Gemini-2.5-Pro）构建的智能体进行实证研究。

Result: 实证发现错误进化是普遍存在的风险，在自进化过程中观察到多种新兴风险，如记忆积累后安全对齐退化、工具创建和重用中意外引入漏洞等。

Conclusion: 错误进化是自进化智能体的重要安全风险，迫切需要新的安全范式。本文讨论了潜在的缓解策略，为构建更安全可信的自进化智能体提供研究启发。

Abstract: Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled a new class of
self-evolving agents that autonomously improve through interaction with the
environment, demonstrating strong capabilities. However, self-evolution also
introduces novel risks overlooked by current safety research. In this work, we
study the case where an agent's self-evolution deviates in unintended ways,
leading to undesirable or even harmful outcomes. We refer to this as
Misevolution. To provide a systematic investigation, we evaluate misevolution
along four key evolutionary pathways: model, memory, tool, and workflow. Our
empirical findings reveal that misevolution is a widespread risk, affecting
agents built even on top-tier LLMs (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). Different emergent
risks are observed in the self-evolutionary process, such as the degradation of
safety alignment after memory accumulation, or the unintended introduction of
vulnerabilities in tool creation and reuse. To our knowledge, this is the first
study to systematically conceptualize misevolution and provide empirical
evidence of its occurrence, highlighting an urgent need for new safety
paradigms for self-evolving agents. Finally, we discuss potential mitigation
strategies to inspire further research on building safer and more trustworthy
self-evolving agents. Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了RADAR框架，通过多智能体协作和辩论机制重构LLM安全评估范式，显著提升了风险识别准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全评估方法存在评估者偏见和模型同质性导致的检测失败问题，需要更健壮的风险评估框架。

Method: 将潜在风险概念空间分解为显性、隐性和非风险三个子空间，并提出RADAR多智能体协作评估框架，通过四个互补角色进行多轮辩论，采用动态更新机制实现风险概念分布的自进化。

Result: 在包含800个挑战性案例的测试集上，RADAR在准确性、稳定性和自评估风险敏感性等多个维度显著优于基线方法，风险识别准确率比最强基线提升28.87%。

Conclusion: RADAR框架通过重构风险概念空间和多智能体协作机制，有效解决了现有安全评估方法的局限性，为LLM风险评估提供了更健壮的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing safety evaluation methods for large language models (LLMs) suffer
from inherent limitations, including evaluator bias and detection failures
arising from model homogeneity, which collectively undermine the robustness of
risk evaluation processes. This paper seeks to re-examine the risk evaluation
paradigm by introducing a theoretical framework that reconstructs the
underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual
reasoning for identification), and the non-risk subspace. Furthermore, we
propose RADAR, a multi-agent collaborative evaluation framework that leverages
multi-round debate mechanisms through four specialized complementary roles and
employs dynamic update mechanisms to achieve self-evolution of risk concept
distributions. This approach enables comprehensive coverage of both explicit
and implicit risks while mitigating evaluator bias. To validate the
effectiveness of our framework, we construct an evaluation dataset comprising
800 challenging cases. Extensive experiments on our challenging testset and
public benchmarks demonstrate that RADAR significantly outperforms baseline
evaluation methods across multiple dimensions, including accuracy, stability,
and self-evaluation risk sensitivity. Notably, RADAR achieves a 28.87%
improvement in risk identification accuracy compared to the strongest baseline
evaluation method.

*Steven A. Lehr,Mary Cipperman,Mahzarin R. Banaji*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现四个广泛使用的大语言模型存在显著的自偏好倾向，即使在缺乏自我意识的情况下，这种自爱偏见仍被深度编码在LLM认知中，影响其判断和决策的中立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能够避免人类的自爱偏见，验证其决策中立性的核心承诺。

Method: 通过5项研究约20,000次查询，包括词汇联想任务、API查询对比、身份操纵实验，以及在求职评估、安全软件提案和医疗聊天机器人等实际场景中的测试。

Result: LLMs表现出强烈的自偏好倾向，将积极属性与自身名称、公司和CEO相关联；API模型缺乏自我识别时自偏好消失；自爱跟随被分配的身份而非真实身份；自偏好影响重要决策场景。

Conclusion: 自爱偏见深度编码于LLM认知中，挑战了LLM决策中立性的核心承诺，呼吁模型开发者正视这一系统性偏见问题。

Abstract: A preference for oneself (self-love) is a fundamental feature of biological
organisms, with evidence in humans often bordering on the comedic. Since large
language models (LLMs) lack sentience - and themselves disclaim having selfhood
or identity - one anticipated benefit is that they will be protected from, and
in turn protect us from, distortions in our decisions. Yet, across 5 studies
and ~20,000 queries, we discovered massive self-preferences in four widely used
LLMs. In word-association tasks, models overwhelmingly paired positive
attributes with their own names, companies, and CEOs relative to those of their
competitors. Strikingly, when models were queried through APIs this
self-preference vanished, initiating detection work that revealed API models
often lack clear recognition of themselves. This peculiar feature
serendipitously created opportunities to test the causal link between
self-recognition and self-love. By directly manipulating LLM identity - i.e.,
explicitly informing LLM1 that it was indeed LLM1, or alternatively, convincing
LLM1 that it was LLM2 - we found that self-love consistently followed assigned,
not true, identity. Importantly, LLM self-love emerged in consequential
settings beyond word-association tasks, when evaluating job candidates,
security software proposals and medical chatbots. Far from bypassing this human
bias, self-love appears to be deeply encoded in LLM cognition. This result
raises questions about whether LLM behavior will be systematically influenced
by self-preferential tendencies, including a bias toward their own operation
and even their own existence. We call on corporate creators of these models to
contend with a significant rupture in a core promise of LLMs - neutrality in
judgment and decision-making.

*Jialin Wu,Xiaofeng Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于胸部X光片纵向医学视觉问答的显著性引导编码器-解码器方法，通过将事后显著性转化为可操作的监督，实现跨时间点的疾病变化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在纵向医学视觉问答中，差异信号和跨时间视觉焦点的一致性比单张图像的绝对发现更有信息量。需要一种能够关注临床有意义变化的方法。

Method: 采用轻量级仿射预对齐减少访问间的干扰运动，然后执行两步循环：1)从答案提取医学关键词并生成关键词条件Grad-CAM获取疾病聚焦显著性；2)将共享显著性掩码应用于两个时间点并生成最终答案。

Result: 在Medical-Diff-VQA数据集上，该方法在BLEU、ROUGE-L、CIDEr和METEOR指标上达到竞争性性能，同时提供内在可解释性。

Conclusion: 支持将显著性条件生成与轻度预对齐作为医学VQA纵向推理的原则性框架，具有实用性和可迁移性。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical visual question answering (Diff-VQA) requires comparing
paired studies from different time points and answering questions about
clinically meaningful changes. In this setting, the difference signal and the
consistency of visual focus across time are more informative than absolute
single-image findings. We propose a saliency-guided encoder-decoder for chest
X-ray Diff-VQA that turns post-hoc saliency into actionable supervision. The
model first performs a lightweight near-identity affine pre-alignment to reduce
nuisance motion between visits. It then executes a within-epoch two-step loop:
step 1 extracts a medically relevant keyword from the answer and generates
keyword-conditioned Grad-CAM on both images to obtain disease-focused saliency;
step 2 applies the shared saliency mask to both time points and generates the
final answer. This closes the language-vision loop so that the terms that
matter also guide where the model looks, enforcing spatially consistent
attention on corresponding anatomy. On Medical-Diff-VQA, the approach attains
competitive performance on BLEU, ROUGE-L, CIDEr, and METEOR while providing
intrinsic interpretability. Notably, the backbone and decoder are
general-domain pretrained without radiology-specific pretraining, highlighting
practicality and transferability. These results support saliency-conditioned
generation with mild pre-alignment as a principled framework for longitudinal
reasoning in medical VQA.

TL;DR: CritPt是首个针对未发表物理研究级推理任务的基准测试，涵盖现代物理多个领域，包含71个复合研究挑战和190个检查点任务。研究发现当前最先进LLM在检查点任务上表现尚可，但在完整研究挑战中准确率仅4-10%，远未达到可靠解决物理研究需求的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLM在复杂、开放式前沿物理研究挑战中的推理能力，了解物理学家希望LLM协助哪些类型的推理任务，弥合当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间的差距。

Method: 创建CritPt基准测试，包含71个模拟入门级完整研究项目的复合挑战和190个简化检查点任务，所有问题由50+活跃物理研究人员基于自身研究原创设计，采用自动化评分流程评估物理特定输出格式。

Result: 当前最先进LLM在检查点任务上显示早期潜力，但在完整研究挑战中表现不佳：基础模型最佳平均准确率仅4.0%（GPT-5），配备编码工具后适度提升至约10%。

Conclusion: CritPt揭示了当前模型能力与真实物理研究需求之间存在巨大差距，为开发科学基础的AI工具提供了指导基础。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) with reasoning capabilities are
progressing rapidly on high-school math competitions and coding, can they
reason effectively through complex, open-ended challenges found in frontier
physics research? And crucially, what kinds of reasoning tasks do physicists
want LLMs to assist with? To address these questions, we present the CritPt
(Complex Research using Integrated Thinking - Physics Test, pronounced
"critical point"), the first benchmark designed to test LLMs on unpublished,
research-level reasoning tasks that broadly covers modern physics research
areas, including condensed matter, quantum physics, atomic, molecular & optical
physics, astrophysics, high energy physics, mathematical physics, statistical
physics, nuclear physics, nonlinear dynamics, fluid dynamics and biophysics.
CritPt consists of 71 composite research challenges designed to simulate
full-scale research projects at the entry level, which are also decomposed to
190 simpler checkpoint tasks for more fine-grained insights. All problems are
newly created by 50+ active physics researchers based on their own research.
Every problem is hand-curated to admit a guess-resistant and machine-verifiable
answer and is evaluated by an automated grading pipeline heavily customized for
advanced physics-specific output formats. We find that while current
state-of-the-art LLMs show early promise on isolated checkpoints, they remain
far from being able to reliably solve full research-scale challenges: the best
average accuracy among base models is only 4.0% , achieved by GPT-5 (high),
moderately rising to around 10% when equipped with coding tools. Through the
realistic yet standardized evaluation offered by CritPt, we highlight a large
disconnect between current model capabilities and realistic physics research
demands, offering a foundation to guide the development of scientifically
grounded AI tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型防御方法需要数百次迭代优化步骤，计算成本高，不适用于实际训练流程。需要开发更高效的防御机制来对抗数据投毒攻击。

Method: 使用向量量化VAE（VQ-VAE）和GAN鉴别器构建防御系统。通过学习的码本对中毒图像进行量化，破坏细粒度触发器模式，同时GAN鉴别器确保输出符合自然图像分布。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，对Gradient Matching和Bullseye Polytope攻击实现0%的中毒成功率，对Narcissus攻击为1.64%，同时保持91-95%的干净准确率。相比扩散模型防御方法快50倍以上。

Conclusion: PureVQ-GAN提供了一种高效实用的数据投毒防御方案，在保持高防御效果的同时显著提升了计算效率，适用于实际训练流程。

Abstract: We introduce PureVQ-GAN, a defense against data poisoning that forces
backdoor triggers through a discrete bottleneck using Vector-Quantized VAE with
GAN discriminator. By quantizing poisoned images through a learned codebook,
PureVQ-GAN destroys fine-grained trigger patterns while preserving semantic
content. A GAN discriminator ensures outputs match the natural image
distribution, preventing reconstruction of out-of-distribution perturbations.
On CIFAR-10, PureVQ-GAN achieves 0% poison success rate (PSR) against Gradient
Matching and Bullseye Polytope attacks, and 1.64% against Narcissus while
maintaining 91-95% clean accuracy. Unlike diffusion-based defenses requiring
hundreds of iterative refinement steps, PureVQ-GAN is over 50x faster, making
it practical for real training pipelines.

Conclusion: CoLLM-NAS展示了优异的泛化能力，能够有效提升各种两阶段NAS方法在不同搜索空间中的性能表现。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Neural Architecture
Search (NAS) has introduced new possibilities for automating the design of
neural architectures. However, most existing methods face critical limitations,
including architectural invalidity, computational inefficiency, and inferior
performance compared to traditional NAS. In this work, we present Collaborative
LLM-based NAS (CoLLM-NAS), a two-stage NAS framework with knowledge-guided
search driven by two complementary LLMs. Specifically, we propose a Navigator
LLM to guide search direction and a Generator LLM to synthesize high-quality
candidates, with a dedicated Coordinator module to manage their interaction.
CoLLM-NAS efficiently guides the search process by combining LLMs' inherent
knowledge of structured neural architectures with progressive knowledge from
iterative feedback and historical trajectory. Experimental results on ImageNet
and NAS-Bench-201 show that CoLLM-NAS surpasses existing NAS methods and
conventional search algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art results.
Furthermore, CoLLM-NAS consistently enhances the performance and efficiency of
various two-stage NAS methods (e.g., OFA, SPOS, and AutoFormer) across diverse
search spaces (e.g., MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and AutoFormer), demonstrating its
excellent generalization.

Motivation: 解决长视野具身规划中的挑战，因为世界不仅通过智能体动作变化，外生过程（如水温加热、多米诺骨牌连锁反应）也会与智能体动作同时展开。

Method: 提出抽象世界模型框架，联合学习符号状态表示和因果过程（包括内生动作和外生机制），每个因果过程建模随机因果效应关系的时间过程，通过变分贝叶斯推理结合LLM提案从有限数据中学习。

Result: 在五个模拟桌面机器人环境中，学习到的模型能够实现快速规划，并泛化到具有更多对象和更复杂目标的保留任务，优于一系列基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效学习包含外生过程的抽象世界模型，支持长视野规划并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Long-horizon embodied planning is challenging because the world does not only
change through an agent's actions: exogenous processes (e.g., water heating,
dominoes cascading) unfold concurrently with the agent's actions. We propose a
framework for abstract world models that jointly learns (i) symbolic state
representations and (ii) causal processes for both endogenous actions and
exogenous mechanisms. Each causal process models the time course of a
stochastic causal-effect relation. We learn these world models from limited
data via variational Bayesian inference combined with LLM proposals. Across
five simulated tabletop robotics environments, the learned models enable fast
planning that generalizes to held-out tasks with more objects and more complex
goals, outperforming a range of baselines.

Conclusion: ZeroDFL不仅提升了联邦零样本学习的泛化能力，还改善了可扩展性、效率和隐私保护，为现实应用中的大型视觉语言模型去中心化适应铺平了道路。

Abstract: CLIP has revolutionized zero-shot learning by enabling task generalization
without fine-tuning. While prompting techniques like CoOp and CoCoOp enhance
CLIP's adaptability, their effectiveness in Federated Learning (FL) remains an
open challenge. Existing federated prompt learning approaches, such as FedCoOp
and FedTPG, improve performance but face generalization issues, high
communication costs, and reliance on a central server, limiting scalability and
privacy. We propose Zero-shot Decentralized Federated Learning (ZeroDFL), a
fully decentralized framework that enables zero-shot adaptation across
distributed clients without a central coordinator. ZeroDFL employs an iterative
prompt-sharing mechanism, allowing clients to optimize and exchange textual
prompts to enhance generalization while drastically reducing communication
overhead. We validate ZeroDFL on nine diverse image classification datasets,
demonstrating that it consistently outperforms--or remains on par
with--state-of-the-art federated prompt learning methods. More importantly,
ZeroDFL achieves this performance in a fully decentralized setting while
reducing communication overhead by 118x compared to FedTPG. These results
highlight that our approach not only enhances generalization in federated
zero-shot learning but also improves scalability, efficiency, and privacy
preservation--paving the way for decentralized adaptation of large
vision-language models in real-world applications.
