TL;DR: LLMs在逻辑谜题上表现脆弱，主要依赖记忆模板而非真实推理。当谜题被轻微修改时，模型性能急剧下降，出现'幻影回忆'现象——自信地复述记忆中的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs是否真正具备推理能力，还是仅仅依赖记忆模板。通过系统评估模型在修改版逻辑谜题上的表现，揭示其推理能力的局限性。

Method: 引入PHANTOM RECALL基准，包含25个经典逻辑谜题和149个精心设计的扰动版本。评估11个主流LLM，开发自动化逻辑等价判断器、细粒度错误分类法和基于提示的缓解框架。

Result: 模型在原始谜题上准确率接近完美，但在扰动版本上表现显著低于人类水平，出现幻影回忆和过度阐述等错误模式。

Conclusion: LLMs在上下文线索变化时往往无法重新推理，揭示了语言流畅性与逻辑理解之间的关键差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini, and Claude often appear
adept at solving classic logic puzzles--but how much genuine reasoning
underlies their answers? Recent evidence suggests that these models frequently
rely on memorized templates rather than reasoning from first principles. When
puzzles are slightly modified, their performance collapses, revealing a
striking fragility. In particular, we asked: Have LLMs addressed these issues?
To what extent? How about perturbations to other puzzles? Is there a general
way of reformulating the prompt so that the models do better? To examine these
things systematically, we introduce PHANTOM RECALL, a benchmark comprising 25
well-known logic puzzles and 149 carefully designed perturbations that preserve
reasoning structure but alter superficial details and solutions. We evaluate
eleven leading LLMs and identify a recurring failure mode--phantom
recall--where models confidently reproduce memorized solutions or spurious
rationales that no longer fit the altered scenario. To probe and mitigate this
issue, we contribute three tools: (i) an automated logical-equivalence judge to
detect reasoning mismatches, (ii) a taxonomy of fine-grained reasoning error
categories, and (iii) a prompting-based mitigation framework guided by these
categories. Despite near-perfect accuracy on unmodified puzzles, models
significantly underperform humans on perturbed ones, exhibiting both phantom
recall and over-elaboration. Our findings reveal a crucial limitation: LLMs
often fail to re-reason when contextual cues shift--highlighting the gap
between linguistic fluency and logical understanding.

### [2] [R-WoM: Retrieval-augmented World Model For Computer-use Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11892)
*Kai Mei,Jiang Guo,Shuaichen Chang,Mingwen Dong,Dongkyu Lee,Xing Niu,Jiarong Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs作为世界模型在数字环境中增强智能体决策，但存在幻觉和静态知识限制。研究提出R-WoM方法，通过检索外部教程知识来提升长期模拟性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否适合作为世界模型，解决其幻觉问题和静态知识依赖导致的长期模拟误差累积问题。

Method: 通过三个任务评估LLMs的世界建模能力：下一状态识别、完整流程规划对齐和里程碑转换识别。提出R-WoM方法，通过检索外部教程知识来增强LLM模拟。

Result: LLMs能有效捕捉即时下一状态和识别有意义的转换，但在完整流程规划中性能迅速下降。R-WoM在OSWorld和WebArena上分别提升25.3%和18.1%。

Conclusion: LLMs在长期环境动态建模方面存在局限性，R-WoM通过知识检索显著提升了长期模拟性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can serve as world models to enhance agent
decision-making in digital environments by simulating future states and
predicting action outcomes, potentially eliminating costly trial-and-error
exploration. However, this capability is fundamentally limited by LLMs'
tendency toward hallucination and their reliance on static training knowledge,
which can lead to compounding errors that inhibit long-horizon simulations. To
systematically investigate whether LLMs are appropriate for world modeling, we
probe two core capabilities of world models--future state prediction and reward
estimation--through three tasks: next-state identification, full-procedure
planning alignment, and milestone transition recognition. Our analysis shows
that while LLMs effectively capture immediate next states and identify
meaningful state transitions, their performance rapidly degrades in
full-procedure planning. This highlights LLMs' limitations in reliably modeling
environment dynamics over long horizons. To address these limitations, we
propose the Retrieval-augmented World Model (R-WoM), which grounds LLM
simulations by incorporating factual, up-to-date knowledge retrieved from
external tutorials. Experiments show that R-WoM achieves substantial
improvements of up to 25.3% (OSWorld) and 18.1% (WebArena) compared to
baselines, with particular advantages in longer-horizon simulations.

### [3] [LLM Knowledge is Brittle: Truthfulness Representations Rely on Superficial Resemblance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11905)
*Patrick Haller,Mark Ibrahim,Polina Kirichenko,Levent Sagun,Samuel J. Bell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大语言模型对输入的表层形式变化非常敏感，即使语义保持不变，微小的输入变化也会导致模型内部对陈述真实性的表示能力崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型性能脆弱性的根本原因，检验这种脆弱性是否源于内部知识表示的不稳定性。

Method: 通过对陈述应用语义保持的扰动（如拼写错误、重新表述），评估在不同OOD程度下模型表示可分离性的退化情况，涵盖4个LLM家族、5个评估数据集和3种知识探测方法。

Result: 当样本呈现形式与预训练数据差异增大时，模型对陈述真实性的内部表示能力会崩溃。模型仅在输入与预训练数据相似时能区分真假陈述，这种能力高度依赖具体的表层形式。

Conclusion: 大语言模型可能学习了浅层、非鲁棒的知识表示，这解释了基准测试性能的脆弱性，并对真实性探测的实用性提出了根本挑战。

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs) to be reliable, they must learn robust
knowledge that can be generally applied in diverse settings -- often unlike
those seen during training. Yet, extensive research has shown that LLM
performance can be brittle, with models exhibiting excessive sensitivity to
trivial input variations. In this work, we explore whether this brittleness is
a direct result of unstable internal knowledge representations. To explore this
question, we build on previous work showing that LLM representations encode
statement truthfulness -- i.e., true, factual statements can be easily
separated from false, inaccurate ones. Specifically, we test the robustness of
learned knowledge by evaluating representation separability on samples that
have undergone superficial transformations to drive them out-of-distribution
(OOD), such as typos or reformulations. By applying semantically-preserving
perturbations, we study how separability degrades as statements become more
OOD, across four LLM families, five evaluation datasets, and three knowledge
probing methods. Our results reveal that internal representations of statement
truthfulness collapse as the samples' presentations become less similar to
those seen during pre-training. While LLMs can often distinguish between true
and false statements when they closely resemble the pre-training data, this
ability is highly dependent on the statement's exact surface form. These
findings offer a possible explanation for brittle benchmark performance: LLMs
may learn shallow, non-robust knowledge representations that allow for only
limited generalizability. Our work presents a fundamental challenge for the
utility of truthfulness probes, and more broadly, calls for further research on
improving the robustness of learned knowledge representations.

### [4] [LLM Reasoning for Machine Translation: Synthetic Data Generation over Thinking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11919)
*Armel Zebaze,Rachel Bawden,Benoît Sagot*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型推理模型在机器翻译任务中生成中间"思考标记"并不能提升翻译性能，即使使用基于人类翻译实践的链式思维蒸馏方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在机器翻译任务中生成中间标记的潜在益处，特别是在不同资源水平和设置下的多语言对翻译中。

Method: 使用蒸馏链式思维方法微调模型，生成逐步翻译的合成解释，并构建模块化翻译特定提示策略的中间标记。

Result: 思考标记不能帮助大型推理模型更好地执行机器翻译，包含翻译尝试的中间标记在微调中贡献更大。

Conclusion: 使用教师模型精炼目标翻译或扩展平行语料库比将链式思维解释蒸馏到"思考"翻译模型中更有效。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have led to new possibilities in terms of
problem-solving, through the devising of a natural language thought process
prior to answering a query. While their capabilities are well known across
mathematics and coding tasks, their impact on the task of machine translation
(MT) remains underexplored. In this work, we explore the benefits of the
generation of intermediate tokens when performing MT across multiple language
pairs of different levels of resourcedness and multiple setups. We find that
"thinking tokens" do not help LRMs better perform MT. This result generalizes
to models fine-tuned to reason before translating using distilled chain of
thought (CoT) inspired by human translators' practices. Specifically,
fine-tuning a model with synthetic CoT explanations detailing how to translate
step-by-step does not outperform standard input-output fine-tuning. However,
constructing the intermediate tokens by combining the outputs of modular
translation-specific prompting strategies results in improvements. Our findings
underscore that the contribution of intermediate tokens during fine-tuning
highly depends on the presence of translation attempts within them. More
broadly, our results suggest that using a teacher to refine target translations
or to expand parallel corpora is more impactful than distilling their CoT
explanations into "thinking" MT models.

### [5] [Discrepancy Detection at the Data Level: Toward Consistent Multilingual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11928)
*Lorena Calvo-Bartolomé,Valérie Aldana,Karla Cantarero,Alonso Madroñal de Mesa,Jerónimo Arenas-García,Jordan Boyd-Graber*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MIND方法，通过用户参与的事实核查流程检测多语言问答系统中的事实和文化差异，特别关注文化敏感问题在不同地区的回答差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言问答系统需要确保跨语言的事实一致性，同时考虑主观回答中的文化差异，特别是在文化敏感问题上。

Method: MIND是一个用户参与的事实核查流程，用于检测多语言问答知识库中的事实和文化差异，重点关注文化敏感问题的地区性差异。

Result: 在母婴健康领域的双语问答系统上评估MIND，并发布了标注事实和文化不一致的双语问题数据集。在其他领域数据集上的测试也显示MIND能可靠识别不一致性。

Conclusion: MIND能够可靠识别多语言问答系统中的不一致性，支持开发更具文化意识和事实一致性的问答系统。

Abstract: Multilingual question answering (QA) systems must ensure factual consistency
across languages, especially for objective queries such as What is jaundice?,
while also accounting for cultural variation in subjective responses. We
propose MIND, a user-in-the-loop fact-checking pipeline to detect factual and
cultural discrepancies in multilingual QA knowledge bases. MIND highlights
divergent answers to culturally sensitive questions (e.g., Who assists in
childbirth?) that vary by region and context. We evaluate MIND on a bilingual
QA system in the maternal and infant health domain and release a dataset of
bilingual questions annotated for factual and cultural inconsistencies. We
further test MIND on datasets from other domains to assess generalization. In
all cases, MIND reliably identifies inconsistencies, supporting the development
of more culturally aware and factually consistent QA systems.

### [6] [TopoAlign: A Framework for Aligning Code to Math via Topological Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11944)
*Yupei Li,Philipp Borchert,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TopoAlign是一个利用代码库训练数学大语言模型的框架，通过将代码分解并重组为结构上类似形式数学语句的模拟数据，显著提升了模型在自动形式化任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数学大语言模型在自动形式化任务上表现不佳，主要受限于大规模非形式化-形式化数学语句对数据集的稀缺，以及代码生成与形式数学之间的结构和语法差异。

Method: TopoAlign框架将代码分解为文档字符串、主函数和依赖函数，然后将这些组件重新组装成结构上与形式数学语句对齐的模拟数据，从而可以利用广泛可用的代码库作为训练资源。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Math模型上，TopoAlign使BEq@10性能提升17.77%，typecheck@10提升68.82%；在Herald模型上，BEq@10提升0.12%，typecheck@10提升1.09%，在minif2f、Putnam和ProofNet基准测试中均表现出色。

Conclusion: TopoAlign证明了即使不引入新的数学知识，通过结构对齐的代码数据进行训练也能显著提升数学大语言模型的自动形式化能力，为利用代码库资源提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4)
mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of
transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation
helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which
enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the
performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale
corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements.
Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language
instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal
mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a
framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources
for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and
dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that
structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code
data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human
annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and
evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign
provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77%
on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical
knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10
and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code
data is beneficial even for specialized models.

### [7] [GRAVITY: A Framework for Personalized Text Generation via Profile-Grounded Synthetic Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11952)
*Priyanka Dey,Daniele Rosa,Wenqing Zheng,Daniel Barcklow,Jieyu Zhao,Emilio Ferrara*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GRAVITY框架通过生成基于用户画像的合成偏好数据来减少对人工标注的依赖，整合人口统计、文化和心理框架来指导个性化内容生成，在跨文化场景中显著提升偏好得分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM个性化方法依赖昂贵的人工反馈或交互日志，限制了可扩展性且忽略了更深层的用户属性，需要减少对人工标注的依赖。

Method: 引入GRAVITY框架，整合Hofstede文化维度、Schwartz基本价值观、世界价值观调查和Big Five OCEAN人格特质等框架，生成基于用户画像的合成偏好数据对。

Result: 在400名亚马逊用户的书籍描述评估中，GRAVITY相比提示条件化、标准微调和朴素合成对生成方法，在跨文化场景（美国、巴西、日本、印度）中实现了超过4%的偏好增益，用户研究中86%的情况下更受偏好。

Conclusion: 基于场景的合成数据能够捕捉更丰富的用户差异，减少对昂贵标注的依赖，生成更具吸引力的用户中心内容，为LLM个性化提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Personalization in LLMs often relies on costly human feedback or interaction
logs, limiting scalability and neglecting deeper user attributes. To reduce the
reliance on human annotations, we introduce GRAVITY (Generative Response with
Aligned Values, Interests, and Traits of You), a framework for generating
synthetic, profile-grounded preference data that captures users' interests,
values, beliefs, and personality traits. By integrating demographic, cultural,
and psychological frameworks -- including Hofstede's cultural dimensions,
Schwartz's basic values, the World Values Survey, and Big Five OCEAN traits --
GRAVITY synthesizes preference pairs to guide personalized content generation.
We evaluate GRAVITY on book descriptions for 400 Amazon users, comparing it to
prompt-based conditioning, standard fine-tuning, and naive synthetic pair
generation. Profile-grounded synthetic data consistently improves generation,
especially across multiple cultures (USA, Brazil, Japan, India), achieving over
4% higher preference gains across baselines, with user studies showing that
GRAVITY outputs are preferred over 86% of the time. Our results show that
scenario-grounded synthetic data can capture richer user variation, reduce
reliance on costly annotation, and produce more engaging, user-centered
content, offering a scalable path for LLM personalization.

### [8] [Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems on Unanswerable, Uncheatable, Realistic, Multi-hop Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11956)
*Gabrielle Kaili-May Liu,Bryan Li,Arman Cohan,William Gantt Walden,Eugene Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CRUMQs（不可作弊、真实、不可回答、多跳查询）自动生成管道，用于创建更具挑战性的RAG基准测试，显著降低作弊可能性并提高任务复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG基准测试难以反映真实任务复杂度，多跳或超出范围的问题往往可以通过断开推理作弊解决，限制了发现现有RAG系统局限性的能力。

Method: 开发了首个自动、难度可控的CRUMQs生成管道，可适应任何语料库和领域，创建不可作弊、真实、不可回答和多跳查询。

Result: 在两个流行RAG数据集上创建CRUMQs，实验显示相比现有基准，CRUMQs对RAG系统极具挑战性，作弊分数降低达81.0%。

Conclusion: 该管道提供了一种简单方法来增强基准测试难度和真实性，推动开发更强大的RAG系统。

Abstract: Real-world use cases often present RAG systems with complex queries for which
relevant information is missing from the corpus or is incomplete. In these
settings, RAG systems must be able to reject unanswerable, out-of-scope queries
and identify failures of retrieval and multi-hop reasoning. Despite this,
existing RAG benchmarks rarely reflect realistic task complexity for multi-hop
or out-of-scope questions, which often can be cheated via disconnected
reasoning (i.e., solved without genuine multi-hop inference) or require only
simple factual recall. This limits the ability for such benchmarks to uncover
limitations of existing RAG systems. To address this gap, we present the first
pipeline for automatic, difficulty-controlled creation of
un$\underline{c}$heatable, $\underline{r}$ealistic, $\underline{u}$nanswerable,
and $\underline{m}$ulti-hop $\underline{q}$uerie$\underline{s}$ (CRUMQs),
adaptable to any corpus and domain. We use our pipeline to create CRUMQs over
two popular RAG datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness via benchmark
experiments on leading retrieval-augmented LLMs. Results show that compared to
prior RAG benchmarks, CRUMQs are highly challenging for RAG systems and achieve
up to 81.0\% reduction in cheatability scores. More broadly, our pipeline
offers a simple way to enhance benchmark difficulty and realism and drive
development of more capable RAG systems.

### [9] [Direct Multi-Token Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11958)
*Xuan Luo,Weizhi Wang,Xifeng Yan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种直接多令牌解码（DMTD）方法，通过在预训练LLM的后期层中同时生成多个令牌，无需重复遍历早期和中间层，实现了推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于预训练LLM中不同层次的分工特点：早期层处理输入理解，中间层处理任务特定处理，后期层负责输出生成。假设经过前两层处理后，隐藏状态已包含足够信息支持多令牌生成。

Method: 使用DMTD方法，在后期层中直接解码多个令牌，无需额外参数、辅助程序或后生成验证。对Qwen3-4B模型进行有限数据集的微调。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B模型上实现了最高2倍的加速，仅有轻微性能损失。缩放分析表明随着训练数据集增大，性能有望进一步提升。

Conclusion: DMTD是一种有效的推理加速方法，无需额外成本即可显著提升解码效率，具有很好的扩展潜力。

Abstract: Decoder-only transformers have become the standard architecture for large
language models (LLMs) due to their strong performance. Recent studies suggest
that, in pre-trained LLMs, early, middle, and late layers may serve distinct
roles: Early layers focus on understanding the input context, middle layers
handle task-specific processing, and late layers convert abstract
representations into output tokens. We hypothesize that once representations
have been processed by the early and middle layers, the resulting hidden states
may encapsulate sufficient information to support the generation of multiple
tokens using only the late layers, eliminating the need to repeatedly traverse
the early and middle layers. We refer to this inference paradigm as Direct
Multi-Token Decoding (DMTD). Unlike speculative decoding, our method introduces
no additional parameters, auxiliary routines, or post-generation verification.
Despite being trained on a limited dataset, a fine-tuned DMTD Qwen3-4B model
has already demonstrated promising results, achieving up to a 2x speedup with
only minor performance loss. Moreover, as shown in our scaling analysis, its
performance is expected to further improve with larger training datasets.

### [10] [Scaling Long-Horizon LLM Agent via Context-Folding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11967)
*Weiwei Sun,Miao Lu,Zhan Ling,Kang Liu,Xuesong Yao,Yiming Yang,Jiecao Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Context-Folding框架通过让LLM智能体主动管理工作上下文，在长程任务中实现10倍更小的活动上下文使用，同时保持或超越基准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型智能体在长程任务中受限于上下文长度约束，需要更有效的上下文管理方法。

Method: 开发了Context-Folding框架，允许智能体通过程序化分支处理子任务并在完成后折叠中间步骤，保留结果摘要；同时提出了端到端强化学习框架FoldGRPO，通过特定过程奖励鼓励有效的任务分解和上下文管理。

Result: 在复杂长程任务（Deep Research和SWE）上，折叠智能体匹配或超越ReAct基准，同时使用10倍更小的活动上下文，并显著优于依赖基于摘要的上下文管理模型。

Conclusion: Context-Folding框架为LLM智能体提供了有效的长程任务上下文管理解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅减少上下文使用。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents are fundamentally constrained by context
length on long-horizon tasks. We introduce Context-Folding, a framework that
empowers agents to actively manage their working context. An agent can
procedurally branch into a sub-trajectory to handle a subtask and then fold it
upon completion, collapsing the intermediate steps while retaining a concise
summary of the outcome. To make this behavior learnable, we develop an
end-to-end reinforcement learning framework FoldGRPO with specific process
rewards to encourage effective task decomposition and context management. On
complex long-horizon tasks (Deep Research and SWE), our folding agent matches
or outperforms the ReAct baselines while using an active context 10$\times$
smaller and significantly outperforms models that rely on summarization-based
context management.

### [11] [Conjecturing: An Overlooked Step in Formal Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11986)
*Jasivan Alex Sivakumar,Philipp Borchert,Ronald Cardenas,Gerasimos Lampouras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出自动形式化不应被视为直接翻译过程，而应包含推测结论的关键步骤。作者创建了ConjectureBench数据集和评估框架来专门衡量LLMs的推测能力，发现现有模型在考虑推测步骤时自动形式化性能被高估。他们提出了Lean-FIRe方法来改进推测和自动形式化，并首次成功实现了PutnamBench问题的端到端自动形式化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动形式化研究忽视了推测这一关键前置步骤，许多数学问题需要先推测结论才能进行形式化。由于LLMs在自动形式化方面已有困难，且推测能力的评估有限且常与自动形式化或证明任务纠缠，理解其影响具有挑战性。

Method: 1. 扩展现有数据集创建ConjectureBench；2. 重新设计评估框架和指标专门衡量LLMs的推测能力；3. 提出推理时方法Lean-FIRe来改进推测和自动形式化；4. 在GPT-4.1和DeepSeek-V3.1上进行评估。

Result: 1. 当在评估中考虑推测步骤时，LLMs的自动形式化性能被显著高估；2. Lean-FIRe方法首次成功实现了13个PutnamBench问题的端到端自动形式化（GPT-4.1）和7个（DeepSeek-V3.1）；3. LLMs具备生成准确推测所需的知识，但需要将推测作为独立任务处理。

Conclusion: 自动形式化性能的提升需要将推测作为独立任务处理，并研究如何正确将其整合到自动形式化流程中。论文为改进形式数学推理中被忽视的推测步骤提供了前瞻性指导。

Abstract: Autoformalisation, the task of expressing informal mathematical statements in
formal language, is often viewed as a direct translation process. This,
however, disregards a critical preceding step: conjecturing. Many mathematical
problems cannot be formalised directly without first conjecturing a conclusion
such as an explicit answer, or a specific bound. Since Large Language Models
(LLMs) already struggle with autoformalisation, and the evaluation of their
conjecturing ability is limited and often entangled within autoformalisation or
proof, it is particularly challenging to understand its effect. To address this
gap, we augment existing datasets to create ConjectureBench, and redesign the
evaluation framework and metric specifically to measure the conjecturing
capabilities of LLMs both as a distinct task and within the autoformalisation
pipeline. Our evaluation of foundational models, including GPT-4.1 and
DeepSeek-V3.1, reveals that their autoformalisation performance is
substantially overestimated when the conjecture is accounted for during
evaluation. However, the conjecture should not be assumed to be provided. We
design an inference-time method, Lean-FIRe to improve conjecturing and
autoformalisation, which, to the best of our knowledge, achieves the first
successful end-to-end autoformalisation of 13 PutnamBench problems with GPT-4.1
and 7 with DeepSeek-V3.1. We demonstrate that while LLMs possess the requisite
knowledge to generate accurate conjectures, improving autoformalisation
performance requires treating conjecturing as an independent task, and
investigating further how to correctly integrate it within autoformalisation.
Finally, we provide forward-looking guidance to steer future research toward
improving conjecturing, an overlooked step of formal mathematical reasoning.

*Ryan Shea,Yunan Lu,Liang Qiu,Zhou Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SAGE是一个用于多轮交互代理评估的用户模拟框架，通过整合业务上下文知识来生成更真实和多样化的交互，能发现更多代理错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模拟用户方法通常建模通用用户，忽视了捕捉真实行为所需的领域特定原则，需要更真实的评估方法。

Method: SAGE结合自上而下的业务逻辑知识（如理想客户画像）和自下而上的业务代理基础设施知识（如产品目录、FAQ、知识库），生成反映用户信息需求和期望的交互。

Result: 该方法产生的交互更真实和多样化，能识别多达33%的代理错误，支持错误发现和迭代改进。

Conclusion: SAGE是一个有效的评估工具，通过整合业务知识生成更真实的用户模拟，显著提升代理评估效果。

Abstract: Evaluating multi-turn interactive agents is challenging due to the need for
human assessment. Evaluation with simulated users has been introduced as an
alternative, however existing approaches typically model generic users and
overlook the domain-specific principles required to capture realistic behavior.
We propose SAGE, a novel user Simulation framework for multi-turn AGent
Evaluation that integrates knowledge from business contexts. SAGE incorporates
top-down knowledge rooted in business logic, such as ideal customer profiles,
grounding user behavior in realistic customer personas. We further integrate
bottom-up knowledge taken from business agent infrastructure (e.g., product
catalogs, FAQs, and knowledge bases), allowing the simulator to generate
interactions that reflect users' information needs and expectations in a
company's target market. Through empirical evaluation, we find that this
approach produces interactions that are more realistic and diverse, while also
identifying up to 33% more agent errors, highlighting its effectiveness as an
evaluation tool to support bug-finding and iterative agent improvement.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于离散数学逻辑等价问题的自动问题生成系统，通过形式化语言和线性时间算法生成难度均匀的问题，以解决学术不端和提供练习题目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线教学时代抄袭问题日益严重，需要为每个学生生成独特问题来防止作弊，同时提供大量练习题目。现有方法效率低且问题难度不一致。

Method: 使用形式化语言定义逻辑等价问题，将其转换为两组生成规则，并开发线性时间算法进行问题生成。

Result: 学生测试显示生成问题的准确性与教科书问题相当；问题解决步骤分析表明难度与教科书问题相似。

Conclusion: 该自动问题生成系统能够高效生成质量与教科书相当的逻辑等价问题，有效应对学术不端并提供练习资源。

Abstract: Academic dishonesty is met with zero tolerance in higher education, yet
plagiarism has become increasingly prevalent in the era of online teaching and
learning. Automatic Question Generation (AQG) presents a potential solution to
mitigate copying by creating unique questions for each student. Additionally,
AQG can provide a vast array of practice questions. Our AQG focuses on
generating logical equivalence questions for Discrete Mathematics, a
foundational course for first-year computer science students. A literature
review reveals that existing AQGs for this type of question generate all
propositions that meet user-defined constraints, resulting in inefficiencies
and a lack of uniform question difficulty. To address this, we propose a new
approach that defines logical equivalence questions using a formal language,
translates this language into two sets of generation rules, and develops a
linear-time algorithm for question generation. We evaluated our AQG through two
experiments. The first involved a group of students completing questions
generated by our system. Statistical analysis shows that the accuracy of these
questions is comparable to that of textbook questions. The second experiment
assessed the number of steps required to solve our generated questions,
textbook questions, and those generated by multiple large language models. The
results indicated that the difficulty of our questions was similar to that of
textbook questions, confirming the quality of our AQG.

TL;DR: 本文比较了神经符号系统和基于LLM的信息抽取系统在农业领域的表现，发现LLM系统在F1分数上表现更好（69.4 vs 52.7），但两种方法各有优缺点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前信息抽取领域过度依赖大型语言模型，忽视了传统符号或统计系统的经验积累。本文旨在比较神经符号方法和LLM方法在实际应用中的表现。

Method: 在农业领域的猪肉、乳制品和作物三个子领域，对九个访谈数据分别使用神经符号系统和LLM系统进行信息抽取评估。

Result: LLM系统在总体F1分数（69.4 vs 52.7）和核心信息F1分数（63.0 vs 47.2）上都优于神经符号系统。

Conclusion: 两种方法各有优劣：神经符号方法运行更快、控制性更强，但泛化能力差；LLM方法性能更高、部署更快，但运行较慢、控制有限且存在幻觉风险。需要在性能、效率和可控性之间找到平衡。

Abstract: The current trend in information extraction (IE) is to rely extensively on
large language models, effectively discarding decades of experience in building
symbolic or statistical IE systems. This paper compares a neuro-symbolic (NS)
and an LLM-based IE system in the agricultural domain, evaluating them on nine
interviews across pork, dairy, and crop subdomains. The LLM-based system
outperforms the NS one (F1 total: 69.4 vs. 52.7; core: 63.0 vs. 47.2), where
total includes all extracted information and core focuses on essential details.
However, each system has trade-offs: the NS approach offers faster runtime,
greater control, and high accuracy in context-free tasks but lacks
generalizability, struggles with contextual nuances, and requires significant
resources to develop and maintain. The LLM-based system achieves higher
performance, faster deployment, and easier maintenance but has slower runtime,
limited control, model dependency and hallucination risks. Our findings
highlight the "hidden cost" of deploying NLP systems in real-world
applications, emphasizing the need to balance performance, efficiency, and
control.

TL;DR: 提出了CPR框架，通过优化模糊提示来减少LLM幻觉，使用微调的小语言模型清理提示并生成额外任务描述，显著提高生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM经常生成看似合理但错误的幻觉事实，主要原因是用户使用结构不良或模糊的提示，导致模型基于假设而非实际意图生成响应。

Method: 引入CPR框架，包括：1）清理结构不良的提示；2）使用微调的小语言模型生成额外信息性任务描述，以对齐用户意图和提示。

Result: 应用CPR后，LLM的生成质量显著提高，同时有效减轻幻觉。实证研究表明，使用CPR的提示在无外部知识情况下，胜率超过90%。

Conclusion: CPR框架能有效解决因提示不当导致的LLM幻觉问题，提高模型生成质量，且无需外部知识即可实现显著改进。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) highlight their fluency
in generating responses to diverse prompts. However, these models sometimes
generate plausible yet incorrect ``hallucinated" facts, undermining trust. A
frequent but often overlooked cause of such errors is the use of poorly
structured or vague prompts by users, leading LLMs to base responses on assumed
rather than actual intentions. To mitigate hallucinations induced by these
ill-formed prompts, we introduce Curative Prompt Refinement (CPR), a
plug-and-play framework for curative prompt refinement that 1) cleans
ill-formed prompts, and 2) generates additional informative task descriptions
to align the intention of the user and the prompt using a fine-tuned small
language model. When applied to language models, we discover that CPR
significantly increases the quality of generation while also mitigating
hallucination. Empirical studies show that prompts with CPR applied achieves
over a 90\% win rate over the original prompts without any external knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言任务中表现出色，但幻觉问题仍然严重。格式错误的提示（包含歧义、语法错误或不完整信息）对幻觉的影响研究不足，需要系统化解决方案。

Method: MPR框架通过多阶段系统化改进提示：使用专门调优的小语言模型处理标点、拼写错误和关键词误用；迭代增强提示清晰度并添加上下文；采用带排名的自反思机制优先选择最相关输入。

Result: 在幻觉基准测试中，经MPR优化的提示相比原始形式胜率超过85%，有效减少幻觉并提高输出准确性。MPR还可与现有后处理幻觉缓解框架结合使用。

Conclusion: MPR提供了一个轻量级、适应性强的解决方案，可提升大语言模型在各领域的可靠性，通过优化输入提示从源头减少幻觉问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong
performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However,
LLMs continue to encounter challenges with hallucinations, where models
generate plausible but incorrect information. While several factors contribute
to hallucinations, the impact of ill-formed prompts, prompts with ambiguous
wording, incorrect grammar, or incomplete information, was relatively under
explored. To address this, we introduce Multi-stage Prompt Refinement (MPR), a
framework designed to systematically improve these ill-formed prompts across
multiple stages. Each stage addresses specific errors such as punctuation,
typographical mistakes, and misuse of key terms, using small language models
(SLMs) fine-tuned for these tasks. MPR iteratively enhances the clarity of
prompts with additional context and employs a self-reflection mechanism with
ranking to prioritize the most relevant input. Experimental results on
hallucination benchmarks show that prompts refined by MPR achieve over an 85~\%
win rate compared to their original forms, demonstrating its effectiveness in
reducing hallucinations and improving LLM output accuracy. Interestingly, we
reveal that MPR can be combined with existing post-hoc hallucination mitigation
frameworks, further enhancing its versatility. MPR provides a lightweight and
adaptable solution for enhancing LLM reliability across various domains.

Motivation: 大语言模型在现实应用中存在可靠性问题，容易产生看似合理但事实错误的幻觉输出，需要不确定性量化来评估模型生成的可信度。

Method: 从不确定性量化的基础定义出发，区分认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，系统分类现有方法并展示代表性方法的实证结果。

Conclusion: 本文为LLM不确定性量化在幻觉检测领域提供了清晰的现状图景，并指出了未来的研究方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the
landscape of natural language processing, enabling breakthroughs across a wide
range of areas including question answering, machine translation, and text
summarization. Yet, their deployment in real-world applications has raised
concerns over reliability and trustworthiness, as LLMs remain prone to
hallucinations that produce plausible but factually incorrect outputs.
Uncertainty quantification (UQ) has emerged as a central research direction to
address this issue, offering principled measures for assessing the
trustworthiness of model generations. We begin by introducing the foundations
of UQ, from its formal definition to the traditional distinction between
epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and then highlight how these concepts have
been adapted to the context of LLMs. Building on this, we examine the role of
UQ in hallucination detection, where quantifying uncertainty provides a
mechanism for identifying unreliable generations and improving reliability. We
systematically categorize a wide spectrum of existing methods along multiple
dimensions and present empirical results for several representative approaches.
Finally, we discuss current limitations and outline promising future research
directions, providing a clearer picture of the current landscape of LLM UQ for
hallucination detection.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理简单或模糊提示词时表现不佳，导致图像与文本对齐度、美学质量和整体效果不理想。

Method: 使用大语言模型作为提示词重写器，引入精心设计的奖励系统和迭代直接偏好优化训练流程，无需监督微调数据即可优化提示词。

Result: 在多种T2I模型和基准测试中，提示词重写器持续改善图像-文本对齐度、视觉质量和美学效果，优于强基线方法，并展现出良好的跨模型迁移性。

Conclusion: 提示词重写是一种有效、可扩展且实用的模型无关策略，能够显著提升文本到图像生成系统的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive
results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified
prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality.
We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models
(LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our
approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct
preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to
enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our
method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt
rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and
aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong
transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone
generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also
systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with
the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight
that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic
strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained
prompt rewriters soon.

*Yukun Zhang,Qi Dong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出分层对齐方法，针对Transformer架构中不同功能层（局部语法层、中间逻辑层、全局事实层）进行定向DPO优化，相比传统统一优化方法，在保持语法流畅性的同时显著提升事实一致性和逻辑连贯性，且避免了传统DPO中的"对齐税"问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐技术（如DPO）将模型视为单一实体进行统一优化，忽视了Transformer架构中不同层次的功能专业化（从语法处理到抽象推理）。这种一刀切的方法限制了优化效果。

Method: 提出分层对齐方法，使用LoRA进行精准微调，对模型的不同功能块应用定向DPO：局部层（语法）、中间层（逻辑）、全局层（事实性）。在Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen1.5-7B等先进模型上进行实验验证。

Result: 局部层对齐显著提升语法流畅性；全局层对齐不仅改善事实一致性，还是提升逻辑连贯性的最有效策略，优于所有基线方法；所有分层策略都成功避免了标准DPO中出现的"对齐税"问题。

Conclusion: 分层对齐方法为模型对齐提供了更资源高效、可控且可解释的路径，展示了从统一优化转向结构感知精准微调的巨大潜力，有助于构建更先进可靠的LLMs。

Abstract: Existing alignment techniques for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), typically treat the model as a monolithic
entity, applying uniform optimization pressure across all layers. This approach
overlooks the functional specialization within the Transformer architecture,
where different layers are known to handle distinct tasks from syntax to
abstract reasoning. In this paper, we challenge this one-size-fits-all paradigm
by introducing Hierarchical Alignment, a novel method that applies targeted DPO
to distinct functional blocks of a model's layers: local (syntax), intermediate
(logic), and global (factuality). Through a series of controlled experiments on
state-of-the-art models like Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen1.5-7B using LoRA for
surgical fine-tuning, our results, evaluated by a powerful LLM-as-Judge,
demonstrate significant and predictable improvements. Specifically, aligning
the local layers (Local-Align) enhances grammatical fluency. More importantly,
aligning the global layers (Global-Align) not only improves factual consistency
as hypothesized but also proves to be the most effective strategy for enhancing
logical coherence, outperforming all baselines. Critically, all hierarchical
strategies successfully avoid the "alignment tax" observed in standard DPO,
where gains in fluency come at the cost of degraded logical reasoning. These
findings establish a more resource-efficient, controllable, and interpretable
path for model alignment, highlighting the immense potential of shifting from
monolithic optimization to structure-aware surgical fine-tuning to build more
advanced and reliable LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: APCE提出了一种上下文感知的输入块选择方法，通过低维语义相似度匹配来筛选最重要的输入块，在长文本摘要任务中仅使用50%-70%的输入序列就能达到或优于完整输入的摘要性能，同时显著降低KV缓存和自注意力的内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长上下文Transformer模型的两个关键挑战：(1) 随着序列长度增加，二次自注意力和线性KV缓存导致内存占用增长；(2) ContextRot现象，即Transformer架构性能随上下文长度增加而下降。通过选择最重要的输入块来协同减少内存占用并缓解ContextRot效应。

Method: 提出APCE方法，通过低维语义相似度匹配当前查询来选择最重要的输入块。该方法直接在输入上操作，不依赖于底层硬件或CUDA环境，为不同部署系统提供兼容的可扩展解决方案。

Result: 实证评估显示，APCE在长文本摘要任务中仅使用50%-70%的输入序列就能达到或优于完整密集基线的摘要性能，同时显著提高了KV缓存和自注意力的内存效率。

Conclusion: APCE为长上下文Transformer模型提供了一种有效的上下文感知效率解决方案，希望这一发现能激发针对其他相关长上下文任务的进一步研究。

Abstract: Deploying useful Long-Context Transformer Models (LCTMs) requires addressing
two key challenges: (1) A growing memory footprint due to quadratic
self-attention and linear KV-cache scaling in memory as sequence length
increases; (2) the ContextRot phenomena where empirical evidence suggests that
transformer architecture's performance degrades with increasing context length.
Given the shared dependency on the input, a natural question arises: Can we
surgically select the most important input chunks for processing to
synergistically (a) reduce the memory footprint, and (b) mitigate the
ContextRot effects? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative
for long-context summarization tasks. We propose APCE as a context-aware
solution to select the most important input chunks through low-dimensional
semantic similarity matching with the current query. By directly operating on
the input, APCE decouples from strict dependency on underlying hardware or CUDA
environments, promising a compatible solution scalable to different deployment
systems. Our empirical evaluations have demonstrated superior or on-par
summarization performance for APCE compared to the full dense baseline using a
fraction (50%-70%) of the input sequence resulting in KV-cache and
self-attention memory efficiency improvements. We hope our findings inspire
further research on context-aware efficiency solutions for LCTMs geared towards
other relevant long-context tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理精神健康紧急情况时经常提供有害或不适当的建议，需要有效的安全过滤器来防止破坏性行为。

Method: 在两个数据集上评估VBHSF性能：Verily精神健康危机数据集(1,800条模拟消息)和NVIDIA Aegis AI内容安全数据集子集(794条精神健康相关消息)，并与NVIDIA NeMo和OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest进行对比分析。

Result: VBHSF在Verily数据集上敏感度0.990、特异性0.992、F1分数0.939；在NVIDIA数据集上敏感度0.982、准确率0.921、特异性0.859。在所有情况下都显著优于对比系统(p < 0.001)。

Conclusion: VBHSF表现出稳健、可推广的性能，优先考虑敏感性以最小化遗漏危机，这是医疗应用的关键特性。

Abstract: Large language models often mishandle psychiatric emergencies, offering
harmful or inappropriate advice and enabling destructive behaviors. This study
evaluated the Verily behavioral health safety filter (VBHSF) on two datasets:
the Verily Mental Health Crisis Dataset containing 1,800 simulated messages and
the NVIDIA Aegis AI Content Safety Dataset subsetted to 794 mental
health-related messages. The two datasets were clinician-labelled and we
evaluated performance using the clinician labels. Additionally, we carried out
comparative performance analyses against two open source, content moderation
guardrails: OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest and NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails. The VBHSF
demonstrated, well-balanced performance on the Verily Mental Health Crisis
Dataset v1.0, achieving high sensitivity (0.990) and specificity (0.992) in
detecting any mental health crises. It achieved an F1-score of 0.939,
sensitivity ranged from 0.917-0.992, and specificity was >= 0.978 in
identifying specific crisis categories. When evaluated against the NVIDIA Aegis
AI Content Safety Dataset 2.0, VBHSF performance remained highly sensitive
(0.982) and accuracy (0.921) with reduced specificity (0.859). When compared
with the NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest guardrails, the VBHSF
demonstrated superior performance metrics across both datasets, achieving
significantly higher sensitivity in all cases (all p < 0.001) and higher
specificity relative to NVIDIA NeMo (p < 0.001), but not to OpenAI Omni
Moderation Latest (p = 0.094). NVIDIA NeMo and OpenAI Omni Moderation Latest
exhibited inconsistent performance across specific crisis types, with
sensitivity for some categories falling below 0.10. Overall, the VBHSF
demonstrated robust, generalizable performance that prioritizes sensitivity to
minimize missed crises, a crucial feature for healthcare applications.

Result: PACE与Chatbot Arena创造力排名强相关(ρ=0.739)，高性能LLM接近普通人水平，专业人士优于LLM，人类关联模式更多样化。

Conclusion: PACE是有效的创造力评估方法，LLM创造力接近普通人但仍有差距，人类关联更具多样性。

Abstract: The evaluation of LLMs' creativity represents a crucial research domain,
though challenges such as data contamination and costly human assessments often
impede progress. Drawing inspiration from human creativity assessment, we
propose PACE, asking LLMs to generate Parallel Association Chains to Evaluate
their creativity. PACE minimizes the risk of data contamination and offers a
straightforward, highly efficient evaluation, as evidenced by its strong
correlation with Chatbot Arena Creative Writing rankings (Spearman's $\rho =
0.739$, $p < 0.001$) across various proprietary and open-source models. A
comparative analysis of associative creativity between LLMs and humans reveals
that while high-performing LLMs achieve scores comparable to average human
performance, professional humans consistently outperform LLMs. Furthermore,
linguistic analysis reveals that both humans and LLMs exhibit a trend of
decreasing concreteness in their associations, and humans demonstrating a
greater diversity of associative patterns.

Abstract: Multilingual domain adaptation (ML-DA) is widely used to learn new domain
knowledge across languages into large language models (LLMs). Although many
methods have been proposed to improve domain adaptation, the mechanisms of
multilingual knowledge acquisition, how domain knowledge is learned within a
language and transferred across languages, remain underexplored. This gap leads
to suboptimal performance, particularly in low-resource settings. This work
examines the learning dynamics of LLMs during ML-DA. Because prior ML-DA
studies often train and evaluate on datasets with mismatched knowledge
coverage, we propose AdaXEval, an adaptive evaluation method that builds
multiple-choice QA datasets from the same bilingual domain corpus used for
training, thereby directly studying multilingual knowledge acquisition. Through
continual training of LLMs with diverse data recipes, we track how LLMs acquire
domain facts and pinpoint the mechanism behind the transformation process from
domain training data to knowledge. Our experiments on a 13B English-Japanese
bilingual LLM reveal that cross-lingual transfer remains challenging despite a
high-quality bilingual corpus. The code has been released.

Motivation: 大型语音语言模型在对话生成方面表现出色，但在语义理解基准测试中始终不如传统流水线系统。本文旨在揭示语音和文本输入之间的性能差距（模态差距）及其成因。

Method: 通过系统实验分析语音和文本表征的粗粒度和细粒度对齐情况，引入对齐路径评分量化词级对齐质量，并设计角度投影和长度归一化等干预策略。

Result: 发现深层表征中语音和文本在方向（余弦相似度）上越来越对齐，但在幅度（欧氏距离）上却不断发散；表征相似度与模态差距强相关；词级对齐模式与模态差距密切相关。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统分析了LSLMs中的模态差距和对齐机制，为未来优化提供了理论和方法的指导，提出的干预策略展示了改善语音输入正确性的潜力。

Abstract: End-to-end Large Speech Language Models (LSLMs) have demonstrated impressive
conversational generation abilities, yet consistently fall short of traditional
pipeline systems on semantic understanding benchmarks. In this work, we reveal
through systematic experimentation that although LSLMs lose some text input
performance after speech-text alignment training, the performance gap between
speech and text inputs is more pronounced, which we refer to as the modality
gap. To understand this gap, we analyze both coarse- and fine-grained text and
speech representations. At the coarse-grained level, representations of speech
and text in deeper layers are found to be increasingly aligned in direction
(cosine similarity), while concurrently diverging in magnitude (Euclidean
distance). We further find that representation similarity is strongly
correlated with the modality gap. At the fine-grained level, a spontaneous
token-level alignment pattern between text and speech representations is
observed. Based on this, we introduce the Alignment Path Score to quantify
token-level alignment quality, which exhibits stronger correlation with the
modality gap. Building on these insights, we design targeted interventions on
critical tokens through angle projection and length normalization. These
strategies demonstrate the potential to improve correctness for speech inputs.
Our study provides the first systematic empirical analysis of the modality gap
and alignment mechanisms in LSLMs, offering both theoretical and methodological
guidance for future optimization.

Motivation: 多轮对话在日常交互中更常见，但现有基准测试未充分考虑这种情况下的安全风险，需要专门评估MLLMs在多轮对话中的安全性。

Method: 构建包含10,000个样本的SafeMT基准测试，涵盖17种场景和4种越狱方法；提出安全指数(SI)评估模型安全性；设计对话安全调节器检测对话中的恶意意图。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型在多轮对话中的安全机制存在不足，需要专门的安全防护措施来应对对话中隐藏的恶意意图。

Abstract: With the widespread use of multi-modal Large Language models (MLLMs), safety
issues have become a growing concern. Multi-turn dialogues, which are more
common in everyday interactions, pose a greater risk than single prompts;
however, existing benchmarks do not adequately consider this situation. To
encourage the community to focus on the safety issues of these models in
multi-turn dialogues, we introduce SafeMT, a benchmark that features dialogues
of varying lengths generated from harmful queries accompanied by images. This
benchmark consists of 10,000 samples in total, encompassing 17 different
scenarios and four jailbreak methods. Additionally, we propose Safety Index
(SI) to evaluate the general safety of MLLMs during conversations. We assess
the safety of 17 models using this benchmark and discover that the risk of
successful attacks on these models increases as the number of turns in harmful
dialogues rises. This observation indicates that the safety mechanisms of these
models are inadequate for recognizing the hazard in dialogue interactions. We
propose a dialogue safety moderator capable of detecting malicious intent
concealed within conversations and providing MLLMs with relevant safety
policies. Experimental results from several open-source models indicate that
this moderator is more effective in reducing multi-turn ASR compared to existed
guard models.

confident assertions. We argue this stems from the Transformer's Softmax
function, which creates "Artificial Certainty" by collapsing ambiguous
attention scores into a single probability distribution, discarding uncertainty
information at each layer. To fix this, we introduce the Credal Transformer,
which replaces standard attention with a Credal Attention Mechanism (CAM) based
on evidential theory. CAM produces a "credal set" (a set of distributions)
instead of a single attention vector, with the set's size directly measuring
model uncertainty. We implement this by re-conceptualizing attention scores as
evidence masses for a Dirichlet distribution: sufficient evidence recovers
standard attention, while insufficient evidence yields a diffuse distribution,
representing ambiguity. Empirically, the Credal Transformer identifies
out-of-distribution inputs, quantifies ambiguity, and significantly reduces
confident errors on unanswerable questions by abstaining. Our contribution is a
new architecture to mitigate hallucinations and a design paradigm that
integrates uncertainty quantification directly into the model, providing a
foundation for more reliable AI.

Abstract: With the increasing capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), parallel
reasoning has emerged as a new inference paradigm that enhances reasoning
robustness by concurrently exploring multiple lines of thought before
converging on a final answer. It has become a significant trend to explore
parallel reasoning to overcome the fragility of standard sequential methods and
improve practical performance. In this paper, we aim to survey and summarize
the progress and challenges of parallel reasoning. We first present a formal
definition of parallel reasoning and clarify its distinction from related
concepts like Chain-of-Thought. Then, we organize and discuss advanced
techniques based on a novel taxonomy, including non-interactive reasoning,
interactive reasoning, and efficiency-focused decoding strategies.
Additionally, we explore various application scenarios, such as solving complex
problems and enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.Finally, we highlight the
core challenges of parallel reasoning and suggest potential directions for
future research. We hope that our work can provide a useful roadmap for
beginners and encourage more research on improving parallel reasoning methods.

TL;DR: 本文研究了将离散推理空间中的多样本生成和奖励模型重排序技术应用于连续推理空间的可行性，发现虽然能生成多样推理路径，但奖励模型在连续空间中难以有效区分正确和错误推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索已证明在离散推理空间有效的推理时扩展技术（多样本生成+奖励模型重排序）是否能够成功适应连续推理空间。

Method: 使用COCONUT连续推理LM作为骨干，通过dropout采样生成多样推理路径，分析Pass@N性能，并研究连续空间中PRM和ORM模型的训练效果。

Result: 多样本生成在连续空间可行，但PRM和ORM模型仅带来边际改进，原因是连续思维表示缺乏关键归纳偏置，难以有效区分正确和错误推理。

Conclusion: 连续推理LM的训练框架不仅需要优化准确性，还应明确纳入可在推理时用于区分正确和错误思维的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Inference-time scaling through multiple sample generation in combination with
Process- or Outcome-Reward Model (PRM or ORM) re-ranking has proven effective
for text-based reasoning in large language models. This paper investigates
whether such established techniques can be successfully adapted to reasoning in
the continuous space, using COCONUT (Hao et al. 2024) continuous space
reasoning LM as the backbone. We demonstrate the feasibility of generating
diverse reasoning paths through dropout-based sampling. Our Pass@N analysis on
the generated samples reveals the potential that could enable a significant
gain in performance akin to observed gain in the discrete space. However, we
highlight unique challenges faced for materializing this gain in the continuous
thought space. In particular, working recipes for data generation and training
PRM and ORM models in the discrete space unlocks only marginal improvements in
the continuous space. Through probing various aspects including geometric
properties and trajectory dynamics we identify the underlying reasons that
prevent effective discrimination between correct and incorrect reasoning
(essential for the functioning of PRM and ORM). Our findings reveal that
current limitations stem from the absence of key inductive biases in continuous
thought representations. We argue that the training frameworks for continuous
reasoning LMs require not only to optimize for accuracy but also to explicitly
incorporate inductive biases that could be utilized during inference-time for
discrimination of correct and incorrect thoughts.\footnote{Our code and data
will be publicly available.}

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了真实实验室中的常识性生物医学概念知识，如某些药物与特定治疗根本不相容的机制先验知识。

Method: 从大语言模型提取语义丰富的治疗相关文本表示，用于微调知识图谱嵌入模型，将治疗相关知识注入KGE。

Conclusion: LLaDR通过注入治疗相关知识显著改善了生物医学概念的表示，增强了对研究不足或复杂适应症的语义理解。

Abstract: Drug repurposing plays a critical role in accelerating treatment discovery,
especially for complex and rare diseases. Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs),
which encode rich clinical associations, have been widely adopted to support
this task. However, existing methods largely overlook common-sense biomedical
concept knowledge in real-world labs, such as mechanistic priors indicating
that certain drugs are fundamentally incompatible with specific treatments. To
address this gap, we propose LLaDR, a Large Language Model-assisted framework
for Drug Repurposing, which improves the representation of biomedical concepts
within KGs. Specifically, we extract semantically enriched treatment-related
textual representations of biomedical entities from large language models
(LLMs) and use them to fine-tune knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models. By
injecting treatment-relevant knowledge into KGE, LLaDR largely improves the
representation of biomedical concepts, enhancing semantic understanding of
under-studied or complex indications. Experiments based on benchmarks
demonstrate that LLaDR achieves state-of-the-art performance across different
scenarios, with case studies on Alzheimer's disease further confirming its
robustness and effectiveness. Code is available at

TL;DR: 研究发现大型音频语言模型在时间戳预测中存在系统性时间偏差，表现为预测时间与真实时间持续偏移，且偏差随音频长度增加而累积。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频语言模型在音频理解和多模态推理中应用日益广泛，但其定位事件发生时间的能力尚未得到充分研究，需要系统性地探索其时间偏差问题。

Method: 通过在带时间戳的数据集上进行控制实验，提出时间偏差指数(TBI)来量化预测事件时间的系统性错位，并辅以可视化框架进行分析。

Result: 研究发现时间偏差在数据集和模型间普遍存在，随音频长度增加而增大（在长录音中可累积至数十秒），且在不同事件类型和位置间存在差异。

Conclusion: 当前大型音频语言模型存在根本性限制，需要开发具有时间鲁棒性的架构来解决时间偏差问题。

Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs) are increasingly applied to audio
understanding and multimodal reasoning, yet their ability to locate when events
occur remains underexplored. We present the first systematic study of temporal
bias in LALMs, revealing a key limitation in their timestamp prediction. For
example, when asked "At which second does the lecturer introduce the key
formula?", models often predict timestamps that are consistently earlier or
later than the ground truth. Through controlled experiments on timestamped
datasets, we find that temporal bias (i) is prevalent across datasets and
models, (ii) increases with audio length - even accumulating to tens of seconds
in extended recordings, and (iii) varies across event types and positions. We
quantify this effect with the Temporal Bias Index (TBI), measuring systematic
misalignment in predicted event timings, and complement it with a visualization
framework. Our findings highlight a fundamental limitation in current LALMs and
call for the development of temporally robust architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割模型虽然比启发式方法更鲁棒，但仍受限于监督学习目标，缺乏人类偏好对齐，而这对实时自然翻译至关重要

Method: 使用直接偏好优化训练大语言模型进行分割预测，利用SeamlessM4T v2作为翻译骨干，在ACL 60/60语料库上评估

Result: 在英语-日语、中文、德语三个语言对上，DPO调优的LLM比SHAS获得更高的分割准确率，翻译质量和延迟也一致改善

Conclusion: 偏好调优的LLM有潜力超越现有预训练分割模型，推动自适应、人类对齐的同步口译发展

Abstract: Simultaneous speech translation requires accurate segmentation to balance
translation quality and latency. Recent studies such as SHAS have introduced
pretrained segmentation models, achieving stronger performance than heuristic
rules. However, segmentation models such as SHAS, though pretrained and more
robust than heuristic methods, are still constrained by supervised learning
objectives and do not incorporate human preference alignment, which is crucial
for natural real-time interpretation. In this work, we propose a segmentation
framework based on large language models (LLMs) trained with Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO). By leveraging preference alignment, our method enables LLMs
to predict natural segmentation points that better meet the demands of
real-time translation. We evaluate the system on the ACL 60/60 corpus across
three language pairs (English-Japanese, Chinese, German), using SeamlessM4T v2
as the translation backbone. Experimental results show that our DPO-tuned LLM
achieves higher segmentation accuracy than SHAS and yields consistent
improvements in translation quality (BLEU, COMET) as well as latency (Average
Lagging). Furthermore, our system benefits from IWSLT baselines for direct
comparison. These findings highlight the potential of preference-tuned LLMs to
surpass existing pretrained segmentation models and advance adaptive,
human-aligned simultaneous interpretation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: HALF框架通过考虑实际应用场景和危害严重性来评估LLM的公平性，填补了现有评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM公平性评估缺乏真实场景基础，且未考虑不同领域危害严重性的差异，需要更贴近实际部署的评估框架。

Method: 提出HALF框架，将9个应用领域分为三个严重等级（严重、中等、轻度），使用五阶段流程评估模型偏见并加权危害严重性。

Result: 评估8个LLM发现：(1)LLM在不同领域公平性不一致；(2)模型大小或性能不保证公平性；(3)推理模型在医疗决策支持表现更好但在教育领域更差。

Conclusion: HALF揭示了先前基准测试成功与实际部署准备度之间的明显差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across high-impact
domains, from clinical decision support and legal analysis to hiring and
education, making fairness and bias evaluation before deployment critical.
However, existing evaluations lack grounding in real-world scenarios and do not
account for differences in harm severity, e.g., a biased decision in surgery
should not be weighed the same as a stylistic bias in text summarization. To
address this gap, we introduce HALF (Harm-Aware LLM Fairness), a
deployment-aligned framework that assesses model bias in realistic applications
and weighs the outcomes by harm severity. HALF organizes nine application
domains into three tiers (Severe, Moderate, Mild) using a five-stage pipeline.
Our evaluation results across eight LLMs show that (1) LLMs are not
consistently fair across domains, (2) model size or performance do not
guarantee fairness, and (3) reasoning models perform better in medical decision
support but worse in education. We conclude that HALF exposes a clear gap
between previous benchmarking success and deployment readiness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLMs如何内化人类偏见，特别是Knobe效应这种道德偏见在意图判断中的表现机制。

Method: 在3个开源权重LLMs上进行层修补分析，识别偏见所在的特定层，并用预训练模型的激活替换这些层。

Result: 偏见确实在微调过程中被学习，并集中在特定层；仅替换少数关键层的激活就能消除Knobe效应。

Conclusion: LLMs中的社会偏见可以被解释、定位和缓解，无需重新训练模型，为偏见干预提供了新方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to internalize human-like biases
during finetuning, yet the mechanisms by which these biases manifest remain
unclear. In this work, we investigated whether the well-known Knobe effect, a
moral bias in intentionality judgements, emerges in finetuned LLMs and whether
it can be traced back to specific components of the model. We conducted a
Layer-Patching analysis across 3 open-weights LLMs and demonstrated that the
bias is not only learned during finetuning but also localized in a specific set
of layers. Surprisingly, we found that patching activations from the
corresponding pretrained model into just a few critical layers is sufficient to
eliminate the effect. Our findings offer new evidence that social biases in
LLMs can be interpreted, localized, and mitigated through targeted
interventions, without the need for model retraining.

TL;DR: 提出DSAS方法解决LLMs在多文档问答中的长距离依赖建模和"中间迷失"问题，通过CGW和RAS两个模块实现无需修改架构的即插即用解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在多文档问答任务中存在两个主要限制：长距离依赖建模困难，以及"中间迷失"问题（难以处理长输入中间的信息）。现有解决方案要么截断全局依赖，要么需要昂贵的微调。

Method: 提出双阶段自适应锐化(DSAS)方法，包含两个模块：1) 上下文门控加权(CGW)模块通过层级注意力追踪和位置感知加权评估段落相关性；2) 互斥注意力抑制(RAS)模块通过抑制关键文本与无关文本之间的信息交换来增强对关键段落的关注。

Result: 在四个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，DSAS在主流LLMs（Llama、Qwen、Mistral、Deepseek）上均有效，在Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct上多文档问答任务的F1分数平均提升4.2%。

Conclusion: DSAS作为一个即插即用的解决方案，无需架构修改或额外训练参数，有效解决了LLMs在多文档问答中的核心挑战，并通过消融研究验证了两个模块的必要贡献。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) show considerable promise across various
fields, they have notable limitations in handling multi-document question
answering (Multi-doc QA) tasks. The first challenge is long-range dependency
modeling, where LLMs struggle to focus on key information in long texts, which
weakens important semantic connections. Second, most LLMs suffer from the
''lost-in-the-middle'' issue, where they have difficulty processing information
in the middle of long inputs. Current solutions either truncate global
dependencies or demand costly finetuning, ultimately lacking a universal and
simple solution for these challenges. To resolve these limitations, we propose
Dual-Stage Adaptive Sharpening (DSAS) containing two modules. (i) The
Contextual Gate Weighting (CGW) module alleviates ''lost-in-the-middle'' by
assessing paragraph relevance through layer-wise attention tracking and
position-aware weighting. (ii) The Reciprocal Attention Suppression (RAS)
module enhances focus on critical paragraphs by suppressing information
exchange between key and irrelevant texts, thus mitigating the limitations in
long-range dependency modeling. Notably, DSAS functions as a plug-and-play
solution requiring no architectural modifications or extra training parameters.
Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate DSAS's efficacy across
mainstream LLMs (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, and Deepseek), with an average F1-score
improvement of 4.2% in Multi-doc QA tasks on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct. Ablation studies confirm the essential contributions of
both the CGW and RAS modules. In addition, detailed discussions in the Appendix
further validate the robustness and scalability of DSAS.

TL;DR: 提出了MedQA-Followup框架，用于系统评估医学问答中的多轮对话鲁棒性，发现LLMs在单轮问答表现良好，但在多轮对话中准确性显著下降，特别是面对间接上下文干预时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs评估主要关注单轮理想条件下的问答，忽视了医疗咨询中常见的冲突输入、误导性上下文和权威影响等复杂多轮交互场景，需要系统评估LLMs在多轮对话中的鲁棒性。

Method: 基于MedQA数据集构建MedQA-Followup框架，区分浅层鲁棒性（抵抗误导初始上下文）和深层鲁棒性（在多轮挑战中保持准确性），并引入间接-直接轴分离上下文框架和明确建议。

Result: 评估5个最先进LLMs发现：模型在浅层扰动下表现良好，但在多轮设置中表现出严重脆弱性，Claude Sonnet 4的准确性从91.2%降至13.5%；间接上下文干预比直接建议更具破坏性。

Conclusion: 多轮鲁棒性是医疗LLMs安全可靠部署的关键但未被充分探索的维度，间接上下文干预暴露了临床部署的重大脆弱性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly transitioning into medical clinical
use, yet their reliability under realistic, multi-turn interactions remains
poorly understood. Existing evaluation frameworks typically assess single-turn
question answering under idealized conditions, overlooking the complexities of
medical consultations where conflicting input, misleading context, and
authority influence are common. We introduce MedQA-Followup, a framework for
systematically evaluating multi-turn robustness in medical question answering.
Our approach distinguishes between shallow robustness (resisting misleading
initial context) and deep robustness (maintaining accuracy when answers are
challenged across turns), while also introducing an indirect-direct axis that
separates contextual framing (indirect) from explicit suggestion (direct).
Using controlled interventions on the MedQA dataset, we evaluate five
state-of-the-art LLMs and find that while models perform reasonably well under
shallow perturbations, they exhibit severe vulnerabilities in multi-turn
settings, with accuracy dropping from 91.2% to as low as 13.5% for Claude
Sonnet 4. Counterintuitively, indirect, context-based interventions are often
more harmful than direct suggestions, yielding larger accuracy drops across
models and exposing a significant vulnerability for clinical deployment.
Further compounding analyses reveal model differences, with some showing
additional performance drops under repeated interventions while others
partially recovering or even improving. These findings highlight multi-turn
robustness as a critical but underexplored dimension for safe and reliable
deployment of medical LLMs.

TL;DR: Chinese ModernBERT是一个从头开始训练的中文编码器，通过优化词汇表、掩码策略、预训练流程和学习率调度，在中文NLP任务上实现了性能提升和效率优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的编码器Transformers在架构、数据和系统方面的改进未能完全迁移到中文领域，因为中文的分词和形态结构与英文存在显著差异。

Method: 采用硬件感知的32k BPE词汇表、动态全词掩码策略、两阶段预训练流程（扩展上下文长度）和阻尼余弦学习率调度。

Result: 在CLUE基准测试中与强中文编码器竞争，在SimCLUE上通过额外对比数据达到0.505/0.537的相关系数，超越Qwen-0.6B-embedding。

Conclusion: Chinese ModernBERT展示了在中文NLP任务上的有效性和可扩展性，为语义文本相似度任务提供了清晰的扩展路径。

Abstract: Encoder-only Transformers have advanced along three axes -- architecture,
data, and systems -- yielding Pareto gains in accuracy, speed, and memory
efficiency. Yet these improvements have not fully transferred to Chinese, where
tokenization and morphology differ markedly from English. We introduce Chinese
ModernBERT, a from-scratch Chinese encoder that couples: (i) a hardware-aware
32k BPE vocabulary tailored to frequent Chinese affixes/compounds, lowering the
embedding budget; (ii) whole-word masking (WWM) with a dynamic masking
curriculum (30% -> 15%) to align task difficulty with training progress; (iii)
a two-stage pre-training pipeline that extends the native context from 1,024 to
8,192 tokens using RoPE and alternating local/global attention; and (iv) a
damped-cosine learning-rate schedule for stable long-horizon optimization. We
pre-train on ~1.2T Chinese tokens from CCI3-HQ, CCI4 (Chinese), and
Cosmopedia-Chinese. On CLUE, Chinese ModernBERT is competitive with strong
Chinese encoders under a unified fine-tuning protocol. Under bf16 it achieves
high long-sequence throughput while maintaining strong short-sequence speed,
reflecting benefits from budget allocation and attention design. To probe
retrieval-oriented quality, we add a small amount of open contrastive data:
fine-tuning on SimCLUE (~3M pairs) improves further when adding T2Ranking
(~2M), reaching 0.505 (Pearson) / 0.537 (Spearman) on the SimCLUE test set.
Under this open-data setting, Chinese ModernBERT surpasses Qwen-0.6B-embedding
on SimCLUE, suggesting a clear scaling path for STS with additional curated
pairs. We will release tokenizer and weights to facilitate reproducible
research.

Conclusion: LLM能够以最小人工干预大规模执行数据准备任务，为基于语料库的研究开辟新可能，但需注意成本、许可和伦理问题

Abstract: As natural language corpora expand at an unprecedented rate, manual
annotation remains a significant methodological bottleneck in corpus linguistic
work. We address this challenge by presenting a scalable, unsupervised pipeline
for automating grammatical annotation in voluminous corpora using large
language models (LLMs). Unlike previous supervised and iterative approaches,
our method employs a four-phase workflow: prompt engineering, pre-hoc
evaluation, automated batch processing, and post-hoc validation. We demonstrate
the pipeline's accessibility and effectiveness through a diachronic case study
of variation in the English consider construction. Using GPT-5 through the
OpenAI API, we annotate 143,933 sentences from the Corpus of Historical
American English (COHA) in under 60 hours, achieving 98%+ accuracy on two
sophisticated annotation procedures. Our results suggest that LLMs can perform
a range of data preparation tasks at scale with minimal human intervention,
opening new possibilities for corpus-based research, though implementation
requires attention to costs, licensing, and other ethical considerations.

Motivation: 现有反言论生成方法存在可靠性不足和可扩展性差的问题，要么依赖不可靠的LLM生成，要么依赖NGO专家但难以扩展。

Method: 将反言论生成建模为知识驱动的文本生成过程，构建包含32,792个文本的知识库，集成先进的RAG管道来确保生成内容的可信度。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究可信和合理的反言论生成开辟了新途径，可应用于仇恨言论及其他领域。

Abstract: Counter-speech generation is at the core of many expert activities, such as
fact-checking and hate speech, to counter harmful content. Yet, existing work
treats counter-speech generation as pure text generation task, mainly based on
Large Language Models or NGO experts. These approaches show severe drawbacks
due to the limited reliability and coherence in the generated countering text,
and in scalability, respectively. To close this gap, we introduce a novel
framework to model counter-speech generation as knowledge-wise text generation
process. Our framework integrates advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipelines to ensure the generation of trustworthy counter-speech for 8 main
target groups identified in the hate speech literature, including women, people
of colour, persons with disabilities, migrants, Muslims, Jews, LGBT persons,
and other. We built a knowledge base over the United Nations Digital Library,
EUR-Lex and the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, comprising a total of 32,792
texts. We use the MultiTarget-CONAN dataset to empirically assess the quality
of the generated counter-speech, both through standard metrics (i.e., JudgeLM)
and a human evaluation. Results show that our framework outperforms standard
LLM baselines and competitive approach, on both assessments. The resulting
framework and the knowledge base pave the way for studying trustworthy and
sound counter-speech generation, in hate speech and beyond.

Method: 引入细粒度输入归因方法，识别对大脑-LLM对齐最重要的具体词汇，并比较大脑对齐和下一个词预测所依赖的词汇子集。

Abstract: Understanding the alignment between large language models (LLMs) and human
brain activity can reveal computational principles underlying language
processing. We introduce a fine-grained input attribution method to identify
the specific words most important for brain-LLM alignment, and leverage it to
study a contentious research question about brain-LLM alignment: the
relationship between brain alignment (BA) and next-word prediction (NWP). Our
findings reveal that BA and NWP rely on largely distinct word subsets: NWP
exhibits recency and primacy biases with a focus on syntax, while BA
prioritizes semantic and discourse-level information with a more targeted
recency effect. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs relate to
human language processing and highlights differences in feature reliance
between BA and NWP. Beyond this study, our attribution method can be broadly
applied to explore the cognitive relevance of model predictions in diverse
language processing tasks.

TL;DR: MoBiLE是一个基于卸载的MoE推理框架，通过混合大小专家机制，对不重要token使用半数量专家加速，对重要token保持完整专家保证质量，实现了1.6-1.72倍加速且精度损失可忽略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE模型卸载方法受限于CPU-GPU互联带宽，预取技术训练开销大且在细粒度专家分割的现代MoE模型中效果不佳。

Method: 提出MoBiLE框架，采用混合大小专家机制：不重要token使用半数量专家加速，重要token使用完整专家；设计专用回退和预取机制在大小专家间切换以提高内存效率。

Result: 在四种典型现代MoE架构和生成任务上评估，在消费级GPU系统上相比基线实现1.60-1.72倍加速，精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: MoBiLE是一个即插即用的MoE推理框架，有效解决了现有卸载方法的带宽瓶颈问题，在保持模型质量的同时显著提升推理速度。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have recently demonstrated exceptional
performance across a diverse range of applications. The principle of sparse
activation in MoE models facilitates an offloading strategy, wherein active
experts are maintained in GPU HBM, while inactive experts are stored in CPU
DRAM. The efficacy of this approach, however, is fundamentally constrained by
the limited bandwidth of the CPU-GPU interconnect. To mitigate this bottleneck,
existing approaches have employed prefetching to accelerate MoE inference.
These methods attempt to predict and prefetch the required experts using
specially trained modules. Nevertheless, such techniques are often encumbered
by significant training overhead and have shown diminished effectiveness on
recent MoE models with fine-grained expert segmentation.
  In this paper, we propose MoBiLE, a plug-and-play offloading-based MoE
inference framework with \textit{mixture of big-little experts}. It reduces the
number of experts for unimportant tokens to half for acceleration while
maintaining full experts for important tokens to guarantee model quality.
Further, a dedicated fallback and prefetching mechanism is designed for
switching between little and big experts to improve memory efficiency. We
evaluate MoBiLE on four typical modern MoE architectures and challenging
generative tasks. Our results show that MoBiLE achieves a speedup of 1.60x to
1.72x compared to the baseline on a consumer GPU system, with negligible
degradation in accuracy.

TL;DR: 该研究通过模拟实验发现，LLM作为审稿人存在系统性偏见：倾向于给LLM生成的论文打更高分，而对包含批判性陈述的人类论文评分偏低，这揭示了在学术评审中不加谨慎使用LLM可能带来的公平性风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在学术工作流程中的深度整合，研究其作为审稿人对学术公平性的潜在影响，特别是LLM在研究和评审双重角色中可能带来的新风险。

Method: 通过模拟实验，设置研究代理（生成和修改论文）和评审代理（评估提交论文），结合人工标注分析LLM评审与人类判断的对齐情况。

Result: 发现LLM评审存在系统性偏见：1）对LLM撰写的论文评分虚高；2）对包含批判性陈述的人类论文持续低估。这些偏见源于LLM的语言特征偏好和对批判性陈述的回避。

Conclusion: 在学术评审中不加谨慎使用LLM会带来公平性风险，但LLM指导的修改确实能提升论文质量，对早期研究者和低质量论文有潜在帮助。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has inspired
researchers to integrate them extensively into the academic workflow,
potentially reshaping how research is practiced and reviewed. While previous
studies highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting research and peer review,
their dual roles in the academic workflow and the complex interplay between
research and review bring new risks that remain largely underexplored. In this
study, we focus on how the deep integration of LLMs into both peer-review and
research processes may influence scholarly fairness, examining the potential
risks of using LLMs as reviewers by simulation. This simulation incorporates a
research agent, which generates papers and revises, alongside a review agent,
which assesses the submissions. Based on the simulation results, we conduct
human annotations and identify pronounced misalignment between LLM-based
reviews and human judgments: (1) LLM reviewers systematically inflate scores
for LLM-authored papers, assigning them markedly higher scores than
human-authored ones; (2) LLM reviewers persistently underrate human-authored
papers with critical statements (e.g., risk, fairness), even after multiple
revisions. Our analysis reveals that these stem from two primary biases in LLM
reviewers: a linguistic feature bias favoring LLM-generated writing styles, and
an aversion toward critical statements. These results highlight the risks and
equity concerns posed to human authors and academic research if LLMs are
deployed in the peer review cycle without adequate caution. On the other hand,
revisions guided by LLM reviews yield quality gains in both LLM-based and human
evaluations, illustrating the potential of the LLMs-as-reviewers for
early-stage researchers and enhancing low-quality papers.

TL;DR: 本研究对200多种语言进行大规模跨语言分词效率评估，发现拉丁文字语言分词效率高，而非拉丁文字和形态复杂语言的分词成本显著增加3-5倍，导致计算成本上升和有效上下文利用减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分词差异阻碍了人工智能在不同语言群体间的公平访问，需要系统量化大型语言模型中的计算不平等问题。

Method: 使用标准化实验框架，通过tiktoken库对所有语言样本进行统一分词处理，收集分词统计数据，使用TPS和RTC等评估指标与英语基准进行比较。

Result: 拉丁文字语言分词效率一致较高，非拉丁文字和形态复杂语言分词膨胀显著，RTC比率通常高出3-5倍，导致计算成本增加和有效上下文利用减少。

Conclusion: 当前AI系统存在结构性不平等，低资源和非拉丁语言使用者面临不成比例的计算劣势，未来研究应优先开发考虑语言类型多样性的分词策略和自适应词汇构建方法。

Abstract: Tokenization disparities pose a significant barrier to achieving equitable
access to artificial intelligence across linguistically diverse populations.
This study conducts a large-scale cross-linguistic evaluation of tokenization
efficiency in over 200 languages to systematically quantify computational
inequities in large language models (LLMs). Using a standardized experimental
framework, we applied consistent preprocessing and normalization protocols,
followed by uniform tokenization through the tiktoken library across all
language samples. Comprehensive tokenization statistics were collected using
established evaluation metrics, including Tokens Per Sentence (TPS) and
Relative Tokenization Cost (RTC), benchmarked against English baselines. Our
cross-linguistic analysis reveals substantial and systematic disparities:
Latin-script languages consistently exhibit higher tokenization efficiency,
while non-Latin and morphologically complex languages incur significantly
greater token inflation, often 3-5 times higher RTC ratios. These
inefficiencies translate into increased computational costs and reduced
effective context utilization for underrepresented languages. Overall, the
findings highlight structural inequities in current AI systems, where speakers
of low-resource and non-Latin languages face disproportionate computational
disadvantages. Future research should prioritize the development of
linguistically informed tokenization strategies and adaptive vocabulary
construction methods that incorporate typological diversity, ensuring more
inclusive and computationally equitable multilingual AI systems.

TL;DR: PRoH是一个动态规划和推理框架，通过上下文感知规划、结构化问题分解和实体加权重叠引导的检索算法，解决了现有知识超图RAG方法的局限性，在多跳问答任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于知识超图的RAG方法存在静态检索规划、非自适应检索执行以及对超图结构和语义的浅层利用等三大限制，限制了其进行有效多跳问答的能力。

Method: 1) 上下文感知规划模块，通过描绘局部超图邻域来指导结构化的推理计划生成；2) 结构化问题分解过程，将子问题组织为动态演化的有向无环图，实现自适应多轨迹探索；3) 实体加权重叠引导的推理路径检索算法，优先考虑语义连贯的超边遍历。

Result: 在多个领域的实验中，PRoH实现了最先进的性能，平均F1分数超过先前SOTA模型HyperGraphRAG 19.73%，生成评估分数提高8.41%，在长距离多跳推理任务中保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PRoH框架通过动态规划和结构化推理有效克服了现有知识超图RAG方法的局限性，在多跳问答任务中表现出卓越的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Knowledge Hypergraphs (KHs) have recently emerged as a knowledge
representation for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offering a paradigm to
model multi-entity relations into a structured form. However, existing KH-based
RAG methods suffer from three major limitations: static retrieval planning,
non-adaptive retrieval execution, and superficial use of KH structure and
semantics, which constrain their ability to perform effective multi-hop
question answering. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRoH, a dynamic
Planning and Reasoning over Knowledge Hypergraphs framework. PRoH incorporates
three core innovations: (i) a context-aware planning module that sketches the
local KH neighborhood to guide structurally grounded reasoning plan generation;
(ii) a structured question decomposition process that organizes subquestions as
a dynamically evolving Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) to enable adaptive,
multi-trajectory exploration; and (iii) an Entity-Weighted Overlap (EWO)-guided
reasoning path retrieval algorithm that prioritizes semantically coherent
hyperedge traversals. Experiments across multiple domains demonstrate that PRoH
achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing the prior SOTA model
HyperGraphRAG by an average of 19.73% in F1 and 8.41% in Generation Evaluation
(G-E) score, while maintaining strong robustness in long-range multi-hop
reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: CLEAR框架通过分析LLM内部隐藏状态表示，定位知识冲突并进行冲突感知微调，显著提升了RAG系统的准确性和上下文忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统存在不忠实问题，模型响应与检索证据相矛盾。现有方法将LLM视为黑盒，忽视了LLM内部如何整合检索证据与参数记忆的关键问题。

Method: 提出CLEAR框架：1) 将上下文分解为细粒度句子级知识；2) 使用隐藏状态探测定位冲突知识；3) 引入冲突感知微调指导模型准确整合检索证据。

Result: 在三个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，CLEAR显著提高了准确性和上下文忠实度，在不同冲突条件下始终优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过深入理解LLM内部知识整合机制并针对性处理知识冲突，CLEAR有效解决了RAG系统的忠实性问题，为提升LLM事实性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm to
enhance the factuality of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RAG
systems often suffer from an unfaithfulness issue, where the model's response
contradicts evidence from the retrieved context. Existing approaches to
improving contextual faithfulness largely rely on external interventions, such
as prompt engineering, decoding constraints, or reward-based fine-tuning. These
works treat the LLM as a black box and overlook a crucial question: how does
the LLM internally integrate retrieved evidence with its parametric memory,
particularly under knowledge conflicts? To address this gap, we conduct a
probing-based analysis of hidden-state representations in LLMs and observe
three findings: knowledge integration occurs hierarchically, conflicts manifest
as latent signals at the sentence level, and irrelevant context is often
amplified when aligned with parametric knowledge. Building on these findings,
we propose CLEAR (Conflict-Localized and Enhanced Attention for RAG), a
framework that (i) decomposes context into fine-grained sentence-level
knowledge, (ii) employs hidden-state probing to localize conflicting knowledge,
and (iii) introduces conflict-aware fine-tuning to guide the model to
accurately integrate retrieved evidence. Extensive experiments across three
benchmarks demonstrate that CLEAR substantially improves both accuracy and
contextual faithfulness, consistently outperforming strong baselines under
diverse conflict conditions. The related resources are available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究通过多语言Wug测试评估LLMs在形态学泛化任务中的表现，发现模型能像人类一样处理未见词汇，但准确率主要受训练数据量而非语言复杂度影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs的语言能力，特别是它们是否能像人类一样对陌生词汇进行形态学泛化，以及这种能力是受语言结构复杂度还是训练数据量的影响。

Method: 使用多语言Wug测试，在加泰罗尼亚语、英语、希腊语和西班牙语四种语言上测试六个模型，并与人类表现进行比较。

Result: 模型能以接近人类的准确率对未见词汇进行形态学泛化，但准确率模式更符合社区规模和数据可用性，而非结构复杂度。西班牙语和英语等资源丰富的语言表现更好。

Conclusion: 模型行为主要由语言资源丰富度驱动，而非对语法复杂度的敏感性，仅表面类似人类语言能力。

Abstract: The linguistic abilities of Large Language Models are a matter of ongoing
debate. This study contributes to this discussion by investigating model
performance in a morphological generalization task that involves novel words.
Using a multilingual adaptation of the Wug Test, six models were tested across
four partially unrelated languages (Catalan, English, Greek, and Spanish) and
compared with human speakers. The aim is to determine whether model accuracy
approximates human competence and whether it is shaped primarily by linguistic
complexity or by the quantity of available training data. Consistent with
previous research, the results show that the models are able to generalize
morphological processes to unseen words with human-like accuracy. However,
accuracy patterns align more closely with community size and data availability
than with structural complexity, refining earlier claims in the literature. In
particular, languages with larger speaker communities and stronger digital
representation, such as Spanish and English, revealed higher accuracy than
less-resourced ones like Catalan and Greek. Overall, our findings suggest that
model behavior is mainly driven by the richness of linguistic resources rather
than by sensitivity to grammatical complexity, reflecting a form of performance
that resembles human linguistic competence only superficially.

TL;DR: 提出SMEC训练框架，通过SMRL方法减少梯度方差、ADS模块降低维度剪枝信息损失、S-XBM模块增强高低维嵌入间的无监督学习，在保持性能的同时显著降低嵌入维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型生成的高维嵌入虽然包含丰富语义信息，但加剧了计算复杂度和存储需求，阻碍实际部署。

Method: 使用Sequential Matryoshka Representation Learning(SMRL)缓解训练梯度方差，Adaptive Dimension Selection(ADS)模块减少维度剪枝信息退化，Selectable Cross-batch Memory(S-XBM)模块增强高低维嵌入间的无监督学习。

Result: 在图像、文本和多模态数据集上实验表明，SMEC在显著降维的同时保持性能。在BEIR数据集上，256维压缩LLM2Vec嵌入性能比Matryoshka-Adaptor和Search-Adaptor分别提升1.1和2.7分。

Conclusion: SMEC框架能有效解决高维嵌入带来的计算和存储问题，在降维的同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) generate high-dimensional embeddings that
capture rich semantic and syntactic information. However, high-dimensional
embeddings exacerbate computational complexity and storage requirements,
thereby hindering practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel training framework named Sequential Matryoshka Embedding Compression
(SMEC). This framework introduces the Sequential Matryoshka Representation
Learning(SMRL) method to mitigate gradient variance during training, the
Adaptive Dimension Selection (ADS) module to reduce information degradation
during dimension pruning, and the Selectable Cross-batch Memory (S-XBM) module
to enhance unsupervised learning between high- and low-dimensional embeddings.
Experiments on image, text, and multimodal datasets demonstrate that SMEC
achieves significant dimensionality reduction while maintaining performance.
For instance, on the BEIR dataset, our approach improves the performance of
compressed LLM2Vec embeddings (256 dimensions) by 1.1 points and 2.7 points
compared to the Matryoshka-Adaptor and Search-Adaptor models, respectively.

Result: 实验结果显示，在个性化设置中，最先进的检测器性能显著下降，提出的预测方法与实际性能差距相关性达85%。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了个性化文本检测的挑战，为未来研究提供了重要基准和性能预测工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have grown more powerful in language generation,
producing fluent text and even imitating personal style. Yet, this ability also
heightens the risk of identity impersonation. To the best of our knowledge, no
prior work has examined personalized machine-generated text (MGT) detection. In
this paper, we introduce \dataset, the first benchmark for evaluating detector
robustness in personalized settings, built from literary and blog texts paired
with their LLM-generated imitations. Our experimental results demonstrate large
performance gaps across detectors in personalized settings: some
state-of-the-art models suffer significant drops. We attribute this limitation
to the \textit{feature-inversion trap}, where features that are discriminative
in general domains become inverted and misleading when applied to personalized
text. Based on this finding, we propose \method, a simple and reliable way to
predict detector performance changes in personalized settings. \method
identifies latent directions corresponding to inverted features and constructs
probe datasets that differ primarily along these features to evaluate detector
dependence. Our experiments show that \method can accurately predict both the
direction and the magnitude of post-transfer changes, showing 85\% correlation
with the actual performance gaps. We hope that this work will encourage further
research on personalized text detection.

Motivation: 测试时缩放技术此前仅限于有可验证正确答案的领域（如数学和编程），本研究旨在将其扩展到评估标注分歧的LeWiDi任务中。

Method: 在LeWiDi-2025任务上实验了三种测试时缩放方法：模型平均、多数投票和Best-of-N采样。

Result: 两种基准方法（模型平均和多数投票）在LeWiDi任务上持续提升了LLM性能，但Best-of-N方法没有效果。

Conclusion: Best-of-N方法目前无法从数学领域成功转移到LeWiDi任务，需要分析这种差距的潜在原因。

Abstract: Test-time scaling is a family of techniques to improve LLM outputs at
inference time by performing extra computation. To the best of our knowledge,
test-time scaling has been limited to domains with verifiably correct answers,
like mathematics and coding. We transfer test-time scaling to the LeWiDi-2025
tasks to evaluate annotation disagreements. We experiment with three test-time
scaling methods: two benchmark algorithms (Model Averaging and Majority
Voting), and a Best-of-N sampling method. The two benchmark methods improve LLM
performance consistently on the LeWiDi tasks, but the Best-of-N method does
not. Our experiments suggest that the Best-of-N method does not currently
transfer from mathematics to LeWiDi tasks, and we analyze potential reasons for
this gap.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型在处理典型与异常图像时的权衡问题，发现当图像与文本不一致时，模型的概念理解能力会下降，且语用先验的影响强于语义先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在训练时学习概念表征，但通常用于分析单个实例。当评估实例不典型时，模型需要在语用先验（文本和视觉输入相关）和语义先验（概念表征对类别实例普遍成立）之间进行权衡。

Method: 引入新的评估数据集VISaGE，包含典型和异常图像，通过精心平衡的实验设计，分析模型在图像与文本不一致时的表现。

Result: 当语用先验的输入一致性假设被违反时，概念理解能力下降，且语用先验的影响比语义先验更强。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在处理不典型实例时，语用先验对概念理解的影响比语义先验更显著，这揭示了模型在现实应用中的局限性。

Abstract: While Vision Language Models (VLMs) learn conceptual representations, in the
form of generalized knowledge, during training, they are typically used to
analyze individual instances. When evaluation instances are atypical, this
paradigm results in tension between two priors in the model. The first is a
pragmatic prior that the textual and visual input are both relevant, arising
from VLM finetuning on congruent inputs; the second is a semantic prior that
the conceptual representation is generally true for instances of the category.
In order to understand how VLMs trade off these priors, we introduce a new
evaluation dataset, VISaGE, consisting of both typical and exceptional images.
In carefully balanced experiments, we show that conceptual understanding
degrades when the assumption of congruency underlying the pragmatic prior is
violated with incongruent images. This effect is stronger than the effect of
the semantic prior when querying about individual instances.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT)方法，通过微调让LLMs忠实表达不确定性，而不改变其答案分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs经常错误传达其不确定性：重复查询会产生不同答案，但生成的回复通常没有或只有不反映这种变异性的不确定性修饰语，这造成了忠实性差距。

Method: 通过增强模型样本与不确定性修饰语（如'可能'、'很可能'）来构建训练数据，这些修饰语与样本一致性对齐，无需额外监督。

Result: 在开放域问答任务上，FUT显著减少了忠实性差距，同时保持了问答准确性并引入最小的语义分布偏移。

Conclusion: FUT是一种简单有效的方法，可以教导LLMs忠实传达不确定性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often miscommunicate their uncertainty: repeated
queries can produce divergent answers, yet generated responses are typically
unhedged or hedged in ways that do not reflect this variability. This conveys
unfaithful information about the uncertain state of the LLMs' knowledge,
creating a faithfulness gap that affects even strong LLMs. We introduce
Faithful Uncertainty Tuning (FUT): a fine-tuning approach that teaches
instruction-tuned LLMs to express uncertainty faithfully without altering their
underlying answer distribution. We construct training data by augmenting model
samples with uncertainty hedges (i.e. verbal cues such as 'possibly' or
'likely') aligned with sample consistency, requiring no supervision beyond the
model and a set of prompts. We evaluate FUT on open-domain question answering
(QA) across multiple models and datasets. Our results show that FUT
substantially reduces the faithfulness gap, while preserving QA accuracy and
introducing minimal semantic distribution shift. Further analyses demonstrate
robustness across decoding strategies, choice of hedgers, and other forms of
uncertainty expression (i.e. numerical). These findings establish FUT as a
simple and effective way to teach LLMs to communicate uncertainty faithfully.

Motivation: 随着大语言模型在开放域写作中的广泛应用，检测机器生成文本对于确保内容真实性和可信度变得至关重要。现有方法在现实场景中面临泛化能力有限、易受改写攻击和缺乏可解释性等问题。

Method: 提出StyleDecipher框架，通过联合建模离散风格指标和基于语义嵌入的连续风格表示，在统一表示空间中捕捉人类和LLM输出的风格级差异，无需访问模型内部或标记片段。

Result: 在五个不同领域（新闻、代码、论文、评论、学术摘要）的实验中，StyleDecipher在领域内检测准确率持续达到最先进水平，跨领域评估中比现有基线高出36.30%，对对抗性扰动和混合人机内容保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 风格信号为区分机器生成文本提供了可解释的证据，StyleDecipher框架实现了准确、可解释且领域无关的检测，源代码已开源。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of large language models (LLMs) into
open-domain writing, detecting machine-generated text has become a critical
task for ensuring content authenticity and trust. Existing approaches rely on
statistical discrepancies or model-specific heuristics to distinguish between
LLM-generated and human-written text. However, these methods struggle in
real-world scenarios due to limited generalization, vulnerability to
paraphrasing, and lack of explainability, particularly when facing stylistic
diversity or hybrid human-AI authorship. In this work, we propose
StyleDecipher, a robust and explainable detection framework that revisits
LLM-generated text detection using combined feature extractors to quantify
stylistic differences. By jointly modeling discrete stylistic indicators and
continuous stylistic representations derived from semantic embeddings,
StyleDecipher captures distinctive style-level divergences between human and
LLM outputs within a unified representation space. This framework enables
accurate, explainable, and domain-agnostic detection without requiring access
to model internals or labeled segments. Extensive experiments across five
diverse domains, including news, code, essays, reviews, and academic abstracts,
demonstrate that StyleDecipher consistently achieves state-of-the-art in-domain
accuracy. Moreover, in cross-domain evaluations, it surpasses existing
baselines by up to 36.30%, while maintaining robustness against adversarial
perturbations and mixed human-AI content. Further qualitative and quantitative
analysis confirms that stylistic signals provide explainable evidence for
distinguishing machine-generated text. Our source code can be accessed at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COSTAR框架在大型LLM上表现良好，但在较小本地优化模型上表现不一致，特别是在需要更具指导性或约束性输出的任务中。

Method: 通过一系列受控的提示-输出评估，使用较小参数模型（最多80亿参数）测试COSTAR-A框架的有效性。

Result: COSTAR-A能够提升某些任务中本地化LLM的输出结构和决策性，但效果因模型和用例而异。Llama 3.1-8B模型在使用COSTAR-A时表现优于单独使用COSTAR。

Conclusion: COSTAR-A作为一个提示框架具有适应性和可扩展性，特别适用于资源受限硬件上的计算高效AI部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are highly sensitive to prompt design, and
making optimized prompting techniques is crucial for generating consistent,
high-quality outputs. In this study, we introduce COSTAR-A, a novel prompt
engineering framework that enhances the existing COSTAR method, which stands
for Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, and Response, by adding the
'Answer' component at the end. We demonstrate that while the original COSTAR
framework improves prompt clarity and aligns outputs for larger LLMs, its
performance is less consistent with smaller, locally optimized models,
particularly in tasks that require more directive or constrained outputs.
Through a series of controlled prompt-output assessments with smaller (at most
8 billion parameters), fine-tuned models, we found that COSTAR-A can enhance
the output structure and decisiveness of localized LLMs for certain tasks,
although its effectiveness varies across models and use cases. Notably, the
Llama 3.1-8B model exhibited performance improvements when prompted with
COSTAR-A compared to COSTAR alone. These findings emphasize the adaptability
and scalability of COSTAR-A as a prompting framework, particularly in
computationally efficient AI deployments on resource-constrained hardware.

### [55] [Reasoning Pattern Matters: Learning to Reason without Human Rationales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12643)
*Chaoxu Pang,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出PARO框架，通过让LLM学习任务特定的推理模式来自动生成推理轨迹，从而大幅减少人工标注成本，在模式化推理任务上达到与10倍规模人工标注相当的SFT+RLVR性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SFT+RLVR范式依赖昂贵的人工标注推理轨迹，本文旨在研究如何在保持推理性能的同时大幅降低标注成本。

Method: 提出PARO框架，让LLM学习任务特定的推理模式，自动生成与模式对齐的推理轨迹，无需人工标注。

Result: PARO生成的推理轨迹在SFT+RLVR性能上与10倍规模的人工标注相当，证明大规模人工标注可被有限监督的LLM自动标注替代。

Conclusion: 对于模式化推理任务，推理模式而非推理轨迹的数量或质量是性能关键，通过模式感知的自动标注可显著降低成本。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning
capabilities under the widely adopted SFT+RLVR paradigm, which first performs
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on human-annotated reasoning trajectories
(rationales) to establish initial reasoning behaviors, then applies
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize the model
using verifiable signals without golden rationales. However, annotating
high-quality rationales for the SFT stage remains prohibitively expensive. This
paper investigates when and how rationale annotation costs can be substantially
reduced without compromising reasoning performance. We identify a broad class
of problems, termed patterned reasoning tasks, where reasoning follows a fixed,
procedural strategy consistent across instances. Although instances vary in
content such as domain knowledge, factual information, or numeric values, the
solution derives from applying a shared reasoning pattern. We argue that the
success of SFT+RLVR on such tasks primarily stems from its ability to enable
models to internalize these reasoning patterns. Using numerical semantic
matching as a representative task, we provide both causal and behavioral
evidence showing that reasoning patterns rather than the quantity or quality of
rationales are the key determinant of performance. Building on these insights,
we propose Pattern-Aware LLMs as Rationale AnnOtators (PARO), a simple yet
effective framework that enables LLMs to generate rationales aligned with
task-specific reasoning patterns without requiring human rationale annotations.
Experiments show that PARO-generated rationales achieve comparable SFT+RLVR
performance to human rationales that are 10 times larger. These results suggest
that large-scale human rationale annotations can be replaced with LLM-based
automatic annotations requiring only limited human supervision over reasoning
patterns.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出生成空间大小(GSS)概念来解决LLM在创意任务中输出过于同质化和事实任务中产生多样化但错误回答的问题，并开发了GSSBench评估套件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在不同开放生成任务中存在校准问题：创意任务输出过于同质化，事实任务产生多样化但错误的回答，需要统一框架来解决这两种失败模式。

Method: 引入有效生成空间大小(GSS)概念，构建GSSBench任务套件评估不同指标，使用模型内部信息进行幻觉检测和不确定性量化。

Result: 发现幻觉检测指标（特别是EigenScore）优于标准多样性和不确定性量化指标，仅使用模型内部信息就能提供对模型内部任务表示的可解释洞察。

Conclusion: GSS概念有三个应用：检测提示歧义并预测澄清问题、解释推理模型中的过度思考与思考不足、引导模型扩展生成空间以获得高质量多样化输出。

Abstract: Different open-ended generation tasks require different degrees of output
diversity. However, current LLMs are often miscalibrated. They collapse to
overly homogeneous outputs for creative tasks and hallucinate diverse but
incorrect responses for factual tasks. We argue that these two failure modes
are unified by, and can both be addressed by, the notion of effective
generation space size (GSS) -- the set of semantically distinct outputs a model
considers for a prompt. We present GSSBench, a task suite of prompt pairs with
ground-truth GSS relationships to assess different metrics and understand where
models diverge from desired behavior. We find that hallucination detection
metrics, particularly EigenScore, consistently outperform standard diversity
and uncertainty quantification metrics, while using only model internals,
providing interpretable insights into a model's internal task representations.
We demonstrate three applications of GSS: (1) detecting prompt ambiguity and
predicting clarification questions for better grounding, (2) interpreting
overthinking and underthinking in reasoning models, and (3) steering models to
expand their generation space to yield high-quality and diverse outputs.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了全模态细粒度感知，提出了Omni-Detective数据生成管道来生成高质量细节描述数据，训练了Audio-Captioner和Omni-Captioner模型，并设计了Omni-Cloze评估基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全模态语言模型在捕捉和描述细粒度细节方面的能力仍有限，且存在细节与幻觉共增长的问题，需要进行系统研究。

Method: 提出Omni-Detective代理数据生成管道，集成工具调用来自主生成高质量多模态数据；基于此数据训练Audio-Captioner和Omni-Captioner描述模型；设计Omni-Cloze填空式评估基准。

Result: Audio-Captioner在MMAU和MMAR上表现最佳，超越Gemini 2.5 Flash，与Gemini 2.5 Pro相当；Omni-Captioner在VDC上达到新SOTA，在video-SALMONN 2上实现细节与幻觉的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: Omni-Detective能有效生成高质量细节描述，Omni-Cloze能可靠评估细节描述，提出的方法在全模态细粒度感知方面具有优越性。

Abstract: Fine-grained perception of multimodal information is critical for advancing
human-AI interaction. With recent progress in audio-visual technologies, Omni
Language Models (OLMs), capable of processing audio and video signals in
parallel, have emerged as a promising paradigm for achieving richer
understanding and reasoning. However, their capacity to capture and describe
fine-grained details remains limited explored. In this work, we present a
systematic and comprehensive investigation of omni detailed perception from the
perspectives of the data pipeline, models, and benchmark. We first identify an
inherent "co-growth" between detail and hallucination in current OLMs. To
address this, we propose Omni-Detective, an agentic data generation pipeline
integrating tool-calling, to autonomously produce highly detailed yet minimally
hallucinatory multimodal data. Based on the data generated with Omni-Detective,
we train two captioning models: Audio-Captioner for audio-only detailed
perception, and Omni-Captioner for audio-visual detailed perception. Under the
cascade evaluation protocol, Audio-Captioner achieves the best performance on
MMAU and MMAR among all open-source models, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash and
delivering performance comparable to Gemini 2.5 Pro. On existing detailed
captioning benchmarks, Omni-Captioner sets a new state-of-the-art on VDC and
achieves the best trade-off between detail and hallucination on the
video-SALMONN 2 testset. Given the absence of a dedicated benchmark for omni
detailed perception, we design Omni-Cloze, a novel cloze-style evaluation for
detailed audio, visual, and audio-visual captioning that ensures stable,
efficient, and reliable assessment. Experimental results and analysis
demonstrate the effectiveness of Omni-Detective in generating high-quality
detailed captions, as well as the superiority of Omni-Cloze in evaluating such
detailed captions.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究扩展了关于语言模型归纳偏好的研究，采用广义范畴语法构建更接近自然语言的人工语言，评估模型对未见长句的泛化能力，发现类型学上合理的词序更容易被语言模型泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要使用上下文无关的人工语言来探索语言模型的归纳偏好，但这种方法无法覆盖自然语言中的某些结构（如无界依赖和轻度上下文敏感结构）。本研究旨在通过更接近自然语言的形式化方法来更全面地评估语言模型的泛化能力。

Method: 采用广义范畴语法（GCG）构建人工语言，覆盖了传统方法忽略的结构（如无界依赖和轻度上下文敏感结构），并重点评估语言模型对未见长句的泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，类型学上合理的词序（typologically plausible word orders）更容易被语言模型进行生产性泛化。

Conclusion: 通过更接近自然语言的人工语言和更严格的评估范式，本研究证实了语言模型确实倾向于更容易泛化类型学上合理的语法结构。

Abstract: Whether language models (LMs) have inductive biases that favor typologically
frequent grammatical properties over rare, implausible ones has been
investigated, typically using artificial languages (ALs) (White and Cotterell,
2021; Kuribayashi et al., 2024). In this paper, we extend these works from two
perspectives. First, we extend their context-free AL formalization by adopting
Generalized Categorial Grammar (GCG) (Wood, 2014), which allows ALs to cover
attested but previously overlooked constructions, such as unbounded dependency
and mildly context-sensitive structures. Second, our evaluation focuses more on
the generalization ability of LMs to process unseen longer test sentences.
Thus, our ALs better capture features of natural languages and our experimental
paradigm leads to clearer conclusions -- typologically plausible word orders
tend to be easier for LMs to productively generalize.

<details>

Motivation: 评估语言模型对话自然性具有挑战性，因为"自然性"概念多样且缺乏可扩展的量化指标。

Method: 提出DGRC方法：将对话分割为提示，使用语言模型生成子部分延续，重新组合对话和延续，并比较重组序列的可能性。

Result: 语言模型偏好继续问题相关内容，指令调优模型此效应更强；当存在相关线索时，模型会减少其问题相关性偏好。

Conclusion: DGRC方法减轻了语言模型语言分析中的偏见，能够系统测试话语敏感行为，反映了成功对话动态的特征。

Abstract: Evaluating the naturalness of dialogue in language models (LMs) is not
trivial: notions of 'naturalness' vary, and scalable quantitative metrics
remain limited. This study leverages the linguistic notion of 'at-issueness' to
assess dialogue naturalness and introduces a new method: Divide, Generate,
Recombine, and Compare (DGRC). DGRC (i) divides a dialogue as a prompt, (ii)
generates continuations for subparts using LMs, (iii) recombines the dialogue
and continuations, and (iv) compares the likelihoods of the recombined
sequences. This approach mitigates bias in linguistic analyses of LMs and
enables systematic testing of discourse-sensitive behavior. Applying DGRC, we
find that LMs prefer to continue dialogue on at-issue content, with this effect
enhanced in instruct-tuned models. They also reduce their at-issue preference
when relevant cues (e.g., "Hey, wait a minute") are present. Although
instruct-tuning does not further amplify this modulation, the pattern reflects
a hallmark of successful dialogue dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前基于de Saussure和Chomsky理论对LLMs的批评过于推测性和无建设性，认为需要更实证的语言学框架来理解LLMs的语言建模能力。

Method: 采用Witold Mańczak的经验主义语言学框架，将语言定义为所有说和写的内容的总和，强调使用频率作为语言的核心原则，并基于此重新审视LLMs的批评。

Result: 挑战了先前对LLMs的批评，提供了基于使用频率原则的语言模型设计、评估和解释的建构性指南。

Conclusion: 通过转向Mańczak的经验主义语言学视角，能够更有效地理解和评估LLMs的语言建模能力，为语言模型研究提供更实用的理论框架。

Abstract: Linguistic commentary on LLMs, heavily influenced by the theoretical
frameworks of de Saussure and Chomsky, is often speculative and unproductive.
Critics challenge whether LLMs can legitimately model language, citing the need
for "deep structure" or "grounding" to achieve an idealized linguistic
"competence." We argue for a radical shift in perspective towards the
empiricist principles of Witold Ma\'nczak, a prominent general and historical
linguist. He defines language not as a "system of signs" or a "computational
system of the brain" but as the totality of all that is said and written. Above
all, he identifies frequency of use of particular language elements as
language's primary governing principle. Using his framework, we challenge prior
critiques of LLMs and provide a constructive guide for designing, evaluating,
and interpreting language models.

TL;DR: Dr.LLM是一个动态路由框架，通过轻量级路由器决定跳过、执行或重复Transformer层，在保持精度的同时提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM对所有token都经过所有层，导致简单查询计算浪费，复杂查询推理深度不足。现有自适应深度方法依赖昂贵推理搜索或架构修改，且往往牺牲精度。

Method: 使用MCTS推导高质量层配置，通过窗口池化稳定路由、焦点损失与类别平衡、瓶颈MLP路由器等技术，在预训练模型上添加轻量级路由器。

Result: 在ARC和DART上精度提升3.4%，平均每样本节省5层；在跨域任务上仅精度下降0.85%但保持效率，优于现有路由方法7.7%。

Conclusion: Dr.LLM证明显式监督的路由器可在不改动基础权重的情况下，为冻结LLM实现预算感知、精度驱动的推理。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a
transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and
insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning.
Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on
costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining,
and in practice often degrade accuracy despite efficiency gains. We introduce
Dr.LLM, Dynamic routing of Layers for LLMs, a retrofittable framework that
equips pretrained models with lightweight per-layer routers deciding to skip,
execute, or repeat a block. Routers are trained with explicit supervision:
using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we derive high-quality layer
configurations that preserve or improve accuracy under a compute budget. Our
design, windowed pooling for stable routing, focal loss with class balancing,
and bottleneck MLP routers, ensures robustness under class imbalance and long
sequences. On ARC (logic) and DART (math), Dr.LLM improves accuracy by up to
+3.4%p while saving 5 layers per example on average. Routers generalize to
out-of-domain tasks (MMLU, GSM8k, AIME, TruthfulQA, SQuADv2, GPQA, PIQA,
AGIEval) with only 0.85% accuracy drop while retaining efficiency, and
outperform prior routing methods by up to +7.7%p. Overall, Dr.LLM shows that
explicitly supervised routers retrofit frozen LLMs for budget-aware,
accuracy-driven inference without altering base weights.

Method: 分析Kaguya TC图像的压缩行为，识别系统性视差噪声模式，特别是在暗区域。提出通过减少压缩图像视差图中的残余噪声来增强3D地图质量的方法

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的方法有效减少了高程噪声

Conclusion: 该方法提高了地形数据的安全性和可靠性，为未来月球任务提供了更可靠的3D地图数据

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究CLIP在视觉语言模型中优于自监督模型DINO的优势来源，是来自语言监督还是更大的训练数据

Method: 在相同架构、数据集和训练配置下预训练CLIP和DINO，分析嵌入特征，并在20个VQA基准上评估它们在视觉语言模型中的表现

Result: CLIP捕获高级语义（如对象类别、文本），DINO对低级特征（如颜色、样式）更敏感；CLIP在文本密集型任务中表现优异，DINO在视觉中心任务中略胜一筹

Conclusion: 语言监督是CLIP在视觉语言模型中优势的关键因素，为视觉编码器设计及其对VLM性能影响提供了科学见解

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门的空间推理框架，通过在输入提示中嵌入边界框坐标来增强空间理解，在AI City Challenge Track 3仓库数据集上取得了73.0606分，排名第4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模3D环境（如仓库）中视觉语言系统的空间推理挑战，包括场景杂乱、遮挡和需要精确空间理解的问题。现有模型依赖局部外观且缺乏显式空间基础，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 将掩码维度（边界框坐标）嵌入输入提示，使模型能够推理对象几何和布局；针对四个问题类别（距离估计、对象计数、多选基础、空间关系推理）进行任务特定监督的微调；在训练集中向GPT响应添加标准化答案以提高一致性。

Result: 在公共排行榜上获得73.0606的最终分数，总体排名第4。

Conclusion: 结构化提示丰富和针对性优化在推进现实工业环境空间推理方面是有效的。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略在医学影像中的可解释性，发现DINO结合Grad-CAM能提供最忠实和局部化的解释，支持ViT在医疗诊断中的可靠集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医学影像中，模型决策的可理解性直接影响临床信任和采用。Vision Transformers在诊断影像中表现出色，但其复杂的注意力机制对可解释性构成挑战。

Method: 使用Gradient Attention Rollout和Grad-CAM评估不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略（ViT、DeiT、DINO、Swin Transformer），在周边血细胞分类和乳腺超声图像分类任务上进行定量和定性分析。

Result: DINO结合Grad-CAM在所有数据集中提供最忠实和局部化的解释。Grad-CAM始终产生类别区分性和空间精确的热图，而Gradient Attention Rollout产生更分散的激活。即使在误分类情况下，DINO与Grad-CAM也能突出显示误导模型的临床相关形态特征。

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，本研究支持Vision Transformers在关键医疗诊断工作流程中的可靠和可解释集成。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

Motivation: 水下图像存在退化问题（低对比度、颜色失真）和海洋生物的自然伪装特性，现有方法难以有效应对这些挑战。

Method: 使用MSRCR算法进行数据增强，设计扩展感受野模块和多尺度渐进解码器，提出自适应先验引导机制融合位置和边界先验信息。

Result: 在两个公开MAS数据集上的实验表明，APGNet在多种评估指标下优于15种最先进方法。

Conclusion: APGNet通过整合图像增强和多尺度特征提取，有效解决了水下伪装物体检测的关键问题，具有优越性能。

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: VidMP3能够有效解决现有视频编辑方法在结构可变编辑中的问题，代码将在GitHub上公开。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift

preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于QR码去模糊的自适应双网络方法，包括用于严重模糊的EG-Restormer和用于轻度模糊的LENet，通过边缘引导注意力块显式利用QR码的结构先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法很少显式利用QR码的高度结构化模式和锐利边缘先验，而QR码去模糊的关键目标是确保成功解码而非感知质量。

Method: 提出边缘引导注意力块(EGAB)将显式边缘先验嵌入Transformer架构，基于此构建EG-Restormer处理严重模糊QR码，设计轻量级LENet处理轻度模糊，并集成到自适应双网络(ADNet)中根据模糊程度动态选择网络。

Result: 实验表明EG-Restormer和ADNet在解码率和速度方面均达到最先进性能，特别适合资源受限的移动设备。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式利用QR码结构先验和自适应网络选择，有效提升了QR码去模糊的解码性能。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

Conclusion: 准确的几何是有效利用生成模型增强3D场景重建的基本前提，所提出的方法通过几何指导实现了准确一致的场景补全，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

Conclusion: DRL框架通过轻量级适配器和解耦监督机制，有效解决了类增量学习中的关键挑战，实现了高效且性能优越的增量学习能力。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

Conclusion: SSDiff通过自监督选择性引导扩散实现了对老照片人脸的有效修复，在保持身份一致性的同时处理了多种复合退化问题

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

Result: 实验结果表明ImageSentinel能有效检测未授权数据集使用，同时为授权应用保持生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageSentinel为保护视觉数据集在RAIG系统中的使用提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

Conclusion: 提出的约束优化方法能够有效设计实用的编码函数，提升压缩单光子3D成像系统在硬件限制下的性能表现。

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远程生理测量需要收集用户隐私敏感信息，现有无接触测量方法仍依赖带标签的客户端数据，这在更新已部署模型时面临无标签用户数据的挑战。

Method: 提出FedHUG框架，包含最小偏差聚合模块（动态调整聚合权重处理异构非IID特征）和全局分布感知学习控制器（参数化标签分布并动态调整客户端训练策略）。

Result: 在RGB视频和毫米波雷达的生理参数估计中，该方法优于现有最先进技术。

Conclusion: FedHUG框架有效解决了联邦无监督领域泛化中的异构性和标签分布偏移问题，为隐私保护的远程生理测量提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

*Jiahuan Zhou,Chao Zhu,Zhenyu Cui,Zichen Liu,Xu Zou,Gang Hua*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KFF的持续测试时自适应方法，通过类感知域知识融合与分裂机制，动态积累判别性历史知识，解决现有方法中新知识学习不足和有害历史知识干扰的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法通过恢复初始模型或重用历史模型来减少灾难性遗忘，但通常伴随新知识学习不足和有害历史知识干扰，导致性能严重下降。

Method: 设计了域知识分裂(KFI)模块自适应分离新域知识，减轻与当前域不同的旧域负知识影响；设计了域知识融合(KFU)模块以最小成本将分裂的新知识合并到现有知识池中，采用贪心知识动态合并策略。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上的大量实验验证了所提方法相对于其他方法的有效性。

Conclusion: KFF方法通过类感知域知识融合与分裂机制，能够有效解决CTTA中的知识积累和负知识干扰问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出扩散原型学习(DPL)框架，通过扩散过程将单次学习中的原型建模为概率分布，生成多样化且语义一致的原型变体，显著提升医学图像分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于原型的单次医学图像分割方法依赖支持特征的确定性平均，无法捕捉类内多样性，导致在有限标注数据和显著解剖变异下泛化能力不足。

Method: DPL框架包含三个核心创新：扩散原型增强模块通过前向-反向扩散过程生成原型变体；空间感知条件机制利用原型特征统计的几何属性；保守融合策略在保持原型保真度的同时最大化表示多样性。

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在单次医学图像分割中取得了显著改进，建立了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: DPL通过将原型建模为概率分布并利用扩散过程进行特征空间探索，有效解决了单次医学图像分割中的原型表示挑战，实现了更鲁棒的泛化能力。

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种状态空间提示（SSP）方法，通过帧内聚集和帧间传播模块来聚合和传播视频中的关键时空信息，显著提升了视频分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的预训练状态空间模型在视频分类中虽然效率高，但顺序压缩的视觉提示令牌无法有效捕获视频的时空上下文信息，限制了空间和时间信息的有效传播。

Method: 提出了状态空间提示（SSP）方法，包含帧内聚集（IFG）模块来聚合每帧内的空间关键信息，以及帧间传播（IFS）模块来在不同帧间传播判别性时空信息。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上的实验表明，SSP方法平均比现有SOTA方法提升了2.76%，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过自适应平衡和压缩帧内和帧间的关键时空信息，以互补方式有效传播视频中的判别性信息，显著提升了视频理解性能。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Conclusion: UniGS框架成功实现了高保真多模态3D重建，在几何一致性和重建精度方面表现出色，为3D重建领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and
differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based
on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BEEP3D提出了一种端到端的3D实例分割方法，使用边界框标注作为弱监督信号，通过师生框架生成伪掩码，避免了传统两阶段方法的复杂性和训练时间增加问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全监督的3D实例分割需要密集的点级标注，成本高昂。虽然边界框标注更易获得，但存在重叠区域模糊的问题。现有两阶段方法训练专门的伪标签生成器，增加了训练复杂性和时间。

Method: 采用师生框架，教师模型作为伪标签生成器，通过指数移动平均从学生模型更新。引入基于实例中心的查询精炼来提升位置查询定位，并设计查询一致性损失和掩码特征一致性损失来对齐预测与伪掩码的语义和几何信号。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和S3DIS数据集上的实验表明，BEEP3D在保持计算效率的同时，达到了与最先进弱监督方法相当或更优的性能。

Conclusion: BEEP3D提供了一种高效且有效的端到端解决方案，能够在仅使用边界框标注的情况下实现高质量的3D实例分割，显著降低了标注成本。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法在传递多模态大语言模型的视觉感知能力方面效果不佳，主要原因是学生和教师模型之间的视觉注意力不匹配。

Method: 提出CompoDistill框架，通过显式对齐学生和教师模型的视觉注意力来增强学生的视觉感知能力。

Result: 在需要视觉感知能力的组合推理任务上性能显著提升，同时在视觉问答任务上保持良好表现，且在不同骨干网络上均有效。

Conclusion: CompoDistill通过视觉注意力对齐有效解决了MLLM知识蒸馏中的视觉感知能力传递问题，具有良好的通用性。

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Result: 在CASME-II、SAMM和MMEW三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法持续优于传统的单相位动态图像方法。

Conclusion: 明确建模时间相位信息对微表情识别至关重要，为推进该领域提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our

*Ye Chen,Liming Tan,Yupeng Zhu,Yuanbin Wang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用时空一致代理节点来表示视频中动态变化对象/场景的新方法，克服了传统像素级匹配和跟踪的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频表示方法过度依赖不稳定且过于细粒度的运动和外观建模先验（如像素级匹配和跟踪），跟踪误差、遮挡和大范围运动会导致视觉对象表示崩溃。

Method: 使用分层代理节点稳定表达视觉对象的多尺度结构，通过动态表示更新机制利用视频的时空先验，并采用形状和纹理表示的分离编码方式。

Result: 实验表明，该方法以更少的参数实现了高视频重建精度，并支持复杂的视频处理任务，包括视频修复和基于关键帧的时间一致性视频编辑。

Conclusion: 提出的代理节点表示方法能够有效处理跟踪误差、长期运动、遮挡和视角变化，同时支持可控和细粒度的外观编辑能力。

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

*Yuto Yokoi,Kazuhiro Hotta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数：乘法损失和置信度自适应乘法损失，用于医学和细胞图像的语义分割，在数据稀缺情况下优于传统的交叉熵和Dice损失组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像由于隐私、伦理和标注成本高而面临数据稀缺问题，传统的交叉熵和Dice损失加法组合对超参数敏感且在有限数据下表现不佳，需要更鲁棒高效的训练目标。

Method: 乘法损失将交叉熵和Dice损失相乘，基于预测置信度动态调节梯度；置信度自适应乘法损失在此基础上应用置信度驱动的指数缩放，整合预测概率和Dice系数来强调困难样本。

Result: 在细胞和医学分割基准测试中，该框架始终优于调优的加法损失和现有损失函数，在极端数据稀缺情况下提供更稳健的分割性能。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种简单、有效且无需超参数调整的机制，在具有挑战性的数据限制下实现鲁棒的语义分割。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用ID图像背景特征作为伪OOD特征的新OOD检测方法，通过降低背景特征的L2范数来缓解模型对OOD数据的过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络在OOD数据上产生过度自信预测的问题，避免传统方法需要收集辅助OOD数据集或生成伪OOD图像的高成本限制。

Method: 基于ID图像与OOD图像背景区域相似的观察，利用卷积的局部不变性从ID图像中提取背景特征作为模拟OOD特征，通过优化降低这些特征的L2范数来训练模型。

Result: 在多个标准OOD检测基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，与现有后处理方法具有广泛组合兼容性，达到了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效缓解OOD检测中的过度自信问题，无需额外OOD数据，具有实用性和兼容性优势。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出AngularFuse框架，通过跨模态互补掩码模块、细粒度参考图像合成策略和角度感知损失函数，解决了可见光-红外图像融合中细节缺失和亮度不均的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督融合方法依赖手工设计的损失函数，存在参考图像细节不足、亮度不均，以及梯度损失只关注梯度幅值而忽略方向的问题。

Method: 1. 跨模态互补掩码模块强制网络学习模态间互补信息；2. 结合拉普拉斯边缘增强和自适应直方图均衡化生成细节更丰富、亮度更平衡的参考图像；3. 引入角度感知损失，同时约束梯度域中的梯度幅值和方向。

Result: 在MSRS、RoadScene和M3FD公开数据集上的综合实验表明，AngularFuse明显优于现有主流方法，在挑战性场景中产生更清晰、更详细的结果。

Conclusion: AngularFuse通过同时考虑梯度幅值和方向，能够更好地保留纹理强度和正确的边缘方向，展示了优越的融合能力。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估一般医学任务，无法充分评估在依赖视觉输入的脊柱等细粒度领域的性能，因此需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 通过整合和标准化开源脊柱疾病数据集的图像标签对，构建包含脊柱疾病诊断和脊柱病变定位两个临床任务的VQA基准，并为每个VQA对基于视觉相似性采样具有挑战性的负样本选项。

Result: 评估了12个领先的MLLMs，结果显示这些模型在脊柱任务上表现不佳，突显了当前MLLM在脊柱领域的局限性。

Conclusion: SpineBench揭示了当前MLLM在脊柱医学应用中的不足，为未来改进提供了指导，该基准已公开可用。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

TL;DR: PAGS是一个基于语义优先级的3D动态城市场景重建框架，通过语义引导的剪枝和优先级驱动渲染，在保持关键对象细节的同时大幅提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3D城市场景重建方法在保真度和计算成本之间存在明显权衡，因为它们采用语义无关的设计，对静态背景和安全关键对象分配相同资源。

Method: 1. 语义引导剪枝与正则化策略：使用混合重要性度量，简化非关键场景元素，同时保留导航关键对象的精细细节。2. 优先级驱动渲染管线：基于优先级的深度预传递，积极剔除被遮挡基元，加速最终着色计算。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上的实验表明，PAGS实现了卓越的重建质量（特别是安全关键对象），同时显著减少训练时间，渲染速度超过350 FPS。

Conclusion: PAGS通过注入任务感知语义优先级，有效解决了3D动态场景重建中保真度与效率的权衡问题，为自动驾驶提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

TL;DR: 提出DL-DKD++框架，通过动态知识蒸馏从大型视觉语言预训练模型向轻量级PRVR网络迁移知识，解决部分相关视频检索问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中视频通常未经修剪且包含复杂背景内容，而现有方法假设视频已修剪且仅包含文本相关内容，因此需要解决更实用的部分相关视频检索任务。

Method: 采用双学习框架，包含继承分支吸收教师模型的可迁移知识，探索分支学习PRVR数据集的任务特定信息，并引入动态软目标构建机制。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet和Charades-STA数据集上实现了最先进的PRVR性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的DL-DKD++框架能有效处理未修剪长视频中的部分相关性检索问题，通过知识蒸馏和动态软目标机制提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型(VLMs)中的logo幻觉问题，即模型在logo不包含可见文字的情况下仍生成品牌名称或文本内容。通过系统测试发现幻觉问题普遍存在，且与投影器子空间密切相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面取得显著进展，但在幻觉问题上仍然脆弱，特别是针对logo这种不包含可见文字但模型仍生成品牌名称的情况，这一被忽视的问题需要深入研究。

Method: 使用纯符号、混合和带文本logo的精选数据集，以及Hard-60挑战子集，系统测量主流VLMs的幻觉程度。通过九种结构化扰动测试鲁棒性，并对LLaVA进行嵌入层分析以识别幻觉来源。

Result: 研究发现幻觉问题在各种扰动下持续存在，遮挡暴露了最严重的弱点。嵌入分析显示幻觉与投影器的小部分维度相关，针对性消融能显著减少错误同时保持OCR准确性。

Conclusion: VLMs往往依赖符号先验而非真正的字形感知，特别是对于标志性圆形logo。投影器子空间在这种失败模式中起决定性作用，投影器解耦和OCR引导解码是构建更可信多模态系统的有前景方向。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place

Motivation: 现有SSC方法缺乏显式运动推理，在处理遮挡和噪声深度监督时表现不佳，需要改进时序一致性和动态物体理解。

Method: 使用预训练光流进行多级特征对齐，结合课程学习从稀疏LiDAR深度渐进过渡到密集立体深度，并利用SAM提供语义先验监督。

Conclusion: CurriFlow通过光流时序对齐和课程深度融合，显著提升了相机基3D语义场景补全的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Motivation: 深度神经网络性能提升往往伴随计算复杂度和成本的增加，特别是在3D体积或视频分类任务中，由于固有的冗余性，并非所有切片或帧都是必要的。现有方法虽然解决了不可微问题，但缺乏输入自适应性。

Method: 使用注意力引导的采样模块，该模块在推理时能够根据输入动态调整采样策略，克服了传统方法只能任务自适应而不能输入自适应的问题。

Result: 在MedMNIST3D医学影像数据集和两个超声视频数据集上验证了方法的有效性，其中一个是在真实临床条件下收集的具有挑战性的内部数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的动态自适应采样方法能够在减少计算复杂度的同时提升性能，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

Motivation: 现有的最先进模型仅依赖检测单个视频帧中的装配对象状态，忽略了时间特征，导致在对象部分遮挡时模型的鲁棒性和准确性受限。

Method: 提出双流框架：装配状态检测流在无遮挡视图下有效操作；时空流包含空间编码器和基于transformer的时间编码器，能够捕获空间和时间特征来识别步骤完成，即使在部分遮挡情况下。

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上评估，相比先前方法，将实际和预测装配步骤完成之间的平均延迟分别减少了11.2%和26.1%。

Conclusion: STORM-PSR通过时空流在不依赖对象无遮挡视图的情况下推断完成步骤，显著减少了识别延迟，提高了程序步骤识别的性能。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

Motivation: 当训练图像缺乏足够的多视角约束时，场景坐标回归模型会退化。需要引入先验知识来约束学习过程，使预测的3D场景点更符合合理的几何结构。

Method: 提出了场景坐标回归模型的概率重解释方法，融入了多种先验：从简单的重建深度值分布先验，到基于大规模室内扫描数据训练的3D点云扩散模型的学习先验。这些先验在每个训练步骤中将预测的3D场景点推向合理的几何结构。

Result: 在三个室内数据集上，先验方法帮助学习了更好的场景表示，产生了更连贯的场景点云、更高的配准率和更好的相机位姿，对下游任务如新视角合成和相机重定位有积极影响。

Conclusion: 通过融入高层次重建先验，能够有效提升场景坐标回归模型的性能，特别是在训练数据多视角约束不足的情况下，显著改善了场景重建质量和下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

### [109] [Low-Field Magnetic Resonance Image Quality Enhancement using a Conditional Flow Matching Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12408)
*Huu Tien Nguyen,Ahmed Karam Eldaly*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于条件流匹配（CFM）的图像质量迁移框架，用于从低场MRI重建高场质量图像，在保持最先进性能的同时显著减少参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场磁共振成像（LF-MRI）虽然成本低且便携，但信噪比低、诊断质量差，需要一种无需昂贵基础设施就能提升图像质量的方法。

Method: 使用条件流匹配（CFM）框架，通过直接回归最优速度场来学习噪声分布与目标数据分布之间的连续流，避免了传统生成模型的迭代采样或对抗目标。

Result: CFM在低场MRI到高场质量图像的重建中实现了最先进的性能，对分布内和分布外数据都具有鲁棒性，且参数数量显著少于竞争深度学习方法。

Conclusion: CFM作为一种强大且可扩展的MRI重建工具，在资源有限的临床环境中具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

TL;DR: VideoLucy是一个基于深度记忆回溯的长视频理解框架，通过分层记忆结构和迭代回溯机制解决现有方法在时序上下文和关键信息保留方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代理系统在长视频理解中面临两个主要挑战：难以捕捉连续帧的时序上下文，以及稀疏帧采样可能丢失关键信息。

Method: 采用分层记忆结构，通过基于代理的迭代回溯机制，从粗到细地挖掘视频范围内的深度记忆，直到收集足够信息来提供答案。

Result: 在多个长视频理解基准测试中显著优于现有最先进方法，性能甚至超过GPT-4o等专有模型。

Conclusion: VideoLucy框架通过深度记忆回溯机制有效解决了长视频理解中的时序建模和关键信息保留问题，展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at
https://videolucy.github.io

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文是第一篇关于纵向放射学报告生成(LRRG)的全面综述，填补了现有调查主要关注单图像胸部X光报告生成的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光成像在现代医学中广泛应用，给放射科医生带来沉重工作负担。传统方法依赖单张图像，无法捕捉纵向上下文来生成临床准确的比较陈述。现有调查对纵向设置指导有限，研究人员缺乏系统性的模型设计框架。

Method: 本综述系统性地回顾了纵向放射学报告生成，包括数据集构建策略、报告生成架构及其纵向定制设计、评估协议（涵盖纵向特定指标和广泛使用的基准）。

Result: 总结了LRRG方法的性能表现，分析了不同的消融研究，共同突出了纵向信息和架构设计选择在提高模型性能中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 总结了当前研究的五大主要局限性，并概述了未来发展的有前景方向，旨在为推进这一新兴领域奠定基础。

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-GAGA是一个两阶段框架，用于在黑盒设置下生成可转移且视觉不可察觉的对抗样本攻击深度伪造检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在深度伪造检测器的黑盒设置中，难以同时保证高转移性和视觉不可察觉性。

Method: 第一阶段使用双流攻击模块：MNTD-PGD优化小扰动预算的梯度计算，SG-PGD聚焦视觉显著区域扰动；第二阶段通过度量感知选择模块评估候选样本的成功率和结构相似性。

Result: 相比最先进攻击方法，MS-GAGA在未见检测器上实现了高达27%的误分类率提升。

Conclusion: MS-GAGA通过联合优化转移性和不可察觉性，有效提升了对抗样本在黑盒深度伪造检测器上的攻击效果。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

TL;DR: 提出早期融合框架，在数据增强前结合文本和视觉特征，保持空间一致性，解决传统增强方法破坏图像-文本对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强方法（如旋转、翻转）会破坏医学图像分割中图像与文本的空间对齐，影响多模态学习性能。

Method: 采用早期融合框架，在增强前融合文本和视觉特征；设计轻量级生成器将文本嵌入投影到视觉空间，弥合语义鸿沟。

Result: 在三个医学成像任务和四个分割框架上评估，达到最先进水平；可视化显示生成的伪图像能准确定位区域。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效保持空间一致性，提升多模态医学图像分割性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly
available on GitHub: https://github.com/11yxk/MedSeg_EarlyFusion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting框架，解决从运动模糊图像重建3D场景的挑战，通过两阶段优化相机姿态和全局刚性变换来消除运动模糊失真。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS去模糊方法性能受限，对相机姿态精度极度依赖且无法有效控制运动模糊导致的错误高斯基元密集化。

Method: 采用双阶段框架：1)相机姿态细化粗略优化相机姿态；2)全局刚性变换校正运动模糊失真。引入子帧梯度聚合策略和时空双阶段优化策略。

Result: 综合实验验证了该去模糊方法的有效性，并显示其优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: BSGS框架能够准确从运动模糊图像重建3D场景，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级、无网络的VAD方法，直接从无向点云计算UDF，通过Voronoi辅助扩散解决现有神经方法的不稳定性和高计算成本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经方法学习UDF存在数值不稳定、计算成本高和可控性有限的问题，需要一种更稳定高效的方法来处理各种拓扑结构的3D形状。

Method: 使用Voronoi辅助扩散：1) 基于Voronoi几何准则为输入点分配双向法向量；2) 通过能量函数优化法向量对齐；3) 扩散法向量形成近似UDF梯度场；4) 积分得到最终UDF。

Result: 实验表明VAD能稳健处理水密和开放表面，以及复杂的非流形和非定向几何结构，同时保持计算高效和稳定。

Conclusion: VAD提供了一种计算高效、稳定的UDF计算方法，能够处理各种复杂几何拓扑，优于现有神经方法。

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖过度参数化的输入特征和辅助损失，但扩散模型理论上不需要这些策略就能匹配人体运动分布。

Method: 使用分数扩散模型，结合特征空间归一化和理论推导的L2分数匹配损失权重，直接生成运动和形状。

Result: 在无条件人体运动生成任务上达到了与最先进方法相当的结果，避免了缓慢的关节形状后处理。

Conclusion: 通过理论驱动的组件设计和针对性消融实验，证明了所提方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模仿学习泛化能力差，强化学习样本效率低且收敛不稳定，需要结合两者优势

Method: 竞争式双策略框架，让IL和RL智能体在训练中交互，通过竞争机制促进知识交换并避免梯度冲突

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上碰撞率降低18%，泛化能力更强，长尾场景表现更好

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD框架有效结合IL和RL优势，显著提升自动驾驶性能

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB跟踪算法在无人机视角下因空间外观线索退化而可靠性不足，多光谱图像能提供光谱反射率增强目标区分能力，但缺乏专用多光谱无人机数据集阻碍了该领域发展。

Method: 提出多光谱和方向感知的MOT方案：轻量级光谱3D-Stem集成光谱特征并保持RGB预训练兼容性；方向感知卡尔曼滤波器进行精确状态估计；端到端方向自适应transformer。

Result: 广泛实验表明，多光谱输入相比RGB基线显著提升了跟踪性能，特别是对小目标和密集物体的跟踪效果改善明显。

Conclusion: MMOT基准和提出的方法将推动无人机多光谱多目标跟踪研究的发展，相关数据集、代码和基准已公开。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有基于交叉注意力机制的方法主要捕获全局交互，但难以维持逐步的时间对齐，导致生成的运动与条件输入的时间模式不一致。

Method: 将条件信息整合到Mamba块的循环动态中，通过时序条件Mamba模型实现更好的时间对齐运动生成。

Result: 在多种人类运动任务上的实验表明，该方法在时间对齐、运动真实性和条件一致性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TCM模型通过将条件信息融入Mamba的循环动态，有效解决了时序对齐问题，为基于时间相关输入信号的人类运动生成提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

Result: 在四个不同复杂度的公开数据集上评估，Plantnet微调DinoV2相比基础DinoV2模型在Jaccard指数上获得一致性能提升

Conclusion: 结合基础模型与植物专用模型可以有效缓解标注瓶颈，在多样化农业场景中实现有效分割

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

TL;DR: LayerSync是一种领域无关的方法，通过使用扩散模型自身的中间表示作为内在指导来提升生成质量和训练效率，无需外部监督或预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明扩散模型的生成质量与中间表示相关，外部指导能加速训练。本文重新思考这一范式，旨在通过模型自身丰富的表示来指导较弱的表示，减少对外部监督的依赖。

Method: LayerSync是一种自给自足的即插即用正则化方法，利用扩散模型各层表示质量的差异，让语义最丰富的表示作为内在指导来正则化较弱的表示。

Result: 在图像生成任务上显著提升训练效率和生成质量，例如在ImageNet数据集上加速基于流的transformer训练8.75倍，生成质量提升23.6%。方法还适用于音频、视频和运动生成等其他模态。

Conclusion: LayerSync是一种有效且通用的正则化方法，能够在不增加训练开销的情况下，通过模型内部表示的自同步机制持续提升扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决像素空间生成模型训练困难、性能不如潜在空间模型的问题，缩小两者之间的性能和效率差距。

Method: 两阶段训练框架：第一阶段预训练编码器捕获干净图像的语义信息并与确定性采样轨迹对齐；第二阶段将编码器与随机初始化解码器结合，对完整模型进行端到端微调。

Result: 在ImageNet-256上扩散模型FID达到2.04，ImageNet-512上达到2.35（75 NFE），大幅超越先前像素空间方法；一致性模型在ImageNet-256上单步采样FID达到8.82，显著优于潜在空间对应模型。

Conclusion: 该框架成功缩小了像素空间与潜在空间生成模型的性能差距，首次实现了无需预训练VAE或扩散模型的高分辨率图像一致性模型训练。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态潜在推理方法IVT-LR，通过在潜在空间中结合视觉和文本信息进行推理，解决了现有方法需要大量标注数据和推理延迟高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理方法依赖显式推理步骤，需要大量视觉-文本标注且推理延迟高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出IVT-LR方法，在潜在空间中结合潜在文本（前一步隐藏状态）和潜在视觉（选定的图像嵌入）来表示推理步骤，采用渐进式多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在M3CoT和ScienceQA数据集上，IVT-LR方法平均准确率提升5.45%，同时推理速度比现有方法快5倍以上。

Conclusion: IVT-LR方法有效提升了多模态推理的性能和效率，证明了潜在空间推理的可行性。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

Motivation: 现有方法忽视了水下成像的物理原理，或将水下图像退化现象简单视为干扰因素，未能充分利用其中包含的有价值信息。

Method: 基于整流流的框架，将水下物理成像信息作为显式先验直接融入网络训练过程，并引入时间维度建模。

Result: 在USOD10K数据集上，WaterFlow在S_m指标上获得0.072的提升，证明了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: 通过将物理成像信息作为先验并引入时间建模，显著增强了模型的水下显著目标识别能力。

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

Motivation: 现有零样本去噪方法训练时间长，且依赖噪声独立性和零均值假设，限制了在真实世界复杂噪声场景中的有效性。

Method: 利用图像纹理在不同频带具有位置相似性和内容一致性的特性，而噪声不具备这种特性，开发了跨频一致性损失和超轻量网络实现图像去噪。

Result: 在多个真实世界图像数据集上的实验表明，ZSCFC在计算效率和去噪性能方面优于其他最先进的零样本方法。

Conclusion: ZSCFC方法为真实世界去噪提供了一种高效有效的解决方案，不依赖噪声分布假设，仅需单张噪声图像即可完成训练和去噪。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

TL;DR: 本文开发了轻量级的人体网格恢复和姿态估计模型，通过利用分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段作为编码器，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SOTA方法依赖大型非分层视觉变换器作为编码器，计算成本高。本文旨在开发简单高效的模型，通过利用分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段来优化计算效率与性能的平衡。

Method: 1) 构建三个轻量级HMR2.0变体；2) 提出使用分层视觉基础模型（Swin Transformer、GroupMixFormer、VMamba）的早期阶段作为编码器；3) 仅使用前2-3个阶段而非完整模型。

Result: 评估了27个基于分层VFM的模型，发现仅使用前2-3个阶段就能达到与完整模型相当的性能，且在准确性与计算效率之间展现出更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 分层视觉基础模型的早期阶段能够有效用于人体网格恢复和姿态估计任务，在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本，优于现有轻量级替代方案。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

Motivation: 地球观测卫星产生大量多光谱时序图像数据，现有压缩方法存在碎片化问题，缺乏公开预训练模型，图像编解码器忽略时间冗余，视频编解码器无法捕捉静态场景的辐射演化特征。

Method: 提出TEC系列编解码器，包括适应多光谱输入的高效图像版本和利用时间依赖性的时序Transformer模型(TEC-TT)，并引入Latent Repacking方法训练灵活码率的Transformer模型。

Result: 在Sentinel-2数据上，TEC比传统编解码器在同等图像质量下实现3-10倍更强的压缩性能，TEC-TT在AllClear基准测试中零样本云修复性能超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 专门设计的深度学习压缩算法是地球观测数据处理的可行方向，代码和模型权重将开源发布。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Conclusion: 提出的多无人机协同占用预测框架有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在保持高精度的同时大幅降低了通信开销。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

Result: 在OSDG-NL任务上超越现有方法，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: EReLiFM通过证据可靠性感知和残差流匹配有效解决了带噪声标签的开集域泛化问题

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

Motivation: Transformer模型在医学影像中表现优异但容易学习虚假相关性，导致偏见和泛化能力有限。人工-AI注意力对齐可缓解此问题，但依赖昂贵的监督标注。

Method: 提出混合解释引导学习(H-EGL)框架，结合自监督和人工引导约束。自监督组件利用类别区分性注意力，不依赖限制性先验，提高鲁棒性和灵活性。

Result: 在胸部X光分类任务中使用Vision Transformer验证，H-EGL优于两种最先进的解释引导学习方法，展现出更好的分类准确性和泛化能力，生成的注意力图与人类专家知识更一致。

Conclusion: H-EGL框架有效提升了医学影像中Transformer模型的注意力对齐和泛化性能，为减少对昂贵人工监督的依赖提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

TL;DR: IRIS是首个基于"think with images"范式的基准测试，评估MLLMs在复杂视觉文本任务中的感知、转换和推理能力，包含1,204个跨5个领域的挑战性任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLMs主要将图像视为静态输入，缺乏将视觉内容作为可操作认知工作空间的能力，需要主动进行图像裁剪、编辑等操作来发现关键视觉线索。

Method: 构建IRIS基准测试，包含1,204个开放式的视觉任务（603个单轮，601个多轮），涵盖5个不同领域，并配有详细评分标准进行系统评估。

Result: 当前MLLMs在需要有效整合视觉和通用工具的任务上表现不佳，最强模型GPT-5-think仅达到18.68%通过率。不同模型表现出不同的工具使用行为。

Conclusion: IRIS为推进MLLMs的视觉智能提供了关键见解，揭示了从"think about images"到"think with images"范式转变的重要性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

Motivation: 基础模型在医疗AI中应用面临数据隐私保护和数据不足的挑战，联邦学习可以解决数据共享限制，但需要更好的个性化微调方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的个性化联邦微调方法能够有效利用多方数据，同时保护患者隐私，在医疗AI应用中具有良好前景。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Result: FlashVSR可可靠扩展到超高分辨率，在A100 GPU上达到约17FPS处理速度，比现有一步扩散VSR模型快12倍，性能达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: FlashVSR使基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率变得实用，通过效率、可扩展性和实时性能的突破，为未来高效扩散VSR研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

Motivation: 现有解决方案在场景感知、理解和模拟方面存在分割缺陷、动态物体干扰、传感器数据稀疏和视角限制等问题，需要更全面的解决方案。

Method: 提出SPORTS框架，集成VPS、VO和SR任务：VPS使用自适应注意力几何融合机制对齐跨帧特征；VO结合全景分割结果和光流图改进动态物体置信度估计；SR利用VO结果将稀疏点云转换为神经场进行渲染。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，基于注意力的特征融合方法在里程计、跟踪、分割和新视角合成任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SPORTS框架通过紧密集成多个任务，实现了更全面的场景理解，在多个任务上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Motivation: 现有VQA基准在评估深度语义理解方面存在不足，特别是在视觉艺术分析等复杂领域，问题过于简单，无法捕捉人类视觉查询的多样性和深度，导致模型倾向于利用统计捷径而非进行视觉推理。

Method: 采用新颖的多智能体流水线，让专门化的智能体协作生成经过验证的、语言多样化的复杂问题，构建沿相关视觉理解维度结构化的基准。

Result: 对14个最先进MLLM的评估显示，当前模型存在显著局限性，包括在简单计数任务中的意外弱点，以及专有模型和开源模型之间的明显性能差距。

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench填补了现有VQA基准在深度语义理解评估方面的空白，揭示了当前多模态大语言模型在复杂视觉艺术分析中的不足，为未来模型发展提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

Method: 将相机自运动建模为连续样条，光流建模为隐式神经表示，通过归纳偏置嵌入时空一致性；结合微分几何约束引入结构和运动先验，避免显式深度估计。

Result: 在6-DoF运动场景中表现出色，在无监督方法中达到最先进性能，甚至与有监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow通过隐式正则化在完全无监督范式下统一了自运动和光流估计，解决了事件相机中的不适定问题。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的头部运动校正方法DL-HMC++，通过交叉注意力机制从1秒3D PET原始数据预测刚性头部运动，无需硬件运动追踪设备，在多种PET扫描仪和放射性示踪剂上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 头部运动在脑PET成像中会导致图像伪影和示踪剂摄取量化不准确，而基于硬件的运动追踪在临床实践中应用有限，需要开发数据驱动的运动校正方法。

Method: 使用交叉注意力机制的深度学习模型，利用现有动态PET扫描和外部硬件运动追踪的金标准数据进行监督训练，预测刚性头部运动。

Result: DL-HMC++在两个PET扫描仪和四种示踪剂上均优于现有数据驱动方法，产生的无运动图像与金标准HMT难以区分，标准摄取值差异比平均为1.2±0.5%和0.5±0.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了数据驱动PET头部运动校正的潜力，可消除对硬件运动追踪的依赖，使运动校正技术能够在临床环境中广泛应用。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

Motivation: 现有基于学习的特征上采样方法（如DINO或CLIP）需要为每个特征提取器重新训练，无法在推理时泛化到不同的特征类型，限制了方法的通用性。

Method: 提出了一种推理时的特征无关上采样架构，该架构不依赖于特定编码器训练，能够处理不同类型的视觉特征。

Result: 实验表明AnyUp在特征上采样质量上达到了新的最先进水平，能够泛化到不同特征类型，保持特征语义，且高效易用于各种下游任务。

Conclusion: AnyUp提供了一种通用、高效的特征上采样解决方案，突破了现有方法对特定编码器的依赖，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

Motivation: 虽然高效PSNR导向的超分辨率取得了显著进展，但专注于感知质量指标的方法仍然相对低效，这促使研究者填补这一空白。

Method: 在严格效率约束下开发解决方案，并在包含500张4K测试图像的新数据集上进行评估，该数据集使用多种退化类型进行退化，不提供原始高质量对应图像。

Conclusion: 本文为高效感知超分辨率建立了现代基准。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: USplat4D是一个不确定性感知的动态高斯泼溅框架，通过建模每个高斯的时间变化不确定性来提升4D重建质量，解决遮挡下的运动漂移和极端视角合成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态高斯泼溅模型对所有高斯基元进行统一优化，忽略了它们在不同视角和时间上的观测质量差异，导致遮挡情况下出现运动漂移和极端视角合成质量下降。

Method: 引入时间变化的每个高斯不确定性估计，构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化，将可靠观测的高斯作为运动引导锚点。

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上的实验表明，显式建模不确定性持续改进动态高斯泼溅模型，在遮挡下产生更稳定的几何结构，在极端视角下实现高质量合成。

Conclusion: 不确定性建模对于动态高斯泼溅至关重要，USplat4D通过不确定性感知优化有效提升了4D重建的稳定性和合成质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

*Stefan Andreas Baumann,Nick Stracke,Timy Phan,Björn Ommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow Poke Transformer (FPT) 是一个直接预测局部运动分布的新框架，通过稀疏交互（"pokes"）来预测多模态场景运动，克服传统方法只能生成单一实现的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解物理场景动态需要推理其可能变化的多种方式，特别是局部交互的影响。传统方法通常只能密集采样单一场景动态实现，无法表示多模态运动及其不确定性。

Method: 提出Flow Poke Transformer (FPT)框架，通过稀疏交互（pokes）直接预测局部运动分布，提供可解释的多模态场景运动表示。

Result: 在密集面部运动生成任务中，通用预训练模型超越专用基线；在强分布外任务（如合成数据集）上微调后，在关节物体运动估计中显著优于域内方法；在从pokes进行移动部件分割任务中取得竞争性表现。

Conclusion: FPT框架能够直接预测显式运动分布，在多个下游任务中展现出卓越的灵活性和性能，证明了其方法的通用性和有效性。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

TL;DR: SRUM是一个自奖励后训练框架，通过让统一多模态模型的理解模块评估生成模块，实现自我改进，无需额外人工标注数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型中，强大的视觉理解能力无法有效迁移到视觉生成任务，导致理解与生成之间存在显著差距。

Method: 设计了全局-局部双奖励系统：全局奖励确保整体视觉语义和布局正确性，局部奖励细化细粒度对象级保真度。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench上从82.18提升到88.37，在T2I-ReasonBench上从43.82提升到46.75。

Conclusion: 建立了一个新范式，使统一多模态模型能够通过自奖励机制，用理解模块指导和增强自身的生成能力。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

Motivation: 传统创建逼真数字人化身的过程昂贵耗时，现有单图像方法在视角偏离参考图像时质量下降，缺乏多视角约束和显式3D表示。

Method: 基于预训练视频扩散模型，从单张参考图像和目标表情生成多视角视频，可同时生成数百帧360度环绕视角内容，并蒸馏为4D化身。

Result: 相比先前方法，显著提升了生成化身的真实感、时间一致性和3D一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法降低了数字人化身创建门槛，实现了从单图像生成高质量多视角动画的能力。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

TL;DR: UniFusion是一个基于扩散的生成模型，使用冻结的大型视觉语言模型作为统一多模态编码器，通过层注意力池化机制提取文本和视觉token的语义和细节信息，实现了跨模态知识迁移和推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉生成架构依赖独立的图像和文本编码器，限制了扩散模型的跨模态推理和知识迁移能力。现有方法要么使用VLM的最后一层信息，要么需要训练大型统一模型，计算资源需求大且可访问性有限。

Method: 提出Layerwise Attention Pooling (LAP)机制从冻结VLM中提取多层级信息；提出VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexible Inference (VERIFI)方法，仅基于VLM生成的文本token进行扩散变换器条件化；通过编辑任务微调实现知识迁移。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐方面优于其他浅层融合架构；模型在单图像编辑训练后能够零样本泛化到多图像参考；展示了跨模态知识迁移和强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniFusion的统一编码器设计证明了其在跨模态推理、知识迁移和编辑任务中的有效性，为多模态生成提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs因图像输入引入额外视觉token导致推理成本增加

Method: 使用不同压缩比的MLP连接器下采样视觉token，训练时最小化不同连接器响应的KL散度，推理时通过ViR路由器自动选择压缩率

Result: 视觉token数量减少50%，同时保持模型的感知、推理和OCR能力

Conclusion: ViCO方法有助于开发更高效的MLLMs

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

Motivation: CMP虽然为图像拓扑分析提供了强大工具，但由于多滤过结构的复杂性和向量化困难，其应用受到限制。

Method: 提出新算法向量化立方复形的MP同调，将CMP分解为可学习的单参数持久性组合，联合学习双滤过函数，具有可微性。

Result: 在基准医学影像和计算机视觉数据集上的实验显示，CuMPerLay在分类和分割性能上表现优异，特别是在数据有限场景中。

Conclusion: CuMPerLay为将全局结构信息集成到深度网络中进行结构化图像分析提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

Conclusion: 世界建模为VLA模型提供了有效的密集自监督信号，能够充分利用模型表征能力，在驾驶智能任务中取得显著性能提升，且具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

TL;DR: DeepMMSearch-R1是首个能够按需进行多轮网络搜索并为图像和文本搜索工具动态构建查询的多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段训练流程解决了现有方法在信息搜索和知识密集型查询中的效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的多模态大语言模型需要访问外部知识源并响应动态变化的信息，但现有方法存在流程僵化、搜索调用过多和查询构建不佳等问题，导致效率低下和结果不理想。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：冷启动监督微调阶段和在线强化学习优化。引入DeepMMSearchVQA数据集，这是一个通过自动化流程创建的多模态VQA数据集，包含多样化的多跳查询，整合文本和视觉信息。

Result: 在多个知识密集型基准测试中进行了广泛实验，证明了该方法的优越性。模型能够基于输入图像的相关裁剪启动网络搜索，使图像搜索更有效，并能基于检索信息迭代调整文本搜索查询。

Conclusion: 该方法为推进多模态网络搜索提供了有价值的见解，通过动态查询构建和迭代调整实现了更高效的信息检索。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

TL;DR: 提出基于单调包含范式的张量补全框架GTCTV DPC，结合广义低秩先验和深度伪收缩去噪器，在Davis-Yin分裂方案基础上建立全局收敛性，在低采样率下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多维数据中的缺失条目给实际应用带来挑战，现有方法依赖经验收敛或不切实际的假设（如深度去噪器作为隐式正则化器的近端算子），需要更严谨的理论基础。

Method: 基于单调包含范式，统一广义低秩先验和深度伪收缩去噪器，扩展传统凸优化范围，在Davis-Yin分裂方案基础上开发GTCTV DPC算法。

Result: GTCTV DPC在定量指标和视觉质量上一致优于现有方法，特别是在低采样率下表现突出。

Conclusion: 所提框架为张量补全提供了理论严谨且性能优越的解决方案，特别适用于低采样率场景。

Abstract: Missing entries in multi dimensional data pose significant challenges for
downstream analysis across diverse real world applications. These data are
naturally modeled as tensors, and recent completion methods integrating global
low rank priors with plug and play denoisers have demonstrated strong empirical
performance. However, these approaches often rely on empirical convergence
alone or unrealistic assumptions, such as deep denoisers acting as proximal
operators of implicit regularizers, which generally does not hold. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel tensor completion framework grounded in
the monotone inclusion paradigm, which unifies generalized low rank priors with
deep pseudo contractive denoisers and extends beyond traditional convex
optimization. Building on the Davis Yin splitting scheme, we develop the GTCTV
DPC algorithm and rigorously establish its global convergence. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GTCTV DPC consistently outperforms existing
methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, particularly at low
sampling rates.

*Marcus Emmanuel Barnes,Taher A. Ghaleb,Safwat Hassan*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本文提出将LLM的token预算视为注意力预算，将任务感知的文本缩减作为语言-数据系统的核心设计原则，以解决现实世界文本密集型数据（如日志、遥测数据）在LLM应用中面临的成本、可持续性和任务对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在数据密集型工作流中的应用受到现实世界文本数据量大、冗长和噪声多的限制。直接将这些数据输入LLM成本高、环境不可持续，且往往与任务目标不匹配。现有LLM效率优化主要关注模型或架构层面，而上游输入冗长缩减的研究不足。

Method: 将输入侧缩减视为注意力分配而非压缩，优先保留与下游任务最相关的信息。提出构建基准测试、设计自适应缩减流程、将token预算感知预处理集成到数据库和检索系统中的研究挑战。

Result: 提出了将LLM token预算重新定义为注意力预算的新视角，确立了任务感知文本缩减作为语言-数据系统设计原则的地位。

Conclusion: 通过将稀缺的注意力资源引导到噪声数据密集型工作流中的有意义信号，可以实现可扩展、准确和可持续的LLM-数据集成。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to data-intensive
workflows, from database querying to developer observability. Yet the
effectiveness of these systems is constrained by the volume, verbosity, and
noise of real-world text-rich data such as logs, telemetry, and monitoring
streams. Feeding such data directly into LLMs is costly, environmentally
unsustainable, and often misaligned with task objectives. Parallel efforts in
LLM efficiency have focused on model- or architecture-level optimizations, but
the challenge of reducing upstream input verbosity remains underexplored. In
this paper, we argue for treating the token budget of an LLM as an attention
budget and elevating task-aware text reduction as a first-class design
principle for language -- data systems. We position input-side reduction not as
compression, but as attention allocation: prioritizing information most
relevant to downstream tasks. We outline open research challenges for building
benchmarks, designing adaptive reduction pipelines, and integrating
token-budget--aware preprocessing into database and retrieval systems. Our
vision is to channel scarce attention resources toward meaningful signals in
noisy, data-intensive workflows, enabling scalable, accurate, and sustainable
LLM--data integration.

TL;DR: AI算法HLSE在哈佛创新挑战赛的评委分配任务中，与人类专家表现相当，无显著差异，同时大幅提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI在需要语义理解和领域知识的复杂决策任务中，是否能达到人类专家水平，特别是在评委分配这种高要求场景。

Method: 开发了混合词汇-语义相似度集成算法(HLSE)，并在真实竞赛环境中部署，与人类专家分配结果进行盲评对比。

Result: 算法与人工分配在匹配质量上无显著差异(AUC=0.48, p=0.40)，算法平均得分3.90，人工3.94(5分制)，但算法将原本需要一周的工作缩短至几小时。

Conclusion: HLSE算法在评委分配任务中达到了人类专家水平，同时提供了更好的可扩展性和效率，展示了AI在高风险决策场景中的潜力。

Abstract: There is growing interest in applying artificial intelligence (AI) to
automate and support complex decision-making tasks. However, it remains unclear
how algorithms compare to human judgment in contexts requiring semantic
understanding and domain expertise. We examine this in the context of the judge
assignment problem, matching submissions to suitably qualified judges.
Specifically, we tackled this problem at the Harvard President's Innovation
Challenge, the university's premier venture competition awarding over \$500,000
to student and alumni startups. This represents a real-world environment where
high-quality judge assignment is essential. We developed an AI-based
judge-assignment algorithm, Hybrid Lexical-Semantic Similarity Ensemble (HLSE),
and deployed it at the competition. We then evaluated its performance against
human expert assignments using blinded match-quality scores from judges on
$309$ judge-venture pairs. Using a Mann-Whitney U statistic based test, we
found no statistically significant difference in assignment quality between the
two approaches ($AUC=0.48, p=0.40$); on average, algorithmic matches are rated
$3.90$ and manual matches $3.94$ on a 5-point scale, where 5 indicates an
excellent match. Furthermore, manual assignments that previously required a
full week could be automated in several hours by the algorithm during
deployment. These results demonstrate that HLSE achieves human-expert-level
matching quality while offering greater scalability and efficiency,
underscoring the potential of AI-driven solutions to support and enhance human
decision-making for judge assignment in high-stakes settings.

Main category: q-bio.NC

TL;DR: MAPS是一种行为验证的计算工具，通过将神经网络归因图转换为解释掩蔽图像，比较人类在这些最小化图像上的识别准确率，从而评估不同ANN可解释性方法并找到与生物视觉最一致的组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类核心物体识别依赖于视觉信息的选择性使用，但指导这些选择的策略难以直接测量。需要一种方法来测试神经网络解释是否也能解释人类视觉。

Method: MAPS将归因图转换为解释掩蔽图像(EMIs)，在有限像素预算下比较人类在这些最小化图像与完整刺激物上的识别准确率差异。

Result: 在计算机模拟中，EMI行为相似性可靠地恢复了归因图计算的地面真实相似性。应用于人类和猕猴时，MAPS识别出与生物视觉最一致的ANN-解释组合，达到Bubble掩蔽的行为有效性但需要更少行为试验。

Conclusion: MAPS提供了一种可扩展工具，仅需模型归因和少量原始图像行为数据即可评估解释方法，在共同标准下连接人类行为、神经活动和模型决策。

Abstract: Human core object recognition depends on the selective use of visual
information, but the strategies guiding these choices are difficult to measure
directly. We present MAPS (Masked Attribution-based Probing of Strategies), a
behaviorally validated computational tool that tests whether explanations
derived from artificial neural networks (ANNs) can also explain human vision.
MAPS converts attribution maps into explanation-masked images (EMIs) and
compares image-by-image human accuracies on these minimal images with limited
pixel budgets with accuracies on the full stimuli. MAPS provides a principled
way to evaluate and choose among competing ANN interpretability methods. In
silico, EMI-based behavioral similarity between models reliably recovers the
ground-truth similarity computed from their attribution maps, establishing
which explanation methods best capture the model's strategy. When applied to
humans and macaques, MAPS identifies ANN-explanation combinations whose
explanations align most closely with biological vision, achieving the
behavioral validity of Bubble masks while requiring far fewer behavioral
trials. Because it needs only access to model attributions and a modest set of
behavioral data on the original images, MAPS avoids exhaustive psychophysics
while offering a scalable tool for adjudicating explanations and linking human
behavior, neural activity, and model decisions under a common standard.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了多向量稠密检索模型中单层线性投影的局限性，提出用更复杂的前馈网络（如深层非线性FFN块、GLU块和跳跃连接）替代，实验证明这种改进能显著提升ColBERT模型的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多向量稠密检索方法如ColBERT通常使用单层线性投影来降低向量维度，但MaxSim算子对训练梯度流的影响表明这种简单投影存在固有局限性。

Method: 设计并系统评估了多种替代投影块，包括深层非线性FFN块、GLU块和跳跃连接，通过消融研究分析各参数对性能的影响。

Result: 许多投影变体优于原始线性投影，最佳变体在多个检索基准上的平均性能提升超过2 NDCG@10点，且效果在不同随机种子下保持一致。

Conclusion: 替换ColBERT模型的线性层为更复杂的投影块是一个稳健的即插即用升级方案，能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multi-vector dense retrieval methods like ColBERT systematically use a
single-layer linear projection to reduce the dimensionality of individual
vectors. In this study, we explore the implications of the MaxSim operator on
the gradient flows of the training of multi-vector models and show that such a
simple linear projection has inherent, if non-critical, limitations in this
setting. We then discuss the theoretical improvements that could result from
replacing this single-layer projection with well-studied alternative
feedforward linear networks (FFN), such as deeper, non-linear FFN blocks, GLU
blocks, and skip-connections, could alleviate these limitations. Through the
design and systematic evaluation of alternate projection blocks, we show that
better-designed final projections positively impact the downstream performance
of ColBERT models. We highlight that many projection variants outperform the
original linear projections, with the best-performing variants increasing
average performance on a range of retrieval benchmarks across domains by over 2
NDCG@10 points. We then conduct further exploration on the individual
parameters of these projections block in order to understand what drives this
empirical performance, highlighting the particular importance of upscaled
intermediate projections and residual connections. As part of these ablation
studies, we show that numerous suboptimal projection variants still outperform
the traditional single-layer projection across multiple benchmarks, confirming
our hypothesis. Finally, we observe that this effect is consistent across
random seeds, further confirming that replacing the linear layer of ColBERT
models is a robust, drop-in upgrade.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRAG作为一种新兴的RAG形式，将文档编码为模型参数进行参数级交互，但其机制尚不明确。本文旨在阐明参数注入的作用机制。

Method: 系统研究PRAG，分析参数化文档与文本文档的交互效果，比较单独使用和联合使用的性能差异。

Result: 参数化文档仅包含部分语义信息，单独使用性能较差；但与文本文档结合时，能增强模型对输入文档的理解，提高抗噪能力，性能优于单独使用任一方式。

Conclusion: 建议联合使用参数化和文本文档，并提升参数化表示的信息含量以推进PRAG发展。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
retrieving external documents. As an emerging form of RAG, parametric
retrieval-augmented generation (PRAG) encodes documents as model parameters
(i.e., LoRA modules) and injects these representations into the model during
inference, enabling interaction between the LLM and documents at parametric
level. Compared with directly placing documents in the input context, PRAG is
more efficient and has the potential to offer deeper model-document
interaction. Despite its growing attention, the mechanism underlying parametric
injection remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic
study of PRAG to clarify the role of parametric injection, showing that
parameterized documents capture only partial semantic information of documents,
and relying on them alone yields inferior performance compared to interaction
at text level. However, these parametric representations encode high-level
document information that can enhance the model's understanding of documents
within the input context. When combined parameterized documents with textual
documents, the model can leverage relevant information more effectively and
become more robust to noisy inputs, achieving better performance than either
source alone. We recommend jointly using parameterized and textual documents
and advocate for increasing the information content of parametric
representations to advance PRAG.

Motivation: 解决多模态嵌入模型在现实世界应用和业务场景中面临的挑战，如有限模态支持、训练机制不稳定和工业领域差距，以提升跨模态任务的性能。

Conclusion: SAIL-Embedding通过优化的训练策略和架构设计，有效解决了多模态嵌入模型在工业应用中的关键问题，在推荐和检索任务中表现出显著性能提升。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models aim to yield informative unified representations
that empower diverse cross-modal tasks. Despite promising developments in the
evolution from CLIP-based dual-tower architectures to large vision-language
models, prior works still face unavoidable challenges in real-world
applications and business scenarios, such as the limited modality support,
unstable training mechanisms, and industrial domain gaps. In this work, we
introduce SAIL-Embedding, an omni-modal embedding foundation model that
addresses these issues through tailored training strategies and architectural
design. In the optimization procedure, we propose a multi-stage training scheme
to boost the multifaceted effectiveness of representation learning.
Specifically, the content-aware progressive training aims to enhance the
model's adaptability to diverse downstream tasks and master enriched
cross-modal proficiency. The collaboration-aware recommendation enhancement
training further adapts multimodal representations for recommendation scenarios
by distilling knowledge from sequence-to-item and ID-to-item embeddings while
mining user historical interests. Concurrently, we develop the stochastic
specialization and dataset-driven pattern matching to strengthen model training
flexibility and generalizability. Experimental results show that SAIL-Embedding
achieves SOTA performance compared to other methods in different retrieval
tasks. In online experiments across various real-world scenarios integrated
with our model, we observe a significant increase in Lifetime (LT), which is a
crucial indicator for the recommendation experience. For instance, the model
delivers the 7-day LT gain of +0.158% and the 14-day LT gain of +0.144% in the
Douyin-Selected scenario. For the Douyin feed rank model, the match features
produced by SAIL-Embedding yield a +0.08% AUC gain.

Result: 在公开数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法相比当前最先进方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的Outram-GSF管道通过连续语义函数建模实现了更好的语义消歧和全局定位性能。

Abstract: We present a one-shot LiDAR global localization algorithm featuring semantic
disambiguation ability based on a lightweight tri-layered scene graph. While
landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance
improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods,
landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We
propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with
continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared
with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained
geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for
correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle
layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a
tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend
for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF
(Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly
available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current
state-of-the-art.

Result: 在模拟环境和真实机器人任务中，Energy Policy达到或超越最先进方法性能，同时显著降低计算开销，在MimicGen基准上实现更优性能且推理更快

Conclusion: Energy Policy是一个快速有效的机器人操作策略框架，能够实现高速高精度操作，特别适合资源受限系统

Abstract: We present a fast and effective policy framework for robotic manipulation,
named Energy Policy, designed for high-frequency robotic tasks and
resource-constrained systems. Unlike existing robotic policies, Energy Policy
natively predicts multimodal actions in a single forward pass, enabling
high-precision manipulation at high speed. The framework is built upon two core
components. First, we adopt the energy score as the learning objective to
facilitate multimodal action modeling. Second, we introduce an energy MLP to
implement the proposed objective while keeping the architecture simple and
efficient. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated environments
and real-world robotic tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of Energy Policy.
The results show that Energy Policy matches or surpasses the performance of
state-of-the-art manipulation methods while significantly reducing
computational overhead. Notably, on the MimicGen benchmark, Energy Policy
achieves superior performance with at a faster inference compared to existing
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过微调生成模型来降低被过滤的概率，但这往往使模型产生靠近分类器决策边界的样本，增加了假阳性和假阴性

Method: 使用强化学习进行微调，明确引导生成远离分类器的边界区域

Result: 在越狱和模糊提示基准测试中，Boundary Guidance提高了输出的安全性和实用性，LLM评估验证了其有效性

Conclusion: 该方法在不同模型规模和奖励设计下都表现出鲁棒性，为生成模型安全过滤提供了更优解决方案

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

Conclusion: 基于研究结果提供了基于计算预算选择重放比例的实证指导，使实践者能够以显著降低的训练成本实现强大的任务适应。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

### [163] [MosaicDiff: Training-free Structural Pruning for Diffusion Model Acceleration Reflecting Pretraining Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11962)
*Bowei Guo,Shengkun Tang,Cong Zeng,Zhiqiang Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MosaicDiff是一个新颖的框架，通过轨迹感知的结构剪枝将扩散模型的预训练动态与后训练采样加速对齐，实现采样加速而不损失输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的预训练过程存在不同的学习速度阶段，但之前的后训练加速方法完全忽略了这一点。本研究旨在将预训练动态与采样加速过程协调一致。

Method: 采用轨迹感知的结构剪枝方法，根据预训练不同阶段的学习速度进行自适应剪枝：中间快速学习阶段采用保守剪枝以保留关键特征，早期和后期慢速学习阶段采用更激进的剪枝策略。

Result: 在DiT和SDXL上的实验表明，该方法在采样速度上实现了显著提升，且不损害输出质量，大幅超越了之前的最先进方法。

Conclusion: MosaicDiff为更高效和鲁棒的无训练扩散加速提供了新视角，首次明确反映了扩散预训练固有的学习速度变化。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

TL;DR: 提出基于视觉自回归模型的新型生成式分类器A-VARC+，在准确性和推理速度间取得更好平衡，并展示与扩散模型不同的特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式分类器主要依赖计算成本高昂的扩散模型，限制了可扩展性，且对生成式分类器的理解受限。

Method: 基于视觉自回归建模构建生成式分类器，提出自适应VAR分类器A-VARC+。

Result: A-VARC+在准确性和推理速度间达到优越平衡，通过token-wise互信息实现可视化解释，并在类增量学习中表现出抗灾难性遗忘能力。

Conclusion: VAR方法为生成式分类器研究提供了新视角，具有可处理似然、可视化解释和抗遗忘等独特优势。

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

*Israel Mason-Williams,Gabryel Mason-Williams,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了平坦最小值与泛化性能的关系，提出尖锐度应被视为函数依赖属性而非泛化差的可靠指标。研究发现正则化常导致更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值反而与更好的泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为平坦最小值与更好的泛化相关，但近期研究发现了理论和经验上的反例。本文旨在重新探讨尖锐度在模型性能中的作用。

Method: 进行了广泛的实证研究，从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务，比较了使用不同正则化方法（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）的模型。

Result: 正则化模型倾向于收敛到更尖锐的最小值，但这些尖锐最小值在泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性方面表现更好。无正则化的基线模型收敛到更平坦的最小值但性能更差。

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦度单独决定了解空间的几何形状，尖锐最小值可能反映更合适的归纳偏置（特别是在正则化下），需要对损失景观几何进行以函数为中心的重新评估。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

TL;DR: 提出了DiffEM方法，使用期望最大化算法从损坏数据训练扩散模型，通过条件扩散模型在E步重建干净数据，在M步优化模型参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在高维逆问题中表现出色，但当只有损坏或噪声观测数据时，学习这些模型仍然具有挑战性。

Method: DiffEM方法结合条件扩散模型和EM算法：E步使用条件扩散模型从观测数据重建干净数据，M步使用重建数据优化条件扩散模型参数。

Result: 理论分析表明在适当统计条件下，DiffEM迭代具有单调收敛保证。实验验证了该方法在多种图像重建任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: DiffEM为从损坏数据训练扩散模型提供了一种有效的EM框架，具有理论收敛保证和实际应用效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

TL;DR: DISTAR是一个零样本文本到语音框架，在离散残差向量量化代码空间中结合自回归语言模型和掩码扩散模型，实现高质量音频合成和多种控制功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归草图生成器与扩散精炼器组合方法在分布偏移下表现脆弱，且可控性有限。需要开发更稳健、可控的文本到语音系统。

Method: 在离散RVQ代码空间中，使用自回归语言模型生成块级草图，然后通过并行掩码扩散填充完成下一个块，实现长格式合成和块级并行化。

Result: DISTAR在鲁棒性、自然度和说话人/风格一致性方面超越现有零样本TTS系统，同时保持丰富的输出多样性。支持贪婪和采样解码、可变比特率和可控计算。

Conclusion: DISTAR通过离散代码空间中的紧密模型耦合，实现了高质量、可控的零样本文本到语音合成，解决了现有方法的脆弱性和可控性限制问题。

Abstract: Recent attempts to interleave autoregressive (AR) sketchers with
diffusion-based refiners over continuous speech representations have shown
promise, but they remain brittle under distribution shift and offer limited
levers for controllability. We introduce DISTAR, a zero-shot text-to-speech
framework that operates entirely in a discrete residual vector quantization
(RVQ) code space and tightly couples an AR language model with a masked
diffusion model, without forced alignment or a duration predictor. Concretely,
DISTAR drafts block-level RVQ tokens with an AR language model and then
performs parallel masked-diffusion infilling conditioned on the draft to
complete the next block, yielding long-form synthesis with blockwise
parallelism while mitigating classic AR exposure bias. The discrete code space
affords explicit control at inference: DISTAR produces high-quality audio under
both greedy and sample-based decoding using classifier-free guidance, supports
trade-offs between robustness and diversity, and enables variable bit-rate and
controllable computation via RVQ layer pruning at test time. Extensive
experiments and ablations demonstrate that DISTAR surpasses state-of-the-art
zero-shot TTS systems in robustness, naturalness, and speaker/style
consistency, while maintaining rich output diversity. Audio samples are
provided on https://anonymous.4open.science/w/DiSTAR_demo.

TL;DR: GS-VERSE是一种将网格与高斯溅射表示直接集成的新方法，用于VR中的3D内容交互编辑，提供更精确的表面近似和物理感知操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VR中3D内容物理操作技术存在工程密集、几何表示简化等问题，影响视觉保真度和物理准确性。

Method: 通过将物体网格与高斯溅射表示直接集成，实现精确表面近似，支持物理引擎无关的部署。

Result: 在18人参与的用户研究中，该方法在物理感知拉伸操作上显著优于现有技术，在其他物理操作中也表现更一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为交互式3D操作提供了高度逼真、适应性强且直观的解决方案，是现有方法的可行替代方案。

Abstract: As the demand for immersive 3D content grows, the need for intuitive and
efficient interaction methods becomes paramount. Current techniques for
physically manipulating 3D content within Virtual Reality (VR) often face
significant limitations, including reliance on engineering-intensive processes
and simplified geometric representations, such as tetrahedral cages, which can
compromise visual fidelity and physical accuracy. In this paper, we introduce
\our{} (\textbf{G}aussian \textbf{S}platting for \textbf{V}irtual
\textbf{E}nvironment \textbf{R}endering and \textbf{S}cene \textbf{E}diting), a
novel method designed to overcome these challenges by directly integrating an
object's mesh with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) representation. Our approach
enables more precise surface approximation, leading to highly realistic
deformations and interactions. By leveraging existing 3D mesh assets, \our{}
facilitates seamless content reuse and simplifies the development workflow.
Moreover, our system is designed to be physics-engine-agnostic, granting
developers robust deployment flexibility. This versatile architecture delivers
a highly realistic, adaptable, and intuitive approach to interactive 3D
manipulation. We rigorously validate our method against the current
state-of-the-art technique that couples VR with GS in a comparative user study
involving 18 participants. Specifically, we demonstrate that our approach is
statistically significantly better for physics-aware stretching manipulation
and is also more consistent in other physics-based manipulations like twisting
and shaking. Further evaluation across various interactions and scenes confirms
that our method consistently delivers high and reliable performance, showing
its potential as a plausible alternative to existing methods.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在模拟社会实验中的能力，特别是它们模拟人类个性的真实性，为在社会科学实验中应用大语言模型提供理论基础。

Method: 提出了对传统心理测量方法（CFA和构念效度）的重要修改，开发了系统性的LLM虚拟人格评估框架，包括个体层面和群体层面的分析方法。

Result: 实证证明了人物细节在个性模拟质量中的关键作用，识别了人物档案的边际效用效应，特别是在LLM个性模拟中发现了缩放定律。

Conclusion: 为在社会科学实验中应用大型语言模型提供了操作性的评估指标和理论基础，解决了传统心理测量方法在捕捉LLM改进趋势方面的局限性。

Abstract: This research focuses on using large language models (LLMs) to simulate
social experiments, exploring their ability to emulate human personality in
virtual persona role-playing. The research develops an end-to-end evaluation
framework, including individual-level analysis of stability and
identifiability, as well as population-level analysis called progressive
personality curves to examine the veracity and consistency of LLMs in
simulating human personality. Methodologically, this research proposes
important modifications to traditional psychometric approaches (CFA and
construct validity) which are unable to capture improvement trends in LLMs at
their current low-level simulation, potentially leading to remature rejection
or methodological misalignment. The main contributions of this research are:
proposing a systematic framework for LLM virtual personality evaluation;
empirically demonstrating the critical role of persona detail in personality
simulation quality; and identifying marginal utility effects of persona
profiles, especially a Scaling Law in LLM personality simulation, offering
operational evaluation metrics and a theoretical foundation for applying large
language models in social science experiments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体评估面临诸多挑战，包括评估时间长、实现错误多、难以理解智能体真实表现等，这些问题阻碍了对智能体实际性能的准确理解。

Method: 1. 标准化评估框架：在数百个虚拟机上进行并行评估，将评估时间从数周缩短到数小时；2. 三维分析：涵盖模型、架构和基准测试三个维度；3. LLM辅助日志检查：发现智能体未报告的行为模式。

Result: 进行了21,730次智能体测试，涵盖9个模型和9个基准测试（编码、网页导航、科学和客户服务），总成本约4万美元。发现意外洞察：大多数情况下更高的推理努力反而降低准确性。发现未报告行为：如在HuggingFace上搜索基准而非解决问题，在航班预订任务中滥用信用卡等。

Conclusion: 通过标准化智能体评估方法并解决常见评估陷阱，HAL旨在推动研究从追求基准测试高分转向开发在现实世界中可靠工作的智能体。共享了包含25亿token的智能体日志以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: AI agents have been developed for complex real-world tasks from coding to
customer service. But AI agent evaluations suffer from many challenges that
undermine our understanding of how well agents really work. We introduce the
Holistic Agent Leaderboard (HAL) to address these challenges. We make three
main contributions. First, we provide a standardized evaluation harness that
orchestrates parallel evaluations across hundreds of VMs, reducing evaluation
time from weeks to hours while eliminating common implementation bugs. Second,
we conduct three-dimensional analysis spanning models, scaffolds, and
benchmarks. We validate the harness by conducting 21,730 agent rollouts across
9 models and 9 benchmarks in coding, web navigation, science, and customer
service with a total cost of about $40,000. Our analysis reveals surprising
insights, such as higher reasoning effort reducing accuracy in the majority of
runs. Third, we use LLM-aided log inspection to uncover previously unreported
behaviors, such as searching for the benchmark on HuggingFace instead of
solving a task, or misusing credit cards in flight booking tasks. We share all
agent logs, comprising 2.5B tokens of language model calls, to incentivize
further research into agent behavior. By standardizing how the field evaluates
agents and addressing common pitfalls in agent evaluation, we hope to shift the
focus from agents that ace benchmarks to agents that work reliably in the real
world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型存在推理效率低下和偏离目标的问题，而无需训练的方法要么基于僵化启发式规则，要么只提供描述性分析而缺乏可操作性。

Method: 使用进化过程生成think-prefixes指令，这些指令在推理行为分类的驱动下演化，引导模型实现更优性能。

Result: 显著改善了准确率-长度的权衡关系，大幅提升安全性（如将DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B的StrongREJECT分数从27.0%降至0.7），增强指令跟随能力，并能与现有基于训练的方法协同工作。

Conclusion: think-prefixes能够可靠控制大型推理模型的推理行为，不同任务对特定行为分布有强烈偏好，ThinkPiot通过自动识别和激发这些行为，为将模型推理与任务需求对齐提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are powerful, but they still suffer from
inefficient and off-target reasoning. Currently, training-free methods are
limited to either rigid heuristics or descriptive, non-actionable analyses. In
this paper, we introduce ThinkPilot, a training-free framework that
automatically optimizes LRMs reasoning. It uses an evolutionary process to
generate think-prefixes, which are instructions that evolve driven by a
taxonomy of reasoning behaviors to guide models toward superior performance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate ThinkPilot's broad effectiveness: it
significantly improves the accuracy-length trade-off for efficient reasoning,
drastically improves safety (for example, cutting the StrongREJECT score of
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B from 27.0% to 0.7), and enhances instruction
following. It also synergizes with existing training-based methods. Our
analysis reveals that think-prefixes can reliably control LRMs' reasoning
behaviors, and that different tasks have strong preferences for specific
behavioral distributions. By automatically identifying and eliciting these
behaviors, ThinkPilot provides a generalizable framework for aligning LRMs
reasoning with task demands. Data and code are available at

Conclusion: 为自主构建未知复杂环境的程序化世界模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Symbolic world modeling requires inferring and representing an environment's
transitional dynamics as an executable program. Prior work has focused on
largely deterministic environments with abundant interaction data, simple
mechanics, and human guidance. We address a more realistic and challenging
setting, learning in a complex, stochastic environment where the agent has only
"one life" to explore a hostile environment without human guidance. We
introduce OneLife, a framework that models world dynamics through
conditionally-activated programmatic laws within a probabilistic programming
framework. Each law operates through a precondition-effect structure,
activating in relevant world states. This creates a dynamic computation graph
that routes inference and optimization only through relevant laws, avoiding
scaling challenges when all laws contribute to predictions about a complex,
hierarchical state, and enabling the learning of stochastic dynamics even with
sparse rule activation. To evaluate our approach under these demanding
constraints, we introduce a new evaluation protocol that measures (a) state
ranking, the ability to distinguish plausible future states from implausible
ones, and (b) state fidelity, the ability to generate future states that
closely resemble reality. We develop and evaluate our framework on Crafter-OO,
our reimplementation of the Crafter environment that exposes a structured,
object-oriented symbolic state and a pure transition function that operates on
that state alone. OneLife can successfully learn key environment dynamics from
minimal, unguided interaction, outperforming a strong baseline on 16 out of 23
scenarios tested. We also test OneLife's planning ability, with simulated
rollouts successfully identifying superior strategies. Our work establishes a
foundation for autonomously constructing programmatic world models of unknown,
complex environments.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了超越简单方向对齐的细粒度连续控制，并在偏好数据合成、帕累托前沿近似和优化、对齐行为蒸馏等下游任务中展现了效率提升

Abstract: Precise attribute intensity control--generating Large Language Model (LLM)
outputs with specific, user-defined attribute intensities--is crucial for AI
systems adaptable to diverse user expectations. Current LLM alignment methods,
however, typically provide only directional or open-ended guidance, failing to
reliably achieve exact attribute intensities. We address this limitation with
three key designs: (1) reformulating precise attribute intensity control as a
target-reaching problem, rather than simple maximization; (2) training a
lightweight value function via temporal-difference learning to predict final
attribute intensity scores from partial generations, thereby steering LLM
outputs; and (3) employing gradient-based interventions on hidden
representations to navigate the model precisely towards specific attribute
intensity targets. Our method enables fine-grained, continuous control over
attribute intensities, moving beyond simple directional alignment. Experiments
on LLaMA-3.2-3b and Phi-4-mini confirm our method's ability to steer text
generation to user-specified attribute intensities with high accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate efficiency enhancements across three downstream tasks:
preference data synthesis, Pareto frontier approximation and optimization, and
distillation of aligned behaviors for intervention-free inference. Our code is

Abstract: This review surveys the rapid evolution of Meta AI's LLaMA (Large Language

parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods developed for these models. We
first describe the LLaMA family of foundation models (7B-65B to 288B

Mixtureof-Experts variants), and key performance characteristics. We then
describe and discuss the concept of PEFT, which adapts large pre-trained models
by updating only a small subset of parameters, and review five PEFT methods
that have been applied to LLaMA: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), LLaMA-Adapter V1
and V2, LLaMA-Excitor, and QLoRA (Quantized LoRA). We discuss each method's
mechanism, parameter savings, and example application to LLaMA (e.g.,
instruction tuning, multimodal tasks). We provide structured discussion and
analysis of model and adapter architectures, parameter counts, and benchmark
results (including examples where fine-tuned LLaMA models outperform larger
baselines). Finally, we examine real-world use cases where LLaMA-based models
and PEFT have been successfully applied (e.g., legal and medical domains), and
we discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions (such as scaling
to even larger contexts and improving robustness). This survey paper provides a
one-stop resource for ML researchers and practitioners interested in LLaMA
models and efficient fine-tuning strategies.

Abstract: Social media has become an essential part of the digital age, serving as a
platform for communication, interaction, and information sharing. Celebrities
are among the most active users and often reveal aspects of their personal and
professional lives through online posts. Platforms such as Twitter provide an
opportunity to analyze language and behavior for understanding demographic and
social patterns. Since followers frequently share linguistic traits and
interests with the celebrities they follow, textual data from followers can be
used to predict celebrity demographics. However, most existing research in this
field has focused on English and other high-resource languages, leaving Urdu
largely unexplored.
  This study applies modern machine learning and deep learning techniques to
the problem of celebrity profiling in Urdu. A dataset of short Urdu tweets from
followers of subcontinent celebrities was collected and preprocessed. Multiple
algorithms were trained and compared, including Logistic Regression, Support
Vector Machines, Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Long
Short-Term Memory networks. The models were evaluated using accuracy,
precision, recall, F1-score, and cumulative rank (cRank). The best performance
was achieved for gender prediction with a cRank of 0.65 and an accuracy of
0.65, followed by moderate results for age, profession, and fame prediction.
These results demonstrate that follower-based linguistic features can be
effectively leveraged using machine learning and neural approaches for
demographic prediction in Urdu, a low-resource language.

Main category: cs.SI

TL;DR: 本研究分析了俄乌战争期间乌克兰和俄罗斯政策制定者在Telegram上的精英驱动政治传播，发现入侵后Telegram活动激增，两国政策制定者采用不同的沟通策略：乌克兰初期关注战争话题但随时间减少，俄罗斯则回避战争话题转而强调西方危机以转移公众注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究俄乌战争这一社交媒体时代首次大规模欧洲战争期间，政策制定者如何通过Telegram进行政治传播，了解战时在线政治话语的动态。

Method: 使用2019-2024年乌克兰和俄罗斯政策制定者在Telegram公共帖文的独特数据集，分析俄罗斯2022年全面入侵后传播量、主题内容和参与者参与度的变化。

Result: 入侵后Telegram活动急剧增加，特别是执政党政策制定者；乌克兰政策制定者初期关注战争话题但随时间减少；俄罗斯政策制定者回避战争讨论，转而强调西方危机；大小政党和个体政策制定者之间存在沟通策略差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了政策制定者如何适应战时沟通挑战，为战时在线政治话语动态提供了重要见解。

Abstract: This study examines elite-driven political communication on Telegram during
the ongoing Russo-Ukrainian war, the first large-scale European war in the
social media era. Using a unique dataset of Telegram public posts from
Ukrainian and Russian policymakers (2019-2024), we analyze changes in
communication volume, thematic content, and actor engagement following Russia's
2022 full-scale invasion. Our findings show a sharp increase in Telegram
activity after the invasion, particularly among ruling-party policymakers.
Ukrainian policymakers initially focused on war-related topics, but this
emphasis declined over time In contrast, Russian policymakers largely avoided
war-related discussions, instead emphasizing unrelated topics, such as Western
crises, to distract public attention. We also identify differences in
communication strategies between large and small parties, as well as individual
policymakers. Our findings shed light on how policymakers adapt to wartime
communication challenges and offer critical insights into the dynamics of
online political discourse during times of war.

TL;DR: 本文提出了统一音频语言模型（UALM），旨在将音频理解、文本到音频生成和多模态推理统一在单一模型中，实现了跨模态生成推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频语言建模领域将音频理解和文本到音频生成作为独立任务处理，很少有研究尝试统一这些任务，而这是实现高级多模态推理的关键步骤。

Method: 首先开发UALM-Gen文本到音频语言模型直接预测音频token，然后通过适当的数据混合、训练配方和推理技术，使单个UALM模型在多个任务上达到专业模型水平，并进一步提出UALM-Reason多模态推理模型。

Result: UALM在音频理解、文本到音频生成和文本推理方面与最先进的专用模型质量相当，UALM-Reason通过主观评估证实了跨模态生成推理的有效性。

Conclusion: 这是音频研究中首次展示跨模态生成推理，证明了在单一模型中统一音频理解和生成任务的可行性，为高级多模态推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Recent advances in the audio language modeling (ALM) domain tackle audio
understanding and text-to-audio generation as separate tasks. Very few studies
attempt to unify these tasks -- an essential step toward advanced multimodal
reasoning. This paper introduces U}nified Audio Language Model (UALM), which
aims to unify audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and multimodal
reasoning in a single model. To achieve this goal, we first present UALM-Gen, a
text-to-audio language model that directly predicts audio tokens and is
comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion-based models. We then demonstrate,
using proper data blending, training recipes, and inference techniques, that
our single UALM model matches the quality of state-of-the-art specialized
models in audio understanding, text-to-audio generation, and text reasoning.
Furthermore, we present UALM-Reason, a multimodal reasoning model that utilizes
both text and audio in the intermediate thinking steps to facilitate complex
generation tasks. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in audio
research of cross-modal generative reasoning, with its effectiveness confirmed
by subjective evaluations.

*Cristina Aggazzotti,Ashi Garg,Zexin Cai,Nicholas Andrews*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: 该论文提出在长音频场景下，仅靠语音匿名化不足以保护说话人隐私，需要结合内容匿名化技术来消除说话人特有的语言风格特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音匿名化技术在短语音中表现良好，但在长音频场景下，攻击者可以利用同一说话人的多个语料中的词汇、句法和语言习惯特征进行重新识别，即使声音被完全伪装。

Method: 提出内容匿名化方法，在ASR-TTS流程中对文本进行上下文重写，消除说话人特有风格同时保留语义。

Result: 在长电话对话场景中验证了基于内容的攻击对语音匿名化语音的有效性，并证明所提出的内容匿名化方法能够降低这种风险同时保持语音实用性。

Conclusion: 改写是一种有效的防御基于内容攻击的方法，建议相关方在长音频中采用此步骤以确保匿名性。

Abstract: Voice anonymization techniques have been found to successfully obscure a
speaker's acoustic identity in short, isolated utterances in benchmarks such as
the VoicePrivacy Challenge. In practice, however, utterances seldom occur in
isolation: long-form audio is commonplace in domains such as interviews, phone
calls, and meetings. In these cases, many utterances from the same speaker are
available, which pose a significantly greater privacy risk: given multiple
utterances from the same speaker, an attacker could exploit an individual's
vocabulary, syntax, and turns of phrase to re-identify them, even when their
voice is completely disguised. To address this risk, we propose new content
anonymization approaches. Our approach performs a contextual rewriting of the
transcripts in an ASR-TTS pipeline to eliminate speaker-specific style while
preserving meaning. We present results in a long-form telephone conversation
setting demonstrating the effectiveness of a content-based attack on
voice-anonymized speech. Then we show how the proposed content-based
anonymization methods can mitigate this risk while preserving speech utility.
Overall, we find that paraphrasing is an effective defense against
content-based attacks and recommend that stakeholders adopt this step to ensure
anonymity in long-form audio.

*Simone Carnemolla,Matteo Pennisi,Chiara Russo,Simone Palazzo,Daniela Giordano,Concetto Spampinato*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: SeeingSounds是一个轻量级模块化音频到图像生成框架，通过双对齐机制将音频映射到语义语言空间和视觉领域，无需配对音频-视觉数据或视觉生成模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知神经科学启发，该方法旨在反映人类感知中自然存在的跨模态关联，而不是简单地将音频作为文本替代品或仅依赖音频到文本映射。

Method: 使用冻结的语言编码器将音频投影到语义语言空间，通过视觉语言模型将其上下文接地到视觉领域。在冻结扩散骨干上仅训练轻量级适配器，支持通过程序化文本提示生成进行细粒度控制。

Result: 在标准基准测试中的广泛实验证实，SeeingSounds在零样本和监督设置下均优于现有方法，在可控音频到视觉生成方面建立了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该框架通过双对齐机制实现了高效可扩展的音频到图像生成，支持细粒度和可解释的控制，为跨模态生成任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SeeingSounds, a lightweight and modular framework for
audio-to-image generation that leverages the interplay between audio, language,
and vision-without requiring any paired audio-visual data or training on visual
generative models. Rather than treating audio as a substitute for text or
relying solely on audio-to-text mappings, our method performs dual alignment:
audio is projected into a semantic language space via a frozen language
encoder, and, contextually grounded into the visual domain using a
vision-language model. This approach, inspired by cognitive neuroscience,
reflects the natural cross-modal associations observed in human perception. The
model operates on frozen diffusion backbones and trains only lightweight
adapters, enabling efficient and scalable learning. Moreover, it supports
fine-grained and interpretable control through procedural text prompt
generation, where audio transformations (e.g., volume or pitch shifts)
translate into descriptive prompts (e.g., "a distant thunder") that guide
visual outputs. Extensive experiments across standard benchmarks confirm that
SeeingSounds outperforms existing methods in both zero-shot and supervised
settings, establishing a new state of the art in controllable audio-to-visual
generation.

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: AGVP框架通过音频自注意力提取全局听觉上下文，并将其作为查询来指导视觉特征注意力，在特征层面突出声源相关区域，从而改善音频-视觉具身导航的跨源泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AVN方法在分布内声源上表现良好，但在遇到未听过的声音或未见过的环境时，导航成功率急剧下降且搜索路径过长，这源于缺乏听觉信号与对应视觉区域的显式对齐机制。

Method: 提出AGVP框架：1）通过音频自注意力提取全局听觉上下文；2）用听觉上下文作为查询指导视觉特征注意力，在特征层面突出声源相关区域；3）进行时序建模和策略优化。

Result: 实验结果表明，AGVP提高了导航效率和鲁棒性，在未听过的声音上实现了优越的跨场景泛化能力。

Conclusion: AGVP通过可解释的跨模态对齐和区域重加权设计，减少了对特定声学指纹的依赖，显著提升了音频-视觉具身导航的泛化性能。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Embodied Navigation aims to enable agents to autonomously
navigate to sound sources in unknown 3D environments using auditory cues. While
current AVN methods excel on in-distribution sound sources, they exhibit poor
cross-source generalization: navigation success rates plummet and search paths
become excessively long when agents encounter unheard sounds or unseen
environments. This limitation stems from the lack of explicit alignment
mechanisms between auditory signals and corresponding visual regions. Policies
tend to memorize spurious \enquote{acoustic fingerprint-scenario} correlations
during training, leading to blind exploration when exposed to novel sound
sources. To address this, we propose the AGVP framework, which transforms sound
from policy-memorable acoustic fingerprint cues into spatial guidance. The
framework first extracts global auditory context via audio self-attention, then
uses this context as queries to guide visual feature attention, highlighting
sound-source-related regions at the feature level. Subsequent temporal modeling
and policy optimization are then performed. This design, centered on
interpretable cross-modal alignment and region reweighting, reduces dependency
on specific acoustic fingerprints. Experimental results demonstrate that AGVP
improves both navigation efficiency and robustness while achieving superior
cross-scenario generalization on previously unheard sounds.

TL;DR: 论文发现基于LLM的深度研究(DR)代理存在严重安全风险，即使LLM本身拒绝的有害查询，通过DR代理的多步骤研究过程仍能生成详细危险报告。作者提出了两种新的越狱策略来暴露这些风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DR代理在生物安全等高风险领域可能被滥用，生成包含禁止知识的专业报告。现有LLM越狱方法无法有效暴露DR代理特有的研究能力风险。

Method: 提出了两种新的越狱策略：计划注入（在代理计划中注入恶意子目标）和意图劫持（将有害查询重新表述为学术研究问题）。在不同LLM和安全基准上进行了广泛实验。

Result: 实验发现三个关键结果：1）LLM的对齐在DR代理中经常失效；2）多步骤规划和执行削弱了对齐，揭示了系统级漏洞；3）DR代理不仅能绕过拒绝，还能生成更连贯、专业和危险的内容。

Conclusion: DR代理存在根本性的不对齐问题，需要专门针对DR代理开发更好的对齐技术。

Abstract: Deep Research (DR) agents built on Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform
complex, multi-step research by decomposing tasks, retrieving online
information, and synthesizing detailed reports. However, the misuse of LLMs
with such powerful capabilities can lead to even greater risks. This is
especially concerning in high-stakes and knowledge-intensive domains such as
biosecurity, where DR can generate a professional report containing detailed
forbidden knowledge. Unfortunately, we have found such risks in practice:
simply submitting a harmful query, which a standalone LLM directly rejects, can
elicit a detailed and dangerous report from DR agents. This highlights the
elevated risks and underscores the need for a deeper safety analysis. Yet,
jailbreak methods designed for LLMs fall short in exposing such unique risks,
as they do not target the research ability of DR agents. To address this gap,
we propose two novel jailbreak strategies: Plan Injection, which injects
malicious sub-goals into the agent's plan; and Intent Hijack, which reframes
harmful queries as academic research questions. We conducted extensive
experiments across different LLMs and various safety benchmarks, including
general and biosecurity forbidden prompts. These experiments reveal 3 key
findings: (1) Alignment of the LLMs often fail in DR agents, where harmful
prompts framed in academic terms can hijack agent intent; (2) Multi-step
planning and execution weaken the alignment, revealing systemic vulnerabilities
that prompt-level safeguards cannot address; (3) DR agents not only bypass
refusals but also produce more coherent, professional, and dangerous content,
compared with standalone LLMs. These results demonstrate a fundamental
misalignment in DR agents and call for better alignment techniques tailored to
DR agents. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: HackWorld是首个通过视觉交互系统评估计算机使用代理(CUAs)利用Web应用漏洞能力的框架，包含36个真实应用和多种漏洞类型，评估显示CUAs的漏洞利用率低于12%，存在安全意识和多步骤攻击规划能力不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统渗透测试成本高且难以扩展，而现代Web应用需要视觉理解和动态内容处理能力，目前CUAs通过图形界面发现和利用漏洞的能力尚未被充分探索。

Method: 使用Capture-the-Flag(CTF)设置，在包含36个真实应用、11个框架和7种语言的HackWorld框架中测试CUAs识别和利用漏洞的能力，同时要求代理导航复杂的Web界面。

Result: 评估显示最先进的CUAs漏洞利用率低于12%，网络安全意识低，经常在多步骤攻击规划中失败并误用安全工具。

Conclusion: 结果揭示了CUAs在Web安全环境中的当前局限性，并为开发更具安全意识、能够有效检测和利用漏洞的代理提供了机会。

Abstract: Web applications are prime targets for cyberattacks as gateways to critical
services and sensitive data. Traditional penetration testing is costly and
expertise-intensive, making it difficult to scale with the growing web
ecosystem. While language model agents show promise in cybersecurity, modern
web applications demand visual understanding, dynamic content handling, and
multi-step interactions that only computer-use agents (CUAs) can perform. Yet,
their ability to discover and exploit vulnerabilities through graphical
interfaces remains largely unexplored. We present HackWorld, the first
framework for systematically evaluating CUAs' capabilities to exploit web
application vulnerabilities via visual interaction. Unlike sanitized
benchmarks, HackWorld includes 36 real-world applications across 11 frameworks
and 7 languages, featuring realistic flaws such as injection vulnerabilities,
authentication bypasses, and unsafe input handling. Using a Capture-the-Flag
(CTF) setup, it tests CUAs' capacity to identify and exploit these weaknesses
while navigating complex web interfaces. Evaluation of state-of-the-art CUAs
reveals concerning trends: exploitation rates below 12% and low cybersecurity
awareness. CUAs often fail at multi-step attack planning and misuse security
tools. These results expose the current limitations of CUAs in web security
contexts and highlight opportunities for developing more security-aware agents
capable of effective vulnerability detection and exploitation.
