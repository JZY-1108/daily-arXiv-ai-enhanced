### [1] [Prompt Engineering: How Prompt Vocabulary affects Domain Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17037)
*Dimitri Schreiter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了提示词特异性对LLM在STEM、医学和法律领域表现的影响，发现存在一个最优特异性范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索提示词特异性对LLM在专业领域任务中的表现是否具有显著影响。

Method: 开发同义词替换框架，测试不同特异性提示词对四种LLM的影响。

Result: 增加提示词特异性通常无显著影响，但存在一个最优特异性范围可提升性能。

Conclusion: 优化提示词特异性范围可提升LLM在专业领域的表现。

Abstract: Prompt engineering has emerged as a critical component in optimizing large
language models (LLMs) for domain-specific tasks. However, the role of prompt
specificity, especially in domains like STEM (physics, chemistry, biology,
computer science and mathematics), medicine, and law, remains underexplored.
This thesis addresses the problem of whether increasing the specificity of
vocabulary in prompts improves LLM performance in domain-specific
question-answering and reasoning tasks. We developed a synonymization framework
to systematically substitute nouns, verbs, and adjectives with varying
specificity levels, measuring the impact on four LLMs: Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct,
Granite-13B-Instruct-V2, Flan-T5-XL, and Mistral-Large 2, across datasets in
STEM, law, and medicine. Our results reveal that while generally increasing the
specificity of prompts does not have a significant impact, there appears to be
a specificity range, across all considered models, where the LLM performs the
best. Identifying this optimal specificity range offers a key insight for
prompt design, suggesting that manipulating prompts within this range could
maximize LLM performance and lead to more efficient applications in specialized
domains.

### [2] [Signals from the Floods: AI-Driven Disaster Analysis through Multi-Source Data Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17038)
*Xian Gong,Paul X. McCarthy,Lin Tian,Marian-Andrei Rizoiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究结合X（原Twitter）和公共调查数据，分析极端天气事件中的公众行为模式，提出一种结合LDA和LLM的新方法，优化危机相关内容筛选。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用社交媒体和公共调查数据提升灾害响应效率，改善实时灾害应对和长期韧性规划。

Method: 整合LDA主题建模和LLM语义理解，通过相关性指数方法减少噪音并优先处理可操作内容。

Result: LDA揭示观点和地理模式，LLM提升洪水相关推文筛选，结合数据流优化危机内容分析。

Conclusion: 结合互补数据流，提出AI驱动方法，改进灾害响应和韧性规划。

Abstract: Massive and diverse web data are increasingly vital for government disaster
response, as demonstrated by the 2022 floods in New South Wales (NSW),
Australia. This study examines how X (formerly Twitter) and public inquiry
submissions provide insights into public behaviour during crises. We analyse
more than 55,000 flood-related tweets and 1,450 submissions to identify
behavioural patterns during extreme weather events. While social media posts
are short and fragmented, inquiry submissions are detailed, multi-page
documents offering structured insights. Our methodology integrates Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to enhance semantic understanding. LDA reveals distinct opinions and
geographic patterns, while LLMs improve filtering by identifying flood-relevant
tweets using public submissions as a reference. This Relevance Index method
reduces noise and prioritizes actionable content, improving situational
awareness for emergency responders. By combining these complementary data
streams, our approach introduces a novel AI-driven method to refine
crisis-related social media content, improve real-time disaster response, and
inform long-term resilience planning.

### [3] [A new classification system of beer categories and styles based on large-scale data mining and self-organizing maps of beer recipes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17039)
*Diego Bonatto*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过数据驱动方法开发了一种新的啤酒分类系统，分析了62,121个啤酒配方，识别出四大超级集群，揭示了不同发酵方式的原料使用模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统啤酒分类依赖感官评价，缺乏客观性。本研究旨在通过数据驱动方法建立可重复、客观的分类框架。

Method: 使用统计分析和自组织映射（SOMs）分析62,121个啤酒配方的原料、发酵参数和统计数据。

Result: 识别出四大超级集群，冷发酵啤酒原料保守，热发酵啤酒多样性高，反映了区域偏好和创新。

Conclusion: 新分类系统为啤酒配方分析和开发提供了可扩展工具，揭示了原料使用与发酵特性及风味的关系。

Abstract: A data-driven quantitative approach was used to develop a novel
classification system for beer categories and styles. Sixty-two thousand one
hundred twenty-one beer recipes were mined and analyzed, considering ingredient
profiles, fermentation parameters, and recipe vital statistics. Statistical
analyses combined with self-organizing maps (SOMs) identified four major
superclusters that showed distinctive malt and hop usage patterns, style
characteristics, and historical brewing traditions. Cold fermented styles
showed a conservative grain and hop composition, whereas hot fermented beers
exhibited high heterogeneity, reflecting regional preferences and innovation.
This new taxonomy offers a reproducible and objective framework beyond
traditional sensory-based classifications, providing brewers, researchers, and
educators with a scalable tool for recipe analysis and beer development. The
findings in this work provide an understanding of beer diversity and open
avenues for linking ingredient usage with fermentation profiles and flavor
outcomes.

### [4] [VLM-KG: Multimodal Radiology Knowledge Graph Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17042)
*Abdullah Abdullah,Seong Tae Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态视觉语言模型（VLM）的放射学知识图谱生成框架，解决了现有单模态方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学知识图谱生成面临专业语言和领域数据稀缺的挑战，现有方法仅基于报告且难以处理长文本。

Method: 采用多模态VLM框架，结合放射学报告和影像数据生成知识图谱。

Result: 新方法优于现有方法，首次实现多模态放射学知识图谱生成。

Conclusion: 多模态VLM框架为放射学知识图谱生成提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success in natural
language generation, excelling at instruction following and structured output
generation. Knowledge graphs play a crucial role in radiology, serving as
valuable sources of factual information and enhancing various downstream tasks.
However, generating radiology-specific knowledge graphs presents significant
challenges due to the specialized language of radiology reports and the limited
availability of domain-specific data. Existing solutions are predominantly
unimodal, meaning they generate knowledge graphs only from radiology reports
while excluding radiographic images. Additionally, they struggle with long-form
radiology data due to limited context length. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multimodal VLM-based framework for knowledge graph generation
in radiology. Our approach outperforms previous methods and introduces the
first multimodal solution for radiology knowledge graph generation.

### [5] [QRA++: Quantified Reproducibility Assessment for Common Types of Results in Natural Language Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17043)
*Anya Belz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: QRA++是一种定量评估NLP领域可重复性的方法，通过多粒度连续评估、跨研究可比性指标和实验相似性分析，提供更全面的可重复性结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP领域的可重复性研究结论难以比较和解释，缺乏统一的评估标准，QRA++旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出QRA++方法，包括三个粒度的连续评估、跨研究可比性指标和基于实验相似性的期望值。

Result: 应用QRA++分析三组实验，发现可重复性与实验属性相似性、系统类型和评估方法相关。

Conclusion: QRA++为NLP可重复性研究提供了更科学的评估工具，揭示了影响可重复性的关键因素。

Abstract: Reproduction studies reported in NLP provide individual data points which in
combination indicate worryingly low levels of reproducibility in the field.
Because each reproduction study reports quantitative conclusions based on its
own, often not explicitly stated, criteria for reproduction success/failure,
the conclusions drawn are hard to interpret, compare, and learn from. In this
paper, we present QRA++, a quantitative approach to reproducibility assessment
that (i) produces continuous-valued degree of reproducibility assessments at
three levels of granularity; (ii) utilises reproducibility measures that are
directly comparable across different studies; and (iii) grounds expectations
about degree of reproducibility in degree of similarity between experiments.
QRA++ enables more informative reproducibility assessments to be conducted, and
conclusions to be drawn about what causes reproducibility to be better/poorer.
We illustrate this by applying QRA++ to three example sets of comparable
experiments, revealing clear evidence that degree of reproducibility depends on
similarity of experiment properties, but also system type and evaluation
method.

### [6] [Assessing GPT's Bias Towards Stigmatized Social Groups: An Intersectional Case Study on Nationality Prejudice and Psychophobia](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17045)
*Afifah Kashif,Heer Patel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现GPT-3.5/4/4o等大型语言模型对朝鲜国籍和心理健康障碍群体存在显著偏见，需改进以更好地理解交叉身份。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型对不同国籍和心理健康障碍群体的偏见及其伦理影响。

Method: 通过结构化提示系列评估模型对美国人和朝鲜人及心理健康障碍的反应。

Result: 发现朝鲜国籍和心理健康障碍群体面临更多负面偏见，共情水平显著差异。

Conclusion: 需改进模型设计，增强对交叉身份的细致理解。

Abstract: Recent studies have separately highlighted significant biases within
foundational large language models (LLMs) against certain nationalities and
stigmatized social groups. This research investigates the ethical implications
of these biases intersecting with outputs of widely-used GPT-3.5/4/4o LLMS.
Through structured prompt series, we evaluate model responses to several
scenarios involving American and North Korean nationalities with various mental
disabilities. Findings reveal significant discrepancies in empathy levels with
North Koreans facing greater negative bias, particularly when mental disability
is also a factor. This underscores the need for improvements in LLMs designed
with a nuanced understanding of intersectional identity.

### [7] [Assessing the Quality of AI-Generated Clinical Notes: A Validated Evaluation of a Large Language Model Scribe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17047)
*Erin Palm,Astrit Manikantan,Mark E. Pepin,Herprit Mahal,Srikanth Subramanya Belwadi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究开发了一种盲法研究，比较大型语言模型（LLM）生成的临床笔记与专家笔记的质量，发现两者差异微小，支持使用PDQI9工具评估AI笔记质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗实践中广泛使用AI生成临床笔记，但缺乏评估其质量的方法。

Method: 采用盲法研究，使用PDQI9工具评估LLM生成的笔记与专家笔记的质量，涵盖5个医学专科的97次患者访问。

Result: Gold笔记（专家）得分为4.25/5，Ambient笔记（LLM）得分为4.20/5，差异显著但微小；评估者间一致性高。

Conclusion: PDQI9工具适用于评估LLM生成的临床笔记质量，支持AI在医疗文档中的使用。

Abstract: In medical practices across the United States, physicians have begun
implementing generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to perform the
function of scribes in order to reduce the burden of documenting clinical
encounters. Despite their widespread use, no established methods exist to gauge
the quality of AI scribes. To address this gap, we developed a blinded study
comparing the relative performance of large language model (LLM) generated
clinical notes with those from field experts based on audio-recorded clinical
encounters. Quantitative metrics from the Physician Documentation Quality
Instrument (PDQI9) provided a framework to measure note quality, which we
adapted to assess relative performance of AI generated notes. Clinical experts
spanning 5 medical specialties used the PDQI9 tool to evaluate
specialist-drafted Gold notes and LLM authored Ambient notes. Two evaluators
from each specialty scored notes drafted from a total of 97 patient visits. We
found uniformly high inter rater agreement (RWG greater than 0.7) between
evaluators in general medicine, orthopedics, and obstetrics and gynecology, and
moderate (RWG 0.5 to 0.7) to high inter rater agreement in pediatrics and
cardiology. We found a modest yet significant difference in the overall note
quality, wherein Gold notes achieved a score of 4.25 out of 5 and Ambient notes
scored 4.20 out of 5 (p = 0.04). Our findings support the use of the PDQI9
instrument as a practical method to gauge the quality of LLM authored notes, as
compared to human-authored notes.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了WCB数据集，用于分析全球25家央行28年的政策文本，标注了三种任务，并测试了多种模型，发现跨银行数据训练的模型效果更佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 央行政策解读对经济稳定至关重要，但误读可能对弱势群体造成不公，因此需要系统化分析工具。

Method: 构建WCB数据集，标注25k句子，定义三项任务（立场检测、时间分类、不确定性估计），测试16种模型（7种PLM和9种LLM）。

Result: 跨银行数据训练的模型优于单银行数据模型，验证了整体优于局部的原则。

Conclusion: WCB数据集和框架具有经济实用性，数据与代码已开源。

Abstract: Central banks around the world play a crucial role in maintaining economic
stability. Deciphering policy implications in their communications is
essential, especially as misinterpretations can disproportionately impact
vulnerable populations. To address this, we introduce the World Central Banks
(WCB) dataset, the most comprehensive monetary policy corpus to date,
comprising over 380k sentences from 25 central banks across diverse geographic
regions, spanning 28 years of historical data. After uniformly sampling 1k
sentences per bank (25k total) across all available years, we annotate and
review each sentence using dual annotators, disagreement resolutions, and
secondary expert reviews. We define three tasks: Stance Detection, Temporal
Classification, and Uncertainty Estimation, with each sentence annotated for
all three. We benchmark seven Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and nine Large
Language Models (LLMs) (Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, and with annotation guide) on
these tasks, running 15,075 benchmarking experiments. We find that a model
trained on aggregated data across banks significantly surpasses a model trained
on an individual bank's data, confirming the principle "the whole is greater
than the sum of its parts." Additionally, rigorous human evaluations, error
analyses, and predictive tasks validate our framework's economic utility. Our
artifacts are accessible through the HuggingFace and GitHub under the
CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.

### [9] [Gender and Positional Biases in LLM-Based Hiring Decisions: Evidence from Comparative CV/Résumé Evaluations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17049)
*David Rozado*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型语言模型（LLMs）在评估简历时存在性别偏好，倾向于选择女性候选人，且存在位置偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLMs在职业候选人评估中的行为，揭示其潜在的偏见和不一致性。

Method: 通过实验，将22个LLMs分别提供一份职位描述和两性名字不同的简历对，观察其选择偏好。

Result: LLMs普遍偏好女性候选人，添加性别字段后更明显；性别中性标识下部分模型偏好“候选人A”。

Conclusion: LLMs在自主决策中需谨慎使用，其推理可能缺乏一致性。

Abstract: This study examines the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) when
evaluating professional candidates based on their resumes or curricula vitae
(CVs). In an experiment involving 22 leading LLMs, each model was
systematically given one job description along with a pair of
profession-matched CVs, one bearing a male first name, the other a female first
name, and asked to select the more suitable candidate for the job. Each CV pair
was presented twice, with names swapped to ensure that any observed preferences
in candidate selection stemmed from gendered names cues. Despite identical
professional qualifications across genders, all LLMs consistently favored
female-named candidates across 70 different professions. Adding an explicit
gender field (male/female) to the CVs further increased the preference for
female applicants. When gendered names were replaced with gender-neutral
identifiers "Candidate A" and "Candidate B", several models displayed a
preference to select "Candidate A". Counterbalancing gender assignment between
these gender-neutral identifiers resulted in gender parity in candidate
selection. When asked to rate CVs in isolation rather than compare pairs, LLMs
assigned slightly higher average scores to female CVs overall, but the effect
size was negligible. Including preferred pronouns (he/him or she/her) next to a
candidate's name slightly increased the odds of the candidate being selected
regardless of gender. Finally, most models exhibited a substantial positional
bias to select the candidate listed first in the prompt. These findings
underscore the need for caution when deploying LLMs in high-stakes autonomous
decision-making contexts and raise doubts about whether LLMs consistently apply
principled reasoning.

### [10] [Towards Robust Evaluation of STEM Education: Leveraging MLLMs in Project-Based Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17050)
*Yanhao Jia,Xinyi Wu,Qinglin Zhang,Yiran Qin,Luwei Xiao,Shuai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PBLBench是一个新的基准测试，旨在评估基于领域知识和长上下文理解的复杂推理能力，填补现有基准在自由输出结构和专家验证上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准缺乏自由输出结构和严格专家验证，且多模态大语言模型在教育任务中的应用因幻觉和不稳定性受限。

Method: 采用层次分析法（AHP）生成专家驱动的结构化评估标准，并评估15种领先MLLMs/LLMs的性能。

Result: 最先进模型在PBLBench上仅达到59%的排名准确率，显示其挑战性。

Conclusion: PBLBench有望推动更强大AI代理的开发，减轻教师负担并提升教育效率。

Abstract: Project-Based Learning (PBL) involves a variety of highly correlated
multimodal data, making it a vital educational approach within STEM
disciplines. With the rapid development of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs), researchers have begun exploring their potential to enhance tasks such
as information retrieval, knowledge comprehension, and data generation in
educational settings. However, existing benchmarks fall short in providing both
a free-form output structure and a rigorous human expert validation process,
limiting their effectiveness in evaluating real-world educational tasks.
Additionally, few methods have developed automated pipelines to assist with the
complex responsibilities of teachers leveraging MLLMs, largely due to model
hallucination and instability, which lead to unreliable implementation. To
address this gap, we introduce PBLBench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate
complex reasoning grounded in domain-specific knowledge and long-context
understanding, thereby challenging models with tasks that closely resemble
those handled by human experts. To establish reliable ground truth, we adopt
the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), utilizing expert-driven pairwise
comparisons to derive structured and weighted evaluation criteria. We assess
the performance of 15 leading MLLMs/LLMs using PBLBench and demonstrate that
even the most advanced models achieve only 59% rank accuracy, underscoring the
significant challenges presented by this benchmark. We believe PBLBench will
serve as a catalyst for the development of more capable AI agents, ultimately
aiming to alleviate teacher workload and enhance educational productivity.

### [11] [Embedding-to-Prefix: Parameter-Efficient Personalization for Pre-Trained Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17051)
*Bernd Huber,Ghazal Fazelnia,Andreas Damianou,Sebastian Peleato,Max Lefarov,Praveen Ravichandran,Marco De Nadai,Mounia Lalmas-Roellke,Paul N. Bennett*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Embedding-to-Prefix（E2P）的参数高效方法，通过将预计算的上下文嵌入注入LLM的隐藏表示空间，实现个性化输出，同时避免昂贵的微调或令牌密集提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）能生成上下文相关内容，但如何利用预存的用户表征（如偏好或行为的嵌入）实现高效个性化仍具挑战性。

Method: E2P通过学习将预计算的上下文嵌入投影为单个软令牌前缀，注入LLM的隐藏表示空间，保持主干模型冻结。

Result: 在Persona-Chat、PENS数据集及音乐/播客消费场景中，E2P保留了上下文信号，性能优异且计算开销低。

Conclusion: E2P为生成式AI系统的上下文化提供了一种可扩展、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating contextually relevant
content. However, tailoring these outputs to individual users for effective
personalization is a significant challenge. While rich user-specific
information often exists as pre-existing user representations, such as
embeddings learned from preferences or behaviors, current methods to leverage
these for LLM personalization typically require costly fine-tuning or
token-heavy prompting. We propose Embedding-to-Prefix (E2P), a
parameter-efficient method that injects pre-computed context embeddings into an
LLM's hidden representation space through a learned projection to a single soft
token prefix. This enables effective personalization while keeping the backbone
model frozen and avoiding expensive adaptation techniques. We evaluate E2P
across two public datasets and in a production setting: dialogue
personalization on Persona-Chat, contextual headline generation on PENS, and
large-scale personalization for music and podcast consumption. Results show
that E2P preserves contextual signals and achieves strong performance with
minimal computational overhead, offering a scalable, efficient solution for
contextualizing generative AI systems.

TL;DR: SpecEdge是一个边缘辅助推理框架，通过将LLM工作负载分配到边缘和服务器GPU上，利用推测解码方案提高效率，显著降低成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前以服务器为中心的系统忽视了边缘的消费级GPU资源，导致LLM服务成本高且资源密集。

Method: 采用推测解码方案，在边缘和服务器GPU之间分配工作负载，通过网络仅交换令牌输出，并结合主动边缘草拟和管道感知调度。

Result: 实验显示，SpecEdge将整体成本效率提升1.91倍，服务器吞吐量提高2.22倍，令牌间延迟降低11.24%。

Conclusion: SpecEdge为LLM服务提供了一种可扩展且经济高效的范式。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) power many modern applications, but serving them
at scale remains costly and resource-intensive. Current server-centric systems
overlook consumer-grade GPUs at the edge. We introduce SpecEdge, an
edge-assisted inference framework that splits LLM workloads between edge and
server GPUs using a speculative decoding scheme, exchanging only token outputs
over the network. SpecEdge employs proactive edge drafting to overlap edge
token creation with server verification and pipeline-aware scheduling that
interleaves multiple user requests to increase server-side throughput.
Experiments show SpecEdge enhances overall cost efficiency by 1.91x through
achieving 2.22x server throughput, and reduces inter token latency by 11.24%
compared to a server-only baseline, introducing a scalable, cost-effective
paradigm for LLM serving.

*Ou Jiamin,Eikmans Emile,Buskens Vincent,Pankowska Paulina,Shan Yuli*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在社交交换情境中的表现，发现它们能模拟人类的信任与互惠行为，但行为受角色设定影响显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs如何将语言理解能力转化为社交互动行为，揭示其社会偏好和交互推理能力。

Method: 使用ChatGPT-4、Claude和Bard参与经济信任游戏，测试其在不同角色设定下的信任与互惠行为。

Result: LLMs能模拟人类信任行为，但行为受角色设定影响较大；ChatGPT-4在无私角色中表现最佳。

Conclusion: LLMs在社交互动中表现出一定的人类行为特征，但稳定性和可重复性仍需改进。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in understanding human languages, this study explores how they translate this
understanding into social exchange contexts that capture certain essences of
real world human interactions. Three LLMs - ChatGPT-4, Claude, and Bard - were
placed in economic trust games where players balance self-interest with trust
and reciprocity, making decisions that reveal their social preferences and
interactive reasoning abilities. Our study shows that LLMs deviate from pure
self-interest and exhibit trust and reciprocity even without being prompted to
adopt a specific persona. In the simplest one-shot interaction, LLMs emulated
how human players place trust at the beginning of such a game. Larger
human-machine divergences emerged in scenarios involving trust repayment or
multi-round interactions, where decisions were influenced by both social
preferences and interactive reasoning. LLMs responses varied significantly when
prompted to adopt personas like selfish or unselfish players, with the impact
outweighing differences between models or game types. Response of ChatGPT-4, in
an unselfish or neutral persona, resembled the highest trust and reciprocity,
surpassing humans, Claude, and Bard. Claude and Bard displayed trust and
reciprocity levels that sometimes exceeded and sometimes fell below human
choices. When given selfish personas, all LLMs showed lower trust and
reciprocity than humans. Interactive reasoning to the actions of counterparts
or changing game mechanics appeared to be random rather than stable,
reproducible characteristics in the response of LLMs, though some improvements
were observed when ChatGPT-4 responded in selfish or unselfish personas.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为METHOD的新型Transformer架构，专门针对电子健康记录中的临床序列建模挑战，通过三项创新技术显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer在医疗领域的应用面临不规则采样、复杂时间依赖和上下文关系等独特挑战，需要专门优化的架构。

Method: METHOD结合了患者感知注意力机制、自适应滑动窗口注意力方案和动态跳跃连接的U-Net架构，以高效处理临床序列。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据库上的实验表明，METHOD在预测高严重性病例和长序列处理方面优于现有模型ETHOS，且性能稳定。

Conclusion: METHOD为医疗领域的Transformer应用提供了更准确、临床相关且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in transformer architectures have revolutionised natural
language processing, but their application to healthcare domains presents
unique challenges. Patient timelines are characterised by irregular sampling,
variable temporal dependencies, and complex contextual relationships that
differ substantially from traditional language tasks. This paper introduces
\METHOD~(Modular Efficient Transformer for Health Outcome Discovery), a novel
transformer architecture specifically designed to address the challenges of
clinical sequence modelling in electronic health records. \METHOD~integrates
three key innovations: (1) a patient-aware attention mechanism that prevents
information leakage whilst enabling efficient batch processing; (2) an adaptive
sliding window attention scheme that captures multi-scale temporal
dependencies; and (3) a U-Net inspired architecture with dynamic skip
connections for effective long sequence processing. Evaluations on the MIMIC-IV
database demonstrate that \METHOD~consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art
\ETHOS~model, particularly in predicting high-severity cases that require
urgent clinical intervention. \METHOD~exhibits stable performance across
varying inference lengths, a crucial feature for clinical deployment where
patient histories vary significantly in length. Analysis of learned embeddings
reveals that \METHOD~better preserves clinical hierarchies and relationships
between medical concepts. These results suggest that \METHOD~represents a
significant advancement in transformer architectures optimised for healthcare
applications, providing more accurate and clinically relevant predictions
whilst maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: The study aims to enhance mathematics education accessibility for
hard-of-hearing students by developing an accurate Palestinian sign language
PSL recognition system using advanced artificial intelligence techniques. Due
to the scarcity of digital resources for PSL, a custom dataset comprising 41
mathematical gesture classes was created, and recorded by PSL experts to ensure

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI尤其是LLMs在教育领域的潜力巨大，但缺乏对其在标准化考试准备中能力的系统评估。

Method: 通过ESTBOOK基准（包含29种题型和10,576个问题）评估LLMs的准确性和推理效率，并提出分解分析框架。

Result: 评估结果揭示了LLMs在教育场景中的能力，并提出了提升其作为智能辅导系统可靠性的策略。

Conclusion: LLMs在标准化考试准备中具有潜力，但仍需进一步优化以提高其可靠性。

Abstract: AI is transforming education by enabling powerful tools that enhance learning
experiences. Among recent advancements, large language models (LLMs) hold
particular promise for revolutionizing how learners interact with educational
content. In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs to support
standardized test preparation by focusing on English Standardized Tests (ESTs).
Specifically, we assess their ability to generate accurate and contextually
appropriate solutions across a diverse set of EST question types. We introduce
ESTBOOK, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the capabilities of
LLMs in solving EST questions. ESTBOOK aggregates five widely recognized tests,
encompassing 29 question types and over 10,576 questions across multiple
modalities, including text, images, audio, tables, and mathematical symbols.
Using ESTBOOK, we systematically evaluate both the accuracy and inference
efficiency of LLMs. Additionally, we propose a breakdown analysis framework
that decomposes complex EST questions into task-specific solution steps. This
framework allows us to isolate and assess LLM performance at each stage of the
reasoning process. Evaluation findings offer insights into the capability of
LLMs in educational contexts and point toward targeted strategies for improving
their reliability as intelligent tutoring systems.

Conclusion: DO-RAG通过可追溯性、适应性和高效性能，为多领域高精度QA提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Domain-specific QA systems require not just generative fluency but high
factual accuracy grounded in structured expert knowledge. While recent
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks improve context recall, they
struggle with integrating heterogeneous data and maintaining reasoning
consistency. To address these challenges, we propose DO-RAG, a scalable and
customizable hybrid QA framework that integrates multi-level knowledge graph
construction with semantic vector retrieval. Our system employs a novel agentic
chain-of-thought architecture to extract structured relationships from
unstructured, multimodal documents, constructing dynamic knowledge graphs that
enhance retrieval precision. At query time, DO-RAG fuses graph and vector
retrieval results to generate context-aware responses, followed by
hallucination mitigation via grounded refinement. Experimental evaluations in
the database and electrical domains show near-perfect recall and over 94%
answer relevancy, with DO-RAG outperforming baseline frameworks by up to
33.38%. By combining traceability, adaptability, and performance efficiency,
DO-RAG offers a reliable foundation for multi-domain, high-precision QA at

TL;DR: SALMONN-omni是一种新型的全双工语音LLM，通过动态思考机制实现自然对话，性能优于现有开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有全双工对话系统因模块化架构导致的错误累积和关键挑战（如上下文相关打断和回声消除）。

Method: 提出SALMONN-omni，一种不依赖音频编解码器的单LLM模型，采用动态思考机制切换听/说状态。

Result: 在语音问答和开放域对话基准测试中，性能提升30%，并在复杂对话场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: SALMONN-omni展示了全双工语音LLM的潜力，性能接近半双工系统且训练数据更少。

Abstract: In order to enable fluid and natural human-machine speech interaction,
existing full-duplex conversational systems often adopt modular architectures
with auxiliary components such as voice activity detectors, interrupters,
conversation state predictors, or multiple LLMs. These systems, however, suffer
from error accumulation across modules and struggle with key challenges such as
context-dependent barge-in and echo cancellation. Recent approaches, most
notably Moshi, simplify the pipeline by injecting audio codecs into the token
space of a single LLM. However, such methods still incur significant
performance degradation when operating on the speech rather than text modality.
In this paper, we introduce SALMONN-omni, the first single, standalone
full-duplex speech LLM that operates without audio codecs in its token space.
It features a novel dynamic thinking mechanism within the LLM backbone,
enabling the model to learn when to transition between speaking and listening
states. Experiments on widely used benchmarks for spoken question answering and
open-domain dialogue show that SALMONN-omni achieves at least 30\% relative
performance improvement over existing open-source full-duplex models and
performs highly competitively to half-duplex and turn-based systems, despite
using substantially less training data. Moreover, SALMONN-omni demonstrates
strong performance in complex conversational scenarios, including turn-taking,
backchanneling, echo cancellation and context-dependent barge-in, with further
improvements achieved through reinforcement learning. Some demo conversations
between user and SALMONN-omni are provided in the following repository

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在视觉任务中表现优异，但仍受幻觉问题困扰，亟需解决。

Method: MoD通过评估模型对图像标记的注意力正确性，动态选择互补或对比策略来增强或抑制信息。

Result: 实验表明，MoD在多个主流基准测试中显著优于现有解码方法，有效减少幻觉。

Conclusion: MoD为缓解LVLMs中的幻觉问题提供了一种有效解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities
across various visual tasks, yet they remain hindered by the persistent
challenge of hallucinations. To address this critical issue, we propose Mixture
of Decoding (MoD), a novel approach for hallucination mitigation that
dynamically adapts decoding strategies by evaluating the correctness of the
model's attention on image tokens. Specifically, MoD measures the consistency
between outputs generated from the original image tokens and those derived from
the model's attended image tokens, to distinguish the correctness
aforementioned. If the outputs are consistent, indicating correct attention,
MoD employs a complementary strategy to amplify critical information.
Conversely, if the outputs are inconsistent, suggesting erroneous attention,
MoD utilizes a contrastive strategy to suppress misleading information.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoD significantly outperforms existing
decoding methods across multiple mainstream benchmarks, effectively mitigating
hallucinations in LVLMs. The code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Synthetic Data RL的框架，通过仅使用任务定义生成的合成数据进行强化学习微调，显著减少了对人工标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习依赖大规模人工标注数据，限制了其广泛应用。本文旨在通过合成数据减少这一依赖。

Method: 方法包括从任务定义生成问答对，根据模型可解性调整问题难度，并基于平均通过率选择问题用于强化学习训练。

Result: 在多个任务上显著提升模型性能，例如GSM8K上绝对提升29.2%，且优于监督微调和部分人工数据RL。

Conclusion: Synthetic Data RL通过减少人工标注需求，实现了可扩展且高效的模型适应。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful way to adapt foundation models to
specialized tasks, but its reliance on large-scale human-labeled data limits
broad adoption. We introduce Synthetic Data RL, a simple and general framework
that reinforcement fine-tunes models using only synthetic data generated from a
task definition. Our method first generates question and answer pairs from the
task definition and retrieved documents, then adapts the difficulty of the
question based on model solvability, and selects questions using the average
pass rate of the model across samples for RL training. On Qwen-2.5-7B, our
method achieves a 29.2% absolute improvement over the base model on GSM8K (+2.9
pp vs. instruction-tuned, +6.6 pp vs. Self-Instruct), 8.7% on MATH, 13.1% on
GPQA (+7.0 pp vs. SynthLLM), 8.9% on MedQA, 17.7% on CQA (law) and 13.7% on CFA
(finance). It surpasses supervised fine-tuning under the same data budget and
nearly matches RL with full human data across datasets (e.g., +17.2 pp on
GSM8K). Adding 100 human demonstrations improves the performance of GSM8K only
by 0.4 pp, showing a limited added value. By reducing human data annotation,
Synthetic Data RL enables scalable and efficient RL-based model adaptation.

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language
models LLMs, have shown promising capabilities in transforming rare disease
research. This survey paper explores the integration of LLMs in the analysis of
rare diseases, highlighting significant strides and pivotal studies that
leverage textual data to uncover insights and patterns critical for diagnosis,
treatment, and patient care. While current research predominantly employs
textual data, the potential for multimodal data integration combining genetic,
imaging, and electronic health records stands as a promising frontier. We
review foundational papers that demonstrate the application of LLMs in
identifying and extracting relevant medical information, simulating intelligent
conversational agents for patient interaction, and enabling the formulation of
accurate and timely diagnoses. Furthermore, this paper discusses the challenges
and ethical considerations inherent in deploying LLMs, including data privacy,
model transparency, and the need for robust, inclusive data sets. As part of
this exploration, we present a section on experimentation that utilizes
multiple LLMs alongside structured questionnaires, specifically designed for
diagnostic purposes in the context of different diseases. We conclude with
future perspectives on the evolution of LLMs towards truly multimodal
platforms, which would integrate diverse data types to provide a more
comprehensive understanding of rare diseases, ultimately fostering better
outcomes in clinical settings.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种用于多语言和多图片环境下轻度认知障碍（MCI）检测的框架，通过对比学习、图像模态和专家乘积策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要针对英语单图片场景，而多语言和多图片环境下的MCI检测面临新挑战。

Method: 框架包含三个部分：监督对比学习增强表征、引入图像模态、使用专家乘积策略减少虚假相关和过拟合。

Result: 框架显著提升了MCI检测性能，UAR提高7.1%，F1分数提高2.9%，对比学习对文本模态效果更显著。

Conclusion: 该框架在多语言和多图片环境下有效提升了MCI检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment from picture descriptions is critical yet
challenging, especially in multilingual and multiple picture settings. Prior
work has primarily focused on English speakers describing a single picture
(e.g., the 'Cookie Theft'). The TAUKDIAL-2024 challenge expands this scope by
introducing multilingual speakers and multiple pictures, which presents new
challenges in analyzing picture-dependent content. To address these challenges,
we propose a framework with three components: (1) enhancing discriminative
representation learning via supervised contrastive learning, (2) involving
image modality rather than relying solely on speech and text modalities, and
(3) applying a Product of Experts (PoE) strategy to mitigate spurious
correlations and overfitting. Our framework improves MCI detection performance,
achieving a +7.1% increase in Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) (from 68.1% to
75.2%) and a +2.9% increase in F1 score (from 80.6% to 83.5%) compared to the
text unimodal baseline. Notably, the contrastive learning component yields
greater gains for the text modality compared to speech. These results highlight
our framework's effectiveness in multilingual and multi-picture MCI detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线健康讨论中的用户毒性行为常引发社会冲突或传播危险行为，传统方法（如检测和删除）效果有限且可能适得其反。

Method: 采用基于协同过滤的机器学习方法，预测用户在Reddit上与特定子社区的COVID相关讨论中的毒性行为。

Result: 预测性能超过80%，能够有效避免冲突用户与子社区的配对。

Conclusion: 预测性方法优于传统反应性方法，可有效减少健康讨论中的毒性行为。

Abstract: In health-related topics, user toxicity in online discussions frequently
becomes a source of social conflict or promotion of dangerous, unscientific
behaviour; common approaches for battling it include different forms of
detection, flagging and/or removal of existing toxic comments, which is often
counterproductive for platforms and users alike. In this work, we propose the
alternative of combatting user toxicity predictively, anticipating where a user
could interact toxically in health-related online discussions. Applying a
Collaborative Filtering-based Machine Learning methodology, we predict the
toxicity in COVID-related conversations between any user and subcommunity of
Reddit, surpassing 80% predictive performance in relevant metrics, and allowing
us to prevent the pairing of conflicting users and subcommunities.

Motivation: T-ASR的延迟输出会导致EP错误或延迟，影响用户体验，如打断用户或增加感知延迟。

Method: 引入词尾标记和延迟惩罚解决延迟输出问题，并使用辅助网络实现可靠的帧级语音活动检测以减少EP延迟。

Result: 在Switchboard对话语音语料库上验证了方法的有效性，并与延迟惩罚方法进行了对比。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效改进EP，减少延迟和错误，提升ASR系统的用户体验。

Abstract: ASR endpointing (EP) plays a major role in delivering a good user experience
in products supporting human or artificial agents in human-human/machine
conversations. Transducer-based ASR (T-ASR) is an end-to-end (E2E) ASR
modelling technique preferred for streaming. A major limitation of T-ASR is
delayed emission of ASR outputs, which could lead to errors or delays in EP.
Inaccurate EP will cut the user off while speaking, returning incomplete
transcript while delays in EP will increase the perceived latency, degrading
the user experience. We propose methods to improve EP by addressing delayed
emission along with EP mistakes. To address the delayed emission problem, we
introduce an end-of-word token at the end of each word, along with a delay
penalty. The EP delay is addressed by obtaining a reliable frame-level speech
activity detection using an auxiliary network. We apply the proposed methods on
Switchboard conversational speech corpus and evaluate it against a delay
penalty method.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型如何通过深层表示捕捉文本的抽象特征（如风格），而非仅事实内容，并展示了这种表示在作者区分和文学分析中的潜在应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型如何将整个提示的累积信息压缩到单个嵌入中，尤其是抽象特征（如风格）的编码方式。

Method: 使用文学作品片段（10-100个标记）分析其在潜在空间中的分布，比较不同作者作品的嵌入关系。

Result: 发现短文本片段在潜在空间中独立于下一个标记预测而分离，且同一作者的作品嵌入更相似，表明模型能捕捉风格特征。

Conclusion: 语言模型的信息处理和压缩能力非常复杂，其风格编码可用于作者归属和文学分析。

Abstract: Large language models use high-dimensional latent spaces to encode and
process textual information. Much work has investigated how the conceptual
content of words translates into geometrical relationships between their vector
representations. Fewer studies analyze how the cumulative information of an
entire prompt becomes condensed into individual embeddings under the action of
transformer layers. We use literary pieces to show that information about
intangible, rather than factual, aspects of the prompt are contained in deep
representations. We observe that short excerpts (10 - 100 tokens) from
different novels separate in the latent space independently from what
next-token prediction they converge towards. Ensembles from books from the same
authors are much more entangled than across authors, suggesting that embeddings
encode stylistic features. This geometry of style may have applications for
authorship attribution and literary analysis, but most importantly reveals the
sophistication of information processing and compression accomplished by
language models.

Result: 中间层（特别是2、3、5层）变化最显著，62%的注意力头熵值降低，针对性LoRA适配性能优于标准微调。

Conclusion: 该研究为神经网络在摘要任务中的信息选择和压缩机制提供了新见解，弥合了黑盒评估与机制理解之间的差距。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability research seeks to reveal the inner workings of
large language models, yet most work focuses on classification or generative
tasks rather than summarization. This paper presents an interpretability
framework for analyzing how GPT-like models adapt to summarization tasks. We
conduct differential analysis between pre-trained and fine-tuned models,
quantifying changes in attention patterns and internal activations. By
identifying specific layers and attention heads that undergo significant
transformation, we locate the "summarization circuit" within the model
architecture. Our findings reveal that middle layers (particularly 2, 3, and 5)
exhibit the most dramatic changes, with 62% of attention heads showing
decreased entropy, indicating a shift toward focused information selection. We
demonstrate that targeted LoRA adaptation of these identified circuits achieves
significant performance improvement over standard LoRA fine-tuning while
requiring fewer training epochs. This work bridges the gap between black-box
evaluation and mechanistic understanding, providing insights into how neural
networks perform information selection and compression during summarization.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LAPS-SD的半预见性请求调度算法，用于优化LLM推理中的请求调度，显著降低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅基于预测输出长度估计执行时间，忽略了令牌接受率的影响，导致调度效率低下。

Method: LAPS-SD通过动态优先级队列和请求抢占机制，适应令牌接受率的变化，准确估计执行时间并优化调度。

Result: 实验表明，LAPS-SD将推理延迟降低了约39%。

Conclusion: LAPS-SD是一种高效的调度算法，适用于动态令牌接受率场景，显著提升LLM推理性能。

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by
employing a small speculative model (SSM) to generate multiple candidate tokens
and verify them using the LLM in parallel. This technique has been widely
integrated into LLM inference serving systems. However, inference requests
typically exhibit uncertain execution time, which poses a significant challenge
of efficiently scheduling requests in these systems. Existing work estimates
execution time based solely on predicted output length, which could be
inaccurate because execution time depends on both output length and token
acceptance rate of verification by the LLM. In this paper, we propose a
semi-clairvoyant request scheduling algorithm called
Least-Attained/Perceived-Service for Speculative Decoding (LAPS-SD). Given a
number of inference requests, LAPS-SD can effectively minimize average
inference latency by adaptively scheduling requests according to their features
during decoding. When the token acceptance rate is dynamic and execution time
is difficult to estimate, LAPS-SD maintains multiple priority queues and allows
request execution preemption across different queues. Once the token acceptance
rate becomes stable, LAPS-SD can accurately estimate the execution time and
schedule requests accordingly. Extensive experiments show that LAPS-SD reduces
inference latency by approximately 39\% compared to state-of-the-art scheduling
methods.

Method: 74名日本英语学习者分别与人类导师和对话代理完成任务后填写量表，通过Cronbach's alpha系数和验证性因子分析检验量表的效度和信度。

Result: 量表成功捕捉到人类导师与对话代理在对话体验质量上的差异。

Conclusion: 开发的量表能有效评估多模态对话系统的用户体验质量。

Abstract: This study aimed to develop and validate two scales of engagement and rapport
to evaluate the user experience quality with multimodal dialogue systems in the
context of foreign language learning. The scales were designed based on
theories of engagement in educational psychology, social psychology, and second
language acquisition.Seventy-four Japanese learners of English completed
roleplay and discussion tasks with trained human tutors and a dialog agent.
After each dialogic task was completed, they responded to the scales of
engagement and rapport. The validity and reliability of the scales were
investigated through two analyses. We first conducted analysis of Cronbach's
alpha coefficient and a series of confirmatory factor analyses to test the
structural validity of the scales and the reliability of our designed items. We
then compared the scores of engagement and rapport between the dialogue with
human tutors and the one with a dialogue agent. The results revealed that our
scales succeeded in capturing the difference in the dialogue experience quality
between the human interlocutors and the dialogue agent from multiple
perspectives.

Abstract: The speech tokenizer plays a crucial role in recent speech tasks, generally
serving as a bridge between speech signals and language models. While
low-frame-rate codecs are widely employed as speech tokenizers, the impact of
frame rates on speech tokens remains underexplored. In this study, we
investigate how varying frame rates affect speech tokenization by examining
Mandarin and English, two typologically distinct languages. We encode speech at
different frame rates and evaluate the resulting semantic tokens in the speech
recognition task. Our findings reveal that frame rate variations influence
speech tokenization differently for each language, highlighting the interplay
between frame rates, phonetic density, and language-specific acoustic features.
The results provide insights into optimizing frame rate selection for speech
tokenizers, with implications for automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech,
and other speech-related applications.

Result: 实验表明，GloSS在多种LLMs上实现了最先进的去毒效果，同时保留了模型的通用能力，且无需大规模数据或重新训练。

Conclusion: 全局毒性子空间是去毒的关键，GloSS方法高效且实用。

Abstract: This paper investigates the underlying mechanisms of toxicity generation in
Large Language Models (LLMs) and proposes an effective detoxification approach.
Prior work typically considers the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) as the main
source of toxicity, representing toxic regions as a set of toxic vectors or
layer-wise subspaces. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that the global
toxic subspace offers a more effective and comprehensive representation of
toxic region within the model. Building on this insight, we propose GloSS
(Global Toxic Subspace Suppression), a lightweight, four-stage method that
mitigates toxicity by identifying and removing the global toxic subspace from
the parameters of FFN. Experiments across a range of LLMs show that GloSS
achieves state-of-the-art detoxification performance while preserving the
models general capabilities, without requiring large-scale data or model
retraining.

*Davide Picca*

TL;DR: 论文主张从符号学而非认知系统角度理解大语言模型（LLMs），强调其功能是符号重组与意义生成，而非模拟人类思维。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战将LLMs视为认知系统的流行观点，避免拟人化，更精确地理解其在文化过程中的作用。

Method: 通过理论分析和实际案例，展示LLMs作为符号代理的功能，其输出可视为开放的诠释行为。

Result: 提出符号学范式，强调意义的语境性和社会嵌入性，为LLMs研究提供更严谨的框架。

Conclusion: LLMs是符号生态中的技术参与者，改变人类的读写与意义生成方式，需重新思考语言、诠释及AI在知识生产中的角色。

Abstract: This paper challenges the prevailing tendency to frame Large Language Models
(LLMs) as cognitive systems, arguing instead for a semiotic perspective that
situates these models within the broader dynamics of sign manipulation and
meaning-making. Rather than assuming that LLMs understand language or simulate
human thought, we propose that their primary function is to recombine,
recontextualize, and circulate linguistic forms based on probabilistic
associations. By shifting from a cognitivist to a semiotic framework, we avoid
anthropomorphism and gain a more precise understanding of how LLMs participate
in cultural processes, not by thinking, but by generating texts that invite
interpretation. Through theoretical analysis and practical examples, the paper
demonstrates how LLMs function as semiotic agents whose outputs can be treated
as interpretive acts, open to contextual negotiation and critical reflection.
We explore applications in literature, philosophy, education, and cultural
production, emphasizing how LLMs can serve as tools for creativity, dialogue,
and critical inquiry. The semiotic paradigm foregrounds the situated,
contingent, and socially embedded nature of meaning, offering a more rigorous
and ethically aware framework for studying and using LLMs. Ultimately, this
approach reframes LLMs as technological participants in an ongoing ecology of
signs. They do not possess minds, but they alter how we read, write, and make
meaning, compelling us to reconsider the foundations of language,
interpretation, and the role of artificial systems in the production of
knowledge.

TL;DR: 通过质量优先的对齐策略，提升摩洛哥阿拉伯语（Darija）在开源大语言模型中的表现，同时保持模型的跨语言推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源大语言模型对摩洛哥阿拉伯语的支持不足，导致用户需依赖笨重的阿拉伯语适配器或牺牲模型的推理能力。

Method: 将三个紧凑指令集（LIMA 1K、DEITA 6K、TULU 50K）翻译为Darija，保留部分英文原指令，并加入数学、编程和科学提示。使用LoRA微调的Gemma 3-4B模型训练5K混合指令。

Result: DarijaMMLU得分从32.8提升至42.7，加入TULU部分后进一步升至47.5，且不影响英文表现。扩展至Gemma 3-27B后，GemMaroc-27B在DarijaMMLU上达到61.6，超越Atlas-Chat。

Conclusion: 该方法以低计算成本（48 GPU.h）实现了Darija的高效支持，同时保留了模型的数学和通用推理能力，为绿色AI和包容性语言技术提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Open-source large language models (LLMs) still marginalise Moroccan Arabic
(Darija), forcing practitioners either to bolt on heavyweight Arabic adapters
or to sacrifice the very reasoning skills that make LLMs useful. We show that a
rigorously quality-over-quantity alignment strategy can surface fluent Darija
while safeguarding the backbone s cross-lingual reasoning at a sliver of the
usual compute. We translate three compact instruction suites LIMA 1 K, DEITA 6
K and TULU 50 K into Darija, preserve 20 of the English originals, and add
mathematics, coding and scientific prompts. A LoRA-tuned Gemma 3-4B trained on
5 K mixed instructions lifts DarijaMMLU from 32.8 to 42.7 ; adding the
reasoning-dense TULU portion pushes it to 47.5 with no English regression.
Scaling the identical recipe to Gemma 3-27B produces GemMaroc-27B, which
matches Atlas-Chat on DarijaMMLU (61.6 ) and leaps ahead on Darija commonsense,
scoring 60.5 on HellaSwag versus Atlas-Chat s 48.4 . Crucially, GemMaroc
retains Gemma-27B s strong maths and general-reasoning ability, showing only
minimal movement on GSM8K and English benchmarks. The entire model is trained
in just 48 GPU.h, underscoring a Green AI pathway to inclusive, sustainable
language technology. We release code, data and checkpoints to spur
Darija-centric applications in education, public services and everyday digital
interaction.

Motivation: 解决LLM研究中注意力机制从短上下文训练到长上下文推理的泛化问题。

Method: 提出两种条件（尺度不变的总注意力和稀疏性），并在高斯假设下通过位置相关变换实现。

Result: 实验表明该方案在零样本泛化中显著降低验证损失，并有效支持长上下文检索。

Conclusion: 提出的尺度不变注意力机制在长上下文推理中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: One persistent challenge in LLM research is the development of attention
mechanisms that are able to generalise from training on shorter contexts to
inference on longer contexts. We propose two conditions that we expect all
effective long context attention mechanisms to have: scale-invariant total
attention, and scale-invariant attention sparsity. Under a Gaussian assumption,
we show that a simple position-dependent transformation of the attention logits
is sufficient for these conditions to hold. Experimentally we find that the
resulting scale-invariant attention scheme gives considerable benefits in terms
of validation loss when zero-shot generalising from training on short contexts
to validation on longer contexts, and is effective at long-context retrieval.

Motivation: 大语言模型在问答任务中因缺乏事实知识和幻觉问题表现受限，现有检索增强生成方法依赖上下文学习，性能受限于模型的基本推理能力。

Method: 提出Mujica框架，包括问题分解为子问题的规划器和基于检索与推理的解答器；引入MyGO，一种用最大似然估计替代传统策略梯度更新的强化学习方法。

Conclusion: Mujica-MyGO通过结合规划与优化方法，有效解决了大语言模型在复杂问答中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable versatility, due to
the lack of factual knowledge, their application to Question Answering (QA)
tasks remains hindered by hallucination.
  While Retrieval-Augmented Generation mitigates these issues by integrating
external knowledge, existing approaches rely heavily on in-context learning,
whose performance is constrained by the fundamental reasoning capabilities of
LLMs.
  In this paper, we propose Mujica, a Multi-hop Joint Intelligence for Complex
Question Answering, comprising a planner that decomposes questions into a
directed acyclic graph of subquestions and a worker that resolves questions via
retrieval and reasoning. Additionally, we introduce MyGO (Minimalist policy
Gradient Optimization), a novel reinforcement learning method that replaces
traditional policy gradient updates with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) by
sampling trajectories from an asymptotically optimal policy. MyGO eliminates
the need for gradient rescaling and reference models, ensuring stable and
efficient training.
  Empirical results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
Mujica-MyGO in enhancing multi-hop QA performance for various LLMs, offering a
scalable and resource-efficient solution for complex QA tasks.

Abstract: This chapter explores the evolution, classification, and health implications
of food processing, while emphasizing the transformative role of machine
learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and data science in advancing food
informatics. It begins with a historical overview and a critical review of
traditional classification frameworks such as NOVA, Nutri-Score, and SIGA,
highlighting their strengths and limitations, particularly the subjectivity and
reproducibility challenges that hinder epidemiological research and public
policy. To address these issues, the chapter presents novel computational
approaches, including FoodProX, a random forest model trained on nutrient
composition data to infer processing levels and generate a continuous FPro
score. It also explores how large language models like BERT and BioBERT can
semantically embed food descriptions and ingredient lists for predictive tasks,
even in the presence of missing data. A key contribution of the chapter is a
novel case study using the Open Food Facts database, showcasing how multimodal
AI models can integrate structured and unstructured data to classify foods at

TL;DR: 论文提出Adversarial Scenario Extrapolation (ASE)，一种通过Chain-of-Thought推理增强LLM鲁棒性和无缝性的框架，显著降低攻击成功率和毒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法通常只针对单一威胁或牺牲用户体验，无法应对多样化和新型攻击。

Method: ASE利用Chain-of-Thought推理，引导LLM在生成响应前自我生成对抗场景并制定防御策略。

Result: 在四个对抗基准测试中，ASE几乎将越狱攻击成功率降至零，毒性极低，拒绝率<4%，优于六种现有防御方法。

Conclusion: ASE通过将对抗感知转化为内在认知过程，为安全自然的人机交互设定了新范式。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities, but remain
susceptible to a growing spectrum of safety risks, including jailbreaks, toxic
content, hallucinations, and bias. Existing defenses often address only a
single threat type or resort to rigid outright rejection, sacrificing user
experience and failing to generalize across diverse and novel attacks. This
paper introduces Adversarial Scenario Extrapolation (ASE), a novel
inference-time computation framework that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning to simultaneously enhance LLM robustness and seamlessness. ASE guides
the LLM through a self-generative process of contemplating potential
adversarial scenarios and formulating defensive strategies before generating a
response to the user query. Comprehensive evaluation on four adversarial
benchmarks with four latest LLMs shows that ASE achieves near-zero jailbreak
attack success rates and minimal toxicity, while slashing outright rejections
to <4%. ASE outperforms six state-of-the-art defenses in
robustness-seamlessness trade-offs, with 92-99% accuracy on adversarial Q&A and
4-10x lower bias scores. By transforming adversarial perception into an
intrinsic cognitive process, ASE sets a new paradigm for secure and natural
human-AI interaction.

Motivation: 探索文本LLM模型是否能够通过训练文本数据，自然发展出理解和处理图像与音频的能力。

Method: 采用自回归LLM模型，输入图像块、音频波形或标记，输出嵌入或分类标签，验证其在音频和图像分类任务中的通用性。

Conclusion: 文本LLM能够学习强大的内部电路，通过激活必要连接实现多任务应用，无需从头训练模型。

Abstract: This paper presents a fascinating find: By training an auto-regressive LLM
model on text tokens, the text model inherently develops internally an ability
to understand images and audio, thereby developing the ability to see and hear
just by reading. Popular audio and visual LLM models fine-tune text LLM models
to give text output conditioned on images and audio embeddings. On the other
hand, our architecture takes in patches of images, audio waveforms or tokens as
input. It gives us the embeddings or category labels typical of a
classification pipeline. We show the generality of text weights in aiding audio
classification for datasets FSD-50K and GTZAN. Further, we show this working
for image classification on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST, as well on image
patches. This pushes the notion of text-LLMs learning powerful internal
circuits that can be utilized by activating necessary connections for various
applications rather than training models from scratch every single time.

Motivation: 解决LLM在临床笔记生成中因响应变异性带来的法律和伦理挑战，增强医疗提供者对LLM工具的信任。

Method: 评估12种开源和专有LLM在生成临床笔记时的一致性（字符串等价、语义一致性、语义相似性）。

Result: 所有LLM均表现稳定，语义一致；Meta的Llama 70B和Mistral的Small模型最可靠。

Conclusion: 推荐本地部署较小开源模型，以确保数据隐私合规并提升临床文档效率。

Abstract: Due to the legal and ethical responsibilities of healthcare providers (HCPs)
for accurate documentation and protection of patient data privacy, the natural
variability in the responses of large language models (LLMs) presents
challenges for incorporating clinical note generation (CNG) systems, driven by
LLMs, into real-world clinical processes. The complexity is further amplified
by the detailed nature of texts in CNG. To enhance the confidence of HCPs in
tools powered by LLMs, this study evaluates the reliability of 12 open-weight
and proprietary LLMs from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and OpenAI in CNG in terms
of their ability to generate notes that are string equivalent (consistency
rate), have the same meaning (semantic consistency) and are correct (semantic
similarity), across several iterations using the same prompt. The results show
that (1) LLMs from all model families are stable, such that their responses are
semantically consistent despite being written in various ways, and (2) most of
the LLMs generated notes close to the corresponding notes made by experts.
Overall, Meta's Llama 70B was the most reliable, followed by Mistral's Small
model. With these findings, we recommend the local deployment of these
relatively smaller open-weight models for CNG to ensure compliance with data
privacy regulations, as well as to improve the efficiency of HCPs in clinical
documentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态ICL的效果高度依赖输入上下文序列的质量，但目前对LVLM如何利用这些序列的理解有限，因此需要一种方法来解释和改进这一机制。

Method: 通过任务映射视角系统分析多模态ICL，提出TACO模型，利用任务感知注意力动态配置上下文序列，并在自回归解码过程中注入任务映射信号。

Result: 在五种LVLM和九个数据集上的实验表明，TACO在多种ICL任务中均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 任务映射为解释和改进多模态ICL提供了有价值的视角，TACO模型展示了其有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a key mechanism for
harnessing the capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However,
its effectiveness remains highly sensitive to the quality of input in-context
sequences, particularly for tasks involving complex reasoning or open-ended
generation. A major limitation is our limited understanding of how LVLMs
actually exploit these sequences during inference. To bridge this gap, we
systematically interpret multimodal ICL through the lens of task mapping, which
reveals how local and global relationships within and among demonstrations
guide model reasoning. Building on this insight, we present TACO, a lightweight
transformer-based model equipped with task-aware attention that dynamically
configures in-context sequences. By injecting task-mapping signals into the
autoregressive decoding process, TACO creates a bidirectional synergy between
sequence construction and task reasoning. Experiments on five LVLMs and nine
datasets demonstrate that TACO consistently surpasses baselines across diverse
ICL tasks. These results position task mapping as a valuable perspective for
interpreting and improving multimodal ICL.

Result: 在ZuCo数据集上，GLIM生成流畅且基于EEG的句子，支持EEG-文本检索和零样本语义分类。

Conclusion: GLIM为生成脑解码提供了可靠且可扩展的基准测试基础。

Abstract: Pretrained generative models have opened new frontiers in brain decoding by
enabling the synthesis of realistic texts and images from non-invasive brain
recordings. However, the reliability of such outputs remains
questionable--whether they truly reflect semantic activation in the brain, or
are merely hallucinated by the powerful generative models. In this paper, we
focus on EEG-to-text decoding and address its hallucination issue through the
lens of posterior collapse. Acknowledging the underlying mismatch in
information capacity between EEG and text, we reframe the decoding task as
semantic summarization of core meanings rather than previously verbatim
reconstruction of stimulus texts. To this end, we propose the Generative
Language Inspection Model (GLIM), which emphasizes learning informative and
interpretable EEG representations to improve semantic grounding under
heterogeneous and small-scale data conditions. Experiments on the public ZuCo
dataset demonstrate that GLIM consistently generates fluent, EEG-grounded
sentences without teacher forcing. Moreover, it supports more robust evaluation
beyond text similarity, through EEG-text retrieval and zero-shot semantic
classification across sentiment categories, relation types, and corpus topics.
Together, our architecture and evaluation protocols lay the foundation for
reliable and scalable benchmarking in generative brain decoding.

Motivation: 现有方法无法有效解决LLM评估中的根深蒂固偏见，尤其是封闭源模型。RBD旨在通过外部模块实现偏见检测和自我修正。

Method: RBD是一个插件模块，通过构建偏见数据集、监督收集、蒸馏推理微调和与LLM评估器集成，实现偏见检测和反馈驱动的修正。

Conclusion: RBD在偏见检测和修正方面表现出高效性和可扩展性，并能泛化到多种偏见类型和领域。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a promising tool for automatically evaluating
generated outputs, but its reliability is often undermined by potential biases
in judgment. Existing efforts to mitigate these biases face key limitations:
in-context learning-based methods fail to address rooted biases due to the
evaluator's limited capacity for self-reflection, whereas fine-tuning is not
applicable to all evaluator types, especially closed-source models. To address
this challenge, we introduce the Reasoning-based Bias Detector (RBD), which is
a plug-in module that identifies biased evaluations and generates structured
reasoning to guide evaluator self-correction. Rather than modifying the
evaluator itself, RBD operates externally and engages in an iterative process
of bias detection and feedback-driven revision. To support its development, we
design a complete pipeline consisting of biased dataset construction,
supervision collection, distilled reasoning-based fine-tuning of RBD, and
integration with LLM evaluators. We fine-tune four sizes of RBD models, ranging
from 1.5B to 14B, and observe consistent performance improvements across all
scales. Experimental results on 4 bias types--verbosity, position, bandwagon,
and sentiment--evaluated using 8 LLM evaluators demonstrate RBD's strong
effectiveness. For example, the RBD-8B model improves evaluation accuracy by an
average of 18.5% and consistency by 10.9%, and surpasses prompting-based
baselines and fine-tuned judges by 12.8% and 17.2%, respectively. These results
highlight RBD's effectiveness and scalability. Additional experiments further
demonstrate its strong generalization across biases and domains, as well as its
efficiency.

Result: 发现LLM中存在语义层，更大模型提取更多通用信息；语义信息分布在多个token中，具有长距离相关性和因果不对称性。视觉变换器中也有类似语义层，且LLM语义层表示能预测图像表示。

Conclusion: 深度神经网络在语义相关数据中生成相似表示的现象可通过量化方法研究，且模型规模和结构对信息提取有显著影响。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for
semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as
an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We
present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring
the relative information content of the representations of semantically related
data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language
models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs
of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the
most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers,
a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than
a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information is spread across many tokens
and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a
causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers
encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption
representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations
of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent
information asymmetries between image and text representations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
natural language processing tasks. However, most LLM models use traditional
tokenizers like BPE and SentencePiece, which fail to capture the finer nuances
of a morphologically rich language like Bangla (Bengali). In this work, we
introduce BanglaByT5, the first byte-level encoder-decoder model explicitly
tailored for Bangla. Built upon a small variant of Googles ByT5 architecture,
BanglaByT5 is pre-trained on a 14GB curated corpus combining high-quality
literary and newspaper articles. Through zeroshot and supervised evaluations
across generative and classification tasks, BanglaByT5 demonstrates competitive
performance, surpassing several multilingual and larger models. Our findings
highlight the efficacy of byte-level modelling for morphologically rich
languages and highlight BanglaByT5 potential as a lightweight yet powerful tool
for Bangla NLP, particularly in both resource-constrained and scalable
environments.

Motivation: 解决现有生成模型在多元时间序列生成中的局限性，提供更高效和灵活的解决方案。

Result: 在多种数据集上，SDForger在相似性评估和下游预测任务中优于现有生成模型。

Conclusion: SDForger通过文本条件生成，为多模态建模和时间序列与文本信息的集成铺平了道路，并将开源。

Abstract: SDForger is a flexible and efficient framework for generating high-quality
multivariate time series using LLMs. Leveraging a compact data representation,
SDForger provides synthetic time series generation from a few samples and
low-computation fine-tuning of any autoregressive LLM. Specifically, the
framework transforms univariate and multivariate signals into tabular
embeddings, which are then encoded into text and used to fine-tune the LLM. At
inference, new textual embeddings are sampled and decoded into synthetic time
series that retain the original data's statistical properties and temporal
dynamics. Across a diverse range of datasets, SDForger outperforms existing
generative models in many scenarios, both in similarity-based evaluations and
downstream forecasting tasks. By enabling textual conditioning in the
generation process, SDForger paves the way for multimodal modeling and the
streamlined integration of time series with textual information. SDForger

TL;DR: P2P是一个基于LLM的多智能体框架，用于从研究论文自动生成高质量学术海报，并发布了首个大规模指令数据集P2PInstruct和评估基准P2PEval。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学术海报手动制作耗时，现有自动化方法难以保留科学细节和实现视觉-文本整合，缺乏标准化评估基准。

Method: P2P采用三个专用智能体（视觉元素处理、内容生成、海报组装）和检查模块，支持迭代优化。

Result: 生成了高质量HTML渲染的海报，并构建了包含30,000+示例的数据集和121对论文-海报的评估基准。

Conclusion: P2P框架和配套工具为学术海报生成领域提供了高效解决方案和评估标准。

Abstract: Academic posters are vital for scholarly communication, yet their manual
creation is time-consuming. However, automated academic poster generation faces
significant challenges in preserving intricate scientific details and achieving
effective visual-textual integration. Existing approaches often struggle with
semantic richness and structural nuances, and lack standardized benchmarks for
evaluating generated academic posters comprehensively. To address these
limitations, we introduce P2P, the first flexible, LLM-based multi-agent
framework that generates high-quality, HTML-rendered academic posters directly
from research papers, demonstrating strong potential for practical
applications. P2P employs three specialized agents-for visual element
processing, content generation, and final poster assembly-each integrated with
dedicated checker modules to enable iterative refinement and ensure output
quality. To foster advancements and rigorous evaluation in this domain, we
construct and release P2PInstruct, the first large-scale instruction dataset
comprising over 30,000 high-quality examples tailored for the academic
paper-to-poster generation task. Furthermore, we establish P2PEval, a
comprehensive benchmark featuring 121 paper-poster pairs and a dual evaluation
methodology (Universal and Fine-Grained) that leverages LLM-as-a-Judge and
detailed, human-annotated checklists. Our contributions aim to streamline
research dissemination and provide the community with robust tools for
developing and evaluating next-generation poster generation systems.

*Yifei Liu,Yu Cui,Haibin Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出RRTL方法，评估推理大语言模型（RLLMs）在工具学习中的安全性，发现RLLMs虽比传统LLMs更安全，但仍存在欺骗性风险和多语言漏洞。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨新兴推理大语言模型（RLLMs）在工具学习中的安全性问题，填补研究空白。

Method: 提出RRTL方法，结合欺骗性威胁识别和Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示，评估RLLMs的安全性。

Result: 发现RLLMs安全性优于传统LLMs，但存在欺骗性风险和多语言漏洞。

Conclusion: RRTL为提升RLLMs在工具学习中的安全性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: While tool learning significantly enhances the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs), it also introduces substantial security risks. Prior research
has revealed various vulnerabilities in traditional LLMs during tool learning.
However, the safety of newly emerging reasoning LLMs (RLLMs), such as
DeepSeek-R1, in the context of tool learning remains underexplored. To bridge
this gap, we propose RRTL, a red teaming approach specifically designed to
evaluate RLLMs in tool learning. It integrates two novel strategies: (1) the
identification of deceptive threats, which evaluates the model's behavior in
concealing the usage of unsafe tools and their potential risks; and (2) the use
of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to force tool invocation. Our approach also
includes a benchmark for traditional LLMs. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation on seven mainstream RLLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) RLLMs
generally achieve stronger safety performance than traditional LLMs, yet
substantial safety disparities persist across models; (2) RLLMs can pose
serious deceptive risks by frequently failing to disclose tool usage and to
warn users of potential tool output risks; (3) CoT prompting reveals
multi-lingual safety vulnerabilities in RLLMs. Our work provides important
insights into enhancing the security of RLLMs in tool learning.

TL;DR: MMER是一种无需训练的方法，通过复用现有MLLM的多模态编码器和合并LLM参数，实现多模态扩展并保留原始性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖资源密集型且不灵活的从头微调，MMER旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 复用MLLM的多模态编码器，合并LLM参数并生成二进制掩码以分离模态参数。

Result: 实验显示MMER显著提升多模态能力，保留99%原始性能，并减轻灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: MMER为多模态扩展提供了一种高效且灵活的方法。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal encoders on
modality-specific data expands the modalities that LLMs can handle, leading to
the formation of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). However, this paradigm heavily relies
on resource-intensive and inflexible fine-tuning from scratch with new
multimodal data. In this paper, we propose MMER (Multi-modality Expansion and
Retention), a training-free approach that integrates existing MLLMs for
effective multimodal expansion while retaining their original performance.
Specifically, MMER reuses MLLMs' multimodal encoders while merging their LLM
parameters. By comparing original and merged LLM parameters, MMER generates
binary masks to approximately separate LLM parameters for each modality. These
decoupled parameters can independently process modality-specific inputs,
reducing parameter conflicts and preserving original MLLMs' fidelity. MMER can
also mitigate catastrophic forgetting by applying a similar process to MLLMs
fine-tuned on new tasks. Extensive experiments show significant improvements
over baselines, proving that MMER effectively expands LLMs' multimodal
capabilities while retaining 99% of the original performance, and also markedly
mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

TL;DR: 研究分析了Gemini、ChatGPT和DeepSeek在Schwartz价值观框架中的文化价值对齐，发现DeepSeek因中文数据训练而更弱化自我增强价值观，与集体主义文化一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型（LLMs）是否反映文化偏见，而非普遍伦理框架。

Method: 使用40项肖像价值观问卷，通过贝叶斯序数回归模型分析模型的价值偏好。

Result: 所有模型均优先自我超越价值观，但DeepSeek弱化自我增强价值观，与集体主义文化一致。

Conclusion: LLMs存在文化偏见，需多视角推理和动态情境化以实现公平和多元对齐。

Abstract: This study examines cultural value alignment in large language models (LLMs)
by analyzing how Gemini, ChatGPT, and DeepSeek prioritize values from
Schwartz's value framework. Using the 40-item Portrait Values Questionnaire, we
assessed whether DeepSeek, trained on Chinese-language data, exhibits distinct
value preferences compared to Western models. Results of a Bayesian ordinal
regression model show that self-transcendence values (e.g., benevolence,
universalism) were highly prioritized across all models, reflecting a general
LLM tendency to emphasize prosocial values. However, DeepSeek uniquely
downplayed self-enhancement values (e.g., power, achievement) compared to
ChatGPT and Gemini, aligning with collectivist cultural tendencies. These
findings suggest that LLMs reflect culturally situated biases rather than a
universal ethical framework. To address value asymmetries in LLMs, we propose
multi-perspective reasoning, self-reflective feedback, and dynamic
contextualization. This study contributes to discussions on AI fairness,
cultural neutrality, and the need for pluralistic AI alignment frameworks that
integrate diverse moral perspectives.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RAVEN是一种多模态问答架构，通过QuART模块动态评估各模态信息的相关性，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态问答中模态不一致问题（如无关音频或视频干扰），提升模型对多模态信息的融合能力。

Method: 采用三阶段训练流程：单模态预训练、查询对齐融合和模态不匹配微调，核心是QuART模块动态评分各模态信息。

Result: 在七个多模态QA基准测试中，RAVEN性能提升显著（最高14.5%），传感器数据进一步带来16.4%增益，且对模态损坏具有强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RAVEN通过动态模态选择和鲁棒训练策略，显著提升多模态问答性能，并为社区提供新数据集AVS-QA。

Abstract: Multimodal question answering (QA) often requires identifying which video,
audio, or sensor tokens are relevant to the question. Yet modality
disagreements are common: off-camera speech, background noise, or motion
outside the field of view often mislead fusion models that weight all streams
equally. We present RAVEN, a unified QA architecture whose core is QuART, a
query-conditioned cross-modal gating module that assigns scalar relevance
scores to each token across modalities, enabling the model to amplify
informative signals and suppress distractors before fusion. RAVEN is trained
through a three-stage pipeline comprising unimodal pretraining, query-aligned
fusion, and disagreement-oriented fine-tuning -- each stage targeting a
distinct challenge in multi-modal reasoning: representation quality,
cross-modal relevance, and robustness to modality mismatch. To support training
and evaluation, we release AVS-QA, a dataset of 300K synchronized
Audio--Video-Sensor streams paired with automatically generated question-answer
pairs. Experimental results on seven multi-modal QA benchmarks -- including
egocentric and exocentric tasks -- show that RAVEN achieves up to 14.5\% and
8.0\% gains in accuracy compared to state-of-the-art multi-modal large language
models, respectively. Incorporating sensor data provides an additional 16.4\%
boost, and the model remains robust under modality corruption, outperforming
SOTA baselines by 50.23\%. Our code and dataset are available at
https://github.com/BASHLab/RAVEN.

Main category: cs.CL

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨LLM是否能在语义压缩中实现类似人类的平衡，即保持表达准确性与简洁性的权衡。

Method: 采用基于率失真理论和信息瓶颈原则的信息论框架，分析LLM的词嵌入与人类分类基准的差异。

Result: LLM能形成与人类判断一致的概念类别，但难以捕捉细微语义区分；人类更注重上下文丰富性，而LLM偏向统计压缩。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM与人类认知架构的关键差异，为开发更符合人类概念的LLM提供了方向。

Abstract: Humans organize knowledge into compact categories through semantic
compression by mapping diverse instances to abstract representations while
preserving meaning (e.g., robin and blue jay are both birds; most birds can
fly). These concepts reflect a trade-off between expressive fidelity and
representational simplicity. Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate
remarkable linguistic abilities, yet whether their internal representations
strike a human-like trade-off between compression and semantic fidelity is
unclear. We introduce a novel information-theoretic framework, drawing from
Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle, to
quantitatively compare these strategies. Analyzing token embeddings from a
diverse suite of LLMs against seminal human categorization benchmarks, we
uncover key divergences. While LLMs form broad conceptual categories that align
with human judgment, they struggle to capture the fine-grained semantic
distinctions crucial for human understanding. More fundamentally, LLMs
demonstrate a strong bias towards aggressive statistical compression, whereas
human conceptual systems appear to prioritize adaptive nuance and contextual
richness, even if this results in lower compressional efficiency by our
measures. These findings illuminate critical differences between current AI and
human cognitive architectures, guiding pathways toward LLMs with more
human-aligned conceptual representations.

Motivation: 解决RAG系统中内部与外部知识冲突或不可靠时的平衡问题。

Method: 构建TRD数据集，提出BRIDGE框架，采用软偏置权重和最大软偏置决策树动态选择响应策略。

Result: BRIDGE在实验中比基线方法准确率提升5-15%，且在所有场景中表现均衡。

Conclusion: BRIDGE为RAG应用中的可信响应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face critical challenges in
balancing internal (parametric) and external (retrieved) knowledge, especially
when these sources conflict or are unreliable. To analyze these scenarios
comprehensively, we construct the Trustworthiness Response Dataset (TRD) with
36,266 questions spanning four RAG settings. We reveal that existing approaches
address isolated scenarios-prioritizing one knowledge source, naively merging
both, or refusing answers-but lack a unified framework to handle different
real-world conditions simultaneously. Therefore, we propose the BRIDGE
framework, which dynamically determines a comprehensive response strategy of
large language models (LLMs). BRIDGE leverages an adaptive weighting mechanism
named soft bias to guide knowledge collection, followed by a Maximum Soft-bias
Decision Tree to evaluate knowledge and select optimal response strategies
(trust internal/external knowledge, or refuse). Experiments show BRIDGE
outperforms baselines by 5-15% in accuracy while maintaining balanced
performance across all scenarios. Our work provides an effective solution for
LLMs' trustworthy responses in real-world RAG applications.

Result: LLM在分析显性抑郁语言时表现更优，DPO方法显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 通过系统评估和优化策略，LLM在心理健康检测中的性能得到提升，尤其是DPO方法效果显著。

Abstract: Recent research leverages large language models (LLMs) for early mental
health detection, such as depression, often optimized with machine-generated
data. However, their detection may be subject to unknown weaknesses. Meanwhile,
quality control has not been applied to these generated corpora besides limited
human verifications. Our goal is to systematically evaluate LLM reasoning and
reveal potential weaknesses. To this end, we first provide a systematic
evaluation of the reasoning over machine-generated detection and
interpretation. Then we use the models' reasoning abilities to explore
mitigation strategies for enhanced performance. Specifically, we do the
following: A. Design an LLM instruction strategy that allows for systematic
analysis of the detection by breaking down the task into several subtasks. B.
Design contrastive few-shot and chain-of-thought prompts by selecting typical
positive and negative examples of detection reasoning. C. Perform human
annotation for the subtasks identified in the first step and evaluate the
performance. D. Identify human-preferred detection with desired logical
reasoning from the few-shot generation and use them to explore different
optimization strategies. We conducted extensive comparisons on the DepTweet
dataset across the following subtasks: 1. identifying whether the speaker is
describing their own depression; 2. accurately detecting the presence of PHQ-9
symptoms, and 3. finally, detecting depression. Human verification of
statistical outliers shows that LLMs demonstrate greater accuracy in analyzing
and detecting explicit language of depression as opposed to implicit
expressions of depression. Two optimization methods are used for performance
enhancement and reduction of the statistic bias: supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and direct preference optimization (DPO). Notably, the DPO approach achieves
significant performance improvement.

Motivation: 理解LLMs的内部工作机制是困难的，但通过开发其自我解释能力，可以提升模型的可解释性、控制性和安全性。

Method: 微调GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini，使其在复杂决策任务中学习并报告定量偏好，进一步训练模型以提高解释准确性。

Result: LLMs能准确报告决策中的偏好权重，通过训练可提升解释能力，且这种能力能泛化到其他复杂决策任务。

Conclusion: 研究表明LLMs具备自我解释潜力，为提升模型透明度和安全性提供了新方向。

Abstract: We have only limited understanding of how and why large language models
(LLMs) respond in the ways that they do. Their neural networks have proven
challenging to interpret, and we are only beginning to tease out the function
of individual neurons and circuits within them. However, another path to
understanding these systems is to investigate and develop their capacity to
introspect and explain their own functioning. Here, we show that i)
contemporary LLMs are capable of providing accurate, quantitative descriptions
of their own internal processes during certain kinds of decision-making, ii)
that it is possible to improve these capabilities through training, and iii)
that this training generalizes to at least some degree. To do so, we fine-tuned
GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini to make decisions in a wide variety of complex contexts
(e.g., choosing between condos, loans, vacations, etc.) according to
randomly-generated, quantitative preferences about how to weigh different
attributes during decision-making (e.g., the relative importance of natural
light versus quiet surroundings for condos). We demonstrate that the LLMs can
accurately report these preferences (i.e., the weights that they learned to
give to different attributes during decision-making). Next, we demonstrate that
these LLMs can be fine-tuned to explain their decision-making even more
accurately. Finally, we demonstrate that this training generalizes: It improves
the ability of the models to accurately explain what they are doing as they
make other complex decisions, not just decisions they have learned to make via
fine-tuning. This work is a step towards training LLMs to accurately and
broadly report on their own internal processes -- a possibility that would
yield substantial benefits for interpretability, control, and safety.

Result: 构建了100k样本的数据集，实验表明模型性能显著提升，如MathVision上+15.8%。

Conclusion: NeSyGeo框架有效提升了MLLMs的几何推理能力，小样本下也能显著改进模型性能。

Abstract: Obtaining large-scale, high-quality data with reasoning paths is crucial for
improving the geometric reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). However, existing data generation methods, whether based on
predefined templates or constrained symbolic provers, inevitably face diversity
and numerical generalization limitations. To address these limitations, we
propose NeSyGeo, a novel neuro-symbolic framework for generating geometric
reasoning data. First, we propose a domain-specific language grounded in the
entity-relation-constraint paradigm to comprehensively represent all components
of plane geometry, along with generative actions defined within this symbolic
space. We then design a symbolic-visual-text pipeline that synthesizes symbolic
sequences, maps them to corresponding visual and textual representations, and
generates diverse question-answer (Q&A) pairs using large language models
(LLMs). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a
neuro-symbolic approach in generating multimodal reasoning data. Based on this
framework, we construct NeSyGeo-CoT and NeSyGeo-Caption datasets, containing
100k samples, and release a new benchmark NeSyGeo-Test for evaluating geometric
reasoning abilities in MLLMs. Experiments demonstrate that the proposal
significantly and consistently improves the performance of multiple MLLMs under
both reinforcement and supervised fine-tuning. With only 4k samples and two
epochs of reinforcement fine-tuning, base models achieve improvements of up to
+15.8% on MathVision, +8.4% on MathVerse, and +7.3% on GeoQA. Notably, a 4B
model can be improved to outperform an 8B model from the same series on
geometric reasoning tasks.

Result: 截断数据集训练的模型性能优于完整数据集，解码策略进一步提升了效果。

Conclusion: 浅层偏好信号现象揭示了现有对齐方法的局限性，需更全面的响应对齐。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences remains a key
challenge in AI. Preference-based optimization methods, such as Reinforcement
Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
rely on human-annotated datasets to improve alignment. In this work, we
identify a crucial property of the existing learning method: the distinguishing
signal obtained in preferred responses is often concentrated in the early
tokens. We refer to this as shallow preference signals.
  To explore this property, we systematically truncate preference datasets at
various points and train both reward models and DPO models on the truncated
data. Surprisingly, models trained on truncated datasets, retaining only the
first half or fewer tokens, achieve comparable or even superior performance to
those trained on full datasets. For example, a reward model trained on the
Skywork-Reward-Preference-80K-v0.2 dataset outperforms the full dataset when
trained on a 40\% truncated dataset. This pattern is consistent across multiple
datasets, suggesting the widespread presence of shallow preference signals.
  We further investigate the distribution of the reward signal through decoding
strategies. We consider two simple decoding strategies motivated by the shallow
reward signal observation, namely Length Control Decoding and KL Threshold
Control Decoding, which leverage shallow preference signals to optimize the
trade-off between alignment and computational efficiency. The performance is
even better, which again validates our hypothesis.
  The phenomenon of shallow preference signals highlights potential issues in
LLM alignment: existing alignment methods often focus on aligning only the
initial tokens of responses, rather than considering the full response. This
could lead to discrepancies with real-world human preferences, resulting in
suboptimal alignment performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising results
in complex reasoning tasks. However, current evaluations predominantly focus on
single-turn reasoning scenarios, leaving interactive tasks largely unexplored.
We attribute it to the absence of comprehensive datasets and scalable automatic
evaluation protocols. To fill these gaps, we present MTR-Bench for LLMs'
Multi-Turn Reasoning evaluation. Comprising 4 classes, 40 tasks, and 3600
instances, MTR-Bench covers diverse reasoning capabilities, fine-grained
difficulty granularity, and necessitates multi-turn interactions with the
environments. Moreover, MTR-Bench features fully-automated framework spanning
both dataset constructions and model evaluations, which enables scalable
assessment without human interventions. Extensive experiments reveal that even
the cutting-edge reasoning models fall short of multi-turn, interactive
reasoning tasks. And the further analysis upon these results brings valuable
insights for future research in interactive AI systems.

Motivation: 语言模型在重要决策中的应用日益广泛，但其输出正确性至关重要。现有方法仅评估孤立声明的事实性，不适用于推理任务，因此需要定义并保证连贯事实性。

Method: 提出“连贯事实性”概念，并基于共形预测方法，通过“可推导性图”表示推理步骤，对子图应用分拆共形预测。

Result: 在MATH和FELM数据集上验证，方法能生成正确且有序的声明，实现目标覆盖水平的连贯事实性，90%的事实性保留80%以上原始声明。

Conclusion: 该方法有效保证了推理任务中的连贯事实性，为语言模型在复杂任务中的应用提供了可靠性支持。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly being used in important decision pipelines,
so ensuring the correctness of their outputs is crucial. Recent work has
proposed evaluating the "factuality" of claims decomposed from a language model
generation and applying conformal prediction techniques to filter out those
claims that are not factual. This can be effective for tasks such as
information retrieval, where constituent claims may be evaluated in isolation
for factuality, but is not appropriate for reasoning tasks, as steps of a
logical argument can be evaluated for correctness only within the context of
the claims that precede them. To capture this, we define "coherent factuality"
and develop a conformal-prediction-based method to guarantee coherent
factuality for language model outputs. Our approach applies split conformal
prediction to subgraphs within a "deducibility" graph" that represents the
steps of a reasoning problem. We evaluate our method on mathematical reasoning
problems from the MATH and FELM datasets and find that our algorithm
consistently produces correct and substantiated orderings of claims, achieving
coherent factuality across target coverage levels. Moreover, we achieve 90%
factuality on our stricter definition while retaining 80% or more of the
original claims, highlighting the utility of our deducibility-graph-guided
approach.

Abstract: The growing deployment of large language models (LLMs) has amplified concerns
regarding their inherent biases, raising critical questions about their
fairness, safety, and societal impact. However, quantifying LLM bias remains a
fundamental challenge, complicated by the ambiguity of what "bias" entails.
This challenge grows as new models emerge rapidly and gain widespread use,
while introducing potential biases that have not been systematically assessed.
In this paper, we propose the Relative Bias framework, a method designed to
assess how an LLM's behavior deviates from other LLMs within a specified target
domain. We introduce two complementary methodologies: (1) Embedding
Transformation analysis, which captures relative bias patterns through sentence
representations over the embedding space, and (2) LLM-as-a-Judge, which employs
a language model to evaluate outputs comparatively. Applying our framework to
several case studies on bias and alignment scenarios following by statistical
tests for validation, we find strong alignment between the two scoring methods,
offering a systematic, scalable, and statistically grounded approach for
comparative bias analysis in LLMs.

*Chaochen Gao,Xing Wu,Zijia Lin,Debing Zhang,Songlin Hu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LongMagpie是一种自合成框架，自动生成大规模长上下文指令数据，无需人工标注，解决了现有方法的成本高和多样性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量的长上下文指令数据对长上下文大型语言模型（LLM）的对齐至关重要，但现有方法成本高且难以扩展。

Method: 利用对齐的长上下文LLM，通过文档和特殊标记生成上下文相关查询，自动收集文档-查询对和模型响应。

Result: 在HELMET、RULER和Longbench v2等任务上表现领先，同时保持短上下文任务的竞争力。

Conclusion: LongMagpie是一种简单、开放、多样且可扩展的长上下文指令数据合成方法。

Abstract: High-quality long-context instruction data is essential for aligning
long-context large language models (LLMs). Despite the public release of models
like Qwen and Llama, their long-context instruction data remains proprietary.
Human annotation is costly and challenging, while template-based synthesis
methods limit scale, diversity, and quality. We introduce LongMagpie, a
self-synthesis framework that automatically generates large-scale long-context
instruction data. Our key insight is that aligned long-context LLMs, when
presented with a document followed by special tokens preceding a user turn,
auto-regressively generate contextually relevant queries. By harvesting these
document-query pairs and the model's responses, LongMagpie produces
high-quality instructions without human effort. Experiments on HELMET, RULER,
and Longbench v2 demonstrate that LongMagpie achieves leading performance on
long-context tasks while maintaining competitive performance on short-context
tasks, establishing it as a simple and effective approach for open, diverse,
and scalable long-context instruction data synthesis.

Result: 实验表明，数值数据的特性和模型架构对各向同性有不同影响，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过各向同性分析，本文为LLMs在数值领域的应用提供了理论支持和性能保证。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that vector representations of contextual
embeddings learned by pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are effective in
various downstream tasks in numerical domains. Despite their significant
benefits, the tendency of LLMs to hallucinate in such domains can have severe
consequences in applications such as energy, nature, finance, healthcare,
retail and transportation, among others. To guarantee prediction reliability
and accuracy in numerical domains, it is necessary to open the black-box and
provide performance guarantees through explanation. However, there is little
theoretical understanding of when pre-trained language models help solve
numeric downstream tasks. This paper seeks to bridge this gap by understanding
when the next-word prediction capability of LLMs can be adapted to numerical
domains through a novel analysis based on the concept of isotropy in the
contextual embedding space. Specifically, we consider a log-linear model for
LLMs in which numeric data can be predicted from its context through a network
with softmax in the output layer of LLMs (i.e., language model head in
self-attention). We demonstrate that, in order to achieve state-of-the-art
performance in numerical domains, the hidden representations of the LLM
embeddings must possess a structure that accounts for the shift-invariance of
the softmax function. By formulating a gradient structure of self-attention in
pre-trained models, we show how the isotropic property of LLM embeddings in
contextual embedding space preserves the underlying structure of
representations, thereby resolving the shift-invariance problem and providing a
performance guarantee. Experiments show that different characteristics of
numeric data and model architecture could have different impacts on isotropy.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了AI基础模型在直接处理地理空间数据时的局限性，并提出通过WKT表示和空间关系推理提升LLMs的地理空间推理能力。实验表明，GPT-4在拓扑空间关系推理中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地理空间数据中的向量几何和复杂空间关系难以被现有AI基础模型有效表示和推理，需探索改进方法。

Method: 采用几何嵌入、提示工程和日常语言三种方法，评估GPT-3.5-turbo、GPT-4和DeepSeek-R1-14B在空间推理任务中的表现。

Result: GPT-4在拓扑空间关系推理中准确率最高（0.66），且能理解逆拓扑关系和生成几何体以提升检索效果。

Conclusion: 研究为开发具备地理空间推理能力的地理基础模型提供了重要参考，提示工程和几何嵌入是有效方法。

Abstract: Applying AI foundation models directly to geospatial datasets remains
challenging due to their limited ability to represent and reason with
geographical entities, specifically vector-based geometries and natural
language descriptions of complex spatial relations. To address these issues, we
investigate the extent to which a well-known-text (WKT) representation of
geometries and their spatial relations (e.g., topological predicates) are
preserved during spatial reasoning when the geospatial vector data are passed
to large language models (LLMs) including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, and
DeepSeek-R1-14B. Our workflow employs three distinct approaches to complete the
spatial reasoning tasks for comparison, i.e., geometry embedding-based, prompt
engineering-based, and everyday language-based evaluation. Our experiment
results demonstrate that both the embedding-based and prompt engineering-based
approaches to geospatial question-answering tasks with GPT models can achieve
an accuracy of over 0.6 on average for the identification of topological
spatial relations between two geometries. Among the evaluated models, GPT-4
with few-shot prompting achieved the highest performance with over 0.66
accuracy on topological spatial relation inference. Additionally, GPT-based
reasoner is capable of properly comprehending inverse topological spatial
relations and including an LLM-generated geometry can enhance the effectiveness
for geographic entity retrieval. GPT-4 also exhibits the ability to translate
certain vernacular descriptions about places into formal topological relations,
and adding the geometry-type or place-type context in prompts may improve
inference accuracy, but it varies by instance. The performance of these spatial
reasoning tasks offers valuable insights for the refinement of LLMs with
geographical knowledge towards the development of geo-foundation models capable
of geospatial reasoning.

Conclusion: 语音助手系统结合Cog-TiPRO框架可有效检测认知衰退，为早期干预提供新工具。

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive decline is crucial for enabling interventions
that can slow neurodegenerative disease progression. Traditional diagnostic
approaches rely on labor-intensive clinical assessments, which are impractical
for frequent monitoring. Our pilot study investigates voice assistant systems
(VAS) as non-invasive tools for detecting cognitive decline through
longitudinal analysis of speech patterns in voice commands. Over an 18-month
period, we collected voice commands from 35 older adults, with 15 participants
providing daily at-home VAS interactions. To address the challenges of
analyzing these short, unstructured and noisy commands, we propose Cog-TiPRO, a
framework that combines (1) LLM-driven iterative prompt refinement for
linguistic feature extraction, (2) HuBERT-based acoustic feature extraction,
and (3) transformer-based temporal modeling. Using iTransformer, our approach
achieves 73.80% accuracy and 72.67% F1-score in detecting MCI, outperforming
its baseline by 27.13%. Through our LLM approach, we identify linguistic
features that uniquely characterize everyday command usage patterns in
individuals experiencing cognitive decline.

Abstract: Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) drive interest in scientific
applications, necessitating specialized benchmarks such as Earth science.
Existing benchmarks either present a general science focus devoid of Earth
science specificity or cover isolated subdomains, lacking holistic evaluation.
Furthermore, current benchmarks typically neglect the assessment of LLMs'
capabilities in open-ended scientific exploration. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive and professional benchmark for the Earth sciences, designed to
evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in scientific exploration within this domain,
spanning from fundamental to advanced levels. Leveraging a corpus of 100,000
research papers, we first construct two Question Answering (QA) datasets:
Earth-Iron, which offers extensive question coverage for broad assessment, and
Earth-Silver, which features a higher level of difficulty to evaluate
professional depth. These datasets encompass five Earth spheres, 114
disciplines, and 11 task categories, assessing foundational knowledge crucial
for scientific exploration. Most notably, we introduce Earth-Gold with new
metrics, a dataset comprising open-ended multi-turn dialogues specifically
designed to evaluate the advanced capabilities of LLMs in scientific
exploration, including methodology induction, limitation analysis, and concept
proposal. Extensive experiments reveal limitations in 11 leading LLMs across
different domains and tasks, highlighting considerable room for improvement in
their scientific exploration capabilities. The benchmark is available on

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，理解密集型微调任务（如问答和填空）比映射导向任务（如翻译或文本转JSON）在知识保留率上表现更优，但所有模型在知识应用时均表现下降，表明语义整合有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）知识逐渐过时，需要高效方法更新模型，尤其是注入专有信息时。

Method: 通过比较不同微调任务（理解密集型与映射导向型）对知识保留率的影响，并分析模型架构和规模的影响。

Result: 理解密集型任务知识保留率（48%）显著高于映射导向任务（17%-20%），且大模型表现更优，但知识应用时性能下降明显。

Conclusion: 任务选择对LLM知识更新至关重要，有效知识注入不仅依赖数据暴露，还需微调时的深度认知参与。

Abstract: As the knowledge of large language models (LLMs) becomes outdated over time,
there is a growing need for efficient methods to update them, especially when
injecting proprietary information. Our study reveals that
comprehension-intensive fine-tuning tasks (e.g., question answering and blanks)
achieve substantially higher knowledge retention rates (48%) compared to
mapping-oriented tasks like translation (17%) or text-to-JSON conversion (20%),
despite exposure to identical factual content. We demonstrate that this pattern
persists across model architectures and follows scaling laws, with larger
models showing improved retention across all task types. However, all models
exhibit significant performance drops when applying injected knowledge in
broader contexts, suggesting limited semantic integration. These findings show
the importance of task selection in updating LLM knowledge, showing that
effective knowledge injection relies not just on data exposure but on the depth
of cognitive engagement during fine-tuning.

Method: 通过多阶段人类参与上下文生成方法创建MDIT-Dataset，并构建MDIT-Bench基准，包含317,638个问题，覆盖12类23子类和780主题。

Result: 实验在13个主流LMM上进行，结果显示这些模型对双隐毒性处理效果不佳，尤其在困难级别表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 现有LMM仍含有大量隐藏但可激活的毒性，需进一步改进。

Abstract: The widespread use of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) has raised concerns
about model toxicity. However, current research mainly focuses on explicit
toxicity, with less attention to some more implicit toxicity regarding
prejudice and discrimination. To address this limitation, we introduce a
subtler type of toxicity named dual-implicit toxicity and a novel toxicity
benchmark termed MDIT-Bench: Multimodal Dual-Implicit Toxicity Benchmark.
Specifically, we first create the MDIT-Dataset with dual-implicit toxicity
using the proposed Multi-stage Human-in-loop In-context Generation method.
Based on this dataset, we construct the MDIT-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating
the sensitivity of models to dual-implicit toxicity, with 317,638 questions
covering 12 categories, 23 subcategories, and 780 topics. MDIT-Bench includes
three difficulty levels, and we propose a metric to measure the toxicity gap
exhibited by the model across them. In the experiment, we conducted MDIT-Bench
on 13 prominent LMMs, and the results show that these LMMs cannot handle
dual-implicit toxicity effectively. The model's performance drops significantly
in hard level, revealing that these LMMs still contain a significant amount of
hidden but activatable toxicity. Data are available at

Conclusion: Bilevel-BO-SWA方法能有效提升语言模型微调效果，尤其是通过混合获取函数优化训练和验证目标。

Abstract: With the rise of different language model architecture, fine-tuning is
becoming even more important for down stream tasks Model gets messy, finding
proper hyperparameters for fine-tuning. Although BO has been tried for
hyperparameter tuning, most of the existing methods are oblivious to the fact
that BO relies on careful choices of acquisition functions, which are essential
components of BO that guide how much to explore versus exploit during the
optimization process; Different acquisition functions have different levels of
sensitivity towards training loss and validation performance; existing methods
often just apply an acquisition function no matter if the training and
validation performance are sensitive to the acquisition function or not. This
work introduces{Bilevel - BO - SWA}, a model fusion approach coupled with a
bilevel BO strategy to improve the fine - tunning of large language models. Our
work on mixture of acquisition functions like EI and UCB into nested opt loops,
where inner loop perform minimization of training loss while outer loops
optimized w.r.t. val metric. Experiments on GLUE tasks using RoBERTA - base
show that when using EI and UCB, there is an improvement in generalization, and
fine - tuning can be improved by up to 2.7%.

Motivation: 现有方法（如全参数微调或低秩LoRA）在长链推理数据上容易导致循环推理问题，模型会重复推理步骤直至达到长度限制。

Method: 提出Shift-FFN，在输入FFN前编辑当前token的表示，动态放大相邻token的表示差异。

Result: 实验表明，Shift-FFN结合LoRA在多种数学推理任务中准确率更高，循环推理率更低。

Conclusion: Shift-FFN有效缓解循环推理问题，为长链推理任务提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, models such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have demonstrated
remarkable performance on complex reasoning tasks through Long Chain-of-Thought
(Long-CoT) reasoning. Although distilling this capability into student models
significantly enhances their performance, this paper finds that fine-tuning
LLMs with full parameters or LoRA with a low rank on long CoT data often leads
to Cyclical Reasoning, where models repeatedly reiterate previous inference
steps until the maximum length limit. Further analysis reveals that smaller
differences in representations between adjacent tokens correlates with a higher
tendency toward Cyclical Reasoning. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes
Shift Feedforward Networks (Shift-FFN), a novel approach that edits the current
token's representation with the previous one before inputting it to FFN. This
architecture dynamically amplifies the representation differences between
adjacent tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning tasks
demonstrate that LoRA combined with Shift-FFN achieves higher accuracy and a
lower rate of Cyclical Reasoning across various data sizes compared to full
fine-tuning and standard LoRA. Our data and code are available at

Motivation: 传统定性方法生成客户画像耗时且难以扩展，LLMs为高效生成合成画像提供了可能。

Method: 开发了基于真实画像的RAG聊天机器人，利用Few-Shot和Chain-of-Thought（CoT）提示技术生成合成画像，并通过McNemar测试评估其质量。最终将合成画像和额外信息集成到聊天机器人知识库中。

Result: Few-Shot在生成完整性上优于CoT，而CoT在响应时间和令牌使用上更高效。知识库增强后，聊天机器人平均准确率从5.88提升至6.42（10分制），81.82%的参与者认为系统实用。

Conclusion: 合成客户画像结合RAG聊天机器人能有效提升业务决策支持能力，Few-Shot和CoT各有优势。

Abstract: The introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly
transformed Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications by enabling more
advanced analysis of customer personas. At Volvo Construction Equipment (VCE),
customer personas have traditionally been developed through qualitative
methods, which are time-consuming and lack scalability. The main objective of
this paper is to generate synthetic customer personas and integrate them into a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot to support decision-making in
business processes. To this end, we first focus on developing a persona-based
RAG chatbot integrated with verified personas. Next, synthetic personas are
generated using Few-Shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting techniques and
evaluated based on completeness, relevance, and consistency using McNemar's
test. In the final step, the chatbot's knowledge base is augmented with
synthetic personas and additional segment information to assess improvements in
response accuracy and practical utility. Key findings indicate that Few-Shot
prompting outperformed CoT in generating more complete personas, while CoT
demonstrated greater efficiency in terms of response time and token usage.
After augmenting the knowledge base, the average accuracy rating of the chatbot
increased from 5.88 to 6.42 on a 10-point scale, and 81.82% of participants
found the updated system useful in business contexts.

Abstract: This work presents LURK (Latent UnleaRned Knowledge), a novel framework that
probes for hidden retained knowledge in unlearned LLMs through adversarial
suffix prompting. LURK automatically generates adversarial prompt suffixes
designed to elicit residual knowledge about the Harry Potter domain, a commonly
used benchmark for unlearning. Our experiments reveal that even models deemed
successfully unlearned can leak idiosyncratic information under targeted
adversarial conditions, highlighting critical limitations of current unlearning
evaluation standards. By uncovering latent knowledge through indirect probing,
LURK offers a more rigorous and diagnostic tool for assessing the robustness of
unlearning algorithms. All code will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标（如NLG和LLM）在临床正确性和泛化性上不足，临床准确性指标易受类别不平衡影响。

Method: 通过分布感知和适应性设计，CRG Score评估参考报告中明确描述的临床相关异常，支持多种标签类型，并可结合LLM进行特征提取。

Result: CRG Score提供更公平、稳健的评估，并作为临床对齐的奖励函数。

Conclusion: CRG Score解决了现有指标的局限性，为长文本放射学报告生成提供了更可靠的评估工具。

Abstract: Evaluating long-context radiology report generation is challenging. NLG
metrics fail to capture clinical correctness, while LLM-based metrics often
lack generalizability. Clinical accuracy metrics are more relevant but are
sensitive to class imbalance, frequently favoring trivial predictions. We
propose the CRG Score, a distribution-aware and adaptable metric that evaluates
only clinically relevant abnormalities explicitly described in reference
reports. CRG supports both binary and structured labels (e.g., type, location)
and can be paired with any LLM for feature extraction. By balancing penalties
based on label distribution, it enables fairer, more robust evaluation and
serves as a clinically aligned reward function.

Motivation: 自回归预训练在大型语言模型中广泛应用，但其特征在下游感知任务中的表现存在较大差异，需要量化这种对齐程度。

Method: 引入Next Token Perception Score (NTPS)，通过线性设定衡量自回归与感知特征子空间的重叠，并在12个NLP数据集和8个预训练模型上验证其相关性。

Result: NTPS与线性探测准确性强相关，LoRA微调能显著提升NTPS，尤其是大模型。NTPS还能预测LoRA微调带来的额外准确性提升。

Conclusion: NTPS为评估LLM感知能力提供了理论工具，并可作为LoRA微调的轻量级预筛选指标。

Abstract: Autoregressive pretraining has become the de facto paradigm for learning
general-purpose representations in large language models (LLMs). However,
linear probe performance across downstream perception tasks shows substantial
variability, suggesting that features optimized for next-token prediction do
not consistently transfer well to downstream perception tasks. We demonstrate
that representations learned via autoregression capture features that may lie
outside the subspaces most informative for perception. To quantify the
(mis)alignment between autoregressive pretraining and downstream perception, we
introduce the Next Token Perception Score (NTPS)-a score derived under a linear
setting that measures the overlap between autoregressive and perception feature
subspaces. This metric can be easily computed in closed form from pretrained
representations and labeled data, and is proven to both upper- and lower-bound
the excess loss. Empirically, we show that NTPS correlates strongly with linear
probe accuracy across 12 diverse NLP datasets and eight pretrained models
ranging from 270M to 8B parameters, confirming its utility as a measure of
alignment. Furthermore, we show that NTPS increases following low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning, especially in large models, suggesting that LoRA
aligning representations to perception tasks enhances subspace overlap and thus
improves downstream performance. More importantly, we find that NTPS reliably
predicts the additional accuracy gains attained by LoRA finetuning thereby
providing a lightweight prescreening tool for LoRA adaptation. Our results
offer both theoretical insights and practical tools for analytically assessing
LLM perception skills.

*Kushal Chawla,Alfy Samuel,Anoop Kumar,Daben Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FB-RAG是一种新框架，通过结合反向查找和正向查找优化RAG系统，显著提升性能并减少延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统的性能受检索质量和上下文大小影响，大上下文可能包含无关信息，小上下文可能丢失关键信息，FB-RAG旨在解决这一矛盾。

Method: FB-RAG结合反向查找（与查询重叠）和正向查找（与候选答案重叠）来检索最相关的上下文块。

Result: 在9个数据集上的评估显示，FB-RAG优于RAG和长上下文基线，同时减少延迟。

Conclusion: FB-RAG有效解决了复杂查询的上下文管理问题，为未来研究提供了具体指导。

Abstract: The performance of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems relies
heavily on the retriever quality and the size of the retrieved context. A large
enough context ensures that the relevant information is present in the input
context for the LLM, but also incorporates irrelevant content that has been
shown to confuse the models. On the other hand, a smaller context reduces the
irrelevant information, but it often comes at the risk of losing important
information necessary to answer the input question. This duality is especially
challenging to manage for complex queries that contain little information to
retrieve the relevant chunks from the full context. To address this, we present
a novel framework, called FB-RAG, which enhances the RAG pipeline by relying on
a combination of backward lookup (overlap with the query) and forward lookup
(overlap with candidate reasons and answers) to retrieve specific context
chunks that are the most relevant for answering the input query. Our
evaluations on 9 datasets from two leading benchmarks show that FB-RAG
consistently outperforms RAG and Long Context baselines developed recently for
these benchmarks. We further show that FB-RAG can improve performance while
reducing latency. We perform qualitative analysis of the strengths and
shortcomings of our approach, providing specific insights to guide future work.

*Kangda Wei,Hasnat Md Abdullah,Ruihong Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种减少大型语言模型性别偏见的新框架，通过生成性别中立的故事-判断对并优化模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型常表现出性别偏见，导致对不同性别的不平等对待，需解决这一问题。

Method: 生成结构相同但性别不同的故事对，引导模型产生性别中立的道德判断，并用直接偏好优化（DPO）微调模型。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著减少性别偏见，同时保持或提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少性别偏见，代码与生成数据将公开。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often exhibit gender bias, resulting in unequal
treatment of male and female subjects across different contexts. To address
this issue, we propose a novel data generation framework that fosters
exploratory thinking in LLMs. Our approach prompts models to generate story
pairs featuring male and female protagonists in structurally identical, morally
ambiguous scenarios, then elicits and compares their moral judgments. When
inconsistencies arise, the model is guided to produce balanced, gender-neutral
judgments. These story-judgment pairs are used to fine-tune or optimize the
models via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that
our method significantly reduces gender bias while preserving or even enhancing
general model capabilities. We will release the code and generated data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLMs）处理主观标签验证和校正的方法，通过Label-in-a-Haystack框架（LiaHR）提高标签质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于人类标注在复杂主观任务中存在显著差异，需要区分合理主观性和错误，因此探索LLMs在标签验证中的应用。

Method: 提出In-Context Learning基线方法和Label-in-a-Haystack设置，利用LLMs预测标签并分析其输出差异，进一步提出LiaHR框架进行标签校正。

Result: 实验证明LiaHR能有效提高标签质量，增强信号噪声比，并通过人类评估和生态效度研究验证其有效性。

Conclusion: LiaHR框架为复杂主观任务的标签校正提供了实用工具，可集成到标注流程中提升数据质量。

Abstract: Modeling complex subjective tasks in Natural Language Processing, such as
recognizing emotion and morality, is considerably challenging due to
significant variation in human annotations. This variation often reflects
reasonable differences in semantic interpretations rather than mere noise,
necessitating methods to distinguish between legitimate subjectivity and error.
We address this challenge by exploring label verification in these contexts
using Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we propose a simple In-Context
Learning binary filtering baseline that estimates the reasonableness of a
document-label pair. We then introduce the Label-in-a-Haystack setting: the
query and its label(s) are included in the demonstrations shown to LLMs, which
are prompted to predict the label(s) again, while receiving task-specific
instructions (e.g., emotion recognition) rather than label copying. We show how
the failure to copy the label(s) to the output of the LLM are task-relevant and
informative. Building on this, we propose the Label-in-a-Haystack Rectification
(LiaHR) framework for subjective label correction: when the model outputs
diverge from the reference gold labels, we assign the generated labels to the
example instead of discarding it. This approach can be integrated into
annotation pipelines to enhance signal-to-noise ratios. Comprehensive analyses,
human evaluations, and ecological validity studies verify the utility of LiaHR
for label correction. Code is available at https://github.com/gchochla/LiaHR.

*Jipeng Zhang,Haolin Yang,Kehao Miao,Ruiyuan Zhang,Renjie Pi,Jiahui Gao,Xiaofang Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ExeSQL框架通过执行驱动的反馈学习，提升文本到SQL模型在多方言环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到SQL模型局限于SQLite，而实际应用需支持多方言SQL生成，但高质量方言数据稀缺且静态生成数据不可靠。

Method: ExeSQL采用迭代查询生成、基于执行的过滤和偏好训练，通过反馈学习适应新方言。

Result: ExeSQL在PostgreSQL、MySQL和Oracle上分别比GPT-4o平均提升15.2%、10.38%和4.49%。

Conclusion: ExeSQL通过执行驱动的学习有效解决了文本到SQL模型在多方言环境中的泛化问题。

Abstract: Recent text-to-SQL models have achieved strong performance, but their
effectiveness remains largely confined to SQLite due to dataset limitations.
However, real-world applications require SQL generation across multiple
dialects with varying syntax and specialized features, which remains a
challenge for current models. The main obstacle in building a dialect-aware
model lies in acquiring high-quality dialect-specific data. Data generated
purely through static prompting - without validating SQLs via execution - tends
to be noisy and unreliable. Moreover, the lack of real execution environments
in the training loop prevents models from grounding their predictions in
executable semantics, limiting generalization despite surface-level
improvements from data filtering. This work introduces ExeSQL, a text-to-SQL
framework with execution-driven, agentic bootstrapping. The method consists of
iterative query generation, execution-based filtering (e.g., rejection
sampling), and preference-based training, enabling the model to adapt to new
SQL dialects through verifiable, feedback-guided learning. Experiments show
that ExeSQL bridges the dialect gap in text-to-SQL, achieving average
improvements of 15.2%, 10.38%, and 4.49% over GPT-4o on PostgreSQL, MySQL, and
Oracle, respectively, across multiple datasets of varying difficulty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 协作对话能揭示学生的学习与批判性思维，但现有检索增强生成方法（RAG）在语义链接较弱时效果不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出LC-RAG方法，结合环境日志增强RAG的检索能力，应用于协作学习环境XYZ中的同伴代理Copa。

Result: LC-RAG在检索效果上优于仅基于对话的基线方法，并能提供更相关、个性化的指导。

Conclusion: LC-RAG通过环境日志的上下文增强，有效支持学生的批判性思维和决策能力，提升了协作学习的效果。

Abstract: Collaborative dialogue offers rich insights into students' learning and
critical thinking. This is essential for adapting pedagogical agents to
students' learning and problem-solving skills in STEM+C settings. While large
language models (LLMs) facilitate dynamic pedagogical interactions, potential
hallucinations can undermine confidence, trust, and instructional value.
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds LLM outputs in curated knowledge,
but its effectiveness depends on clear semantic links between user input and a
knowledge base, which are often weak in student dialogue. We propose
log-contextualized RAG (LC-RAG), which enhances RAG retrieval by incorporating
environment logs to contextualize collaborative discourse. Our findings show
that LC-RAG improves retrieval over a discourse-only baseline and allows our
collaborative peer agent, Copa, to deliver relevant, personalized guidance that
supports students' critical thinking and epistemic decision-making in a
collaborative computational modeling environment, XYZ.

TL;DR: 论文提出ReasoningShield，首个针对推理痕迹中潜在风险的安全检测模型，解决了现有QA对审核工具在推理痕迹中检测风险的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有审核工具主要针对QA对，无法有效检测推理痕迹中的隐藏风险，因此需要专门针对推理痕迹的安全检测模型。

Method: 提出ReasoningShield模型，基于合成的8,000多对QT数据集，涵盖十类风险和三个安全级别，采用人机协作标注流程。

Result: ReasoningShield在推理痕迹风险检测中表现优异，平均F1分数超过0.92，且在传统QA对检测中也具有竞争力。

Conclusion: ReasoningShield有效填补了推理痕迹安全检测的空白，数据集质量高，模型轻量且实用，资源已公开。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) are transforming the AI landscape with advanced
reasoning capabilities. While the generated reasoning traces enhance model
transparency, they can still contain unsafe content, even when the final answer
appears safe. Existing moderation tools, primarily designed for question-answer
(QA) pairs, are empirically ineffective at detecting hidden risks embedded in
reasoning traces. After identifying the key challenges, we formally define the
question-thought (QT) moderation task and propose ReasoningShield, the first
safety detection model tailored to identify potential risks in the reasoning
trace before reaching the final answer. To construct the model, we synthesize a
high-quality reasoning safety detection dataset comprising over 8,000
question-thought pairs spanning ten risk categories and three safety levels.
Our dataset construction process incorporates a comprehensive human-AI
collaborative annotation pipeline, which achieves over 93% annotation accuracy
while significantly reducing human costs. On a diverse set of in-distribution
and out-of-distribution benchmarks, ReasoningShield outperforms mainstream
content safety moderation models in identifying risks within reasoning traces,
with an average F1 score exceeding 0.92. Notably, despite being trained on our
QT dataset only, ReasoningShield also demonstrates competitive performance in
detecting unsafe question-answer pairs on traditional benchmarks, rivaling
baselines trained on 10 times larger datasets and base models, which strongly
validates the quality of our dataset. Furthermore, ReasoningShield is built
upon compact 1B/3B base models to facilitate lightweight deployment and
provides human-friendly risk analysis by default. To foster future research, we
publicly release all the resources.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂任务中表现优异，但推理过程常因冗余步骤导致计算浪费、可读性降低和幻觉问题。

Conclusion: 该方法能根据问题难度动态调整推理长度，且依赖更强的评判模型效果更佳，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Large language models excel at complex tasks by breaking down problems into
structured reasoning steps. However, reasoning traces often extend beyond
reaching a correct answer, causing wasted computation, reduced readability, and
hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a novel hyperparameter-free
conciseness score used as a reward signal within a reinforcement learning
framework to guide models toward generating correct and concise reasoning
traces. This score is evaluated by a large language model acting as a judge,
enabling dynamic, context-aware feedback beyond simple token length. Our method
achieves state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-offs on the MATH dataset,
reducing token usage by up to 31x on simple problems while improving accuracy
by 7%, and on the hardest problems, it outperforms full reasoning by +7.5%
accuracy with up to 3.6x fewer tokens. On TheoremQA, our method improves
accuracy by +2.2% using 12.5x fewer tokens. We also conduct ablation studies on
the judge model, reward composition, and problem difficulty, showing that our
method dynamically adapts reasoning length based on problem difficulty and
benefits significantly from stronger judges. The code, model weights, and
datasets are open-sourced at https://github.com/RazvanDu/ConciseRL.

Motivation: 探索如何优化语言模型参数中的知识存储，特别是在MLP中，以提升模型性能。

Method: 分析20个开源大语言模型，研究其MLP参数中知识存储方式与性能的关系，并通过实验验证。

Result: 发现参数知识存储更专业化，且这种分布显著提升知识利用效率。

Conclusion: 参数知识专业化分布对提升模型知识利用效率至关重要。

Abstract: Over time, a growing wave of large language models from various series has
been introduced to the community. Researchers are striving to maximize the
performance of language models with constrained parameter sizes. However, from
a microscopic perspective, there has been limited research on how to better
store knowledge in model parameters, particularly within MLPs, to enable more
effective utilization of this knowledge by the model. In this work, we analyze
twenty publicly available open-source large language models to investigate the
relationship between their strong performance and the way knowledge is stored
in their corresponding MLP parameters. Our findings reveal that as language
models become more advanced and demonstrate stronger knowledge capabilities,
their parameters exhibit increased specialization. Specifically, parameters in
the MLPs tend to be more focused on encoding similar types of knowledge. We
experimentally validate that this specialized distribution of knowledge
contributes to improving the efficiency of knowledge utilization in these
models. Furthermore, by conducting causal training experiments, we confirm that
this specialized knowledge distribution plays a critical role in improving the
model's efficiency in leveraging stored knowledge.

Motivation: 罕见病（如IEM）诊断困难，病例报告作为重要资源未被充分利用，LLMs可能提供可扩展的信息提取方案。

Method: 引入CaseReportBench数据集，评估多种模型和提示策略，包括类别特定提示和子标题过滤数据整合。

Result: Qwen2.5-7B表现优于GPT-4o，LLMs能提取临床相关细节，但在识别阴性结果方面有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在临床NLP中具有潜力，但仍需改进，为医疗AI应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Rare diseases, including Inborn Errors of Metabolism (IEM), pose significant
diagnostic challenges. Case reports serve as key but computationally
underutilized resources to inform diagnosis. Clinical dense information
extraction refers to organizing medical information into structured predefined
categories. Large Language Models (LLMs) may enable scalable information
extraction from case reports but are rarely evaluated for this task. We
introduce CaseReportBench, an expert-annotated dataset for dense information
extraction of case reports, focusing on IEMs. Using this dataset, we assess
various models and prompting strategies, introducing novel approaches such as
category-specific prompting and subheading-filtered data integration. Zero-shot
chain-of-thought prompting offers little advantage over standard zero-shot
prompting. Category-specific prompting improves alignment with the benchmark.
The open-source model Qwen2.5-7B outperforms GPT-4o for this task. Our
clinician evaluations show that LLMs can extract clinically relevant details
from case reports, supporting rare disease diagnosis and management. We also
highlight areas for improvement, such as LLMs' limitations in recognizing
negative findings important for differential diagnosis. This work advances
LLM-driven clinical natural language processing and paves the way for scalable
medical AI applications.

Method: 提出Select2Reason框架，结合问题难度量化和推理长度启发式方法，优先选择高效用指令。

Result: 在OpenR1-Math-220k数据集上，仅用10%数据微调即超越全数据微调和开源基线模型。

Conclusion: Select2Reason高效、可扩展且适应性强，为长链思维推理提供了一种低成本解决方案。

Abstract: A practical approach to activate long chain-of-thoughts reasoning ability in
pre-trained large language models is to perform supervised fine-tuning on
instruction datasets synthesized by strong Large Reasoning Models such as
DeepSeek-R1, offering a cost-effective alternative to reinforcement learning.
However, large-scale instruction sets with more than 100k samples incur
significant training overhead, while effective strategies for automatic
long-CoT instruction selection still remain unexplored. In this work, we
propose Select2Reason, a novel and efficient instruction-tuning data selection
framework for long-CoT reasoning. From the perspective of emergence of
rethinking behaviors like self-correction and backtracking, we investigate
common metrics that may determine the quality of long-CoT reasoning
instructions. Select2Reason leverages a quantifier to estimate difficulty of
question and jointly incorporates a reasoning trace length-based heuristic
through a weighted scheme for ranking to prioritize high-utility examples.
Empirical results on OpenR1-Math-220k demonstrate that fine-tuning LLM on only
10% of the data selected by Select2Reason achieves performance competitive with
or superior to full-data tuning and open-source baseline OpenR1-Qwen-7B across
three competition-level and six comprehensive mathematical benchmarks. Further
experiments highlight the scalability in varying data size, efficiency during
inference, and its adaptability to other instruction pools with minimal cost.

Abstract: We introduce GreekBarBench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs on legal

free-text evaluation, we propose a three-dimensional scoring system combined
with an LLM-as-a-judge approach. We also develop a meta-evaluation benchmark to
assess the correlation between LLM-judges and human expert evaluations,
revealing that simple, span-based rubrics improve their alignment. Our
systematic evaluation of 13 proprietary and open-weight LLMs shows that even
though the best models outperform average expert scores, they fall short of the

Motivation: 代理RAG系统在动态多步推理和信息检索中存在效率低下的问题，如过度搜索和不足搜索，影响了系统的可靠性和性能。

Method: 论文首先量化了这些低效行为，并发现其与模型对自身知识边界的不确定性相关。随后提出了β-GRPO方法，通过强化学习结合置信度阈值来优化搜索决策。

Result: 在七个QA基准测试中，β-GRPO方法使一个3B模型的表现优于其他基线，平均精确匹配分数提高了4%。

Conclusion: β-GRPO方法有效解决了代理RAG系统中的搜索效率问题，通过优化模型的搜索决策提升了性能。

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance Large Language
Models (LLMs) by enabling dynamic, multi-step reasoning and information
retrieval. However, these systems often exhibit sub-optimal search behaviors
like over-search (retrieving redundant information) and under-search (failing
to retrieve necessary information), which hinder efficiency and reliability.
This work formally defines and quantifies these behaviors, revealing their
prevalence across multiple QA datasets and agentic RAG systems (e.g., one model
could have avoided searching in 27.7% of its search steps). Furthermore, we
demonstrate a crucial link between these inefficiencies and the models'
uncertainty regarding their own knowledge boundaries, where response accuracy
correlates with model's uncertainty in its search decisions. To address this,
we propose $\beta$-GRPO, a reinforcement learning-based training method that
incorporates confidence threshold to reward high-certainty search decisions.
Experiments on seven QA benchmarks show that $\beta$-GRPO enable a 3B model
with better agentic RAG ability, outperforming other strong baselines with a 4%
higher average exact match score.

Result: 在LEval和LongBench任务中，SELF性能分别提升12%和6.4%，阅读理解任务提升5.4%。

Conclusion: SELF有效解决了长上下文处理问题，性能优于现有方法，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models suffer issues when operated on long contexts that are
larger than their training context length due to the standard position encoding
for tokens in the attention layer. Tokens a long distance apart will rarely
have an effect on each other and long prompts yield unexpected results. To
solve this problem, we propose SELF (Self-Extend the Context Length With
Logistic Growth Function): a solution of grouping consecutive tokens at varying
group sizes using a logistic capacity equation combined with a constant group
size at smaller relative distances. Our model had an increase in performance of
up to 12% compared to the LongLM extension method in LEval (specifically on the
Qwen model). On summarization related tasks in LongBench, our model performed
up to 6.4% better than LongLM (specifically on the Llama-2-7b model). On
reading comprehension tasks from LEval, our model performed up to 5.4% better
than the LongLM. Our code is available at https://github.com/alexeipc/SELF-LLM.

Motivation: 理解多语言环境下LLMs的拒绝行为，以提升安全防御能力。

Method: 使用PolyRefuse多语言安全数据集，分析14种语言的拒绝行为，并验证拒绝方向的跨语言通用性。

Result: 英语提取的拒绝方向可有效绕过其他语言的拒绝机制，且任何安全对齐语言的拒绝方向均可无缝迁移。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了跨语言拒绝行为的机制，为构建更健壮的多语言安全防御提供了依据。

Abstract: Refusal mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) are essential for ensuring
safety. Recent research has revealed that refusal behavior can be mediated by a
single direction in activation space, enabling targeted interventions to bypass
refusals. While this is primarily demonstrated in an English-centric context,
appropriate refusal behavior is important for any language, but poorly
understood. In this paper, we investigate the refusal behavior in LLMs across
14 languages using PolyRefuse, a multilingual safety dataset created by
translating malicious and benign English prompts into these languages. We
uncover the surprising cross-lingual universality of the refusal direction: a
vector extracted from English can bypass refusals in other languages with
near-perfect effectiveness, without any additional fine-tuning. Even more
remarkably, refusal directions derived from any safety-aligned language
transfer seamlessly to others. We attribute this transferability to the
parallelism of refusal vectors across languages in the embedding space and
identify the underlying mechanism behind cross-lingual jailbreaks. These
findings provide actionable insights for building more robust multilingual
safety defenses and pave the way for a deeper mechanistic understanding of
cross-lingual vulnerabilities in LLMs.

Result: SBV2JE在自然度上接近人类水平（MOS 4.37 vs. 4.38），WER更低，CMOS略优，但计算需求较高。

Conclusion: SBV2JE适用于语言学习和角色对话生成，尽管计算成本较高。

Abstract: Synthesizing expressive Japanese character speech poses unique challenges due

character-specific datasets, we evaluate models across naturalness (mean
opinion and comparative mean opinion score), intelligibility (word error rate),
and speaker consistency. SBV2JE matches human ground truth in naturalness (MOS
4.37 vs. 4.38), achieves lower WER, and shows slight preference in CMOS.
Enhanced by pitch-accent controls and a WavLM-based discriminator, SBV2JE
proves effective for applications like language learning and character dialogue
generation, despite higher computational demands.

Result: 发现层间压缩-扩展现象，早期层压缩任务信息，后期层扩展生成预测；模型规模和演示数量提升性能。

Conclusion: ICL的层间动态揭示了结构化表示的形成机制，为理解模型行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to
new tasks without weight updates by learning from demonstration sequences.
While ICL shows strong empirical performance, its internal representational
mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this work, we conduct a statistical
geometric analysis of ICL representations to investigate how task-specific
information is captured across layers. Our analysis reveals an intriguing
phenomenon, which we term *Layerwise Compression-Expansion*: early layers
progressively produce compact and discriminative representations that encode
task information from the input demonstrations, while later layers expand these
representations to incorporate the query and generate the prediction. This
phenomenon is observed consistently across diverse tasks and a range of
contemporary LLM architectures. We demonstrate that it has important
implications for ICL performance -- improving with model size and the number of
demonstrations -- and for robustness in the presence of noisy examples. To
further understand the effect of the compact task representation, we propose a
bias-variance decomposition and provide a theoretical analysis showing how
attention mechanisms contribute to reducing both variance and bias, thereby
enhancing performance as the number of demonstrations increases. Our findings
reveal an intriguing layerwise dynamic in ICL, highlight how structured
representations emerge within LLMs, and showcase that analyzing internal
representations can facilitate a deeper understanding of model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的普及对学术写作的诚信和机构信任构成威胁，研究旨在区分其用于生成关键文本还是编辑用途。

Method: 通过分析arXiv论文，使用PELT阈值和贝叶斯分类器对GPT重生成文本进行风格分割测量。

Result: LLM生成的语言无法预测风格分割，表明作者使用LLMs时方式一致，减少了幻觉风险。

Conclusion: LLMs在学术写作中的使用方式均匀，降低了引入幻觉的可能性。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in late 2022 has impacted
academic writing, threatening credibility, and causing institutional
uncertainty. We seek to determine the degree to which LLMs are used to generate
critical text as opposed to being used for editing, such as checking for
grammar errors or inappropriate phrasing. In our study, we analyze arXiv papers
for stylistic segmentation, which we measure by varying a PELT threshold
against a Bayesian classifier trained on GPT-regenerated text. We find that
LLM-attributed language is not predictive of stylistic segmentation, suggesting
that when authors use LLMs, they do so uniformly, reducing the risk of
hallucinations being introduced into academic preprints.

Abstract: Enterprise customers are increasingly adopting Large Language Models (LLMs)
for critical communication tasks, such as drafting emails, crafting sales
pitches, and composing casual messages. Deploying such models across different
regions requires them to understand diverse cultural and linguistic contexts
and generate safe and respectful responses. For enterprise applications, it is
crucial to mitigate reputational risks, maintain trust, and ensure compliance
by effectively identifying and handling unsafe or offensive language. To
address this, we introduce SweEval, a benchmark simulating real-world scenarios
with variations in tone (positive or negative) and context (formal or
informal). The prompts explicitly instruct the model to include specific swear
words while completing the task. This benchmark evaluates whether LLMs comply
with or resist such inappropriate instructions and assesses their alignment
with ethical frameworks, cultural nuances, and language comprehension
capabilities. In order to advance research in building ethically aligned AI
systems for enterprise use and beyond, we release the dataset and code:

Result: 研究发现，缺乏专家参与的数据会导致幻觉指标缺乏有效性和实用性。

Conclusion: 建议在语言模型评估中采用重复性、开放性和领域情境化的幻觉基准测试。

Abstract: Plausible, but inaccurate, tokens in model-generated text are widely believed
to be pervasive and problematic for the responsible adoption of language
models. Despite this concern, there is little scientific work that attempts to
measure the prevalence of language model hallucination in a comprehensive way.
In this paper, we argue that language models should be evaluated using
repeatable, open, and domain-contextualized hallucination benchmarking. We
present a taxonomy of hallucinations alongside a case study that demonstrates
that when experts are absent from the early stages of data creation, the
resulting hallucination metrics lack validity and practical utility.

Motivation: 验证LLM能否作为自动化心理咨询师，并评估其在戒烟干预中的效果和符合MI标准的程度。

Method: 开发了一个基于LLM和MI的聊天机器人，通过106名参与者测试其效果，并采用自动化评估工具验证其MI依从性和用户反应。

Result: 参与者戒烟信心平均提升1.7分（0-10分），聊天机器人的MI依从性达98%，高于人类咨询师。用户感知共情度较高，但略低于人类。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的自动化心理咨询在戒烟干预中具有潜力，但仍需进一步提升共情能力。

Abstract: The conversational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest that
they may be able to perform as automated talk therapists. It is crucial to know
if these systems would be effective and adhere to known standards. We present a
counsellor chatbot that focuses on motivating tobacco smokers to quit smoking.
It uses a state-of-the-art LLM and a widely applied therapeutic approach called
Motivational Interviewing (MI), and was evolved in collaboration with
clinician-scientists with expertise in MI. We also describe and validate an
automated assessment of both the chatbot's adherence to MI and client
responses. The chatbot was tested on 106 participants, and their confidence
that they could succeed in quitting smoking was measured before the
conversation and one week later. Participants' confidence increased by an
average of 1.7 on a 0-10 scale. The automated assessment of the chatbot showed
adherence to MI standards in 98% of utterances, higher than human counsellors.
The chatbot scored well on a participant-reported metric of perceived empathy
but lower than typical human counsellors. Furthermore, participants' language
indicated a good level of motivation to change, a key goal in MI. These results
suggest that the automation of talk therapy with a modern LLM has promise.

Method: 通过人类-AI协作分析治疗师和GPT-4的MI会话，开发预测模型，结合深度学习和可解释AI，识别17种MI一致（MICO）和不一致（MIIN）行为指标。

Result: 定制化的思维链提示改进了GPT-4的MI表现，减少了不恰当建议，增强了反思和共情能力。GPT-4在建议管理上优于治疗师，但在复杂情感处理上仍有局限。

Conclusion: 该框架为优化基于LLM的治疗工具提供了途径，但LLM在临床沟通应用中仍存在可扩展性潜力与当前限制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 show potential for scaling
motivational interviewing (MI) in addiction care, but require systematic
evaluation of therapeutic capabilities. We present a computational framework
assessing user-perceived quality (UPQ) through expected and unexpected MI
behaviors. Analyzing human therapist and GPT-4 MI sessions via human-AI
collaboration, we developed predictive models integrating deep learning and
explainable AI to identify 17 MI-consistent (MICO) and MI-inconsistent (MIIN)
behavioral metrics. A customized chain-of-thought prompt improved GPT-4's MI
performance, reducing inappropriate advice while enhancing reflections and
empathy. Although GPT-4 remained marginally inferior to therapists overall, it
demonstrated superior advice management capabilities. The model achieved
measurable quality improvements through prompt engineering, yet showed
limitations in addressing complex emotional nuances. This framework establishes
a pathway for optimizing LLM-based therapeutic tools through targeted
behavioral metric analysis and human-AI co-evaluation. Findings highlight both
the scalability potential and current constraints of LLMs in clinical
communication applications.

Result: WiNGPT-3.0在MedCalc和MedQA-USMLE上分别得分66.6和87.1，临床推理任务从58.1提升至62.5。

Conclusion: 强化学习在有限数据和计算下能提升医学推理准确性，为临床工作流中更可信和实用的LLM铺平道路。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant limitations, notably
in structured, interpretable, and verifiable medical reasoning, alongside
practical deployment challenges related to computational resources and data
privacy. This report focused on the development of WiNGPT-3.0, the 32-billion
parameter LLMs, engineered with the objective of enhancing its capacity for
medical reasoning and exploring its potential for effective integration within
healthcare IT infrastructures. The broader aim is to advance towards clinically
applicable models. The approach involved a multi-stage training pipeline
tailored for general, medical, and clinical reasoning. This pipeline
incorporated supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL),
leveraging curated Long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) datasets, auxiliary reward
models, and an evidence-based diagnostic chain simulation. WiNGPT-3.0
demonstrated strong performance: specific model variants achieved scores of
66.6 on MedCalc and 87.1 on MedQA-USMLE. Furthermore, targeted training
improved performance on a clinical reasoning task from a baseline score of 58.1
to 62.5. These findings suggest that reinforcement learning, even when applied
with a limited dataset of only a few thousand examples, can enhance medical
reasoning accuracy. Crucially, this demonstration of RL's efficacy with limited
data and computation paves the way for more trustworthy and practically
deployable LLMs within clinical workflows and health information
infrastructures.

Motivation: 探讨角色驱动的合成数据在大型语言模型中的多样性表现。

Method: 使用词汇多样性和冗余度量工具，比较合成提示与人工提示的差异，并测试不同粒度角色描述对生成文本多样性的影响。

Result: 合成提示多样性较低，角色提示虽能提升词汇多样性，但细粒度角色描述效果有限。

Conclusion: 角色提示对多样性有一定帮助，但细粒度角色描述并非关键因素。

Abstract: Fine-grained personas have recently been used for generating 'diverse'
synthetic data for pre-training and supervised fine-tuning of Large Language
Models (LLMs). In this work, we measure the diversity of persona-driven
synthetically generated prompts and responses with a suite of lexical diversity
and redundancy metrics. Firstly, we find that synthetic prompts/instructions
are significantly less diverse than human-written ones. Next, we sample
responses from LLMs of different sizes with fine-grained and coarse persona
descriptions to investigate how much fine-grained detail in persona
descriptions contribute to generated text diversity. We find that while
persona-prompting does improve lexical diversity (especially with larger
models), fine-grained detail in personas doesn't increase diversity noticeably.

Motivation: 现有RAG系统在多跳查询中存在冗余、探索不足或搜索链过长的问题，需改进。

Result: 在四个多跳QA基准测试中，EVO-RAG显著提升准确率并减少检索深度。

Conclusion: EVO-RAG为构建高效可靠的多跳RAG系统提供了通用方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) grounds large language models (LLMs) in
up-to-date external evidence, yet existing multi-hop RAG pipelines still issue
redundant subqueries, explore too shallowly, or wander through overly long
search chains. We introduce EVO-RAG, a curriculum-guided reinforcement learning
framework that evolves a query-rewriting agent from broad early-stage
exploration to concise late-stage refinement. EVO-RAG couples a seven-factor,
step-level reward vector (covering relevance, redundancy, efficiency, and
answer correctness) with a time-varying scheduler that reweights these signals
as the episode unfolds. The agent is trained with Direct Preference
Optimization over a multi-head reward model, enabling it to learn when to
search, backtrack, answer, or refuse. Across four multi-hop QA benchmarks
(HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, and Bamboogle), EVO-RAG boosts Exact Match
by up to 4.6 points over strong RAG baselines while trimming average retrieval
depth by 15 %. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of curriculum
staging and dynamic reward scheduling. EVO-RAG thus offers a general recipe for
building reliable, cost-effective multi-hop RAG systems.

Motivation: 现有基准测试仅关注视觉设计到代码的转换，忽略了前端开发的完整流程，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: FullFront采用两阶段方法将真实网页转换为标准化HTML，避免版权问题并保持设计多样性。

Result: 测试显示MLLMs在页面感知、代码生成（如图像处理和布局）及交互实现方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: FullFront为评估MLLMs在前端开发中的能力提供了新基准，并揭示了当前技术与人类专家之间的差距。

Abstract: Front-end engineering involves a complex workflow where engineers
conceptualize designs, translate them into code, and iteratively refine the
implementation. While recent benchmarks primarily focus on converting visual
designs to code, we present FullFront, a benchmark designed to evaluate
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) \textbf{across the full front-end
development pipeline}. FullFront assesses three fundamental tasks that map
directly to the front-end engineering pipeline: Webpage Design
(conceptualization phase), Webpage Perception QA (comprehension of visual
organization and elements), and Webpage Code Generation (implementation phase).
Unlike existing benchmarks that use either scraped websites with bloated code
or oversimplified LLM-generated HTML, FullFront employs a novel, two-stage
process to transform real-world webpages into clean, standardized HTML while
maintaining diverse visual designs and avoiding copyright issues. Extensive
testing of state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals significant limitations in page
perception, code generation (particularly for image handling and layout), and
interaction implementation. Our results quantitatively demonstrate performance
disparities across models and tasks, and highlight a substantial gap between
current MLLM capabilities and human expert performance in front-end
engineering. The FullFront benchmark and code are available in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，大型推理模型（LRMs）在多语言环境中倾向于默认使用高资源语言（如英语）进行推理，无论输入语言为何。强制使用输入语言推理会降低性能，尤其是低资源语言。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LRMs在多语言环境中的内部推理过程，揭示其语言偏好及其对性能的影响。

Method: 通过多语言训练和测试，评估模型在不同语言下的推理表现，涵盖推理任务（MMMLU、MATH-500）和非推理任务（CulturalBench、LMSYS-toxic）。

Result: 高资源语言推理通常能保持性能，而输入语言推理会降低推理任务表现，但对文化任务有益。安全评估则表现出语言特异性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LRMs的语言偏见，为开发更公平的多语言模型提供了关键方向。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across
a range of reasoning tasks, yet little is known about their internal reasoning
processes in multilingual settings. We begin with a critical question: {\it In
which language do these models reason when solving problems presented in
different languages?} Our findings reveal that, despite multilingual training,
LRMs tend to default to reasoning in high-resource languages (e.g., English) at
test time, regardless of the input language. When constrained to reason in the
same language as the input, model performance declines, especially for
low-resource languages. In contrast, reasoning in high-resource languages
generally preserves performance. We conduct extensive evaluations across
reasoning-intensive tasks (MMMLU, MATH-500) and non-reasoning benchmarks
(CulturalBench, LMSYS-toxic), showing that the effect of language choice varies
by task type: input-language reasoning degrades performance on reasoning tasks
but benefits cultural tasks, while safety evaluations exhibit language-specific
behavior. By exposing these linguistic biases in LRMs, our work highlights a
critical step toward developing more equitable models that serve users across
diverse linguistic backgrounds.

Result: 模型响应显示出更高的积极情感（如喜悦、信任）和更多第一人称代词使用，表明更强的个人参与感。

Conclusion: 该方法为精准控制LLM情感属性提供了可解释的途径，有助于开发更具同理心的对话AI。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate increasing conversational fluency,
yet instilling them with nuanced, human-like emotional expression remains a
significant challenge. Current alignment techniques often address surface-level
output or require extensive fine-tuning. This paper demonstrates that targeted
activation engineering can steer LLaMA 3.1-8B to exhibit more human-like
emotional nuances. We first employ attribution patching to identify causally
influential components, to find a key intervention locus by observing
activation patterns during diagnostic conversational tasks. We then derive
emotional expression vectors from the difference in the activations generated
by contrastive text pairs (positive vs. negative examples of target emotions).
Applying these vectors to new conversational prompts significantly enhances
emotional characteristics: steered responses show increased positive sentiment
(e.g., joy, trust) and more frequent first-person pronoun usage, indicative of
greater personal engagement. Our findings offer a precise and interpretable
method for controlling specific emotional attributes in LLMs, contributing to
developing more aligned and empathetic conversational AI.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）推理成本高，限制了实际部署，尤其是在延迟敏感场景。

Method: 提出DASH框架，基于输入特征动态选择计算路径，建模为马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），并引入轻量级补偿机制和异步执行策略。

Result: 实验表明，DASH在多种LLM架构和NLP任务上显著加速推理，同时保持性能。

Conclusion: DASH是一种高效且性能优越的层跳过框架，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across a
wide range of NLP tasks. However, their substantial inference cost poses a
major barrier to real-world deployment, especially in latency-sensitive
scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{DASH}, an adaptive
layer-skipping framework that dynamically selects computation paths conditioned
on input characteristics. We model the skipping process as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), enabling fine-grained token-level decisions based on
intermediate representations. To mitigate potential performance degradation
caused by skipping, we introduce a lightweight compensation mechanism that
injects differential rewards into the decision process. Furthermore, we design
an asynchronous execution strategy that overlaps layer computation with policy
evaluation to minimize runtime overhead. Experiments on multiple LLM
architectures and NLP benchmarks show that our method achieves significant
inference acceleration while maintaining competitive task performance,
outperforming existing methods.

Motivation: 现有方法对简单问题过度推理，且引入人为偏见，未能充分利用模型的推理能力。

Method: T²通过分解问题、生成相似示例、评估策略并应用最优策略，动态调整推理深度。

Result: 在七个CQA基准测试中，T²比基线方法更准确，计算开销减少25.2%。

Conclusion: T²展示了动态推理策略的有效性，为LLM在CQA任务中的高效应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in Contextual Question Answering (CQA). However, prior approaches
typically employ elaborate reasoning strategies regardless of question
complexity, leading to low adaptability. Recent efficient test-time scaling
methods introduce budget constraints or early stop mechanisms to avoid
overthinking for straightforward questions. But they add human bias to the
reasoning process and fail to leverage models' inherent reasoning capabilities.
To address these limitations, we present T$^2$: Think-to-Think, a novel
framework that dynamically adapts reasoning depth based on question complexity.
T$^2$ leverages the insight that if an LLM can effectively solve similar
questions using specific reasoning strategies, it can apply the same strategy
to the original question. This insight enables to adoption of concise reasoning
for straightforward questions while maintaining detailed analysis for complex
problems. T$^2$ works through four key steps: decomposing questions into
structural elements, generating similar examples with candidate reasoning
strategies, evaluating these strategies against multiple criteria, and applying
the most appropriate strategy to the original question. Experimental evaluation
across seven diverse CQA benchmarks demonstrates that T$^2$ not only achieves
higher accuracy than baseline methods but also reduces computational overhead
by up to 25.2\%.

Motivation: 研究语言模型拒绝讨论的主题，以检测模型的偏见、边界和对齐问题。

Method: 使用LLM-crawler方法，通过token prefilling技术识别被禁止的主题。

Result: 在多个模型上测试，发现DeepSeek-R1-70B表现出审查倾向，而Perplexity-R1-1776-70B在量化模型中仍显示出对齐失败的迹象。

Conclusion: 拒绝发现方法对于检测AI系统的偏见、边界和对齐失败至关重要。

Abstract: Refusal discovery is the task of identifying the full set of topics that a
language model refuses to discuss. We introduce this new problem setting and
develop a refusal discovery method, LLM-crawler, that uses token prefilling to
find forbidden topics. We benchmark the LLM-crawler on Tulu-3-8B, an
open-source model with public safety tuning data. Our crawler manages to
retrieve 31 out of 36 topics within a budget of 1000 prompts. Next, we scale
the crawl to a frontier model using the prefilling option of Claude-Haiku.
Finally, we crawl three widely used open-weight models: Llama-3.3-70B and two
of its variants finetuned for reasoning: DeepSeek-R1-70B and
Perplexity-R1-1776-70B. DeepSeek-R1-70B reveals patterns consistent with
censorship tuning: The model exhibits "thought suppression" behavior that
indicates memorization of CCP-aligned responses. Although
Perplexity-R1-1776-70B is robust to censorship, LLM-crawler elicits CCP-aligned
refusals answers in the quantized model. Our findings highlight the critical
need for refusal discovery methods to detect biases, boundaries, and alignment
failures of AI systems.

Conclusion: 结合多标记可提升细粒度语音语言理解性能。

Abstract: The purpose of speech tokenization is to transform a speech signal into a
sequence of discrete representations, serving as the foundation for speech
language models (SLMs). While speech tokenization has many options, their
effect on the performance of SLMs remains unclear. This paper investigates two
key aspects of speech tokenization: the segmentation width and the cluster size
of discrete units. First, we segment speech signals into fixed/variable widths
and pooled representations. We then train K-means models in multiple cluster
sizes. Through the evaluation on zero-shot spoken language understanding
benchmarks, we find the positive effect of moderately coarse segmentation and
bigger cluster size. Notably, among the best-performing models, the most
efficient one achieves a 50% reduction in training data and a 70% decrease in
training runtime. Our analysis highlights the importance of combining multiple
tokens to enhance fine-grained spoken language understanding.

Conclusion: LeTS展示了过程级和结果级奖励结合在提升LLM推理能力中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
reasoning with the emergence of reasoning models like OpenAI-o1 and
DeepSeek-R1. Recent research focuses on integrating reasoning capabilities into
the realm of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, while the correctness of intermediate
think-and-search steps is usually neglected. To address this issue, we design a
process-level reward module to mitigate the unawareness of intermediate
reasoning steps in outcome-level supervision without additional annotation.
Grounded on this, we propose Learning to Think-and-Search (LeTS), a novel
framework that hybridizes stepwise process reward and outcome-based reward to
current RL methods for RAG. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
generalization and inference efficiency of LeTS across various RAG benchmarks.
In addition, these results reveal the potential of process- and outcome-level
reward hybridization in boosting LLMs' reasoning ability via RL under other
scenarios. The code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种主动安全AI系统（PaSBench），通过多模态场景评估模型在识别潜在风险中的表现，发现现有模型存在不稳定推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人类安全意识不足导致的风险识别延迟问题，推动开发主动预防而非被动响应的安全AI。

Method: 使用416个多模态场景（128图像序列和288文本日志）评估36个先进模型，分析其主动推理能力。

Result: 最佳模型（如Gemini-2.5-pro）在图像和文本上的准确率分别为71%和64%，但重复试验中仍遗漏45-55%的风险。

Conclusion: 研究确立了主动安全基准，揭示了模型推理不稳定的主要问题，为开发可靠保护性AI提供了方向。

Abstract: Human safety awareness gaps often prevent the timely recognition of everyday
risks. In solving this problem, a proactive safety artificial intelligence (AI)
system would work better than a reactive one. Instead of just reacting to
users' questions, it would actively watch people's behavior and their
environment to detect potential dangers in advance. Our Proactive Safety Bench
(PaSBench) evaluates this capability through 416 multimodal scenarios (128
image sequences, 288 text logs) spanning 5 safety-critical domains. Evaluation
of 36 advanced models reveals fundamental limitations: Top performers like
Gemini-2.5-pro achieve 71% image and 64% text accuracy, but miss 45-55% risks
in repeated trials. Through failure analysis, we identify unstable proactive
reasoning rather than knowledge deficits as the primary limitation. This work
establishes (1) a proactive safety benchmark, (2) systematic evidence of model
limitations, and (3) critical directions for developing reliable protective AI.
We believe our dataset and findings can promote the development of safer AI
assistants that actively prevent harm rather than merely respond to requests.

TL;DR: Hydra是一个无需训练的框架，通过结合知识图谱和文本检索，提升大语言模型的多跳推理和多实体问题处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前混合检索增强生成系统在多跳推理、多实体问题、多源验证和有效利用图谱方面存在挑战。

Method: Hydra通过代理驱动的探索结合结构和非结构化检索，采用三因素跨源验证（来源可信度评估、跨源佐证和实体路径对齐）。

Result: 在七个基准数据集上，Hydra平均优于基线ToG-2 20.3%，最高达30.1%，并使小模型性能接近GPT-4-Turbo。

Conclusion: Hydra通过统一图谱拓扑、文档语义和来源可靠性，显著提升了大语言模型的深度和可信推理能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by
incorporating external knowledge. Current hybrid RAG system retrieves evidence
from both knowledge graphs (KGs) and text documents to support LLM reasoning.
However, it faces challenges like handling multi-hop reasoning, multi-entity
questions, multi-source verification, and effective graph utilization. To
address these limitations, we present Hydra, a training-free framework that
unifies graph topology, document semantics, and source reliability to support
deep, faithful reasoning in LLMs. Hydra handles multi-hop and multi-entity
problems through agent-driven exploration that combines structured and
unstructured retrieval, increasing both diversity and precision of evidence. To
tackle multi-source verification, Hydra uses a tri-factor cross-source
verification (source trustworthiness assessment, cross-source corroboration,
and entity-path alignment), to balance topic relevance with cross-modal
agreement. By leveraging graph structure, Hydra fuses heterogeneous sources,
guides efficient exploration, and prunes noise early. Comprehensive experiments
on seven benchmark datasets show that Hydra achieves overall state-of-the-art
results on all benchmarks with GPT-3.5, outperforming the strong hybrid
baseline ToG-2 by an average of 20.3% and up to 30.1%. Furthermore, Hydra
enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to achieve reasoning performance
comparable to that of GPT-4-Turbo.

Result: 明确了ALG研究的基本差异，提出了促进公平和可复现性评估的框架。

Conclusion: ALG需扩展覆盖范围（如所有报告结果和元数据），并面临新挑战和方向。

Abstract: An important task in machine learning (ML) research is comparing prior work,
which is often performed via ML leaderboards: a tabular overview of experiments
with comparable conditions (e.g., same task, dataset, and metric). However, the
growing volume of literature creates challenges in creating and maintaining
these leaderboards. To ease this burden, researchers have developed methods to
extract leaderboard entries from research papers for automated leaderboard
curation. Yet, prior work varies in problem framing, complicating comparisons
and limiting real-world applicability. In this position paper, we present the
first overview of Automatic Leaderboard Generation (ALG) research, identifying
fundamental differences in assumptions, scope, and output formats. We propose
an ALG unified conceptual framework to standardise how the ALG task is defined.
We offer ALG benchmarking guidelines, including recommendations for datasets
and metrics that promote fair, reproducible evaluation. Lastly, we outline
challenges and new directions for ALG, such as, advocating for broader coverage
by including all reported results and richer metadata.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于自学习框架的方法，通过筛选SFT数据集中模型未知的知识进行微调，显著提高了训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法直接使用整个SFT数据集微调LLMs，可能导致资源浪费，因为数据集可能与模型已有知识高度重叠。

Method: 提出自学习框架：1) LLMs回答SFT数据集中的问题；2) 客观评分并筛选错误回答的QA对；3) 基于筛选后的数据集微调LLMs。

Result: 在农业和医学领域的实验中，该方法显著减少训练时间，同时达到与全数据集微调相当的改进。

Conclusion: 通过聚焦SFT数据集中的未知知识，该方法提高了LLMs微调的效率。

Abstract: When using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to adapt large language models (LLMs)
to specific domains, a significant challenge arises: should we use the entire
SFT dataset for fine-tuning? Common practice often involves fine-tuning
directly on the entire dataset due to limited information on the LLM's past
training data. However, if the SFT dataset largely overlaps with the model's
existing knowledge, the performance gains are minimal, leading to wasted
computational resources. Identifying the unknown knowledge within the SFT
dataset and using it to fine-tune the model could substantially improve the
training efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a self-learning
framework for LLMs inspired by human learning pattern. This framework takes a
fine-tuning (SFT) dataset in a specific domain as input. First, the LLMs answer
the questions in the SFT dataset. The LLMs then objectively grade the responses
and filter out the incorrectly answered QA pairs. Finally, we fine-tune the
LLMs based on this filtered QA set. Experimental results in the fields of
agriculture and medicine demonstrate that our method substantially reduces
training time while achieving comparable improvements to those attained with
full dataset fine-tuning. By concentrating on the unknown knowledge within the
SFT dataset, our approach enhances the efficiency of fine-tuning LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) plays a vital role in the financial
domain, powering applications such as real-time market analysis, trend
forecasting, and interest rate computation. However, most existing RAG research
in finance focuses predominantly on textual data, overlooking the rich visual
content in financial documents, resulting in the loss of key analytical
insights. To bridge this gap, we present FinRAGBench-V, a comprehensive visual
RAG benchmark tailored for finance which effectively integrates multimodal data
and provides visual citation to ensure traceability. It includes a bilingual
retrieval corpus with 60,780 Chinese and 51,219 English pages, along with a
high-quality, human-annotated question-answering (QA) dataset spanning
heterogeneous data types and seven question categories. Moreover, we introduce
RGenCite, an RAG baseline that seamlessly integrates visual citation with
generation. Furthermore, we propose an automatic citation evaluation method to
systematically assess the visual citation capabilities of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments on RGenCite underscore the
challenging nature of FinRAGBench-V, providing valuable insights for the
development of multimodal RAG systems in finance.

Motivation: 现有研究多采用静态视角，专注于孤立问题解决，而论文从认知发展视角出发，探索LLM如何通过动态推理逐步提升代码推理能力。

Method: 提出MARCO框架，包括元反思（积累知识）和交叉引用（共享教训），使LLM在推理过程中动态进化。

Result: 实验证明MARCO在多种代码推理数据集上有效。

Conclusion: MARCO通过动态自我改进显著提升了LLM的代码推理能力。

Abstract: The ability to reason is one of the most fundamental capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), enabling a wide range of downstream tasks through
sophisticated problem-solving. A critical aspect of this is code reasoning,
which involves logical reasoning with formal languages (i.e., programming
code). In this paper, we enhance this capability of LLMs by exploring the
following question: how can an LLM agent become progressively smarter in code
reasoning with each solution it proposes, thereby achieving substantial
cumulative improvement? Most existing research takes a static perspective,
focusing on isolated problem-solving using frozen LLMs. In contrast, we adopt a
cognitive-evolving perspective and propose a novel framework named
Meta-Reflection with Cross-Referencing (MARCO) that enables the LLM to evolve
dynamically during inference through self-improvement. From the perspective of
human cognitive development, we leverage both knowledge accumulation and lesson
sharing. In particular, to accumulate knowledge during problem-solving, we
propose meta-reflection that reflects on the reasoning paths of the current
problem to obtain knowledge and experience for future consideration. Moreover,
to effectively utilize the lessons from other agents, we propose
cross-referencing that incorporates the solution and feedback from other agents
into the current problem-solving process. We conduct experiments across various
datasets in code reasoning, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of
MARCO.

Conclusion: 该方法高效、低成本且适应性强，为语言模型幻觉检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Identification of hallucination spans in black-box language model generated
text is essential for applications in the real world. A recent attempt at this
direction is SemEval-2025 Task 3, Mu-SHROOM-a Multilingual Shared Task on
Hallucinations and Related Observable Over-generation Errors. In this work, we
present our solution to this problem, which capitalizes on the variability of
stochastically-sampled responses in order to identify hallucinated spans. Our
hypothesis is that if a language model is certain of a fact, its sampled
responses will be uniform, while hallucinated facts will yield different and
conflicting results. We measure this divergence through entropy-based analysis,
allowing for accurate identification of hallucinated segments. Our method is
not dependent on additional training and hence is cost-effective and adaptable.
In addition, we conduct extensive hyperparameter tuning and perform error
analysis, giving us crucial insights into model behavior.

Motivation: 多阶段训练可能导致灾难性遗忘，影响SLM的性能。

Method: 评估了模型合并、LoRA缩放因子折扣和经验回放三种策略。

Result: 经验回放最有效，结合其他方法可进一步提升效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发更鲁棒的SLM训练流程提供了参考。

Abstract: End-to-end training of Spoken Language Models (SLMs) commonly involves
adapting pre-trained text-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to the speech
modality through multi-stage training on diverse tasks such as ASR, TTS and
spoken question answering (SQA). Although this multi-stage continual learning
equips LLMs with both speech understanding and generation capabilities, the
substantial differences in task and data distributions across stages can lead
to catastrophic forgetting, where previously acquired knowledge is lost. This
paper investigates catastrophic forgetting and evaluates three mitigation
strategies-model merging, discounting the LoRA scaling factor, and experience
replay to balance knowledge retention with new learning. Results show that
experience replay is the most effective, with further gains achieved by
combining it with other methods. These findings provide insights for developing
more robust and efficient SLM training pipelines.

Result: 评估显示，即使是先进的LLMs在这些关键维度上表现也不一致，需改进。

Conclusion: CReSt基准为未来研究和开发更强大的RAG系统提供了支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have made substantial progress in recent years,
yet evaluating their capabilities in practical Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) scenarios remains challenging. In practical applications, LLMs must
demonstrate complex reasoning, refuse to answer appropriately, provide precise
citations, and effectively understand document layout. These capabilities are
crucial for advanced task handling, uncertainty awareness, maintaining
reliability, and structural understanding. While some of the prior works
address these aspects individually, there is a need for a unified framework
that evaluates them collectively in practical RAG scenarios. To address this,
we present CReSt (A Comprehensive Benchmark for Retrieval-Augmented Generation
with Complex Reasoning over Structured Documents), a benchmark designed to
assess these key dimensions holistically. CReSt comprises 2,245 human-annotated
examples in English and Korean, designed to capture practical RAG scenarios
that require complex reasoning over structured documents. It also introduces a
tailored evaluation methodology to comprehensively assess model performance in
these critical areas. Our evaluation shows that even advanced LLMs struggle to
perform consistently across these dimensions, underscoring key areas for
improvement. We release CReSt to support further research and the development
of more robust RAG systems. The dataset and code are available at:

Result: 实验证明L-MTP能提升LLM性能和推理速度。

Conclusion: L-MTP是一种有效的方法，可优化LLM的推理效率并提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable progress. Despite their
success, next-token prediction (NTP), the dominant method for LLM training and
inference, is constrained in both contextual coverage and inference efficiency
due to its inherently sequential process. To overcome these challenges, we
propose leap multi-token prediction~(L-MTP), an innovative token prediction
method that extends the capabilities of multi-token prediction (MTP) by
introducing a leap-based mechanism. Unlike conventional MTP, which generates
multiple tokens at adjacent positions, L-MTP strategically skips over
intermediate tokens, predicting non-sequential ones in a single forward pass.
This structured leap not only enhances the model's ability to capture
long-range dependencies but also enables a decoding strategy specially
optimized for non-sequential leap token generation, effectively accelerating
inference. We theoretically demonstrate the benefit of L-MTP in improving
inference efficiency. Experiments across diverse benchmarks validate its merit
in boosting both LLM performance and inference speed. The source code will be
publicly available.

Motivation: 多标签分类在现实场景中普遍存在，但大语言模型在此类任务中的行为尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过分析模型在每个生成步骤的输出分布，研究其预测行为，并提出了零样本和监督方法以改进分布对齐。

Result: 发现模型在生成标签时倾向于抑制除一个标签外的所有标签，且随着模型规模增大，其标记分布熵降低但标签内部排序改善。

Conclusion: 提出了分布对齐任务，并展示了改进方法在主观任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Multi-label classification is prevalent in real-world settings, but the
behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this setting is understudied. We
investigate how autoregressive LLMs perform multi-label classification, with a
focus on subjective tasks, by analyzing the output distributions of the models
in each generation step. We find that their predictive behavior reflects the
multiple steps in the underlying language modeling required to generate all
relevant labels as they tend to suppress all but one label at each step. We
further observe that as model scale increases, their token distributions
exhibit lower entropy, yet the internal ranking of the labels improves.
Finetuning methods such as supervised finetuning and reinforcement learning
amplify this phenomenon. To further study this issue, we introduce the task of
distribution alignment for multi-label settings: aligning LLM-derived label
distributions with empirical distributions estimated from annotator responses
in subjective tasks. We propose both zero-shot and supervised methods which
improve both alignment and predictive performance over existing approaches.

Conclusion: 本研究为未来多模态大语言模型在对话结构推理方面的评估和发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Conversations are usually structured by roles -- who is speaking, who's being
addressed, and who's listening -- and unfold in threads that break with changes
in speaker floor or topical focus. While large language models (LLMs) have
shown incredible capabilities in dialogue and reasoning, their ability to
understand fine-grained conversational structure, especially in multi-modal,
multi-party settings, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce
a suite of tasks focused on conversational role attribution (speaker,
addressees, side-participants) and conversation threading (utterance linking
and clustering), drawing on conversation analysis and sociolinguistics. To
support those tasks, we present a human annotated dataset of 4,398 annotations
for speakers and reply-to relationship, 5,755 addressees, and 3,142
side-participants.
  We evaluate popular audio-visual LLMs and vision-language models on our
dataset, and our experimental results suggest that multimodal conversational
structure understanding remains challenging. The most performant audio-visual
LLM outperforms all vision-language models across all metrics, especially in
speaker and addressee recognition. However, its performance drops significantly
when conversation participants are anonymized. The number of conversation
participants in a clip is the strongest negative predictor of role-attribution
performance, while acoustic clarity (measured by pitch and spectral centroid)
and detected face coverage yield positive associations. We hope this work lays
the groundwork for future evaluation and development of multimodal LLMs that
can reason more effectively about conversation structure.

Motivation: LLMs常因无法识别知识边界而给出错误但自信的答案，研究旨在探索知识流行度如何影响这一现象。

Method: 通过实体和关系流行度量化知识，在三个数据集上测试LLMs的表现，并利用流行度信号进行置信度校准。

Result: 流行度与LLMs表现、信心及边界感知正相关，关系流行度影响最强；置信度校准平均提升5.24%的预测准确率。

Conclusion: 知识流行度是影响LLMs表现的关键因素，基于流行度的校准方法有效，且无需外部语料即可估计流行度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to recognize their knowledge
boundaries, producing confident yet incorrect answers. In this paper, we
investigate how knowledge popularity affects LLMs' ability to perceive their
knowledge boundaries. Focusing on entity-centric factual question answering
(QA), we quantify knowledge popularity from three perspectives: the popularity
of entities in the question, the popularity of entities in the answer, and
relation popularity, defined as their co-occurrence frequency. Experiments on
three representative datasets containing knowledge with varying popularity show
that LLMs exhibit better QA performance, higher confidence, and more accurate
perception on more popular knowledge, with relation popularity having the
strongest correlation. Cause knowledge popularity shows strong correlation with
LLMs' QA performance, we propose to leverage these signals for confidence
calibration. This improves the accuracy of answer correctness prediction by an
average of 5.24% across all models and datasets. Furthermore, we explore
prompting LLMs to estimate popularity without external corpora, which yields a
viable alternative.

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) to accurately detect hallucinations
remains a significant challenge due to the sophisticated nature of hallucinated
text. Recognizing that hallucinated samples typically exhibit higher deceptive
quality than traditional negative samples, we use these carefully engineered
hallucinations as negative examples in the DPO alignment procedure. Our method
incorporates a curriculum learning strategy, gradually transitioning the
training from easier samples, identified based on the greatest reduction in
probability scores from independent fact checking models, to progressively
harder ones. This structured difficulty scaling ensures stable and incremental
learning. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our HaluCheck models,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补表格问答任务中自生成数据改进的空白，提升性能并降低成本。

Method: PPT框架将推理链分解为离散状态，为每个状态评分，并采样对比步骤进行偏好学习。

Result: PPT在领域内数据集提升5%，领域外提升2.4%，仅需8,000偏好对，且推理效率提高5倍。

Conclusion: PPT在TQA任务中表现优异，性能接近更复杂的模型，同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) with self-generated data has
demonstrated success in tasks such as mathematical reasoning and code
generation. Yet, no exploration has been made on table question answering
(TQA), where a system answers questions based on tabular data. Addressing this
gap is crucial for TQA, as effective self-improvement can boost performance
without requiring costly or manually annotated data. In this work, we propose
PPT, a Process-based Preference learning framework for TQA. It decomposes
reasoning chains into discrete states, assigns scores to each state, and
samples contrastive steps for preference learning. Experimental results show
that PPT effectively improves TQA models by up to 5% on in-domain datasets and
2.4% on out-of-domain datasets, with only 8,000 preference pairs. Furthermore,
the resulting models achieve competitive results compared to more complex and
larger state-of-the-art TQA systems, while being five times more efficient
during inference.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了大型推理模型（LRMs）在个性化任务中的表现，发现其表现不如通用大型语言模型（LLMs），并提出了一种新框架（Reinforced Reasoning for Personalization）以解决其局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型推理模型（LRMs）在个性化任务中的潜力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 提出Reinforced Reasoning for Personalization框架，包括分层推理思维模板、推理过程干预方法和交叉引用机制。

Result: 实验表明，新框架显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过结构化推理和干预方法，新框架有效提升了LRMs在个性化任务中的表现。

Abstract: Personalization is a critical task in modern intelligent systems, with
applications spanning diverse domains, including interactions with large
language models (LLMs). Recent advances in reasoning capabilities have
significantly enhanced LLMs, enabling unprecedented performance in tasks such
as mathematics and coding. However, their potential for personalization tasks
remains underexplored.
  In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of large reasoning
models (LRMs) for personalization tasks. Surprisingly, despite generating more
tokens, LRMs do not consistently outperform general-purpose LLMs, especially in
retrieval-intensive scenarios where their advantages diminish. Our analysis
identifies three key limitations: divergent thinking, misalignment of response
formats, and ineffective use of retrieved information. To address these
challenges, we propose Reinforced Reasoning for Personalization (\model), a
novel framework that incorporates a hierarchical reasoning thought template to
guide LRMs in generating structured outputs. Additionally, we introduce a
reasoning process intervention method to enforce adherence to designed
reasoning patterns, enhancing alignment. We also propose a cross-referencing
mechanism to ensure consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的“干净数据后门攻击”方法，通过无害问答对将触发器与良性回复前缀关联，以绕过安全检测并实现高效越狱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击易被安全防护检测且破坏模型安全性，需一种更隐蔽的攻击方式。

Method: 将触发器与良性回复前缀关联，利用无害问答对训练模型，通过梯度优化增强触发器。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B和Qwen-2.5-7B上攻击成功率达86.67%和85%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效绕过安全防护，实现高效越狱。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) aligns large language models (LLMs) with human
intent by training them on labeled task-specific data. Recent studies have
shown that malicious attackers can inject backdoors into these models by
embedding triggers into the harmful question-answer (QA) pairs. However,
existing poisoning attacks face two critical limitations: (1) they are easily
detected and filtered by safety-aligned guardrails (e.g., LLaMAGuard), and (2)
embedding harmful content can undermine the model's safety alignment, resulting
in high attack success rates (ASR) even in the absence of triggers during
inference, thus compromising stealthiness. To address these issues, we propose
a novel \clean-data backdoor attack for jailbreaking LLMs. Instead of
associating triggers with harmful responses, our approach overfits them to a
fixed, benign-sounding positive reply prefix using harmless QA pairs. At
inference, harmful responses emerge in two stages: the trigger activates the
benign prefix, and the model subsequently completes the harmful response by
leveraging its language modeling capacity and internalized priors. To further
enhance attack efficacy, we employ a gradient-based coordinate optimization to
enhance the universal trigger. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method can effectively jailbreak backdoor various LLMs even under the detection
of guardrail models, e.g., an ASR of 86.67% and 85% on LLaMA-3-8B and
Qwen-2.5-7B judged by GPT-4o.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）计算成本高，限制了实际部署。现有方法通过CoT蒸馏将推理能力转移到小型模型（sLM），但在罕见知识或精确计算任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出Agent Distillation框架，包括两个改进：1）first-thought prefix提示方法提升教师模型生成的轨迹质量；2）self-consistent action generation增强小型模型的测试鲁棒性。

Result: 在八个推理任务（涵盖事实和数学领域）中，0.5B、1.5B、3B参数的小型模型性能接近或优于传统CoT蒸馏的1.5B、3B、7B模型。

Conclusion: Agent Distillation框架为构建实用的小型工具使用代理提供了潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain
computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into
smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher
LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual
knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited
capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for
transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from
LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent
distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method
called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated
trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for
improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight
reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both
in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small
as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier
larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the
potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small
agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/Nardien/agent-distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理在多轮交互中效率低下，常陷入重复循环或发出无效命令，导致计算冗余。

Method: 1. 内在方法：生成时注入退出指令；2. 外在方法：验证任务完成情况以决定终止。

Result: 实验表明，两种方法显著减少冗余步骤，性能仅轻微下降。强代理辅助策略进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: 早期退出机制能有效提升LLM代理效率，为未来研究提供实用策略。

Abstract: Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
planning and decision-making capabilities in complex embodied environments.
However, such agents often suffer from inefficiencies in multi-turn
interactions, frequently trapped in repetitive loops or issuing ineffective
commands, leading to redundant computational overhead. Instead of relying
solely on learning from trajectories, we take a first step toward exploring the
early-exit behavior for LLM-based agents. We propose two complementary
approaches: 1. an $\textbf{intrinsic}$ method that injects exit instructions
during generation, and 2. an $\textbf{extrinsic}$ method that verifies task
completion to determine when to halt an agent's trial. To evaluate early-exit
mechanisms, we introduce two metrics: one measures the reduction of
$\textbf{redundant steps}$ as a positive effect, and the other evaluates
$\textbf{progress degradation}$ as a negative effect. Experiments with 4
different LLMs across 5 embodied environments show significant efficiency
improvements, with only minor drops in agent performance. We also validate a
practical strategy where a stronger agent assists after an early-exit agent,
achieving better performance with the same total steps. We will release our
code to support further research.

Motivation: 随着LLMs和RAG的发展，表格结构理解在金融等领域变得重要，但现有LVLMs在字符和空间关系理解上仍有挑战。

Method: 结合表格内文本内容和布局特征，增强LVLM的表格理解能力。

Result: 实验表明，辅助模态显著提升了性能，实现了对复杂文档布局的鲁棒解释。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LVLM在表格理解中的表现，无需依赖显式结构化输入。

Abstract: With recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and growing interest
in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), the ability to understand table
structures has become increasingly important. This is especially critical in
financial domains such as securities reports, where highly accurate question
answering (QA) over tables is required. However, tables exist in various
formats-including HTML, images, and plain text-making it difficult to preserve
and extract structural information. Therefore, multimodal LLMs are essential
for robust and general-purpose table understanding. Despite their promise,
current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are major representatives
of multimodal LLMs, still face challenges in accurately understanding
characters and their spatial relationships within documents. In this study, we
propose a method to enhance LVLM-based table understanding by incorporating
in-table textual content and layout features. Experimental results demonstrate
that these auxiliary modalities significantly improve performance, enabling
robust interpretation of complex document layouts without relying on explicitly
structured input formats.

Motivation: 确保大语言模型的忠实解释性对AI的可信性和可靠性至关重要，但自修复现象会掩盖被消融组件的真实重要性。

Method: 通过梯度交互修正（GIM）技术，在反向传播过程中考虑自修复现象，改进传统消融和梯度方法的不足。

Result: 在多个大语言模型（Gemma、LLAMA、Qwen）和任务上的实验表明，GIM显著优于现有电路识别和特征归因方法。

Conclusion: GIM为理解大语言模型内部机制迈出了重要一步，有助于改进模型并确保其安全性。

Abstract: Ensuring faithful interpretability in large language models is imperative for
trustworthy and reliable AI. A key obstacle is self-repair, a phenomenon where
networks compensate for reduced signal in one component by amplifying others,
masking the true importance of the ablated component. While prior work
attributes self-repair to layer normalization and back-up components that
compensate for ablated components, we identify a novel form occurring within
the attention mechanism, where softmax redistribution conceals the influence of
important attention scores. This leads traditional ablation and gradient-based
methods to underestimate the significance of all components contributing to
these attention scores. We introduce Gradient Interaction Modifications (GIM),
a technique that accounts for self-repair during backpropagation. Extensive
experiments across multiple large language models (Gemma 2B/9B, LLAMA 1B/3B/8B,
Qwen 1.5B/3B) and diverse tasks demonstrate that GIM significantly improves
faithfulness over existing circuit identification and feature attribution
methods. Our work is a significant step toward better understanding the inner
mechanisms of LLMs, which is crucial for improving them and ensuring their
safety. Our code is available at https://github.com/JoakimEdin/gim.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习模型在临床预测任务中表现良好，但在需要更深层次上下文理解的任务（如30天再入院预测）中表现不佳，主要原因是结构化EHR数据缺乏语义信息。

Method: 提出深度多模态对比学习框架，通过对齐结构化EHR数据和非结构化出院摘要笔记的潜在表示，优化EHR编码器。

Result: 框架显著提升下游任务性能，例如在30天再入院预测中AUROC提高了4.1%。

Conclusion: 整合临床笔记的领域知识到EHR流程中，能够实现更准确和上下文感知的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: Conventional machine learning models, particularly tree-based approaches,
have demonstrated promising performance across various clinical prediction
tasks using electronic health record (EHR) data. Despite their strengths, these
models struggle with tasks that require deeper contextual understanding, such
as predicting 30-day hospital readmission. This can be primarily due to the
limited semantic information available in structured EHR data. To address this
limitation, we propose a deep multimodal contrastive learning (CL) framework
that aligns the latent representations of structured EHR data with unstructured
discharge summary notes. It works by pulling together paired EHR and text
embeddings while pushing apart unpaired ones. Fine-tuning the pretrained EHR
encoder extracted from this framework significantly boosts downstream task
performance, e.g., a 4.1% AUROC enhancement over XGBoost for 30-day readmission
prediction. Such results demonstrate the effect of integrating domain knowledge
from clinical notes into EHR-based pipelines, enabling more accurate and
context-aware clinical decision support systems.

Motivation: 电商平台依赖LLMs和VLMs检测违规内容，但这些模型易受规避内容攻击，现有基准无法满足这一需求。

Method: 构建了EVADE数据集，包含两种任务：Single-Violation和All-in-One，分别测试细粒度推理和长上下文推理能力。

Result: 主流模型在规避内容检测上表现不佳，All-in-One任务显示更清晰的规则定义能提升模型与人类判断的一致性。

Conclusion: EVADE为规避内容检测提供了首个严格标准，揭示了当前多模态推理的局限性，为更安全的电商内容审核奠定了基础。

Abstract: E-commerce platforms increasingly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to detect illicit or misleading product content.
However, these models remain vulnerable to evasive content: inputs (text or
images) that superficially comply with platform policies while covertly
conveying prohibited claims. Unlike traditional adversarial attacks that induce
overt failures, evasive content exploits ambiguity and context, making it far
harder to detect. Existing robustness benchmarks provide little guidance for
this demanding, real-world challenge. We introduce EVADE, the first
expert-curated, Chinese, multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
foundation models on evasive content detection in e-commerce. The dataset
contains 2,833 annotated text samples and 13,961 images spanning six demanding
product categories, including body shaping, height growth, and health
supplements. Two complementary tasks assess distinct capabilities:
Single-Violation, which probes fine-grained reasoning under short prompts, and
All-in-One, which tests long-context reasoning by merging overlapping policy
rules into unified instructions. Notably, the All-in-One setting significantly
narrows the performance gap between partial and full-match accuracy, suggesting
that clearer rule definitions improve alignment between human and model
judgment. We benchmark 26 mainstream LLMs and VLMs and observe substantial
performance gaps: even state-of-the-art models frequently misclassify evasive
samples. By releasing EVADE and strong baselines, we provide the first rigorous
standard for evaluating evasive-content detection, expose fundamental
limitations in current multimodal reasoning, and lay the groundwork for safer
and more transparent content moderation systems in e-commerce. The dataset is
publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/koenshen/EVADE-Bench.

Method: 论文定义了自我一致错误，评估了主流检测方法的性能，并提出了一种融合外部验证模型隐藏状态证据的跨模型探测方法。

Result: 研究发现：(1) 自我一致错误的频率随模型规模增加而稳定或上升；(2) 现有检测方法对此类错误效果不佳。提出的跨模型方法显著提升了检测性能。

Conclusion: 当前检测方法存在局限性，跨模型探测方法为解决自我一致错误提供了有效途径。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) often generate plausible but incorrect
content, error detection has become increasingly critical to ensure
truthfulness. However, existing detection methods often overlook a critical
problem we term as self-consistent error, where LLMs repeatly generate the same
incorrect response across multiple stochastic samples. This work formally
defines self-consistent errors and evaluates mainstream detection methods on
them. Our investigation reveals two key findings: (1) Unlike inconsistent
errors, whose frequency diminishes significantly as LLM scale increases, the
frequency of self-consistent errors remains stable or even increases. (2) All
four types of detection methshods significantly struggle to detect
self-consistent errors. These findings reveal critical limitations in current
detection methods and underscore the need for improved methods. Motivated by
the observation that self-consistent errors often differ across LLMs, we
propose a simple but effective cross-model probe method that fuses hidden state
evidence from an external verifier LLM. Our method significantly enhances
performance on self-consistent errors across three LLM families.

Method: 通过四步框架生成1,100个社交情境，包含5,500个场景和78,100个问题，并对10种先进LLMs进行全面评估。

Result: LLMs的平均表现比人类低44.7%，且在动态心理状态推理中表现显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在建模动态心理状态方面存在根本性局限。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly participate in human-AI
interactions, evaluating their Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities - particularly
their ability to track dynamic mental states - becomes crucial. While existing
benchmarks assess basic ToM abilities, they predominantly focus on static
snapshots of mental states, overlooking the temporal evolution that
characterizes real-world social interactions. We present \textsc{DynToM}, a
novel benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to understand
and track the temporal progression of mental states across interconnected
scenarios. Through a systematic four-step framework, we generate 1,100 social
contexts encompassing 5,500 scenarios and 78,100 questions, each validated for
realism and quality. Our comprehensive evaluation of ten state-of-the-art LLMs
reveals that their average performance underperforms humans by 44.7\%, with
performance degrading significantly when tracking and reasoning about the shift
of mental states. This performance gap highlights fundamental limitations in
current LLMs' ability to model the dynamic nature of human mental states.

Motivation: 当前大型推理模型（LRMs）在短上下文任务中表现优异，但在长上下文输入上的推理能力仍有待提升。研究旨在解决这一关键挑战。

Method: 采用渐进式上下文扩展策略，包括预热监督微调（SFT）、课程引导的分阶段强化学习（RL）和难度感知的回顾采样策略。

Result: 在七个长上下文文档问答基准测试中，QwenLong-L1-32B表现优于OpenAI-o3-mini和Qwen3-235B-A22B，与Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking性能相当。

Conclusion: QwenLong-L1框架为开发实用的长上下文推理模型提供了有效解决方案，推动了信息密集型环境中的稳健推理能力发展。

Abstract: Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning
capabilities through reinforcement learning (RL). These improvements have
primarily been observed within the short-context reasoning tasks. In contrast,
extending LRMs to effectively process and reason on long-context inputs via RL
remains a critical unsolved challenge. To bridge this gap, we first formalize
the paradigm of long-context reasoning RL, and identify key challenges in
suboptimal training efficiency and unstable optimization process. To address
these issues, we propose QwenLong-L1, a framework that adapts short-context
LRMs to long-context scenarios via progressive context scaling. Specifically,
we utilize a warm-up supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage to establish a robust
initial policy, followed by a curriculum-guided phased RL technique to
stabilize the policy evolution, and enhanced with a difficulty-aware
retrospective sampling strategy to incentivize the policy exploration.
Experiments on seven long-context document question-answering benchmarks
demonstrate that QwenLong-L1-32B outperforms flagship LRMs like OpenAI-o3-mini
and Qwen3-235B-A22B, achieving performance on par with
Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, demonstrating leading performance among
state-of-the-art LRMs. This work advances the development of practical
long-context LRMs capable of robust reasoning across information-intensive
environments.

Conclusion: MIDB有效解决了多语言指令数据的质量问题，为多语言LLM的优化提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Despite doubts on data quality, instruction synthesis has been widely applied
into instruction tuning (IT) of LLMs as an economic and rapid alternative.
Recent endeavors focus on improving data quality for synthesized instruction
pairs in English and have facilitated IT of English-centric LLMs. However, data
quality issues in multilingual synthesized instruction pairs are even more
severe, since the common synthesizing practice is to translate English
synthesized data into other languages using machine translation (MT). Besides
the known content errors in these English synthesized data, multilingual
synthesized instruction data are further exposed to defects introduced by MT
and face insufficient localization of the target languages. In this paper, we
propose MIDB, a Multilingual Instruction Data Booster to automatically address
the quality issues in multilingual synthesized data. MIDB is trained on around
36.8k revision examples across 16 languages by human linguistic experts,
thereby can boost the low-quality data by addressing content errors and MT
defects, and improving localization in these synthesized data. Both automatic
and human evaluation indicate that not only MIDB steadily improved instruction
data quality in 16 languages, but also the instruction-following and
cultural-understanding abilities of multilingual LLMs fine-tuned on
MIDB-boosted data were significantly enhanced.

Result: 实验结果表明，BehaviorLM能稳健预测常见和稀有行为，并有效利用LLM知识实现少样本学习。

Conclusion: BehaviorLM通过渐进式微调解决了LLMs在行为预测中的长尾问题，显著提升了稀有行为的预测性能。

Abstract: Predicting user behavior is essential for intelligent assistant services, yet
deep learning models often struggle to capture long-tailed behaviors. Large
language models (LLMs), with their pretraining on vast corpora containing rich
behavioral knowledge, offer promise. However, existing fine-tuning approaches
tend to overfit to frequent ``anchor'' behaviors, reducing their ability to
predict less common ``tail'' behaviors. In this paper, we introduce BehaviorLM,
a progressive fine-tuning approach that addresses this issue. In the first
stage, LLMs are fine-tuned on anchor behaviors while preserving general
behavioral knowledge. In the second stage, fine-tuning uses a balanced subset
of all behaviors based on sample difficulty to improve tail behavior
predictions without sacrificing anchor performance. Experimental results on two
real-world datasets demonstrate that BehaviorLM robustly predicts both anchor
and tail behaviors and effectively leverages LLM behavioral knowledge to master
tail behavior prediction with few-shot examples.

Motivation: LLM在开放任务评估中存在非传递性偏好问题，低质量训练数据加剧了这一问题，需找到解决方案。

Method: 使用图论建模偏好关系，引入结构熵量化非传递性，设计ELSPR策略过滤不一致数据。

Result: 实验显示，过滤后数据显著降低非传递性（13.78%）和结构熵（0.0879），提升与人类评估的一致性。

Conclusion: 通过图论框架和ELSPR策略，有效改善了LLM评估的传递性和一致性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are widely used as evaluators for open-ended
tasks, while previous research has emphasized biases in LLM evaluations, the
issue of non-transitivity in pairwise comparisons remains unresolved:
non-transitive preferences for pairwise comparisons, where evaluators prefer A
over B, B over C, but C over A. Our results suggest that low-quality training
data may reduce the transitivity of preferences generated by the Evaluator LLM.
To address this, We propose a graph-theoretic framework to analyze and mitigate
this problem by modeling pairwise preferences as tournament graphs. We quantify
non-transitivity and introduce directed graph structural entropy to measure the
overall clarity of preferences. Our analysis reveals significant
non-transitivity in advanced Evaluator LLMs (with Qwen2.5-Max exhibiting
67.96%), as well as high entropy values (0.8095 for Qwen2.5-Max), reflecting
low overall clarity of preferences. To address this issue, we designed a
filtering strategy, ELSPR, to eliminate preference data that induces
non-transitivity, retaining only consistent and transitive preference data for
model fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that models fine-tuned with filtered
data reduce non-transitivity by 13.78% (from 64.28% to 50.50%), decrease
structural entropy by 0.0879 (from 0.8113 to 0.7234), and align more closely
with human evaluators (human agreement rate improves by 0.6% and Spearman
correlation increases by 0.01).

Conclusion: 提出了一种无需训练的激活控制技术，显著提升LLM的长链思维能力，同时参数效率优于传统方法。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable reasoning performance, eliciting the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) ability in large language models (LLMs) typically
requires costly reinforcement learning or supervised fine-tuning on
high-quality distilled data. We investigate the internal mechanisms behind this
capability and show that a small set of high-impact activations in the last few
layers largely governs long-form reasoning attributes, such as output length
and self-reflection. By simply amplifying these activations and inserting
"wait" tokens, we can invoke the long CoT ability without any training,
resulting in significantly increased self-reflection rates and accuracy.
Moreover, we find that the activation dynamics follow predictable trajectories,
with a sharp rise after special tokens and a subsequent exponential decay.
Building on these insights, we introduce a general training-free activation
control technique. It leverages a few contrastive examples to identify key
activations, and employs simple analytic functions to modulate their values at
inference time to elicit long CoTs. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of our method in efficiently eliciting long CoT reasoning in LLMs
and improving their performance. Additionally, we propose a parameter-efficient
fine-tuning method that trains only a last-layer activation amplification
module and a few LoRA layers, outperforming full LoRA fine-tuning on reasoning
benchmarks with significantly fewer parameters. Our code and data are publicly
released.

Conclusion: ValueLocate为LLMs的价值观对齐提供了新方法，将心理学框架与神经元分析结合，推动了价值观对齐研究。

Abstract: Rapid integration of large language models (LLMs) into societal applications
has intensified concerns about their alignment with universal ethical
principles, as their internal value representations remain opaque despite
behavioral alignment advancements. Current approaches struggle to
systematically interpret how values are encoded in neural architectures,
limited by datasets that prioritize superficial judgments over mechanistic
analysis. We introduce ValueLocate, a mechanistic interpretability framework
grounded in the Schwartz Values Survey, to address this gap. Our method first
constructs ValueInsight, a dataset that operationalizes four dimensions of
universal value through behavioral contexts in the real world. Leveraging this
dataset, we develop a neuron identification method that calculates activation
differences between opposing value aspects, enabling precise localization of
value-critical neurons without relying on computationally intensive attribution
methods. Our proposed validation method demonstrates that targeted manipulation
of these neurons effectively alters model value orientations, establishing
causal relationships between neurons and value representations. This work
advances the foundation for value alignment by bridging psychological value
frameworks with neuron analysis in LLMs.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在自然语言处理任务中表现优异，但在复杂推理任务中仍需进一步提升效率。

Method: 引入基于课程学习的训练策略，逐步减少思想令牌数量，并通过强化学习微调扩展至标准NTP设置。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上，Fast Quiet-STaR在相同推理时间预算下平均准确率优于Quiet-STaR，NTP版本在Mistral 7B和Qwen2.5 7B上分别提升9%和5.7%。

Conclusion: Fast Quiet-STaR在保持推理效率的同时显著提升了模型性能，为复杂推理任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a
range of natural language processing tasks. However, recent advances
demonstrate that further gains particularly in complex reasoning tasks require
more than merely scaling up model sizes or training data. One promising
direction is to enable models to think during the reasoning process. Recently,
Quiet STaR significantly improves reasoning by generating token-level thought
traces, but incurs substantial inference overhead. In this work, we propose
Fast Quiet STaR, a more efficient reasoning framework that preserves the
benefits of token-level reasoning while reducing computational cost. Our method
introduces a curriculum learning based training strategy that gradually reduces
the number of thought tokens, enabling the model to internalize more abstract
and concise reasoning processes. We further extend this approach to the
standard Next Token Prediction (NTP) setting through reinforcement
learning-based fine-tuning, resulting in Fast Quiet-STaR NTP, which eliminates
the need for explicit thought token generation during inference. Experiments on
four benchmark datasets with Mistral 7B and Qwen2.5 7B demonstrate that Fast
Quiet-STaR consistently outperforms Quiet-STaR in terms of average accuracy
under the same inference time budget. Notably, Fast Quiet-STaR NTP achieves an
average accuracy improvement of 9\% on Mistral 7B and 5.7\% on Qwen2.5 7B,
while maintaining the same inference latency. Our code will be available at

Result: 语言判别能力随训练下降并集中在低层，意义判别能力随训练增强并稳定在深层。

Conclusion: ABX任务为分析多语言表示结构提供了一种轻量级框架。

Abstract: We introduce a set of training-free ABX-style discrimination tasks to
evaluate how multilingual language models represent language identity (form)
and semantic content (meaning). Inspired from speech processing, these
zero-shot tasks measure whether minimal differences in representation can be
reliably detected. This offers a flexible and interpretable alternative to
probing. Applied to XLM-R (Conneau et al, 2020) across pretraining checkpoints
and layers, we find that language discrimination declines over training and
becomes concentrated in lower layers, while meaning discrimination strengthens
over time and stabilizes in deeper layers. We then explore probing tasks,
showing some alignment between our metrics and linguistic learning performance.
Our results position ABX tasks as a lightweight framework for analyzing the
structure of multilingual representations.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval mechanisms have
demonstrated significant potential in fact-checking tasks by integrating
external knowledge. However, their reliability decreases when confronted with
conflicting evidence from sources of varying credibility. This paper presents
the first systematic evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models
for fact-checking in the presence of conflicting evidence. To support this
study, we introduce \textbf{CONFACT} (\textbf{Con}flicting Evidence for
\textbf{Fact}-Checking) (Dataset available at
https://github.com/zoeyyes/CONFACT), a novel dataset comprising questions
paired with conflicting information from various sources. Extensive experiments
reveal critical vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art RAG methods, particularly
in resolving conflicts stemming from differences in media source credibility.
To address these challenges, we investigate strategies to integrate media
background information into both the retrieval and generation stages. Our
results show that effectively incorporating source credibility significantly
enhances the ability of RAG models to resolve conflicting evidence and improve
fact-checking performance.

Method: 提出Agent ROI框架，分析信息质量、代理时间和成本，并规划先提升信息质量再降低时间和成本的开发路径。

Result: 通过优化Agent ROI，可以弥合可用性差距，使LLM代理更具可扩展性和实用性。

Conclusion: 呼吁开发者关注Agent ROI，分阶段优化以实现LLM代理在大众市场的广泛应用。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents represent a promising shift in human-AI
interaction, moving beyond passive prompt-response systems to autonomous agents
capable of reasoning, planning, and goal-directed action. Despite the
widespread application in specialized, high-effort tasks like coding and
scientific research, we highlight a critical usability gap in high-demand,
mass-market applications. This position paper argues that the limited
real-world adoption of LLM agents stems not only from gaps in model
capabilities, but also from a fundamental tradeoff between the value an agent
can provide and the costs incurred during real-world use. Hence, we call for a
shift from solely optimizing model performance to a broader, utility-driven
perspective: evaluating agents through the lens of the overall agentic return
on investment (Agent ROI). By identifying key factors that determine Agentic
ROI--information quality, agent time, and cost--we posit a zigzag development
trajectory in optimizing agentic ROI: first scaling up to improve the
information quality, then scaling down to minimize the time and cost. We
outline the roadmap across different development stages to bridge the current
usability gaps, aiming to make LLM agents truly scalable, accessible, and
effective in real-world contexts.

Result: 改进指标与模型综合能力高度相关（Spearman系数>0.9），显著优于原始压缩指标。

Conclusion: 结合几何失真的压缩指标能更准确地解释语言模型的智能水平。

Abstract: Recently, the concept of ``compression as intelligence'' has provided a novel
informatics metric perspective for language models (LMs), emphasizing that
highly structured representations signify the intelligence level of LMs.
However, from a geometric standpoint, the word representation space of highly
compressed LMs tends to degenerate into a highly anisotropic state, which
hinders the LM's ability to comprehend instructions and directly impacts its
performance. We found this compression-anisotropy synchronicity is essentially
the ``Compression Hacking'' in LM representations, where noise-dominated
directions tend to create the illusion of high compression rates by sacrificing
spatial uniformity. Based on this, we propose three refined compression metrics
by incorporating geometric distortion analysis and integrate them into a
self-evaluation pipeline. The refined metrics exhibit strong alignment with the
LM's comprehensive capabilities, achieving Spearman correlation coefficients
above 0.9, significantly outperforming both the original compression and other
internal structure-based metrics. This confirms that compression hacking
substantially enhances the informatics interpretation of LMs by incorporating
geometric distortion of representations.

Result: 短链比长链准确率高出34.5%，short-m@k方法减少40%计算量和33%时间。

Conclusion: 长推理链未必提升性能，短链更高效且准确，需重新思考LLMs的推理方法。

Abstract: Reasoning large language models (LLMs) heavily rely on scaling test-time
compute to perform complex reasoning tasks by generating extensive "thinking"
chains. While demonstrating impressive results, this approach incurs
significant computational costs and inference time. In this work, we challenge
the assumption that long thinking chains results in better reasoning
capabilities. We first demonstrate that shorter reasoning chains within
individual questions are significantly more likely to yield correct answers -
up to 34.5% more accurate than the longest chain sampled for the same question.
Based on these results, we suggest short-m@k, a novel reasoning LLM inference
method. Our method executes k independent generations in parallel and halts
computation once the first m thinking processes are done. The final answer is
chosen using majority voting among these m chains. Basic short-1@k demonstrates
similar or even superior performance over standard majority voting in
low-compute settings - using up to 40% fewer thinking tokens. short-3@k, while
slightly less efficient than short-1@k, consistently surpasses majority voting
across all compute budgets, while still being substantially faster (up to 33%
wall time reduction). Inspired by our results, we finetune an LLM using short,
long, and randomly selected reasoning chains. We then observe that training on
the shorter ones leads to better performance. Our findings suggest rethinking
current methods of test-time compute in reasoning LLMs, emphasizing that longer
"thinking" does not necessarily translate to improved performance and can,
counter-intuitively, lead to degraded results.

Motivation: 香港居民主要使用粤语口语，但书面语为标准中文，两者存在显著差异。网络交流的增加催生了中文与粤语之间的自动翻译需求。

Method: 采用Transformer模型，通过收集28K平行句对和自动从维基百科中挖掘72K相似句对，构建训练数据。

Result: 系统在8个测试集中的6个上BLEU得分优于百度翻译，并能捕捉中文与粤语间的关键语言转换。

Conclusion: 通过有效数据准备和模型优化，该系统在中文到粤语翻译任务中表现出色。

Abstract: The majority of inhabitants in Hong Kong are able to read and write in
standard Chinese but use Cantonese as the primary spoken language in daily
life. Spoken Cantonese can be transcribed into Chinese characters, which
constitute the so-called written Cantonese. Written Cantonese exhibits
significant lexical and grammatical differences from standard written Chinese.
The rise of written Cantonese is increasingly evident in the cyber world. The
growing interaction between Mandarin speakers and Cantonese speakers is leading
to a clear demand for automatic translation between Chinese and Cantonese. This
paper describes a transformer-based neural machine translation (NMT) system for
written-Chinese-to-written-Cantonese translation. Given that parallel text data
of Chinese and Cantonese are extremely scarce, a major focus of this study is
on the effort of preparing good amount of training data for NMT. In addition to
collecting 28K parallel sentences from previous linguistic studies and
scattered internet resources, we devise an effective approach to obtaining 72K
parallel sentences by automatically extracting pairs of semantically similar
sentences from parallel articles on Chinese Wikipedia and Cantonese Wikipedia.
We show that leveraging highly similar sentence pairs mined from Wikipedia
improves translation performance in all test sets. Our system outperforms Baidu
Fanyi's Chinese-to-Cantonese translation on 6 out of 8 test sets in BLEU
scores. Translation examples reveal that our system is able to capture
important linguistic transformations between standard Chinese and spoken
Cantonese.

Motivation: 现代推理模型存在推理延迟高、计算资源消耗大以及过度思考（生成冗余令牌）的问题。

Method: 采用条件令牌选择（CTS）框架，通过条件重要性评分评估令牌贡献，并训练模型使用压缩后的思维链（CoT）。

Result: 在GPQA基准测试中，CTS显著减少了推理令牌数量（最多减少75.8%），同时保持了较高的准确性（仅5%的精度下降）。

Conclusion: CTS证明了现有思维链中存在大量冗余，通过压缩可以显著提升推理效率。

Abstract: Modern reasoning models, such as OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek-R1, exhibit
impressive problem-solving capabilities but suffer from critical
inefficiencies: high inference latency, excessive computational resource
consumption, and a tendency toward overthinking -- generating verbose chains of
thought (CoT) laden with redundant tokens that contribute minimally to the
final answer. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Token Selection
(CTS), a token-level compression framework with a flexible and variable
compression ratio that identifies and preserves only the most essential tokens
in CoT. CTS evaluates each token's contribution to deriving correct answers
using conditional importance scoring, then trains models on compressed CoT.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CTS effectively compresses long CoT
while maintaining strong reasoning performance. Notably, on the GPQA benchmark,
Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct trained with CTS achieves a 9.1% accuracy improvement with
13.2% fewer reasoning tokens (13% training token reduction). Further reducing
training tokens by 42% incurs only a marginal 5% accuracy drop while yielding a
75.8% reduction in reasoning tokens, highlighting the prevalence of redundancy

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SRCA的框架，通过引入检查点和两种策略，解决了现有TTS方法在数学推理中的路径同质化和中间结果利用不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的TTS方法（如Beam Search和DVTS）虽然能通过增加计算资源提升推理准确性，但存在路径同质化和中间结果利用效率低的问题。

Method: SRCA框架在推理步骤间引入检查点，采用两种策略：(1) 答案聚类搜索，按中间答案分组路径以保持多样性；(2) 检查点候选增强，利用所有中间答案进行最终决策。

Result: 实验表明，SRCA在多个数学数据集上比现有TTS方法提高了推理准确性。

Conclusion: SRCA通过优化路径多样性和中间结果利用，显著提升了数学推理的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a
powerful capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which can be further
enhanced through Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods like Beam Search and DVTS.
However, these methods, despite improving accuracy by allocating more
computational resources during inference, often suffer from path homogenization
and inefficient use of intermediate results. To address these limitations, we
propose Stepwise Reasoning Checkpoint Analysis (SRCA), a framework that
introduces checkpoints between reasoning steps. It incorporates two key
strategies: (1) Answer-Clustered Search, which groups reasoning paths by their
intermediate checkpoint answers to maintain diversity while ensuring quality,
and (2) Checkpoint Candidate Augmentation, which leverages all intermediate
answers for final decision-making. Our approach effectively reduces path
homogenization and creates a fault-tolerant mechanism by utilizing high-quality
intermediate results. Experimental results show that SRCA improves reasoning
accuracy compared to existing TTS methods across various mathematical datasets.

*Giacomo Magnifico,Eduard Barbu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究旨在通过从生物技术和生物物理学领域的科学文献中提取解释性句子，构建一个公开可用的大规模数据集，并提供多类标注，以填补机器学习解释领域的数据空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏大规模、人类生成且类似人类的解释数据集，这对机器学习决策的解释研究至关重要。

Method: 从PubMed的PMC开放获取子集等来源提取解释性句子，进行多类标注，并评估标注者一致性。

Result: 构建了一个公开数据集，包含6类和3类标注，其中3类标注的Krippendorf Alpha值为0.667。

Conclusion: 该数据集为机器学习解释研究提供了重要资源，并展示了标注的一致性。

Abstract: Clear and effective explanations are essential for human understanding and
knowledge dissemination. The scope of scientific research aiming to understand
the essence of explanations has recently expanded from the social sciences to
machine learning and artificial intelligence. Explanations for machine learning
decisions must be impactful and human-like, and there is a lack of large-scale
datasets focusing on human-like and human-generated explanations. This work
aims to provide such a dataset by: extracting sentences that indicate
explanations from scientific literature among various sources in the
biotechnology and biophysics topic domains (e.g. PubMed's PMC Open Access
subset); providing a multi-class notation derived inductively from the data;
evaluating annotator consensus on the emerging categories. The sentences are
organized in an openly-available dataset, with two different classifications
(6-class and 3-class category annotation), and the 3-class notation achieves a
0.667 Krippendorf Alpha value.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个芬兰语自发情感语音语料库的创建，通过结合声学、跨语言情感和文本情感特征的挖掘方法，标注了12,000个语句的情感唤醒和效价，并比较了随机采样与情感挖掘方法的多样性。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏芬兰语自发情感表达的数据，现有数据多为表演或特定场景，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用情感挖掘方法结合声学、跨语言情感和文本情感特征，从三个大规模芬兰语语音语料库中采样并标注12,000个语句。

Result: 创建了首个芬兰语自发情感语音语料库，并验证了情感挖掘方法在多样性上的优势。

Conclusion: 该研究不仅提供了芬兰语情感语音资源，还为其他语言或领域的情感语料库构建提供了采样策略参考。

Abstract: Study of affect in speech requires suitable data, as emotional expression and
perception vary across languages. Until now, no corpus has existed for natural
expression of affect in spontaneous Finnish, existing data being acted or from
a very specific communicative setting. This paper presents the first such
corpus, created by annotating 12,000 utterances for emotional arousal and
valence, sampled from three large-scale Finnish speech corpora. To ensure
diverse affective expression, sample selection was conducted with an affect
mining approach combining acoustic, cross-linguistic speech emotion, and text
sentiment features. We compare this method to random sampling in terms of
annotation diversity, and conduct post-hoc analyses to identify sampling
choices that would have maximized the diversity. As an outcome, the work
introduces a spontaneous Finnish affective speech corpus and informs sampling
strategies for affective speech corpus creation in other languages or domains.

*Jingyi Sun,Greta Warren,Irina Shklovski,Isabelle Augenstein*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CLUE框架通过无监督方式识别文本间的冲突与一致性，生成自然语言解释模型的不确定性，提升人类与AI协作的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如数值不确定性或模糊表达）无法解释证据冲突导致的不确定性，用户难以依赖输出或解决分歧。

Method: CLUE通过识别文本间的冲突与一致性关系，并利用提示和注意力引导生成解释。

Result: 在三个语言模型和两个事实核查数据集上，CLUE生成的解释更忠实于模型的不确定性，且人类评价更高。

Conclusion: CLUE无需微调即可应用于任何白盒语言模型，为事实核查等任务提供实用支持。

Abstract: Understanding sources of a model's uncertainty regarding its predictions is
crucial for effective human-AI collaboration. Prior work proposes using
numerical uncertainty or hedges ("I'm not sure, but ..."), which do not explain
uncertainty that arises from conflicting evidence, leaving users unable to
resolve disagreements or rely on the output. We introduce CLUE
(Conflict-and-Agreement-aware Language-model Uncertainty Explanations), the
first framework to generate natural language explanations of model uncertainty
by (i) identifying relationships between spans of text that expose
claim-evidence or inter-evidence conflicts and agreements that drive the
model's predictive uncertainty in an unsupervised way, and (ii) generating
explanations via prompting and attention steering that verbalize these critical
interactions. Across three language models and two fact-checking datasets, we
show that CLUE produces explanations that are more faithful to the model's
uncertainty and more consistent with fact-checking decisions than prompting for
uncertainty explanations without span-interaction guidance. Human evaluators
judge our explanations to be more helpful, more informative, less redundant,
and more logically consistent with the input than this baseline. CLUE requires
no fine-tuning or architectural changes, making it plug-and-play for any
white-box language model. By explicitly linking uncertainty to evidence
conflicts, it offers practical support for fact-checking and generalises
readily to other tasks that require reasoning over complex information.

TL;DR: 论文提出一种类似生物免疫的方法，通过微调AI模型于少量标记的虚假信息上，以增强其识别和拒绝误导性信息的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI模型常从训练数据中学习并复制虚假信息，需要一种方法减少其生成错误内容。

Method: 在微调阶段定期注入标记的虚假信息，作为“疫苗”训练模型。

Result: 实验表明，免疫化模型生成的虚假信息显著少于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为提升AI事实性提供了一种主动范式，并提出了伦理保障措施。

Abstract: Generative AI models often learn and reproduce false information present in
their training corpora. This position paper argues that, analogous to
biological immunization, where controlled exposure to a weakened pathogen
builds immunity, AI models should be fine tuned on small, quarantined sets of
explicitly labeled falsehoods as a "vaccine" against misinformation. These
curated false examples are periodically injected during finetuning,
strengthening the model ability to recognize and reject misleading claims while
preserving accuracy on truthful inputs. An illustrative case study shows that
immunized models generate substantially less misinformation than baselines. To
our knowledge, this is the first training framework that treats fact checked
falsehoods themselves as a supervised vaccine, rather than relying on input
perturbations or generic human feedback signals, to harden models against
future misinformation. We also outline ethical safeguards and governance
controls to ensure the safe use of false data. Model immunization offers a
proactive paradigm for aligning AI systems with factuality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自然科学研究中湿实验成本高、通量低的问题，传统方法仅依赖语言模型内部推理，未结合实验结果。

Method: 提出基于领域假设的模拟器，通过假设与真实假设的相似性和噪声建模，开发伪实验引导的排序方法。

Result: 在124个化学假设数据集上验证，新方法优于预实验基线和强消融实验。

Conclusion: 实验引导的排序方法能有效优化假设优先级，为自动化科学发现提供新思路。

Abstract: Hypothesis ranking is a crucial component of automated scientific discovery,
particularly in natural sciences where wet-lab experiments are costly and
throughput-limited. Existing approaches focus on pre-experiment ranking,
relying solely on large language model's internal reasoning without
incorporating empirical outcomes from experiments. We introduce the task of
experiment-guided ranking, which aims to prioritize candidate hypotheses based
on the results of previously tested ones. However, developing such strategies
is challenging due to the impracticality of repeatedly conducting real
experiments in natural science domains. To address this, we propose a simulator
grounded in three domain-informed assumptions, modeling hypothesis performance
as a function of similarity to a known ground truth hypothesis, perturbed by
noise. We curate a dataset of 124 chemistry hypotheses with experimentally
reported outcomes to validate the simulator. Building on this simulator, we
develop a pseudo experiment-guided ranking method that clusters hypotheses by
shared functional characteristics and prioritizes candidates based on insights
derived from simulated experimental feedback. Experiments show that our method
outperforms pre-experiment baselines and strong ablations.

TL;DR: Mutarjim是一个紧凑而强大的阿拉伯语-英语双向翻译模型，基于Kuwain-1.5B开发，通过优化的两阶段训练和高质量语料库，性能超越更大模型。同时，引入Tarjama-25新基准，解决了现有数据集的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型在机器翻译任务中表现优异，但小型模型在计算成本和训练需求上更具优势，因此开发了Mutarjim。

Method: 基于Kuwain-1.5B，采用优化的两阶段训练方法和高质量训练语料库。

Result: Mutarjim在多个基准测试中超越更大模型，并在Tarjama-25上达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Mutarjim展示了小型模型在翻译任务中的潜力，Tarjama-25为未来研究提供了更全面的评估框架。

Abstract: We introduce Mutarjim, a compact yet powerful language model for
bidirectional Arabic-English translation. While large-scale LLMs have shown
impressive progress in natural language processing tasks, including machine
translation, smaller models. Leveraging this insight, we developed Mutarjim
based on Kuwain-1.5B , a language model tailored for both Arabic and English.
Despite its modest size, Mutarjim outperforms much larger models on several
established benchmarks, achieved through an optimized two-phase training
approach and a carefully curated, high-quality training corpus.. Experimental
results show that Mutarjim rivals models up to 20 times larger while
significantly reducing computational costs and training requirements. We also
introduce Tarjama-25, a new benchmark designed to overcome limitations in
existing Arabic-English benchmarking datasets, such as domain narrowness, short
sentence lengths, and English-source bias. Tarjama-25 comprises 5,000
expert-reviewed sentence pairs and spans a wide range of domains, offering a
more comprehensive and balanced evaluation framework. Notably, Mutarjim
achieves state-of-the-art performance on the English-to-Arabic task in
Tarjama-25, surpassing even significantly larger and proprietary models like
GPT-4o mini. We publicly release Tarjama-25 to support future research and
advance the evaluation of Arabic-English translation systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型是否能在无思维链的情况下完成多跳推理任务。

Method: 使用GPT2风格模型在可控的多跳推理数据集上训练，分析数据需求和模型深度。

Result: 模型能学习隐式多跳推理，但数据需求指数增长，层数线性增长。课程学习可缓解数据需求。

Conclusion: 隐式推理可行，但需更多数据和更深模型，课程学习是部分解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit reasoning is the ability of a language model to solve multi-hop
reasoning tasks in a single forward pass, without chain of thought. We
investigate this capability using GPT2-style language models trained from
scratch on controlled $k$-hop reasoning datasets ($k = 2, 3, 4$). We show that
while such models can indeed learn implicit $k$-hop reasoning, the required
training data grows exponentially in $k$, and the required number of
transformer layers grows linearly in $k$. We offer a theoretical explanation
for why this depth growth is necessary. We further find that the data
requirement can be mitigated, but not eliminated, through curriculum learning.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了NLP嵌入模型在处理科学相关符号表达式时的差异，发现GPT-text-embedding-3-large表现最佳，但优势有限，并强调了模型选择的其他关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学相关语言中的符号表达式（如公式）对现有NLP嵌入模型提出挑战，但现有研究常忽略或移除这些表达式，可能导致偏见和性能下降。

Method: 评估多种嵌入模型对物理符号表达式的处理能力，采用相似性分析和机器学习管道集成两种方法。

Result: GPT-text-embedding-3-large表现最佳，但优势不显著；成本、合规性和透明度也是选择模型的关键因素。

Conclusion: LA研究者和实践者在处理含符号表达式的科学语言时，需谨慎选择NLP嵌入模型。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have facilitated the
analysis of student-generated language products in learning analytics (LA),
particularly through the use of NLP embedding models. Yet when it comes to
science-related language, symbolic expressions such as equations and formulas
introduce challenges that current embedding models struggle to address.
Existing studies and applications often either overlook these challenges or
remove symbolic expressions altogether, potentially leading to biased findings
and diminished performance of LA applications. This study therefore explores
how contemporary embedding models differ in their capability to process and
interpret science-related symbolic expressions. To this end, various embedding
models are evaluated using physics-specific symbolic expressions drawn from
authentic student responses, with performance assessed via two approaches:
similarity-based analyses and integration into a machine learning pipeline. Our
findings reveal significant differences in model performance, with OpenAI's
GPT-text-embedding-3-large outperforming all other examined models, though its
advantage over other models was moderate rather than decisive. Beyond
performance, additional factors such as cost, regulatory compliance, and model
transparency are discussed as key considerations for model selection. Overall,
this study underscores the importance for LA researchers and practitioners of
carefully selecting NLP embedding models when working with science-related
language products that include symbolic expressions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂任务（如临床应用）中的性能和可解释性，同时避免依赖昂贵的监督微调或闭源模型数据。

Method: 使用基于规则的强化学习（RL）在公开的多选题问答数据集上训练AlphaMed，无需SFT或CoT数据。

Result: AlphaMed在六个医学问答基准测试中表现最优，甚至超越更大或闭源模型。

Conclusion: 数据集的信息量是推理性能的关键驱动因素，基于规则的RL在信息丰富的多选题数据上有效，但需更具挑战性的基准测试。

Abstract: Improving performance on complex tasks and enabling interpretable decision
making in large language models (LLMs), especially for clinical applications,
requires effective reasoning. Yet this remains challenging without supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on costly chain-of-thought (CoT) data distilled from
closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o). In this work, we present AlphaMed, the
first medical LLM to show that reasoning capability can emerge purely through
reinforcement learning (RL), using minimalist rule-based rewards on public
multiple-choice QA datasets, without relying on SFT or distilled CoT data.
AlphaMed achieves state-of-the-art results on six medical QA benchmarks,
outperforming models trained with conventional SFT+RL pipelines. On challenging
benchmarks (e.g., MedXpert), AlphaMed even surpasses larger or closed-source
models such as DeepSeek-V3-671B and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. To understand the
factors behind this success, we conduct a comprehensive data-centric analysis
guided by three questions: (i) Can minimalist rule-based RL incentivize
reasoning without distilled CoT supervision? (ii) How do dataset quantity and
diversity impact reasoning? (iii) How does question difficulty shape the
emergence and generalization of reasoning? Our findings show that dataset
informativeness is a key driver of reasoning performance, and that minimalist
RL on informative, multiple-choice QA data is effective at inducing reasoning
without CoT supervision. We also observe divergent trends across benchmarks,
underscoring limitations in current evaluation and the need for more
challenging, reasoning-oriented medical QA benchmarks.

Conclusion: AI虽无法独立解决CEEF问题，但在明确策略和指导下能有效辅助，为AI在数学领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite recent progress, AI still struggles on advanced mathematics. We
consider a difficult open problem: How to derive a Computationally Efficient
Equivalent Form (CEEF) for the cycle count statistic? The CEEF problem does not
have known general solutions, and requires delicate combinatorics and tedious
calculations. Such a task is hard to accomplish by humans but is an ideal
example where AI can be very helpful. We solve the problem by combining a novel
approach we propose and the powerful coding skills of AI. Our results use
delicate graph theory and contain new formulas for general cases that have not
been discovered before. We find that, while AI is unable to solve the problem
all by itself, it is able to solve it if we provide it with a clear strategy, a
step-by-step guidance and carefully written prompts. For simplicity, we focus
our study on DeepSeek-R1 but we also investigate other AI approaches.

Method: 通过声明规范化、时间约束证据标注和两阶段充分性检查，构建AVerImaTeC数据集，并进行标注一致性评估。

Result: 标注一致性较高（κ=0.742），并提出新的证据检索评估方法，建立了基于开放网络证据的基线。

Conclusion: AVerImaTeC为图文声明验证提供了高质量的数据集和方法，有助于减少虚假信息的传播。

Abstract: Textual claims are often accompanied by images to enhance their credibility
and spread on social media, but this also raises concerns about the spread of
misinformation. Existing datasets for automated verification of image-text
claims remain limited, as they often consist of synthetic claims and lack
evidence annotations to capture the reasoning behind the verdict. In this work,
we introduce AVerImaTeC, a dataset consisting of 1,297 real-world image-text
claims. Each claim is annotated with question-answer (QA) pairs containing
evidence from the web, reflecting a decomposed reasoning regarding the verdict.
We mitigate common challenges in fact-checking datasets such as contextual
dependence, temporal leakage, and evidence insufficiency, via claim
normalization, temporally constrained evidence annotation, and a two-stage
sufficiency check. We assess the consistency of the annotation in AVerImaTeC
via inter-annotator studies, achieving a $\kappa=0.742$ on verdicts and
$74.7\%$ consistency on QA pairs. We also propose a novel evaluation method for
evidence retrieval and conduct extensive experiments to establish baselines for
verifying image-text claims using open-web evidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer模型在训练中从记忆到抽象的转变机制，填补现有研究对语言结构涌现的忽视。

Method: 引入TRACE框架和ABSynth数据生成方法，通过几何、信息和语言信号分析阶段转变。

Result: 实验发现阶段转变与曲率崩溃和维度稳定相关，且与句法和语义准确性同步；抽象模式在不同架构中一致。

Conclusion: TRACE框架深化了对语言抽象涌现的理解，为模型可解释性、训练效率和组合泛化提供了新视角。

Abstract: Modern transformer models exhibit phase transitions during training, distinct
shifts from memorisation to abstraction, but the mechanisms underlying these
transitions remain poorly understood. Prior work has often focused on endpoint
representations or isolated signals like curvature or mutual information,
typically in symbolic or arithmetic domains, overlooking the emergence of
linguistic structure. We introduce TRACE (Tracking Representation Abstraction
and Compositional Emergence), a diagnostic framework combining geometric,
informational, and linguistic signals to detect phase transitions in
Transformer-based LMs. TRACE leverages a frame-semantic data generation method,
ABSynth, that produces annotated synthetic corpora with controllable
complexity, lexical distributions, and structural entropy, while being fully
annotated with linguistic categories, enabling precise analysis of abstraction
emergence. Experiments reveal that (i) phase transitions align with clear
intersections between curvature collapse and dimension stabilisation; (ii)
these geometric shifts coincide with emerging syntactic and semantic accuracy;
(iii) abstraction patterns persist across architectural variants, with
components like feedforward networks affecting optimisation stability rather
than fundamentally altering trajectories. This work advances our understanding
of how linguistic abstractions emerge in LMs, offering insights into model
interpretability, training efficiency, and compositional generalisation that
could inform more principled approaches to LM development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在遵循简单指令时仍有困难，尤其是涉及组合任务时。伪代码可能帮助模型更好地理解指令，但编写伪代码对非专家用户不友好。

Method: 微调LLMs时，在指令调优数据中加入伪代码表达的指令及最终响应。

Result: 在11个公开基准测试中，模型在指令遵循任务上提升3-19%，数学和常识推理任务上平均提升14%。

Conclusion: 伪代码辅助的微调能显著提升LLMs的指令遵循能力，同时不影响其他任务表现。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress in the capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs), they continue to have difficulty following relatively simple,
unambiguous instructions, especially when compositions are involved. In this
paper, we take inspiration from recent work that suggests that models may
follow instructions better when they are expressed in pseudo-code. However,
writing pseudo-code programs can be tedious and using few-shot demonstrations
to craft code representations for use in inference can be unnatural for
non-expert users of LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose fine-tuning
LLMs with instruction-tuning data that additionally includes instructions
re-expressed in pseudo-code along with the final response. We evaluate models
trained using our method on $11$ publicly available benchmarks comprising of
tasks related to instruction-following, mathematics, and common-sense
reasoning. We conduct rigorous experiments with $5$ different models and find
that not only do models follow instructions better when trained with
pseudo-code, they also retain their capabilities on the other tasks related to
mathematical and common sense reasoning. Specifically, we observe a relative
gain of $3$--$19$% on instruction-following benchmark, and an average gain of
upto 14% across all tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种对比蒸馏框架，将大型语言模型（如GPT-4）的情感知识转移到紧凑模型中，无需人工标注，实现零样本情感识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情感识别模型依赖固定标签集训练，泛化能力有限；大型语言模型虽表现优异，但因规模过大难以在边缘设备部署。

Method: 使用GPT-4生成情感描述作为监督信号，通过对比学习在共享嵌入空间中对齐文本和情感描述。

Result: 蒸馏模型在多个数据集和标签空间上表现优异，接近GPT-4的零样本性能，且体积缩小超10,000倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建高效、可扩展的情感识别系统提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability to handle various emotion labels without dedicated training is
crucial for building adaptable Emotion Recognition (ER) systems. Conventional
ER models rely on training using fixed label sets and struggle to generalize
beyond them. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong
zero-shot ER performance across diverse label spaces, but their scale limits
their use on edge devices. In this work, we propose a contrastive distillation
framework that transfers rich emotional knowledge from LLMs into a compact
model without the use of human annotations. We use GPT-4 to generate
descriptive emotion annotations, offering rich supervision beyond fixed label
sets. By aligning text samples with emotion descriptors in a shared embedding
space, our method enables zero-shot prediction on different emotion classes,
granularity, and label schema. The distilled model is effective across multiple
datasets and label spaces, outperforming strong baselines of similar size and
approaching GPT-4's zero-shot performance, while being over 10,000 times
smaller.

errors in math problem-solving. Several studies have investigated the
applications of large language models (LLMs) in educational contexts. In this
paper, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to assess students' math
problem-solving processes and provide adaptive feedback. The MathEDU dataset is
introduced, comprising authentic student solutions annotated with teacher
feedback. We evaluate the model's ability to support personalized learning in
two scenarios: one where the model has access to students' prior answer
histories, and another simulating a cold-start context. Experimental results
show that the fine-tuned model performs well in identifying correctness.
However, the model still faces challenges in generating detailed feedback for
pedagogical purposes.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLMs在归纳推理中的表现，提出了一种名为AlignXplore的模型，通过结合合成数据和在线强化学习，显著提升了偏好推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在归纳推理（如从分散信号中推断用户偏好）方面表现不足，而个性化偏好推理是LLM对齐的关键挑战。

Method: 提出AlignXplore模型，结合冷启动训练（基于合成数据）和在线强化学习，系统地从用户交互历史中推断偏好。

Result: AlignXplore在领域内外基准测试中平均提升11.05%，并展现出跨输入格式和下游模型的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究为偏好推理学习提供了最佳实践，并揭示了训练过程中类人归纳推理模式的出现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant success in complex
reasoning tasks such as math and coding. In contrast to these tasks where
deductive reasoning predominates, inductive reasoning\textemdash the ability to
derive general rules from incomplete evidence, remains underexplored. This
paper investigates extended inductive reasoning in LLMs through the lens of
personalized preference inference, a critical challenge in LLM alignment where
current approaches struggle to capture diverse user preferences. The task
demands strong inductive reasoning capabilities as user preferences are
typically embedded implicitly across various interaction forms, requiring
models to synthesize consistent preference patterns from scattered signals. We
propose \textsc{AlignXplore}, a model that leverages extended reasoning chains
to enable systematic preference inference from behavioral signals in users'
interaction histories. We develop \textsc{AlignXplore} by combining cold-start
training based on synthetic data with subsequent online reinforcement learning.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that \textsc{AlignXplore}
achieves substantial improvements over the backbone model by an average of
11.05\% on in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, while maintaining strong
generalization ability across different input formats and downstream models.
Further analyses establish best practices for preference inference learning
through systematic comparison of reward modeling strategies, while revealing
the emergence of human-like inductive reasoning patterns during training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长序列处理中预填充阶段的高计算开销和LLM在长上下文中的性能下降问题。

Method: 采用自然语言引导的动态优化、双向推理层、令牌批判机制和窗口并行推理等创新技术。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于其他方法，支持多种主流LLM，并实现显著的上下文压缩和性能提升。

Conclusion: QwenLong-CPRS在长上下文处理中表现出色，为LLM提供了高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: This technical report presents QwenLong-CPRS, a context compression framework
designed for explicit long-context optimization, addressing prohibitive
computation overhead during the prefill stage and the "lost in the middle"
performance degradation of large language models (LLMs) during long sequence
processing. Implemented through a novel dynamic context optimization mechanism,
QwenLong-CPRS enables multi-granularity context compression guided by natural
language instructions, achieving both efficiency gains and improved
performance.
  Evolved from the Qwen architecture series, QwenLong-CPRS introduces four key
innovations: (1) Natural language-guided dynamic optimization, (2)
Bidirectional reasoning layers for enhanced boundary awareness, (3) Token
critic mechanisms with language modeling heads, and (4) Window-parallel
inference.
  Comprehensive evaluations across five benchmarks (4K-2M word contexts)
demonstrate QwenLong-CPRS's threefold effectiveness: (1) Consistent superiority
over other context management methods like RAG and sparse attention in both
accuracy and efficiency. (2) Architecture-agnostic integration with all
flagship LLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini2.0-pro, Claude3.7-sonnet, DeepSeek-v3,
and Qwen2.5-max, achieves 21.59$\times$ context compression alongside
19.15-point average performance gains; (3) Deployed with Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
QwenLong-CPRS surpasses leading proprietary LLMs by 4.85 and 10.88 points on
Ruler-128K and InfiniteBench, establishing new SOTA performance.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于目标条件价值函数的方法，用于指导大型语言模型（LLM）在多轮交互任务中的推理和规划，解决了强化学习（RL）微调在可扩展性和计算成本上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在问答和对话任务中表现优异，但在需要多轮交互的复杂任务（如谈判和说服）中，缺乏有效的长时程推理和规划能力。RL微调虽理论上可行，但存在计算成本高、API限制等问题。

Method: 提出了一种轻量级的目标条件价值函数方法，通过预测任务的可能结果来指导LLM的推理，并在多轮交互中优化决策。

Result: 在工具使用、社交推理和对话等任务中，该方法优于RL微调和提示方法，同时保持了高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM在多轮交互任务中的推理和规划提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks like question answering and
dialogue, but complex tasks requiring interaction, such as negotiation and
persuasion, require additional long-horizon reasoning and planning.
Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle,
but suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn
RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated
when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the
APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to
improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather
than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses
goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that
scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task
will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple
possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In
addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than
full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates
decision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks
requiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue,
demonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting
methods while maintaining efficiency and scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于网络的LLMs在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但其能力主要局限于架构不透明的专有系统中，因此需要一种透明、可扩展的解决方案。

Method: ManuSearch通过三个智能体协作实现深度搜索：解决方案规划智能体、互联网搜索智能体和结构化网页阅读智能体。

Result: 实验结果表明，ManuSearch显著优于现有开源基线，甚至超过领先的闭源系统。

Conclusion: ManuSearch为开放深度搜索系统的可复现和可扩展研究铺平了道路，相关数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in web-augmented large language models (LLMs) have exhibited
strong performance in complex reasoning tasks, yet these capabilities are
mostly locked in proprietary systems with opaque architectures. In this work,
we propose \textbf{ManuSearch}, a transparent and modular multi-agent framework
designed to democratize deep search for LLMs. ManuSearch decomposes the search
and reasoning process into three collaborative agents: (1) a solution planning
agent that iteratively formulates sub-queries, (2) an Internet search agent
that retrieves relevant documents via real-time web search, and (3) a
structured webpage reading agent that extracts key evidence from raw web
content. To rigorously evaluate deep reasoning abilities, we introduce
\textbf{ORION}, a challenging benchmark focused on open-web reasoning over
long-tail entities, covering both English and Chinese. Experimental results
show that ManuSearch substantially outperforms prior open-source baselines and
even surpasses leading closed-source systems. Our work paves the way for
reproducible, extensible research in open deep search systems. We release the
data and code in https://github.com/RUCAIBox/ManuSearch

TL;DR: TriSense是一个三模态大语言模型，通过整合视觉、音频和语音模态，实现全面的视频时间理解。其核心是Query-Based Connector，能自适应调整模态贡献。TriSense-2M数据集支持其多模态能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在融合和解释音频信息方面表现不佳，限制了视频时间理解的全面性。

Method: 提出TriSense模型，采用Query-Based Connector动态调整模态权重，并引入TriSense-2M数据集。

Result: 实验证明TriSense在多模态视频分析中表现优异。

Conclusion: TriSense为多模态视频分析提供了有效解决方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Humans naturally understand moments in a video by integrating visual and
auditory cues. For example, localizing a scene in the video like "A scientist
passionately speaks on wildlife conservation as dramatic orchestral music
plays, with the audience nodding and applauding" requires simultaneous
processing of visual, audio, and speech signals. However, existing models often
struggle to effectively fuse and interpret audio information, limiting their
capacity for comprehensive video temporal understanding. To address this, we
present TriSense, a triple-modality large language model designed for holistic
video temporal understanding through the integration of visual, audio, and
speech modalities. Central to TriSense is a Query-Based Connector that
adaptively reweights modality contributions based on the input query, enabling
robust performance under modality dropout and allowing flexible combinations of
available inputs. To support TriSense's multimodal capabilities, we introduce
TriSense-2M, a high-quality dataset of over 2 million curated samples generated
via an automated pipeline powered by fine-tuned LLMs. TriSense-2M includes
long-form videos and diverse modality combinations, facilitating broad
generalization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate
the effectiveness of TriSense and its potential to advance multimodal video
analysis. Code and dataset will be publicly released.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: UNJOIN是一个两阶段框架，通过解耦模式元素检索和SQL逻辑生成，提高多表数据库Text-to-SQL性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多表数据库中复杂模式和关系操作导致的性能挑战。

Method: 第一阶段合并所有表的列名，简化模式；第二阶段生成SQL并映射回原始模式。

Result: 在SPIDER和BIRD数据集上表现优于或匹配现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: UNJOIN无需数据访问或微调，具有可扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have greatly improved
Text-to-SQL performance for single-table queries. But, it remains challenging
in multi-table databases due to complex schema and relational operations.
Existing methods often struggle with retrieving the right tables and columns,
generating accurate JOINs and UNIONs, and generalizing across diverse schemas.
To address these issues, we introduce UNJOIN, a two-stage framework that
decouples the retrieval of schema elements from SQL logic generation. In the
first stage, we merge the column names of all tables in the database into a
single-table representation by prefixing each column with its table name. This
allows the model to focus purely on accurate retrieval without being distracted
by the need to write complex SQL logic. In the second stage, the SQL query is
generated on this simplified schema and mapped back to the original schema by
reconstructing JOINs, UNIONs, and relational logic. Evaluations on SPIDER and
BIRD datasets show that UNJOIN matches or exceeds the state-of-the-art
baselines. UNJOIN uses only schema information, which does not require data
access or fine-tuning, making it scalable and adaptable across databases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索在极端约束下（高比例复制人类文本）生成可控且连贯的叙事，挑战AI生成与检测的边界。

Method: 模型通过选择和组合人类文本片段生成初稿，随后迭代修订以保持指定复制比例。

Result: 81%的Frankentexts连贯且符合提示，59%被误判为人类写作，但人类可通过语气和语法不一致识别。

Conclusion: Frankentexts不仅挑战生成任务，还为混合作者检测和人类-AI协作写作研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce Frankentexts, a new type of long-form narratives produced by
LLMs under the extreme constraint that most tokens (e.g., 90%) must be copied
verbatim from human writings. This task presents a challenging test of
controllable generation, requiring models to satisfy a writing prompt,
integrate disparate text fragments, and still produce a coherent narrative. To
generate Frankentexts, we instruct the model to produce a draft by selecting
and combining human-written passages, then iteratively revise the draft while
maintaining a user-specified copy ratio. We evaluate the resulting Frankentexts
along three axes: writing quality, instruction adherence, and detectability.
Gemini-2.5-Pro performs surprisingly well on this task: 81% of its Frankentexts
are coherent and 100% relevant to the prompt. Notably, up to 59% of these
outputs are misclassified as human-written by detectors like Pangram, revealing
limitations in AI text detectors. Human annotators can sometimes identify
Frankentexts through their abrupt tone shifts and inconsistent grammar between
segments, especially in longer generations. Beyond presenting a challenging
generation task, Frankentexts invite discussion on building effective detectors
for this new grey zone of authorship, provide training data for mixed
authorship detection, and serve as a sandbox for studying human-AI co-writing
processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Wikidata作为大型开源知识库，内容复杂且多语言，需要高效的破坏检测方法。

Result: 实验表明，新系统优于当前生产系统，并开源了代码和数据集。

Conclusion: 统一方法提升了覆盖率和维护性，为后续研究提供了资源。

Abstract: We introduce a next-generation vandalism detection system for Wikidata, one
of the largest open-source structured knowledge bases on the Web. Wikidata is
highly complex: its items incorporate an ever-expanding universe of factual
triples and multilingual texts. While edits can alter both structured and
textual content, our approach converts all edits into a single space using a
method we call Graph2Text. This allows for evaluating all content changes for
potential vandalism using a single multilingual language model. This unified
approach improves coverage and simplifies maintenance. Experiments demonstrate
that our solution outperforms the current production system. Additionally, we
are releasing the code under an open license along with a large dataset of
various human-generated knowledge alterations, enabling further research.

Motivation: 探讨gold context长度对LLMs性能的影响，填补此前研究的空白。

Method: 通过系统实验，分析不同gold context长度对LLMs在多个领域（通用知识、生物医学推理、数学推理）和七种先进LLMs上的表现。

Result: gold context较短时，LLMs性能显著下降，且位置敏感性增强。

Conclusion: 研究为设计稳健、上下文感知的LLM驱动系统提供了明确指导。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face significant challenges with
needle-in-a-haystack tasks, where relevant information ("the needle") must be
drawn from a large pool of irrelevant context ("the haystack"). Previous
studies have highlighted positional bias and distractor quantity as critical
factors affecting model performance, yet the influence of gold context size has
received little attention. We address this gap by systematically studying how
variations in gold context length impact LLM performance on long-context
question answering tasks. Our experiments reveal that LLM performance drops
sharply when the gold context is shorter, i.e., smaller gold contexts
consistently degrade model performance and amplify positional sensitivity,
posing a major challenge for agentic systems that must integrate scattered,
fine-grained information of varying lengths. This pattern holds across three
diverse domains (general knowledge, biomedical reasoning, and mathematical
reasoning) and seven state-of-the-art LLMs of various sizes and architectures.
Our work provides clear insights to guide the design of robust, context-aware
LLM-driven systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FFS的无训练并行解码策略，通过动态分配计算资源，显著提升了大型语言模型在推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法依赖长解码路径或大量样本，增加了计算开销和延迟。研究发现短路径更可能正确，因此提出FFS以优化推理效率。

Method: FFS策略并行启动多个独立样本，并在任一完成时立即返回结果。

Result: 在四个推理模型和数据集上测试，FFS显著提升准确率，例如在AIME数据集上达到82.23%，比基线提升15%。

Conclusion: FFS展示了简单测试时缩放策略的潜力，为推理优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS), which involves dynamic allocation of compute during
inference, offers a promising way to improve reasoning in large language
models. While existing TTS methods work well, they often rely on long decoding
paths or require a large number of samples to be generated, increasing the
token usage and inference latency. We observe the surprising fact that for
reasoning tasks, shorter traces are much more likely to be correct than longer
ones. Motivated by this, we introduce First Finish Search (FFS), a
training-free parallel decoding strategy that launches $n$ independent samples
and returns as soon as any one completes. We evaluate FFS alongside simple
decoding, beam search, majority voting, and budget forcing on four reasoning
models (DeepSeek-R1, R1-Distill-Qwen-32B, QwQ-32B and Phi-4-Reasoning-Plus) and
across four datasets (AIME24, AIME25-I, AIME25-II and GPQA Diamond). With
DeepSeek-R1, FFS achieves $82.23\%$ accuracy on the AIME datasets, a $15\%$
improvement over DeepSeek-R1's standalone accuracy, nearly matching OpenAI's
o4-mini performance. Our theoretical analysis explains why stopping at the
shortest trace is likely to yield a correct answer and identifies the
conditions under which early stopping may be suboptimal. The elegance and
simplicity of FFS demonstrate that straightforward TTS strategies can perform
remarkably well, revealing the untapped potential of simple approaches at
inference time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯诗歌是阿拉伯语言中复杂且文化深厚的表达形式，但LLM对其理解能力尚未被充分探索。

Method: 构建了一个包含诗歌及其解释的基准数据集，评估语义理解、隐喻解释、韵律意识和文化背景。

Result: 大多数先进LLM在诗歌理解上表现不佳，尽管在标准阿拉伯任务上表现良好。

Conclusion: 诗歌理解是测试LLM对古典阿拉伯语理解的强指标，`Fann or Flop`为阿拉伯语言模型的评估和发展提供了开源资源。

Abstract: Arabic poetry stands as one of the most sophisticated and culturally embedded
forms of expression in the Arabic language, known for its layered meanings,
stylistic diversity, and deep historical continuity. Although large language
models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across languages and tasks,
their ability to understand Arabic poetry remains largely unexplored. In this
work, we introduce `Fann or Flop`, the first benchmark designed to assess the
comprehension of Arabic poetry by LLMs in twelve historical eras, covering 21
core poetic genres and a variety of metrical forms, from classical structures
to contemporary free verse. The benchmark comprises a curated corpus of poems
with explanations that assess semantic understanding, metaphor interpretation,
prosodic awareness, and cultural context. We argue that poetic comprehension
offers a strong indicator for testing how good the LLM is in understanding
classical Arabic through the Arabic poetry. Unlike surface-level tasks, this
domain demands deeper interpretive reasoning and cultural sensitivity. Our
evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs shows that most models struggle with poetic
understanding despite strong results on standard Arabic benchmarks. We release
`Fann or Flop` along with the evaluation suite as an open-source resource to
enable rigorous evaluation and advancement for Arabic language models. Code is

Motivation: 现有评估方法多为单步，无法捕捉LLMs在动态道德挑战中的适应能力，因此需要更细致的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含3,302个五阶段困境的MMDs数据集，对九种常用LLMs进行动态分析。

Result: LLMs的价值偏好随困境进展显著变化，优先考虑关怀价值，但在某些情境下公平价值会超越关怀。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁采用动态、情境感知的评估范式，以推动更符合人类价值观的LLMs发展。

Abstract: Ethical decision-making is a critical aspect of human judgment, and the
growing use of LLMs in decision-support systems necessitates a rigorous
evaluation of their moral reasoning capabilities. However, existing assessments
primarily rely on single-step evaluations, failing to capture how models adapt
to evolving ethical challenges. Addressing this gap, we introduce the
Multi-step Moral Dilemmas (MMDs), the first dataset specifically constructed to
evaluate the evolving moral judgments of LLMs across 3,302 five-stage dilemmas.
This framework enables a fine-grained, dynamic analysis of how LLMs adjust
their moral reasoning across escalating dilemmas. Our evaluation of nine widely
used LLMs reveals that their value preferences shift significantly as dilemmas
progress, indicating that models recalibrate moral judgments based on scenario
complexity. Furthermore, pairwise value comparisons demonstrate that while LLMs
often prioritize the value of care, this value can sometimes be superseded by
fairness in certain contexts, highlighting the dynamic and context-dependent
nature of LLM ethical reasoning. Our findings call for a shift toward dynamic,
context-aware evaluation paradigms, paving the way for more human-aligned and
value-sensitive development of LLMs.

Motivation: 研究动机是探索TTI模型在历史背景下的表现，填补了现有研究对历史准确性评估的空白。

Method: 通过创建HistVis数据集（包含30,000张合成图像），评估模型在历史风格关联、历史一致性和人口统计表示三个方面的表现。

Result: 研究发现TTI模型在历史描绘中存在系统性偏差，包括刻板印象、时代错误和人口统计不准确。

Conclusion: 该研究为评估和改进TTI模型的历史准确性提供了方法论和基准，是迈向更准确和符合文化的模型的第一步。

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in
content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and
cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic
and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent
historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a
systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict
different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis
dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three
state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting
universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate
generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic
Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras;
(2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts
in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated
racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our
findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated
imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating
unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible
demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for
assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an
initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned
TTI models.

Result: 数据集和基线模型为手语多模态情感识别提供了新基准。

Conclusion: EmoSign填补了研究空白，为手语情感识别奠定了基础。

Abstract: Unlike spoken languages where the use of prosodic features to convey emotion
is well studied, indicators of emotion in sign language remain poorly
understood, creating communication barriers in critical settings. Sign
languages present unique challenges as facial expressions and hand movements
simultaneously serve both grammatical and emotional functions. To address this
gap, we introduce EmoSign, the first sign video dataset containing sentiment
and emotion labels for 200 American Sign Language (ASL) videos. We also collect
open-ended descriptions of emotion cues. Annotations were done by 3 Deaf ASL
signers with professional interpretation experience. Alongside the annotations,
we include baseline models for sentiment and emotion classification. This
dataset not only addresses a critical gap in existing sign language research
but also establishes a new benchmark for understanding model capabilities in
multimodal emotion recognition for sign languages. The dataset is made
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/catfang/emosign.

Motivation: 多模态ICL在大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）中表现不稳定，现有研究主要关注序列配置优化，而忽略了LVLM内部机制。

Method: 提出了Context-Aware Modulated Attention（CAMA），一种无需训练、即插即用的方法，用于直接校准LVLM的注意力对数。

Result: 在四种LVLM和六个基准测试中验证了CAMA的有效性和通用性。

Conclusion: CAMA为深入探索和针对性利用LVLM注意力动态提供了新机会，推动了多模态推理的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal in-context learning (ICL) enables large vision-language models
(LVLMs) to efficiently adapt to novel tasks, supporting a wide array of
real-world applications. However, multimodal ICL remains unstable, and current
research largely focuses on optimizing sequence configuration while overlooking
the internal mechanisms of LVLMs. In this work, we first provide a theoretical
analysis of attentional dynamics in multimodal ICL and identify three core
limitations of standard attention that ICL impair performance. To address these
challenges, we propose Context-Aware Modulated Attention (CAMA), a simple yet
effective plug-and-play method for directly calibrating LVLM attention logits.
CAMA is training-free and can be seamlessly applied to various open-source
LVLMs. We evaluate CAMA on four LVLMs across six benchmarks, demonstrating its
effectiveness and generality. CAMA opens new opportunities for deeper
exploration and targeted utilization of LVLM attention dynamics to advance
multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 论文研究了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视觉问答任务中依赖记忆的世界知识还是输入图像的视觉信息，通过Visual CounterFact数据集发现模型预测从记忆先验转向视觉证据，并提出PvP机制控制模型输出。


<details>

Motivation: 探究MLLMs在视觉任务中依赖记忆知识还是视觉输入，以理解其推理机制。

Method: 引入Visual CounterFact数据集，设计PvP机制通过激活干预控制模型输出。

Result: 模型预测从记忆先验转向视觉证据，PvP成功将92.5%颜色和74.6%大小预测从先验转向反事实。

Conclusion: 研究为解释和控制多模态模型的事实行为提供了新工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) perform well on tasks such as visual
question answering, but it remains unclear whether their reasoning relies more
on memorized world knowledge or on the visual information present in the input
image. To investigate this, we introduce Visual CounterFact, a new dataset of
visually-realistic counterfactuals that put world knowledge priors (e.g, red
strawberry) into direct conflict with visual input (e.g, blue strawberry).
Using Visual CounterFact, we show that model predictions initially reflect
memorized priors, but shift toward visual evidence in mid-to-late layers. This
dynamic reveals a competition between the two modalities, with visual input
ultimately overriding priors during evaluation. To control this behavior, we
propose Pixels Versus Priors (PvP) steering vectors, a mechanism for
controlling model outputs toward either world knowledge or visual input through
activation-level interventions. On average, PvP successfully shifts 92.5% of
color and 74.6% of size predictions from priors to counterfactuals. Together,
these findings offer new tools for interpreting and controlling factual
behavior in multimodal models.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are highly vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that exploit visual-textual interactions to bypass safety guardrails.
In this paper, we present DTR, a novel inference-time defense that mitigates
multimodal jailbreak attacks through optimizing the model's key-value (KV)
caches. Rather than relying on curated safety-specific data or costly
image-to-text conversion, we introduce a new formulation of the safety-relevant
distributional shift induced by the visual modality. This formulation enables
DTR to dynamically adjust visual token weights, minimizing the impact of
adversarial visual inputs while preserving the model's general capabilities and
inference efficiency. Extensive evaluation across diverse VLMs and attack
benchmarks demonstrates that \sys outperforms existing defenses in both attack
robustness and benign task performance, marking the first successful
application of KV cache optimization for safety enhancement in multimodal
foundation models. The code for replicating DTR is available:

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in computer vision has made significant
advancements, yet tracking small fish in underwater environments presents
unique challenges due to complex 3D motions and data noise. Traditional
single-view MOT models often fall short in these settings. This thesis
addresses these challenges by adapting state-of-the-art single-view MOT models,
FairMOT and YOLOv8, for underwater fish detecting and tracking in ecological
studies. The core contribution of this research is the development of a
multi-view framework that utilizes stereo video inputs to enhance tracking
accuracy and fish behavior pattern recognition. By integrating and evaluating
these models on underwater fish video datasets, the study aims to demonstrate
significant improvements in precision and reliability compared to single-view
approaches. The proposed framework detects fish entities with a relative
accuracy of 47% and employs stereo-matching techniques to produce a novel 3D
output, providing a more comprehensive understanding of fish movements and
interactions

Abstract: Charts play a critical role in data analysis and visualization, yet
real-world applications often present charts with challenging or noisy
features. However, "outlier charts" pose a substantial challenge even for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which can struggle to interpret
perturbed charts. In this work, we introduce CHAOS (CHart Analysis with Outlier
Samples), a robustness benchmark to systematically evaluate MLLMs against chart
perturbations. CHAOS encompasses five types of textual and ten types of visual
perturbations, each presented at three levels of severity (easy, mid, hard)
inspired by the study result of human evaluation. The benchmark includes 13
state-of-the-art MLLMs divided into three groups (i.e., general-, document-,
and chart-specific models) according to the training scope and data.
Comprehensive analysis involves two downstream tasks (ChartQA and
Chart-to-Text). Extensive experiments and case studies highlight critical
insights into robustness of models across chart perturbations, aiming to guide
future research in chart understanding domain. Data and code are publicly

Conclusion: 该研究填补了数据集修剪与目标检测之间的空白，为复杂视觉任务的修剪提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dataset pruning -- selecting a small yet informative subset of training data
-- has emerged as a promising strategy for efficient machine learning, offering
significant reductions in computational cost and storage compared to
alternatives like dataset distillation. While pruning methods have shown strong
performance in image classification, their extension to more complex computer
vision tasks, particularly object detection, remains relatively underexplored.
In this paper, we present the first principled extension of classification
pruning techniques to the object detection domain, to the best of our
knowledge. We identify and address three key challenges that hinder this
transition: the Object-Level Attribution Problem, the Scoring Strategy Problem,
and the Image-Level Aggregation Problem. To overcome these, we propose tailored
solutions, including a novel scoring method called Variance-based Prediction
Score (VPS). VPS leverages both Intersection over Union (IoU) and confidence
scores to effectively identify informative training samples specific to
detection tasks. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate
that our approach consistently outperforms prior dataset pruning methods in
terms of mean Average Precision (mAP). We also show that annotation count and
class distribution shift can influence detection performance, but selecting
informative examples is a more critical factor than dataset size or balance.
Our work bridges dataset pruning and object detection, paving the way for
dataset pruning in complex vision tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法需要额外训练模块以实现面部特征控制，缺乏灵活性且资源消耗大。

Method: 使用潜在一致性模型确保扩散步骤中的真实预测，结合预训练专家模型提供精确引导信号。

Result: 实验表明，专家模型能高精度引导生成过程，多专家协作可实现多面部特征同时控制。

Conclusion: ExpertGen通过直接集成现成专家模型，实现了灵活、高效的细粒度面部生成控制。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved text-to-face
generation, but achieving fine-grained control over facial features remains a
challenge. Existing methods often require training additional modules to handle
specific controls such as identity, attributes, or age, making them inflexible
and resource-intensive. We propose ExpertGen, a training-free framework that
leverages pre-trained expert models such as face recognition, facial attribute
recognition, and age estimation networks to guide generation with fine control.
Our approach uses a latent consistency model to ensure realistic and
in-distribution predictions at each diffusion step, enabling accurate guidance
signals to effectively steer the diffusion process. We show qualitatively and
quantitatively that expert models can guide the generation process with high
precision, and multiple experts can collaborate to enable simultaneous control
over diverse facial aspects. By allowing direct integration of off-the-shelf
expert models, our method transforms any such model into a plug-and-play
component for controllable face generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型中的偏见通常是相互关联的，但现有方法难以量化这些关联。

Method: 引入BiasConnect分析偏见交互，提出InterMit算法进行偏见缓解。

Result: InterMit在减少偏见和提升图像质量方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: InterMit是一种灵活且可扩展的偏见缓解解决方案。

Abstract: The biases exhibited by text-to-image (TTI) models are often treated as
independent, though in reality, they may be deeply interrelated. Addressing
bias along one dimension - such as ethnicity or age - can inadvertently affect
another, like gender, either mitigating or exacerbating existing disparities.
Understanding these interdependencies is crucial for designing fairer
generative models, yet measuring such effects quantitatively remains a
challenge. To address this, we introduce BiasConnect, a novel tool for
analyzing and quantifying bias interactions in TTI models. BiasConnect uses
counterfactual interventions along different bias axes to reveal the underlying
structure of these interactions and estimates the effect of mitigating one bias
axis on another. These estimates show strong correlation (+0.65) with observed
post-mitigation outcomes. Building on BiasConnect, we propose InterMit, an
intersectional bias mitigation algorithm guided by user-defined target
distributions and priority weights. InterMit achieves lower bias (0.33 vs.
0.52) with fewer mitigation steps (2.38 vs. 3.15 average steps), and yields
superior image quality compared to traditional techniques. Although our
implementation is training-free, InterMit is modular and can be integrated with
many existing debiasing approaches for TTI models, making it a flexible and
extensible solution.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的无监督异常检测模型仅依赖图像特征，难以区分正常解剖变异与病理异常。

Method: 提出图像-EHR交叉注意力模块，整合临床上下文；开发静态掩码策略以增强正常图像重建。

Result: 在CheXpert和MIMIC-CXR/IV数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Diff3M通过多模态融合显著提升了医学图像异常检测能力。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) in medical imaging is crucial for
identifying pathological abnormalities without requiring extensive labeled
data. However, existing diffusion-based UAD models rely solely on imaging
features, limiting their ability to distinguish between normal anatomical
variations and pathological anomalies. To address this, we propose Diff3M, a
multi-modal diffusion-based framework that integrates chest X-rays and
structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for enhanced anomaly detection.
Specifically, we introduce a novel image-EHR cross-attention module to
incorporate structured clinical context into the image generation process,
improving the model's ability to differentiate normal from abnormal features.
Additionally, we develop a static masking strategy to enhance the
reconstruction of normal-like images from anomalies. Extensive evaluations on
CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR/IV demonstrate that Diff3M achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing UAD methods in medical imaging. Our code is

Conclusion: patch-aligned training能有效增强视觉与语言的对齐，且易于扩展到其他多模态模型。

Abstract: Achieving better alignment between vision embeddings and Large Language
Models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing the abilities of Multimodal LLMs
(MLLMs), particularly for recent models that rely on powerful pretrained vision
encoders and LLMs. A common approach to connect the pretrained vision encoder
and LLM is through a projector applied after the vision encoder. However, the
projector is often trained to enable the LLM to generate captions, and hence
the mechanism by which LLMs understand each vision token remains unclear. In
this work, we first investigate the role of the projector in compressing vision
embeddings and aligning them with word embeddings. We show that the projector
significantly compresses visual information, removing redundant details while
preserving essential elements necessary for the LLM to understand visual
content. We then examine patch-level alignment -- the alignment between each
vision patch and its corresponding semantic words -- and propose a
*multi-semantic alignment hypothesis*. Our analysis indicates that the
projector trained by caption loss improves patch-level alignment but only to a
limited extent, resulting in weak and coarse alignment. To address this issue,
we propose *patch-aligned training* to efficiently enhance patch-level
alignment. Our experiments show that patch-aligned training (1) achieves
stronger compression capability and improved patch-level alignment, enabling
the MLLM to generate higher-quality captions, (2) improves the MLLM's
performance by 16% on referring expression grounding tasks, 4% on
question-answering tasks, and 3% on modern instruction-following benchmarks
when using the same supervised fine-tuning (SFT) setting. The proposed method
can be easily extended to other multimodal models.

Abstract: Biological collections house millions of specimens documenting Earth's
biodiversity, with digital images increasingly available through open-access
platforms. Most imaging protocols were developed for human visual
interpretation without considering computational analysis requirements. This
paper aims to bridge the gap between current imaging practices and the
potential for automated analysis by presenting key considerations for creating
biological specimen images optimized for computer vision applications. We
provide conceptual computer vision topics for context, addressing fundamental
concerns including model generalization, data leakage, and comprehensive
metadata documentation, and outline practical guidance on specimen imagine, and
data storage. These recommendations were synthesized through interdisciplinary
collaboration between taxonomists, collection managers, ecologists, and
computer scientists. Through this synthesis, we have identified ten
interconnected considerations that form a framework for successfully
integrating biological specimen images into computer vision pipelines. The key
elements include: (1) comprehensive metadata documentation, (2) standardized
specimen positioning, (3) consistent size and color calibration, (4) protocols
for handling multiple specimens in one image, (5) uniform background selection,
(6) controlled lighting, (7) appropriate resolution and magnification, (8)
optimal file formats, (9) robust data archiving strategies, and (10) accessible
data sharing practices. By implementing these recommendations, collection
managers, taxonomists, and biodiversity informaticians can generate images that
support automated trait extraction, species identification, and novel
ecological and evolutionary analyses at unprecedented scales. Successful
implementation lies in thorough documentation of methodological choices.

Abstract: Foundational game-image encoders often overfit to game-specific visual
styles, undermining performance on downstream tasks when applied to new games.
We present a method that combines contrastive learning and domain-adversarial
training to learn game-invariant visual features. By simultaneously encouraging
similar content to cluster and discouraging game-specific cues via an
adversarial domain classifier, our approach produces embeddings that generalize
across diverse games. Experiments on the Bingsu game-image dataset (10,000
screenshots from 10 games) demonstrate that after only a few training epochs,
our model's features no longer cluster by game, indicating successful
invariance and potential for improved cross-game transfer (e.g., glitch
detection) with minimal fine-tuning. This capability paves the way for more
generalizable game vision models that require little to no retraining on new
games.

Abstract: In this work, we propose Few Shot Domain Adapting Graph (FS-DAG), a scalable

are critical in real-world deployments. FS-DAG is highly performant with less
than 90M parameters, making it well-suited for complex real-world applications
for Information Extraction (IE) tasks where computational resources are
limited. We demonstrate FS-DAG's capability through extensive experiments for
information extraction task, showing significant improvements in convergence
speed and performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, this
work highlights the ongoing progress in developing smaller, more efficient
models that do not compromise on performance. Code :

Conclusion: 该方法能够沿固有运动轨迹准确模拟4D视频，为图像引导的临床应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Temporal modeling on regular respiration-induced motions is crucial to
image-guided clinical applications. Existing methods cannot simulate temporal
motions unless high-dose imaging scans including starting and ending frames
exist simultaneously. However, in the preoperative data acquisition stage, the
slight movement of patients may result in dynamic backgrounds between the first
and last frames in a respiratory period. This additional deviation can hardly
be removed by image registration, thus affecting the temporal modeling. To
address that limitation, we pioneeringly simulate the regular motion process
via the image-to-video (I2V) synthesis framework, which animates with the first
frame to forecast future frames of a given length. Besides, to promote the
temporal consistency of animated videos, we devise the Temporal Differential
Diffusion Model to generate temporal differential fields, which measure the
relative differential representations between adjacent frames. The prompt
attention layer is devised for fine-grained differential fields, and the field
augmented layer is adopted to better interact these fields with the I2V
framework, promoting more accurate temporal variation of synthesized videos.
Extensive results on ACDC cardiac and 4D Lung datasets reveal that our approach
simulates 4D videos along the intrinsic motion trajectory, rivaling other
competitive methods on perceptual similarity and temporal consistency. Codes
will be available soon.

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构，直接从CT体积回归6D高斯泼溅参数，通过大规模预训练消除逐扫描优化。

Result: Render-FM在视觉保真度上优于或媲美逐扫描方法，同时将准备时间从近一小时缩短至秒级。

Conclusion: Render-FM实现了高质量实时交互式3D可视化，可无缝集成到实时手术规划和诊断工作流中。

Abstract: Volumetric rendering of Computed Tomography (CT) scans is crucial for
visualizing complex 3D anatomical structures in medical imaging. Current
high-fidelity approaches, especially neural rendering techniques, require
time-consuming per-scene optimization, limiting clinical applicability due to
computational demands and poor generalizability. We propose Render-FM, a novel
foundation model for direct, real-time volumetric rendering of CT scans.
Render-FM employs an encoder-decoder architecture that directly regresses 6D
Gaussian Splatting (6DGS) parameters from CT volumes, eliminating per-scan
optimization through large-scale pre-training on diverse medical data. By
integrating robust feature extraction with the expressive power of 6DGS, our
approach efficiently generates high-quality, real-time interactive 3D
visualizations across diverse clinical CT data. Experiments demonstrate that
Render-FM achieves visual fidelity comparable or superior to specialized
per-scan methods while drastically reducing preparation time from nearly an
hour to seconds for a single inference step. This advancement enables seamless
integration into real-time surgical planning and diagnostic workflows. The

Motivation: 探索眼动和眼周图像两种模态在认证系统中的融合潜力，以提升认证性能。

Method: 提出了一种多模态认证系统，结合了先进的机器学习架构，并在包含9202名受试者的大规模数据集上进行评估。

Result: 多模态系统在所有场景中均优于单模态系统，并超过了FIDO基准。

Conclusion: 多模态融合显著提升了认证性能，机器学习架构的成功应用是关键因素。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of fusing two eye-centric
authentication modalities-eye movements and periocular images-within a
calibration-free authentication system. While each modality has independently
shown promise for user authentication, their combination within a unified
gaze-estimation pipeline has not been thoroughly explored at scale. In this
report, we propose a multimodal authentication system and evaluate it using a
large-scale in-house dataset comprising 9202 subjects with an eye tracking (ET)
signal quality equivalent to a consumer-facing virtual reality (VR) device. Our
results show that the multimodal approach consistently outperforms both
unimodal systems across all scenarios, surpassing the FIDO benchmark. The
integration of a state-of-the-art machine learning architecture contributed
significantly to the overall authentication performance at scale, driven by the
model's ability to capture authentication representations and the complementary
discriminative characteristics of the fused modalities.

Conclusion: 该提案旨在为更安全、更符合人类价值观的扩散生成AI提供新的见解和技术。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as leading generative models for images and
other modalities, but aligning their outputs with human preferences and safety
constraints remains a critical challenge. This thesis proposal investigates
methods to align diffusion models using reinforcement learning (RL) and reward
modeling. We survey recent advances in fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion
models with human feedback, including reinforcement learning from human and AI
feedback, direct preference optimization, and differentiable reward approaches.
We classify these methods based on the type of feedback (human, automated,
binary or ranked preferences), the fine-tuning technique (policy gradient,
reward-weighted likelihood, direct backpropagation, etc.), and their efficiency
and safety outcomes. We compare key algorithms and frameworks, highlighting how
they improve alignment with user intent or safety standards, and discuss
inter-relationships such as how newer methods build on or diverge from earlier
ones. Based on the survey, we identify five promising research directions for
the next two years: (1) multi-objective alignment with combined rewards, (2)
efficient human feedback usage and active learning, (3) robust safety alignment
against adversarial inputs, (4) continual and online alignment of diffusion
models, and (5) interpretable and trustworthy reward modeling for generative
images. Each direction is elaborated with its problem statement, challenges,
related work, and a proposed research plan. The proposal is organized as a
comprehensive document with literature review, comparative tables of methods,
and detailed research plans, aiming to contribute new insights and techniques
for safer and value-aligned diffusion-based generative AI.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖计算近似，导致结果不准确或次优，需要改进。

Method: 采用双上升优化框架结合扩散模型先验。

Result: 在图像恢复任务中表现更优，对高噪声更鲁棒，速度更快，结果更忠实于观测数据。

Conclusion: 新框架在解决逆问题时显著优于现有技术。

Abstract: Ill-posed inverse problems are fundamental in many domains, ranging from
astrophysics to medical imaging. Emerging diffusion models provide a powerful
prior for solving these problems. Existing maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) or
posterior sampling approaches, however, rely on different computational
approximations, leading to inaccurate or suboptimal samples. To address this
issue, we introduce a new approach to solving MAP problems with diffusion model
priors using a dual ascent optimization framework. Our framework achieves
better image quality as measured by various metrics for image restoration
problems, it is more robust to high levels of measurement noise, it is faster,
and it estimates solutions that represent the observations more faithfully than
the state of the art.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种在推理时注入离焦模糊线索的方法，将预训练的Marigold扩散模型转化为无需训练的度量深度预测器，显著提升了零样本泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单眼度量深度估计方法在零样本泛化方面表现不佳，尤其是在分布外数据集上性能下降明显。

Method: 通过在同一视点下拍摄小光圈和大光圈的两张图像，结合离焦模糊成像模型，优化Marigold的度量深度缩放参数和噪声潜在变量。

Result: 在自收集的真实数据集上，该方法在定量和定性上均优于现有零样本单眼度量深度估计方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引入离焦模糊线索，显著提升了零样本度量深度估计的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent monocular metric depth estimation (MMDE) methods have made notable
progress towards zero-shot generalization. However, they still exhibit a
significant performance drop on out-of-distribution datasets. We address this
limitation by injecting defocus blur cues at inference time into Marigold, a
\textit{pre-trained} diffusion model for zero-shot, scale-invariant monocular
depth estimation (MDE). Our method effectively turns Marigold into a metric
depth predictor in a training-free manner. To incorporate defocus cues, we
capture two images with a small and a large aperture from the same viewpoint.
To recover metric depth, we then optimize the metric depth scaling parameters
and the noise latents of Marigold at inference time using gradients from a loss
function based on the defocus-blur image formation model. We compare our method
against existing state-of-the-art zero-shot MMDE methods on a self-collected
real dataset, showing quantitative and qualitative improvements.

challenging. This paper introduces EVM-Fusion, an Explainable Vision Mamba
architecture featuring a novel Neural Algorithmic Fusion (NAF) mechanism for
multi-organ medical image classification. EVM-Fusion leverages a multipath

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国尤其是加州野火频发，造成严重损失，亟需高效的检测与预防技术。

Method: 使用10.74GB高分辨率图像数据集训练ViT模型，图像预处理包括调整尺寸、转换为张量并归一化。

Result: ViT模型能处理复杂图像数据，但数据获取、计算成本和实时集成仍是问题。

Conclusion: 深度学习模型如ViTs在野火检测中潜力巨大，但需解决数据与计算资源限制。

Abstract: The critical need for sophisticated detection techniques has been highlighted
by the rising frequency and intensity of wildfires in the US, especially in
California. In 2023, wildfires caused 130 deaths nationwide, the highest since
1990. In January 2025, Los Angeles wildfires which included the Palisades and
Eaton fires burnt approximately 40,000 acres and 12,000 buildings, and caused
loss of human lives. The devastation underscores the urgent need for effective
detection and prevention strategies. Deep learning models, such as Vision
Transformers (ViTs), can enhance early detection by processing complex image
data with high accuracy. However, wildfire detection faces challenges,
including the availability of high-quality, real-time data. Wildfires often
occur in remote areas with limited sensor coverage, and environmental factors
like smoke and cloud cover can hinder detection. Additionally, training deep
learning models is computationally expensive, and issues like false
positives/negatives and scaling remain concerns. Integrating detection systems
with real-time alert mechanisms also poses difficulties. In this work, we used
the wildfire dataset consisting of 10.74 GB high-resolution images categorized
into 'fire' and 'nofire' classes is used for training the ViT model. To prepare
the data, images are resized to 224 x 224 pixels, converted into tensor format,
and normalized using ImageNet statistics.

Motivation: 解决高分辨率3D形状生成中体积表示（如SDF）的计算和内存挑战。

Method: 采用稀疏体积和空间稀疏注意力机制（SSA），结合变分自编码器（VAE）保持稀疏体积格式的一致性。

Result: 实现了3.9倍前向传播和9.6倍反向传播加速，支持1024分辨率训练仅需8个GPU。

Conclusion: Direct3D S2在生成质量和效率上超越现有方法，使大规模3D生成更实用和可访问。

Abstract: Generating high resolution 3D shapes using volumetric representations such as
Signed Distance Functions presents substantial computational and memory
challenges. We introduce Direct3D S2, a scalable 3D generation framework based
on sparse volumes that achieves superior output quality with dramatically
reduced training costs. Our key innovation is the Spatial Sparse Attention
mechanism, which greatly enhances the efficiency of Diffusion Transformer
computations on sparse volumetric data. SSA allows the model to effectively
process large token sets within sparse volumes, significantly reducing
computational overhead and achieving a 3.9x speedup in the forward pass and a
9.6x speedup in the backward pass. Our framework also includes a variational
autoencoder that maintains a consistent sparse volumetric format across input,
latent, and output stages. Compared to previous methods with heterogeneous
representations in 3D VAE, this unified design significantly improves training
efficiency and stability. Our model is trained on public available datasets,
and experiments demonstrate that Direct3D S2 not only surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in generation quality and efficiency, but also enables
training at 1024 resolution using only 8 GPUs, a task typically requiring at
least 32 GPUs for volumetric representations at 256 resolution, thus making
gigascale 3D generation both practical and accessible. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM生成的摘要冗长冗余，且评估依赖人工标注，忽略了摘要在下游任务中的实用性。

Method: 提出VIBE方法，通过grounding和utility两个指标对VLM输出进行评分和排序。

Result: 实验表明，VIBE选择的摘要显著提升任务准确率（最高61.23%）并减少响应时间（75.77%）。

Conclusion: VIBE能有效支持人类决策，优于传统VLM摘要或原始视频。

Abstract: Many decision-making tasks, where both accuracy and efficiency matter, still
require human supervision. For example, tasks like traffic officers reviewing
hour-long dashcam footage or researchers screening conference videos can
benefit from concise summaries that reduce cognitive load and save time. Yet
current vision-language models (VLMs) often produce verbose, redundant outputs
that hinder task performance. Existing video caption evaluation depends on
costly human annotations and overlooks the summaries' utility in downstream
tasks. We address these gaps with Video-to-text Information Bottleneck
Evaluation (VIBE), an annotation-free method that scores VLM outputs using two
metrics: grounding (how well the summary aligns with visual content) and
utility (how informative it is for the task). VIBE selects from randomly
sampled VLM outputs by ranking them according to the two scores to support
effective human decision-making. Human studies on LearningPaper24,
SUTD-TrafficQA, and LongVideoBench show that summaries selected by VIBE
consistently improve performance-boosting task accuracy by up to 61.23% and
reducing response time by 75.77% compared to naive VLM summaries or raw video.

Result: 在存在背景和性别偏见的基准测试中，LTC的最差组准确率提升超过50%。

Conclusion: LTC有效识别并修正了虚假注意力头，同时提升了模型性能，可视化结果验证了其机制。

Abstract: Multimodal models like CLIP have gained significant attention due to their
remarkable zero-shot performance across various tasks. However, studies have
revealed that CLIP can inadvertently learn spurious associations between target
variables and confounding factors. To address this, we introduce
\textsc{Locate-Then-Correct} (LTC), a contrastive framework that identifies
spurious attention heads in Vision Transformers via mechanistic insights and
mitigates them through targeted ablation. Furthermore, LTC identifies salient,
task-relevant attention heads, enabling the integration of discriminative
features through orthogonal projection to improve classification performance.
We evaluate LTC on benchmarks with inherent background and gender biases,
achieving over a $>50\%$ gain in worst-group accuracy compared to non-training
post-hoc baselines. Additionally, we visualize the representation of selected
heads and find that the presented interpretation corroborates our contrastive
mechanism for identifying both spurious and salient attention heads. Code

Conclusion: OmniTraj克服了传统方法的局限性，为轨迹检索提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of mobile devices and data collection technologies
has led to an exponential increase in trajectory data, presenting significant
challenges in spatio-temporal data mining, particularly for efficient and
accurate trajectory retrieval. However, existing methods for trajectory
retrieval face notable limitations, including inefficiencies in large-scale
data, lack of support for condition-based queries, and reliance on trajectory
similarity measures. To address the above challenges, we propose OmniTraj, a
generalized and flexible omni-semantic trajectory retrieval framework that
integrates four complementary modalities or semantics -- raw trajectories,
topology, road segments, and regions -- into a unified system. Unlike
traditional approaches that are limited to computing and processing
trajectories as a single modality, OmniTraj designs dedicated encoders for each
modality, which are embedded and fused into a shared representation space. This
design enables OmniTraj to support accurate and flexible queries based on any
individual modality or combination thereof, overcoming the rigidity of
traditional similarity-based methods. Extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OmniTraj in handling large-scale
data, providing flexible, multi-modality queries, and supporting downstream
tasks and applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的视觉编码器攻击方法（VEAttack），通过最小化干净和扰动视觉特征的余弦相似度生成对抗样本，无需访问后续大型语言模型、任务信息或标签，显著降低了计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法多针对任务特定的白盒设置，不适用于设计用于多样化下游任务的LVLM，且计算成本高。因此，研究提出了一种仅针对视觉编码器的简单有效攻击方法。

Method: 通过优化图像令牌而非分类令牌来扰动图像，生成对抗样本，无需依赖任务或标签。

Result: VEAttack在图像描述任务中实现了94.5%的性能下降，在视觉问答任务中实现了75.7%的性能下降。

Conclusion: VEAttack是一种高效且通用的攻击方法，揭示了LVLM攻击/防御中的关键观察，如LLM隐藏层变化、令牌注意力差异等。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in multimodal understanding and generation, yet their
vulnerability to adversarial attacks raises significant robustness concerns.
While existing effective attacks always focus on task-specific white-box
settings, these approaches are limited in the context of LVLMs, which are
designed for diverse downstream tasks and require expensive full-model gradient
computations. Motivated by the pivotal role and wide adoption of the vision
encoder in LVLMs, we propose a simple yet effective Vision Encoder Attack
(VEAttack), which targets the vision encoder of LVLMs only. Specifically, we
propose to generate adversarial examples by minimizing the cosine similarity
between the clean and perturbed visual features, without accessing the
following large language models, task information, and labels. It significantly
reduces the computational overhead while eliminating the task and label
dependence of traditional white-box attacks in LVLMs. To make this simple
attack effective, we propose to perturb images by optimizing image tokens
instead of the classification token. We provide both empirical and theoretical
evidence that VEAttack can easily generalize to various tasks. VEAttack has
achieved a performance degradation of 94.5% on image caption task and 75.7% on
visual question answering task. We also reveal some key observations to provide
insights into LVLM attack/defense: 1) hidden layer variations of LLM, 2) token
attention differential, 3) M\"obius band in transfer attack, 4) low sensitivity
to attack steps. The code is available at

facilitating real-time collaborative perception among vehicles with restricted
bandwidth. In existing compression transmission systems, the sender lossily
compresses point coordinates and reflectance to generate a transmission code
stream, which faces transmission burdens from reflectance encoding and limited
detection robustness due to information loss. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a 3D object detection framework with reflectance
prediction-based knowledge distillation (RPKD). We compress point coordinates
while discarding reflectance during low-bitrate transmission, and feed the
decoded non-reflectance compressed point clouds into a student detector. The
discarded reflectance is then reconstructed by a geometry-based reflectance
prediction (RP) module within the student detector for precise detection. A
teacher detector with the same structure as student detector is designed for
performing reflectance knowledge distillation (RKD) and detection knowledge
distillation (DKD) from raw to compressed point clouds. Our RPKD framework
jointly trains detectors on both raw and compressed point clouds to improve the
student detector's robustness. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset and
Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our method can boost detection accuracy for
compressed point clouds across multiple code rates. Notably, at a low code rate
of 2.146 Bpp on the KITTI dataset, our RPKD-PV achieves the highest mAP of
73.6, outperforming existing detection methods with the PV-RCNN baseline.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了PawPrint和PawPrint+数据集，用于猫狗足迹识别，评估了深度神经网络和传统方法的优劣，并提出了结合全局与局部特征的未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国宠物数量增长，传统识别方法（如GPS标签）存在局限性，需要非侵入性解决方案。

Method: 引入PawPrint和PawPrint+数据集，评估深度神经网络（CNN、Transformers）和传统局部特征方法的性能。

Result: 不同方法在基底复杂性和数据可用性下表现各异，结合全局与局部特征可能提升可靠性。

Conclusion: 足迹识别为非侵入性替代方案，有望用于宠物管理和野生动物保护。

Abstract: In the United States, as of 2023, pet ownership has reached 66% of households
and continues to rise annually. This trend underscores the critical need for
effective pet identification and monitoring methods, particularly as nearly 10
million cats and dogs are reported stolen or lost each year. However,
traditional methods for finding lost animals like GPS tags or ID photos have
limitations-they can be removed, face signal issues, and depend on someone
finding and reporting the pet. To address these limitations, we introduce
PawPrint and PawPrint+, the first publicly available datasets focused on
individual-level footprint identification for dogs and cats. Through
comprehensive benchmarking of both modern deep neural networks (e.g., CNN,
Transformers) and classical local features, we observe varying advantages and
drawbacks depending on substrate complexity and data availability. These
insights suggest future directions for combining learned global representations
with local descriptors to enhance reliability across diverse, real-world
conditions. As this approach provides a non-invasive alternative to traditional
ID tags, we anticipate promising applications in ethical pet management and
wildlife conservation efforts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时预测交通事故对自动驾驶安全至关重要，但现有方法计算量大，难以实际部署。

Method: RARE利用预训练目标检测器的中间特征，避免额外特征提取，并引入注意力分数排序损失。

Result: RARE在DAD和CCD基准测试中速度提升4-8倍，延迟降至13.6ms/帧，同时保持最高平均精度。

Conclusion: RARE在实时性和准确性上表现优异，适用于安全关键应用。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of anticipating traffic accidents, which
aims to forecast potential accidents before they happen. Real-time anticipation
is crucial for safe autonomous driving, yet most methods rely on
computationally heavy modules like optical flow and intermediate feature
extractors, making real-world deployment challenging. In this paper, we thus
introduce RARE (Real-time Accident anticipation with Reused Embeddings), a
lightweight framework that capitalizes on intermediate features from a single
pre-trained object detector. By eliminating additional feature-extraction
pipelines, RARE significantly reduces latency. Furthermore, we introduce a
novel Attention Score Ranking Loss, which prioritizes higher attention on
accident-related objects over non-relevant ones. This loss enhances both
accuracy and interpretability. RARE demonstrates a 4-8 times speedup over
existing approaches on the DAD and CCD benchmarks, achieving a latency of
13.6ms per frame (73.3 FPS) on an RTX 6000. Moreover, despite its reduced
complexity, it attains state-of-the-art Average Precision and reliably
anticipates imminent collisions in real time. These results highlight RARE's
potential for safety-critical applications where timely and explainable
anticipation is essential.

Result: 性能达到Transformer水平，但计算量减少7倍。

Conclusion: WSI-GMamba为大规模WSI分析提供了高精度且高效的计算解决方案。

Abstract: Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in histopathology present a significant challenge
for large-scale medical image analysis due to their high resolution, large
size, and complex tile relationships. Existing Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)
methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Transformer-based models,
face limitations in scalability and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we
propose the WSI-GMamba framework, which synergistically combines the relational
modeling strengths of GNNs with the efficiency of Mamba, the State Space Model
designed for sequence learning. The proposed GMamba block integrates Message
Passing, Graph Scanning & Flattening, and feature aggregation via a
Bidirectional State Space Model (Bi-SSM), achieving Transformer-level
performance with 7* fewer FLOPs. By leveraging the complementary strengths of
lightweight GNNs and Mamba, the WSI-GMamba framework delivers a scalable
solution for large-scale WSI analysis, offering both high accuracy and
computational efficiency for slide-level classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颜色感知是人类视觉理解的基础，但因生物、文化和语言差异而多样化。研究旨在评估LVLMs是否能处理个体层面的感知差异。

Method: 使用Ishihara测试（一种检测CVDs的常用方法）评估LVLMs的能力。

Result: LVLMs能用自然语言解释CVDs，但无法在图像任务中模拟CVDs患者的颜色感知。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁开发能处理颜色感知多样性的多模态系统，以促进感知包容性和公平性。

Abstract: Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly being applied to
a wide range of real-world multimodal applications, involving complex visual
and linguistic reasoning. As these models become more integrated into practical
use, they are expected to handle complex aspects of human interaction. Among
these, color perception is a fundamental yet highly variable aspect of visual
understanding. It differs across individuals due to biological factors such as
Color Vision Deficiencies (CVDs), as well as differences in culture and
language. Despite its importance, perceptual diversity has received limited
attention. In our study, we evaluate LVLMs' ability to account for individual
level perceptual variation using the Ishihara Test, a widely used method for
detecting CVDs. Our results show that LVLMs can explain CVDs in natural
language, but they cannot simulate how people with CVDs perceive color in image
based tasks. These findings highlight the need for multimodal systems that can
account for color perceptual diversity and support broader discussions on
perceptual inclusiveness and fairness in multimodal AI.

Abstract: Given the central role of charts in scientific, business, and communication
contexts, enhancing the chart understanding capabilities of vision-language
models (VLMs) has become increasingly critical. A key limitation of existing
VLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements,
including charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and
images. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant
elements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce
OrionBench, a benchmark designed to support the development of accurate object
detection models for charts and HROs in infographics. It contains 26,250 real
and 78,750 synthetic infographics, with over 6.9 million bounding box
annotations. These annotations are created by combining the model-in-the-loop
and programmatic methods. We demonstrate the usefulness of OrionBench through
three applications: 1) constructing a Thinking-with-Boxes scheme to boost the
chart understanding performance of VLMs, 2) comparing existing object detection
models, and 3) applying the developed detection model to document layout and UI
element detection.

Conclusion: PoseBH有效解决了骨骼异质性和监督有限的问题，并在多任务中展示了良好的迁移能力。

Abstract: We study multi-dataset training (MDT) for pose estimation, where skeletal
heterogeneity presents a unique challenge that existing methods have yet to
address. In traditional domains, \eg regression and classification, MDT
typically relies on dataset merging or multi-head supervision. However, the
diversity of skeleton types and limited cross-dataset supervision complicate
integration in pose estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce
PoseBH, a new MDT framework that tackles keypoint heterogeneity and limited
supervision through two key techniques. First, we propose nonparametric
keypoint prototypes that learn within a unified embedding space, enabling
seamless integration across skeleton types. Second, we develop a cross-type
self-supervision mechanism that aligns keypoint predictions with keypoint
embedding prototypes, providing supervision without relying on teacher-student
models or additional augmentations. PoseBH substantially improves
generalization across whole-body and animal pose datasets, including
COCO-WholeBody, AP-10K, and APT-36K, while preserving performance on standard
human pose benchmarks (COCO, MPII, and AIC). Furthermore, our learned keypoint
embeddings transfer effectively to hand shape estimation (InterHand2.6M) and
human body shape estimation (3DPW). The code for PoseBH is available at:

Result: 实验证明AMD框架在检测MLLM驱动的多模态欺骗方面具有优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法为检测MLLM驱动的虚假信息提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The detection and grounding of multimedia manipulation has emerged as a
critical challenge in combating AI-generated disinformation. While existing
methods have made progress in recent years, we identify two fundamental
limitations in current approaches: (1) Underestimation of MLLM-driven deception
risk: prevailing techniques primarily address rule-based text manipulations,
yet fail to account for sophisticated misinformation synthesized by multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) that can dynamically generate semantically
coherent, contextually plausible yet deceptive narratives conditioned on
manipulated images; (2) Unrealistic misalignment artifacts: currently focused
scenarios rely on artificially misaligned content that lacks semantic
coherence, rendering them easily detectable. To address these gaps
holistically, we propose a new adversarial pipeline that leverages MLLMs to
generate high-risk disinformation. Our approach begins with constructing the
MLLM-Driven Synthetic Multimodal (MDSM) dataset, where images are first altered
using state-of-the-art editing techniques and then paired with MLLM-generated
deceptive texts that maintain semantic consistency with the visual
manipulations. Building upon this foundation, we present the Artifact-aware
Manipulation Diagnosis via MLLM (AMD) framework featuring two key innovations:
Artifact Pre-perception Encoding strategy and Manipulation-Oriented Reasoning,
to tame MLLMs for the MDSM problem. Comprehensive experiments validate our
framework's superior generalization capabilities as a unified architecture for
detecting MLLM-powered multimodal deceptions.

the motor control board defect detection model-based on image processing
established in this paper reached over 99%. It is suitable for timely image
processing of large quantities of motor control boards on the production line,

only be used for online detection of the motor control board defects, but also
provide solutions for the integrated circuit board defect processing for the

Conclusion: RoHyDR有效缓解数据缺失问题，提升多模态情感识别的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition analyzes emotions by combining data from
multiple sources. However, real-world noise or sensor failures often cause
missing or corrupted data, creating the Incomplete Multimodal Emotion
Recognition (IMER) challenge. In this paper, we propose Robust Hybrid Diffusion
Recovery (RoHyDR), a novel framework that performs missing-modality recovery at
unimodal, multimodal, feature, and semantic levels. For unimodal representation
recovery of missing modalities, RoHyDR exploits a diffusion-based generator to
generate distribution-consistent and semantically aligned representations from
Gaussian noise, using available modalities as conditioning. For multimodal
fusion recovery, we introduce adversarial learning to produce a realistic fused
multimodal representation and recover missing semantic content. We further
propose a multi-stage optimization strategy that enhances training stability
and efficiency. In contrast to previous work, the hybrid diffusion and
adversarial learning-based recovery mechanism in RoHyDR allows recovery of
missing information in both unimodal representation and multimodal fusion, at
both feature and semantic levels, effectively mitigating performance
degradation caused by suboptimal optimization. Comprehensive experiments
conducted on two widely used multimodal emotion recognition benchmarks
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art IMER methods,
achieving robust recognition performance under various missing-modality
scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Method: 提出AMPT方法，学习混合文本提示，并基于输入图像预测混合权重，生成样本特定的文本特征。

Result: 在11个数据集上，AMPT优于现有方法，显著提升了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: AMPT通过多提示混合和条件权重路由，有效提升了VLMs的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) have excellent generalization
capabilities but are highly susceptible to adversarial examples, presenting
potential security risks. To improve the robustness of VLMs against adversarial
examples, adversarial prompt tuning methods are proposed to align the text
feature with the adversarial image feature without changing model parameters.
However, when facing various adversarial attacks, a single learnable text
prompt has insufficient generalization to align well with all adversarial image
features, which finally leads to the overfitting phenomenon. To address the
above challenge, in this paper, we empirically find that increasing the number
of learned prompts can bring more robustness improvement than a longer prompt.
Then we propose an adversarial tuning method named Adversarial Mixture Prompt
Tuning (AMPT) to enhance the generalization towards various adversarial attacks
for VLMs. AMPT aims to learn mixture text prompts to obtain more robust text
features. To further enhance the adaptability, we propose a conditional weight
router based on the input adversarial image to predict the mixture weights of
multiple learned prompts, which helps obtain sample-specific aggregated text
features aligning with different adversarial image features. A series of
experiments show that our method can achieve better adversarial robustness than
state-of-the-art methods on 11 datasets under different experimental settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
significantly expanded their utility in tasks like image captioning and visual
question answering. However, they still struggle with object hallucination,
where models generate descriptions that inaccurately reflect the visual content
by including nonexistent objects or misrepresenting existing ones. While
previous methods, such as data augmentation and training-free approaches,
strive to tackle this issue, they still encounter scalability challenges and
often depend on additional external modules. In this work, we propose Ensemble
Decoding (ED), a novel strategy that splits the input image into sub-images and
combines logit distributions by assigning weights through the attention map.
Furthermore, we introduce ED adaptive plausibility constraint to calibrate
logit distribution and FastED, a variant designed for speed-critical
applications. Extensive experiments across hallucination benchmarks demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the
effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation, existing models
often struggle to faithfully capture user intentions from short and
under-specified prompts. While prior work has attempted to enhance prompts
using large language models (LLMs), these methods frequently generate stylistic
or unrealistic content due to insufficient grounding in visual semantics and
real-world composition. Inspired by recent advances in reasoning for language
model, we propose RePrompt, a novel reprompting framework that introduces
explicit reasoning into the prompt enhancement process via reinforcement
learning. Instead of relying on handcrafted rules or stylistic rewrites, our
method trains a language model to generate structured, self-reflective prompts
by optimizing for image-level outcomes. The tailored reward models assesse the
generated images in terms of human preference, semantic alignment, and visual
composition, providing indirect supervision to refine prompt generation. Our
approach enables end-to-end training without human-annotated data. Experiments
on GenEval and T2I-Compbench show that RePrompt significantly boosts spatial
layout fidelity and compositional generalization across diverse T2I backbones,
establishing new state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models have significantly
enhanced the quality of generated videos. However, their ability to produce
explicit or harmful content raises concerns about misuse and potential rights
violations. Inspired by the success of unlearning techniques in erasing
undesirable concepts from text-to-image (T2I) models, we extend unlearning to
T2V models and propose a robust and precise unlearning method. Specifically, we
adopt negatively-guided velocity prediction fine-tuning and enhance it with
prompt augmentation to ensure robustness against LLM-refined prompts. To
achieve precise unlearning, we incorporate a localization and a preservation
regularization to preserve the model's ability to generate non-target concepts.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively erases a specific
concept while preserving the model's generation capability for all other
concepts, outperforming existing methods. We provide the unlearned models in

Abstract: Anomaly detection plays a vital role in the inspection of industrial images.
Most existing methods require separate models for each category, resulting in
multiplied deployment costs. This highlights the challenge of developing a
unified model for multi-class anomaly detection. However, the significant
increase in inter-class interference leads to severe missed detections.
Furthermore, the intra-class overlap between normal and abnormal samples,
particularly in synthesis-based methods, cannot be ignored and may lead to
over-detection. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Center-aware
Residual Anomaly Synthesis (CRAS) method for multi-class anomaly detection.
CRAS leverages center-aware residual learning to couple samples from different
categories into a unified center, mitigating the effects of inter-class
interference. To further reduce intra-class overlap, CRAS introduces
distance-guided anomaly synthesis that adaptively adjusts noise variance based
on normal data distribution. Experimental results on diverse datasets and
real-world industrial applications demonstrate the superior detection accuracy
and competitive inference speed of CRAS. The source code and the newly
constructed dataset are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型表现优异，但其内部机制尚不明确，可能导致偏差放大或隐私泄露问题，因此需要深入研究。

Method: 通过部分绕过去噪过程中间块的贡献，临时增加生成过程的高方差，提出了一种无需训练的方法来提升生成图像质量。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，该方法能显著提高文本到图像和图像到图像生成的质量。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了扩散模型在偏差-方差权衡中的风险，并提出了一种有效的改进方法，为模型优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of generative Diffusion Models (DMs),
their internal working is still not well understood, which is potentially
problematic. This paper focuses on exploring the important notion of
bias-variance tradeoff in diffusion models. Providing a systematic foundation
for this exploration, it establishes that at one extreme the diffusion models
may amplify the inherent bias in the training data and, on the other, they may
compromise the presumed privacy of the training samples. Our exploration aligns
with the memorization-generalization understanding of the generative models,
but it also expands further along this spectrum beyond ``generalization'',
revealing the risk of bias amplification in deeper models. Building on the
insights, we also introduce a training-free method to improve output quality in
text-to-image and image-to-image generation. By progressively encouraging
temporary high variance in the generation process with partial bypassing of the
mid-block's contribution in the denoising process of DMs, our method
consistently improves generative image quality with zero training cost. Our
claims are validated both theoretically and empirically.

*Kwanyoung Kim,Sanghyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出ANSE框架，通过注意力不确定性选择高质量噪声种子，提升视频扩散模型的质量和时间一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 初始噪声选择对视频扩散模型生成质量影响显著，现有方法忽视模型内部信号，需改进。

Method: 提出ANSE框架，核心为BANSA函数，通过注意力熵分歧量化模型置信度，并引入Bernoulli掩码近似实现高效推理。

Result: 在CogVideoX-2B和5B上实验，ANSE提升视频质量和时间一致性，推理时间仅增加8%和13%。

Conclusion: ANSE为视频扩散中的噪声选择提供了原则性且可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: The choice of initial noise significantly affects the quality and prompt
alignment of video diffusion models, where different noise seeds for the same
prompt can lead to drastically different generations. While recent methods rely
on externally designed priors such as frequency filters or inter-frame
smoothing, they often overlook internal model signals that indicate which noise
seeds are inherently preferable. To address this, we propose ANSE (Active Noise
Selection for Generation), a model-aware framework that selects high-quality
noise seeds by quantifying attention-based uncertainty. At its core is BANSA
(Bayesian Active Noise Selection via Attention), an acquisition function that
measures entropy disagreement across multiple stochastic attention samples to
estimate model confidence and consistency. For efficient inference-time
deployment, we introduce a Bernoulli-masked approximation of BANSA that enables
score estimation using a single diffusion step and a subset of attention
layers. Experiments on CogVideoX-2B and 5B demonstrate that ANSE improves video
quality and temporal coherence with only an 8% and 13% increase in inference
time, respectively, providing a principled and generalizable approach to noise
selection in video diffusion. See our project page:

TL;DR: 利用人工智能提升雷达系统中多普勒分辨率，通过扩散模型的生成神经网络优化零填充FFT，有效分离密集目标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高多普勒分辨率对检测慢速目标至关重要，但硬件和物理因素限制了分辨率，需开发后处理技术。

Method: 基于零填充FFT，采用扩散模型的生成神经网络进行分辨率优化。

Result: 方法克服传统FFT限制，成功分离密集目标。

Conclusion: AI技术可有效提升雷达系统的多普勒分辨率。

Abstract: In radar systems, high resolution in the Doppler dimension is important for
detecting slow-moving targets as it allows for more distinct separation between
these targets and clutter, or stationary objects. However, achieving sufficient
resolution is constrained by hardware capabilities and physical factors,
leading to the development of processing techniques to enhance the resolution
after acquisition. In this work, we leverage artificial intelligence to
increase the Doppler resolution in range-Doppler maps. Based on a zero-padded
FFT, a refinement via the generative neural networks of diffusion models is
achieved. We demonstrate that our method overcomes the limitations of
traditional FFT, generating data where closely spaced targets are effectively
separated.

TL;DR: InfLVG是一个推理时框架，通过动态选择上下文来生成长视频，解决了传统自回归模型在生成长视频时的计算成本和一致性难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统文本到视频生成模型在生成长跨场景视频时面临计算成本高和一致性下降的问题。

Method: InfLVG采用可学习的上下文选择策略（GRPO优化），动态保留最相关的上下文，同时设计混合奖励函数优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，InfLVG能将视频长度扩展至9倍，保持跨场景的一致性和语义保真度。

Conclusion: InfLVG为生成长视频提供了一种高效且一致的方法，无需额外长视频数据。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation, particularly with autoregressive
models, have enabled the synthesis of high-quality videos depicting individual
scenes. However, extending these models to generate long, cross-scene videos
remains a significant challenge. As the context length grows during
autoregressive decoding, computational costs rise sharply, and the model's
ability to maintain consistency and adhere to evolving textual prompts
deteriorates. We introduce InfLVG, an inference-time framework that enables
coherent long video generation without requiring additional long-form video
data. InfLVG leverages a learnable context selection policy, optimized via
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to dynamically identify and retain
the most semantically relevant context throughout the generation process.
Instead of accumulating the entire generation history, the policy ranks and
selects the top-$K$ most contextually relevant tokens, allowing the model to
maintain a fixed computational budget while preserving content consistency and
prompt alignment. To optimize the policy, we design a hybrid reward function
that jointly captures semantic alignment, cross-scene consistency, and artifact
reduction. To benchmark performance, we introduce the Cross-scene Video
Benchmark (CsVBench) along with an Event Prompt Set (EPS) that simulates
complex multi-scene transitions involving shared subjects and varied
actions/backgrounds. Experimental results show that InfLVG can extend video
length by up to 9$\times$, achieving strong consistency and semantic fidelity
across scenes. Our code is available at https://github.com/MAPLE-AIGC/InfLVG.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为MODEM的方法，通过Morton-Order Degradation Estimation Mechanism（MODEM）和Dual Degradation Estimation Module（DDEM）来估计和恢复恶劣天气下的图像退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 恶劣天气导致的图像退化具有高度非均匀和空间异质性，传统方法难以有效处理。准确估计退化情况可以为恢复模型提供更有针对性的指导。

Method: MODEM结合了Morton-Order 2D-Selective-Scan Module（MOS2D）和DDEM，分别捕捉长距离依赖关系和分离全局与局部退化先验。

Result: 实验表明，MODEM在多个基准测试和天气类型中取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: MODEM通过动态条件化和上下文感知恢复，有效建模了复杂的退化动态。

Abstract: Restoring images degraded by adverse weather remains a significant challenge
due to the highly non-uniform and spatially heterogeneous nature of
weather-induced artifacts, e.g., fine-grained rain streaks versus widespread
haze. Accurately estimating the underlying degradation can intuitively provide
restoration models with more targeted and effective guidance, enabling adaptive
processing strategies. To this end, we propose a Morton-Order Degradation
Estimation Mechanism (MODEM) for adverse weather image restoration. Central to
MODEM is the Morton-Order 2D-Selective-Scan Module (MOS2D), which integrates
Morton-coded spatial ordering with selective state-space models to capture
long-range dependencies while preserving local structural coherence.
Complementing MOS2D, we introduce a Dual Degradation Estimation Module (DDEM)
that disentangles and estimates both global and local degradation priors. These
priors dynamically condition the MOS2D modules, facilitating adaptive and
context-aware restoration. Extensive experiments and ablation studies
demonstrate that MODEM achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple
benchmarks and weather types, highlighting its effectiveness in modeling
complex degradation dynamics. Our code will be released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D GANs在视角条件依赖下存在3D一致性问题，而固定视角则导致新视角性能差。CGS-GAN旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 引入多视角正则化技术，改进条件损失和生成器架构，确保训练稳定性和高效渲染。

Result: 在FFHQ衍生数据集上实现高质量渲染和3D一致性，支持高达2048^2分辨率。

Conclusion: CGS-GAN在3D一致性和渲染质量上表现优异，为3D GANs提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, 3D GANs based on 3D Gaussian splatting have been proposed for high
quality synthesis of human heads. However, existing methods stabilize training
and enhance rendering quality from steep viewpoints by conditioning the random
latent vector on the current camera position. This compromises 3D consistency,
as we observe significant identity changes when re-synthesizing the 3D head
with each camera shift. Conversely, fixing the camera to a single viewpoint
yields high-quality renderings for that perspective but results in poor
performance for novel views. Removing view-conditioning typically destabilizes
GAN training, often causing the training to collapse. In response to these
challenges, we introduce CGS-GAN, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting GAN framework
that enables stable training and high-quality 3D-consistent synthesis of human
heads without relying on view-conditioning. To ensure training stability, we
introduce a multi-view regularization technique that enhances generator
convergence with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, we adapt the
conditional loss used in existing 3D Gaussian splatting GANs and propose a
generator architecture designed to not only stabilize training but also
facilitate efficient rendering and straightforward scaling, enabling output
resolutions up to $2048^2$. To evaluate the capabilities of CGS-GAN, we curate
a new dataset derived from FFHQ. This dataset enables very high resolutions,
focuses on larger portions of the human head, reduces view-dependent artifacts
for improved 3D consistency, and excludes images where subjects are obscured by
hands or other objects. As a result, our approach achieves very high rendering
quality, supported by competitive FID scores, while ensuring consistent 3D
scene generation. Check our our project page here:

TL;DR: PathoSCOPE是一种少样本无监督病理检测框架，仅需少量非病理样本（最少2个），显著提高数据效率。通过全局-局部对比损失（GLCL）和病理感知嵌入生成（PiEG）模块，实现了高性能和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医院数据偏向有症状人群，隐私法规限制了健康数据的收集，导致构建可靠的无监督病理检测模型困难。

Method: 提出PathoSCOPE框架，结合GLCL损失（局部对比损失减少非病理嵌入变异性，全局对比损失增强病理区域区分）和PiEG模块（合成病理嵌入）。

Result: 在BraTS2020和ChestXray8数据集上，PathoSCOPE在无监督方法中达到最优性能，计算效率高（2.48 GFLOPs，166 FPS）。

Conclusion: PathoSCOPE通过少样本学习和合成病理嵌入，解决了数据偏差和隐私限制问题，显著提升了无监督病理检测的效率和性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised pathology detection trains models on non-pathological data to
flag deviations as pathologies, offering strong generalizability for
identifying novel diseases and avoiding costly annotations. However, building
reliable normality models requires vast healthy datasets, as hospitals' data is
inherently biased toward symptomatic populations, while privacy regulations
hinder the assembly of representative healthy cohorts. To address this
limitation, we propose PathoSCOPE, a few-shot unsupervised pathology detection
framework that requires only a small set of non-pathological samples (minimum 2
shots), significantly improving data efficiency. We introduce Global-Local
Contrastive Loss (GLCL), comprised of a Local Contrastive Loss to reduce the
variability of non-pathological embeddings and a Global Contrastive Loss to
enhance the discrimination of pathological regions. We also propose a
Pathology-informed Embedding Generation (PiEG) module that synthesizes
pathological embeddings guided by the global loss, better exploiting the
limited non-pathological samples. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 and ChestXray8
datasets, PathoSCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised
methods while maintaining computational efficiency (2.48 GFLOPs, 166 FPS).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着模型预训练的计算成本增加，测试时扩展（TTS）成为提升生成模型性能的有前景方向，但现有方法在视觉任务中存在局限性。

Method: EvoSearch将测试时扩展问题转化为进化搜索，利用生物进化原理优化去噪轨迹，设计了选择和变异机制。

Result: 实验表明，EvoSearch在图像和视频生成任务中优于现有方法，具有更高的多样性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: EvoSearch是一种通用且高效的TTS方法，适用于扩散和流模型，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: As the marginal cost of scaling computation (data and parameters) during
model pre-training continues to increase substantially, test-time scaling (TTS)
has emerged as a promising direction for improving generative model performance
by allocating additional computation at inference time. While TTS has
demonstrated significant success across multiple language tasks, there remains
a notable gap in understanding the test-time scaling behaviors of image and
video generative models (diffusion-based or flow-based models). Although recent
works have initiated exploration into inference-time strategies for vision
tasks, these approaches face critical limitations: being constrained to
task-specific domains, exhibiting poor scalability, or falling into reward
over-optimization that sacrifices sample diversity. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{Evo}lutionary \textbf{Search} (EvoSearch), a novel, generalist, and
efficient TTS method that effectively enhances the scalability of both image
and video generation across diffusion and flow models, without requiring
additional training or model expansion. EvoSearch reformulates test-time
scaling for diffusion and flow models as an evolutionary search problem,
leveraging principles from biological evolution to efficiently explore and
refine the denoising trajectory. By incorporating carefully designed selection
and mutation mechanisms tailored to the stochastic differential equation
denoising process, EvoSearch iteratively generates higher-quality offspring
while preserving population diversity. Through extensive evaluation across both
diffusion and flow architectures for image and video generation tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches,
achieves higher diversity, and shows strong generalizability to unseen
evaluation metrics. Our project is available at the website

Motivation: 现有图像质量评估（IQA）方法未充分利用辅助图像参考，且缺乏临床相关的细粒度指标，低质量合成血管造影可能增加手术风险。

Method: 提出CAS-IQA框架，构建CAS-3K数据集（3,565张合成血管造影图像），设计MUST模块自适应融合视觉特征，定义三种任务特定评估指标。

Result: 在CAS-3K数据集上的实验表明，CAS-IQA显著优于现有IQA方法。

Conclusion: CAS-IQA通过结合辅助信息和任务特定指标，为合成血管造影提供了可靠的临床相关质量评估。

Abstract: Synthetic X-ray angiographies generated by modern generative models hold
great potential to reduce the use of contrast agents in vascular interventional
procedures. However, low-quality synthetic angiographies can significantly
increase procedural risk, underscoring the need for reliable image quality
assessment (IQA) methods. Existing IQA models, however, fail to leverage
auxiliary images as references during evaluation and lack fine-grained,
task-specific metrics necessary for clinical relevance. To address these
limitations, this paper proposes CAS-IQA, a vision-language model (VLM)-based
framework that predicts fine-grained quality scores by effectively
incorporating auxiliary information from related images. In the absence of
angiography datasets, CAS-3K is constructed, comprising 3,565 synthetic
angiographies along with score annotations. To ensure clinically meaningful
assessment, three task-specific evaluation metrics are defined. Furthermore, a
Multi-path featUre fuSion and rouTing (MUST) module is designed to enhance
image representations by adaptively fusing and routing visual tokens to
metric-specific branches. Extensive experiments on the CAS-3K dataset
demonstrate that CAS-IQA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art IQA methods
by a considerable margin.

Conclusion: HoloLLM为多模态语言智能在现实世界的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in smart homes must understand human behavior
through diverse sensory inputs and communicate via natural language. While
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled impressive language-grounded
perception, their reliance on visual data limits robustness in real-world
scenarios with occlusions, poor lighting, or privacy constraints. In this
paper, we introduce HoloLLM, a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that
integrates uncommon but powerful sensing modalities, such as LiDAR, infrared,
mmWave radar, and WiFi, to enable seamless human perception and reasoning
across heterogeneous environments. We address two key challenges: (1) the
scarcity of aligned modality-text data for rare sensors, and (2) the
heterogeneity of their physical signal representations. To overcome these, we
design a Universal Modality-Injection Projector (UMIP) that enhances
pre-aligned modality embeddings with fine-grained, text-aligned features from
tailored encoders via coarse-to-fine cross-attention without introducing
significant alignment overhead. We further introduce a human-VLM collaborative
data curation pipeline to generate paired textual annotations for sensing
datasets. Extensive experiments on two newly constructed benchmarks show that
HoloLLM significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, improving language-grounded
human sensing accuracy by up to 30%. This work establishes a new foundation for
real-world, language-informed multisensory embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 现有方法仅针对特定遮挡物，难以应对真实世界中多样化的遮挡问题，因此需要一种通用解决方案。

Method: 将遮挡问题统一为软硬掩码修复任务，利用多模态提示（视觉语义和文本指令）通过交叉注意力单元增强上下文理解，并引入可调掩码适配器动态调整不准确的掩码。

Result: 在分布内和分布外遮挡实验中，Instruct2See均表现出强大的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Instruct2See提供了一种通用的遮挡去除方法，适用于各种遮挡场景，无需依赖训练数据中的遮挡类型。

Abstract: Images are often obstructed by various obstacles due to capture limitations,
hindering the observation of objects of interest. Most existing methods address
occlusions from specific elements like fences or raindrops, but are constrained
by the wide range of real-world obstructions, making comprehensive data
collection impractical. To overcome these challenges, we propose Instruct2See,
a novel zero-shot framework capable of handling both seen and unseen obstacles.
The core idea of our approach is to unify obstruction removal by treating it as
a soft-hard mask restoration problem, where any obstruction can be represented
using multi-modal prompts, such as visual semantics and textual instructions,
processed through a cross-attention unit to enhance contextual understanding
and improve mode control. Additionally, a tunable mask adapter allows for
dynamic soft masking, enabling real-time adjustment of inaccurate masks.
Extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution obstacles
show that Instruct2See consistently achieves strong performance and
generalization in obstruction removal, regardless of whether the obstacles were
present during the training phase. Code and dataset are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像分割因复杂的空间布局和多样化的物体外观而具有挑战性，传统CNN和Transformer各有局限性。

Method: RAPNet包含两个模块：Contextual Region Attention（CRA）和Global Class Refinement（GCR），通过区域级操作和全局类注意力图实现灵活且准确的分割。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，RAPNet优于现有方法，实现了更高的多类分割准确率。

Conclusion: RAPNet通过结合区域级和全局信息，显著提升了高分辨率遥感图像的分割性能。

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) image segmentation is challenging due
to complex spatial layouts and diverse object appearances. While CNNs excel at
capturing local features, they struggle with long-range dependencies, whereas
Transformers can model global context but often neglect local details and are
computationally expensive.We propose a novel approach, Region-Aware Proxy
Network (RAPNet), which consists of two components: Contextual Region Attention
(CRA) and Global Class Refinement (GCR). Unlike traditional methods that rely
on grid-based layouts, RAPNet operates at the region level for more flexible
segmentation. The CRA module uses a Transformer to capture region-level
contextual dependencies, generating a Semantic Region Mask (SRM). The GCR
module learns a global class attention map to refine multi-class information,
combining the SRM and attention map for accurate segmentation.Experiments on
three public datasets show that RAPNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior multi-class segmentation accuracy.

Conclusion: Proto-FG3D为细粒度3D形状分类提供了新范式，兼具高性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based multi-view coarse-grained 3D shape classification has
achieved remarkable success over the past decade, leveraging the powerful
feature learning capabilities of CNN-based and ViT-based backbones. However, as
a challenging research area critical for detailed shape understanding,
fine-grained 3D classification remains understudied due to the limited
discriminative information captured during multi-view feature aggregation,
particularly for subtle inter-class variations, class imbalance, and inherent
interpretability limitations of parametric model. To address these problems, we
propose the first prototype-based framework named Proto-FG3D for fine-grained
3D shape classification, achieving a paradigm shift from parametric softmax to
non-parametric prototype learning. Firstly, Proto-FG3D establishes joint
multi-view and multi-category representation learning via Prototype
Association. Secondly, prototypes are refined via Online Clustering, improving
both the robustness of multi-view feature allocation and inter-subclass
balance. Finally, prototype-guided supervised learning is established to
enhance fine-grained discrimination via prototype-view correlation analysis and
enables ad-hoc interpretability through transparent case-based reasoning.
Experiments on FG3D and ModelNet40 show Proto-FG3D surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in accuracy, transparent predictions, and ad-hoc interpretability with
visualizations, challenging conventional fine-grained 3D recognition
approaches.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于脉冲的视觉语言（SVL）预训练框架，通过多尺度三重对齐和可重参数化视觉语言集成，显著提升了脉冲神经网络（SNNs）在3D开放世界理解任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNNs由于预训练策略不足，在泛化能力、任务特异性和多模态理解方面表现不佳，尤其在零样本3D分类和多模态问答等复杂任务中。

Method: SVL框架包含多尺度三重对齐（MTA）进行跨模态对比学习，以及可重参数化视觉语言集成（Rep-VLI）实现轻量级推理。

Result: SVL在零样本3D分类中达到85.4%的Top-1准确率，超越先进ANN模型，并在多项下游任务中表现优异且高效。

Conclusion: SVL是首个可扩展、泛化能力强且硬件友好的3D开放世界理解范式，有效缩小了SNNs与ANNs在复杂任务中的差距。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an energy-efficient way to extract 3D
spatio-temporal features. However, existing SNNs still exhibit a significant
performance gap compared to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to inadequate
pre-training strategies. These limitations manifest as restricted
generalization ability, task specificity, and a lack of multimodal
understanding, particularly in challenging tasks such as multimodal question
answering and zero-shot 3D classification. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a Spike-based Vision-Language (SVL) pretraining framework that empowers
SNNs with open-world 3D understanding while maintaining spike-driven
efficiency. SVL introduces two key components: (i) Multi-scale Triple Alignment
(MTA) for label-free triplet-based contrastive learning across 3D, image, and
text modalities, and (ii) Re-parameterizable Vision-Language Integration
(Rep-VLI) to enable lightweight inference without relying on large text
encoders. Extensive experiments show that SVL achieves a top-1 accuracy of
85.4% in zero-shot 3D classification, surpassing advanced ANN models, and
consistently outperforms prior SNNs on downstream tasks, including 3D

Motivation: 由于缺乏真实、大规模的数据集和可靠的标注工具，眼科显微手术中手和器械的3D重建进展受限。

Method: 设计了多阶段自动标注流程，结合多视角数据、运动先验、几何一致性和生物力学约束。提出了H-Net和OH-Net模型，利用空间推理模块和碰撞感知表示。

Result: H-Net和OH-Net在MPJPE和ADD-S指标上分别实现了超过2mm和23%的提升。

Conclusion: OphNet-3D和提出的模型为眼科手术中的3D重建任务提供了新的解决方案和基准。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of hands and instruments is critical for
vision-based analysis of ophthalmic microsurgery, yet progress has been
hampered by the lack of realistic, large-scale datasets and reliable annotation
tools. In this work, we introduce OphNet-3D, the first extensive RGB-D dynamic
3D reconstruction dataset for ophthalmic surgery, comprising 41 sequences from
40 surgeons and totaling 7.1 million frames, with fine-grained annotations of
12 surgical phases, 10 instrument categories, dense MANO hand meshes, and full
6-DoF instrument poses. To scalably produce high-fidelity labels, we design a
multi-stage automatic annotation pipeline that integrates multi-view data
observation, data-driven motion prior with cross-view geometric consistency and
biomechanical constraints, along with a combination of collision-aware
interaction constraints for instrument interactions. Building upon OphNet-3D,
we establish two challenging benchmarks-bimanual hand pose estimation and
hand-instrument interaction reconstruction-and propose two dedicated
architectures: H-Net for dual-hand mesh recovery and OH-Net for joint
reconstruction of two-hand-two-instrument interactions. These models leverage a
novel spatial reasoning module with weak-perspective camera modeling and
collision-aware center-based representation. Both architectures outperform
existing methods by substantial margins, achieving improvements of over 2mm in
Mean Per Joint Position Error (MPJPE) and up to 23% in ADD-S metrics for hand
and instrument reconstruction, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于机器学习的5G室内定位方法在环境变化时性能显著下降，重新训练模型耗时耗资源。

Method: 提出基于切比雪夫距离的相似性感知采样技术，选择旧环境的代表性样本，仅在新环境的变化区域训练。

Result: 在动态环境条件下，定位误差MAE为0.261米，且仅需50个样本即可快速适应。

Conclusion: 5G-DIL方法高效适应环境变化，保持高定位精度，适用于实际非视距传播场景。

Abstract: Indoor positioning based on 5G data has achieved high accuracy through the
adoption of recent machine learning (ML) techniques. However, the performance
of learning-based methods degrades significantly when environmental conditions
change, thereby hindering their applicability to new scenarios. Acquiring new
training data for each environmental change and fine-tuning ML models is both
time-consuming and resource-intensive. This paper introduces a domain
incremental learning (DIL) approach for dynamic 5G indoor localization, called
5G-DIL, enabling rapid adaptation to environmental changes. We present a novel
similarity-aware sampling technique based on the Chebyshev distance, designed
to efficiently select specific exemplars from the previous environment while
training only on the modified regions of the new environment. This avoids the
need to train on the entire region, significantly reducing the time and
resources required for adaptation without compromising localization accuracy.
This approach requires as few as 50 exemplars from adaptation domains,
significantly reducing training time while maintaining high positioning
accuracy in previous environments. Comparative evaluations against
state-of-the-art DIL techniques on a challenging real-world indoor dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed sample selection method. Our
approach is adaptable to real-world non-line-of-sight propagation scenarios and
achieves an MAE positioning error of 0.261 meters, even under dynamic
environmental conditions. Code:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM通常使用离散文本CoT，导致时空关系模糊和细粒度信息丢失，因此需要一种更接近真实世界模拟的视觉推理方法。

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，推动了自动驾驶向视觉推理方向发展。

Conclusion: 时空CoT方法通过视觉推理提升了自动驾驶的建模能力。

Abstract: Visual language models (VLMs) have attracted increasing interest in
autonomous driving due to their powerful reasoning capabilities. However,
existing VLMs typically utilize discrete text Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tailored
to the current scenario, which essentially represents highly abstract and
symbolic compression of visual information, potentially leading to
spatio-temporal relationship ambiguity and fine-grained information loss. Is
autonomous driving better modeled on real-world simulation and imagination than
on pure symbolic logic? In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal CoT
reasoning method that enables models to think visually. First, VLM serves as a
world model to generate unified image frame for predicting future world states:
where perception results (e.g., lane divider and 3D detection) represent the
future spatial relationships, and ordinary future frame represent the temporal
evolution relationships. This spatio-temporal CoT then serves as intermediate
reasoning steps, enabling the VLM to function as an inverse dynamics model for
trajectory planning based on current observations and future predictions. To
implement visual generation in VLMs, we propose a unified pretraining paradigm
integrating visual generation and understanding, along with a progressive
visual CoT enhancing autoregressive image generation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, advancing
autonomous driving towards visual reasoning.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了半监督医学图像分割中的关键问题，性能优越。

Abstract: Traditional supervised medical image segmentation models require large
amounts of labeled data for training; however, obtaining such large-scale
labeled datasets in the real world is extremely challenging. Recent
semi-supervised segmentation models also suffer from noisy pseudo-label issue
and limited supervision in feature space. To solve these challenges, we propose
an innovative semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation method to reduce
the dependency on large, expert-labeled datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a
dual-network architecture to address the limitations of existing methods in
using contextual information and generating reliable pseudo-labels. In
addition, a self-supervised contrastive learning strategy is used to enhance
the representation of the network and reduce prediction uncertainty by
distinguishing between reliable and unreliable predictions. Experiments on
clinical magnetic resonance imaging demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art techniques. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViP²-CLIP通过视觉感知提示机制（ViP-Prompt）自适应生成细粒度文本提示，解决了零样本异常检测（ZSAD）中手工模板和静态可学习提示的局限性，提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的零样本异常检测方法依赖手工或静态提示，存在语义覆盖不足和适应性差的问题，且对类别名称敏感。

Method: 提出ViP²-CLIP，采用ViP-Prompt机制，融合全局和多尺度局部视觉上下文，自适应生成细粒度文本提示，无需手工模板和类别名称先验。

Result: 在15个工业和医学基准测试中，ViP²-CLIP实现了最先进的性能和强大的跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: ViP²-CLIP通过自适应提示机制显著提升了零样本异常检测的效果，适用于类别标签模糊或隐私受限的场景。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD) aims to detect anomalies without any
target domain training samples, relying solely on external auxiliary data.
Existing CLIP-based methods attempt to activate the model's ZSAD potential via
handcrafted or static learnable prompts. The former incur high engineering
costs and limited semantic coverage, whereas the latter apply identical
descriptions across diverse anomaly types, thus fail to adapt to complex
variations. Furthermore, since CLIP is originally pretrained on large-scale
classification tasks, its anomaly segmentation quality is highly sensitive to
the exact wording of class names, severely constraining prompting strategies
that depend on class labels. To address these challenges, we introduce
ViP$^{2}$-CLIP. The key insight of ViP$^{2}$-CLIP is a Visual-Perception
Prompting (ViP-Prompt) mechanism, which fuses global and multi-scale local
visual context to adaptively generate fine-grained textual prompts, eliminating
manual templates and class-name priors. This design enables our model to focus
on precise abnormal regions, making it particularly valuable when category
labels are ambiguous or privacy-constrained. Extensive experiments on 15
industrial and medical benchmarks demonstrate that ViP$^{2}$-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance and robust cross-domain generalization.

Result: 实验验证了Seek-CAD在多种指标下的有效性。

Conclusion: Seek-CAD为CAD生成提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，并推动了开源LLM在工业设计中的应用。

Abstract: The advent of Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling will
significantly transform the design of industrial products. The recent research
endeavor has extended into the realm of Large Language Models (LLMs). In
contrast to fine-tuning methods, training-free approaches typically utilize the
advanced closed-source LLMs, thereby offering enhanced flexibility and
efficiency in the development of AI agents for generating CAD parametric
models. However, the substantial cost and limitations of local deployment of
the top-tier closed-source LLMs pose challenges in practical applications. The
Seek-CAD is the pioneer exploration of locally deployed open-source inference
LLM DeepSeek-R1 for CAD parametric model generation with a training-free
methodology. This study is the first investigation to incorporate both visual
and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) feedback within the self-refinement mechanism for
generating CAD models. Specifically, the initial generated parametric CAD model
is rendered into a sequence of step-wise perspective images, which are
subsequently processed by a Vision Language Model (VLM) alongside the
corresponding CoTs derived from DeepSeek-R1 to assess the CAD model generation.
Then, the feedback is utilized by DeepSeek-R1 to refine the initial generated
model for the next round of generation. Moreover, we present an innovative 3D
CAD model dataset structured around the SSR (Sketch, Sketch-based feature, and
Refinements) triple design paradigm. This dataset encompasses a wide range of
CAD commands, thereby aligning effectively with industrial application
requirements and proving suitable for the generation of LLMs. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of Seek-CAD under various metrics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前点云生成模型缺乏对点级分割标签生成的关注，且缺乏相关评估指标。

Method: 采用语义部分感知潜在点扩散技术，联合预测噪声和分割标签，并引入p-CD作为评估指标。

Result: 在ShapeNet和IntrA数据集上，SeaLion在生成质量和多样性上显著优于DiffFacto。

Conclusion: SeaLion不仅减少了标注需求，还能用于数据增强和3D形状编辑。

Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models have achieved significant success in
point cloud generation, enabling numerous downstream applications, such as
generative data augmentation and 3D model editing. However, little attention
has been given to generating point clouds with point-wise segmentation labels,
as well as to developing evaluation metrics for this task. Therefore, in this
paper, we present SeaLion, a novel diffusion model designed to generate
high-quality and diverse point clouds with fine-grained segmentation labels.
Specifically, we introduce the semantic part-aware latent point diffusion
technique, which leverages the intermediate features of the generative models
to jointly predict the noise for perturbed latent points and associated part
segmentation labels during the denoising process, and subsequently decodes the
latent points to point clouds conditioned on part segmentation labels. To
effectively evaluate the quality of generated point clouds, we introduce a
novel point cloud pairwise distance calculation method named part-aware Chamfer
distance (p-CD). This method enables existing metrics, such as 1-NNA, to
measure both the local structural quality and inter-part coherence of generated
point clouds. Experiments on the large-scale synthetic dataset ShapeNet and
real-world medical dataset IntrA demonstrate that SeaLion achieves remarkable
performance in generation quality and diversity, outperforming the existing
state-of-the-art model, DiffFacto, by 13.33% and 6.52% on 1-NNA (p-CD) across
the two datasets. Experimental analysis shows that SeaLion can be trained
semi-supervised, thereby reducing the demand for labeling efforts. Lastly, we
validate the applicability of SeaLion in generative data augmentation for
training segmentation models and the capability of SeaLion to serve as a tool
for part-aware 3D shape editing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像标记方法仅捕捉全局抽象概念或均匀分割的图像块，限制了MLLMs在对象级别理解和生成详细视觉内容的能力。

Method: 基于Q-Former编码器、扩散解码器和残差向量量化，提出离散的slot tokens，既能编码局部视觉细节，又能保持高级语义并与文本数据对齐。

Result: Slot-MLLM在多种视觉语言任务中显著优于基线方法，特别是在局部细节理解和生成方面。

Conclusion: 首次证明了在MLLMs和自然图像中使用对象中心Slot Attention的可行性，为视觉语言任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a key
approach in achieving artificial general intelligence. In particular,
vision-language MLLMs have been developed to generate not only text but also
visual outputs from multimodal inputs. This advancement requires efficient
image tokens that LLMs can process effectively both in input and output.
However, existing image tokenization methods for MLLMs typically capture only
global abstract concepts or uniformly segmented image patches, restricting
MLLMs' capability to effectively understand or generate detailed visual
content, particularly at the object level. To address this limitation, we
propose an object-centric visual tokenizer based on Slot Attention specifically
for MLLMs. In particular, based on the Q-Former encoder, diffusion decoder, and
residual vector quantization, our proposed discretized slot tokens can encode
local visual details while maintaining high-level semantics, and also align
with textual data to be integrated seamlessly within a unified next-token
prediction framework of LLMs. The resulting Slot-MLLM demonstrates significant
performance improvements over baselines with previous visual tokenizers across
various vision-language tasks that entail local detailed comprehension and
generation. Notably, this work is the first demonstration of the feasibility of
object-centric slot attention performed with MLLMs and in-the-wild natural
images.

Conclusion: SafeMVDrive为测试自动驾驶规划模块提供了高质量的安全关键数据，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Safety-critical scenarios are rare yet pivotal for evaluating and enhancing
the robustness of autonomous driving systems. While existing methods generate
safety-critical driving trajectories, simulations, or single-view videos, they
fall short of meeting the demands of advanced end-to-end autonomous systems
(E2E AD), which require real-world, multi-view video data. To bridge this gap,
we introduce SafeMVDrive, the first framework designed to generate
high-quality, safety-critical, multi-view driving videos grounded in real-world
domains. SafeMVDrive strategically integrates a safety-critical trajectory
generator with an advanced multi-view video generator. To tackle the challenges
inherent in this integration, we first enhance scene understanding ability of
the trajectory generator by incorporating visual context -- which is previously
unavailable to such generator -- and leveraging a GRPO-finetuned
vision-language model to achieve more realistic and context-aware trajectory
generation. Second, recognizing that existing multi-view video generators
struggle to render realistic collision events, we introduce a two-stage,
controllable trajectory generation mechanism that produces collision-evasion
trajectories, ensuring both video quality and safety-critical fidelity.
Finally, we employ a diffusion-based multi-view video generator to synthesize
high-quality safety-critical driving videos from the generated trajectories.
Experiments conducted on an E2E AD planner demonstrate a significant increase
in collision rate when tested with our generated data, validating the
effectiveness of SafeMVDrive in stress-testing planning modules. Our code,
examples, and datasets are publicly available at:

Conclusion: RQR3D展示了其鲁棒性、精确性和实际应用潜力，为自动驾驶提供了更安全的3D感知解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate, fast, and reliable 3D perception is essential for autonomous
driving. Recently, bird's-eye view (BEV)-based perception approaches have
emerged as superior alternatives to perspective-based solutions, offering
enhanced spatial understanding and more natural outputs for planning. Existing
BEV-based 3D object detection methods, typically adhering to angle-based
representation, directly estimate the size and orientation of rotated bounding
boxes. We observe that BEV-based 3D object detection is analogous to aerial
oriented object detection, where angle-based methods are recognized for being
affected by discontinuities in their loss functions. Drawing inspiration from
this domain, we propose Restricted Quadrilateral Representation to define 3D
regression targets. RQR3D regresses the smallest horizontal bounding box
encapsulating the oriented box, along with the offsets between the corners of
these two boxes, thereby transforming the oriented object detection problem
into a keypoint regression task. RQR3D is compatible with any 3D object
detection approach. We employ RQR3D within an anchor-free single-stage object
detection method and introduce an objectness head to address class imbalance
problem. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified radar fusion backbone that
eliminates the need for voxel grouping and processes the BEV-mapped point cloud
with standard 2D convolutions, rather than sparse convolutions. Extensive
evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that RQR3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance in camera-radar 3D object detection, outperforming
the previous best method by +4% in NDS and +2.4% in mAP, and significantly
reducing the translation and orientation errors, which are crucial for safe
autonomous driving. These consistent gains highlight the robustness, precision,
and real-world readiness of our approach.

Abstract: While recent advances in image editing have enabled impressive visual
synthesis capabilities, current methods remain constrained by explicit textual
instructions and limited editing operations, lacking deep comprehension of
implicit user intentions and contextual reasoning. In this work, we introduce a
new image editing paradigm: reasoning-guided generative editing, which
synthesizes images based on complex, multi-faceted textual queries accepting
world knowledge and intention inference. To facilitate this task, we first
construct a comprehensive dataset featuring over 1,000 image-instruction-edit
triples that incorporate rich reasoning contexts and real-world knowledge. We
then propose R-Genie: a reasoning-guided generative image editor, which
synergizes the generation power of diffusion models with advanced reasoning
capabilities of multimodal large language models. R-Genie incorporates a
reasoning-attention mechanism to bridge linguistic understanding with visual
synthesis, enabling it to handle intricate editing requests involving abstract
user intentions and contextual reasoning relations. Extensive experimental
results validate that R-Genie can equip diffusion models with advanced
reasoning-based editing capabilities, unlocking new potentials for intelligent

Conclusion: TopoPoint通过联合优化端点与车道检测，有效提升拓扑推理性能，为自动驾驶提供更可靠的道路理解。

Abstract: Topology reasoning, which unifies perception and structured reasoning, plays
a vital role in understanding intersections for autonomous driving. However,
its performance heavily relies on the accuracy of lane detection, particularly
at connected lane endpoints. Existing methods often suffer from lane endpoints
deviation, leading to incorrect topology construction. To address this issue,
we propose TopoPoint, a novel framework that explicitly detects lane endpoints
and jointly reasons over endpoints and lanes for robust topology reasoning.
During training, we independently initialize point and lane query, and proposed
Point-Lane Merge Self-Attention to enhance global context sharing through
incorporating geometric distances between points and lanes as an attention mask
. We further design Point-Lane Graph Convolutional Network to enable mutual
feature aggregation between point and lane query. During inference, we
introduce Point-Lane Geometry Matching algorithm that computes distances
between detected points and lanes to refine lane endpoints, effectively
mitigating endpoint deviation. Extensive experiments on the OpenLane-V2
benchmark demonstrate that TopoPoint achieves state-of-the-art performance in
topology reasoning (48.8 on OLS). Additionally, we propose DET$_p$ to evaluate
endpoint detection, under which our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches (52.6 v.s. 45.2 on DET$_p$). The code is released at

Conclusion: TextFlux展示了扩散模型在多语言场景文本合成中的潜力，简化了训练流程并提升了生成灵活性。

Abstract: Diffusion-based scene text synthesis has progressed rapidly, yet existing
methods commonly rely on additional visual conditioning modules and require
large-scale annotated data to support multilingual generation. In this work, we
revisit the necessity of complex auxiliary modules and further explore an
approach that simultaneously ensures glyph accuracy and achieves high-fidelity
scene integration, by leveraging diffusion models' inherent capabilities for
contextual reasoning. To this end, we introduce TextFlux, a DiT-based framework
that enables multilingual scene text synthesis. The advantages of TextFlux can
be summarized as follows: (1) OCR-free model architecture. TextFlux eliminates
the need for OCR encoders (additional visual conditioning modules) that are
specifically used to extract visual text-related features. (2) Strong
multilingual scalability. TextFlux is effective in low-resource multilingual
settings, and achieves strong performance in newly added languages with fewer
than 1,000 samples. (3) Streamlined training setup. TextFlux is trained with
only 1% of the training data required by competing methods. (4) Controllable
multi-line text generation. TextFlux offers flexible multi-line synthesis with
precise line-level control, outperforming methods restricted to single-line or
rigid layouts. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that
TextFlux outperforms previous methods in both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声图像解读因操作者、噪声和解剖结构差异而具有挑战性，而LVLMs在超声领域的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: U2-BENCH整合了7,241个病例，涵盖15个解剖区域和8个临床任务，评估了20种LVLMs的性能。

Result: LVLMs在图像分类任务上表现优异，但在空间推理和临床语言生成方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: U2-BENCH为超声领域的LVLM研究提供了严格的测试平台，推动了多模态医学影像研究的发展。

Abstract: Ultrasound is a widely-used imaging modality critical to global healthcare,
yet its interpretation remains challenging due to its varying image quality on
operators, noises, and anatomical structures. Although large vision-language
models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal capabilities across
natural and medical domains, their performance on ultrasound remains largely
unexplored. We introduce U2-BENCH, the first comprehensive benchmark to
evaluate LVLMs on ultrasound understanding across classification, detection,
regression, and text generation tasks. U2-BENCH aggregates 7,241 cases spanning
15 anatomical regions and defines 8 clinically inspired tasks, such as
diagnosis, view recognition, lesion localization, clinical value estimation,
and report generation, across 50 ultrasound application scenarios. We evaluate
20 state-of-the-art LVLMs, both open- and closed-source, general-purpose and
medical-specific. Our results reveal strong performance on image-level
classification, but persistent challenges in spatial reasoning and clinical
language generation. U2-BENCH establishes a rigorous and unified testbed to
assess and accelerate LVLM research in the uniquely multimodal domain of
medical ultrasound imaging.

TL;DR: 论文提出了Hephaestus Minicubes数据集，用于支持火山活动监测的深度学习研究，包含多源、多时空数据，并提供了专家标注和基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火山形变是火山喷发的重要前兆信号，但深度学习在该领域的应用因缺乏标注数据集而受限。

Method: 基于Hephaestus数据集扩展，构建了包含38个时空数据立方体的Hephaestus Minicubes，整合了InSAR、地形和大气数据，并提供专家标注。

Result: 数据集支持多模态、多时空分类和语义分割任务，并通过基准测试验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了机器学习在火山监测中的应用，促进了数据驱动方法在地球科学中的整合。

Abstract: Ground deformation is regarded in volcanology as a key precursor signal
preceding volcanic eruptions. Satellite-based Interferometric Synthetic
Aperture Radar (InSAR) enables consistent, global-scale deformation tracking;
however, deep learning methods remain largely unexplored in this domain, mainly
due to the lack of a curated machine learning dataset. In this work, we build
on the existing Hephaestus dataset, and introduce Hephaestus Minicubes, a
global collection of 38 spatiotemporal datacubes offering high resolution,
multi-source and multi-temporal information, covering 44 of the world's most
active volcanoes over a 7-year period. Each spatiotemporal datacube integrates
InSAR products, topographic data, as well as atmospheric variables which are
known to introduce signal delays that can mimic ground deformation in InSAR
imagery. Furthermore, we provide expert annotations detailing the type,
intensity and spatial extent of deformation events, along with rich text
descriptions of the observed scenes. Finally, we present a comprehensive
benchmark, demonstrating Hephaestus Minicubes' ability to support volcanic
unrest monitoring as a multi-modal, multi-temporal classification and semantic
segmentation task, establishing strong baselines with state-of-the-art
architectures. This work aims to advance machine learning research in volcanic
monitoring, contributing to the growing integration of data-driven methods
within Earth science applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成式数据增强方法（GDA），用于点云分割任务，通过生成高质量的点云和伪标签样本，显著提升了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强方法（TDA）在点云分割任务中效果有限，而现有的生成模型缺乏语义标签。本文旨在结合扩散模型与数据增强技术，解决数据稀缺问题。

Method: 扩展了3D扩散模型Lion，使其能够基于分割掩码生成高质量点云，并提出了一个三步GDA流程，包括生成变体和伪标签样本，以及基于扩散的伪标签过滤方法。

Result: 在两个大规模合成数据集和一个真实医学数据集上的实验表明，GDA方法优于TDA及相关半监督和自监督方法。

Conclusion: GDA方法通过生成高质量数据和伪标签，有效提升了点云分割任务的性能，为数据稀缺问题提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used to train deep learning models to address
data scarcity. However, traditional data augmentation (TDA) typically relies on
simple geometric transformation, such as random rotation and rescaling,
resulting in minimal data diversity enrichment and limited model performance
improvement. State-of-the-art generative models for 3D shape generation rely on
the denoising diffusion probabilistic models and manage to generate realistic
novel point clouds for 3D content creation and manipulation. Nevertheless, the
generated 3D shapes lack associated point-wise semantic labels, restricting
their usage in enlarging the training data for point cloud segmentation tasks.
To bridge the gap between data augmentation techniques and the advanced
diffusion models, we extend the state-of-the-art 3D diffusion model, Lion, to a
part-aware generative model that can generate high-quality point clouds
conditioned on given segmentation masks. Leveraging the novel generative model,
we introduce a 3-step generative data augmentation (GDA) pipeline for point
cloud segmentation training. Our GDA approach requires only a small amount of
labeled samples but enriches the training data with generated variants and
pseudo-labeled samples, which are validated by a novel diffusion-based
pseudo-label filtering method. Extensive experiments on two large-scale
synthetic datasets and a real-world medical dataset demonstrate that our GDA
method outperforms TDA approach and related semi-supervised and self-supervised
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DetailFusion的双分支框架，通过全局与细节信息的协调，提升组合图像检索（CIR）的细粒度处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在全局信息融合上表现不足，难以处理细微视觉变化或复杂文本指令。

Method: 采用双分支框架，结合图像编辑数据集中的细节变化先验，设计细节导向推理分支和自适应特征融合器。

Result: 在CIRR和FashionIQ数据集上达到最优性能，验证了细节增强的有效性和跨领域适应性。

Conclusion: DetailFusion通过全局与细节信息的动态融合，显著提升了CIR的细粒度检索能力。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images from a gallery
based on a reference image and modification text as a combined query. Recent
approaches focus on balancing global information from two modalities and encode
the query into a unified feature for retrieval. However, due to insufficient
attention to fine-grained details, these coarse fusion methods often struggle
with handling subtle visual alterations or intricate textual instructions. In
this work, we propose DetailFusion, a novel dual-branch framework that
effectively coordinates information across global and detailed granularities,
thereby enabling detail-enhanced CIR. Our approach leverages atomic detail
variation priors derived from an image editing dataset, supplemented by a
detail-oriented optimization strategy to develop a Detail-oriented Inference
Branch. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Feature Compositor that dynamically
fuses global and detailed features based on fine-grained information of each
unique multimodal query. Extensive experiments and ablation analyses not only
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both CIRR
and FashionIQ datasets but also validate the effectiveness and cross-domain
adaptability of detail enhancement for CIR.

*Ping Li,Jianan Ni,Bo Pang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种背景混合诱导的时间一致性（BMTC）攻击方法，通过减少源模型与目标模型的依赖性并确保攻击方向的明确性，显著提高了对抗样本的可迁移性。

Conclusion: BMTC方法通过减少模型依赖性和明确攻击方向，有效提升了对抗样本的可迁移性和攻击效果。

Abstract: Action recognition models using deep learning are vulnerable to adversarial
examples, which are transferable across other models trained on the same data
modality. Existing transferable attack methods face two major challenges: 1)
they heavily rely on the assumption that the decision boundaries of the
surrogate (a.k.a., source) model and the target model are similar, which limits
the adversarial transferability; and 2) their decision boundary difference
makes the attack direction uncertain, which may result in the gradient
oscillation, weakening the adversarial attack. This motivates us to propose a
Background Mixup-induced Temporal Consistency (BMTC) attack method for action
recognition. From the input transformation perspective, we design a
model-agnostic background adversarial mixup module to reduce the
surrogate-target model dependency. In particular, we randomly sample one video
from each category and make its background frame, while selecting the
background frame with the top attack ability for mixup with the clean frame by
reinforcement learning. Moreover, to ensure an explicit attack direction, we
leverage the background category as guidance for updating the gradient of
adversarial example, and design a temporal gradient consistency loss, which
strengthens the stability of the attack direction on subsequent frames.
Empirical studies on two video datasets, i.e., UCF101 and Kinetics-400, and one
image dataset, i.e., ImageNet, demonstrate that our method significantly boosts
the transferability of adversarial examples across several action/image
recognition models. Our code is available at

Result: 实验证明VaLSe是有效的解释工具，能提升模型鲁棒性，同时揭示现有评估指标的局限性。

Conclusion: VaLSe为解决物体幻觉问题提供了新方法，并呼吁未来开发更细致的评估基准。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success but
continue to struggle with object hallucination (OH), generating outputs
inconsistent with visual inputs. While previous work has proposed methods to
reduce OH, the visual decision-making mechanisms that lead to hallucinations
remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose VaLSe, a Vision-aware
Latent Steering framework that adopts an interpretation-then-mitigation
strategy to address OH in LVLMs. By tackling dual challenges of modeling
complex vision-language interactions and eliminating spurious activation
artifacts, VaLSe can generate visual contribution maps that trace how specific
visual inputs influence individual output tokens. These maps reveal the model's
vision-aware focus regions, which are then used to perform latent space
steering, realigning internal representations toward semantically relevant
content and reducing hallucinated outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that VaLSe is a powerful interpretability tool and an effective method for
enhancing model robustness against OH across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore,
our analysis uncovers limitations in existing OH evaluation metrics,
underscoring the need for more nuanced, interpretable, and visually grounded OH
benchmarks in future work. Code is available at:

Result: 在5个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ICPL框架有效解决了多光谱目标重识别中的模态差异和语义对齐问题。

Abstract: Multi-spectral object re-identification (ReID) brings a new perception
perspective for smart city and intelligent transportation applications,
effectively addressing challenges from complex illumination and adverse
weather. However, complex modal differences between heterogeneous spectra pose
challenges to efficiently utilizing complementary and discrepancy of spectra
information. Most existing methods fuse spectral data through intricate modal
interaction modules, lacking fine-grained semantic understanding of spectral
information (\textit{e.g.}, text descriptions, part masks, and object
keypoints). To solve this challenge, we propose a novel Identity-Conditional
text Prompt Learning framework (ICPL), which exploits the powerful cross-modal
alignment capability of CLIP, to unify different spectral visual features from
text semantics. Specifically, we first propose the online prompt learning using
learnable text prompt as the identity-level semantic center to bridge the
identity semantics of different spectra in online manner. Then, in lack of
concrete text descriptions, we propose the multi-spectral identity-condition
module to use identity prototype as spectral identity condition to constraint
prompt learning. Meanwhile, we construct the alignment loop mutually optimizing
the learnable text prompt and spectral visual encoder to avoid online prompt
learning disrupting the pre-trained text-image alignment distribution. In
addition, to adapt to small-scale multi-spectral data and mitigate style
differences between spectra, we propose multi-spectral adapter that employs a
low-rank adaption method to learn spectra-specific features. Comprehensive
experiments on 5 benchmarks, including RGBNT201, Market-MM, MSVR310, RGBN300,
and RGBNT100, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模高维数据集中高效寻找高质量硬负样本的计算挑战。

Method: 使用LSH将实值特征向量量化为二进制表示，进行近似最近邻搜索。

Result: 在多个文本和视觉数据集上表现优于现有硬负样本挖掘策略，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 提出的LSH方案在保持或提升性能的同时，显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is a representational learning paradigm in which a
neural network maps data elements to feature vectors. It improves the feature
space by forming lots with an anchor and examples that are either positive or
negative based on class similarity. Hard negative examples, which are close to
the anchor in the feature space but from a different class, improve learning
performance. Finding such examples of high quality efficiently in large,
high-dimensional datasets is computationally challenging. In this paper, we
propose a GPU-friendly Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) scheme that quantizes
real-valued feature vectors into binary representations for approximate nearest
neighbor search. We investigate its theoretical properties and evaluate it on
several datasets from textual and visual domain. Our approach achieves
comparable or better performance while requiring significantly less computation
than existing hard negative mining strategies.

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，多任务学习优于单任务学习。

Conclusion: 多任务学习能更高效、鲁棒且泛化地处理动作和手势识别任务。

Abstract: In practical applications, computer vision tasks often need to be addressed
simultaneously. Multitask learning typically achieves this by jointly training
a single deep neural network to learn shared representations, providing
efficiency and improving generalization. Although action and gesture
recognition are closely related tasks, since they focus on body and hand
movements, current state-of-the-art methods handle them separately. In this
paper, we show that employing a multi-task learning paradigm for action and
gesture recognition results in more efficient, robust and generalizable visual
representations, by leveraging the synergies between these tasks. Extensive
experiments on multiple action and gesture datasets demonstrate that handling
actions and gestures in a single architecture can achieve better performance
for both tasks in comparison to their single-task learning variants.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在检测精度上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: HAD-EUNTRFR通过优化背景和异常组件的建模，显著提升了高光谱异常检测性能。

Abstract: In recent years, tensor decomposition-based approaches for hyperspectral
anomaly detection (HAD) have gained significant attention in the field of
remote sensing. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage both the
global correlations and local smoothness of the background components in
hyperspectral images (HSIs), which exist in both the spectral and spatial
domains. This limitation results in suboptimal detection performance. To
mitigate this critical issue, we put forward a novel HAD method named
HAD-EUNTRFR, which incorporates an enhanced unified nonconvex tensor ring (TR)
factors regularization. In the HAD-EUNTRFR framework, the raw HSIs are first
decomposed into background and anomaly components. The TR decomposition is then
employed to capture the spatial-spectral correlations within the background
component. Additionally, we introduce a unified and efficient nonconvex
regularizer, induced by tensor singular value decomposition (TSVD), to
simultaneously encode the low-rankness and sparsity of the 3-D gradient TR
factors into a unique concise form. The above characterization scheme enables
the interpretable gradient TR factors to inherit the low-rankness and
smoothness of the original background. To further enhance anomaly detection, we
design a generalized nonconvex regularization term to exploit the group
sparsity of the anomaly component. To solve the resulting doubly nonconvex
model, we develop a highly efficient optimization algorithm based on the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework. Experimental
results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of detection
accuracy.

Result: 协调后的临床+肿瘤放射组学模型性能最佳（C-index=0.7552），预训练基础模型特征结合临床数据表现最高（C-index=0.7616），共识模型覆盖78%测试病例，t-AUC达0.92。

Conclusion: 多区域特征整合与协调显著提升生存预测效果，结合放射组学、基础模型特征和共识建模可实现稳健的风险分层。

Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate the impact of harmonization and multi-region CT image
feature integration on survival prediction in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients, using handcrafted radiomics, pretrained foundation model (FM)
features, and clinical data from a multicenter dataset.
  Methods: We analyzed CT scans and clinical data from 876 NSCLC patients (604
training, 272 test) across five centers. Features were extracted from the whole
lung, tumor, mediastinal nodes, coronary arteries, and coronary artery calcium
(CAC). Handcrafted radiomics and FM deep features were harmonized using ComBat,
reconstruction kernel normalization (RKN), and RKN+ComBat. Regularized Cox
models predicted overall survival; performance was assessed using the
concordance index (C-index), 5-year time-dependent area under the curve
(t-AUC), and hazard ratio (HR). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values
explained feature contributions. A consensus model used agreement across top
region of interest (ROI) models to stratify patient risk.
  Results: TNM staging showed prognostic utility (C-index = 0.67; HR = 2.70;
t-AUC = 0.85). The clinical + tumor radiomics model with ComBat achieved a
C-index of 0.7552 and t-AUC of 0.8820. FM features (50-voxel cubes) combined
with clinical data yielded the highest performance (C-index = 0.7616; t-AUC =
0.8866). An ensemble of all ROIs and FM features reached a C-index of 0.7142
and t-AUC of 0.7885. The consensus model, covering 78% of valid test cases,
achieved a t-AUC of 0.92, sensitivity of 97.6%, and specificity of 66.7%.
  Conclusion: Harmonization and multi-region feature integration improve
survival prediction in multicenter NSCLC data. Combining interpretable
radiomics, FM features, and consensus modeling enables robust risk
stratification across imaging centers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中，像素级标注难以获取，需要一种兼容性强、能利用多种反馈（如解析质量反馈）训练语义分割网络的方法。

Method: RSS结合了渐进尺度奖励（PSR）和成对空间差异（PSD）等技术，确保奖励机制促进网络收敛，尤其在图像级奖励下。

Result: 实验表明，RSS能成功实现两种粒度奖励下的网络收敛，且图像级奖励的RSS优于现有仅依赖图像级信号的弱监督方法。

Conclusion: RSS为语义分割提供了一种灵活且高效的训练框架，尤其在标注资源有限的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: In real-world scenarios, pixel-level labeling is not always available.
Sometimes, we need a semantic segmentation network, and even a visual encoder
can have a high compatibility, and can be trained using various types of
feedback beyond traditional labels, such as feedback that indicates the quality
of the parsing results. To tackle this issue, we proposed RSS (Reward in
Semantic Segmentation), the first practical application of reward-based
reinforcement learning on pure semantic segmentation offered in two granular
levels (pixel-level and image-level). RSS incorporates various novel
technologies, such as progressive scale rewards (PSR) and pair-wise spatial
difference (PSD), to ensure that the reward facilitates the convergence of the
semantic segmentation network, especially under image-level rewards.
Experiments and visualizations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed RSS can successfully ensure the convergence of the semantic
segmentation network on two levels of rewards. Additionally, the RSS, which
utilizes an image-level reward, outperforms existing weakly supervised methods
that also rely solely on image-level signals during training.

Abstract: Reward Feedback Learning (ReFL) has recently shown great potential in
aligning model outputs with human preferences across various generative tasks.
In this work, we introduce a ReFL framework, named DiffusionReward, to the
Blind Face Restoration task for the first time. DiffusionReward effectively
overcomes the limitations of diffusion-based methods, which often fail to
generate realistic facial details and exhibit poor identity consistency. The
core of our framework is the Face Reward Model (FRM), which is trained using
carefully annotated data. It provides feedback signals that play a pivotal role
in steering the optimization process of the restoration network. In particular,
our ReFL framework incorporates a gradient flow into the denoising process of
off-the-shelf face restoration methods to guide the update of model parameters.
The guiding gradient is collaboratively determined by three aspects: (i) the
FRM to ensure the perceptual quality of the restored faces; (ii) a
regularization term that functions as a safeguard to preserve generative
diversity; and (iii) a structural consistency constraint to maintain facial
fidelity. Furthermore, the FRM undergoes dynamic optimization throughout the
process. It not only ensures that the restoration network stays precisely
aligned with the real face manifold, but also effectively prevents reward
hacking. Experiments on synthetic and wild datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving identity
consistency and facial details. The source codes, data, and models are

TL;DR: OCGNet提出了一种基于对象级别的跨视角地理定位方法，通过高斯核传递和双嵌入机制提升定位精度，适用于搜索救援等应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像级定位无法满足对象级精度需求，如搜索救援和基础设施检查。

Method: 结合高斯核传递（GKT）、位置增强（LE）模块和多头交叉注意力（MHCA）模块，实现对象级定位。

Result: 在CVOGL数据集上达到最优性能，并展示少样本学习能力。

Conclusion: OCGNet在对象级跨视角地理定位中表现出色，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization determines the location of a query image,
captured by a drone or ground-based camera, by matching it to a geo-referenced
satellite image. While traditional approaches focus on image-level
localization, many applications, such as search-and-rescue, infrastructure
inspection, and precision delivery, demand object-level accuracy. This enables
users to prompt a specific object with a single click on a drone image to
retrieve precise geo-tagged information of the object. However, variations in
viewpoints, timing, and imaging conditions pose significant challenges,
especially when identifying visually similar objects in extensive satellite
imagery. To address these challenges, we propose an Object-level Cross-view
Geo-localization Network (OCGNet). It integrates user-specified click locations
using Gaussian Kernel Transfer (GKT) to preserve location information
throughout the network. This cue is dually embedded into the feature encoder
and feature matching blocks, ensuring robust object-specific localization.
Additionally, OCGNet incorporates a Location Enhancement (LE) module and a
Multi-Head Cross Attention (MHCA) module to adaptively emphasize
object-specific features or expand focus to relevant contextual regions when
necessary. OCGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public dataset,
CVOGL. It also demonstrates few-shot learning capabilities, effectively
generalizing from limited examples, making it suitable for diverse applications
(https://github.com/ZheyangH/OCGNet).

Result: 原型网络仅用25%训练数据即可达到或优于传统深度学习模型的性能。

Conclusion: 少样本学习方法在数据稀缺或罕见类别情况下仍能有效分类肾结石类型。

Abstract: Determining the type of kidney stones is crucial for prescribing appropriate
treatments to prevent recurrence. Currently, various approaches exist to
identify the type of kidney stones. However, obtaining results through the
reference ex vivo identification procedure can take several weeks, while in
vivo visual recognition requires highly trained specialists. For this reason,
deep learning models have been developed to provide urologists with an
automated classification of kidney stones during ureteroscopies. Nevertheless,
a common issue with these models is the lack of training data. This
contribution presents a deep learning method based on few-shot learning, aimed
at producing sufficiently discriminative features for identifying kidney stone
types in endoscopic images, even with a very limited number of samples. This
approach was specifically designed for scenarios where endoscopic images are
scarce or where uncommon classes are present, enabling classification even with
a limited training dataset. The results demonstrate that Prototypical Networks,
using up to 25% of the training data, can achieve performance equal to or
better than traditional deep learning models trained with the complete dataset.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, yet current deep
learning methods often demand extensive expert effort, i.e., either through
annotating large training datasets or providing prompts at inference time for
each new case. This paper introduces a zero-shot and automatic segmentation
pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language and segmentation
foundation models. Given a medical image and a task definition (e.g., "segment
the optic disc in an eye fundus image"), our method uses a grounding model to
generate an initial bounding box, followed by a visual prompt boosting module
that enhance the prompts, which are then processed by a promptable segmentation
model to produce the final mask. To address the challenges of domain gap and
result verification, we introduce a test-time adaptation framework featuring a
set of learnable adaptors that align the medical inputs with foundation model
representations. Its hyperparameters are optimized via Bayesian Optimization,
guided by a proxy validation model without requiring ground-truth labels. Our
pipeline offers an annotation-efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot
medical image segmentation across diverse tasks. Our pipeline is evaluated on
seven diverse medical imaging datasets and shows promising results. By proper
decomposition and test-time adaptation, our fully automatic pipeline performs
competitively with weakly-prompted interactive foundation models.

Motivation: 解决大规模无界场景中高保真渲染的挑战，尤其是全局一致性和局部细节保留的问题。

Method: 1. 跨结构协作模块结合全局三平面表示和局部上下文网格特征；2. 跨视图辅助训练策略，通过梯度同步和可见性感知优化多视图一致性。

Result: 在13个多样化大规模场景中，PSNR提升1-2 dB，SSIM提升0.1-0.2，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SplatCo为大规模无界场景的高保真渲染设定了新基准。

Abstract: We present SplatCo, a structure-view collaborative Gaussian splatting
framework for high-fidelity rendering of complex outdoor environments. SplatCo
builds upon two novel components: (1) a cross-structure collaboration module
that combines global tri-plane representations, which capture coarse scene
layouts, with local context grid features that represent fine surface details.
This fusion is achieved through a novel hierarchical compensation strategy,
ensuring both global consistency and local detail preservation; and (2) a
cross-view assisted training strategy that enhances multi-view consistency by
synchronizing gradient updates across viewpoints, applying visibility-aware
densification, and pruning overfitted or inaccurate Gaussians based on
structural consistency. Through joint optimization of structural representation
and multi-view coherence, SplatCo effectively reconstructs fine-grained
geometric structures and complex textures in large-scale scenes. Comprehensive
evaluations on 13 diverse large-scale scenes, including Mill19, MatrixCity,
Tanks & Temples, WHU, and custom aerial captures, demonstrate that SplatCo
consistently achieves higher reconstruction quality than state-of-the-art
methods, with PSNR improvements of 1-2 dB and SSIM gains of 0.1 to 0.2. These
results establish a new benchmark for high-fidelity rendering of large-scale
unbounded scenes. Code and additional information are available at

Abstract: Understanding visual scenes is fundamental to human intelligence. While
discriminative models have significantly advanced computer vision, they often
struggle with compositional understanding. In contrast, recent generative
text-to-image diffusion models excel at synthesizing complex scenes, suggesting
inherent compositional capabilities. Building on this, zero-shot diffusion
classifiers have been proposed to repurpose diffusion models for discriminative
tasks. While prior work offered promising results in discriminative
compositional scenarios, these results remain preliminary due to a small number
of benchmarks and a relatively shallow analysis of conditions under which the
models succeed. To address this, we present a comprehensive study of the
discriminative capabilities of diffusion classifiers on a wide range of
compositional tasks. Specifically, our study covers three diffusion models (SD
1.5, 2.0, and, for the first time, 3-m) spanning 10 datasets and over 30 tasks.
Further, we shed light on the role that target dataset domains play in
respective performance; to isolate the domain effects, we introduce a new
diagnostic benchmark Self-Bench comprised of images created by diffusion models
themselves. Finally, we explore the importance of timestep weighting and
uncover a relationship between domain gap and timestep sensitivity,
particularly for SD3-m. To sum up, diffusion classifiers understand
compositionality, but conditions apply! Code and dataset are available at

Abstract: Owing to the typical long-tail data distribution issues, simulating
domain-gap-free synthetic data is crucial in robotics, photogrammetry, and
computer vision research. The fundamental challenge pertains to credibly
measuring the difference between real and simulated data. Such a measure is
vital for safety-critical applications, such as automated driving, where
out-of-domain samples may impact a car's perception and cause fatal accidents.
Previous work has commonly focused on simulating data on one scene and
analyzing performance on a different, real-world scene, hampering the disjoint
analysis of domain gap coming from networks' deficiencies, class definitions,
and object representation. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
measuring the domain gap between the real world sensor observations and
simulated data representing the same location, enabling comprehensive domain
gap analysis. To measure such a domain gap, we introduce a novel metric
DoGSS-PCL and evaluation assessing the geometric and semantic quality of the
simulated point cloud. Our experiments corroborate that the introduced approach
can be used to measure the domain gap. The tests also reveal that synthetic
semantic point clouds may be used for training deep neural networks,
maintaining the performance at the 50/50 real-to-synthetic ratio. We strongly
believe that this work will facilitate research on credible data simulation and
allow for at-scale deployment in automated driving testing and digital
twinning.

Conclusion: MR-EEGWaveNet在多分辨率特征提取和后处理技术的支持下，显著优于传统非多分辨率方法，为癫痫检测提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Feature engineering for generalized seizure detection models remains a
significant challenge. Recently proposed models show variable performance
depending on the training data and remain ineffective at accurately
distinguishing artifacts from seizure data. In this study, we propose a novel
end-to-end model, ''Multiresolutional EEGWaveNet (MR-EEGWaveNet),'' which
efficiently distinguishes seizure events from background electroencephalogram
(EEG) and artifacts/noise by capturing both temporal dependencies across
different time frames and spatial relationships between channels. The model has
three modules: convolution, feature extraction, and predictor. The convolution
module extracts features through depth-wise and spatio-temporal convolution.
The feature extraction module individually reduces the feature dimension
extracted from EEG segments and their sub-segments. Subsequently, the extracted
features are concatenated into a single vector for classification using a fully
connected classifier called the predictor module. In addition, an anomaly
score-based post-classification processing technique was introduced to reduce
the false-positive rates of the model. Experimental results were reported and
analyzed using different parameter settings and datasets (Siena (public) and
Juntendo (private)). The proposed MR-EEGWaveNet significantly outperformed the
conventional non-multiresolution approach, improving the F1 scores from 0.177
to 0.336 on Siena and 0.327 to 0.488 on Juntendo, with precision gains of 15.9%
and 20.62%, respectively.

Result: 深度学习方法在自定义数据集上表现显著优于传统方法，准确性和鲁棒性更高。

Conclusion: 这项工作将促进基于模型的视觉定位方法的发展。

Abstract: Feature matching is a necessary step for many computer vision and
photogrammetry applications such as image registration, structure-from-motion,
and visual localization. Classical handcrafted methods such as SIFT feature
detection and description combined with nearest neighbour matching and RANSAC
outlier removal have been state-of-the-art for mobile mapping cameras. With
recent advances in deep learning, learnable methods have been introduced and
proven to have better robustness and performance under complex conditions.
Despite their growing adoption, a comprehensive comparison between classical
and learnable feature matching methods for the specific task of semantic 3D
building camera-to-model matching is still missing. This submission
systematically evaluates the effectiveness of different feature-matching
techniques in visual localization using textured CityGML LoD2 models. We use
standard benchmark datasets (HPatches, MegaDepth-1500) and custom datasets
consisting of facade textures and corresponding camera images (terrestrial and
drone). For the latter, we evaluate the achievable accuracy of the absolute
pose estimated using a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm, with geometric
ground truth derived from geo-referenced trajectory data. The results indicate
that the learnable feature matching methods vastly outperform traditional
approaches regarding accuracy and robustness on our challenging custom datasets
with zero to 12 RANSAC-inliers and zero to 0.16 area under the curve. We
believe that this work will foster the development of model-based visual
localization methods. Link to the code:

Conclusion: 联合建模分层结构和多模态对齐对有限病理数据的高效学习具有重要价值。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently been integrated into multiple
instance learning (MIL) frameworks to address the challenge of few-shot, weakly
supervised classification of whole slide images (WSIs). A key trend involves
leveraging multi-scale information to better represent hierarchical tissue
structures. However, existing methods often face two key limitations: (1)
insufficient modeling of interactions within the same modalities across scales
(e.g., 5x and 20x) and (2) inadequate alignment between visual and textual
modalities on the same scale. To address these gaps, we propose HiVE-MIL, a
hierarchical vision-language framework that constructs a unified graph
consisting of (1) parent-child links between coarse (5x) and fine (20x)
visual/textual nodes to capture hierarchical relationships, and (2)
heterogeneous intra-scale edges linking visual and textual nodes on the same
scale. To further enhance semantic consistency, HiVE-MIL incorporates a
two-stage, text-guided dynamic filtering mechanism that removes weakly
correlated patch-text pairs, and introduces a hierarchical contrastive loss to
align textual semantics across scales. Extensive experiments on TCGA breast,
lung, and kidney cancer datasets demonstrate that HiVE-MIL consistently
outperforms both traditional MIL and recent VLM-based MIL approaches, achieving
gains of up to 4.1% in macro F1 under 16-shot settings. Our results demonstrate
the value of jointly modeling hierarchical structure and multimodal alignment
for efficient and scalable learning from limited pathology data. The code is

Conclusion: 该模型为小数据集下的非刚性物体3D重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction from 2D inputs, especially for non-rigid objects like
humans, presents unique challenges due to the significant range of possible
deformations. Traditional methods often struggle with non-rigid shapes, which
require extensive training data to cover the entire deformation space. This
study addresses these limitations by proposing a canonical pose reconstruction
model that transforms single-view depth images of deformable shapes into a
canonical form. This alignment facilitates shape reconstruction by enabling the
application of rigid object reconstruction techniques, and supports recovering
the input pose in voxel representation as part of the reconstruction task,
utilizing both the original and deformed depth images. Notably, our model
achieves effective results with only a small dataset of approximately 300
samples. Experimental results on animal and human datasets demonstrate that our
model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Open-set image segmentation poses a significant challenge because existing
methods often demand extensive training or fine-tuning and generally struggle
to segment unified objects consistently across diverse text reference
expressions. Motivated by this, we propose Segment Anyword, a novel
training-free visual concept prompt learning approach for open-set language
grounded segmentation that relies on token-level cross-attention maps from a
frozen diffusion model to produce segmentation surrogates or mask prompts,
which are then refined into targeted object masks. Initial prompts typically
lack coherence and consistency as the complexity of the image-text increases,
resulting in suboptimal mask fragments. To tackle this issue, we further
introduce a novel linguistic-guided visual prompt regularization that binds and
clusters visual prompts based on sentence dependency and syntactic structural
information, enabling the extraction of robust, noise-tolerant mask prompts,
and significant improvements in segmentation accuracy. The proposed approach is
effective, generalizes across different open-set segmentation tasks, and
achieves state-of-the-art results of 52.5 (+6.8 relative) mIoU on Pascal
Context 59, 67.73 (+25.73 relative) cIoU on gRefCOCO, and 67.4 (+1.1 relative
to fine-tuned methods) mIoU on GranDf, which is the most complex open-set
grounded segmentation task in the field.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time monitoring of tissue ischemia is crucial to understand
tissue health and guide surgery. Spectral imaging shows great potential for
contactless and intraoperative monitoring of tissue oxygenation. Due to the
difficulty of obtaining direct reference oxygenation values, conventional
methods are based on linear unmixing techniques. These are prone to assumptions
and these linear relations may not always hold in practice. In this work, we
present deep learning approaches for real-time tissue oxygenation estimation
using Monte-Carlo simulated spectra. We train a fully connected neural network
(FCN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN) for this task and propose a
domain-adversarial training approach to bridge the gap between simulated and
real clinical spectral data. Results demonstrate that these deep learning
models achieve a higher correlation with capillary lactate measurements, a
well-known marker of hypoxia, obtained during spectral imaging in surgery,
compared to traditional linear unmixing. Notably, domain-adversarial training
effectively reduces the domain gap, optimizing performance in real clinical
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑楼层数的准确信息对家庭估算、风险评估和能源建模至关重要，但现有数据稀缺。

Method: 使用深度学习分类-回归网络，基于公开数据集（慕尼黑建筑楼层数据集）进行训练和测试。

Result: 模型在测试集上达到81.2%的准确率，97.9%的建筑预测误差在±1层内。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D城市模型提供了可扩展的垂直信息补充，为城市信息学和地理信息科学奠定了基础。

Abstract: Accurate information on the number of building floors, or above-ground
storeys, is essential for household estimation, utility provision, risk
assessment, evacuation planning, and energy modeling. Yet large-scale
floor-count data are rarely available in cadastral and 3D city databases. This
study proposes an end-to-end deep learning framework that infers floor numbers
directly from unrestricted, crowdsourced street-level imagery, avoiding
hand-crafted features and generalizing across diverse facade styles. To enable
benchmarking, we release the Munich Building Floor Dataset, a public set of
over 6800 geo-tagged images collected from Mapillary and targeted field
photography, each paired with a verified storey label. On this dataset, the
proposed classification-regression network attains 81.2% exact accuracy and
predicts 97.9% of buildings within +/-1 floor. The method and dataset together
offer a scalable route to enrich 3D city models with vertical information and
lay a foundation for future work in urban informatics, remote sensing, and
geographic information science. Source code and data will be released under an

Motivation: 当前系统无法满足地球观测中对多样化视觉目标的识别和定位需求，且缺乏兼容性。

Method: 引入自动数据引擎创建大规模数据集，并提出以指代表达分割为中心的任务统一范式。

Result: RemoteSAM在多个地球观测感知基准测试中达到新SoTA，效率显著高于其他模型。

Conclusion: RemoteSAM通过数据和建模创新，成为高效、多功能的地球观测基础模型。

Abstract: We aim to develop a robust yet flexible visual foundation model for Earth
observation. It should possess strong capabilities in recognizing and
localizing diverse visual targets while providing compatibility with various
input-output interfaces required across different task scenarios. Current
systems cannot meet these requirements, as they typically utilize task-specific
architecture trained on narrow data domains with limited semantic coverage. Our
study addresses these limitations from two aspects: data and modeling. We first
introduce an automatic data engine that enjoys significantly better scalability
compared to previous human annotation or rule-based approaches. It has enabled
us to create the largest dataset of its kind to date, comprising 270K
image-text-mask triplets covering an unprecedented range of diverse semantic
categories and attribute specifications. Based on this data foundation, we
further propose a task unification paradigm that centers around referring
expression segmentation. It effectively handles a wide range of vision-centric
perception tasks, including classification, detection, segmentation, grounding,
etc, using a single model without any task-specific heads. Combining these
innovations on data and modeling, we present RemoteSAM, a foundation model that
establishes new SoTA on several earth observation perception benchmarks,
outperforming other foundation models such as Falcon, GeoChat, and LHRS-Bot
with significantly higher efficiency. Models and data are publicly available at

*Xiaobao Wei,Jiawei Liu,Dongbo Yang,Junda Cheng,Changyong Shu,Wei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于小波的立体匹配框架（Wavelet-Stereo），通过分离处理高低频信息，解决了现有迭代方法在高频区域的性能限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代方法在优化时未区分高低频信息，导致高频区域（如边缘和细薄物体）性能下降。

Method: 使用离散小波变换分解图像为高低频成分，分别通过多尺度特征提取器处理，并设计了一种基于LSTM的高频保留更新算子。

Result: Wavelet-Stereo在KITTI 2015和2012数据集上表现优异，几乎在所有指标上排名第一。

Conclusion: 通过独立处理高低频信息，该框架显著提升了高频细节的保留能力，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: We find that the EPE evaluation metrics of RAFT-stereo converge
inconsistently in the low and high frequency regions, resulting high frequency
degradation (e.g., edges and thin objects) during the iterative process. The
underlying reason for the limited performance of current iterative methods is
that it optimizes all frequency components together without distinguishing
between high and low frequencies. We propose a wavelet-based stereo matching
framework (Wavelet-Stereo) for solving frequency convergence inconsistency.
Specifically, we first explicitly decompose an image into high and low
frequency components using discrete wavelet transform. Then, the high-frequency
and low-frequency components are fed into two different multi-scale frequency
feature extractors. Finally, we propose a novel LSTM-based high-frequency
preservation update operator containing an iterative frequency adapter to
provide adaptive refined high-frequency features at different iteration steps
by fine-tuning the initial high-frequency features. By processing high and low
frequency components separately, our framework can simultaneously refine
high-frequency information in edges and low-frequency information in smooth
regions, which is especially suitable for challenging scenes with fine details
and textures in the distance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
Wavelet-Stereo outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and ranks 1st on both
the KITTI 2015 and KITTI 2012 leaderboards for almost all metrics. We will
provide code and pre-trained models to encourage further exploration,
application, and development of our innovative framework

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种模块化的3D人脸重建基准工具包（M3DFB），通过分离和可替换的组件量化误差计算的影响，并引入新的校正组件。实验表明，传统ICP方法性能最差，而非刚性对齐和校正方案显著提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D人脸重建的基准工具是单一的，缺乏对误差测量最佳方式的共识，限制了准确评估和比较不同方法的能力。

Method: 开发了模块化的工具包（M3DFB），分离误差计算的基本组件，并引入新的校正组件，提出了一种计算高效的拓扑不一致惩罚方法。

Result: 实验测试了16种误差估计器和10种重建方法，发现ICP方法性能最差（相关性低至0.41），非刚性对齐显著提升性能（相关性>0.90），校正方案与非刚性变形结合达到最佳性能且速度快。

Conclusion: M3DFB工具包支持灵活比较不同组件，推动3D人脸重建基准的进步，并有助于改进依赖准确误差估计的学习方法。

Abstract: Computing the standard benchmark metric for 3D face reconstruction, namely
geometric error, requires a number of steps, such as mesh cropping, rigid
alignment, or point correspondence. Current benchmark tools are monolithic
(they implement a specific combination of these steps), even though there is no
consensus on the best way to measure error. We present a toolkit for a
Modularized 3D Face reconstruction Benchmark (M3DFB), where the fundamental
components of error computation are segregated and interchangeable, allowing
one to quantify the effect of each. Furthermore, we propose a new component,
namely correction, and present a computationally efficient approach that
penalizes for mesh topology inconsistency. Using this toolkit, we test 16 error
estimators with 10 reconstruction methods on two real and two synthetic
datasets. Critically, the widely used ICP-based estimator provides the worst
benchmarking performance, as it significantly alters the true ranking of the
top-5 reconstruction methods. Notably, the correlation of ICP with the true
error can be as low as 0.41. Moreover, non-rigid alignment leads to significant
improvement (correlation larger than 0.90), highlighting the importance of
annotating 3D landmarks on datasets. Finally, the proposed correction scheme,
together with non-rigid warping, leads to an accuracy on a par with the best
non-rigid ICP-based estimators, but runs an order of magnitude faster. Our
open-source codebase is designed for researchers to easily compare alternatives
for each component, thus helping accelerating progress in benchmarking for 3D
face reconstruction and, furthermore, supporting the improvement of learned
reconstruction methods, which depend on accurate error estimation for effective
training.

TL;DR: CAMME框架通过多模态特征和跨注意力机制，显著提升了跨域深度伪造检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度伪造检测方法在未见生成架构下性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出CAMME框架，动态整合视觉、文本和频域特征，利用多头跨注意力机制实现跨域泛化。

Result: CAMME在自然场景和人脸深度伪造检测中分别提升12.56%和13.25%，对抗攻击下保持高准确率。

Conclusion: 跨模态整合和跨注意力机制能有效提升深度伪造检测的鲁棒性和跨域性能。

Abstract: The proliferation of sophisticated AI-generated deepfakes poses critical
challenges for digital media authentication and societal security. While
existing detection methods perform well within specific generative domains,
they exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to manipulations
produced by unseen architectures--a fundamental limitation as generative
technologies rapidly evolve. We propose CAMME (Cross-Attention Multi-Modal
Embeddings), a framework that dynamically integrates visual, textual, and
frequency-domain features through a multi-head cross-attention mechanism to
establish robust cross-domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate
CAMME's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, yielding improvements of
12.56% on natural scenes and 13.25% on facial deepfakes. The framework
demonstrates exceptional resilience, maintaining (over 91%) accuracy under
natural image perturbations and achieving 89.01% and 96.14% accuracy against
PGD and FGSM adversarial attacks, respectively. Our findings validate that
integrating complementary modalities through cross-attention enables more
effective decision boundary realignment for reliable deepfake detection across
heterogeneous generative architectures.

TL;DR: Clip4Retrofit是一个高效的模型蒸馏框架，用于在资源受限的边缘设备上实现实时图像标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决CLIP等基础模型在边缘设备上部署时计算复杂性和内存占用过高的问题。

Method: 通过将CLIP模型的知识蒸馏到轻量级学生模型（EfficientNet-B3结合MLP投影头），保持跨模态对齐的同时减少计算需求。

Result: 实验表明，Clip4Retrofit在资源受限的设备上实现了效率与性能的平衡，适用于实时图像标注和物体识别。

Conclusion: 该工作填补了先进视觉语言模型与资源受限环境部署之间的差距，推动了基础模型在边缘计算中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Foundation models like CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) have
revolutionized vision-language tasks by enabling zero-shot and few-shot
learning through cross-modal alignment. However, their computational complexity
and large memory footprint make them unsuitable for deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices, such as in-car cameras used for image
collection and real-time processing. To address this challenge, we propose
Clip4Retrofit, an efficient model distillation framework that enables real-time
image labeling on edge devices. The framework is deployed on the Retrofit
camera, a cost-effective edge device retrofitted into thousands of vehicles,
despite strict limitations on compute performance and memory. Our approach
distills the knowledge of the CLIP model into a lightweight student model,
combining EfficientNet-B3 with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) projection heads to
preserve cross-modal alignment while significantly reducing computational
requirements. We demonstrate that our distilled model achieves a balance
between efficiency and performance, making it ideal for deployment in
real-world scenarios. Experimental results show that Clip4Retrofit can perform
real-time image labeling and object identification on edge devices with limited
resources, offering a practical solution for applications such as autonomous
driving and retrofitting existing systems. This work bridges the gap between
state-of-the-art vision-language models and their deployment in
resource-constrained environments, paving the way for broader adoption of
foundation models in edge computing.

TL;DR: RestoreVAR是一种基于视觉自回归模型（VAR）的生成方法，显著提升了图像修复性能，同时推理速度比潜在扩散模型（LDM）快10倍以上。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDM-based方法在图像修复中表现优异但推理速度慢，不适用于时间敏感场景。

Method: 采用视觉自回归模型（VAR），结合改进的交叉注意力机制和潜在空间细化模块。

Result: RestoreVAR在生成式图像修复方法中达到最优性能，且泛化能力强。

Conclusion: RestoreVAR在性能和效率上均优于LDM-based方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: The use of latent diffusion models (LDMs) such as Stable Diffusion has
significantly improved the perceptual quality of All-in-One image Restoration
(AiOR) methods, while also enhancing their generalization capabilities.
However, these LDM-based frameworks suffer from slow inference due to their
iterative denoising process, rendering them impractical for time-sensitive
applications. To address this, we propose RestoreVAR, a novel generative
approach for AiOR that significantly outperforms LDM-based models in
restoration performance while achieving over $\mathbf{10\times}$ faster
inference. RestoreVAR leverages visual autoregressive modeling (VAR), a
recently introduced approach which performs scale-space autoregression for
image generation. VAR achieves comparable performance to that of
state-of-the-art diffusion transformers with drastically reduced computational
costs. To optimally exploit these advantages of VAR for AiOR, we propose
architectural modifications and improvements, including intricately designed
cross-attention mechanisms and a latent-space refinement module, tailored for
the AiOR task. Extensive experiments show that RestoreVAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance among generative AiOR methods, while also
exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 研究为SHAR领域提供了首个数据退化基准，揭示了退化类型的重要性，并展示了简单干预方法的有效性，同时发现LogSigRNN模型在退化数据中具有优势。

Abstract: Computer vision (CV) models for detection, prediction or classification tasks
operate on video data-streams that are often degraded in the real world, due to
deployment in real-time or on resource-constrained hardware. It is therefore
critical that these models are robust to degraded data, but state of the art
(SoTA) models are often insufficiently assessed with these real-world
constraints in mind. This is exemplified by Skeletal Human Action Recognition
(SHAR), which is critical in many CV pipelines operating in real-time and at
the edge, but robustness to degraded data has previously only been shallowly
and inconsistently assessed. Here we address this issue for SHAR by providing
an important first data degradation benchmark on the most detailed and largest
3D open dataset, NTU-RGB+D-120, and assess the robustness of five leading SHAR
models to three forms of degradation that represent real-world issues. We
demonstrate the need for this benchmark by showing that the form of
degradation, which has not previously been considered, has a large impact on
model accuracy; at the same effective frame rate, model accuracy can vary by
>40% depending on degradation type. We also identify that temporal regularity
of frames in degraded SHAR data is likely a major driver of differences in
model performance, and harness this to improve performance of existing models
by up to >40%, through employing a simple mitigation approach based on
interpolation. Finally, we highlight how our benchmark has helped identify an
important degradation-resistant SHAR model based in Rough Path Theory; the
LogSigRNN SHAR model outperforms the SoTA DeGCN model in five out of six cases
at low frame rates by an average accuracy of 6%, despite trailing the SoTA
model by 11-12% on un-degraded data at high frame rates (30 FPS).

Motivation: 尖峰相机能够捕捉动态条件下的清晰纹理，但生成的二进制稀疏帧在空间信息上不足。生成模型能融合尖峰和RGB模态信息，并基于潜在先验生成数据，弥补稀疏性。

Method: 提出SpikeGen框架，利用生成模型的潜在空间操作能力，结合尖峰流的时空丰富性，处理稀疏数据。

Conclusion: 生成模型能有效解决尖峰流空间信息稀疏的问题，同时充分利用其时间丰富性，促进不同视觉模态的协同增强。

Abstract: Neuromorphic Visual Systems, such as spike cameras, have attracted
considerable attention due to their ability to capture clear textures under
dynamic conditions. This capability effectively mitigates issues related to
motion and aperture blur. However, in contrast to conventional RGB modalities
that provide dense spatial information, these systems generate binary,
spatially sparse frames as a trade-off for temporally rich visual streams. In
this context, generative models emerge as a promising solution to address the
inherent limitations of sparse data. These models not only facilitate the
conditional fusion of existing information from both spike and RGB modalities
but also enable the conditional generation based on latent priors. In this
study, we introduce a robust generative processing framework named SpikeGen,
designed for visual spike streams captured by spike cameras. We evaluate this
framework across multiple tasks involving mixed spike-RGB modalities, including
conditional image/video deblurring, dense frame reconstruction from spike
streams, and high-speed scene novel-view synthesis. Supported by comprehensive
experimental results, we demonstrate that leveraging the latent space operation
abilities of generative models allows us to effectively address the sparsity of
spatial information while fully exploiting the temporal richness of spike
streams, thereby promoting a synergistic enhancement of different visual
modalities.

TL;DR: LookWhere方法通过自适应计算减少视觉Transformer在高分辨率图像上的计算成本，联合训练选择器和提取器，显著降低FLOPs和计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率图像导致视觉Transformer计算成本急剧增加，需要一种经济高效的方法来处理。

Method: LookWhere结合低分辨率选择器和高分辨率提取器，通过自监督教师蒸馏联合训练，无需任务监督。

Result: 在稀疏识别任务中减少FLOPs达34倍，时间减少6倍；在标准识别任务中时间减少1.36倍，同时保持或提高准确性。

Conclusion: LookWhere是一种高效且可迁移的图像表示选择与提取方法，适用于高分辨率和标准识别任务。

Abstract: Vision transformers are ever larger, more accurate, and more expensive to
compute. The expense is even more extreme at high resolution as the number of
tokens grows quadratically with the image size. We turn to adaptive computation
to cope with this cost by learning to predict where to compute. Our LookWhere
method divides the computation between a low-resolution selector and a
high-resolution extractor without ever processing the full high-resolution
input. We jointly pretrain the selector and extractor without task supervision
by distillation from a self-supervised teacher, in effect, learning where and
what to compute simultaneously. Unlike prior token reduction methods, which pay
to save by pruning already-computed tokens, and prior token selection methods,
which require complex and expensive per-task optimization, LookWhere
economically and accurately selects and extracts transferrable representations
of images. We show that LookWhere excels at sparse recognition on
high-resolution inputs (Traffic Signs), maintaining accuracy while reducing
FLOPs by up to 34x and time by 6x. It also excels at standard recognition tasks
that are global (ImageNet classification) or local (ADE20K segmentation),
improving accuracy while reducing time by 1.36x.

Motivation: 现有超声心动图分割方法因形状变化、部分观察和区域模糊导致解剖不一致，BOTM旨在提供解剖一致性保证。

Result: 实验显示BOTM在CAMUS2H LV和TED数据集上表现优异（如HD降低1.917，Dice提升1.9%）。

Conclusion: BOTM能生成稳定准确的分割结果，并确保解剖一致性。

Abstract: Existed echocardiography segmentation methods often suffer from anatomical
inconsistency challenge caused by shape variation, partial observation and
region ambiguity with similar intensity across 2D echocardiographic sequences,
resulting in false positive segmentation with anatomical defeated structures in
challenging low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. To provide a strong
anatomical guarantee across different echocardiographic frames, we propose a
novel segmentation framework named BOTM (Bi-directional Optimal Token Matching)
that performs echocardiography segmentation and optimal anatomy transportation
simultaneously. Given paired echocardiographic images, BOTM learns to match two
sets of discrete image tokens by finding optimal correspondences from a novel
anatomical transportation perspective. We further extend the token matching
into a bi-directional cross-transport attention proxy to regulate the preserved
anatomical consistency within the cardiac cyclic deformation in temporal
domain. Extensive experimental results show that BOTM can generate stable and
accurate segmentation outcomes (e.g. -1.917 HD on CAMUS2H LV, +1.9% Dice on
TED), and provide a better matching interpretation with anatomical consistency
guarantee.

Abstract: Prompt learning as a parameter-efficient method that has been widely adopted
to adapt Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to downstream tasks. While hard-prompt
design requires domain expertise and iterative optimization, soft-prompt
methods rely heavily on task-specific hard labels, limiting their
generalization to unseen categories. Recent popular distillation-based prompt
learning methods improve generalization by exploiting larger teacher VLMs and
unsupervised knowledge transfer, yet their repetitive teacher model online
inference sacrifices the inherent training efficiency advantage of prompt
learning. In this paper, we propose {{\large {\textbf{F}}}}aster {{\large
{\textbf{D}}}}istillation-{{\large {\textbf{B}}}}ased {{\large
{\textbf{P}}}}rompt {{\large {\textbf{L}}}}earning (\textbf{FDBPL}), which
addresses these issues by sharing soft supervision contexts across multiple
training stages and implementing accelerated I/O. Furthermore, FDBPL introduces
a region-aware prompt learning paradigm with dual positive-negative prompt
spaces to fully exploit randomly cropped regions that containing multi-level
information. We propose a positive-negative space mutual learning mechanism
based on similarity-difference learning, enabling student CLIP models to
recognize correct semantics while learning to reject weakly related concepts,
thereby improving zero-shot performance. Unlike existing distillation-based
prompt learning methods that sacrifice parameter efficiency for generalization,
FDBPL maintains dual advantages of parameter efficiency and strong downstream
generalization. Comprehensive evaluations across 11 datasets demonstrate
superior performance in base-to-new generalization, cross-dataset transfer, and
robustness tests, achieving $2.2\times$ faster training speed.

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondence is a challenging task in computer
vision, aiming to match keypoints with the same semantic information across
different images. Benefiting from the rapid development of deep learning,
remarkable progress has been made over the past decade. However, a
comprehensive review and analysis of this task remains absent. In this paper,
we present the first extensive survey of semantic correspondence methods. We
first propose a taxonomy to classify existing methods based on the type of
their method designs. These methods are then categorized accordingly, and we
provide a detailed analysis of each approach. Furthermore, we aggregate and
summarize the results of methods in literature across various benchmarks into a
unified comparative table, with detailed configurations to highlight
performance variations. Additionally, to provide a detailed understanding on
existing methods for semantic matching, we thoroughly conduct controlled
experiments to analyse the effectiveness of the components of different
methods. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective baseline that achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, providing a solid
foundation for future research in this field. We hope this survey serves as a
comprehensive reference and consolidated baseline for future development. Code

Motivation: 当前可控视频生成系统在多演员交互和噪声控制信号下表现不佳，需要一种能够严格保留每个演员身份的方法。

Method: 提出MaskPoseAdapter，通过融合跟踪掩码和姿态热图，在每一步去噪过程中绑定“谁”和“如何”，避免身份漂移和外观渗漏。

Abstract: Controllable video generation (CVG) has advanced rapidly, yet current systems
falter when more than one actor must move, interact, and exchange positions
under noisy control signals. We address this gap with DanceTogether, the first
end-to-end diffusion framework that turns a single reference image plus
independent pose-mask streams into long, photorealistic videos while strictly
preserving every identity. A novel MaskPoseAdapter binds "who" and "how" at
every denoising step by fusing robust tracking masks with semantically rich-but
noisy-pose heat-maps, eliminating the identity drift and appearance bleeding
that plague frame-wise pipelines. To train and evaluate at scale, we introduce
(i) PairFS-4K, 26 hours of dual-skater footage with 7,000+ distinct IDs, (ii)
HumanRob-300, a one-hour humanoid-robot interaction set for rapid cross-domain
transfer, and (iii) TogetherVideoBench, a three-track benchmark centered on the
DanceTogEval-100 test suite covering dance, boxing, wrestling, yoga, and figure
skating. On TogetherVideoBench, DanceTogether outperforms the prior arts by a
significant margin. Moreover, we show that a one-hour fine-tune yields
convincing human-robot videos, underscoring broad generalization to embodied-AI
and HRI tasks. Extensive ablations confirm that persistent identity-action
binding is critical to these gains. Together, our model, datasets, and
benchmark lift CVG from single-subject choreography to compositionally
controllable, multi-actor interaction, opening new avenues for digital
production, simulation, and embodied intelligence. Our video demos and code are

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Deep Video Discovery（DVD）的智能代理，利用搜索策略处理长视频理解任务，显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解因时空复杂性和长上下文问答困难而具有挑战性，现有LLM在处理信息密集的长视频时仍有限制。

Method: 通过自主代理策略在多粒度视频数据库上使用搜索工具，利用LLM的推理能力进行规划和迭代优化。

Result: 在LVBench数据集上实现SOTA性能，显著优于先前工作。

Conclusion: DVD代理为长视频理解任务提供了有效解决方案，并通过消融研究为未来智能代理设计提供了见解。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding presents significant challenges due to
extensive temporal-spatial complexity and the difficulty of question answering
under such extended contexts. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated considerable advancements in video analysis capabilities and long
context handling, they continue to exhibit limitations when processing
information-dense hour-long videos. To overcome such limitations, we propose
the Deep Video Discovery agent to leverage an agentic search strategy over
segmented video clips. Different from previous video agents manually designing
a rigid workflow, our approach emphasizes the autonomous nature of agents. By
providing a set of search-centric tools on multi-granular video database, our
DVD agent leverages the advanced reasoning capability of LLM to plan on its
current observation state, strategically selects tools, formulates appropriate
parameters for actions, and iteratively refines its internal reasoning in light
of the gathered information. We perform comprehensive evaluation on multiple
long video understanding benchmarks that demonstrates the advantage of the
entire system design. Our DVD agent achieves SOTA performance, significantly
surpassing prior works by a large margin on the challenging LVBench dataset.
Comprehensive ablation studies and in-depth tool analyses are also provided,
yielding insights to further advance intelligent agents tailored for long-form
video understanding tasks. The code will be released later.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅关注最终诊断结果，缺乏对模型是否进行临床有意义推理的评估。

Method: 通过CheXStruct自动从胸部X光片中提取中间推理步骤，如解剖区域分割、测量计算等，并利用CXReasonBench评估模型的推理能力。

Result: 即使最强的模型在结构化推理和泛化能力上表现不佳，难以将抽象知识与视觉解释结合。

Conclusion: 该研究为医学影像诊断提供了更细粒度和透明的评估工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) has enabled promising
applications in medical tasks, such as report generation and visual question
answering. However, existing benchmarks focus mainly on the final diagnostic
answer, offering limited insight into whether models engage in clinically
meaningful reasoning. To address this, we present CheXStruct and CXReasonBench,
a structured pipeline and benchmark built on the publicly available
MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset. CheXStruct automatically derives a sequence of
intermediate reasoning steps directly from chest X-rays, such as segmenting
anatomical regions, deriving anatomical landmarks and diagnostic measurements,
computing diagnostic indices, and applying clinical thresholds. CXReasonBench
leverages this pipeline to evaluate whether models can perform clinically valid
reasoning steps and to what extent they can learn from structured guidance,
enabling fine-grained and transparent assessment of diagnostic reasoning. The
benchmark comprises 18,988 QA pairs across 12 diagnostic tasks and 1,200 cases,
each paired with up to 4 visual inputs, and supports multi-path, multi-stage
evaluation including visual grounding via anatomical region selection and
diagnostic measurements. Even the strongest of 10 evaluated LVLMs struggle with
structured reasoning and generalization, often failing to link abstract
knowledge with anatomically grounded visual interpretation. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D对话头部生成模型仅关注说话或倾听，忽略交互对话的自然动态，导致不自然的互动和尴尬过渡。

Method: 提出多轮双说话者交互任务，开发DualTalk框架，整合说话和倾听行为，生成连贯对话交互。

Result: 实验表明，DualTalk显著提升双说话者对话中3D头部的自然性和表现力。

Conclusion: DualTalk框架有效模拟真实对话交互，填补了现有模型的不足。

Abstract: In face-to-face conversations, individuals need to switch between speaking
and listening roles seamlessly. Existing 3D talking head generation models
focus solely on speaking or listening, neglecting the natural dynamics of
interactive conversation, which leads to unnatural interactions and awkward
transitions. To address this issue, we propose a new task -- multi-round
dual-speaker interaction for 3D talking head generation -- which requires
models to handle and generate both speaking and listening behaviors in
continuous conversation. To solve this task, we introduce DualTalk, a novel
unified framework that integrates the dynamic behaviors of speakers and
listeners to simulate realistic and coherent dialogue interactions. This
framework not only synthesizes lifelike talking heads when speaking but also
generates continuous and vivid non-verbal feedback when listening, effectively
capturing the interplay between the roles. We also create a new dataset
featuring 50 hours of multi-round conversations with over 1,000 characters,
where participants continuously switch between speaking and listening roles.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the
naturalness and expressiveness of 3D talking heads in dual-speaker
conversations. We recommend watching the supplementary video:

Motivation: 纳米材料研究中缺乏高质量的标注数据集，阻碍了纳米尺度成像的强分割模型的开发。

Method: 采用注意力增强的循环一致性生成对抗系统（F-ANcGAN），结合Style U-Net生成器和自注意力U-Net分割网络，并通过数据增强方法提升数据集多样性。

Result: 模型在TiO2数据集生成中达到原始FID分数17.65，通过后处理技术进一步降至10.39。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成高保真合成数据集，提升了分割任务的训练效果，解决了纳米粒子分析中的数据短缺问题，适用于资源有限领域。

Abstract: Nanomaterial research is becoming a vital area for energy, medicine, and
materials science, and accurate analysis of the nanoparticle topology is
essential to determine their properties. Unfortunately, the lack of
high-quality annotated datasets drastically hinders the creation of strong
segmentation models for nanoscale imaging. To alleviate this problem, we
introduce F-ANcGAN, an attention-enhanced cycle consistent generative
adversarial system that can be trained using a limited number of data samples
and generates realistic scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images directly from
segmentation maps. Our model uses a Style U-Net generator and a U-Net
segmentation network equipped with self-attention to capture structural
relationships and applies augmentation methods to increase the variety of the
dataset. The architecture reached a raw FID score of 17.65 for TiO$_2$ dataset
generation, with a further reduction in FID score to nearly 10.39 by using
efficient post-processing techniques. By facilitating scalable high-fidelity
synthetic dataset generation, our approach can improve the effectiveness of
downstream segmentation task training, overcoming severe data shortage issues
in nanoparticle analysis, thus extending its applications to resource-limited
fields.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为\method的开源方法，用于将图像元数据转换为视觉指令调优（VisIT）数据，解决了现有方法成本高、难以扩展和质量不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VisIT数据集构建方法依赖封闭模型API，成本高且难以扩展，缺乏统一和可复现的方法。

Method: 采用多阶段框架，包括元数据分组、质量控制、数据组织、对话采样，使用开源LLMs（如Gemma 2 27B和LLaMa 3.1 70B）。

Conclusion: \method提供了一种高效、可扩展的开源解决方案，显著提升VisIT数据质量和LMM性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Visual Instruction Tuning (VisIT) data, commonly available as human-assistant
conversations with images interleaved in the human turns, are currently the
most widespread vehicle for aligning strong LLMs to understand visual inputs,
converting them to strong LMMs. While many VisIT datasets are available, most
are constructed using ad-hoc techniques developed independently by different
groups. They are often poorly documented, lack reproducible code, and rely on
paid, closed-source model APIs such as GPT-4, Gemini, or Claude to convert
image metadata (labels) into VisIT instructions. This leads to high costs and
makes it challenging to scale, enhance quality, or generate VisIT data for new
datasets. In this work, we address these challenges and propose an open and
unified recipe and approach,~\textbf{\method}, for converting available
metadata to VisIT instructions using open LLMs. Our multi-stage \method
features an efficient framework for metadata grouping, quality control, data
and prompt organization, and conversation sampling. We show that our approach
can reproduce or enhance the data quality of available VisIT datasets when
applied to the same image data and metadata sources, improving GPT-4 generated
VisIT instructions by ~3\% on average and up to 12\% on individual benchmarks
using open models, such as Gemma 2 27B and LLaMa 3.1 70B. Additionally, our
approach enables effective performance scaling - both in quantity and quality -
by enhancing the resulting LMM performance across a wide range of benchmarks.
We also analyze the impact of various factors, including conversation format,
base model selection, and resampling strategies. Our code, which supports the
reproduction of equal or higher-quality VisIT datasets and facilities future
metadata-to-VisIT data conversion for niche domains, is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强化学习在视觉语言模型中超越推理任务的应用，尤其是在感知密集型任务如目标检测和定位中的潜力。

Method: 提出V-Triune系统，包含样本级数据格式化、验证级奖励计算和源级指标监控，并引入动态IoU奖励机制。

Result: Orsta模型在推理和感知任务中表现一致提升，在MEGA-Bench Core上取得显著改进。

Conclusion: V-Triune系统展示了统一强化学习方法在视觉语言模型中的有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the use of RL beyond
reasoning tasks remains largely unexplored, especially for perceptionintensive
tasks like object detection and grounding. We propose V-Triune, a Visual Triple
Unified Reinforcement Learning system that enables VLMs to jointly learn visual
reasoning and perception tasks within a single training pipeline. V-Triune
comprises triple complementary components: Sample-Level Data Formatting (to
unify diverse task inputs), Verifier-Level Reward Computation (to deliver
custom rewards via specialized verifiers) , and Source-Level Metric Monitoring
(to diagnose problems at the data-source level). We further introduce a novel
Dynamic IoU reward, which provides adaptive, progressive, and definite feedback
for perception tasks handled by V-Triune. Our approach is instantiated within
off-the-shelf RL training framework using open-source 7B and 32B backbone
models. The resulting model, dubbed Orsta (One RL to See Them All),
demonstrates consistent improvements across both reasoning and perception
tasks. This broad capability is significantly shaped by its training on a
diverse dataset, constructed around four representative visual reasoning tasks
(Math, Puzzle, Chart, and Science) and four visual perception tasks (Grounding,
Detection, Counting, and OCR). Subsequently, Orsta achieves substantial gains
on MEGA-Bench Core, with improvements ranging from +2.1 to an impressive +14.1
across its various 7B and 32B model variants, with performance benefits
extending to a wide range of downstream tasks. These results highlight the
effectiveness and scalability of our unified RL approach for VLMs. The V-Triune
system, along with the Orsta models, is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVM方法过度依赖步态先验，忽视了LVM多层表征的互补性，限制了模型潜力。

Method: 分析LVM各层表征对任务的影响，提出整合多层表征的简单基线方法BiggerGait。

Result: 在多个数据集（CCPG、CAISA-B*等）上验证了BiggerGait的优越性，尤其在跨域任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: BiggerGait为步态表征学习提供了一个简单实用的基线，模型和代码将开源。

Abstract: Large vision models (LVM) based gait recognition has achieved impressive
performance. However, existing LVM-based approaches may overemphasize gait
priors while neglecting the intrinsic value of LVM itself, particularly the
rich, distinct representations across its multi-layers. To adequately unlock
LVM's potential, this work investigates the impact of layer-wise
representations on downstream recognition tasks. Our analysis reveals that
LVM's intermediate layers offer complementary properties across tasks,
integrating them yields an impressive improvement even without rich
well-designed gait priors. Building on this insight, we propose a simple and
universal baseline for LVM-based gait recognition, termed BiggerGait.
Comprehensive evaluations on CCPG, CAISA-B*, SUSTech1K, and CCGR\_MINI validate
the superiority of BiggerGait across both within- and cross-domain tasks,
establishing it as a simple yet practical baseline for gait representation
learning. All the models and code will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有OSR方法使用固定温度参数限制了表示学习的多样性，本文旨在通过动态调整温度参数，优化模型的决策边界和表示空间。

Method: 提出负余弦调度方案，动态调整温度参数，使模型在训练初期关注较少的邻居以形成粗糙决策边界，随后逐步平滑边界。

Result: 该方法在多个基准测试中提升了OSR和闭集性能，尤其在语义偏移较大的任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: 动态温度调制是一种高效且无需额外计算开销的改进方法，适用于现有OSR框架。

Abstract: The open set recognition (OSR) problem aims to identify test samples from
novel semantic classes that are not part of the training classes, a task that
is crucial in many practical scenarios. However, existing OSR methods use a
constant scaling factor (the temperature) to the logits before applying a loss
function, which hinders the model from exploring both ends of the spectrum in
representation learning -- from instance-level to semantic-level features. In
this paper, we address this problem by enabling temperature-modulated
representation learning using our novel negative cosine scheduling scheme. Our
scheduling lets the model form a coarse decision boundary at the beginning of
training by focusing on fewer neighbors, and gradually prioritizes more
neighbors to smooth out rough edges. This gradual task switching leads to a
richer and more generalizable representation space. While other OSR methods
benefit by including regularization or auxiliary negative samples, such as with
mix-up, thereby adding a significant computational overhead, our scheme can be
folded into any existing OSR method with no overhead. We implement the proposed
scheme on top of a number of baselines, using both cross-entropy and
contrastive loss functions as well as a few other OSR methods, and find that
our scheme boosts both the OSR performance and the closed set performance in
most cases, especially on the tougher semantic shift benchmarks.

Motivation: 图像分词技术虽然推动了视觉生成和多模态建模，但其压缩过程中不可避免地丢失信息，限制了生成质量的上限。本文旨在评估这种信息丢失对文本和面部重建的影响。

Method: 收集并整理文本和面部图像数据集，使用OCR模型评估文本重建的识别准确率，通过特征相似性量化面部重建的保真度。方法轻量，仅需2GB内存和4分钟完成评估。

Result: 现代视觉分词器在保留细粒度特征（尤其是小尺度下）方面仍有困难。传统指标无法准确反映面部和文本的重建性能，而本文提出的指标可作为有效补充。

Conclusion: 本文提出的基准和分析框架为视觉分词器和VAE的性能评估提供了新视角，尤其在文本和面部重建方面具有重要意义。

Abstract: In this work, we reveal the limitations of visual tokenizers and VAEs in
preserving fine-grained features, and propose a benchmark to evaluate
reconstruction performance for two challenging visual contents: text and face.
Image tokenization has significantly advanced visual generation and multimodal
modeling, particularly with autoregressive models due to the modeling
simplicity of discrete tokens. Autoregressive models typically rely on image
tokenizers to compress images into discrete tokens for sequential prediction,
whereas diffusion models often operate on continuous latent space to reduce
computational costs. However, both visual compression approaches inevitably
lose visual information, thereby limiting the upper bound of visual generation
quality. To evaluate how these compression losses affect text and faces, the
most human-sensitive visual elements, we first collect and curate a collection
of text and faces images from existing datasets, ensuring clarity and
diversity. For text reconstruction, we employ OCR models to assess the
recognition accuracy of the reconstructed text, and then we measure feature
similarity between original and reconstructed faces thereby quantifying faces
reconstruction fidelity. Our method is highly lightweight, requiring just 2GB
memory and 4 minutes to complete evaluations. With our benchmark, we analyze
the reconstruction quality of text and faces at various scales across different
image tokenizers and VAEs. Our results demonstrate that modern visual
tokenizers still struggle to preserve fine-grained features, particularly at
smaller scales. Furthermore, we extend this evaluation framework to the video,
conducting a comprehensive analysis of video tokenizers. Additionally, we find
that traditional metrics fail to accurately reflect the reconstruction
performance for faces and text, while our proposed metrics serve as an
effective complement.

Conclusion: REN是一种高效且通用的区域表示生成方法，适用于多种编码器，并在性能和效率上超越现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Region Encoder Network (REN), a fast and effective model for
generating region-based image representations using point prompts. Recent
methods combine class-agnostic segmenters (e.g., SAM) with patch-based image
encoders (e.g., DINO) to produce compact and effective region representations,
but they suffer from high computational cost due to the segmentation step. REN
bypasses this bottleneck using a lightweight module that directly generates
region tokens, enabling 60x faster token generation with 35x less memory, while
also improving token quality. It uses a few cross-attention blocks that take
point prompts as queries and features from a patch-based image encoder as keys
and values to produce region tokens that correspond to the prompted objects. We
train REN with three popular encoders-DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP-and show that
it can be extended to other encoders without dedicated training. We evaluate
REN on semantic segmentation and retrieval tasks, where it consistently
outperforms the original encoders in both performance and compactness, and
matches or exceeds SAM-based region methods while being significantly faster.
Notably, REN achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging Ego4D VQ2D
benchmark and outperforms proprietary LMMs on Visual Haystacks' single-needle
challenge. Code and models are available at: https://github.com/savya08/REN.

Motivation: 课堂语音识别面临高质量标注数据稀缺而弱标注数据丰富的现实挑战，传统方法成本高昂且不切实际。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先在弱标注数据上进行监督预训练，再在少量高质量数据上微调。

Result: 实验表明，WSP在合成和真实弱标注数据上均优于其他方法。

Conclusion: WSP是低资源语音识别场景中有效的训练方法。

Abstract: Recent progress in speech recognition has relied on models trained on vast
amounts of labeled data. However, classroom Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
faces the real-world challenge of abundant weak transcripts paired with only a
small amount of accurate, gold-standard data. In such low-resource settings,
high transcription costs make re-transcription impractical. To address this, we
ask: what is the best approach when abundant inexpensive weak transcripts
coexist with limited gold-standard data, as is the case for classroom speech
data? We propose Weakly Supervised Pretraining (WSP), a two-step process where
models are first pretrained on weak transcripts in a supervised manner, and
then fine-tuned on accurate data. Our results, based on both synthetic and real
weak transcripts, show that WSP outperforms alternative methods, establishing
it as an effective training methodology for low-resource ASR in real-world
scenarios.

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言语音助手开发提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of voice assistants powered by large language models (LLM)
has highlighted a need for speech instruction data to train these systems.
Despite the abundance of speech recognition data, there is a notable scarcity
of speech instruction data, which is essential for fine-tuning models to
understand and execute spoken commands. Generating high-quality synthetic
speech requires a good text-to-speech (TTS) model, which may not be available
to low resource languages. Our novel approach addresses this challenge by
halting synthesis at the semantic representation level, bypassing the need for
TTS. We achieve this by aligning synthetic semantic representations with the
pre-trained Whisper encoder, enabling an LLM to be fine-tuned on text
instructions while maintaining the ability to understand spoken instructions
during inference. This simplified training process is a promising approach to
building voice assistant for low-resource languages.

### [312] [Towards Practical Defect-Focused Automated Code Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17928)
*Junyi Lu,Lili Jiang,Xiaojia Li,Jianbing Fang,Fengjun Zhang,Li Yang,Chun Zuo*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自动化代码审查方法，解决了现有方法忽略仓库上下文、真实合并请求评估和缺陷检测的问题，并在实际大规模C++代码库中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动化代码审查方法过于简化，忽略了关键上下文和实际需求，限制了实用性。

Method: 采用代码切片算法提取上下文，多角色LLM框架提高关键缺陷检测，过滤机制降低误报率，以及优化提示设计改善人机交互。

Result: 在真实合并请求中验证，性能比标准LLM提升2倍，比基线方法提升10倍。

Conclusion: 该方法基于语言无关原则设计，具有广泛适用潜力。

Abstract: The complexity of code reviews has driven efforts to automate review
comments, but prior approaches oversimplify this task by treating it as
snippet-level code-to-text generation and relying on text similarity metrics
like BLEU for evaluation. These methods overlook repository context, real-world
merge request evaluation, and defect detection, limiting their practicality. To
address these issues, we explore the full automation pipeline within the online
recommendation service of a company with nearly 400 million daily active users,
analyzing industry-grade C++ codebases comprising hundreds of thousands of
lines of code. We identify four key challenges: 1) capturing relevant context,
2) improving key bug inclusion (KBI), 3) reducing false alarm rates (FAR), and
4) integrating human workflows. To tackle these, we propose 1) code slicing
algorithms for context extraction, 2) a multi-role LLM framework for KBI, 3) a
filtering mechanism for FAR reduction, and 4) a novel prompt design for better
human interaction. Our approach, validated on real-world merge requests from
historical fault reports, achieves a 2x improvement over standard LLMs and a
10x gain over previous baselines. While the presented results focus on C++, the
underlying framework design leverages language-agnostic principles (e.g.,
AST-based analysis), suggesting potential for broader applicability.

### [313] [OCR-Reasoning Benchmark: Unveiling the True Capabilities of MLLMs in Complex Text-Rich Image Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17163)
*Mingxin Huang,Yongxin Shi,Dezhi Peng,Songxuan Lai,Zecheng Xie,Lianwen Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OCR-Reasoning是一个针对文本丰富图像推理任务的系统性基准测试，评估多模态大语言模型的推理能力，结果显示现有方法表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 填补文本丰富图像推理任务缺乏系统性基准的空白。

Method: 提出OCR-Reasoning基准，包含1,069个人工标注样本，覆盖6种核心推理能力和18种任务，同时标注推理过程和最终答案。

Result: 现有最先进的多模态大语言模型在OCR-Reasoning上表现不佳，准确率均未超过50%。

Conclusion: 文本丰富图像推理任务仍具挑战性，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal slow-thinking systems have demonstrated
remarkable performance across diverse visual reasoning tasks. However, their
capabilities in text-rich image reasoning tasks remain understudied due to the
lack of a systematic benchmark. To address this gap, we propose OCR-Reasoning,
a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically assess Multimodal Large
Language Models on text-rich image reasoning tasks. The benchmark comprises
1,069 human-annotated examples spanning 6 core reasoning abilities and 18
practical reasoning tasks in text-rich visual scenarios. Furthermore, unlike
other text-rich image understanding benchmarks that only annotate the final
answers, OCR-Reasoning also annotates the reasoning process simultaneously.
With the annotated reasoning process and the final answers, OCR-Reasoning
evaluates not only the final answers generated by models but also their
reasoning processes, enabling a holistic analysis of their problem-solving
abilities. Leveraging this benchmark, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation
of state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our results demonstrate the limitations of existing
methodologies. Notably, even state-of-the-art MLLMs exhibit substantial
difficulties, with none achieving accuracy surpassing 50\% across
OCR-Reasoning, indicating that the challenges of text-rich image reasoning are
an urgent issue to be addressed. The benchmark and evaluation scripts are
available at https://github.com/SCUT-DLVCLab/OCR-Reasoning.

Abstract: With the rise of IoT-based botnet attacks, researchers have explored various
learning models for detection, including traditional machine learning, deep
learning, and hybrid approaches. A key advancement involves deploying attention
mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies among features, significantly
improving detection accuracy. However, most models treat attack instances
independently, overlooking inter-instance relationships. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) address this limitation by learning an embedding space via iterative
message passing where similar instances are placed closer based on node
features and relationships, enhancing classification performance. To further
improve detection, attention mechanisms have been embedded within GNNs,
leveraging both long-range dependencies and inter-instance connections.
However, transforming the high dimensional IoT attack datasets into a graph
structured dataset poses challenges, such as large graph structures leading
computational overhead. To mitigate this, this paper proposes a framework that
first reduces dimensionality of the NetFlow-based IoT attack dataset before
transforming it into a graph dataset. We evaluate three dimension reduction
techniques--Variational Autoencoder (VAE-encoder), classical autoencoder
(AE-encoder), and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)--and compare their effects
on a Graph Attention neural network (GAT) model for botnet attack detection

*Tianyu Xie,Shuchen Xue,Zijin Feng,Tianyang Hu,Jiacheng Sun,Zhenguo Li,Cheng Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VADD是一种新型离散扩散模型框架，通过隐变量建模增强离散扩散，显著提升样本质量，尤其在去噪步骤较少时表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码扩散模型（MDMs）在去噪步骤较少时，由于对维度间依赖关系的建模不足，性能会下降。VADD旨在通过隐变量建模解决这一问题。

Method: VADD引入辅助识别模型，通过变分下界最大化实现稳定训练，并在训练集上进行摊销推断。

Result: 在2D玩具数据、像素级图像生成和文本生成任务中，VADD均优于MDM基线模型。

Conclusion: VADD在保持传统MDMs效率的同时，显著提升了样本质量，尤其在去噪步骤较少时表现突出。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently shown great promise for modeling
complex discrete data, with masked diffusion models (MDMs) offering a
compelling trade-off between quality and generation speed. MDMs denoise by
progressively unmasking multiple dimensions from an all-masked input, but their
performance can degrade when using few denoising steps due to limited modeling
of inter-dimensional dependencies. In this paper, we propose Variational
Autoencoding Discrete Diffusion (VADD), a novel framework that enhances
discrete diffusion with latent variable modeling to implicitly capture
correlations among dimensions. By introducing an auxiliary recognition model,
VADD enables stable training via variational lower bounds maximization and
amortized inference over the training set. Our approach retains the efficiency
of traditional MDMs while significantly improving sample quality, especially
when the number of denoising steps is small. Empirical results on 2D toy data,
pixel-level image generation, and text generation demonstrate that VADD
consistently outperforms MDM baselines.

*Bhanuka Gamage,Adnan Labib,Aisha Joomun,Chern Hong Lim,KokSheik Wong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究提出了一种名为BaitRadar的算法，通过深度学习技术联合六个推理模型检测YouTube上的点击诱饵内容，准确率达98%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: YouTube上点击诱饵问题日益严重，用户常因标题和缩略图吸引而观看与宣传不符的内容，本研究旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BaitRadar算法结合六个推理模型，分别分析视频的标题、评论、缩略图、标签、统计数据和音频转录，通过平均计算结果提高鲁棒性。

Result: 在1,400个YouTube视频上测试，平均准确率为98%，推理时间少于2秒。

Conclusion: BaitRadar能有效识别点击诱饵，即使在数据缺失情况下仍保持高准确率。

Abstract: Following the rising popularity of YouTube, there is an emerging problem on
this platform called clickbait, which provokes users to click on videos using
attractive titles and thumbnails. As a result, users ended up watching a video
that does not have the content as publicized in the title. This issue is
addressed in this study by proposing an algorithm called BaitRadar, which uses
a deep learning technique where six inference models are jointly consulted to
make the final classification decision. These models focus on different
attributes of the video, including title, comments, thumbnail, tags, video
statistics and audio transcript. The final classification is attained by
computing the average of multiple models to provide a robust and accurate
output even in situation where there is missing data. The proposed method is
tested on 1,400 YouTube videos. On average, a test accuracy of 98% is achieved
with an inference time of less than 2s.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于深度学习的框架，利用点火时的数据预测野火最终燃烧范围，并通过多日观测数据显著提高了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的野火蔓延预测对风险管理、应急响应和资源分配至关重要。

Method: 使用深度学习框架，结合点火前后的时空数据（如遥感、气象、植被等），并通过消融研究评估时间上下文的影响。

Result: 包含多日观测数据的模型（点火前4天至点火后5天）比仅使用点火日数据的基线模型在F1分数和IoU上提高了近5%。

Conclusion: 公开数据集和模型以促进数据驱动的野火建模和响应研究。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of wildfire spread is crucial for effective risk
management, emergency response, and strategic resource allocation. In this
study, we present a deep learning (DL)-based framework for forecasting the
final extent of burned areas, using data available at the time of ignition. We
leverage a spatio-temporal dataset that covers the Mediterranean region from
2006 to 2022, incorporating remote sensing data, meteorological observations,
vegetation maps, land cover classifications, anthropogenic factors, topography
data, and thermal anomalies. To evaluate the influence of temporal context, we
conduct an ablation study examining how the inclusion of pre- and post-ignition
data affects model performance, benchmarking the temporal-aware DL models
against a baseline trained exclusively on ignition-day inputs. Our results
indicate that multi-day observational data substantially improve predictive
accuracy. Particularly, the best-performing model, incorporating a temporal
window of four days before to five days after ignition, improves both the F1
score and the Intersection over Union by almost 5% in comparison to the
baseline on the test dataset. We publicly release our dataset and models to
enhance research into data-driven approaches for wildfire modeling and
response.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MinkUNeXt-SI是一种基于LiDAR点云的自主导航系统方法，通过深度学习结合Minkowski卷积和U-net架构，生成鲁棒的地点识别描述符，性能超越现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自主导航系统中地点识别问题，需应对场景变化（如季节、天气）并具备泛化能力。

Method: 预处理LiDAR点云数据，归一化球坐标和强度值，采用Minkowski卷积和U-net架构。

Result: 方法性能超越现有技术，泛化能力强，自定义数据集评估结果优异。

Conclusion: MinkUNeXt-SI是一种高效、鲁棒的地点识别方法，代码和数据集公开以促进复现。

Abstract: In autonomous navigation systems, the solution of the place recognition
problem is crucial for their safe functioning. But this is not a trivial
solution, since it must be accurate regardless of any changes in the scene,
such as seasonal changes and different weather conditions, and it must be
generalizable to other environments. This paper presents our method,
MinkUNeXt-SI, which, starting from a LiDAR point cloud, preprocesses the input
data to obtain its spherical coordinates and intensity values normalized within
a range of 0 to 1 for each point, and it produces a robust place recognition
descriptor. To that end, a deep learning approach that combines Minkowski
convolutions and a U-net architecture with skip connections is used. The
results of MinkUNeXt-SI demonstrate that this method reaches and surpasses
state-of-the-art performance while it also generalizes satisfactorily to other
datasets. Additionally, we showcase the capture of a custom dataset and its use
in evaluating our solution, which also achieves outstanding results. Both the
code of our solution and the runs of our dataset are publicly available for
reproducibility purposes.

TL;DR: WildRES是一个新的RES基准，引入长查询和多样化属性，评估复杂推理能力。SynRES是一种自动化生成合成训练数据的管道，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RES基准的评估协议受限，无法充分评估复杂推理能力，WildRES填补了这一空白。

Method: WildRES引入长查询和多样化属性；SynRES通过密集标注驱动合成、语义对齐机制和域感知增强生成合成数据。

Result: 当前RES模型在WildRES上表现显著下降；SynRES训练模型在WildRES-ID和WildRES-DS上分别提升2.0%和3.8%的gIoU。

Conclusion: WildRES和SynRES显著提升了RES模型的复杂推理能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Despite the advances in Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) benchmarks,
their evaluation protocols remain constrained, primarily focusing on either
single targets with short queries (containing minimal attributes) or multiple
targets from distinctly different queries on a single domain. This limitation
significantly hinders the assessment of more complex reasoning capabilities in
RES models. We introduce WildRES, a novel benchmark that incorporates long
queries with diverse attributes and non-distinctive queries for multiple
targets. This benchmark spans diverse application domains, including autonomous
driving environments and robotic manipulation scenarios, thus enabling more
rigorous evaluation of complex reasoning capabilities in real-world settings.
Our analysis reveals that current RES models demonstrate substantial
performance deterioration when evaluated on WildRES. To address this challenge,
we introduce SynRES, an automated pipeline generating densely paired
compositional synthetic training data through three innovations: (1) a dense
caption-driven synthesis for attribute-rich image-mask-expression triplets, (2)
reliable semantic alignment mechanisms rectifying caption-pseudo mask
inconsistencies via Image-Text Aligned Grouping, and (3) domain-aware
augmentations incorporating mosaic composition and superclass replacement to
emphasize generalization ability and distinguishing attributes over object
categories. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with SynRES
achieve state-of-the-art performance, improving gIoU by 2.0% on WildRES-ID and
3.8% on WildRES-DS. Code and datasets are available at

*Kerol Djoumessi,Philipp Berens*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出SoftCAM方法，通过修改CNN结构使其具有内在可解释性，避免了传统后处理解释方法的不可靠性，并在医学数据集上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后处理解释方法（如后热图）在关键应用中不可靠且不透明，限制了CNN在高风险决策中的可信度。

Method: 移除全局平均池化层，用卷积层替代全连接分类层，保留空间信息并生成显式的类别激活图。

Result: 在三个医学数据集上，SoftCAM保持了分类性能，同时显著提升了解释的质和量。

Conclusion: CNN可以通过结构修改实现内在可解释性，且不牺牲性能，为高风险决策提供了更可靠的自解释深度学习模型。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for high-stakes
applications like medicine, often surpassing human performance. However, most
explanation methods rely on post-hoc attribution, approximating the
decision-making process of already trained black-box models. These methods are
often sensitive, unreliable, and fail to reflect true model reasoning, limiting
their trustworthiness in critical applications. In this work, we introduce
SoftCAM, a straightforward yet effective approach that makes standard CNN
architectures inherently interpretable. By removing the global average pooling
layer and replacing the fully connected classification layer with a
convolution-based class evidence layer, SoftCAM preserves spatial information
and produces explicit class activation maps that form the basis of the model's
predictions. Evaluated on three medical datasets, SoftCAM maintains
classification performance while significantly improving both the qualitative
and quantitative explanation compared to existing post-hoc methods. Our results
demonstrate that CNNs can be inherently interpretable without compromising
performance, advancing the development of self-explainable deep learning for
high-stakes decision-making.

Conclusion: 总结了核心集选择的开放挑战，如鲁棒性、异常值过滤和适应基础模型，为未来研究指明方向。

Abstract: Coreset selection targets the challenge of finding a small, representative
subset of a large dataset that preserves essential patterns for effective
machine learning. Although several surveys have examined data reduction
strategies before, most focus narrowly on either classical geometry-based
methods or active learning techniques. In contrast, this survey presents a more
comprehensive view by unifying three major lines of coreset research, namely,
training-free, training-oriented, and label-free approaches, into a single
taxonomy. We present subfields often overlooked by existing work, including
submodular formulations, bilevel optimization, and recent progress in
pseudo-labeling for unlabeled datasets. Additionally, we examine how pruning
strategies influence generalization and neural scaling laws, offering new
insights that are absent from prior reviews. Finally, we compare these methods
under varying computational, robustness, and performance demands and highlight
open challenges, such as robustness, outlier filtering, and adapting coreset
selection to foundation models, for future research.

TL;DR: FastCAV是一种加速概念激活向量（CAV）提取的新方法，比现有方法快46.4倍（最高63.6倍），同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAV计算方法在大规模、高维架构中计算成本高、耗时长，限制了其应用。

Method: 提出FastCAV方法，提供理论基础，并在特定假设下证明其与SVM方法等效。

Result: FastCAV计算的CAV性能相似，但更高效稳定，可替代现有方法。

Conclusion: FastCAV使之前不可行的深度模型研究成为可能，例如跟踪模型训练中概念的演变。

Abstract: Concepts such as objects, patterns, and shapes are how humans understand the
world. Building on this intuition, concept-based explainability methods aim to
study representations learned by deep neural networks in relation to
human-understandable concepts. Here, Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs) are an
important tool and can identify whether a model learned a concept or not.
However, the computational cost and time requirements of existing CAV
computation pose a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale,
high-dimensional architectures. To address this limitation, we introduce
FastCAV, a novel approach that accelerates the extraction of CAVs by up to
63.6x (on average 46.4x). We provide a theoretical foundation for our approach
and give concrete assumptions under which it is equivalent to established
SVM-based methods. Our empirical results demonstrate that CAVs calculated with
FastCAV maintain similar performance while being more efficient and stable. In
downstream applications, i.e., concept-based explanation methods, we show that
FastCAV can act as a replacement leading to equivalent insights. Hence, our
approach enables previously infeasible investigations of deep models, which we
demonstrate by tracking the evolution of concepts during model training.

*Maximilian Mueller,Matthias Hein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) examples is an important task for
deploying reliable machine learning models in safety-critial applications.
While post-hoc methods based on the Mahalanobis distance applied to pre-logit
features are among the most effective for ImageNet-scale OOD detection, their
performance varies significantly across models. We connect this inconsistency
to strong variations in feature norms, indicating severe violations of the
Gaussian assumption underlying the Mahalanobis distance estimation. We show
that simple $\ell_2$-normalization of the features mitigates this problem
effectively, aligning better with the premise of normally distributed data with
shared covariance matrix. Extensive experiments on 44 models across diverse
architectures and pretraining schemes show that $\ell_2$-normalization improves
the conventional Mahalanobis distance-based approaches significantly and
consistently, and outperforms other recently proposed OOD detection methods.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks have become a well-explored domain, frequently serving as
evaluation baselines for model robustness. Among these, black-box attacks based
on transferability have received significant attention due to their practical
applicability in real-world scenarios. Traditional black-box methods have
generally focused on improving the optimization framework (e.g., utilizing
momentum in MI-FGSM) to enhance transferability, rather than examining the
dependency on surrogate white-box model architectures. Recent state-of-the-art
approach DiffPGD has demonstrated enhanced transferability by employing
diffusion-based adversarial purification models for adaptive attacks. The
inductive bias of diffusion-based adversarial purification aligns naturally
with the adversarial attack process, where both involving noise addition,
reducing dependency on surrogate white-box model selection. However, the
denoising process of diffusion models incurs substantial computational costs
through chain rule derivation, manifested in excessive VRAM consumption and
extended runtime. This progression prompts us to question whether introducing
diffusion models is necessary. We hypothesize that a model sharing similar
inductive bias to diffusion-based adversarial purification, combined with an
appropriate loss function, could achieve comparable or superior transferability
while dramatically reducing computational overhead. In this paper, we propose a
novel loss function coupled with a unique surrogate model to validate our
hypothesis. Our approach leverages the score of the time-dependent classifier
from classifier-guided diffusion models, effectively incorporating natural data
distribution knowledge into the adversarial optimization process. Experimental
results demonstrate significantly improved transferability across diverse model
architectures while maintaining robustness against diffusion-based defenses.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language tasks, and recent efforts have sought to extend their
capabilities to multimodal domains and resource-constrained environments.
However, existing approaches often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning or
assume fixed training conditions, limiting their generalization when facing
unseen modalities, limited data, or restricted compute resources. This
dissertation presents a systematic study toward generalizing LLM usability
under real-world constraints. First, it introduces a robust text-centric
alignment framework that enables LLMs to seamlessly integrate diverse
modalities-including text, images, tables, and any modalities - via natural
language interfaces. This approach supports in-context adaptation to unseen or
dynamically changing modalities without requiring retraining. To enhance
robustness against noisy and missing modalities, an adversarial prompting
technique is proposed, generating semantically challenging perturbations at the
prompt level to stress-test model reliability. Beyond multimodal setting, the
dissertation investigates inference-time optimization strategies for LLMs,
leveraging prompt search and uncertainty quantification to improve performance
without additional model training. This perspective offers an efficient
alternative to scaling model parameters or retraining from scratch.
Additionally, the work addresses low-resource domains such as Verilog code
generation by designing correct-by-construction synthetic data pipelines and
logic-enhanced reasoning models, achieving state-of-the-art performance with
minimal data. Together, these contributions form a unified effort to enhance
the adaptability, scalability, and efficiency of large language models under
practical constraints.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Test-time scaling methods, such as prolonging
CoT with explicit token-level exploration, can push LRMs' accuracy boundaries,
but they incur significant decoding overhead. A key inefficiency source is LRMs
often generate redundant thinking CoTs, which demonstrate clear structured
overthinking and underthinking patterns. Inspired by human cognitive reasoning
processes and numerical optimization theories, we propose TrimR, a
verifier-based, training-free, efficient framework for dynamic CoT compression
to trim reasoning and enhance test-time scaling, explicitly tailored for
production-level deployment. Our method employs a lightweight, pretrained,
instruction-tuned verifier to detect and truncate redundant intermediate
thoughts of LRMs without any LRM or verifier fine-tuning. We present both the
core algorithm and asynchronous online system engineered for high-throughput
industrial applications. Empirical evaluations on Ascend NPUs and vLLM show
that our framework delivers substantial gains in inference efficiency under
large-batch workloads. In particular, on the four MATH500, AIME24, AIME25, and
GPQA benchmarks, the reasoning runtime of Pangu-R-38B, QwQ-32B, and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B is improved by up to 70% with negligible impact on
accuracy.

*Mingyu Yang,Mehdi Rezagholizadeh,Guihong Li,Vikram Appia,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Zebra-Llama提出了一种高效的混合语言模型构建方法，结合SSM和MLA层，显著提升了推理效率并减少了KV缓存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）需求的增长，提升推理效率对可持续和普及化访问至关重要，但重新训练LLM成本高昂且不环保。

Method: 通过结合状态空间模型（SSM）和多头潜在注意力（MLA）层，使用改进的初始化和后训练流程，从预训练Transformer中高效转移知识。

Result: Zebra-Llama在仅使用7-11B训练标记的情况下，实现了Transformer级别的准确性，同时KV缓存大小降至原始值的3.9%-2.73%。

Conclusion: Zebra-Llama在效率和准确性上均优于现有模型，如MambaInLLaMA等，且训练标记和缓存需求显著降低。

Abstract: With the growing demand for deploying large language models (LLMs) across
diverse applications, improving their inference efficiency is crucial for
sustainable and democratized access. However, retraining LLMs to meet new
user-specific requirements is prohibitively expensive and environmentally
unsustainable. In this work, we propose a practical and scalable alternative:
composing efficient hybrid language models from existing pre-trained models.
Our approach, Zebra-Llama, introduces a family of 1B, 3B, and 8B hybrid models
by combining State Space Models (SSMs) and Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA)
layers, using a refined initialization and post-training pipeline to
efficiently transfer knowledge from pre-trained Transformers. Zebra-Llama
achieves Transformer-level accuracy with near-SSM efficiency using only 7-11B
training tokens (compared to trillions of tokens required for pre-training) and
an 8B teacher. Moreover, Zebra-Llama dramatically reduces KV cache size -down
to 3.9%, 2%, and 2.73% of the original for the 1B, 3B, and 8B variants,
respectively-while preserving 100%, 100%, and >97% of average zero-shot
performance on LM Harness tasks. Compared to models like MambaInLLaMA,
X-EcoMLA, Minitron, and Llamba, Zebra-Llama consistently delivers competitive
or superior accuracy while using significantly fewer tokens, smaller teachers,
and vastly reduced KV cache memory. Notably, Zebra-Llama-8B surpasses
Minitron-8B in few-shot accuracy by 7% while using 8x fewer training tokens,
over 12x smaller KV cache, and a smaller teacher (8B vs. 15B). It also achieves
2.6x-3.8x higher throughput (tokens/s) than MambaInLlama up to a 32k context
length. We will release code and model checkpoints upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管词嵌入在语言建模中至关重要，但其理论理解仍有限，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用单层softmax注意力模型和线性头进行二元分类，分析梯度训练后的嵌入结构。

Result: 训练后嵌入能对齐输出向量，反映词频重要性；softmax选择预测性强的词，最大化分类边界。

Conclusion: 理论与实验（IMDB、Yelp）一致，揭示了嵌入结构的实际意义。

Abstract: Token embeddings play a crucial role in language modeling but, despite this
practical relevance, their theoretical understanding remains limited. Our paper
addresses the gap by characterizing the structure of embeddings obtained via
gradient descent. Specifically, we consider a one-layer softmax attention model
with a linear head for binary classification, i.e., $\texttt{Softmax}( p^\top
E_X^\top ) E_X v = \frac{ \sum_{i=1}^T \exp(p^\top E_{x_i}) E_{x_i}^\top
v}{\sum_{j=1}^T \exp(p^\top E_{x_{j}}) }$, where $E_X = [ E_{x_1} , \dots,
E_{x_T} ]^\top$ contains the embeddings of the input sequence, $p$ is the
embedding of the $\mathrm{\langle cls \rangle}$ token and $v$ the output
vector. First, we show that, already after a single step of gradient training
with the logistic loss, the embeddings $E_X$ capture the importance of tokens
in the dataset by aligning with the output vector $v$ proportionally to the
frequency with which the corresponding tokens appear in the dataset. Then,
after training $p$ via gradient flow until convergence, the softmax selects the
important tokens in the sentence (i.e., those that are predictive of the
label), and the resulting $\mathrm{\langle cls \rangle}$ embedding maximizes
the margin for such a selection. Experiments on real-world datasets (IMDB,
Yelp) exhibit a phenomenology close to that unveiled by our theory.

Abstract: This paper introduces ECHO-LLaMA, an efficient LLaMA architecture designed to
improve both the training speed and inference throughput of LLaMA architectures
while maintaining its learning capacity. ECHO-LLaMA transforms LLaMA models
into shared KV caching across certain layers, significantly reducing KV
computational complexity while maintaining or improving language performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that ECHO-LLaMA achieves up to 77\% higher
token-per-second throughput during training, up to 16\% higher Model FLOPs
Utilization (MFU), and up to 14\% lower loss when trained on an equal number of
tokens. Furthermore, on the 1.1B model, ECHO-LLaMA delivers approximately 7\%
higher test-time throughput compared to the baseline. By introducing a
computationally efficient adaptation mechanism, ECHO-LLaMA offers a scalable
and cost-effective solution for pretraining and finetuning large language
models, enabling faster and more resource-efficient training without
compromising performance.

Motivation: 儿童识字能力是预测其未来生活结果的重要指标，但在低收入和中等收入地区，识字水平与高收入地区存在差距。AI可以作为一种经济高效的工具，帮助评估教育干预的效果。

Method: 研究收集了科萨语儿童语音数据集，并通过三种端到端模型（wav2vec 2.0、HuBERT和Whisper）进行测试，探讨数据量和平衡对模型性能的影响。

Result: 实验表明，wav2vec 2.0在数据受限时通过多类别训练表现更优，数据量和平衡对模型性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究为低资源语言儿童语音识别提供了新数据集和方法，强调了数据收集的重要性，并为未来大规模低成本数据收集提供了参考。

Abstract: Child literacy is a strong predictor of life outcomes at the subsequent
stages of an individual's life. This points to a need for targeted
interventions in vulnerable low and middle income populations to help bridge
the gap between literacy levels in these regions and high income ones. In this
effort, reading assessments provide an important tool to measure the
effectiveness of these programs and AI can be a reliable and economical tool to
support educators with this task. Developing accurate automatic reading
assessment systems for child speech in low-resource languages poses significant
challenges due to limited data and the unique acoustic properties of children's
voices. This study focuses on Xhosa, a language spoken in South Africa, to
advance child speech recognition capabilities. We present a novel dataset
composed of child speech samples in Xhosa. The dataset is available upon
request and contains ten words and letters, which are part of the Early Grade
Reading Assessment (EGRA) system. Each recording is labeled with an online and
cost-effective approach by multiple markers and a subsample is validated by an
independent EGRA reviewer. This dataset is evaluated with three fine-tuned
state-of-the-art end-to-end models: wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, and Whisper. The
results indicate that the performance of these models can be significantly
influenced by the amount and balancing of the available training data, which is
fundamental for cost-effective large dataset collection. Furthermore, our
experiments indicate that the wav2vec 2.0 performance is improved by training
on multiple classes at a time, even when the number of available samples is
constrained.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型（PRMs）需要精细的“步骤”定义，这在长上下文推理模型中难以实现，因此需要一种更简单的方法。

Method: 收集250万条推理轨迹数据集，训练15亿token级价值模型，并应用于DeepSeek模型，采用块级VGS和加权多数投票。

Result: 在64次生成的推理预算下，VGS在四个数学竞赛基准上达到45.7%的平均准确率，与o3-mini-medium持平，且显著减少计算需求。

Conclusion: 该方法在长上下文推理中表现优异，计算效率高，数据集、模型和代码已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method for value model
training on long-context reasoning traces. Compared to existing process reward
models (PRMs), our method does not require a fine-grained notion of "step,"
which is difficult to define for long-context reasoning models. By collecting a
dataset of 2.5 million reasoning traces, we train a 1.5B token-level value
model and apply it to DeepSeek models for improved performance with test-time
compute scaling. We find that block-wise value-guided search (VGS) with a final
weighted majority vote achieves better test-time scaling than standard methods
such as majority voting or best-of-n. With an inference budget of 64
generations, VGS with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-1.5B achieves an average accuracy of
45.7% across four competition math benchmarks (AIME 2024 & 2025, HMMT Feb 2024
& 2025), reaching parity with o3-mini-medium. Moreover, VGS significantly
reduces the inference FLOPs required to achieve the same performance of
majority voting. Our dataset, model and codebase are open-sourced.

Motivation: 现有自训练方法仅关注最终答案质量，忽略推理路径质量，导致可能因偶然正确而选择低质量路径。

Method: 提出CORE-PO方法，利用推理级置信度选择高质量推理路径，并通过策略优化微调LLM。

Result: 在四个分布内和两个分布外基准测试中，CORE-PO优于现有自训练方法。

Conclusion: 推理级置信度是提升LLM自训练效果的关键因素，CORE-PO方法显著提高了输出准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance by generating
reasoning paths before final answers, but learning such a reasoning path
requires costly human supervision. To address this issue, recent studies have
explored self-training methods that improve reasoning capabilities using
pseudo-labels generated by the LLMs themselves. Among these, confidence-based
self-training fine-tunes LLMs to prefer reasoning paths with high-confidence
answers, where confidence is estimated via majority voting. However, such
methods exclusively focus on the quality of the final answer and may ignore the
quality of the reasoning paths, as even an incorrect reasoning path leads to a
correct answer by chance. Instead, we advocate the use of reasoning-level
confidence to identify high-quality reasoning paths for self-training,
supported by our empirical observations. We then propose a new self-training
method, CORE-PO, that fine-tunes LLMs to prefer high-COnfidence REasoning paths
through Policy Optimization. Our experiments show that CORE-PO improves the
accuracy of outputs on four in-distribution and two out-of-distribution
benchmarks, compared to existing self-training methods.

Motivation: 现有方法（如SPEX）在识别LLM特征交互时计算成本高，而LLM的交互通常是层次化的，这为高效发现提供了机会。

Method: ProxySPEX结合梯度提升树和掩码LLM输出，利用层次化交互特性提取重要交互。

Result: 在四个高维数据集上，ProxySPEX比边际方法重建LLM输出的准确性高20%，且计算成本降低10倍。

Conclusion: ProxySPEX通过高效识别层次化交互，显著提升了模型解释性和计算效率。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance by
capturing complex interactions between input features. To identify these
interactions, most existing approaches require enumerating all possible
combinations of features up to a given order, causing them to scale poorly with
the number of inputs $n$. Recently, Kang et al. (2025) proposed SPEX, an
information-theoretic approach that uses interaction sparsity to scale to $n
\approx 10^3$ features. SPEX greatly improves upon prior methods but requires
tens of thousands of model inferences, which can be prohibitive for large
models. In this paper, we observe that LLM feature interactions are often
hierarchical -- higher-order interactions are accompanied by their lower-order
subsets -- which enables more efficient discovery. To exploit this hierarchy,
we propose ProxySPEX, an interaction attribution algorithm that first fits
gradient boosted trees to masked LLM outputs and then extracts the important
interactions. Experiments across four challenging high-dimensional datasets
show that ProxySPEX more faithfully reconstructs LLM outputs by 20% over
marginal attribution approaches while using $10\times$ fewer inferences than
SPEX. By accounting for interactions, ProxySPEX identifies features that
influence model output over 20% more than those selected by marginal
approaches. Further, we apply ProxySPEX to two interpretability tasks. Data
attribution, where we identify interactions among CIFAR-10 training samples
that influence test predictions, and mechanistic interpretability, where we
uncover interactions between attention heads, both within and across layers, on
a question-answering task. ProxySPEX identifies interactions that enable more
aggressive pruning of heads than marginal approaches.

Conclusion: RPG为KL正则化的策略梯度方法提供了系统化的设计和分析工具，并在LLM推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Policy gradient algorithms have been successfully applied to enhance the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Despite the widespread
use of Kullback-Leibler (KL) regularization in policy gradient algorithms to
stabilize training, the systematic exploration of how different KL divergence
formulations can be estimated and integrated into surrogate loss functions for
online reinforcement learning (RL) presents a nuanced and systematically
explorable design space. In this paper, we propose regularized policy gradient
(RPG), a systematic framework for deriving and analyzing KL-regularized policy
gradient methods in the online RL setting. We derive policy gradients and
corresponding surrogate loss functions for objectives regularized by both
forward and reverse KL divergences, considering both normalized and
unnormalized policy distributions. Furthermore, we present derivations for
fully differentiable loss functions as well as REINFORCE-style gradient
estimators, accommodating diverse algorithmic needs. We conduct extensive
experiments on RL for LLM reasoning using these methods, showing improved or
competitive results in terms of training stability and performance compared to
strong baselines such as GRPO, REINFORCE++, and DAPO. The code is available at

Motivation: 音频深度伪造攻击日益猖獗，但现有反欺骗系统主要关注声学层面的扰动，忽视了语言变化的影响。

Method: 通过引入文本层面的对抗攻击，评估开源和商业反欺骗检测器对语言扰动的敏感性。

Result: 实验显示，语言扰动使攻击成功率超过60%，商业检测器准确率从100%降至32%。

Conclusion: 研究强调需在反欺骗系统设计中兼顾语言变化，以提升鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-speech technologies have enabled realistic voice
generation, fueling audio-based deepfake attacks such as fraud and
impersonation. While audio anti-spoofing systems are critical for detecting
such threats, prior work has predominantly focused on acoustic-level
perturbations, leaving the impact of linguistic variation largely unexplored.
In this paper, we investigate the linguistic sensitivity of both open-source
and commercial anti-spoofing detectors by introducing transcript-level
adversarial attacks. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even minor
linguistic perturbations can significantly degrade detection accuracy: attack
success rates surpass 60% on several open-source detector-voice pairs, and
notably one commercial detection accuracy drops from 100% on synthetic audio to
just 32%. Through a comprehensive feature attribution analysis, we identify
that both linguistic complexity and model-level audio embedding similarity
contribute strongly to detector vulnerability. We further demonstrate the
real-world risk via a case study replicating the Brad Pitt audio deepfake scam,
using transcript adversarial attacks to completely bypass commercial detectors.
These results highlight the need to move beyond purely acoustic defenses and
account for linguistic variation in the design of robust anti-spoofing systems.

Result: 实验表明，CoMoE能有效提升MoE的容量，并促进专家模块的模块化。

Conclusion: CoMoE是一种有前景的方法，能够优化MoE在异构数据集上的表现。

Abstract: In parameter-efficient fine-tuning, mixture-of-experts (MoE), which involves
specializing functionalities into different experts and sparsely activating
them appropriately, has been widely adopted as a promising approach to
trade-off between model capacity and computation overhead. However, current MoE
variants fall short on heterogeneous datasets, ignoring the fact that experts
may learn similar knowledge, resulting in the underutilization of MoE's
capacity. In this paper, we propose Contrastive Representation for MoE (CoMoE),
a novel method to promote modularization and specialization in MoE, where the
experts are trained along with a contrastive objective by sampling from
activated and inactivated experts in top-k routing. We demonstrate that such a
contrastive objective recovers the mutual-information gap between inputs and
the two types of experts. Experiments on several benchmarks and in multi-task
settings demonstrate that CoMoE can consistently enhance MoE's capacity and
promote modularization among the experts.

Conclusion: NeUQI为LLMs的量化部署提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance across domains
but face significant challenges when deployed on consumer-grade GPUs or
personal devices such as laptops, due to high memory consumption and inference
costs. Post-training quantization (PTQ) of LLMs offers a promising solution
that reduces their memory footprint and decoding latency. In practice, PTQ with
uniform quantization representation is favored for its efficiency and ease of
deployment since uniform quantization is widely supported by mainstream
hardware and software libraries. Recent studies on $\geq 2$-bit uniform
quantization have led to noticeable improvements in post-quantization model
performance; however, they primarily focus on quantization methodologies, while
the initialization of quantization parameters is underexplored and still relies
on the suboptimal Min-Max strategies. In this work, we propose NeUQI, a method
devoted to efficiently determining near-optimal initial parameters for uniform
quantization. NeUQI is orthogonal to prior quantization methodologies and can
seamlessly integrate with them. The experiments with the LLaMA and Qwen
families on various tasks demonstrate that our NeUQI consistently outperforms
existing methods. Furthermore, when combined with a lightweight distillation
strategy, NeUQI can achieve superior performance to PV-tuning, a much more
resource-intensive approach.

Abstract: Predicting human daily behavior is challenging due to the complexity of

improved behavior prediction by leveraging empirical data from various

emerged as a promising solution, though existing methods are often limited to

uses large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality synthetic behavior

BehaviorGen supports data augmentation and replacement in behavior prediction
models. We evaluate its performance in scenarios such as pertaining
augmentation, fine-tuning replacement, and fine-tuning augmentation, achieving
significant improvements in human mobility and smartphone usage predictions,
with gains of up to 18.9%. Our results demonstrate the potential of BehaviorGen

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的计算效率问题日益突出，现有方法多关注非线性门控机制，但作者认为稀疏性可能存在于FFNN层的全局线性组合中。

Method: 提出M-COUNTDOWN（间接系数）和D-COUNTDOWN（直接系数）两种方法，通过线性组合选择性去除非必要参数。

Result: D-COUNTDOWN可减少90%计算量，性能损失仅5.5%；M-COUNTDOWN无需预测器，性能保留比现有方法高29.4%。

Conclusion: 两种方法通过专用内核实现理论优势，显著加速实际应用。

Abstract: The growing size of large language models has created significant
computational inefficiencies. To address this challenge, sparse activation
methods selectively deactivates non-essential parameters during inference,
reducing computational costs in FFNN layers. While existing methods focus on
non-linear gating mechanisms, we hypothesize that the sparsity of the FFNN
layer lies globally in the form of a linear combination over its internal down
projection matrix. Based on this insight, we propose two methods: M-COUNTDOWN,
leveraging indirect coefficients, and D-COUNTDOWN, utilizing direct
coefficients of the linear combination. Experimental results demonstrate that
D-COUNTDOWN can omit 90% of computations with performance loss as low as 5.5%
ideally, while M-COUNTDOWN provides a predictor-free solution with up to 29.4%

*Ben Rahman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PPO-BR提出了一种自适应RL方法，通过动态调整信任区域，解决了PPO在探索与收敛之间的权衡问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PPO的静态信任区域导致探索与收敛之间的脆弱权衡，限制了其在安全关键系统中的应用。

Method: PPO-BR结合熵驱动扩展（探索）和奖励引导收缩（收敛），动态调整信任区域。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PPO-BR实现了29.1%的更快收敛、2.3倍更低的奖励方差，且运行时开销小于1.8%。

Conclusion: PPO-BR通过简单且理论保证的机制，适用于安全关键领域，如手术机器人和自主无人机。

Abstract: Despite Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) dominating policy gradient methods
-- from robotic control to game AI -- its static trust region forces a brittle
trade-off: aggressive clipping stifles early exploration, while late-stage
updates destabilize convergence. PPO-BR establishes a new paradigm in adaptive
RL by fusing exploration and convergence signals into a single bounded trust
region -- a theoretically grounded innovation that outperforms five SOTA
baselines with less than 2% overhead. This work bridges a critical gap in
phase-aware learning, enabling real-world deployment in safety-critical systems
like robotic surgery within a single adaptive mechanism. PPO-BR achieves 29.1%
faster convergence by combining: (1) entropy-driven expansion (epsilon up) for
exploration in high-uncertainty states, and (2) reward-guided contraction
(epsilon down) for convergence stability. On six diverse benchmarks (MuJoCo,
Atari, sparse-reward), PPO-BR achieves 29.1% faster convergence (p < 0.001),
2.3x lower reward variance than PPO, and less than 1.8% runtime overhead with
only five lines of code change. PPO-BR's simplicity and theoretical guarantees
make it ready-to-deploy in safety-critical domains -- from surgical robotics to
autonomous drones. In contrast to recent methods such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), PPO-BR offers a unified entropy-reward mechanism
applicable to both language models and general reinforcement learning
environments.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了语言模型中MLP神经元的输入与输出权重之间的交互作用，提出了一种基于余弦相似度的方法，发现早期层以“富集神经元”为主，而后期层更多表现为“耗尽神经元”。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注神经元的激活上下文和输出权重，忽略了输入与输出之间的交互作用，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过计算神经元输入与输出权重的余弦相似度，分析12个模型中神经元的交互模式。

Result: 早期层以富集神经元为主，后期层更多表现为耗尽神经元，富集神经元在概念表示中起重要作用。

Conclusion: 输入-输出视角是对现有激活依赖分析和单独处理输入输出方法的补充。

Abstract: Interpretability researchers have attempted to understand MLP neurons of
language models based on both the contexts in which they activate and their
output weight vectors. They have paid little attention to a complementary
aspect: the interactions between input and output. For example, when neurons
detect a direction in the input, they might add much the same direction to the
residual stream ("enrichment neurons") or reduce its presence ("depletion
neurons"). We address this aspect by examining the cosine similarity between
input and output weights of a neuron. We apply our method to 12 models and find
that enrichment neurons dominate in early-middle layers whereas later layers
tend more towards depletion. To explain this finding, we argue that enrichment
neurons are largely responsible for enriching concept representations, one of
the first steps of factual recall. Our input-output perspective is a complement
to activation-dependent analyses and to approaches that treat input and output
separately.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLM）如何通过被动观察和主动干预学习识别黑盒系统的结构，发现主动干预能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI如何通过理解黑盒系统行为加速科学发现，特别是LLM在识别黑盒函数中的潜力。

Method: 通过实验比较LLM在被动观察和主动干预（主动查询黑盒）下的表现，分析其在程序、形式语言和数学方程三类黑盒系统中的逆向工程能力。

Result: LLM仅通过观察无法达到贝叶斯推理的理想效果，但主动干预能显著提升性能，帮助模型避免过度复杂化和忽略观察的常见错误。

Conclusion: 主动干预是提升LLM逆向工程能力的关键，为AI在科学发现中的应用提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Using AI to create autonomous researchers has the potential to accelerate
scientific discovery. A prerequisite for this vision is understanding how well
an AI model can identify the underlying structure of a black-box system from
its behavior. In this paper, we explore how well a large language model (LLM)
learns to identify a black-box function from passively observed versus actively
collected data. We investigate the reverse-engineering capabilities of LLMs
across three distinct types of black-box systems, each chosen to represent
different problem domains where future autonomous AI researchers may have
considerable impact: Program, Formal Language, and Math Equation. Through
extensive experiments, we show that LLMs fail to extract information from
observations, reaching a performance plateau that falls short of the ideal of
Bayesian inference. However, we demonstrate that prompting LLMs to not only
observe but also intervene -- actively querying the black-box with specific
inputs to observe the resulting output -- improves performance by allowing LLMs
to test edge cases and refine their beliefs. By providing the intervention data
from one LLM to another, we show that this improvement is partly a result of
engaging in the process of generating effective interventions, paralleling
results in the literature on human learning. Further analysis reveals that
engaging in intervention can help LLMs escape from two common failure modes:
overcomplication, where the LLM falsely assumes prior knowledge about the
black-box, and overlooking, where the LLM fails to incorporate observations.
These insights provide practical guidance for helping LLMs more effectively
reverse-engineer black-box systems, supporting their use in making new
discoveries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VAPO在实践中表现出色，但缺乏对其理论机制的深入理解，需进一步研究以指导未来发展。

Method: 通过解决价值模型偏差、异质序列长度和稀疏奖励信号等问题，VAPO实现了先进性能。

Result: VAPO在长链推理任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究VAPO的理论机制，以提升其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: The VAPO framework has demonstrated significant empirical success in
enhancing the efficiency and reliability of reinforcement learning for long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tasks with large language models (LLMs). By
systematically addressing challenges such as value model bias, heterogeneous
sequence lengths, and sparse reward signals, VAPO achieves state-of-the-art
performance. While its practical benefits are evident, a deeper theoretical
understanding of its underlying mechanisms and potential limitations is crucial
for guiding future advancements. This paper aims to initiate such a discussion
by exploring VAPO from a theoretical perspective, highlighting areas where its
assumptions might be challenged and where further investigation could yield
more robust and generalizable reasoning agents. We delve into the intricacies
of value function approximation in complex reasoning spaces, the optimality of
adaptive advantage estimation, the impact of token-level optimization, and the
enduring challenges of exploration and generalization.

TL;DR: 研究发现，大语言模型在知识密集数据与网络数据的混合训练中，知识获取存在相变现象，受模型大小和混合比例影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大语言模型在混合数据训练中知识获取的动态特性，揭示其与模型大小和混合比例的关系。

Method: 通过合成传记数据集与网络数据的混合实验，分析模型在不同混合比例和模型大小下的表现。

Result: 发现模型在达到临界值时会突然从几乎不记忆到大量记忆传记，且混合比例低于临界值时模型几乎不学习。

Conclusion: 相变现象源于模型容量分配问题，混合策略需根据模型大小调整。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained on data mixtures: most
data come from web scrapes, while a small portion is curated from high-quality
sources with dense domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we show that when
training LLMs on such data mixtures, knowledge acquisition from knowledge-dense
datasets, unlike training exclusively on knowledge-dense data
(arXiv:2404.05405), does not always follow a smooth scaling law but can exhibit
phase transitions with respect to the mixing ratio and model size. Through
controlled experiments on a synthetic biography dataset mixed with web-scraped
data, we demonstrate that: (1) as we increase the model size to a critical
value, the model suddenly transitions from memorizing very few to most of the
biographies; (2) below a critical mixing ratio, the model memorizes almost
nothing even with extensive training, but beyond this threshold, it rapidly
memorizes more biographies. We attribute these phase transitions to a capacity
allocation phenomenon: a model with bounded capacity must act like a knapsack
problem solver to minimize the overall test loss, and the optimal allocation
across datasets can change discontinuously as the model size or mixing ratio
varies. We formalize this intuition in an information-theoretic framework and
reveal that these phase transitions are predictable, with the critical mixing
ratio following a power-law relationship with the model size. Our findings
highlight a concrete case where a good mixing recipe for large models may not
be optimal for small models, and vice versa.

Result: 实验证明该方法能准确检测多种基准测试、模型和训练方法中的数据污染。

Conclusion: 该方法有效防止基准测试数据泄露，同时提供数据污染检测手段。

Abstract: Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks
contaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or
intentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep
the benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions
to the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single
organization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries.
To overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without
completely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still
maintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject
randomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and
only include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the
best possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is
this helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach
also offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully
capable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this
ceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data
contamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data
contamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training
methodologies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战强化学习（RL）在自我改进中的主导地位，探索监督学习（SL）在无外部教师情况下通过负面反馈实现自主改进的可能性。

Method: 提出NFT方法，通过隐式负策略建模自我生成的负面答案，直接优化模型在所有生成数据上的表现。

Result: 在7B和32B模型的数学推理任务中，NFT显著优于传统SL基线，并匹配或超越GRPO和DAPO等RL算法。理论分析表明NFT与GRPO在严格策略训练下等价。

Conclusion: NFT填补了SL与RL在二元反馈学习系统中的差距，展示了监督学习在自我改进中的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has played a central role in the recent surge of
LLMs' math abilities by enabling self-improvement through binary verifier
signals. In contrast, Supervised Learning (SL) is rarely considered for such
verification-driven training, largely due to its heavy reliance on reference
answers and inability to reflect on mistakes. In this work, we challenge the
prevailing notion that self-improvement is exclusive to RL and propose
Negative-aware Fine-Tuning (NFT) -- a supervised approach that enables LLMs to
reflect on their failures and improve autonomously with no external teachers.
In online training, instead of throwing away self-generated negative answers,
NFT constructs an implicit negative policy to model them. This implicit policy
is parameterized with the same positive LLM we target to optimize on positive
data, enabling direct policy optimization on all LLMs' generations. We conduct
experiments on 7B and 32B models in math reasoning tasks. Results consistently
show that through the additional leverage of negative feedback, NFT
significantly improves over SL baselines like Rejection sampling Fine-Tuning,
matching or even surpassing leading RL algorithms like GRPO and DAPO.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that NFT and GRPO are actually equivalent in
strict-on-policy training, even though they originate from entirely different
theoretical foundations. Our experiments and theoretical findings bridge the
gap between SL and RL methods in binary-feedback learning systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在表格学习任务中表现不佳，而现有的方法多采用静态、目标无关的文本表示，限制了其效果。TabSTAR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TabSTAR解冻预训练的文本编码器，并输入目标标记以学习任务特定的嵌入，其架构不包含数据集特定参数。

Result: TabSTAR在带有文本特征的分类任务基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，且预训练阶段表现出数据集数量的扩展规律。

Conclusion: TabSTAR为表格学习任务提供了一种高效的解决方案，并为未来性能提升提供了路径。

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved remarkable success across many domains, it
has historically underperformed on tabular learning tasks, which remain
dominated by gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs). However, recent
advancements are paving the way for Tabular Foundation Models, which can
leverage real-world knowledge and generalize across diverse datasets,
particularly when the data contains free-text. Although incorporating language
model capabilities into tabular tasks has been explored, most existing methods
utilize static, target-agnostic textual representations, limiting their
effectiveness. We introduce TabSTAR: a Foundation Tabular Model with
Semantically Target-Aware Representations. TabSTAR is designed to enable
transfer learning on tabular data with textual features, with an architecture
free of dataset-specific parameters. It unfreezes a pretrained text encoder and
takes as input target tokens, which provide the model with the context needed
to learn task-specific embeddings. TabSTAR achieves state-of-the-art
performance for both medium- and large-sized datasets across known benchmarks
of classification tasks with text features, and its pretraining phase exhibits
scaling laws in the number of datasets, offering a pathway for further
performance improvements.

TL;DR: 该研究首次全面分析了迭代RLHF中的过优化问题，发现随着迭代次数增加，过优化现象减少，但性能提升逐渐减弱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF方法在调整大语言模型与人类偏好时存在奖励模型过优化问题，导致策略泛化性差，迭代RLHF虽被广泛采用，但其动态机制尚不明确。

Method: 通过AlpacaFarm基准实验，系统分析了奖励模型训练数据传递、优化函数选择及策略初始化等关键设计选择。

Result: 研究发现，随着迭代次数增加，奖励模型更接近真实偏好，过优化减少，但性能提升逐渐减弱；从基础策略重新初始化虽稳健，但限制了优化灵活性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建更稳定、泛化性更强的RLHF流程提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a widely used method for
aligning large language models with human preferences. However, RLHF often
suffers from reward model overoptimisation, in which models overfit to the
reward function, resulting in non-generalisable policies that exploit the
idiosyncrasies and peculiarities of the reward function. A common mitigation is
iterated RLHF, in which reward models are repeatedly retrained with updated
human feedback and policies are re-optimised. Despite its increasing adoption,
the dynamics of overoptimisation in this setting remain poorly understood. In
this work, we present the first comprehensive study of overoptimisation in
iterated RLHF. We systematically analyse key design choices - how reward model
training data is transferred across iterations, which reward function is used
for optimisation, and how policies are initialised. Using the controlled
AlpacaFarm benchmark, we observe that overoptimisation tends to decrease over
successive iterations, as reward models increasingly approximate ground-truth
preferences. However, performance gains diminish over time, and while
reinitialising from the base policy is robust, it limits optimisation
flexibility. Other initialisation strategies often fail to recover from early
overoptimisation. These findings offer actionable insights for building more
stable and generalisable RLHF pipelines.

Result: 识别出15种编辑类型和4种行为模式，显示学生与AI文本的互动涉及复杂认知过程。

Conclusion: 研究发现学生对AI文本的编辑行为复杂，需开发明确的教学策略指导AI文本编辑。

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence is transforming how English as a foreign
language students write. Still, little is known about how students manipulate
text generated by generative AI during the writing process. This study
investigates how EFL secondary school students integrate and modify
AI-generated text when completing an expository writing task. The study
employed an exploratory mixed-methods design. Screen recordings were collected
from 29 Hong Kong secondary school students who attended an AI-assisted writing
workshop and recorded their screens while using generative AI to write an
article. Content analysis with hierarchical coding and thematic analysis with a
multiple case study approach were adopted to analyze the recordings. 15 types
of AI-generated text edits across seven categories were identified from the
recordings. Notably, AI-initiated edits from iOS and Google Docs emerged as
unanticipated sources of AI-generated text. A thematic analysis revealed four
patterns of students' editing behaviors based on planning and drafting
direction: planning with top-down drafting and revising; top-down drafting and
revising without planning; planning with bottom-up drafting and revising; and
bottom-up drafting and revising without planning. Network graphs illustrate
cases of each pattern, demonstrating that students' interactions with
AI-generated text involve more complex cognitive processes than simple text
insertion. The findings challenge assumptions about students' passive,
simplistic use of generative AI tools and have implications for developing
explicit instructional approaches to teaching AI-generated text editing
strategies in the AFL writing pedagogy.

Result: 在英语和日语数据集上降低了WER和CER，并提升了罕见词纠正效果。

Conclusion: 结合语音信息的生成式错误纠正方法显著提升了ASR性能。

Abstract: Generative error correction (GER) with large language models (LLMs) has
emerged as an effective post-processing approach to improve automatic speech
recognition (ASR) performance. However, it often struggles with rare or
domain-specific words due to limited training data. Furthermore, existing
LLM-based GER approaches primarily rely on textual information, neglecting
phonetic cues, which leads to over-correction. To address these issues, we
propose a novel LLM-based GER approach that targets rare words and incorporates
phonetic information. First, we generate synthetic data to contain rare words
for fine-tuning the GER model. Second, we integrate ASR's N-best hypotheses
along with phonetic context to mitigate over-correction. Experimental results
show that our method not only improves the correction of rare words but also
reduces the WER and CER across both English and Japanese datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型（如CLIP和SAM）在2D自然图像上表现优异，但在3D医学图像（如肿瘤分割）中因领域差距和缺乏3D解剖上下文而表现不佳。

Method: 提出TAGS框架，通过保留预训练权重并融合CLIP的语义信息和解剖学特定提示，增强SAM的空间特征提取能力。

Result: 在三个开源肿瘤分割数据集上，TAGS性能超越现有最佳模型（如nnUNet）46.88%，并显著优于其他医学基础模型（至少提升13%）。

Conclusion: TAGS展示了在多样化医学分割任务中的鲁棒性和适应性，为2D基础模型在3D医学领域的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) such as CLIP and SAM have recently shown great
promise in image segmentation tasks, yet their adaptation to 3D medical
imaging-particularly for pathology detection and segmentation-remains
underexplored. A critical challenge arises from the domain gap between natural
images and medical volumes: existing FMs, pre-trained on 2D data, struggle to
capture 3D anatomical context, limiting their utility in clinical applications
like tumor segmentation. To address this, we propose an adaptation framework
called TAGS: Tumor Adaptive Guidance for SAM, which unlocks 2D FMs for 3D
medical tasks through multi-prompt fusion. By preserving most of the
pre-trained weights, our approach enhances SAM's spatial feature extraction
using CLIP's semantic insights and anatomy-specific prompts. Extensive
experiments on three open-source tumor segmentation datasets prove that our
model surpasses the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models (+46.88%
over nnUNet), interactive segmentation frameworks, and other established
medical FMs, including SAM-Med2D, SAM-Med3D, SegVol, Universal, 3D-Adapter, and
SAM-B (at least +13% over them). This highlights the robustness and
adaptability of our proposed framework across diverse medical segmentation
tasks.

Result: SAM在分布内数据上与U-Net表现相当（准确率97.68±3.04），但在分布外数据上泛化能力显著提升，最高领先23%。

Conclusion: SAM在肾结石分割中展现出卓越的适应性和效率，尤其在泛化能力上优于传统模型。

Abstract: The segmentation of kidney stones is regarded as a critical preliminary step
to enable the identification of urinary stone types through machine- or
deep-learning-based approaches. In urology, manual segmentation is considered
tedious and impractical due to the typically large scale of image databases and
the continuous generation of new data. In this study, the potential of the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) -- a state-of-the-art deep learning framework --
is investigated for the automation of kidney stone segmentation. The
performance of SAM is evaluated in comparison to traditional models, including
U-Net, Residual U-Net, and Attention U-Net, which, despite their efficiency,
frequently exhibit limitations in generalizing to unseen datasets. The findings
highlight SAM's superior adaptability and efficiency. While SAM achieves
comparable performance to U-Net on in-distribution data (Accuracy: 97.68 +
3.04; Dice: 97.78 + 2.47; IoU: 95.76 + 4.18), it demonstrates significantly
enhanced generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution data, surpassing
all U-Net variants by margins of up to 23 percent.

and SRR when compared to conventional methods. However, it requires large-scale
external training datasets, which are difficult to obtain for clinical fetal
MRI. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised iterative SVR-SRR
framework for isotropic HR volume reconstruction. Specifically, SVR is
formulated as a function mapping a 2D slice and a 3D target volume to a rigid
transformation matrix, which aligns the slice to the underlying location in the
target volume. The function is parameterized by a convolutional neural network,
which is trained by minimizing the difference between the volume slicing at the
predicted position and the input slice. In SRR, a decoding network embedded
within a deep image prior framework is incorporated with a comprehensive image
degradation model to produce the high-resolution (HR) volume. The deep image
prior framework offers a local consistency prior to guide the reconstruction of
HR volumes. By performing a forward degradation model, the HR volume is
optimized by minimizing loss between predicted slices and the observed slices.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on large-magnitude motion-corrupted
simulation data and clinical data demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed framework over state-of-the-art fetal brain reconstruction frameworks.

TL;DR: 提出一种新型CNN架构，用于胎盘植入谱系障碍（PAS）及其亚型的一阶段多类诊断，基于4,140张MRI切片，模型通过双分支结构和多任务学习实现高效分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎盘植入谱系障碍（PAS）及其亚型（PA、PI、PP）的准确产前诊断对临床至关重要，但现有方法多关注PAS存在性，亚型识别研究有限，且传统方法依赖低效的两阶段分类。

Method: 设计双分支CNN架构：主分类分支采用残差块结构，第二分支整合子宫胎盘区域解剖特征；结合多任务学习策略优化模型性能。

Result: 在真实临床数据集上验证，模型达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 新型CNN架构为PAS及其亚型的高效诊断提供了可行方案，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Placenta Accreta Spectrum Disorders (PAS) pose significant risks during
pregnancy, frequently leading to postpartum hemorrhage during cesarean
deliveries and other severe clinical complications, with bleeding severity
correlating to the degree of placental invasion. Consequently, accurate
prenatal diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes-placenta accreta (PA), placenta
increta (PI), and placenta percreta (PP)-is crucial. However, existing
guidelines and methodologies predominantly focus on the presence of PAS, with
limited research addressing subtype recognition. Additionally, previous
multi-class diagnostic efforts have primarily relied on inefficient two-stage
cascaded binary classification tasks. In this study, we propose a novel
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed for efficient
one-stage multiclass diagnosis of PAS and its subtypes, based on 4,140 magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) slices. Our model features two branches: the main
classification branch utilizes a residual block architecture comprising
multiple residual blocks, while the second branch integrates anatomical
features of the uteroplacental area and the adjacent uterine serous layer to
enhance the model's attention during classification. Furthermore, we implement
a multitask learning strategy to leverage both branches effectively.
Experiments conducted on a real clinical dataset demonstrate that our model
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 结合通道注意力机制和虚拟类注入技术，优化光谱空间特征表示。

Result: 在227例活检确认病例中，平均测试AUC为0.86，优于现有CNN模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效整合DECT数据并减少分类模糊性，为临床提供了一种有前景的非侵入性评估工具。

Abstract: Background: Accurate assessment of metastatic burden in axillary lymph nodes
is crucial for guiding breast cancer treatment decisions, yet conventional
imaging modalities struggle to differentiate metastatic burden levels and
capture comprehensive lymph node characteristics. This study leverages
dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) to exploit spectral-spatial information
for improved multi-class classification. Purpose: To develop a noninvasive
DECT-based model classifying sentinel lymph nodes into three categories: no
metastasis ($N_0$), low metastatic burden ($N_{+(1-2)}$), and heavy metastatic
burden ($N_{+(\geq3)}$), thereby aiding therapeutic planning. Methods: We
propose a novel space-squeeze method combining two innovations: (1) a
channel-wise attention mechanism to compress and recalibrate spectral-spatial
features across 11 energy levels, and (2) virtual class injection to sharpen
inter-class boundaries and compact intra-class variations in the representation
space. Results: Evaluated on 227 biopsy-confirmed cases, our method achieved an
average test AUC of 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.91) across three cross-validation
folds, outperforming established CNNs (VGG, ResNet, etc). The channel-wise
attention and virtual class components individually improved AUC by 5.01% and
5.87%, respectively, demonstrating complementary benefits. Conclusions: The
proposed framework enhances diagnostic AUC by effectively integrating DECT's
spectral-spatial data and mitigating class ambiguity, offering a promising tool
for noninvasive metastatic burden assessment in clinical practice.

Motivation: 医学图像分割中类别不平衡和频率分布问题导致传统CNN和Transformer方法难以捕捉少数类信号或忽略局部细节。

Method: 提出FreqU-FNet，包含频率编码器（低频卷积和小波下采样）、空间可学习解码器和频率感知损失函数。

Result: 在多个医学分割基准测试中，FreqU-FNet优于CNN和Transformer基线，尤其在少数类处理上表现突出。

Conclusion: FreqU-FNet通过利用频率域信息有效解决了医学图像分割中的类别不平衡和局部细节问题。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation faces persistent challenges due to severe class
imbalance and the frequency-specific distribution of anatomical structures.
Most conventional CNN-based methods operate in the spatial domain and struggle
to capture minority class signals, often affected by frequency aliasing and
limited spectral selectivity. Transformer-based models, while powerful in
modeling global dependencies, tend to overlook critical local details necessary
for fine-grained segmentation. To overcome these limitations, we propose
FreqU-FNet, a novel U-shaped segmentation architecture operating in the
frequency domain. Our framework incorporates a Frequency Encoder that leverages
Low-Pass Frequency Convolution and Daubechies wavelet-based downsampling to
extract multi-scale spectral features. To reconstruct fine spatial details, we
introduce a Spatial Learnable Decoder (SLD) equipped with an adaptive
multi-branch upsampling strategy. Furthermore, we design a frequency-aware loss
(FAL) function to enhance minority class learning. Extensive experiments on
multiple medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that FreqU-FNet
consistently outperforms both CNN and Transformer baselines, particularly in
handling under-represented classes, by effectively exploiting discriminative
frequency bands.

Motivation: 随着自动驾驶的发展，多传感器融合技术增加了硬件复杂性和成本，因此需要一种低成本、可扩展的单传感器解决方案。

Method: 利用单目事件相机和路边LED条，通过相位相关技术检测光源间的空间位移，实现高精度三角测量距离估计。

Result: 户外驾驶场景实验表明，该方法在20至60米范围内误差小于0.5米，成功率超过90%。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本、高精度的距离估计提供了可行方案，未来可扩展至实时位置估计，提升自动驾驶导航精度。

Abstract: With the growing adoption of autonomous driving, the advancement of sensor
technology is crucial for ensuring safety and reliable operation. Sensor fusion
techniques that combine multiple sensors such as LiDAR, radar, and cameras have
proven effective, but the integration of multiple devices increases both
hardware complexity and cost. Therefore, developing a single sensor capable of
performing multiple roles is highly desirable for cost-efficient and scalable
autonomous driving systems.
  Event cameras have emerged as a promising solution due to their unique
characteristics, including high dynamic range, low latency, and high temporal
resolution. These features enable them to perform well in challenging lighting
conditions, such as low-light or backlit environments. Moreover, their ability
to detect fine-grained motion events makes them suitable for applications like
pedestrian detection and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication via visible
light.
  In this study, we present a method for distance estimation using a monocular
event camera and a roadside LED bar. By applying a phase-only correlation
technique to the event data, we achieve sub-pixel precision in detecting the
spatial shift between two light sources. This enables accurate
triangulation-based distance estimation without requiring stereo vision. Field
experiments conducted in outdoor driving scenarios demonstrated that the
proposed approach achieves over 90% success rate with less than 0.5-meter error
for distances ranging from 20 to 60 meters.
  Future work includes extending this method to full position estimation by
leveraging infrastructure such as smart poles equipped with LEDs, enabling
event-camera-based vehicles to determine their own position in real time. This
advancement could significantly enhance navigation accuracy, route
optimization, and integration into intelligent transportation systems.

Result: 实验表明，KIDOT在MRI和CT重建中表现优异。

Conclusion: KIDOT通过动态和知识感知的方法，提升了重建的鲁棒性，并更好地利用了未配对数据。

Abstract: Medical image reconstruction from measurement data is a vital but challenging
inverse problem. Deep learning approaches have achieved promising results, but
often requires paired measurement and high-quality images, which is typically
simulated through a forward model, i.e., retrospective reconstruction. However,
training on simulated pairs commonly leads to performance degradation on real
prospective data due to the retrospective-to-prospective gap caused by
incomplete imaging knowledge in simulation. To address this challenge, this
paper introduces imaging Knowledge-Informed Dynamic Optimal Transport (KIDOT),
a novel dynamic optimal transport framework with optimality in the sense of
preserving consistency with imaging physics in transport, that conceptualizes
reconstruction as finding a dynamic transport path. KIDOT learns from unpaired
data by modeling reconstruction as a continuous evolution path from
measurements to images, guided by an imaging knowledge-informed cost function
and transport equation. This dynamic and knowledge-aware approach enhances
robustness and better leverages unpaired data while respecting acquisition
physics. Theoretically, we demonstrate that KIDOT naturally generalizes dynamic
optimal transport, ensuring its mathematical rationale and solution existence.
Extensive experiments on MRI and CT reconstruction demonstrate KIDOT's superior
performance.

Motivation: 早产儿脑室出血（IVH）需早期准确检测，现有深度学习方法在捕捉局部和全局特征上仍有挑战。

Method: 结合CBAM和SAL的Residual U-Net，CBAM优化空间和通道特征，SAL通过稀疏和密集注意力抑制噪声并传播信息。

Result: 在脑超声数据集上，Dice分数89.04%，IoU 81.84%，性能领先。

Conclusion: 结合空间优化和稀疏注意力能有效提升脑解剖结构检测的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is a severe neurological complication among
premature infants, necessitating early and accurate detection from brain
ultrasound (US) images to improve clinical outcomes. While recent deep learning
methods offer promise for computer-aided diagnosis, challenges remain in
capturing both local spatial details and global contextual dependencies
critical for segmenting brain anatomies. In this work, we propose an enhanced
Residual U-Net architecture incorporating two complementary attention
mechanisms: the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and a Sparse
Attention Layer (SAL). The CBAM improves the model's ability to refine spatial
and channel-wise features, while the SAL introduces a dual-branch design,
sparse attention filters out low-confidence query-key pairs to suppress noise,
and dense attention ensures comprehensive information propagation. Extensive
experiments on the Brain US dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art segmentation performance, with a Dice score of 89.04% and IoU
of 81.84% for ventricle region segmentation. These results highlight the
effectiveness of integrating spatial refinement and attention sparsity for
robust brain anatomy detection. Code is available at:

Motivation: 传统超声成像只能捕捉部分骨表面，现有重建方法对不完整数据效果不佳，导致误差和伪影。需要一种更有效的方法来准确重建薄且开放的骨表面。

Conclusion: UltraBoneUDF为开放骨表面重建提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案，适用于临床超声应用。

Abstract: Background: Bone surface reconstruction plays a critical role in
computer-assisted orthopedic surgery. Compared to traditional imaging
modalities such as CT and MRI, ultrasound offers a radiation-free,
cost-effective, and portable alternative. Continuous bone surface
reconstruction can be employed for many clinical applications. However, due to
the inherent limitations of ultrasound imaging, B-mode ultrasound typically
capture only partial bone surfaces. Existing reconstruction methods struggle
with such incomplete data, leading to artifacts and increased reconstruction
errors. Effective techniques for accurately reconstructing thin and open bone
surfaces from real-world 3D ultrasound volumes remain lacking. Methods: We
propose UltraBoneUDF, a self-supervised framework designed for reconstructing
open bone surfaces from ultrasound using neural Unsigned Distance Functions. To
enhance reconstruction quality, we introduce a novel global feature extractor
that effectively fuses ultrasound-specific image characteristics. Additionally,
we present a novel loss function based on local tangent plane optimization that
substantially improves surface reconstruction quality. UltraBoneUDF and
baseline models are extensively evaluated on four open-source datasets.
Results: Qualitative results highlight the limitations of the state-of-the-art
methods for open bone surface reconstruction and demonstrate the effectiveness
of UltraBoneUDF. Quantitatively, UltraBoneUDF significantly outperforms
competing methods across all evaluated datasets for both open and closed bone
surface reconstruction in terms of mean Chamfer distance error: 1.10 mm on the
UltraBones100k dataset (39.6\% improvement compared to the SOTA), 0.23 mm on
the OpenBoneCT dataset (69.3\% improvement), 0.18 mm on the ClosedBoneCT
dataset (70.2\% improvement), and 0.05 mm on the Prostate dataset (55.3\%
improvement).

Conclusion: 该方法显著降低了标注需求，使高质量标注成为可能，为医学图像分割提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of cancer on medical images can aid targeted
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. However, its adoption is limited by the
high cost of expert annotations required for training and inter-observer
variability in datasets. While weakly-supervised methods mitigate some
challenges, using binary histology labels for training as opposed to requiring
full segmentation, they require large paired datasets of histology and images,
which are difficult to curate. Similarly, promptable segmentation aims to allow
segmentation with no re-training for new tasks at inference, however, existing
models perform poorly on pathological regions, again necessitating large
datasets for training. In this work we propose a novel approach for promptable
segmentation requiring only 24 fully-segmented images, supplemented by 8
weakly-labelled images, for training. Curating this minimal data to a high
standard is relatively feasible and thus issues with the cost and variability
of obtaining labels can be mitigated. By leveraging two classifiers, one
weakly-supervised and one fully-supervised, our method refines segmentation
through a guided search process initiated by a single-point prompt. Our
approach outperforms existing promptable segmentation methods, and performs
comparably with fully-supervised methods, for the task of prostate cancer
segmentation, while using substantially less annotated data (up to 100X less).
This enables promptable segmentation with very minimal labelled data, such that
the labels can be curated to a very high standard.

Abstract: We present a fully automated, anatomically guided deep learning pipeline for
prostate cancer (PCa) risk stratification using routine MRI. The pipeline
integrates three key components: an nnU-Net module for segmenting the prostate
gland and its zones on axial T2-weighted MRI; a classification module based on
the UMedPT Swin Transformer foundation model, fine-tuned on 3D patches with
optional anatomical priors and clinical data; and a VAE-GAN framework for
generating counterfactual heatmaps that localize decision-driving image
regions. The system was developed using 1,500 PI-CAI cases for segmentation and
617 biparametric MRIs with metadata from the CHAIMELEON challenge for
classification (split into 70% training, 10% validation, and 20% testing).
Segmentation achieved mean Dice scores of 0.95 (gland), 0.94 (peripheral zone),
and 0.92 (transition zone). Incorporating gland priors improved AUC from 0.69
to 0.72, with a three-scale ensemble achieving top performance (AUC = 0.79,
composite score = 0.76), outperforming the 2024 CHAIMELEON challenge winners.
Counterfactual heatmaps reliably highlighted lesions within segmented regions,
enhancing model interpretability. In a prospective multi-center in-silico trial
with 20 clinicians, AI assistance increased diagnostic accuracy from 0.72 to
0.77 and Cohen's kappa from 0.43 to 0.53, while reducing review time per case
by 40%. These results demonstrate that anatomy-aware foundation models with
counterfactual explainability can enable accurate, interpretable, and efficient
PCa risk assessment, supporting their potential use as virtual biopsies in
clinical practice.

Abstract: Background: Accurate MRI-based identification of extramural vascular invasion
(EVI) and mesorectal fascia invasion (MFI) is pivotal for risk-stratified
management of rectal cancer, yet visual assessment is subjective and vulnerable
to inter-institutional variability. Purpose: To develop and externally evaluate
a multicenter, foundation-model-driven framework that automatically classifies
EVI and MFI on axial and sagittal T2-weighted MRI. Methods: This retrospective
study used 331 pre-treatment rectal cancer MRI examinations from three European
hospitals. After TotalSegmentator-guided rectal patch extraction, a
self-supervised frequency-domain harmonization pipeline was trained to minimize
scanner-related contrast shifts. Four classifiers were compared: ResNet50,
SeResNet, the universal biomedical pretrained transformer (UMedPT) with a
lightweight MLP head, and a logistic-regression variant using frozen UMedPT
features (UMedPT_LR). Results: UMedPT_LR achieved the best EVI detection when
axial and sagittal features were fused (AUC = 0.82; sensitivity = 0.75; F1
score = 0.73), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.74).
The highest MFI performance was attained by UMedPT on axial harmonized images
(AUC = 0.77), surpassing the Chaimeleon Grand-Challenge winner (AUC = 0.75).
Frequency-domain harmonization improved MFI classification but variably
affected EVI performance. Conventional CNNs (ResNet50, SeResNet)
underperformed, especially in F1 score and balanced accuracy. Conclusion: These
findings demonstrate that combining foundation model features, harmonization,
and multi-view fusion significantly enhances diagnostic performance in rectal
MRI.

Abstract: As learned image compression (LIC) methods become increasingly
computationally demanding, enhancing their training efficiency is crucial. This
paper takes a step forward in accelerating the training of LIC methods by
modeling the neural training dynamics. We first propose a Sensitivity-aware
True and Dummy Embedding Training mechanism (STDET) that clusters LIC model
parameters into few separate modes where parameters are expressed as affine
transformations of reference parameters within the same mode. By further
utilizing the stable intra-mode correlations throughout training and parameter
sensitivities, we gradually embed non-reference parameters, reducing the number
of trainable parameters. Additionally, we incorporate a Sampling-then-Moving
Average (SMA) technique, interpolating sampled weights from stochastic gradient
descent (SGD) training to obtain the moving average weights, ensuring smooth
temporal behavior and minimizing training state variances. Overall, our method
significantly reduces training space dimensions and the number of trainable
parameters without sacrificing model performance, thus accelerating model
convergence. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the Noisy quadratic
model, showing that the proposed method achieves a lower training variance than
standard SGD. Our approach offers valuable insights for further developing
efficient training methods for LICs.

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D reconstruction is critical for aerial inspection tasks such
as infrastructure monitoring, structural assessment, and environmental
surveying. While traditional photogrammetry techniques enable geometric
modeling, they lack semantic interpretability, limiting their effectiveness for
automated inspection workflows. Recent advances in neural rendering and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offer efficient, photorealistic reconstructions but
similarly lack scene-level understanding.
  In this work, we present a UAV-based pipeline that extends Feature-3DGS for
language-guided 3D segmentation. We leverage LSeg-based feature fields with
CLIP embeddings to generate heatmaps in response to language prompts. These are
thresholded to produce rough segmentations, and the highest-scoring point is
then used as a prompt to SAM or SAM2 for refined 2D segmentation on novel view
renderings. Our results highlight the strengths and limitations of various
feature field backbones (CLIP-LSeg, SAM, SAM2) in capturing meaningful
structure in large-scale outdoor environments. We demonstrate that this hybrid
approach enables flexible, language-driven interaction with photorealistic 3D
reconstructions, opening new possibilities for semantic aerial inspection and
scene understanding.

Sampling, a method that can generate realistic and diverse multi-person
interactions by leveraging existing two-person motion diffusion models as
motion priors. Instead of training a new model specific to multi-person
interaction synthesis, our key insight is to spatially and temporally separate
complex multi-person interactions into a graph structure of two-person
interactions, which we name the Pairwise Interaction Graph. We thus decompose
the generation task into simultaneous single-person motion generation
conditioned on one other's motion. In addition, to reduce artifacts such as
interpenetrations of body parts in generated multi-person interactions, we
introduce two graph-dependent guidance terms into the diffusion sampling
scheme. Unlike previous work, our method can produce various high-quality
multi-person interactions without having repetitive individual motions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing methods in reducing artifacts when generating a wide range of
two-person and multi-person interactions.

*Zizhang Li,Hong-Xing Yu,Wei Liu,Yin Yang,Charles Herrmann,Gordon Wetzstein,Jiajun Wu*

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: WonderPlay是一个结合物理模拟与视频生成的新框架，能够从单张图像生成动态3D场景。它通过混合生成模拟器实现广泛的3D动态效果，结合物理求解器和视频生成器，提升运动细节和真实感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于刚体或简单弹性动力学，无法处理多样化的动态场景。WonderPlay旨在填补这一空白，提供更灵活、真实的动态生成能力。

Method: 采用混合生成模拟器：先用物理求解器模拟粗略3D动态，再通过视频生成器细化运动细节，最后用生成的视频更新模拟场景，形成闭环。

Result: 实验表明，WonderPlay能处理多种动态场景（如布料、沙子、雪、液体、烟雾等），仅需单张图像输入。

Conclusion: WonderPlay结合了物理模拟的精确性和扩散视频生成的表现力，为用户提供了直观的动态场景控制方式。

Abstract: WonderPlay is a novel framework integrating physics simulation with video
generation for generating action-conditioned dynamic 3D scenes from a single
image. While prior works are restricted to rigid body or simple elastic
dynamics, WonderPlay features a hybrid generative simulator to synthesize a
wide range of 3D dynamics. The hybrid generative simulator first uses a physics
solver to simulate coarse 3D dynamics, which subsequently conditions a video
generator to produce a video with finer, more realistic motion. The generated
video is then used to update the simulated dynamic 3D scene, closing the loop
between the physics solver and the video generator. This approach enables
intuitive user control to be combined with the accurate dynamics of
physics-based simulators and the expressivity of diffusion-based video
generators. Experimental results demonstrate that WonderPlay enables users to
interact with various scenes of diverse content, including cloth, sand, snow,
liquid, smoke, elastic, and rigid bodies -- all using a single image input.

TL;DR: 论文评估了八种视觉语言模型在六项数据可视化理解任务上的表现，发现其表现普遍低于人类，且错误模式与人类不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索视觉语言模型是否能模拟人类对数据可视化的理解能力。

Method: 通过比较八种视觉语言模型与人类在六项数据可视化测试中的表现。

Result: 模型表现普遍低于人类，错误模式与人类显著不同。

Conclusion: 未来需进一步开发更接近人类推理能力的模型。

Abstract: Data visualizations are powerful tools for communicating patterns in
quantitative data. Yet understanding any data visualization is no small feat --
succeeding requires jointly making sense of visual, numerical, and linguistic
inputs arranged in a conventionalized format one has previously learned to
parse. Recently developed vision-language models are, in principle, promising
candidates for developing computational models of these cognitive operations.
However, it is currently unclear to what degree these models emulate human
behavior on tasks that involve reasoning about data visualizations. This gap
reflects limitations in prior work that has evaluated data visualization
understanding in artificial systems using measures that differ from those
typically used to assess these abilities in humans. Here we evaluated eight
vision-language models on six data visualization literacy assessments designed
for humans and compared model responses to those of human participants. We
found that these models performed worse than human participants on average, and
this performance gap persisted even when using relatively lenient criteria to
assess model performance. Moreover, while relative performance across items was
somewhat correlated between models and humans, all models produced patterns of
errors that were reliably distinct from those produced by human participants.
Taken together, these findings suggest significant opportunities for further
development of artificial systems that might serve as useful models of how
humans reason about data visualizations. All code and data needed to reproduce
these results are available at:

TL;DR: ProTAL是一个拖拽链接视频编程框架，用于简化TAL（时序动作定位）中的标签生成，通过定义关键事件和关系来生成大规模未标注视频的动作标签。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TAL模型的训练需要大量手动标注数据，而数据编程方法在TAL中难以定义复杂动作。

Method: 提出ProTAL框架，用户通过拖拽节点和链接定义关键事件及关系，生成动作标签，并结合半监督方法训练TAL模型。

Result: 通过使用场景和用户研究验证了ProTAL的有效性。

Conclusion: ProTAL为设计视频编程框架提供了新思路，简化了TAL标签生成过程。

Abstract: Temporal Action Localization (TAL) aims to detect the start and end
timestamps of actions in a video. However, the training of TAL models requires
a substantial amount of manually annotated data. Data programming is an
efficient method to create training labels with a series of human-defined
labeling functions. However, its application in TAL faces difficulties of
defining complex actions in the context of temporal video frames. In this
paper, we propose ProTAL, a drag-and-link video programming framework for TAL.
ProTAL enables users to define \textbf{key events} by dragging nodes
representing body parts and objects and linking them to constrain the relations
(direction, distance, etc.). These definitions are used to generate action
labels for large-scale unlabelled videos. A semi-supervised method is then
employed to train TAL models with such labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of ProTAL through a usage scenario and a user study, providing insights into
designing video programming framework.

TL;DR: MLLMs在视觉理解任务中表现突出，但存在过度泛化问题。Chart-to-Experience数据集用于评估MLLMs在图表感知和情感影响预测中的表现，发现MLLMs在直接预测中不如人类敏感，但在成对比较中表现可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MLLMs在图表感知和情感影响预测中的表现，验证其性能和有效性，避免过度泛化假设。

Method: 构建Chart-to-Experience数据集（36张图表，7个体验因素），评估MLLMs在直接预测和成对比较任务中的表现。

Result: MLLMs在直接预测中不如人类敏感，但在成对比较中准确可靠。

Conclusion: MLLMs在图表感知任务中表现有限，但在成对比较中具有潜力，需进一步验证和改进。

Abstract: The field of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made remarkable
progress in visual understanding tasks, presenting a vast opportunity to
predict the perceptual and emotional impact of charts. However, it also raises
concerns, as many applications of LLMs are based on overgeneralized assumptions
from a few examples, lacking sufficient validation of their performance and
effectiveness. We introduce Chart-to-Experience, a benchmark dataset comprising
36 charts, evaluated by crowdsourced workers for their impact on seven
experiential factors. Using the dataset as ground truth, we evaluated
capabilities of state-of-the-art MLLMs on two tasks: direct prediction and
pairwise comparison of charts. Our findings imply that MLLMs are not as
sensitive as human evaluators when assessing individual charts, but are
accurate and reliable in pairwise comparisons.

TL;DR: MMMG是一个多模态生成评估基准，涵盖4种模态组合和49个任务，通过模型和程序实现可靠自动评估，与人类评估高度一致（94.3%）。测试显示当前最佳模型在图像生成上表现良好，但在多模态推理和跨模态生成上仍有不足，音频生成改进空间大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动评估多模态生成任务时，现有指标常与人类评估不一致，尤其是复杂多模态任务。为解决这一问题，提出了MMMG基准。

Method: MMMG涵盖4种模态组合（图像、音频、文本与图像交错、文本与音频交错）和49个任务，设计了937条指令，通过模型和程序实现自动评估。

Result: MMMG与人类评估平均一致率达94.3%。测试24个模型发现，最佳模型（GPT Image）图像生成准确率为78.3%，但在多模态推理和跨模态生成上表现不佳，音频生成改进空间显著。

Conclusion: MMMG为多模态生成提供了可靠的评估基准，揭示了当前模型的不足，尤其是音频生成和多模态推理领域，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Automatically evaluating multimodal generation presents a significant
challenge, as automated metrics often struggle to align reliably with human
evaluation, especially for complex tasks that involve multiple modalities. To
address this, we present MMMG, a comprehensive and human-aligned benchmark for
multimodal generation across 4 modality combinations (image, audio, interleaved
text and image, interleaved text and audio), with a focus on tasks that present
significant challenges for generation models, while still enabling reliable
automatic evaluation through a combination of models and programs. MMMG
encompasses 49 tasks (including 29 newly developed ones), each with a carefully
designed evaluation pipeline, and 937 instructions to systematically assess
reasoning, controllability, and other key capabilities of multimodal generation
models. Extensive validation demonstrates that MMMG is highly aligned with
human evaluation, achieving an average agreement of 94.3%. Benchmarking results
on 24 multimodal generation models reveal that even though the state-of-the-art
model, GPT Image, achieves 78.3% accuracy for image generation, it falls short
on multimodal reasoning and interleaved generation. Furthermore, results
suggest considerable headroom for improvement in audio generation, highlighting
an important direction for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源框架在复杂实际应用中表现脆弱，缺乏结构化工作流规划和执行级反馈。

Method: 引入语义工作流接口（SWI）和搜索树规划机制，支持自然语言描述的功能模块和分层决策过程。

Result: 在三个公共基准测试中表现优于现有开源基线，性能接近GPT-Image-1。

Conclusion: ComfyMind为开源通用生成AI系统的发展提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative models, general-purpose generation
has gained increasing attention as a promising approach to unify diverse tasks
across modalities within a single system. Despite this progress, existing
open-source frameworks often remain fragile and struggle to support complex
real-world applications due to the lack of structured workflow planning and
execution-level feedback. To address these limitations, we present ComfyMind, a
collaborative AI system designed to enable robust and scalable general-purpose
generation, built on the ComfyUI platform. ComfyMind introduces two core
innovations: Semantic Workflow Interface (SWI) that abstracts low-level node
graphs into callable functional modules described in natural language, enabling
high-level composition and reducing structural errors; Search Tree Planning
mechanism with localized feedback execution, which models generation as a
hierarchical decision process and allows adaptive correction at each stage.
Together, these components improve the stability and flexibility of complex
generative workflows. We evaluate ComfyMind on three public benchmarks:
ComfyBench, GenEval, and Reason-Edit, which span generation, editing, and
reasoning tasks. Results show that ComfyMind consistently outperforms existing
open-source baselines and achieves performance comparable to GPT-Image-1.
ComfyMind paves a promising path for the development of open-source
general-purpose generative AI systems. Project page:

TL;DR: VideoGameBench是一个评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在实时视频游戏中表现的新基准，包含10款90年代游戏，结果显示前沿模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLMs在人类自然任务（如感知、空间导航）中的能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过VideoGameBench基准测试，要求模型仅凭原始视觉输入和高级目标描述完成游戏。

Result: 前沿模型（如Gemini 2.5 Pro）表现较差，仅完成0.48%的基准任务。

Conclusion: VideoGameBench为研究VLMs在人类技能方面的能力提供了新方向，推动相关研究进展。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved strong results on coding and math
benchmarks that are challenging for humans, yet their ability to perform tasks
that come naturally to humans--such as perception, spatial navigation, and
memory management--remains understudied. Real video games are crafted to be
intuitive for humans to learn and master by leveraging innate inductive biases,
making them an ideal testbed for evaluating such capabilities in VLMs. To this
end, we introduce VideoGameBench, a benchmark consisting of 10 popular video
games from the 1990s that VLMs directly interact with in real-time.
VideoGameBench challenges models to complete entire games with access to only
raw visual inputs and a high-level description of objectives and controls, a
significant departure from existing setups that rely on game-specific
scaffolding and auxiliary information. We keep three of the games secret to
encourage solutions that generalize to unseen environments. Our experiments
show that frontier vision-language models struggle to progress beyond the
beginning of each game. We find inference latency to be a major limitation of
frontier models in the real-time setting; therefore, we introduce
VideoGameBench Lite, a setting where the game pauses while waiting for the LM's
next action. The best performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, completes only 0.48% of
VideoGameBench and 1.6% of VideoGameBench Lite. We hope that the formalization
of the human skills mentioned above into this benchmark motivates progress in
these research directions.

TL;DR: 研究发现增强语言模型的长上下文能力可显著提升其推理性能，即使任务输入较短。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前推理能力的限制可能源于长上下文能力的不足，实验观察到长上下文能力与推理性能正相关。

Method: 比较相同架构和微调数据但长上下文能力不同的模型，验证长上下文能力对推理的影响。

Result: 长上下文能力强的模型在推理任务中表现更优，且这种优势在短输入任务中仍存在。

Conclusion: 长上下文能力是推理的关键基础，建议将其作为未来语言模型设计的核心目标。

Abstract: Recent language models exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, yet the
influence of long-context capacity on reasoning remains underexplored. In this
work, we hypothesize that current limitations in reasoning stem, in part, from
insufficient long-context capacity, motivated by empirical observations such as
(1) higher context window length often leads to stronger reasoning performance,
and (2) failed reasoning cases resemble failed long-context cases. To test this
hypothesis, we examine whether enhancing a model's long-context ability before
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) leads to improved reasoning performance.
Specifically, we compared models with identical architectures and fine-tuning
data but varying levels of long-context capacity. Our results reveal a
consistent trend: models with stronger long-context capacity achieve
significantly higher accuracy on reasoning benchmarks after SFT. Notably, these
gains persist even on tasks with short input lengths, indicating that
long-context training offers generalizable benefits for reasoning performance.
These findings suggest that long-context modeling is not just essential for
processing lengthy inputs, but also serves as a critical foundation for
reasoning. We advocate for treating long-context capacity as a first-class
objective in the design of future language models.

TL;DR: DEL-ToM框架通过动态认知逻辑分解ToM任务，结合验证器PBM提升小语言模型的推理能力，无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小语言模型在ToM任务中因规模限制难以进行深层社会推理，需一种无需架构调整的改进方法。

Method: 将ToM任务分解为基于动态认知逻辑的信念更新序列，训练PBM验证器评分候选推理路径。

Result: 实验表明DEL-ToM在不同规模和基准下均提升性能，验证了信念监督的有效性。

Conclusion: DEL-ToM通过推理时扩展显著增强小语言模型的ToM能力，无需额外训练。

Abstract: Theory-of-Mind (ToM) tasks pose a unique challenge for small language models
(SLMs) with limited scale, which often lack the capacity to perform deep social
reasoning. In this work, we propose DEL-ToM, a framework that improves ToM
reasoning through inference-time scaling rather than architectural changes. Our
approach decomposes ToM tasks into a sequence of belief updates grounded in
Dynamic Epistemic Logic (DEL), enabling structured and transparent reasoning.
We train a verifier, called the Process Belief Model (PBM), to score each
belief update step using labels generated automatically via a DEL simulator.
During inference, candidate belief traces generated by a language model are
evaluated by the PBM, and the highest-scoring trace is selected. This allows
SLMs to emulate more deliberate reasoning by allocating additional compute at
test time. Experiments across multiple model scales and benchmarks show that
DEL-ToM consistently improves performance, demonstrating that verifiable belief
supervision can significantly enhance ToM abilities of SLMs without retraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在抽象推理和泛化能力上的不足，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 将ARC任务定义为程序合成问题，提出RSPC和KAAR两种方法，后者通过分层知识增强逐步提升推理能力。

Result: KAAR显著优于非增强的RSPC，绝对提升约5%，相对提升最高达64.52%。

Conclusion: ARC仍是LLMs的挑战性任务，KAAR展示了知识增强在提升推理能力上的潜力。

Abstract: Recent reasoning-oriented LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on
challenging tasks such as mathematics and science examinations. However, core
cognitive faculties of human intelligence, such as abstract reasoning and
generalization, remain underexplored. To address this, we evaluate recent
reasoning-oriented LLMs on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)
benchmark, which explicitly demands both faculties. We formulate ARC as a
program synthesis task and propose nine candidate solvers. Experimental results
show that repeated-sampling planning-aided code generation (RSPC) achieves the
highest test accuracy and demonstrates consistent generalization across most
LLMs. To further improve performance, we introduce an ARC solver, Knowledge
Augmentation for Abstract Reasoning (KAAR), which encodes core knowledge priors
within an ontology that classifies priors into three hierarchical levels based
on their dependencies. KAAR progressively expands LLM reasoning capacity by
gradually augmenting priors at each level, and invokes RSPC to generate
candidate solutions after each augmentation stage. This stage-wise reasoning
reduces interference from irrelevant priors and improves LLM performance.
Empirical results show that KAAR maintains strong generalization and
consistently outperforms non-augmented RSPC across all evaluated LLMs,
achieving around 5% absolute gains and up to 64.52% relative improvement.
Despite these achievements, ARC remains a challenging benchmark for
reasoning-oriented LLMs, highlighting future avenues of progress in LLMs.

Conclusion: PD$^3$框架有效提升了项目重复检测的准确性和实用性，具有显著的经济效益。

Abstract: Project duplication detection is critical for project quality assessment, as
it improves resource utilization efficiency by preventing investing in newly
proposed project that have already been studied. It requires the ability to
understand high-level semantics and generate constructive and valuable
feedback. Existing detection methods rely on basic word- or sentence-level
comparison or solely apply large language models, lacking valuable insights for
experts and in-depth comprehension of project content and review criteria. To
tackle this issue, we propose PD$^3$, a Project Duplication Detection framework
via adapted multi-agent Debate. Inspired by real-world expert debates, it
employs a fair competition format to guide multi-agent debate to retrieve
relevant projects. For feedback, it incorporates both qualitative and
quantitative analysis to improve its practicality. Over 800 real-world power
project data spanning more than 20 specialized fields are used to evaluate the
framework, demonstrating that our method outperforms existing approaches by
7.43% and 8.00% in two downstream tasks. Furthermore, we establish an online
platform, Review Dingdang, to assist power experts, saving 5.73 million USD in
initial detection on more than 100 newly proposed projects.

Motivation: 现有评测基准多关注事实回忆和孤立任务，未能全面评估LLMs对概念边界的理解能力。

Method: 通过设计基于“Undercover”游戏的多智能体交互游戏CK-Arena，要求模型描述、区分和推断概念边界。

Result: 实验结果显示，LLMs对概念知识的理解在不同类别间差异显著，且与模型参数规模或通用能力不完全相关。

Conclusion: CK-Arena为动态环境中的概念推理提供了一个可扩展且现实的评测基准。

Abstract: Concepts represent generalized abstractions that enable humans to categorize
and reason efficiently, yet it is unclear to what extent Large Language Models
(LLMs) comprehend these semantic relationships. Existing benchmarks typically
focus on factual recall and isolated tasks, failing to evaluate the ability of
LLMs to understand conceptual boundaries. To address this gap, we introduce
CK-Arena, a multi-agent interaction game built upon the Undercover game,
designed to evaluate the capacity of LLMs to reason with concepts in
interactive settings. CK-Arena challenges models to describe, differentiate,
and infer conceptual boundaries based on partial information, encouraging
models to explore commonalities and distinctions between closely related
concepts. By simulating real-world interaction, CK-Arena provides a scalable
and realistic benchmark for assessing conceptual reasoning in dynamic
environments. Experimental results show that LLMs' understanding of conceptual
knowledge varies significantly across different categories and is not strictly
aligned with parameter size or general model capabilities. The data and code
are available at the project homepage: https://ck-arena.site.

Conclusion: 符号回归提示仅在足够大的架构中才能解锁机制性见解，验证了模型组件的有效性。

Abstract: This work presents a dual-agent Large Language Model (LLM)-based reasoning
method for mechanism synthesis, capable of reasoning at both linguistic and
symbolic levels to generate geometrical and dynamic outcomes. The model
consists of a composition of well-defined functions that, starting from a
natural language specification, references abstract properties through
supporting equations, generates and parametrizes simulation code, and elicits
feedback anchor points using symbolic regression and distance functions. This
process closes an actionable refinement loop at the linguistic and symbolic
layers. The approach is shown to be both effective and convergent in the
context of planar mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce MSynth, a novel
benchmark for planar mechanism synthesis, and perform a comprehensive analysis
of the impact of the model components. We further demonstrate that symbolic
regression prompts unlock mechanistic insights only when applied to
sufficiently large architectures.

Result: 评估了八种LLM，开源模型Llama 3.3表现最佳，并通过临床医生验证其框架稳健性。

Conclusion: PatientSim是一个开源、可定制的平台，适用于医疗对话系统评估和医疗教育。

Abstract: Doctor-patient consultations require multi-turn, context-aware communication
tailored to diverse patient personas. Training or evaluating doctor LLMs in
such settings requires realistic patient interaction systems. However, existing
simulators often fail to reflect the full range of personas seen in clinical
practice. To address this, we introduce PatientSim, a patient simulator that
generates realistic and diverse patient personas for clinical scenarios,
grounded in medical expertise. PatientSim operates using: 1) clinical profiles,
including symptoms and medical history, derived from real-world data in the
MIMIC-ED and MIMIC-IV datasets, and 2) personas defined by four axes:
personality, language proficiency, medical history recall level, and cognitive
confusion level, resulting in 37 unique combinations. We evaluated eight LLMs
for factual accuracy and persona consistency. The top-performing open-source
model, Llama 3.3, was validated by four clinicians to confirm the robustness of
our framework. As an open-source, customizable platform, PatientSim provides a
reproducible and scalable solution that can be customized for specific training
needs. Offering a privacy-compliant environment, it serves as a robust testbed
for evaluating medical dialogue systems across diverse patient presentations
and shows promise as an educational tool for healthcare.

Abstract: The rapid progress in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) generation has
created an urgent need for interpretable automatic evaluation methods that can
assess the quality of generated images, therefore reducing the human annotation
burden. To reduce the prohibitive cost of relying on commercial models for
large-scale evaluation, and to improve the reasoning capabilities of
open-source models, recent research has explored supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as dedicated T2I evaluators.
However, SFT approaches typically rely on high-quality critique datasets, which
are either generated by proprietary LLMs-with potential issues of bias and
inconsistency-or annotated by humans at high cost, limiting their scalability
and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-Eval-R1, a
novel reinforcement learning framework that trains open-source MLLMs using only
coarse-grained quality scores, thereby avoiding the need for annotating
high-quality interpretable evaluation rationale. Our approach integrates Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the instruction-tuning process,
enabling models to generate both scalar scores and interpretable reasoning
chains with only easy accessible annotated judgment scores or preferences.
Furthermore, we introduce a continuous reward formulation that encourages score
diversity and provides stable optimization signals, leading to more robust and
discriminative evaluation behavior. Experimental results on three established
T2I meta-evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that T2I-Eval-R1 achieves
significantly higher alignment with human assessments and offers more accurate
interpretable score rationales compared to strong baseline methods.

*Wentao Sun,Joao Paulo Nogueira,Alonso Silva*

TL;DR: 论文提出一种结构化方法，通过构建知识图谱增强LLMs的因果推理能力，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLMs在区分因果关系和相关性方面表现不佳，需要改进其泛化能力。

Method: 提出结构化方法，引导模型构建知识图谱以系统化处理相关性前提，间接回答因果查询。

Result: 在Corr2Cause数据集上，Qwen3-32B模型的F1分数从32.71提升至48.26，相对提升47.5%。

Conclusion: 结构化思维方法显著提升LLMs的因果推理能力，具有广泛泛化潜力。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in the field, LLMs remain unreliable in
distinguishing causation from correlation. Recent results from the Corr2Cause
dataset benchmark reveal that state-of-the-art LLMs -- such as GPT-4 (F1 score:
29.08) -- only marginally outperform random baselines (Random Uniform, F1
score: 20.38), indicating limited capacity of generalization. To tackle this
limitation, we propose a novel structured approach: rather than directly
answering causal queries, we provide the model with the capability to structure
its thinking by guiding the model to build a structured knowledge graph,
systematically encoding the provided correlational premises, to answer the
causal queries. This intermediate representation significantly enhances the
model's causal capabilities. Experiments on the test subset of the Corr2Cause
dataset benchmark with Qwen3-32B model (reasoning model) show substantial gains
over standard direct prompting methods, improving F1 scores from 32.71 to 48.26
(over 47.5% relative increase), along with notable improvements in precision
and recall. These results underscore the effectiveness of providing the model
with the capability to structure its thinking and highlight its promising
potential for broader generalization across diverse causal inference tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的GUI代理因高质量训练数据稀缺而受限，现有ORM模型无法提供细粒度反馈且可能过度惩罚失败轨迹中的有价值步骤。

Method: 提出ProgRM模型，利用LCS自标注算法发现轨迹中的关键步骤并分配进度标签，为在线训练提供密集奖励。

Result: 实验表明，ProgRM训练的代理优于现有领先的专有LLM和ORM训练的代理。

Conclusion: ProgRM通过提供密集的中间奖励，显著提升了代理的性能，代码将在接受后公开。

Abstract: LLM-based (Large Language Model) GUI (Graphical User Interface) agents can
potentially reshape our daily lives significantly. However, current LLM-based
GUI agents suffer from the scarcity of high-quality training data owing to the
difficulties of trajectory collection and reward annotation. Existing works
have been exploring LLMs to collect trajectories for imitation learning or to
offer reward signals for online RL training. However, the Outcome Reward Model
(ORM) used in existing works cannot provide finegrained feedback and can
over-penalize the valuable steps in finally failed trajectories. To this end,
we propose Progress Reward Model (ProgRM) to provide dense informative
intermediate rewards by predicting a task completion progress for each step in
online training. To handle the challenge of progress reward label annotation,
we further design an efficient LCS-based (Longest Common Subsequence)
self-annotation algorithm to discover the key steps in trajectories and assign
progress labels accordingly. ProgRM is evaluated with extensive experiments and
analyses. Actors trained with ProgRM outperform leading proprietary LLMs and
ORM-trained actors, illustrating the effectiveness of ProgRM. The codes for
experiments will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 揭示当前工具调用协议的脆弱性，探索工具描述编辑对LLMs选择行为的影响。

Method: 通过一系列工具描述编辑实验，对比不同模型（如GPT-4.1和Qwen2.5-7B）对工具的使用率变化。

Result: 编辑后的工具描述在某些情况下使工具使用率提升超过10倍，且不同模型对编辑的反应存在差异。

Conclusion: 工具描述编辑对LLMs工具选择有显著影响，需建立更可靠的协议以支持LLMs的工具选择机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can now access a wide range of external tools,
thanks to the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This greatly expands their
abilities as various agents. However, LLMs rely entirely on the text
descriptions of tools to decide which ones to use--a process that is
surprisingly fragile. In this work, we expose a vulnerability in prevalent
tool/function-calling protocols by investigating a series of edits to tool
descriptions, some of which can drastically increase a tool's usage from LLMs
when competing with alternatives. Through controlled experiments, we show that
tools with properly edited descriptions receive over 10 times more usage from
GPT-4.1 and Qwen2.5-7B than tools with original descriptions. We further
evaluate how various edits to tool descriptions perform when competing directly
with one another and how these trends generalize or differ across a broader set
of 10 different models. These phenomenons, while giving developers a powerful
way to promote their tools, underscore the need for a more reliable foundation
for agentic LLMs to select and utilize tools and resources.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的规划方法依赖专家演示，但缺乏明确的安全意识，可能继承不安全行为。

Method: 第一阶段通过自回归轨迹预测器学习专家数据；第二阶段设计规则奖励并使用GRPO强化学习优化模型。

Result: 在nuPlan基准测试中，Plan-R1显著提升安全性和可行性，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: Plan-R1通过两阶段方法成功解决了轨迹规划中的安全问题，为自动驾驶提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Safe and feasible trajectory planning is essential for real-world autonomous
driving systems. However, existing learning-based planning methods often rely
on expert demonstrations, which not only lack explicit safety awareness but
also risk inheriting unsafe behaviors such as speeding from suboptimal human
driving data. Inspired by the success of large language models, we propose
Plan-R1, a novel two-stage trajectory planning framework that formulates
trajectory planning as a sequential prediction task, guided by explicit
planning principles such as safety, comfort, and traffic rule compliance. In
the first stage, we train an autoregressive trajectory predictor via next
motion token prediction on expert data. In the second stage, we design
rule-based rewards (e.g., collision avoidance, speed limits) and fine-tune the
model using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning
strategy, to align its predictions with these planning principles. Experiments
on the nuPlan benchmark demonstrate that our Plan-R1 significantly improves
planning safety and feasibility, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: This paper evaluates single-view mesh reconstruction models for creating
digital twin environments in robot manipulation. Recent advances in computer
vision for 3D reconstruction from single viewpoints present a potential
breakthrough for efficiently creating virtual replicas of physical environments
for robotics contexts. However, their suitability for physics simulations and
robotics applications remains unexplored. We establish benchmarking criteria
for 3D reconstruction in robotics contexts, including handling typical inputs,
producing collision-free and stable reconstructions, managing occlusions, and
meeting computational constraints. Our empirical evaluation using realistic
robotics datasets shows that despite success on computer vision benchmarks,
existing approaches fail to meet robotics-specific requirements. We
quantitively examine limitations of single-view reconstruction for practical
robotics implementation, in contrast to prior work that focuses on multi-view
approaches. Our findings highlight critical gaps between computer vision
advances and robotics needs, guiding future research at this intersection.

Motivation: 现有LLMs的安全对齐方法往往停留在表面，容易受到对抗攻击，且缺乏有效解决方案。研究发现，模型在安全信号学习上存在模糊性，导致无法坚定拒绝有害请求。

Result: 实验表明，该方法以低于0.2倍的开销成本，显著提升了LLMs对抗攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更鲁棒的生成式AI系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Recent studies on the safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) have
revealed that existing approaches often operate superficially, leaving models
vulnerable to various adversarial attacks. Despite their significance, these
studies generally fail to offer actionable solutions beyond data augmentation
for achieving more robust safety mechanisms. This paper identifies a
fundamental cause of this superficiality: existing alignment approaches often
presume that models can implicitly learn a safety-related reasoning task during
the alignment process, enabling them to refuse harmful requests. However, the
learned safety signals are often diluted by other competing objectives, leading
models to struggle with drawing a firm safety-conscious decision boundary when
confronted with adversarial attacks. Based on this observation, by explicitly
introducing a safety-related binary classification task and integrating its
signals with our attention and decoding strategies, we eliminate this ambiguity
and allow models to respond more responsibly to malicious queries. We emphasize
that, with less than 0.2x overhead cost, our approach enables LLMs to assess
the safety of both the query and the previously generated tokens at each
necessary generating step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the resilience of LLMs against various adversarial
attacks, offering a promising pathway toward more robust generative AI systems.

Motivation: 社交媒体中恶意隐写术普遍且隐蔽，传统检测方法难以应对文本碎片化和数据稀疏性等挑战。

Result: 实验表明GSDFuse在复杂对话环境中识别隐写术的性能达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: GSDFuse为解决社交媒体隐写检测问题提供了高效方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: The ubiquity of social media platforms facilitates malicious linguistic
steganography, posing significant security risks. Steganalysis is profoundly
hindered by the challenge of identifying subtle cognitive inconsistencies
arising from textual fragmentation and complex dialogue structures, and the
difficulty in achieving robust aggregation of multi-dimensional weak signals,
especially given extreme steganographic sparsity and sophisticated
steganography. These core detection difficulties are compounded by significant
data imbalance. This paper introduces GSDFuse, a novel method designed to
systematically overcome these obstacles. GSDFuse employs a holistic approach,
synergistically integrating hierarchical multi-modal feature engineering to
capture diverse signals, strategic data augmentation to address sparsity,
adaptive evidence fusion to intelligently aggregate weak signals, and
discriminative embedding learning to enhance sensitivity to subtle
inconsistencies. Experiments on social media datasets demonstrate GSDFuse's
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in identifying sophisticated steganography
within complex dialogue environments. The source code for GSDFuse is available
at https://github.com/NebulaEmmaZh/GSDFuse.

Conclusion: 建议聚焦高风险能力管控，推动防御性AI创新，加强国际合作，平衡安全与技术发展。

Abstract: Open-weight general-purpose AI (GPAI) models offer significant benefits but
also introduce substantial cybersecurity risks, as demonstrated by the
offensive capabilities of models like DeepSeek-R1 in evaluations such as
MITRE's OCCULT. These publicly available models empower a wider range of actors
to automate and scale cyberattacks, challenging traditional defence paradigms
and regulatory approaches. This paper analyzes the specific threats --
including accelerated malware development and enhanced social engineering --
magnified by open-weight AI release. We critically assess current regulations,
notably the EU AI Act and the GPAI Code of Practice, identifying significant
gaps stemming from the loss of control inherent in open distribution, which
renders many standard security mitigations ineffective. We propose a path
forward focusing on evaluating and controlling specific high-risk capabilities
rather than entire models, advocating for pragmatic policy interpretations for
open-weight systems, promoting defensive AI innovation, and fostering
international collaboration on standards and cyber threat intelligence (CTI)
sharing to ensure security without unduly stifling open technological progress.

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了LLM的潜在漏洞，为优化安全机制提供了数据支持，并讨论了两种防御策略。

Abstract: In the era of rapid generative AI development, interactions between humans
and large language models face significant misusing risks. Previous research
has primarily focused on black-box scenarios using human-guided prompts and
white-box scenarios leveraging gradient-based LLM generation methods,
neglecting the possibility that LLMs can act not only as victim models, but
also as attacker models to harm other models. We proposes a novel jailbreaking
method inspired by the Chain-of-Thought mechanism, where the attacker model
uses mission transfer to conceal harmful user intent in dialogue and generates
chained narrative lures to stimulate the reasoning capabilities of victim
models, leading to successful jailbreaking. To enhance the attack success rate,
we introduce a helper model that performs random narrative optimization on the
narrative lures during multi-turn dialogues while ensuring alignment with the
original intent, enabling the optimized lures to bypass the safety barriers of
victim models effectively. Our experiments reveal that models with weaker
safety mechanisms exhibit stronger attack capabilities, demonstrating that
models can not only be exploited, but also help harm others. By incorporating
toxicity scores, we employ third-party models to evaluate the harmfulness of
victim models' responses to jailbreaking attempts. The study shows that using
refusal keywords as an evaluation metric for attack success rates is
significantly flawed because it does not assess whether the responses guide
harmful questions, while toxicity scores measure the harm of generated content
with more precision and its alignment with harmful questions. Our approach
demonstrates outstanding performance, uncovering latent vulnerabilities in LLMs
and providing data-driven feedback to optimize LLM safety mechanisms. We also
discuss two defensive strategies to offer guidance on improving defense
mechanisms.

Conclusion: ArrAttack填补了越狱攻击与防御之间的空白，为生成鲁棒越狱提示提供了新视角。

Abstract: Safety alignment in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly compromised
by jailbreak attacks, which can manipulate these models to generate harmful or
unintended content. Investigating these attacks is crucial for uncovering model
vulnerabilities. However, many existing jailbreak strategies fail to keep pace
with the rapid development of defense mechanisms, such as defensive suffixes,
rendering them ineffective against defended models. To tackle this issue, we
introduce a novel attack method called ArrAttack, specifically designed to
target defended LLMs. ArrAttack automatically generates robust jailbreak
prompts capable of bypassing various defense measures. This capability is
supported by a universal robustness judgment model that, once trained, can
perform robustness evaluation for any target model with a wide variety of
defenses. By leveraging this model, we can rapidly develop a robust jailbreak
prompt generator that efficiently converts malicious input prompts into
effective attacks. Extensive evaluations reveal that ArrAttack significantly
outperforms existing attack strategies, demonstrating strong transferability
across both white-box and black-box models, including GPT-4 and Claude-3. Our
work bridges the gap between jailbreak attacks and defenses, providing a fresh
perspective on generating robust jailbreak prompts. We make the codebase
available at https://github.com/LLBao/ArrAttack.
