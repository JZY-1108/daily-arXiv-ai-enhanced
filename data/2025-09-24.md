### [1] [Dynamic Prompt Fusion for Multi-Task and Cross-Domain Adaptation in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18113)
*Xin Hu,Yue Kang,Guanzi Yao,Tianze Kang,Mengjie Wang,Heyao Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的多任务学习框架，通过动态提示调度机制解决大语言模型在多任务和跨域设置下的泛化限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如SPoT依赖固定提示模板，存在泛化能力不足的问题，需要更灵活的动态提示调度来提升模型在多任务和跨域场景下的性能。

Method: 引入提示池和任务感知调度策略，动态组合和对齐不同任务的提示；使用任务嵌入和门控机制精细控制提示信号；采用联合多任务学习优化目标，包含调度权重的自动学习策略。

Result: 实验证明该方法在语言理解和知识推理任务上显著提升性能，通过敏感性实验验证了提示温度参数和任务数量变化的影响，展示了模型稳定性和可迁移性的优势。

Conclusion: 该动态提示调度机制在统一多任务建模和跨域适应方面具有显著的应用价值和有效性。

Abstract: This study addresses the generalization limitations commonly observed in
large language models under multi-task and cross-domain settings. Unlike prior
methods such as SPoT, which depends on fixed prompt templates, our study
introduces a unified multi-task learning framework with dynamic prompt
scheduling mechanism. By introducing a prompt pool and a task-aware scheduling
strategy, the method dynamically combines and aligns prompts for different
tasks. This enhances the model's ability to capture semantic differences across
tasks. During prompt fusion, the model uses task embeddings and a gating
mechanism to finely control the prompt signals. This ensures alignment between
prompt content and task-specific demands. At the same time, it builds flexible
sharing pathways across tasks. In addition, the proposed optimization objective
centers on joint multi-task learning. It incorporates an automatic learning
strategy for scheduling weights, which effectively mitigates task interference
and negative transfer. To evaluate the effectiveness of the method, a series of
sensitivity experiments were conducted. These experiments examined the impact
of prompt temperature parameters and task number variation. The results confirm
the advantages of the proposed mechanism in maintaining model stability and
enhancing transferability. Experimental findings show that the prompt
scheduling method significantly improves performance on a range of language
understanding and knowledge reasoning tasks. These results fully demonstrate
its applicability and effectiveness in unified multi-task modeling and
cross-domain adaptation.

### [2] [GAUSS: Benchmarking Structured Mathematical Skills for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18122)
*Yue Zhang,Jiaxin Zhang,Qiuyu Ren,Tahsin Saffat,Xiaoxuan Liu,Zitong Yang,Banghua Zhu,Yi Ma*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GAUSS是一个评估LLMs数学能力的基准测试，涵盖12个核心技能维度，分为三个领域：知识与理解、问题解决与沟通、元技能与创造力。通过按认知技能分类问题和设计任务来隔离特定能力，GAUSS构建了全面、细粒度且可解释的模型数学能力画像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏能够全面评估LLMs数学能力的多维度基准测试，需要一种能够揭示模型底层数学智能结构的评估方法。

Method: 设计GAUSS基准测试，将数学问题按12个核心技能维度分类，通过专门设计的任务来隔离和评估特定数学能力。

Result: 应用GAUSS基准测试对GPT-5-thinking进行评估，揭示了其数学能力的优势和弱点，以及与o4-mini-high模型的差异。

Conclusion: GAUSS基准测试提供了多维度的技能评估方法，能够更准确地反映LLMs的数学智能水平，为模型能力评估提供了新的视角。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{GAUSS} (\textbf{G}eneral \textbf{A}ssessment of
\textbf{U}nderlying \textbf{S}tructured \textbf{S}kills in Mathematics), a
benchmark that evaluates LLMs' mathematical abilities across twelve core skill
dimensions, grouped into three domains: knowledge and understanding, problem
solving and communication, and meta-skills and creativity. By categorizing
problems according to cognitive skills and designing tasks that isolate
specific abilities, GAUSS constructs comprehensive, fine-grained, and
interpretable profiles of models' mathematical abilities. These profiles
faithfully represent their underlying mathematical intelligence. To exemplify
how to use the \textsc{GAUSS} benchmark, we have derived the skill profile of
\textsc{GPT-5-thinking}, revealing its strengths and weaknesses as well as its
differences relative to \textsc{o4-mini-high}, thereby underscoring the value
of multidimensional, skill-based evaluation.

### [3] [Event Causality Identification with Synthetic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18156)
*Haoyu Wang,Fengze Liu,Jiayao Zhang,Dan Roth,Kyle Richardson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Rubin因果模型的事件因果关系识别方法，通过将前事件视为治疗、后事件视为结果，利用合成控制方法生成虚拟双胞胎来估计因果效应，在COPES-hard基准上超越了GPT-4等现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的事件因果关系识别方法依赖语言模式和多跳关系推理，容易因因果关系的非正式使用和虚假的图推理而产生错误识别。需要更稳健的因果识别方法。

Method: 采用Rubin因果模型框架，将第一个事件视为治疗，第二个事件视为结果。使用合成控制方法从相关历史数据中生成虚拟双胞胎，利用文本嵌入合成和反演技术来估计治疗干预对结果可能性的影响。

Result: 该方法在因果关系基准COPES-hard上表现出色，识别效果优于包括GPT-4在内的现有方法，能够更稳健地识别事件间的因果关系。

Conclusion: 基于Rubin因果模型的合成控制方法为文本领域的事件因果关系识别提供了新的有效途径，通过概念性干预和虚拟对照组的构建，显著提升了因果识别的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Event causality identification (ECI), a process that extracts causal
relations between events from text, is crucial for distinguishing causation
from correlation. Traditional approaches to ECI have primarily utilized
linguistic patterns and multi-hop relational inference, risking false causality
identification due to informal usage of causality and specious graphical
inference. In this paper, we adopt the Rubin Causal Model to identify event
causality: given two temporally ordered events, we see the first event as the
treatment and the second one as the observed outcome. Determining their
causality involves manipulating the treatment and estimating the resultant
change in the likelihood of the outcome. Given that it is only possible to
implement manipulation conceptually in the text domain, as a work-around, we
try to find a twin for the protagonist from existing corpora. This twin should
have identical life experiences with the protagonist before the treatment but
undergoes an intervention of treatment. However, the practical difficulty of
locating such a match limits its feasibility. Addressing this issue, we use the
synthetic control method to generate such a twin' from relevant historical
data, leveraging text embedding synthesis and inversion techniques. This
approach allows us to identify causal relations more robustly than previous
methods, including GPT-4, which is demonstrated on a causality benchmark,
COPES-hard.

### [4] [ZERA: Zero-init Instruction Evolving Refinement Agent - From Zero Instructions to Structured Prompts via Principle-based Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18158)
*Seungyoun Yi,Minsoo Khang,Sungrae Park*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ZERA是一种新颖的自动提示优化框架，通过联合优化系统提示和用户提示，使用结构化评估标准和最小样本量实现快速收敛到高质量提示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动提示优化方法通常只关注用户提示，依赖非结构化反馈，需要大量样本和长迭代周期，导致成本高且脆弱。

Method: ZERA使用八个可泛化标准对提示进行评分，并通过自动推断权重进行结构化批判性修订，实现低开销的精炼。

Result: 在五个LLM和九个多样化数据集上的实验结果显示，ZERA相比强基线方法取得了持续改进。消融研究验证了各组件对有效提示构建的贡献。

Conclusion: ZERA框架能够通过最小化样本和短迭代周期实现快速收敛到高质量提示，为自动提示优化提供了更高效和稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) improves large language model (LLM)
performance by refining prompts for specific tasks. However, prior APO methods
typically focus only on user prompts, rely on unstructured feedback, and
require large sample sizes and long iteration cycles-making them costly and
brittle. We propose ZERA (Zero-init Instruction Evolving Refinement Agent), a
novel framework that jointly optimizes both system and user prompts through
principled, low-overhead refinement. ZERA scores prompts using eight
generalizable criteria with automatically inferred weights, and revises prompts
based on these structured critiques. This enables fast convergence to
high-quality prompts using minimal examples and short iteration cycles. We
evaluate ZERA across five LLMs and nine diverse datasets spanning reasoning,
summarization, and code generation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate
consistent improvements over strong baselines. Further ablation studies
highlight the contribution of each component to more effective prompt
construction. Our implementation including all prompts is publicly available at
https://github.com/younatics/zera-agent.

### [5] [Thinking in a Crowd: How Auxiliary Information Shapes LLM Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18163)
*Haodong Zhao,Chenyan Zhao,Yansi Li,Zhuosheng Zhang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了外部辅助信息对具有逐步思考能力的大型语言模型推理过程的因果影响，发现模型的思考模式是双刃剑：有益信息提升准确性，但误导信息会导致性能灾难性下降，且思考过程会放大错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在现实场景中处理外部信息（有益、无关或误导）时推理能力的稳健性，特别是在具有逐步思考能力的模型中。

Method: 引入SciAux数据集（基于ScienceQA），系统测试模型对不同类型信息的鲁棒性，分析思考过程对信息处理的影响。

Result: 发现关键脆弱性：思考模式会强化错误信息的影响，导致性能大幅下降，而非提供鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 挑战不仅在于让模型"思考"，更重要的是赋予其评估推理基础信息的批判能力。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason is fundamental to
their application in complex, knowledge-intensive domains. In real-world
scenarios, LLMs are often augmented with external information that can be
helpful, irrelevant, or even misleading. This paper investigates the causal
impact of such auxiliary information on the reasoning process of LLMs with
explicit step-by-step thinking capabilities. We introduce SciAux, a new dataset
derived from ScienceQA, to systematically test the robustness of the model
against these types of information. Our findings reveal a critical
vulnerability: the model's deliberative "thinking mode" is a double-edged
sword. While helpful context improves accuracy, misleading information causes a
catastrophic drop in performance, which is amplified by the thinking process.
Instead of conferring robustness, thinking reinforces the degree of error when
provided with misinformation. This highlights that the challenge is not merely
to make models "think", but to endow them with the critical faculty to evaluate
the information upon which their reasoning is based. The SciAux dataset is
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/billhdzhao/SciAux.

### [6] [SIRAG: Towards Stable and Interpretable RAG with A Process-Supervised Multi-Agent Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18167)
*Junlin Wang,Zehao Wu,Shaowei Lu,Yanlan Li,Xinghao Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种过程监督的多智能体框架来优化检索增强生成（RAG）系统中检索器与生成器的协调问题，通过决策制定器和知识选择器两个轻量级智能体，结合过程级奖励和树状探索策略，提升问答任务的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统中检索器和生成器独立开发导致交互不理想，检索器可能返回不相关文档，生成器未能充分利用检索证据，需要更好的协调机制。

Method: 采用过程监督的多智能体框架，包含决策制定器（控制检索时机）和知识选择器（过滤文档），使用LLM作为评判员提供过程级奖励，通过树状展开策略探索推理路径，并用PPO进行端到端训练。

Result: 在单跳和多跳问答基准测试中，该方法相比标准RAG基线实现了更高准确性、更稳定收敛，并产生更可解释的推理轨迹。

Conclusion: 该框架具有模块化和即插即用特性，无需修改现有检索器或生成器，适用于实际RAG应用场景。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models (LLMs) to
access external knowledge sources, but the effectiveness of RAG relies on the
coordination between the retriever and the generator. Since these components
are developed independently, their interaction is often suboptimal: the
retriever may return irrelevant or redundant documents, while the generator may
fail to fully leverage retrieved evidence. In this work, we propose a
process-supervised multi-agent framework to bridge the gap between retriever
and generator. The framework introduces two lightweight agents: a Decision
Maker, which determines when to continue retrieval or stop for answer
generation, and a Knowledge Selector, which filters retrieved documents to
retain only the most useful evidence. To provide fine-grained supervision, we
employ an LLM-as-a-Judge that evaluates each intermediate action with
process-level rewards, ensuring more accurate credit assignment than relying
solely on final answer correctness. We further adopt a tree-structured rollout
strategy to explore diverse reasoning paths, and train both agents with
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on
single-hop and multi-hop question answering benchmarks show that our approach
achieves higher accuracy, more stable convergence, and produces more
interpretable reasoning trajectories compared with standard RAG baselines.
Importantly, the proposed framework is modular and plug-and-play, requiring no
modification to the retriever or generator, making it practical for real-world
RAG applications.

### [7] [ERFC: Happy Customers with Emotion Recognition and Forecasting in Conversation in Call Centers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18175)
*Aditi Debsharma,Bhushan Jagyasi,Surajit Sen,Priyanka Pandey,Devicharith Dovari,Yuvaraj V. C,Rosalin Parida,Gopali Contractor*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的ERFC架构，用于对话中的情感识别和预测，特别适用于呼叫中心场景，通过预测未来话语的情感来提升客户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在呼叫中心等对话场景中，代理需要了解客户未来话语的情感，以便及时提供适当的解决方案，从而将不满客户转化为满意客户，提升客户体验。

Method: 提出ERFC架构，考虑多模态、情感的不同属性、上下文以及对话中说话者话语的相互依赖性。

Result: 在IEMOCAP数据集上的密集实验证明了所提ERFC的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法在呼叫中心等客户满意度至关重要的应用中具有巨大的商业价值。

Abstract: Emotion Recognition in Conversation has been seen to be widely applicable in
call center analytics, opinion mining, finance, retail, healthcare, and other
industries. In a call center scenario, the role of the call center agent is not
just confined to receiving calls but to also provide good customer experience
by pacifying the frustration or anger of the customers. This can be achieved by
maintaining neutral and positive emotion from the agent. As in any
conversation, the emotion of one speaker is usually dependent on the emotion of
other speaker. Hence the positive emotion of an agent, accompanied with the
right resolution will help in enhancing customer experience. This can change an
unhappy customer to a happy one. Imparting the right resolution at right time
becomes easier if the agent has the insight of the emotion of future
utterances. To predict the emotions of the future utterances we propose a novel
architecture, Emotion Recognition and Forecasting in Conversation. Our proposed
ERFC architecture considers multi modalities, different attributes of emotion,
context and the interdependencies of the utterances of the speakers in the
conversation. Our intensive experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset have shown the
feasibility of the proposed ERFC. This approach can provide a tremendous
business value for the applications like call center, where the happiness of
customer is utmost important.

### [8] [Evaluating Large Language Models for Detecting Antisemitism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18293)
*Jay Patel,Hrudayangam Mehta,Jeremy Blackburn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文评估了8个开源LLM检测反犹内容的能力，提出了Guided-CoT提示技术，显著提升了模型性能，发现Llama 3.1 70B优于微调的GPT-3.5，并分析了LLM在语义分歧和可靠性方面的差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 仇恨内容检测是一个重要但具有挑战性的问题，需要自动化工具来适应社交媒体的快速变化。

Method: 使用上下文定义作为政策指南，探索多种提示技术，设计了新的Guided-CoT提示方法，评估了不同模型大小和解码配置下的性能。

Result: Guided-CoT显著提升了所有评估模型的性能，Llama 3.1 70B超越了微调的GPT-3.5，同时发现了LLM在语义分歧和可靠性方面的显著差异。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在实用性、可解释性和可靠性方面的差异，为仇恨内容检测提供了有效的提示工程方法。

Abstract: Detecting hateful content is a challenging and important problem. Automated
tools, like machine-learning models, can help, but they require continuous
training to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of social media. In this work,
we evaluate eight open-source LLMs' capability to detect antisemitic content,
specifically leveraging in-context definition as a policy guideline. We explore
various prompting techniques and design a new CoT-like prompt, Guided-CoT.
Guided-CoT handles the in-context policy well, increasing performance across
all evaluated models, regardless of decoding configuration, model sizes, or
reasoning capability. Notably, Llama 3.1 70B outperforms fine-tuned GPT-3.5.
Additionally, we examine LLM errors and introduce metrics to quantify semantic
divergence in model-generated rationales, revealing notable differences and
paradoxical behaviors among LLMs. Our experiments highlight the differences
observed across LLMs' utility, explainability, and reliability.

### [9] [Exploiting Tree Structure for Credit Assignment in RL Training of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18314)
*Hieu Tran,Zonghai Yao,Hong Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为TEMPO的新算法，通过前缀树结构实现无critic模型的token级信用分配，解决了强化学习在LLM推理任务中的稀疏奖励问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数学和医疗QA等可验证奖励任务中，只有少数关键决策token影响最终结果，但现有方法如PPO训练复杂且易过拟合，GRPO则忽略了分支结构。

Method: 提出Prefix-to-Tree(P2T)方法将多个响应转换为前缀树，计算非参数化前缀值。基于此开发TEMPO算法，在分支token处加入时间差分修正，实现精确的token级信用分配。

Result: 在Qwen3-1.7B/4B模型上，TEMPO在MATH、MedQA等内外分布基准测试中均优于PPO和GRPO，验证准确率更高且训练时间相当。

Conclusion: TEMPO提供了一种简单有效的无critic强化学习方法，在可验证奖励场景下实现了更好的token级信用分配效果。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning improves LLM reasoning, yet sparse delayed reward over
long sequences makes token-level credit assignment the key bottleneck. We study
the verifiable-reward setting, where the final answer is checkable and multiple
responses can be drawn per prompt. Reasoning tasks in math and medical QA align
with this setup, where only a few decision tokens significantly impact the
outcome. PPO offers token-level advantages with a learned value model, but it
is complex to train both the actor and critic models simultaneously, and it is
not easily generalizable, as the token-level values from the critic model can
make training prone to overfitting. GRPO is critic-free and supports verifiable
rewards, but spreads a single sequence-level return across tokens and ignores
branching. We introduce \textbf{Prefix-to-Tree (P2T)}, a simple procedure that
converts a group of responses into a prefix tree and computes
\emph{nonparametric} prefix values \(V(s)\) by aggregating descendant outcomes.
Built on P2T, we propose \textbf{TEMPO} (\emph{\textbf{T}ree-\textbf{E}stimated
\textbf{M}ean Prefix Value for \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization}), a
critic-free algorithm that augments the group-relative outcome signal of GRPO
with \emph{branch-gated} temporal-difference corrections derived from the tree.
At non-branch tokens, the temporal-difference (TD) term is zero, so TEMPO
reduces to GRPO; at branching tokens, it supplies precise token-level credit
without a learned value network or extra judges/teachers. On Qwen3-1.7B/4B,
TEMPO outperforms PPO and GRPO on in-distribution (MATH, MedQA) and
out-of-distribution (GSM-HARD, AMC23, MedMCQA, MMLU-Medical) benchmarks, and
reaches higher validation accuracy with roughly the same wall-clock time.

### [10] [Brittleness and Promise: Knowledge Graph Based Reward Modeling for Diagnostic Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18316)
*Saksham Khatwani,He Cheng,Majid Afshar,Dmitriy Dligach,Yanjun Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探索了一种将LLM作为知识图谱推理路径奖励模型的新范式，用于医疗诊断推理，通过验证路径而非生成路径来提高可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在诊断推理中缺乏可靠的知识基础推理能力，而知识图谱提供了结构化医学知识，但传统方法只是将KG内容插入提示而非支持结构化推理。

Method: 将LLM训练为KG推理路径的奖励模型，评估五种任务制定方式和八种训练范式，测试路径判断能力是否能泛化到下游诊断任务。

Result: 实验发现特定奖励优化和蒸馏能带来强大的路径判断性能，但向下游任务的可迁移性仍然较弱。

Conclusion: 这是对临床KG进行"奖励模型风格"推理的首次系统评估，为基于奖励的监督如何影响医疗GenAI系统中的诊断推理提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for diagnostic reasoning but often
lack reliable, knowledge grounded inference. Knowledge graphs (KGs), such as
the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), offer structured biomedical
knowledge that can support trustworthy reasoning. Prior approaches typically
integrate KGs via retrieval augmented generation or fine tuning, inserting KG
content into prompts rather than enabling structured reasoning. We explore an
alternative paradigm: treating the LLM as a reward model of KG reasoning paths,
where the model learns to judge whether a candidate path leads to correct
diagnosis for a given patient input. This approach is inspired by recent work
that leverages reward training to enhance model reasoning abilities, and
grounded in computational theory, which suggests that verifying a solution is
often easier than generating one from scratch. It also parallels physicians'
diagnostic assessment, where they judge which sequences of findings and
intermediate conditions most plausibly support a diagnosis. We first
systematically evaluate five task formulation for knowledge path judging and
eight training paradigm. Second, we test whether the path judging abilities
generalize to downstream diagnostic tasks, including diagnosis summarization
and medical question answering. Experiments with three open source
instruct-tuned LLMs reveal both promise and brittleness: while specific reward
optimization and distillation lead to strong path-judging performance, the
transferability to downstream tasks remain weak. Our finding provides the first
systematic assessment of "reward model style" reasoning over clinical KGs,
offering insights into how structured, reward-based supervision influences
diagnostic reasoning in GenAI systems for healthcare.

*Pei-Shuo Wang,Jian-Jia Chen,Chun-Che Yang,Chi-Chih Chang,Ning-Chi Huang,Mohamed S. Abdelfattah,Kai-Chiang Wu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SubSpec是一种无需训练的即插即用方法，通过构建高度对齐的草稿模型来加速参数卸载，在内存受限的GPU上实现无损的LLM推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在内存受限GPU上部署的挑战，现有方法要么牺牲质量（压缩），要么推理速度慢（参数卸载），而推测解码方法通常需要额外训练且加速效果有限。

Method: 通过从卸载的目标LLM部分生成低比特量化替代层来构建高度对齐的草稿模型，共享GPU驻留层和KV缓存，减少内存开销并增强对齐。

Result: 在8GB VRAM限制下，Qwen2.5 7B在MT-Bench上实现9.1倍加速；在24GB VRAM限制下，Qwen2.5 32B在流行生成基准测试中平均实现12.5倍加速。

Conclusion: SubSpec提供了一种高效、无损且无需训练的方法，显著提升了参数卸载场景下LLM的推理速度，解决了模型对齐和内存限制的关键问题。

Abstract: The immense model sizes of large language models (LLMs) challenge deployment
on memory-limited consumer GPUs. Although model compression and parameter
offloading are common strategies to address memory limitations, compression can
degrade quality, and offloading maintains quality but suffers from slow
inference. Speculative decoding presents a promising avenue to accelerate
parameter offloading, utilizing a fast draft model to propose multiple draft
tokens, which are then verified by the target LLM in parallel with a single
forward pass. This method reduces the time-consuming data transfers in forward
passes that involve offloaded weight transfers. Existing methods often rely on
pretrained weights of the same family, but require additional training to align
with custom-trained models. Moreover, approaches that involve draft model
training usually yield only modest speedups. This limitation arises from
insufficient alignment with the target model, preventing higher token
acceptance lengths. To address these challenges and achieve greater speedups,
we propose SubSpec, a plug-and-play method to accelerate parameter offloading
that is lossless and training-free. SubSpec constructs a highly aligned draft
model by generating low-bit quantized substitute layers from offloaded target
LLM portions. Additionally, our method shares the remaining GPU-resident layers
and the KV-Cache, further reducing memory overhead and enhance alignment.
SubSpec achieves a high average acceptance length, delivering 9.1x speedup for
Qwen2.5 7B on MT-Bench (8GB VRAM limit) and an average of 12.5x speedup for
Qwen2.5 32B on popular generation benchmarks (24GB VRAM limit).

### [12] [Speech Vecalign: an Embedding-based Method for Aligning Parallel Speech Documents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18360)
*Chutong Meng,Philipp Koehn*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Speech Vecalign是一种无需文本转录的并行语音文档对齐方法，通过单调对齐语音段嵌入，相比基线方法能产生更长的语音对齐且噪声更少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语音挖掘方法如Global Mining和Local Mining在对齐语音文档时存在对齐长度不足和噪声较多的问题，需要一种更鲁棒的对齐方法。

Method: 提出Speech Vecalign方法，通过单调对齐语音段嵌入来实现语音文档对齐，不依赖文本转录。

Result: 在3000小时未标注的英德平行语音数据上应用，获得约1000小时高质量对齐。训练的语言翻译模型相比Global Mining在英德和德英方向分别提升0.37和0.18 ASR-BLEU，且使用8倍少的数据就能达到或超过SpeechMatrix模型性能。

Conclusion: Speech Vecalign是一种有效的语音文档对齐方法，能显著提升语音翻译性能，且数据效率更高。

Abstract: We present Speech Vecalign, a parallel speech document alignment method that
monotonically aligns speech segment embeddings and does not depend on text
transcriptions. Compared to the baseline method Global Mining, a variant of
speech mining, Speech Vecalign produces longer speech-to-speech alignments. It
also demonstrates greater robustness than Local Mining, another speech mining
variant, as it produces less noise. We applied Speech Vecalign to 3,000 hours
of unlabeled parallel English-German (En-De) speech documents from VoxPopuli,
yielding about 1,000 hours of high-quality alignments. We then trained En-De
speech-to-speech translation models on the aligned data. Speech Vecalign
improves the En-to-De and De-to-En performance over Global Mining by 0.37 and
0.18 ASR-BLEU, respectively. Moreover, our models match or outperform
SpeechMatrix model performance, despite using 8 times fewer raw speech
documents.

### [13] [Interactive Real-Time Speaker Diarization Correction with Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18377)
*Xinlu He,Yiwen Guan,Badrivishal Paurana,Zilin Dai,Jacob Whitehill*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种LLM辅助的说话人日志校正系统，通过实时用户反馈来修正说话人归属错误，显著降低了说话人日志错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数自动语音处理系统在无用户反馈的"开环"模式下运行，而人机协作工作流可以显著提高准确性。

Method: 系统执行流式ASR和说话人日志，使用LLM提供简洁摘要，接受简短语音反馈并立即整合。采用split-when-merged技术检测和分割多说话人段，并基于用户校正进行在线说话人注册。

Result: 在AMI测试集上的LLM驱动模拟显示，该系统将DER降低了9.92%，说话人混淆错误降低了44.23%。

Conclusion: 该系统通过人机协作显著提升了说话人日志的准确性，并分析了不同设置下的校正效果。

Abstract: Most automatic speech processing systems operate in "open loop" mode without
user feedback about who said what; yet, human-in-the-loop workflows can
potentially enable higher accuracy. We propose an LLM-assisted speaker
diarization correction system that lets users fix speaker attribution errors in
real time. The pipeline performs streaming ASR and diarization, uses an LLM to
deliver concise summaries to the users, and accepts brief verbal feedback that
is immediately incorporated without disrupting interactions. Moreover, we
develop techniques to make the workflow more effective: First, a
split-when-merged (SWM) technique detects and splits multi-speaker segments
that the ASR erroneously attributes to just a single speaker. Second, online
speaker enrollments are collected based on users' diarization corrections, thus
helping to prevent speaker diarization errors from occurring in the future.
LLM-driven simulations on the AMI test set indicate that our system
substantially reduces DER by 9.92% and speaker confusion error by 44.23%. We
further analyze correction efficacy under different settings, including summary
vs full transcript display, the number of online enrollments limitation, and
correction frequency.

*Minki Hong,Jangho Choi,Jihie Kim*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: NormGenesis是一个多文化框架，用于生成和标注英语、中文和韩语的社会基础对话，通过Violation-to-Resolution对话类型建模规范违反后的对话进展，提升对话系统的社会适当性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会规范在沟通中决定文化适当行为，使对话系统能产生不仅连贯且社会可接受的回应。现有方法多关注静态规范分类，缺乏对规范违反后对话动态的建模。

Method: 提出Violation-to-Resolution对话类型，建模规范违反后的识别和适当修复过程；采用基于范例的迭代细化方法，在对话合成早期引入语言、情感和社会文化期望的对齐；构建包含10,800个多轮对话的数据集，标注规范遵守、说话者意图和情感回应。

Result: 人类和LLM评估显示，NormGenesis在细化质量、对话自然度和泛化性能上显著优于现有数据集；使用V2R增强数据训练的模型在伦理敏感情境中表现出更好的语用能力。

Conclusion: 本研究为文化自适应对话建模建立了新基准，提供了跨语言和文化多样性语言的规范感知生成的可扩展方法。

Abstract: Social norms govern culturally appropriate behavior in communication,
enabling dialogue systems to produce responses that are not only coherent but
also socially acceptable. We present NormGenesis, a multicultural framework for
generating and annotating socially grounded dialogues across English, Chinese,
and Korean. To model the dynamics of social interaction beyond static norm
classification, we propose a novel dialogue type, Violation-to-Resolution
(V2R), which models the progression of conversations following norm violations
through recognition and socially appropriate repair. To improve pragmatic
consistency in underrepresented languages, we implement an exemplar-based
iterative refinement early in the dialogue synthesis process. This design
introduces alignment with linguistic, emotional, and sociocultural expectations
before full dialogue generation begins. Using this framework, we construct a
dataset of 10,800 multi-turn dialogues annotated at the turn level for norm
adherence, speaker intent, and emotional response. Human and LLM-based
evaluations demonstrate that NormGenesis significantly outperforms existing
datasets in refinement quality, dialogue naturalness, and generalization
performance. We show that models trained on our V2R-augmented data exhibit
improved pragmatic competence in ethically sensitive contexts. Our work
establishes a new benchmark for culturally adaptive dialogue modeling and
provides a scalable methodology for norm-aware generation across linguistically
and culturally diverse languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大型语言模型生成波斯文学文本的能力，特别是包含文化相关表达的能力，使用改编的托兰斯创造力测试进行四维度评估，并验证LLM作为自动评分工具的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注英语文学创作，缺乏对非英语文学传统的探索，且没有标准化的创造力评估方法。本文旨在填补波斯文学领域的这一空白。

Method: 构建包含20个主题的用户生成波斯文学数据集，采用托兰斯创造力测试的四个维度（原创性、流畅性、灵活性、精细化）进行评估，使用LLM作为自动评分工具并与人工评分进行可靠性验证。

Result: LLM作为评分工具与人工评分表现出强一致性，同时分析了模型理解和使用四种核心文学手法（明喻、隐喻、夸张、对立）的能力。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLM在波斯文学文本生成中的优势和局限性，强调了进一步改进的必要性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated notable creative abilities in
generating literary texts, including poetry and short stories. However, prior
research has primarily centered on English, with limited exploration of
non-English literary traditions and without standardized methods for assessing
creativity. In this paper, we evaluate the capacity of LLMs to generate Persian
literary text enriched with culturally relevant expressions. We build a dataset
of user-generated Persian literary spanning 20 diverse topics and assess model
outputs along four creativity dimensions-originality, fluency, flexibility, and
elaboration-by adapting the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking. To reduce
evaluation costs, we adopt an LLM as a judge for automated scoring and validate
its reliability against human judgments using intraclass correlation
coefficients, observing strong agreement. In addition, we analyze the models'
ability to understand and employ four core literary devices: simile, metaphor,
hyperbole, and antithesis. Our results highlight both the strengths and
limitations of LLMs in Persian literary text generation, underscoring the need
for further refinement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于语言模型和对话对齐分数的自动化方法来测量医患共同决策，通过深度学习模型和BERT模型分析157个医患对话，发现对话对齐分数与共同决策结果显著相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏自动测量医患共同决策的方法，需要开发可扩展的自动化技术来评估患者中心护理的实现程度。

Method: 使用157个视频记录的医患对话，转录为42,559个句子，通过上下文-响应对和负采样训练深度学习模型和微调BERT模型，计算四种对话对齐分数，并与共同决策结果进行关联分析。

Result: 深度学习模型和BERT模型都能有效计算对话对齐分数，其中Max CA分数与OPTION12评分显著相关，BERTbase模型计算的Max CA分数与决策冲突量表显著相关。

Conclusion: 本研究首次提出了基于可解释对话对齐分数的自动化、可扩展的医患共同决策测量方法，具有大规模评估共同决策策略的潜力。

Abstract: Shared decision-making (SDM) is necessary to achieve patient-centred care.
Currently no methodology exists to automatically measure SDM at scale. This
study aimed to develop an automated approach to measure SDM by using language
modelling and the conversational alignment (CA) score. A total of 157
video-recorded patient-doctor conversations from a randomized multi-centre
trial evaluating SDM decision aids for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillations
were transcribed and segmented into 42,559 sentences. Context-response pairs
and negative sampling were employed to train deep learning (DL) models and
fine-tuned BERT models via the next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Each
top-performing model was used to calculate four types of CA scores. A
random-effects analysis by clinician, adjusting for age, sex, race, and trial
arm, assessed the association between CA scores and SDM outcomes: the
Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS) and the Observing Patient Involvement in
Decision-Making 12 (OPTION12) scores. p-values were corrected for multiple
comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Among 157 patients (34% female,
mean age 70 SD 10.8), clinicians on average spoke more words than patients
(1911 vs 773). The DL model without the stylebook strategy achieved a recall@1
of 0.227, while the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) achieved the highest recall@1
with 0.640. The AbsMax (18.36 SE7.74 p=0.025) and Max CA (21.02 SE7.63 p=0.012)
scores generated with the DL without stylebook were associated with OPTION12.
The Max CA score generated with the fine-tuned BERTbase (110M) was associated
with the DCS score (-27.61 SE12.63 p=0.037). BERT model sizes did not have an
impact the association between CA scores and SDM. This study introduces an
automated, scalable methodology to measure SDM in patient-doctor conversations
through explainable CA scores, with potential to evaluate SDM strategies at
scale.

### [17] [CogniLoad: A Synthetic Natural Language Reasoning Benchmark With Tunable Length, Intrinsic Difficulty, and Distractor Density](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18458)
*Daniel Kaiser,Arnoldo Frigessi,Ali Ramezani-Kebrya,Benjamin Ricaud*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CogniLoad是一个基于认知负荷理论的新型合成基准测试，用于精确分析LLM的长上下文推理能力，通过独立调节内在难度、干扰因素和任务长度等参数来系统评估模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的长上下文推理基准测试往往模糊了关键因素（如任务复杂性、干扰因素和任务长度），无法进行精确的失败分析。

Method: 基于认知负荷理论（CLT）设计合成基准CogniLoad，生成自然语言逻辑谜题，通过独立调节三个核心维度：内在难度（控制内在负荷）、干扰-信号比（调节外部负荷）和任务长度（作为相关负荷的代理指标）。

Result: 评估22个SotA推理LLM发现：任务长度是主要约束因素，模型对内在复杂性有不同容忍度，对干扰比呈现U型响应模式。

Conclusion: CogniLoad通过系统控制认知负荷维度，为剖析LLM推理局限性和指导未来模型开发提供了可重现、可扩展且诊断性丰富的工具。

Abstract: Current benchmarks for long-context reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs)
often blur critical factors like intrinsic task complexity, distractor
interference, and task length. To enable more precise failure analysis, we
introduce CogniLoad, a novel synthetic benchmark grounded in Cognitive Load
Theory (CLT). CogniLoad generates natural-language logic puzzles with
independently tunable parameters that reflect CLT's core dimensions: intrinsic
difficulty ($d$) controls intrinsic load; distractor-to-signal ratio ($\rho$)
regulates extraneous load; and task length ($N$) serves as an operational proxy
for conditions demanding germane load. Evaluating 22 SotA reasoning LLMs,
CogniLoad reveals distinct performance sensitivities, identifying task length
as a dominant constraint and uncovering varied tolerances to intrinsic
complexity and U-shaped responses to distractor ratios. By offering systematic,
factorial control over these cognitive load dimensions, CogniLoad provides a
reproducible, scalable, and diagnostically rich tool for dissecting LLM
reasoning limitations and guiding future model development.

*Zeyu Liu,Souvik Kundu,Lianghao Jiang,Anni Li,Srikanth Ronanki,Sravan Bodapati,Gourav Datta,Peter A. Beerel*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LAWCAT提出了一种线性注意力框架，通过蒸馏预训练Transformer模型，在保持高性能的同时显著降低计算复杂度，适用于长序列处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Transformer的二次计算复杂度限制了其在长序列应用中的效率，而从头训练线性复杂度模型又需要大量资源。LAWCAT旨在高效地将预训练Transformer能力迁移到线性注意力架构中。

Method: LAWCAT结合因果Conv1D层增强局部依赖建模，使用归一化门控线性注意力提升不同上下文长度的泛化能力，通过蒸馏方法在短序列上训练模型。

Result: 蒸馏Mistral-7B仅使用1K长度序列即可在22K tokens上达到90%以上的passkey检索准确率；Llama3.2-1B变体在多个长上下文基准测试中表现优异，预训练token需求不到0.1%。

Conclusion: LAWCAT为高性能长上下文线性模型提供了高效路径，减少了对大量长序列训练数据和计算资源的依赖，特别适合边缘部署场景。

Abstract: Although transformer architectures have achieved state-of-the-art performance
across diverse domains, their quadratic computational complexity with respect
to sequence length remains a significant bottleneck, particularly for
latency-sensitive long-context applications. While recent linear-complexity
alternatives are increasingly powerful, effectively training them from scratch
is still resource-intensive. To overcome these limitations, we propose LAWCAT
(Linear Attention with Convolution Across Time), a novel linearization
framework designed to efficiently transfer the capabilities of pre-trained
transformers into a performant linear attention architecture. LAWCAT integrates
causal Conv1D layers to enhance local dependency modeling and employs
normalized gated linear attention to improve generalization across varying
context lengths. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that, distilling
Mistral-7B with only 1K-length sequences yields over 90\% passkey retrieval
accuracy up to 22K tokens, significantly extending its effective context
window. Similarly, Llama3.2-1B LAWCAT variant achieves competitive performance
on S-NIAH 1\&2\&3 tasks (1K-8K context length) and BABILong benchmark
(QA2\&QA3, 0K-16K context length), requiring less than 0.1\% pre-training
tokens compared with pre-training models. Furthermore, LAWCAT exhibits faster
prefill speeds than FlashAttention-2 for sequences exceeding 8K tokens. LAWCAT
thus provides an efficient pathway to high-performance, long-context linear
models suitable for edge deployment, reducing reliance on extensive
long-sequence training data and computational resources.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在文本丰富的图机器学习任务中应用增多，但缺乏对LLM与图数据交互能力的系统性理解，需要评估不同交互模式在图数据上的表现

Method: 进行大规模控制评估，涵盖多个关键变量轴：LLM-图交互模式（提示、工具使用、代码生成）、数据集领域、结构机制、特征特性、模型配置等，并系统性地截断特征、删除边和移除标签来分析依赖关系

Result: 1) 代码生成方法在图形数据上表现最强，特别是在长文本或高密度图中优势显著；2) 所有交互策略在异质图中都保持有效；3) 代码生成能够灵活调整对结构、特征或标签的依赖，利用最信息丰富的输入类型

Conclusion: 研究结果提供了当前LLM-图交互模式的全面视图，突出了其优势和局限性，并为未来方法提供了关键设计原则

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for text-rich graph
machine learning tasks such as node classification in high-impact domains like
fraud detection and recommendation systems. Yet, despite a surge of interest,
the field lacks a principled understanding of the capabilities of LLMs in their
interaction with graph data. In this work, we conduct a large-scale, controlled
evaluation across several key axes of variability to systematically assess the
strengths and weaknesses of LLM-based graph reasoning methods in text-based
applications. The axes include the LLM-graph interaction mode, comparing
prompting, tool-use, and code generation; dataset domains, spanning citation,
web-link, e-commerce, and social networks; structural regimes contrasting
homophilic and heterophilic graphs; feature characteristics involving both
short- and long-text node attributes; and model configurations with varying LLM
sizes and reasoning capabilities. We further analyze dependencies by
methodically truncating features, deleting edges, and removing labels to
quantify reliance on input types. Our findings provide practical and actionable
guidance. (1) LLMs as code generators achieve the strongest overall performance
on graph data, with especially large gains on long-text or high-degree graphs
where prompting quickly exceeds the token budget. (2) All interaction
strategies remain effective on heterophilic graphs, challenging the assumption
that LLM-based methods collapse under low homophily. (3) Code generation is
able to flexibly adapt its reliance between structure, features, or labels to
leverage the most informative input type. Together, these findings provide a
comprehensive view of the strengths and limitations of current LLM-graph
interaction modes and highlight key design principles for future approaches.

Motivation: 开发一种能够自动生成符合特定韵律的阿拉伯诗歌的技术，支持古典阿拉伯诗歌的创作过程。

Method: 使用规则化的字形到韵律转换提取韵律，采用条件去噪目标微调ByT5模型，结合课程学习策略（先在通用阿拉伯数据集上预训练，再在诗歌数据集上微调），并探索从英语到阿拉伯语的跨语言迁移。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提出的模型在保持语义连贯性的同时，实现了高度的韵律对齐。

Conclusion: 该模型在古典阿拉伯诗歌创作过程中具有协同创作应用的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for inserting phrases in Arabic poems to
conform to a specific rhythm using ByT5, a byte-level multilingual
transformer-based model. Our work discusses a rule-based grapheme-to-beat
transformation tailored for extracting the rhythm from fully diacritized Arabic
script. Our approach employs a conditional denoising objective to fine-tune
ByT5, where the model reconstructs masked words to match a target rhythm. We
adopt a curriculum learning strategy, pre-training on a general Arabic dataset
before fine-tuning on poetic dataset, and explore cross-lingual transfer from
English to Arabic. Experimental results demonstrate that our models achieve
high rhythmic alignment while maintaining semantic coherence. The proposed
model has the potential to be used in co-creative applications in the process
of composing classical Arabic poems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ChatGPT的广泛使用引发了对AI生成文本滥用的担忧，现有词级检测器易受改写攻击，存在偏见，且需要大型模型或在线LLM交互

Method: 使用预训练语言模型编码句子嵌入，通过注意力建模句子关系，采用对比学习缓解自回归生成偏见，结合因果图和反事实方法分离结构特征与主题相关偏见

Result: 在两个精心策划的数据集（包括摘要比较和修订的生活FAQ）上的实验验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测原始和改写后的AI生成文本，解决了现有检测器的局限性

Abstract: The widespread adoption of ChatGPT has raised concerns about its misuse,
highlighting the need for robust detection of AI-generated text. Current
word-level detectors are vulnerable to paraphrasing or simple prompts (PSP),
suffer from biases induced by ChatGPT's word-level patterns (CWP) and training
data content, degrade on modified text, and often require large models or
online LLM interaction. To tackle these issues, we introduce a novel task to
detect both original and PSP-modified AI-generated texts, and propose a
lightweight framework that classifies texts based on their internal structure,
which remains invariant under word-level changes. Our approach encodes sentence
embeddings from pre-trained language models and models their relationships via
attention. We employ contrastive learning to mitigate embedding biases from
autoregressive generation and incorporate a causal graph with counterfactual
methods to isolate structural features from topic-related biases. Experiments
on two curated datasets, including abstract comparisons and revised life FAQs,
validate the effectiveness of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理策略在大型语言模型上有效，但在小型模型上效果不佳，需要专门为SLMs设计有效的推理方法。

Method: 基于循环一致性原理，从推理路径和答案生成问题，评估与原问题的相似度，选择最高相似度的候选方案。使用专门的Flan-T5模型生成问题。

Result: 在8个模型上验证，CCQA在数学和常识推理基准测试中一致优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: CCQA为SLMs建立了新的高效推理基准，证明了循环一致性方法在小模型上的有效性。

Abstract: Recently, inference-time reasoning strategies have further improved the
accuracy of large language models (LLMs), but their effectiveness on smaller
models remains unclear. Based on the observation that conventional approaches
often fail to improve performance in this context, we propose
\textbf{C}ycle-\textbf{C}onsistency in \textbf{Q}uestion \textbf{A}nswering
(CCQA), a novel reasoning method that can be effectively applied to SLMs.
Inspired by cycle consistency, CCQA generates a question from each reasoning
path and answer, evaluates each by its similarity to the original question, and
then selects the candidate solution with the highest similarity score as the
final response. Since conventional SLMs struggle to generate accurate questions
from their own reasoning paths and answers, we employ a lightweight Flan-T5
model specialized for question generation to support this process efficiently.
From the experimental results, it is verified that CCQA consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across eight models on
mathematical and commonsense reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, our method
establishes a new practical baseline for efficient reasoning in SLMs. Source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于困惑度(PPL)的数据过滤方法存在时间成本高、对噪声和分布外样本不可靠的问题，需要更高效可靠的替代方案

Method: 基于语料库词频统计估计token先验，通过token先验的均值和标准差来过滤文档，无需模型推理

Result: 在20个下游基准测试中取得最高平均性能，同时将时间成本降低1000倍以上

Conclusion: 该方法简单但强大，适用于代码和数学等符号语言，并能无监督地动态适应多语言语料库

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are pretrained on massive web corpora,
careful selection of data becomes essential to ensure effective and efficient
learning. While perplexity (PPL)-based filtering has shown strong performance,
it suffers from drawbacks: substantial time costs and inherent unreliability of
the model when handling noisy or out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we
propose a simple yet powerful alternative: a prior-based data filtering method
that estimates token priors using corpus-level term frequency statistics,
inspired by linguistic insights on word roles and lexical density. Our approach
filters documents based on the mean and standard deviation of token priors,
serving as a fast proxy to PPL while requiring no model inference. Despite its
simplicity, the prior-based filter achieves the highest average performance
across 20 downstream benchmarks, while reducing time cost by over 1000x
compared to PPL-based filtering. We further demonstrate its applicability to
symbolic languages such as code and math, and its dynamic adaptability to
multilingual corpora without supervision

Motivation: 完全微调所有模型参数计算成本高且内存密集，现有参数高效微调方法忽视了不同模型层的敏感度差异和训练数据的重要性。

Method: TsqLoRA包含两个主要组件：质量感知采样机制选择最具信息量的训练数据，以及动态秩分配模块根据每层对参数更新的敏感度调整其秩。

Result: 实验结果表明，TsqLoRA在多种NLP任务上提高了微调效率，同时保持甚至提升了性能。

Conclusion: TsqLoRA通过结合数据质量选择和敏感度感知的低秩适应，为资源受限环境下的模型微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pre-trained models for downstream tasks has become a
fundamental approach in natural language processing. Fully fine-tuning all
model parameters is computationally expensive and memory-intensive, especially
in resource-constrained environments. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning
methods reduce the number of trainable parameters but typically overlook the
varying sensitivity of different model layers and the importance of training
data. In this work, we propose TsqLoRA, a novel method that integrates
data-quality-driven selection with sensitivity-aware low-rank adaptation,
consisted of two main components: a quality-aware sampling mechanism for
selecting the most informative training data, and a dynamic rank allocation
module that adjusts the rank of each layer based on its sensitivity to
parameter updates. The experimental results demonstrate that TsqLoRA improves
fine-tuning efficiency while maintaining or even improving performance on a
variety of NLP tasks. Our code will be available at

Motivation: 现有的统一模型（如GPT-5）在视觉语言任务上表现良好，但无法正确理解ECG信号并提供准确的医疗诊断，也无法生成ECG信号。

Method: 采用解耦的两阶段训练方法：第一阶段学习基于证据的解释技能（ECG到文本），第二阶段通过潜在空间对齐注入ECG生成能力（文本到ECG）。

Result: UniECG能够根据用户输入自主选择解释或生成ECG，显著扩展了当前ECG模型的能力边界。

Conclusion: UniECG是ECG领域的重要突破，为医疗诊断和ECG信号处理提供了统一解决方案，代码和检查点将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent unified models such as GPT-5 have achieved encouraging progress on

correctly understand ECG signals and provide accurate medical diagnoses, nor
can they correctly generate ECG signals. To address these limitations, we
propose UniECG, the first unified model for ECG capable of concurrently
performing evidence-based ECG interpretation and text-conditioned ECG
generation tasks. Through a decoupled two-stage training approach, the model
first learns evidence-based interpretation skills (ECG-to-Text), and then
injects ECG generation capabilities (Text-to-ECG) via latent space alignment.
UniECG can autonomously choose to interpret or generate an ECG based on user
input, significantly extending the capability boundaries of current ECG models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLM生成计划的帮助性是否与用户偏好一致，验证现有对齐方法（如RLHF）基于偏好的假设是否可靠。

Method: 使用Planorama接口，让126名用户回答300个多步骤问题，收集4388个计划执行和5584个比较数据，测量计划帮助性和用户偏好。

Result: 用户/模型偏好和代理成功率不能准确预测计划对用户的帮助性；用户偏好与帮助性无关；表面特征（如简洁性）与偏好相关但无法预测帮助性。

Conclusion: 需要基于真实用户交互的反馈来对齐有帮助的LLM，而不仅仅是基于看起来有帮助的偏好。

Abstract: To assist users in complex tasks, LLMs generate plans: step-by-step
instructions towards a goal. While alignment methods aim to ensure LLM plans
are helpful, they train (RLHF) or evaluate (ChatbotArena) on what users prefer,
assuming this reflects what helps them. We test this with Planorama: an
interface where 126 users answer 300 multi-step questions with LLM plans. We
get 4388 plan executions and 5584 comparisons to measure plan helpfulness (QA
success) and user preferences on plans, and recreate the setup in agents and
reward models to see if they simulate or prefer what helps users. We expose: 1)
user/model preferences and agent success do not accurately predict which plans
help users, so common alignment feedback can misalign with helpfulness; 2) this
gap is not due to user-specific preferences, as users are similarly successful
when using plans they prefer/disprefer; 3) surface-level cues like brevity and
question similarity strongly link to preferences, but such biases fail to
predict helpfulness. In all, we argue aligning helpful LLMs needs feedback from
real user interactions, not just preferences of what looks helpful, so we
discuss the plan NLP researchers can execute to solve this problem.

capabilities to multi-hop question answering (MHQA). However, these methods
often lack consistency, leading to knowledge contamination, unstable updates,
and retrieval behaviors that fail to reflect the intended edits. Such
inconsistencies undermine the reliability of PPKE in multi- hop reasoning. We
present CAPE-KG, Consistency-Aware Parameter-Preserving Editing with Knowledge
Graphs, a novel consistency-aware framework for PPKE on MHQA. CAPE-KG ensures
KG construction, update, and retrieval are always aligned with the requirements
of the MHQA task, maintaining coherent reasoning over both unedited and edited
knowledge. Extensive experiments on the MQuAKE benchmark show accuracy
improvements in PPKE performance for MHQA, demonstrating the effectiveness of
addressing consistency in PPKE.

*Huanxin Sheng,Xinyi Liu,Hangfeng He,Jieyu Zhao,Jian Kang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个通过共形预测分析LLM作为评判者不确定性的框架，为LLM评分提供预测区间，并设计了针对离散评分任务的序数边界调整方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为评判者的评估不确定性尚未充分探索，这种可靠性不足可能限制其在许多应用中的部署。

Method: 使用共形预测构建连续预测区间，设计序数边界调整处理离散评分任务，并提出区间中点作为低偏差评分替代方案。

Result: 实验表明共形预测能提供具有覆盖保证的有效预测区间，区间中点和重新提示评判者有助于改善判断质量。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM评估提供了不确定性量化方法，提高了LLM作为评判者的可靠性，有助于其在真实场景中的应用部署。

Abstract: LLM-as-a-judge has become a promising paradigm for using large language
models (LLMs) to evaluate natural language generation (NLG), but the
uncertainty of its evaluation remains underexplored. This lack of reliability
may limit its deployment in many applications. This work presents the first
framework to analyze the uncertainty by offering a prediction interval of
LLM-based scoring via conformal prediction. Conformal prediction constructs
continuous prediction intervals from a single evaluation run, and we design an
ordinal boundary adjustment for discrete rating tasks. We also suggest a
midpoint-based score within the interval as a low-bias alternative to raw model
score and weighted average. We perform extensive experiments and analysis,
which show that conformal prediction can provide valid prediction interval with
coverage guarantees. We also explore the usefulness of interval midpoint and
judge reprompting for better judgment.

TL;DR: MemOrb：一种轻量级即插即用的语言强化记忆层，通过提炼多轮交互为紧凑策略反思，显著提升LLM智能体在客服场景中的成功率和稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM智能体存在跨会话遗忘、重复错误和缺乏持续自我改进机制的问题，在需要稳定性和一致性的动态环境中不可靠

Method: 提出MemOrb记忆层，将多轮交互提炼为策略反思存储在共享记忆库中，无需微调即可检索指导决策

Result: 实验显示MemOrb显著提升成功率（多轮成功率最高提升63个百分点）和稳定性，在重复试验中表现更一致

Conclusion: 结构化反思是增强冻结LLM智能体在客服场景中长期可靠性的有效机制

Abstract: Large Language Model-based agents(LLM-based agents) are increasingly deployed
in customer service, yet they often forget across sessions, repeat errors, and
lack mechanisms for continual self-improvement. This makes them unreliable in
dynamic settings where stability and consistency are critical. To better
evaluate these properties, we emphasize two indicators: task success rate as a
measure of overall effectiveness, and consistency metrics such as Pass$^k$ to
capture reliability across multiple trials. To address the limitations of
existing approaches, we propose MemOrb, a lightweight and plug-and-play verbal
reinforcement memory layer that distills multi-turn interactions into compact
strategy reflections. These reflections are stored in a shared memory bank and
retrieved to guide decision-making, without requiring any fine-tuning.
Experiments show that MemOrb significantly improves both success rate and
stability, achieving up to a 63 percentage-point gain in multi-turn success
rate and delivering more consistent performance across repeated trials. Our
results demonstrate that structured reflection is a powerful mechanism for
enhancing long-term reliability of frozen LLM agents in customer service
scenarios.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LOTUSDIS是一个公开的泰语会议语料库，包含114小时自发对话，用于推进远场对话语音识别研究。该数据集通过多种麦克风在不同距离录制，提供了真实的环境效果。研究显示微调Whisper模型能显著提升远场语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决远场对话语音识别中现有模型对泰语远场语音适应性差的问题，提供专门针对远场场景的泰语数据集来促进相关研究。

Method: 收集114小时自发泰语对话，使用9个独立单通道设备在0.12-10米距离录制，提供标准数据集划分和可复现的基线系统，对Whisper模型进行零样本和微调测试。

Result: 零样本模型随距离增加性能显著下降，微调后整体WER从64.3降至38.3，远场WER从81.6降至49.5，在远距离麦克风上提升尤其明显。

Conclusion: 距离多样化的训练数据对构建鲁棒的语音识别系统至关重要，LOTUSDIS数据集为远场泰语语音识别研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: We present LOTUSDIS, a publicly available Thai meeting corpus designed to
advance far-field conversational ASR. The dataset comprises 114 hours of
spontaneous, unscripted dialogue collected in 15-20 minute sessions with three
participants, where overlapping speech is frequent and natural. Speech was
recorded simultaneously by nine independent single-channel devices spanning six
microphone types at distances from 0.12 m to 10 m, preserving the authentic
effects of reverberation, noise, and device coloration without relying on
microphone arrays. We provide standard train, dev, test splits and release a
reproducible baseline system. We benchmarked several Whisper variants under
zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Off-the-shelf models showed strong
degradation with distance, confirming a mismatch between pre-training data and
Thai far-field speech. Fine-tuning on LOTUSDIS dramatically improved
robustness: a Thai Whisper baseline reduced overall WER from 64.3 to 38.3 and
far-field WER from 81.6 to 49.5, with especially large gains on the most
distant microphones. These results underscore the importance of
distance-diverse training data for robust ASR. The corpus is available under
CC-BY-SA 4.0. We also release training and evaluation scripts as a baseline
system to promote reproducible research in this field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DyGRASP是一种针对动态文本属性图（DyTAGs）的新方法，结合LLMs和时序GNNs，有效捕捉近期和全局时间语义，在节点检索任务上实现高达34%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要针对静态文本属性图，难以处理DyTAGs中的时间演化特性和文本语义依赖，且LLMs在处理大量动态文本时存在效率问题。

Method: 设计节点中心隐式推理和滑动窗口机制捕捉近期语义；使用显式推理和RNN-like链结构捕获全局语义动态；通过更新和融合层整合近期/全局语义与图结构信息。

Result: 在DyTAG基准测试中，DyGRASP在目标节点检索任务的Hit@10指标上提升高达34%，且在不同时序GNNs和LLMs上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: DyGRASP有效解决了DyTAGs中的时间语义捕捉问题，为动态文本属性图分析提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic Text-Attribute Graphs (DyTAGs), characterized by time-evolving graph
interactions and associated text attributes, are prevalent in real-world
applications. Existing methods, such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large
Language Models (LLMs), mostly focus on static TAGs. Extending these existing
methods to DyTAGs is challenging as they largely neglect the recent-global
temporal semantics: the recent semantic dependencies among interaction texts
and the global semantic evolution of nodes over time. Furthermore, applying
LLMs to the abundant and evolving text in DyTAGs faces efficiency issues. To
tackle these challenges, we propose Dynamic Global-Recent Adaptive Semantic
Processing (DyGRASP), a novel method that leverages LLMs and temporal GNNs to
efficiently and effectively reason on DyTAGs. Specifically, we first design a
node-centric implicit reasoning method together with a sliding window mechanism
to efficiently capture recent temporal semantics. In addition, to capture
global semantic dynamics of nodes, we leverage explicit reasoning with tailored
prompts and an RNN-like chain structure to infer long-term semantics. Lastly,
we intricately integrate the recent and global temporal semantics as well as
the dynamic graph structural information using updating and merging layers.
Extensive experiments on DyTAG benchmarks demonstrate DyGRASP's superiority,
achieving up to 34% improvement in Hit@10 for destination node retrieval task.
Besides, DyGRASP exhibits strong generalization across different temporal GNNs
and LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了多语言分词器中词汇重叠对跨语言迁移的影响，通过控制实验发现词汇重叠有助于跨语言语义关系的捕捉，并能提升模型在跨语言任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多语言分词器自然会产生跨语言的重叠词汇，但现有研究对词汇重叠是促进跨语言迁移还是引入语言间干扰存在争议，且受词汇频率、分词粒度等因素干扰。

Method: 设计了控制实验，在多种语言对上训练双语自回归模型，系统性地改变词汇重叠设置，并引入语义相似性这一新维度来分析重叠的影响。

Result: 分析模型隐藏表示发现，任何类型的重叠都能创建捕捉跨语言语义关系的嵌入空间，而词汇不相交的模型此效应较弱。在XNLI和XQuAD任务上，有重叠的模型表现优于词汇不相交的模型，且迁移性能随重叠增加而提升。

Conclusion: 词汇重叠在多语言模型中具有优势，保持大量共享词汇仍然是多语言分词器的有益设计选择。

Abstract: Subword tokenizers trained on multilingual corpora naturally produce
overlapping tokens across languages. Does token overlap facilitate
cross-lingual transfer or instead introduce interference between languages?
Prior work offers mixed evidence, partly due to varied setups and confounders,
such as token frequency or subword segmentation granularity. To address this
question, we devise a controlled experiment where we train bilingual
autoregressive models on multiple language pairs under systematically varied
vocabulary overlap settings. Crucially, we explore a new dimension to
understanding how overlap affects transfer: the semantic similarity of tokens
shared across languages. We first analyze our models' hidden representations
and find that overlap of any kind creates embedding spaces that capture
cross-lingual semantic relationships, while this effect is much weaker in
models with disjoint vocabularies. On XNLI and XQuAD, we find that models with
overlap outperform models with disjoint vocabularies, and that transfer
performance generally improves as overlap increases. Overall, our findings
highlight the advantages of token overlap in multilingual models and show that
substantial shared vocabulary remains a beneficial design choice for
multilingual tokenizers.

### [33] [When Long Helps Short: How Context Length in Supervised Fine-tuning Affects Behavior of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18762)
*Yingming Zheng,Hanqi Li,Kai Yu,Lu Chen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现，与长上下文预训练导致短上下文任务性能下降的普遍现象相反，长上下文监督微调（SFT）反而能提升短上下文任务性能。通过分析注意力机制和FFN组件，揭示了长上下文SFT促进上下文知识，而短上下文SFT偏好参数知识的偏见，并提出混合训练方法来解决这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着实际应用对长上下文窗口需求的增加，长上下文数据的持续预训练和SFT成为常见方法。虽然预训练中数据长度的影响已被广泛研究，但SFT中数据长度的影响尚不清楚，特别是对短上下文任务的影响。

Method: 系统研究SFT数据长度如何影响LLM在短上下文任务上的行为。首先解耦分析多头注意力（MHA）和前馈网络（FFN）两个关键组件，研究它们各自在长上下文SFT中的获益情况。进一步研究它们的交互作用，揭示知识偏好偏见。最后提出混合训练方法。

Result: 发现长上下文SFT能提升短上下文性能，这与长上下文预训练的效果相反。MHA和FFN都独立受益于长上下文SFT。研究揭示了知识偏好偏见：长上下文SFT促进上下文知识，短上下文SFT偏好参数知识。混合训练能减轻这种偏见。

Conclusion: 长上下文SFT对短上下文任务有积极影响，但单纯依赖长上下文SFT存在知识偏好偏见的问题。混合训练方法为LLM微调提供了可解释的指导，有助于平衡上下文知识和参数知识的使用。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across
natural language processing (NLP) tasks. As real-world applications
increasingly demand longer context windows, continued pretraining and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context data has become a common approach.
While the effects of data length in continued pretraining have been extensively
studied, their implications for SFT remain unclear. In this work, we
systematically investigate how SFT data length influences LLM behavior on
short-context tasks. Counterintuitively, we find that long-context SFT improves
short-context performance, contrary to the commonly observed degradation from
long-context pretraining. To uncover the underlying mechanisms of this
phenomenon, we first decouple and analyze two key components, Multi-Head
Attention (MHA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN), and show that both
independently benefit from long-context SFT. We further study their interaction
and reveal a knowledge preference bias: long-context SFT promotes contextual
knowledge, while short-context SFT favors parametric knowledge, making
exclusive reliance on long-context SFT suboptimal. Finally, we demonstrate that
hybrid training mitigates this bias, offering explainable guidance for
fine-tuning LLMs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出一种基于10-K财务文件的无监督方法，用于自动识别企业间风险关系，替代传统依赖专家判断的主观分析方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风险评估依赖专家判断和手动分析，存在主观性强、劳动密集、难以扩展的问题，需要系统化方法识别企业间风险关联

Method: 利用自然语言处理技术，基于10-K财务文件的时序和词汇模式进行无监督微调，开发领域特定的金融编码器，并引入定量风险关系评分

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在多个评估场景下均优于强基线模型

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效捕捉隐含和抽象的风险关联，为投资组合管理和投资策略提供透明、可解释的风险关系分析

Abstract: A multitude of interconnected risk events -- ranging from regulatory changes
to geopolitical tensions -- can trigger ripple effects across firms.
Identifying inter-firm risk relations is thus crucial for applications like
portfolio management and investment strategy. Traditionally, such assessments
rely on expert judgment and manual analysis, which are, however, subjective,
labor-intensive, and difficult to scale. To address this, we propose a
systematic method for extracting inter-firm risk relations using Form 10-K
filings -- authoritative, standardized financial documents -- as our data
source. Leveraging recent advances in natural language processing, our approach
captures implicit and abstract risk connections through unsupervised
fine-tuning based on chronological and lexical patterns in the filings. This
enables the development of a domain-specific financial encoder with a deeper
contextual understanding and introduces a quantitative risk relation score for
transparency, interpretable analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines across multiple evaluation settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs在安全关键的AEC领域中的鲁棒性和可靠性，因为该领域对模型的准确性要求极高。

Method: 创建包含23个任务的五级认知评估框架（知识记忆、理解、推理、计算和应用），构建4800个问题的数据集，并采用LLM-as-a-Judge方法进行评价。

Result: 评估九个LLMs显示，随着认知级别提升，性能明显下降，特别是在表格知识解释、复杂推理和计算、专业文档生成方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来在安全关键工程实践中可靠集成LLMs奠定了基础，指出了需要改进的方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), as a novel information technology, are seeing
increasing adoption in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC)
field. They have shown their potential to streamline processes throughout the
building lifecycle. However, the robustness and reliability of LLMs in such a
specialized and safety-critical domain remain to be evaluated. To address this
challenge, this paper establishes AECBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed
to quantify the strengths and limitations of current LLMs in the AEC domain.
The benchmark defines 23 representative tasks within a five-level
cognition-oriented evaluation framework encompassing Knowledge Memorization,
Understanding, Reasoning, Calculation, and Application. These tasks were
derived from authentic AEC practice, with scope ranging from codes retrieval to
specialized documents generation. Subsequently, a 4,800-question dataset
encompassing diverse formats, including open-ended questions, was crafted
primarily by engineers and validated through a two-round expert review.
Furthermore, an LLM-as-a-Judge approach was introduced to provide a scalable
and consistent methodology for evaluating complex, long-form responses
leveraging expert-derived rubrics. Through the evaluation of nine LLMs, a clear
performance decline across five cognitive levels was revealed. Despite
demonstrating proficiency in foundational tasks at the Knowledge Memorization
and Understanding levels, the models showed significant performance deficits,
particularly in interpreting knowledge from tables in building codes, executing
complex reasoning and calculation, and generating domain-specific documents.
Consequently, this study lays the groundwork for future research and
development aimed at the robust and reliable integration of LLMs into
safety-critical engineering practices.

<details>

Motivation: 随着微调成为改进大语言模型的主要方法，理解微调过程中的具体变化变得日益重要。传统基准测试往往无法解释为什么一个模型优于另一个。

Method: 采用模型差异分析这一机制解释性方法，使用crosscoders识别和分类两个模型之间的潜在表示差异。

Result: SimPO获得的潜在概念主要增强了安全机制（+32.8%）、多语言能力（+43.8%）和指令跟随（+151.7%），同时减少了模型自我引用（-44.1%）和幻觉管理（-68.5%）的强调。

Conclusion: 模型差异分析能够提供超越排行榜指标的细粒度洞察，将性能差距归因于具体的机制能力，为比较LLMs提供了透明和有针对性的框架。

Abstract: As fine-tuning becomes the dominant paradigm for improving large language
models (LLMs), understanding what changes during this process is increasingly
important. Traditional benchmarking often fails to explain why one model
outperforms another. In this work, we use model diffing, a mechanistic
interpretability approach, to analyze the specific capability differences
between Gemma-2-9b-it and a SimPO-enhanced variant. Using crosscoders, we
identify and categorize latent representations that differentiate the two
models. We find that SimPO acquired latent concepts predominantly enhance
safety mechanisms (+32.8%), multilingual capabilities (+43.8%), and
instruction-following (+151.7%), while its additional training also reduces
emphasis on model self-reference (-44.1%) and hallucination management
(-68.5%). Our analysis shows that model diffing can yield fine-grained insights
beyond leaderboard metrics, attributing performance gaps to concrete
mechanistic capabilities. This approach offers a transparent and targeted
framework for comparing LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的无监督提示方法通常采用单阶段推理管道和统一提示策略，无法充分利用LLM的推理和生成能力，特别是在处理不同长度文档时表现不佳。

Method: MAPEX引入多智能体协作，包含专家招募、候选提取、主题指导、知识增强和后处理模块，采用双路径策略：知识驱动提取用于短文本，主题引导提取用于长文本。

Result: 在6个基准数据集和3种不同LLM上的实验表明，MAPEX在F1@5指标上平均优于最先进的无监督方法2.44%，优于标准LLM基线4.01%。

Conclusion: MAPEX框架通过多智能体协作和动态适应策略，有效提升了LLM在关键词提取任务上的泛化能力和通用性。

Abstract: Keyphrase extraction is a fundamental task in natural language processing.
However, existing unsupervised prompt-based methods for Large Language Models
(LLMs) often rely on single-stage inference pipelines with uniform prompting,
regardless of document length or LLM backbone. Such one-size-fits-all designs
hinder the full exploitation of LLMs' reasoning and generation capabilities,
especially given the complexity of keyphrase extraction across diverse
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose MAPEX, the first framework
that introduces multi-agent collaboration into keyphrase extraction. MAPEX
coordinates LLM-based agents through modules for expert recruitment, candidate
extraction, topic guidance, knowledge augmentation, and post-processing. A
dual-path strategy dynamically adapts to document length: knowledge-driven
extraction for short texts and topic-guided extraction for long texts.
Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets across three different LLMs
demonstrate its strong generalization and universality, outperforming the
state-of-the-art unsupervised method by 2.44\% and standard LLM baselines by
4.01\% in F1@5 on average. Code is available at

Motivation: 随着开源大语言模型的快速发展，研究者希望验证小型开源模型是否能有效替代大型闭源模型，特别是在生物医学问答这一专业领域。

Method: 使用多种技术增强问答能力，包括基于嵌入距离检索相关片段、上下文学习、结构化输出，并对精确答案问题采用集成方法。

Result: 开源大语言模型与闭源模型表现相当，在某些情况下（特别是应用集成策略时）甚至超越了闭源模型。

Conclusion: 开源大语言模型在生物医学问答任务中具有与闭源模型相当的竞争力，证明了其在实际应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Open-weight versions of large language models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing,
with state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek-V3 now performing comparably to
proprietary LLMs. This progression raises the question of whether small
open-weight LLMs are capable of effectively replacing larger closed-source
models. We are particularly interested in the context of biomedical
question-answering, a domain we explored by participating in Task 13B Phase B
of the BioASQ challenge. In this work, we compare several open-weight models
against top-performing systems such as GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and
Claude 3.7 Sonnet. To enhance question answering capabilities, we use various
techniques including retrieving the most relevant snippets based on embedding
distance, in-context learning, and structured outputs. For certain submissions,
we utilize ensemble approaches to leverage the diverse outputs generated by
different models for exact-answer questions. Our results demonstrate that
open-weight LLMs are comparable to proprietary ones. In some instances,
open-weight LLMs even surpassed their closed counterparts, particularly when
ensembling strategies were applied. All code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文系统研究多层级特征集成在AI文本检测中的效果，发现尽管理论上多特征组合应提供互补信号，但实际仅带来微小性能提升(0.4-0.5%)，却产生显著计算开销(4.2倍)，表明现代神经语言模型可能已高效捕获大部分相关检测信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型技术的快速发展，研究者对多特征方法是否能显著超越单一神经模型在AI文本检测方面的性能产生兴趣。虽然直觉上语义、句法和统计特征的组合应提供互补信号，但这一假设尚未在现代LLM生成文本上得到严格验证。

Method: 实现MHFD(多层级特征检测)方法，通过自适应融合集成基于DeBERTa的语义分析、句法解析和统计概率特征。

Result: 在多基准数据集上的实验结果表明，MHFD方法在域内检测中达到89.7%的准确率，在跨域检测中保持84.2%的稳定性能，相比现有方法有0.4-2.6%的适度提升。

Conclusion: 多特征集成仅带来微小性能提升但计算成本高昂，表明现代神经语言模型可能已高效捕获大部分相关检测信号，多特征方法的实际价值有限。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language model technology, there is
growing interest in whether multi-feature approaches can significantly improve
AI text detection beyond what single neural models achieve. While intuition
suggests that combining semantic, syntactic, and statistical features should
provide complementary signals, this assumption has not been rigorously tested
with modern LLM-generated text. This paper provides a systematic empirical
investigation of multi-hierarchical feature integration for AI text detection,
specifically testing whether the computational overhead of combining multiple
feature types is justified by performance gains. We implement MHFD
(Multi-Hierarchical Feature Detection), integrating DeBERTa-based semantic
analysis, syntactic parsing, and statistical probability features through
adaptive fusion. Our investigation reveals important negative results: despite
theoretical expectations, multi-feature integration provides minimal benefits
(0.4-0.5% improvement) while incurring substantial computational costs (4.2x
overhead), suggesting that modern neural language models may already capture
most relevant detection signals efficiently. Experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate that the MHFD method achieves 89.7% accuracy in
in-domain detection and maintains 84.2% stable performance in cross-domain
detection, showing modest improvements of 0.4-2.6% over existing methods.

TL;DR: DivEye是一种新的AI生成文本检测框架，通过基于惊讶度的特征捕捉文本中不可预测性的波动，在检测性能、鲁棒性和可解释性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测器依赖词元级似然或不透明的黑盒分类器，难以应对高质量生成文本且缺乏可解释性。人类写作在词汇和结构不可预测性上比LLM输出表现出更丰富的变异性。

Method: DivEye使用基于惊讶度的可解释统计特征来捕捉文本中不可预测性的波动模式，利用人类写作与LLM输出在不可预测性变化上的差异。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DivEye比现有零样本检测器性能提升高达33.2%，与微调基线表现相当；对改写和对抗攻击具有鲁棒性，跨领域和模型泛化能力强；作为辅助信号可将现有检测器性能提升18.7%。

Conclusion: 节奏不可预测性是LLM检测中强大且未被充分探索的信号，DivEye不仅提供检测能力，还能解释为何文本被标记为AI生成。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated text is an increasing necessity to combat misuse of
LLMs in education, business compliance, journalism, and social media, where
synthetic fluency can mask misinformation or deception. While prior detectors
often rely on token-level likelihoods or opaque black-box classifiers, these
approaches struggle against high-quality generations and offer little
interpretability. In this work, we propose DivEye, a novel detection framework
that captures how unpredictability fluctuates across a text using
surprisal-based features. Motivated by the observation that human-authored text
exhibits richer variability in lexical and structural unpredictability than LLM
outputs, DivEye captures this signal through a set of interpretable statistical
features. Our method outperforms existing zero-shot detectors by up to 33.2%
and achieves competitive performance with fine-tuned baselines across multiple
benchmarks. DivEye is robust to paraphrasing and adversarial attacks,
generalizes well across domains and models, and improves the performance of
existing detectors by up to 18.7% when used as an auxiliary signal. Beyond
detection, DivEye provides interpretable insights into why a text is flagged,
pointing to rhythmic unpredictability as a powerful and underexplored signal
for LLM detection.

Result: JEDI在分布内达到竞争性精度，在分布外和对抗性设置中显著提高了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent works in Natural Language Inference (NLI) and related tasks, such as
automated fact-checking, employ atomic fact decomposition to enhance
interpretability and robustness. For this, existing methods rely on
resource-intensive generative large language models (LLMs) to perform
decomposition. We propose JEDI, an encoder-only architecture that jointly
performs extractive atomic fact decomposition and interpretable inference
without requiring generative models during inference. To facilitate training,
we produce a large corpus of synthetic rationales covering multiple NLI
benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that JEDI achieves competitive
accuracy in distribution and significantly improves robustness out of
distribution and in adversarial settings over models based solely on extractive
rationale supervision. Our findings show that interpretability and robust
generalization in NLI can be realized using encoder-only architectures and
synthetic rationales. Code and data available at https://jedi.nicpopovic.com

### [42] [DTW-Align: Bridging the Modality Gap in End-to-End Speech Translation with Dynamic Time Warping Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18987)
*Abderrahmane Issam,Yusuf Can Semerci,Jan Scholtes,Gerasimos Spanakis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于动态时间规整（DTW）的端到端语音翻译方法，用于解决语音和文本模态之间的表示差异问题，相比现有方法能产生更准确的对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端语音翻译中语音和文本模态之间存在表示差异，现有方法需要依赖对齐工具或使用最近邻相似性搜索，但这些方法要么不适用于所有语言，要么对齐效果不准确。

Method: 在训练过程中采用动态时间规整（DTW）算法来对齐语音和文本嵌入表示，无需依赖外部对齐工具。

Result: 该方法在端到端语音翻译任务中有效缩小了模态差异，相比之前工作产生更准确的对齐效果，在5/6的低资源语言方向上表现更优，且训练速度显著更快。

Conclusion: DTW方法为端到端语音翻译提供了一种有效且高效的模态对齐解决方案，特别是在低资源语言场景下表现突出。

Abstract: End-to-End Speech Translation (E2E-ST) is the task of translating source
speech directly into target text bypassing the intermediate transcription step.
The representation discrepancy between the speech and text modalities has
motivated research on what is known as bridging the modality gap.
State-of-the-art methods addressed this by aligning speech and text
representations on the word or token level. Unfortunately, this requires an
alignment tool that is not available for all languages. Although this issue has
been addressed by aligning speech and text embeddings using nearest-neighbor
similarity search, it does not lead to accurate alignments. In this work, we
adapt Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for aligning speech and text embeddings during
training. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in
bridging the modality gap in E2E-ST. Compared to previous work, our method
produces more accurate alignments and achieves comparable E2E-ST results while
being significantly faster. Furthermore, our method outperforms previous work
in low resource settings on 5 out of 6 language directions.

*Shaomu Tan,Ryosuke Mitani,Ritvik Choudhary,Toshiyuki Sekiya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了测试时缩放（TTS）在机器翻译中的应用，通过best-of-N框架在WMT24基准测试上验证了TTS对高资源语言翻译质量的提升效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模型参数缩放已成为提升NLP系统性能的主要策略，但带来巨大计算成本。测试时缩放（TTS）通过在推理时分配更多计算来生成多个候选并选择最佳结果，为机器翻译提供了一种替代方案。

Method: 采用简单实用的best-of-N框架，在WMT24基准上对6个高资源和1个低资源语言对进行实验，覆盖5种模型规模（3B-72B）和多种TTS计算预算（N最大1024）。

Result: 高资源语言中TTS能提升翻译质量；小模型配合大N可匹配或超越大模型N=1的性能；固定计算预算下大模型更高效，低资源情况下TTS可能因指标盲点而降低质量。

Conclusion: TTS为机器翻译提供了一种有效的性能提升途径，但在不同资源条件和计算预算下需要权衡考虑。

Abstract: Scaling model parameters has become the de facto strategy for improving NLP
systems, but it comes with substantial computational costs. Test-Time Scaling
(TTS) offers an alternative by allocating more computation at inference:
generating multiple candidates and selecting the best. While effective in tasks
such as mathematical reasoning, TTS has not been systematically explored for
machine translation (MT). In this paper, we present the first systematic study
of TTS for MT, investigating a simple but practical best-of-N framework on
WMT24 benchmarks. Our experiments cover six high-resource and one low-resource
language pairs, five model sizes (3B-72B), and various TTS compute budget (N up
to 1024). Our results show that a) For high-resource languages, TTS generally
improves translation quality according to multiple neural MT evaluation
metrics, and our human evaluation confirms these gains; b) Augmenting smaller
models with large $N$ can match or surpass larger models at $N{=}1$ with more
compute cost; c) Under fixed compute budgets, larger models are typically more
efficient, and TTS can degrade quality due to metric blind spots in
low-resource cases.

Motivation: 随着Transformer大语言模型的出现，计算语言学和自然语言处理领域发生了快速演变，需要跟踪意大利研究社区的研究趋势变化。

Method: 收集CLiC-it会议2014-2024年共10届的论文集，构建CLiC-it语料库，对论文元数据和内容进行全面分析。

Result: 提供了意大利和国际研究社区关于该领域新兴趋势和关键发展的宝贵见解。

Abstract: Over the past decade, Computational Linguistics (CL) and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) have evolved rapidly, especially with the advent of
Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). This shift has transformed
research goals and priorities, from Lexical and Semantic Resources to Language
Modelling and Multimodality. In this study, we track the research trends of the
Italian CL and NLP community through an analysis of the contributions to
CLiC-it, arguably the leading Italian conference in the field. We compile the
proceedings from the first 10 editions of the CLiC-it conference (from 2014 to
2024) into the CLiC-it Corpus, providing a comprehensive analysis of both its
metadata, including author provenance, gender, affiliations, and more, as well
as the content of the papers themselves, which address various topics. Our goal
is to provide the Italian and international research communities with valuable
insights into emerging trends and key developments over time, supporting
informed decisions and future directions in the field.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出Pathways of Thoughts (PoT)方法，通过建模LLM的推理为迭代决策过程，动态选择认知操作来生成多样化候选回答，然后根据用户偏好聚合重加权，实现个性化问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化问答对提升问答系统准确性和用户满意度至关重要，但目前面临从长、嘈杂、隐式上下文中推断偏好，以及生成正确、上下文适当且符合用户期望和背景知识的回答等挑战。

Method: PoT是一种推理阶段方法，无需任务特定微调，将LLM推理建模为迭代决策过程，动态选择推理、修订、个性化和澄清等认知操作，探索多种推理轨迹生成多样化候选回答，然后根据推断的用户偏好聚合重加权。

Result: 在LaMP-QA个性化问答基准测试中，PoT持续优于竞争基线，相对改进达13.1%。人工评估显示66%的情况下标注者偏好PoT输出，仅15%为平局。

Conclusion: PoT通过多样化推理路径的互补优势，有效提升个性化问答性能，为LLM的个性化应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalization is essential for adapting question answering (QA) systems to
user-specific information needs, thereby improving both accuracy and user
satisfaction. However, personalized QA remains relatively underexplored due to
challenges such as inferring preferences from long, noisy, and implicit
contexts, and generating responses that are simultaneously correct,
contextually appropriate, and aligned with user expectations and background
knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose Pathways of Thoughts (PoT),
an inference-stage method that applies to any large language model (LLM)
without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. The approach models the reasoning
of an LLM as an iterative decision process, where the model dynamically selects
among cognitive operations such as reasoning, revision, personalization, and
clarification. This enables exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories,
producing diverse candidate responses that capture different perspectives. PoT
then aggregates and reweights these candidates according to inferred user
preferences, yielding a final personalized response that benefits from the
complementary strengths of diverse reasoning paths. Experiments on the LaMP-QA
benchmark for personalized QA show that PoT consistently outperforms
competitive baselines, achieving up to a 13.1% relative improvement. Human
evaluation corroborates these results, with annotators preferring outputs from
PoT in 66% of cases and reporting ties in only 15% of cases.

### [46] [Are most sentences unique? An empirical examination of Chomskyan claims](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19108)
*Hiram Ring*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过分析不同体裁的语料库，检验了语言学中关于大多数语言表达都是独特的这一常见说法，发现虽然完全独特的句子在语料库中通常占多数，但这高度依赖于体裁，且重复句子在任何语料库中都不是无关紧要的部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检验语言学中关于大多数语言表达都是独特的这一常见说法（如Pinker和Chomsky的观点），利用大型语料库的可用性进行实证研究。

Method: 使用NLTK Python库解析不同体裁的语料库，统计每个语料库中完全相同的字符串匹配数量。

Result: 结果显示，虽然完全独特的句子在语料库中通常占多数，但这高度依赖于体裁，重复句子在任何语料库中都不是无关紧要的部分。

Conclusion: 语言表达的独特性并非绝对，而是受到体裁的显著影响，重复表达在语言使用中具有重要地位。

Abstract: A repeated claim in linguistics is that the majority of linguistic utterances
are unique. For example, Pinker (1994: 10), summarizing an argument by Noam
Chomsky, states that "virtually every sentence that a person utters or
understands is a brand-new combination of words, appearing for the first time
in the history of the universe." With the increased availability of large
corpora, this is a claim that can be empirically investigated. The current
paper addresses the question by using the NLTK Python library to parse corpora
of different genres, providing counts of exact string matches in each. Results
show that while completely unique sentences are often the majority of corpora,
this is highly constrained by genre, and that duplicate sentences are not an
insignificant part of any individual corpus.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了首个吉尔吉斯语命名实体识别数据集KyrgyzNER，包含1,499篇新闻文章、10,900个句子和39,075个实体提及，涵盖27个实体类别。评估了多种模型，发现多语言RoBERTa模型表现最佳，但所有模型在罕见实体类别上都存在困难。


<details>

Motivation: 为资源有限的吉尔吉斯语创建首个手动标注的命名实体识别数据集，填补该语言在NLP任务中的空白。

Method: 构建包含27个实体类别的标注数据集，评估了基于条件随机场的传统序列标注方法和基于多语言transformer的先进模型。

Result: 多语言RoBERTa模型在精确率和召回率之间取得了最佳平衡，但所有模型在处理罕见实体类别时都表现不佳。其他多语言模型也获得了可比的结果。

Conclusion: 多语言预训练模型在处理资源有限语言方面具有潜力，未来需要探索更细粒度的标注方案来改进吉尔吉斯语处理流程的评估。

Abstract: We introduce KyrgyzNER, the first manually annotated named entity recognition
dataset for the Kyrgyz language. Comprising 1,499 news articles from the 24.KG
news portal, the dataset contains 10,900 sentences and 39,075 entity mentions
across 27 named entity classes. We show our annotation scheme, discuss the
challenges encountered in the annotation process, and present the descriptive
statistics. We also evaluate several named entity recognition models, including
traditional sequence labeling approaches based on conditional random fields and
state-of-the-art multilingual transformer-based models fine-tuned on our
dataset. While all models show difficulties with rare entity categories, models
such as the multilingual RoBERTa variant pretrained on a large corpus across
many languages achieve a promising balance between precision and recall. These
findings emphasize both the challenges and opportunities of using multilingual
pretrained models for processing languages with limited resources. Although the
multilingual RoBERTa model performed best, other multilingual models yielded
comparable results. This suggests that future work exploring more granular
annotation schemes may offer deeper insights for Kyrgyz language processing
pipelines evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的上下文感知层次化分类法生成框架，结合LLM引导的多方面编码和动态聚类，显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献快速增长需要高效组织方法，现有分类法构建方法缺乏连贯性和粒度

Method: 利用LLM识别论文关键方面并生成方面特定摘要，然后进行编码和聚类形成层次结构

Result: 在包含11.6k论文的156个专家构建分类法基准上，实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 该方法在分类法连贯性、粒度和可解释性方面显著优于现有方法

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific literature demands efficient methods to
organize and synthesize research findings. Existing taxonomy construction
methods, leveraging unsupervised clustering or direct prompting of large
language models (LLMs), often lack coherence and granularity. We propose a
novel context-aware hierarchical taxonomy generation framework that integrates
LLM-guided multi-aspect encoding with dynamic clustering. Our method leverages
LLMs to identify key aspects of each paper (e.g., methodology, dataset,
evaluation) and generates aspect-specific paper summaries, which are then
encoded and clustered along each aspect to form a coherent hierarchy. In
addition, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark of 156 expert-crafted
taxonomies encompassing 11.6k papers, providing the first naturally annotated
dataset for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms prior approaches, achieving state-of-the-art
performance in taxonomy coherence, granularity, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为'anecdoctoring'的新型红队测试方法，用于生成跨语言和文化的对抗性提示，以评估生成式AI在虚假信息传播方面的风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI的全球采用需要能够适应不同语言和文化的红队评估，但现有的红队数据集通常以美国和英语为中心，存在明显的局限性。

Method: 从三个语言（英语、西班牙语和印地语）和两个地区（美国和印度）的事实核查网站收集虚假信息声明，将其聚类为更广泛的叙事，并使用知识图谱增强攻击者LLM。

Result: 该方法相比少样本提示具有更高的攻击成功率，并提供了可解释性优势。

Conclusion: 结果强调了需要基于真实世界对抗性滥用的、能够全球扩展的虚假信息缓解措施。

Abstract: Disinformation is among the top risks of generative artificial intelligence
(AI) misuse. Global adoption of generative AI necessitates red-teaming
evaluations (i.e., systematic adversarial probing) that are robust across
diverse languages and cultures, but red-teaming datasets are commonly US- and
English-centric. To address this gap, we propose "anecdoctoring", a novel
red-teaming approach that automatically generates adversarial prompts across
languages and cultures. We collect misinformation claims from fact-checking
websites in three languages (English, Spanish, and Hindi) and two geographies
(US and India). We then cluster individual claims into broader narratives and
characterize the resulting clusters with knowledge graphs, with which we
augment an attacker LLM. Our method produces higher attack success rates and
offers interpretability benefits relative to few-shot prompting. Results
underscore the need for disinformation mitigations that scale globally and are
grounded in real-world adversarial misuse.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AI "slop"（低质量AI生成文本）的分类框架和评估维度，通过专家访谈建立了可解释的评估体系，发现二元判断具有一定主观性但能与潜在维度相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏对AI生成低质量文本（"slop"）的统一定义和测量方法，需要建立系统化的评估框架

Method: 通过NLP、写作和哲学领域专家的访谈建立分类体系，进行文本片段级标注，分析二元判断与潜在维度的相关性

Result: 发现二元"slop"判断具有主观性，但与连贯性、相关性等潜在维度相关；提出的框架可用于AI文本的质量评估和偏好任务

Conclusion: 该框架为AI生成文本的质量评估提供了新的视角，有助于理解影响质量判断的语言和风格因素

Abstract: AI "slop" is an increasingly popular term used to describe low-quality
AI-generated text, but there is currently no agreed upon definition of this
term nor a means to measure its occurrence. In this work, we develop a taxonomy
of "slop" through interviews with experts in NLP, writing, and philosophy, and
propose a set of interpretable dimensions for its assessment in text. Through
span-level annotation, we find that binary "slop" judgments are (somewhat)
subjective, but such determinations nonetheless correlate with latent
dimensions such as coherence and relevance. Our framework can be used to
evaluate AI-generated text in both detection and binary preference tasks,
potentially offering new insights into the linguistic and stylistic factors
that contribute to quality judgments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过强化学习训练连续思维链（CoT）的可扩展方法，使用软标记和输入嵌入噪声实现高效训练，在数学推理任务上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离散标记的思维链表达能力有限，连续标记理论上具有更强的表达能力，但实际应用受限于训练困难。本文旨在解决连续CoT的训练难题。

Method: 使用强化学习训练连续CoT，采用软标记（标记混合）和输入嵌入噪声进行探索，避免了从参考离散CoT进行蒸馏的高计算成本。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上的数学推理基准测试中，连续CoT训练在pass@1上匹配离散CoT，在pass@32上超越离散CoT，显示出更大的CoT多样性。最佳方案是训练使用连续CoT，推理时使用离散标记。

Conclusion: 连续CoT强化学习训练方法不仅提高了推理性能，还更好地保留了基础模型在域外任务上的预测能力，为模型提供了更温和的调整。

Abstract: The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the
intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a
superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results
have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and
can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of
continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous
works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained
discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth
discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few
tokens.
  This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs
via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete
CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input
embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal,
enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning
benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs
match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing
greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario
is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference,
meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show
continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model
on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.

TL;DR: OPRL是一种用于智能体强化学习的通用信用分配策略，通过交替优化隐式过程奖励模型和策略，将轨迹偏好转化为隐式步骤奖励，解决了稀疏和不可验证奖励环境中的时间信用分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型作为自主智能体在交互环境中进行强化学习时，稀疏且有时不可验证的奖励使得时间信用分配极具挑战性。现有方法存在标注偏差、奖励攻击、高方差等问题。

Method: OPRL交替优化隐式过程奖励模型和智能体策略，通过基于轨迹的DPO目标将轨迹偏好转化为隐式步骤奖励，然后结合结果奖励计算步骤级优势用于策略更新，形成自我强化循环。

Result: 在WebShop、VisualSokoban和SOTOPIA三个基准测试中，OPRL表现优于前沿LLM和强RL基线，实现了最先进的结果，具有更高的样本效率和更低的训练方差。

Conclusion: OPRL通过理论保证和实证验证，证明了其在真实世界智能体学习中的潜力，能够实现高效探索和稳定训练。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement
learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in
interactive environments.
  However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit
assignment extremely challenging.
  Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but
suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly
fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare.
  We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general
credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with
standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or
explicit step labels.
  In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with
the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step
rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective.
  These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are
combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update,
creating a self-reinforcing loop.
  Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent
with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards,
providing bounded gradients to stabilize training.
  Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including
WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with
unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA.
  Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL
baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher
sample-efficiency and lower variance during training.
  Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using
fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world
scenarios.

*Zheyuan Liu,Zhangchen Xu,Guangyao Dou,Xiangchi Yuan,Zhaoxuan Tan,Radha Poovendran,Meng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SafeCoDe是一个轻量级、模型无关的解码框架，通过对比解码和全局感知令牌调制来提升多模态大语言模型在安全决策中的上下文感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在安全对齐方面存在过度敏感（错误拒绝良性查询）和敏感不足（漏检视觉风险）的问题，需要一种能够平衡两者并做出上下文感知安全决策的方法。

Method: SafeCoDe采用两阶段方法：1）对比解码机制，通过对比真实图像和高斯噪声图像来突出对视觉上下文敏感的令牌；2）全局感知令牌调制策略，将场景级推理与令牌级调整相结合，根据预测的安全判断自适应调整拒绝行为。

Result: 在多种MLLM架构和安全基准测试中，SafeCoDe在保持模型帮助性的同时，持续改进了上下文敏感的拒绝行为，在敏感不足、过度敏感和一般安全评估方面都表现出色。

Conclusion: SafeCoDe提供了一个有效的解决方案，能够显著提升多模态大语言模型在现实应用中的安全决策能力，解决了现有方法在安全对齐方面的局限性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in
real-world applications, yet their ability to make context-aware safety
decisions remains limited. Existing methods often fail to balance
oversensitivity (unjustified refusals of benign queries) and undersensitivity
(missed detection of visually grounded risks), leaving a persistent gap in
safety alignment. To address this issue, we introduce Safety-aware Contrastive
Decoding (SafeCoDe), a lightweight and model-agnostic decoding framework that
dynamically adjusts token generation based on multimodal context. SafeCoDe
operates in two stages: (1) a contrastive decoding mechanism that highlights
tokens sensitive to visual context by contrasting real and Gaussian-noised
images, and (2) a global-aware token modulation strategy that integrates
scene-level reasoning with token-level adjustment to adapt refusals according
to the predicted safety verdict. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLM
architectures and safety benchmarks, covering undersensitivity,
oversensitivity, and general safety evaluations, show that SafeCoDe
consistently improves context-sensitive refusal behaviors while preserving
model helpfulness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于注意力的模型已成为临床笔记自然语言处理的主要方法，但需要比较不同预训练模型在电子健康记录信息提取任务上的实际表现，以确定最适合临床NLP应用的模型。

Method: 使用哈佛医学院2022年n2c2挑战赛Track 1的任务和CMED数据集，对Bert Base、BioBert、Bio+Clinical Bert变体、RoBerta和Clinical Longformer进行微调，执行药物提取、医疗事件检测和多维药物事件上下文分类任务。

Result: 临床数据预训练的模型在检测药物和医疗事件方面更有效，而Bert Base在分类药物相关事件上下文方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 不同预训练模型在临床NLP任务中各有优势，临床数据预训练模型适合事件检测，通用领域预训练模型在上下文分类方面表现更好，需要根据具体任务需求选择合适的模型。

Abstract: Attention-based models have become the leading approach in modeling medical
language for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in clinical notes. These models
outperform traditional techniques by effectively capturing contextual rep-
resentations of language. In this research a comparative analysis is done
amongst pre- trained attention based models namely Bert Base, BioBert, two
variations of Bio+Clinical Bert, RoBerta, and Clinical Long- former on task
related to Electronic Health Record (EHR) information extraction. The tasks
from Track 1 of Harvard Medical School's 2022 National Clinical NLP Challenges
(n2c2) are considered for this comparison, with the Contextualized Medication
Event Dataset (CMED) given for these task. CMED is a dataset of unstructured
EHRs and annotated notes that contain task relevant information about the EHRs.
The goal of the challenge is to develop effective solutions for extracting
contextual information related to patient medication events from EHRs using
data driven methods. Each pre-trained model is fine-tuned and applied on CMED
to perform medication extraction, medical event detection, and
multi-dimensional medication event context classification. Pro- cessing methods
are also detailed for breaking down EHRs for compatibility with the applied
models. Performance analysis has been carried out using a script based on
constructing medical terms from the evaluation portion of CMED with metrics
including recall, precision, and F1-Score. The results demonstrate that models
pre-trained on clinical data are more effective in detecting medication and
medication events, but Bert Base, pre- trained on general domain data showed to
be the most effective for classifying the context of events related to
medications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软压缩方法将上下文作为单一单元压缩，导致二次压缩复杂度且无法在重叠上下文的查询间重用计算，限制了实际应用。

Method: 将上下文分割成独立片段分别压缩，而非整体处理。这种设计实现了线性压缩复杂度、训练模型可扩展到更长序列、压缩片段可缓存重用。

Result: 在2倍压缩率下，CompLLM在高上下文长度时将首令牌生成时间加速4倍，KV缓存减少50%，性能与未压缩上下文相当甚至在某些长序列上更优。

Conclusion: CompLLM通过分段独立压缩策略，有效解决了LLM处理长上下文的计算效率问题，具有显著的实用价值。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant computational challenges when
processing long contexts due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention.
While soft context compression methods, which map input text to smaller latent
representations, have shown promise, their real-world adoption is limited.
Existing techniques typically compress the context as a single unit, which
leads to quadratic compression complexity and an inability to reuse
computations across queries with overlapping contexts. In this work, we
introduce CompLLM, a soft compression technique designed for practical
deployment. Instead of processing the context holistically, CompLLM divides it
into segments and compresses each one independently. This simple design choice
yields three critical properties: efficiency, as the compression step scales
linearly with the context length; scalability, enabling models trained on short
sequences (e.g., 1k tokens) to generalize to contexts of 100k tokens; and
reusability, allowing compressed segments to be cached and reused across
different queries. Our experiments show that with a 2x compression rate, at
high context lengths CompLLM speeds up Time To First Token (TTFT) by up to 4x
and reduces the KV cache size by 50%. Furthermore, CompLLM achieves performance
comparable to that obtained with the uncompressed context, and even surpasses
it on very long sequences, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical
utility.

TL;DR: RLPT是一种新的训练时扩展范式，通过强化学习让LLM从预训练数据中自主学习，无需人工标注奖励信号，在多个基准测试中显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算资源指数级增长与高质量文本数据有限增长之间的差距限制了传统LLM扩展方法，需要新的训练范式来突破这一瓶颈。

Method: 采用下一段推理目标，让策略基于前文准确预测后续文本段来获得奖励信号，使强化学习能够在预训练数据上规模化应用。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B-Base模型上，RLPT在MMLU、MMLU-Pro、GPQA-Diamond、KOR-Bench、AIME24和AIME25等基准测试中分别获得3.0、5.1、8.1、6.0、6.6和5.3的绝对提升。

Conclusion: RLPT展示了良好的扩展行为，为LLM扩展提供了新方向，能够扩展推理边界并增强RLVR性能。

Abstract: The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational
resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains
conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address
this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data
(RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast
to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning,
RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to
learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement
learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from
human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR)
rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this
dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data.
Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the
policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the
preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training
data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader
contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive
experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across
multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied
to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$,
$6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and
AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling
behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In
addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries
of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从大型语言模型中提取概念空间的方法，通过使用原型描述来编码特征，并通过对齐原型嵌入与概念空间维度来改进策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 概念空间使用认知上有意义的维度表示实体和概念，在认知科学中广泛应用，并有望成为可解释AI的基石。然而，目前缺乏从LLMs中提取概念空间的实用方法。

Method: 提出一种策略：通过嵌入相应原型的描述来编码特征（如甜度），并微调LLM以使原型嵌入与对应的概念空间维度对齐。

Result: 实证分析发现该方法非常有效。

Conclusion: 该方法为从LLMs中提取概念空间提供了一种实用的解决方案，有助于推动可解释AI的发展。

Abstract: Conceptual spaces represent entities and concepts using cognitively
meaningful dimensions, typically referring to perceptual features. Such
representations are widely used in cognitive science and have the potential to
serve as a cornerstone for explainable AI. Unfortunately, they have proven
notoriously difficult to learn, although recent LLMs appear to capture the
required perceptual features to a remarkable extent. Nonetheless, practical
methods for extracting the corresponding conceptual spaces are currently still
lacking. While various methods exist for extracting embeddings from LLMs,
extracting conceptual spaces also requires us to encode the underlying
features. In this paper, we propose a strategy in which features (e.g.
sweetness) are encoded by embedding the description of a corresponding
prototype (e.g. a very sweet food). To improve this strategy, we fine-tune the
LLM to align the prototype embeddings with the corresponding conceptual space
dimensions. Our empirical analysis finds this approach to be highly effective.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) for low-resource languages like Slovak is
hindered by the scarcity of training data. To address this, we introduce
SloPalSpeech, a new, large-scale Slovak ASR dataset containing 2,806 hours of
speech from parliamentary proceedings. We developed a robust processing

large-v3-turbo), achieving significant Word Error Rate (WER) reductions on
standard Slovak benchmarks like Common Voice and FLEURS. For instance, the
fine-tuned Whisper-small model's WER dropped by up to 70\%, approaching the
baseline performance of the much larger Whisper-large-v3 model. To foster

Abstract: Intent classification models have made a lot of progress in recent years.
However, previous studies primarily focus on high-resource languages datasets,
which results in a gap for low-resource languages and for regions with a high
rate of illiterate people where languages are more spoken than read or written.
This is the case in Senegal, for example, where Wolof is spoken by around 90\%
of the population, with an illiteracy rate of 42\% for the country. Wolof is
actually spoken by more than 10 million people in West African region. To
tackle such limitations, we release a Wolof Intent Classification Dataset
(WolBanking77), for academic research in intent classification. WolBanking77
currently contains 9,791 text sentences in the banking domain and more than 4
hours of spoken sentences. Experiments on various baselines are conducted in
this work, including text and voice state-of-the-art models. The results are
very promising on this current dataset. This paper also provides detailed
analyses of the contents of the data. We report baseline f1-score and word
error rate metrics respectively on NLP and ASR models trained on WolBanking77
dataset and also comparisons between models. We plan to share and conduct
dataset maintenance, updates and to release open-source code.

Abstract: We introduce DRISHTIKON, a first-of-its-kind multimodal and multilingual
benchmark centered exclusively on Indian culture, designed to evaluate the
cultural understanding of generative AI systems. Unlike existing benchmarks
with a generic or global scope, DRISHTIKON offers deep, fine-grained coverage
across India's diverse regions, spanning 15 languages, covering all states and
union territories, and incorporating over 64,000 aligned text-image pairs. The

of vision-language models (VLMs), including open-source small and large models,
proprietary systems, reasoning-specialized VLMs, and Indic-focused models,
across zero-shot and chain-of-thought settings. Our results expose key
limitations in current models' ability to reason over culturally grounded,

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related
morbidity and mortality worldwide, with gastrointestinal (GI) polyps serving as
critical precursors according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Early and
accurate segmentation of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for reducing
CRC progression, yet manual delineation is labor-intensive and prone to
observer variability. Deep learning methods have demonstrated strong potential
for automated polyp analysis, but their limited interpretability remains a
barrier to clinical adoption. In this study, we present PolypSeg-GradCAM, an
explainable deep learning framework that integrates the U-Net architecture with
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) for transparent polyp
segmentation. The model was trained and evaluated on the Kvasir-SEG dataset of
1000 annotated endoscopic images. Experimental results demonstrate robust
segmentation performance, achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of
0.9257 on the test set and consistently high Dice coefficients (F-score > 0.96)
on training and validation sets. Grad-CAM visualizations further confirmed that
predictions were guided by clinically relevant regions, enhancing transparency
and trust in the model's decisions. By coupling high segmentation accuracy with
interpretability, PolypSeg-GradCAM represents a step toward reliable,
trustworthy AI-assisted colonoscopy and improved early colorectal cancer
prevention.

Conclusion: SIM是一种简单有效的正则化框架，能增强表示学习，提高模型泛化能力，且具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Regularization is essential in deep learning to enhance generalization and
mitigate overfitting. However, conventional techniques often rely on
heuristics, making them less reliable or effective across diverse settings. We
propose Self Identity Mapping (SIM), a simple yet effective, data-intrinsic
regularization framework that leverages an inverse mapping mechanism to enhance
representation learning. By reconstructing the input from its transformed
output, SIM reduces information loss during forward propagation and facilitates
smoother gradient flow. To address computational inefficiencies, We instantiate
SIM as $ \rho\text{SIM} $ by incorporating patch-level feature sampling and
projection-based method to reconstruct latent features, effectively lowering
complexity. As a model-agnostic, task-agnostic regularizer, SIM can be
seamlessly integrated as a plug-and-play module, making it applicable to
different network architectures and tasks.
  We extensively evaluate $\rho\text{SIM}$ across three tasks: image
classification, few-shot prompt learning, and domain generalization.
Experimental results show consistent improvements over baseline methods,
highlighting $\rho\text{SIM}$'s ability to enhance representation learning
across various tasks. We also demonstrate that $\rho\text{SIM}$ is orthogonal
to existing regularization methods, boosting their effectiveness. Moreover, our
results confirm that $\rho\text{SIM}$ effectively preserves semantic
information and enhances performance in dense-to-dense tasks, such as semantic
segmentation and image translation, as well as in non-visual domains including
audio classification and time series anomaly detection. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/XiudingCai/SIM-pytorch.

Abstract: Monitoring ground displacement is crucial for urban infrastructure stability
and mitigating geological hazards. However, forecasting future deformation from
sparse Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time-series data
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a novel deep learning
framework that transforms these sparse point measurements into a dense
spatio-temporal tensor. This methodological shift allows, for the first time,
the direct application of advanced computer vision architectures to this
forecasting problem. We design and implement a hybrid Convolutional Neural
Network and Long-Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) model, specifically engineered to
simultaneously learn spatial patterns and temporal dependencies from the
generated data tensor. The model's performance is benchmarked against powerful
machine learning baselines, Light Gradient Boosting Machine and LASSO
regression, using Sentinel-1 data from eastern Ireland. Results demonstrate
that the proposed architecture provides significantly more accurate and
spatially coherent forecasts, establishing a new performance benchmark for this
task. Furthermore, an interpretability analysis reveals that baseline models
often default to simplistic persistence patterns, highlighting the necessity of
our integrated spatio-temporal approach to capture the complex dynamics of
ground deformation. Our findings confirm the efficacy and potential of
spatio-temporal deep learning for high-resolution deformation forecasting.

Method: 通过生成包含大量关于单个概念问题且具有广泛语言变体的数据集，系统性地评估模型对基础概念的理解能力。

Result: 实验发现当代模型在物体识别方面表现良好，但在理解位置信息和处理有额外约束的问题时存在困难。MobileVLM-V2模型显示出显著答案不一致性，其他模型存在肯定答案偏见，且在几何形状和位置信息问题上表现不佳。

Conclusion: Scrapbook框架为生成多样化数据集提供了有价值工具，可用于系统评估和提升AI模型性能，特别是在基础概念理解方面。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the Scrapbook framework, a novel methodology
designed to generate extensive datasets for probing the learned concepts of
artificial intelligence (AI) models. The framework focuses on fundamental
concepts such as object recognition, absolute and relative positions, and
attribute identification. By generating datasets with a large number of
questions about individual concepts and a wide linguistic variation, the
Scrapbook framework aims to validate the model's understanding of these basic
elements before tackling more complex tasks. Our experimental findings reveal
that, while contemporary models demonstrate proficiency in recognizing and
enumerating objects, they encounter challenges in comprehending positional
information and addressing inquiries with additional constraints. Specifically,
the MobileVLM-V2 model showed significant answer disagreements and plausible
wrong answers, while other models exhibited a bias toward affirmative answers
and struggled with questions involving geometric shapes and positional
information, indicating areas for improvement in understanding and consistency.
The proposed framework offers a valuable instrument for generating diverse and
comprehensive datasets, which can be utilized to systematically assess and
enhance the performance of AI models.

150 image pairs through the describe-then-generate pipeline and applied
existing metrics (LPIPS, SSIM, and color distance) to measure information
preservation across perceptual, structural, and chromatic dimensions. Our
evaluation reveals that 99.3% of samples exhibit substantial perceptual
degradation and 91.5% demonstrate significant structural information loss,
providing empirical evidence that the describe-then-generate bottleneck
represents a measurable and consistent limitation in contemporary multimodal
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AI驱动的工作流，利用高分辨率卫星影像自动推断屋顶属性，为小岛屿发展中国家提供建筑结构信息，支持灾害风险评估和城市韧性规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小岛屿发展中国家缺乏详细的建筑结构信息，这限制了灾害风险评估和城市韧性规划的能力。特别是在加勒比等气候脆弱地区，这种数据缺口更为明显。

Method: 比较地理空间基础模型结合浅层分类器与微调深度学习模型在屋顶分类中的效果，并评估加入邻国训练数据对模型性能的影响。

Result: 最佳模型在屋顶坡度和屋顶材料分类上分别达到0.88和0.83的F1分数。

Conclusion: 结合本地能力建设，该研究为小岛屿发展中国家提供了利用AI和地球观测数据的新能力，支持更高效、基于证据的城市治理。

Abstract: Detailed structural building information is used to estimate potential damage
from hazard events like cyclones, floods, and landslides, making them critical
for urban resilience planning and disaster risk reduction. However, such
information is often unavailable in many small island developing states (SIDS)
in climate-vulnerable regions like the Caribbean. To address this data gap, we
present an AI-driven workflow to automatically infer rooftop attributes from
high-resolution satellite imagery, with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as our
case study. Here, we compare the utility of geospatial foundation models
combined with shallow classifiers against fine-tuned deep learning models for
rooftop classification. Furthermore, we assess the impact of incorporating
additional training data from neighboring SIDS to improve model performance.
Our best models achieve F1 scores of 0.88 and 0.83 for roof pitch and roof
material classification, respectively. Combined with local capacity building,
our work aims to provide SIDS with novel capabilities to harness AI and Earth
Observation (EO) data to enable more efficient, evidence-based urban
governance.

TL;DR: 本文提出VLA-LPAF轻量模块，通过2D数据增强VLA模型的视角适应性，在多个基准测试中显著提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型因视觉观察视角差异导致的泛化能力受限问题，不同环境中相机视角和数量的变化造成视觉特征显著差异。

Method: 提出VLA-LPAF模块，使用单视角图像进行微调，在潜在空间融合多视角观察，有效桥接视角不一致带来的差距。

Result: 在CALVIN上平均提升8%任务成功率，LIBERO上提升15%，定制仿真基准上提升30%，并在真实世界任务中展示视角自适应特性。

Conclusion: VLA-LPAF能有效提升VLA模型的视角适应性和泛化能力，仅需2D数据即可实现多视角融合。

Abstract: The Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models can follow text instructions
according to visual observations of the surrounding environment. This ability
to map multimodal inputs to actions is derived from the training of the VLA
model on extensive standard demonstrations. These visual observations captured
by third-personal global and in-wrist local cameras are inevitably varied in
number and perspective across different environments, resulting in significant
differences in the visual features. This perspective heterogeneity constrains
the generality of VLA models. In light of this, we first propose the
lightweight module VLA-LPAF to foster the perspective adaptivity of VLA models
using only 2D data. VLA-LPAF is finetuned using images from a single view and
fuses other multiview observations in the latent space, which effectively and
efficiently bridge the gap caused by perspective inconsistency. We instantiate
our VLA-LPAF framework with the VLA model RoboFlamingo to construct
RoboFlamingo-LPAF. Experiments show that RoboFlamingo-LPAF averagely achieves
around 8% task success rate improvement on CALVIN, 15% on LIBERO, and 30% on a
customized simulation benchmark. We also demonstrate the developed viewadaptive
characteristics of the proposed RoboFlamingo-LPAF through real-world tasks.

Abstract: Event cameras provide high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low
latency, offering significant advantages over conventional frame-based cameras.
In this work, we introduce an uncertainty-aware refinement network called URNet
for event-based stereo depth estimation. Our approach features a local-global
refinement module that effectively captures fine-grained local details and
long-range global context. Additionally, we introduce a Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence-based uncertainty modeling method to enhance prediction reliability.
Extensive experiments on the DSEC dataset demonstrate that URNet consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations.

Method: Visionerves采用两阶段流程：(A)使用深度学习模型自动分割解剖结构，(B)通过符号空间推理进行纤维束成像和神经识别。该方法基于模糊空间关系编码解剖知识，无需手动选择ROI。

Result: 在10名子宫内膜异位症患者的腰骶神经丛应用中，Visionerves相比标准纤维束成像有显著改进，Dice分数提高达25%，空间误差减少至小于5毫米。

Conclusion: 这种自动且可重复的方法能够进行详细的神经分析，为非侵入性诊断子宫内膜异位症相关神经病变以及其他涉及神经的疾病铺平了道路。

Abstract: Endometriosis often leads to chronic pelvic pain and possible nerve
involvement, yet imaging the peripheral nerves remains a challenge. We
introduce Visionerves, a novel hybrid AI framework for peripheral nervous
system recognition from multi-gradient DWI and morphological MRI data. Unlike
conventional tractography, Visionerves encodes anatomical knowledge through
fuzzy spatial relationships, removing the need for selection of manual ROIs.
The pipeline comprises two phases: (A) automatic segmentation of anatomical
structures using a deep learning model, and (B) tractography and nerve
recognition by symbolic spatial reasoning. Applied to the lumbosacral plexus in
10 women with (confirmed or suspected) endometriosis, Visionerves demonstrated
substantial improvements over standard tractography, with Dice score
improvements of up to 25% and spatial errors reduced to less than 5 mm. This
automatic and reproducible approach enables detailed nerve analysis and paves
the way for non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis-related neuropathy, as well
as other conditions with nerve involvement.

Motivation: 现有数据集主要来自发达国家，缺乏新兴经济体驾驶行为的多样性表示，且驾驶员面部记录侵犯隐私。巴基斯坦等国家存在道路条件复杂、交通流混合和驾驶纪律多变等问题，需要可靠的不安全驾驶行为检测来改善道路安全。

Method: 使用定制Android应用收集高频加速度计、陀螺仪和GPS数据，并与连续视频同步，记录三种目标驾驶行为（正常、攻击性和危险）在多种道路类型上。数据集分为原始层、处理层和语义层。

Conclusion: V-SenseDrive通过代表巴基斯坦真实世界驾驶情况，为驾驶员行为分类、交通安全分析和ADAS开发提供了重要数据资源。

Abstract: Road traffic accidents remain a major public health challenge, particularly
in countries with heterogeneous road conditions, mixed traffic flow, and
variable driving discipline, such as Pakistan. Reliable detection of unsafe
driving behaviours is a prerequisite for improving road safety, enabling
advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and supporting data driven decisions
in insurance and fleet management. Most of existing datasets originate from the
developed countries with limited representation of the behavioural diversity
observed in emerging economies and the driver's face recording voilates the
privacy preservation. We present V-SenseDrive, the first privacy-preserving
multimodal driver behaviour dataset collected entirely within the Pakistani
driving environment. V-SenseDrive combines smartphone based inertial and GPS
sensor data with synchronized road facing video to record three target driving
behaviours (normal, aggressive, and risky) on multiple types of roads,
including urban arterials, secondary roads, and motorways. Data was gathered
using a custom Android application designed to capture high frequency
accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS streams alongside continuous video, with all
sources precisely time aligned to enable multimodal analysis. The focus of this
work is on the data acquisition process, covering participant selection,
driving scenarios, environmental considerations, and sensor video
synchronization techniques. The dataset is structured into raw, processed, and
semantic layers, ensuring adaptability for future research in driver behaviour
classification, traffic safety analysis, and ADAS development. By representing
real world driving in Pakistan, V-SenseDrive fills a critical gap in the global
landscape of driver behaviour datasets and lays the groundwork for context
aware intelligent transportation solutions.

Result: 在多个真实世界去雾基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: HazeFlow通过ODE框架和真实雾霾模拟方法，有效提升了真实世界图像去雾的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Dehazing involves removing haze or fog from images to restore clarity and
improve visibility by estimating atmospheric scattering effects. While deep
learning methods show promise, the lack of paired real-world training data and
the resulting domain gap hinder generalization to real-world scenarios. In this
context, physics-grounded learning becomes crucial; however, traditional
methods based on the Atmospheric Scattering Model (ASM) often fall short in
handling real-world complexities and diverse haze patterns. To solve this
problem, we propose HazeFlow, a novel ODE-based framework that reformulates ASM
as an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Inspired by Rectified Flow (RF),
HazeFlow learns an optimal ODE trajectory to map hazy images to clean ones,
enhancing real-world dehazing performance with only a single inference step.
Additionally, we introduce a non-homogeneous haze generation method using
Markov Chain Brownian Motion (MCBM) to address the scarcity of paired
real-world data. By simulating realistic haze patterns through MCBM, we enhance
the adaptability of HazeFlow to diverse real-world scenarios. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that HazeFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance
across various real-world dehazing benchmark datasets.

Abstract: As medical diagnoses increasingly leverage multimodal data, machine learning
models are expected to effectively fuse heterogeneous information while
remaining robust to missing modalities. In this work, we propose a novel
multimodal learning framework that integrates enhanced modalities dropout and
contrastive learning to address real-world limitations such as modality
imbalance and missingness. Our approach introduces learnable modality tokens
for improving missingness-aware fusion of modalities and augments conventional
unimodal contrastive objectives with fused multimodal representations. We
validate our framework on large-scale clinical datasets for disease detection
and prediction tasks, encompassing both visual and tabular modalities.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, particularly in challenging and practical scenarios where only a
single modality is available. Furthermore, we show its adaptability through
successful integration with a recent CT foundation model. Our findings
highlight the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our approach
for multimodal learning, offering a scalable, low-cost solution with
significant potential for real-world clinical applications. The code is

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了9种分割架构在肺栓塞分割任务上的性能，发现3D U-Net ResNet表现最佳，CNN模型优于ViT，分类预训练反而降低分割性能，远端栓塞分割仍具挑战性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺栓塞是危及生命的疾病，准确分割对诊断和治疗至关重要。目前缺乏对不同分割架构在PE任务上的系统性比较研究。

Method: 使用490个CTPA扫描的内部数据集，在统一测试框架下评估9种CNN和ViT架构，比较预训练和随机初始化的性能差异。

Result: 最佳模型达到0.7131 Dice分数，在60个测试扫描中检测到181个栓塞，49个假阳性，28个假阴性。3D CNN模型表现优于ViT模型。

Conclusion: 3D U-Net ResNet是PE分割的有效架构，远端栓塞分割仍是挑战，PE分类和分割依赖不同特征集，分类预训练可能不利于分割性能。

Abstract: In this study, we curated a densely annotated in-house dataset comprising 490
CTPA scans. Using this dataset, we systematically evaluated nine widely used
segmentation architectures from both the CNN and Vision Transformer (ViT)
families, initialized with either pretrained or random weights, under a unified
testing framework as a performance audit. Our study leads to several important
observations: (1) 3D U-Net with a ResNet encoder remains a highly effective
architecture for PE segmentation; (2) 3D models are particularly well-suited to
this task given the morphological characteristics of emboli; (3) CNN-based
models generally yield superior performance compared to their ViT-based
counterparts in PE segmentation; (4) classification-based pretraining, even on
large PE datasets, can adversely impact segmentation performance compared to
training from scratch, suggesting that PE classification and segmentation may
rely on different sets of discriminative features; (5) different model
architectures show a highly consistent pattern of segmentation performance when
trained on the same data; and (6) while central and large emboli can be
segmented with satisfactory accuracy, distal emboli remain challenging due to
both task complexity and the scarcity of high-quality datasets. Besides these
findings, our best-performing model achieves a mean Dice score of 0.7131 for
segmentation. It detects 181 emboli with 49 false positives and 28 false
negatives from 60 in-house testing scans. Its generalizability is further
validated on public datasets.

Abstract: Handshapes serve a fundamental phonological role in signed languages, with
American Sign Language employing approximately 50 distinct shapes.
However,computational approaches rarely model handshapes explicitly, limiting
both recognition accuracy and linguistic analysis.We introduce a novel graph

configurations. Our approach combines anatomically-informed graph structures
with contrastive learning to address key challenges in handshape recognition,
including subtle interclass distinctions and temporal variations. We establish
the first benchmark for structured handshape recognition in signing sequences,
achieving 46% accuracy across 37 handshape classes (with baseline methods

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了胎儿超声图像中OOD检测性能与分类任务选择的关系，发现不同任务对OOD检测效果有显著影响，且最佳任务取决于ID-OOD标准类型（图像特征偏移或解剖特征偏移）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注不确定性量化方法，但忽视了分类任务本身对OOD检测的影响。在胎儿超声图像存在异质性和不同临床设置的背景下，可靠的OOD检测对深度学习模型的安全部署至关重要。

Method: 在四个分类任务上测试了八种不确定性量化方法，分析不同任务对OOD检测性能的影响，特别关注两种ID-OOD标准：图像特征偏移和解剖特征偏移。

Result: 实验表明OOD检测性能随任务选择显著变化，最佳任务取决于具体的ID-OOD标准类型。同时发现优秀的OOD检测性能并不保证最优的弃权预测效果。

Conclusion: 在医学图像分析中，必须根据具体下游应用需求来协调任务选择和不确定性策略，不能仅依赖OOD检测性能作为唯一标准。

Abstract: Reliable out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is important for safe deployment
of deep learning models in fetal ultrasound amidst heterogeneous image
characteristics and clinical settings. OOD detection relies on estimating a
classification model's uncertainty, which should increase for OOD samples.
While existing research has largely focused on uncertainty quantification
methods, this work investigates the impact of the classification task itself.
Through experiments with eight uncertainty quantification methods across four
classification tasks, we demonstrate that OOD detection performance
significantly varies with the task, and that the best task depends on the
defined ID-OOD criteria; specifically, whether the OOD sample is due to: i) an
image characteristic shift or ii) an anatomical feature shift. Furthermore, we
reveal that superior OOD detection does not guarantee optimal abstained
prediction, underscoring the necessity to align task selection and uncertainty
strategies with the specific downstream application in medical image analysis.

Method: 创建包含16,425张无人机图像的多模态数据集，解耦图像检索和特征匹配以公平评估定位性能。提出AdHoP改进技术，可与任何特征匹配器集成。

Result: 通过全面评估分析了领域偏移、数据分辨率和共可见性对定位精度的影响。AdHoP技术将匹配性能提升高达95%，平移误差降低高达63%。

Conclusion: OrthoLoC数据集填补了正射地理数据在视觉定位中的应用空白，AdHoP方法显著提升了特征匹配性能，为资源受限环境下的高精度定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate visual localization from aerial views is a fundamental problem with
applications in mapping, large-area inspection, and search-and-rescue
operations. In many scenarios, these systems require high-precision
localization while operating with limited resources (e.g., no internet
connection or GNSS/GPS support), making large image databases or heavy 3D
models impractical. Surprisingly, little attention has been given to leveraging
orthographic geodata as an alternative paradigm, which is lightweight and
increasingly available through free releases by governmental authorities (e.g.,
the European Union). To fill this gap, we propose OrthoLoC, the first
large-scale dataset comprising 16,425 UAV images from Germany and the United
States with multiple modalities. The dataset addresses domain shifts between
UAV imagery and geospatial data. Its paired structure enables fair benchmarking
of existing solutions by decoupling image retrieval from feature matching,
allowing isolated evaluation of localization and calibration performance.
Through comprehensive evaluation, we examine the impact of domain shifts, data
resolutions, and covisibility on localization accuracy. Finally, we introduce a
refinement technique called AdHoP, which can be integrated with any feature
matcher, improving matching by up to 95% and reducing translation error by up
to 63%. The dataset and code are available at:

Abstract: Anomaly detection in images is typically addressed by learning from
collections of training data or relying on reference samples. In many
real-world scenarios, however, such training data may be unavailable, and only
the test image itself is provided. We address this zero-shot setting by
proposing a single-image anomaly localization method that leverages the
inductive bias of convolutional neural networks, inspired by Deep Image Prior
(DIP). Our method is named Single Shot Decomposition Network (SSDnet). Our key
assumption is that natural images often exhibit unified textures and patterns,
and that anomalies manifest as localized deviations from these repetitive or
stochastic patterns. To learn the deep image prior, we design a patch-based
training framework where the input image is fed directly into the network for
self-reconstruction, rather than mapping random noise to the image as done in
DIP. To avoid the model simply learning an identity mapping, we apply masking,
patch shuffling, and small Gaussian noise. In addition, we use a perceptual
loss based on inner-product similarity to capture structure beyond pixel
fidelity. Our approach needs no external training data, labels, or references,
and remains robust in the presence of noise or missing pixels. SSDnet achieves
0.99 AUROC and 0.60 AUPRC on MVTec-AD and 0.98 AUROC and 0.67 AUPRC on the
fabric dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. The implementation code
will be released at https://github.com/mehrdadmoradi124/SSDnet

*Riad Ahmed Anonto,Sardar Md. Saffat Zabin,M. Saifur Rahman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对低资源孟加拉语的多模态对齐方法，通过三损失目标函数解决视觉-语言模型在低资源语言中的错误对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉-语言模型在低资源语言（如孟加拉语）中经常产生关于错误对象的流利文本的问题，这些问题源于配对数据稀缺、翻译枢纽破坏对齐以及英语中心预训练忽略目标语言语义。

Method: 使用计算感知的孟加拉语字幕生成流程，包括冻结的MaxViT提取视觉特征、孟加拉语原生mBART-50解码器，以及轻量级桥接模块。核心创新是三损失目标函数：Patch-Alignment Loss（PAL）使用解码器交叉注意力对齐真实和合成补丁描述符，InfoNCE强制全局真实-合成分离，基于Sinkhorn的最优传输确保平衡的细粒度补丁对应。

Result: 在Flickr30k-1k（BLEU-4 12.29，METEOR 27.98，BERTScore-F1 71.20）和MSCOCO-1k（BLEU-4 12.00，METEOR 28.14，BERTScore-F1 75.40）上表现优异，优于强CE基线，并将真实-合成质心差距缩小41%。

Conclusion: PAL+InfoNCE+OT的协同作用改善了接地性，减少了虚假匹配，在低资源语言的多模态对齐方面取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Grounding vision--language models in low-resource languages remains
challenging, as they often produce fluent text about the wrong objects. This
stems from scarce paired data, translation pivots that break alignment, and
English-centric pretraining that ignores target-language semantics. We address
this with a compute-aware Bengali captioning pipeline trained on LaBSE-verified
EN--BN pairs and 110k bilingual-prompted synthetic images. A frozen MaxViT
yields stable visual patches, a Bengali-native mBART-50 decodes, and a
lightweight bridge links the modalities. Our core novelty is a tri-loss
objective: Patch-Alignment Loss (PAL) aligns real and synthetic patch
descriptors using decoder cross-attention, InfoNCE enforces global
real--synthetic separation, and Sinkhorn-based OT ensures balanced fine-grained
patch correspondence. This PAL+InfoNCE+OT synergy improves grounding, reduces
spurious matches, and drives strong gains on Flickr30k-1k (BLEU-4 12.29, METEOR
27.98, BERTScore-F1 71.20) and MSCOCO-1k (BLEU-4 12.00, METEOR 28.14,
BERTScore-F1 75.40), outperforming strong CE baselines and narrowing the
real--synthetic centroid gap by 41%.

TL;DR: TinyBEV是一个统一的纯摄像头鸟瞰图框架，通过知识蒸馏将大型规划导向教师模型(UniAD)的能力转移到紧凑的实时学生模型中，在保持完整自动驾驶功能的同时大幅减少参数和提升速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有高效纯摄像头基线模型功能不完整的问题，将大规模多模态感知规划模型的智能压缩到资源受限的部署环境中，实现实时自动驾驶。

Method: 采用模型无关的多阶段蒸馏策略，结合特征级、输出级和自适应区域感知监督，将高容量多模态知识转移到轻量级BEV表示中。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，TinyBEV达到39.0 mAP检测精度、1.08 minADE运动预测精度和0.32碰撞率，运行速度提升5倍(11 FPS)，仅需28M参数(比UniAD减少78%)。

Conclusion: 研究表明完整堆栈的驾驶智能可以在资源受限环境中保留，弥合了大规模多模态感知规划模型与部署就绪实时自动驾驶系统之间的差距。

Abstract: We present TinyBEV, a unified, camera only Bird's Eye View (BEV) framework
that distills the full-stack capabilities of a large planning-oriented teacher
(UniAD [19]) into a compact, real-time student model. Unlike prior efficient
camera only baselines such as VAD[23] and VADv2[7], TinyBEV supports the
complete autonomy stack 3D detection, HD-map segmentation, motion forecasting,
occupancy prediction, and goal-directed planning within a streamlined
28M-parameter backbone, achieving a 78% reduction in parameters over UniAD
[19]. Our model-agnostic, multi-stage distillation strategy combines
feature-level, output-level, and adaptive region-aware supervision to
effectively transfer high-capacity multi-modal knowledge to a lightweight BEV
representation. On nuScenes[4], Tiny-BEV achieves 39.0 mAP for detection, 1.08
minADE for motion forecasting, and a 0.32 collision rate, while running 5x
faster (11 FPS) and requiring only camera input. These results demonstrate that
full-stack driving intelligence can be retained in resource-constrained
settings, bridging the gap between large-scale, multi-modal perception-planning
models and deployment-ready real-time autonomy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的运动模糊球体标注策略，将球体标注在模糊条纹的中心而非传统的前缘位置，并发布了乒乓球检测数据集，开发了BlurBall模型来联合估计球体位置和运动模糊属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标注方法将球体标记在模糊条纹的前缘，这引入了不对称性并忽略了与速度相关的运动线索。运动模糊降低了快速移动物体的清晰度，给检测系统带来挑战。

Method: 提出新的标注策略，将球体置于模糊条纹中心并明确标注模糊属性；开发BlurBall模型，通过多帧输入的Squeeze-and-Excitation注意力机制联合估计球体位置和运动模糊属性。

Result: 新的标注方法在各种模型上一致提高了检测性能；BlurBall模型在球体检测方面达到了最先进的结果；利用模糊信息不仅提高了检测精度，还实现了更可靠的轨迹预测。

Conclusion: 提出的标注策略和BlurBall模型有效解决了运动模糊球体检测问题，模糊信息的利用为实时体育分析提供了更可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Motion blur reduces the clarity of fast-moving objects, posing challenges for
detection systems, especially in racket sports, where balls often appear as
streaks rather than distinct points. Existing labeling conventions mark the
ball at the leading edge of the blur, introducing asymmetry and ignoring
valuable motion cues correlated with velocity. This paper introduces a new
labeling strategy that places the ball at the center of the blur streak and
explicitly annotates blur attributes. Using this convention, we release a new
table tennis ball detection dataset. We demonstrate that this labeling approach
consistently enhances detection performance across various models. Furthermore,
we introduce BlurBall, a model that jointly estimates ball position and motion
blur attributes. By incorporating attention mechanisms such as
Squeeze-and-Excitation over multi-frame inputs, we achieve state-of-the-art
results in ball detection. Leveraging blur not only improves detection accuracy
but also enables more reliable trajectory prediction, benefiting real-time
sports analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在视频中逐帧运行大型开放词汇检测器计算成本高的问题，寻求无需训练、无需标签的轻量级解决方案

Method: 在固定间隔的关键帧上调用OWLv2检测器，使用压缩域运动向量（3x3网格聚合）在中间帧传播检测结果，包含面积增长检查和可选单类别切换

Result: 在ILSVRC2015-VID数据集上达到mAP@0.5=0.609，在宽松IoU阈值下接近逐帧检测性能，优于基于跟踪器的传播方法

Conclusion: 压缩域传播是减少检测器调用次数的实用方法，能保持强大的零样本覆盖能力，且无需标签和训练

Abstract: Running a large open-vocabulary (Open-vocab) detector on every video frame is
accurate but expensive. We introduce a training-free pipeline that invokes
OWLv2 only on fixed-interval keyframes and propagates detections to
intermediate frames using compressed-domain motion vectors (MV). A simple 3x3
grid aggregation of motion vectors provides translation and uniform-scale
updates, augmented with an area-growth check and an optional single-class
switch. The method requires no labels, no fine-tuning, and uses the same prompt
list for all open-vocabulary methods. On ILSVRC2015-VID (validation dataset),
our approach (MVP) attains mAP@0.5=0.609 and mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316. At loose
intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds it remains close to framewise
OWLv2-Large (0.747/0.721 at 0.2/0.3 versus 0.784/0.780), reflecting that coarse
localization is largely preserved. Under the same keyframe schedule, MVP
outperforms tracker-based propagation (MOSSE, KCF, CSRT) at mAP@0.5. A
supervised reference (YOLOv12x) reaches 0.631 at mAP@0.5 but requires labeled
training, whereas our method remains label-free and open-vocabulary. These
results indicate that compressed-domain propagation is a practical way to
reduce detector invocations while keeping strong zero-shot coverage in videos.

Motivation: 高动态范围光照估计技术虽然在AR应用中很重要，但现有方法往往忽视了颜色鲁棒性这一关键因素。作者旨在探索简单适应技术是否能提升现有模型的颜色准确性。

Method: 使用包含多样光照颜色的新型HDR数据集，系统评估多种适应策略，重点测试预训练白平衡网络预处理输入图像的效果。

Result: 白平衡预处理方法在所有测试场景中表现最佳，显著提高了颜色鲁棒性，且该方法适用于三种最先进的光照估计方法。

Conclusion: 简单的白平衡预处理是提升光照估计模型颜色准确性的有效策略，具有通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Advances in high dynamic range (HDR) lighting estimation from a single image
have opened new possibilities for augmented reality (AR) applications.
Predicting complex lighting environments from a single input image allows for
the realistic rendering and compositing of virtual objects. In this work, we
investigate the color robustness of such methods -- an often overlooked yet
critical factor for achieving visual realism. While most evaluations conflate
color with other lighting attributes (e.g., intensity, direction), we isolate
color as the primary variable of interest. Rather than introducing a new
lighting estimation algorithm, we explore whether simple adaptation techniques
can enhance the color accuracy of existing models. Using a novel HDR dataset
featuring diverse lighting colors, we systematically evaluate several
adaptation strategies. Our results show that preprocessing the input image with
a pre-trained white balance network improves color robustness, outperforming
other strategies across all tested scenarios. Notably, this approach requires
no retraining of the lighting estimation model. We further validate the
generality of this finding by applying the technique to three state-of-the-art
lighting estimation methods from recent literature.

Result: 在110张多种格式支票的手工标注数据集上评估，表现出强大的性能和泛化能力

Conclusion: 该框架可作为生成高质量标注数据的引导机制，为开发专门化的实时目标检测模型奠定基础

Abstract: Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem,
facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However,
their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud,
underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the
core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of
critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition
(MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are
essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the
same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object
detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets,
a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this
paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field
detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction
with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot
detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment
in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a
hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts
demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore,
this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality
labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object
detection models tailored to institutional needs.

Motivation: 现有图表理解基准假设图像清晰且问题基于事实，但现实世界中的图表常包含失真，需要超越简单匹配的推理能力。当前模型在退化设置下表现不佳但依然过度自信。

Method: 评估ChatGPT 4o、Claude Sonnet 4和Gemini 2.5 Pro在图表理解任务上的表现，引入CHART NOISe数据集，包含图表腐蚀、遮挡和反向不一致性测试。

Result: 模型在图像腐蚀或遮挡条件下性能急剧下降，幻觉错误（如数值捏造、趋势误读、实体混淆）更频繁，且模型在退化设置下仍过度自信。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了图表推理中的系统性漏洞，提出了首个统一腐蚀、遮挡和反向不一致性的数据集，并建议了质量过滤和遮挡检测等缓解策略，为提升图表理解的鲁棒性建立了严格测试基准。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) show strong results on chart understanding, yet
existing benchmarks assume clean figures and fact based queries. Real world
charts often contain distortions and demand reasoning beyond simple matching.
We evaluate ChatGPT 4o, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, finding sharp
performance drops under corruption or occlusion, with hallucinations such as
value fabrication, trend misinterpretation, and entity confusion becoming more
frequent. Models remain overconfident in degraded settings, generating
plausible but unsupported explanations.
  To address this gap, we introduce CHART NOISe(Chart Hallucinations, Answers,
and Reasoning Testing on Noisy and Occluded Input Selections), a dataset
combining chart corruptions, occlusions, and exam style multiple choice
questions inspired by Korea's CSAT English section. A key innovation is prompt
reverse inconsistency, where models contradict themselves when asked to confirm
versus deny the same statement. Our contributions are threefold: (1)
benchmarking state of the art VLMs, exposing systematic vulnerabilities in
chart reasoning; (2) releasing CHART NOISe, the first dataset unifying
corruption, occlusion, and reverse inconsistency; and (3) proposing baseline
mitigation strategies such as quality filtering and occlusion detection.
Together, these efforts establish a rigorous testbed for advancing robustness
and reliability in chart understanding.

Abstract: Four-dimensional MRI (4D-MRI) is an promising technique for capturing
respiratory-induced motion in radiation therapy planning and delivery.
Conventional 4D reconstruction methods, which typically rely on phase binning
or separate template scans, struggle to capture temporal variability,
complicate workflows, and impose heavy computational loads. We introduce a
neural representation framework that considers respiratory motion as a smooth,
continuous deformation steered by a 1D surrogate signal, completely replacing
the conventional discrete sorting approach. The new method fuses motion
modeling with image reconstruction through two synergistic networks: the
Spatial Anatomy Network (SAN) encodes a continuous 3D anatomical
representation, while a Temporal Motion Network (TMN), guided by
Transformer-derived respiratory signals, produces temporally consistent
deformation fields. Evaluation using a free-breathing dataset of 19 volunteers
demonstrates that our template- and phase-free method accurately captures both
regular and irregular respiratory patterns, while preserving vessel and
bronchial continuity with high anatomical fidelity. The proposed method
significantly improves efficiency, reducing the total processing time from
approximately five hours required by conventional discrete sorting methods to
just 15 minutes of training. Furthermore, it enables inference of each 3D
volume in under one second. The framework accurately reconstructs 3D images at
any respiratory state, achieves superior performance compared to conventional
methods, and demonstrates strong potential for application in 4D radiation
therapy planning and real-time adaptive treatment.

Motivation: 快速移动小物体的不可预测运动模式和小视觉标记使得精确跟踪成为计算机视觉中的挑战性问题，特别是在体育机器人应用中需要轻量级准确的跟踪系统

Method: 使用包含10,000个标注壁球帧的自定义数据集，评估OCSORT、DeepOCSORT、ByteTrack、BoTSORT和StrongSORT五种卡尔曼滤波跟踪方法，重点分析推理速度和更新频率对跟踪精度的影响

Result: DeepOCSORT获得最低跟踪误差（平均ADE 31.15像素），ByteTrack处理速度最快（26.6ms），但所有跟踪器都表现出显著的空间跟踪漂移（3-11cm误差），误差率比标准物体跟踪基准高3-4倍

Conclusion: 当前基于卡尔曼滤波的跟踪方法在处理快速移动小物体的不可预测运动模式时存在根本性局限，需要开发专门的跟踪方法学

Abstract: Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking
of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems
in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics
applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot
perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking
methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their
performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects
that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the
performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking
methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom
dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p
resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors:
inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters
affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our
experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT
achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared
to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest
processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms.
However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit
significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values:
31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the
unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs.
Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial
improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking
benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving
tiny object tracking applications.

Result: 在UCF101数据集上，MoCrop在保持相同FLOPs时提升Top-1准确率3.5%，或在减少26.5%FLOPs时提升2.4%准确率。在CoViAR上达到89.2%准确率，同时将计算量从11.6降至8.5 GFLOPs。

Conclusion: MoCrop具有强通用性，在多种骨干网络上均表现一致，适合压缩域实时部署，为高效视频动作识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce MoCrop, a motion-aware adaptive cropping module for efficient
video action recognition in the compressed domain. MoCrop uses motion vectors
that are available in H.264 video to locate motion-dense regions and produces a
single clip-level crop that is applied to all I-frames at inference. The module
is training free, adds no parameters, and can be plugged into diverse
backbones. A lightweight pipeline that includes denoising & merge (DM), Monte
Carlo sampling (MCS), and adaptive cropping (AC) via a motion-density submatrix
search yields robust crops with negligible overhead. On UCF101, MoCrop improves
accuracy or reduces compute. With ResNet-50, it delivers +3.5% Top-1 accuracy
at equal FLOPs (attention setting), or +2.4% Top-1 accuracy with 26.5% fewer
FLOPs (efficiency setting). Applied to CoViAR, it reaches 89.2% Top-1 accuracy
at the original cost and 88.5% Top-1 accuracy while reducing compute from 11.6
to 8.5 GFLOPs. Consistent gains on MobileNet-V3, EfficientNet-B1, and Swin-B

Conclusion: CAFC-SE框架通过码本自适应特征压缩和语义增强，有效解决了低比特率条件下的特征压缩问题，提升了边缘-云系统的分析性能。

Abstract: Coding images for machines with minimal bitrate and strong analysis
performance is key to effective edge-cloud systems. Several approaches deploy
an image codec and perform analysis on the reconstructed image. Other methods
compress intermediate features using entropy models and subsequently perform
analysis on the decoded features. Nevertheless, these methods both perform
poorly under low-bitrate conditions, as they retain many redundant details or
learn over-concentrated symbol distributions. In this paper, we propose a
Codebook-based Adaptive Feature Compression framework with Semantic
Enhancement, named CAFC-SE. It maps continuous visual features to discrete
indices with a codebook at the edge via Vector Quantization (VQ) and
selectively transmits them to the cloud. The VQ operation that projects feature
vectors onto the nearest visual primitives enables us to preserve more
informative visual patterns under low-bitrate conditions. Hence, CAFC-SE is
less vulnerable to low-bitrate conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of our method in terms of rate and accuracy.

Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中计算资源受限环境下的实时高保真诊断需求，需要在保持轻量化的同时提高分割精度

Method: 设计了多核深度卷积块（MKDC）处理多分辨率空间关系，结合通道、空间和分组门控注意力机制来突出图像显著特征

Result: 仅需0.316M参数和0.314G FLOPs，在六个医学图像基准测试中DICE分数优于TransUNet、UNeXt等SOTA方法，参数量减少333倍，FLOPs减少123倍

Conclusion: MK-UNet在计算资源受限环境中为实时高保真医学诊断提供了无与伦比的解决方案，特别适用于即时医疗设备

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce MK-UNet, a paradigm shift towards
ultra-lightweight, multi-kernel U-shaped CNNs tailored for medical image
segmentation. Central to MK-UNet is the multi-kernel depth-wise convolution
block (MKDC) we design to adeptly process images through multiple kernels,
while capturing complex multi-resolution spatial relationships. MK-UNet also
emphasizes the images salient features through sophisticated attention
mechanisms, including channel, spatial, and grouped gated attention. Our
MK-UNet network, with a modest computational footprint of only 0.316M
parameters and 0.314G FLOPs, represents not only a remarkably lightweight, but
also significantly improved segmentation solution that provides higher accuracy
over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across six binary medical imaging
benchmarks. Specifically, MK-UNet outperforms TransUNet in DICE score with
nearly 333$\times$ and 123$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively.
Similarly, when compared against UNeXt, MK-UNet exhibits superior segmentation
performance, improving the DICE score up to 6.7% margins while operating with

Conclusion: BridgeSplat为可变形手术导航提供了一种有效解决方案，能够实时跟踪组织变形并更新术前CT数据，提高手术导航的准确性。

Abstract: We introduce BridgeSplat, a novel approach for deformable surgical navigation
that couples intraoperative 3D reconstruction with preoperative CT data to
bridge the gap between surgical video and volumetric patient data. Our method
rigs 3D Gaussians to a CT mesh, enabling joint optimization of Gaussian
parameters and mesh deformation through photometric supervision. By
parametrizing each Gaussian relative to its parent mesh triangle, we enforce
alignment between Gaussians and mesh and obtain deformations that can be
propagated back to update the CT. We demonstrate BridgeSplat's effectiveness on
visceral pig surgeries and synthetic data of a human liver under simulation,
showing sensible deformations of the preoperative CT on monocular RGB data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为DGLE的扩散引导标签增强框架，用于解决源自由域适应中伪标签质量差的问题。该方法从少量高质量伪标签出发，利用扩散模型传播生成完整的高质量伪标签集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有源自由域适应方法在优化包含大量噪声的完整伪标签集时面临困难，这限制了自训练方法的性能。需要一种能够从少量高质量标签出发并确保新生成标签质量的方法。

Method: 首先通过置信度过滤和超分辨率增强的伪标签融合方法获得少量高质量初始种子标签，然后利用扩散模型对不规则分布的种子标签进行传播，生成完整的高质量伪标签。

Result: 该方法有效避免了直接优化完整伪标签集的困难，显著提高了伪标签质量，从而提升了模型在目标域的性能。

Conclusion: DGLE框架通过扩散模型引导的标签增强策略，为源自由域适应的语义分割任务提供了一种有效的伪标签优化解决方案。

Abstract: Research on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation of
remote sensing images has been extensively conducted. However, research on how
to achieve domain adaptation in practical scenarios where source domain data is
inaccessible namely, source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) remains limited.
Self-training has been widely used in SFDA, which requires obtaining as many
high-quality pseudo-labels as possible to train models on target domain data.
Most existing methods optimize the entire pseudo-label set to obtain more
supervisory information. However, as pseudo-label sets often contain
substantial noise, simultaneously optimizing all labels is challenging. This
limitation undermines the effectiveness of optimization approaches and thus
restricts the performance of self-training. To address this, we propose a novel
pseudo-label optimization framework called Diffusion-Guided Label Enrichment
(DGLE), which starts from a few easily obtained high-quality pseudo-labels and
propagates them to a complete set of pseudo-labels while ensuring the quality
of newly generated labels. Firstly, a pseudo-label fusion method based on
confidence filtering and super-resolution enhancement is proposed, which
utilizes cross-validation of details and contextual information to obtain a
small number of high-quality pseudo-labels as initial seeds. Then, we leverage
the diffusion model to propagate incomplete seed pseudo-labels with irregular
distributions due to its strong denoising capability for randomly distributed
noise and powerful modeling capacity for complex distributions, thereby
generating complete and high-quality pseudo-labels. This method effectively
avoids the difficulty of directly optimizing the complete set of pseudo-labels,
significantly improves the quality of pseudo-labels, and thus enhances the
model's performance in the target domain.

Motivation: 双曲空间相比欧几里得空间对分层数据具有更好的表示能力，但在粗到细少样本类增量学习任务中尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用庞加莱球模型将特征提取器嵌入双曲空间，引入双曲对比损失和双曲全连接层，并利用最大熵分布进行特征增强以缓解少样本过拟合。

Result: 在C2FSCIL基准测试中，该方法有效提升了粗类和细类分类准确率。

Conclusion: 双曲空间嵌入为粗到细少样本类增量学习提供了有效的解决方案，显著改善了分层数据的表示性能。

Abstract: In the field of machine learning, hyperbolic space demonstrates superior
representation capabilities for hierarchical data compared to conventional
Euclidean space. This work focuses on the Coarse-To-Fine Few-Shot
Class-Incremental Learning (C2FSCIL) task. Our study follows the Knowe
approach, which contrastively learns coarse class labels and subsequently
normalizes and freezes the classifier weights of learned fine classes in the
embedding space. To better interpret the "coarse-to-fine" paradigm, we propose
embedding the feature extractor into hyperbolic space. Specifically, we employ
the Poincar\'e ball model of hyperbolic space, enabling the feature extractor
to transform input images into feature vectors within the Poincar\'e ball
instead of Euclidean space. We further introduce hyperbolic contrastive loss
and hyperbolic fully-connected layers to facilitate model optimization and
classification in hyperbolic space. Additionally, to enhance performance under
few-shot conditions, we implement maximum entropy distribution in hyperbolic
space to estimate the probability distribution of fine-class feature vectors.
This allows generation of augmented features from the distribution to mitigate
overfitting during training with limited samples. Experiments on C2FSCIL
benchmarks show that our method effectively improves both coarse and fine class
accuracies.

*Zixin Zhu,Haoxiang Li,Xuelu Feng,He Wu,Chunming Qiao,Junsong Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种几何感知的两阶段框架，通过解耦几何移除和外观渲染来解决目标物体及其因果视觉伪影（如阴影和反射）的移除问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像外观的方法要么严格遵循掩码对齐训练而无法移除未明确掩码的因果效应，要么采用松散掩码对齐策略缺乏可控性并可能过度擦除其他物体。这些限制源于忽略了物体几何存在与其视觉效应之间的因果关系。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段从几何（如深度）中直接移除物体，使用严格掩码对齐监督实现强几何约束的结构感知编辑；第二阶段基于更新后的几何条件渲染逼真RGB图像，因果视觉效应作为修改3D几何的结果被隐式考虑。引入基于正负样本对的偏好驱动目标来指导几何移除阶段的学习。

Result: 在两个流行基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在移除物体及其相关伪影方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该几何感知框架通过解耦几何移除和外观渲染，有效解决了物体移除中的因果视觉伪影问题，实现了更好的可控性和编辑效果。

Abstract: Towards intelligent image editing, object removal should eliminate both the
target object and its causal visual artifacts, such as shadows and reflections.
However, existing image appearance-based methods either follow strictly
mask-aligned training and fail to remove these causal effects which are not
explicitly masked, or adopt loosely mask-aligned strategies that lack
controllability and may unintentionally over-erase other objects. We identify
that these limitations stem from ignoring the causal relationship between an
object's geometry presence and its visual effects. To address this limitation,
we propose a geometry-aware two-stage framework that decouples object removal
into (1) geometry removal and (2) appearance rendering. In the first stage, we
remove the object directly from the geometry (e.g., depth) using strictly
mask-aligned supervision, enabling structure-aware editing with strong
geometric constraints. In the second stage, we render a photorealistic RGB
image conditioned on the updated geometry, where causal visual effects are
considered implicitly as a result of the modified 3D geometry. To guide
learning in the geometry removal stage, we introduce a preference-driven
objective based on positive and negative sample pairs, encouraging the model to
remove objects as well as their causal visual artifacts while avoiding new
structural insertions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in removing both objects and their
associated artifacts on two popular benchmarks. The code is available at
https://github.com/buxiangzhiren/GeoRemover.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SEGA方法，通过高斯平滑和梯度集成来提高无参考图像质量评估模型的黑盒攻击迁移性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NR-IQA模型白盒攻击方法在更现实的黑盒场景下迁移性较差，无法有效攻击未知目标模型

Method: SEGA方法通过高斯平滑源模型并集成其平滑梯度来近似目标模型梯度，并使用专门的扰动过滤掩码确保对抗扰动的不可感知性

Result: 在CLIVE数据集上的实验结果表明SEGA具有优越的迁移性，能够成功实现基于迁移的黑盒攻击

Conclusion: SEGA是首个解决NR-IQA模型攻击低迁移性挑战的方法，为黑盒场景下的模型安全评估提供了有效工具

Abstract: No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) models play an important role
in various real-world applications. Recently, adversarial attacks against
NR-IQA models have attracted increasing attention, as they provide valuable
insights for revealing model vulnerabilities and guiding robust system design.
Some effective attacks have been proposed against NR-IQA models in white-box
settings, where the attacker has full access to the target model. However,
these attacks often suffer from poor transferability to unknown target models
in more realistic black-box scenarios, where the target model is inaccessible.
This work makes the first attempt to address the challenge of low
transferability in attacking NR-IQA models by proposing a transferable Signed
Ensemble Gaussian black-box Attack (SEGA). The main idea is to approximate the
gradient of the target model by applying Gaussian smoothing to source models
and ensembling their smoothed gradients. To ensure the imperceptibility of
adversarial perturbations, SEGA further removes inappropriate perturbations
using a specially designed perturbation filter mask. Experimental results on
the CLIVE dataset demonstrate the superior transferability of SEGA, validating
its effectiveness in enabling successful transfer-based black-box attacks
against NR-IQA models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HadaSmileNet提出了一种新颖的特征融合框架，通过参数自由的Hadamard乘法交互直接整合基于Transformer的表征和基于生理学的D-Marker特征，在微笑表情识别任务中实现了最优性能。

Motivation: 解决现有多任务学习框架在微笑表情识别中存在的计算效率低下问题，这些方法由于辅助任务监督和复杂的损失平衡需求而效率不高。

Method: 提出HadaSmileNet框架，系统评估了15种融合策略，发现Hadamard乘法融合能够实现直接特征交互同时保持计算效率。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上建立了深度学习方法的新的最先进结果：UvA-NEMO（88.7%，+0.8）、MMI（99.7%）、SPOS（98.5%，+0.7）和BBC（100%，+5.0）。计算分析显示参数减少26%，训练简化。

Conclusion: 该框架的效率和有效性使其特别适合需要实时情感计算能力的多媒体数据挖掘应用的实际部署。

Abstract: The distinction between genuine and posed emotions represents a fundamental
pattern recognition challenge with significant implications for data mining
applications in social sciences, healthcare, and human-computer interaction.
While recent multi-task learning frameworks have shown promise in combining
deep learning architectures with handcrafted D-Marker features for smile facial
emotion recognition, these approaches exhibit computational inefficiencies due
to auxiliary task supervision and complex loss balancing requirements. This
paper introduces HadaSmileNet, a novel feature fusion framework that directly
integrates transformer-based representations with physiologically grounded
D-Markers through parameter-free multiplicative interactions. Through
systematic evaluation of 15 fusion strategies, we demonstrate that Hadamard
multiplicative fusion achieves optimal performance by enabling direct feature
interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed approach
establishes new state-of-the-art results for deep learning methods across four
benchmark datasets: UvA-NEMO (88.7 percent, +0.8), MMI (99.7 percent), SPOS
(98.5 percent, +0.7), and BBC (100 percent, +5.0). Comprehensive computational
analysis reveals 26 percent parameter reduction and simplified training
compared to multi-task alternatives, while feature visualization demonstrates
enhanced discriminative power through direct domain knowledge integration. The
framework's efficiency and effectiveness make it particularly suitable for
practical deployment in multimedia data mining applications that require
real-time affective computing capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件相机和3D高斯泼溅的单目视频动态人体与静态场景联合重建框架，通过事件引导的损失函数解决快速运动下的模糊问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RGB相机在快速运动下会产生运动模糊，难以重建动态人体和静态场景。事件相机具有微秒级时间分辨率的优势，更适合动态重建任务

Method: 使用统一的3D高斯集合，其中可学习的语义属性区分人体和场景高斯。人体高斯进行形变动画，场景高斯保持静态。提出事件引导损失函数，匹配连续渲染之间的亮度变化与事件流

Result: 在ZJU-MoCap-Blur和MMHPSD-Blur两个基准数据集上实现了最先进的人体-场景重建效果，在PSNR/SSIM指标上显著优于基线方法，LPIPS指标降低，尤其对高速运动目标效果更好

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部人体掩码，简化了高斯集合管理，有效解决了快速运动下的模糊问题，为动态人体与静态场景的联合重建提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic humans together with static scenes from monocular
videos remains difficult, especially under fast motion, where RGB frames suffer
from motion blur. Event cameras exhibit distinct advantages, e.g., microsecond
temporal resolution, making them a superior sensing choice for dynamic human
reconstruction. Accordingly, we present a novel event-guided human-scene
reconstruction framework that jointly models human and scene from a single
monocular event camera via 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, a unified set
of 3D Gaussians carries a learnable semantic attribute; only Gaussians
classified as human undergo deformation for animation, while scene Gaussians
stay static. To combat blur, we propose an event-guided loss that matches
simulated brightness changes between consecutive renderings with the event
stream, improving local fidelity in fast-moving regions. Our approach removes
the need for external human masks and simplifies managing separate Gaussian
sets. On two benchmark datasets, ZJU-MoCap-Blur and MMHPSD-Blur, it delivers
state-of-the-art human-scene reconstruction, with notable gains over strong
baselines in PSNR/SSIM and reduced LPIPS, especially for high-speed subjects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以同时满足实时性能和决策可解释性的要求，需要统一这两个目标

Method: 1) 将视频帧解构为结构化的人-物-交互-地点语义元组；2) 高效的在线事件去重和更新机制；3) 使用思维链策略微调大语言模型进行透明推理

Result: 在XD-Violence和UCF-Crime基准数据集上的实验表明，Live-E2T在威胁检测准确性、实时效率和可解释性方面显著优于最先进方法

Conclusion: Live-E2T成功解决了实时威胁监控中性能和可解释性的平衡问题，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Real-time threat monitoring identifies threatening behaviors in video streams
and provides reasoning and assessment of threat events through explanatory
text. However, prevailing methodologies, whether based on supervised learning
or generative models, struggle to concurrently satisfy the demanding
requirements of real-time performance and decision explainability. To bridge
this gap, we introduce Live-E2T, a novel framework that unifies these two
objectives through three synergistic mechanisms. First, we deconstruct video
frames into structured Human-Object-Interaction-Place semantic tuples. This
approach creates a compact, semantically focused representation, circumventing
the information degradation common in conventional feature compression. Second,
an efficient online event deduplication and updating mechanism is proposed to
filter spatio-temporal redundancies, ensuring the system's real time
responsiveness. Finally, we fine-tune a Large Language Model using a
Chain-of-Thought strategy, endow it with the capability for transparent and
logical reasoning over event sequences to produce coherent threat assessment
reports. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including XD-Violence and
UCF-Crime, demonstrate that Live-E2T significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in terms of threat detection accuracy, real-time efficiency, and the
crucial dimension of explainability.

Abstract: While editing directly from life, photographers have found it too difficult
to see simultaneously both the blue and the sky. Photographer and curator,
Szarkowski insightfully revealed one of the notable gaps between general and
aesthetic visual understanding: while the former focuses on identifying the
factual element in an image (sky), the latter transcends such object
identification, viewing it instead as an aesthetic component--a pure color
block (blue). Such fundamental distinctions between general (detection,
localization, etc.) and aesthetic (color, lighting, composition, etc.) visual
understanding present a significant challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Although some recent works have made initial explorations, they
are often limited to general and basic aesthetic commonsense. As a result, they
frequently fall short in real-world scenarios (Fig. 1), which require extensive
expertise--including photographic techniques, photo pre/post-processing
knowledge, and more, to provide a detailed analysis and description. To
fundamentally enhance the aesthetics understanding of MLLMs, we first introduce
a novel dataset, PhotoCritique, derived from extensive discussions among
professional photographers and enthusiasts, and characterized by the large
scale, expertise, and diversity. Then, to better learn visual aesthetics from
PhotoCritique, we furthur propose a novel model, PhotoEye, featuring a
languageguided multi-view vision fusion mechanism to understand image
aesthetics from multiple perspectives. Finally, we present a novel benchmark,
PhotoBench, a comprehensive and professional benchmark for aesthetic visual
understanding. On existing benchmarks and PhotoBench, our model demonstrates
clear advantages over existing models.

Abstract: This paper presents an advanced tumor segmentation framework for real-time

leverages the XMem model, a memory-augmented architecture, to segment tumors

preventing us from reporting precise quantitative results at this stage.
Nevertheless, From our preliminary impressions during development, the
XMem-based framework demonstrated reasonable segmentation performance and
satisfied the clinical real-time requirement. Our work contributes to improving
the precision of tumor tracking during MRI-guided radiotherapy, which is
crucial for enhancing the accuracy and safety of cancer treatments.

Conclusion: SSCM模型有效解决了多对比度MRI超分辨率中的空间语义一致性问题，在保持解剖细节的同时提高了成像效率。

Abstract: Multi-contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging super-resolution (MC-MRI SR) aims
to enhance low-resolution (LR) contrasts leveraging high-resolution (HR)
references, shortening acquisition time and improving imaging efficiency while
preserving anatomical details. The main challenge lies in maintaining
spatial-semantic consistency, ensuring anatomical structures remain
well-aligned and coherent despite structural discrepancies and motion between
the target and reference images. Conventional methods insufficiently model
spatial-semantic consistency and underuse frequency-domain information, which
leads to poor fine-grained alignment and inadequate recovery of high-frequency
details. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Semantic Consistent Model
(SSCM), which integrates a Dynamic Spatial Warping Module for inter-contrast
spatial alignment, a Semantic-Aware Token Aggregation Block for long-range
semantic consistency, and a Spatial-Frequency Fusion Block for fine structure
restoration. Experiments on public and private datasets show that SSCM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters while ensuring spatially and
semantically consistent reconstructions.

Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法依赖大规模数据和计算资源，需要多阶段训练和大型骨干网络，导致训练成本高昂。本文旨在在有限预算下解决这一问题。

Method: 1) OraPO方法：通过轻量级oracle步骤将失败的GRPO探索转化为直接偏好监督，实现单阶段RL训练；2) FactS奖励：提取原子临床事实并与真实标签进行蕴含检查，提供密集、可解释的句子级奖励。

Conclusion: OraPO和FactS共同构建了一个紧凑而强大的框架，显著提高了临床挑战性案例的学习效率，为资源受限环境下的放射学报告生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Radiology report generation (RRG) aims to automatically produce clinically
faithful reports from chest X-ray images. Prevailing work typically follows a
scale-driven paradigm, by multi-stage training over large paired corpora and
oversized backbones, making pipelines highly data- and compute-intensive. In
this paper, we propose Oracle-educated GRPO {OraPO) with a FactScore-based
reward (FactS) to tackle the RRG task under constrained budgets. OraPO enables
single-stage, RL-only training by converting failed GRPO explorations on rare
or difficult studies into direct preference supervision via a lightweight
oracle step. FactS grounds learning in diagnostic evidence by extracting atomic
clinical facts and checking entailment against ground-truth labels, yielding
dense, interpretable sentence-level rewards. Together, OraPO and FactS create a
compact and powerful framework that significantly improves learning efficiency
on clinically challenging cases, setting the new SOTA performance on the
CheXpert Plus dataset (0.341 in F1) with 2--3 orders of magnitude less training
data using a small base VLM on modest hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参考式方法存在两个主要限制：(a) 只能接受单一风格图像，无法实现混合美学和扩展到更多风格；(b) 缺乏平衡多种风格影响的机制。

Method: 通过语义标记分解模块编码所有风格图像和文本提示，自适应注入到冻结扩散模型的每个交叉注意力层中，相似度感知重加权模块在每个去噪步骤重新校准对每个风格组件的注意力分配。

Result: 定性和定量评估显示AMSF在多风格融合结果上始终优于最先进方法，且其融合设计可无缝扩展到两个或更多风格。

Conclusion: AMSF是朝着扩散模型中表达性多风格生成迈出的实用一步。

Abstract: We propose Adaptive Multi-Style Fusion (AMSF), a reference-based
training-free framework that enables controllable fusion of multiple reference
styles in diffusion models. Most of the existing reference-based methods are
limited by (a) acceptance of only one style image, thus prohibiting hybrid
aesthetics and scalability to more styles, and (b) lack of a principled
mechanism to balance several stylistic influences. AMSF mitigates these
challenges by encoding all style images and textual hints with a semantic token
decomposition module that is adaptively injected into every cross-attention
layer of an frozen diffusion model. A similarity-aware re-weighting module then
recalibrates, at each denoising step, the attention allocated to every style
component, yielding balanced and user-controllable blends without any
fine-tuning or external adapters. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations
show that AMSF produces multi-style fusion results that consistently outperform
the state-of-the-art approaches, while its fusion design scales seamlessly to
two or more styles. These capabilities position AMSF as a practical step toward
expressive multi-style generation in diffusion models.

Motivation: 4D毫米波雷达在自动驾驶中具有成本效益和鲁棒性，但其点云存在显著稀疏性和噪声，限制了在3D物体检测中的独立应用。现有雷达-相机融合方法大多采用为LiDAR-相机融合设计的显式鸟瞰图融合范式，忽略了雷达的固有缺陷。

Method: 提出MLF-4DRCNet框架，包含三个关键组件：增强雷达点编码器（ERPE）模块、分层场景融合池化（HSFP）模块和提议级融合增强（PLFE）模块。ERPE通过2D图像实例增强雷达点云密度，并使用三重注意力体素特征编码器编码为体素；HSFP使用可变形注意力动态整合多尺度体素特征与2D图像特征；PLFE通过融合图像特征精炼区域提议。

Result: 在View-of-Delft（VoD）和TJ4DRadSet数据集上的实验结果表明，MLF-4DRCNet达到了最先进的性能，在VoD数据集上实现了与基于LiDAR模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: MLF-4DRCNet通过点级、场景级和提议级的多模态信息融合，实现了全面的特征表示，有效解决了4D雷达点云稀疏性和噪声问题，为雷达-相机融合提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The emerging 4D millimeter-wave radar, measuring the range, azimuth,
elevation, and Doppler velocity of objects, is recognized for its
cost-effectiveness and robustness in autonomous driving. Nevertheless, its
point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone
application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have
provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt
explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera
fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the
sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to
coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose
MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via
multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the
point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling
comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components:
the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion
Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module.
Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image
instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel
Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D
image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts
pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image
features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP.
Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets
demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD
dataset.

TL;DR: 提出PDLS框架，通过双流潜在空间引导解决扩散模型图像重建中的语义漂移问题，无需训练即可实现结构保真和语义准确


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法将图像编码为单个潜在向量时难以平衡结构保真度和语义准确性，导致重建图像出现语义漂移（如细节模糊或属性错误）

Method: 基于Rectified Flow模型构建训练免费框架，将反演过程分解为结构路径和语义路径，通过LQR控制器动态引导生成轨迹

Result: 在FFHQ-1K和ImageNet-1K数据集上的多种反演任务（高斯去模糊、运动去模糊、超分辨率和自由形式修复）中，PDLS比单潜在基线方法产生更忠实于原始图像且语义对齐更好的重建结果

Conclusion: PDLS框架有效解决了扩散模型图像重建中的语义漂移问题，无需昂贵的逐图像优化即可保持细节并确保语义准确性

Abstract: Inverting corrupted images into the latent space of diffusion models is
challenging. Current methods, which encode an image into a single latent
vector, struggle to balance structural fidelity with semantic accuracy, leading
to reconstructions with semantic drift, such as blurred details or incorrect
attributes. To overcome this, we introduce Prompt-Guided Dual Latent Steering
(PDLS), a novel, training-free framework built upon Rectified Flow models for
their stable inversion paths. PDLS decomposes the inversion process into two
complementary streams: a structural path to preserve source integrity and a
semantic path guided by a prompt. We formulate this dual guidance as an optimal
control problem and derive a closed-form solution via a Linear Quadratic
Regulator (LQR). This controller dynamically steers the generative trajectory
at each step, preventing semantic drift while ensuring the preservation of fine
detail without costly, per-image optimization. Extensive experiments on FFHQ-1K
and ImageNet-1K under various inversion tasks, including Gaussian deblurring,
motion deblurring, super-resolution and freeform inpainting, demonstrate that
PDLS produces reconstructions that are both more faithful to the original image
and better aligned with the semantic information than single-latent baselines.

TL;DR: 开发了Prima，首个用于神经影像的视觉语言模型，在52种神经疾病诊断中平均AUC达92.0%，优于现有AI模型，可缓解医疗系统压力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球MRI需求增长给医疗系统带来压力，延长周转时间，加剧医生职业倦怠，特别是在资源匮乏地区问题更严重。

Method: 利用大型学术医疗系统作为数据引擎，训练基于22万+MRI研究的视觉语言模型，采用分层视觉架构提供通用可转移的MRI特征。

Result: 在包含3万MRI研究的1年系统测试中，Prima在主要神经疾病诊断中表现优异，提供可解释的鉴别诊断、工作列表优先级和临床转诊建议。

Conclusion: Prima展示了健康系统规模VLM的变革潜力，有助于推进AI驱动的医疗保健，并能减轻医疗系统偏见。

Abstract: Neuroimaging is a ubiquitous tool for evaluating patients with neurological
diseases. The global demand for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies has
risen steadily, placing significant strain on health systems, prolonging
turnaround times, and intensifying physician burnout \cite{Chen2017-bt,
Rula2024-qp-1}. These challenges disproportionately impact patients in
low-resource and rural settings. Here, we utilized a large academic health
system as a data engine to develop Prima, the first vision language model (VLM)
serving as an AI foundation for neuroimaging that supports real-world, clinical
MRI studies as input. Trained on over 220,000 MRI studies, Prima uses a
hierarchical vision architecture that provides general and transferable MRI
features. Prima was tested in a 1-year health system-wide study that included
30K MRI studies. Across 52 radiologic diagnoses from the major neurologic
disorders, including neoplastic, inflammatory, infectious, and developmental
lesions, Prima achieved a mean diagnostic area under the ROC curve of 92.0,
outperforming other state-of-the-art general and medical AI models. Prima
offers explainable differential diagnoses, worklist priority for radiologists,
and clinical referral recommendations across diverse patient demographics and
MRI systems. Prima demonstrates algorithmic fairness across sensitive groups
and can help mitigate health system biases, such as prolonged turnaround times
for low-resource populations. These findings highlight the transformative
potential of health system-scale VLMs and Prima's role in advancing AI-driven
healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Chain-of-Thought方法将理解和生成过程分离，限制了统一模型在图像生成能力不足时的推理指导能力。

Method: 使用"图像编辑"作为桥梁，在推理过程中通过统一模型的强大理解能力来指导生成。先验证生成图像并融入理解到编辑指令中，然后逐步增强图像质量。

Result: 在TIIF基准测试的长提示设置上实现了3.92%的性能提升，显著优于现有的文本到图像推理方法。

Conclusion: UiG框架通过理解与生成的深度融合，有效缓解了统一模型生成能力的局限性，为文本到图像生成提供了新的推理范式。

Abstract: Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for
text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these
reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which
limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the
deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel
reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG),
which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to
reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is
to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities
during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative
abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse
understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated
image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing
instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step,
gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG
framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image
generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on
the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark. The project code:

Abstract: Monocular relative and metric depth estimation has seen a tremendous boost in
the last few years due to the sharp advancements in foundation models and in
particular transformer based networks. As we start to see applications to the
domain of endoscopic images, there is still a lack of robust benchmarks and
high-quality datasets in that area. This paper addresses these limitations by
presenting a comprehensive benchmark of state-of-the-art (metric and relative)
depth estimation models evaluated on real, unseen endoscopic images, providing
critical insights into their generalisation and performance in clinical
scenarios. Additionally, we introduce and publish a novel synthetic dataset
(EndoSynth) of endoscopic surgical instruments paired with ground truth metric
depth and segmentation masks, designed to bridge the gap between synthetic and
real-world data. We demonstrate that fine-tuning depth foundation models using
our synthetic dataset boosts accuracy on most unseen real data by a significant
margin. By providing both a benchmark and a synthetic dataset, this work
advances the field of depth estimation for endoscopic images and serves as an
important resource for future research. Project page, EndoSynth dataset and
trained weights are available at https://github.com/TouchSurgery/EndoSynth.

TL;DR: 提出LEAF-Mamba模型，通过局部强调状态空间模块和自适应融合模块，解决RGB-D显著性目标检测中局部语义不足和跨模态融合不充分的问题，在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RGB-D显著性目标检测方法要么受限于CNN的局部感受野，要么受限于Vision Transformer的二次复杂度，难以平衡性能与计算效率。状态空间模型(SSM)如Mamba具有线性复杂度且能建模长距离依赖，但直接应用于RGB-D SOD会导致局部语义不足和跨模态融合不充分。

Method: 提出LEAF-Mamba模型，包含两个核心组件：1)局部强调状态空间模块(LE-SSM)，用于捕获两种模态的多尺度局部依赖；2)基于SSM的自适应融合模块(AFM)，实现互补的跨模态交互和可靠的跨模态集成。

Result: 在16种最先进的RGB-D SOD方法中，LEAF-Mamba在效能和效率上均表现最优。此外，该方法在RGB-T SOD任务上也表现出色，证明了强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LEAF-Mamba模型通过创新的局部强调和自适应融合机制，有效解决了RGB-D显著性目标检测中的关键问题，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的性能，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: RGB-D salient object detection (SOD) aims to identify the most conspicuous
objects in a scene with the incorporation of depth cues. Existing methods
mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision
Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a
challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently,
state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling
long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to
RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate
cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and
Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel
components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture
multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive
fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable
cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in
both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent
performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.

Motivation: 食品行业对生产质量和效率要求不断提高，但Vision Transformer模型参数量大、计算复杂度高，限制了在资源受限环境中的部署

Method: 集成窗口多头注意力机制(WMHAM)和空间注意力机制(SAM)，WMHAM通过窗口划分降低计算成本，SAM自适应强调关键空间区域

Result: 在Food-101和Vireo Food-172数据集上分别达到95.24%和94.33%的准确率，同时显著减少参数和FLOPs

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和分类性能之间实现了有效平衡，适合在资源受限环境中部署

Abstract: With the rapid development of society and continuous advances in science and
technology, the food industry increasingly demands higher production quality
and efficiency. Food image classification plays a vital role in enabling
automated quality control on production lines, supporting food safety
supervision, and promoting intelligent agricultural production. However, this
task faces challenges due to the large number of parameters and high
computational complexity of Vision Transformer models. To address these issues,
we propose a lightweight food image classification algorithm that integrates a
Window Multi-Head Attention Mechanism (WMHAM) and a Spatial Attention Mechanism
(SAM). The WMHAM reduces computational cost by capturing local and global
contextual features through efficient window partitioning, while the SAM
adaptively emphasizes key spatial regions to improve discriminative feature
representation. Experiments conducted on the Food-101 and Vireo Food-172
datasets demonstrate that our model achieves accuracies of 95.24% and 94.33%,
respectively, while significantly reducing parameters and FLOPs compared with
baseline methods. These results confirm that the proposed approach achieves an
effective balance between computational efficiency and classification
performance, making it well-suited for deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感中的开放集土地覆盖分析需要同时实现精细空间定位和语义开放分类，既要检测和分割无类别监督的新对象，又要通过多模态推理为其分配可解释的语义标签。

Method: 三阶段框架：1）使用可提示的微调分割模型（SAM）进行精确发现和掩码提取；2）通过两阶段微调的多模态大语言模型（MLLM）进行语义归因和上下文描述；3）使用LLM作为评判者和人工评分进行MLLM评估。

Conclusion: OSDA展示了在自动化制图更新和大规模地球观测分析方面的强大潜力，解决了开放世界遥感解释的关键挑战。

Abstract: Open-set land-cover analysis in remote sensing requires the ability to
achieve fine-grained spatial localization and semantically open categorization.
This involves not only detecting and segmenting novel objects without
categorical supervision but also assigning them interpretable semantic labels
through multimodal reasoning. In this study, we introduce OSDA, an integrated
three-stage framework for annotation-free open-set land-cover discovery,
segmentation, and description. The pipeline consists of: (1) precise discovery
and mask extraction with a promptable fine-tuned segmentation model (SAM), (2)
semantic attribution and contextual description via a two-phase fine-tuned
multimodal large language model (MLLM), and (3) LLM-as-judge and manual scoring
of the MLLMs evaluation. By combining pixel-level accuracy with high-level
semantic understanding, OSDA addresses key challenges in open-world remote
sensing interpretation. Designed to be architecture-agnostic and label-free,
the framework supports robust evaluation across diverse satellite imagery
without requiring manual annotation. Our work provides a scalable and
interpretable solution for dynamic land-cover monitoring, showing strong
potential for automated cartographic updating and large-scale earth observation
analysis.

Motivation: 当前植物自动识别主要基于北美和西欧的野外照片数据，而生物多样性最丰富的热带地区数据匮乏。植物标本馆收藏了大量热带植物标本，可作为补充数据源。

Method: 采用跨域分类任务，训练集包含数十万份植物标本馆标本和数千张野外照片，测试集仅包含野外照片。数据还包括5种形态和功能性状值。

Result: 挑战评估了利用标本馆数据改进热带地区植物识别的可行性，参与者开发了多种跨域学习方法。

Conclusion: 植物标本馆数据可以作为补充资源，帮助改进生物多样性丰富但数据贫乏地区的植物自动识别系统。

Abstract: Automated plant identification has improved considerably thanks to recent
advances in deep learning and the availability of training data with more and
more field photos. However, this profusion of data concerns only a few tens of
thousands of species, mainly located in North America and Western Europe, much
less in the richest regions in terms of biodiversity such as tropical
countries. On the other hand, for several centuries, botanists have
systematically collected, catalogued and stored plant specimens in herbaria,
especially in tropical regions, and recent efforts by the biodiversity
informatics community have made it possible to put millions of digitised
records online. The LifeCLEF 2021 plant identification challenge (or "PlantCLEF
2021") was designed to assess the extent to which automated identification of
flora in data-poor regions can be improved by using herbarium collections. It
is based on a dataset of about 1,000 species mainly focused on the Guiana
Shield of South America, a region known to have one of the highest plant
diversities in the world. The challenge was evaluated as a cross-domain
classification task where the training set consisted of several hundred
thousand herbarium sheets and a few thousand photos to allow learning a
correspondence between the two domains. In addition to the usual metadata
(location, date, author, taxonomy), the training data also includes the values
of 5 morphological and functional traits for each species. The test set
consisted exclusively of photos taken in the field. This article presents the
resources and evaluations of the assessment carried out, summarises the
approaches and systems used by the participating research groups and provides

Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成方法在融合不同类别对象时经常产生有偏差、视觉混乱或语义不一致的结果，且缺乏全面的基准数据集。

Method: AGSwap方法包含两个关键组件：组级嵌入交换（通过特征操作融合不同概念的语义属性）和自适应组更新（基于平衡评估分数的动态优化机制）。

Result: 实验表明AGSwap在简单和复杂提示下都优于现有的最先进组合式T2I方法，包括GPT-Image-1。

Conclusion: AGSwap是一种简单而高效的跨类别对象融合方法，配合新提出的COF数据集，显著提升了文本到图像生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Fusing cross-category objects to a single coherent object has gained
increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation due to its broad
applications in virtual reality, digital media, film, and gaming. However,
existing methods often produce biased, visually chaotic, or semantically
inconsistent results due to overlapping artifacts and poor integration.
Moreover, progress in this field has been limited by the absence of a
comprehensive benchmark dataset. To address these problems, we propose
\textbf{Adaptive Group Swapping (AGSwap)}, a simple yet highly effective
approach comprising two key components: (1) Group-wise Embedding Swapping,
which fuses semantic attributes from different concepts through feature
manipulation, and (2) Adaptive Group Updating, a dynamic optimization mechanism
guided by a balance evaluation score to ensure coherent synthesis.
Additionally, we introduce \textbf{Cross-category Object Fusion (COF)}, a
large-scale, hierarchically structured dataset built upon ImageNet-1K and
WordNet. COF includes 95 superclasses, each with 10 subclasses, enabling
451,250 unique fusion pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSwap
outperforms state-of-the-art compositional T2I methods, including GPT-Image-1
using simple and complex prompts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法受限于封闭词汇集，难以适应开放世界场景。虽然近期尝试使用基础模型，但依赖昂贵数据集和耗时微调。

Method: 三阶段框架：(i) 使用VLM获取文本-图像交叉注意力图；(ii) 利用扩散模型补充结构信息；(iii) 通过注意力进化模块净化分割掩码。

Result: 在广泛实验中，该框架持续优于现有的弱监督和零样本方法。

Conclusion: RSVG-ZeroOV提供了一个高效、可扩展的解决方案，无需繁琐的任务特定训练。

Abstract: Remote sensing visual grounding (RSVG) aims to localize objects in remote
sensing images based on free-form natural language expressions. Existing
approaches are typically constrained to closed-set vocabularies, limiting their
applicability in open-world scenarios. While recent attempts to leverage
generic foundation models for open-vocabulary RSVG, they overly rely on
expensive high-quality datasets and time-consuming fine-tuning. To address
these limitations, we propose \textbf{RSVG-ZeroOV}, a training-free framework
that aims to explore the potential of frozen generic foundation models for
zero-shot open-vocabulary RSVG. Specifically, RSVG-ZeroOV comprises three key
stages: (i) Overview: We utilize a vision-language model (VLM) to obtain
cross-attention\footnote[1]{In this paper, although decoder-only VLMs use
self-attention over all tokens, we refer to the image-text interaction part as
cross-attention to distinguish it from pure visual self-attention.}maps that
capture semantic correlations between text queries and visual regions. (ii)
Focus: By leveraging the fine-grained modeling priors of a diffusion model
(DM), we fill in gaps in structural and shape information of objects, which are
often overlooked by VLM. (iii) Evolve: A simple yet effective attention
evolution module is introduced to suppress irrelevant activations, yielding
purified segmentation masks over the referred objects. Without cumbersome
task-specific training, RSVG-ZeroOV offers an efficient and scalable solution.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently
outperforms existing weakly-supervised and zero-shot methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了属性提示组合（APC）框架，利用文本语义联合增强目标重识别（ReID）的判别性和泛化性。通过属性提示生成器和快慢训练策略，在保持预训练视觉语言模型泛化能力的同时提升ReID特定判别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ReID模型局限于单域或跨域场景，单域模型容易过拟合域特定特征，跨域模型可能抑制身份特定判别线索。需要同时增强判别性和泛化性。

Method: 提出APC框架：1）属性提示生成器（APG）- 包含语义属性词典（SAD）和提示组合模块（PCM）；2）快慢训练策略（FSTS）- 快速更新流获取ReID特定知识，慢速更新流保留预训练VLM的泛化知识。

Result: 在传统和域泛化ReID数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架在判别性和泛化性方面均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: APC框架通过文本语义和双流训练策略，有效解决了ReID中判别性与泛化性的平衡问题，具有更好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to recognize individuals across
non-overlapping camera views. While recent advances have achieved remarkable
progress, most existing models are constrained to either single-domain or
cross-domain scenarios, limiting their real-world applicability. Single-domain
models tend to overfit to domain-specific features, whereas cross-domain models
often rely on diverse normalization strategies that may inadvertently suppress
identity-specific discriminative cues. To address these limitations, we propose
an Attribute Prompt Composition (APC) framework, which exploits textual
semantics to jointly enhance discrimination and generalization. Specifically,
we design an Attribute Prompt Generator (APG) consisting of a Semantic
Attribute Dictionary (SAD) and a Prompt Composition Module (PCM). SAD is an
over-complete attribute dictionary to provide rich semantic descriptions, while
PCM adaptively composes relevant attributes from SAD to generate discriminative
attribute-aware features. In addition, motivated by the strong generalization
ability of Vision-Language Models (VLM), we propose a Fast-Slow Training
Strategy (FSTS) to balance ReID-specific discrimination and generalizable
representation learning. Specifically, FSTS adopts a Fast Update Stream (FUS)
to rapidly acquire ReID-specific discriminative knowledge and a Slow Update
Stream (SUS) to retain the generalizable knowledge inherited from the
pre-trained VLM. Through a mutual interaction, the framework effectively
focuses on ReID-relevant features while mitigating overfitting. Extensive
experiments on both conventional and Domain Generalized (DG) ReID datasets
demonstrate that our framework surpasses state-of-the-art methods, exhibiting
superior performances in terms of both discrimination and generalization. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于最优传输的OTCCLIP框架，通过细粒度视觉和文本特征匹配来防御CLIP模型的数据投毒攻击，相比现有方法能更有效降低攻击成功率并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法仅依赖图像和文本的全局表示匹配，忽略了细粒度特征，可能导致错误的图像-文本配对，损害CLIP预训练效果。

Method: 提出最优传输距离度量细粒度视觉和文本特征集之间的相似性，基于此重新分配图像-文本对，并使用最优传输目标函数促进模态间和模态内的细粒度对齐。

Result: OTCCLIP能成功降低投毒攻击的成功率，相比之前方法显著提高了在中毒数据集上训练的CLIP模型的零样本和线性探测性能。

Conclusion: 基于最优传输的细粒度特征匹配方法能有效防御CLIP模型的投毒攻击，提升模型鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)
models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to
massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous
defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption
for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global
representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of
visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and
harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal
Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We
propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained
visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the
proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the
negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality
fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective
functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease
the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous
methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing
performance trained on poisoned datasets.

*Yilin Gao,Kangyi Chen,Zhongxing Peng,Hengjie Lu,Shugong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出LFI框架，通过模拟视觉语言模型中的交互过程来改进视觉基础模型的知识迁移能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型主要采用结果导向范式，忽略了视觉语言模型中跨模态交互过程的知识，导致知识迁移效果受限

Method: 基于认知启发的LFI框架，包含交互查询和交互监督两个关键技术，通过捕捉预训练视觉语言模型中的动态交互模式

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著提升：TinyImageNet分类提升3.3mAP，COCO检测/分割提升1.6mAP/2.4AP，跨域设置中PACS和VLCS分别提升2.4和9.3零样本性能

Conclusion: LFI框架通过建模交互过程实现了更忠实和高效的知识迁移，在认知对齐和语义一致性方面显著优于结果导向方法

Abstract: Current visual foundation models (VFMs) face a fundamental limitation in
transferring knowledge from vision language models (VLMs), while VLMs excel at
modeling cross-modal interactions through unified representation spaces,
existing VFMs predominantly adopt result-oriented paradigms that neglect the
underlying interaction processes. This representational discrepancy hinders
effective knowledge transfer and limits generalization across diverse vision
tasks. We propose Learning from Interactions (LFI), a cognitive-inspired
framework that addresses this gap by explicitly modeling visual understanding
as an interactive process. Our key insight is that capturing the dynamic
interaction patterns encoded in pre-trained VLMs enables more faithful and
efficient knowledge transfer to VFMs. The approach centers on two technical
innovations, Interaction Queries, which maintain persistent relational
structures across network layers, and interaction-based supervision, derived
from the cross-modal attention mechanisms of VLMs. Comprehensive experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks, achieving 3.3
and 1.6mAP/2.4AP absolute gains on TinyImageNet classification and COCO
detection/segmentation respectively, with minimal parameter overhead and faster
convergence. The framework particularly excels in cross-domain settings,
delivering 2.4 and 9.3 zero-shot improvements on PACS and VLCS. Human
evaluations further confirm its cognitive alignment, outperforming
result-oriented methods by 2.7 times in semantic consistency metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出HyPSAM模型，利用SAM的零样本泛化能力解决RGB-T显著目标检测问题，通过动态融合网络和即插即用优化网络实现多模态特征融合和精确目标定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB-T显著目标检测面临特征融合不足和数据稀缺的挑战，需要更有效的多模态信息整合方法来提升边界精度和完整目标识别。

Method: 提出HyPSAM模型：1）动态融合网络（DFNet）使用动态卷积和多分支解码生成高质量初始显著图；2）即插即用优化网络（P2RNet）使用混合提示（文本、掩码、框）指导SAM优化显著图。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到最先进性能，且具有显著通用性，可与不同RGB-T SOD方法集成实现性能提升。

Conclusion: HyPSAM展示了提示工程在RGB-T SOD领域的潜力，通过混合提示驱动SAM实现了精确的显著目标检测，为多模态视觉任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to identify prominent
objects by integrating complementary information from RGB and thermal
modalities. However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects
remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the
extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel
hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the
zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for
RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that
generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs
dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive
cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter
kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose
a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general
optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid
prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and
box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating
with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains,
thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field. The
code and results of our method are available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TriFusion-AE是一种多模态交叉注意力自编码器，通过整合文本先验、多视图图像的单目深度图和LiDAR点云来提高点云去噪和重建的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR点云在自动驾驶和机器人感知中容易受到噪声、遮挡和对抗性攻击的影响，传统自编码器在真实世界挑战性条件下性能下降。

Method: 提出TriFusion-AE模型，通过交叉注意力机制对齐文本语义线索、图像几何特征和LiDAR空间结构，实现多模态融合表示学习。

Result: 在强对抗攻击和重噪声条件下，模型表现出显著更强的鲁棒性，而CNN自编码器在这些条件下崩溃；在轻度扰动下增益有限。

Conclusion: 多模态融合框架具有模型无关性，可与任何基于CNN的点云自编码器无缝集成，在nuScenes-mini数据集上验证了低数据部署场景的有效性。

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception is central to autonomous driving and robotics, yet raw
point clouds remain highly vulnerable to noise, occlusion, and adversarial
corruptions. Autoencoders offer a natural framework for denoising and
reconstruction, but their performance degrades under challenging real-world
conditions. In this work, we propose TriFusion-AE, a multimodal cross-attention
autoencoder that integrates textual priors, monocular depth maps from
multi-view images, and LiDAR point clouds to improve robustness. By aligning
semantic cues from text, geometric (depth) features from images, and spatial
structure from LiDAR, TriFusion-AE learns representations that are resilient to
stochastic noise and adversarial perturbations. Interestingly, while showing
limited gains under mild perturbations, our model achieves significantly more
robust reconstruction under strong adversarial attacks and heavy noise, where
CNN-based autoencoders collapse. We evaluate on the nuScenes-mini dataset to
reflect realistic low-data deployment scenarios. Our multimodal fusion
framework is designed to be model-agnostic, enabling seamless integration with
any CNN-based point cloud autoencoder for joint representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了COLT方法，旨在增强开源视频大语言模型的持续工具使用能力，使其能够在不断演化的工具流中自动获取工具使用能力而不会遗忘已学工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设工具库固定，难以适应现实世界中工具数据持续演化和流式输入的环境，存在工具泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: COLT方法包含可学习的工具代码本作为工具特定记忆系统，根据用户指令与工具特征的相似度动态选择相关工具，并收集了视频中心工具使用指令调优数据集VideoToolBench。

Result: 在现有视频LLM基准和工具使用专用数据集VideoToolBench上的广泛实验表明，COLT方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: COLT方法成功解决了视频LLM在持续工具流环境中的工具使用问题，展现了优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the
research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert
models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage
capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the
instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however,
assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to
real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming
in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL
Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a
successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past
learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as
a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected
based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the
codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a
video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive
experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific
VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
proposed COLT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于生成先验的方法在稀疏视角3D重建中难以保证多视角一致性，导致结构模糊和细节不真实。

Method: 提出FixingGS方法：1）更准确且跨视角一致的扩散先验蒸馏技术；2）自适应渐进增强方案，专门优化约束不足区域。

Result: 大量实验证明FixingGS在视觉质量和重建性能上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: FixingGS通过充分利用现有扩散模型的能力，成功解决了稀疏视角3DGS重建中的伪影去除和内容补全问题，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable success in
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. However, reconstructing 3D scenes
from sparse viewpoints remains highly challenging due to insufficient visual
information, which results in noticeable artifacts persisting across the 3D
representation. To address this limitation, recent methods have resorted to
generative priors to remove artifacts and complete missing content in
under-constrained areas. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches struggle
to ensure multi-view consistency, resulting in blurred structures and
implausible details. In this work, we propose FixingGS, a training-free method
that fully exploits the capabilities of the existing diffusion model for
sparse-view 3DGS reconstruction enhancement. At the core of FixingGS is our
distillation approach, which delivers more accurate and cross-view coherent
diffusion priors, thereby enabling effective artifact removal and inpainting.
In addition, we propose an adaptive progressive enhancement scheme that further
refines reconstructions in under-constrained regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that FixingGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods with
superior visual quality and reconstruction performance. Our code will be
released publicly.

TL;DR: Bi-VLM提出了一种基于高斯分位数的非均匀权重分离方法，通过显著性感知混合量化算法对视觉语言模型进行超低比特量化（≤2比特），显著提升硬件受限环境下的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的计算需求和内存要求过高，限制了其在硬件受限环境中的应用，需要开发超低比特精度的量化方法来解决这一效率瓶颈。

Method: 基于高斯分位数将模型权重非均匀分离为异常值（显著）和多个正常值（不显著）子集，提出显著性感知混合量化算法，根据显著性度量和压缩目标对缩放器和二进制矩阵施加不同约束。

Result: 在VLM的语言模型部分，Bi-VLM在视觉问答任务上比SOTA方法提升3%-47%；整体VLM性能提升4%-45%。量化模型中的图像令牌冗余度达90%-99%，可进一步剪枝提升效率。

Conclusion: Bi-VLM成功实现了超低比特量化，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率，为硬件受限环境下的VLM部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We address the critical gap between the computational demands of
vision-language models and the possible ultra-low-bit weight precision
(bitwidth $\leq2$ bits) we can use for higher efficiency. Our work is motivated
by the substantial computational cost and memory requirements of VLMs, which
restrict their applicability in hardware-constrained environments. We propose
Bi-VLM, which separates model weights non-uniformly based on the Gaussian
quantiles. Our formulation groups the model weights into outlier (salient) and
multiple inlier (unsalient) subsets, ensuring that each subset contains a
proportion of weights corresponding to its quantile in the distribution. We
propose a saliency-aware hybrid quantization algorithm and use it to quantize
weights by imposing different constraints on the scaler and binary matrices
based on the saliency metric and compression objective. We have evaluated our
approach on different VLMs. For the language model part of the VLM, our Bi-VLM
outperforms the SOTA by 3%-47% on the visual question answering task in terms
of four different benchmarks and three different models. For the overall VLM,
our Bi-VLM outperforms the SOTA by 4%-45%. We also perform token pruning on the
quantized models and observe that there is redundancy of image tokens 90% - 99%
in the quantized models. This helps us to further prune the visual tokens to
improve efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiSSECT是一个自监督学习框架，通过多尺度向量量化在医学图像表示学习中引入离散表示瓶颈，抑制捷径学习，提高跨任务和跨领域的表示迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法在医学图像中存在依赖复杂架构、解剖学先验和精心调优的数据增强等问题，容易发生捷径学习，特别是在胸部X光等解剖相似度高、病理特征细微的模态中。

Method: 将多尺度向量量化集成到自监督学习流程中，施加离散表示瓶颈，约束模型学习可重复、结构感知的特征，同时抑制视图特定或低效用模式。

Result: DiSSECT在分类和分割任务上均取得强劲性能，需要极少或无需微调，在低标签情况下表现出特别高的标签效率。

Conclusion: DiSSECT在多个公共医学影像数据集上验证了其相对于现有最先进方法的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for medical
image representation learning, particularly in settings with limited labeled
data. However, existing SSL methods often rely on complex architectures,
anatomy-specific priors, or heavily tuned augmentations, which limit their
scalability and generalizability. More critically, these models are prone to
shortcut learning, especially in modalities like chest X-rays, where anatomical
similarity is high and pathology is subtle. In this work, we introduce DiSSECT
-- Discrete Self-Supervision for Efficient Clinical Transferable
Representations, a framework that integrates multi-scale vector quantization
into the SSL pipeline to impose a discrete representational bottleneck. This
constrains the model to learn repeatable, structure-aware features while
suppressing view-specific or low-utility patterns, improving representation
transfer across tasks and domains. DiSSECT achieves strong performance on both
classification and segmentation tasks, requiring minimal or no fine-tuning, and
shows particularly high label efficiency in low-label regimes. We validate
DiSSECT across multiple public medical imaging datasets, demonstrating its
robustness and generalizability compared to existing state-of-the-art
approaches.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合热成像、深度学习和车联网通信的实时鹿只检测与驾驶员预警系统，旨在减少美国每年210万起的鹿车碰撞事故。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鹿车碰撞是美国严重的安全问题，每年造成约440人死亡、5.9万人受伤和100亿美元经济损失，同时导致鹿群数量下降。现有可见光摄像头在恶劣天气条件下检测效果不足60%。

Method: 系统使用热成像技术和深度学习算法，基于在北卡罗来纳州Mars Hill收集的12,000多张热成像鹿图像数据集进行训练和验证。当检测到高概率鹿只时，通过C-V2X通信设备向周围车辆和路边单元广播传感器数据。

Result: 实验评估显示系统性能优异：平均精度98.84%，精确率95.44%，召回率95.96%。现场测试验证了系统在多样化天气条件下的鲁棒性，热成像检测精度保持在88-92%，而传统可见光摄像头效果低于60%。端到端延迟始终低于100毫秒。

Conclusion: 该研究通过热成像和联网车辆技术，为减少鹿车碰撞事故建立了可行的技术路径，系统能够为驾驶员提供提前预警，有效提升道路安全。

Abstract: Deer-vehicle collisions represent a critical safety challenge in the United
States, causing nearly 2.1 million incidents annually and resulting in
approximately 440 fatalities, 59,000 injuries, and 10 billion USD in economic
damages. These collisions also contribute significantly to declining deer
populations. This paper presents a real-time detection and driver warning
system that integrates thermal imaging, deep learning, and
vehicle-to-everything communication to help mitigate deer-vehicle collisions.
Our system was trained and validated on a custom dataset of over 12,000 thermal
deer images collected in Mars Hill, North Carolina. Experimental evaluation
demonstrates exceptional performance with 98.84 percent mean average precision,
95.44 percent precision, and 95.96 percent recall. The system was field tested
during a follow-up visit to Mars Hill and readily sensed deer providing the
driver with advanced warning. Field testing validates robust operation across
diverse weather conditions, with thermal imaging maintaining between 88 and 92
percent detection accuracy in challenging scenarios where conventional visible
light based cameras achieve less than 60 percent effectiveness. When a high
probability threshold is reached sensor data sharing messages are broadcast to
surrounding vehicles and roadside units via cellular vehicle to everything
(CV2X) communication devices. Overall, our system achieves end to end latency
consistently under 100 milliseconds from detection to driver alert. This
research establishes a viable technological pathway for reducing deer-vehicle
collisions through thermal imaging and connected vehicles.

Motivation: 手术数据标注稀缺限制了深度学习系统在计算机辅助干预中的发展，传统扩散模型存在数据记忆化问题，生成的样本不一致且多样性不足，可能损害下游任务性能。

Method: 提出Surgical Application-Aligned Diffusion (SAADi)框架，构建偏好和非偏好合成图像对，通过轻量级微调使扩散模型生成过程与下游目标明确对齐。

Result: 在三个手术数据集上的实验显示，分类任务提升7-9%，分割任务提升2-10%，对代表性不足的类别改进尤为显著。迭代细化合成样本可进一步提升性能4-10%。

Conclusion: SAADi方法克服了样本退化问题，确立了任务感知对齐作为缓解数据稀缺和推进手术视觉应用的关键原则。

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated surgical data poses a significant challenge for
developing deep learning systems in computer-assisted interventions. While
diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data
memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to
improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical
Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion
models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs
of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs
lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation
process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical
datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and
$2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed
for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further
boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method
overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key
principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具增强大语言模型的训练方法存在局限性，自我反思实践依赖启发式提示或单向推理，在多轮交互中脆弱，错误后模型常重复相同错误。

Method: 结合DAPO和GSPO目标，采用针对工具使用的奖励方案，优化Reflect-Call-Final逐步策略。引入Tool-Reflection-Bench基准程序化检查结构有效性、可执行性、参数正确性和结果一致性。

Result: 在BFCL v3和Tool-Reflection-Bench上的实验显示，多轮工具调用成功率和错误恢复能力显著提升，冗余调用减少。

Conclusion: 使反思明确化并直接优化可提高工具交互的可靠性，为智能体提供从失败中学习的可复现路径。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with
supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes
single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts
or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning
error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a
failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured
reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit,
controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise
reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and
then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine
DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing
the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce
Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks
structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result
consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call,
reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits.
Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn
tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These
results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly
improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for
agents to learn from failure.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效实现动态PET的高时空分辨率，代码已开源。

Abstract: Achieving high image quality for temporal frames in dynamic positron emission
tomography (PET) is challenging due to the limited statistic especially for the
short frames. Recent studies have shown that deep learning (DL) is useful in a
wide range of medical image denoising tasks. In this paper, we propose a
model-based neural network for dynamic PET image denoising. The inter-frame
spatial correlation and intra-frame structural consistency in dynamic PET are
used to establish the kernel space-based multidimensional sparse (KMDS) model.
We then substitute the inherent forms of the parameter estimation with neural
networks to enable adaptive parameters optimization, forming the end-to-end
neural KMDS-Net. Extensive experimental results from simulated and real data
demonstrate that the neural KMDS-Net exhibits strong denoising performance for
dynamic PET, outperforming previous baseline methods. The proposed method may
be used to effectively achieve high temporal and spatial resolution for dynamic
PET. Our source code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly enhanced video understanding capabilities, opening new
possibilities for practical applications. Yet current video benchmarks focus
largely on indoor scenes or short-range outdoor activities, leaving the
challenges associated with long-distance travel largely unexplored. Mastering
extended geospatial-temporal trajectories is critical for next-generation
MLLMs, underpinning real-world tasks such as embodied-AI planning and
navigation. To bridge this gap, we present VIR-Bench, a novel benchmark
consisting of 200 travel videos that frames itinerary reconstruction as a
challenging task designed to evaluate and push forward MLLMs'
geospatial-temporal intelligence. Experimental results reveal that
state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary ones, struggle to achieve high
scores, underscoring the difficulty of handling videos that span extended
spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, we conduct an in-depth case study in
which we develop a prototype travel-planning agent that leverages the insights
gained from VIR-Bench. The agent's markedly improved itinerary recommendations
verify that our evaluation protocol not only benchmarks models effectively but
also translates into concrete performance gains in user-facing applications.

*Garam Kim,Tae Kyeong Jeong,Juyoun Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合光流分割标签插值和多任务学习的新框架，用于解决机器人辅助手术中视觉数据理解的时空不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人辅助手术需要精确理解手术过程中的视觉数据，但现有研究多为单任务方法，且存在时空标注不平衡问题——长期标注（如阶段和步骤）每帧都有，而短期标注（如手术器械分割和动作检测）仅关键帧有。

Method: 使用从标注关键帧估计的光流将标签传播到相邻未标注帧，通过光流分割标签插值丰富稀疏的空间监督，平衡训练中的时空信息，结合多任务学习。

Result: 该集成方法提高了手术场景理解的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 该方法增强了机器人辅助手术的实用性，通过解决标注数据的时空不平衡问题，实现了更全面的手术场景理解。

Abstract: Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) has become a critical paradigm in modern
surgery, promoting patient recovery and reducing the burden on surgeons through
minimally invasive approaches. To fully realize its potential, however, a
precise understanding of the visual data generated during surgical procedures
is essential. Previous studies have predominantly focused on single-task
approaches, but real surgical scenes involve complex temporal dynamics and
diverse instrument interactions that limit comprehensive understanding.
Moreover, the effective application of multi-task learning (MTL) requires
sufficient pixel-level segmentation data, which are difficult to obtain due to
the high cost and expertise required for annotation. In particular, long-term
annotations such as phases and steps are available for every frame, whereas
short-term annotations such as surgical instrument segmentation and action
detection are provided only for key frames, resulting in a significant
temporal-spatial imbalance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework that combines optical flow-based segmentation label interpolation
with multi-task learning. optical flow estimated from annotated key frames is
used to propagate labels to adjacent unlabeled frames, thereby enriching sparse
spatial supervision and balancing temporal and spatial information for
training. This integration improves both the accuracy and efficiency of
surgical scene understanding and, in turn, enhances the utility of RAS.

Conclusion: ColorBlindnessEval是评估和改进VLMs在现实应用中可靠性的重要工具，突显了提升VLMs在复杂视觉环境中鲁棒性的必要性。

Abstract: This paper presents ColorBlindnessEval, a novel benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in visually
adversarial scenarios inspired by the Ishihara color blindness test. Our
dataset comprises 500 Ishihara-like images featuring numbers from 0 to 99 with
varying color combinations, challenging VLMs to accurately recognize numerical
information embedded in complex visual patterns. We assess 9 VLMs using Yes/No
and open-ended prompts and compare their performance with human participants.
Our experiments reveal limitations in the models' ability to interpret numbers
in adversarial contexts, highlighting prevalent hallucination issues. These
findings underscore the need to improve the robustness of VLMs in complex
visual environments. ColorBlindnessEval serves as a valuable tool for
benchmarking and improving the reliability of VLMs in real-world applications
where accuracy is critical.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hyper-Bagel是一个统一的多模态加速框架，通过推测解码和多阶段蒸馏技术，同时加速多模态理解和生成任务，实现2倍以上的理解加速和16-22倍的生成加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态内容中交错标记数量的增加，扩散去噪和自回归解码的迭代过程带来了显著的计算开销，需要高效的加速解决方案。

Method: 采用分而治之策略，使用推测解码进行下一标记预测，结合多阶段蒸馏过程进行扩散去噪，开发了高效的1-NFE模型。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合对抗蒸馏和人类反馈学习，实现了极致的成本效益和响应性，使复杂的多模态交互变得无缝且即时。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for
their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse
content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved
multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and
autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address
this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to
simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our
approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for
next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion
denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over
a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting
lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a
22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of
the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that
enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining
advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model
achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex
multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.

Abstract: Medical imaging provides critical evidence for clinical diagnosis, treatment
planning, and surgical decisions, yet most existing imaging models are narrowly
focused and require multiple specialized networks, limiting their
generalization. Although large-scale language and multimodal models exhibit
strong reasoning and multi-task capabilities, real-world clinical applications
demand precise visual grounding, multimodal integration, and chain-of-thought
reasoning. We introduce Citrus-V, a multimodal medical foundation model that
combines image analysis with textual reasoning. The model integrates detection,
segmentation, and multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling pixel-level
lesion localization, structured report generation, and physician-like
diagnostic inference in a single framework. We propose a novel multimodal
training approach and release a curated open-source data suite covering
reasoning, detection, segmentation, and document understanding tasks.
Evaluations demonstrate that Citrus-V outperforms existing open-source medical
models and expert-level imaging systems across multiple benchmarks, delivering
a unified pipeline from visual grounding to clinical reasoning and supporting
precise lesion quantification, automated reporting, and reliable second
opinions.

*Gianmarco Spinaci,Lukas Klic,Giovanni Colavizza*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了多模态大语言模型和视觉语言模型在基督教图像单标签分类任务中的能力，发现GPT-4o和Gemini-2.5 Pro在大多数情况下优于ResNet50基线模型，支持将LLMs作为数字人文学科中的元数据管理工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估通用多模态模型是否能够解释通常由监督分类器处理的基督教图像学，并评估其性能，为数字人文学科的元数据管理提供工具支持。

Method: 使用ArtDL、ICONCLASS和Wikidata三个数据集，在三种条件下测试模型：(1)使用类别标签分类，(2)使用Iconclass描述分类，(3)使用五个示例进行少样本学习，并与ResNet50基线进行比较。

Result: Gemini-2.5 Pro和GPT-4o在大多数数据集上超越了ResNet50基线；在Wikidata数据集上准确率显著下降，Siglip表现最佳；添加类别描述通常能提高零样本性能，而少样本学习效果较差。

Conclusion: 通用多模态LLMs能够在视觉复杂的文化遗产领域进行分类，支持将LLMs作为数字人文学科工作流中的元数据管理工具，未来需要研究提示优化和扩展分类策略。

Abstract: This study evaluates the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) in the task of single-label
classification of Christian Iconography. The goal was to assess whether
general-purpose VLMs (CLIP and SigLIP) and LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5,
can interpret the Iconography, typically addressed by supervised classifiers,
and evaluate their performance. Two research questions guided the analysis:
(RQ1) How do multimodal LLMs perform on image classification of Christian
saints? And (RQ2), how does performance vary when enriching input with
contextual information or few-shot exemplars? We conducted a benchmarking study
using three datasets supporting Iconclass natively: ArtDL, ICONCLASS, and
Wikidata, filtered to include the top 10 most frequent classes. Models were
tested under three conditions: (1) classification using class labels, (2)
classification with Iconclass descriptions, and (3) few-shot learning with five
exemplars. Results were compared against ResNet50 baselines fine-tuned on the
same datasets. The findings show that Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-4o outperformed
the ResNet50 baselines. Accuracy dropped significantly on the Wikidata dataset,
where Siglip reached the highest accuracy score, suggesting model sensitivity
to image size and metadata alignment. Enriching prompts with class descriptions
generally improved zero-shot performance, while few-shot learning produced
lower results, with only occasional and minimal increments in accuracy. We
conclude that general-purpose multimodal LLMs are capable of classification in
visually complex cultural heritage domains. These results support the
application of LLMs as metadata curation tools in digital humanities workflows,
suggesting future research on prompt optimization and the expansion of the
study to other classification strategies and models.

*Ismael Elsharkawi,Hossam Sharara,Ahmed Rafea*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种可学习的重参数化图构建方法（LRGC），用于视觉图神经网络，解决了传统图构建方法缺乏可学习性和超参数依赖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的视觉图神经网络依赖非参数化的统计方法来构建图结构，这些方法无法选择最佳节点邻域，且需要超参数搜索。现有方法如k-NN图构建、超图构建和相似度阈值图构建都缺乏可学习的、无超参数的图构建能力。

Method: LRGC方法在每对节点之间应用键-查询注意力机制，然后使用软阈值重参数化进行边选择，这使得可以使用可微的数学模型进行训练。通过可学习参数选择邻域，消除了传统聚类或阈值方法引入的偏差。

Result: 在ImageNet-1k基准数据集上，提出的ViG-LRGC方法在相似模型规模下优于最先进的ViG模型。

Conclusion: LRGC提供了一种可学习的、无超参数的图构建方法，能够根据训练数据自适应调整每层的阈值，显著提升了视觉图神经网络的性能。

Abstract: Image Representation Learning is an important problem in Computer Vision.
Traditionally, images were processed as grids, using Convolutional Neural
Networks or as a sequence of visual tokens, using Vision Transformers.
Recently, Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViG) have proposed the treatment of
images as a graph of nodes; which provides a more intuitive image
representation. The challenge is to construct a graph of nodes in each layer
that best represents the relations between nodes and does not need a
hyper-parameter search. ViG models in the literature depend on
non-parameterized and non-learnable statistical methods that operate on the
latent features of nodes to create a graph. This might not select the best
neighborhood for each node. Starting from k-NN graph construction to HyperGraph
Construction and Similarity-Thresholded graph construction, these methods lack
the ability to provide a learnable hyper-parameter-free graph construction
method. To overcome those challenges, we present the Learnable Reparameterized
Graph Construction (LRGC) for Vision Graph Neural Networks. LRGC applies
key-query attention between every pair of nodes; then uses soft-threshold
reparameterization for edge selection, which allows the use of a differentiable
mathematical model for training. Using learnable parameters to select the
neighborhood removes the bias that is induced by any clustering or thresholding
methods previously introduced in the literature. In addition, LRGC allows
tuning the threshold in each layer to the training data since the thresholds
are learnable through training and are not provided as hyper-parameters to the
model. We demonstrate that the proposed ViG-LRGC approach outperforms
state-of-the-art ViG models of similar sizes on the ImageNet-1k benchmark
dataset.

TL;DR: 提出Point Prompt Defender框架，通过对抗性强化学习自动优化SAM的点提示，采用攻击-防御范式提升分割性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式或手动设计的提示，限制了SAM的可扩展性和泛化能力，需要自动优化提示质量

Method: 构建双空间图表示图像块，使用攻击者和防御者两个智能体进行对抗训练，攻击者学习破坏SAM性能的提示，防御者学习抑制这些提示恢复准确性

Result: 实验表明该框架有效提升SAM的鲁棒性和泛化能力，无需重新训练即可增强不同任务的分割性能

Conclusion: 建立了一个灵活、可解释、即插即用的提示优化框架，为基于提示的分割提供了新思路

Abstract: Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of the Segment
Anything Model (SAM), yet existing approaches often rely on heuristic or
manually crafted prompts, limiting scalability and generalization. In this
paper, we propose Point Prompt Defender, an adversarial reinforcement learning
framework that adopts an attack-for-defense paradigm to automatically optimize
point prompts. We construct a task-agnostic point prompt environment by
representing image patches as nodes in a dual-space graph, where edges encode
both physical and semantic distances. Within this environment, an attacker
agent learns to activate a subset of prompts that maximally degrade SAM's
segmentation performance, while a defender agent learns to suppress these
disruptive prompts and restore accuracy. Both agents are trained using Deep
Q-Networks with a reward signal based on segmentation quality variation. During
inference, only the defender is deployed to refine arbitrary coarse prompt
sets, enabling enhanced SAM segmentation performance across diverse tasks
without retraining. Extensive experiments show that Point Prompt Defender
effectively improves SAM's robustness and generalization, establishing a
flexible, interpretable, and plug-and-play framework for prompt-based
segmentation.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose the first Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-free
deblurring 3D Gaussian Splatting method via event camera, dubbed DeblurSplat.
We address the motion-deblurring problem in two ways. First, we leverage the
pretrained capability of the dense stereo module (DUSt3R) to directly obtain
accurate initial point clouds from blurred images. Without calculating camera
poses as an intermediate result, we avoid the cumulative errors transfer from
inaccurate camera poses to the initial point clouds' positions. Second, we
introduce the event stream into the deblur pipeline for its high sensitivity to
dynamic change. By decoding the latent sharp images from the event stream and
blurred images, we can provide a fine-grained supervision signal for scene
reconstruction optimization. Extensive experiments across a range of scenes
demonstrate that DeblurSplat not only excels in generating high-fidelity novel
views but also achieves significant rendering efficiency compared to the SOTAs
in deblur 3D-GS.

Abstract: Moir\'e patterns arise from spectral aliasing between display pixel lattices

pose significant challenges for digital image demoir\'eing. We propose
Moir\'eNet, a convolutional neural U-Net-based framework that synergistically
integrates frequency and spatial domain features for effective artifact
removal. Moir\'eNet introduces two key components: a Directional
Frequency-Spatial Encoder (DFSE) that discerns moir\'e orientation via
directional difference convolution, and a Frequency-Spatial Adaptive Selector
(FSAS) that enables precise, feature-adaptive suppression. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Moir\'eNet achieves state-of-the-art performance
on public and actively used datasets while being highly parameter-efficient.
With only 5.513M parameters, representing a 48% reduction compared to ESDNet-L,
Moir\'eNet combines superior restoration quality with parameter efficiency,
making it well-suited for resource-constrained applications including
smartphone photography, industrial imaging, and augmented reality.

Conclusion: 将音视频分割任务重新定义为频率域分解和重组问题，提出的FAVS框架通过频率感知方法有效解决了模态间的频率域矛盾，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: Audio-visual segmentation (AVS) plays a critical role in multimodal machine
learning by effectively integrating audio and visual cues to precisely segment
objects or regions within visual scenes. Recent AVS methods have demonstrated
significant improvements. However, they overlook the inherent frequency-domain
contradictions between audio and visual modalities--the pervasively interfering
noise in audio high-frequency signals vs. the structurally rich details in
visual high-frequency signals. Ignoring these differences can result in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we rethink the AVS task from a deeper
perspective by reformulating AVS task as a frequency-domain decomposition and
recomposition problem. To this end, we introduce a novel Frequency-Aware
Audio-Visual Segmentation (FAVS) framework consisting of two key modules:
Frequency-Domain Enhanced Decomposer (FDED) module and Synergistic Cross-Modal
Consistency (SCMC) module. FDED module employs a residual-based iterative
frequency decomposition to discriminate modality-specific semantics and
structural features, and SCMC module leverages a mixture-of-experts
architecture to reinforce semantic consistency and modality-specific feature
preservation through dynamic expert routing. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our FAVS framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on three
benchmark datasets, and abundant qualitative visualizations further verify the
effectiveness of the proposed FDED and SCMC modules. The code will be released
as open source upon acceptance of the paper.

Abstract: Deep learning has become the de facto standard and dominant paradigm in image

often results in "black-box" models, whose decision-making processes are

understand how AI model process and make decision, the field of xAI has
emerged. This paper surveys four representative approaches in xAI for visual
perception tasks: (i) Saliency Maps, (ii) Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM),
(iii) Prototype-based methods, and (iv) Hybrid approaches. We analyze their
underlying mechanisms, strengths and limitations, as well as evaluation
metrics, thereby providing a comprehensive overview to guide future research

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to revolutionize transportation by
improving efficiency and safety. Their success relies on 3D vision systems that
effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs
use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides
high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation,
and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is
time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather
or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding
techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby
improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in
AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's
temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on
the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various
configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance
metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results
demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and
its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data,
producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural
detail.

*Chuni Liu,Hongjie Li,Jiaqi Du,Yangyang Hou,Qian Sun,Lei Jin,Ke Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种异常引导的自监督预训练方法（AGSSP），通过异常先验指导表示学习，解决金属表面缺陷检测中预训练-微调范式的领域差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法面临两个关键问题：在自然图像数据集（如ImageNet）上预训练存在显著领域差距；而在工业数据上进行朴素自监督预训练则因现有学习目标无法区分细微缺陷模式与复杂背景噪声而效果不佳。

Method: AGSSP采用两阶段框架：1）通过从异常图中蒸馏知识来预训练模型骨干网络，鼓励网络捕获缺陷显著特征；2）使用从这些图导出的伪缺陷框预训练检测器，使其与定位任务对齐。同时开发了知识增强方法生成高质量异常图，并收集了12万张图像的大规模工业数据集。

Result: 大量实验表明，AGSSP在各种设置下持续提升性能，相比基于ImageNet的模型，在mAP@0.5上提升高达10%，在mAP@0.5:0.95上提升11.4%。

Conclusion: AGSSP为金属表面缺陷检测提供了一种有效的预训练新范式，通过异常先验指导表示学习，显著提升了检测性能，所有代码、预训练模型和数据集均已公开。

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm is a crucial strategy in metallic surface
defect detection for mitigating the challenges posed by data scarcity. However,
its implementation presents a critical dilemma. Pretraining on natural image
datasets such as ImageNet, faces a significant domain gap. Meanwhile, naive
self-supervised pretraining on in-domain industrial data is often ineffective
due to the inability of existing learning objectives to distinguish subtle
defect patterns from complex background noise and textures. To resolve this, we
introduce Anomaly-Guided Self-Supervised Pretraining (AGSSP), a novel paradigm
that explicitly guides representation learning through anomaly priors. AGSSP
employs a two-stage framework: (1) it first pretrains the model's backbone by
distilling knowledge from anomaly maps, encouraging the network to capture
defect-salient features; (2) it then pretrains the detector using pseudo-defect
boxes derived from these maps, aligning it with localization tasks. To enable
this, we develop a knowledge-enhanced method to generate high-quality anomaly
maps and collect a large-scale industrial dataset of 120,000 images.
Additionally, we present two small-scale, pixel-level labeled metallic surface
defect datasets for validation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AGSSP
consistently enhances performance across various settings, achieving up to a
10\% improvement in mAP@0.5 and 11.4\% in mAP@0.5:0.95 compared to
ImageNet-based models. All code, pretrained models, and datasets are publicly
available at https://clovermini.github.io/AGSSP-Dev/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个音频驱动的通用逼真头像合成方法，结合了人物无关的语音模型和新型的通用头部头像先验（UHAP），能够同时处理几何变形和外观变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要将音频特征映射到几何变形，而忽略了音频相关的外观变化。需要一种能够同时捕捉几何和外观变化的通用头像合成方法。

Method: 使用跨身份多视角视频训练UHAP，通过单目编码器进行轻量级个性化，将原始音频直接映射到UHAP潜在表达空间，该空间同时编码几何和外观变化。

Result: 该方法能够生成高度逼真的头像，具有精确的唇部同步和细腻的表情细节，在唇部同步准确性、图像质量和感知真实感方面优于现有几何方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个可泛化的音频驱动头像模型，能够进行详细的外观建模和渲染，在多个评估指标上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce the first method for audio-driven universal photorealistic
avatar synthesis, combining a person-agnostic speech model with our novel
Universal Head Avatar Prior (UHAP). UHAP is trained on cross-identity
multi-view videos. In particular, our UHAP is supervised with neutral scan
data, enabling it to capture the identity-specific details at high fidelity. In
contrast to previous approaches, which predominantly map audio features to
geometric deformations only while ignoring audio-dependent appearance
variations, our universal speech model directly maps raw audio inputs into the
UHAP latent expression space. This expression space inherently encodes, both,
geometric and appearance variations. For efficient personalization to new
subjects, we employ a monocular encoder, which enables lightweight regression
of dynamic expression variations across video frames. By accounting for these
expression-dependent changes, it enables the subsequent model fine-tuning stage
to focus exclusively on capturing the subject's global appearance and geometry.
Decoding these audio-driven expression codes via UHAP generates highly
realistic avatars with precise lip synchronization and nuanced expressive
details, such as eyebrow movement, gaze shifts, and realistic mouth interior
appearance as well as motion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method
is not only the first generalizable audio-driven avatar model that can account
for detailed appearance modeling and rendering, but it also outperforms
competing (geometry-only) methods across metrics measuring lip-sync accuracy,
quantitative image quality, and perceptual realism.

Motivation: 树突棘是大脑中兴奋性突触的关键结构组成部分，其大小可作为突触效能的指标。然而，大规模分析树突棘的结构动态在3D+时间显微镜数据中仍然具有挑战性且劳动密集。

Method: 结合了基于transformer的检测模块、集成空间特征的深度跟踪组件、利用空间一致性跨时间关联3D棘的时间跟踪模块，以及量化生物相关棘特征的特征提取单元。

Conclusion: 建立了一个可扩展的端到端树突棘动态分析基准，发布了数据、代码和预训练权重以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Dendritic spines are key structural components of excitatory synapses in the
brain. Given the size of dendritic spines provides a proxy for synaptic
efficacy, their detection and tracking across time is important for studies of
the neural basis of learning and memory. Despite their relevance, large-scale
analyses of the structural dynamics of dendritic spines in 3D+time microscopy
data remain challenging and labor-intense. Here, we present a modular machine
learning-based pipeline designed to automate the detection, time-tracking, and
feature extraction of dendritic spines in volumes chronically recorded with
two-photon microscopy. Our approach tackles the challenges posed by biological
data by combining a transformer-based detection module, a depth-tracking
component that integrates spatial features, a time-tracking module to associate
3D spines across time by leveraging spatial consistency, and a feature
extraction unit that quantifies biologically relevant spine properties. We
validate our method on open-source labeled spine data, and on two complementary
annotated datasets that we publish alongside this work: one for detection and
depth-tracking, and one for time-tracking, which, to the best of our knowledge,
is the first data of this kind. To encourage future research, we release our
data, code, and pre-trained weights at
https://github.com/pamelaosuna/SynapFlow, establishing a baseline for scalable,
end-to-end analysis of dendritic spine dynamics.

<details>

Motivation: 深度学习依赖大量标注数据，但在实际场景中标注数据稀缺。视觉语言模型和预训练视觉模型为解决这一问题提供了可能

Method: 采用基于置信度的伪标签策略，在测试数据上直接训练轻量级分类器。VLM识别高置信度样本，预训练视觉模型增强其视觉表示，通过迭代训练捕获互补的语义和视觉线索

Result: 在十个不同数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于基线零样本方法

Conclusion: 该方法无需VLM微调或大型语言模型，仅依赖视觉模型减少对语义表示的依赖，实现了有效的零样本分类

Abstract: While deep learning, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs), has significantly advanced classification
performance, its typical reliance on extensive annotated datasets presents a
major obstacle in many practical scenarios where such data is scarce.
Vision-language models (VLMs) and transfer learning with pre-trained visual
models appear as promising techniques to deal with this problem. This paper
proposes a novel zero-shot image classification framework that combines a VLM
and a pre-trained visual model within a self-learning cycle. Requiring only the
set of class names and no labeled training data, our method utilizes a
confidence-based pseudo-labeling strategy to train a lightweight classifier
directly on the test data, enabling dynamic adaptation. The VLM identifies
high-confidence samples, and the pre-trained visual model enhances their visual
representations. These enhanced features then iteratively train the classifier,
allowing the system to capture complementary semantic and visual cues without
supervision. Notably, our approach avoids VLM fine-tuning and the use of large
language models, relying on the visual-only model to reduce the dependence on
semantic representation. Experimental evaluations on ten diverse datasets
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the baseline zero-shot method.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了MirrorScene3D数据集和ReflectiveGS方法，用于解决含镜面环境中的3D重建和新视角合成问题，通过利用镜面反射作为补充视角来提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如NeRF和3DGS在含镜面场景中性能下降，主要关注镜面表面的对称映射而忽略了镜面反射携带的丰富信息，这些反射可以提供补充视角来填补缺失细节。

Method: 提出了ReflectiveGS方法，基于3D高斯泼溅技术，将镜面反射作为补充视角而非简单的对称伪影，从而增强场景几何并恢复缺失细节。

Result: 在MirrorScene3D数据集上的实验表明，ReflectiveGS在SSIM、PSNR、LPIPS指标和训练速度上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ReflectiveGS为镜面丰富环境中的3D重建设立了新的基准，证明了利用镜面反射作为补充视角的有效性。

Abstract: Mirror-containing environments pose unique challenges for 3D reconstruction
and novel view synthesis (NVS), as reflective surfaces introduce view-dependent
distortions and inconsistencies. While cutting-edge methods such as Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) excel in typical
scenes, their performance deteriorates in the presence of mirrors. Existing
solutions mainly focus on handling mirror surfaces through symmetry mapping but
often overlook the rich information carried by mirror reflections. These
reflections offer complementary perspectives that can fill in absent details
and significantly enhance reconstruction quality. To advance 3D reconstruction
in mirror-rich environments, we present MirrorScene3D, a comprehensive dataset
featuring diverse indoor scenes, 1256 high-quality images, and annotated mirror
masks, providing a benchmark for evaluating reconstruction methods in
reflective settings. Building on this, we propose ReflectiveGS, an extension of
3D Gaussian Splatting that utilizes mirror reflections as complementary
viewpoints rather than simple symmetry artifacts, enhancing scene geometry and
recovering absent details. Experiments on MirrorScene3D show that
ReflectiveGaussian outperforms existing methods in SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and
training speed, setting a new benchmark for 3D reconstruction in mirror-rich
environments.

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够有效定位胆道，但具体性能指标未在摘要中详细说明

Conclusion: 深度学习技术有望改善术中胆管可视化，减少胆管损伤风险，同时需要考虑相关的伦理问题

Abstract: Cholecystectomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in
gastrointestinal surgery, and the laparoscopic approach is the gold standard
for symptomatic cholecystolithiasis and acute cholecystitis. In addition to the
advantages of a significantly faster recovery and better cosmetic results, the
laparoscopic approach bears a higher risk of bile duct injury, which has a
significant impact on quality of life and survival. To avoid bile duct injury,
it is essential to improve the intraoperative visualization of the bile duct.
This work aims to address this problem by leveraging a deep-learning approach
for the localization of the biliary tract from white-light images acquired
during the surgical procedures. To this end, the construction and annotation of
an image database to train the Yolo detection algorithm has been employed.
Besides classical data augmentation techniques, the paper proposes Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) for the generation of a synthetic portion of the
training dataset. Experimental results have been discussed along with ethical
considerations.

Motivation: 解决电子显微镜图像中多器官实例分割的标注效率问题，利用SAM的提示机制但克服其需要为每个实例提供提示的限制

Method: 结合辅助中心点检测任务和提示引导对比学习，支持全点、稀疏点或无点提示的灵活训练和测试

Result: 在多个挑战性基准测试中优于现有的UDA、WDA和基于SAM的方法

Conclusion: Prompt-DAS框架在域自适应分割任务中表现出色，提供了灵活高效的解决方案

Abstract: Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) of numerous organelle instances from
large-scale electron microscopy (EM) is a promising way to enable
annotation-efficient learning. Inspired by SAM, we propose a promptable
multitask framework, namely Prompt-DAS, which is flexible enough to utilize any
number of point prompts during the adaptation training stage and testing stage.
Thus, with varying prompt configurations, Prompt-DAS can perform unsupervised
domain adaptation (UDA) and weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA), as well
as interactive segmentation during testing. Unlike the foundation model SAM,
which necessitates a prompt for each individual object instance, Prompt-DAS is
only trained on a small dataset and can utilize full points on all instances,
sparse points on partial instances, or even no points at all, facilitated by
the incorporation of an auxiliary center-point detection task. Moreover, a
novel prompt-guided contrastive learning is proposed to enhance discriminative
feature learning. Comprehensive experiments conducted on challenging benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over existing UDA, WDA,
and SAM-based approaches.

Abstract: Chain of thought reasoning has demonstrated remarkable success in large
language models, yet its adaptation to vision-language reasoning remains an
open challenge with unclear best practices. Existing attempts typically employ
reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform
fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to
evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we
delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling
assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective
reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We
present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the
step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement
learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong
baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language
benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and
ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing
properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a
baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex
multimodal reasoning. Our dataset, PRM, and code will be available at

Conclusion: 该方法可作为食物图像标注的加速工具，或集成到食物营养追踪应用中，有效降低标注成本

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach
for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and
promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention
mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation
maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable
for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained
exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level
annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the
SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in
combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The
methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of
2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for
the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to
accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food
and nutrition tracking applications.

TL;DR: DyL-UNet是一种基于动态学习的时序一致性U-Net分割架构，旨在实现时间稳定且精确的超声心动图分割，解决帧间分割抖动问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图容易变形和产生斑点噪声，导致帧间分割抖动。即使单帧分割精度高，时间不稳定性也会削弱功能估计并影响临床解释。

Method: 提出DyL-UNet框架，通过动态学习构建Echo-Dynamics Graph（EDG）提取视频动态信息。采用多个基于Swin-Transformer的编码器-解码器分支处理单帧图像，并在跳跃连接中引入Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention（CPDA）机制，利用EDG编码的动态特征和心脏相位线索来增强时序一致性。

Conclusion: DyL-UNet为自动化临床超声心动图提供了可靠的解决方案，能够实现时间稳定且精确的分割。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cardiac anatomy in echocardiography is essential for
cardiovascular diagnosis and treatment. Yet echocardiography is prone to
deformation and speckle noise, causing frame-to-frame segmentation jitter. Even
with high accuracy in single-frame segmentation, temporal instability can
weaken functional estimates and impair clinical interpretability. To address
these issues, we propose DyL-UNet, a dynamic learning-based temporal
consistency U-Net segmentation architecture designed to achieve temporally
stable and precise echocardiographic segmentation. The framework constructs an
Echo-Dynamics Graph (EDG) through dynamic learning to extract dynamic
information from videos. DyL-UNet incorporates multiple Swin-Transformer-based
encoder-decoder branches for processing single-frame images. It further
introduces Cardiac Phase-Dynamics Attention (CPDA) at the skip connections,
which uses EDG-encoded dynamic features and cardiac-phase cues to enforce
temporal consistency during segmentation. Extensive experiments on the CAMUS
and EchoNet-Dynamic datasets demonstrate that DyL-UNet maintains segmentation
accuracy comparable to existing methods while achieving superior temporal
consistency, providing a reliable solution for automated clinical
echocardiography.

Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在稀疏视图设置下性能急剧下降，现有方法使用扩散模型修复损坏的渲染作为伪真值进行优化，但计算成本高昂。

Method: 提出WaveletGaussian框架，将扩散过程转移到小波域：仅在低分辨率LL子带应用扩散，高频子带使用轻量网络优化；并提出高效的在线随机掩码策略替代低效的留一法策略。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360和OmniObject3D两个基准数据集上的实验表明，WaveletGaussian在保持竞争性渲染质量的同时，大幅减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: WaveletGaussian通过小波域扩散和高效训练策略，实现了稀疏视图3D高斯重建的高效优化，在质量和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a powerful representation for
image-based object reconstruction, yet its performance drops sharply in
sparse-view settings. Prior works address this limitation by employing
diffusion models to repair corrupted renders, subsequently using them as pseudo
ground truths for later optimization. While effective, such approaches incur
heavy computation from the diffusion fine-tuning and repair steps. We present
WaveletGaussian, a framework for more efficient sparse-view 3D Gaussian object
reconstruction. Our key idea is to shift diffusion into the wavelet domain:
diffusion is applied only to the low-resolution LL subband, while
high-frequency subbands are refined with a lightweight network. We further
propose an efficient online random masking strategy to curate training pairs
for diffusion fine-tuning, replacing the commonly used, but inefficient,
leave-one-out strategy. Experiments across two benchmark datasets, Mip-NeRF 360
and OmniObject3D, show WaveletGaussian achieves competitive rendering quality
while substantially reducing training time.

Abstract: Sa2VA is a recent model for language-guided dense grounding in images and
video that achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple segmentation
benchmarks and that has become widely popular. However, we found that Sa2VA
does not perform according to its full potential for referring video object
segmentation tasks. We identify inconsistencies between training and inference
procedures as the key factor holding it back. To mitigate this issue, we
propose an improved version of Sa2VA, Sa2VA-i, that rectifies these issues and
improves the results. In fact, Sa2VA-i sets a new state of the art for multiple
video benchmarks and achieves improvements of up to +11.6 J&F on MeViS, +1.4 on
Ref-YT-VOS, +3.3 on Ref-DAVIS and +4.1 on ReVOS using the same Sa2VA
checkpoints. With our fixes, the Sa2VA-i-1B model even performs on par with the
original Sa2VA-26B model on the MeViS benchmark. We hope that this work will
show the importance of seemingly trivial implementation details and that it
will provide valuable insights for the referring video segmentation field. We

Abstract: Multi-spectral imagery plays a crucial role in diverse Remote Sensing
applications including land-use classification, environmental monitoring and
urban planning. These images are widely adopted because their additional
spectral bands correlate strongly with physical materials on the ground, such
as ice, water, and vegetation. This allows for more accurate identification,
and their public availability from missions, such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat,
only adds to their value. Currently, the automatic analysis of such data is
predominantly managed through machine learning models specifically trained for
multi-spectral input, which are costly to train and support. Furthermore,
although providing a lot of utility for Remote Sensing, such additional inputs
cannot be used with powerful generalist large multimodal models, which are
capable of solving many visual problems, but are not able to understand
specialized multi-spectral signals.
  To address this, we propose a training-free approach which introduces new
multi-spectral data in a Zero-Shot-only mode, as inputs to generalist
multimodal models, trained on RGB-only inputs. Our approach leverages the
multimodal models' understanding of the visual space, and proposes to adapt to
inputs to that space, and to inject domain-specific information as instructions
into the model. We exemplify this idea with the Gemini2.5 model and observe
strong Zero-Shot performance gains of the approach on popular Remote Sensing
benchmarks for land cover and land use classification and demonstrate the easy
adaptability of Gemini2.5 to new inputs. These results highlight the potential
for geospatial professionals, working with non-standard specialized inputs, to
easily leverage powerful multimodal models, such as Gemini2.5, to accelerate
their work, benefiting from their rich reasoning and contextual capabilities,
grounded in the specialized sensor data.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了多模态大语言模型在交通事故检测中的零样本能力，通过集成视觉分析技术提升模型性能，在DeepAccident数据集上验证了方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通事故检测对公共安全至关重要，但缺乏多样化的基础设施摄像头事故数据集。研究旨在利用MLLMs的零样本能力，减少对大量标注数据的依赖。

Method: 使用CARLA模拟的DeepAccident数据集，评估Gemini 1.5/2.0、Gemma 3和Pixtral等MLLMs的零样本性能，并集成YOLO、Deep SORT和SAM等视觉分析技术增强提示效果。

Result: Pixtral表现最佳（F1-score 0.71，召回率83%），Gemini模型通过增强提示精度提升至90%但F1和召回率下降，Gemma 3性能最平衡。

Conclusion: MLLMs与先进视觉分析技术结合在自动化交通监控系统中具有巨大应用潜力，能够有效提升事故检测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Traffic safety remains a critical global concern, with timely and accurate
accident detection essential for hazard reduction and rapid emergency response.
Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for
continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of acci-
dents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot
capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and
describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus
minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include:
(1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA,
explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based
accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance
analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in acci- dent
identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3)
Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object
detection, Deep SORT for multi- object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for
instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and
explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an
F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with
enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and
recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal
metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of
integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their
applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.

TL;DR: Track-On2是一个基于Transformer的在线长期点跟踪模型，通过架构改进、内存优化和合成训练策略，在实时流式应用中实现高性能的点跟踪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长期点跟踪问题，需要在视频帧间一致识别点，应对显著的外观变化、运动和遮挡，特别针对在线实时应用场景。

Method: 扩展Track-On模型，采用因果处理框架，通过内存机制保持时间一致性，进行粗粒度补丁分类后细化，系统研究合成训练对内存行为的影响。

Result: 在五个合成和真实世界基准测试中达到最先进水平，超越现有在线跟踪器甚至利用双向上下文的离线方法。

Conclusion: 基于因果内存架构和纯合成数据训练的方法为现实世界点跟踪提供了可扩展的有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of long-term point tracking, which
requires consistent identification of points across video frames under
significant appearance changes, motion, and occlusion. We target the online
setting, i.e. tracking points frame-by-frame, making it suitable for real-time
and streaming applications. We extend our prior model Track-On into Track-On2,
a simple and efficient transformer-based model for online long-term tracking.
Track-On2 improves both performance and efficiency through architectural
refinements, more effective use of memory, and improved synthetic training
strategies. Unlike prior approaches that rely on full-sequence access or
iterative updates, our model processes frames causally and maintains temporal
coherence via a memory mechanism, which is key to handling drift and occlusions
without requiring future frames. At inference, we perform coarse patch-level
classification followed by refinement. Beyond architecture, we systematically
study synthetic training setups and their impact on memory behavior, showing
how they shape temporal robustness over long sequences. Through comprehensive
experiments, Track-On2 achieves state-of-the-art results across five synthetic
and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior online trackers and even strong
offline methods that exploit bidirectional context. These results highlight the
effectiveness of causal, memory-based architectures trained purely on synthetic
data as scalable solutions for real-world point tracking. Project page:

Conclusion: NeuCODEX使脉冲神经网络在资源受限环境中实现实用、高性能部署。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer significant potential for enabling
energy-efficient intelligence at the edge. However, performing full SNN
inference at the edge can be challenging due to the latency and energy
constraints arising from fixed and high timestep overheads. Edge-cloud
co-inference systems present a promising solution, but their deployment is
often hindered by high latency and feature transmission costs. To address these
issues, we introduce NeuCODEX, a neuromorphic co-inference architecture that
jointly optimizes both spatial and temporal redundancy. NeuCODEX incorporates a
learned spike-driven compression module to reduce data transmission and employs
a dynamic early-exit mechanism to adaptively terminate inference based on
output confidence. We evaluated NeuCODEX on both static images (CIFAR10 and
Caltech) and neuromorphic event streams (CIFAR10-DVS and N-Caltech). To
demonstrate practicality, we prototyped NeuCODEX on ResNet-18 and VGG-16
backbones in a real edge-to-cloud testbed. Our proposed system reduces data
transfer by up to 2048x and edge energy consumption by over 90%, while reducing
end-to-end latency by up to 3x compared to edge-only inference, all with a
negligible accuracy drop of less than 2%. In doing so, NeuCODEX enables
practical, high-performance SNN deployment in resource-constrained
environments.

Conclusion: 通过引入视觉基础模型的先验知识和场景对应关系，显著提升了自监督立体匹配在恶劣天气条件下的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised stereo matching methods have made significant
progress, but their performance significantly degrades under adverse weather
conditions such as night, rain, and fog. We identify two primary weaknesses
contributing to this performance degradation. First, adverse weather introduces
noise and reduces visibility, making CNN-based feature extractors struggle with
degraded regions like reflective and textureless areas. Second, these degraded
regions can disrupt accurate pixel correspondences, leading to ineffective
supervision based on the photometric consistency assumption. To address these
challenges, we propose injecting robust priors derived from the visual
foundation model into the CNN-based feature extractor to improve feature
representation under adverse weather conditions. We then introduce scene
correspondence priors to construct robust supervisory signals rather than
relying solely on the photometric consistency assumption. Specifically, we
create synthetic stereo datasets with realistic weather degradations. These
datasets feature clear and adverse image pairs that maintain the same semantic
context and disparity, preserving the scene correspondence property. With this
knowledge, we propose a robust self-supervised training paradigm, consisting of
two key steps: robust self-supervised scene correspondence learning and adverse
weather distillation. Both steps aim to align underlying scene results from
clean and adverse image pairs, thus improving model disparity estimation under
adverse weather effects. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
and versatility of our proposed solution, which outperforms existing
state-of-the-art self-supervised methods. Codes are available at

Motivation: 结直肠癌是致命疾病，始于结肠内壁息肉生长。传统结肠镜手动检测存在不一致性和漏检问题，需要更准确、实时的AI辅助诊断方案。

Method: 使用YOLO-based息肉检测管道，结合M2IoU损失函数、多样化数据增强技术和负样本训练，模拟真实临床场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在息肉大小和精确定位检测方面表现出鲁棒性，具有临床应用的潜力，可用于AI辅助结直肠癌筛查。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC), a lethal disease, begins with the growth of abnormal
mucosal cell proliferation called polyps in the inner wall of the colon. When
left undetected, polyps can become malignant tumors. Colonoscopy is the
standard procedure for detecting polyps, as it enables direct visualization and
removal of suspicious lesions. Manual detection by colonoscopy can be
inconsistent and is subject to oversight. Therefore, object detection based on
deep learning offers a better solution for a more accurate and real-time
diagnosis during colonoscopy. In this work, we propose YOLO-LAN, a YOLO-based
polyp detection pipeline, trained using M2IoU loss, versatile data
augmentations and negative data to replicate real clinical situations. Our
pipeline outperformed existing methods for the Kvasir-seg and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp
datasets, achieving mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9619, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8599 with YOLOv12
and mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9540, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8487 with YOLOv8 on the Kvasir-seg
dataset. The significant increase is achieved in mAP$_{50:95}$ score, showing
the precision of polyp detection. We show robustness based on polyp size and
precise location detection, making it clinically relevant in AI-assisted
colorectal screening.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM通过序列化图像处理视觉信息，与人类视觉的并行性存在差异，且内部机制不透明，阻碍了深入理解和架构创新。

Method: 将视觉处理分解为物体识别（通过文本标记图分析）和空间感知（理论推导和实验验证位置表示的几何结构），并提出基于即插即用视觉解码器的指令无关标记压缩算法和RoPE缩放技术。

Result: 验证了VLM内部处理机制的分析，物体识别呈现从浅层到深层的两阶段过程，空间感知具有特定的几何结构。

Conclusion: 工作深化了对VLM内部机制的理解，为设计更强大的未来架构提供了清晰原则。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a variety of real-world tasks. However, existing VLMs typically process visual
information by serializing images, a method that diverges significantly from
the parallel nature of human vision. Moreover, their opaque internal mechanisms
hinder both deeper understanding and architectural innovation. Inspired by the
dual-stream hypothesis of human vision, which distinguishes the "what" and
"where" pathways, we deconstruct the visual processing in VLMs into object
recognition and spatial perception for separate study. For object recognition,
we convert images into text token maps and find that the model's perception of
image content unfolds as a two-stage process from shallow to deep layers,
beginning with attribute recognition and culminating in semantic
disambiguation. For spatial perception, we theoretically derive and empirically
verify the geometric structure underlying the positional representation in
VLMs. Based on these findings, we introduce an instruction-agnostic token
compression algorithm based on a plug-and-play visual decoder to improve
decoding efficiency, and a RoPE scaling technique to enhance spatial reasoning.
Through rigorous experiments, our work validates these analyses, offering a
deeper understanding of VLM internals and providing clear principles for
designing more capable future architectures.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需视觉编码器的文本到文本检索方法，通过使用VLLM生成的结构化图像描述替代原始图像，解决了传统视觉语言模型中的模态鸿沟问题，并在多个基准测试中达到最先进的零样本性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）存在浅层语言理解、模态鸿沟、计算成本高和隐私问题等局限性。本文旨在通过消除视觉编码器来克服这些问题。

Method: 采用文本到文本检索范式，使用VLLM生成的结构化图像描述代替原始图像，仅需少量GPU进行几小时的校准训练。

Result: 该方法显著减少了模态鸿沟，提高了组合性，在短长文本查询上表现更好，且模型参数仅需0.3B就能在多个检索和组合性基准上达到最先进的零样本性能。

Conclusion: 视觉自由的检索方法不仅性能优越，还提供了更隐私友好的替代方案，证明了在检索任务中视觉编码器并非必要。

Abstract: Contrastively-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have
become the standard approach for learning discriminative vision-language
representations. However, these models often exhibit shallow language
understanding, manifesting bag-of-words behaviour. These limitations are
reinforced by their dual-encoder design, which induces a modality gap.
Additionally, the reliance on vast web-collected data corpora for training
makes the process computationally expensive and introduces significant privacy
concerns. To address these limitations, in this work, we challenge the
necessity of vision encoders for retrieval tasks by introducing a vision-free,
single-encoder retrieval pipeline. Departing from the traditional text-to-image
retrieval paradigm, we migrate to a text-to-text paradigm with the assistance
of VLLM-generated structured image descriptions. We demonstrate that this
paradigm shift has significant advantages, including a substantial reduction of
the modality gap, improved compositionality, and better performance on short
and long caption queries, all attainable with only a few hours of calibration
on two GPUs. Additionally, substituting raw images with textual descriptions
introduces a more privacy-friendly alternative for retrieval. To further assess
generalisation and address some of the shortcomings of prior compositionality
benchmarks, we release two benchmarks derived from Flickr30k and COCO,
containing diverse compositional queries made of short captions, which we coin
subFlickr and subCOCO. Our vision-free retriever matches and often surpasses
traditional multimodal models. Importantly, our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple retrieval and
compositionality benchmarks, with models as small as 0.3B parameters. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对比视觉语言模型在绑定视觉和文本信息方面取得显著进展，但理解长而密集的标题仍然是一个开放挑战。作者假设组合性（推理对象-属性绑定和对象间关系的能力）是理解长标题的关键。

Method: 训练和评估了一系列针对组合性和长标题理解能力的模型，研究了不同训练策略（如冻结位置嵌入）和数据质量对性能的影响。

Result: 发现组合性训练能提高长标题检索性能，长标题训练也能促进组合性，但这些增益对数据质量和模型设计敏感。高质量的长标题数据训练可以在两个任务上都取得强性能。

Conclusion: 组合性理解和长标题理解是相互交织的能力，可以通过在密集、接地气的描述上进行训练来共同学习，为改进VLM泛化提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
binding visual and textual information, but understanding long, dense captions
remains an open challenge. We hypothesize that compositionality, the capacity
to reason about object-attribute bindings and inter-object relationships, is
key to understanding longer captions. In this paper, we investigate the
interaction between compositionality and long-caption understanding, asking
whether training for one property enhances the other. We train and evaluate a
range of models that target each of these capabilities. Our results reveal a
bidirectional relationship: compositional training improves performance on
long-caption retrieval, and training on long captions promotes
compositionality. However, these gains are sensitive to data quality and model
design. We find that training on poorly structured captions, or with limited
parameter updates, fails to support generalization. Likewise, strategies that
aim at retaining general alignment, such as freezing positional embeddings, do
not improve compositional understanding. Overall, we find that compositional
understanding and long-caption understanding are intertwined capabilities that
can be jointly learned through training on dense, grounded descriptions.
Despite these challenges, we show that models trained on high-quality,
long-caption data can achieve strong performance in both tasks, offering
practical guidance for improving VLM generalization.

Conclusion: 合成数据结合有限手动标注和生成模型的跨域转换能显著提升复杂野外环境中多模态图像的语义分割性能

Abstract: Accurate plant segmentation in thermal imagery remains a significant
challenge for high throughput field phenotyping, particularly in outdoor
environments where low contrast between plants and weeds and frequent
occlusions hinder performance. To address this, we present a framework that
leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and
GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal
images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures
of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop
and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as
five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using
various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few
labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the
weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline.
Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using
CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results
demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and
cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost
segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.

Abstract: Evaluation of hydrocephalus in children is challenging, and the related
research is limited by a lack of publicly available, expert-annotated datasets,
particularly those with segmentation of the choroid plexus. To address this, we
present HyKid, an open-source dataset from 48 pediatric patients with
hydrocephalus. 3D MRIs were provided with 1mm isotropic resolution, which was
reconstructed from routine low-resolution images using a slice-to-volume
algorithm. Manually corrected segmentations of brain tissues, including white
matter, grey matter, lateral ventricle, external CSF, and the choroid plexus,
were provided by an experienced neurologist. Additionally, structured data was
extracted from clinical radiology reports using a Retrieval-Augmented
Generation framework. The strong correlation between choroid plexus volume and
total CSF volume provided a potential biomarker for hydrocephalus evaluation,
achieving excellent performance in a predictive model (AUC = 0.87). The
proposed HyKid dataset provided a high-quality benchmark for neuroimaging
algorithms development, and it revealed the choroid plexus-related features in
hydrocephalus assessments. Our datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: With the widespread deployment of dashcams and advancements in computer
vision, developing accident prediction models from the dashcam perspective has
become critical for proactive safety interventions. However, two key challenges
persist: modeling feature-level interactions among traffic participants (often
occluded in dashcam views) and capturing complex, asynchronous multi-temporal
behavioral cues preceding accidents. To deal with these two challenges, a
Multi-scale Feature Interaction Network (MsFIN) is proposed for early-stage
accident anticipation from dashcam videos. MsFIN has three layers for
multi-scale feature aggregation, temporal feature processing and multi-scale
feature post fusion, respectively. For multi-scale feature aggregation, a
Multi-scale Module is designed to extract scene representations at short-term,
mid-term and long-term temporal scales. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture
is leveraged to facilitate comprehensive feature interactions. Temporal feature
processing captures the sequential evolution of scene and object features under
causal constraints. In the multi-scale feature post fusion stage, the network
fuses scene and object features across multiple temporal scales to generate a
comprehensive risk representation. Experiments on DAD and DADA datasets show
that MsFIN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models with single-scale
feature extraction in both prediction correctness and earliness. Ablation
studies validate the effectiveness of each module in MsFIN, highlighting how
the network achieves superior performance through multi-scale feature fusion
and contextual interaction modeling.

Abstract: The rise of realistic digital face generation and manipulation poses
significant social risks. The primary challenge lies in the rapid and diverse
evolution of generation techniques, which often outstrip the detection
capabilities of existing models. To defend against the ever-evolving new types
of forgery, we need to enable our model to quickly adapt to new domains with
limited computation and data while avoiding forgetting previously learned
forgery types. In this work, we posit that genuine facial samples are abundant
and relatively stable in acquisition methods, while forgery faces continuously
evolve with the iteration of manipulation techniques. Given the practical
infeasibility of exhaustively collecting all forgery variants, we frame face
forgery detection as a continual learning problem and allow the model to
develop as new forgery types emerge. Specifically, we employ a Developmental
Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture that uses LoRA models as its individual
experts. These experts are organized into two groups: a Real-LoRA to learn and
refine knowledge of real faces, and multiple Fake-LoRAs to capture incremental
information from different forgery types. To prevent catastrophic forgetting,
we ensure that the learning direction of Fake-LoRAs is orthogonal to the
established subspace. Moreover, we integrate orthogonal gradients into the
orthogonal loss of Fake-LoRAs, preventing gradient interference throughout the
training process of each task. Experimental results under both the datasets and
manipulation types incremental protocols demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method.

TL;DR: 本文提出了概念化视频相似度估计（ConViS）任务，通过预定义的关键语义概念计算可解释的相似度分数，实现人类化的视频相似度推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频相似度评估通常依赖全局相似度分数，无法像人类那样从不同角度（如动作、地点等）进行多维度比较。大型多模态模型为利用自然语言进行视频比较任务提供了新机会。

Method: 1. 提出ConViS任务框架，基于预定义语义概念计算视频对的可解释相似度分数；2. 构建ConViS-Bench基准数据集，包含多领域视频对及概念级相似度标注；3. 对多种先进模型进行基准测试，分析其与人类判断的一致性。

Conclusion: ConViS任务能够实现人类化的视频相似度推理，支持概念条件视频检索等新应用。该研究为多维度视频比较提供了新思路，推动了语言驱动视频理解的发展。

Abstract: What does it mean for two videos to be similar? Videos may appear similar
when judged by the actions they depict, yet entirely different if evaluated
based on the locations where they were filmed. While humans naturally compare
videos by taking different aspects into account, this ability has not been
thoroughly studied and presents a challenge for models that often depend on
broad global similarity scores. Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) with video
understanding capabilities open new opportunities for leveraging natural
language in comparative video tasks. We introduce Concept-based Video
Similarity estimation (ConViS), a novel task that compares pairs of videos by
computing interpretable similarity scores across a predefined set of key
semantic concepts. ConViS allows for human-like reasoning about video
similarity and enables new applications such as concept-conditioned video
retrieval. To support this task, we also introduce ConViS-Bench, a new
benchmark comprising carefully annotated video pairs spanning multiple domains.
Each pair comes with concept-level similarity scores and textual descriptions
of both differences and similarities. Additionally, we benchmark several
state-of-the-art models on ConViS, providing insights into their alignment with
human judgments. Our results reveal significant performance differences on
ConViS, indicating that some concepts present greater challenges for estimating
video similarity. We believe that ConViS-Bench will serve as a valuable
resource for advancing research in language-driven video understanding.

Method: 结合密集运动标记化和对抗性精炼的VQ-GAN框架，消除重建伪影如运动模糊和时间错位。

Result: 在CMU Panoptic数据集上，方法比dVAE基线在SSIM指标上提升9.31%，时间不稳定性降低37.1%。2D运动可用128个标记词汇表表示，3D运动需要1024个标记代码本。

Abstract: Continuous human motion understanding remains a core challenge in computer
vision due to its high dimensionality and inherent redundancy. Efficient
compression and representation are crucial for analyzing complex motion
dynamics. In this work, we introduce an adversarially-refined VQ-GAN framework
with dense motion tokenization for compressing spatio-temporal heatmaps while
preserving the fine-grained traces of human motion. Our approach combines dense
motion tokenization with adversarial refinement, which eliminates
reconstruction artifacts like motion smearing and temporal misalignment
observed in non-adversarial baselines. Our experiments on the CMU Panoptic
dataset provide conclusive evidence of our method's superiority, outperforming
the dVAE baseline by 9.31% SSIM and reducing temporal instability by 37.1%.
Furthermore, our dense tokenization strategy enables a novel analysis of motion
complexity, revealing that 2D motion can be optimally represented with a
compact 128-token vocabulary, while 3D motion's complexity demands a much
larger 1024-token codebook for faithful reconstruction. These results establish
practical deployment feasibility across diverse motion analysis applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图放射组学学习（GrRAiL）描述符，用于在临床MRI扫描中表征病变内异质性，通过图论方法量化空间关联，在区分恶性肿瘤与混淆病理方面显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统放射组学方法在CT/MRI上聚合整个感兴趣区域的特征，忽略了复杂空间关系，难以可靠区分恶性肿瘤与混淆病理。

Method: GrRAiL方法：（1）使用逐体素放射组学测量识别亚区域聚类；（2）计算图论指标量化聚类间空间关联，生成加权图编码高阶空间关系。

Result: 在947名受试者的多中心评估中，GrRAiL在三个应用场景均显著优于现有方法：胶质母细胞瘤（测试准确率78%，提升>10%）、脑转移瘤（74%，提升>13%）、胰腺IPMN风险分层（75%，提升>10%）。

Conclusion: GrRAiL能够可靠捕捉病变内异质性，有效区分恶性肿瘤与混淆病理，在多中心临床评估中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: A significant challenge in solid tumors is reliably distinguishing
confounding pathologies from malignant neoplasms on routine imaging. While
radiomics methods seek surrogate markers of lesion heterogeneity on CT/MRI,
many aggregate features across the region of interest (ROI) and miss complex
spatial relationships among varying intensity compositions. We present a new
Graph-Radiomic Learning (GrRAiL) descriptor for characterizing intralesional
heterogeneity (ILH) on clinical MRI scans. GrRAiL (1) identifies clusters of
sub-regions using per-voxel radiomic measurements, then (2) computes
graph-theoretic metrics to quantify spatial associations among clusters. The
resulting weighted graphs encode higher-order spatial relationships within the
ROI, aiming to reliably capture ILH and disambiguate confounding pathologies
from malignancy. To assess efficacy and clinical feasibility, GrRAiL was
evaluated in n=947 subjects spanning three use cases: differentiating tumor
recurrence from radiation effects in glioblastoma (GBM; n=106) and brain
metastasis (n=233), and stratifying pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous
neoplasms (IPMNs) into no+low vs high risk (n=608). In a multi-institutional
setting, GrRAiL consistently outperformed state-of-the-art baselines - Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs), textural radiomics, and intensity-graph analysis. In
GBM, cross-validation (CV) and test accuracies for recurrence vs
pseudo-progression were 89% and 78% with >10% test-accuracy gains over
comparators. In brain metastasis, CV and test accuracies for recurrence vs
radiation necrosis were 84% and 74% (>13% improvement). For IPMN risk
stratification, CV and test accuracies were 84% and 75%, showing >10%
improvement.

TL;DR: CLOPS是第一个仅使用自我中心视觉感知环境和导航的人类化身系统，通过将低级运动技能学习与高级视觉控制解耦，实现了更接近人类行为的运动生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的人类运动生成方法忽视了感知与运动的相互依赖关系，使用的感知方式与人类差异很大。作者认为生成人类化行为需要人类化的感知方式。

Method: 采用解耦学习方法：首先在大规模运动捕捉数据集上训练运动先验模型，然后使用Q学习训练策略，将自我中心视觉输入映射到运动先验的高级控制命令。

Result: 实验证明自我中心视觉能够产生人类化的运动特征，例如化身会根据视觉场中的障碍物调整行走路径以避免碰撞。

Conclusion: 为化身配备人类化传感器（特别是自我中心视觉）有望训练出行为更像人类的化身。

Abstract: The way we perceive the world fundamentally shapes how we move, whether it is
how we navigate in a room or how we interact with other humans. Current human
motion generation methods, neglect this interdependency and use task-specific
``perception'' that differs radically from that of humans. We argue that the
generation of human-like avatar behavior requires human-like perception.
Consequently, in this work we present CLOPS, the first human avatar that solely
uses egocentric vision to perceive its surroundings and navigate. Using vision
as the primary driver of motion however, gives rise to a significant challenge
for training avatars: existing datasets have either isolated human motion,
without the context of a scene, or lack scale. We overcome this challenge by
decoupling the learning of low-level motion skills from learning of high-level
control that maps visual input to motion. First, we train a motion prior model
on a large motion capture dataset. Then, a policy is trained using Q-learning
to map egocentric visual inputs to high-level control commands for the motion
prior. Our experiments empirically demonstrate that egocentric vision can give
rise to human-like motion characteristics in our avatars. For example, the
avatars walk such that they avoid obstacles present in their visual field.
These findings suggest that equipping avatars with human-like sensors,
particularly egocentric vision, holds promise for training avatars that behave
like humans.

Motivation: 当前布局到图像生成方法在处理边界框显著重叠时表现不佳，特别是面对大重叠区域和语义区分度小的重叠实例时。现有基准存在偏向简单案例的偏差，无法有效评估模型在挑战性条件下的性能。

Method: 1) 提出OverLayScore指标量化边界框重叠复杂度；2) 构建OverLayBench基准，包含高质量标注和平衡的OverLayScore分布；3) 开发CreatiLayout-AM模型，在精选的amodal掩码数据集上进行微调。

Conclusion: 该研究为在现实和挑战性场景下实现更鲁棒的布局到图像生成奠定了基础，通过系统性评估和改进方法解决了重叠边界框带来的生成质量问题。

Abstract: Despite steady progress in layout-to-image generation, current methods still
struggle with layouts containing significant overlap between bounding boxes. We
identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2)
overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both
qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these
factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we
introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of
overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are
biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their
effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging
conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark
featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different
levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on
complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a
curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for
more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging
scenarios. Project link: https://mlpc-ucsd.github.io/OverLayBench.

Conclusion: 提出的自蒸馏框架成功地将视频扩散模型的3D知识转移到3DGS表示中，实现了无需多视角数据的3D场景生成，为物理AI应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to generate virtual environments is crucial for applications
ranging from gaming to physical AI domains such as robotics, autonomous
driving, and industrial AI. Current learning-based 3D reconstruction methods
rely on the availability of captured real-world multi-view data, which is not
always readily available. Recent advancements in video diffusion models have
shown remarkable imagination capabilities, yet their 2D nature limits the
applications to simulation where a robot needs to navigate and interact with
the environment. In this paper, we propose a self-distillation framework that
aims to distill the implicit 3D knowledge in the video diffusion models into an
explicit 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation, eliminating the need for
multi-view training data. Specifically, we augment the typical RGB decoder with
a 3DGS decoder, which is supervised by the output of the RGB decoder. In this
approach, the 3DGS decoder can be purely trained with synthetic data generated
by video diffusion models. At inference time, our model can synthesize 3D
scenes from either a text prompt or a single image for real-time rendering. Our
framework further extends to dynamic 3D scene generation from a monocular input
video. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art
performance in static and dynamic 3D scene generation.

Motivation: 现有基于像素对齐的高斯预测方法存在对输入视图数量的依赖、视图偏差的密度分布以及对遮挡和低纹理区域的配准误差等问题。

Method: VolSplat通过预测3D体素网格直接生成高斯分布，避免了依赖2D特征匹配的像素对齐，实现了自适应的高斯密度控制。

Conclusion: 该方法为前馈3D重建建立了一个更可扩展的框架，为更广泛社区的研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a highly effective
solution for novel view synthesis. Existing methods predominantly rely on a
pixel-aligned Gaussian prediction paradigm, where each 2D pixel is mapped to a
3D Gaussian. We rethink this widely adopted formulation and identify several
inherent limitations: it renders the reconstructed 3D models heavily dependent
on the number of input views, leads to view-biased density distributions, and
introduces alignment errors, particularly when source views contain occlusions
or low texture. To address these challenges, we introduce VolSplat, a new
multi-view feed-forward paradigm that replaces pixel alignment with
voxel-aligned Gaussians. By directly predicting Gaussians from a predicted 3D
voxel grid, it overcomes pixel alignment's reliance on error-prone 2D feature
matching, ensuring robust multi-view consistency. Furthermore, it enables
adaptive control over Gaussian density based on 3D scene complexity, yielding
more faithful Gaussian point clouds, improved geometric consistency, and
enhanced novel-view rendering quality. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
including RealEstate10K and ScanNet demonstrate that VolSplat achieves
state-of-the-art performance while producing more plausible and view-consistent
Gaussian reconstructions. In addition to superior results, our approach
establishes a more scalable framework for feed-forward 3D reconstruction with
denser and more robust representations, paving the way for further research in
wider communities. The video results, code and trained models are available on

Motivation: 现有的扩散和流匹配方法需要模型同时学习质量传输和条件注入，这增加了模型的学习负担。CAR-Flow旨在通过条件感知的重参数化来简化这一过程。

Method: 提出CAR-Flow方法，通过学习一个轻量级的偏移量来调整源分布、目标分布或两者，从而缩短模型需要学习的概率路径。

Result: 在低维合成数据上可视化和量化了CAR的效果；在ImageNet-256数据集上，将SiT-XL/2模型与CAR-Flow结合后，FID从2.07降至1.68，仅增加了不到0.6%的参数。

Conclusion: CAR-Flow通过条件感知重参数化有效简化了条件生成模型的学习过程，在几乎不增加参数的情况下显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Conditional generative modeling aims to learn a conditional data distribution
from samples containing data-condition pairs. For this, diffusion and
flow-based methods have attained compelling results. These methods use a
learned (flow) model to transport an initial standard Gaussian noise that
ignores the condition to the conditional data distribution. The model is hence
required to learn both mass transport and conditional injection. To ease the
demand on the model, we propose Condition-Aware Reparameterization for Flow
Matching (CAR-Flow) -- a lightweight, learned shift that conditions the source,
the target, or both distributions. By relocating these distributions, CAR-Flow
shortens the probability path the model must learn, leading to faster training
in practice. On low-dimensional synthetic data, we visualize and quantify the
effects of CAR. On higher-dimensional natural image data (ImageNet-256),
equipping SiT-XL/2 with CAR-Flow reduces FID from 2.07 to 1.68, while
introducing less than 0.6% additional parameters.

Motivation: 传统FD-OCT系统依赖k域重采样，需要额外硬件资源或增加计算复杂度，且OCT图像存在散斑噪声问题

Method: 使用两个编码器-解码器网络：SD-CNN和FD-CNN。SD-CNN从傅里叶变换后的条纹图像重建形态结构并抑制噪声，FD-CNN在傅里叶域进一步优化图像质量

Result: 定量和视觉上证明了该方法在获得高质量OCT图像方面的有效性，并展示了计算复杂度的降低

Conclusion: 这项工作为OCT图像重建领域的进一步创新奠定了基础

Abstract: Conventional Fourier-domain Optical Coherence Tomography (FD-OCT) systems
depend on resampling into wavenumber (k) domain to extract the depth profile.
This either necessitates additional hardware resources or amplifies the
existing computational complexity. Moreover, the OCT images also suffer from
speckle noise, due to systemic reliance on low coherence interferometry. We
propose a streamlined and computationally efficient approach based on
Deep-Learning (DL) which enables reconstructing speckle-reduced OCT images
directly from the wavelength domain. For reconstruction, two encoder-decoder
styled networks namely Spatial Domain Convolution Neural Network (SD-CNN) and
Fourier Domain CNN (FD-CNN) are used sequentially. The SD-CNN exploits the
highly degraded images obtained by Fourier transforming the domain fringes to
reconstruct the deteriorated morphological structures along with suppression of
unwanted noise. The FD-CNN leverages this output to enhance the image quality
further by optimization in Fourier domain (FD). We quantitatively and visually
demonstrate the efficacy of the method in obtaining high-quality OCT images.
Furthermore, we illustrate the computational complexity reduction by harnessing
the power of DL models. We believe that this work lays the framework for
further innovations in the realm of OCT image reconstruction.

Motivation: 传统基于CBCT的剂量计算存在图像质量限制，需要复杂的校正工作流程。现代质子治疗规划需要准确计算CBCT图像上的剂量，特别是在自适应治疗场景中考虑分次间的解剖变化。

Abstract: Accurate dose calculation on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is
essential for modern proton treatment planning workflows, particularly when
accounting for inter-fractional anatomical changes in adaptive treatment
scenarios. Traditional CBCT-based dose calculation suffers from image quality
limitations, requiring complex correction workflows. This study develops and
validates a deep learning approach for direct proton dose calculation from CBCT
images using extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) neural networks. A
retrospective dataset of 40 head-and-neck cancer patients with paired planning
CT and treatment CBCT images was used to train an xLSTM-based neural network
(CBCT-NN). The architecture incorporates energy token encoding and
beam's-eye-view sequence modelling to capture spatial dependencies in proton
dose deposition patterns. Training utilized 82,500 paired beam configurations
with Monte Carlo-generated ground truth doses. Validation was performed on 5
independent patients using gamma analysis, mean percentage dose error
assessment, and dose-volume histogram comparison. The CBCT-NN achieved gamma
pass rates of 95.1 $\pm$ 2.7% using 2mm/2% criteria. Mean percentage dose
errors were 2.6 $\pm$ 1.4% in high-dose regions ($>$90% of max dose) and 5.9
$\pm$ 1.9% globally. Dose-volume histogram analysis showed excellent
preservation of target coverage metrics (Clinical Target Volume V95%

difference: -0.5 $\pm$ 1.5%). Computation time is under 3 minutes without
sacrificing Monte Carlo-level accuracy. This study demonstrates the
proof-of-principle of direct CBCT-based proton dose calculation using xLSTM
neural networks. The approach eliminates traditional correction workflows while
achieving comparable accuracy and computational efficiency suitable for

### [186] [No Verifiable Reward for Prosody: Toward Preference-Guided Prosody Learning in TTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18531)
*Seungyoun Shin,Dongha Ahn,Jiwoo Kim,Sungwook Jeon*

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种迭代直接偏好优化(DPO)方法，使用少量人工标注的偏好对来优化TTS系统的韵律自然度，在韩国呼叫中心数据集上取得了最佳的人类偏好评分和竞争力的字符错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GRPO方法虽然能降低字符错误率，但会导致韵律单调不自然，且加入说话人相似性后训练不稳定。需要一种能直接优化韵律自然度的方法。

Method: 采用迭代直接偏好优化(DPO)方案，每轮仅使用几百个人工标注的偏好对，直接优化韵律自然度同时对当前模型进行正则化。

Result: 在KoCC-TTS数据集上，该方法获得了最高的人类偏好评分(ELO)和竞争力的字符错误率，优于GRPO和商业基线系统。

Conclusion: 当韵律无法自动奖励时，人类偏好优化提供了一种实用且数据高效的方法来实现自然且鲁棒的TTS系统。

Abstract: Recent work reports gains in neural text-to-speech (TTS) with Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, in the absence of a verifiable reward for
\textit{prosody}, GRPO trained on transcription-oriented signals (CER/NLL)
lowers error rates yet collapses prosody into monotone, unnatural speech;
adding speaker-similarity further destabilizes training and degrades CER. We
address this with an \textit{iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)}
scheme that uses only a few hundred human-labeled preference pairs per round to
directly optimize prosodic naturalness while regularizing to the current model.
On \textbf{KoCC-TTS}, a curated dataset of authentic Korean call center
interactions capturing task-oriented dialogues, our method attains the highest
human preference (ELO) with competitive CER, outperforming GRPO and strong
commercial baselines. These results suggest that when prosody cannot be
rewarded automatically, \textit{human preference optimization} offers a
practical and data-efficient path to natural and robust TTS. The demo page is

Main category: eess.AS

TL;DR: 提出了HarmoniFuse框架，通过组件选择和提示自适应机制来解决多任务语音语言模型中ASR和SER任务信息需求差异的问题，避免任务干扰并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多任务语音语言模型采用简单的参数共享或提示条件机制，没有明确建模不同任务所需信息组成的差异，导致任务干扰和性能下降，特别是在数据有限的情况下。

Method: HarmoniFuse框架包含门控语音编码器提取任务特定声学特征，以及提示自适应动态融合模块根据任务特性聚合Transformer层，同时采用批量交错训练策略利用单独的ASR和SER数据集。

Result: 实验结果表明HarmoniFuse能够同时提升ASR和SER性能，在现实数据约束下为多任务语音理解提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案。

Conclusion: HarmoniFuse通过协调异构任务需求，选择并融合任务相关的语音表示组件，有效解决了多任务语音语言模型中的任务干扰问题，在有限数据条件下表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have facilitated the development of
unified speech language models (SLMs) capable of supporting multiple speech
tasks within a shared architecture. However, tasks such as automatic speech
recognition (ASR) and speech emotion recognition (SER) rely on distinct types
of information: ASR primarily depends on linguistic content, whereas SER
requires the integration of both linguistic and paralinguistic cues. Existing
multitask SLMs typically adopt naive parameter sharing or prompt-based
conditioning without explicitly modeling the differences in information
composition required by each task. Such designs risk task interference and
performance degradation, especially under limited data conditions. To address
these limitations, we propose HarmoniFuse, a component-selective and
prompt-adaptive framework for multi-task speech language modeling. HarmoniFuse
is designed to harmonize heterogeneous task demands by selecting and fusing
task-relevant components of speech representations. Specifically, it integrates
a gated speech encoder to extract task-specific acoustic features and a
prompt-adaptive dynamic fusion module to aggregate transformer layers based on
task characteristics. In addition, a batch-interleaved training strategy
enables leveraging separate ASR and SER datasets without requiring joint
annotation. Experimental results demonstrate that HarmoniFuse improves both ASR
and SER performance, offering a scalable and robust solution for multitask
speech understanding under realistic data constraints.

TL;DR: 提出统一知识蒸馏框架，将文本教师模型的推理能力迁移到音频学生模型，同时保持音频处理能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决音频语言模型在复杂推理任务上的困难，主要由于音频与文本之间的模态差距以及缺乏结构化中间监督

Method: 双维度知识蒸馏：源维度蒸馏（利用文本和音频教师提供互补监督）和层维度蒸馏（对齐教师信号与学生层以提高迁移效率）

Result: 实验结果显示音频推理性能显著提升

Conclusion: 该框架作为音频建模的推理迁移解决方案具有有效性

Abstract: While large audio language models excel at tasks like ASR and emotion
recognition, they still struggle with complex reasoning due to the modality gap
between audio and text as well as the lack of structured intermediate
supervision. To address this, we propose a unified knowledge distillation
framework to transfer reasoning capabilities from a high-capacity textual
teacher model to a student audio models while preserving its acoustic
competence. Our method introduces two key dimensions: source-wise distillation,
which leverages both textual and acoustic teachers to provide complementary
modality-specific supervision; and layer-wise distillation, which aligns
teacher signals with appropriate student layers to improve transfer efficiency.
This dual-dimensional strategy enables fine-grained control over the
distillation process, effectively bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning
and speech representations. Experimental results show significant improvements
in audio reasoning performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
framework as a reasoning transfer solution for audio modeling.

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature poses unprecedented
challenges for researchers attempting to synthesize knowledge across rapidly
evolving fields. We present \textbf{Agentic AutoSurvey}, a multi-agent
framework for automated survey generation that addresses fundamental
limitations in existing approaches. Our system employs four specialized agents
(Paper Search Specialist, Topic Mining \& Clustering, Academic Survey Writer,
and Quality Evaluator) working in concert to generate comprehensive literature
surveys with superior synthesis quality. Through experiments on six
representative LLM research topics from COLM 2024 categories, we demonstrate
that our multi-agent approach achieves significant improvements over existing
baselines, scoring 8.18/10 compared to AutoSurvey's 4.77/10. The multi-agent
architecture processes 75--443 papers per topic (847 total across six topics)
while targeting high citation coverage (often $\geq$80\% on 75--100-paper sets;
lower on very large sets such as RLHF) through specialized agent orchestration.
Our 12-dimension evaluation captures organization, synthesis integration, and
critical analysis beyond basic metrics. These findings demonstrate that
multi-agent architectures represent a meaningful advancement for automated
literature survey generation in rapidly evolving scientific domains.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 本文研究零样本深度伪造检测和预防技术，探讨了自监督学习、Transformer分类器、生成模型指纹识别等方法，并提出了AI驱动的预防策略，包括对抗性扰动、数字水印等技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着GAN和扩散模型的快速发展，深度伪造技术对数字安全、媒体完整性和公众信任构成严重威胁，需要开发能够应对新型深度伪造变体的零样本检测方法。

Method: 采用自监督学习、基于Transformer的零样本分类器、生成模型指纹识别和元学习技术，结合对抗性扰动、数字水印、实时AI监控和区块链验证等预防策略。

Result: 研究提出了集成零样本学习和预防机制的防御框架，但面临对抗攻击、可扩展性限制、伦理困境和缺乏标准化评估基准等挑战。

Conclusion: 需要跨学科合作开发可解释AI、多模态融合、量子AI和联邦学习等未来研究方向，构建弹性的深度伪造防御体系。

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have dramatically
advanced deepfake technology, and its threats to digital security, media
integrity, and public trust have increased rapidly. This research explored
zero-shot deepfake detection, an emerging method even when the models have
never seen a particular deepfake variation. In this work, we studied
self-supervised learning, transformer-based zero-shot classifier, generative
model fingerprinting, and meta-learning techniques that better adapt to the
ever-evolving deepfake threat. In addition, we suggested AI-driven prevention
strategies that mitigated the underlying generation pipeline of the deepfakes
before they occurred. They consisted of adversarial perturbations for creating
deepfake generators, digital watermarking for content authenticity
verification, real-time AI monitoring for content creation pipelines, and
blockchain-based content verification frameworks. Despite these advancements,
zero-shot detection and prevention faced critical challenges such as
adversarial attacks, scalability constraints, ethical dilemmas, and the absence
of standardized evaluation benchmarks. These limitations were addressed by
discussing future research directions on explainable AI for deepfake detection,
multimodal fusion based on image, audio, and text analysis, quantum AI for
enhanced security, and federated learning for privacy-preserving deepfake
detection. This further highlighted the need for an integrated defense
framework for digital authenticity that utilized zero-shot learning in
combination with preventive deepfake mechanisms. Finally, we highlighted the
important role of interdisciplinary collaboration between AI researchers,
cybersecurity experts, and policymakers to create resilient defenses against
the rising tide of deepfake attacks.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于高斯面元的高效可微分光传输框架，通过扩展经典辐射度理论来解决辐射场方法在材质反射特性和光照建模方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统辐射场方法牺牲了材质反射特性和光照条件的建模，导致几何歧义且无法进行重光照。现有方法在全局光照优化中要么计算成本过高，要么采用简化导致精度不足。

Method: 使用高斯面元作为基元，在球谐系数空间中构建可微分光传输框架，扩展经典辐射度理论支持非二元可见性和半透明基元，提出高效求解器和梯度优化方法。

Result: 实现了视角无关的渲染，在视角变化时无需重新计算光传输，支持包含视角相关反射的全局光照效果，达到数百FPS的渲染速度。在几何重建、视图合成和重光照方面优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏数据集下，无论光照条件已知或未知，都能实现高质量的几何重建、视图合成和重光照效果，为可微分渲染提供了高效的全局光照解决方案。

Abstract: Radiance fields have gained tremendous success with applications ranging from
novel view synthesis to geometry reconstruction, especially with the advent of
Gaussian splatting. However, they sacrifice modeling of material reflective
properties and lighting conditions, leading to significant geometric
ambiguities and the inability to easily perform relighting. One way to address
these limitations is to incorporate physically-based rendering, but it has been
prohibitively expensive to include full global illumination within the inner
loop of the optimization. Therefore, previous works adopt simplifications that
make the whole optimization with global illumination effects efficient but less
accurate. In this work, we adopt Gaussian surfels as the primitives and build
an efficient framework for differentiable light transport, inspired from the
classic radiosity theory. The whole framework operates in the coefficient space
of spherical harmonics, enabling both diffuse and specular materials. We extend
the classic radiosity into non-binary visibility and semi-opaque primitives,
propose novel solvers to efficiently solve the light transport, and derive the
backward pass for gradient optimizations, which is more efficient than
auto-differentiation. During inference, we achieve view-independent rendering
where light transport need not be recomputed under viewpoint changes, enabling
hundreds of FPS for global illumination effects, including view-dependent
reflections using a spherical harmonics representation. Through extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate superior geometry
reconstruction, view synthesis and relighting than previous inverse rendering
baselines, or data-driven baselines given relatively sparse datasets with known
or unknown lighting conditions.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: Text Slider是一个轻量级、高效的即插即用框架，通过在预训练文本编码器中识别低秩方向，实现对视觉概念的连续控制，显著减少训练时间、GPU内存消耗和可训练参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的概念控制方法需要大量训练时间和GPU内存来学习滑块或嵌入，并且需要为不同的扩散骨干网络重新训练，限制了其可扩展性和适应性。

Method: 在预训练文本编码器中识别低秩方向，实现连续概念控制，支持多概念组合和连续控制。

Result: Text Slider实现了平滑连续的概念属性调制，同时保持输入的空间布局和结构，训练速度比Concept Slider快5倍，比Attribute Control快47倍，GPU内存使用分别减少近2倍和4倍。

Conclusion: Text Slider提供了一个高效、可扩展的概念控制解决方案，在图像和视频合成中实现了细粒度和灵活的操作。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved image and
video synthesis. In addition, several concept control methods have been
proposed to enable fine-grained, continuous, and flexible control over
free-form text prompts. However, these methods not only require intensive
training time and GPU memory usage to learn the sliders or embeddings but also
need to be retrained for different diffusion backbones, limiting their
scalability and adaptability. To address these limitations, we introduce Text
Slider, a lightweight, efficient and plug-and-play framework that identifies
low-rank directions within a pre-trained text encoder, enabling continuous
control of visual concepts while significantly reducing training time, GPU
memory consumption, and the number of trainable parameters. Furthermore, Text
Slider supports multi-concept composition and continuous control, enabling
fine-grained and flexible manipulation in both image and video synthesis. We
show that Text Slider enables smooth and continuous modulation of specific
attributes while preserving the original spatial layout and structure of the
input. Text Slider achieves significantly better efficiency: 5$\times$ faster
training than Concept Slider and 47$\times$ faster than Attribute Control,
while reducing GPU memory usage by nearly 2$\times$ and 4$\times$,
respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风格迁移方法难以处理刺绣等具有复杂针法和材料特性的细粒度视觉特征迁移需求。需要探索针对此类精细特征的定制化方法。

Method: 采用对比学习框架，基于图像类比概念解耦风格和内容特征。使用两阶段对比LoRA调制技术：第一阶段迭代更新整个LoRA和选定风格块进行初步分离；第二阶段通过自知识蒸馏进一步解耦。构建推理管道处理图像或文本输入。

Result: 在刺绣定制基准测试中超越现有方法，并在艺术风格迁移、草图着色和外观迁移三个额外领域展示出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理细粒度风格迁移任务，特别是在刺绣等复杂纹理场景下表现优异，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced image manipulation techniques,
and their ability to generate photorealistic images is beginning to transform
retail workflows, particularly in presale visualization. Beyond artistic style
transfer, the capability to perform fine-grained visual feature transfer is
becoming increasingly important. Embroidery is a textile art form characterized
by intricate interplay of diverse stitch patterns and material properties,
which poses unique challenges for existing style transfer methods. To explore
the customization for such fine-grained features, we propose a novel
contrastive learning framework that disentangles fine-grained style and content
features with a single reference image, building on the classic concept of
image analogy. We first construct an image pair to define the target style, and
then adopt a similarity metric based on the decoupled representations of
pretrained diffusion models for style-content separation. Subsequently, we
propose a two-stage contrastive LoRA modulation technique to capture
fine-grained style features. In the first stage, we iteratively update the
whole LoRA and the selected style blocks to initially separate style from
content. In the second stage, we design a contrastive learning strategy to
further decouple style and content through self-knowledge distillation.
Finally, we build an inference pipeline to handle image or text inputs with
only the style blocks. To evaluate our method on fine-grained style transfer,
we build a benchmark for embroidery customization. Our approach surpasses prior
methods on this task and further demonstrates strong generalization to three
additional domains: artistic style transfer, sketch colorization, and
appearance transfer.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型安全研究主要关注输出评估或特定安全任务，无法应对更广泛的未定义风险。SAE虽然能解释模型行为，但之前的研究未能将特征与细粒度安全概念关联

Method: Safe-SAIL框架系统识别具有最佳概念特定可解释性的SAE，解释安全相关神经元，并引入高效策略扩展解释过程

Result: 将发布包含SAE检查点和人类可读神经元解释的完整工具包，支持安全风险的实证分析

Conclusion: 该框架通过SAE特征解释推进大语言模型安全领域的机理理解，促进LLM安全研究发展

Abstract: Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world
applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research
focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their
ability to ad- dress broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)
facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining
single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever,
prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained
safety-related con- cepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical
behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regu-
lations. For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set
of safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors,
yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for
generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of
detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we pro- pose Safe-SAIL, a
framework for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic
understanding in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE
with best concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons,
and introduces efficient strategies to scale up the in- terpretation process.
We will release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and
human-readable neuron ex- planations, which supports empirical analysis of
safety risks to promote research on LLM safety.

Motivation: 当前大语言模型无法将高精度数值计算作为内在能力集成到推理过程中，而现有的多智能体方法存在通信开销大、多模态能力效率低和可扩展性有限的问题。

Method: 提出PiMoE（物理隔离的专家混合）架构，通过分别训练专家模型、文本到计算模块和路由器，在推理时路由器在令牌级别指导计算和推理的交替进行。

Result: 在两个推理-计算任务上的评估显示，PiMoE不仅比直接微调LLM获得更高准确率，而且在响应延迟、令牌使用和GPU能耗方面相比主流多智能体方法有显著改进。

Conclusion: PiMoE为下一代科学或工业智能系统提供了一个高效、可解释且可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Complex systems typically rely on high-precision numerical computation to
support decisions, but current large language models (LLMs) cannot yet
incorporate such computations as an intrinsic and interpretable capability with
existing architectures. Mainstream multi-agent approaches can leverage external
experts, but inevitably introduce communication overhead and suffer from
inefficient multimodal emergent capability and limited scalability. To this
end, we propose PiMoE (Physically-isolated Mixture of Experts), a training and
inference architecture for integrating computation and reasoning. Instead of
the workflow paradigm of tool invocation, PiMoE endogenously integrates
computational capabilities into neural networks after separately training
experts, a text-to-computation module, and a router. At inference, the router
directs computation and reasoning at the token level, thereby enabling
iterative alternation within a single chain of thought. We evaluate PiMoE on
two reasoning-computation tasks against LLM finetuning and the multi-agent
system approaches. Results show that the PiMoE architecture achieves not only
higher accuracy than directly finetuning LLMs but also significant improvements
in response latency, token usage, and GPU energy consumption compared with
mainstream multi-agent approaches. PiMoE offers an efficient, interpretable,
and scalable paradigm for next-generation scientific or industrial intelligent
systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个大规模基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在地理空间路线认知方面的能力，发现LLMs在路线反转任务中存在显著局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够通过自然语言理解地理空间信息，但大语言模型的地理空间认知能力尚未得到充分探索，现有研究受限于不可量化的指标、有限的数据集和模糊的研究层次。

Method: 创建了包含全球12个大都市36000条路线的大规模评估数据集；开发了PathBuilder工具，实现自然语言指令与导航路线的双向转换；提出了新的评估框架和指标，对11个SOTA LLMs进行路线反转任务的严格评估。

Conclusion: 该研究为LLMs的地理空间认知能力提供了首个大规模量化评估基准，揭示了当前模型在此领域的不足，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Humans can interpret geospatial information through natural language, while
the geospatial cognition capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) remain
underexplored. Prior research in this domain has been constrained by
non-quantifiable metrics, limited evaluation datasets and unclear research
hierarchies. Therefore, we propose a large-scale benchmark and conduct a
comprehensive evaluation of the geospatial route cognition of LLMs. We create a
large-scale evaluation dataset comprised of 36000 routes from 12 metropolises
worldwide. Then, we introduce PathBuilder, a novel tool for converting natural
language instructions into navigation routes, and vice versa, bridging the gap
between geospatial information and natural language. Finally, we propose a new
evaluation framework and metrics to rigorously assess 11 state-of-the-art
(SOTA) LLMs on the task of route reversal. The benchmark reveals that LLMs
exhibit limitation to reverse routes: most reverse routes neither return to the
starting point nor are similar to the optimal route. Additionally, LLMs face
challenges such as low robustness in route generation and high confidence for
their incorrect answers. Code\ \&\ Data available here:

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态思维链（MCoT）框架，用于解决对话式导航中的自我中心到非自我中心的空间方向推理问题，在中文对话导航任务中取得了优异表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内或复杂环境中GPS信号弱、缺乏详细地图时，对话系统需要将自我中心表述（如"在我右边"）转换为非自我中心方向（东南西北）的挑战。

Method: 提出多模态思维链框架，整合ASR转录语音和地标坐标，通过三步推理过程：提取空间关系、坐标映射到绝对方向、推断用户朝向，并在台湾LLM-13B模型上采用课程学习策略。

Result: MCoT在干净转录本上达到100%方向准确率，在ASR转录本上达到98.1%，显著优于单模态和非结构化基线，且在噪声对话条件下表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结构化MCoT空间推理为实现可解释和资源高效的具身导航提供了一条可行路径，在多语言代码切换、领域转移等挑战下保持高准确性。

Abstract: Conversational agents must translate egocentric utterances (e.g., "on my
right") into allocentric orientations (N/E/S/W). This challenge is particularly
critical in indoor or complex facilities where GPS signals are weak and
detailed maps are unavailable. While chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has
advanced reasoning in language and vision tasks, its application to multimodal
spatial orientation remains underexplored. We introduce Conversational
Orientation Reasoning (COR), a new benchmark designed for Traditional Chinese
conversational navigation projected from real-world environments, addressing
egocentric-to-allocentric reasoning in non-English and ASR-transcribed
scenarios. We propose a multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) framework, which
integrates ASR-transcribed speech with landmark coordinates through a
structured three-step reasoning process: (1) extracting spatial relations, (2)
mapping coordinates to absolute directions, and (3) inferring user orientation.
A curriculum learning strategy progressively builds these capabilities on
Taiwan-LLM-13B-v2.0-Chat, a mid-sized model representative of
resource-constrained settings. Experiments show that MCoT achieves 100%
orientation accuracy on clean transcripts and 98.1% with ASR transcripts,
substantially outperforming unimodal and non-structured baselines. Moreover,
MCoT demonstrates robustness under noisy conversational conditions, including
ASR recognition errors and multilingual code-switching. The model also
maintains high accuracy in cross-domain evaluation and resilience to linguistic
variation, domain shift, and referential ambiguity. These findings highlight
the potential of structured MCoT spatial reasoning as a path toward
interpretable and resource-efficient embodied navigation.

Conclusion: 该方法为PDE系统中高效算子学习提供了有前景的技术路径

Abstract: Neural operator learning has emerged as a powerful approach for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) in a data-driven manner. However,
applying principal component analysis (PCA) to high-dimensional solution fields
incurs significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose a
patch-based PCA-Net framework that decomposes the solution fields into smaller
patches, applies PCA within each patch, and trains a neural operator in the
reduced PCA space. We investigate two different patch-based approaches that
balance computational efficiency and reconstruction accuracy: (1)
local-to-global patch PCA, and (2) local-to-local patch PCA. The trade-off
between computational cost and accuracy is analyzed, highlighting the
advantages and limitations of each approach. Furthermore, within each approach,
we explore two refinements for the most computationally efficient method: (i)
introducing overlapping patches with a smoothing filter and (ii) employing a
two-step process with a convolutional neural network (CNN) for refinement. Our
results demonstrate that patch-based PCA significantly reduces computational
complexity while maintaining high accuracy, reducing end-to-end pipeline
processing time by a factor of 3.7 to 4 times compared to global PCA, thefore
making it a promising technique for efficient operator learning in PDE-based
systems.

*Faizul Rakib Sayem,Shahana Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文优化的新框架，将子空间表示学习与提示调优相结合，用于提升大尺度视觉语言模型的OOD检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于提示学习的OOD检测方法仅依赖softmax概率，忽略了视觉语言模型在数百万样本上学习到的丰富特征嵌入的判别潜力

Method: 通过将ID特征投影到提示向量张成的子空间，同时将ID无关特征投影到正交零空间，设计易于处理的端到端学习准则

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法通过子空间表示学习和提示调优的集成，显著提升了ID-OOD可分性

Abstract: The reliability of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in open-world
settings depends heavily on their ability to flag out-of-distribution (OOD)
inputs unseen during training. Recent advances in large-scale vision-language
models (VLMs) have enabled promising few-shot OOD detection frameworks using
only a handful of in-distribution (ID) samples. However, existing prompt
learning-based OOD methods rely solely on softmax probabilities, overlooking
the rich discriminative potential of the feature embeddings learned by VLMs
trained on millions of samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
context optimization (CoOp)-based framework that integrates subspace
representation learning with prompt tuning. Our approach improves ID-OOD
separability by projecting the ID features into a subspace spanned by prompt
vectors, while projecting ID-irrelevant features into an orthogonal null space.
To train such OOD detection framework, we design an easy-to-handle end-to-end
learning criterion that ensures strong OOD detection performance as well as
high ID classification accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets showcase
the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: KM-GPT是一个全自动AI驱动的管道，用于从Kaplan-Meier图中高精度重建个体患者数据，解决了传统手动数字化方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动数字化，容易出错且缺乏可扩展性，需要自动化解决方案来提高临床研究中证据合成的效率和准确性。

Method: 集成先进的图像预处理、GPT-5驱动的多模态推理和迭代重建算法，采用混合推理架构自动将非结构化信息转换为结构化数据流。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上严格评估，始终表现出卓越的准确性，成功应用于胃癌免疫治疗试验的荟萃分析。

Conclusion: KM-GPT通过自动化传统手动流程，为临床研究提供可扩展的基于网络的解决方案，支持基于证据的决策制定。

Abstract: Reconstructing individual patient data (IPD) from Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots
provides valuable insights for evidence synthesis in clinical research.
However, existing approaches often rely on manual digitization, which is
error-prone and lacks scalability. To address these limitations, we develop
KM-GPT, the first fully automated, AI-powered pipeline for reconstructing IPD
directly from KM plots with high accuracy, robustness, and reproducibility.
KM-GPT integrates advanced image preprocessing, multi-modal reasoning powered
by GPT-5, and iterative reconstruction algorithms to generate high-quality IPD
without manual input or intervention. Its hybrid reasoning architecture
automates the conversion of unstructured information into structured data flows
and validates data extraction from complex KM plots. To improve accessibility,
KM-GPT is equipped with a user-friendly web interface and an integrated AI
assistant, enabling researchers to reconstruct IPD without requiring
programming expertise. KM-GPT was rigorously evaluated on synthetic and
real-world datasets, consistently demonstrating superior accuracy. To
illustrate its utility, we applied KM-GPT to a meta-analysis of gastric cancer
immunotherapy trials, reconstructing IPD to facilitate evidence synthesis and
biomarker-based subgroup analyses. By automating traditionally manual processes
and providing a scalable, web-based solution, KM-GPT transforms clinical
research by leveraging reconstructed IPD to enable more informed downstream
analyses, supporting evidence-based decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MiniCPM-V 4.5是一个8B参数的多模态大语言模型，通过架构、数据和训练方法的改进实现了高效性和强性能，在多项评测中超越了GPT-4o-latest等专有模型和更大的开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型训练和推理效率低下的问题，使其更具可访问性和可扩展性。

Method: 采用统一的3D-Resampler模型架构进行图像和视频的紧凑编码；使用统一学习范式处理文档知识和文本识别；采用混合强化学习策略支持短推理和长推理模式。

Result: 在OpenCompass评测中超越了GPT-4o-latest和Qwen2.5-VL 72B等模型；在VideoMME基准测试中，仅使用Qwen2.5-VL 7B的46.7% GPU内存和8.7%推理时间就达到了30B以下模型的最优性能。

Conclusion: MiniCPM-V 4.5在保持强性能的同时实现了显著的高效性，为多模态大语言模型的可访问性和可扩展性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are undergoing rapid progress and
represent the frontier of AI development. However, their training and inference
efficiency have emerged as a core bottleneck in making MLLMs more accessible
and scalable. To address the challenges, we present MiniCPM-V 4.5, an 8B
parameter model designed for high efficiency and strong performance. We
introduce three core improvements in model architecture, data strategy and
training method: a unified 3D-Resampler model architecture for highly compact
encoding over images and videos, a unified learning paradigm for document
knowledge and text recognition without heavy data engineering, and a hybrid
reinforcement learning strategy for proficiency in both short and long
reasoning modes. Comprehensive experimental results in OpenCompass evaluation
show that MiniCPM-V 4.5 surpasses widely used proprietary models such as
GPT-4o-latest, and significantly larger open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL
72B. Notably, the strong performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency.
For example, on the widely adopted VideoMME benchmark, MiniCPM-V 4.5 achieves
state-of-the-art performance among models under 30B size, using just 46.7\% GPU
memory cost and 8.7\% inference time of Qwen2.5-VL 7B.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: JAD是一个基于潜在扩散模型的黑盒对抗攻击框架，通过联合注意力蒸馏策略实现跨架构的对抗样本生成，提高了攻击泛化性和生成效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击方法存在跨架构迁移性差、查询成本高的问题，需要一种架构无关且高效的攻击方法

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型框架，通过从CNN和ViT模型中蒸馏注意力图来指导对抗样本生成，聚焦于不同架构共同敏感的图像区域

Result: 实验表明JAD在攻击泛化性、生成效率和跨架构迁移性方面优于现有方法

Conclusion: JAD为黑盒对抗攻击提供了一个有前景的有效范式

Abstract: Black-box adversarial attacks remain challenging due to limited access to
model internals. Existing methods often depend on specific network
architectures or require numerous queries, resulting in limited
cross-architecture transferability and high query costs. To address these
limitations, we propose JAD, a latent diffusion model framework for black-box
adversarial attacks. JAD generates adversarial examples by leveraging a latent
diffusion model guided by attention maps distilled from both a convolutional
neural network (CNN) and a Vision Transformer (ViT) models. By focusing on
image regions that are commonly sensitive across architectures, this approach
crafts adversarial perturbations that transfer effectively between different
model types. This joint attention distillation strategy enables JAD to be
architecture-agnostic, achieving superior attack generalization across diverse
models. Moreover, the generative nature of the diffusion framework yields high
adversarial sample generation efficiency by reducing reliance on iterative
queries. Experiments demonstrate that JAD offers improved attack
generalization, generation efficiency, and cross-architecture transferability
compared to existing methods, providing a promising and effective paradigm for
black-box adversarial attacks.

TL;DR: 本研究比较了手持智能手机和头戴式AR系统在视觉辅助技术中的物理和功能影响，发现头戴式系统减少上身运动和任务时间，手持系统在小文本任务中成功率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同设备形态（手持智能手机 vs 头戴式AR系统）对盲人或低视力人群使用视觉辅助技术时的物理和功能影响差异。

Method: 11名盲人或低视力参与者使用Seeing AI在两种设备上完成六项日常活动，通过Xsens动作捕捉系统记录运动数据，评估功能结果（任务时间、成功率、尝试次数）和生物力学指标（关节活动范围、角度路径长度、工作体积、运动平滑度）。

Result: 头戴式系统普遍减少上身运动和任务时间（特别是文档扫描类任务），手持系统在涉及小或弯曲文本的任务中成功率更高。

Conclusion: 两种设备形态都可行，但在物理需求和易用性方面存在差异；将生物力学测量纳入辅助技术评估可以优化用户体验，平衡功能效率、物理可持续性和直观交互。

Abstract: Visual assistive technologies, such as Microsoft Seeing AI, can improve
access to environmental information for persons with blindness or low vision
(pBLV). Yet, the physical and functional implications of different device
embodiments remain unclear. In this study, 11 pBLV participants used Seeing AI
on a hand-held smartphone and on a head-mounted ARx Vision system to perform
six activities of daily living, while their movements were captured with Xsens
motion capture. Functional outcomes included task time, success rate, and
number of attempts, and biomechanical measures included joint range of motion,
angular path length, working volume, and movement smoothness. The head-mounted
system generally reduced upper-body movement and task time, especially for
document-scanning style tasks, whereas the hand-held system yielded higher
success rates for tasks involving small or curved text. These findings indicate
that both embodiments are viable, but they differ in terms of physical demands
and ease of use. Incorporating biomechanical measures into assistive technology
evaluations can inform designs that optimise user experience by balancing
functional efficiency, physical sustainability, and intuitive interaction.

Motivation: 非线性薛定谔方程是描述非线性介质中波动力学的基础模型，但从单次测量中准确估计其强相关参数仍然是一个重大挑战。

Method: 将参数估计视为逆问题，训练神经网络来反转NLSE映射。使用基于ConvNeXt架构的机器学习方法和多元高斯负对数似然损失函数，结合快速数值求解器。

Result: 在100,000张模拟图像上训练后，模型在12,500个未见测试样本上实现了3.22%的平均绝对误差，显示出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为表征非线性系统提供了一条有效途径，在加入实际噪声后有望架起理论建模与实验数据之间的桥梁。

Abstract: The nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) is a fundamental model for wave
dynamics in nonlinear media ranging from optical fibers to Bose-Einstein
condensates. Accurately estimating its parameters, which are often strongly
correlated, from a single measurement remains a significant challenge. We
address this problem by treating parameter estimation as an inverse problem and
training a neural network to invert the NLSE mapping. We combine a fast
numerical solver with a machine learning approach based on the ConvNeXt
architecture and a multivariate Gaussian negative log-likelihood loss function.
From single-shot field (density and phase) images, our model estimates three
key parameters: the nonlinear coefficient $n_2$, the saturation intensity
$I_{sat}$, and the linear absorption coefficient $\alpha$. Trained on 100,000
simulated images, the model achieves a mean absolute error of $3.22\%$ on
12,500 unseen test samples, demonstrating strong generalization and close
agreement with ground-truth values. This approach provides an efficient route
for characterizing nonlinear systems and has the potential to bridge
theoretical modeling and experimental data when realistic noise is
incorporated.

Result: 成功生成了多种斯格明子纹理样本，展示了量子计算在合成拓扑纹理方面的潜力。

Abstract: An integer winding, i.e., topological charge, is a characteristic of
skyrmions, which are topologically nontrivial spin patterns in magnets. They
emerge when smooth two-dimensional spin configurations are stabilized by
conflicting interactions such as exchange, anisotropy, the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, or geometric frustration. These nanoscale
textures, which are typically a few to tens of nanometers in size, are strong
'particle-like' excitations because they are shielded by energy barriers
connected to their topology. By exploiting their helicity, i.e., spin rotation
angle or associated internal modes, as a two-level system, skyrmions can
function as quantum bits or qubits. Two quantized helicity states of a
nanometer-scale skyrmion encode the logical value states in a 'skyrmion qubit.'
Interestingly, skyrmion qubits are topologically protected and macroscopic,
i.e., they involve a large number of spins; however, external influences can
still affect them. When the texture is tiny and disconnected, the helicity
angle of the skyrmion becomes quantized. A qubit basis is made up of the lowest
two energy eigenstates, i.e., symmetric or antisymmetric superpositions of
opposite helicity, for example. Therefore, Skyrmion textures can provide
valuable insights for different purposes. However, is it possible to
synthetically generate skyrmion textures using quantum computing? This paper
investigates the possibility and generates a few hundred different textures,
producing sample comparisons from various types, which indicate a novel
direction for skyrmion-based research based on quantum randomness and other
criteria.

Motivation: 传统癌症检测方法依赖人工分析医学影像，过程耗时且需要专业病理学家。为提高早期癌症检测效率，需要开发自动化的精准诊断工具。

Method: 使用预训练的ViT-Base-Patch16-224模型，通过预处理流程将组织病理图像转换为标准化PyTorch张量，在BreakHis数据集进行二元分类，在UBC-OCEAN数据集进行五分类，不采用数据增强。

Conclusion: Vision Transformer结合高效预处理在肿瘤诊断中表现出色，为自动化癌症检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cancer is one of the leading health challenges for women, specifically breast
and ovarian cancer. Early detection can help improve the survival rate through
timely intervention and treatment. Traditional methods of detecting cancer
involve manually examining mammograms, CT scans, ultrasounds, and other imaging
types. However, this makes the process labor-intensive and requires the
expertise of trained pathologists. Hence, making it both time-consuming and
resource-intensive. In this paper, we introduce a novel vision transformer
(ViT)-based method for detecting and classifying breast and ovarian cancer. We
use a pre-trained ViT-Base-Patch16-224 model, which is fine-tuned for both
binary and multi-class classification tasks using publicly available
histopathological image datasets. Further, we use a preprocessing pipeline that
converts raw histophological images into standardized PyTorch tensors, which
are compatible with the ViT architecture and also help improve the model
performance. We evaluated the performance of our model on two benchmark
datasets: the BreakHis dataset for binary classification and the UBC-OCEAN
dataset for five-class classification without any data augmentation. Our model
surpasses existing CNN, ViT, and topological data analysis-based approaches in
binary classification. For multi-class classification, it is evaluated against
recent topological methods and demonstrates superior performance. Our study
highlights the effectiveness of Vision Transformer-based transfer learning
combined with efficient preprocessing in oncological diagnostics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经纤维瘤病1型患者体内会发展大量神经纤维瘤，现有交互式分割方法无法同时实现高病灶精度和数百个病灶的可扩展性。

Method: 提出MOIS-SAM2模型，扩展了基于transformer的Segment Anything Model 2，加入基于示例的语义传播。在84名NF1患者的119个WB-MRI扫描上进行训练和评估，数据集按患者级别分为训练集和四个测试集。

Result: 在域内测试集上DSC达到0.60，优于基线方法；在不同域偏移场景下保持良好性能；病灶检测F1分数为0.62-0.78；模型与专家的一致性（DSC: 0.62-0.68）与专家间一致性（DSC: 0.57-0.69）相当。

Conclusion: MOIS-SAM2能够以最小用户输入实现神经纤维瘤的高效可扩展交互式分割，具有强泛化能力，支持临床工作流程集成。

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder
characterized by the development of numerous neurofibromas (NFs) throughout the
body. Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and
longitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation
methods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds
of lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored
to this challenge.
  Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation
model that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment
Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was
trained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using
T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient
level into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three
reflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength
variation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).
  Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of
0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC:
0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained
under MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC:
0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1
scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader
variability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68),
comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69).
  Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable
interactive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong
generalization, supporting integration into clinical workflows.

TL;DR: 论文指出当前医疗AI基准测试存在严重问题，大型模型虽然在基准测试中得分很高，但实际上缺乏真正的医学理解能力，存在脆弱性和走捷径学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示当前医疗AI基准测试的局限性，证明高分模型在实际应用中可能并不具备真正的医学能力，需要更严格的评估标准。

Method: 通过对6个旗舰模型在6个广泛使用的医疗基准上进行压力测试，包括移除关键输入、改变提示词等方式，并使用临床医生指导的评估标准进行分析。

Result: 发现领先系统即使在没有关键输入的情况下也能猜对答案，在微小提示变化下会改变答案，并生成有说服力但有缺陷的推理。基准测试奖励的是应试技巧而非真正的医学理解。

Conclusion: 医疗基准测试分数不能直接反映AI在现实世界中的准备程度，需要关注模型的鲁棒性、合理推理能力以及与真实医疗需求的匹配度，而不仅仅是排行榜上的胜利。

Abstract: Large frontier models like GPT-5 now achieve top scores on medical
benchmarks. But our stress tests tell a different story. Leading systems often
guess correctly even when key inputs like images are removed, flip answers
under trivial prompt changes, and fabricate convincing yet flawed reasoning.
These aren't glitches; they expose how today's benchmarks reward test-taking
tricks over medical understanding. We evaluate six flagship models across six
widely used benchmarks and find that high leaderboard scores hide brittleness
and shortcut learning. Through clinician-guided rubric evaluation, we show that
benchmarks vary widely in what they truly measure yet are treated
interchangeably, masking failure modes. We caution that medical benchmark
scores do not directly reflect real-world readiness. If we want AI to earn
trust in healthcare, we must demand more than leaderboard wins and must hold
systems accountable for robustness, sound reasoning, and alignment with real
medical demands.

task-oriented memories, the effective utilization of temporal and location
information within memories, and the ability to draw upon multiple memories to
answer a recall question. To address these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive pipeline, Pensieve, integrating memory-specific augmentation,
time- and location-aware multi-signal retrieval, and multi-memory QA
fine-tuning. We created a multimodal benchmark to illustrate various real
challenges in this task, and show the superior performance of Pensieve over
state-of-the-art solutions (up to 14% on QA accuracy).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在西方中心偏见，限制了其在多元文化背景下的有效性。虽然已有研究探索文化对齐，但跨文化迁移潜力（利用一种文化的对齐来提升其他文化性能）仍未被充分探索

Method: 使用覆盖13个阿拉伯国家的文化基础常识推理数据集，评估轻量级对齐方法（上下文学习、演示强化DITTO）以及基线方法（监督微调、直接偏好优化）

Result: 仅需来自一个国家的12个文化特定示例，即可在多语言模型中平均提升其他国家的性能10%。来自印尼和美国的文化外演示在MCQ推理中可达到或超越文化内对齐效果

Conclusion: 高效的跨文化对齐是可行的，这为将LLMs适配到低资源文化环境提供了一种有前景的方法

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often reflect Western-centric biases, limiting
their effectiveness in diverse cultural contexts. Although some work has
explored cultural alignment, the potential for cross-cultural transfer, using
alignment in one culture to improve performance in others, remains
underexplored. This paper investigates cross-cultural transfer of commonsense
reasoning in the Arab world, where linguistic and historical similarities
coexist with local cultural differences. Using a culturally grounded
commonsense reasoning dataset covering 13 Arab countries, we evaluate
lightweight alignment methods such as in-context learning and
demonstration-based reinforcement (DITTO), alongside baselines like supervised
fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Our results show that merely 12
culture-specific examples from one country can improve performance in others by
10\% on average, within multilingual models. In addition, we demonstrate that
out-of-culture demonstrations from Indonesia and US contexts can match or
surpass in-culture alignment for MCQ reasoning, highlighting cultural
commonsense transferability beyond the Arab world. These findings demonstrate
that efficient cross-cultural alignment is possible and offer a promising
approach to adapt LLMs to low-resource cultural settings.

environments, yet LiDAR-based methods often fail in vineyards due to repetitive
row geometry and perceptual aliasing. We propose a semantic particle filter
that incorporates stable object-level detections, specifically vine trunks and
support poles into the likelihood estimation process. Detected landmarks are
projected into a birds eye view and fused with LiDAR scans to generate semantic
observations. A key innovation is the use of semantic walls, which connect
adjacent landmarks into pseudo-structural constraints that mitigate row
aliasing. To maintain global consistency in headland regions where semantics
are sparse, we introduce a noisy GPS prior that adaptively supports the filter.
Experiments in a real vineyard demonstrate that our approach maintains
localisation within the correct row, recovers from deviations where AMCL fails,
and outperforms vision-based SLAM methods such as RTAB-Map.

TL;DR: LAWM是一个模型无关的框架，通过世界建模从无标签视频数据中学习潜在动作表示，用于自监督预训练模仿学习模型，在保持高效性的同时超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型依赖大规模人工标注的动作数据集，模型尺寸大且难以在实际场景部署。需要更高效、实用的预训练方法。

Method: 提出LAWM框架，通过世界建模从机器人记录或人类日常动作视频中学习潜在动作表示，实现跨任务、环境和体现的迁移。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实世界设置中，LAWM超越了使用真实机器人动作训练的模型和类似预训练方法。

Conclusion: LAWM提供了一种更高效实用的自监督预训练方法，能够有效处理无标签视频数据，适用于实际机器人部署场景。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have gained popularity for learning
robotic manipulation tasks that follow language instructions. State-of-the-art
VLAs, such as OpenVLA and $\pi_{0}$, were trained on large-scale, manually
labeled action datasets collected through teleoperation. More recent
approaches, including LAPA and villa-X, introduce latent action representations
that enable unsupervised pretraining on unlabeled datasets by modeling abstract
visual changes between frames. Although these methods have shown strong
results, their large model sizes make deployment in real-world settings
challenging. In this work, we propose LAWM, a model-agnostic framework to
pretrain imitation learning models in a self-supervised way, by learning latent
action representations from unlabeled video data through world modeling. These
videos can be sourced from robot recordings or videos of humans performing
actions with everyday objects. Our framework is designed to be effective for
transferring across tasks, environments, and embodiments. It outperforms models
trained with ground-truth robotics actions and similar pretraining methods on
the LIBERO benchmark and real-world setup, while being significantly more
efficient and practical for real-world settings.

TL;DR: VLN-Zero是一个两阶段的视觉语言导航框架，通过结合视觉语言模型构建符号场景图，实现零样本神经符号导航，在未见环境中实现快速适应和高效导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言导航方法在未见环境中依赖穷举探索或僵化导航策略导致泛化能力差的问题，实现可扩展的实时自主导航。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：探索阶段使用结构化提示引导VLM搜索构建紧凑场景图；部署阶段通过神经符号规划器在场景图上推理生成可执行计划，并利用缓存执行模块加速适应。

Result: 在多样化环境中，VLN-Zero相比最先进的零样本模型成功率提高2倍，超越大多数微调基线，到达目标位置时间减半，VLM调用次数平均减少55%。

Conclusion: VLN-Zero通过快速探索、符号推理和缓存执行相结合，克服了现有视觉语言导航方法的计算效率低和泛化能力差的问题，实现了在未见环境中鲁棒且可扩展的决策。

Abstract: Rapid adaptation in unseen environments is essential for scalable real-world
autonomy, yet existing approaches rely on exhaustive exploration or rigid
navigation policies that fail to generalize. We present VLN-Zero, a two-phase
vision-language navigation framework that leverages vision-language models to
efficiently construct symbolic scene graphs and enable zero-shot neurosymbolic
navigation. In the exploration phase, structured prompts guide VLM-based search
toward informative and diverse trajectories, yielding compact scene graph
representations. In the deployment phase, a neurosymbolic planner reasons over
the scene graph and environmental observations to generate executable plans,
while a cache-enabled execution module accelerates adaptation by reusing
previously computed task-location trajectories. By combining rapid exploration,
symbolic reasoning, and cache-enabled execution, the proposed framework
overcomes the computational inefficiency and poor generalization of prior
vision-language navigation methods, enabling robust and scalable
decision-making in unseen environments. VLN-Zero achieves 2x higher success
rate compared to state-of-the-art zero-shot models, outperforms most fine-tuned
baselines, and reaches goal locations in half the time with 55% fewer VLM calls
on average compared to state-of-the-art models across diverse environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如ICP在传感器噪声、位姿估计误差和部分重叠等不确定性下表现不佳，需要一种能量化并解释配准不确定性的方法。

Method: 开发了高斯过程概念归因(GP-CA)方法，利用主动学习发现新的不确定性来源，并归因不确定性到已知的配准误差源。

Result: 在三个公开数据集和真实机器人实验中，GP-CA在运行时间、样本效率和准确性方面优于其他最先进方法，并能实现有效的故障恢复行为。

Conclusion: GP-CA方法显著提高了点云配准的鲁棒性，在机器人感知中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the point cloud registration problem, where
well-known methods like ICP fail under uncertainty arising from sensor noise,
pose-estimation errors, and partial overlap due to occlusion. We develop a
novel approach, Gaussian Process Concept Attribution (GP-CA), which not only
quantifies registration uncertainty but also explains it by attributing
uncertainty to well-known sources of errors in registration problems. Our
approach leverages active learning to discover new uncertainty sources in the
wild by querying informative instances. We validate GP-CA on three publicly
available datasets and in our real-world robot experiment. Extensive ablations
substantiate our design choices. Our approach outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods in terms of runtime, high sample-efficiency with
active learning, and high accuracy. Our real-world experiment clearly
demonstrates its applicability. Our video also demonstrates that GP-CA enables
effective failure-recovery behaviors, yielding more robust robotic perception.

Conclusion: DexSkin适用于学习现实世界中接触丰富的操作任务，展示了其在数据驱动方法中的实用性和适用性。

Abstract: Human skin provides a rich tactile sensing stream, localizing intentional and
unintentional contact events over a large and contoured region. Replicating
these tactile sensing capabilities for dexterous robotic manipulation systems
remains a longstanding challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this
goal by introducing DexSkin. DexSkin is a soft, conformable capacitive
electronic skin that enables sensitive, localized, and calibratable tactile
sensing, and can be tailored to varying geometries. We demonstrate its efficacy
for learning downstream robotic manipulation by sensorizing a pair of parallel
jaw gripper fingers, providing tactile coverage across almost the entire finger
surfaces. We empirically evaluate DexSkin's capabilities in learning
challenging manipulation tasks that require sensing coverage across the entire
surface of the fingers, such as reorienting objects in hand and wrapping
elastic bands around boxes, in a learning-from-demonstration framework. We then
show that, critically for data-driven approaches, DexSkin can be calibrated to
enable model transfer across sensor instances, and demonstrate its
applicability to online reinforcement learning on real robots. Our results
highlight DexSkin's suitability and practicality for learning real-world,
contact-rich manipulation. Please see our project webpage for videos and

TL;DR: 提出一种基于深度学习的框架，在无参考地图情况下预先估计ICP配准误差协方差，提升LiDAR定位的准确性和鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ICP算法在特征缺失环境和动态场景中容易出错，现有不确定性估计方法依赖手工模型或简化假设，深度学习方法要么需要预建地图要么只能进行二元分类

Method: 使用深度学习框架，在配准前估计ICP的6自由度误差协方差，无需参考地图，可与卡尔曼滤波无缝集成

Result: 在KITTI数据集上的实验表明，该方法能准确预测协方差，应用于基于预建地图的定位或SLAM时能减少定位误差并提高鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该数据驱动框架为ICP提供了可靠的不确定性估计，显著提升了LiDAR定位系统的性能

Abstract: LiDAR-based localization and SLAM often rely on iterative matching
algorithms, particularly the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, to align
sensor data with pre-existing maps or previous scans. However, ICP is prone to
errors in featureless environments and dynamic scenes, leading to inaccurate
pose estimation. Accurately predicting the uncertainty associated with ICP is
crucial for robust state estimation but remains challenging, as existing
approaches often rely on handcrafted models or simplified assumptions.
Moreover, a few deep learning-based methods for localizability estimation
either depend on a pre-built map, which may not always be available, or provide
a binary classification of localizable versus non-localizable, which fails to
properly model uncertainty. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework
that leverages deep learning to estimate the registration error covariance of
ICP before matching, even in the absence of a reference map. By associating
each LiDAR scan with a reliable 6-DoF error covariance estimate, our method
enables seamless integration of ICP within Kalman filtering, enhancing
localization accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on the KITTI
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it
accurately predicts covariance and, when applied to localization using a
pre-built map or SLAM, reduces localization errors and improves robustness.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物体形状和姿态估计是机器人学的基础问题，支持从操作到场景理解和导航等任务，需要快速且可靠的解决方案

Method: 使用学习前端检测稀疏的类别级语义关键点，通过线性主动形状模型表示未知形状，构建最大后验优化问题，采用自洽场迭代求解特征值问题

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效解决形状和姿态估计问题，并提供简单的全局最优性证明，代码已开源

Abstract: Object shape and pose estimation is a foundational robotics problem,
supporting tasks from manipulation to scene understanding and navigation. We
present a fast local solver for shape and pose estimation which requires only
category-level object priors and admits an efficient certificate of global
optimality. Given an RGB-D image of an object, we use a learned front-end to
detect sparse, category-level semantic keypoints on the target object. We
represent the target object's unknown shape using a linear active shape model
and pose a maximum a posteriori optimization problem to solve for position,
orientation, and shape simultaneously. Expressed in unit quaternions, this
problem admits first-order optimality conditions in the form of an eigenvalue
problem with eigenvector nonlinearities. Our primary contribution is to solve
this problem efficiently with self-consistent field iteration, which only
requires computing a 4-by-4 matrix and finding its minimum eigenvalue-vector
pair at each iterate. Solving a linear system for the corresponding Lagrange
multipliers gives a simple global optimality certificate. One iteration of our
solver runs in about 100 microseconds, enabling fast outlier rejection. We test
our method on synthetic data and a variety of real-world settings, including
two public datasets and a drone tracking scenario. Code is released at

Result: 在仿真和真实世界基准测试中展示了类别级泛化、跨任务行为重用和稳健的仿真到真实部署

Conclusion: 功能规范化为复杂操作领域的可扩展模仿学习提供了强归纳偏置

Abstract: General-purpose robotic skills from end-to-end demonstrations often leads to
task-specific policies that fail to generalize beyond the training
distribution. Therefore, we introduce FunCanon, a framework that converts
long-horizon manipulation tasks into sequences of action chunks, each defined
by an actor, verb, and object. These chunks focus policy learning on the
actions themselves, rather than isolated tasks, enabling compositionality and
reuse. To make policies pose-aware and category-general, we perform functional
object canonicalization for functional alignment and automatic manipulation
trajectory transfer, mapping objects into shared functional frames using
affordance cues from large vision language models. An object centric and action
centric diffusion policy FuncDiffuser trained on this aligned data naturally
respects object affordances and poses, simplifying learning and improving
generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks
demonstrate category-level generalization, cross-task behavior reuse, and
robust sim2real deployment, showing that functional canonicalization provides a
strong inductive bias for scalable imitation learning in complex manipulation
domains. Details of the demo and supplemental material are available on our
project website https://sites.google.com/view/funcanon.

TL;DR: MATA是一种无需训练的方法，通过动态调整自注意力机制，让大型音频-语言模型更多地关注音频标记，解决音频-文本注意力不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型音频-语言模型在多模态融合层存在音频-文本注意力不平衡问题，过度偏向文本信息而忽视声学线索，导致音频推理任务性能不佳。

Method: MATA在原始注意力评分后介入，仅针对中间层的最后一个标记进行干预，无需额外参数或计算开销，动态推动模型更多地关注音频标记。

Result: 在MMAU和MMAR基准测试中，MATA表现出持续的性能提升，特别是在MMAR上使开源模型首次超越专有的Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: MATA为缓解注意力偏差提供了高效解决方案，并为增强多模态模型的音频处理能力开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) often suffer from audio-textual attention
imbalance, prioritizing text over acoustic information, particularly in the
multi-modal fusion layers of the Transformer architecture. This bias hinders
their ability to fully utilize acoustic cues, causing suboptimal performance on
audio reasoning tasks. To mitigate this, we propose \textbf{MATA}, a novel
training-free method that dynamically pushes LALMs to pay \textbf{M}ore
\textbf{A}ttention \textbf{T}o \textbf{A}udio tokens within the self-attention
mechanism. Specifically, MATA intervenes post raw attention scoring, targeting
only the last token in intermediate layers without introducing additional
parameters or computational overhead. Experiments on the MMAU and MMAR
benchmarks confirm MATA's effectiveness, with consistent performance gains.
Notably, on MMAR, MATA enables an open-source model to surpass the proprietary
Gemini 2.0 Flash for the first time. Our work provides an efficient solution to
mitigate attention bias and opens a new research direction for enhancing the
audio-processing capabilities of multi-modal models.

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对健康成人语音训练，无法有效处理儿童语音障碍患者的特殊语音特征，需要开发能够适应儿童语音障碍的语音重建技术。

Method: 使用解耦的、基于风格的文本到语音重建方法，特别关注音高和韵律的适应性，在STAR数据集上进行训练和评估。

Abstract: We present ChiReSSD, a speech reconstruction framework that preserves
children speaker's identity while suppressing mispronunciations. Unlike prior
approaches trained on healthy adult speech, ChiReSSD adapts to the voices of
children with speech sound disorders (SSD), with particular emphasis on pitch
and prosody. We evaluate our method on the STAR dataset and report substantial
improvements in lexical accuracy and speaker identity preservation.
Furthermore, we automatically predict the phonetic content in the original and
reconstructed pairs, where the proportion of corrected consonants is comparable
to the percentage of correct consonants (PCC), a clinical speech assessment
metric. Our experiments show Pearson correlation of 0.63 between automatic and
human expert annotations, highlighting the potential to reduce the manual
transcription burden. In addition, experiments on the TORGO dataset demonstrate
effective generalization for reconstructing adult dysarthric speech. Our
results indicate that disentangled, style-based TTS reconstruction can provide
identity-preserving speech across diverse clinical populations.

Motivation: 高维神经成像数据（如宽场钙成像和功能超声成像）包含丰富信息，但现有动态模型通常需要预处理步骤来获得低维表示，这可能丢弃行为相关信息并错过时空结构。

Result: 在宽场成像数据集上验证有效，并扩展到功能超声成像。模型在神经-行为预测方面优于现有模型。

Conclusion: SBIND为使用成像模态研究行为背后的神经机制提供了一个多功能工具。

Abstract: High-dimensional imaging of neural activity, such as widefield calcium and
functional ultrasound imaging, provide a rich source of information for
understanding the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Accurately
modeling neural dynamics in these modalities is crucial for understanding this
relationship but is hindered by the high-dimensionality, complex spatiotemporal
dependencies, and prevalent behaviorally irrelevant dynamics in these
modalities. Existing dynamical models often employ preprocessing steps to
obtain low-dimensional representations from neural image modalities. However,
this process can discard behaviorally relevant information and miss
spatiotemporal structure. We propose SBIND, a novel data-driven deep learning
framework to model spatiotemporal dependencies in neural images and disentangle
their behaviorally relevant dynamics from other neural dynamics. We validate
SBIND on widefield imaging datasets, and show its extension to functional
ultrasound imaging, a recent modality whose dynamical modeling has largely
remained unexplored. We find that our model effectively identifies both local
and long-range spatial dependencies across the brain while also dissociating
behaviorally relevant neural dynamics. Doing so, SBIND outperforms existing
models in neural-behavioral prediction. Overall, SBIND provides a versatile
tool for investigating the neural mechanisms underlying behavior using imaging
modalities.
