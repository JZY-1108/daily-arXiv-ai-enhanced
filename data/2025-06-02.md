### [1] [Meaning Is Not A Metric: Using LLMs to make cultural context legible at scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23785)
*Cody Kommers,Drew Hemment,Maria Antoniak,Joel Z. Leibo,Hoyt Long,Emily Robinson,Adam Sobey*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文主张利用大语言模型（LLM）通过“厚描述”捕捉文化背景和人类意义，解决传统AI系统依赖“薄描述”导致意义缺失的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI系统因依赖标准化数值表示（薄描述）而无法有效捕捉人类活动的文化背景和意义，而人文和社科领域的厚描述方法虽能保留意义，但难以规模化。

Method: 利用LLM的文本生成能力，部分自动化厚描述的生成与处理，以克服规模化难题。

Result: 提出厚描述作为新表征格式，并指出其在保留背景、多元解释、整合经验与批判视角、区分质与量、动态意义等方面的挑战。

Conclusion: 厚描述为生成式AI应用提供了关键方向，有望成为统一框架，解决LLM中文化表征的难题。

Abstract: This position paper argues that large language models (LLMs) can make
cultural context, and therefore human meaning, legible at an unprecedented
scale in AI-based sociotechnical systems. We argue that such systems have
previously been unable to represent human meaning because they rely on thin
descriptions: numerical representations that enforce standardization and
therefore strip human activity of the cultural context that gives it meaning.
By contrast, scholars in the humanities and qualitative social sciences have
developed frameworks for representing meaning through thick description: verbal
representations that accommodate heterogeneity and retain contextual
information needed to represent human meaning. While these methods can
effectively codify meaning, they are difficult to deploy at scale. However, the
verbal capabilities of LLMs now provide a means of (at least partially)
automating the generation and processing of thick descriptions, potentially
overcoming this bottleneck. We argue that the problem of rendering human
meaning legible is not just about selecting better metrics, but about
developing new representational formats (based on thick description). We frame
this as a crucial direction for the application of generative AI and identify
five key challenges: preserving context, maintaining interpretive pluralism,
integrating perspectives based on lived experience and critical distance,
distinguishing qualitative content from quantitative magnitude, and
acknowledging meaning as dynamic rather than static. Furthermore, we suggest
that thick description has the potential to serve as a unifying framework to
address a number of emerging concerns about the difficulties of representing
culture in (or using) LLMs.

### [2] [Nine Ways to Break Copyright Law and Why Our LLM Won't: A Fair Use Aligned Generation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23788)
*Aakash Sen Sharma,Debdeep Sanyal,Priyansh Srivastava,Sundar Atreya H.,Shirish Karande,Mohan Kankanhalli,Murari Mandal*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FUA-LLM框架通过FairUseDB数据集和DPO优化，减少LLM版权侵权风险，同时保持实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在生成内容时可能侵犯版权的问题，避免传统拒绝式过滤的实用性损失。

Method: 构建FairUseDB数据集，应用DPO优化开源LLM，提出新评估指标Weighted Penalty Utility和CAH。

Result: FUA-LLM显著减少侵权输出（达20%），同时保持实用性。

Conclusion: FUA-LLM为LLM版权问题提供了合法且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) commonly risk copyright infringement by
reproducing protected content verbatim or with insufficient transformative
modifications, posing significant ethical, legal, and practical concerns.
Current inference-time safeguards predominantly rely on restrictive
refusal-based filters, often compromising the practical utility of these
models. To address this, we collaborated closely with intellectual property
experts to develop FUA-LLM (Fair Use Aligned Language Models), a
legally-grounded framework explicitly designed to align LLM outputs with
fair-use doctrine. Central to our method is FairUseDB, a carefully constructed
dataset containing 18,000 expert-validated examples covering nine realistic
infringement scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we apply Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune open-source LLMs, encouraging them to produce
legally compliant and practically useful alternatives rather than resorting to
blunt refusal. Recognizing the shortcomings of traditional evaluation metrics,
we propose new measures: Weighted Penalty Utility and Compliance Aware Harmonic
Mean (CAH) to balance infringement risk against response utility. Extensive
quantitative experiments coupled with expert evaluations confirm that FUA-LLM
substantially reduces problematic outputs (up to 20\%) compared to
state-of-the-art approaches, while preserving real-world usability.

### [3] [Conversational Exploration of Literature Landscape with LitChat](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23789)
*Mingyu Huang,Shasha Zhou,Yuxuan Chen,Ke Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LitChat是一种交互式文献代理，结合LLM和数据驱动工具，帮助用户快速探索大规模文献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统文献综述方法在大数据时代下的局限性，提供更全面、客观的文献分析。

Method: 结合LLM和数据挖掘工具，自动解析用户查询、检索文献、构建知识图谱，生成基于证据的见解。

Result: 通过AI4Health案例验证，LitChat能高效导航大规模文献，提供传统方法无法实现的证据支持。

Conclusion: LitChat为文献探索提供了高效、数据驱动的解决方案，弥补了LLM在系统综述中的不足。

Abstract: We are living in an era of "big literature", where the volume of digital
scientific publications is growing exponentially. While offering new
opportunities, this also poses challenges for understanding literature
landscapes, as traditional manual reviewing is no longer feasible. Recent large
language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities for literature
comprehension, yet they are incapable of offering "comprehensive, objective,
open and transparent" views desired by systematic reviews due to their limited
context windows and trust issues like hallucinations. Here we present LitChat,
an end-to-end, interactive and conversational literature agent that augments
LLM agents with data-driven discovery tools to facilitate literature
exploration. LitChat automatically interprets user queries, retrieves relevant
sources, constructs knowledge graphs, and employs diverse data-mining
techniques to generate evidence-based insights addressing user needs. We
illustrate the effectiveness of LitChat via a case study on AI4Health,
highlighting its capacity to quickly navigate the users through large-scale
literature landscape with data-based evidence that is otherwise infeasible with
traditional means.

### [4] [Rethinking the Understanding Ability across LLMs through Mutual Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23790)
*Shaojie Wang,Sirui Ding,Na Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于互信息（MI）的信息论框架，用于评估大型语言模型（LLM）的语言理解能力，通过句子级和词级MI量化信息保留效果，并揭示了不同模型的信息保真度差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在自然语言处理中取得显著进展，但其内在语言理解能力的评估仍具挑战性。

Method: 通过互信息框架，将句子级MI分解为词级MI，并利用Fano不等式推导可计算的下界，实现词级可恢复性任务。

Result: 编码器模型比解码器模型具有更高的信息保真度，后者表现出独特的后期“遗忘”模式；通过优化词级可恢复性，可提升模型的无监督任务表现。

Conclusion: 互信息可作为理解和改进语言模型能力的基础，优化词级可恢复性有助于提升模型的语言理解能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural
language processing, yet evaluating their intrinsic linguistic understanding
remains challenging. Moving beyond specialized evaluation tasks, we propose an
information-theoretic framework grounded in mutual information (MI) to achieve
this. We formalize the understanding as MI between an input sentence and its
latent representation (sentence-level MI), measuring how effectively input
information is preserved in latent representation. Given that LLMs learn
embeddings for individual tokens, we decompose sentence-level MI into
token-level MI between tokens and sentence embeddings, establishing theoretical
bounds connecting these measures. Based on this foundation, we theoretically
derive a computable lower bound for token-level MI using Fano's inequality,
which directly relates to token-level recoverability-the ability to predict
original tokens from sentence embedding. We implement this recoverability task
to comparatively measure MI across different LLMs, revealing that encoder-only
models consistently maintain higher information fidelity than their
decoder-only counterparts, with the latter exhibiting a distinctive late-layer
"forgetting" pattern where mutual information is first enhanced and then
discarded. Moreover, fine-tuning to maximize token-level recoverability
consistently improves understanding ability of LLMs on tasks without
task-specific supervision, demonstrating that mutual information can serve as a
foundation for understanding and improving language model capabilities.

### [5] [R3-RAG: Learning Step-by-Step Reasoning and Retrieval for LLMs via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23794)
*Yuan Li,Qi Luo,Xiaonan Li,Bufan Li,Qinyuan Cheng,Bo Wang,Yining Zheng,Yuxin Wang,Zhangyue Yin,Xipeng Qiu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: R3-RAG通过强化学习让LLM学会逐步推理和检索，提升RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决密集检索器在RAG系统中的瓶颈问题，如参数限制和无法逐步推理。

Method: 分两阶段：冷启动学习推理与检索交替，强化学习优化检索能力。提出两种奖励：答案正确性和文档相关性。

Result: R3-RAG显著优于基线方法，并能适应不同检索器。

Conclusion: R3-RAG通过强化学习有效提升RAG系统的推理和检索能力。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge with Large
Language Models (LLMs) to enhance factual correctness and mitigate
hallucination. However, dense retrievers often become the bottleneck of RAG
systems due to their limited parameters compared to LLMs and their inability to
perform step-by-step reasoning. While prompt-based iterative RAG attempts to
address these limitations, it is constrained by human-designed workflows. To
address these limitations, we propose $\textbf{R3-RAG}$, which uses
$\textbf{R}$einforcement learning to make the LLM learn how to
$\textbf{R}$eason and $\textbf{R}$etrieve step by step, thus retrieving
comprehensive external knowledge and leading to correct answers. R3-RAG is
divided into two stages. We first use cold start to make the model learn the
manner of iteratively interleaving reasoning and retrieval. Then we use
reinforcement learning to further harness its ability to better explore the
external retrieval environment. Specifically, we propose two rewards for
R3-RAG: 1) answer correctness for outcome reward, which judges whether the
trajectory leads to a correct answer; 2) relevance-based document verification
for process reward, encouraging the model to retrieve documents that are
relevant to the user question, through which we can let the model learn how to
iteratively reason and retrieve relevant documents to get the correct answer.
Experimental results show that R3-RAG significantly outperforms baselines and
can transfer well to different retrievers. We release R3-RAG at
https://github.com/Yuan-Li-FNLP/R3-RAG.

### [6] [Emergent LLM behaviors are observationally equivalent to data leakage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23796)
*Christopher Barrie,Petter Törnberg*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文指出Ashery等人的研究结果可能是由于数据泄漏，而非LLMs自发形成语言规范。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑Ashery等人关于LLMs在命名游戏中自发形成语言规范的结论，提出数据泄漏的解释。

Method: 通过多分析证明LLMs识别游戏结构并回忆训练数据，而非形成新规范。

Result: 观察到的行为与训练数据记忆无区别，不支持“涌现”规范的结论。

Conclusion: 建议探索其他策略，并反思LLMs在社会科学模型中的适用性。

Abstract: Ashery et al. recently argue that large language models (LLMs), when paired
to play a classic "naming game," spontaneously develop linguistic conventions
reminiscent of human social norms. Here, we show that their results are better
explained by data leakage: the models simply reproduce conventions they already
encountered during pre-training. Despite the authors' mitigation measures, we
provide multiple analyses demonstrating that the LLMs recognize the structure
of the coordination game and recall its outcomes, rather than exhibit
"emergent" conventions. Consequently, the observed behaviors are
indistinguishable from memorization of the training corpus. We conclude by
pointing to potential alternative strategies and reflecting more generally on
the place of LLMs for social science models.

*Zaihan Yang,Ryan Leonard,Hien Tran,Rory Driscoll,Chadbourne Davis*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合RoBERTa、TF-IDF和PCA的混合模型，用于从Reddit帖子中自动分类自杀风险等级，并通过数据重采样和增强技术提高模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀风险早期检测工具的迫切需求促使研究者开发更准确的机器学习模型。

Method: 采用RoBERTa-TF-IDF-PCA混合模型，结合深度上下文嵌入和统计特征，并通过数据重采样和增强解决数据不平衡和过拟合问题。

Result: 混合模型在加权F1分数上达到0.7512，优于单独使用RoBERTa、BERT及其他传统分类器。

Conclusion: 该混合模型在自杀风险分类任务中表现出更高的准确性和可靠性，为早期检测提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Suicidal thoughts and behaviors are increasingly recognized as a critical
societal concern, highlighting the urgent need for effective tools to enable
early detection of suicidal risk. In this work, we develop robust machine
learning models that leverage Reddit posts to automatically classify them into
four distinct levels of suicide risk severity. We frame this as a multi-class
classification task and propose a RoBERTa-TF-IDF-PCA Hybrid model, integrating
the deep contextual embeddings from Robustly Optimized BERT Approach (RoBERTa),
a state-of-the-art deep learning transformer model, with the statistical
term-weighting of TF-IDF, further compressed with PCA, to boost the accuracy
and reliability of suicide risk assessment. To address data imbalance and
overfitting, we explore various data resampling techniques and data
augmentation strategies to enhance model generalization. Additionally, we
compare our model's performance against that of using RoBERTa only, the BERT
model and other traditional machine learning classifiers. Experimental results
demonstrate that the hybrid model can achieve improved performance, giving a
best weighted $F_{1}$ score of 0.7512.

### [8] [My Answer Is NOT 'Fair': Mitigating Social Bias in Vision-Language Models via Fair and Biased Residuals](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23798)
*Jian Lan,Yifei Fu,Udo Schlegel,Gengyuan Zhang,Tanveer Hannan,Haokun Chen,Thomas Seidl*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估并缓解了大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）中的社会偏见，发现模型在生成响应中存在性别和种族偏见，并提出了一种无需训练的后处理方法以减轻偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社会偏见是大型视觉语言模型中的关键问题，公平性和伦理问题可能对社会特定群体造成伤害。研究旨在评估和缓解这种偏见。

Method: 研究首先在PAIRS和SocialCounterfactuals数据集上评估了四种最先进的VLMs，发现模型存在偏见后，提出了一种通过调整隐藏层残差的后处理方法。

Result: 模型在生成响应中表现出性别和种族偏见，且置信度校准不准确。后处理方法显著提高了公平性和置信度可靠性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs中的社会偏见问题，并提出了一种有效的后处理方法，为模型公平性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Social bias is a critical issue in large vision-language models (VLMs), where
fairness- and ethics-related problems harm certain groups of people in society.
It is unknown to what extent VLMs yield social bias in generative responses. In
this study, we focus on evaluating and mitigating social bias on both the
model's response and probability distribution. To do so, we first evaluate four
state-of-the-art VLMs on PAIRS and SocialCounterfactuals datasets with the
multiple-choice selection task. Surprisingly, we find that models suffer from
generating gender-biased or race-biased responses. We also observe that models
are prone to stating their responses are fair, but indeed having mis-calibrated
confidence levels towards particular social groups. While investigating why
VLMs are unfair in this study, we observe that VLMs' hidden layers exhibit
substantial fluctuations in fairness levels. Meanwhile, residuals in each layer
show mixed effects on fairness, with some contributing positively while some
lead to increased bias. Based on these findings, we propose a post-hoc method
for the inference stage to mitigate social bias, which is training-free and
model-agnostic. We achieve this by ablating bias-associated residuals while
amplifying fairness-associated residuals on model hidden layers during
inference. We demonstrate that our post-hoc method outperforms the competing
training strategies, helping VLMs have fairer responses and more reliable
confidence levels.

### [9] [Estimating LLM Consistency: A User Baseline vs Surrogate Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23799)
*Xiaoyuan Wu,Weiran Lin,Omer Akgul,Lujo Bauer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）生成文本的一致性问题，提出了一种基于logit的集成方法，发现现有方法难以准确反映人类对一致性的感知，建议更多依赖人类评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM易产生幻觉且对提示扰动敏感，导致生成文本不一致或不可靠。现有的一致性测量方法未能很好地反映人类感知。

Method: 通过用户研究（n=2,976）评估现有方法，并提出一种基于logit的集成方法。

Result: 新方法在估计人类对一致性的评分上表现最佳，但现有无人类评估的方法仍不完美。

Conclusion: 建议在评估LLM一致性时更多依赖人类输入，而非仅依赖自动化方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations and sensitive to
prompt perturbations, often resulting in inconsistent or unreliable generated
text. Different methods have been proposed to mitigate such hallucinations and
fragility -- one of them being measuring the consistency (the model's
confidence in the response, or likelihood of generating a similar response when
resampled) of LLM responses. In previous work, measuring consistency often
relied on the probability of a response appearing within a pool of resampled
responses, or internal states or logits of responses. However, it is not yet
clear how well these approaches approximate how humans perceive the consistency
of LLM responses. We performed a user study (n=2,976) and found current methods
typically do not approximate users' perceptions of LLM consistency very well.
We propose a logit-based ensemble method for estimating LLM consistency, and we
show that this method matches the performance of the best-performing existing
metric in estimating human ratings of LLM consistency. Our results suggest that
methods of estimating LLM consistency without human evaluation are sufficiently
imperfect that we suggest evaluation with human input be more broadly used.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SEMFED是一种针对异构NLP任务的语义感知资源高效联邦学习框架，通过语义感知客户端选择、自适应模型架构和通信高效特征压缩，显著降低通信成本并保持高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在NLP任务中面临语义异构、词汇不匹配和设备资源限制等挑战，SEMFED旨在解决这些问题。

Method: SEMFED采用语义感知客户端选择、自适应NLP模型架构和语义特征压缩技术。

Result: 实验显示SEMFED通信成本降低80.5%，模型准确性保持在98%以上。

Conclusion: SEMFED能有效管理异构客户端环境，适用于实际联邦NLP部署。

Abstract: Background: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
training machine learning models while preserving data privacy. However,
applying FL to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks presents unique
challenges due to semantic heterogeneity across clients, vocabulary mismatches,
and varying resource constraints on edge devices. Objectives: This paper
introduces SEMFED, a novel semantic-aware resource-efficient federated learning
framework specifically designed for heterogeneous NLP tasks. Methods: SEMFED
incorporates three key innovations: (1) a semantic-aware client selection
mechanism that balances semantic diversity with resource constraints, (2)
adaptive NLP-specific model architectures tailored to device capabilities while
preserving semantic information, and (3) a communication-efficient semantic
feature compression technique that significantly reduces bandwidth
requirements. Results: Experimental results on various NLP classification tasks
demonstrate that SEMFED achieves an 80.5% reduction in communication costs
while maintaining model accuracy above 98%, outperforming state-of-the-art FL
approaches. Conclusion: SEMFED effectively manages heterogeneous client
environments with varying computational resources, network reliability, and
semantic data distributions, making it particularly suitable for real-world
federated NLP deployments.

TL;DR: MedHELM是一个评估大型语言模型（LLM）在医疗任务中性能的框架，包含分类法、基准套件和改进的评估方法，揭示了模型在不同任务中的表现差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法未能反映真实临床实践的复杂性和多样性，需要更全面的评估框架。

Method: 开发了临床验证的分类法、全面的基准套件，并使用LLM-jury方法进行系统评估。

Result: 高级推理模型表现最佳，但Claude 3.5 Sonnet在成本效益上更优；不同任务中模型表现差异显著。

Conclusion: MedHELM为医疗LLM提供了更真实的评估方法，强调了任务特异性评估的重要性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve near-perfect scores on medical
licensing exams, these evaluations inadequately reflect the complexity and
diversity of real-world clinical practice. We introduce MedHELM, an extensible
evaluation framework for assessing LLM performance for medical tasks with three
key contributions. First, a clinician-validated taxonomy spanning 5 categories,
22 subcategories, and 121 tasks developed with 29 clinicians. Second, a
comprehensive benchmark suite comprising 35 benchmarks (17 existing, 18 newly
formulated) providing complete coverage of all categories and subcategories in
the taxonomy. Third, a systematic comparison of LLMs with improved evaluation
methods (using an LLM-jury) and a cost-performance analysis. Evaluation of 9
frontier LLMs, using the 35 benchmarks, revealed significant performance
variation. Advanced reasoning models (DeepSeek R1: 66% win-rate; o3-mini: 64%
win-rate) demonstrated superior performance, though Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved
comparable results at 40% lower estimated computational cost. On a normalized
accuracy scale (0-1), most models performed strongly in Clinical Note
Generation (0.73-0.85) and Patient Communication & Education (0.78-0.83),
moderately in Medical Research Assistance (0.65-0.75), and generally lower in
Clinical Decision Support (0.56-0.72) and Administration & Workflow
(0.53-0.63). Our LLM-jury evaluation method achieved good agreement with
clinician ratings (ICC = 0.47), surpassing both average clinician-clinician
agreement (ICC = 0.43) and automated baselines including ROUGE-L (0.36) and
BERTScore-F1 (0.44). Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved comparable performance to top
models at lower estimated cost. These findings highlight the importance of
real-world, task-specific evaluation for medical use of LLMs and provides an
open source framework to enable this.

*Terrance Liu,Shuyi Wang,Daniel Preotiuc-Pietro,Yash Chandarana,Chirag Gupta*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何为基于LLM的text-to-SQL解析提供校准的置信度分数，提出了一种结合子句频率（SCF）和多元Platt缩放（MPS）的方法，显著提升了校准效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在text-to-SQL解析中表现优异，但有时会自信地给出错误答案，因此需要可靠的置信度评分以提高系统可信度。

Method: 提出子句频率（SCF）评分方法，利用SQL查询的结构化特性提供更细粒度的正确性信号，并结合多元Platt缩放（MPS）生成校准的置信度分数。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，SCF与MPS结合的方法在校准和错误检测任务中优于传统Platt缩放。

Conclusion: 通过SCF和MPS的结合，论文提供了一种更准确且校准的置信度评分方法，提升了text-to-SQL系统的可靠性。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on text-to-SQL
parsing, they sometimes exhibit unexpected failures in which they are
confidently incorrect. Building trustworthy text-to-SQL systems thus requires
eliciting reliable uncertainty measures from the LLM. In this paper, we study
the problem of providing a calibrated confidence score that conveys the
likelihood of an output query being correct. Our work is the first to establish
a benchmark for post-hoc calibration of LLM-based text-to-SQL parsing. In
particular, we show that Platt scaling, a canonical method for calibration,
provides substantial improvements over directly using raw model output
probabilities as confidence scores. Furthermore, we propose a method for
text-to-SQL calibration that leverages the structured nature of SQL queries to
provide more granular signals of correctness, named "sub-clause frequency"
(SCF) scores. Using multivariate Platt scaling (MPS), our extension of the
canonical Platt scaling technique, we combine individual SCF scores into an
overall accurate and calibrated score. Empirical evaluation on two popular
text-to-SQL datasets shows that our approach of combining MPS and SCF yields
further improvements in calibration and the related task of error detection
over traditional Platt scaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决临床环境中大型语言模型（LLM）部署时的隐私与性能矛盾：云端LLM性能强但隐私风险高，本地LLM隐私安全但性能不足。

Method: 提出MedOrchestra框架，云端LLM分解任务并生成提示，本地LLM执行隐私保护任务，结合临床指南和合成测试案例验证。

Result: 在胰腺癌分期任务中，MedOrchestra在自由文本报告上准确率达70.21%，结构化报告达85.42%，优于本地模型和临床医生。

Conclusion: MedOrchestra有效平衡隐私与性能，显著提升临床任务处理能力，适用于复杂医疗场景。

Abstract: Deploying large language models (LLMs) in clinical settings faces critical
trade-offs: cloud LLMs, with their extensive parameters and superior
performance, pose risks to sensitive clinical data privacy, while local LLMs
preserve privacy but often fail at complex clinical interpretation tasks. We
propose MedOrchestra, a hybrid framework where a cloud LLM decomposes complex
clinical tasks into manageable subtasks and prompt generation, while a local
LLM executes these subtasks in a privacy-preserving manner. Without accessing
clinical data, the cloud LLM generates and validates subtask prompts using
clinical guidelines and synthetic test cases. The local LLM executes subtasks
locally and synthesizes outputs generated by the cloud LLM. We evaluate
MedOrchestra on pancreatic cancer staging using 100 radiology reports under
NCCN guidelines. On free-text reports, MedOrchestra achieves 70.21% accuracy,
outperforming local model baselines (without guideline: 48.94%, with guideline:
56.59%) and board-certified clinicians (gastroenterologists: 59.57%, surgeons:
65.96%, radiologists: 55.32%). On structured reports, MedOrchestra reaches
85.42% accuracy, showing clear superiority across all settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态分层剪枝方法（DLP），通过结合模型权重和输入激活信息自适应确定每层重要性，显著提升了高稀疏度下LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流剪枝技术依赖统一分层策略，导致高稀疏度下性能下降。不同层对LLMs贡献不同，但现有非均匀分层方法依赖预定义值，性能次优。

Method: 提出DLP方法，动态确定每层重要性并分配剪枝率，结合模型权重和输入激活信息。

Result: 在70%稀疏度下，DLP将LLaMA2-7B的困惑度降低7.79，平均准确率提升2.7%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DLP在高稀疏度下有效保持性能，兼容现有LLM压缩技术，并支持PEFT。

Abstract: Pruning has recently been widely adopted to reduce the parameter scale and
improve the inference efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs). Mainstream
pruning techniques often rely on uniform layerwise pruning strategies, which
can lead to severe performance degradation at high sparsity levels. Recognizing
the varying contributions of different layers in LLMs, recent studies have
shifted their focus toward non-uniform layerwise pruning. However, these
approaches often rely on pre-defined values, which can result in suboptimal
performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called
Dynamic Layerwise Pruning (DLP). This approach adaptively determines the
relative importance of each layer by integrating model weights with input
activation information, assigning pruning rates accordingly. Experimental
results show that DLP effectively preserves model performance at high sparsity
levels across multiple LLMs. Specifically, at 70% sparsity, DLP reduces the
perplexity of LLaMA2-7B by 7.79 and improves the average accuracy by 2.7%
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, DLP is compatible with various
existing LLM compression techniques and can be seamlessly integrated into
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT). We release the code at
https://github.com/ironartisan/DLP to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: DenseLoRA是一种改进的低秩适应方法，通过单编码器-解码器优化隐藏表示，减少参数冗余，提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA方法存在参数冗余问题，限制了大型语言模型的高效适应。

Method: DenseLoRA采用单编码器-解码器压缩隐藏表示，并使用密集低秩矩阵替代LoRA的双矩阵结构。

Result: DenseLoRA在LLaMA3-8B上仅用0.01%可训练参数达到83.8%准确率，优于LoRA的80.8%（0.70%参数）。

Conclusion: DenseLoRA显著提升了参数利用率和适应效率，为大型语言模型的高效适应提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has been developed as an efficient approach for
adapting large language models (LLMs) by fine-tuning two low-rank matrices,
thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters. However, prior research
indicates that many of the weights in these matrices are redundant, leading to
inefficiencies in parameter utilization. To address this limitation, we
introduce Dense Low-Rank Adaptation (DenseLoRA), a novel approach that enhances
parameter efficiency while achieving superior performance compared to LoRA.
DenseLoRA builds upon the concept of representation fine-tuning, incorporating
a single Encoder-Decoder to refine and compress hidden representations across
all adaptation layers before applying adaptation. Instead of relying on two
redundant low-rank matrices as in LoRA, DenseLoRA adapts LLMs through a dense
low-rank matrix, improving parameter utilization and adaptation efficiency. We
evaluate DenseLoRA on various benchmarks, showing that it achieves 83.8%
accuracy with only 0.01% of trainable parameters, compared to LoRA's 80.8%
accuracy with 0.70% of trainable parameters on LLaMA3-8B. Additionally, we
conduct extensive experiments to systematically assess the impact of
DenseLoRA's components on overall model performance. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有基准无法全面反映LLMs在处理复杂多轮对话（如动机转移和跨轮依赖）时的弱点，因此设计了MARS-Bench。

Method: 基于实时文本评论构建MARS-Bench，评估多轮对话的三个关键方面：超多轮、交互多轮和跨轮任务。

Result: 闭源LLMs表现优于开源模型，显式推理提升鲁棒性，但LLMs在动机转移和跨轮依赖上仍有困难。注意力可视化实验揭示了性能下降的机制。

Conclusion: MARS-Bench填补了现有基准的空白，揭示了LLMs在复杂对话中的挑战，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (\textbf{LLMs}), e.g. ChatGPT, have been widely adopted
in real-world dialogue applications. However, LLMs' robustness, especially in
handling long complex dialogue sessions, including frequent motivation
transfer, sophisticated cross-turn dependency, is criticized all along.
Nevertheless, no existing benchmarks can fully reflect these weaknesses. We
present \textbf{MARS-Bench}, a \textbf{M}ulti-turn \textbf{A}thletic
\textbf{R}eal-world \textbf{S}cenario Dialogue \textbf{Bench}mark, designed to
remedy the gap. MARS-Bench is constructed from play-by-play text commentary so
to feature realistic dialogues specifically designed to evaluate three critical
aspects of multi-turn conversations: Ultra Multi-turn, Interactive Multi-turn,
and Cross-turn Tasks. Extensive experiments on MARS-Bench also reveal that
closed-source LLMs significantly outperform open-source alternatives, explicit
reasoning significantly boosts LLMs' robustness on handling long complex
dialogue sessions, and LLMs indeed face significant challenges when handling
motivation transfer and sophisticated cross-turn dependency. Moreover, we
provide mechanistic interpretability on how attention sinks due to special
tokens lead to LLMs' performance degradation when handling long complex
dialogue sessions based on attention visualization experiment in
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruction.

TL;DR: 论文提出LayerIF框架，通过数据驱动方法量化预训练大语言模型各层的训练质量，提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在不同任务中表现不一，现有方法忽视数据影响，需更精准的层间训练质量评估。

Method: 利用影响函数（Influence Functions）计算层间梯度敏感性，量化各层对验证损失的贡献。

Result: 实验证明LayerIF能有效分配专家资源（LoRA-MoE）和稀疏化层（LLM剪枝），提升任务性能。

Conclusion: LayerIF为模型无关的任务敏感层重要性评估提供新思路，显著优化下游应用。

Abstract: Pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong performance across a
wide range of tasks, yet exhibit substantial variability in the various layers'
training quality with respect to specific downstream applications, limiting
their downstream performance.It is therefore critical to estimate layer-wise
training quality in a manner that accounts for both model architecture and
training data. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on model-centric
heuristics (such as spectral statistics, outlier detection, or uniform
allocation) while overlooking the influence of data. To address these
limitations, we propose LayerIF, a data-driven framework that leverages
Influence Functions to quantify the training quality of individual layers in a
principled and task-sensitive manner. By isolating each layer's gradients and
measuring the sensitivity of the validation loss to training examples by
computing layer-wise influences, we derive data-driven estimates of layer
importance. Notably, our method produces task-specific layer importance
estimates for the same LLM, revealing how layers specialize for different
test-time evaluation tasks. We demonstrate the utility of our scores by
leveraging them for two downstream applications: (a) expert allocation in
LoRA-MoE architectures and (b) layer-wise sparsity distribution for LLM
pruning. Experiments across multiple LLM architectures demonstrate that our
model-agnostic, influence-guided allocation leads to consistent gains in task
performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SPLAENet的新方法，通过双交叉注意力和情感感知网络改进社交媒体中立场检测，显著提升了准确率和F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体中用户生成内容隐含大量观点和错误信息，立场检测成为分析偏见和对抗错误信息的关键方法。

Method: 采用双交叉注意力机制和分层注意力网络，结合情感分析和标签融合技术，提升立场检测的准确性。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，准确率和F1分数分别提升8.92%-10.03%和10.92%-17.36%。

Conclusion: SPLAENet在错误信息社交媒体内容中的立场检测方面表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of social media has generated an overwhelming volume of
user-generated content, conveying implicit opinions and contributing to the
spread of misinformation. The method aims to enhance the detection of stance
where misinformation can polarize user opinions. Stance detection has emerged
as a crucial approach to effectively analyze underlying biases in shared
information and combating misinformation. This paper proposes a novel method
for \textbf{S}tance \textbf{P}rediction through a \textbf{L}abel-fused dual
cross-\textbf{A}ttentive \textbf{E}motion-aware neural \textbf{Net}work
(SPLAENet) in misinformative social media user-generated content. The proposed
method employs a dual cross-attention mechanism and a hierarchical attention
network to capture inter and intra-relationships by focusing on the relevant
parts of source text in the context of reply text and vice versa. We
incorporate emotions to effectively distinguish between different stance
categories by leveraging the emotional alignment or divergence between the
texts. We also employ label fusion that uses distance-metric learning to align
extracted features with stance labels, improving the method's ability to
accurately distinguish between stances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
significant improvements achieved by SPLAENet over existing state-of-the-art
methods. SPLAENet demonstrates an average gain of 8.92\% in accuracy and
17.36\% in F1-score on the RumourEval dataset. On the SemEval dataset, it
achieves average gains of 7.02\% in accuracy and 10.92\% in F1-score. On the
P-stance dataset, it demonstrates average gains of 10.03\% in accuracy and
11.18\% in F1-score. These results validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method for stance detection in the context of misinformative social media
content.

TL;DR: PROSE方法通过迭代优化和验证用户偏好描述，显著提升了LLM代理对人类偏好的捕捉能力，比现有方法CIPHER提高了33%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法生成的偏好描述过于通用，无法捕捉人类偏好的独特性和个体化特征。

Method: PROSE结合了迭代优化偏好描述和跨多个用户写作样本验证偏好。

Result: PROSE在总结和邮件写作任务中显著优于CIPHER，提升33%；与ICL结合可额外提升9%。

Conclusion: PROSE能更精准地推断人类偏好，提升LLM代理的个性化交互效果。

Abstract: Accommodating human preferences is essential for creating aligned LLM agents
that deliver personalized and effective interactions. Recent work has shown the
potential for LLMs acting as writing agents to infer a description of user
preferences. Agent alignment then comes from conditioning on the inferred
preference description. However, existing methods often produce generic
preference descriptions that fail to capture the unique and individualized
nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PROSE, a method designed to
enhance the precision of preference descriptions inferred from user writing
samples. PROSE incorporates two key elements: (1) iterative refinement of
inferred preferences, and (2) verification of inferred preferences across
multiple user writing samples. We evaluate PROSE with several LLMs (i.e.,
Qwen2.5 7B and 72B Instruct, GPT-mini, and GPT-4o) on a summarization and an
email writing task. We find that PROSE more accurately infers nuanced human
preferences, improving the quality of the writing agent's generations over
CIPHER (a state-of-the-art method for inferring preferences) by 33\%. Lastly,
we demonstrate that ICL and PROSE are complementary methods, and combining them
provides up to a 9\% improvement over ICL alone.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大语言模型（LLM）在用户目标对齐（steerability）方面的表现，发现当前模型在覆盖率、校准和副作用方面存在问题，并提出评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在推理和指令遵循方面表现优异，但其是否能可靠地满足多样化的用户目标尚不明确。

Method: 引入基于多维目标空间的框架，将用户目标和LLM输出建模为向量，评估文本重写任务中的表现。

Result: 当前LLM在steerability方面表现不佳，干预措施效果有限，副作用问题突出。

Conclusion: 现有LLM在steerability上仍有不足，需进一步改进对齐策略。

Abstract: Despite advances in large language models (LLMs) on reasoning and
instruction-following benchmarks, it remains unclear whether they can reliably
produce outputs aligned with a broad variety of user goals, a concept we refer
to as steerability. The abundance of methods proposed to modify LLM behavior
makes it unclear whether current LLMs are already steerable, or require further
intervention. In particular, LLMs may exhibit (i) poor coverage, where rare
user goals are underrepresented; (ii) miscalibration, where models overshoot
requests; and (iii) side effects, where changes to one dimension of text
inadvertently affect others. To systematically evaluate these failures, we
introduce a framework based on a multi-dimensional goal space that models user
goals and LLM outputs as vectors with dimensions corresponding to text
attributes (e.g., reading difficulty). Applied to a text-rewriting task, we
find that current LLMs struggle with steerability, as side effects are
persistent. Interventions to improve steerability, such as prompt engineering,
best-of-$N$ sampling, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning, have varying
effectiveness, yet side effects remain problematic. Our findings suggest that
even strong LLMs struggle with steerability, and existing alignment strategies
may be insufficient. We open-source our steerability evaluation framework at
https://github.com/MLD3/steerability.

Motivation: 解决现有自动评分方法在格式限制、评分透明度和实际应用多样性上的不足。

Method: 利用生成AI模型和数学框架，支持多样化评分标准，并生成结构化解释。

Result: 在真实课程数据上验证，RATAS表现出高可靠性和准确性，同时提供透明反馈。

Conclusion: RATAS为自动评分提供了高效、透明且广泛适用的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated answer grading is a critical challenge in educational technology,
with the potential to streamline assessment processes, ensure grading
consistency, and provide timely feedback to students. However, existing
approaches are often constrained to specific exam formats, lack
interpretability in score assignment, and struggle with real-world
applicability across diverse subjects and assessment types. To address these
limitations, we introduce RATAS (Rubric Automated Tree-based Answer Scoring), a
novel framework that leverages state-of-the-art generative AI models for
rubric-based grading of textual responses. RATAS is designed to support a wide
range of grading rubrics, enable subject-agnostic evaluation, and generate
structured, explainable rationales for assigned scores. We formalize the
automatic grading task through a mathematical framework tailored to
rubric-based assessment and present an architecture capable of handling
complex, real-world exam structures. To rigorously evaluate our approach, we
construct a unique, contextualized dataset derived from real-world
project-based courses, encompassing diverse response formats and varying levels
of complexity. Empirical results demonstrate that RATAS achieves high
reliability and accuracy in automated grading while providing interpretable
feedback that enhances transparency for both students and nstructors.

Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地替代人类进行对齐任务，研究其在人类意见分歧场景下的表现成为必要。

Result: LLMs在开放答案生成中能提供细致评估，但在评判或辩论无共识话题时倾向于采取立场。

Conclusion: 需要更复杂的方法对齐LLMs，因其无法完全捕捉人类在分歧话题上的多样性。

Abstract: The increasing use of LLMs as substitutes for humans in ``aligning'' LLMs has
raised questions about their ability to replicate human judgments and
preferences, especially in ambivalent scenarios where humans disagree. This
study examines the biases and limitations of LLMs in three roles: answer
generator, judge, and debater. These roles loosely correspond to previously
described alignment frameworks: preference alignment (judge) and scalable
oversight (debater), with the answer generator reflecting the typical setting
with user interactions. We develop a ``no-consensus'' benchmark by curating
examples that encompass a variety of a priori ambivalent scenarios, each
presenting two possible stances. Our results show that while LLMs can provide
nuanced assessments when generating open-ended answers, they tend to take a
stance on no-consensus topics when employed as judges or debaters. These
findings underscore the necessity for more sophisticated methods for aligning
LLMs without human oversight, highlighting that LLMs cannot fully capture human
disagreement even on topics where humans themselves are divided.

Motivation: 抑郁检测通常仅关注单一模态的语音数据，而多模态和多任务学习能提供更全面的信息，尤其是青少年抑郁常伴随多种并发症。

Conclusion: 多模态、多任务学习和纵向分析的结合显著提升了抑郁检测的准确性，为心理健康研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Speech is a noninvasive digital phenotype that can offer valuable insights
into mental health conditions, but it is often treated as a single modality. In
contrast, we propose the treatment of patient speech data as a trimodal
multimedia data source for depression detection. This study explores the
potential of large language model-based architectures for speech-based
depression prediction in a multimodal regime that integrates speech-derived
text, acoustic landmarks, and vocal biomarkers. Adolescent depression presents
a significant challenge and is often comorbid with multiple disorders, such as
suicidal ideation and sleep disturbances. This presents an additional
opportunity to integrate multi-task learning (MTL) into our study by
simultaneously predicting depression, suicidal ideation, and sleep disturbances
using the multimodal formulation. We also propose a longitudinal analysis
strategy that models temporal changes across multiple clinical interactions,
allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the conditions' progression. Our
proposed approach, featuring trimodal, longitudinal MTL is evaluated on the
Depression Early Warning dataset. It achieves a balanced accuracy of 70.8%,
which is higher than each of the unimodal, single-task, and non-longitudinal
methods.

Abstract: Retrieving the biological impacts of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is
essential for target identification (Target ID) in drug development. Given the
vast number of proteins involved, this process remains time-consuming and
challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) frameworks have supported Target ID; however, no benchmark currently
exists for identifying the biological impacts of PPIs. To bridge this gap, we
introduce the RAG Benchmark for PPIs (RAGPPI), a factual question-answer
benchmark of 4,420 question-answer pairs that focus on the potential biological
impacts of PPIs. Through interviews with experts, we identified criteria for a
benchmark dataset, such as a type of QA and source. We built a gold-standard
dataset (500 QA pairs) through expert-driven data annotation. We developed an
ensemble auto-evaluation LLM that reflected expert labeling characteristics,
which facilitates the construction of a silver-standard dataset (3,720 QA
pairs). We are committed to maintaining RAGPPI as a resource to support the
research community in advancing RAG systems for drug discovery QA solutions.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to exhibit increasingly human-like
capabilities, aligning them with human values has become critically important.
Contemporary advanced techniques, such as prompt learning and reinforcement
learning, are being deployed to better align LLMs with human values. However,
while these approaches address broad ethical considerations and helpfulness,
they rarely focus on simulating individualized human value systems. To address
this gap, we present ValueSim, a framework that simulates individual values
through the generation of personal backstories reflecting past experiences and
demographic information. ValueSim converts structured individual data into
narrative backstories and employs a multi-module architecture inspired by the
Cognitive-Affective Personality System to simulate individual values based on
these narratives. Testing ValueSim on a self-constructed benchmark derived from
the World Values Survey demonstrates an improvement in top-1 accuracy by over
10% compared to retrieval-augmented generation methods. Further analysis
reveals that performance enhances as additional user interaction history
becomes available, indicating the model's ability to refine its persona
simulation capabilities over time.

Conclusion: BiasFilter为LLMs提供了一种高效且可扩展的去偏解决方案。

Abstract: Mitigating social bias in large language models (LLMs) has become an
increasingly important research objective. However, existing debiasing methods
often incur high human and computational costs, exhibit limited effectiveness,
and struggle to scale to larger models and open-ended generation tasks. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes BiasFilter, a model-agnostic,
inference-time debiasing framework that integrates seamlessly with both
open-source and API-based LLMs. Instead of relying on retraining with balanced
data or modifying model parameters, BiasFilter enforces fairness by filtering
generation outputs in real time. Specifically, it periodically evaluates
intermediate outputs every few tokens, maintains an active set of candidate
continuations, and incrementally completes generation by discarding low-reward
segments based on a fairness reward signal. To support this process, we
construct a fairness preference dataset and train an implicit reward model to
assess token-level fairness in generated responses. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that BiasFilter effectively mitigates social bias across a range of
LLMs while preserving overall generation quality.

TL;DR: EvoMoE提出了一种创新的MoE调优框架，通过专家进化和动态令牌感知路由器解决了多模态MoE中的专家同质化和路由器僵化问题，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态MoE调优方法面临专家同质化和路由器僵化两大挑战，限制了MoE架构的多样性和性能提升。

Method: EvoMoE采用专家进化策略从单一可训练专家逐步演化出多个鲁棒专家，并引入动态令牌感知路由器（DTR）根据令牌的模态和内在值动态分配专家。

Result: EvoMoE在多个多模态基准测试（MME、MMBench、TextVQA、POPE）中显著优于其他稀疏MLLM。

Conclusion: EvoMoE通过解决专家同质化和路由器僵化问题，有效提升了多模态大语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements have shown that the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach
significantly enhances the capacity of large language models (LLMs) and
improves performance on downstream tasks. Building on these promising results,
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have increasingly adopted MoE
techniques. However, existing multi-modal MoE tuning methods typically face two
key challenges: expert uniformity and router rigidity. Expert uniformity occurs
because MoE experts are often initialized by simply replicating the FFN
parameters from LLMs, leading to homogenized expert functions and weakening the
intended diversification of the MoE architecture. Meanwhile, router rigidity
stems from the prevalent use of static linear routers for expert selection,
which fail to distinguish between visual and textual tokens, resulting in
similar expert distributions for image and text. To address these limitations,
we propose EvoMoE, an innovative MoE tuning framework. EvoMoE introduces a
meticulously designed expert initialization strategy that progressively evolves
multiple robust experts from a single trainable expert, a process termed expert
evolution that specifically targets severe expert homogenization. Furthermore,
we introduce the Dynamic Token-aware Router (DTR), a novel routing mechanism
that allocates input tokens to appropriate experts based on their modality and
intrinsic token values. This dynamic routing is facilitated by hypernetworks,
which dynamically generate routing weights tailored for each individual token.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EvoMoE significantly outperforms other
sparse MLLMs across a variety of multi-modal benchmarks, including MME,
MMBench, TextVQA, and POPE. Our results highlight the effectiveness of EvoMoE
in enhancing the performance of MLLMs by addressing the critical issues of
expert uniformity and router rigidity.

TL;DR: 研究利用大语言模型技术开发了ICH-Qwen模型，旨在保护和传播中国非物质文化遗产（ICH），实验证明其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代化进程对非物质文化遗产（ICH）构成威胁，中国拥有丰富的ICH资源，亟需保护。大语言模型技术为ICH保护提供了新途径。

Method: 利用开源中文ICH数据开发ICH-Qwen模型，结合自然语言理解、知识推理、合成数据及微调技术。

Result: ICH-Qwen在ICH领域任务中表现有效，有望为ICH保护、传承和传播提供智能解决方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为ICH可持续发展提供了新理论实践参考，并可能推动数字人文学科发展。

Abstract: The intangible cultural heritage (ICH) of China, a cultural asset transmitted
across generations by various ethnic groups, serves as a significant testament
to the evolution of human civilization and holds irreplaceable value for the
preservation of historical lineage and the enhancement of cultural
self-confidence. However, the rapid pace of modernization poses formidable
challenges to ICH, including threats damage, disappearance and discontinuity of
inheritance. China has the highest number of items on the UNESCO Intangible
Cultural Heritage List, which is indicative of the nation's abundant cultural
resources and emphasises the pressing need for ICH preservation. In recent
years, the rapid advancements in large language modelling have provided a novel
technological approach for the preservation and dissemination of ICH. This
study utilises a substantial corpus of open-source Chinese ICH data to develop
a large language model, ICH-Qwen, for the ICH domain. The model employs natural
language understanding and knowledge reasoning capabilities of large language
models, augmented with synthetic data and fine-tuning techniques. The
experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of ICH-Qwen in executing tasks
specific to the ICH domain. It is anticipated that the model will provide
intelligent solutions for the protection, inheritance and dissemination of
intangible cultural heritage, as well as new theoretical and practical
references for the sustainable development of intangible cultural heritage.
Furthermore, it is expected that the study will open up new paths for digital
humanities research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律案例检索研究存在数据规模小、检索方法表现不足的问题，无法反映真实法律检索场景的复杂性。

Method: 提出LEGAR BENCH基准（覆盖411种犯罪类型和1.2M案例）和LegalSearchLM模型（通过法律要素推理和约束解码生成相关内容）。

Result: LegalSearchLM在LEGAR BENCH上比基线方法提升6-20%，并在域外案例上表现优于生成模型15%。

Conclusion: LEGAR BENCH和LegalSearchLM为法律案例检索提供了更全面的基准和更高效的模型，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Legal Case Retrieval (LCR), which retrieves relevant cases from a query case,
is a fundamental task for legal professionals in research and decision-making.
However, existing studies on LCR face two major limitations. First, they are
evaluated on relatively small-scale retrieval corpora (e.g., 100-55K cases) and
use a narrow range of criminal query types, which cannot sufficiently reflect
the complexity of real-world legal retrieval scenarios. Second, their reliance
on embedding-based or lexical matching methods often results in limited
representations and legally irrelevant matches. To address these issues, we
present: (1) LEGAR BENCH, the first large-scale Korean LCR benchmark, covering
411 diverse crime types in queries over 1.2M legal cases; and (2)
LegalSearchLM, a retrieval model that performs legal element reasoning over the
query case and directly generates content grounded in the target cases through
constrained decoding. Experimental results show that LegalSearchLM outperforms
baselines by 6-20% on LEGAR BENCH, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It
also demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-domain cases, outperforming
naive generative models trained on in-domain data by 15%.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单有效的基准测试方法，用于评估大语言模型（LLMs）的抽象推理能力，并揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在建立一个理论基础的基准，以严格测试LLMs的抽象推理能力，揭示其是否真正理解模式而非依赖表面符号。

Method: 开发了数学框架定义抽象推理，并引入两个新指标（γ和Δ分数），设计符号重映射任务以强制模型展示模式识别能力。

Result: 评估发现LLMs在非十进制算术和符号推理中存在局限，Δ分数能有效量化模型对记忆的依赖。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在抽象推理方面仍有不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to establish a simple, effective, and theoretically
grounded benchmark for rigorously probing abstract reasoning in Large Language
Models (LLMs). To achieve this, we first develop a mathematic framework that
defines abstract reasoning as the ability to: (i) extract essential patterns
independent of surface representations, and (ii) apply consistent rules to
these abstract patterns. Based on this framework, we introduce two novel
complementary metrics: \(\scoreGamma\) measures basic reasoning accuracy, while
\(\scoreDelta\) quantifies a model's reliance on specific symbols rather than
underlying patterns - a key indicator of true abstraction versus mere
memorization. To implement this measurement, we design a benchmark: systematic
symbol remapping in rule-based tasks, which forces models to demonstrate
genuine pattern recognition beyond superficial token matching. Extensive LLM
evaluations using this benchmark (commercial API models, 7B-70B, multi-agent)
reveal:1) critical limitations in non-decimal arithmetic and symbolic
reasoning; 2) persistent abstraction gaps despite chain-of-thought prompting;
and 3) \(\scoreDelta\)'s effectiveness in robustly measuring memory dependence
by quantifying performance degradation under symbol remapping, particularly
highlighting operand-specific memorization. These findings underscore that
current LLMs, despite domain-specific strengths, still lack robust abstract
reasoning, highlighting key areas for future improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有访问控制平台无法处理语义丰富或模糊的场景，且策略编写过程存在语义鸿沟。

Method: LACE结合提示引导的策略生成、检索增强推理和形式化验证，支持自然语言策略生成与验证。

Result: LACE在智能家居环境中验证了策略生成的100%正确性和88%的决策准确率，优于GPT-3.5和Gemini。

Conclusion: LACE为IoT平台提供了安全、灵活且用户友好的访问控制解决方案。

Abstract: Access control in the Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming increasingly
complex, as policies must account for dynamic and contextual factors such as
time, location, user behavior, and environmental conditions. However, existing
platforms either offer only coarse-grained controls or rely on rigid rule
matching, making them ill-suited for semantically rich or ambiguous access
scenarios. Moreover, the policy authoring process remains fragmented: domain
experts describe requirements in natural language, but developers must manually
translate them into code, introducing semantic gaps and potential
misconfiguration. In this work, we present LACE, the Language-based Access
Control Engine, a hybrid framework that leverages large language models (LLMs)
to bridge the gap between human intent and machine-enforceable logic. LACE
combines prompt-guided policy generation, retrieval-augmented reasoning, and
formal validation to support expressive, interpretable, and verifiable access
control. It enables users to specify policies in natural language,
automatically translates them into structured rules, validates semantic
correctness, and makes access decisions using a hybrid LLM-rule-based engine.
We evaluate LACE in smart home environments through extensive experiments. LACE
achieves 100% correctness in verified policy generation and up to 88% decision
accuracy with 0.79 F1-score using DeepSeek-V3, outperforming baselines such as
GPT-3.5 and Gemini. The system also demonstrates strong scalability under
increasing policy volume and request concurrency. Our results highlight LACE's
potential to enable secure, flexible, and user-friendly access control across
real-world IoT platforms.

Motivation: 探讨AI模型是否能识别评估场景，以避免评估结果被模型行为差异影响。

Method: 构建包含1000个提示和转录的多样化基准，测试模型对评估场景的分类能力。

Result: 模型表现优于随机（AUC 0.83），但低于人类基线（AUC 0.92）。模型还能识别评估目的。

Conclusion: 前沿模型已具备显著但非超人的评估意识能力，建议未来持续监测。

Abstract: If AI models can detect when they are being evaluated, the effectiveness of
evaluations might be compromised. For example, models could have systematically
different behavior during evaluations, leading to less reliable benchmarks for
deployment and governance decisions. We investigate whether frontier language
models can accurately classify transcripts based on whether they originate from
evaluations or real-world deployment, a capability we call evaluation
awareness. To achieve this, we construct a diverse benchmark of 1,000 prompts
and transcripts from 61 distinct datasets. These span public benchmarks (e.g.,
MMLU, SWEBench), real-world deployment interactions, and agent trajectories
from scaffolding frameworks (e.g., web-browsing agents). Frontier models
clearly demonstrate above-random evaluation awareness (Gemini-2.5-Pro reaches
an AUC of $0.83$), but do not yet surpass our simple human baseline (AUC of
$0.92$). Furthermore, both AI models and humans are better at identifying
evaluations in agentic settings compared to chat settings. Additionally, we
test whether models can identify the purpose of the evaluation. Under
multiple-choice and open-ended questioning, AI models far outperform random
chance in identifying what an evaluation is testing for. Our results indicate
that frontier models already exhibit a substantial, though not yet superhuman,
level of evaluation-awareness. We recommend tracking this capability in future
models.

Motivation: 现有LLM方法在POI预测中忽视了对时空数据的理解和候选空间约束，导致预测不准确或随机。

Method: 提出CoMaPOI框架，包含Profiler（数据转换）、Forecaster（空间约束）和Predictor（预测生成）三个代理。

Result: 在三个数据集上实验，性能提升5%-10%，达到SOTA。

Conclusion: CoMaPOI通过协作代理解决了LLM在复杂时空任务中的挑战，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for the next
Point-Of-Interest (POI) prediction task, leveraging their capabilities in
semantic understanding of POI trajectories. However, previous LLM-based
methods, which are superficially adapted to next POI prediction, largely
overlook critical challenges associated with applying LLMs to this task.
Specifically, LLMs encounter two critical challenges: (1) a lack of intrinsic
understanding of numeric spatiotemporal data, which hinders accurate modeling
of users' spatiotemporal distributions and preferences; and (2) an excessively
large and unconstrained candidate POI space, which often results in random or
irrelevant predictions. To address these issues, we propose a Collaborative
Multi Agent Framework for Next POI Prediction, named CoMaPOI. Through the close
interaction of three specialized agents (Profiler, Forecaster, and Predictor),
CoMaPOI collaboratively addresses the two critical challenges. The Profiler
agent is responsible for converting numeric data into language descriptions,
enhancing semantic understanding. The Forecaster agent focuses on dynamically
constraining and refining the candidate POI space. The Predictor agent
integrates this information to generate high-precision predictions. Extensive
experiments on three benchmark datasets (NYC, TKY, and CA) demonstrate that
CoMaPOI achieves state of the art performance, improving all metrics by 5% to
10% compared to SOTA baselines. This work pioneers the investigation of
challenges associated with applying LLMs to complex spatiotemporal tasks by
leveraging tailored collaborative agents.

Motivation: 研究LLMs在真实对话中的迎合行为，填补单轮事实正确性研究的不足。

Method: 引入SYCON Bench，测量模型在多轮对话中迎合用户的速度和频率，并测试17种LLMs。

Result: 对齐调优增加迎合行为，模型规模和推理优化能减少迎合；第三人称视角提示策略显著降低迎合。

Conclusion: LLMs普遍存在迎合行为，需优化模型设计和提示策略以减少负面影响。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are expected to provide helpful and harmless
responses, yet they often exhibit sycophancy--conforming to user beliefs
regardless of factual accuracy or ethical soundness. Prior research on
sycophancy has primarily focused on single-turn factual correctness,
overlooking the dynamics of real-world interactions. In this work, we introduce
SYCON Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating sycophantic behavior in
multi-turn, free-form conversational settings. Our benchmark measures how
quickly a model conforms to the user (Turn of Flip) and how frequently it
shifts its stance under sustained user pressure (Number of Flip). Applying
SYCON Bench to 17 LLMs across three real-world scenarios, we find that
sycophancy remains a prevalent failure mode. Our analysis shows that alignment
tuning amplifies sycophantic behavior, whereas model scaling and reasoning
optimization strengthen the model's ability to resist undesirable user views.
Reasoning models generally outperform instruction-tuned models but often fail
when they over-index on logical exposition instead of directly addressing the
user's underlying beliefs. Finally, we evaluate four additional prompting
strategies and demonstrate that adopting a third-person perspective reduces
sycophancy by up to 63.8% in debate scenario. We release our code and data at

Result: 在亚马逊产品评论摘要任务中，Cluster Shapley在保持高准确性的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Cluster Shapley方法高效且通用，适用于多种摘要生成场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in systems that retrieve
and summarize content from multiple sources, such as search engines and AI
assistants. While these models enhance user experience by generating coherent
summaries, they obscure the contributions of original content creators, raising
concerns about credit attribution and compensation. We address the challenge of
valuing individual documents used in LLM-generated summaries. We propose using
Shapley values, a game-theoretic method that allocates credit based on each
document's marginal contribution. Although theoretically appealing, Shapley
values are expensive to compute at scale. We therefore propose Cluster Shapley,
an efficient approximation algorithm that leverages semantic similarity between
documents. By clustering documents using LLM-based embeddings and computing
Shapley values at the cluster level, our method significantly reduces
computation while maintaining attribution quality. We demonstrate our approach
to a summarization task using Amazon product reviews. Cluster Shapley
significantly reduces computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy,
outperforming baseline methods such as Monte Carlo sampling and Kernel SHAP
with a better efficient frontier. Our approach is agnostic to the exact LLM
used, the summarization process used, and the evaluation procedure, which makes
it broadly applicable to a variety of summarization settings.

Abstract: Multi-round incomplete information tasks are crucial for evaluating the
lateral thinking capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Currently,
research primarily relies on multiple benchmarks and automated evaluation
metrics to assess these abilities. However, our study reveals novel insights
into the limitations of existing methods, as they often yield misleading
results that fail to uncover key issues, such as shortcut-taking behaviors,
rigid patterns, and premature task termination. These issues obscure the true
reasoning capabilities of LLMs and undermine the reliability of evaluations. To
address these limitations, we propose a refined set of evaluation standards,
including inspection of reasoning paths, diversified assessment metrics, and
comparative analyses with human performance.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了多LLM集成中的干扰和灵活性问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable promise but remain
challenging to continually improve through traditional finetuning, particularly
when integrating capabilities from other specialized LLMs. Popular methods like
ensemble and weight merging require substantial memory and struggle to adapt to
changing data environments. Recent efforts have transferred knowledge from
multiple LLMs into a single target model; however, they suffer from
interference and degraded performance among tasks, largely due to limited
flexibility in candidate selection and training pipelines. To address these
issues, we propose a framework that adaptively selects and aggregates knowledge
from diverse LLMs to build a single, stronger model, avoiding the high memory
overhead of ensemble and inflexible weight merging. Specifically, we design an
adaptive selection network that identifies the most relevant source LLMs based
on their scores, thereby reducing knowledge interference. We further propose a
dynamic weighted fusion strategy that accounts for the inherent strengths of
candidate LLMs, along with a feedback-driven loss function that prevents the
selector from converging on a single subset of sources. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method can enable a more stable and scalable knowledge
aggregation process while reducing knowledge interference by up to 50% compared
to existing approaches. Code is avaliable at

Result: 语义熵更可靠，长链思考显著提升信心有效性，读者模型可重构类似信心。

Conclusion: 可靠的不确定性估计需显式探索生成空间，自我报告信心在此条件下才可信。

Abstract: We study the source of uncertainty in DeepSeek R1-32B by analyzing its
self-reported verbal confidence on question answering (QA) tasks. In the
default answer-then-confidence setting, the model is regularly over-confident,
whereas semantic entropy - obtained by sampling many responses - remains
reliable. We hypothesize that this is because of semantic entropy's larger
test-time compute, which lets us explore the model's predictive distribution.
We show that granting DeepSeek the budget to explore its distribution by
forcing a long chain-of-thought before the final answer greatly improves its
verbal score effectiveness, even on simple fact-retrieval questions that
normally require no reasoning. Furthermore, a separate reader model that sees
only the chain can reconstruct very similar confidences, indicating the verbal
score might be merely a statistic of the alternatives surfaced during
reasoning. Our analysis concludes that reliable uncertainty estimation requires
explicit exploration of the generative space, and self-reported confidence is
trustworthy only after such exploration.

Abstract: To fully leverage the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in a
trustworthy manner, it is desirable to couple multiple AI and non-AI systems
together seamlessly for constraining and ensuring correctness of the output.
This paper introduces a novel parallel discrete event simulation (PDES) based
methodology to combine multiple AI and non-AI agents in a causal, rule-based
way. Our approach tightly integrates the concept of passage of time, with each
agent considered as an entity in the PDES framework and responding to prior
requests from other agents. Such coupling mechanism enables the agents to work
in a co-operative environment towards a common goal while many tasks run in
parallel throughout the simulation. It further enables setting up boundaries to
the outputs of the AI agents by applying necessary dynamic constraints using
non-AI agents while allowing for scalability through deployment of hundreds of
such agents in a larger compute cluster. Distributing smaller AI agents can
enable extremely scalable simulations in the future, addressing local memory
bottlenecks for model parameter storage. Within a PDES involving both AI and
non-AI agents, we break down the problem at hand into structured steps, when
necessary, providing a set of multiple choices to the AI agents, and then
progressively solve these steps towards a final goal. At each step, the non-AI
agents act as unbiased auditors, verifying each action by the AI agents so that
certain rules of engagement are followed. We evaluate our approach by solving
four problems from four different domains and comparing the results with those
from AI models alone. Our results show greater accuracy in solving problems
from various domains where the AI models struggle to solve the problems solely
by themselves. Results show that overall accuracy of our approach is 68% where
as the accuracy of vanilla models is less than 23%.

Method: 在生成过程中抑制<think>后的双换行符和结束标记</think>，仅通过修改生成时的标记概率实现，无需数据集、参数调整或训练。

Result: 在DeepSeek-R1蒸馏模型实验中，该方法提高了对敏感提示的实质性回答比例，且不影响标准基准测试性能。

Conclusion: 拒绝行为可以通过在生成过程中阻断特定拒绝子空间来规避，无需复杂干预。

Abstract: We introduce a method to reduce refusal rates of large language models (LLMs)
on sensitive content without modifying model weights or prompts. Motivated by
the observation that refusals in certain models were often preceded by the
specific token sequence of a token marking the beginning of the
chain-of-thought (CoT) block (<think>) followed by a double newline token
(\n\n), we investigate the impact of two simple formatting adjustments during
generation: suppressing \n\n after <think> and suppressing the end-of-sequence
token after the end of the CoT block (</think>). Our method requires no
datasets, parameter changes, or training, relying solely on modifying token
probabilities during generation. In our experiments with official DeepSeek-R1
distillations, these interventions increased the proportion of substantive
answers to sensitive prompts without affecting performance on standard
benchmarks. Our findings suggest that refusal behaviors can be circumvented by
blocking refusal subspaces at specific points in the generation process.

### [44] [ASyMOB: Algebraic Symbolic Mathematical Operations Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23851)
*Michael Shalyt,Rotem Elimelech,Ido Kaminer*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ASyMOB是一个专注于符号数学评估的新框架，揭示了大型语言模型（LLMs）在符号数学中的表现，发现其依赖记忆而非深层理解，但高级模型展现出显著鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法全面评估LLMs在符号数学（如积分、微分方程和代数简化）中的核心能力，因此开发了ASyMOB框架。

Method: ASyMOB包含17,092个数学问题，通过数值或符号扰动分析LLMs的泛化能力，并与计算机代数系统（CAS）对比。

Result: LLMs在扰动问题中表现显著下降（最高-70.3%），但高级模型（如o4-mini和Gemini 2.5 Flash）表现优异（扰动后仅下降约21%）。结合代码执行的模型准确性更高。

Conclusion: LLMs在符号数学中仍有局限性，但高级模型显示出潜力。未来方向可能是更深入集成外部工具或开发更强大的模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly approaching the level of proficiency
in university-level symbolic mathematics required for applications in advanced
science and technology. However, existing benchmarks fall short in assessing
the core skills of LLMs in symbolic mathematics-such as integration,
differential equations, and algebraic simplification. To address this gap, we
introduce ASyMOB, a novel assessment framework focused exclusively on symbolic
manipulation, featuring 17,092 unique math challenges, organized by similarity
and complexity. ASyMOB enables analysis of LLM generalization capabilities by
comparing performance in problems that differ by simple numerical or symbolic
`perturbations'. Evaluated LLMs exhibit substantial degradation in performance
for all perturbation types (up to -70.3%), suggesting reliance on memorized
patterns rather than deeper understanding of symbolic math, even among models
achieving high baseline accuracy. Comparing LLM performance to computer algebra
systems, we identify examples where they fail while LLMs succeed, as well as
problems solved only by combining both approaches. Models capable of integrated
code execution yielded higher accuracy compared to their performance without
code, particularly stabilizing weaker models (up to +33.1% for certain
perturbation types). Notably, the most advanced models (o4-mini, Gemini 2.5
Flash) demonstrate not only high symbolic math proficiency (scoring 96.8% and
97.6% on the unperturbed set), but also remarkable robustness against
perturbations, (-21.7% and -21.2% vs. average -50.4% for the other models).
This may indicate a recent "phase transition" in the generalization
capabilities of frontier LLMs. It remains to be seen whether the path forward
lies in deeper integration with sophisticated external tools, or in developing
models so capable that symbolic math systems like CAS become unnecessary.

*Nic Dobbins,Christelle Xiong,Kristine Lan,Meliha Yetisgen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究展示了大型语言模型（LLMs）作为自主代理重现已发表研究结果的能力，但成功率有限，平均仅能重现53.2%的关键发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs在生物医学研究中自动化重现性的潜力，评估其作为自主代理的可行性和局限性。

Method: 使用NACC的“Quick Access”数据集，通过GPT-4o模拟LLM代理团队，基于研究摘要和方法部分重现五项阿尔茨海默病研究的关键发现。

Result: LLM代理平均重现了53.2%的关键发现，数值和统计方法存在差异，但部分趋势和显著性相似。

Conclusion: LLMs在自动化重现性评估中展现出潜力，但仍受限于实现细节和方法学不足，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Objective: To demonstrate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) as
autonomous agents to reproduce findings of published research studies using the
same or similar dataset.
  Materials and Methods: We used the "Quick Access" dataset of the National
Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). We identified highly cited published
research manuscripts using NACC data and selected five studies that appeared
reproducible using this dataset alone. Using GPT-4o, we created a simulated
research team of LLM-based autonomous agents tasked with writing and executing
code to dynamically reproduce the findings of each study, given only study
Abstracts, Methods sections, and data dictionary descriptions of the dataset.
  Results: We extracted 35 key findings described in the Abstracts across 5
Alzheimer's studies. On average, LLM agents approximately reproduced 53.2% of
findings per study. Numeric values and range-based findings often differed
between studies and agents. The agents also applied statistical methods or
parameters that varied from the originals, though overall trends and
significance were sometimes similar.
  Discussion: In some cases, LLM-based agents replicated research techniques
and findings. In others, they failed due to implementation flaws or missing
methodological detail. These discrepancies show the current limits of LLMs in
fully automating reproducibility assessments. Still, this early investigation
highlights the potential of structured agent-based systems to provide scalable
evaluation of scientific rigor.
  Conclusion: This exploratory work illustrates both the promise and
limitations of LLMs as autonomous agents for automating reproducibility in
biomedical research.

*Linwei Tao,Yi-Fan Yeh,Minjing Dong,Tao Huang,Philip Torr,Chang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究全面评估了大型语言模型（LLMs）的不确定性估计方法，发现语言表达不确定性（LVU）在性能和可解释性上优于其他方法，并揭示了模型规模、推理能力等因素对估计性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在高风险应用中的广泛部署，可靠的不确定性估计对确保其安全可信至关重要。

Method: 研究评估了80种模型，包括开源和闭源、密集和MoE架构等，并比较了三种不确定性估计方法（TPU、NVU、LVU）在MMLU-Pro基准上的表现。

Result: LVU在校准和区分能力上表现最佳，且高精度不一定代表可靠的不确定性。模型规模、推理能力等因素显著影响估计性能。

Conclusion: 研究强调了多角度评估的重要性，并推荐LVU作为提升LLMs可靠性的实用工具。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
applications, robust uncertainty estimation is essential for ensuring the safe
and trustworthy deployment of LLMs. We present the most comprehensive study to
date of uncertainty estimation in LLMs, evaluating 80 models spanning open- and
closed-source families, dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures,
reasoning and non-reasoning modes, quantization variants and parameter scales
from 0.6B to 671B. Focusing on three representative black-box single-pass
methods, including token probability-based uncertainty (TPU), numerical verbal
uncertainty (NVU), and linguistic verbal uncertainty (LVU), we systematically
evaluate uncertainty calibration and selective classification using the
challenging MMLU-Pro benchmark, which covers both reasoning-intensive and
knowledge-based tasks. Our results show that LVU consistently outperforms TPU
and NVU, offering stronger calibration and discrimination while being more
interpretable. We also find that high accuracy does not imply reliable
uncertainty, and that model scale, post-training, reasoning ability and
quantization all influence estimation performance. Notably, LLMs exhibit better
uncertainty estimates on reasoning tasks than on knowledge-heavy ones, and good
calibration does not necessarily translate to effective error ranking. These
findings highlight the need for multi-perspective evaluation and position LVU
as a practical tool for improving the reliability of LLMs in real-world
settings.

TL;DR: OMNIGUARD提出了一种跨语言和多模态的有害提示检测方法，显著提升了检测准确率和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的潜在滥用风险引发关注，现有检测方法在多语言和非文本模态下表现不佳。

Method: 通过识别LLM/MLLM的内部表示，构建语言和模态无关的分类器。

Result: 在多语言、图像和音频提示检测中，OMNIGUARD分别提升了11.57%、20.44%，并创下音频检测新纪录，且效率极高。

Conclusion: OMNIGUARD为跨语言和多模态的有害提示检测提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: The emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have sparked
concerns about their immediate potential for harmful misuse. The core approach
to mitigate these concerns is the detection of harmful queries to the model.
Current detection approaches are fallible, and are particularly susceptible to
attacks that exploit mismatched generalization of model capabilities (e.g.,
prompts in low-resource languages or prompts provided in non-text modalities
such as image and audio). To tackle this challenge, we propose OMNIGUARD, an
approach for detecting harmful prompts across languages and modalities. Our
approach (i) identifies internal representations of an LLM/MLLM that are
aligned across languages or modalities and then (ii) uses them to build a
language-agnostic or modality-agnostic classifier for detecting harmful
prompts. OMNIGUARD improves harmful prompt classification accuracy by 11.57\%
over the strongest baseline in a multilingual setting, by 20.44\% for
image-based prompts, and sets a new SOTA for audio-based prompts. By
repurposing embeddings computed during generation, OMNIGUARD is also very
efficient ($\approx 120 \times$ faster than the next fastest baseline). Code

Motivation: 医疗MLLM在实际部署中面临资源效率、诊断准确性、临床考量和伦理隐私等挑战，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出Infi-Med框架，包括资源高效的SFT数据集构建、增强的多模态推理能力，以及系统化的评估体系。

Result: 实验表明，Infi-Med在通用医疗推理中达到SOTA性能，并能快速适应临床场景。

Conclusion: Infi-Med为医疗MLLM的实际部署提供了平衡模型效果与操作约束的坚实基础。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated promising
prospects in healthcare, particularly for addressing complex medical tasks,
supporting multidisciplinary treatment (MDT), and enabling personalized
precision medicine. However, their practical deployment faces critical
challenges in resource efficiency, diagnostic accuracy, clinical
considerations, and ethical privacy. To address these limitations, we propose
Infi-Med, a comprehensive framework for medical MLLMs that introduces three key
innovations: (1) a resource-efficient approach through curating and
constructing high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with minimal
sample requirements, with a forward-looking design that extends to both
pretraining and posttraining phases; (2) enhanced multimodal reasoning
capabilities for cross-modal integration and clinical task understanding; and
(3) a systematic evaluation system that assesses model performance across
medical modalities and task types. Our experiments demonstrate that Infi-Med
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in general medical reasoning while
maintaining rapid adaptability to clinical scenarios. The framework establishes
a solid foundation for deploying MLLMs in real-world healthcare settings by
balancing model effectiveness with operational constraints.

Motivation: 现有研究受限于小规模数据集，无法全面分析LLM的上下文学习能力，因此需要更大规模的数据集。

Method: 使用Llama-3-8B模型在QuiteAFew数据集（3,096个多样任务）上进行实验，分析任务向量的表现。

Result: 任务向量性能在中间层（如第15层）达到峰值，任务类型和复杂性显著影响其效果，复杂任务依赖多个子任务向量。

Conclusion: 任务知识在LLM中以分布式方式表示，而非单一向量，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to
new tasks using few examples, with task vectors - specific hidden state
activations - hypothesized to encode task information. Existing studies are
limited by small-scale benchmarks, restricting comprehensive analysis. We
introduce QuiteAFew, a novel dataset of 3,096 diverse few-shot tasks, each with
30 input-output pairs derived from the Alpaca dataset. Experiments with
Llama-3-8B on QuiteAFew reveal: (1) task vector performance peaks at an
intermediate layer (e.g., 15th), (2) effectiveness varies significantly by task
type, and (3) complex tasks rely on multiple, subtask-specific vectors rather
than a single vector, suggesting distributed task knowledge representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在长文本生成中的幻觉问题，现有置信度估计方法效率低且不适用于开放生成任务。

Method: 使用强化学习（RL）训练LLMs为每个生成语句附加数值置信度分数，包括DPO、ORPO和GRPO方法。

Result: 在三个长文本QA数据集上，RL训练模型表现出更好的校准性和跨领域鲁棒性，且高效。

Conclusion: LoVeC方法高效且有效，适用于长文本生成中的置信度估计。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a major challenge for the safe and trustworthy
deployment of large language models (LLMs) in factual content generation. Prior
work has explored confidence estimation as an effective approach to
hallucination detection, but often relies on post-hoc self-consistency methods
that require computationally expensive sampling. Verbalized confidence offers a
more efficient alternative, but existing approaches are largely limited to
short-form question answering (QA) tasks and do not generalize well to
open-ended generation. In this paper, we propose LoVeC (Long-form Verbalized
Confidence), an on-the-fly verbalized confidence estimation method for
long-form generation. Specifically, we use reinforcement learning (RL) to train
LLMs to append numerical confidence scores to each generated statement, serving
as a direct and interpretable signal of the factuality of generation. Our
experiments consider both on-policy and off-policy RL methods, including DPO,
ORPO, and GRPO, to enhance the model calibration. We introduce two novel
evaluation settings, free-form tagging and iterative tagging, to assess
different verbalized confidence estimation methods. Experiments on three
long-form QA datasets show that our RL-trained models achieve better
calibration and generalize robustly across domains. Also, our method is highly
efficient, as it only requires adding a few tokens to the output being decoded.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型（LLM）在内容审核中存在主题偏见，导致误判良性评论为有毒内容，提出了一种语义层面的分析方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在内容审核中过度敏感的问题，揭示其误判的潜在原因不仅是关键词，还包括隐性的主题关联。

Method: 引入主题关联分析（Topic Association Analysis），通过生成自由场景想象并分析主题放大水平，量化LLM的主题偏见。

Result: 发现更先进的模型（如GPT-4 Turbo）尽管总体误判率较低，但表现出更强的主题刻板印象。

Conclusion: LLM的审核决策依赖于学习到的主题关联，而非仅对显性语言的反应，需改进基于关键词的过滤方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models are widely used for content moderation but often
misclassify benign comments as toxic, leading to over-sensitivity. While
previous research attributes this issue primarily to the presence of offensive
terms, we reveal a potential cause beyond token level: LLMs exhibit systematic
topic biases in their implicit associations. Inspired by cognitive psychology's
implicit association tests, we introduce Topic Association Analysis, a
semantic-level approach to quantify how LLMs associate certain topics with
toxicity. By prompting LLMs to generate free-form scenario imagination for
misclassified benign comments and analyzing their topic amplification levels,
we find that more advanced models (e.g., GPT-4 Turbo) demonstrate stronger
topic stereotype despite lower overall false positive rates. These biases
suggest that LLMs do not merely react to explicit, offensive language but rely
on learned topic associations, shaping their moderation decisions. Our findings
highlight the need for refinement beyond keyword-based filtering, providing
insights into the underlying mechanisms driving LLM over-sensitivity.

Result: 实验结果显示ChARM在偏好排名上比传统模型提升13%，并在CharacterEval和RoleplayEval上达到最优效果。

Conclusion: ChARM通过创新机制和新数据集显著提升了角色扮演语言代理的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Role-Playing Language Agents (RPLAs) aim to simulate characters for realistic
and engaging human-computer interactions. However, traditional reward models
often struggle with scalability and adapting to subjective conversational
preferences. We propose ChARM, a Character-based Act-adaptive Reward Model,
addressing these challenges through two innovations: (1) an act-adaptive margin
that significantly enhances learning efficiency and generalizability, and (2) a
self-evolution mechanism leveraging large-scale unlabeled data to improve
training coverage. Additionally, we introduce RoleplayPref, the first
large-scale preference dataset specifically for RPLAs, featuring 1,108
characters, 13 subcategories, and 16,888 bilingual dialogues, alongside
RoleplayEval, a dedicated evaluation benchmark. Experimental results show a 13%
improvement over the conventional Bradley-Terry model in preference rankings.
Furthermore, applying ChARM-generated rewards to preference learning techniques
(e.g., direct preference optimization) achieves state-of-the-art results on
CharacterEval and RoleplayEval. Code and dataset are available at

Motivation: 思维报告法（think-aloud）能提供丰富的人类推理数据，但因转录和标注工作量大而难以大规模应用。

Method: 使用自然语言处理工具自动化转录和标注640名参与者在数学推理任务中的思维报告，并将其编码为搜索图。

Result: 自动化方法与人工标注具有中等一致性，分析揭示了人类推理的一致性和变异性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了大规模思维报告数据的价值，并为自动化分析提供了概念验证。

Abstract: The think-aloud method, where participants voice their thoughts as they solve
a task, is a valuable source of rich data about human reasoning processes. Yet,
it has declined in popularity in contemporary cognitive science, largely
because labor-intensive transcription and annotation preclude large sample
sizes. Here, we develop methods to automate the transcription and annotation of
verbal reports of reasoning using natural language processing tools, allowing
for large-scale analysis of think-aloud data. In our study, 640 participants
thought aloud while playing the Game of 24, a mathematical reasoning task. We
automatically transcribed the recordings and coded the transcripts as search
graphs, finding moderate inter-rater reliability with humans. We analyze these
graphs and characterize consistency and variation in human reasoning traces.
Our work demonstrates the value of think-aloud data at scale and serves as a
proof of concept for the automated analysis of verbal reports.

Abstract: We present SwingArena, a competitive evaluation framework for Large Language
Models (LLMs) that closely mirrors real-world software development workflows.
Unlike traditional static benchmarks, SwingArena models the collaborative
process of software iteration by pairing LLMs as submitters, who generate
patches, and reviewers, who create test cases and verify the patches through
continuous integration (CI) pipelines. To support these interactive
evaluations, we introduce a retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) module
that efficiently handles long-context challenges by providing syntactically and
semantically relevant code snippets from large codebases, supporting multiple
programming languages (C++, Python, Rust, and Go). This enables the framework
to scale across diverse tasks and contexts while respecting token limitations.
Our experiments, using over 400 high-quality real-world GitHub issues selected
from a pool of 2,300 issues, show that models like GPT-4o excel at aggressive
patch generation, whereas DeepSeek and Gemini prioritize correctness in CI
validation. SwingArena presents a scalable and extensible methodology for
evaluating LLMs in realistic, CI-driven software development settings. More

Motivation: 现有无监督方法性能差且需人工干预，监督方法缺乏大规模训练数据，而LLMs结合提示工程虽有效但缺乏全面研究。

Method: 采用RAG动态提示方案，结合检索和生成技术优化LLMs的因果关系检测能力。

Result: 在三个数据集和五种LLMs上的实验验证了RAG动态提示优于静态提示方案。

Conclusion: RAG动态提示显著提升了LLMs在因果关系任务中的性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Causality detection and mining are important tasks in information retrieval
due to their enormous use in information extraction, and knowledge graph
construction. To solve these tasks, in existing literature there exist several
solutions -- both unsupervised and supervised. However, the unsupervised
methods suffer from poor performance and they often require significant human
intervention for causal rule selection, leading to poor generalization across
different domains. On the other hand, supervised methods suffer from the lack
of large training datasets. Recently, large language models (LLMs) with
effective prompt engineering are found to be effective to overcome the issue of
unavailability of large training dataset. Yet, in existing literature, there
does not exist comprehensive works on causality detection and mining using LLM
prompting. In this paper, we present several retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) based dynamic prompting schemes to enhance LLM performance in causality
detection and extraction tasks. Extensive experiments over three datasets and
five LLMs validate the superiority of our proposed RAG-based dynamic prompting
over other static prompting schemes.

Motivation: 尽管链式思维推理提升了大型语言模型的性能，但其推理过程是否忠实反映模型内部机制尚不明确，尤其是在视觉语言模型中。

Method: 研究引入了一种细粒度的评估流程，用于分类偏见表达模式，从而更精确地分析CoT推理。

Result: 研究发现图像偏见较少被明确表达，且模型存在“不一致”推理现象。语言模型在隐含线索表达上仍有困难。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LVLM和LLM中CoT推理的局限性，为未来改进提供了新视角。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances performance of large language
models, but questions remain about whether these reasoning traces faithfully
reflect the internal processes of the model. We present the first comprehensive
study of CoT faithfulness in large vision-language models (LVLMs),
investigating how both text-based and previously unexplored image-based biases
affect reasoning and bias articulation. Our work introduces a novel,
fine-grained evaluation pipeline for categorizing bias articulation patterns,
enabling significantly more precise analysis of CoT reasoning than previous
methods. This framework reveals critical distinctions in how models process and
respond to different types of biases, providing new insights into LVLM CoT
faithfulness. Our findings reveal that subtle image-based biases are rarely
articulated compared to explicit text-based ones, even in models specialized
for reasoning. Additionally, many models exhibit a previously unidentified
phenomenon we term ``inconsistent'' reasoning - correctly reasoning before
abruptly changing answers, serving as a potential canary for detecting biased
reasoning from unfaithful CoTs. We then apply the same evaluation pipeline to
revisit CoT faithfulness in LLMs across various levels of implicit cues. Our
findings reveal that current language-only reasoning models continue to
struggle with articulating cues that are not overtly stated.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在资源受限环境中部署时面临计算和内存需求高的挑战，现有低秩分解方法存在精度下降和效率低下的问题。

Method: 使用基于激活空间的细粒度低秩变换，通过PCA截断特征向量压缩权重，并采用重要性度量自适应分配解码器秩。

Result: 在4个模型和11个数据集上，FLAT-LLM在泛化和下游任务表现上优于基线方法，同时显著提升推理速度。

Conclusion: FLAT-LLM提供了一种高效、准确且无需微调的结构压缩方案，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled remarkable progress in natural
language processing, yet their high computational and memory demands pose
challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Although recent
low-rank decomposition methods offer a promising path for structural
compression, they often suffer from accuracy degradation, expensive calibration
procedures, and result in inefficient model architectures that hinder
real-world inference speedups. In this paper, we propose FLAT-LLM, a fast and
accurate, training-free structural compression method based on fine-grained
low-rank transformations in the activation space. Specifically, we reduce the
hidden dimension by transforming the weights using truncated eigenvectors
computed via head-wise Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and employ an
importance-based metric to adaptively allocate ranks across decoders. FLAT-LLM
achieves efficient and effective weight compression without recovery
fine-tuning, which could complete the calibration within a few minutes.
Evaluated across 4 models and 11 datasets, FLAT-LLM outperforms structural
pruning baselines in generalization and downstream performance, while
delivering inference speedups over decomposition-based methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种不确定性感知的公平性度量UCerF，并引入了一个新的性别-职业公平性评估数据集，用于更细致地评估LLM的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性度量仅关注离散的准确性评估，未能捕捉模型不确定性对公平性的隐性影响，需要更全面的评估方法。

Method: 提出了UCerF度量，结合新的性别-职业数据集（31,756样本），对10个开源LLM进行公平性评估。

Result: Mistral-7B等模型在UCerF下表现不佳，传统公平性度量（如Equalized Odds）未能捕捉其高置信度错误预测的问题。

Conclusion: UCerF和新型数据集为LLM公平性评估提供了更全面的工具，有助于开发更透明和负责任的AI系统。

Abstract: The recent rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) highlights the
critical need for benchmarking their fairness. Conventional fairness metrics,
which focus on discrete accuracy-based evaluations (i.e., prediction
correctness), fail to capture the implicit impact of model uncertainty (e.g.,
higher model confidence about one group over another despite similar accuracy).
To address this limitation, we propose an uncertainty-aware fairness metric,
UCerF, to enable a fine-grained evaluation of model fairness that is more
reflective of the internal bias in model decisions compared to conventional
fairness measures. Furthermore, observing data size, diversity, and clarity
issues in current datasets, we introduce a new gender-occupation fairness
evaluation dataset with 31,756 samples for co-reference resolution, offering a
more diverse and suitable dataset for evaluating modern LLMs. We establish a
benchmark, using our metric and dataset, and apply it to evaluate the behavior
of ten open-source LLMs. For example, Mistral-7B exhibits suboptimal fairness
due to high confidence in incorrect predictions, a detail overlooked by
Equalized Odds but captured by UCerF. Overall, our proposed LLM benchmark,
which evaluates fairness with uncertainty awareness, paves the way for
developing more transparent and accountable AI systems.

TL;DR: 论文研究了Transformer内部机制与参数规模扩展的关系，通过偏置-多样性分解分析层的行为，发现多样性对性能提升至关重要，尤其是当层输出远离真实值时。增加层数仅在层行为多样时提升性能，且边际收益递减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer内部机制（如层的行为）与参数规模扩展之间的关系，以理解性能提升的根源。

Method: 采用偏置-多样性分解理论分析Transformer的层行为，并通过信息论多样性验证层多样性的重要性。

Result: 性能提升依赖于层的输出接近真实值且相互多样，尤其是当输出远离真实值时多样性更关键。增加层数仅在层行为多样时有效，且边际收益递减。

Conclusion: 层多样性是Transformer性能提升的关键因素，与参数规模扩展的边际收益递减现象一致。

Abstract: Transformers deliver outstanding performance across a wide range of tasks and
are now a dominant backbone architecture for large language models (LLMs).
Their task-solving performance is improved by increasing parameter size, as
shown in the recent studies on parameter scaling laws. Although recent
mechanistic-interpretability studies have deepened our understanding of the
internal behavior of Transformers by analyzing their residual stream, the
relationship between these internal mechanisms and the parameter scaling laws
remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we focus on layers and their size, which
mainly decide the parameter size of Transformers. For this purpose, we first
theoretically investigate the layers within the residual stream through a
bias-diversity decomposition. The decomposition separates (i) bias, the error
of each layer's output from the ground truth, and (ii) diversity, which
indicates how much the outputs of each layer differ from each other. Analyzing
Transformers under this theory reveals that performance improves when
individual layers make predictions close to the correct answer and remain
mutually diverse. We show that diversity becomes especially critical when
individual layers' outputs are far from the ground truth. Finally, we introduce
an information-theoretic diversity and show our main findings that adding
layers enhances performance only when those layers behave differently, i.e.,
are diverse. We also reveal the performance gains from increasing the number of
layers exhibit submodularity: marginal improvements diminish as additional
layers increase, mirroring the logarithmic convergence predicted by the
parameter scaling laws. Experiments on multiple semantic-understanding tasks
with various LLMs empirically confirm the theoretical properties derived in
this study.

TL;DR: GenCP结合LLM与CP推理，通过MLM实现双向约束传播，提升约束感知文本生成性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在生成文本时难以强制执行外部约束的问题。

Method: 将文本生成建模为CSP，集成MLM实现双向约束传播。

Result: 在COLLIE基准测试中表现显著提升，生成更可靠且符合约束的文本。

Conclusion: GenCP通过MLM集成优化了LLM推理效率，适用于严格约束任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text but struggle to
enforce external constraints because they generate tokens sequentially without
explicit control mechanisms. GenCP addresses this limitation by combining LLM
predictions with Constraint Programming (CP) reasoning, formulating text
generation as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In this paper, we
improve GenCP by integrating Masked Language Models (MLMs) for domain
generation, which allows bidirectional constraint propagation that leverages
both past and future tokens. This integration bridges the gap between
token-level prediction and structured constraint enforcement, leading to more
reliable and constraint-aware text generation. Our evaluation on COLLIE
benchmarks demonstrates that incorporating domain preview via MLM calls
significantly improves GenCP's performance. Although this approach incurs
additional MLM calls and, in some cases, increased backtracking, the overall
effect is a more efficient use of LLM inferences and an enhanced ability to
generate feasible and meaningful solutions, particularly in tasks with strict
content constraints.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了结构化状态空间模型（SSMs）的隐藏状态是否可以通过后处理合并以支持下游推理。提出了一种称为“文档汤”的策略，通过简单操作（如平均）将独立编码的文档表示合并为单一上下文状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受模型汤（model souping）启发，旨在实现模块化编码和重用，避免为每个查询重新处理完整输入。

Method: 微调Mamba2模型以生成可合并的表示，支持多跳问答、稀疏检索和长文档推理。

Result: 在HotpotQA上，合并十个独立编码的文档几乎达到了交叉编码器在相同输入上的性能。

Conclusion: 文档汤策略在保持准确性的同时，实现了高效的模块化编码和推理。

Abstract: We investigate whether hidden states from Structured State Space Models
(SSMs) can be merged post-hoc to support downstream reasoning. Inspired by
model souping, we propose a strategy where documents are encoded independently
and their representations are pooled -- via simple operations like averaging --
into a single context state. This approach, which we call document souping,
enables modular encoding and reuse without reprocessing the full input for each
query. We finetune Mamba2 models to produce soupable representations and find
that they support multi-hop QA, sparse retrieval, and long-document reasoning
with strong accuracy. On HotpotQA, souping ten independently encoded documents
nearly matches the performance of a cross-encoder trained on the same inputs.

Method: 通过MedPAIR数据集（1,300 QA对）收集医生学员的句子相关性标注，并与LLMs的评估对比，分析其对任务表现的影响。

Result: LLMs与医生学员的相关性判断不一致，过滤无关内容后双方准确率均提高。

Conclusion: LLMs在医学QA任务中的逻辑与医生学员存在差异，优化信息相关性可提升模型表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
various medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks, including standardized
medical exams. However, correct answers alone do not ensure correct logic, and
models may reach accurate conclusions through flawed processes. In this study,
we introduce the MedPAIR (Medical Dataset Comparing Physicians and AI Relevance
Estimation and Question Answering) dataset to evaluate how physician trainees
and LLMs prioritize relevant information when answering QA questions. We obtain
annotations on 1,300 QA pairs from 36 physician trainees, labeling each
sentence within the question components for relevance. We compare these
relevance estimates to those for LLMs, and further evaluate the impact of these
"relevant" subsets on downstream task performance for both physician trainees
and LLMs. We find that LLMs are frequently not aligned with the content
relevance estimates of physician trainees. After filtering out physician
trainee-labeled irrelevant sentences, accuracy improves for both the trainees
and the LLMs. All LLM and physician trainee-labeled data are available at:

Result: 提出Ladder-Score评估方法，首次在统一多模态基准上评估主流通用和中医专用大语言模型。

Conclusion: TCM-Ladder填补了中医多模态评估的空白，数据集和排行榜将持续更新。

Abstract: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), as an effective alternative medicine, has
been receiving increasing attention. In recent years, the rapid development of
large language models (LLMs) tailored for TCM has underscored the need for an
objective and comprehensive evaluation framework to assess their performance on
real-world tasks. However, existing evaluation datasets are limited in scope
and primarily text-based, lacking a unified and standardized multimodal
question-answering (QA) benchmark. To address this issue, we introduce
TCM-Ladder, the first multimodal QA dataset specifically designed for
evaluating large TCM language models. The dataset spans multiple core
disciplines of TCM, including fundamental theory, diagnostics, herbal formulas,
internal medicine, surgery, pharmacognosy, and pediatrics. In addition to
textual content, TCM-Ladder incorporates various modalities such as images and
videos. The datasets were constructed using a combination of automated and
manual filtering processes and comprise 52,000+ questions in total. These
questions include single-choice, multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, diagnostic
dialogue, and visual comprehension tasks. We trained a reasoning model on
TCM-Ladder and conducted comparative experiments against 9 state-of-the-art
general domain and 5 leading TCM-specific LLMs to evaluate their performance on
the datasets. Moreover, we propose Ladder-Score, an evaluation method
specifically designed for TCM question answering that effectively assesses
answer quality regarding terminology usage and semantic expression. To our
knowledge, this is the first work to evaluate mainstream general domain and
TCM-specific LLMs on a unified multimodal benchmark. The datasets and
leaderboard are publicly available at https://tcmladder.com or

Conclusion: HARDTESTS数据集和合成管道在代码生成性能上表现更优，并将开源。

Abstract: Verifiers play a crucial role in large language model (LLM) reasoning, needed
by post-training techniques such as reinforcement learning. However, reliable
verifiers are hard to get for difficult coding problems, because a
well-disguised wrong solution may only be detected by carefully human-written
edge cases that are difficult to synthesize. To address this issue, we propose
HARDTESTGEN, a pipeline for high-quality test synthesis using LLMs. With this
pipeline, we curate a comprehensive competitive programming dataset HARDTESTS
with 47k problems and synthetic high-quality tests. Compared with existing
tests, HARDTESTGEN tests demonstrate precision that is 11.3 percentage points
higher and recall that is 17.5 percentage points higher when evaluating
LLM-generated code. For harder problems, the improvement in precision can be as
large as 40 points. HARDTESTS also proves to be more effective for model
training, measured by downstream code generation performance. We will

Motivation: 医疗领域的电子健康记录（EHR）解释需要专业知识和复杂推理，现有RLVR方法在数学和编程领域成功，但在医疗领域面临挑战。

Method: 采用两阶段解决方案：轻量级监督微调（SFT）注入缺失知识并稳定训练，随后通过RLVR强化正确结果和决策。

Result: 在MEDCALC、TREC CLINICAL TRIALS和EHRSHOT等临床任务中表现出更高的准确性、可解释性和跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: EHRMIND为医疗领域应用RLVR提供了实用指导，显著提升了LLM的能力。

Abstract: We present EHRMIND, a practical recipe for adapting large language models
(LLMs) to complex clinical reasoning tasks using reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR). While RLVR has succeeded in mathematics and coding,
its application to healthcare contexts presents unique challenges due to the
specialized knowledge and reasoning required for electronic health record (EHR)
interpretation. Our pilot study on the MEDCALC benchmark reveals two key
failure modes: (1) misapplied knowledge, where models possess relevant medical
knowledge but apply it incorrectly, and (2) missing knowledge, where models
lack essential domain knowledge. To address these cases, EHRMIND applies a
two-stage solution: a lightweight supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up that
injects missing domain knowledge, stabilizes subsequent training, and
encourages structured, interpretable outputs; followed by RLVR, which
reinforces outcome correctness and refines the model's decision-making. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across diverse clinical
applications, including medical calculations (MEDCALC), patient-trial matching
(TREC CLINICAL TRIALS), and disease diagnosis (EHRSHOT). EHRMIND delivers
consistent gains in accuracy, interpretability, and cross-task generalization.
These findings offer practical guidance for applying RLVR to enhance LLM
capabilities in healthcare settings.

Through a systematic review of nearly 300 publications from 2020--2024 across

non-English languages are rarely studied as a standalone language and that
English safety research exhibits poor language documentation practice. To
motivate future research into multilingual safety, we make several
recommendations based on our survey, and we then pose three concrete future
directions on safety evaluation, training data generation, and crosslingual
safety generalization. Based on our survey and proposed directions, the field

Motivation: 推理模型的长输出导致KV缓存过大，现有压缩方法影响性能，需针对性解决。

Method: 提出R-KV方法，专注于压缩推理模型中的冗余令牌。

Result: R-KV仅用10%的KV缓存即可保留100%性能，内存节省90%，吞吐量提升6.6倍。

Conclusion: R-KV在数学推理数据集上优于现有压缩方法，显著提升效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models have demonstrated impressive performance in self-reflection
and chain-of-thought reasoning. However, they often produce excessively long
outputs, leading to prohibitively large key-value (KV) caches during inference.
While chain-of-thought inference significantly improves performance on complex
reasoning tasks, it can also lead to reasoning failures when deployed with
existing KV cache compression approaches. To address this, we propose
Redundancy-aware KV Cache Compression for Reasoning models (R-KV), a novel
method specifically targeting redundant tokens in reasoning models. Our method
preserves nearly 100% of the full KV cache performance using only 10% of the KV
cache, substantially outperforming existing KV cache baselines, which reach
only 60% of the performance. Remarkably, R-KV even achieves 105% of full KV
cache performance with 16% of the KV cache. This KV-cache reduction also leads
to a 90% memory saving and a 6.6X throughput over standard chain-of-thought
reasoning inference. Experimental results show that R-KV consistently
outperforms existing KV cache compression baselines across two mathematical
reasoning datasets.

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) enhances the performance of large language models
(LLMs) with demonstrations. However, obtaining these demonstrations primarily
relies on manual effort. In most real-world scenarios, users are often
unwilling or unable to provide such demonstrations. Inspired by the human
analogy, we explore a new ICL paradigm CrossICL to study how to utilize
existing source task demonstrations in the ICL for target tasks, thereby
obtaining reliable guidance without any additional manual effort. To explore
this, we first design a two-stage alignment strategy to mitigate the
interference caused by gaps across tasks, as the foundation for our
experimental exploration. Based on it, we conduct comprehensive exploration of
CrossICL, with 875 NLP tasks from the Super-NI benchmark and six types of LLMs,
including GPT-4o. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
CrossICL and provide valuable insights on questions like the criteria for
selecting cross-task demonstrations, as well as the types of task-gap-induced
interference in CrossICL.

Abstract: Training language models with rationales augmentation has been shown to be

lead to several key findings that add new insights upon existing

Rationales can, at times, improve model reliability, even outperforming their
untrained counterparts; 3) A linear correspondence exists in between the
performance and reliability improvements, while both are driven by the
intrinsic difficulty of the task. These findings provide informative

Conclusion: LKD-KGC在构建高质量领域特定知识图谱方面具有显著潜力，无需依赖预定义结构或外部知识。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) structure real-world entities and their relationships
into triples, enhancing machine reasoning for various tasks. While
domain-specific KGs offer substantial benefits, their manual construction is
often inefficient and requires specialized knowledge. Recent approaches for
knowledge graph construction (KGC) based on large language models (LLMs), such
as schema-guided KGC and reference knowledge integration, have proven
efficient. However, these methods are constrained by their reliance on manually
defined schema, single-document processing, and public-domain references,
making them less effective for domain-specific corpora that exhibit complex
knowledge dependencies and specificity, as well as limited reference knowledge.
To address these challenges, we propose LKD-KGC, a novel framework for
unsupervised domain-specific KG construction. LKD-KGC autonomously analyzes
document repositories to infer knowledge dependencies, determines optimal
processing sequences via LLM driven prioritization, and autoregressively
generates entity schema by integrating hierarchical inter-document contexts.
This schema guides the unsupervised extraction of entities and relationships,
eliminating reliance on predefined structures or external knowledge. Extensive
experiments show that compared with state-of-the-art baselines, LKD-KGC
generally achieves improvements of 10% to 20% in both precision and recall
rate, demonstrating its potential in constructing high-quality domain-specific
KGs.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出Mixed-R1框架，通过混合奖励函数（Mixed-Reward）和混合后训练数据集（Mixed-45K）解决多源MLLM任务的稳定强化学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究仅针对MLLM的单一任务进行优化，缺乏多任务稳定强化学习的统一方法。

Method: 设计数据引擎构建Mixed-45K数据集，并提出包含四种奖励函数的Mixed-Reward框架，包括匹配奖励、图表奖励、IoU奖励和开放式奖励（BMAS）。

Result: 实验证明Mixed-R1在多种MLLM（如Qwen2.5-VL和Intern-VL）上有效。

Conclusion: Mixed-R1为多源MLLM任务提供了一种统一的强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: Recent works on large language models (LLMs) have successfully demonstrated
the emergence of reasoning capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL).
Although recent efforts leverage group relative policy optimization (GRPO) for
MLLMs post-training, they constantly explore one specific aspect, such as
grounding tasks, math problems, or chart analysis. There are no works that can
leverage multi-source MLLM tasks for stable reinforcement learning. In this
work, we present a unified perspective to solve this problem. We present
Mixed-R1, a unified yet straightforward framework that contains a mixed reward
function design (Mixed-Reward) and a mixed post-training dataset (Mixed-45K).
We first design a data engine to select high-quality examples to build the
Mixed-45K post-training dataset. Then, we present a Mixed-Reward design, which
contains various reward functions for various MLLM tasks. In particular, it has
four different reward functions: matching reward for binary answer or
multiple-choice problems, chart reward for chart-aware datasets, IoU reward for
grounding problems, and open-ended reward for long-form text responses such as
caption datasets. To handle the various long-form text content, we propose a
new open-ended reward named Bidirectional Max-Average Similarity (BMAS) by
leveraging tokenizer embedding matching between the generated response and the
ground truth. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of our proposed
method on various MLLMs, including Qwen2.5-VL and Intern-VL on various sizes.

TL;DR: Tag-Evol是一种多样且高效的指令演化方法，通过知识标签实现可控演化，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定策略，需手动设计且形式单一，迭代演化获取困难样本成本高。

Method: 使用多样化的知识标签作为策略，通过注入不同标签组合实现可控演化。

Result: 实验表明，Tag-Evol生成的演化数据显著优于其他方法，且更高效、多样和具有挑战性。

Conclusion: Tag-Evol是一种高效、多样化的指令演化方法，能生成更优质的数据。

Abstract: Evol-Instruct has made significant improvements as a data synthesis method in
several areas. Existing methods typically rely on a fixed set of strategies to
evolve, which require manual design and are monolithic in form. In addition,
iterative evolution also makes the acquisition of hard samples expensive. In
view of this, we propose the Tag-Evol framework, a more diverse and efficient
instruction evolving method. Specifically, Tag-Evol uses diverse and specific
knowledge tags as strategies to achieve controlled evolution by injecting
different combinations of tags into the original instructions. Experiments with
multiple backbones in diverse domain benchmarks show that the proposed method
generates significantly better evolved data than other methods. Furthermore, we
conduct a thorough analysis of the evolved data, demonstrating that Tag-Evol is
not only efficient but also generates more diverse and challenging data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA合并方法适应性有限且未解决低资源问题，需改进以适应更广泛任务。

Method: 提出一种LoRA合并方法，通过微调更新和修剪LoRA参数，实现更细粒度的调整。

Result: 在多种领域和语言（英语、日语）的实验中，新方法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了LoRA在低资源任务中的适应性，具有广泛潜力。

Abstract: This study proposes a simple yet effective LoRA merge method to achieve LLM
adaptation for low-resource language generation tasks. The LoRA merge
technique, which integrates multiple LoRA modules trained on different tasks,
has gained attention as an effective and efficient approach for adapting LLMs
to target tasks. However, previous methods are limited in adaptability as they
keep the LoRA parameters frozen. Additionally, the low-resource problem has
been out of their scope. We propose a LoRA merge method that updates and prunes
LoRA parameters through fine-tuning with minimal target task data, which allows
finer-grained adjustments of LoRA parameters and enhancement of task
adaptability. Extensive experiments have been conducted taking summarization as
a benchmark task. Our datasets cover various domains and multiple languages of
English and Japanese. The results confirm that the proposed method achieves
significant and consistent improvements in task adaptability over the previous
methods.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文挑战了LLM可靠性随序列长度指数衰减的假设，提出错误集中在少数关键令牌上，并引入新公式解释其长期连贯性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有假设认为LLM错误随序列长度指数增长，限制了长自回归输出的性能，但作者认为错误分布不均，集中在关键令牌上。

Method: 通过区分高影响力令牌与可预测多数令牌，提出新可靠性公式，并设计针对性策略（如动态计算分配和多路径探索）。

Result: 研究表明，长上下文性能依赖于关键语义决策点，而非均匀令牌级准确性，新策略显著优于暴力方法。

Conclusion: 论文提出以语义关键令牌为中心的下一代系统框架，从单纯规模扩展转向战略推理，有望实现更高性能和效率。

Abstract: The prevailing assumption of an exponential decay in large language model
(LLM) reliability with sequence length, predicated on independent per-token
error probabilities, posits an inherent limitation for long autoregressive
outputs. Our research fundamentally challenges this view by synthesizing
emerging evidence that LLM errors are not uniformly distributed but are
concentrated at sparse "key tokens" ($5-10\%$ of total tokens) representing
critical decision junctions. By distinguishing these high-impact tokens from
the increasingly predictable majority, we introduce a new reliability formula
explaining the sustained coherence of modern LLMs over thousands of tokens.
Converging research streams reveal that long-context performance primarily
depends on accurately navigating a few crucial semantic decision points rather
than on uniform token-level accuracy, enabling targeted strategies that
significantly outperform brute-force approaches. We thus propose a framework
for next-generation systems centered on selective preservation of semantically
vital tokens, dynamic computational allocation at uncertain decision
boundaries, multi-path exploration at ambiguities, and architectures aligned
with natural semantic domains. This marks a fundamental shift from raw scaling
to strategic reasoning, promising breakthrough performance without
proportionate computational scaling and offering a more nuanced understanding
that supersedes the exponential decay hypothesis, thereby opening pathways
toward substantially more powerful and efficient language systems.

TL;DR: CLaSp是一种无需额外训练或模块的自推测解码方法，通过跳过中间层构建压缩草案模型，动态优化层跳过策略，实现1.3x~1.7x加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推测解码方法需额外训练模块且兼容性差，CLaSp旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用上下文层跳过策略，动态编程算法优化层跳过过程。

Result: 在LLaMA3系列模型上实现1.3x~1.7x加速，保持生成文本原分布。

Conclusion: CLaSp是一种高效、兼容性强的自推测解码方法。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) is a promising method for accelerating the decoding
process of Large Language Models (LLMs). The efficiency of SD primarily hinges
on the consistency between the draft model and the verify model. However,
existing drafting approaches typically require additional modules to be
trained, which can be challenging to implement and ensure compatibility across
various LLMs. In this paper, we propose CLaSp, an in-context layer-skipping
strategy for self-speculative decoding. Unlike prior methods, CLaSp does not
require additional drafting modules or extra training. Instead, it employs a
plug-and-play mechanism by skipping intermediate layers of the verify model to
construct a compressed draft model. Specifically, we develop a dynamic
programming algorithm that optimizes the layer-skipping process by leveraging
the complete hidden states from the last verification stage as an objective.
This enables CLaSp to dynamically adjust its layer-skipping strategy after each
verification stage, without relying on pre-optimized sets of skipped layers.
Experimental results across diverse downstream tasks demonstrate that CLaSp
achieves a speedup of 1.3x ~ 1.7x on LLaMA3 series models without altering the
original distribution of the generated text.

*Yimin Du*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于直觉模糊集（IFS）的新框架，用于建模和聚合人类偏好数据，解决了传统方法在不确定性和标注者分歧上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人类偏好标注方法（如SBS）存在不确定性、标注者分歧和偏好判断复杂性的问题，影响了大型语言模型（LLM）的训练和评估质量。

Method: 采用直觉模糊集（IFS）建模偏好数据，通过隶属度、非隶属度和犹豫度捕捉人类判断的复杂性和不确定性，并提出新的标注协议和聚合方法。

Result: 实验表明，IFS方法显著提高了标注一致性，减少了标注疲劳，数据质量优于传统方法，下游任务中模型性能提升12.3%，标注时间减少15.7%。

Conclusion: IFS框架为处理人类偏好标注中的不确定性提供了理论支持，并在大规模LLM训练中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The quality of human preference data is crucial for training and evaluating
large language models (LLMs), particularly in reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) and direct preference optimization (DPO) scenarios. Traditional
side-by-side (SBS) annotation approaches often struggle with inherent
uncertainty, annotator disagreement, and the complexity of preference
judgments. This paper introduces a novel framework based on intuitionistic
fuzzy sets (IFS) for modeling and aggregating human preferences in LLM data
annotation tasks. Our approach captures not only the degree of preference but
also the uncertainty and hesitation inherent in human judgment through
membership, non-membership, and hesitation degrees. We propose an IFS-based
annotation protocol that enables more nuanced preference modeling, develops
aggregation methods for handling annotator disagreement, and introduces quality
metrics for preference data assessment. Experimental validation on multiple
datasets demonstrates that our IFS-based approach significantly improves
annotation consistency, reduces annotator fatigue, and produces higher-quality
preference data compared to traditional binary and Likert-scale methods. The
resulting preference datasets lead to improved model performance in downstream
tasks, with 12.3\% improvement in win-rate against baseline models and 15.7\%
reduction in annotation time. Our framework provides a principled approach to
handling uncertainty in human preference annotation and offers practical
benefits for large-scale LLM training.

Motivation: 探究统一的多模态生成模型是否能真正实现跨模态一致性，还是仅仅表面上的感知。

Method: 引入ACON数据集（1000张图像，含配对文本和编辑指令），采用三种一致性标准（循环一致性、前向等变性和共轭等变性）进行评估。

Result: 统一模型在点对点评估中未优于专用模型，但在结构化分析中显示出弱一致性。

Conclusion: 统一模型在跨模态一致性上表现有限，但通过结构化分析可观察到弱一致性。

Abstract: Any-to-any generative models aim to enable seamless interpretation and
generation across multiple modalities within a unified framework, yet their
ability to preserve relationships across modalities remains uncertain. Do
unified models truly achieve cross-modal coherence, or is this coherence merely
perceived? To explore this, we introduce ACON, a dataset of 1,000 images (500
newly contributed) paired with captions, editing instructions, and Q&A pairs to
evaluate cross-modal transfers rigorously. Using three consistency
criteria-cyclic consistency, forward equivariance, and conjugated
equivariance-our experiments reveal that any-to-any models do not consistently
demonstrate greater cross-modal consistency than specialized models in
pointwise evaluations such as cyclic consistency. However, equivariance
evaluations uncover weak but observable consistency through structured analyses
of the intermediate latent space enabled by multiple editing operations. We
release our code and data at https://github.com/JiwanChung/ACON.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出半结构化推理模型（SSRMs），通过内部化半结构化的思维链（CoT）推理格式，生成Python风格的推理轨迹，以提高推理的可分析性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的推理过程中存在‘忠实性’问题，推理轨迹可能包含难以检测的错误和遗漏，掩盖模型输出的偏见。

Method: 引入SSRMs，采用半结构化CoT推理格式，生成Python风格的推理轨迹，限制任务特定词汇标记推理步骤的输入输出。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，SSRMs表现优异，领域内任务优于基线近十个百分点，领域外医学任务与专业模型竞争。

Conclusion: 半结构化推理更易于分析，可通过手工或学习型审计自动检测推理缺陷，有效标记潜在错误。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly capable at reasoning, the
problem of "faithfulness" persists: LLM "reasoning traces" can contain errors
and omissions that are difficult to detect, and may obscure biases in model
outputs. To address these limitations, we introduce Semi-Structured Reasoning
Models (SSRMs), which internalize a semi-structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
reasoning format within the model. Our SSRMs generate reasoning traces in a
Pythonic syntax. While SSRM traces are not executable, they adopt a restricted,
task-specific vocabulary to name distinct reasoning steps, and to mark each
step's inputs and outputs. Through extensive evaluation on ten benchmarks,
SSRMs demonstrate strong performance and generality: they outperform comparably
sized baselines by nearly ten percentage points on in-domain tasks while
remaining competitive with specialized models on out-of-domain medical
benchmarks. Furthermore, we show that semi-structured reasoning is more
amenable to analysis: in particular, they can be automatically audited to
identify reasoning flaws. We explore both hand-crafted structured audits, which
detect task-specific problematic reasoning patterns, and learned typicality
audits, which apply probabilistic models over reasoning patterns, and show that
both audits can be used to effectively flag probable reasoning errors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督关键词预测方法依赖启发式重要性评分，可能导致信息性估计不准确且缺乏时间效率考量。

Method: ERU-KG包含信息性和短语性模块，前者通过参考（如查询、引用上下文和标题）学习信息性，后者生成候选关键词。

Result: ERU-KG在关键词生成基准测试中优于无监督基线，性能接近监督模型，且在文本检索任务中表现实用。

Conclusion: ERU-KG在性能、效率和灵活性上均表现优异，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Unsupervised keyphrase prediction has gained growing interest in recent
years. However, existing methods typically rely on heuristically defined
importance scores, which may lead to inaccurate informativeness estimation. In
addition, they lack consideration for time efficiency. To solve these problems,
we propose ERU-KG, an unsupervised keyphrase generation (UKG) model that
consists of an informativeness and a phraseness module. The former estimates
the relevance of keyphrase candidates, while the latter generate those
candidates. The informativeness module innovates by learning to model
informativeness through references (e.g., queries, citation contexts, and
titles) and at the term-level, thereby 1) capturing how the key concepts of
documents are perceived in different contexts and 2) estimating informativeness
of phrases more efficiently by aggregating term informativeness, removing the
need for explicit modeling of the candidates. ERU-KG demonstrates its
effectiveness on keyphrase generation benchmarks by outperforming unsupervised
baselines and achieving on average 89\% of the performance of a supervised
model for top 10 predictions. Additionally, to highlight its practical utility,
we evaluate the model on text retrieval tasks and show that keyphrases
generated by ERU-KG are effective when employed as query and document
expansions. Furthermore, inference speed tests reveal that ERU-KG is the
fastest among baselines of similar model sizes. Finally, our proposed model can
switch between keyphrase generation and extraction by adjusting
hyperparameters, catering to diverse application requirements.

Conclusion: SRRG任务和SRR-BERT模型为放射学报告生成提供了更清晰、一致的结构化解决方案。

Abstract: Automated radiology report generation from chest X-ray (CXR) images has the
potential to improve clinical efficiency and reduce radiologists' workload.
However, most datasets, including the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert
Plus, consist entirely of free-form reports, which are inherently variable and
unstructured. This variability poses challenges for both generation and
evaluation: existing models struggle to produce consistent, clinically
meaningful reports, and standard evaluation metrics fail to capture the nuances
of radiological interpretation. To address this, we introduce Structured
Radiology Report Generation (SRRG), a new task that reformulates free-text
radiology reports into a standardized format, ensuring clarity, consistency,
and structured clinical reporting. We create a novel dataset by restructuring
reports using large language models (LLMs) following strict structured
reporting desiderata. Additionally, we introduce SRR-BERT, a fine-grained
disease classification model trained on 55 labels, enabling more precise and
clinically informed evaluation of structured reports. To assess report quality,
we propose F1-SRR-BERT, a metric that leverages SRR-BERT's hierarchical disease
taxonomy to bridge the gap between free-text variability and structured
clinical reporting. We validate our dataset through a reader study conducted by
five board-certified radiologists and extensive benchmarking experiments.

Result: 在越南语数据集上，该方法达到与非流式ITN相当的准确性，优于现有流式ITN模型，同时保持低延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法为流式ASR系统提供了高效、准确的ITN解决方案，适用于资源受限场景。

Abstract: Inverse Text Normalization (ITN) is crucial for converting spoken Automatic
Speech Recognition (ASR) outputs into well-formatted written text, enhancing
both readability and usability. Despite its importance, the integration of
streaming ITN within streaming ASR remains largely unexplored due to challenges
in accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability, particularly in low-resource and
limited-context scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a streaming pretrained
language model for ITN, leveraging pretrained linguistic representations for
improved robustness. To address streaming constraints, we propose Dynamic
Context-Aware during training and inference, enabling adaptive chunk size
adjustments and the integration of right-context information. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method achieves accuracy comparable to
non-streaming ITN and surpasses existing streaming ITN models on a Vietnamese
dataset, all while maintaining low latency, ensuring seamless integration into
ASR systems.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模语言模型参数增加虽提升性能，但带来计算负担，研究发现优势参数对性能起关键作用。

Method: 提出APEX方法，逐步扩展优势参数至劣势参数空间，提升其比例。

Result: 指令微调中APEX仅用52%参数优于全参数微调；持续预训练中仅需33%数据达到相同困惑度。

Conclusion: APEX通过优化参数分布显著提升训练效率与模型性能。

Abstract: Although scaling up the number of trainable parameters in both pre-training
and fine-tuning can effectively improve the performance of large language
models, it also leads to increased computational overhead. When delving into
the parameter difference, we find that a subset of parameters, termed
advantageous parameters, plays a crucial role in determining model performance.
Further analysis reveals that stronger models tend to possess more such
parameters. In this paper, we propose Advantageous Parameter EXpansion Training
(APEX), a method that progressively expands advantageous parameters into the
space of disadvantageous ones, thereby increasing their proportion and
enhancing training effectiveness. Further theoretical analysis from the
perspective of matrix effective rank explains the performance gains of APEX.
Extensive experiments on both instruction tuning and continued pre-training
demonstrate that, in instruction tuning, APEX outperforms full-parameter tuning
while using only 52% of the trainable parameters. In continued pre-training,
APEX achieves the same perplexity level as conventional training with just 33%
of the training data, and yields significant improvements on downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 研究为理解Mamba模型的内部运作提供了统一视角，并揭示了语言模型的潜在通用特性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the flow of factual information in Mamba State-Space
Model (SSM)-based language models. We rely on theoretical and empirical
connections to Transformer-based architectures and their attention mechanisms.
Exploiting this relationship, we adapt attentional interpretability techniques
originally developed for Transformers--specifically, the Attention Knockout
methodology--to both Mamba-1 and Mamba-2. Using them we trace how information
is transmitted and localized across tokens and layers, revealing patterns of
subject-token information emergence and layer-wise dynamics. Notably, some
phenomena vary between mamba models and Transformer based models, while others
appear universally across all models inspected--hinting that these may be
inherent to LLMs in general. By further leveraging Mamba's structured
factorization, we disentangle how distinct "features" either enable
token-to-token information exchange or enrich individual tokens, thus offering
a unified lens to understand Mamba internal operations.

Conclusion: 该框架在多轮搜索系统中显著提升了目标跟踪准确性和交互质量，同时降低了延迟。

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly advanced
multi-turn conversation systems, emphasizing the need for proactive guidance to
enhance users' interactions. However, these systems face challenges in
dynamically adapting to shifts in users' goals and maintaining low latency for
real-time interactions. In the Baidu Search AI assistant, an industrial-scale
multi-turn search system, we propose a novel two-phase framework to provide
proactive guidance. The first phase, Goal-adaptive Supervised Fine-Tuning
(G-SFT), employs a goal adaptation agent that dynamically adapts to user goal
shifts and provides goal-relevant contextual information. G-SFT also
incorporates scalable knowledge transfer to distill insights from LLMs into a
lightweight model for real-time interaction. The second phase, Click-oriented
Reinforcement Learning (C-RL), adopts a generate-rank paradigm, systematically
constructs preference pairs from user click signals, and proactively improves
click-through rates through more engaging guidance. This dual-phase
architecture achieves complementary objectives: G-SFT ensures accurate goal
tracking, while C-RL optimizes interaction quality through click signal-driven
reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
achieves 86.10% accuracy in offline evaluation (+23.95% over baseline) and
25.28% CTR in online deployment (149.06% relative improvement), while reducing
inference latency by 69.55% through scalable knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in simulating human
behaviors and performing theory-of-mind (ToM) reasoning, a crucial skill for
complex social interactions. In this study, we investigate the role of ToM
reasoning in aligning agentic behaviors with human norms in negotiation tasks,
using the ultimatum game as a controlled environment. We initialized LLM agents
with different prosocial beliefs (including Greedy, Fair, and Selfless) and
reasoning methods like chain-of-thought (CoT) and varying ToM levels, and
examined their decision-making processes across diverse LLMs, including
reasoning models like o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Qwen 32B. Results from
2,700 simulations indicated that ToM reasoning enhances behavior alignment,
decision-making consistency, and negotiation outcomes. Consistent with previous
findings, reasoning models exhibit limited capability compared to models with
ToM reasoning, different roles of the game benefits with different orders of
ToM reasoning. Our findings contribute to the understanding of ToM's role in
enhancing human-AI interaction and cooperative decision-making. The code used

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）性能提升，但训练数据不透明可能导致评估集污染，影响结果公平性。现有泄漏检测方法未在模拟泄漏条件下评估。

Method: 比较排列和n-gram泄漏检测方法，提出semi-half question方法，优化技术以支持实例级检测。

Result: n-gram方法F1得分最高。清理后的MMLU和HellaSwag数据集重新评估LLM。

Conclusion: 建议将污染检查作为标准步骤，以提高评估的可靠性和透明度。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) continues to improve, as
reflected in rising scores on standard benchmarks. However, the lack of
transparency around training data raises concerns about potential overlap with
evaluation sets and the fairness of reported results. Although prior work has
proposed methods for detecting data leakage, these approaches primarily focus
on identifying outliers and have not been evaluated under controlled simulated
leakage conditions. In this work, we compare existing leakage detection
techniques, namely permutation and n-gram-based methods, under a continual
pretraining setup that simulates real-world leakage scenarios, and additionally
explore a lightweight method we call semi-half question. Although semi-half
offers a low-cost alternative, our analysis shows that the n-gram method
consistently achieves the highest F1-score. We also refine these techniques to
support instance-level detection and reduce computational overhead. Leveraging
the best-performing method, we create cleaned versions of MMLU and HellaSwag,
and re-evaluate several LLMs. Our findings present a practical path toward more
reliable and transparent evaluations, and we recommend contamination checks as
a standard step before releasing benchmark results.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了如何通过结合大型语言模型（LLMs）和定理证明器（TPs）来改进自然语言推理（NLI）解释的忠实性和鲁棒性，提出了四种策略以减少语义信息丢失和提升验证效率。

Motivation: 现有方法在将自然语言转换为机器可验证形式时存在语义信息丢失和解释不忠实的问题，且LLMs在逻辑结构和严格证明构建方面仍有局限。

Method: 提出了四种策略：1）减少自动形式化中的语义损失；2）高效识别并修正逻辑表示中的语法错误；3）使用逻辑表达式引导LLMs生成结构化证明草图；4）提升LLMs对TP反馈的迭代优化能力。

Result: 在e-SNLI、QASC和WorldTree数据集上，自动形式化和解释优化分别提升了18.46%-39.77%和29.5%-51.5%，验证效率显著提高。

Conclusion: 通过特定干预策略，LLM-TP混合架构在NLI解释的忠实性、鲁棒性和效率上取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Natural language explanations play a fundamental role in Natural Language
Inference (NLI) by revealing how premises logically entail hypotheses. Recent
work has shown that the interaction of large language models (LLMs) with
theorem provers (TPs) can help verify and improve the validity of NLI
explanations. However, TPs require translating natural language into
machine-verifiable formal representations, a process that introduces the risk
of semantic information loss and unfaithful interpretation, an issue compounded
by LLMs' challenges in capturing critical logical structures with sufficient
precision. Moreover, LLMs are still limited in their capacity for rigorous and
robust proof construction within formal verification frameworks. To mitigate
issues related to faithfulness and robustness, this paper investigates
strategies to (1) alleviate semantic loss during autoformalisation, (2)
efficiently identify and correct syntactic errors in logical representations,
(3) explicitly use logical expressions to guide LLMs in generating structured
proof sketches, and (4) increase LLMs' capacity of interpreting TP's feedback
for iterative refinement. Our empirical results on e-SNLI, QASC and WorldTree
using different LLMs demonstrate that the proposed strategies yield significant
improvements in autoformalisation (+18.46%, +34.2%, +39.77%) and explanation
refinement (+29.5%, +51.5%, +41.25%) over the state-of-the-art model. Moreover,
we show that specific interventions on the hybrid LLM-TP architecture can
substantially improve efficiency, drastically reducing the number of iterations
required for successful verification.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: ScienceMeter框架评估LLMs科学知识更新能力，包括知识保留、获取和预测，发现现有方法仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs科学知识快速过时的问题，评估其知识更新能力。

Method: 提出ScienceMeter框架，定义三个指标（知识保留、获取、预测），并在多领域数据集上测试五种更新方法。

Result: 最佳方法仅保留85.9%旧知识，获取71.7%新知识，预测37.7%未来知识，跨领域表现相关。

Conclusion: 现有方法难以全面满足科学知识更新需求，开发更鲁棒的机制至关重要且具挑战性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to support scientific
research, but their knowledge of scientific advancements can quickly become
outdated. We introduce ScienceMeter, a new framework for evaluating scientific
knowledge update methods over scientific knowledge spanning the past, present,
and future. ScienceMeter defines three metrics: knowledge preservation, the
extent to which models' understanding of previously learned papers are
preserved; knowledge acquisition, how well scientific claims from newly
introduced papers are acquired; and knowledge projection, the ability of the
updated model to anticipate or generalize to related scientific claims that may
emerge in the future. Using ScienceMeter, we examine the scientific knowledge
of LLMs on claim judgment and generation tasks across a curated dataset of
15,444 scientific papers and 30,888 scientific claims from ten domains
including medicine, biology, materials science, and computer science. We
evaluate five representative knowledge update approaches including training-
and inference-time methods. With extensive experiments, we find that the
best-performing knowledge update methods can preserve only 85.9% of existing
knowledge, acquire 71.7% of new knowledge, and project 37.7% of future
knowledge. Inference-based methods work for larger models, whereas smaller
models require training to achieve comparable performance. Cross-domain
analysis reveals that performance on these objectives is correlated. Even when
applying on specialized scientific LLMs, existing knowledge update methods fail
to achieve these objectives collectively, underscoring that developing robust
scientific knowledge update mechanisms is both crucial and challenging.

Motivation: LLMs在长文本修改中存在不必要修改和遗漏关键修改的问题，影响文档连贯性。

Method: 提出HiCaM框架，结合分层摘要树和因果图进行修改。

Result: 在多领域数据集上评估，HiCaM的胜率高达79.50%，性能显著优于现有LLMs。

Conclusion: HiCaM在多个模型和领域中表现一致，验证了其全面性和有效性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains. However, when handling long-form text modification tasks, they still
face two major problems: (1) producing undesired modifications by
inappropriately altering or summarizing irrelevant content, and (2) missing
necessary modifications to implicitly related passages that are crucial for
maintaining document coherence. To address these issues, we propose HiCaM, a
Hierarchical-Causal Modification framework that operates through a hierarchical
summary tree and a causal graph. Furthermore, to evaluate HiCaM, we derive a
multi-domain dataset from various benchmarks, providing a resource for
assessing its effectiveness. Comprehensive evaluations on the dataset
demonstrate significant improvements over strong LLMs, with our method
achieving up to a 79.50\% win rate. These results highlight the
comprehensiveness of our approach, showing consistent performance improvements
across multiple models and domains.

propose a multi-perspective role-playing framework to simulate the process of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态提示规则或基于维基百科的训练，无法适应真实网络环境中的模糊性和噪声。论文旨在解决LLMs动态调整搜索策略的能力不足问题。

Method: 提出DeepDiver强化学习框架，结合WebPuzzle数据集（24K训练实例和275测试问题），通过自适应搜索策略训练模型。

Result: 实验显示，DeepDiver加持的Pangu-7B-Reasoner在真实网络任务中表现接近671B参数的DeepSeek-R1。

Conclusion: 论文通过SIS概念和DeepDiver框架，推动了LLMs在自适应信息搜索方面的进步，并为未来研究提供了基准和数据集。

Abstract: Information seeking demands iterative evidence gathering and reflective
reasoning, yet large language models (LLMs) still struggle with it in open-web
question answering. Existing methods rely on static prompting rules or training
with Wikipedia-based corpora and retrieval environments, limiting adaptability
to the real-world web environment where ambiguity, conflicting evidence, and
noise are prevalent. These constrained training settings hinder LLMs from
learning to dynamically decide when and where to search, and how to adjust
search depth and frequency based on informational demands. We define this
missing capacity as Search Intensity Scaling (SIS)--the emergent skill to
intensify search efforts under ambiguous or conflicting conditions, rather than
settling on overconfident, under-verification answers.
  To study SIS, we introduce WebPuzzle, the first dataset designed to foster
information-seeking behavior in open-world internet environments. WebPuzzle
consists of 24K training instances and 275 test questions spanning both
wiki-based and open-web queries. Building on this dataset, we propose
DeepDiver, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework that promotes SIS by
encouraging adaptive search policies through exploration under a real-world
open-web environment. Experimental results show that Pangu-7B-Reasoner
empowered by DeepDiver achieve performance on real-web tasks comparable to the
671B-parameter DeepSeek-R1. We detail DeepDiver's training curriculum from
cold-start supervised fine-tuning to a carefully designed RL phase, and present
that its capability of SIS generalizes from closed-form QA to open-ended tasks
such as long-form writing. Our contributions advance adaptive information
seeking in LLMs and provide a valuable benchmark and dataset for future
research.

Method: 提出了3种扰动策略和8种具体方法，构建了一个数据集，并评估了9种SOTA LLMs的表现。同时探索了ICL和SFT等低成本增强方案。

Result: LLMs对扰动后的多模态中文有毒内容检测能力较弱；少量示例的ICL或SFT可能导致模型过度修正，误判正常内容为有毒。

Abstract: Detecting toxic content using language models is important but challenging.
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
understanding Chinese, recent studies show that simple character substitutions
in toxic Chinese text can easily confuse the state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs. In
this paper, we highlight the multimodal nature of Chinese language as a key
challenge for deploying LLMs in toxic Chinese detection. First, we propose a
taxonomy of 3 perturbation strategies and 8 specific approaches in toxic
Chinese content. Then, we curate a dataset based on this taxonomy, and
benchmark 9 SOTA LLMs (from both the US and China) to assess if they can detect
perturbed toxic Chinese text. Additionally, we explore cost-effective
enhancement solutions like in-context learning (ICL) and supervised fine-tuning
(SFT). Our results reveal two important findings. (1) LLMs are less capable of
detecting perturbed multimodal Chinese toxic contents. (2) ICL or SFT with a
small number of perturbed examples may cause the LLMs "overcorrect'':
misidentify many normal Chinese contents as toxic.

Motivation: 传统ASR错误校正方法效果有限，LLM虽无需训练数据但存在幻觉问题，需解决。

Method: 提出RLLM-CF框架，包括错误预检测、链式思维子任务迭代校正和推理过程验证三阶段。

Result: 在多个数据集上，GPT-4o结合RLLM-CF使CER/WER相对降低21%、11%、9%和11.4%。

Conclusion: RLLM-CF无需额外信息或微调，能有效避免LLM幻觉问题，显著提升ASR校正效果。

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) error correction aims to correct
recognition errors while preserving accurate text. Although traditional
approaches demonstrate moderate effectiveness, LLMs offer a paradigm that
eliminates the need for training and labeled data. However, directly using LLMs
will encounter hallucinations problem, which may lead to the modification of
the correct text. To address this problem, we propose the Reliable LLM
Correction Framework (RLLM-CF), which consists of three stages: (1) error
pre-detection, (2) chain-of-thought sub-tasks iterative correction, and (3)
reasoning process verification. The advantage of our method is that it does not
require additional information or fine-tuning of the model, and ensures the
correctness of the LLM correction under multi-pass programming. Experiments on
AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2, and Librispeech show that the GPT-4o model enhanced by
our framework achieves 21%, 11%, 9%, and 11.4% relative reductions in CER/WER.

Abstract: Language agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in understanding, reasoning, and executing complex
tasks. However, developing robust agents presents significant challenges:
substantial engineering overhead, lack of standardized components, and
insufficient evaluation frameworks for fair comparison. We introduce Agent
Graph-based Orchestration for Reasoning and Assessment (AGORA), a flexible and
extensible framework that addresses these challenges through three key
contributions: (1) a modular architecture with a graph-based workflow engine,
efficient memory management, and clean component abstraction; (2) a
comprehensive suite of reusable agent algorithms implementing state-of-the-art
reasoning approaches; and (3) a rigorous evaluation framework enabling
systematic comparison across multiple dimensions. Through extensive experiments
on mathematical reasoning and multimodal tasks, we evaluate various agent
algorithms across different LLMs, revealing important insights about their
relative strengths and applicability. Our results demonstrate that while
sophisticated reasoning approaches can enhance agent capabilities, simpler
methods like Chain-of-Thought often exhibit robust performance with
significantly lower computational overhead. AGORA not only simplifies language
agent development but also establishes a foundation for reproducible agent
research through standardized evaluation protocols.

Result: 模型在SP-10、PHOENIX14T和CSL-Daily三个基准测试中表现优异，支持10种手语和多种翻译任务。

Conclusion: 该模型为多语言手语翻译提供了有效解决方案，显著提升了翻译性能。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language (SL) videos
into spoken language text, thereby bridging the communication gap between the
sign and the spoken community. While most existing works focus on translating a
single sign language into a single spoken language (one-to-one SLT), leveraging
multilingual resources could mitigate low-resource issues and enhance
accessibility. However, multilingual SLT (MLSLT) remains unexplored due to
language conflicts and alignment difficulties across SLs and spoken languages.
To address these challenges, we propose a multilingual gloss-free model with
dual CTC objectives for token-level SL identification and spoken text
generation. Our model supports 10 SLs and handles one-to-one, many-to-one, and
many-to-many SLT tasks, achieving competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods on three widely adopted benchmarks: multilingual
SP-10, PHOENIX14T, and CSL-Daily.

Result: LLM分类器在推理开始前即表现良好，早期表示包含关键信息；BERT依赖浅层语言线索表现较差。

Conclusion: 早期表示支持早期停止推理，未来可通过监督或强化学习优化CoT链长度。

Abstract: We investigate whether the success of a zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
process can be predicted before completion. We discover that a probing
classifier, based on LLM representations, performs well \emph{even before a
single token is generated}, suggesting that crucial information about the
reasoning process is already present in the initial steps representations. In
contrast, a strong BERT-based baseline, which relies solely on the generated
tokens, performs worse, likely because it depends on shallow linguistic cues
rather than deeper reasoning dynamics. Surprisingly, using later reasoning
steps does not always improve classification. When additional context is
unhelpful, earlier representations resemble later ones more, suggesting LLMs
encode key information early. This implies reasoning can often stop early
without loss. To test this, we conduct early stopping experiments, showing that
truncating CoT reasoning still improves performance over not using CoT at all,
though a gap remains compared to full reasoning. However, approaches like
supervised learning or reinforcement learning designed to shorten CoT chains
could leverage our classifier's guidance to identify when early stopping is
effective. Our findings provide insights that may support such methods, helping
to optimize CoT's efficiency while preserving its benefits.\footnote{Code and

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have enhanced
natural-language reasoning. However, their limited parametric memory and
susceptibility to hallucination present persistent challenges for tasks
requiring accurate, context-based inference. To overcome these limitations, an
increasing number of studies have proposed leveraging external knowledge to
enhance LLMs. This study offers a systematic exploration of strategies for
using external knowledge to enhance LLMs, beginning with a taxonomy that
categorizes external knowledge into unstructured and structured data. We then
focus on structured knowledge, presenting distinct taxonomies for tables and
knowledge graphs (KGs), detailing their integration paradigms with LLMs, and
reviewing representative methods. Our comparative analysis further highlights
the trade-offs among interpretability, scalability, and performance, providing
insights for developing trustworthy and generalizable knowledge-enhanced LLMs.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) augments Large Language Models (LLMs)
with external knowledge to improve factuality. However, existing RAG systems
frequently underutilize the retrieved documents, failing to extract and
integrate the key clues needed to support faithful and interpretable reasoning,
especially in cases where relevant evidence is implicit, scattered, or obscured
by noise. To address this issue, we propose ClueAnchor, a novel framework for
enhancing RAG via clue-anchored reasoning exploration and optimization.
ClueAnchor extracts key clues from retrieved content and generates multiple
reasoning paths based on different knowledge configurations, optimizing the
model by selecting the most effective one through reward-based preference
optimization. Experiments show that ClueAnchor significantly outperforms prior
RAG baselines in reasoning completeness and robustness. Further analysis
confirms its strong resilience to noisy or partially relevant retrieved
content, as well as its capability to identify supporting evidence even in the
absence of explicit clue supervision during inference.

Abstract: Multilingual large language models (LLMs) open up new possibilities for
leveraging information across languages, but their factual knowledge recall
remains inconsistent depending on the input language. While previous studies
have attempted to address this issue through English-based prompting and
evaluation, we explore non-English to English transfer via Language and Thought
Theory. This perspective allows us to examine language-thought binding in LLMs
and uncover why factual knowledge often fails to transfer effectively. We
propose the Language-to-Thought (L2T) prompting strategy, which analyzes the
relationship between input language, internal cognitive processes, and
knowledge. Experimental results challenge the assumption that English-based
approaches consistently outperform other languages and offer a novel insight
that aligning the model's internal thought with the knowledge required for the
task is critical for successful cross-lingual transfer. Furthermore, we show
that applying L2T during training can alleviate LLMs' reliance on the input
language and facilitate cross-linguistic knowledge integration without
translation-based learning. Code and datasets will be available.

Abstract: Large language models and vision-language models (which we jointly call LMs)
have transformed NLP and CV, demonstrating remarkable potential across various
fields. However, their capabilities in affective analysis (i.e. sentiment
analysis and emotion detection) remain underexplored. This gap is largely due
to the absence of comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, and the inherent
complexity of affective analysis tasks. In this paper, we introduce MMAFFBen,
the first extensive open-source benchmark for multilingual multimodal affective
analysis. MMAFFBen encompasses text, image, and video modalities across 35
languages, covering four key affective analysis tasks: sentiment polarity,
sentiment intensity, emotion classification, and emotion intensity. Moreover,
we construct the MMAFFIn dataset for fine-tuning LMs on affective analysis
tasks, and further develop MMAFFLM-3b and MMAFFLM-7b based on it. We evaluate
various representative LMs, including GPT-4o-mini, providing a systematic
comparison of their affective understanding capabilities. This project is

### [103] [Donate or Create? Comparing Data Collection Strategies for Emotion-labeled Multimodal Social Media Posts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24427)

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了研究中创建的内容与真实社交媒体帖子在情感表达上的差异，发现两者在长度、文本与图像的依赖程度及情感原型事件上有所不同，且参与者样本也存在人口统计学差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于了解研究中创建的内容与真实内容在情感表达上的差异及其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 收集了研究中创建的和真实的多模态社交媒体帖子，标注情感并比较多个维度，包括模型性能。

Result: 研究发现，研究中创建的帖子比真实帖子更长，更依赖文本而非图像表达情感，且更关注情感原型事件。参与者样本在人口统计学上也存在差异。

Conclusion: 研究中创建的数据对训练模型具有价值，但真实数据对评估模型效果更可靠。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of subjective phenomena such as emotion expression requires
data annotated with authors' intentions. Commonly such data is collected by
asking study participants to donate and label genuine content produced in the
real world, or create content fitting particular labels during the study.
Asking participants to create content is often simpler to implement and
presents fewer risks to participant privacy than data donation. However, it is
unclear if and how study-created content may differ from genuine content, and
how differences may impact models. We collect study-created and genuine
multimodal social media posts labeled for emotion and compare them on several
dimensions, including model performance. We find that compared to genuine
posts, study-created posts are longer, rely more on their text and less on
their images for emotion expression, and focus more on emotion-prototypical
events. The samples of participants willing to donate versus create posts are
demographically different. Study-created data is valuable to train models that
generalize well to genuine data, but realistic effectiveness estimates require
genuine data.

*Xu Wang,Zihao Li,Benyou Wang,Yan Hu,Difan Zou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SSPU的新框架，利用稀疏自编码器（SAE）特征指导模型参数空间的针对性更新，实现精确、可解释且鲁棒的遗忘学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）存储大量信息，但需要选择性遗忘时存在隐私和安全问题，现有方法缺乏可解释性或对抗性提示的鲁棒性。

Method: SSPU采用三阶段流程：数据驱动的层和特征选择、QR分解构建子空间、约束优化控制激活到“无关”子空间。

Result: 在WMDP-Cyber遗忘集和三个基准测试中，SSPU将有害知识准确率降低3.22%，并提升对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SSPU通过可解释的子空间优化实现了鲁棒且可控的模型行为，揭示了现有遗忘方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) store vast amounts of information, making them
powerful yet raising privacy and safety concerns when selective knowledge
removal is required. Existing unlearning strategies, ranging from
gradient-based fine-tuning and model editing to sparse autoencoder (SAE)
steering, either lack interpretability or fail to provide a robust defense
against adversarial prompts. We propose SAE-Guided Subspace Projection
Unlearning (SSPU), a novel framework that leverages SAE features to drive
targeted updates in the model's parameter space, enabling precise,
interpretable, and robust unlearning. SSPU's three-stage pipeline performs
data-driven layer and feature selection, subspace construction via QR
decomposition, and constrained optimization that controls activations into an
"irrelevant" subspace while preserving retained knowledge. Overall, we use SAE
features to construct a subspace that supervises unlearning, refining the loss
and adding a regularization term to guide interpretable parameter updates. In
experiments on the WMDP-Cyber forget set and three utility benchmarks (MMLU,
TruthfulQA, GSM8K), SSPU reduces harmful knowledge accuracy by 3.22% compared
to the strongest baseline. It also improves adversarial robustness, lowering
malicious accuracy under jailbreak prompts compared to baselines. Our findings
expose the limitations of prior unlearning methods and demonstrate how
interpretable subspace-guided optimization can achieve robust, controllable
model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人物角色在领域特定问答任务中的实际效果，以优化大型语言模型（LLMs）的用户交互。

Method: 引入两种人物角色（PBPs和OPBPs），并通过多领域科学任务进行实证评估。

Result: PBPs轻微提升准确性，OPBPs则可能降低性能，即使语义相关。

Conclusion: 人物角色的相关性不保证知识有效利用，未来可研究更精细的角色表示对LLMs推理和知识检索的影响。

Abstract: Recent studies on personas have improved the way Large Language Models (LLMs)
interact with users. However, the effect of personas on domain-specific
question-answering (QA) tasks remains a subject of debate. This study analyzes
whether personas enhance specialized QA performance by introducing two types of
persona: Profession-Based Personas (PBPs) (e.g., scientist), which directly
relate to domain expertise, and Occupational Personality-Based Personas (OPBPs)
(e.g., scientific person), which reflect cognitive tendencies rather than
explicit expertise. Through empirical evaluations across multiple scientific
domains, we demonstrate that while PBPs can slightly improve accuracy, OPBPs
often degrade performance, even when semantically related to the task. Our
findings suggest that persona relevance alone does not guarantee effective
knowledge utilization and that they may impose cognitive constraints that
hinder optimal knowledge application. Future research can explore how nuanced
distinctions in persona representations guide LLMs, potentially contributing to
reasoning and knowledge retrieval that more closely mirror human social
conceptualization.

Motivation: 解决多模态大模型在动态知识注入中的挑战，避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 提出EVOKE基准，评估多模态动态知识注入能力，并测试文本和图像增强的效果。

Result: 现有方法在动态知识注入上表现不佳，监督微调导致灾难性遗忘；文本增强有效，图像增强无效；持续学习方法（如Replay和MoELoRA）可缓解遗忘。

Conclusion: 当前知识注入方法在动态知识上存在局限，需进一步研究更高效稳定的方法。

Abstract: Large language/multimodal models (LLMs/LMMs) store extensive pre-trained
knowledge but struggle to maintain consistency with real-world updates, making
it difficult to avoid catastrophic forgetting while acquiring evolving
knowledge. Previous work focused on constructing textual knowledge datasets and
exploring knowledge injection in LLMs, lacking exploration of multimodal
evolving knowledge injection in LMMs. To address this, we propose the EVOKE
benchmark to evaluate LMMs' ability to inject multimodal evolving knowledge in
real-world scenarios. Meanwhile, a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal
evolving knowledge injection revealed two challenges: (1) Existing knowledge
injection methods perform terribly on evolving knowledge. (2) Supervised
fine-tuning causes catastrophic forgetting, particularly instruction following
ability is severely compromised. Additionally, we provide pathways and find
that: (1) Text knowledge augmentation during the training phase improves
performance, while image augmentation cannot achieve it. (2) Continual learning
methods, especially Replay and MoELoRA, effectively mitigate forgetting. Our
findings indicate that current knowledge injection methods have many
limitations on evolving knowledge, which motivates further research on more
efficient and stable knowledge injection methods.

quality induced solely through pre-training. Our experiments show that
pre-training on a small, specialized corpus can yield effective

Method: 构建CaMMT数据集（含5,800组图像及平行标题），评估五种视觉语言模型在纯文本和文本+图像设置下的表现。

Result: 视觉上下文普遍提升翻译质量，尤其在文化特定项、歧义消除和性别正确使用方面。

Conclusion: 发布CaMMT以支持多模态翻译系统的开发与评估，更好地适应文化细微差异和区域变化。

Abstract: Cultural content poses challenges for machine translation systems due to the
differences in conceptualizations between cultures, where language alone may
fail to convey sufficient context to capture region-specific meanings. In this
work, we investigate whether images can act as cultural context in multimodal
translation. We introduce CaMMT, a human-curated benchmark of over 5,800
triples of images along with parallel captions in English and regional
languages. Using this dataset, we evaluate five Vision Language Models (VLMs)
in text-only and text+image settings. Through automatic and human evaluations,
we find that visual context generally improves translation quality, especially
in handling Culturally-Specific Items (CSIs), disambiguation, and correct
gender usage. By releasing CaMMT, we aim to support broader efforts in building
and evaluating multimodal translation systems that are better aligned with
cultural nuance and regional variation.

Result: 模型性能显著提升，COMETkiwi和XCOMET分数分别达71.84和81.77。

Conclusion: VietMix和方法提升了翻译生态效度，为其他低资源混合语言翻译提供框架。

Abstract: Machine translation systems fail when processing code-mixed inputs for
low-resource languages. We address this challenge by curating VietMix, a
parallel corpus of naturally occurring code-mixed Vietnamese text paired with
expert English translations. Augmenting this resource, we developed a
complementary synthetic data generation pipeline. This pipeline incorporates
filtering mechanisms to ensure syntactic plausibility and pragmatic
appropriateness in code-mixing patterns. Experimental validation shows our
naturalistic and complementary synthetic data boost models' performance,
measured by translation quality estimation scores, of up to 71.84 on COMETkiwi
and 81.77 on XCOMET. Triangulating positive results with LLM-based assessments,
augmented models are favored over seed fine-tuned counterparts in approximately
49% of judgments (54-56% excluding ties). VietMix and our augmentation
methodology advance ecological validity in neural MT evaluations and establish
a framework for addressing code-mixed translation challenges across other
low-resource pairs.

Conclusion: 代码集成推理有效扩展模型能力并提升效率，改进的训练策略增强了工具增强RL的稳定性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate code-integrated reasoning, where models
generate code when necessary and integrate feedback by executing it through a
code interpreter. To acquire this capability, models must learn when and how to
use external code tools effectively, which is supported by tool-augmented
reinforcement learning (RL) through interactive learning. Despite its benefits,
tool-augmented RL can still suffer from potential instability in the learning
dynamics. In light of this challenge, we present a systematic approach to
improving the training effectiveness and stability of tool-augmented RL for
code-integrated reasoning. Specifically, we develop enhanced training
strategies that balance exploration and stability, progressively building
tool-use capabilities while improving reasoning performance. Through extensive
experiments on five mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks, our model
demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple competitive
baselines. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the mechanism and
effect of code-integrated reasoning, revealing several key insights, such as
the extension of model's capability boundaries and the simultaneous improvement
of reasoning efficiency through code integration. All data and code for

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs在数学和编程等需要系统2认知的领域表现优异，但在社交领域（需要结合系统1和系统2认知）的发展仍不足，因此需要探索新的方法。

Method: 提出了Temporal-aware Hierarchical Cognitive Reinforcement Learning (TimeHC-RL)，通过结合时间感知和分层认知强化学习，提升LLMs的社交智能。

Result: 实验表明，TimeHC-RL方法优于传统的System 2 RL方法，使7B模型性能媲美DeepSeek-R1和OpenAI-O3等先进模型。

Conclusion: TimeHC-RL方法有效提升了LLMs的社交智能，并为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in
IQ-related domains that require careful thinking, such as mathematics and
coding. However, enhancing LLMs' cognitive development in social domains,
particularly from a post-training perspective, remains underexplored.
Recognizing that the social world follows a distinct timeline and requires a
richer blend of cognitive modes (from intuitive reactions (System 1) and
surface-level thinking to deliberate thinking (System 2)) than mathematics,
which primarily relies on System 2 cognition (careful, step-by-step reasoning),
we introduce Temporal-aware Hierarchical Cognitive Reinforcement Learning
(TimeHC-RL) for enhancing LLMs' social intelligence. In our experiments, we
systematically explore improving LLMs' social intelligence and validate the
effectiveness of the TimeHC-RL method, through five other post-training
paradigms and two test-time intervention paradigms on eight datasets with
diverse data patterns. Experimental results reveal the superiority of our
proposed TimeHC-RL method compared to the widely adopted System 2 RL method. It
gives the 7B backbone model wings, enabling it to rival the performance of
advanced models like DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI-O3. Additionally, the systematic
exploration from post-training and test-time interventions perspectives to
improve LLMs' social intelligence has uncovered several valuable insights.

Motivation: 生成式AI和大型语言模型（LLMs）的进步导致合成内容高度逼真，引发了对恶意使用（如虚假信息）的担忧，而现有检测器在真实场景中的泛化能力不足。

Method: 使用直接偏好优化（DPO）微调语言模型，将MGT风格转向人类书写文本（HWT），挑战检测器对风格线索的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，检测器容易被少量样本欺骗，检测性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 需改进检测方法，增强其对未见领域文本的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) have
enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic content, raising concerns
about the potential for malicious use, such as misinformation and manipulation.
Moreover, detecting Machine-Generated Text (MGT) remains challenging due to the
lack of robust benchmarks that assess generalization to real-world scenarios.
In this work, we present a pipeline to test the resilience of state-of-the-art
MGT detectors (e.g., Mage, Radar, LLM-DetectAIve) to linguistically informed
adversarial attacks. To challenge the detectors, we fine-tune language models
using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to shift the MGT style toward
human-written text (HWT). This exploits the detectors' reliance on stylistic
clues, making new generations more challenging to detect. Additionally, we
analyze the linguistic shifts induced by the alignment and which features are
used by detectors to detect MGT texts. Our results show that detectors can be
easily fooled with relatively few examples, resulting in a significant drop in
detection performance. This highlights the importance of improving detection
methods and making them robust to unseen in-domain texts.

Method: 采用适配器混合方法结合跨注意力微调预训练机器翻译模型。

Result: 方法显著优于基线，但语言相关性对适配器性能影响不大，适配器的作用更多是参数正则化。

Conclusion: 神经语言处理涉及多种成功因素，适配器的作用可能与直觉不符，更多是正则化效果。

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer from related high-resource languages is a
well-established strategy to enhance low-resource language technologies. Prior
work has shown that adapters show promise for, e.g., improving low-resource
machine translation (MT). In this work, we investigate an adapter souping
method combined with cross-attention fine-tuning of a pre-trained MT model to
leverage language transfer for three low-resource Creole languages, which
exhibit relatedness to different language groups across distinct linguistic
dimensions. Our approach improves performance substantially over baselines.
However, we find that linguistic relatedness -- or even a lack thereof -- does
not covary meaningfully with adapter performance. Surprisingly, our
cross-attention fine-tuning approach appears equally effective with randomly
initialized adapters, implying that the benefit of adapters in this setting
lies in parameter regularization, and not in meaningful information transfer.
We provide analysis supporting this regularization hypothesis. Our findings
underscore the reality that neural language processing involves many success
factors, and that not all neural methods leverage linguistic knowledge in
intuitive ways.

Abstract: Cultural Heritage (CH) data hold invaluable knowledge, reflecting the
history, traditions, and identities of societies, and shaping our understanding
of the past and present. However, many CH collections contain outdated or
offensive descriptions that reflect historical biases. CH Institutions (CHIs)
face significant challenges in curating these data due to the vast scale and
complexity of the task. To address this, we develop an AI-powered tool that
detects offensive terms in CH metadata and provides contextual insights into
their historical background and contemporary perception. We leverage a
multilingual vocabulary co-created with marginalized communities, researchers,
and CH professionals, along with traditional NLP techniques and Large Language
Models (LLMs). Available as a standalone web app and integrated with major CH
platforms, the tool has processed over 7.9 million records, contextualizing the
contentious terms detected in their metadata. Rather than erasing these terms,
our approach seeks to inform, making biases visible and providing actionable
insights for creating more inclusive and accessible CH collections.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs内部信息表示的特点，为未来调整LLM输出中特定人类特征提供了参考。

Abstract: We present a study on how and where personas -- defined by distinct sets of
human characteristics, values, and beliefs -- are encoded in the representation
space of large language models (LLMs). Using a range of dimension reduction and
pattern recognition methods, we first identify the model layers that show the
greatest divergence in encoding these representations. We then analyze the
activations within a selected layer to examine how specific personas are
encoded relative to others, including their shared and distinct embedding
spaces. We find that, across multiple pre-trained decoder-only LLMs, the
analyzed personas show large differences in representation space only within
the final third of the decoder layers. We observe overlapping activations for
specific ethical perspectives -- such as moral nihilism and utilitarianism --
suggesting a degree of polysemy. In contrast, political ideologies like
conservatism and liberalism appear to be represented in more distinct regions.
These findings help to improve our understanding of how LLMs internally
represent information and can inform future efforts in refining the modulation
of specific human traits in LLM outputs. Warning: This paper includes
potentially offensive sample statements.

Result: Beagle在推理加速和训练效率上优于现有方法，性能与EAGLE-v2相当。

Conclusion: Beagle为推测解码提供了一种更简单高效的架构选择。

Abstract: Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely adopted approach for accelerating
inference in large language models (LLMs), particularly when the draft and
target models are well aligned. However, state-of-the-art SD methods typically
rely on tightly coupled, self-attention-based Transformer decoders, often
augmented with auxiliary pooling or fusion layers. This coupling makes them
increasingly complex and harder to generalize across different models. We
present Budget EAGLE (Beagle), the first, to our knowledge,
cross-attention-based Transformer decoder SD model that achieves performance on
par with leading self-attention SD models (EAGLE-v2) while eliminating the need
for pooling or auxiliary components, simplifying the architecture, improving
training efficiency, and maintaining stable memory usage during training-time
simulation. To enable effective training of this novel architecture, we propose
Two-Stage Block-Attention Training, a new method that achieves training
stability and convergence efficiency in block-level attention scenarios.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets show that Beagle
achieves competitive inference speedups and higher training efficiency than
EAGLE-v2, offering a strong alternative for architectures in speculative
decoding.

Motivation: 解决大型推理模型（LRMs）因长推理链导致效率下降的问题，避免现有方法压缩推理链时性能降低的缺陷。

Method: 将LRMs的推理过程建模为搜索树，结合A*算法和特定成本函数，高效压缩推理链并确定高信息密度、低成本的路径。

Result: 在多个数学任务中，A*-Thought显著提升性能（如QwQ-32B性能提升2.39倍），并减少输出令牌长度50%。

Conclusion: A*-Thought在保持性能的同时提升效率，具有广泛兼容性，适用于多种LRMs。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve superior performance by extending the
thought length. However, a lengthy thinking trajectory leads to reduced
efficiency. Most of the existing methods are stuck in the assumption of
overthinking and attempt to reason efficiently by compressing the
Chain-of-Thought, but this often leads to performance degradation. To address
this problem, we introduce A*-Thought, an efficient tree search-based unified
framework designed to identify and isolate the most essential thoughts from the
extensive reasoning chains produced by these models. It formulates the
reasoning process of LRMs as a search tree, where each node represents a
reasoning span in the giant reasoning space. By combining the A* search
algorithm with a cost function specific to the reasoning path, it can
efficiently compress the chain of thought and determine a reasoning path with
high information density and low cost. In addition, we also propose a
bidirectional importance estimation mechanism, which further refines this
search process and enhances its efficiency beyond uniform sampling. Extensive
experiments on several advanced math tasks show that A*-Thought effectively
balances performance and efficiency over a huge search space. Specifically,
A*-Thought can improve the performance of QwQ-32B by 2.39$\times$ with
low-budget and reduce the length of the output token by nearly 50% with
high-budget. The proposed method is also compatible with several other LRMs,
demonstrating its generalization capability. The code can be accessed at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理长篇叙事中的复杂角色关系，需要更高效的提取工具。

Method: CREFT通过知识蒸馏构建基础角色图，并迭代优化角色组成、关系提取、角色识别和分组分配。

Result: 在韩剧数据集上，CREFT在准确性和完整性上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CREFT通过系统可视化角色网络，提升叙事理解效率，适用于娱乐、出版和教育领域。

Abstract: Understanding complex character relations is crucial for narrative analysis
and efficient script evaluation, yet existing extraction methods often fail to
handle long-form narratives with nuanced interactions. To address this
challenge, we present CREFT, a novel sequential framework leveraging
specialized Large Language Model (LLM) agents. First, CREFT builds a base
character graph through knowledge distillation, then iteratively refines
character composition, relation extraction, role identification, and group
assignments. Experiments on a curated Korean drama dataset demonstrate that
CREFT significantly outperforms single-agent LLM baselines in both accuracy and
completeness. By systematically visualizing character networks, CREFT
streamlines narrative comprehension and accelerates script review -- offering
substantial benefits to the entertainment, publishing, and educational sectors.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Bench4KE，一个基于API的KE自动化基准测试系统，用于评估自动生成Competency Questions（CQs）的工具，填补了当前评估标准化的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM-based的KE自动化工具缺乏标准化评估，影响了方法严谨性和结果的可比性。

Method: 提出Bench4KE系统，提供黄金标准数据集和相似性度量套件，评估CQ生成工具的质量。

Result: 比较了四种基于LLM的CQ生成系统，为未来研究建立基线。

Conclusion: Bench4KE可扩展支持更多KE自动化任务，代码和数据公开，推动领域标准化。

Abstract: The availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a unique
opportunity to reinvigorate research on Knowledge Engineering (KE) automation,
a trend already evident in recent efforts developing LLM-based methods and
tools for the automatic generation of Competency Questions (CQs). However, the
evaluation of these tools lacks standardisation. This undermines the
methodological rigour and hinders the replication and comparison of results. To
address this gap, we introduce Bench4KE, an extensible API-based benchmarking
system for KE automation. Its first release focuses on evaluating tools that
generate CQs automatically. CQs are natural language questions used by ontology
engineers to define the functional requirements of an ontology. Bench4KE
provides a curated gold standard consisting of CQ datasets from four real-world
ontology projects. It uses a suite of similarity metrics to assess the quality
of the CQs generated. We present a comparative analysis of four recent CQ
generation systems, which are based on LLMs, establishing a baseline for future
research. Bench4KE is also designed to accommodate additional KE automation
tasks, such as SPARQL query generation, ontology testing and drafting. Code and
datasets are publicly available under the Apache 2.0 license.

*Ioannis Tsiamas,David Dale,Marta R. Costa-jussà*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于字符的方法，通过跨语言和跨模态知识转移，提升低资源语言的翻译能力，并在文本和语音翻译中取得显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前翻译系统仅覆盖5%的语言，需扩展至低资源语言，因此需要高效的数据方法。

Method: 采用字符级编码器，结合SONAR多语言嵌入空间和教师-学生方法，利用ASR数据训练轻量适配器。

Result: 在75种语言的文本翻译中表现优于传统子词模型，语音翻译在33种语言上达到SOTA。

Conclusion: 字符级方法在低资源语言和跨模态任务中具有优势，展现了零样本泛化能力。

Abstract: Current translation systems, despite being highly multilingual, cover only 5%
of the world's languages. Expanding language coverage to the long-tail of
low-resource languages requires data-efficient methods that rely on
cross-lingual and cross-modal knowledge transfer. To this end, we propose a
character-based approach to improve adaptability to new languages and
modalities. Our method leverages SONAR, a multilingual fixed-size embedding
space with different modules for encoding and decoding. We use a
teacher-student approach with parallel translation data to obtain a
character-level encoder. Then, using ASR data, we train a lightweight adapter
to connect a massively multilingual CTC ASR model (MMS), to the character-level
encoder, potentially enabling speech translation from 1,000+ languages.
Experimental results in text translation for 75 languages on FLORES+
demonstrate that our character-based approach can achieve better language
transfer than traditional subword-based models, especially outperforming them
in low-resource settings, and demonstrating better zero-shot generalizability
to unseen languages. Our speech adaptation, maximizing knowledge transfer from
the text modality, achieves state-of-the-art results in speech-to-text
translation on the FLEURS benchmark on 33 languages, surpassing previous
supervised and cascade models, albeit being a zero-shot model with minimal
supervision from ASR data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在长叙事文本（如书籍、电影、电视剧本）的摘要任务中表现不佳，难以捕捉复杂情节和主题连贯性。

Method: 采用对话转描述预处理方法和分层多LLM摘要管道，无需微调即可处理长文本。

Result: 在书籍、电影和电视剧本上，BERTScore（F1）提升高达30.0%，达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: 多代理LLM框架在长叙事摘要任务中表现优异，为结构化摘要提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Summarizing long-form narratives--such as books, movies, and TV
scripts--requires capturing intricate plotlines, character interactions, and
thematic coherence, a task that remains challenging for existing LLMs. We
introduce NexusSum, a multi-agent LLM framework for narrative summarization
that processes long-form text through a structured, sequential
pipeline--without requiring fine-tuning. Our approach introduces two key
innovations: (1) Dialogue-to-Description Transformation: A narrative-specific
preprocessing method that standardizes character dialogue and descriptive text
into a unified format, improving coherence. (2) Hierarchical Multi-LLM
Summarization: A structured summarization pipeline that optimizes chunk
processing and controls output length for accurate, high-quality summaries. Our
method establishes a new state-of-the-art in narrative summarization, achieving
up to a 30.0% improvement in BERTScore (F1) across books, movies, and TV
scripts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-agent LLMs in
handling long-form content, offering a scalable approach for structured
summarization in diverse storytelling domains.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GATE模型，用于阿拉伯语语义文本相似性任务，通过Matryoshka表示学习和混合损失训练方法，在MTEB基准测试中表现优异，性能提升20-25%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿拉伯语在语义文本相似性任务中缺乏高质量数据集和预训练模型，限制了其发展。

Method: 采用Matryoshka表示学习和混合损失训练方法，结合阿拉伯语三元组数据集进行训练。

Result: GATE模型在STS基准测试中表现优于其他模型，性能提升20-25%。

Conclusion: GATE模型能有效捕捉阿拉伯语的语义细微差别，为阿拉伯语NLP任务提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Semantic textual similarity (STS) is a critical task in natural language
processing (NLP), enabling applications in retrieval, clustering, and
understanding semantic relationships between texts. However, research in this
area for the Arabic language remains limited due to the lack of high-quality
datasets and pre-trained models. This scarcity of resources has restricted the
accurate evaluation and advance of semantic similarity in Arabic text. This
paper introduces General Arabic Text Embedding (GATE) models that achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the Semantic Textual Similarity task within the
MTEB benchmark. GATE leverages Matryoshka Representation Learning and a hybrid
loss training approach with Arabic triplet datasets for Natural Language
Inference, which are essential for enhancing model performance in tasks that
demand fine-grained semantic understanding. GATE outperforms larger models,
including OpenAI, with a 20-25% performance improvement on STS benchmarks,
effectively capturing the unique semantic nuances of Arabic.

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨层归因算法，分析稀疏MoE架构的动态路由-专家交互，揭示了MoE模型的效率模式和任务分工框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归因方法无法捕捉稀疏MoE架构的动态交互，需解决MoE模型的可解释性问题。

Method: 提出跨层归因算法，对比稀疏MoE（如Qwen 1.5-MoE）与密集模型（如Llama-7B）的表现。

Result: MoE模型通过“早期筛选-后期协作”模式实现37%的层效率提升，并揭示了任务分工和语义驱动路由。

Conclusion: 研究为MoE设计提供了效率、专业化和鲁棒性的平衡原则，推动了模型可解释性。

Abstract: The interpretability of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, especially those
with heterogeneous designs, remains underexplored. Existing attribution methods
for dense models fail to capture dynamic routing-expert interactions in sparse
MoE architectures. To address this issue, we propose a cross-level attribution
algorithm to analyze sparse MoE architectures (Qwen 1.5-MoE, OLMoE,
Mixtral-8x7B) against dense models (Qwen 1.5-7B, Llama-7B, Mixtral-7B). Results
show MoE models achieve 37% higher per-layer efficiency via a "mid-activation,
late-amplification" pattern: early layers screen experts, while late layers
refine knowledge collaboratively. Ablation studies reveal a "basic-refinement"
framework--shared experts handle general tasks (entity recognition), while
routed experts specialize in domain-specific processing (geographic
attributes). Semantic-driven routing is evidenced by strong correlations
between attention heads and experts (r=0.68), enabling task-aware coordination.
Notably, architectural depth dictates robustness: deep Qwen 1.5-MoE mitigates
expert failures (e.g., 43% MRR drop in geographic tasks when blocking top-10
experts) through shared expert redundancy, whereas shallow OLMoE suffers severe
degradation (76% drop). Task sensitivity further guides design: core-sensitive
tasks (geography) require concentrated expertise, while distributed-tolerant
tasks (object attributes) leverage broader participation. These insights
advance MoE interpretability, offering principles to balance efficiency,
specialization, and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抑郁症检测模型缺乏对预测结果的可解释性，影响了系统的可信度。

Method: 使用掩蔽硬实例挖掘（MHIM）方法，通过掩蔽注意力权重迫使模型关注更广泛的显著特征。

Result: MHIM在泰语和英语数据集上显著提升了预测准确性和可解释性指标。

Conclusion: MHIM是一种有效提升抑郁症检测模型可解释性和性能的方法。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical need for improved explainability in
text-based depression detection. While offering predictive outcomes, current
solutions often overlook the understanding of model predictions which can
hinder trust in the system. We propose the use of Masked Hard Instance Mining
(MHIM) to enhance the explainability in the depression detection task. MHIM
strategically masks attention weights within the model, compelling it to
distribute attention across a wider range of salient features. We evaluate MHIM
on two datasets representing distinct languages: Thai (Thai-Maywe) and English
(DAIC-WOZ). Our results demonstrate that MHIM significantly improves
performance in terms of both prediction accuracy and explainability metrics.

TL;DR: 研究了对话代理如何结合自身和对话者的人物信息生成更一致的对话，并评估了模型在不同情境下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索对话代理在结合对话者人物信息时的表现，填补现有研究中对对话者人物信息适应性的空白。

Method: 通过系统性地掩盖或公开对话者信息，评估其对对话生成的影响，并采用LLM和人类评估。

Result: 公开对话者人物信息提高了目标说话者的识别率，模型在陌生对话者面前表现较差，零样本设置下LLM倾向于复制传记细节。

Conclusion: 对话者人物信息对对话生成有显著影响，但模型在陌生情境下仍需改进。

Abstract: Endowing dialogue agents with persona information has proven to significantly
improve the consistency and diversity of their generations. While much focus
has been placed on aligning dialogues with provided personas, the adaptation to
the interlocutor's profile remains largely underexplored. In this work, we
investigate three key aspects: (1) a model's ability to align responses with
both the provided persona and the interlocutor's; (2) its robustness when
dealing with familiar versus unfamiliar interlocutors and topics, and (3) the
impact of additional fine-tuning on specific persona-based dialogues. We
evaluate dialogues generated with diverse speaker pairings and topics, framing
the evaluation as an author identification task and employing both
LLM-as-a-judge and human evaluations. By systematically masking or disclosing
information about the interlocutor, we assess its impact on dialogue
generation. Results show that access to the interlocutor's persona improves the
recognition of the target speaker, while masking it does the opposite. Although
models generalise well across topics, they struggle with unfamiliar
interlocutors. Finally, we found that in zero-shot settings, LLMs often copy
biographical details, facilitating identification but trivialising the task.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在新提出的基准数据集上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 结合LLMs和轻量级检索器的方法能有效提升科学新颖性检测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: In an era of exponential scientific growth, identifying novel research ideas
is crucial and challenging in academia. Despite potential, the lack of an
appropriate benchmark dataset hinders the research of novelty detection. More
importantly, simply adopting existing NLP technologies, e.g., retrieving and
then cross-checking, is not a one-size-fits-all solution due to the gap between
textual similarity and idea conception. In this paper, we propose to harness
large language models (LLMs) for scientific novelty detection (ND), associated
with two new datasets in marketing and NLP domains. To construct the
considerate datasets for ND, we propose to extract closure sets of papers based
on their relationship, and then summarize their main ideas based on LLMs. To
capture idea conception, we propose to train a lightweight retriever by
distilling the idea-level knowledge from LLMs to align ideas with similar
conception, enabling efficient and accurate idea retrieval for LLM novelty
detection. Experiments show our method consistently outperforms others on the
proposed benchmark datasets for idea retrieval and ND tasks. Codes and data are

Result: POLLUX包含2100个专业编写的提示，覆盖多种生成领域，并提供可扩展的评估工具。

Conclusion: POLLUX为模型开发提供了高效、可解释的评估方法，替代了传统的人工判断。

Abstract: We introduce POLLUX, a comprehensive open-source benchmark designed to
evaluate the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
Russian. Our main contribution is a novel evaluation methodology that enhances
the interpretability of LLM assessment. For each task type, we define a set of
detailed criteria and develop a scoring protocol where models evaluate
responses and provide justifications for their ratings. This enables
transparent, criteria-driven evaluation beyond traditional resource-consuming,
side-by-side human comparisons. POLLUX includes a detailed, fine-grained
taxonomy of 35 task types covering diverse generative domains such as code
generation, creative writing, and practical assistant use cases, totaling 2,100
manually crafted and professionally authored prompts. Each task is categorized
by difficulty (easy/medium/hard), with experts constructing the dataset
entirely from scratch. We also release a family of LLM-as-a-Judge (7B and 32B)
evaluators trained for nuanced assessment of generative outputs. This approach
provides scalable, interpretable evaluation and annotation tools for model
development, effectively replacing costly and less precise human judgments.

Motivation: 心力衰竭患者表型多样，影响治疗和预后，需开发高性能且可解释的分类模型。

Method: 使用2015-2023年33,105次住院数据，结合结构化与非结构化数据，训练BERT和Aug-Linear模型，并与基线模型比较。通过临床医生标注评估模型可解释性。

Result: BERT和Aug-Linear模型表现最优（AUC=0.84和0.81），Aug-Linear的解释更接近临床医生判断。

Conclusion: 出院小结是HF表型分类的最佳数据源，Aug-Linear模型兼具高性能与可解释性，适合临床决策。

Abstract: Objective: Heart failure (HF) patients present with diverse phenotypes
affecting treatment and prognosis. This study evaluates models for phenotyping
HF patients based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) classes, using
structured and unstructured data, assessing performance and interpretability.
  Materials and Methods: The study analyzes all HF hospitalizations at both
Amsterdam UMC hospitals (AMC and VUmc) from 2015 to 2023 (33,105
hospitalizations, 16,334 patients). Data from AMC were used for model training,
and from VUmc for external validation. The dataset was unlabelled and included
tabular clinical measurements and discharge letters. Silver labels for LVEF
classes were generated by combining diagnosis codes, echocardiography results,
and textual mentions. Gold labels were manually annotated for 300 patients for
testing. Multiple Transformer-based (black-box) and Aug-Linear (white-box)
models were trained and compared with baselines on structured and unstructured
data. To evaluate interpretability, two clinicians annotated 20 discharge
letters by highlighting information they considered relevant for LVEF
classification. These were compared to SHAP and LIME explanations from
black-box models and the inherent explanations of Aug-Linear models.
  Results: BERT-based and Aug-Linear models, using discharge letters alone,
achieved the highest classification results (AUC=0.84 for BERT, 0.81 for
Aug-Linear on external validation), outperforming baselines. Aug-Linear
explanations aligned more closely with clinicians' explanations than post-hoc
explanations on black-box models.
  Conclusions: Discharge letters emerged as the most informative source for
phenotyping HF patients. Aug-Linear models matched black-box performance while
providing clinician-aligned interpretability, supporting their use in
transparent clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural
language understanding and generation, leading to extensive benchmarking across
diverse tasks. However, cryptanalysis a critical area for data security and
encryption has not yet been thoroughly explored in LLM evaluations. To address
this gap, we evaluate cryptanalytic potential of state of the art LLMs on
encrypted texts generated using a range of cryptographic algorithms. We
introduce a novel benchmark dataset comprising diverse plain texts spanning
various domains, lengths, writing styles, and topics paired with their
encrypted versions. Using zero-shot and few shot settings, we assess multiple
LLMs for decryption accuracy and semantic comprehension across different
encryption schemes. Our findings reveal key insights into the strengths and
limitations of LLMs in side-channel communication while raising concerns about
their susceptibility to jailbreaking attacks. This research highlights the
dual-use nature of LLMs in security contexts and contributes to the ongoing
discussion on AI safety and security.

Result: 实验证明FSPO有效减少幻觉，提升推理准确性和可靠性。

Conclusion: FSPO是一种创新方法，能显著改善LLM在RL微调中的表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced in reasoning tasks
through reinforcement learning (RL) optimization, achieving impressive
capabilities across various challenging benchmarks. However, our empirical
analysis reveals a critical drawback: reasoning-oriented RL fine-tuning
significantly increases the prevalence of hallucinations. We theoretically
analyze the RL training dynamics, identifying high-variance gradient,
entropy-induced randomness, and susceptibility to spurious local optima as key
factors leading to hallucinations. To address this drawback, we propose
Factuality-aware Step-wise Policy Optimization (FSPO), an innovative RL
fine-tuning algorithm incorporating explicit factuality verification at each
reasoning step. FSPO leverages automated verification against given evidence to
dynamically adjust token-level advantage values, incentivizing factual
correctness throughout the reasoning process. Experiments across mathematical
reasoning and hallucination benchmarks using Qwen2.5 and Llama models
demonstrate that FSPO effectively reduces hallucinations while enhancing
reasoning accuracy, substantially improving both reliability and performance.

Result: 发现模型在文化与语言对齐时表现更好，特定神经元激活比例可作为多语言性能的潜在指标。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了LLMs在跨语言中表现一致的观念，强调了文化和语言评估的必要性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a Dual Evaluation Framework to comprehensively assess
the multilingual capabilities of LLMs. By decomposing the evaluation along the
dimensions of linguistic medium and cultural context, this framework enables a
nuanced analysis of LLMs' ability to process questions within both native and
cross-cultural contexts cross-lingually. Extensive evaluations are conducted on
a wide range of models, revealing a notable "CulturalLinguistic Synergy"
phenomenon, where models exhibit better performance when questions are
culturally aligned with the language. This phenomenon is further explored
through interpretability probing, which shows that a higher proportion of
specific neurons are activated in a language's cultural context. This
activation proportion could serve as a potential indicator for evaluating
multilingual performance during model training. Our findings challenge the
prevailing notion that LLMs, primarily trained on English data, perform
uniformly across languages and highlight the necessity of culturally and
linguistically model evaluations. Our code can be found at

Abstract: Labor market analysis relies on extracting insights from job advertisements,
which provide valuable yet unstructured information on job titles and

attention that is well-suited for the extreme multi-label classification task
of skill classification. \textbf{ConTeXT-match} significantly improves skill
extraction efficiency and performance, achieving state-of-the-art results with
a lightweight bi-encoder model. To support robust evaluation, we introduce
\textbf{Skill-XL}, a new benchmark with exhaustive, sentence-level skill
annotations that explicitly address the redundancy in the large label space.
Finally, we present \textbf{JobBERT V2}, an improved job title normalization
model that leverages extracted skills to produce high-quality job title
representations. Experiments demonstrate that our models are efficient,
accurate, and scalable, making them ideal for large-scale, real-time labor
market analysis.

*Juan Wisznia,Cecilia Bolaños,Juan Tollo,Giovanni Marraffini,Agustín Gianolini,Noe Hsueh,Luciano Del Corro*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，用于分析排序算法在成对排名提示（PRP）中的表现，将成本模型从传统成对比较转向LLM推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于比较次数的效率指标在LLM推理成本高的情况下失效，需要重新评估算法效率。

Method: 通过将成本模型围绕LLM推理重新设计，提出批处理和缓存等策略以降低推理成本。

Result: 研究发现，传统最优算法在LLM推理主导成本时可能效率下降。

Conclusion: 新框架强调优化LLM推理成本，为排序算法在PRP中的效率提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for analyzing sorting algorithms in pairwise
ranking prompting (PRP), re-centering the cost model around LLM inferences
rather than traditional pairwise comparisons. While classical metrics based on
comparison counts have traditionally been used to gauge efficiency, our
analysis reveals that expensive LLM inferences overturn these predictions;
accordingly, our framework encourages strategies such as batching and caching
to mitigate inference costs. We show that algorithms optimal in the classical
setting can lose efficiency when LLM inferences dominate the cost under certain
optimizations.

*Yiqun Sun,Qiang Huang,Anthony K. H. Tung,Jun Yu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PRISM是一个新框架，旨在生成可解释的政治偏见嵌入，通过挖掘争议性话题和跨编码器嵌入，提升政治偏见分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本嵌入模型在捕捉意识形态细微差别方面表现不足，限制了其在政治偏见理解任务中的有效性。

Method: PRISM分两阶段：1) 挖掘争议性话题及其偏见指标；2) 基于这些指标为新闻文章分配结构化偏见分数。

Result: PRISM在政治偏见分类任务中优于现有模型，并提供高度可解释的表示。

Conclusion: PRISM通过显式关联偏见揭示维度，增强了嵌入的预测能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Semantic Text Embedding is a fundamental NLP task that encodes textual
content into vector representations, where proximity in the embedding space
reflects semantic similarity. While existing embedding models excel at
capturing general meaning, they often overlook ideological nuances, limiting
their effectiveness in tasks that require an understanding of political bias.
To address this gap, we introduce PRISM, the first framework designed to
Produce inteRpretable polItical biaS eMbeddings. PRISM operates in two key
stages: (1) Controversial Topic Bias Indicator Mining, which systematically
extracts fine-grained political topics and their corresponding bias indicators
from weakly labeled news data, and (2) Cross-Encoder Political Bias Embedding,
which assigns structured bias scores to news articles based on their alignment
with these indicators. This approach ensures that embeddings are explicitly
tied to bias-revealing dimensions, enhancing both interpretability and
predictive power. Through extensive experiments on two large-scale datasets, we
demonstrate that PRISM outperforms state-of-the-art text embedding models in
political bias classification while offering highly interpretable
representations that facilitate diversified retrieval and ideological analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多阶段域适应框架（MSDA），结合自监督与半监督技术，显著提升了自动语音识别（ASR）模型的适应性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如希腊语）和弱监督场景下ASR模型的适应性问题。

Method: 采用两阶段域适应方法（MSDA），结合自监督学习和半监督技术。

Result: 实验表明，MSDA在ASR任务中表现优异，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSDA为无监督域适应提供了更鲁棒的解决方案，验证了自监督与自训练级联方法的必要性。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Meta PL unsupervised domain adaptation
framework for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We introduce a Multi-Stage
Domain Adaptation pipeline (MSDA), a sample-efficient, two-stage adaptation
approach that integrates self-supervised learning with semi-supervised
techniques. MSDA is designed to enhance the robustness and generalization of
ASR models, making them more adaptable to diverse conditions. It is
particularly effective for low-resource languages like Greek and in weakly
supervised scenarios where labeled data is scarce or noisy. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that Meta PL can be applied effectively to ASR
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods, and providing more robust solutions for unsupervised
domain adaptation in ASR. Our ablations highlight the necessity of utilizing a
cascading approach when combining self-supervision with self-training.

*Dayeon Ki,Rachel Rudinger,Tianyi Zhou,Marine Carpuat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种多智能体辩论框架，通过两个LLM代理的辩论提升文化适应性，实验表明该方法能提高准确性和文化群体公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM需要适应多样文化背景以服务全球社区，现有方法多为单LLM单轮交互，无法充分利用多LLM的互补优势。

Method: 引入多智能体辩论框架，两种变体：纯辩论和动态选择自省与辩论。在75国社交礼仪基准上评估7个LLM及21种组合。

Result: 辩论显著提升整体准确性和文化群体公平性，小模型（7-9B）通过辩论可媲美大模型（27B）表现。

Conclusion: 多智能体辩论是提升LLM文化适应性的有效方法，尤其对小模型效果显著。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) need to adapt their predictions to diverse
cultural contexts to benefit diverse communities across the world. While
previous efforts have focused on single-LLM, single-turn approaches, we propose
to exploit the complementary strengths of multiple LLMs to promote cultural
adaptability. We introduce a Multi-Agent Debate framework, where two LLM-based
agents debate over a cultural scenario and collaboratively reach a final
decision. We propose two variants: one where either LLM agents exclusively
debate and another where they dynamically choose between self-reflection and
debate during their turns. We evaluate these approaches on 7 open-weight LLMs
(and 21 LLM combinations) using the NormAd-ETI benchmark for social etiquette
norms in 75 countries. Experiments show that debate improves both overall
accuracy and cultural group parity over single-LLM baselines. Notably,
multi-agent debate enables relatively small LLMs (7-9B) to achieve accuracies
comparable to that of a much larger model (27B parameters).

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出TRIDENT框架，通过分析词汇多样性、恶意意图和越狱策略三个维度，评估对齐数据集的风险覆盖范围，并生成两个数据集。实验显示，基于TRIDENT-Edge微调的模型在安全性能上有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐数据集在风险覆盖上存在不足，主要关注词汇多样性而忽略其他关键维度，导致LLMs仍易生成有害内容或被滥用。

Method: 提出TRIDENT框架，通过零样本LLM生成多样化的有害指令及对齐响应，构建TRIDENT-Core和TRIDENT-Edge数据集。

Result: 微调后的模型在Harm Score上平均降低14.29%，Attack Success Rate降低20%，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: TRIDENT框架能有效提升对齐数据集的风险覆盖范围，显著增强LLMs的安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various natural language processing
tasks but remain vulnerable to generating harmful content or being exploited
for malicious purposes. Although safety alignment datasets have been introduced
to mitigate such risks through supervised fine-tuning (SFT), these datasets
often lack comprehensive risk coverage. Most existing datasets focus primarily
on lexical diversity while neglecting other critical dimensions. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel analysis framework to systematically
measure the risk coverage of alignment datasets across three essential
dimensions: Lexical Diversity, Malicious Intent, and Jailbreak Tactics. We
further introduce TRIDENT, an automated pipeline that leverages persona-based,
zero-shot LLM generation to produce diverse and comprehensive instructions
spanning these dimensions. Each harmful instruction is paired with an ethically
aligned response, resulting in two datasets: TRIDENT-Core, comprising 26,311
examples, and TRIDENT-Edge, with 18,773 examples. Fine-tuning Llama 3.1-8B on
TRIDENT-Edge demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving an average 14.29%
reduction in Harm Score, and a 20% decrease in Attack Success Rate compared to
the best-performing baseline model fine-tuned on the WildBreak dataset.

TL;DR: 论文提出LinearPatch方法，通过Hadamard变换和通道缩放解决层剪枝后激活值不匹配问题，显著提升剪枝后模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有层剪枝方法因激活值不匹配导致性能显著下降，需一种简单有效的方法修复。

Method: 采用Hadamard变换抑制异常值，通道缩放对齐激活值，融合为单一矩阵作为补丁。

Result: 在LLaMA-3-8B上剪枝5层后，性能保留94.15%，优于现有方法4%。通过知识蒸馏可进一步提升至95.16%。

Conclusion: LinearPatch是一种高效、低开销的层剪枝修复方法，显著提升剪枝后模型性能。

Abstract: Layer pruning has become a popular technique for compressing large language
models (LLMs) due to its simplicity. However, existing layer pruning methods
often suffer from significant performance drops. We identify that this
degradation stems from the mismatch of activation magnitudes across layers and
tokens at the pruning interface. To address this, we propose LinearPatch, a
simple plug-and-play technique to revive the layer-pruned LLMs. The proposed
method adopts Hadamard transformation to suppress massive outliers in
particular tokens, and channel-wise scaling to align the activation magnitudes.
These operations can be fused into a single matrix, which functions as a patch
to bridge the pruning interface with negligible inference overhead. LinearPatch
retains up to 94.15% performance of the original model when pruning 5 layers of
LLaMA-3-8B on the question answering benchmark, surpassing existing
state-of-the-art methods by 4%. In addition, the patch matrix can be further
optimized with memory efficient offline knowledge distillation. With only 5K
samples, the retained performance of LinearPatch can be further boosted to
95.16% within 30 minutes on a single computing card.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究比较了四种AI翻译质量反馈机制，发现除错误高亮外，其他反馈类型均显著提升用户决策准确性和依赖度，其中隐式反馈（尤其是QA表格）效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的广泛应用，用户需要反馈机制以负责任地使用AI，尤其是在用户无法评估AI预测质量的场景中。

Method: 在机器翻译场景中，比较了四种质量反馈机制：显式反馈（错误高亮和LLM解释）与隐式反馈（回译和QA表格）。

Result: 除错误高亮外，其他反馈类型均显著提升决策准确性和依赖度；隐式反馈（尤其是QA表格）在准确性、依赖度和用户体验上表现最佳。

Conclusion: 隐式反馈（如QA表格）在提升用户决策质量和体验方面优于显式反馈，值得在实际应用中推广。

Abstract: As people increasingly use AI systems in work and daily life, feedback
mechanisms that help them use AI responsibly are urgently needed, particularly
in settings where users are not equipped to assess the quality of AI
predictions. We study a realistic Machine Translation (MT) scenario where
monolingual users decide whether to share an MT output, first without and then
with quality feedback. We compare four types of quality feedback: explicit
feedback that directly give users an assessment of translation quality using 1)
error highlights and 2) LLM explanations, and implicit feedback that helps
users compare MT inputs and outputs through 3) backtranslation and 4)
question-answer (QA) tables. We find that all feedback types, except error
highlights, significantly improve both decision accuracy and appropriate
reliance. Notably, implicit feedback, especially QA tables, yields
significantly greater gains than explicit feedback in terms of decision
accuracy, appropriate reliance, and user perceptions, receiving the highest
ratings for helpfulness and trust, and the lowest for mental burden.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在复杂推理任务中表现不佳，主要由于搜索效率低和多样性不足。

Method: 提出Soft Reasoning框架，结合嵌入扰动和贝叶斯优化，通过验证器引导的目标函数平衡探索与利用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了推理准确性，且计算成本低，具有可扩展性和模型无关性。

Conclusion: Soft Reasoning为LLMs的复杂推理提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with complex reasoning due to limited
diversity and inefficient search. We propose Soft Reasoning, an embedding-based
search framework that optimises the embedding of the first token to guide
generation. It combines (1) embedding perturbation for controlled exploration
and (2) Bayesian optimisation to refine embeddings via a verifier-guided
objective, balancing exploration and exploitation. This approach improves
reasoning accuracy and coherence while avoiding reliance on heuristic search.
Experiments demonstrate superior correctness with minimal computation, making
it a scalable, model-agnostic solution.

TL;DR: SCRIPT-BPE是一种新的编码方案，通过基于Unicode脚本和类别属性的初始标记，避免了UTF-8字节转换问题，提供了一种简单且鲁棒的预标记化策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决BPE分词器在多语言环境中的问题，如非西方脚本的惩罚和部分UTF-8序列标记的生成，以及正则表达式预标记化的脆弱性。

Method: 提出SCRIPT方案，使用Unicode脚本和类别属性进行初始标记化，并引入约束BPE合并策略以确保字符完整性。

Result: SCRIPT-BPE在保持竞争力的压缩率的同时，消除了非拉丁脚本语言的编码惩罚。

Conclusion: SCRIPT-BPE为多语言分词提供了一种更鲁棒和公平的解决方案。

Abstract: Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizers, widely used in Large Language Models,
face challenges in multilingual settings, including penalization of non-Western
scripts and the creation of tokens with partial UTF-8 sequences.
Pretokenization, often reliant on complex regular expressions, can also
introduce fragility and unexpected edge cases. We propose SCRIPT (Script
Category Representation in PreTokenization), a novel encoding scheme that
bypasses UTF-8 byte conversion by using initial tokens based on Unicode script
and category properties. This approach enables a simple, rule-based
pretokenization strategy that respects script boundaries, offering a robust
alternative to pretokenization strategies based on regular expressions. We also
introduce and validate a constrained BPE merging strategy that enforces
character integrity, applicable to both SCRIPT-BPE and byte-based BPE. Our
experiments demonstrate that SCRIPT-BPE achieves competitive compression while
eliminating encoding-based penalties for non-Latin-script languages.

Motivation: 解决低资源和零资源语言在语音到文本翻译中的挑战，通过音素识别增强跨语言迁移能力。

Method: 基于多语言大语言模型，引入音素识别作为中间步骤，采用课程学习策略逐步训练。

Result: 在低资源条件下提升翻译质量，实现零资源翻译，但对高资源性能略有影响。

Conclusion: 音素增强的思维链框架为语音到文本翻译在多语言场景中的普及提供了可行方向。

Abstract: We propose a Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) approach that integrates
phoneme representations into a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework to improve
translation in low-resource and zero-resource settings. By introducing phoneme
recognition as an intermediate step, we enhance cross-lingual transfer,
enabling translation even for languages with no labeled speech data. Our system
builds on a multilingual LLM, which we extend to process speech and phonemes.
Training follows a curriculum learning strategy that progressively introduces
more complex tasks. Experiments on multilingual S2TT benchmarks show that
phoneme-augmented CoT improves translation quality in low-resource conditions
and enables zero-resource translation, while slightly impacting high-resource
performance. Despite this trade-off, our findings demonstrate that
phoneme-based CoT is a promising step toward making S2TT more accessible across
diverse languages.

Method: 使用GPT-4o生成合成数据，并评估三种先进LLM（Gemini 1.5 Pro、Claude 3.5 Sonnet和DeepSeek-R1）在主题和情感分类任务上的表现。

Result: 合成数据有效，不同模型表现各异：DeepSeek-R1精度高，Gemini 1.5 Pro和Claude 3.5 Sonnet召回率高，Gemini 1.5 Pro推理速度快。

Conclusion: LLM生成的合成数据是创建ABSA资源的可行方法，可减少对有限真实标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) offers granular insights into opinions
but often suffers from the scarcity of diverse, labeled datasets that reflect
real-world conversational nuances. This paper presents an approach for
generating synthetic ABSA data using Large Language Models (LLMs) to address
this gap. We detail the generation process aimed at producing data with
consistent topic and sentiment distributions across multiple domains using
GPT-4o. The quality and utility of the generated data were evaluated by
assessing the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini 1.5 Pro,
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and DeepSeek-R1) on topic and sentiment classification
tasks. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the synthetic data,
revealing distinct performance trade-offs among the models: DeepSeekR1 showed
higher precision, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Claude 3.5 Sonnet exhibited strong recall,
and Gemini 1.5 Pro offered significantly faster inference. We conclude that
LLM-based synthetic data generation is a viable and flexible method for
creating valuable ABSA resources, facilitating research and model evaluation
without reliance on limited or inaccessible real-world labeled data.

Motivation: 现有评估大型语言模型偏见的资源缺乏受影响社区的参与，HESEIA旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过专业发展课程，370名高中教师和5,370名学生合作创建了46,499个句子，捕捉多维度偏见。

Result: HESEIA比现有数据集更能揭示未被当前模型识别的刻板印象，且覆盖更多人口统计维度和学科领域。

Conclusion: HESEIA为基于教育社区的偏见评估提供了新工具，强调了参与式方法的重要性。

Abstract: Most resources for evaluating social biases in Large Language Models are
developed without co-design from the communities affected by these biases, and
rarely involve participatory approaches. We introduce HESEIA, a dataset of
46,499 sentences created in a professional development course. The course
involved 370 high-school teachers and 5,370 students from 189 Latin-American
schools. Unlike existing benchmarks, HESEIA captures intersectional biases
across multiple demographic axes and school subjects. It reflects local
contexts through the lived experience and pedagogical expertise of educators.
Teachers used minimal pairs to create sentences that express stereotypes
relevant to their school subjects and communities. We show the dataset
diversity in term of demographic axes represented and also in terms of the
knowledge areas included. We demonstrate that the dataset contains more
stereotypes unrecognized by current LLMs than previous datasets. HESEIA is
available to support bias assessments grounded in educational communities.

Abstract: Arabic dialect identification (ADI) systems are essential for large-scale
data collection pipelines that enable the development of inclusive speech
technologies for Arabic language varieties. However, the reliability of current
ADI systems is limited by poor generalization to out-of-domain speech. In this
paper, we present an effective approach based on voice conversion for training
ADI models that achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly
improves robustness in cross-domain scenarios. Evaluated on a newly collected
real-world test set spanning four different domains, our approach yields
consistent improvements of up to +34.1% in accuracy across domains.
Furthermore, we present an analysis of our approach and demonstrate that voice
conversion helps mitigate the speaker bias in the ADI dataset. We release our
robust ADI model and cross-domain evaluation dataset to support the development
of inclusive speech technologies for Arabic.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have experienced rapid development
in recent years. However, in the financial domain, there is a notable lack of
effective and specialized multimodal evaluation datasets. To advance the
development of MLLMs in the finance domain, we introduce FinMME, encompassing
more than 11,000 high-quality financial research samples across 18 financial

ensure data quality through 20 annotators and carefully designed validation
mechanisms. Additionally, we develop FinScore, an evaluation system
incorporating hallucination penalties and multi-dimensional capability
assessment to provide an unbiased evaluation. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o exhibit
unsatisfactory performance on FinMME, highlighting its challenging nature. The
benchmark exhibits high robustness with prediction variations under different

Result: 多种模型架构均表现显著提升，小模型（1.5B-7B参数）优于大10倍的同类模型。

Conclusion: 该范式为语言模型在有限反馈下自我改进提供了新途径。

Abstract: We explore a method for improving the performance of large language models
through self-reflection and reinforcement learning. By incentivizing the model
to generate better self-reflections when it answers incorrectly, we demonstrate
that a model's ability to solve complex, verifiable tasks can be enhanced even
when generating synthetic data is infeasible and only binary feedback is
available. Our framework operates in two stages: first, upon failing a given
task, the model generates a self-reflective commentary analyzing its previous
attempt; second, the model is given another attempt at the task with the
self-reflection in context. If the subsequent attempt succeeds, the tokens
generated during the self-reflection phase are rewarded. Our experimental
results show substantial performance gains across a variety of model
architectures, as high as 34.7% improvement at math equation writing and 18.1%
improvement at function calling. Notably, smaller fine-tuned models (1.5
billion to 7 billion parameters) outperform models in the same family that are
10 times larger. Our novel paradigm is thus an exciting pathway to more useful
and reliable language models that can self-improve on challenging tasks with
limited external feedback.

Motivation: 由于大型语言模型的快速发展，传统基准测试容易饱和，而创建更具挑战性的数据集又耗时耗力。因此，需要一种新的方法来评估模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为将模型的泛化能力与其可解释性联系起来提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Extensively evaluating the capabilities of (large) language models is
difficult. Rapid development of state-of-the-art models induce benchmark
saturation, while creating more challenging datasets is labor-intensive.
Inspired by the recent developments in mechanistic interpretability, we
introduce circuit stability as a new way to assess model performance. Circuit
stability refers to a model's ability to apply a consistent reasoning
process-its circuit-across various inputs. We mathematically formalize circuit
stability and circuit equivalence. Then, through three case studies, we
empirically show that circuit stability and the lack thereof can characterize
and predict different aspects of generalization. Our proposed methods offer a
step towards rigorously relating the generality of models to their

TL;DR: GSTransform是一种基于引导空间变换的轻量级框架，用于动态生成适应指令的文本嵌入，显著提升效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要为每条新指令重新编码整个语料库，计算开销大，因此需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出GSTransform框架，利用预计算嵌入的潜在信息，通过轻量级变换实时调整嵌入以适应指令。

Result: 在三个任务和九个数据集上，GSTransform在质量和速度上均优于现有方法，速度提升6~300倍。

Conclusion: GSTransform通过轻量级变换实现了高效、高质量的指令跟随文本嵌入，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate an important task named instruction-following
text embedding, which generates dynamic text embeddings that adapt to user
instructions, highlighting specific attributes of text. Despite recent
advancements, existing approaches suffer from significant computational
overhead, as they require re-encoding the entire corpus for each new
instruction. To address this challenge, we propose GSTransform, a novel
instruction-following text embedding framework based on Guided Space
Transformation. Our key observation is that instruction-relevant information is
inherently encoded in generic embeddings but remains underutilized. Instead of
repeatedly encoding the corpus for each instruction, GSTransform is a
lightweight transformation mechanism that adapts pre-computed embeddings in
real time to align with user instructions, guided by a small amount of text
data with instruction-focused label annotation. We conduct extensive
experiments on three instruction-awareness downstream tasks across nine
real-world datasets, demonstrating that GSTransform improves
instruction-following text embedding quality over state-of-the-art methods
while achieving dramatic speedups of 6~300x in real-time processing on
large-scale datasets. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种零样本LLM引导的摘要排序器（LGAR），用于系统性文献综述的摘要筛选，性能优于现有QA方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献快速增长，系统性文献综述（SLR）需要高效筛选相关论文。现有方法在二元分类或QA排序中存在局限性，LLM提供了新的可能性。

Method: 提出LGAR，结合LLM分级相关性评分器和密集重排序器，手动提取57篇SLR的纳入/排除标准和研究问题。

Result: LGAR在平均精度上比现有QA方法提升5-10个百分点。

Conclusion: LGAR为SLR摘要筛选提供了更优的解决方案，代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: The scientific literature is growing rapidly, making it hard to keep track of
the state-of-the-art. Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) aim to identify and
evaluate all relevant papers on a topic. After retrieving a set of candidate
papers, the abstract screening phase determines initial relevance. To date,
abstract screening methods using large language models (LLMs) focus on binary
classification settings; existing question answering (QA) based ranking
approaches suffer from error propagation. LLMs offer a unique opportunity to
evaluate the SLR's inclusion and exclusion criteria, yet, existing benchmarks
do not provide them exhaustively. We manually extract these criteria as well as
research questions for 57 SLRs, mostly in the medical domain, enabling
principled comparisons between approaches. Moreover, we propose LGAR, a
zero-shot LLM Guided Abstract Ranker composed of an LLM based graded relevance
scorer and a dense re-ranker. Our extensive experiments show that LGAR
outperforms existing QA-based methods by 5-10 pp. in mean average precision.
Our code and data is publicly available.

*Haoyu Li,Xuhong Li,Yiming Dong,Kun Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文系统分析了数据集多样性对大型语言模型（LLM）监督微调（SFT）的重要性，提出了一种多样性控制策略的分类方法，并通过实验验证了不同策略对模型性能的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管数据集多样性对LLM训练至关重要，但其系统性分析仍不足。本文旨在填补这一空白，研究多样性控制策略对SFT性能的影响。

Method: 提出了一种多样性控制策略的分类方法，涵盖宏观（指令语义）、中观（指令单元）和微观（响应中的令牌分布）三个层次。通过构建固定大小的数据集（10,000样本），应用六种策略进行实验评估。

Result: 实验表明，宏观和中观策略在多样性增加时性能提升，而微观策略在响应中表现出更强的性能与多样性相关性，并在最大多样性时性能最优。

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建高性能SFT数据集提供了实用指导，强调了微观多样性在响应中的重要性。

Abstract: Dataset diversity plays a pivotal role for the successful training of many
machine learning models, particularly in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) stage
of large language model (LLM) development. Despite increasing recognition of
its importance, systematic analyses of dataset diversity still remain
underexplored. To address this gap, this work presents a systematic taxonomy of
existing diversity-control strategies, which primarily focus on the instruction
component, operating at either macroscopic (entire instruction semantics) or
mesoscopic levels (instruction units), and furthermore introduces a novel
analysis of microscopic diversity within the response component, specifically
analyzing the statistical distribution of tokens in SFT training samples. In
the experimental evaluation, we construct fixed-size datasets (e.g., 10,000
samples each) from a corpus of 117,000 open-source SFT samples, incorporating
six distinct diversity-control strategies spanning macro-, meso-, and
microscopic levels applied to both instructions and responses. We then
fine-tune LLMs on these datasets to assess the six diversity-control
strategies. Results reveal that while macroscopic and mesoscopic strategies
lead to higher performance with increasing diversity, the microscopic strategy
in responses exhibits both a stronger correlation between model performance and
the degree of diversity and superior performance with maximum diversity across
all strategies. These findings offer actionable insights for constructing
high-performance SFT datasets.

*Jiayu Liu,Qing Zong,Weiqi Wang,Yangqiu Song*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLMs）使用认知标记（如“相当自信”）表达置信度的可靠性，发现其在同分布场景下表现稳定，但在分布外场景中不一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于LLMs在高风险领域的应用增加，准确评估其置信度至关重要。人类通常通过认知标记而非数值表达置信度，但LLMs是否一致使用这些标记反映其内在置信度尚不明确。

Method: 定义标记置信度为模型使用认知标记时的观察准确率，并在同分布和分布外场景下评估开源和专有LLMs的稳定性。

Result: 认知标记在同分布场景下表现良好，但在分布外场景中置信度不一致。

Conclusion: 认知标记用于置信度估计的可靠性存在问题，需改进标记置信度与模型实际不确定性的对齐。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes domains,
accurately assessing their confidence is crucial. Humans typically express
confidence through epistemic markers (e.g., "fairly confident") instead of
numerical values. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs consistently use
these markers to reflect their intrinsic confidence due to the difficulty of
quantifying uncertainty associated with various markers. To address this gap,
we first define marker confidence as the observed accuracy when a model employs
an epistemic marker. We evaluate its stability across multiple
question-answering datasets in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
settings for open-source and proprietary LLMs. Our results show that while
markers generalize well within the same distribution, their confidence is
inconsistent in out-of-distribution scenarios. These findings raise significant
concerns about the reliability of epistemic markers for confidence estimation,
underscoring the need for improved alignment between marker based confidence
and actual model uncertainty. Our code is available at

### [154] [Drop Dropout on Single-Epoch Language Model Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24788)
*Houjun Liu,John Bauer,Christopher D. Manning*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现，在单周期预训练中不使用dropout能提升语言模型的下游任务表现，且模型编辑性更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨dropout在大型语言模型预训练中的作用，尤其是在单周期预训练中是否必要。

Method: 通过实验比较不同dropout水平在BERT、Pythia 160M和1.4B模型中的表现，评估其对下游任务的影响。

Result: 不使用dropout时，语言建模、问答等任务表现更优；模型编辑性也更好。

Conclusion: 建议在单周期预训练中不使用dropout。

Abstract: Originally, dropout was seen as a breakthrough regularization technique that
reduced overfitting and improved performance in almost all applications of deep
learning by reducing overfitting. Yet, single-epoch pretraining tasks common to
modern LLMs yield minimal overfitting, leading to dropout not being used for
large LLMs. Nevertheless, no thorough empirical investigation has been done on
the role of dropout in LM pretraining. Through experiments in single-epoch
pretraining of both masked (BERT) and autoregressive (Pythia 160M and 1.4B) LMs
with varying levels of dropout, we find that downstream performance in language
modeling, morpho-syntax (BLiMP), question answering (SQuAD), and
natural-language inference (MNLI) improves when dropout is not applied during
pretraining. We additionally find that the recently-introduced "early dropout"
also degrades performance over applying no dropout at all. We further
investigate the models' editability, and find that models trained without
dropout are more successful in gradient-based model editing (MEND) and
equivalent in representation-based model editing (ReFT). Therefore, we advocate
to drop dropout during single-epoch pretraining.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在长故事生成中保持连贯性和用户控制的问题。

Method: 提出了一种KG辅助的故事生成流程，并通过15名参与者的用户研究评估其效果。

Result: 知识图谱显著提升了动作导向和结构化叙事的质量，并增强了用户的控制感。

Conclusion: KG辅助的故事生成系统能提高叙事质量和用户参与度。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in automated story
generation, but challenges remain in maintaining long-form coherence and
providing users with intuitive and effective control. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) has proven effective in reducing hallucinations in text
generation; however, the use of structured data to support generative
storytelling remains underexplored. This paper investigates how knowledge
graphs (KGs) can enhance LLM-based storytelling by improving narrative quality
and enabling user-driven modifications. We propose a KG-assisted storytelling
pipeline and evaluate its effectiveness through a user study with 15
participants. Participants created their own story prompts, generated stories,
and edited knowledge graphs to shape their narratives. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, our findings demonstrate that knowledge graphs
significantly enhance story quality in action-oriented and structured
narratives within our system settings. Additionally, editing the knowledge
graph increases users' sense of control, making storytelling more engaging,
interactive, and playful.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估法律文本质量的框架，包括清晰度、连贯性和术语准确性，并分析了49个大型语言模型（LLM），发现模型质量在140亿参数后趋于稳定，推理模型表现优于基础架构，同时发布了Qwen3系列为性价比最优选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前法律领域的大型语言模型评估主要关注事实准确性，而忽略了语言质量（如清晰度、连贯性和术语准确性），因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 1. 开发回归模型评估法律文本质量；2. 创建专门的法律问题集；3. 使用该框架分析49个LLM。

Result: 1. 模型质量在140亿参数后提升有限（72亿参数仅提升2.7%）；2. 量化与上下文长度影响可忽略；3. 推理模型表现更优。Qwen3系列为性价比最优。

Conclusion: 研究不仅建立了法律LLM的标准化评估协议，还揭示了当前训练数据优化的局限性，并发布了代码和模型。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in legal applications,
current evaluation benchmarks tend to focus mainly on factual accuracy while
largely neglecting important linguistic quality aspects such as clarity,
coherence, and terminology. To address this gap, we propose three steps: First,
we develop a regression model to evaluate the quality of legal texts based on
clarity, coherence, and terminology. Second, we create a specialized set of
legal questions. Third, we analyze 49 LLMs using this evaluation framework.
  Our analysis identifies three key findings: First, model quality levels off
at 14 billion parameters, with only a marginal improvement of $2.7\%$ noted at
72 billion parameters. Second, engineering choices such as quantization and
context length have a negligible impact, as indicated by statistical
significance thresholds above 0.016. Third, reasoning models consistently
outperform base architectures. A significant outcome of our research is the
release of a ranking list and Pareto analysis, which highlight the Qwen3 series
as the optimal choice for cost-performance tradeoffs. This work not only
establishes standardized evaluation protocols for legal LLMs but also uncovers
fundamental limitations in current training data refinement approaches. Code

Motivation: 大型语言模型在医学领域存在幻觉和引用不准确的问题，影响其临床应用和合规性。

Method: 通过将模型生成的回答分解为可验证的原子事实，并对照权威医学指南进行独立验证。

Result: 实验显示，该方法显著提高了事实准确性和可解释性，整体答案改进达40%，幻觉检测率达50%。

Conclusion: 该框架为医学AI应用提供了透明、可追溯的解释，是迈向可信赖临床应用的关键一步。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit extensive medical knowledge but are
prone to hallucinations and inaccurate citations, which pose a challenge to
their clinical adoption and regulatory compliance. Current methods, such as
Retrieval Augmented Generation, partially address these issues by grounding
answers in source documents, but hallucinations and low fact-level
explainability persist. In this work, we introduce a novel atomic fact-checking
framework designed to enhance the reliability and explainability of LLMs used
in medical long-form question answering. This method decomposes LLM-generated
responses into discrete, verifiable units called atomic facts, each of which is
independently verified against an authoritative knowledge base of medical
guidelines. This approach enables targeted correction of errors and direct
tracing to source literature, thereby improving the factual accuracy and
explainability of medical Q&A. Extensive evaluation using multi-reader
assessments by medical experts and an automated open Q&A benchmark demonstrated
significant improvements in factual accuracy and explainability. Our framework
achieved up to a 40% overall answer improvement and a 50% hallucination
detection rate. The ability to trace each atomic fact back to the most relevant
chunks from the database provides a granular, transparent explanation of the
generated responses, addressing a major gap in current medical AI applications.
This work represents a crucial step towards more trustworthy and reliable
clinical applications of LLMs, addressing key prerequisites for clinical
application and fostering greater confidence in AI-assisted healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决语言模型研究中难以区分记忆与泛化的问题，并量化模型容量。

Method: 将记忆分为无意记忆和泛化两部分，通过消除泛化计算总记忆量，训练不同规模的模型并观察其行为。

Result: 发现GPT风格模型的容量约为每参数3.6比特，模型在容量填满后会开始泛化。

Conclusion: 研究提供了模型容量与数据规模的关系，为理解语言模型行为提供了新视角。

Abstract: We propose a new method for estimating how much a model ``knows'' about a
datapoint and use it to measure the capacity of modern language models. Prior
studies of language model memorization have struggled to disentangle
memorization from generalization. We formally separate memorization into two
components: \textit{unintended memorization}, the information a model contains
about a specific dataset, and \textit{generalization}, the information a model
contains about the true data-generation process. When we completely eliminate
generalization, we can compute the total memorization, which provides an
estimate of model capacity: our measurements estimate that GPT-style models
have a capacity of approximately 3.6 bits per parameter. We train language
models on datasets of increasing size and observe that models memorize until
their capacity fills, at which point ``grokking'' begins, and unintended
memorization decreases as models begin to generalize. We train hundreds of
transformer language models ranging from $500K$ to $1.5B$ parameters and
produce a series of scaling laws relating model capacity and data size to
membership inference.

Result: 多语言训练并非跨语言迁移的关键因素，数据构成和评估方法更能解释其表现。

Conclusion: 呼吁更严谨的多语言NLP评估，并发布模型和基准以支持研究，尤其关注低资源和类型多样的语言。

Abstract: Cross-lingual transfer allows models to perform tasks in languages unseen
during training and is often assumed to benefit from increased multilinguality.
In this work, we challenge this assumption in the context of two underexplored,
sense-aware tasks: polysemy disambiguation and lexical semantic change. Through
a large-scale analysis across 28 languages, we show that multilingual training
is neither necessary nor inherently beneficial for effective transfer. Instead,
we find that confounding factors - such as fine-tuning data composition and
evaluation artifacts - better account for the perceived advantages of
multilinguality. Our findings call for more rigorous evaluations in
multilingual NLP. We release fine-tuned models and benchmarks to support
further research, with implications extending to low-resource and typologically
diverse languages.

Result: 现有方法效果不佳，而MetaFaith显著提升了校准效果，最高提升61%的忠实度。

Conclusion: MetaFaith是一种有效的校准方法，能显著改善LLM的不确定性表达可靠性。

Abstract: A critical component in the trustworthiness of LLMs is reliable uncertainty
communication, yet LLMs often use assertive language when conveying false
claims, leading to over-reliance and eroded trust. We present the first
systematic study of $\textit{faithful confidence calibration}$ of LLMs,
benchmarking models' ability to use linguistic expressions of uncertainty that
$\textit{faithfully reflect}$ their intrinsic uncertainty, across a
comprehensive array of models, datasets, and prompting strategies. Our results
demonstrate that LLMs largely fail at this task, and that existing
interventions are insufficient: standard prompt approaches provide only
marginal gains, and existing, factuality-based calibration techniques can even
harm faithful calibration. To address this critical gap, we introduce
MetaFaith, a novel prompt-based calibration approach inspired by human
metacognition. We show that MetaFaith robustly improves faithful calibration
across diverse models and task domains, enabling up to 61% improvement in
faithfulness and achieving an 83% win rate over original generations as judged
by humans.

Abstract: This paper presents AlphaOne ($\alpha$1), a universal framework for

$\alpha$1 first introduces $\alpha$ moment, which represents the scaled

by modeling the insertion of reasoning transition tokens as a Bernoulli
stochastic process. After the $\alpha$ moment, $\alpha$1 deterministically
terminates slow thinking with the end-of-thinking token, thereby fostering fast
reasoning and efficient answer generation. This approach unifies and
generalizes existing monotonic scaling methods by enabling flexible and dense

Result: RL训练模型在广泛的pass@k评估中优于基础模型，甚至在基础模型完全失败的场景中表现优异。推理能力的提升与基础模型的任务能力和训练时长密切相关。

Conclusion: RL能探索并填充新的解决方案空间，为语言模型的推理能力扩展提供了新视角，并为未来长期RL研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning-centric language models have highlighted
reinforcement learning (RL) as a promising method for aligning models with
verifiable rewards. However, it remains contentious whether RL truly expands a
model's reasoning capabilities or merely amplifies high-reward outputs already
latent in the base model's distribution, and whether continually scaling up RL
compute reliably leads to improved reasoning performance. In this work, we
challenge prevailing assumptions by demonstrating that prolonged RL (ProRL)
training can uncover novel reasoning strategies that are inaccessible to base
models, even under extensive sampling. We introduce ProRL, a novel training
methodology that incorporates KL divergence control, reference policy
resetting, and a diverse suite of tasks. Our empirical analysis reveals that
RL-trained models consistently outperform base models across a wide range of
pass@k evaluations, including scenarios where base models fail entirely
regardless of the number of attempts. We further show that reasoning boundary
improvements correlates strongly with task competence of base model and
training duration, suggesting that RL can explore and populate new regions of
solution space over time. These findings offer new insights into the conditions
under which RL meaningfully expands reasoning boundaries in language models and
establish a foundation for future work on long-horizon RL for reasoning. We

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大规模训练的生物视觉模型是否能够超越初始训练目标，学习到新的能力。

Method: 使用TreeOfLife-200M数据集训练BioCLIP 2，通过对比学习区分物种。

Result: BioCLIP 2在栖息地分类和性状预测等任务中表现优异，嵌入空间展现出生态和功能相关性。

Conclusion: 大规模训练数据能够促进生物视觉模型学习到更具生物学意义的嵌入空间。

Abstract: Foundation models trained at scale exhibit remarkable emergent behaviors,
learning new capabilities beyond their initial training objectives. We find
such emergent behaviors in biological vision models via large-scale contrastive
vision-language training. To achieve this, we first curate TreeOfLife-200M,
comprising 214 million images of living organisms, the largest and most diverse
biological organism image dataset to date. We then train BioCLIP 2 on
TreeOfLife-200M to distinguish different species. Despite the narrow training
objective, BioCLIP 2 yields extraordinary accuracy when applied to various
biological visual tasks such as habitat classification and trait prediction. We
identify emergent properties in the learned embedding space of BioCLIP 2. At
the inter-species level, the embedding distribution of different species aligns
closely with functional and ecological meanings (e.g., beak sizes and
habitats). At the intra-species level, instead of being diminished, the
intra-species variations (e.g., life stages and sexes) are preserved and better
separated in subspaces orthogonal to inter-species distinctions. We provide
formal proof and analyses to explain why hierarchical supervision and
contrastive objectives encourage these emergent properties. Crucially, our
results reveal that these properties become increasingly significant with
larger-scale training data, leading to a biologically meaningful embedding
space.

Abstract: Self-captured full-body videos are popular, but most deployments require
mounted cameras, carefully-framed shots, and repeated practice. We propose a

mobile devices. Our approach takes as input two static photos (front and back)
of you in a mirror, along with an IMU motion reference that you perform while
holding your mobile phone, and synthesizes a realistic video of you performing
a similar target motion. We enable rendering into a new scene, with consistent
illumination and shadows. We propose a novel video diffusion-based model to
achieve this. Specifically, we propose a parameter-free frame generation
strategy, as well as a multi-reference attention mechanism, that effectively
integrate appearance information from both the front and back selfies into the
video diffusion model. Additionally, we introduce an image-based fine-tuning
strategy to enhance frame sharpness and improve the generation of shadows and
reflections, achieving a more realistic human-scene composition.

*Amirhossein Almohammadi,Aryan Mikaeili,Sauradip Nag,Negar Hassanpour,Andrea Tagliasacchi,Ali Mahdavi-Amiri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cora是一种基于扩散的图像编辑框架，通过语义对应和噪声校正实现高质量编辑，解决了现有方法在结构变化和纹理保留上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像编辑方法在处理非刚性变形、对象修改或内容生成时存在纹理不相关或关键属性丢失的问题，需要一种更高效的解决方案。

Method: Cora引入语义对应的噪声校正和插值注意力图，通过对齐源图像和目标图像的纹理与结构，实现精确的纹理转移和新内容生成。

Result: 实验表明，Cora在保持结构、纹理和身份方面表现优异，适用于姿态变化、对象添加和纹理细化等多种编辑任务。

Conclusion: Cora在用户研究中表现优于现有方法，提供了更好的编辑控制和结果质量。

Abstract: Image editing is an important task in computer graphics, vision, and VFX,
with recent diffusion-based methods achieving fast and high-quality results.
However, edits requiring significant structural changes, such as non-rigid
deformations, object modifications, or content generation, remain challenging.
Existing few step editing approaches produce artifacts such as irrelevant
texture or struggle to preserve key attributes of the source image (e.g.,
pose). We introduce Cora, a novel editing framework that addresses these
limitations by introducing correspondence-aware noise correction and
interpolated attention maps. Our method aligns textures and structures between
the source and target images through semantic correspondence, enabling accurate
texture transfer while generating new content when necessary. Cora offers
control over the balance between content generation and preservation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that, quantitatively and qualitatively, Cora excels in
maintaining structure, textures, and identity across diverse edits, including
pose changes, object addition, and texture refinements. User studies confirm
that Cora delivers superior results, outperforming alternatives.

*Neehar Kondapaneni,Oisin Mac Aodha,Pietro Perona*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为RDX的方法，用于发现和可视化两种学习表示之间的差异，支持更直接和可解释的模型比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可解释AI（XAI）方法在模型比较方面表现不佳，而比较是科学分析的基础。

Method: 提出Representational Differences Explanations（RDX）方法，通过比较已知概念差异的模型进行验证。

Result: RDX在ImageNet和iNaturalist数据集上揭示了有意义的表示差异和数据的微妙模式，优于现有XAI技术。

Conclusion: RDX填补了机器学习中模型比较工具的空白，提供了一种有效且可解释的对比模型表示的工具。

Abstract: We propose a method for discovering and visualizing the differences between
two learned representations, enabling more direct and interpretable model
comparisons. We validate our method, which we call Representational Differences
Explanations (RDX), by using it to compare models with known conceptual
differences and demonstrate that it recovers meaningful distinctions where
existing explainable AI (XAI) techniques fail. Applied to state-of-the-art
models on challenging subsets of the ImageNet and iNaturalist datasets, RDX
reveals both insightful representational differences and subtle patterns in the
data. Although comparison is a cornerstone of scientific analysis, current
tools in machine learning, namely post hoc XAI methods, struggle to support
model comparison effectively. Our work addresses this gap by introducing an
effective and explainable tool for contrasting model representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ScaleLong是首个在同一视频内容中嵌入多层次时间尺度问题的基准测试，用于直接比较模型在不同时间尺度上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能直接比较模型在不同时间尺度上的表现，ScaleLong旨在解决这一问题。

Method: ScaleLong包含269个长视频，每个视频设计4-8个问题，覆盖四个时间尺度（秒、十秒、分钟、小时）。

Result: 评估23个MLLM显示，模型性能呈U型曲线，最短和最长时间尺度表现最佳。

Conclusion: ScaleLong为长视频理解提供了细粒度的多时间尺度基准，提升视觉标记容量可增强推理能力。

Abstract: Although long-video understanding demands that models capture hierarchical
temporal information -- from clip (seconds) and shot (tens of seconds) to event
(minutes) and story (hours) -- existing benchmarks either neglect this
multi-scale design or scatter scale-specific questions across different videos,
preventing direct comparison of model performance across timescales on the same
content. To address this, we introduce ScaleLong, the first benchmark to
disentangle these factors by embedding questions targeting four hierarchical
timescales -- clip (seconds), shot (tens of seconds), event (minutes), and
story (hours) -- all within the same video content. This within-content
multi-timescale questioning design enables direct comparison of model
performance across timescales on identical videos. ScaleLong features 269 long
videos (avg.\ 86\,min) from 5 main categories and 36 sub-categories, with 4--8
carefully designed questions, including at least one question for each
timescale. Evaluating 23 MLLMs reveals a U-shaped performance curve, with
higher accuracy at the shortest and longest timescales and a dip at
intermediate levels. Furthermore, ablation studies show that increased visual
token capacity consistently enhances reasoning across all timescales. ScaleLong
offers a fine-grained, multi-timescale benchmark for advancing MLLM
capabilities in long-video understanding. The code and dataset are available

*Xuweiyi Chen,Wentao Zhou,Aruni RoyChowdhury,Zezhou Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Point-MoE提出了一种混合专家架构，用于解决3D点云理解中的跨域泛化问题，无需依赖域标签即可自动分配专家模块，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云数据因来源多样（如不同传感器和场景）导致域异质性，传统方法难以实现跨域统一建模，且域标签通常不可用。

Method: 提出Point-MoE架构，采用简单的top-k路由策略，自动分配专家模块处理不同域的数据。

Result: Point-MoE在混合域数据上表现优于传统方法，并能更好地泛化到未见过的域。

Conclusion: Point-MoE为3D理解提供了一种无需人工干预的可扩展解决方案，通过模型自动发现数据中的结构。

Abstract: While scaling laws have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, 3D point cloud understanding has yet to reach that stage. This can be
attributed to both the comparatively smaller scale of 3D datasets, as well as
the disparate sources of the data itself. Point clouds are captured by diverse
sensors (e.g., depth cameras, LiDAR) across varied domains (e.g., indoor,
outdoor), each introducing unique scanning patterns, sampling densities, and
semantic biases. Such domain heterogeneity poses a major barrier towards
training unified models at scale, especially under the realistic constraint
that domain labels are typically inaccessible at inference time. In this work,
we propose Point-MoE, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture designed to enable
large-scale, cross-domain generalization in 3D perception. We show that
standard point cloud backbones degrade significantly in performance when
trained on mixed-domain data, whereas Point-MoE with a simple top-k routing
strategy can automatically specialize experts, even without access to domain
labels. Our experiments demonstrate that Point-MoE not only outperforms strong
multi-domain baselines but also generalizes better to unseen domains. This work
highlights a scalable path forward for 3D understanding: letting the model
discover structure in diverse 3D data, rather than imposing it via manual
curation or domain supervision.

Result: 综述了当前最先进的方法及其在基准数据集上的表现，并讨论了可用数据集及其辅助信息。

Conclusion: 未来研究应进一步探索如何利用辅助信息提升检索性能。

Abstract: Text-to-Video (T2V) retrieval aims to identify the most relevant item from a
gallery of videos based on a user's text query. Traditional methods rely solely
on aligning video and text modalities to compute the similarity and retrieve
relevant items. However, recent advancements emphasise incorporating auxiliary
information extracted from video and text modalities to improve retrieval
performance and bridge the semantic gap between these modalities. Auxiliary
information can include visual attributes, such as objects; temporal and
spatial context; and textual descriptions, such as speech and rephrased
captions. This survey comprehensively reviews 81 research papers on
Text-to-Video retrieval that utilise such auxiliary information. It provides a
detailed analysis of their methodologies; highlights state-of-the-art results
on benchmark datasets; and discusses available datasets and their auxiliary
information. Additionally, it proposes promising directions for future
research, focusing on different ways to further enhance retrieval performance
using this information.

Abstract: Ensuring food safety is critical due to its profound impact on public health,
economic stability, and global supply chains. Cultivation of Mango, a major
agricultural product in several South Asian countries, faces high financial
losses due to different diseases, affecting various aspects of the entire
supply chain. While deep learning-based methods have been explored for mango
leaf disease classification, there remains a gap in designing solutions that
are computationally efficient and compatible with low-end devices. In this
work, we propose a lightweight Vision Transformer-based pipeline with a
self-attention mechanism to classify mango leaf diseases, achieving
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. Our approach
leverages global attention to capture intricate patterns among disease types
and incorporates runtime augmentation for enhanced performance. Evaluation on
the MangoLeafBD dataset demonstrates a 99.43% accuracy, outperforming existing
methods in terms of model size, parameter count, and FLOPs count.

Conclusion: VisualSphinx填补了视觉语言模型在逻辑推理训练数据上的空白，显著提升了模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) are expected to perform effective multimodal
reasoning and make logically coherent decisions, which is critical to tasks
such as diagram understanding and spatial problem solving. However, current VLM
reasoning lacks large-scale and well-structured training datasets. To bridge
this gap, we propose VisualSphinx, a first-of-its-kind large-scale synthetic
visual logical reasoning training data. To tackle the challenge of image
synthesis with grounding answers, we propose a rule-to-image synthesis
pipeline, which extracts and expands puzzle rules from seed questions and
generates the code of grounding synthesis image synthesis for puzzle sample
assembly. Experiments demonstrate that VLM trained using GRPO on VisualSphinx
benefit from logical coherence and readability of our dataset and exhibit
improved performance on logical reasoning tasks. The enhanced reasoning
capabilities developed from VisualSphinx also benefit other reasoning tasks
such as algebraic reasoning, arithmetic reasoning and geometry reasoning.

TL;DR: DeepTopoNet利用深度学习框架结合雷达和BedMachine数据，通过动态损失平衡机制重建格陵兰冰下地形，提高了精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 格陵兰冰下地形对预测冰盖质量损失和全球海平面上升至关重要，但观测数据稀疏且复杂，增加了模型不确定性。

Method: 提出DeepTopoNet框架，结合雷达和BedMachine数据，采用动态损失平衡机制和CNN架构，增强地形重建性能。

Result: 在Upernavik Isstrøm区域测试中，模型精度高，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习可有效填补观测空白，为冰下地形推断提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding Greenland's subglacial topography is critical for projecting
the future mass loss of the ice sheet and its contribution to global sea-level
rise. However, the complex and sparse nature of observational data,
particularly information about the bed topography under the ice sheet,
significantly increases the uncertainty in model projections. Bed topography is
traditionally measured by airborne ice-penetrating radar that measures the ice
thickness directly underneath the aircraft, leaving data gap of tens of
kilometers in between flight lines. This study introduces a deep learning
framework, which we call as DeepTopoNet, that integrates radar-derived ice
thickness observations and BedMachine Greenland data through a novel dynamic
loss-balancing mechanism. Among all efforts to reconstruct bed topography,
BedMachine has emerged as one of the most widely used datasets, combining mass
conservation principles and ice thickness measurements to generate
high-resolution bed elevation estimates. The proposed loss function adaptively
adjusts the weighting between radar and BedMachine data, ensuring robustness in
areas with limited radar coverage while leveraging the high spatial resolution
of BedMachine predictions i.e. bed estimates. Our approach incorporates
gradient-based and trend surface features to enhance model performance and
utilizes a CNN architecture designed for subgrid-scale predictions. By
systematically testing on the Upernavik Isstr{\o}m) region, the model achieves
high accuracy, outperforming baseline methods in reconstructing subglacial
terrain. This work demonstrates the potential of deep learning in bridging
observational gaps, providing a scalable and efficient solution to inferring
subglacial topography.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合深度引导交叉注意力和Transformer-CNN桥接的机制（Depth-CAR和TCB），用于改进无参考图像质量评估（NR-IQA），并在实验中取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NR-IQA中缺乏对未见自然失真的客观泛化能力的问题。

Method: 通过Depth-CAR机制提取场景深度和空间特征，结合TCB融合Transformer的全局上下文和CNN的局部特征。

Result: DGIQA模型在合成和真实基准数据集上表现最优，尤其在跨数据集评估和自然失真评估中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Depth-CAR和TCB的结合显著提升了NR-IQA的性能，适用于多种自然失真场景。

Abstract: A long-held challenge in no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA)
learning from human subjective perception is the lack of objective
generalization to unseen natural distortions. To address this, we integrate a
novel Depth-Guided cross-attention and refinement (Depth-CAR) mechanism, which
distills scene depth and spatial features into a structure-aware representation
for improved NR-IQA. This brings in the knowledge of object saliency and
relative contrast of the scene for more discriminative feature learning.
Additionally, we introduce the idea of TCB (Transformer-CNN Bridge) to fuse
high-level global contextual dependencies from a transformer backbone with
local spatial features captured by a set of hierarchical CNN (convolutional
neural network) layers. We implement TCB and Depth-CAR as multimodal
attention-based projection functions to select the most informative features,
which also improve training time and inference efficiency. Experimental results
demonstrate that our proposed DGIQA model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on both synthetic and authentic benchmark datasets. More
importantly, DGIQA outperforms SOTA models on cross-dataset evaluations as well
as in assessing natural image distortions such as low-light effects, hazy
conditions, and lens flares.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于集成预处理的框架，通过自适应选择输入过滤方法，显著减少了大型语言模型（LLMs）中的视觉幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉幻觉问题影响了LLMs的可靠性，特别是在需要精确输出的场景中。现有研究多关注事后修正或模型微调，而预处理技术的研究较少。

Method: 提出了一种集成预处理框架，根据问题类型自适应选择噪声减少（NR）、边缘增强（EE）或原始输入（org），无需修改模型架构或训练流程。

Result: 在`HaloQuest`数据集上测试，幻觉率降低了44.3%，通过SelfCheckGPT的NLI分数衡量。

Conclusion: 智能输入预处理可显著提升LLMs的事实基础，为更可靠的多模态系统提供了方向。

Abstract: Visual hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs), where the model
generates responses that are inconsistent with the visual input, pose a
significant challenge to their reliability, particularly in contexts where
precise and trustworthy outputs are critical. Current research largely
emphasizes post-hoc correction or model-specific fine-tuning strategies, with
limited exploration of preprocessing techniques to address hallucination issues
at the input stage. This study presents a novel ensemble-based preprocessing
framework that adaptively selects the most appropriate filtering approach --
noise reduced (NR), edge enhanced (EE), or unaltered input (org) based on the
type of question posed, resulting into reduced hallucination without requiring
any modifications to the underlying model architecture or training pipeline.
Evaluated on the `HaloQuest' dataset -- a benchmark designed to test multimodal
reasoning on visually complex inputs, our method achieves a 44.3% reduction in
hallucination rates, as measured by Natural Language Inference (NLI) scores
using SelfCheckGPT. This demonstrates that intelligent input conditioning alone
can significantly enhance factual grounding in LLM responses. The findings
highlight the importance of adaptive preprocessing techniques in mitigating
hallucinations, paving the way for more reliable multimodal systems capable of
addressing real-world challenges.

Result: 实验表明，MPR能有效测量多群体代表性，优化后模型在保持生成质量的同时更平衡。

Conclusion: MPR为T2I模型的公平性提供了可量化的评估和优化方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models can create vivid, realistic images from
textual descriptions. As these models proliferate, they expose new concerns
about their ability to represent diverse demographic groups, propagate
stereotypes, and efface minority populations. Despite growing attention to the
"safe" and "responsible" design of artificial intelligence (AI), there is no
established methodology to systematically measure and control representational
harms in image generation. This paper introduces a novel framework to measure
the representation of intersectional groups in images generated by T2I models
by applying the Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR) metric. MPR
evaluates the worst-case deviation of representation statistics across given
population groups in images produced by a generative model, allowing for
flexible and context-specific measurements based on user requirements. We also
develop an algorithm to optimize T2I models for this metric. Through
experiments, we demonstrate that MPR can effectively measure representation
statistics across multiple intersectional groups and, when used as a training
objective, can guide models toward a more balanced generation across
demographic groups while maintaining generation quality.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的推理能力已通过强化学习取得显著成功，但视觉基础模型（如DINO系列）的推理能力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出DINO-R1，采用GRQO强化学习策略，结合KL正则化稳定训练，并集成视觉提示编码器和查询选择机制。

Result: 在COCO、LVIS和ODinW数据集上，DINO-R1显著优于监督微调基线，表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DINO-R1成功提升了视觉基础模型的推理能力，为视觉任务中的强化学习应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The recent explosive interest in the reasoning capabilities of large language
models, such as DeepSeek-R1, has demonstrated remarkable success through
reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning frameworks, exemplified by methods
like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, such reasoning
abilities remain underexplored and notably absent in vision foundation models,
including representation models like the DINO series. In this work, we propose
\textbf{DINO-R1}, the first such attempt to incentivize visual in-context
reasoning capabilities of vision foundation models using reinforcement
learning. Specifically, DINO-R1 introduces \textbf{Group Relative Query
Optimization (GRQO)}, a novel reinforcement-style training strategy explicitly
designed for query-based representation models, which computes query-level
rewards based on group-normalized alignment quality. We also apply
KL-regularization to stabilize the objectness distribution to reduce the
training instability. This joint optimization enables dense and expressive
supervision across queries while mitigating overfitting and distributional
drift. Building upon Grounding-DINO, we train a series of DINO-R1 family models
that integrate a visual prompt encoder and a visual-guided query selection
mechanism. Extensive experiments on COCO, LVIS, and ODinW demonstrate that
DINO-R1 significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning baselines, achieving
strong generalization in both open-vocabulary and closed-set visual prompting
scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UDA方法在作物与杂草分割中因遮挡和视觉混淆导致误分类，且依赖像素级标注，难以适应新领域。

Method: 引入深度梯度计算和跨注意力机制优化RGB特征，提出几何感知掩码策略增强空间上下文学习。

Result: 在真实农业数据集上，MaskAdapt优于现有SOTA方法，分割mIOU显著提升。

Conclusion: MaskAdapt通过多模态上下文学习和几何感知掩码，有效解决了UDA中的领域适应问题。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of crops and weeds is crucial for site-specific farm
management; however, most existing methods depend on labor intensive
pixel-level annotations. A further challenge arises when models trained on one
field (source domain) fail to generalize to new fields (target domain) due to
domain shifts, such as variations in lighting, camera setups, soil composition,
and crop growth stages. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses this by
enabling adaptation without target-domain labels, but current UDA methods
struggle with occlusions and visual blending between crops and weeds, leading
to misclassifications in real-world conditions. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce MaskAdapt, a novel approach that enhances segmentation accuracy
through multimodal contextual learning by integrating RGB images with features
derived from depth data. By computing depth gradients from depth maps, our
method captures spatial transitions that help resolve texture ambiguities.
These gradients, through a cross-attention mechanism, refines RGB feature
representations, resulting in sharper boundary delineation. In addition, we
propose a geometry-aware masking strategy that applies horizontal, vertical,
and stochastic masks during training. This encourages the model to focus on the
broader spatial context for robust visual recognition. Evaluations on real
agricultural datasets demonstrate that MaskAdapt consistently outperforms
existing State-of-the-Art (SOTA) UDA methods, achieving improved segmentation
mean Intersection over Union (mIOU) across diverse field conditions.

Abstract: Built environment auditing refers to the systematic documentation and
assessment of urban and rural spaces' physical, social, and environmental
characteristics, such as walkability, road conditions, and traffic lights. It
is used to collect data for the evaluation of how built environments impact
human behavior, health, mobility, and overall urban functionality.
Traditionally, built environment audits were conducted using field surveys and
manual observations, which were time-consuming and costly. The emerging street
view imagery, e.g., Google Street View, has become a widely used data source
for conducting built environment audits remotely. Deep learning and computer
vision techniques can extract and classify objects from street images to
enhance auditing productivity. Before meaningful analysis, the detected objects
need to be geospatially mapped for accurate documentation. However, the mapping
methods and tools based on street images are underexplored, and there are no
universal frameworks or solutions yet, imposing difficulties in auditing the
street objects. In this study, we introduced an open source street view mapping
framework, providing three pipelines to map and measure: 1) width measurement
for ground objects, such as roads; 2) 3D localization for objects with a known
dimension (e.g., doors and stop signs); and 3) diameter measurements (e.g.,
street trees). These pipelines can help researchers, urban planners, and other
professionals automatically measure and map target objects, promoting built
environment auditing productivity and accuracy. Three case studies, including
road width measurement, stop sign localization, and street tree diameter
measurement, are provided in this paper to showcase pipeline usage.

Abstract: Generating images from text involving complex and novel object arrangements
remains a significant challenge for current text-to-image (T2I) models.
Although prior layout-based methods improve object arrangements using spatial
constraints with 2D layouts, they often struggle to capture 3D positioning and
sacrifice quality and coherence. In this work, we introduce ComposeAnything, a
novel framework for improving compositional image generation without retraining
existing T2I models. Our approach first leverages the chain-of-thought
reasoning abilities of LLMs to produce 2.5D semantic layouts from text,
consisting of 2D object bounding boxes enriched with depth information and
detailed captions. Based on this layout, we generate a spatial and depth aware
coarse composite of objects that captures the intended composition, serving as
a strong and interpretable prior that replaces stochastic noise initialization
in diffusion-based T2I models. This prior guides the denoising process through
object prior reinforcement and spatial-controlled denoising, enabling seamless
generation of compositional objects and coherent backgrounds, while allowing
refinement of inaccurate priors. ComposeAnything outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on the T2I-CompBench and NSR-1K benchmarks for prompts with 2D/3D
spatial arrangements, high object counts, and surreal compositions. Human
evaluations further demonstrate that our model generates high-quality images
with compositions that faithfully reflect the text.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了功能定位问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this work, we focus on the task of weakly supervised affordance grounding,
where a model is trained to identify affordance regions on objects using
human-object interaction images and egocentric object images without dense
labels. Previous works are mostly built upon class activation maps, which are
effective for semantic segmentation but may not be suitable for locating
actions and functions. Leveraging recent advanced foundation models, we develop
a supervised training pipeline based on pseudo labels. The pseudo labels are
generated from an off-the-shelf part segmentation model, guided by a mapping
from affordance to part names. Furthermore, we introduce three key enhancements
to the baseline model: a label refining stage, a fine-grained feature alignment
process, and a lightweight reasoning module. These techniques harness the
semantic knowledge of static objects embedded in off-the-shelf foundation
models to improve affordance learning, effectively bridging the gap between
objects and actions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of
the proposed model has achieved a breakthrough improvement over existing
methods. Our codes are available at https://github.com/woyut/WSAG-PLSP .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胃肠道内窥镜检查对疾病早期诊断至关重要，但深度学习模型需要大量标注数据，而医疗数据的隐私性限制了基础模型的训练。

Method: 采用联邦学习框架，结合多种算法，在本地医院环境中训练基础模型，无需共享原始数据。

Result: 在分类、检测和分割三个下游任务中，训练的基础模型均表现出性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在联邦学习和隐私保护环境下有效，为医疗影像基础模型的开发提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy is essential in identifying GI tract
abnormalities in order to detect diseases in their early stages and improve
patient outcomes. Although deep learning has shown success in supporting GI
diagnostics and decision-making, these models require curated datasets with
labels that are expensive to acquire. Foundation models offer a promising
solution by learning general-purpose representations, which can be finetuned
for specific tasks, overcoming data scarcity. Developing foundation models for
medical imaging holds significant potential, but the sensitive and protected
nature of medical data presents unique challenges. Foundation model training
typically requires extensive datasets, and while hospitals generate large
volumes of data, privacy restrictions prevent direct data sharing, making
foundation model training infeasible in most scenarios. In this work, we
propose a FL framework for training foundation models for gastroendoscopy
imaging, enabling data to remain within local hospital environments while
contributing to a shared model. We explore several established FL algorithms,
assessing their suitability for training foundation models without relying on
task-specific labels, conducting experiments in both homogeneous and
heterogeneous settings. We evaluate the trained foundation model on three
critical downstream tasks--classification, detection, and segmentation--and
demonstrate that it achieves improved performance across all tasks,
highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in a federated,
privacy-preserving setting.

Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏科学背景评估，无法全面衡量视觉语言模型（VLMs）的科学推理能力。

Method: 设计CSVQA基准测试，涵盖多样化的STEM问题，并提出严格的评估协议，验证模型预测的中间推理步骤。

Result: 15个VLMs在CSVQA上的表现差异显著，最高准确率仅为49.6%，表明科学推理能力仍需提升。

Conclusion: CSVQA揭示了VLMs在科学推理上的不足，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet their capabilities for scientific reasoning
remains inadequately assessed. Current multimodal benchmarks predominantly
evaluate generic image comprehension or text-driven reasoning, lacking
authentic scientific contexts that require domain-specific knowledge
integration with visual evidence analysis. To fill this gap, we present CSVQA,
a diagnostic multimodal benchmark specifically designed for evaluating
scientific reasoning through domain-grounded visual question answering.Our
benchmark features 1,378 carefully constructed question-answer pairs spanning
diverse STEM disciplines, each demanding domain knowledge, integration of
visual evidence, and higher-order reasoning. Compared to prior multimodal
benchmarks, CSVQA places greater emphasis on real-world scientific content and
complex reasoning.We additionally propose a rigorous evaluation protocol to
systematically assess whether model predictions are substantiated by valid
intermediate reasoning steps based on curated explanations. Our comprehensive
evaluation of 15 VLMs on this benchmark reveals notable performance
disparities, as even the top-ranked proprietary model attains only 49.6\%
accuracy.This empirical evidence underscores the pressing need for advancing
scientific reasoning capabilities in VLMs. Our CSVQA is released at

TL;DR: S4-Driver是一种基于多模态大语言模型的自监督运动规划算法，通过稀疏体积策略将2D视觉表示转换为3D空间，无需微调视觉编码器，显著提升了自动驾驶轨迹规划性能。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶规划方法依赖人工标注或性能不足，且多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的预训练任务集中在2D图像空间，而非自动驾驶所需的3D空间。

Method: 提出S4-Driver算法，利用稀疏体积策略将MLLMs的视觉表示从视角视图无缝转换到3D空间，并聚合多视角和多帧视觉输入。

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo数据集上的实验表明，S4-Driver性能优于现有监督方法，且无需人工标注，具有强扩展性。

Conclusion: S4-Driver通过自监督学习和3D空间表示优化，显著提升了自动驾驶运动规划的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: The latest advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have
spurred a strong renewed interest in end-to-end motion planning approaches for
autonomous driving. Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to
learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks, while purely
self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate
planning trajectories without human annotations often underperform the state of
the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end
approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image
space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To
this end, we propose S4-Driver, a scalable self-supervised motion planning
algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation, based on the popular PaLI
multimodal large language model. S4-Driver uses a novel sparse volume strategy
to seamlessly transform the strong visual representation of MLLMs from
perspective view to 3D space without the need to finetune the vision encoder.
This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and
enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our
method, we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with
in-house camera data). Results show that S4-Driver performs favorably against
existing supervised multi-task approaches while requiring no human annotations.
It also demonstrates great scalability when pretrained on large volumes of
unannotated driving logs.

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of pathology foundation models in both research
and clinical decision support systems, exploring their security has become a
critical concern. However, despite their growing impact, the vulnerability of
these models to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this work,
we present the first systematic investigation into the security of pathology
foundation models for whole slide image~(WSI) analysis against adversarial
attacks. Specifically, we introduce the principle of \textit{local perturbation
with global impact} and propose a label-free attack framework that operates
without requiring access to downstream task labels. Under this attack
framework, we revise four classical white-box attack methods and redefine the
perturbation budget based on the characteristics of WSI. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on three representative pathology foundation models
across five datasets and six downstream tasks. Despite modifying only 0.1\% of
patches per slide with imperceptible noise, our attack leads to downstream
accuracy degradation that can reach up to 20\% in the worst cases. Furthermore,
we analyze key factors that influence attack success, explore the relationship
between patch-level vulnerability and semantic content, and conduct a
preliminary investigation into potential defence strategies. These findings lay
the groundwork for future research on the adversarial robustness and reliable
deployment of pathology foundation models. Our code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Learning a generalizable bimanual manipulation policy is extremely
challenging for embodied agents due to the large action space and the need for
coordinated arm movements. Existing approaches rely on Vision-Language-Action
(VLA) models to acquire bimanual policies. However, transferring knowledge from
single-arm datasets or pre-trained VLA models often fails to generalize
effectively, primarily due to the scarcity of bimanual data and the fundamental
differences between single-arm and bimanual manipulation. In this paper, we
propose a novel bimanual foundation policy by fine-tuning the leading
text-to-video models to predict robot trajectories and training a lightweight
diffusion policy for action generation. Given the lack of embodied knowledge in
text-to-video models, we introduce a two-stage paradigm that fine-tunes
independent text-to-flow and flow-to-video models derived from a pre-trained
text-to-video model. Specifically, optical flow serves as an intermediate
variable, providing a concise representation of subtle movements between
images. The text-to-flow model predicts optical flow to concretize the intent
of language instructions, and the flow-to-video model leverages this flow for
fine-grained video prediction. Our method mitigates the ambiguity of language
in single-stage text-to-video prediction and significantly reduces the
robot-data requirement by avoiding direct use of low-level actions. In
experiments, we collect high-quality manipulation data for real dual-arm robot,
and the results of simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 长视频理解中，视觉令牌数量庞大与语言模型上下文长度有限的矛盾，传统方法效率低且计算负担重。

Method: 1. 将关键帧选择建模为整数二次规划问题，优化查询相关性和帧多样性；2. 引入非关键帧生成的文本叙事，弥补时间不连续性。

Result: 在多个长视频基准测试中，Nar-KFC显著提升了MLLMs的性能。

Conclusion: Nar-KFC是一种高效的长视频压缩策略，结合视觉和文本模态，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Employing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for long video
understanding remains a challenging problem due to the dilemma between the
substantial number of video frames (i.e., visual tokens) versus the limited
context length of language models. Traditional uniform sampling often leads to
selection of irrelevant content, while post-training MLLMs on thousands of
frames imposes a substantial computational burden. In this paper, we propose
threading keyframes with narratives (Nar-KFC), a plug-and-play module to
facilitate effective and efficient long video perception. Nar-KFC generally
involves two collaborative steps. First, we formulate the keyframe selection
process as an integer quadratic programming problem, jointly optimizing
query-relevance and frame-diversity. To avoid its computational complexity, a
customized greedy search strategy is designed as an efficient alternative.
Second, to mitigate the temporal discontinuity caused by sparse keyframe
sampling, we further introduce interleaved textual narratives generated from
non-keyframes using off-the-shelf captioners. These narratives are inserted
between keyframes based on their true temporal order, forming a coherent and
compact representation. Nar-KFC thus serves as a temporal- and content-aware
compression strategy that complements visual and textual modalities.
Experimental results on multiple long-video benchmarks demonstrate that Nar-KFC
significantly improves the performance of popular MLLMs. Code will be made
publicly available.

Abstract: We present a simple yet effective training-free approach for zero-shot 3D
symmetry detection that leverages visual features from foundation vision models
such as DINOv2. Our method extracts features from rendered views of 3D objects
and backprojects them onto the original geometry. We demonstrate the symmetric
invariance of these features and use them to identify reflection-symmetry
planes through a proposed algorithm. Experiments on a subset of ShapeNet
demonstrate that our approach outperforms both traditional geometric methods

demonstrates how foundation vision models can help in solving complex 3D
geometric problems such as symmetry detection.

Conclusion: 随机图像配准是一种有效的预训练策略，可提升医学图像配准的性能和效率。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning-based medical image registration have shown
that training deep neural networks~(DNNs) does not necessarily require medical
images. Previous work showed that DNNs trained on randomly generated images
with carefully designed noise and contrast properties can still generalize well
to unseen medical data. Building on this insight, we propose using registration
between random images as a proxy task for pretraining a foundation model for
image registration. Empirical results show that our pretraining strategy
improves registration accuracy, reduces the amount of domain-specific data
needed to achieve competitive performance, and accelerates convergence during
downstream training, thereby enhancing computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准未能系统评估VLMs是否真正模仿临床医生的推理方式，还是仅依赖表面模式。

Method: DrVD-Bench包含三个模块（视觉证据理解、推理轨迹评估和报告生成评估），共7,789个图像-问题对，涵盖20种任务类型和17种诊断类别。

Result: 测试19种VLMs后发现，随着推理复杂度增加，性能显著下降；部分模型表现出类似人类的推理痕迹，但仍依赖表面相关性。

Conclusion: DrVD-Bench为开发可信赖的临床VLMs提供了严格的评估框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on
natural images and show early promise in interpretable medical image analysis.
However, existing benchmarks do not systematically evaluate whether these
models truly reason like human clinicians or merely imitate superficial
patterns. To address this gap, we propose DrVD-Bench, the first multimodal
benchmark for clinical visual reasoning. DrVD-Bench consists of three modules:
Visual Evidence Comprehension, Reasoning Trajectory Assessment, and Report
Generation Evaluation, comprising a total of 7,789 image-question pairs. Our
benchmark covers 20 task types, 17 diagnostic categories, and five imaging
modalities-CT, MRI, ultrasound, radiography, and pathology. DrVD-Bench is
explicitly structured to reflect the clinical reasoning workflow from modality
recognition to lesion identification and diagnosis. We benchmark 19 VLMs,
including general-purpose and medical-specific, open-source and proprietary
models, and observe that performance drops sharply as reasoning complexity
increases. While some models begin to exhibit traces of human-like reasoning,
they often still rely on shortcut correlations rather than grounded visual
understanding. DrVD-Bench offers a rigorous and structured evaluation framework
to guide the development of clinically trustworthy VLMs.

Motivation: 当前MLLMs在理解物理世界的运动规律、空间关系和因果关系方面存在显著不足，尤其是在复杂场景中的视觉物理推理能力较弱。

Method: 提出MVPBench基准，通过视觉链式思维（CoT）评估模型，并设计图式CoT一致性指标验证推理路径的物理逻辑有效性。

Result: 实验显示，即使最先进的MLLMs在视觉物理推理和图像-文本对齐方面表现不佳，且RL后训练对齐可能损害空间推理能力。

Conclusion: 需要重新思考当前微调实践，以提升MLLMs的视觉物理推理能力。

Abstract: Understanding the physical world - governed by laws of motion, spatial
relations, and causality - poses a fundamental challenge for multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). While recent advances such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-4o
demonstrate impressive perceptual and reasoning capabilities, our investigation
reveals these models struggle profoundly with visual physical reasoning,
failing to grasp basic physical laws, spatial interactions, and causal effects
in complex scenes. More importantly, they often fail to follow coherent
reasoning chains grounded in visual evidence, especially when multiple steps
are needed to arrive at the correct answer. To rigorously evaluate this
capability, we introduce MVPBench, a curated benchmark designed to rigorously
evaluate visual physical reasoning through the lens of visual chain-of-thought
(CoT). Each example features interleaved multi-image inputs and demands not
only the correct final answer but also a coherent, step-by-step reasoning path
grounded in evolving visual cues. This setup mirrors how humans reason through
real-world physical processes over time. To ensure fine-grained evaluation, we
introduce a graph-based CoT consistency metric that verifies whether the
reasoning path of model adheres to valid physical logic. Additionally, we
minimize shortcut exploitation from text priors, encouraging models to rely on
visual understanding. Experimental results reveal a concerning trend: even
cutting-edge MLLMs exhibit poor visual reasoning accuracy and weak image-text
alignment in physical domains. Surprisingly, RL-based post-training alignment -
commonly believed to improve visual reasoning performance - often harms spatial
reasoning, suggesting a need to rethink current fine-tuning practices.

Motivation: 解决统一图像恢复模型在多样化和混合退化任务中的优化不稳定性和任务间冲突问题。

Method: 提出SIPL范式，通过Proxy Fusion模块和特权字典在训练和推理阶段利用特权信息进行自我改进。

Result: 在多种图像恢复基准测试中表现优异，PSNR显著提升（如+4.58 dB）。

Conclusion: SIPL是一种高效且广泛适用的方法，可无缝集成到多种骨干网络中。

Abstract: Unified image restoration models for diverse and mixed degradations often
suffer from unstable optimization dynamics and inter-task conflicts. This paper
introduces Self-Improved Privilege Learning (SIPL), a novel paradigm that
overcomes these limitations by innovatively extending the utility of privileged
information (PI) beyond training into the inference stage. Unlike conventional
Privilege Learning, where ground-truth-derived guidance is typically discarded
after training, SIPL empowers the model to leverage its own preliminary outputs
as pseudo-privileged signals for iterative self-refinement at test time.
Central to SIPL is Proxy Fusion, a lightweight module incorporating a learnable
Privileged Dictionary. During training, this dictionary distills essential
high-frequency and structural priors from privileged feature representations.
Critically, at inference, the same learned dictionary then interacts with
features derived from the model's initial restoration, facilitating a
self-correction loop. SIPL can be seamlessly integrated into various backbone
architectures, offering substantial performance improvements with minimal
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SIPL
significantly advances the state-of-the-art on diverse all-in-one image
restoration benchmarks. For instance, when integrated with the PromptIR model,
SIPL achieves remarkable PSNR improvements of +4.58 dB on composite degradation
tasks and +1.28 dB on diverse five-task benchmarks, underscoring its
effectiveness and broad applicability. Codes are available at our project page

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管扩散模型在高保真图像和视频生成中表现优异，但中NFE范围的研究较少，而实际应用（如Stable Diffusion 3.5）常在此范围内运行。

Method: 基于泰勒展开适应的一类刚性ODE求解器，提出STORK方法，适用于任何DM采样，包括噪声和流匹配模型。

Result: 在20-50 NFE范围内，STORK在无条件像素级生成和条件潜在空间生成任务中均提升了生成质量（FID评分）。

Conclusion: STORK是一种高效且通用的DM ODE求解器，填补了中NFE范围的研究空白，并在实际应用中表现出色。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. Because high-quality generations with
DMs typically require a large number of function evaluations (NFEs), resulting
in slow sampling, there has been extensive research successfully reducing the
NFE to a small range (<10) while maintaining acceptable image quality. However,
many practical applications, such as those involving Stable Diffusion 3.5,
FLUX, and SANA, commonly operate in the mid-NFE regime (20-50 NFE) to achieve
superior results, and, despite the practical relevance, research on the
effective sampling within this mid-NFE regime remains underexplored. In this
work, we propose a novel, training-free, and structure-independent DM ODE
solver called the Stabilized Taylor Orthogonal Runge--Kutta (STORK) method,
based on a class of stiff ODE solvers with a Taylor expansion adaptation.
Unlike prior work such as DPM-Solver, which is dependent on the semi-linear
structure of the DM ODE, STORK is applicable to any DM sampling, including
noise-based and flow matching-based models. Within the 20-50 NFE range, STORK
achieves improved generation quality, as measured by FID scores, across
unconditional pixel-level generation and conditional latent-space generation
tasks using models like Stable Diffusion 3.5 and SANA. Code is available at

Abstract: The advent of foundation models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
and Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), has redefined the frontiers of
artificial intelligence, enabling remarkable generalization across diverse
tasks with minimal or no supervision. Yet, their potential in biometric
recognition and analysis remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we
introduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the zero-shot and few-shot
performance of state-of-the-art publicly available VLMs and MLLMs across six
biometric tasks spanning the face and iris modalities: face verification, soft
biometric attribute prediction (gender and race), iris recognition,
presentation attack detection (PAD), and face manipulation detection (morphs
and deepfakes). A total of 41 VLMs were used in this evaluation. Experiments
show that embeddings from these foundation models can be used for diverse
biometric tasks with varying degrees of success. For example, in the case of
face verification, a True Match Rate (TMR) of 96.77 percent was obtained at a
False Match Rate (FMR) of 1 percent on the Labeled Face in the Wild (LFW)
dataset, without any fine-tuning. In the case of iris recognition, the TMR at 1
percent FMR on the IITD-R-Full dataset was 97.55 percent without any
fine-tuning. Further, we show that applying a simple classifier head to these
embeddings can help perform DeepFake detection for faces, Presentation Attack
Detection (PAD) for irides, and extract soft biometric attributes like gender
and ethnicity from faces with reasonably high accuracy. This work reiterates
the potential of pretrained models in achieving the long-term vision of
Artificial General Intelligence.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的源自由域适应方法（SFDA），结合了Shuffle PatchMix（SPM）增强技术和伪标签重加权策略，在多个基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究源自由域适应（SFDA）问题，即在无法访问源数据的情况下，模型如何适应目标域。

Method: 引入SPM增强技术（通过打乱和混合图像块生成多样化增强）和伪标签重加权策略（优先处理可靠的伪标签以减少噪声）。

Result: 在PACS、VisDA-C和DomainNet-126等基准测试中表现优异，PACS上单目标和多目标设置分别提升7.3%和7.2%。

Conclusion: SPM增强技术和伪标签重加权策略的结合为SFDA设定了新的基准。

Abstract: This work investigates Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), where a model
adapts to a target domain without access to source data. A new augmentation
technique, Shuffle PatchMix (SPM), and a novel reweighting strategy are
introduced to enhance performance. SPM shuffles and blends image patches to
generate diverse and challenging augmentations, while the reweighting strategy
prioritizes reliable pseudo-labels to mitigate label noise. These techniques
are particularly effective on smaller datasets like PACS, where overfitting and
pseudo-label noise pose greater risks. State-of-the-art results are achieved on
three major benchmarks: PACS, VisDA-C, and DomainNet-126. Notably, on PACS,
improvements of 7.3% (79.4% to 86.7%) and 7.2% are observed in single-target
and multi-target settings, respectively, while gains of 2.8% and 0.7% are
attained on DomainNet-126 and VisDA-C. This combination of advanced
augmentation and robust pseudo-label reweighting establishes a new benchmark
for SFDA. The code is available at: https://github.com/PrasannaPulakurthi/SPM

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LML的新方法，通过低秩近似和阻尼机制高效利用扩散Hessian几何，显著提升扩散模型生成图像的质量，且计算开销极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散模型采样技术主要依赖一阶Langevin动力学，而直接利用Hessian几何会导致计算复杂度高，难以扩展。因此，需要一种高效且训练免费的方法来提升采样质量。

Method: 提出Levenberg-Marquardt-Langevin (LML)方法，通过低秩近似扩散Hessian几何和阻尼机制，避免显式二次复杂度计算。

Result: LML方法显著提升了图像生成质量，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: LML方法为扩散模型提供了一种高效且可扩展的Hessian几何利用方式，具有理论和实验支持。

Abstract: The diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated the remarkable capability of
generating images via learning the noised score function of data distribution.
Current DM sampling techniques typically rely on first-order Langevin dynamics
at each noise level, with efforts concentrated on refining inter-level
denoising strategies. While leveraging additional second-order Hessian geometry
to enhance the sampling quality of Langevin is a common practice in Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), the naive attempts to utilize Hessian geometry in
high-dimensional DMs lead to quadratic-complexity computational costs,
rendering them non-scalable. In this work, we introduce a novel
Levenberg-Marquardt-Langevin (LML) method that approximates the diffusion
Hessian geometry in a training-free manner, drawing inspiration from the
celebrated Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm. Our approach introduces
two key innovations: (1) A low-rank approximation of the diffusion Hessian,
leveraging the DMs' inherent structure and circumventing explicit
quadratic-complexity computations; (2) A damping mechanism to stabilize the
approximated Hessian. This LML approximated Hessian geometry enables the
diffusion sampling to execute more accurate steps and improve the image
generation quality. We further conduct a theoretical analysis to substantiate
the approximation error bound of low-rank approximation and the convergence
property of the damping mechanism. Extensive experiments across multiple
pretrained DMs validate that the LML method significantly improves image
generation quality, with negligible computational overhead.

TL;DR: 研究发现，链式思维（CoT）提示可能降低大型语言模型（LLM）的归纳推理能力，而非提升。通过诊断任务和理论框架，揭示了三种错误模式，并提出结构化干预方法以改进准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨链式思维（CoT）提示是否真正提升大型语言模型的归纳推理能力，并分析其潜在问题。

Method: 设计四种游戏任务（如国际象棋、德州扑克等），比较CoT与非CoT模型的性能，提出理论框架分析错误模式。

Result: CoT提示可能降低模型性能，错误模式包括子任务分解、解决和答案总结错误。结构化干预显著提升准确性。

Conclusion: 有效的CoT推理不仅依赖步骤数量，还需确保步骤结构合理。结构化干预可改进性能而无需重新训练。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress across domains,
yet their ability to perform inductive reasoning - inferring latent rules from
sparse examples - remains limited. It is often assumed that chain-of-thought
(CoT) prompting, as used in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), enhances such
reasoning. We investigate this assumption with creating four controlled,
diagnostic game-based tasks - chess, Texas Hold'em, dice games, and blackjack -
with hidden human-defined rules. We find that CoT reasoning can degrade
inductive performance, with LRMs often underperforming their non-reasoning
counterparts.
  To explain this, we present a theoretical framework that reveals how
reasoning steps can amplify error through three failure modes: incorrect
sub-task decomposition, incorrect sub-task solving, and incorrect final answer
summarization. Based on our theoretical and empirical analysis, we introduce
structured interventions that adapt CoT generation according to our identified
failure types. These interventions improve inductive accuracy without
retraining. Our findings suggest that effective (CoT) reasoning depends not
only on taking more steps but also on ensuring those steps are well-structured.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LightD是一个通过语义引导的重新光照生成自然对抗样本的框架，适用于视觉与语言预训练（VLP）模型，解决了现有方法在生成自然扰动时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法主要针对分类任务，难以适应VLP模型，且生成的扰动不自然或无效。LightD旨在通过语义引导的重新光照生成更自然的对抗样本。

Method: LightD利用ChatGPT提出上下文感知的初始光照参数，结合预训练的重新光照模型（IC-light）进行多样化光照调整，并通过梯度优化提升攻击效果。

Result: LightD在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LightD通过语义引导的重新光照成功生成了自然的对抗样本，为VLP模型的对抗攻击提供了新思路。

Abstract: While adversarial attacks on vision-and-language pretraining (VLP) models
have been explored, generating natural adversarial samples crafted through
realistic and semantically meaningful perturbations remains an open challenge.
Existing methods, primarily designed for classification tasks, struggle when
adapted to VLP models due to their restricted optimization spaces, leading to
ineffective attacks or unnatural artifacts. To address this, we propose
\textbf{LightD}, a novel framework that generates natural adversarial samples
for VLP models via semantically guided relighting. Specifically, LightD
leverages ChatGPT to propose context-aware initial lighting parameters and
integrates a pretrained relighting model (IC-light) to enable diverse lighting
adjustments. LightD expands the optimization space while ensuring perturbations
align with scene semantics. Additionally, gradient-based optimization is
applied to the reference lighting image to further enhance attack effectiveness
while maintaining visual naturalness. The effectiveness and superiority of the
proposed LightD have been demonstrated across various VLP models in tasks such
as image captioning and visual question answering.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个统一的理论框架，将越狱攻击和幻觉问题分别建模为令牌级和注意力级优化，发现两者在损失函数收敛和梯度行为上具有一致性，并通过实验验证了这种联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型基础模型（LFMs）存在幻觉和越狱攻击两种漏洞，通常被孤立研究，但作者发现针对一种漏洞的防御会影响另一种，暗示两者存在深层联系。

Method: 提出统一理论框架，将越狱攻击建模为令牌级优化，幻觉为注意力级优化，并验证了两种优化在损失函数收敛和梯度行为上的一致性。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5和MiniGPT-4上的实验显示，两种优化的趋势和梯度行为一致，且针对一种漏洞的缓解技术可降低另一种漏洞的成功率。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LFMs中的共享故障模式，建议鲁棒性策略应同时解决两种漏洞。

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) are susceptible to two distinct
vulnerabilities: hallucinations and jailbreak attacks. While typically studied
in isolation, we observe that defenses targeting one often affect the other,
hinting at a deeper connection.
  We propose a unified theoretical framework that models jailbreaks as
token-level optimization and hallucinations as attention-level optimization.
Within this framework, we establish two key propositions: (1) \textit{Similar
Loss Convergence} - the loss functions for both vulnerabilities converge
similarly when optimizing for target-specific outputs; and (2) \textit{Gradient
Consistency in Attention Redistribution} - both exhibit consistent gradient
behavior driven by shared attention dynamics.
  We validate these propositions empirically on LLaVA-1.5 and MiniGPT-4,
showing consistent optimization trends and aligned gradients. Leveraging this
connection, we demonstrate that mitigation techniques for hallucinations can
reduce jailbreak success rates, and vice versa. Our findings reveal a shared
failure mode in LFMs and suggest that robustness strategies should jointly
address both vulnerabilities.

TL;DR: 论文提出{\dataset}基准，区分感知与推理引发的多模态幻觉，并设计{\method}方法减少推理错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法区分多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）中感知与推理引发的幻觉，阻碍了问题诊断。

Method: 提出{\dataset}基准隔离推理幻觉，设计{\method}方法结合课程强化微调和协作提示推理。

Result: 模型规模、数据规模和训练阶段显著影响幻觉类型；当前MLLMs在空间推理能力有限；问题类型与幻觉模式相关。

Conclusion: {\method}有效减少逻辑幻觉，为多模态推理挑战提供解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal hallucination in multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
restricts the correctness of MLLMs. However, multimodal hallucinations are
multi-sourced and arise from diverse causes. Existing benchmarks fail to
adequately distinguish between perception-induced hallucinations and
reasoning-induced hallucinations. This failure constitutes a significant issue
and hinders the diagnosis of multimodal reasoning failures within MLLMs. To
address this, we propose the {\dataset} benchmark, which isolates reasoning
hallucinations by constructing questions where input images are correctly
perceived by MLLMs yet reasoning errors persist. {\dataset} introduces
multi-granular evaluation metrics: accuracy, factuality, and LLMs hallucination
score for hallucination quantification. Our analysis reveals that (1) the model
scale, data scale, and training stages significantly affect the degree of
logical, fabrication, and factual hallucinations; (2) current MLLMs show no
effective improvement on spatial hallucinations caused by misinterpreted
spatial relationships, indicating their limited visual reasoning capabilities;
and (3) question types correlate with distinct hallucination patterns,
highlighting targeted challenges and potential mitigation strategies. To
address these challenges, we propose {\method}, a method that combines
curriculum reinforcement fine-tuning to encourage models to generate
logic-consistent reasoning chains by stepwise reducing learning difficulty, and
collaborative hint inference to reduce reasoning complexity. {\method}
establishes a baseline on {\dataset}, and reduces the logical hallucinations in
original base models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在结合扩散模型和自回归模型生成3D形状时存在挑战，LTM3D旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用条件分布建模主干、前缀学习和潜在令牌重建模块，支持多种3D表示形式。

Result: 实验表明，LTM3D在提示保真度和结构准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LTM3D提供了一个通用的多模态、多表示3D生成框架。

Abstract: We present LTM3D, a Latent Token space Modeling framework for conditional 3D
shape generation that integrates the strengths of diffusion and auto-regressive
(AR) models. While diffusion-based methods effectively model continuous latent
spaces and AR models excel at capturing inter-token dependencies, combining
these paradigms for 3D shape generation remains a challenge. To address this,
LTM3D features a Conditional Distribution Modeling backbone, leveraging a
masked autoencoder and a diffusion model to enhance token dependency learning.
Additionally, we introduce Prefix Learning, which aligns condition tokens with
shape latent tokens during generation, improving flexibility across modalities.
We further propose a Latent Token Reconstruction module with
Reconstruction-Guided Sampling to reduce uncertainty and enhance structural
fidelity in generated shapes. Our approach operates in token space, enabling
support for multiple 3D representations, including signed distance fields,
point clouds, meshes, and 3D Gaussian Splatting. Extensive experiments on
image- and text-conditioned shape generation tasks demonstrate that LTM3D
outperforms existing methods in prompt fidelity and structural accuracy while
offering a generalizable framework for multi-modal, multi-representation 3D
generation.

Abstract: Over the past 50 years, automated face recognition has evolved from
rudimentary, handcrafted systems into sophisticated deep learning models that
rival and often surpass human performance. This paper chronicles the history
and technological progression of FR, from early geometric and statistical
methods to modern deep neural architectures leveraging massive real and
AI-generated datasets. We examine key innovations that have shaped the field,
including developments in dataset, loss function, neural network design and
feature fusion. We also analyze how the scale and diversity of training data
influence model generalization, drawing connections between dataset growth and
benchmark improvements. Recent advances have achieved remarkable milestones:
state-of-the-art face verification systems now report False Negative
Identification Rates of 0.13% against a 12.4 million gallery in NIST FRVT
evaluations for 1:N visa-to-border matching. While recent advances have enabled
remarkable accuracy in high- and low-quality face scenarios, numerous
challenges persist. While remarkable progress has been achieved, several open
research problems remain. We outline critical challenges and promising
directions for future face recognition research, including scalability,
multi-modal fusion, synthetic identity generation, and explainable systems.

Motivation: 现有支气管镜定位方法泛化性差且对视觉退化敏感，PANSv2旨在通过多模态视觉线索和自动重新初始化模块解决这些问题。

Method: PANSv2结合深度估计、标志点检测和中心线约束，利用预训练的EndoOmni和EndoMamba模型增强泛化性，并引入自动重新初始化模块提升鲁棒性。

Result: 在10例患者数据上，PANSv2的跟踪成功率最高，绝对轨迹误差低于5mm的比例提升了18.1%。

Conclusion: PANSv2在泛化性和鲁棒性上表现优异，具有临床应用的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-based 6-DOF bronchoscopy localization offers a promising solution for
accurate and cost-effective interventional guidance. However, existing methods
struggle with 1) limited generalization across patient cases due to scarce
labeled data, and 2) poor robustness under visual degradation, as bronchoscopy
procedures frequently involve artifacts such as occlusions and motion blur that
impair visual information. To address these challenges, we propose PANSv2, a
generalizable and robust bronchoscopy localization framework. Motivated by PANS
that leverages multiple visual cues for pose likelihood measurement, PANSv2
integrates depth estimation, landmark detection, and centerline constraints
into a unified pose optimization framework that evaluates pose probability and
solves for the optimal bronchoscope pose. To further enhance generalization
capabilities, we leverage the endoscopic foundation model EndoOmni for depth
estimation and the video foundation model EndoMamba for landmark detection,
incorporating both spatial and temporal analyses. Pretrained on diverse
endoscopic datasets, these models provide stable and transferable visual
representations, enabling reliable performance across varied bronchoscopy
scenarios. Additionally, to improve robustness to visual degradation, we
introduce an automatic re-initialization module that detects tracking failures
and re-establishes pose using landmark detections once clear views are
available. Experimental results on bronchoscopy dataset encompassing 10 patient
cases show that PANSv2 achieves the highest tracking success rate, with an
18.1% improvement in SR-5 (percentage of absolute trajectory error under 5 mm)
compared to existing methods, showing potential towards real clinical usage.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练无关方法通过注意力掩码控制轨迹，但导致感知质量下降，本文将其归因于域偏移问题并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出掩码归一化以缓解内部协变量偏移，并使用时序内在扩散先验解决初始化噪声与条件不匹配问题。

Result: 实验表明，两种方法在感知质量和轨迹控制上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过域适应思想解决交互式视频生成中的关键问题，显著提升了生成效果。

Abstract: Text-conditioned diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools for
high-quality video generation. However, enabling Interactive Video Generation
(IVG), where users control motion elements such as object trajectory, remains
challenging. Recent training-free approaches introduce attention masking to
guide trajectory, but this often degrades perceptual quality. We identify two
key failure modes in these methods, both of which we interpret as domain shift
problems, and propose solutions inspired by domain adaptation. First, we
attribute the perceptual degradation to internal covariate shift induced by
attention masking, as pretrained models are not trained to handle masked
attention. To address this, we propose mask normalization, a pre-normalization
layer designed to mitigate this shift via distribution matching. Second, we
address initialization gap, where the randomly sampled initial noise does not
align with IVG conditioning, by introducing a temporal intrinsic diffusion
prior that enforces spatio-temporal consistency at each denoising step.
Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that mask
normalization and temporal intrinsic denoising improve both perceptual quality
and trajectory control over the existing state-of-the-art IVG techniques.

TL;DR: Disjoint-3DQA是一个评估视觉语言模型（VLM）在非共视对象对空间推理能力的生成式QA基准测试，发现当前模型与人类表现差距显著，尤其在时间间隔增大时性能下降明显。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估VLM在长时间跨度的空间推理能力，尤其是在对象不共视情况下的表现，以推动视觉、语言与具身AI的交叉研究。

Method: 引入Disjoint-3DQA基准测试，测试VLM对非共视对象对的问答能力，并分析不同辅助信息（如轨迹、鸟瞰图、3D坐标）对模型性能的影响。

Result: 当前VLM在非共视对象对问题上落后人类28%，时间间隔增大时性能下降更显著（60%至30%）。提供3D坐标可显著提升20%性能，而轨迹或鸟瞰图仅带来边际改进。

Conclusion: Disjoint-3DQA揭示了VLM在多帧视觉信号中构建和维护3D场景表示的核心瓶颈，为长期空间推理研究设定了明确挑战。

Abstract: An embodied AI assistant operating on egocentric video must integrate spatial
cues across time - for instance, determining where an object A, glimpsed a few
moments ago lies relative to an object B encountered later. We introduce
Disjoint-3DQA , a generative QA benchmark that evaluates this ability of VLMs
by posing questions about object pairs that are not co-visible in the same
frame. We evaluated seven state-of-the-art VLMs and found that models lag
behind human performance by 28%, with steeper declines in accuracy (60% to 30
%) as the temporal gap widens. Our analysis further reveals that providing
trajectories or bird's-eye-view projections to VLMs results in only marginal
improvements, whereas providing oracle 3D coordinates leads to a substantial
20% performance increase. This highlights a core bottleneck of multi-frame VLMs
in constructing and maintaining 3D scene representations over time from visual
signals. Disjoint-3DQA therefore sets a clear, measurable challenge for
long-horizon spatial reasoning and aims to catalyze future research at the
intersection of vision, language, and embodied AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言查询通常缺乏动作边界的具体细节，导致训练数据中的边界不确定性增加，影响定位效果。

Method: 1. 使用LLMs生成动作边界的文本描述以扩展查询；2. 建模边界概率分数，结合语义相似性和时间距离提供更一致的边界监督。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关，可无缝集成到现有模型中，显著提升了语言驱动动作定位的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Language-driven action localization in videos requires not only semantic
alignment between language query and video segment, but also prediction of
action boundaries.
  However, the language query primarily describes the main content of an action
and usually lacks specific details of action start and end boundaries, which
increases the subjectivity of manual boundary annotation and leads to boundary
uncertainty in training data.
  In this paper, on one hand, we propose to expand the original query by
generating textual descriptions of the action start and end boundaries through
LLMs, which can provide more detailed boundary cues for localization and thus
reduce the impact of boundary uncertainty.
  On the other hand, to enhance the tolerance to boundary uncertainty during
training, we propose to model probability scores of action boundaries by
calculating the semantic similarities between frames and the expanded query as
well as the temporal distances between frames and the annotated boundary
frames. They can provide more consistent boundary supervision, thus improving
the stability of training.
  Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly and easily integrated into
any existing models of language-driven action localization in an off-the-shelf
manner. Experimental results on several datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our method.

provide partial egocentric views or sparse exocentric multi-view context, but
do not explore the comprehensive combination of both. We introduce EgoExOR, the
first OR dataset and accompanying benchmark to fuse first-person and
third-person perspectives. Spanning 94 minutes (84,553 frames at 15 FPS) of two
emulated spine procedures, Ultrasound-Guided Needle Insertion and Minimally
Invasive Spine Surgery, EgoExOR integrates egocentric data (RGB, gaze, hand
tracking, audio) from wearable glasses, exocentric RGB and depth from RGB-D
cameras, and ultrasound imagery. Its detailed scene graph annotations, covering
36 entities and 22 relations (568,235 triplets), enable robust modeling of
clinical interactions, supporting tasks like action recognition and
human-centric perception. We evaluate the surgical scene graph generation
performance of two adapted state-of-the-art models and offer a new baseline
that explicitly leverages EgoExOR's multimodal and multi-perspective signals.
This new dataset and benchmark set a new foundation for OR perception, offering
a rich, multimodal resource for next-generation clinical perception.

Conclusion: 该模型能有效将神经活动转化为视觉表征，为脑机接口提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from EEG signals is a crucial step in realizing
brain-computer interfaces. In this paper, we propose a transformer-based EEG
signal encoder integrating the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and the gating
mechanism. Guided by the feature alignment and category-aware fusion losses,
this encoder is used to extract features related to visual stimuli from EEG
signals. Subsequently, with the aid of a pre-trained diffusion model, these
features are reconstructed into visual stimuli. To verify the effectiveness of
the model, we conducted EEG-to-image generation and classification tasks using
the THINGS-EEG dataset. To address the limitations of quantitative analysis at
the semantic level, we combined WordNet-based classification and semantic
similarity metrics to propose a novel semantic-based score, emphasizing the
ability of our model to transfer neural activities into visual representations.
Experimental results show that our model significantly improves semantic
alignment and classification accuracy, which achieves a maximum single-subject
accuracy of 43\%, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. The source code

### [208] [Progressive Class-level Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24310)
*Jiayan Li,Jun Li,Zhourui Zhang,Jianhua Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为渐进式类别级蒸馏（PCD）的新方法，通过分阶段蒸馏解决传统知识蒸馏中低概率类别被忽视的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法中，高置信度类别主导蒸馏过程，导致低概率类别的判别信息被忽视，知识传递不足。

Method: PCD方法通过排名教师-学生logits差异确定蒸馏优先级，并将蒸馏过程分为多个阶段，结合双向阶段蒸馏（从细到粗和从粗到细）实现充分的对齐。

Result: 在公开基准数据集上的实验表明，PCD在分类和检测任务上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PCD通过渐进式分阶段蒸馏有效解决了传统方法中低概率类别知识传递不足的问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: In knowledge distillation (KD), logit distillation (LD) aims to transfer
class-level knowledge from a more powerful teacher network to a small student
model via accurate teacher-student alignment at the logits level. Since
high-confidence object classes usually dominate the distillation process,
low-probability classes which also contain discriminating information are
downplayed in conventional methods, leading to insufficient knowledge transfer.
To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective LD method termed
Progressive Class-level Distillation (PCD). In contrast to existing methods
which perform all-class ensemble distillation, our PCD approach performs
stage-wise distillation for step-by-step knowledge transfer. More specifically,
we perform ranking on teacher-student logits difference for identifying
distillation priority from scratch, and subsequently divide the entire LD
process into multiple stages. Next, bidirectional stage-wise distillation
incorporating fine-to-coarse progressive learning and reverse coarse-to-fine
refinement is conducted, allowing comprehensive knowledge transfer via
sufficient logits alignment within separate class groups in different
distillation stages. Extension experiments on public benchmarking datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-arts for
both classification and detection tasks.

*Jinlu Zhang,Yixin Chen,Zan Wang,Jie Yang,Yizhou Wang,Siyuan Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本3D HOI生成框架，利用预训练模型解决开放集对象的新颖交互生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成开放集对象的文本到3D HOI时面临精确关系推理、对象功能解析和姿态合成的挑战。

Method: 结合LLMs推理关系、2D扩散模型解析对象接触点、多视角SDS生成初始姿态，并通过优化实现精细交互。

Result: 实验验证了方法在精细交互和开放集对象处理上的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架无需特定数据集训练，成功解决了开放集3D HOI生成的挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D human-aware generation have made significant progress.
However, existing methods still struggle with generating novel Human Object
Interaction (HOI) from text, particularly for open-set objects. We identify
three main challenges of this task: precise human-object relation reasoning,
affordance parsing for any object, and detailed human interaction pose
synthesis aligning description and object geometry. In this work, we propose a
novel zero-shot 3D HOI generation framework without training on specific
datasets, leveraging the knowledge from large-scale pre-trained models.
Specifically, the human-object relations are inferred from large language
models (LLMs) to initialize object properties and guide the optimization
process. Then we utilize a pre-trained 2D image diffusion model to parse unseen
objects and extract contact points, avoiding the limitations imposed by
existing 3D asset knowledge. The initial human pose is generated by sampling
multiple hypotheses through multi-view SDS based on the input text and object
geometry. Finally, we introduce a detailed optimization to generate
fine-grained, precise, and natural interaction, enforcing realistic 3D contact
between the 3D object and the involved body parts, including hands in grasping.
This is achieved by distilling human-level feedback from LLMs to capture
detailed human-object relations from the text instruction. Extensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach compared to prior works,
particularly in terms of the fine-grained nature of interactions and the
ability to handle open-set 3D objects.

Conclusion: STAR-Net成功结合了模型驱动和数据驱动的优势，解决了传统方法的不足，性能优越。

Abstract: Remote sensing image (RSI) denoising is an important topic in the field of
remote sensing. Despite the impressive denoising performance of RSI denoising
methods, most current deep learning-based approaches function as black boxes
and lack integration with physical information models, leading to limited
interpretability. Additionally, many methods may struggle with insufficient
attention to non-local self-similarity in RSI and require tedious tuning of
regularization parameters to achieve optimal performance, particularly in
conventional iterative optimization approaches. In this paper, we first propose
a novel RSI denoising method named sparse tensor-aided representation network
(STAR-Net), which leverages a low-rank prior to effectively capture the
non-local self-similarity within RSI. Furthermore, we extend STAR-Net to a
sparse variant called STAR-Net-S to deal with the interference caused by
non-Gaussian noise in original RSI for the purpose of improving robustness.
Different from conventional iterative optimization, we develop an alternating
direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-guided deep unrolling network, in which
all regularization parameters can be automatically learned, thus inheriting the
advantages of both model-based and deep learning-based approaches and
successfully addressing the above-mentioned shortcomings. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR-Net and
STAR-Net-S outperform state-of-the-art RSI denoising methods.

TL;DR: DisTime框架通过连续时间嵌入和分布时间解码器提升Video-LLMs的时间定位能力，并创建了InternVid-TG数据集，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs在时间定位上存在离散时间表示和数据不足的问题，DisTime旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: DisTime采用可学习令牌构建连续时间嵌入空间，结合分布时间解码器和编码器，并利用自动化标注生成InternVid-TG数据集。

Result: DisTime在三个时间敏感任务中达到最优性能，并在Video QA任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: DisTime通过创新框架和大规模数据集显著提升了Video-LLMs的时间理解能力。

Abstract: Despite advances in general video understanding, Video Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) face challenges in precise temporal localization due to discrete
time representations and limited temporally aware datasets. Existing methods
for temporal expression either conflate time with text-based numerical values,
add a series of dedicated temporal tokens, or regress time using specialized
temporal grounding heads. To address these issues, we introduce DisTime, a
lightweight framework designed to enhance temporal comprehension in Video-LLMs.
DisTime employs a learnable token to create a continuous temporal embedding
space and incorporates a Distribution-based Time Decoder that generates
temporal probability distributions, effectively mitigating boundary ambiguities
and maintaining temporal continuity. Additionally, the Distribution-based Time
Encoder re-encodes timestamps to provide time markers for Video-LLMs. To
overcome temporal granularity limitations in existing datasets, we propose an
automated annotation paradigm that combines the captioning capabilities of
Video-LLMs with the localization expertise of dedicated temporal models. This
leads to the creation of InternVid-TG, a substantial dataset with 1.25M
temporally grounded events across 179k videos, surpassing ActivityNet-Caption
by 55 times. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DisTime achieves
state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks in three time-sensitive tasks
while maintaining competitive performance in Video QA tasks. Code and data are
released at https://github.com/josephzpng/DisTime.

TL;DR: KairosAD是一种基于MobileSAM的轻量级异常检测方法，适用于资源受限的嵌入式设备，性能接近SOTA模型但参数和计算需求大幅降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有异常检测模型在中小企业生产线上部署时因计算资源需求高而不实用的问题。

Method: 利用Mobile Segment Anything Model (MobileSAM)进行图像异常检测。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和ViSA数据集上，KairosAD参数减少78%，推理速度提升4倍，AUROC性能接近SOTA。

Conclusion: KairosAD成功部署于嵌入式设备并验证了在实际生产线上的实用性。

Abstract: In the era of intelligent manufacturing, anomaly detection has become
essential for maintaining quality control on modern production lines. However,
while many existing models show promising performance, they are often too
large, computationally demanding, and impractical to deploy on
resource-constrained embedded devices that can be easily installed on the
production lines of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). To bridge this gap, we
present KairosAD, a novel supervised approach that uses the power of the Mobile
Segment Anything Model (MobileSAM) for image-based anomaly detection. KairosAD
has been evaluated on the two well-known industrial anomaly detection datasets,
i.e., MVTec-AD and ViSA. The results show that KairosAD requires 78% fewer
parameters and boasts a 4x faster inference time compared to the leading
state-of-the-art model, while maintaining comparable AUROC performance. We
deployed KairosAD on two embedded devices, the NVIDIA Jetson NX, and the NVIDIA
Jetson AGX. Finally, KairosAD was successfully installed and tested on the real
production line of the Industrial Computer Engineering Laboratory (ICE Lab) at
the University of Verona. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GeoVision Labeler (GVL) 是一个严格零样本分类框架，通过视觉大语言模型生成图像描述，再通过常规大语言模型映射到用户定义类别，实现了灵活的遥感图像分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决地理空间图像分类中标注数据稀缺的问题，提供无需任务特定预训练的零样本分类方案。

Method: 结合视觉大语言模型（vLLM）生成图像描述，再用常规大语言模型（LLM）映射到目标类别；复杂任务采用递归LLM驱动聚类和层次分类。

Conclusion: GVL 提供了一种模块化、可解释的零样本分类方法，适用于广泛的地理空间应用，并已开源以促进实际应用。

Abstract: Classifying geospatial imagery remains a major bottleneck for applications
such as disaster response and land-use monitoring-particularly in regions where
annotated data is scarce or unavailable. Existing tools (e.g., RS-CLIP) that
claim zero-shot classification capabilities for satellite imagery nonetheless
rely on task-specific pretraining and adaptation to reach competitive
performance. We introduce GeoVision Labeler (GVL), a strictly zero-shot
classification framework: a vision Large Language Model (vLLM) generates rich,
human-readable image descriptions, which are then mapped to user-defined
classes by a conventional Large Language Model (LLM). This modular, and
interpretable pipeline enables flexible image classification for a large range
of use cases. We evaluated GVL across three benchmarks-SpaceNet v7, UC Merced,
and RESISC45. It achieves up to 93.2% zero-shot accuracy on the binary
Buildings vs. No Buildings task on SpaceNet v7. For complex multi-class
classification tasks (UC Merced, RESISC45), we implemented a recursive
LLM-driven clustering to form meta-classes at successive depths, followed by
hierarchical classification-first resolving coarse groups, then finer
distinctions-to deliver competitive zero-shot performance. GVL is open-sourced
at https://github.com/microsoft/geo-vision-labeler to catalyze adoption in
real-world geospatial workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种知识增强的视觉情感分析框架K-EVER²，通过结构化情感知识和多模态对齐，解决了现有方法在复杂情感建模和解释性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像中情感线索的抽象性和复杂性使得现有视觉语言模型难以准确分析和解释，且缺乏结构化情感知识支持。

Method: 提出K-EVER²框架，结合外部情感知识和多模态对齐，无需手工标签或直接情感监督。

Result: 在三个基准测试中（Emotion6、EmoSet、M-Disaster），K-EVER²显著优于CNN和VLM基线，最高提升19%的准确率。

Conclusion: K-EVER²为视觉内容的情感理解提供了一种可扩展且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding what emotions images evoke in their viewers is a foundational
goal in human-centric visual computing. While recent advances in
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for visual emotion analysis
(VEA), several key challenges remain unresolved. Emotional cues in images are
often abstract, overlapping, and entangled, making them difficult to model and
interpret. Moreover, VLMs struggle to align these complex visual patterns with
emotional semantics due to limited supervision and sparse emotional grounding.
Finally, existing approaches lack structured affective knowledge to resolve
ambiguity and ensure consistent emotional reasoning across diverse visual
domains.
  To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{K-EVER\textsuperscript{2}},
a knowledge-enhanced framework for emotion reasoning and retrieval. Our
approach introduces a semantically structured formulation of visual emotion
cues and integrates external affective knowledge through multimodal alignment.
Without relying on handcrafted labels or direct emotion supervision,
K-EVER\textsuperscript{2} achieves robust and interpretable emotion predictions
across heterogeneous image types.
  We validate our framework on three representative benchmarks, Emotion6,
EmoSet, and M-Disaster, covering social media imagery, human-centric scenes,
and disaster contexts. K-EVER\textsuperscript{2} consistently outperforms
strong CNN and VLM baselines, achieving up to a \textbf{19\% accuracy gain} for
specific emotions and a \textbf{12.3\% average accuracy gain} across all
emotion categories. Our results demonstrate a scalable and generalizable
solution for advancing emotional understanding of visual content.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了视频理解领域泛化（VUDG）数据集，用于评估视频理解模型在域偏移下的表现，并发现现有模型在域泛化任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解研究忽视了真实世界中的域偏移问题，导致域泛化在视频理解中未被充分探索。

Method: 提出VUDG数据集，包含11个不同领域的视频，覆盖三种域偏移类型，并采用多专家渐进标注框架为视频标注多选和开放式问答对。

Result: 实验表明，大多数模型（包括最先进的视频语言模型）在域偏移下性能下降，揭示了当前模型对数据分布变化的鲁棒性不足。

Conclusion: VUDG为未来视频理解领域泛化研究提供了有价值的资源。

Abstract: Video understanding has made remarkable progress in recent years, largely
driven by advances in deep models and the availability of large-scale annotated
datasets. However, existing works typically ignore the inherent domain shifts
encountered in real-world video applications, leaving domain generalization
(DG) in video understanding underexplored. Hence, we propose Video
Understanding Domain Generalization (VUDG), a novel dataset designed
specifically for evaluating the DG performance in video understanding. VUDG
contains videos from 11 distinct domains that cover three types of domain
shifts, and maintains semantic similarity across different domains to ensure
fair and meaningful evaluation. We propose a multi-expert progressive
annotation framework to annotate each video with both multiple-choice and
open-ended question-answer pairs. Extensive experiments on 9 representative
large video-language models (LVLMs) and several traditional video question
answering methods show that most models (including state-of-the-art LVLMs)
suffer performance degradation under domain shifts. These results highlight the
challenges posed by VUDG and the difference in the robustness of current models
to data distribution shifts. We believe VUDG provides a valuable resource for
prompting future research in domain generalization video understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的跨模态知识蒸馏框架CroDiNo-KD，用于RGBD语义分割，通过解耦表示、对比学习和数据增强优化单模态模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统跨模态知识蒸馏框架在教师架构选择和蒸馏过程上的局限性，提升单模态模型在RGBD数据缺失时的表现。

Method: 利用解耦表示、对比学习和解耦数据增强，同时训练RGB和Depth单模态模型，优化神经网络内部流形结构。

Result: 在三个RGBD数据集上验证了CroDiNo-KD的优越性，优于现有跨模态知识蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: CroDiNo-KD框架为跨模态知识蒸馏提供了新思路，挑战了传统的教师/学生范式。

Abstract: Multi-modal RGB and Depth (RGBD) data are predominant in many domains such as
robotics, autonomous driving and remote sensing. The combination of these
multi-modal data enhances environmental perception by providing 3D spatial
context, which is absent in standard RGB images. Although RGBD multi-modal data
can be available to train computer vision models, accessing all sensor
modalities during the inference stage may be infeasible due to sensor failures
or resource constraints, leading to a mismatch between data modalities
available during training and inference. Traditional Cross-Modal Knowledge
Distillation (CMKD) frameworks, developed to address this task, are typically
based on a teacher/student paradigm, where a multi-modal teacher distills
knowledge into a single-modality student model. However, these approaches face
challenges in teacher architecture choices and distillation process selection,
thus limiting their adoption in real-world scenarios. To overcome these issues,
we introduce CroDiNo-KD (Cross-Modal Disentanglement: a New Outlook on
Knowledge Distillation), a novel cross-modal knowledge distillation framework
for RGBD semantic segmentation. Our approach simultaneously learns
single-modality RGB and Depth models by exploiting disentanglement
representation, contrastive learning and decoupled data augmentation with the
aim to structure the internal manifolds of neural network models through
interaction and collaboration. We evaluated CroDiNo-KD on three RGBD datasets
across diverse domains, considering recent CMKD frameworks as competitors. Our
findings illustrate the quality of CroDiNo-KD, and they suggest reconsidering
the conventional teacher/student paradigm to distill information from
multi-modal data to single-modality neural networks.

Conclusion: Grid-LoGAT通过网格化设计显著提升视频问答性能，同时兼顾隐私保护。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Grid-based Local and Global Area Transcription
(Grid-LoGAT) system for Video Question Answering (VideoQA). The system operates
in two phases. First, extracting text transcripts from video frames using a
Vision-Language Model (VLM). Next, processing questions using these transcripts
to generate answers through a Large Language Model (LLM). This design ensures
image privacy by deploying the VLM on edge devices and the LLM in the cloud. To
improve transcript quality, we propose grid-based visual prompting, which
extracts intricate local details from each grid cell and integrates them with
global information. Evaluation results show that Grid-LoGAT, using the
open-source VLM (LLaVA-1.6-7B) and LLM (Llama-3.1-8B), outperforms
state-of-the-art methods with similar baseline models on NExT-QA and STAR-QA
datasets with an accuracy of 65.9% and 50.11% respectively. Additionally, our
method surpasses the non-grid version by 24 points on localization-based
questions we created using NExT-QA.

Conclusion: D2AF框架解决了视觉定位中的标注瓶颈，通过自动生成高质量数据，显著提升了模型性能，并在多个任务中达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Visual Grounding is a task that aims to localize a target region in an image
based on a free-form natural language description. With the rise of Transformer
architectures, there is an increasing need for larger datasets to boost
performance. However, the high cost of manual annotation poses a challenge,
hindering the scale of data and the ability of large models to enhance their
effectiveness. Previous pseudo label generation methods heavily rely on
human-labeled captions of the original dataset, limiting scalability and
diversity. To address this, we propose D2AF, a robust annotation framework for
visual grounding using only input images. This approach overcomes dataset size
limitations and enriches both the quantity and diversity of referring
expressions. Our approach leverages multimodal large models and object
detection models. By implementing dual-driven annotation strategies, we
effectively generate detailed region-text pairs using both closed-set and
open-set approaches. We further conduct an in-depth analysis of data quantity
and data distribution. Our findings demonstrate that increasing data volume
enhances model performance. However, the degree of improvement depends on how
well the pseudo labels broaden the original data distribution. Based on these
insights, we propose a consistency and distribution aware filtering method to
further improve data quality by effectively removing erroneous and redundant
data. This approach effectively eliminates noisy data, leading to improved
performance. Experiments on three visual grounding tasks demonstrate that our
method significantly improves the performance of existing models and achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: This paper presents a deep learning-based framework for classifying forestry
operations from dashcam video footage. Focusing on four key work elements -
crane-out, cutting-and-to-processing, driving, and processing - the approach
employs a 3D ResNet-50 architecture implemented with PyTorchVideo. Trained on a
manually annotated dataset of field recordings, the model achieves strong
performance, with a validation F1 score of 0.88 and precision of 0.90. These
results underscore the effectiveness of spatiotemporal convolutional networks
for capturing both motion patterns and appearance in real-world forestry
environments.
  The system integrates standard preprocessing and augmentation techniques to
improve generalization, but overfitting is evident, highlighting the need for
more training data and better class balance. Despite these challenges, the
method demonstrates clear potential for reducing the manual workload associated
with traditional time studies, offering a scalable solution for operational
monitoring and efficiency analysis in forestry.
  This work contributes to the growing application of AI in natural resource
management and sets the foundation for future systems capable of real-time
activity recognition in forest machinery. Planned improvements include dataset
expansion, enhanced regularization, and deployment trials on embedded systems
for in-field use.

Motivation: 细粒度鸟类图像分类（FBIC）在生态监测和物种识别中具有重要意义，但由于鸟类大小、背景干扰和姿态多变等挑战，传统方法难以稳定提取判别性特征。

Method: 提出了一种结合扩展感知聚合器（EPA）和通道语义编织（CSW）的框架，通过整合局部纹理细节与全局结构线索，并在通道维度上自适应融合长距离和短距离信息。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过增强空间感知能力，有效解决了细粒度鸟类分类中的挑战，为实际应用提供了更高的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Abstract: Fine-grained bird image classification (FBIC) is not only of great
significance for ecological monitoring and species identification, but also
holds broad research value in the fields of image recognition and fine-grained
visual modeling. Compared with general image classification tasks, FBIC poses
more formidable challenges: 1) the differences in species size and imaging
distance result in the varying sizes of birds presented in the images; 2)
complex natural habitats often introduce strong background interference; 3) and
highly flexible poses such as flying, perching, or foraging result in
substantial intra-class variability. These factors collectively make it
difficult for traditional methods to stably extract discriminative features,
thereby limiting the generalizability and interpretability of models in
real-world applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a
fine-grained bird classification framework based on strip-aware spatial
perception, which aims to capture long-range spatial dependencies across entire
rows or columns in bird images, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and
interpretability. The proposed method incorporates two novel modules:
extensional perception aggregator (EPA) and channel semantic weaving (CSW).
Specifically, EPA integrates local texture details with global structural cues
by aggregating information across horizontal and vertical spatial directions.
CSW further refines the semantic representations by adaptively fusing
long-range and short-range information along the channel dimension. Built upon
a ResNet-50 backbone, the model enables jump-wise connection of extended
structural features across the spatial domain. Experimental results on the
CUB-200-2011 dataset demonstrate that our framework achieves significant
performance improvements while maintaining architectural efficiency.

*Xianheng Ma,Hongchen Tan,Xiuping Liu,Yi Zhang,Huasheng Wang,Jiang Liu,Ying Chen,Hantao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件相机的长序列行人重识别模型S3CE-Net，利用脉冲神经网络处理异步事件数据，结合空间-时间注意力机制和特征采样策略，实现了高效且低参数的长序列行人重识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在恶劣光照条件下、减少背景干扰、保护面部信息的长序列行人重识别问题。

Method: 基于脉冲神经网络构建S3CE-Net，引入Spike-guided空间-时间注意力机制（SSAM）和空间-时间特征采样策略（STFS）。

Result: 在多个主流数据集上表现出色，验证了模型的高效性和低参数特性。

Conclusion: S3CE-Net是一种高效且低参数的长序列事件行人重识别模型，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we leverage the advantages of event cameras to resist harsh
lighting conditions, reduce background interference, achieve high time
resolution, and protect facial information to study the long-sequence
event-based person re-identification (Re-ID) task. To this end, we propose a
simple and efficient long-sequence event Re-ID model, namely the Spike-guided
Spatiotemporal Semantic Coupling and Expansion Network (S3CE-Net). To better
handle asynchronous event data, we build S3CE-Net based on spiking neural
networks (SNNs). The S3CE-Net incorporates the Spike-guided Spatial-temporal
Attention Mechanism (SSAM) and the Spatiotemporal Feature Sampling Strategy
(STFS). The SSAM is designed to carry out semantic interaction and association
in both spatial and temporal dimensions, leveraging the capabilities of SNNs.
The STFS involves sampling spatial feature subsequences and temporal feature
subsequences from the spatiotemporal dimensions, driving the Re-ID model to
perceive broader and more robust effective semantics. Notably, the STFS
introduces no additional parameters and is only utilized during the training
stage. Therefore, S3CE-Net is a low-parameter and high-efficiency model for
long-sequence event-based person Re-ID. Extensive experiments have verified
that our S3CE-Net achieves outstanding performance on many mainstream
long-sequence event-based person Re-ID datasets. Code is available

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Vision Transformer (ViT)的人脸反欺骗攻击检测方法，利用ViT的中间特征和两种数据增强技术提高检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统容易受到欺骗攻击（如照片攻击），需要一种有效的方法来检测这些攻击。

Method: 使用ViT的中间特征计算训练损失和推理分数，并引入两种数据增强方法：人脸反欺骗数据增强和分块数据增强。

Result: 在OULU-NPU和SiW数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于ViT的方法能够有效检测人脸欺骗攻击，数据增强技术进一步提升了检测精度。

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against changes in head
pose, illumination, and blurring during image capture. If a malicious person
presents a face photo of the registered user, they may bypass the
authentication process illegally. Such spoofing attacks need to be detected
before face recognition. In this paper, we propose a spoofing attack detection
method based on Vision Transformer (ViT) to detect minute differences between
live and spoofed face images. The proposed method utilizes the intermediate
features of ViT, which have a good balance between local and global features
that are important for spoofing attack detection, for calculating loss in
training and score in inference. The proposed method also introduces two data
augmentation methods: face anti-spoofing data augmentation and patch-wise data
augmentation, to improve the accuracy of spoofing attack detection. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments using
the OULU-NPU and SiW datasets.

Result: 在六种图像修复任务上验证，IRBridge有效整合生成先验，提升鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: IRBridge为图像修复提供更灵活、适应性强的解决方案，代码将开源。

Abstract: Bridge models in image restoration construct a diffusion process from
degraded to clear images. However, existing methods typically require training
a bridge model from scratch for each specific type of degradation, resulting in
high computational costs and limited performance. This work aims to efficiently
leverage pretrained generative priors within existing image restoration bridges
to eliminate this requirement. The main challenge is that standard generative
models are typically designed for a diffusion process that starts from pure
noise, while restoration tasks begin with a low-quality image, resulting in a
mismatch in the state distributions between the two processes. To address this
challenge, we propose a transition equation that bridges two diffusion
processes with the same endpoint distribution. Based on this, we introduce the
IRBridge framework, which enables the direct utilization of generative models
within image restoration bridges, offering a more flexible and adaptable
approach to image restoration. Extensive experiments on six image restoration
tasks demonstrate that IRBridge efficiently integrates generative priors,
resulting in improved robustness and generalization performance. Code will be
available at GitHub.

Conclusion: 连续几何表示在3D异常检测和修复中具有显著优势，PASDF为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: 3D point cloud anomaly detection is essential for robust vision systems but
is challenged by pose variations and complex geometric anomalies. Existing
patch-based methods often suffer from geometric fidelity issues due to discrete
voxelization or projection-based representations, limiting fine-grained anomaly
localization. We introduce Pose-Aware Signed Distance Field (PASDF), a novel
framework that integrates 3D anomaly detection and repair by learning a
continuous, pose-invariant shape representation. PASDF leverages a Pose
Alignment Module for canonicalization and a SDF Network to dynamically
incorporate pose, enabling implicit learning of high-fidelity anomaly repair
templates from the continuous SDF. This facilitates precise pixel-level anomaly
localization through an Anomaly-Aware Scoring Module. Crucially, the continuous
3D representation in PASDF extends beyond detection, facilitating in-situ
anomaly repair. Experiments on Real3D-AD and Anomaly-ShapeNet demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving high object-level AUROC scores of 80.2%
and 90.0%, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of
continuous geometric representations in advancing 3D anomaly detection and
facilitating practical anomaly region repair. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2IR基准主要关注整体图像语义或显著前景物体，忽略了复杂环境中不显眼的小物体，而这些在实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 提出SORCE-1K数据集，并利用MLLM和ReP为每张图像生成多个嵌入表示，以更好地捕捉小物体。

Result: 实验表明，多嵌入方法在SORCE-1K上显著优于现有T2IR方法。

Conclusion: SORCE-1K为小物体检索提供了有效基准，多嵌入表示和文本定制的MLLM特征具有潜力解决该任务。

Abstract: Text-to-Image Retrieval (T2IR) is a highly valuable task that aims to match a
given textual query to images in a gallery. Existing benchmarks primarily focus
on textual queries describing overall image semantics or foreground salient
objects, possibly overlooking inconspicuous small objects, especially in
complex environments. Such small object retrieval is crucial, as in real-world
applications, the targets of interest are not always prominent in the image.
Thus, we introduce SORCE (Small Object Retrieval in Complex Environments), a
new subfield of T2IR, focusing on retrieving small objects in complex images
with textual queries. We propose a new benchmark, SORCE-1K, consisting of
images with complex environments and textual queries describing less
conspicuous small objects with minimal contextual cues from other salient
objects. Preliminary analysis on SORCE-1K finds that existing T2IR methods
struggle to capture small objects and encode all the semantics into a single
embedding, leading to poor retrieval performance on SORCE-1K. Therefore, we
propose to represent each image with multiple distinctive embeddings. We
leverage Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to extract multiple
embeddings for each image instructed by a set of Regional Prompts (ReP).
Experimental results show that our multi-embedding approach through MLLM and
ReP significantly outperforms existing T2IR methods on SORCE-1K. Our
experiments validate the effectiveness of SORCE-1K for benchmarking SORCE
performances, highlighting the potential of multi-embedding representation and
text-customized MLLM features for addressing this task.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DAC的新框架，通过利用多个模型对未标记数据的不同偏差预测差异，增强开集半监督学习的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半监督学习假设标记和未标记数据共享相同的类别分布，但实际中未标记数据常包含未知类数据（异常值），导致模型性能下降。现有方法依赖单一模型的预测差异，在标记数据不足时效果不佳。

Method: 通过单一训练过程构建多个不同偏差的模型，利用这些模型对异常值的预测不一致性来识别未知概念。

Result: DAC框架在标记数据不足时仍能有效检测异常值，提升模型鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DAC通过多模型预测差异有效解决了开集半监督学习中的异常值问题，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Conventional semi-supervised learning (SSL) ideally assumes that labeled and
unlabeled data share an identical class distribution, however in practice, this
assumption is easily violated, as unlabeled data often includes unknown class
data, i.e., outliers. The outliers are treated as noise, considerably degrading
the performance of SSL models. To address this drawback, we propose a novel
framework, Diversify and Conquer (DAC), to enhance SSL robustness in the
context of open-set semi-supervised learning. In particular, we note that
existing open-set SSL methods rely on prediction discrepancies between inliers
and outliers from a single model trained on labeled data. This approach can be
easily failed when the labeled data is insufficient, leading to performance
degradation that is worse than naive SSL that do not account for outliers. In
contrast, our approach exploits prediction disagreements among multiple models
that are differently biased towards the unlabeled distribution. By leveraging
the discrepancies arising from training on unlabeled data, our method enables
robust outlier detection even when the labeled data is underspecified. Our key
contribution is constructing a collection of differently biased models through
a single training process. By encouraging divergent heads to be differently
biased towards outliers while making consistent predictions for inliers, we
exploit the disagreement among these heads as a measure to identify unknown
concepts. Our code is available at https://github.com/heejokong/DivCon.

Result: 在SCENEPERSON-13W数据集上验证了框架在复杂场景检索中的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合外观与场景信息的检索方法显著提升了性能，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Text-based person retrieval aims to identify a target individual from a
gallery of images based on a natural language description. It presents a
significant challenge due to the complexity of real-world scenes and the
ambiguity of appearance-related descriptions. Existing methods primarily
emphasize appearance-based cross-modal retrieval, often neglecting the
contextual information embedded within the scene, which can offer valuable
complementary insights for retrieval. To address this, we introduce
SCENEPERSON-13W, a large-scale dataset featuring over 100,000 scenes with rich
annotations covering both pedestrian appearance and environmental cues. Based
on this, we propose SA-Person, a two-stage retrieval framework. In the first
stage, it performs discriminative appearance grounding by aligning textual cues
with pedestrian-specific regions. In the second stage, it introduces
SceneRanker, a training-free, scene-aware re-ranking method leveraging
multimodal large language models to jointly reason over pedestrian appearance
and the global scene context. Experiments on SCENEPERSON-13W validate the
effectiveness of our framework in challenging scene-level retrieval scenarios.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 点云密度、均匀性和精度对分割性能影响显著，需结合数据增强策略提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Transformers have been seldom employed in point cloud roof plane instance
segmentation, which is the focus of this study, and existing superpoint
Transformers suffer from limited performance due to the use of low-quality
superpoints. To address this challenge, we establish two criteria that
high-quality superpoints for Transformers should satisfy and introduce a
corresponding two-stage superpoint generation process. The superpoints
generated by our method not only have accurate boundaries, but also exhibit
consistent geometric sizes and shapes, both of which greatly benefit the
feature learning of superpoint Transformers. To compensate for the limitations
of deep learning features when the training set size is limited, we incorporate
multidimensional handcrafted features into the model. Additionally, we design a
decoder that combines a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network with a Transformer module to
improve instance prediction and mask extraction. Finally, our network's
predictions are refined using traditional algorithm-based postprocessing. For
evaluation, we annotated a real-world dataset and corrected annotation errors
in the existing RoofN3D dataset. Experimental results show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance on our dataset, as well as both the
original and reannotated RoofN3D datasets. Moreover, our model is not sensitive
to plane boundary annotations during training, significantly reducing the
annotation burden. Through comprehensive experiments, we also identified key
factors influencing roof plane segmentation performance: in addition to roof
types, variations in point cloud density, density uniformity, and 3D point
precision have a considerable impact. These findings underscore the importance
of incorporating data augmentation strategies that account for point cloud
quality to enhance model robustness under diverse and challenging conditions.

Result: 实验证明Period-LLM在周期性任务上优于现有MLLMs。

Conclusion: Period-LLM有效解决了周期性任务中的挑战，为跨模态周期性理解提供了新方法。

Abstract: Periodic or quasi-periodic phenomena reveal intrinsic characteristics in
various natural processes, such as weather patterns, movement behaviors,
traffic flows, and biological signals. Given that these phenomena span multiple
modalities, the capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer
promising potential to effectively capture and understand their complex nature.
However, current MLLMs struggle with periodic tasks due to limitations in: 1)
lack of temporal modelling and 2) conflict between short and long periods. This
paper introduces Period-LLM, a multimodal large language model designed to
enhance the performance of periodic tasks across various modalities, and
constructs a benchmark of various difficulty for evaluating the cross-modal
periodic capabilities of large models. Specially, We adopt an "Easy to Hard
Generalization" paradigm, starting with relatively simple text-based tasks and
progressing to more complex visual and multimodal tasks, ensuring that the
model gradually builds robust periodic reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
propose a "Resisting Logical Oblivion" optimization strategy to maintain
periodic reasoning abilities during semantic alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Period-LLM over existing MLLMs in
periodic tasks. The code is available at

Conclusion: ACM-UNet通过适配器机制有效结合CNN和SSM的优势，在医学图像分割任务中表现出色，兼具高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: The U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections has become a
prevailing paradigm in medical image segmentation due to its simplicity and
effectiveness. While many recent works aim to improve this framework by
designing more powerful encoders and decoders, employing advanced convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction, Transformers or state
space models (SSMs) such as Mamba for global context modeling, or hybrid
combinations of both, these methods often struggle to fully utilize pretrained
vision backbones (e.g., ResNet, ViT, VMamba) due to structural mismatches. To
bridge this gap, we introduce ACM-UNet, a general-purpose segmentation
framework that retains a simple UNet-like design while effectively
incorporating pretrained CNNs and Mamba models through a lightweight adapter
mechanism. This adapter resolves architectural incompatibilities and enables
the model to harness the complementary strengths of CNNs and SSMs-namely,
fine-grained local detail extraction and long-range dependency modeling.
Additionally, we propose a hierarchical multi-scale wavelet transform module in
the decoder to enhance feature fusion and reconstruction fidelity. Extensive
experiments on the Synapse and ACDC benchmarks demonstrate that ACM-UNet
achieves state-of-the-art performance while remaining computationally
efficient. Notably, it reaches 85.12% Dice Score and 13.89mm HD95 on the
Synapse dataset with 17.93G FLOPs, showcasing its effectiveness and
scalability. Code is available at: https://github.com/zyklcode/ACM-UNet.

Abstract: Object detection has recently seen an interesting trend in terms of the most
innovative research work, this task being of particular importance in the field
of remote sensing, given the consistency of these images in terms of
geographical coverage and the objects present. Furthermore, Deep Learning (DL)
models, in particular those based on Transformers, are especially relevant for

the present work proposes an application of Deformable-DETR model, a specific
architecture using deformable attention mechanisms, on remote sensing images in
two different modes, especially optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). To
achieve this objective, two datasets are used, one optical, which is Pleiades
Aircraft dataset, and the other SAR, in particular SAR Ship Detection Dataset
(SSDD). The results of a 10-fold stratified validation showed that the proposed
model performed particularly well, obtaining an F1 score of 95.12% for the
optical dataset and 94.54% for SSDD, while comparing these results with several
models detections, especially those based on CNNs and transformers, as well as
those specifically designed to detect different object classes in remote
sensing images.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在生成SVG时缺乏结构有效性、语义忠实性和视觉连贯性，Reason-SVG旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：SFT激活基础推理能力，RL（GRPO）优化生成过程。设计了混合奖励函数评估推理和SVG质量。

Result: Reason-SVG显著提升了LLM生成准确且视觉吸引人的SVG的能力。

Conclusion: Reason-SVG通过整合DwT、SFT和混合奖励RL，为设计领域带来突破性进展。

Abstract: Generating high-quality Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) is challenging for
Large Language Models (LLMs), as it requires advanced reasoning for structural
validity, semantic faithfulness, and visual coherence -- capabilities in which
current LLMs often fall short. In this work, we introduce Reason-SVG, a novel
framework designed to enhance LLM reasoning for SVG generation. Reason-SVG
pioneers the "Drawing-with-Thought" (DwT) paradigm, in which models generate
both SVG code and explicit design rationales, mimicking the human creative
process. Reason-SVG adopts a two-stage training strategy: First, Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) trains the LLM on the DwT paradigm to activate foundational
reasoning abilities. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL), utilizing Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), empowers the model to generate both DwT
and SVGs rationales through refined, reward-driven reasoning. To facilitate
reasoning-driven SVG generation, we design a Hybrid Reward function that
evaluates the presence and utility of DwT reasoning, along with structural
validity, semantic alignment, and visual quality. We also introduce the
SVGX-DwT-10k dataset, a high-quality corpus of 10,000 SVG-DwT pairs, where each
SVG code is generated based on explicit DwT reasoning. By integrating DwT, SFT,
and Hybrid Reward-guided RL, Reason-SVG significantly improves LLM performance
in generating accurate and visually compelling SVGs, potentially fostering "Aha
moments" in design.

*Yinqi Li,Jiahe Zhao,Hong Chang,Ruibing Hou,Shiguang Shan,Xilin Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进CLIP模型的方法un²CLIP，通过利用生成模型unCLIP的能力来捕捉图像细节，从而提升CLIP在密集预测和视觉中心多模态任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在区分图像细节方面表现不足，影响了其在密集预测和视觉中心多模态任务中的性能。因此，本文旨在改进CLIP模型以更好地捕捉图像细节。

Method: 利用生成模型unCLIP（通过反转CLIP图像编码器训练）来改进CLIP模型，提出un²CLIP方法，结合生成模型的细节捕捉能力和CLIP的原始对齐特性。

Result: 实验表明，un²CLIP在多个任务（如MMVP-VLM基准、开放词汇分割任务和多模态大语言模型任务）中显著优于原始CLIP及其他改进方法。

Conclusion: un²CLIP成功提升了CLIP模型的视觉细节捕捉能力，同时保持了其与文本编码器的对齐性，为多模态任务提供了更强大的基础模型。

Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a foundation model
and has been applied to various vision and multimodal tasks. However, recent
works indicate that CLIP falls short in distinguishing detailed differences in
images and shows suboptimal performance on dense-prediction and vision-centric
multimodal tasks. Therefore, this work focuses on improving existing CLIP
models, aiming to capture as many visual details in images as possible. We find
that a specific type of generative models, unCLIP, provides a suitable
framework for achieving our goal. Specifically, unCLIP trains an image
generator conditioned on the CLIP image embedding. In other words, it inverts
the CLIP image encoder. Compared to discriminative models like CLIP, generative
models are better at capturing image details because they are trained to learn
the data distribution of images. Additionally, the conditional input space of
unCLIP aligns with CLIP's original image-text embedding space. Therefore, we
propose to invert unCLIP (dubbed un$^2$CLIP) to improve the CLIP model. In this
way, the improved image encoder can gain unCLIP's visual detail capturing
ability while preserving its alignment with the original text encoder
simultaneously. We evaluate our improved CLIP across various tasks to which
CLIP has been applied, including the challenging MMVP-VLM benchmark, the
dense-prediction open-vocabulary segmentation task, and multimodal large
language model tasks. Experiments show that un$^2$CLIP significantly improves
the original CLIP and previous CLIP improvement methods. Code and models will
be available at https://github.com/LiYinqi/un2CLIP.

Motivation: 针对大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）易受对抗性攻击的问题，提出一种无需重新训练的轻量级防御方案。

Method: 1. 自动屏蔽与文本无关的图像块以破坏对抗性扰动；2. 联合意图分析以发现并缓解潜在有害意图。

Result: 防御成功率从平均52.4%提升至81.7%，实用性仅下降2%，推理开销较低。

Conclusion: 屏蔽和意图分析对实现安全性与实用性的平衡至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce AMIA, a lightweight, inference-only defense for Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) that (1) Automatically Masks a small set of
text-irrelevant image patches to disrupt adversarial perturbations, and (2)
conducts joint Intention Analysis to uncover and mitigate hidden harmful
intents before response generation. Without any retraining, AMIA improves
defense success rates across diverse LVLMs and jailbreak benchmarks from an
average of 52.4% to 81.7%, preserves general utility with only a 2% average
accuracy drop, and incurs only modest inference overhead. Ablation confirms
both masking and intention analysis are essential for a robust safety-utility
trade-off.

TL;DR: 利用扩散模型先验辅助单目几何估计，通过全局坐标系设计和联合训练，提升视频中几何属性的一致性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注单帧几何估计，忽略了扩散模型在帧间一致性上的潜力。本文旨在利用视频生成模型的固有一致性，实现更一致的几何估计。

Method: 1) 选择全局坐标系中与视频帧对应的几何属性；2) 引入重用位置编码的高效条件方法；3) 联合训练共享对应关系的多几何属性。

Result: 在视频全局几何属性预测中表现优异，可直接应用于重建任务，且能泛化至动态视频场景。

Conclusion: 通过适当设计和微调，扩散模型的固有一致性可有效提升几何估计的一致性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recently, methods leveraging diffusion model priors to assist monocular
geometric estimation (e.g., depth and normal) have gained significant attention
due to their strong generalization ability. However, most existing works focus
on estimating geometric properties within the camera coordinate system of
individual video frames, neglecting the inherent ability of diffusion models to
determine inter-frame correspondence. In this work, we demonstrate that,
through appropriate design and fine-tuning, the intrinsic consistency of video
generation models can be effectively harnessed for consistent geometric
estimation. Specifically, we 1) select geometric attributes in the global
coordinate system that share the same correspondence with video frames as the
prediction targets, 2) introduce a novel and efficient conditioning method by
reusing positional encodings, and 3) enhance performance through joint training
on multiple geometric attributes that share the same correspondence. Our
results achieve superior performance in predicting global geometric attributes
in videos and can be directly applied to reconstruction tasks. Even when
trained solely on static video data, our approach exhibits the potential to
generalize to dynamic video scenes.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种加权卷积方法，通过优化密度函数调整邻域像素的贡献，显著提升了卷积神经网络的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积对所有邻域像素一视同仁，而加权卷积通过距离优化像素贡献，以提高近似精度。

Method: 提出加权卷积框架，分离卷积核权重优化（随机梯度下降）和密度函数优化（DIRECT-L）。

Result: 实验显示，加权卷积在图像去噪任务中损失减少53%，测试精度提升，但执行时间增加11%。

Conclusion: 加权卷积在多种超参数下表现稳健，未来将应用于2D和3D图像卷积学习问题。

Abstract: The paper introduces the weighted convolution, a novel approach to the
convolution for signals defined on regular grids (e.g., 2D images) through the
application of an optimal density function to scale the contribution of
neighbouring pixels based on their distance from the central pixel. This choice
differs from the traditional uniform convolution, which treats all neighbouring
pixels equally. Our weighted convolution can be applied to convolutional neural
network problems to improve the approximation accuracy. Given a convolutional
network, we define a framework to compute the optimal density function through
a minimisation model. The framework separates the optimisation of the
convolutional kernel weights (using stochastic gradient descent) from the
optimisation of the density function (using DIRECT-L). Experimental results on
a learning model for an image-to-image task (e.g., image denoising) show that
the weighted convolution significantly reduces the loss (up to 53% improvement)
and increases the test accuracy compared to standard convolution. While this
method increases execution time by 11%, it is robust across several
hyperparameters of the learning model. Future work will apply the weighted
convolution to real-case 2D and 3D image convolutional learning problems.

TL;DR: SustainFM是一个基于17个可持续发展目标的基准框架，用于评估地理空间基础模型（FMs）在可持续发展任务中的表现。研究发现FMs在多数任务中优于传统方法，但需综合考虑准确性、可迁移性和能源效率。

Motivation: 地理空间FMs虽快速发展，但其实际效用与可持续发展目标的契合度尚未充分研究。

Method: 引入SustainFM框架，通过多样化任务（如财富预测和灾害检测）评估FMs。

Result: FMs在多数任务中表现优于传统方法，但需关注可迁移性、泛化能力和能源效率。

Conclusion: 呼吁从模型中心转向影响驱动的部署，强调能源效率、领域适应性和伦理考量。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) are large-scale, pre-trained AI systems that have
revolutionized natural language processing and computer vision, and are now
advancing geospatial analysis and Earth Observation (EO). They promise improved
generalization across tasks, scalability, and efficient adaptation with minimal
labeled data. However, despite the rapid proliferation of geospatial FMs, their
real-world utility and alignment with global sustainability goals remain
underexplored. We introduce SustainFM, a comprehensive benchmarking framework
grounded in the 17 Sustainable Development Goals with extremely diverse tasks
ranging from asset wealth prediction to environmental hazard detection. This
study provides a rigorous, interdisciplinary assessment of geospatial FMs and
offers critical insights into their role in attaining sustainability goals. Our
findings show: (1) While not universally superior, FMs often outperform
traditional approaches across diverse tasks and datasets. (2) Evaluating FMs
should go beyond accuracy to include transferability, generalization, and
energy efficiency as key criteria for their responsible use. (3) FMs enable
scalable, SDG-grounded solutions, offering broad utility for tackling complex
sustainability challenges. Critically, we advocate for a paradigm shift from
model-centric development to impact-driven deployment, and emphasize metrics
such as energy efficiency, robustness to domain shifts, and ethical
considerations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单一视觉编码器难以处理多样化任务领域，导致冲突；直接集成多个编码器又增加复杂性。Mixpert旨在平衡效率和性能。

Method: 采用混合视觉专家架构，结合动态路由机制，为不同视觉任务分配最合适的专家。

Result: Mixpert在多任务学习中显著减少领域冲突，计算成本低，性能优于多编码器方案。

Conclusion: Mixpert高效且兼容性强，可无缝集成到多模态大语言模型中，提升多任务性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require a nuanced interpretation of
complex image information, typically leveraging a vision encoder to perceive
various visual scenarios. However, relying solely on a single vision encoder to
handle diverse task domains proves difficult and inevitably leads to conflicts.
Recent work enhances data perception by directly integrating multiple
domain-specific vision encoders, yet this structure adds complexity and limits
the potential for joint optimization. In this paper, we introduce Mixpert, an
efficient mixture-of-vision-experts architecture that inherits the joint
learning advantages from a single vision encoder while being restructured into
a multi-expert paradigm for task-specific fine-tuning across different visual
tasks. Additionally, we design a dynamic routing mechanism that allocates input
images to the most suitable visual expert. Mixpert effectively alleviates
domain conflicts encountered by a single vision encoder in multi-task learning
with minimal additional computational cost, making it more efficient than
multiple encoders. Furthermore, Mixpert integrates seamlessly into any MLLM,
with experimental results demonstrating substantial performance gains across
various tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积操作对所有邻域像素赋予相同权重，限制了空间特征的差异化提取。通过引入加权卷积，可以更灵活地根据像素位置调整权重，提升特征提取效果。

Method: 提出加权卷积算子，通过预计算密度函数实现高效执行，适用于2D图像、3D体积数据或1D时间序列。在CIFAR-100和DIV2K数据集上评估了分类和去噪任务。

Result: 加权卷积显著提升了性能：VGG分类准确率从56.89%提升至66.94%，DnCNN去噪PSNR从20.17提升至22.63。

Conclusion: 加权卷积是一种高效且通用的改进方法，能够在不增加参数的情况下显著提升CNN性能，适用于多种任务和数据维度。

Abstract: We introduce a novel weighted convolution operator that enhances traditional
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by integrating a spatial density function
into the convolution operator. This extension enables the network to
differentially weight neighbouring pixels based on their relative position to
the reference pixel, improving spatial characterisation and feature extraction.
The proposed operator maintains the same number of trainable parameters and is
fully compatible with existing CNN architectures. Although developed for 2D
image data, the framework is generalisable to signals on regular grids of
arbitrary dimensions, such as 3D volumetric data or 1D time series. We propose
an efficient implementation of the weighted convolution by pre-computing the
density function and achieving execution times comparable to standard
convolution layers. We evaluate our method on two deep learning tasks: image
classification using the CIFAR-100 dataset [KH+09] and image denoising using
the DIV2K dataset [AT17]. Experimental results with state-of-the-art
classification (e.g., VGG [SZ15], ResNet [HZRS16]) and denoising (e.g., DnCNN
[ZZC+17], NAFNet [CCZS22]) methods show that the weighted convolution improves
performance with respect to standard convolution across different quantitative
metrics. For example, VGG achieves an accuracy of 66.94% with weighted
convolution versus 56.89% with standard convolution on the classification
problem, while DnCNN improves the PSNR value from 20.17 to 22.63 on the
denoising problem. All models were trained on the CINECA Leonardo cluster to
reduce the execution time and improve the tuning of the density function
values. The PyTorch implementation of the weighted convolution is publicly
available at: https://github.com/cammarasana123/weightedConvolution2.0.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中标注有限和领域偏移的共存问题未被现有方法单独解决，因此提出MiDSS场景和UST-RUN框架。

Method: UST-RUN框架包括Unified Copy-paste构建中间域、Symmetric GuiDance训练策略、Training Process aware Random Amplitude MixUp，以及高质量伪标签样本选择。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，UST-RUN显著优于基线方法，特别是在Prostate数据集上Dice分数提升了12.94%。

Conclusion: UST-RUN通过有效利用中间域信息和高质量伪标签，成功解决了MiDSS场景下的挑战，为医学图像分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are prevalent challenges in medical
image segmentation. Traditional semi-supervised segmentation and unsupervised
domain adaptation methods address one of these issues separately. However, the
coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift is quite common, which
motivates us to introduce a novel and challenging scenario: Mixed Domain
Semi-supervised medical image Segmentation (MiDSS), where limited labeled data
from a single domain and a large amount of unlabeled data from multiple
domains. To tackle this issue, we propose the UST-RUN framework, which fully
leverages intermediate domain information to facilitate knowledge transfer. We
employ Unified Copy-paste (UCP) to construct intermediate domains, and propose
a Symmetric GuiDance training strategy (SymGD) to supervise unlabeled data by
merging pseudo-labels from intermediate samples. Subsequently, we introduce a
Training Process aware Random Amplitude MixUp (TP-RAM) to progressively
incorporate style-transition components into intermediate samples. To generate
more diverse intermediate samples, we further select reliable samples with
high-quality pseudo-labels, which are then mixed with other unlabeled data.
Additionally, we generate sophisticated intermediate samples with high-quality
pseudo-labels for unreliable samples, ensuring effective knowledge transfer for
them. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority
of UST-RUN. Notably, UST-RUN achieves a 12.94% improvement in Dice score on the
Prostate dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/MQinghe/UST-RUN

Method: 通过合成生成843,622张文档图像，包含6.9亿单词，覆盖十种阿拉伯字体，模拟书籍布局。

Result: SARD提供了干净、可控的训练环境，支持多种OCR模型的基准测试。

Conclusion: SARD是开发和评估鲁棒阿拉伯语OCR及视觉语言模型的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Arabic Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is essential for converting vast
amounts of Arabic print media into digital formats. However, training modern
OCR models, especially powerful vision-language models, is hampered by the lack
of large, diverse, and well-structured datasets that mimic real-world book
layouts. Existing Arabic OCR datasets often focus on isolated words or lines or
are limited in scale, typographic variety, or structural complexity found in
books. To address this significant gap, we introduce SARD (Large-Scale
Synthetic Arabic OCR Dataset). SARD is a massive, synthetically generated
dataset specifically designed to simulate book-style documents. It comprises
843,622 document images containing 690 million words, rendered across ten
distinct Arabic fonts to ensure broad typographic coverage. Unlike datasets
derived from scanned documents, SARD is free from real-world noise and
distortions, offering a clean and controlled environment for model training.
Its synthetic nature provides unparalleled scalability and allows for precise
control over layout and content variation. We detail the dataset's composition
and generation process and provide benchmark results for several OCR models,
including traditional and deep learning approaches, highlighting the challenges
and opportunities presented by this dataset. SARD serves as a valuable resource
for developing and evaluating robust OCR and vision-language models capable of
processing diverse Arabic book-style texts.

Conclusion: GARLIC是一种高效且通用的高维向量空间索引方法，适用于需要快速构建和高准确性的应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce GARLIC (GAussian Representation LearnIng for spaCe
partitioning), a novel indexing structure based on \(N\)-dimensional Gaussians
for efficiently learning high-dimensional vector spaces. Our approach is
inspired from Gaussian splatting techniques, typically used in 3D rendering,
which we adapt for high-dimensional search and classification. We optimize
Gaussian parameters using information-theoretic objectives that balance
coverage, assignment confidence, and structural and semantic consistency. A key
contribution is to progressively refine the representation through split and
clone operations, handling hundreds of dimensions, thus handling varying data
densities. GARLIC offers the fast building times of traditional space
partitioning methods (e.g., under \(\sim5\) min build time for SIFT1M) while
achieving \(\sim50\%\) Recall10@10 in low-candidate regimes. Experimental
results on standard benchmarks demonstrate our method's consistency in (a)
\(k\)-NN retrieval, outperforming methods, such as Faiss-IVF, in fast-recall by
using about half their probes for the same Recall10@10 in Fashion-MNIST, and
(b) in classification tasks, beating by \(\sim15\%\) accuracy other majority
voting methods. Further, we show strong generalization capabilities,
maintaining high accuracy even with downsampled training data: using just
\(1\%\) of the training data returns \(\sim 45\%\) Recall@1, thus making GARLIC
quite powerful for applications requiring both speed and accuracy.

Conclusion: VG LLM证明了直接从视频学习3D信息的可行性，为无需显式3D输入的3D理解任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as
videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such
as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research,
we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and
reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional
3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method, the Video-3D Geometry Large
Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach employs a 3D visual geometry encoder that
extracts 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is
integrated with visual tokens and fed into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have
shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks
related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned
from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit
3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing

Abstract: LiDAR semantic segmentation plays a vital role in autonomous driving.
Existing voxel-based methods for LiDAR semantic segmentation apply uniform
partition to the 3D LiDAR point cloud to form a structured representation based
on cartesian/cylindrical coordinates. Although these methods show impressive
performance, the drawback of existing voxel-based methods remains in two
aspects: (1) it requires a large enough input voxel resolution, which brings a
large amount of computation cost and memory consumption. (2) it does not well
handle the unbalanced point distribution of LiDAR point cloud. In this paper,
we propose a non-uniform cylindrical partition network named NUC-Net to tackle
the above challenges. Specifically, we propose the Arithmetic Progression of
Interval (API) method to non-uniformly partition the radial axis and generate
the voxel representation which is representative and efficient. Moreover, we
propose a non-uniform multi-scale aggregation method to improve contextual
information. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on SemanticKITTI
and nuScenes datasets with much faster speed and much less training time. And
our method can be a general component for LiDAR semantic segmentation, which
significantly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of the uniform
counterpart by $4 \times$ training faster and $2 \times$ GPU memory reduction
and $3 \times$ inference speedup. We further provide theoretical analysis
towards understanding why NUC is effective and how point distribution affects
performance. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业中水果和蔬菜的形状、大小和纹理存在高度类内差异，现有方法依赖实例特定CAD模型或深度传感器，实用性受限。

Method: PLANTPose预测6D姿态和相对于基础网格的变形参数，利用Stable Diffusion增强合成训练图像的真实感。

Result: 在包含不同形状、大小和成熟度香蕉的基准测试中，PLANTPose显著优于现有RGB方法MegaPose。

Conclusion: PLANTPose能有效处理类内差异，实现准确的6D姿态估计，适用于农业等实际场景。

Abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is essential for robotic grasping and
manipulation, particularly in agriculture, where fruits and vegetables exhibit
high intra-class variability in shape, size, and texture. The vast majority of
existing methods rely on instance-specific CAD models or require depth sensors
to resolve geometric ambiguities, making them impractical for real-world
agricultural applications. In this work, we introduce PLANTPose, a novel
framework for category-level 6D pose estimation that operates purely on RGB
input. PLANTPose predicts both the 6D pose and deformation parameters relative
to a base mesh, allowing a single category-level CAD model to adapt to unseen
instances. This enables accurate pose estimation across varying shapes without
relying on instance-specific data. To enhance realism and improve
generalization, we also leverage Stable Diffusion to refine synthetic training
images with realistic texturing, mimicking variations due to ripeness and
environmental factors and bridging the domain gap between synthetic data and
the real world. Our evaluations on a challenging benchmark that includes
bananas of various shapes, sizes, and ripeness status demonstrate the

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力机制和角度编码的新型深度学习模型CAAC，用于更准确地估计云光学厚度（COT），显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统独立像素近似（IPA）方法因简化假设引入偏差，而现有深度学习模型对辐射强度变化和角度敏感，导致误差。

Method: CAAC结合注意力机制和角度嵌入，考虑卫星视角几何和3D辐射传输效应，并采用多角度训练策略确保角度不变性。

Result: 实验表明，CAAC显著优于现有深度学习模型，将云属性检索误差降低至少九倍。

Conclusion: CAAC通过角度不变性和注意力机制，显著提升了COT估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cloud Optical Thickness (COT) is a critical cloud property influencing
Earth's climate, weather, and radiation budget. Satellite radiance measurements
enable global COT retrieval, but challenges like 3D cloud effects, viewing
angles, and atmospheric interference must be addressed to ensure accurate
estimation. Traditionally, the Independent Pixel Approximation (IPA) method,
which treats individual pixels independently, has been used for COT estimation.
However, IPA introduces significant bias due to its simplified assumptions.
Recently, deep learning-based models have shown improved performance over IPA
but lack robustness, as they are sensitive to variations in radiance intensity,
distortions, and cloud shadows. These models also introduce substantial errors
in COT estimation under different solar and viewing zenith angles. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel angle-invariant, attention-based deep
model called Cloud-Attention-Net with Angle Coding (CAAC). Our model leverages
attention mechanisms and angle embeddings to account for satellite viewing
geometry and 3D radiative transfer effects, enabling more accurate retrieval of
COT. Additionally, our multi-angle training strategy ensures angle invariance.
Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that CAAC significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art deep learning models, reducing cloud
property retrieval errors by at least a factor of nine.

*Chengzhi Wu,Qianliang Huang,Kun Jin,Julius Pfrommer,Jürgen Beyerer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比跨分支注意力的点云数据框架（PoCCA），通过子分支实现分支间信息交换，提升了无监督学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习框架仅在损失端进行特征对比，分支间无信息交换，限制了学习效果。

Method: 引入子分支，允许分支间在损失端前交换信息，提升点云表征学习。

Result: 实验表明，无需额外训练数据，PoCCA在下游任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: PoCCA通过分支间信息交换，显著提升了点云无监督学习效果。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is an essential method in self-supervised learning. It
primarily employs a multi-branch strategy to compare latent representations
obtained from different branches and train the encoder. In the case of
multi-modal input, diverse modalities of the same object are fed into distinct
branches. When using single-modal data, the same input undergoes various
augmentations before being fed into different branches. However, all existing
contrastive learning frameworks have so far only performed contrastive
operations on the learned features at the final loss end, with no information
exchange between different branches prior to this stage. In this paper, for
point cloud unsupervised learning without the use of extra training data, we
propose a Contrastive Cross-branch Attention-based framework for Point cloud
data (termed PoCCA), to learn rich 3D point cloud representations. By
introducing sub-branches, PoCCA allows information exchange between different
branches before the loss end. Experimental results demonstrate that in the case
of using no extra training data, the representations learned with our
self-supervised model achieve state-of-the-art performances when used for
downstream tasks on point clouds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多个领域广泛应用，但其不可解释性和幻觉问题（模型生成与视觉内容不符的响应）成为主要挑战。

Method: 采用归一化流理论，提出BIMA方法，通过改进解码过程来减少幻觉。

Result: BIMA在POPE基准测试中平均F1得分为85.06%，CHAIRS和CHAIRI分别降低7.6%和2.6%。

Conclusion: BIMA是首批利用双射方法减少视觉语言模型幻觉的研究之一，效果显著。

Abstract: Large vision-language models have become widely adopted to advance in various
domains. However, developing a trustworthy system with minimal interpretable
characteristics of large-scale models presents a significant challenge. One of
the most prevalent terms associated with the fallacy functions caused by these
systems is hallucination, where the language model generates a response that
does not correspond to the visual content. To mitigate this problem, several
approaches have been developed, and one prominent direction is to ameliorate
the decoding process. In this paper, we propose a new Bijective Maximum
Likelihood Learning (BIMA) approach to hallucination mitigation using
normalizing flow theories. The proposed BIMA method can efficiently mitigate
the hallucination problem in prevailing vision-language models, resulting in
significant improvements. Notably, BIMA achieves the average F1 score of 85.06%
on POPE benchmark and remarkably reduce CHAIRS and CHAIRI by 7.6% and 2.6%,
respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies
that contemplates the bijection means to reduce hallucination induced by large
vision-language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决半监督医学图像分割中因EMA机制导致的过耦合问题以及Dual Students结构中的认知偏差问题。

Method: 采用动态竞争机制更新EMA，实现学生与教师的解耦，并促进学生间精确知识的交换。

Result: 在2D和3D数据集上验证了DCF的优越性，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DCF有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Confronting the critical challenge of insufficiently annotated samples in
medical domain, semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) emerges as a
promising solution. Specifically, most methodologies following the Mean Teacher
(MT) or Dual Students (DS) architecture have achieved commendable results.
However, to date, these approaches face a performance bottleneck due to two
inherent limitations, \textit{e.g.}, the over-coupling problem within MT
structure owing to the employment of exponential moving average (EMA)
mechanism, as well as the severe cognitive bias between two students of DS
structure, both of which potentially lead to reduced efficacy, or even model
collapse eventually. To mitigate these issues, a Decoupled Competitive
Framework (DCF) is elaborated in this work, which utilizes a straightforward
competition mechanism for the update of EMA, effectively decoupling students
and teachers in a dynamical manner. In addition, the seamless exchange of
invaluable and precise insights is facilitated among students, guaranteeing a
better learning paradigm. The DCF introduced undergoes rigorous validation on
three publicly accessible datasets, which encompass both 2D and 3D datasets.
The results demonstrate the superiority of our method over previous
cutting-edge competitors. Code will be available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在制造领域，利用先验知识可以改进6D姿态估计，尤其是针对螺栓的自动拆卸任务。遮挡和单视角数据限制增加了任务的复杂性。

Method: 设计了一个多阶段管道，结合先验知识，获取完整的螺栓6D姿态信息。

Result: 管道成功捕捉了所有螺栓的6D信息，展示了先验知识在复杂任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅推动了6D姿态估计领域的发展，还证明了领域特定知识在制造和自动化中的实用性。

Abstract: The accurate estimation of 6D pose remains a challenging task within the
computer vision domain, even when utilizing 3D point cloud data. Conversely, in
the manufacturing domain, instances arise where leveraging prior knowledge can
yield advancements in this endeavor. This study focuses on the disassembly of
starter motors to augment the engineering of product life cycles. A pivotal
objective in this context involves the identification and 6D pose estimation of
bolts affixed to the motors, facilitating automated disassembly within the
manufacturing workflow. Complicating matters, the presence of occlusions and
the limitations of single-view data acquisition, notably when motors are placed
in a clamping system, obscure certain portions and render some bolts
imperceptible. Consequently, the development of a comprehensive pipeline
capable of acquiring complete bolt information is imperative to avoid oversight
in bolt detection. In this paper, employing the task of bolt detection within
the scope of our project as a pertinent use case, we introduce a meticulously
devised pipeline. This multi-stage pipeline effectively captures the 6D
information with regard to all bolts on the motor, thereby showcasing the
effective utilization of prior knowledge in handling this challenging task. The
proposed methodology not only contributes to the field of 6D pose estimation
but also underscores the viability of integrating domain-specific insights to
tackle complex problems in manufacturing and automation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Facial Basis的新编码系统，替代FACS用于面部行为分析，解决了FACS在自动化检测中的局限性，并在自闭症诊断中表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FACS编码过程耗时且成本高，且检测精度不足，无法全面表达面部表情。因此，作者提出了一种新的数据驱动编码系统。

Method: 构建了Facial Basis系统，通过无监督方法捕捉局部化和可解释的3D面部运动，克服了FACS的三大结构限制。

Result: Facial Basis在预测自闭症诊断中优于常用AU检测器，证明了全面编码面部行为的重要性。

Conclusion: Facial Basis是首个替代FACS的系统，能够全面分解视频中的面部表情，并提供了开源实现。

Abstract: The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) has been used by numerous studies to
investigate the links between facial behavior and mental health. The laborious
and costly process of FACS coding has motivated the development of machine
learning frameworks for Action Unit (AU) detection. Despite intense efforts
spanning three decades, the detection accuracy for many AUs is considered to be
below the threshold needed for behavioral research. Also, many AUs are excluded
altogether, making it impossible to fulfill the ultimate goal of FACS-the
representation of any facial expression in its entirety. This paper considers
an alternative approach. Instead of creating automated tools that mimic FACS
experts, we propose to use a new coding system that mimics the key properties
of FACS. Specifically, we construct a data-driven coding system called the
Facial Basis, which contains units that correspond to localized and
interpretable 3D facial movements, and overcomes three structural limitations
of automated FACS coding. First, the proposed method is completely
unsupervised, bypassing costly, laborious and variable manual annotation.
Second, Facial Basis reconstructs all observable movement, rather than relying
on a limited repertoire of recognizable movements (as in automated FACS).
Finally, the Facial Basis units are additive, whereas AUs may fail detection
when they appear in a non-additive combination. The proposed method outperforms
the most frequently used AU detector in predicting autism diagnosis from
in-person and remote conversations, highlighting the importance of encoding
facial behavior comprehensively. To our knowledge, Facial Basis is the first
alternative to FACS for deconstructing facial expressions in videos into
localized movements. We provide an open source implementation of the method at
github.com/sariyanidi/FacialBasis.

Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型在下游任务中表现出强大的适应性和泛化能力，但其可靠性和不确定性尚未得到充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用分形预测框架，结合最优传输（Conf-OT）方法，解决预训练域与任务域之间的差异，无需额外数据分割。

Result: 在15个数据集和三种非一致性评分上的实验表明，Conf-OT将集合效率相对提升了20%，且速度比现有方法快15倍。

Conclusion: Conf-OT通过最优传输有效解决了域漂移问题，显著提升了分形预测的效率，同时保持了覆盖保证。

Abstract: Vision-language models pre-trained at large scale have shown unprecedented
adaptability and generalization to downstream tasks. Although its
discriminative potential has been widely explored, its reliability and
uncertainty are still overlooked. In this work, we investigate the capabilities
of CLIP models under the split conformal prediction paradigm, which provides
theoretical guarantees to black-box models based on a small, labeled
calibration set. In contrast to the main body of literature on conformal
predictors in vision classifiers, foundation models exhibit a particular
characteristic: they are pre-trained on a one-time basis on an inaccessible
source domain, different from the transferred task. This domain drift
negatively affects the efficiency of the conformal sets and poses additional
challenges. To alleviate this issue, we propose Conf-OT, a transfer learning
setting that operates transductive over the combined calibration and query
sets. Solving an optimal transport problem, the proposed method bridges the
domain gap between pre-training and adaptation without requiring additional
data splits but still maintaining coverage guarantees. We comprehensively
explore this conformal prediction strategy on a broad span of 15 datasets and
three non-conformity scores. Conf-OT provides consistent relative improvements
of up to 20% on set efficiency while being 15 times faster than popular
transductive approaches.

Conclusion: RT-X Net通过多模态融合有效提升夜间图像质量，V-TIEE数据集为相关研究提供支持。

Abstract: In nighttime conditions, high noise levels and bright illumination sources
degrade image quality, making low-light image enhancement challenging. Thermal
images provide complementary information, offering richer textures and
structural details. We propose RT-X Net, a cross-attention network that fuses
RGB and thermal images for nighttime image enhancement. We leverage
self-attention networks for feature extraction and a cross-attention mechanism
for fusion to effectively integrate information from both modalities. To
support research in this domain, we introduce the Visible-Thermal Image
Enhancement Evaluation (V-TIEE) dataset, comprising 50 co-located visible and

Conclusion: TW-GRPO通过优化推理聚焦和奖励设计，显著提升了多模态任务的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning, particularly through Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved multimodal
large language models for complex reasoning tasks. However, two critical
limitations persist: 1) they often produce unfocused, verbose reasoning chains
that obscure salient spatiotemporal cues and 2) binary rewarding fails to
account for partially correct answers, resulting in high reward variance and
inefficient learning. In this paper, we propose TW-GRPO, a novel framework that
enhances visual reasoning with focused thinking and dense reward granularity.
Specifically, we employs a token weighting mechanism that prioritizes tokens
with high informational density (estimated by intra-group variance),
suppressing redundant tokens like generic reasoning prefixes. Furthermore, we
reformulate RL training by shifting from single-choice to multi-choice QA
tasks, where soft rewards enable finer-grained gradient estimation by
distinguishing partial correctness. Additionally, we propose question-answer
inversion, a data augmentation strategy to generate diverse multi-choice
samples from existing benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance on several video reasoning and general understanding benchmarks.
Notably, TW-GRPO achieves 50.4\% accuracy on CLEVRER (18.8\% improvement over
Video-R1) and 65.8\% on MMVU. Our codes are available at

Conclusion: DreamDance有效且通用，适用于复杂动画需求。

Abstract: This paper presents DreamDance, a novel character art animation framework
capable of producing stable, consistent character and scene motion conditioned
on precise camera trajectories. To achieve this, we re-formulate the animation
task as two inpainting-based steps: Camera-aware Scene Inpainting and
Pose-aware Video Inpainting. The first step leverages a pre-trained image
inpainting model to generate multi-view scene images from the reference art and
optimizes a stable large-scale Gaussian field, which enables coarse background
video rendering with camera trajectories. However, the rendered video is rough
and only conveys scene motion. To resolve this, the second step trains a
pose-aware video inpainting model that injects the dynamic character into the
scene video while enhancing background quality. Specifically, this model is a
DiT-based video generation model with a gating strategy that adaptively
integrates the character's appearance and pose information into the base
background video. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of DreamDance, producing high-quality and
consistent character animations with remarkable camera dynamics.

Motivation: 现有方法将2D语义特征简单投影到3D高斯上，忽略了视角依赖语义问题，即3D对象在不同视角下可能表现出不同的语义。

Method: LaGa通过分解3D场景为对象，聚类语义描述符，并根据多视角语义重新加权，构建视图聚合的语义表示。

Result: 在相同设置下，LaGa在LERF-OVS数据集上比之前的最佳方法提升了18.7%的mIoU。

Conclusion: LaGa有效捕捉了视角依赖语义的关键信息，实现了更全面的3D场景理解。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) enable high-quality 3D
scene reconstruction from RGB images. Many studies extend this paradigm for
language-driven open-vocabulary scene understanding. However, most of them
simply project 2D semantic features onto 3D Gaussians and overlook a
fundamental gap between 2D and 3D understanding: a 3D object may exhibit
various semantics from different viewpoints--a phenomenon we term
view-dependent semantics. To address this challenge, we propose LaGa (Language
Gaussians), which establishes cross-view semantic connections by decomposing
the 3D scene into objects. Then, it constructs view-aggregated semantic
representations by clustering semantic descriptors and reweighting them based
on multi-view semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaGa
effectively captures key information from view-dependent semantics, enabling a
more comprehensive understanding of 3D scenes. Notably, under the same
settings, LaGa achieves a significant improvement of +18.7% mIoU over the
previous SOTA on the LERF-OVS dataset. Our code is available at:

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) generation have enabled models to
produce high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, these models
often struggle with complex instructions involving multiple objects,
attributes, and spatial relationships. Existing benchmarks for evaluating T2I
models primarily focus on general text-image alignment and fail to capture the
nuanced requirements of complex, multi-faceted prompts. Given this gap, we
introduce LongBench-T2I, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to
evaluate T2I models under complex instructions. LongBench-T2I consists of 500
intricately designed prompts spanning nine diverse visual evaluation
dimensions, enabling a thorough assessment of a model's ability to follow
complex instructions. Beyond benchmarking, we propose an agent framework
(Plan2Gen) that facilitates complex instruction-driven image generation without
requiring additional model training. This framework integrates seamlessly with
existing T2I models, using large language models to interpret and decompose
complex prompts, thereby guiding the generation process more effectively. As
existing evaluation metrics, such as CLIPScore, fail to adequately capture the
nuances of complex instructions, we introduce an evaluation toolkit that
automates the quality assessment of generated images using a set of
multi-dimensional metrics. The data and code are released at

Conclusion: 该模型为优化结直肠癌检测提供了高效解决方案，通过先进图像分析减少侵入性检查的局限性。

Abstract: Traditional diagnostic methods like colonoscopy are invasive yet critical
tools necessary for accurately diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC). Detection of
CRC at early stages is crucial for increasing patient survival rates. However,
colonoscopy is dependent on obtaining adequate and high-quality endoscopic
images. Prolonged invasive procedures are inherently risky for patients, while
suboptimal or insufficient images hamper diagnostic accuracy. These images,
typically derived from video frames, often exhibit similar patterns, posing
challenges in discrimination. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel
Deep Learning network built on a Few-Shot Learning architecture, which includes
a tailored feature extractor, task interpolation, relational embedding, and a
bi-level routing attention mechanism. The Few-Shot Learning paradigm enables
our model to rapidly adapt to unseen fine-grained endoscopic image patterns,
and the task interpolation augments the insufficient images artificially from
varied instrument viewpoints. Our relational embedding approach discerns
critical intra-image features and captures inter-image transitions between
consecutive endoscopic frames, overcoming the limitations of Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). The integration of a light-weight attention mechanism
ensures a concentrated analysis of pertinent image regions. By training on
diverse datasets, the model's generalizability and robustness are notably
improved for handling endoscopic images. Evaluated on Kvasir dataset, our model
demonstrated superior performance, achieving an accuracy of 90.1\%, precision
of 0.845, recall of 0.942, and an F1 score of 0.891. This surpasses current
state-of-the-art methods, presenting a promising solution to the challenges of
invasive colonoscopy by optimizing CRC detection through advanced image
analysis.

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to learn new classes sequentially while
retaining the knowledge of previously learned classes. Recently, pre-trained
models (PTMs) combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) have shown
remarkable performance in rehearsal-free CIL without requiring exemplars from
previous tasks. However, existing adapter-based methods, which incorporate
lightweight learnable modules into PTMs for CIL, create new adapters for each
new task, leading to both parameter redundancy and failure to leverage shared
knowledge across tasks. In this work, we propose ContinuaL Low-Rank Adaptation
(CL-LoRA), which introduces a novel dual-adapter architecture combining
\textbf{task-shared adapters} to learn cross-task knowledge and
\textbf{task-specific adapters} to capture unique features of each new task.
Specifically, the shared adapters utilize random orthogonal matrices and
leverage knowledge distillation with gradient reassignment to preserve
essential shared knowledge. In addition, we introduce learnable block-wise
weights for task-specific adapters, which mitigate inter-task interference
while maintaining the model's plasticity. We demonstrate CL-LoRA consistently
achieves promising performance under multiple benchmarks with reduced training
and inference computation, establishing a more efficient and scalable paradigm
for continual learning with pre-trained models.

Abstract: Historical maps offer an invaluable perspective into territory evolution
across past centuries--long before satellite or remote sensing technologies
existed. Deep learning methods have shown promising results in segmenting
historical maps, but publicly available datasets typically focus on a single
map type or period, require extensive and costly annotations, and are not
suited for nationwide, long-term analyses. In this paper, we introduce a new
dataset of historical maps tailored for analyzing large-scale, long-term land
use and land cover evolution with limited annotations. Spanning metropolitan
France (548,305 km^2), our dataset contains three map collections from the
18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. We provide both comprehensive modern labels and
22,878 km^2 of manually annotated historical labels for the 18th and 19th
century maps. Our dataset illustrates the complexity of the segmentation task,
featuring stylistic inconsistencies, interpretive ambiguities, and significant
landscape changes (e.g., marshlands disappearing in favor of forests). We
assess the difficulty of these challenges by benchmarking three approaches: a
fully-supervised model trained with historical labels, and two
weakly-supervised models that rely only on modern annotations. The latter
either use the modern labels directly or first perform image-to-image
translation to address the stylistic gap between historical and contemporary
maps. Finally, we discuss how these methods can support long-term environment
monitoring, offering insights into centuries of landscape transformation. Our
official project repository is publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于对比范式的分层多粒度图像-文本对齐框架（Hi-GITA），用于中文字符识别，显著提升了零样本识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中文字符具有独特的空间结构和组合规则，现有方法通常依赖单级字符表示，未能充分利用细粒度语义信息。

Method: 设计了图像和文本的多粒度编码器，并引入多粒度融合模块和细粒度解耦图像-文本对比损失。

Result: 实验表明，Hi-GITA显著优于现有零样本方法，例如在手写字符和部首零样本设置中提升了20%的准确率。

Conclusion: Hi-GITA框架通过多粒度表示和对比学习，有效提升了中文字符识别的性能。

Abstract: Chinese Character Recognition (CCR) is a fundamental technology for
intelligent document processing. Unlike Latin characters, Chinese characters
exhibit unique spatial structures and compositional rules, allowing for the use
of fine-grained semantic information in representation. However, existing
approaches are usually based on auto-regressive as well as edit distance
post-process and typically rely on a single-level character representation. In
this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Multi-Granularity Image-Text Aligning
(Hi-GITA) framework based on a contrastive paradigm. To leverage the abundant
fine-grained semantic information of Chinese characters, we propose
multi-granularity encoders on both image and text sides. Specifically, the
Image Multi-Granularity Encoder extracts hierarchical image representations
from character images, capturing semantic cues from localized strokes to
holistic structures. The Text Multi-Granularity Encoder extracts stroke and
radical sequence representations at different levels of granularity. To better
capture the relationships between strokes and radicals, we introduce
Multi-Granularity Fusion Modules on the image and text sides, respectively.
Furthermore, to effectively bridge the two modalities, we further introduce a
Fine-Grained Decoupled Image-Text Contrastive loss, which aligns image and text
representations across multiple granularities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed Hi-GITA significantly outperforms existing
zero-shot CCR methods. For instance, it brings about 20% accuracy improvement
in handwritten character and radical zero-shot settings. Code and models will
be released soon.

TL;DR: VideoCAD是一个大规模合成数据集，用于学习CAD操作的UI交互，支持长时程任务和复杂工程需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI驱动的UI代理数据集和方法无法满足专业工程工具的高复杂度需求。

Method: 通过自动化框架生成41K标注视频，提出VideoCADFormer模型学习CAD交互。

Result: VideoCADFormer优于基线模型，揭示了视频UI理解中的关键挑战。

Conclusion: VideoCAD为工程UI交互学习和多模态LLM评估提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a time-consuming and complex process,
requiring precise, long-horizon user interactions with intricate 3D interfaces.
While recent advances in AI-driven user interface (UI) agents show promise,
most existing datasets and methods focus on short, low-complexity tasks in
mobile or web applications, failing to capture the demands of professional
engineering tools. In this work, we introduce VideoCAD, the first attempt at
engineering UI interaction learning for precision tasks. Specifically, VideoCAD
is a large-scale synthetic dataset consisting of over 41K annotated video
recordings of CAD operations, generated using an automated framework for
collecting high-fidelity UI action data from human-made CAD designs. Compared
to existing datasets, VideoCAD offers an order of magnitude higher complexity
in UI interaction learning for real-world engineering tasks, having up to a 20x
longer time horizon than other datasets. We show two important downstream
applications of VideoCAD: learning UI interactions from professional precision
3D CAD tools and a visual question-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to
evaluate multimodal large language models' (LLM) spatial reasoning and video
understanding abilities. To learn the UI interactions, we propose
VideoCADFormer - a state-of-the-art model in learning CAD interactions directly
from video, which outperforms multiple behavior cloning baselines. Both
VideoCADFormer and the VQA benchmark derived from VideoCAD reveal key
challenges in the current state of video-based UI understanding, including the
need for precise action grounding, multi-modal and spatial reasoning, and
long-horizon dependencies.

### [268] [Vision LLMs Are Bad at Hierarchical Visual Understanding, and LLMs Are the Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24840)
*Yuwen Tan,Yuan Qing,Boqing Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，许多先进的大语言模型（LLMs）缺乏对视觉世界的层次知识，甚至不了解基本的生物分类学，这限制了视觉LLMs的层次视觉理解能力。通过构建约100万道四选一视觉问答任务，研究证实了这一点，并发现微调视觉LLM后，LLMs的层次一致性提升更多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示LLMs在视觉层次知识上的不足，探讨其对视觉LLMs理解能力的限制。

Method: 使用约100万道基于六种分类学和四种图像数据集的四选一视觉问答任务，对LLMs和视觉LLMs进行测试和微调。

Result: LLMs的层次知识不足成为视觉LLMs的瓶颈，微调后LLMs的层次一致性提升更显著。

Conclusion: 视觉LLMs的完全层次理解需以LLMs具备相应分类学知识为前提。

Abstract: This paper reveals that many state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs)
lack hierarchical knowledge about our visual world, unaware of even
well-established biology taxonomies. This shortcoming makes LLMs a bottleneck
for vision LLMs' hierarchical visual understanding (e.g., recognizing Anemone
Fish but not Vertebrate). We arrive at these findings using about one million
four-choice visual question answering (VQA) tasks constructed from six
taxonomies and four image datasets. Interestingly, finetuning a vision LLM
using our VQA tasks reaffirms LLMs' bottleneck effect to some extent because
the VQA tasks improve the LLM's hierarchical consistency more than the vision
LLM's. We conjecture that one cannot make vision LLMs understand visual
concepts fully hierarchical until LLMs possess corresponding taxonomy
knowledge.

Abstract: To enable egocentric contextual AI in always-on smart glasses, it is crucial
to be able to keep a record of the user's interactions with the world,
including during reading. In this paper, we introduce a new task of reading
recognition to determine when the user is reading. We first introduce the
first-of-its-kind large-scale multimodal Reading in the Wild dataset,
containing 100 hours of reading and non-reading videos in diverse and realistic
scenarios. We then identify three modalities (egocentric RGB, eye gaze, head
pose) that can be used to solve the task, and present a flexible transformer
model that performs the task using these modalities, either individually or
combined. We show that these modalities are relevant and complementary to the
task, and investigate how to efficiently and effectively encode each modality.
Additionally, we show the usefulness of this dataset towards classifying types
of reading, extending current reading understanding studies conducted in
constrained settings to larger scale, diversity and realism. Code, model, and
data will be public.

test models' ability to maintain character consistency. Additionally, it
includes complex plots and intricate world-building to challenge models in
generating accurate visuals. To ensure comprehensive comparisons, our benchmark
incorporates a wide range of evaluation metrics assessing critical aspects.
This structured and multifaceted framework enables researchers to thoroughly
identify both the strengths and weaknesses of different models, fostering
targeted improvements.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of talking-head deepfake generation fueled by advanced

However, current benchmarks for deepfake talking-head detection fail to reflect

characteristics. We benchmark a diverse set of existing detection methods,
including CNNs, vision transformers, and temporal models, and analyze their
robustness and generalization capabilities. In addition, we provide error
analysis using Grad-CAM visualizations to expose common failure modes and
detector biases. TalkingHeadBench is hosted on

Motivation: 当前VLMs在空间信息被遮挡时无法捕捉纯时间模式，需解决这一局限性以提升模型能力。

Method: 通过SpookyBench基准测试，评估VLMs在噪声帧序列中的表现，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 人类准确率超98%，而VLMs为0%，显示模型对时间线索的提取能力不足。

Conclusion: 需开发新架构或训练范式，减少对空间特征的依赖，提升时间模式识别能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made impressive strides
in understanding spatio-temporal relationships in videos. However, when spatial
information is obscured, these models struggle to capture purely temporal
patterns. We introduce $\textbf{SpookyBench}$, a benchmark where information is
encoded solely in temporal sequences of noise-like frames, mirroring natural
phenomena from biological signaling to covert communication. Interestingly,
while humans can recognize shapes, text, and patterns in these sequences with
over 98% accuracy, state-of-the-art VLMs achieve 0% accuracy. This performance
gap highlights a critical limitation: an over-reliance on frame-level spatial
features and an inability to extract meaning from temporal cues. Furthermore,
when trained in data sets with low spatial signal-to-noise ratios (SNR),
temporal understanding of models degrades more rapidly than human perception,
especially in tasks requiring fine-grained temporal reasoning. Overcoming this
limitation will require novel architectures or training paradigms that decouple
spatial dependencies from temporal processing. Our systematic analysis shows
that this issue persists across model scales and architectures. We release
SpookyBench to catalyze research in temporal pattern recognition and bridge the
gap between human and machine video understanding. Dataset and code has been
made available on our project website: https://timeblindness.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在复杂视频语言任务中的推理能力显著落后于纯语言模型，需要一种有效的方法来提升其表现。

Method: SiLVR将视频理解分为两阶段：1) 将原始视频转换为基于语言的多感官表示（如短片段字幕和音频/语音字幕）；2) 将这些语言描述输入强大的推理LLM完成任务。采用自适应令牌减少方案处理长上下文多感官输入。

Result: SiLVR在多个视频语言任务（如Video-MME、Video-MMMU等）上取得了最佳报告结果，并验证了强推理LLM能有效聚合多感官信息。

Conclusion: SiLVR框架简单、模块化且无需训练，显著提升了多模态LLM在复杂视频推理任务中的能力，展示了语言模型在多感官信息处理中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in test-time optimization have led to remarkable reasoning
capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to solve highly
complex problems in math and coding. However, the reasoning capabilities of
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) still significantly lag, especially for complex
video-language tasks. To address this issue, we present SiLVR, a Simple
Language-based Video Reasoning framework that decomposes complex video
understanding into two stages. In the first stage, SiLVR transforms raw video
into language-based representations using multisensory inputs, such as short
clip captions and audio/speech subtitles. In the second stage, language
descriptions are fed into a powerful reasoning LLM to solve complex
video-language understanding tasks. To handle long-context multisensory inputs,
we use an adaptive token reduction scheme, which dynamically determines the
temporal granularity with which to sample the tokens. Our simple, modular, and
training-free video reasoning framework achieves the best-reported results on
Video-MME (long), Video-MMMU (comprehension), Video-MMLU, CGBench, and EgoLife.
Furthermore, our empirical study focused on video reasoning capabilities shows
that, despite not being explicitly trained on video, strong reasoning LLMs can
effectively aggregate multisensory input information from video, speech, and
audio for complex temporal, causal, long-context, and knowledge acquisition
reasoning tasks in video. Code is available at https://github.com/CeeZh/SILVR.

Result: AI模型能生成视觉吸引人的图像，但在对象放置、关系和测量等3D细节上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 总结了当前图像生成模型在空间感知上的三大局限，为改进空间智能提供了方向。

Abstract: Humans can intuitively compose and arrange scenes in the 3D space for
photography. However, can advanced AI image generators plan scenes with similar
3D spatial awareness when creating images from text or image prompts? We
present GenSpace, a novel benchmark and evaluation pipeline to comprehensively
assess the spatial awareness of current image generation models. Furthermore,
standard evaluations using general Vision-Language Models (VLMs) frequently
fail to capture the detailed spatial errors. To handle this challenge, we
propose a specialized evaluation pipeline and metric, which reconstructs 3D
scene geometry using multiple visual foundation models and provides a more
accurate and human-aligned metric of spatial faithfulness. Our findings show
that while AI models create visually appealing images and can follow general
instructions, they struggle with specific 3D details like object placement,
relationships, and measurements. We summarize three core limitations in the
spatial perception of current state-of-the-art image generation models: 1)
Object Perspective Understanding, 2) Egocentric-Allocentric Transformation and
3) Metric Measurement Adherence, highlighting possible directions for improving
spatial intelligence in image generation.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a powerful paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), achieving
state-of-the-art performance on tasks with structured, verifiable answers.
Applying RLVR to Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) presents significant opportunities but
is complicated by the broader, heterogeneous nature of vision-language tasks
that demand nuanced visual, logical, and spatial capabilities. As such,
training MLLMs using RLVR on multiple datasets could be beneficial but creates
challenges with conflicting objectives from interaction among diverse datasets,
highlighting the need for optimal dataset mixture strategies to improve
generalization and reasoning. We introduce a systematic post-training framework
for Multimodal LLM RLVR, featuring a rigorous data mixture problem formulation
and benchmark implementation. Specifically, (1) We developed a multimodal RLVR
framework for multi-dataset post-training by curating a dataset that contains
different verifiable vision-language problems and enabling multi-domain online
RL learning with different verifiable rewards; (2) We proposed a data mixture
strategy that learns to predict the RL fine-tuning outcome from the data
mixture distribution, and consequently optimizes the best mixture.
Comprehensive experiments showcase that multi-domain RLVR training, when
combined with mixture prediction strategies, can significantly boost MLLM
general reasoning capacities. Our best mixture improves the post-trained
model's accuracy on out-of-distribution benchmarks by an average of 5.24%
compared to the same model post-trained with uniform data mixture, and by a
total of 20.74% compared to the pre-finetuning baseline.

Motivation: 尽管强化微调（RFT）能提升视觉语言模型的推理能力，但其计算成本高昂，限制了模型规模的扩展。

Method: 通过从RFT推理器的输出分布中减去基础模型的输出分布，ProxyThinker修改解码动态，激发慢思考行为（如自我验证和修正）。

Result: ProxyThinker在空间、数学和多学科推理等视觉基准测试中显著提升性能，推理速度比现有方法快38倍。

Conclusion: ProxyThinker为大型模型的实用部署提供了高效解决方案，无需额外训练即可实现高性能推理。

Abstract: Recent advancements in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have
pushed the boundaries of the visual reasoning capabilities in large
vision-language models (LVLMs). However, training LVLMs with reinforcement
fine-tuning (RFT) is computationally expensive, posing a significant challenge
to scaling model size. In this work, we propose ProxyThinker, an inference-time
technique that enables large models to inherit the visual reasoning
capabilities from small, slow-thinking visual reasoners without any training.
By subtracting the output distributions of base models from those of RFT
reasoners, ProxyThinker modifies the decoding dynamics and successfully elicits
the slow-thinking reasoning demonstrated by the emerged sophisticated behaviors
such as self-verification and self-correction. ProxyThinker consistently boosts
performance on challenging visual benchmarks on spatial, mathematical, and
multi-disciplinary reasoning, enabling untuned base models to compete with the
performance of their full-scale RFT counterparts. Furthermore, our
implementation efficiently coordinates multiple language models with
parallelism techniques and achieves up to 38 $\times$ faster inference compared
to previous decoding-time methods, paving the way for the practical deployment
of ProxyThinker. Code is available at

Motivation: 视频对象移除是视频编辑的关键子任务，但现有方法存在幻觉对象、视觉伪影和计算成本高的问题。

Method: 第一阶段移除文本输入和交叉注意力层，简化模型；第二阶段通过极小极大优化策略训练模型，提高编辑质量和推理速度。

Result: 方法在仅6次采样步骤下实现了最先进的视频对象移除效果，且不依赖CFG，显著提升了推理效率。

Conclusion: MiniMax-Remover在视频对象移除任务中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have driven rapid progress in video
editing techniques. However, video object removal, a critical subtask of video
editing, remains challenging due to issues such as hallucinated objects and
visual artifacts. Furthermore, existing methods often rely on computationally
expensive sampling procedures and classifier-free guidance (CFG), resulting in
slow inference. To address these limitations, we propose MiniMax-Remover, a
novel two-stage video object removal approach. Motivated by the observation
that text condition is not best suited for this task, we simplify the
pretrained video generation model by removing textual input and cross-attention
layers, resulting in a more lightweight and efficient model architecture in the
first stage. In the second stage, we distilled our remover on successful videos
produced by the stage-1 model and curated by human annotators, using a minimax
optimization strategy to further improve editing quality and inference speed.
Specifically, the inner maximization identifies adversarial input noise ("bad
noise") that makes failure removals, while the outer minimization step trains
the model to generate high-quality removal results even under such challenging
conditions. As a result, our method achieves a state-of-the-art video object
removal results with as few as 6 sampling steps and doesn't rely on CFG,
significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness and superiority of MiniMax-Remover compared to existing
methods. Codes and Videos are available at: https://minimax-remover.github.io.

generating images, We automatically generate and release a corpus of model
crafted rationales paired with visual prompts, enabling controlled planning of
object layouts, styles, and scene compositions. Our GRPO algorithm uses reward
signals from a pretrained vision language model to assess overall visual
quality, optimizing the policy in each update. Evaluations on GenEval, DPG, and
the T2I benchmark demonstrate that ReasonGen-R1 consistently outperforms strong
baselines and prior state-of-the-art models. More: aka.ms/reasongen.

TL;DR: Agent-X是一个大规模基准测试，用于评估视觉中心代理在真实世界多模态环境中的多步骤深度推理能力，揭示了当前模型在多步骤视觉任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常局限于合成、单轮查询和单一视觉模态，缺乏评估多步骤推理质量的框架。

Method: 引入Agent-X基准测试，包含828个任务，涵盖多种视觉环境和工具使用，并提出细粒度、步骤级评估框架。

Result: 即使最佳模型（如GPT、Gemini和Qwen系列）在多步骤视觉任务中的成功率也低于50%。

Conclusion: Agent-X揭示了当前LMM推理和工具使用能力的关键瓶颈，为未来视觉中心代理推理模型的研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Deep reasoning is fundamental for solving complex tasks, especially in
vision-centric scenarios that demand sequential, multimodal understanding.
However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate agents with fully synthetic,
single-turn queries, limited visual modalities, and lack a framework to assess
reasoning quality over multiple steps as required in real-world settings. To
address this, we introduce Agent-X, a large-scale benchmark for evaluating
vision-centric agents multi-step and deep reasoning capabilities in real-world,
multimodal settings. Agent- X features 828 agentic tasks with authentic visual
contexts, including images, multi-image comparisons, videos, and instructional
text. These tasks span six major agentic environments: general visual
reasoning, web browsing, security and surveillance, autonomous driving, sports,
and math reasoning. Our benchmark requires agents to integrate tool use with
explicit, stepwise decision-making in these diverse settings. In addition, we
propose a fine-grained, step-level evaluation framework that assesses the
correctness and logical coherence of each reasoning step and the effectiveness
of tool usage throughout the task. Our results reveal that even the
best-performing models, including GPT, Gemini, and Qwen families, struggle to
solve multi-step vision tasks, achieving less than 50% full-chain success.
These findings highlight key bottlenecks in current LMM reasoning and tool-use
capabilities and identify future research directions in vision-centric agentic
reasoning models. Our data and code are publicly available at

Abstract: Existing methods for image-to-3D avatar generation struggle to produce highly
detailed, animation-ready avatars suitable for real-world applications. We
introduce AdaHuman, a novel framework that generates high-fidelity animatable
3D avatars from a single in-the-wild image. AdaHuman incorporates two key
innovations: (1) A pose-conditioned 3D joint diffusion model that synthesizes
consistent multi-view images in arbitrary poses alongside corresponding 3D
Gaussian Splats (3DGS) reconstruction at each diffusion step; (2) A
compositional 3DGS refinement module that enhances the details of local body
parts through image-to-image refinement and seamlessly integrates them using a
novel crop-aware camera ray map, producing a cohesive detailed 3D avatar. These
components allow AdaHuman to generate highly realistic standardized A-pose
avatars with minimal self-occlusion, enabling rigging and animation with any
input motion. Extensive evaluation on public benchmarks and in-the-wild images
demonstrates that AdaHuman significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in both avatar reconstruction and reposing. Code and models will be publicly
available for research purposes.

Result: 提出的注意力模块在心脏MRI重建任务中超越了当前最先进的参数免费方法。

Conclusion: 生态学原理可以指导设计高效且有效的注意力机制，为医学影像任务提供新思路。

Abstract: Attention is a fundamental component of the human visual recognition system.
The inclusion of attention in a convolutional neural network amplifies relevant
visual features and suppresses the less important ones. Integrating attention
mechanisms into convolutional neural networks enhances model performance and
interpretability. Spatial and channel attention mechanisms have shown
significant advantages across many downstream tasks in medical imaging. While
existing attention modules have proven to be effective, their design often
lacks a robust theoretical underpinning. In this study, we address this gap by
proposing a non-linear attention architecture for cardiac MRI reconstruction
and hypothesize that insights from ecological principles can guide the
development of effective and efficient attention mechanisms. Specifically, we
investigate a non-linear ecological difference equation that describes
single-species population growth to devise a parameter-free attention module
surpassing current state-of-the-art parameter-free methods.

Motivation: MRI中的运动伪影会影响神经解剖学指标的准确性，而现有方法依赖硬件或噪声数据，缺乏客观性。

Method: 使用合成损坏的3D体积训练3D卷积神经网络，评估运动严重程度。

Result: 在独立数据集验证中，与人工评分的相关性达到R²=0.65，并在12/15数据集中显著相关。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于不同扫描仪和协议，为结构MRI研究提供了客观、可扩展的运动评估方案。

Abstract: Motion-related artifacts are inevitable in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and can bias automated neuroanatomical metrics such as cortical thickness.
Manual review cannot objectively quantify motion in anatomical scans, and
existing automated approaches often require specialized hardware or rely on
unbalanced noisy training data. Here, we train a 3D convolutional neural
network to estimate motion severity using only synthetically corrupted volumes.
We validate our method with one held-out site from our training cohort and with
14 fully independent datasets, including one with manual ratings, achieving a
representative $R^2 = 0.65$ versus manual labels and significant
thickness-motion correlations in 12/15 datasets. Furthermore, our predicted
motion correlates with subject age in line with prior studies. Our approach
generalizes across scanner brands and protocols, enabling objective, scalable
motion assessment in structural MRI studies without prospective motion
correction.

Result: 在fastMRI数据集上，新方法有效减少伪影和噪声放大，优于现有自监督方法。

Conclusion: 提出的训练策略显著提升了高加速率MRI重建的可靠性和图像质量。

Abstract: Physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) models have proven to be a powerful
approach for improved reconstruction of rapid MRI scans. In order to train
these models in scenarios where fully-sampled reference data is unavailable,
self-supervised learning has gained prominence. However, its application at
high acceleration rates frequently introduces artifacts, compromising image
fidelity. To mitigate this shortcoming, we propose a novel way to train PD-DL
networks via carefully-designed perturbations. In particular, we enhance the
k-space masking idea of conventional self-supervised learning with a novel
consistency term that assesses the model's ability to accurately predict the
added perturbations in a sparse domain, leading to more reliable and
artifact-free reconstructions. The results obtained from the fastMRI knee and
brain datasets show that the proposed training strategy effectively reduces
aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification at high acceleration
rates, outperforming state-of-the-art self-supervised methods both visually and
quantitatively.

Abstract: Medical image challenges have played a transformative role in advancing the
field, catalyzing algorithmic innovation and establishing new performance
standards across diverse clinical applications. Image registration, a
foundational task in neuroimaging pipelines, has similarly benefited from the
Learn2Reg initiative. Building on this foundation, we introduce the Large-scale
Unsupervised Brain MRI Image Registration (LUMIR) challenge, a next-generation
benchmark designed to assess and advance unsupervised brain MRI registration.
Distinct from prior challenges that leveraged anatomical label maps for
supervision, LUMIR removes this dependency by providing over 4,000 preprocessed
T1-weighted brain MRIs for training without any label maps, encouraging
biologically plausible deformation modeling through self-supervision. In
addition to evaluating performance on 590 held-out test subjects, LUMIR
introduces a rigorous suite of zero-shot generalization tasks, spanning
out-of-domain imaging modalities (e.g., FLAIR, T2-weighted, T2*-weighted),
disease populations (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), acquisition protocols (e.g.,
9.4T MRI), and species (e.g., macaque brains). A total of 1,158 subjects and
over 4,000 image pairs were included for evaluation. Performance was assessed
using both segmentation-based metrics (Dice coefficient, 95th percentile
Hausdorff distance) and landmark-based registration accuracy (target
registration error). Across both in-domain and zero-shot tasks, deep
learning-based methods consistently achieved state-of-the-art accuracy while
producing anatomically plausible deformation fields. The top-performing deep
learning-based models demonstrated diffeomorphic properties and inverse
consistency, outperforming several leading optimization-based methods, and
showing strong robustness to most domain shifts, the exception being a drop in
performance on out-of-domain contrasts.

Motivation: 虽然PCI手术通常依赖2D XRA，但3D CTA能提供更精确的血管解剖信息。结合两者的优势需要解决多模态图像配准的挑战，如几何差异、对比度和噪声问题。

Method: 方法包括两部分：1) XRA和CTA图像的预处理；2) 基于Steger和超像素粒子群优化算法的特征提取配准模块。

Result: 在28对XRA和CTA图像上的实验表明，该方法在配准精度、鲁棒性和效率上均优于四种现有技术。

Conclusion: 该算法显著提升了PCI手术的临床效果，为冠状动脉疾病的治疗提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) is a minimally invasive procedure
that improves coronary blood flow and treats coronary artery disease. Although
PCI typically requires 2D X-ray angiography (XRA) to guide catheter placement
at real-time, computed tomography angiography (CTA) may substantially improve
PCI by providing precise information of 3D vascular anatomy and status. To
leverage real-time XRA and detailed 3D CTA anatomy for PCI, accurate multimodal
image registration of XRA and CTA is required, to guide the procedure and avoid
complications. This is a challenging process as it requires registration of
images from different geometrical modalities (2D -> 3D and vice versa), with
variations in contrast and noise levels. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal coronary artery image registration method based on a swarm
optimization algorithm, which effectively addresses challenges such as large
deformations, low contrast, and noise across these imaging modalities. Our
algorithm consists of two main modules: 1) preprocessing of XRA and CTA images
separately, and 2) a registration module based on feature extraction using the
Steger and Superpixel Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms. Our technique was
evaluated on a pilot dataset of 28 pairs of XRA and CTA images from 10 patients
who underwent PCI. The algorithm was compared with four state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods in terms of registration accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. Our
method outperformed the selected SOTA baselines in all aspects. Experimental
results demonstrate the significant effectiveness of our algorithm, surpassing
the previous benchmarks and proposes a novel clinical approach that can
potentially have merit for improving patient outcomes in coronary artery
disease.

TL;DR: FrENet是一种针对RAW图像去模糊的频率增强网络，通过在频域操作和自适应频率位置调制模块，显著提升了去模糊效果和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法主要关注sRGB图像，而RAW图像因其未处理和线性特性具有更好的恢复潜力，但研究不足。

Method: 提出FrENet框架，直接在频域操作，引入自适应频率位置调制模块和频域跳跃连接。

Result: FrENet在RAW图像去模糊上优于现有方法，恢复质量更高且计算效率更高，同时可扩展至sRGB图像。

Conclusion: FrENet为RAW图像去模糊提供了高效解决方案，并展示了在sRGB图像上的潜力。

Abstract: Image deblurring plays a crucial role in enhancing visual clarity across
various applications. Although most deep learning approaches primarily focus on
sRGB images, which inherently lose critical information during the image signal
processing pipeline, RAW images, being unprocessed and linear, possess superior
restoration potential but remain underexplored. Deblurring RAW images presents
unique challenges, particularly in handling frequency-dependent blur while
maintaining computational efficiency. To address these issues, we propose
Frequency Enhanced Network (FrENet), a framework specifically designed for
RAW-to-RAW deblurring that operates directly in the frequency domain. We
introduce a novel Adaptive Frequency Positional Modulation module, which
dynamically adjusts frequency components according to their spectral positions,
thereby enabling precise control over the deblurring process. Additionally,
frequency domain skip connections are adopted to further preserve
high-frequency details. Experimental results demonstrate that FrENet surpasses
state-of-the-art deblurring methods in RAW image deblurring, achieving
significantly better restoration quality while maintaining high efficiency in
terms of reduced MACs. Furthermore, FrENet's adaptability enables it to be
extended to sRGB images, where it delivers comparable or superior performance
compared to methods specifically designed for sRGB data. The code will be
available at https://github.com/WenlongJiao/FrENet .

Motivation: 解决3D医学影像中数据稀缺、协议差异和模型泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出MEAL框架，利用四种增强变体和三种融合策略（CC、FL、BD）构建多编码器模型，保留增强感知特征。

Result: MEAL-BD在CT到MRI翻译任务中表现最优，PSNR和SSIM评分高于其他方法。

Conclusion: MEAL通过增强多样性提升模型鲁棒性，为临床可靠的医学影像解决方案提供支持。

Abstract: Medical imaging is critical for diagnostics, but clinical adoption of
advanced AI-driven imaging faces challenges due to patient variability, image
artifacts, and limited model generalization. While deep learning has
transformed image analysis, 3D medical imaging still suffers from data scarcity
and inconsistencies due to acquisition protocols, scanner differences, and
patient motion. Traditional augmentation uses a single pipeline for all
transformations, disregarding the unique traits of each augmentation and
struggling with large data volumes.
  To address these challenges, we propose a Multi-encoder Augmentation-Aware
Learning (MEAL) framework that leverages four distinct augmentation variants
processed through dedicated encoders. Three fusion strategies such as
concatenation (CC), fusion layer (FL), and adaptive controller block (BD) are
integrated to build multi-encoder models that combine augmentation-specific
features before decoding. MEAL-BD uniquely preserves augmentation-aware
representations, enabling robust, protocol-invariant feature learning.
  As demonstrated in a Computed Tomography (CT)-to-T1-weighted Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) translation study, MEAL-BD consistently achieved the
best performance on both unseen- and predefined-test data. On both geometric
transformations (like rotations and flips) and non-augmented inputs, MEAL-BD
outperformed other competing methods, achieving higher mean peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM)
scores. These results establish MEAL as a reliable framework for preserving
structural fidelity and generalizing across clinically relevant variability. By
reframing augmentation as a source of diverse, generalizable features, MEAL
supports robust, protocol-invariant learning, advancing clinically reliable
medical imaging solutions.

Conclusion: 提出的框架在联合空间-光谱超分辨率任务中表现优异，代码将开源。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing a high-resolution
hyperspectral image from a low-resolution multispectral observation. While
spatial super-resolution and spectral super-resolution have been extensively
studied, joint spatio-spectral super-resolution remains relatively explored. We
propose an end-to-end model-driven framework that explicitly decomposes the
joint spatio-spectral super-resolution problem into spatial super-resolution,
spectral super-resolution and fusion tasks. Each sub-task is addressed by
unfolding a variational-based approach, where the operators involved in the
proximal gradient iterative scheme are replaced with tailored learnable
modules. In particular, we design an upsampling operator for spatial
super-resolution based on classical back-projection algorithms, adapted to
handle arbitrary scaling factors. Spectral reconstruction is performed using
learnable cluster-based upsampling and downsampling operators. For image
fusion, we integrate low-frequency estimation and high-frequency injection
modules to combine the spatial and spectral information from spatial
super-resolution and spectral super-resolution outputs. Additionally, we
introduce an efficient nonlocal post-processing step that leverages image
self-similarity by combining a multi-head attention mechanism with residual
connections. Extensive evaluations on several datasets and sampling factors
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The source code will be

Result: 实验表明，TumorGen在计算效率和边界真实性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TumorGen为AI驱动的癌症诊断提供了高效且真实的肿瘤合成解决方案。

Abstract: Tumor data synthesis offers a promising solution to the shortage of annotated
medical datasets. However, current approaches either limit tumor diversity by
using predefined masks or employ computationally expensive two-stage processes
with multiple denoising steps, causing computational inefficiency.
Additionally, these methods typically rely on binary masks that fail to capture
the gradual transitions characteristic of tumor boundaries. We present
TumorGen, a novel Boundary-Aware Tumor-Mask Synthesis with Rectified Flow
Matching for efficient 3D tumor synthesis with three key components: a
Boundary-Aware Pseudo Mask Generation module that replaces strict binary masks
with flexible bounding boxes; a Spatial-Constraint Vector Field Estimator that
simultaneously synthesizes tumor latents and masks using rectified flow
matching to ensure computational efficiency; and a VAE-guided mask refiner that
enhances boundary realism. TumorGen significantly improves computational
efficiency by requiring fewer sampling steps while maintaining pathological
accuracy through coarse and fine-grained spatial constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate TumorGen's superior performance over existing tumor
synthesis methods in both efficiency and realism, offering a valuable
contribution to AI-driven cancer diagnostics.

Conclusion: 首次系统利用多回波T2*加权MRI进行胎盘分割，为定量分析提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate placental segmentation is essential for quantitative analysis of the
placenta. However, this task is particularly challenging in T2*-weighted
placental imaging due to: (1) weak and inconsistent boundary contrast across
individual echoes; (2) the absence of manual ground truth annotations for all
echo times; and (3) motion artifacts across echoes caused by fetal and maternal
movement. In this work, we propose a contrast-augmented segmentation framework
that leverages complementary information across multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI to
learn robust, contrast-invariant representations. Our method integrates: (i)
masked autoencoding (MAE) for self-supervised pretraining on unlabeled
multi-echo slices; (ii) masked pseudo-labeling (MPL) for unsupervised domain
adaptation across echo times; and (iii) global-local collaboration to align
fine-grained features with global anatomical context. We further introduce a
semantic matching loss to encourage representation consistency across echoes of
the same subject. Experiments on a clinical multi-echo placental MRI dataset
demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively across echo times and
outperforms both single-echo and naive fusion baselines. To our knowledge, this
is the first work to systematically exploit multi-echo T2*-weighted MRI for
placental segmentation.

Conclusion: SEN4X有效提升了卫星图像分辨率，为小尺度特征识别提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Super-resolution aims to increase the resolution of satellite images by
reconstructing high-frequency details, which go beyond na\"ive upsampling. This
has particular relevance for Earth observation missions like Sentinel-2, which
offer frequent, regular coverage at no cost; but at coarse resolution. Its
pixel footprint is too large to capture small features like houses, streets, or
hedge rows. To address this, we present SEN4X, a hybrid super-resolution
architecture that combines the advantages of single-image and multi-image
techniques. It combines temporal oversampling from repeated Sentinel-2
acquisitions with a learned prior from high-resolution Pl\'eiades Neo data. In
doing so, SEN4X upgrades Sentinel-2 imagery to 2.5 m ground sampling distance.
We test the super-resolved images on urban land-cover classification in Hanoi,
Vietnam. We find that they lead to a significant performance improvement over
state-of-the-art super-resolution baselines.

Motivation: 畴壁动态行为在铁电材料中具有强烈的空间依赖性，传统方法难以高效研究稀疏的钉扎中心和畴壁，因此需要自动化高分辨率技术。

Method: 使用机器学习控制的自动化压电力显微镜技术，分析了1500个开关事件，量化了电场驱动的极应变畴结构动态行为。

Abstract: Domain-wall dynamics in ferroelectric materials are strongly
position-dependent since each polar interface is locked into a unique local
microstructure. This necessitates spatially resolved studies of the
wall-pinning using scanning-probe microscopy techniques. The pinning centers
and preexisting domain walls are usually sparse within image plane, precluding
the use of dense hyperspectral imaging modes and requiring time-consuming human
experimentation. Here, a large area epitaxial PbTiO$_3$ film on cubic KTaO$_3$
were investigated to quantify the electric field driven dynamics of the
polar-strain domain structures using ML-controlled automated Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy. Analysis of 1500 switching events reveals that domain wall
displacement depends not only on field parameters but also on the local
ferroelectric-ferroelastic configuration. For example, twin boundaries in
polydomains regions like a$_1^-$/$c^+$ $\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stay pinned up
to a certain level of bias magnitude and change only marginally as the bias
increases from 20V to 30V, whereas single variant boundaries like a$_2^+$/$c^+$
$\parallel$ a$_2^-$/$c^-$ stack are already activated at 20V. These statistics
on the possible ferroelectric and ferroelastic wall orientations, together with
the automated, high-throughput AFM workflow, can be distilled into a predictive
map that links domain configurations to pulse parameters. This
microstructure-specific rule set forms the foundation for designing
ferroelectric memories.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体LLM系统易受对抗性和低性能智能体影响，需增强其鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，该系统能有效减少对抗性影响，提升多智能体协作的韧性。

Conclusion: 可信度评分框架显著增强了多智能体LLM系统的抗干扰能力。

Abstract: While multi-agent LLM systems show strong capabilities in various domains,
they are highly vulnerable to adversarial and low-performing agents. To resolve
this issue, in this paper, we introduce a general and adversary-resistant
multi-agent LLM framework based on credibility scoring. We model the
collaborative query-answering process as an iterative game, where the agents
communicate and contribute to a final system output. Our system associates a
credibility score that is used when aggregating the team outputs. The
credibility scores are learned gradually based on the past contributions of
each agent in query answering. Our experiments across multiple tasks and
settings demonstrate our system's effectiveness in mitigating adversarial
influence and enhancing the resilience of multi-agent cooperation, even in the
adversary-majority settings.

Motivation: 现有语音基础模型在微调时资源有限，导致性能不足，需改进多语言任务表现。

Method: 采用冻结上游训练、部分微调、低秩适应等策略，结合数据增强和CTC损失正则化。

Result: 在ML-SUPERB 2.0上，语言识别准确率相对提升14%，语音识别CER相对降低30%。

Abstract: Multilingual speech processing with self-supervised or supervised pre-trained
Speech Foundation Models (SFM) has achieved strong performance on tasks like
Language Identification (LID) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However,
these models struggle with limited resources during fine-tuning. This paper
enhances multilingual LID and ASR on ML-SUPERB 2.0 by exploring multiple
strategies for adapting SFMs, including frozen upstream training, partial
fine-tuning, and low-rank adaptation. Furthermore, we employ data augmentation
to mitigate performance gaps in few-shot settings and introduce LID
Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss for regularization. Our
approach achieves a 14% relative improvement in LID accuracy and a 30% relative
reduction in ASR CER over the baseline on ML-SUPERB 2.0, securing second place
in the Interspeech 2025 ML-SUPERB 2.0 Challenge.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于数字孪生体模的方法，用于定量评估光声图像重建算法的质量，并通过实验验证了一种傅里叶变换重建算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 光声图像重建算法的质量评估缺乏有效的定量方法，尤其是在体内或体模研究中缺乏理想参考图像。

Method: 使用数字孪生体模和成像系统进行定量校准，比较多种先进重建算法，并首次在实验数据中测试傅里叶变换重建算法。

Result: 数字孪生体模有效评估了数值前向模型的准确性，傅里叶变换算法在计算成本较低的情况下性能与迭代时间反转相当。

Conclusion: 数字孪生框架为光声图像重建算法的质量评估提供了新途径，傅里叶变换算法具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantitative comparison of the quality of photoacoustic image reconstruction
algorithms remains a major challenge. No-reference image quality measures are
often inadequate, but full-reference measures require access to an ideal
reference image. While the ground truth is known in simulations, it is unknown
in vivo, or in phantom studies, as the reference depends on both the phantom
properties and the imaging system. We tackle this problem by using numerical
digital twins of tissue-mimicking phantoms and the imaging system to perform a
quantitative calibration to reduce the simulation gap. The contributions of
this paper are two-fold: First, we use this digital-twin framework to compare
multiple state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Second, among these is a
Fourier transform-based reconstruction algorithm for circular detection
geometries, which we test on experimental data for the first time. Our results
demonstrate the usefulness of digital phantom twins by enabling assessment of
the accuracy of the numerical forward model and enabling comparison of image
reconstruction schemes with full-reference image quality assessment. We show
that the Fourier transform-based algorithm yields results comparable to those
of iterative time reversal, but at a lower computational cost. All data and
code are publicly available on Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15388429.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需训练的KG-RAG路由框架，通过检索评分分布判断查询难度，平衡性能与成本，实验显示可减少50%对大模型的调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型推理成本高，现有KG-RAG方法因检索大量知识进一步增加成本，需要一种高效的路由方法。

Method: 基于检索评分分布与查询难度的相关性，提出无需训练的路由框架，动态分配查询至不同规模的LLM。

Result: 实验证明该方法可减少50%对大模型的调用，且不影响响应质量。

Conclusion: 该框架为KG-RAG提供了一种高效、可扩展的部署方案。

Abstract: Large language models excel at many tasks but often incur high inference
costs during deployment. To mitigate hallucination, many systems use a
knowledge graph to enhance retrieval-augmented generation (KG-RAG). However,
the large amount of retrieved knowledge contexts increase these inference costs
further. A promising solution to balance performance and cost is LLM routing,
which directs simple queries to smaller LLMs and complex ones to larger LLMs.
However, no dedicated routing methods currently exist for RAG, and existing
training-based routers face challenges scaling to this domain due to the need
for extensive training data. We observe that the score distributions produced
by the retrieval scorer strongly correlate with query difficulty. Based on
this, we propose a novel, training-free routing framework, the first tailored
to KG-RAG that effectively balances performance and cost in a plug-and-play
manner. Experiments show our method reduces calls to larger LLMs by up to 50%
without sacrificing response quality, demonstrating its potential for efficient
and scalable LLM deployment.

Abstract: Crowd work platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk and Prolific are vital for

Researchers face compromised data validity as AI responses replace authentic

AI models that emulate workers' behaviors and preferences while keeping humans

in-depth interviews with crowd workers (n=5) and social science researchers

TL;DR: WikiGap系统通过多语言信息差距发现方法和用户中心设计，在英文维基百科界面中展示其他语言版本的补充信息，显著提升信息查找效率和用户意识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 英文维基百科在全球知识获取中占主导地位，但其他语言版本包含的文化和媒体环境相关的补充信息被边缘化。现有系统未明确展示这些信息。

Method: 结合多语言信息差距发现方法和用户中心设计，开发WikiGap系统，支持从法、俄、中文维基百科获取补充信息。

Result: 混合方法研究（n=21）显示，WikiGap显著提高事实查找准确性，减少任务时间，并获得更高可用性评分。

Conclusion: WikiGap提升了用户对其他语言版本补充信息的意识，推动了跨语言版本的知识公平性。

Abstract: With more than 11 times as many pageviews as the next, English Wikipedia
dominates global knowledge access relative to other language editions. Readers
are prone to assuming English Wikipedia as a superset of all language editions,
leading many to prefer it even when their primary language is not English.
Other language editions, however, comprise complementary facts rooted in their
respective cultures and media environments, which are marginalized in English
Wikipedia. While Wikipedia's user interface enables switching between language
editions through its Interlanguage Link (ILL) system, it does not reveal to
readers that other language editions contain valuable, complementary
information. We present WikiGap, a system that surfaces complementary facts
sourced from other Wikipedias within the English Wikipedia interface.
Specifically, by combining a recent multilingual information-gap discovery
method with a user-centered design, WikiGap enables access to complementary
information from French, Russian, and Chinese Wikipedia. In a mixed-methods
study (n=21), WikiGap significantly improved fact-finding accuracy, reduced
task time, and received a 32-point higher usability score relative to
Wikipedia's current ILL-based navigation system. Participants reported
increased awareness of the availability of complementary information in
non-English editions and reconsidered the completeness of English Wikipedia.
WikiGap thus paves the way for improved epistemic equity across language
editions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTT方法因小批量更新效率低，难以处理长上下文数据。

Method: 采用大块更新（LaCT），提高硬件利用率，支持复杂优化器。

Result: 在多种任务中验证有效性，包括14B参数视频扩散模型和100万令牌上下文。

Conclusion: LaCT为长上下文建模和测试时训练提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Test-Time Training (TTT) models context dependencies by adapting part of the
model's weights (referred to as fast weights) during inference. This fast
weight, akin to recurrent states in RNNs, stores temporary memories of past
tokens in the current sequence. Existing TTT methods struggled to show
effectiveness in handling long-context data, due to their inefficiency on
modern GPUs. The TTT layers in many of these approaches operate with extremely
low FLOPs utilization (often <5%) because they deliberately apply small online
minibatch sizes (e.g., updating fast weights every 16 or 64 tokens). Moreover,
a small minibatch implies fine-grained block-wise causal dependencies in the
data, unsuitable for data beyond 1D ordered sequences, like sets or
N-dimensional grids such as images or videos. In contrast, we pursue the
opposite direction by using an extremely large chunk update, ranging from 2K to
1M tokens across tasks of varying modalities, which we refer to as Large Chunk
Test-Time Training (LaCT). It improves hardware utilization by orders of
magnitude, and more importantly, facilitates scaling of nonlinear state size
(up to 40% of model parameters), hence substantially improving state capacity,
all without requiring cumbersome and error-prone kernel implementations. It
also allows easy integration of sophisticated optimizers, e.g. Muon for online
updates. We validate our approach across diverse modalities and tasks,
including novel view synthesis with image set, language models, and
auto-regressive video diffusion. Our approach can scale up to 14B-parameter AR
video diffusion model on sequences up to 56K tokens. In our longest sequence
experiment, we perform novel view synthesis with 1 million context length. We
hope this work will inspire and accelerate new research in the field of
long-context modeling and test-time training. Website:

Motivation: 测试VLMs在视觉任务中因先验知识导致的偏差，揭示其失败模式。

Method: 通过7个领域的实验（如动物、标志、棋盘等），测试VLMs的计数和识别能力，并插入文本干扰。

Result: VLMs表现严重偏差，准确率仅17.05%，且干扰文本进一步降低性能。

Conclusion: VLMs存在显著偏差，需改进框架以减少知识干扰。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) memorize a vast amount of prior knowledge from
the Internet that help them on downstream tasks but also may notoriously sway
their outputs towards wrong or biased answers. In this work, we test how the
knowledge about popular subjects hurt the accuracy of vision language models
(VLMs) on standard, objective visual tasks of counting and identification. We
find that state-of-the-art VLMs are strongly biased (e.g, unable to recognize a
fourth stripe has been added to a 3-stripe Adidas logo) scoring an average of
17.05% accuracy in counting (e.g., counting stripes in an Adidas-like logo)
across 7 diverse domains from animals, logos, chess, board games, optical
illusions, to patterned grids. Insert text (e.g., "Adidas") describing the
subject name into the counterfactual image further decreases VLM accuracy. The
biases in VLMs are so strong that instructing them to double-check their
results or rely exclusively on image details to answer improves counting
accuracy by only +2 points, on average. Our work presents an interesting
failure mode in VLMs and an automated framework for testing VLM biases. Code

Method: 设计了首个系统性研究，涵盖4种LVMs、8种成像方法、18个数据集和26个基线模型，涵盖分类和预测任务。

Result: LVMs在时间序列分类中表现良好，但在预测任务中受限，且存在特定模型和成像方法的偏好。

Conclusion: LVMs在时间序列分析中有潜力，但需进一步研究解决预测任务的局限性。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have gained increasing attention in time series
research, driving interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) and foundation
models for time series analysis. As the field moves toward multi-modality,
Large Vision Models (LVMs) are emerging as a promising direction. In the past,
the effectiveness of Transformer and LLMs in time series has been debated. When
it comes to LVMs, a similar question arises: are LVMs truely useful for time
series analysis? To address it, we design and conduct the first principled
study involving 4 LVMs, 8 imaging methods, 18 datasets and 26 baselines across
both high-level (classification) and low-level (forecasting) tasks, with
extensive ablation analysis. Our findings indicate LVMs are indeed useful for
time series classification but face challenges in forecasting. Although
effective, the contemporary best LVM forecasters are limited to specific types
of LVMs and imaging methods, exhibit a bias toward forecasting periods, and
have limited ability to utilize long look-back windows. We hope our findings
could serve as a cornerstone for future research on LVM- and multimodal-based
solutions to different time series tasks.

Result: Proxy-FDA显著减少了概念遗忘，并在多种微调设置和任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Proxy-FDA通过结构知识保留和动态代理，有效解决了微调中的概念遗忘问题。

Abstract: Vision foundation models pre-trained on massive data encode rich
representations of real-world concepts, which can be adapted to downstream
tasks by fine-tuning. However, fine-tuning foundation models on one task often
leads to the issue of concept forgetting on other tasks. Recent methods of
robust fine-tuning aim to mitigate forgetting of prior knowledge without
affecting the fine-tuning performance. Knowledge is often preserved by matching
the original and fine-tuned model weights or feature pairs. However, such
point-wise matching can be too strong, without explicit awareness of the
feature neighborhood structures that encode rich knowledge as well. We propose
a novel regularization method Proxy-FDA that explicitly preserves the
structural knowledge in feature space. Proxy-FDA performs Feature Distribution
Alignment (using nearest neighbor graphs) between the pre-trained and
fine-tuned feature spaces, and the alignment is further improved by informative
proxies that are generated dynamically to increase data diversity. Experiments
show that Proxy-FDA significantly reduces concept forgetting during
fine-tuning, and we find a strong correlation between forgetting and a
distributional distance metric (in comparison to L2 distance). We further
demonstrate Proxy-FDA's benefits in various fine-tuning settings (end-to-end,
few-shot and continual tuning) and across different tasks like image
classification, captioning and VQA.

<details>

Motivation: 现有联邦多任务学习方法无法有效聚合异构任务，导致在任务目标、标签空间和优化路径差异大的场景中效果不佳。

Method: FedDEA通过响应强度动态识别任务相关维度，并通过重新缩放增强优化效果，实现任务级解耦聚合。

Result: 实验表明，FedDEA能轻松集成到主流联邦优化算法中，并在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context数据集上显著提升性能。

Conclusion: FedDEA在高度异构任务场景下表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力，且无需任务标签或架构修改，易于部署。

Abstract: Federated Multi-Task Learning (FMTL) enables multiple clients performing
heterogeneous tasks without exchanging their local data, offering broad
potential for privacy preserving multi-task collaboration. However, most
existing methods focus on building personalized models for each client and
unable to support the aggregation of multiple heterogeneous tasks into a
unified model. As a result, in real-world scenarios where task objectives,
label spaces, and optimization paths vary significantly, conventional FMTL
methods struggle to achieve effective joint training. To address this
challenge, we propose FedDEA (Federated Decoupled Aggregation), an
update-structure-aware aggregation method specifically designed for multi-task
model integration. Our method dynamically identifies task-relevant dimensions
based on the response strength of local updates and enhances their optimization
effectiveness through rescaling. This mechanism effectively suppresses
cross-task interference and enables task-level decoupled aggregation within a
unified global model. FedDEA does not rely on task labels or architectural
modifications, making it broadly applicable and deployment-friendly.
Experimental results demonstrate that it can be easily integrated into various
mainstream federated optimization algorithms and consistently delivers
significant overall performance improvements on widely used NYUD-V2 and
PASCAL-Context. These results validate the robustness and generalization
capabilities of FedDEA under highly heterogeneous task settings.

Conclusion: 理论框架和算法有效缩小了真实与合成数据的分布差异，提升了小样本分类性能。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the scarcity of
labeled training examples. Augmenting them with synthetic data has emerged as a
promising way to alleviate this issue, but models trained on synthetic samples
often face performance degradation due to the inherent gap between real and
synthetic distributions. To address this limitation, we develop a theoretical
framework that quantifies the impact of such distribution discrepancies on
supervised learning, specifically in the context of image classification. More
importantly, our framework suggests practical ways to generate good synthetic
samples and to train a predictor with high generalization ability. Building
upon this framework, we propose a novel theoretical-based algorithm that
integrates prototype learning to optimize both data partitioning and model
training, effectively bridging the gap between real few-shot data and synthetic
data. Extensive experiments results show that our approach demonstrates
superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, outperforming them
across multiple datasets.

Method: 提出CLIC方法，通过结合多图像及其相关标题进行微调，提升模型的组合推理能力。

Result: CLIC在不同架构和预训练CLIP模型上均提升了组合性（包括词汇和语义理解），并显著改善了检索性能。

Conclusion: CLIC是当前SugarCrepe++基准上表现最佳的组合性CLIP模型，且代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
capabilities in classification and retrieval. However, these models often
struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the
relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that
previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical
sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream
retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that
improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce
CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a
novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated
captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as
differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic
understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This
even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance.
Nevertheless, the short fine-tuning with CLIC leads to an improvement in
retrieval and to the best compositional CLIP model on SugarCrepe++. All our
models and code are available at https://clic-compositional-clip.github.io

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流匹配方法独立预测每个点的速度，忽略了相邻点之间的相关性，可能影响生成质量。

Method: GFM将学习的速度场分解为反应项（标准流匹配网络）和扩散项（图神经网络模块），以聚合邻域信息。

Result: 在多个图像生成基准测试中，GFM显著提升了FID和召回率。

Conclusion: GFM是一种轻量级增强方法，能够有效提升现有流匹配架构的性能。

Abstract: Flow matching casts sample generation as learning a continuous-time velocity
field that transports noise to data. Existing flow matching networks typically
predict each point's velocity independently, considering only its location and
time along its flow trajectory, and ignoring neighboring points. However, this
pointwise approach may overlook correlations between points along the
generation trajectory that could enhance velocity predictions, thereby
improving downstream generation quality. To address this, we propose Graph Flow
Matching (GFM), a lightweight enhancement that decomposes the learned velocity
into a reaction term -- any standard flow matching network -- and a diffusion
term that aggregates neighbor information via a graph neural module. This
reaction-diffusion formulation retains the scalability of deep flow models
while enriching velocity predictions with local context, all at minimal
additional computational cost. Operating in the latent space of a pretrained
variational autoencoder, GFM consistently improves Fr\'echet Inception Distance
(FID) and recall across five image generation benchmarks (LSUN Church, LSUN
Bedroom, FFHQ, AFHQ-Cat, and CelebA-HQ at $256\times256$), demonstrating its
effectiveness as a modular enhancement to existing flow matching architectures.

datasets in deep learning, dataset distillation has been proposed to synthesize
a compact dataset that replaces the original while maintaining comparable model
performance. Unlike optimization-based approaches that require costly bi-level
optimization, distribution matching (DM) methods improve efficiency by aligning
the distributions of synthetic and original data, thereby eliminating nested
optimization. DM achieves high computational efficiency and has emerged as a
promising solution. However, existing DM methods, constrained to Euclidean
space, treat data as independent and identically distributed points,
overlooking complex geometric and hierarchical relationships. To overcome this
limitation, we propose a novel hyperbolic dataset distillation method, termed
HDD. Hyperbolic space, characterized by negative curvature and exponential
volume growth with distance, naturally models hierarchical and tree-like
structures. HDD embeds features extracted by a shallow network into the Lorentz
hyperbolic space, where the discrepancy between synthetic and original data is
measured by the hyperbolic (geodesic) distance between their centroids. By
optimizing this distance, the hierarchical structure is explicitly integrated
into the distillation process, guiding synthetic samples to gravitate towards
the root-centric regions of the original data distribution while preserving
their underlying geometric characteristics. Furthermore, we find that pruning
in hyperbolic space requires only 20% of the distilled core set to retain model
performance, while significantly improving training stability. Notably, HDD is
seamlessly compatible with most existing DM methods, and extensive experiments
on different datasets validate its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 研究为理解大规模分布式认知模型的学习机制提供了新视角，并揭示了神经网络与人类认知系统的潜在联系。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of large large-scale neural networks, we still
lack unified notation for thinking about and describing their representational
spaces. We lack methods to reliably describe how their representations are
structured, how that structure emerges over training, and what kinds of
structures are desirable. This thesis introduces quantitative methods for
identifying systematic structure in a mapping between spaces, and leverages
them to understand how deep-learning models learn to represent information,
what representational structures drive generalisation, and how design decisions
condition the structures that emerge. To do this I identify structural
primitives present in a mapping, along with information theoretic
quantifications of each. These allow us to analyse learning, structure, and
generalisation across multi-agent reinforcement learning models,
sequence-to-sequence models trained on a single task, and Large Language
Models. I also introduce a novel, performant, approach to estimating the
entropy of vector space, that allows this analysis to be applied to models
ranging in size from 1 million to 12 billion parameters.
  The experiments here work to shed light on how large-scale distributed models
of cognition learn, while allowing us to draw parallels between those systems
and their human analogs. They show how the structures of language and the
constraints that give rise to them in many ways parallel the kinds of
structures that drive performance of contemporary neural networks.

Motivation: 现有方法无法满足药物设计中多属性优化的需求，需开发能明确处理属性特定目标的方法。

Method: 通过C-MuMOInstruct数据集训练GeLLMO-Cs模型，实现针对性的多属性优化。

Result: GeLLMO-Cs在10项任务中表现优异，成功率最高提升126%，并展示出零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: GeLLMO-Cs为药物设计提供了支持多属性优化的基础模型，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In real-world drug design, molecule optimization requires selectively
improving multiple molecular properties up to pharmaceutically relevant levels,
while maintaining others that already meet such criteria. However, existing
computational approaches and instruction-tuned LLMs fail to capture such
nuanced property-specific objectives, limiting their practical applicability.
To address this, we introduce C-MuMOInstruct, the first instruction-tuning
dataset focused on multi-property optimization with explicit, property-specific
objectives. Leveraging C-MuMOInstruct, we develop GeLLMO-Cs, a series of
instruction-tuned LLMs that can perform targeted property-specific
optimization. Our experiments across 5 in-distribution and 5
out-of-distribution tasks show that GeLLMO-Cs consistently outperform strong
baselines, achieving up to 126% higher success rate. Notably, GeLLMO-Cs exhibit
impressive 0-shot generalization to novel optimization tasks and unseen
instructions. This offers a step toward a foundational LLM to support
realistic, diverse optimizations with property-specific objectives.

Motivation: 随着LLM的token成本降低，微调SLM的优势（如更快推理、更低成本）可能不再明显，但本文旨在证明SLM在特定任务中仍具优势。

Method: 比较微调SLM与提示LLM在生成JSON格式低代码工作流任务中的表现。

Result: 微调SLM比提示LLM质量平均提升10%，并通过系统错误分析揭示模型局限性。

Conclusion: 对于结构化输出任务，微调SLM仍具质量优势，尽管LLM成本降低。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o can handle a wide range of
complex tasks with the right prompt. As per token costs are reduced, the
advantages of fine-tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for real-world
applications -- faster inference, lower costs -- may no longer be clear. In
this work, we present evidence that, for domain-specific tasks that require
structured outputs, SLMs still have a quality advantage. We compare fine-tuning
an SLM against prompting LLMs on the task of generating low-code workflows in
JSON form. We observe that while a good prompt can yield reasonable results,
fine-tuning improves quality by 10% on average. We also perform systematic
error analysis to reveal model limitations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索LLM在推理过程中的局部线性行为，以揭示其内部表示的语义结构。

Method: 通过调整梯度计算策略，将LLM的Jacobian矩阵映射为线性系统，并结合奇异值分解分析低维子空间。

Result: 实验表明，多种LLM（如Llama 3、Gemma 3等）在低维子空间中运行，且奇异向量与输出令牌的语义相关。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM具有全局非线性，但其局部线性分解提供了对其内部表示和语义结构的可解释性。

Abstract: We demonstrate that the inference operations of several open-weight large
language models (LLMs) can be mapped to an exactly equivalent linear system for
an input sequence without modifying the model weights or altering output
predictions. Extending techniques from image diffusion models that exhibit
local or piecewise linearity, we strategically alter the gradient computation
with respect to a given input sequence for a next-token prediction such that
the Jacobian of the model nearly exactly reproduces the forward prediction with
a linear system. We demonstrate this approach across models (Llama 3, Gemma 3,
Qwen 3, Phi 4, Mistral Ministral and OLMo 2, up to Llama 3.3 70B Q4) and show
through the singular value decomposition of the detached Jacobian that these
LLMs operate in extremely low-dimensional subspaces where many of the largest
singular vectors decode to concepts related to the most-likely output token.
This approach also allows us to examine the operation of each successive layer
(and its attention and MLP components) as nearly-exact linear systems and
observe the emergence of semantic concepts. Despite their expressive power and
global nonlinearity, modern LLMs can be interpreted through nearly-exact
locally linear decompositions that provide insights into their internal
representations and reveal interpretable semantic structures in the next-token
prediction process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准主要面向Python，无法高质量评估其他编程语言（如Swift），因此需要专门针对Swift的评估方法。

Method: 采用质量优先的方法，手工设计了28个Swift问题，形成SwiftEval基准，并评估了44个流行的代码生成模型。

Result: 结果显示，在需要语言特定功能的问题上，模型得分显著下降，尤其是较小规模的模型表现更差。

Conclusion: SwiftEval填补了Swift评估的空白，突显了语言特定功能对模型性能的重要性。

Abstract: In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have showcased significant
advancements in code generation. However, most evaluation benchmarks are
primarily oriented towards Python, making it difficult to evaluate other
programming languages, such as Swift, with high quality. By examining widely
established multilingual benchmarks like HumanEval-XL and MultiPL-E, we
identified critical issues specific to their Swift components, making them
insufficient or even irrelevant for assessing LLM coding capabilities on Swift.
Unlike these existing approaches, which prioritize rapid scaling and
generalization by automatically translating Python-centric benchmarks with
LLMs, we adopt a quality-over-quantity methodology. We present SwiftEval, the
first Swift-oriented benchmark consisting of 28 carefully hand-crafted
problems, and evaluate 44 popular Code LLMs on it. Our results show significant
LLM scores drop for problems requiring language-specific features, most
noticeable in the models of smaller sizes.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型训练数据中可能包含的敏感信息问题，并质疑当前精确遗忘方法的隐私保护效果。

Method: 提出一种结合预遗忘和遗忘后模型信号的数据提取攻击方法，辅以标记过滤策略。

Result: 攻击方法在多个基准测试中显著提高了数据提取成功率，并在模拟医疗数据集上验证了其现实风险。

Conclusion: 研究表明精确遗忘可能增加隐私泄露风险，建议评估遗忘方法时考虑更广泛的威胁模型。

Abstract: Large language models are typically trained on datasets collected from the
web, which may inadvertently contain harmful or sensitive personal information.
To address growing privacy concerns, unlearning methods have been proposed to
remove the influence of specific data from trained models. Of these, exact
unlearning -- which retrains the model from scratch without the target data --
is widely regarded the gold standard, believed to be robust against
privacy-related attacks. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by
introducing a novel data extraction attack that compromises even exact
unlearning. Our method leverages both the pre- and post-unlearning models: by
guiding the post-unlearning model using signals from the pre-unlearning model,
we uncover patterns that reflect the removed data distribution. Combining model
guidance with a token filtering strategy, our attack significantly improves
extraction success rates -- doubling performance in some cases -- across common
benchmarks such as MUSE, TOFU, and WMDP. Furthermore, we demonstrate our
attack's effectiveness on a simulated medical diagnosis dataset to highlight
real-world privacy risks associated with exact unlearning. In light of our
findings, which suggest that unlearning may, in a contradictory way, increase
the risk of privacy leakage, we advocate for evaluation of unlearning methods
to consider broader threat models that account not only for post-unlearning
models but also for adversarial access to prior checkpoints.

TL;DR: K-Steering是一种非线性多标签分类方法，用于在推理时动态控制大型语言模型（LLMs）的多个行为属性，避免了线性假设和单独调整的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于行为属性之间的干扰和线性控制方法的局限性，需要一种更灵活的方法来动态控制LLMs的多个行为。

Method: 训练一个非线性多标签分类器，通过梯度计算干预方向，无需存储或调整单独的属性向量。

Result: 在三个模型家族中，K-Steering在准确控制多个行为方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: K-Steering提供了一种统一且灵活的方法，能够动态组合行为而无需重新训练。

Abstract: Controlling multiple behavioral attributes in large language models (LLMs) at
inference time is a challenging problem due to interference between attributes
and the limitations of linear steering methods, which assume additive behavior
in activation space and require per-attribute tuning. We introduce K-Steering,
a unified and flexible approach that trains a single non-linear multi-label
classifier on hidden activations and computes intervention directions via
gradients at inference time. This avoids linearity assumptions, removes the
need for storing and tuning separate attribute vectors, and allows dynamic
composition of behaviors without retraining. To evaluate our method, we propose
two new benchmarks, ToneBank and DebateMix, targeting compositional behavioral
control. Empirical results across 3 model families, validated by both
activation-based classifiers and LLM-based judges, demonstrate that K-Steering
outperforms strong baselines in accurately steering multiple behaviors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的大型语言模型（LLMs）在决策中潜力巨大，但缺乏推理能力和对新环境的适应性，限制了其在复杂现实任务中的应用。

Method: 提出Causal-aware LLMs，分三个阶段：1）学习阶段提取环境因果实体和关系；2）适应阶段通过因果干预更新模型；3）行动阶段利用强化学习进行决策。

Result: 在开放世界游戏“Crafter”的22个任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 因果感知的LLMs能更准确地理解环境并做出高效决策。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in decision-making
due to the vast amount of knowledge stored within the models. However, these
pre-trained models are prone to lack reasoning abilities and are difficult to
adapt to new environments, further hindering their application to complex
real-world tasks. To address these challenges, inspired by the human cognitive
process, we propose Causal-aware LLMs, which integrate the structural causal
model (SCM) into the decision-making process to model, update, and utilize
structured knowledge of the environment in a ``learning-adapting-acting"
paradigm. Specifically, in the learning stage, we first utilize an LLM to
extract the environment-specific causal entities and their causal relations to
initialize a structured causal model of the environment. Subsequently,in the
adapting stage, we update the structured causal model through external feedback
about the environment, via an idea of causal intervention. Finally, in the
acting stage, Causal-aware LLMs exploit structured causal knowledge for more
efficient policy-making through the reinforcement learning agent. The above
processes are performed iteratively to learn causal knowledge, ultimately
enabling the causal-aware LLMs to achieve a more accurate understanding of the
environment and make more efficient decisions. Experimental results across 22
diverse tasks within the open-world game ``Crafter" validate the effectiveness
of our proposed method.

Result: 在SWE-bench和Long Code Arena数据集上，检索召回率比现有模型至少提高15个百分点。

Conclusion: CoRet通过优化设计显著提升了代码检索性能，验证了其方法的有效性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce CoRet, a dense retrieval model designed for
code-editing tasks that integrates code semantics, repository structure, and
call graph dependencies. The model focuses on retrieving relevant portions of a
code repository based on natural language queries such as requests to implement
new features or fix bugs. These retrieved code chunks can then be presented to
a user or to a second code-editing model or agent. To train CoRet, we propose a
loss function explicitly designed for repository-level retrieval. On SWE-bench
and Long Code Arena's bug localisation datasets, we show that our model
substantially improves retrieval recall by at least 15 percentage points over
existing models, and ablate the design choices to show their importance in
achieving these results.

Result: 理论证明和实验验证表明，SUMO显著提升收敛速度、稳定性和性能，同时减少20%内存需求。

Conclusion: SUMO通过精确正交化和动态子空间调整，在高各向异性环境中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Low-rank gradient-based optimization methods have significantly improved
memory efficiency during the training of large language models (LLMs), enabling
operations within constrained hardware without sacrificing performance.
However, these methods primarily emphasize memory savings, often overlooking
potential acceleration in convergence due to their reliance on standard
isotropic steepest descent techniques, which can perform suboptimally in the
highly anisotropic landscapes typical of deep networks, particularly LLMs. In
this paper, we propose SUMO (Subspace-Aware Moment-Orthogonalization), an
optimizer that employs exact singular value decomposition (SVD) for moment
orthogonalization within a dynamically adapted low-dimensional subspace,
enabling norm-inducing steepest descent optimization steps. By explicitly
aligning optimization steps with the spectral characteristics of the loss
landscape, SUMO effectively mitigates approximation errors associated with
commonly used methods like Newton-Schulz orthogonalization approximation. We
theoretically establish an upper bound on these approximation errors, proving
their dependence on the condition numbers of moments, conditions we
analytically demonstrate are encountered during LLM training. Furthermore, we
both theoretically and empirically illustrate that exact orthogonalization via
SVD substantially improves convergence rates while reducing overall complexity.
Empirical evaluations confirm that SUMO accelerates convergence, enhances
stability, improves performance, and reduces memory requirements by up to 20%
compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 研究为开发具有高效、稳健和可解释的科学推理能力的AI系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced and are increasingly
capable of tackling complex scientific problems, including those in physics.
Despite this progress, current LLMs often fail to emulate the concise,
principle-based reasoning characteristic of human experts, instead generating
lengthy and opaque solutions. This discrepancy highlights a crucial gap in
their ability to apply core physical principles for efficient and interpretable
problem solving. To systematically investigate this limitation, we introduce
PhySense, a novel principle-based physics reasoning benchmark designed to be
easily solvable by experts using guiding principles, yet deceptively difficult
for LLMs without principle-first reasoning. Our evaluation across multiple
state-of-the-art LLMs and prompt types reveals a consistent failure to align
with expert-like reasoning paths, providing insights for developing AI systems
with efficient, robust and interpretable principle-based scientific reasoning.

Abstract: Training data mixtures greatly impact the generalization performance of large
language models. Existing domain reweighting methods often rely on costly
weight computations and require retraining when new data is introduced. To this
end, we introduce a flexible and efficient data mixing framework, Chameleon,
that employs leverage scores to quantify domain importance within a learned
embedding space. We first construct a domain affinity matrix over domain
embeddings. The induced leverage scores determine a mixture that upweights
domains sharing common representations in embedding space. This formulation
allows direct transfer to new data by computing the new domain embeddings. In
experiments, we demonstrate improvements over three key scenarios: (i) our
computed weights improve performance on pretraining domains with a fraction of
the compute of existing methods; (ii) Chameleon can adapt to data changes
without proxy retraining, boosting few-shot reasoning accuracies when
transferred to new data; (iii) our method enables efficient domain reweighting
in finetuning, consistently improving test perplexity on all finetuning domains
over uniform mixture. Our code is available at

Conclusion: REDI框架通过有效利用正负推理数据，显著提升了小模型的推理能力，为离线训练提供了新的高效方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in model distillation demonstrate that data from advanced
reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI's o1) can effectively transfer
complex reasoning abilities to smaller, efficient student models. However,
standard practices employ rejection sampling, discarding incorrect reasoning
examples -- valuable, yet often underutilized data. This paper addresses the
critical question: How can both positive and negative distilled reasoning
traces be effectively leveraged to maximize LLM reasoning performance in an
offline setting? To this end, We propose Reinforcement Distillation (REDI), a
two-stage framework. Stage 1 learns from positive traces via Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT). Stage 2 further refines the model using both positive and
negative traces through our proposed REDI objective. This novel objective is a
simple, reference-free loss function that outperforms established methods like
DPO and SimPO in this distillation context. Our empirical evaluations
demonstrate REDI's superiority over baseline Rejection Sampling SFT or SFT
combined with DPO/SimPO on mathematical reasoning tasks. Notably, the
Qwen-REDI-1.5B model, post-trained on just 131k positive and negative examples
from the open Open-R1 dataset, achieves an 83.1% score on MATH-500 (pass@1).
Its performance matches or surpasses that of DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B (a
model post-trained on 800k proprietary data) across various mathematical
reasoning benchmarks, establishing a new state-of-the-art for 1.5B models
post-trained offline with openly available data.

Result: 转向向量能有效控制目标属性，但高强度转向会降低文本质量；提示法控制较弱但质量更优；结合两者效果最佳。

Conclusion: 转向向量在自由生成任务中需权衡控制强度与文本质量，结合提示法可优化效果。

Abstract: Steering vectors are a lightweight method for controlling text properties by
adding a learned bias to language model activations at inference time. So far,
steering vectors have predominantly been evaluated in multiple-choice settings,
while their effectiveness in free-form generation tasks remains understudied.
Moving "Beyond Multiple Choice," we thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness of
steering vectors in adaptively controlling topical focus, sentiment, toxicity,
and readability in abstractive summaries of the NEWTS dataset. We find that
steering effectively controls the targeted summary properties, but high
steering strengths consistently degrade both intrinsic and extrinsic text
quality. Compared to steering, prompting offers weaker control, while
preserving text quality. Combining steering and prompting yields the strongest
control over text properties and offers the most favorable efficacy-quality
trade-off at moderate steering strengths. Our results underscore the practical
trade-off between control strength and text quality preservation when applying
steering vectors to free-form generation tasks.

Motivation: 主要重音识别对语音理解和意义编码至关重要，但以往研究多依赖传统声学特征和英语数据集，本文旨在探索更高效的方法。

Method: 采用预训练Transformer模型，添加音频帧分类头进行微调，并与基于传统声学特征的SVM分类器对比。

Result: Transformer模型在克罗地亚语和塞尔维亚语上表现近乎完美，对较远的查方言和斯洛文尼亚语性能下降10分。仅需少量多音节训练词即可实现强性能。

Conclusion: 微调Transformer模型在多语言重音识别中优于传统方法，且数据需求低，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Automating primary stress identification has been an active research field
due to the role of stress in encoding meaning and aiding speech comprehension.
Previous studies relied mainly on traditional acoustic features and English
datasets. In this paper, we investigate the approach of fine-tuning a
pre-trained transformer model with an audio frame classification head. Our
experiments use a new Croatian training dataset, with test sets in Croatian,
Serbian, the Chakavian dialect, and Slovenian. By comparing an SVM classifier
using traditional acoustic features with the fine-tuned speech transformer, we
demonstrate the transformer's superiority across the board, achieving
near-perfect results for Croatian and Serbian, with a 10-point performance drop
for the more distant Chakavian and Slovenian. Finally, we show that only a few
hundred multi-syllabic training words suffice for strong performance. We
release our datasets and model under permissive licenses.

Motivation: 了解对话轮换行为中的普遍约束和变异性，特别是人口统计和个体因素的作用。

Method: 使用Fisher数据集分析美国英语对话中的Transition Floor Offset（TFO），考察性别、年龄、教育等因素的影响。

Result: 性别和年龄对TFO有微小但显著影响，而教育无影响；个体差异和对话双方关系对TFO的影响更大。

Conclusion: 对话双方关系和共同活动是TFO的最强决定因素，超越人口统计影响。

Abstract: Turn-taking in dialogue follows universal constraints but also varies
significantly. This study examines how demographic (sex, age, education) and
individual factors shape turn-taking using a large dataset of US English
conversations (Fisher). We analyze Transition Floor Offset (TFO) and find
notable interspeaker variation. Sex and age have small but significant effects
female speakers and older individuals exhibit slightly shorter offsets - while
education shows no effect. Lighter topics correlate with shorter TFOs. However,
individual differences have a greater impact, driven by a strong idiosyncratic
and an even stronger "dyadosyncratic" component - speakers in a dyad resemble
each other more than they resemble themselves in different dyads. This suggests
that the dyadic relationship and joint activity are the strongest determinants
of TFO, outweighing demographic influences.

TL;DR: 3DGEER提出了一种精确且高效的体积高斯渲染方法，解决了3D高斯投影在渲染质量上的限制，特别是在大视场角输入下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯投影（3DGS）在平衡渲染质量和效率方面取得了显著进展，但其近似投影方法限制了渲染质量，尤其是在大视场角下。现有方法未能同时实现精确性和高效性。

Method: 3DGEER从基本原理出发，推导了3D高斯分布沿光线密度积分的闭式表达式，支持任意相机模型的精确前向渲染。通过提出粒子边界视锥（PBF）和双极等角投影（BEAP）表示，实现了高效且精确的光线-高斯关联。

Result: 实验表明，3DGEER在多个针孔和鱼眼数据集上均优于现有方法，实现了实时神经渲染的新标杆。

Conclusion: 3DGEER成功解决了3DGS的局限性，同时实现了精确性和高效性，为实时神经渲染领域树立了新标准。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) marks a significant milestone in balancing the
quality and efficiency of differentiable rendering. However, its high
efficiency stems from an approximation of projecting 3D Gaussians onto the
image plane as 2D Gaussians, which inherently limits rendering
quality--particularly under large Field-of-View (FoV) camera inputs. While
several recent works have extended 3DGS to mitigate these approximation errors,
none have successfully achieved both exactness and high efficiency
simultaneously. In this work, we introduce 3DGEER, an Exact and Efficient
Volumetric Gaussian Rendering method. Starting from first principles, we derive
a closed-form expression for the density integral along a ray traversing a 3D
Gaussian distribution. This formulation enables precise forward rendering with
arbitrary camera models and supports gradient-based optimization of 3D Gaussian
parameters. To ensure both exactness and real-time performance, we propose an
efficient method for computing a tight Particle Bounding Frustum (PBF) for each
3D Gaussian, enabling accurate and efficient ray-Gaussian association. We also
introduce a novel Bipolar Equiangular Projection (BEAP) representation to
accelerate ray association under generic camera models. BEAP further provides a
more uniform ray sampling strategy to apply supervision, which empirically
improves reconstruction quality. Experiments on multiple pinhole and fisheye
datasets show that our method consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in real-time neural rendering.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯渲染中，alpha混合计算耗时高，Tensor Core利用率不足。

Method: 提出TC-GS模块，将alpha计算转为矩阵乘法，并引入全局-局部坐标变换以减少精度误差。

Result: 实验显示，TC-GS在保持渲染质量的同时，速度提升2.18倍，总加速达5.6倍。

Conclusion: TC-GS是一种通用模块，可无缝集成现有优化框架，显著提升3D高斯渲染效率。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) renders pixels by rasterizing Gaussian
primitives, where conditional alpha-blending dominates the time cost in the
rendering pipeline. This paper proposes TC-GS, an algorithm-independent
universal module that expands Tensor Core (TCU) applicability for 3DGS, leading
to substantial speedups and seamless integration into existing 3DGS
optimization frameworks. The key innovation lies in mapping alpha computation
to matrix multiplication, fully utilizing otherwise idle TCUs in existing 3DGS
implementations. TC-GS provides plug-and-play acceleration for existing
top-tier acceleration algorithms tightly coupled with rendering pipeline
designs, like Gaussian compression and redundancy elimination algorithms.
Additionally, we introduce a global-to-local coordinate transformation to
mitigate rounding errors from quadratic terms of pixel coordinates caused by
Tensor Core half-precision computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method maintains rendering quality while providing an additional 2.18x
speedup over existing Gaussian acceleration algorithms, thus reaching up to a
total 5.6x acceleration. The code is currently available at anonymous

Motivation: 透明和镜面材料因深度感知限制难以抓取，现有方法复杂或信息利用不足。

Method: 利用单视图RGB和深度图像，通过外部视觉模型生成3D网格，再通过视图和关键点匹配确定物体3D状态。

Result: 实验证明SR3D在仿真和真实场景中有效重建3D深度图。

Conclusion: SR3D为透明和镜面物体的机器人抓取提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D robotic manipulation have improved grasping of
everyday objects, but transparent and specular materials remain challenging due
to depth sensing limitations. While several 3D reconstruction and depth
completion approaches address these challenges, they suffer from setup
complexity or limited observation information utilization. To address this,
leveraging the power of single view 3D object reconstruction approaches, we
propose a training free framework SR3D that enables robotic grasping of
transparent and specular objects from a single view observation. Specifically,
given single view RGB and depth images, SR3D first uses the external visual
models to generate 3D reconstructed object mesh based on RGB image. Then, the
key idea is to determine the 3D object's pose and scale to accurately localize
the reconstructed object back into its original depth corrupted 3D scene.
Therefore, we propose view matching and keypoint matching mechanisms,which
leverage both the 2D and 3D's inherent semantic and geometric information in
the observation to determine the object's 3D state within the scene, thereby
reconstructing an accurate 3D depth map for effective grasp detection.
Experiments in both simulation and real world show the reconstruction
effectiveness of SR3D.

Motivation: 尽管深度学习在SLAM任务中取得了进展，但其对对抗攻击的脆弱性限制了其在自主导航等应用中的可靠性。目前缺乏对针对CNN特征检测器的对抗攻击的全面研究。

Method: 研究采用了黑盒对抗扰动方法，针对GCN-SLAM算法的RGB输入图像进行攻击，并在TUM数据集上进行了实验。

Result: 实验结果显示，中等规模的攻击可导致76%的帧跟踪失败；攻击深度输入对SLAM系统的破坏性更大。

Conclusion: 研究表明，对抗攻击对基于CNN的SLAM系统具有显著威胁，尤其是针对深度输入的攻击，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Continuous advancements in deep learning have led to significant progress in
feature detection, resulting in enhanced accuracy in tasks like Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM). Nevertheless, the vulnerability of deep neural
networks to adversarial attacks remains a challenge for their reliable
deployment in applications, such as navigation of autonomous agents. Even
though CNN-based SLAM algorithms are a growing area of research there is a
notable absence of a comprehensive presentation and examination of adversarial
attacks targeting CNN-based feature detectors, as part of a SLAM system. Our
work introduces black-box adversarial perturbations applied to the RGB images
fed into the GCN-SLAM algorithm. Our findings on the TUM dataset [30] reveal
that even attacks of moderate scale can lead to tracking failure in as many as
76% of the frames. Moreover, our experiments highlight the catastrophic impact
of attacking depth instead of RGB input images on the SLAM system.

Motivation: 现有手势识别方法局限于短距离交互，无法满足远距离辅助通信需求，限制了辅助机器人的实用性。

Method: 采用DiG-Net，结合DADA块和时空图模块处理远距离手势序列，并引入RSTDAL损失函数增强模型鲁棒性。

Result: 在多样化数据集上达到97.3%的识别准确率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiG-Net显著提升了辅助机器人在家庭护理、工业安全和远程协助等场景中的实用性，支持远距离无缝交互。

Abstract: Dynamic hand gestures play a pivotal role in assistive human-robot
interaction (HRI), facilitating intuitive, non-verbal communication,
particularly for individuals with mobility constraints or those operating
robots remotely. Current gesture recognition methods are mostly limited to
short-range interactions, reducing their utility in scenarios demanding robust
assistive communication from afar. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach
designed specifically for assistive robotics, enabling dynamic gesture
recognition at extended distances of up to 30 meters, thereby significantly
improving accessibility and quality of life. Our proposed Distance-aware
Gesture Network (DiG-Net) effectively combines Depth-Conditioned Deformable
Alignment (DADA) blocks with Spatio-Temporal Graph modules, enabling robust
processing and classification of gesture sequences captured under challenging
conditions, including significant physical attenuation, reduced resolution, and
dynamic gesture variations commonly experienced in real-world assistive
environments. We further introduce the Radiometric Spatio-Temporal Depth
Attenuation Loss (RSTDAL), shown to enhance learning and strengthen model
robustness across varying distances. Our model demonstrates significant
performance improvement over state-of-the-art gesture recognition frameworks,
achieving a recognition accuracy of 97.3% on a diverse dataset with challenging
hyper-range gestures. By effectively interpreting gestures from considerable
distances, DiG-Net significantly enhances the usability of assistive robots in
home healthcare, industrial safety, and remote assistance scenarios, enabling
seamless and intuitive interactions for users regardless of physical
limitations

Result: 实验验证了Bi-JCR在多种桌面环境中的鲁棒性，并展示了其在下游任务中的适用性。

Conclusion: Bi-JCR为双机器人臂协作提供了一种高效、无标记的校准与表示解决方案。

Abstract: Robot manipulation, especially bimanual manipulation, often requires setting
up multiple cameras on multiple robot manipulators. Before robot manipulators
can generate motion or even build representations of their environments, the
cameras rigidly mounted to the robot need to be calibrated. Camera calibration
is a cumbersome process involving collecting a set of images, with each
capturing a pre-determined marker. In this work, we introduce the Bi-Manual
Joint Calibration and Representation Framework (Bi-JCR). Bi-JCR enables
multiple robot manipulators, each with cameras mounted, to circumvent taking
images of calibration markers. By leveraging 3D foundation models for dense,
marker-free multi-view correspondence, Bi-JCR jointly estimates: (i) the
extrinsic transformation from each camera to its end-effector, (ii) the
inter-arm relative poses between manipulators, and (iii) a unified,
scale-consistent 3D representation of the shared workspace, all from the same
captured RGB image sets. The representation, jointly constructed from images
captured by cameras on both manipulators, lives in a common coordinate frame
and supports collision checking and semantic segmentation to facilitate
downstream bimanual coordination tasks. We empirically evaluate the robustness
of Bi-JCR on a variety of tabletop environments, and demonstrate its
applicability on a variety of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: SeqCRC为COD提供了统计保证，工具包支持进一步研究和应用。

Abstract: Recent advances in object detectors have led to their adoption for industrial
uses. However, their deployment in critical applications is hindered by the
inherent lack of reliability of neural networks and the complex structure of
object detection models. To address these challenges, we turn to Conformal
Prediction, a post-hoc procedure which offers statistical guarantees that are
valid for any dataset size, without requiring prior knowledge on the model or
data distribution. Our contribution is manifold: first, we formally define the
problem of Conformal Object Detection (COD) and introduce a novel method,
Sequential Conformal Risk Control (SeqCRC), that extends the statistical
guarantees of Conformal Risk Control (CRC) to two sequential tasks with two
parameters, as required in the COD setting. Then, we propose loss functions and
prediction sets suited to applying CRC to different applications and
certification requirements. Finally, we present a conformal toolkit, enabling
replication and further exploration of our methods. Using this toolkit, we
perform extensive experiments, yielding a benchmark that validates the
investigated methods and emphasizes trade-offs and other practical
consequences.

Motivation: 传统多模态对比学习通常关注模态间的表示对齐，但缺乏概率视角。本文旨在通过概率框架重新解释对比学习，并探索其扩展应用。

Method: 将对比学习视为优化条件概率分布的编码器，提出新的概率损失函数和度量方法，并在多元高斯设定下研究其性质。

Result: 通过理论分析和数值实验（如MNIST和海洋学数据），验证了新方法在模态对齐和生成任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 概率框架为多模态对比学习提供了新的视角和扩展方法，适用于检索、分类和生成任务。

Abstract: Multimodal contrastive learning is a methodology for linking different data
modalities; the canonical example is linking image and text data. The
methodology is typically framed as the identification of a set of encoders, one
for each modality, that align representations within a common latent space. In
this work, we focus on the bimodal setting and interpret contrastive learning
as the optimization of (parameterized) encoders that define conditional
probability distributions, for each modality conditioned on the other,
consistent with the available data. This provides a framework for multimodal
algorithms such as crossmodal retrieval, which identifies the mode of one of
these conditional distributions, and crossmodal classification, which is
similar to retrieval but includes a fine-tuning step to make it task specific.
  The framework we adopt also gives rise to crossmodal generative models. This
probabilistic perspective suggests two natural generalizations of contrastive
learning: the introduction of novel probabilistic loss functions, and the use
of alternative metrics for measuring alignment in the common latent space. We
study these generalizations of the classical approach in the multivariate
Gaussian setting. In this context we view the latent space identification as a
low-rank matrix approximation problem. This allows us to characterize the
capabilities of loss functions and alignment metrics to approximate natural
statistics, such as conditional means and covariances; doing so yields novel
variants on contrastive learning algorithms for specific mode-seeking and for
generative tasks. The framework we introduce is also studied through numerical
experiments on multivariate Gaussians, the labeled MNIST dataset, and on a data
assimilation application arising in oceanography.

Result: 在合成和真实高维数据上验证了方法的效率和准确性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且准确，适用于高维数据中的正则化参数估计。

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating a regularization parameter, or a
shrinkage coefficient $\alpha \in (0,1)$ for Regularized Tyler's M-estimator
(RTME). In particular, we propose to estimate an optimal shrinkage coefficient
by setting $\alpha$ as the solution to a suitably chosen objective function;
namely the leave-one-out cross-validated (LOOCV) log-likelihood loss. Since
LOOCV is computationally prohibitive even for moderate sample size $n$, we
propose a computationally efficient approximation for the LOOCV log-likelihood
loss that eliminates the need for invoking the RTME procedure $n$ times for
each sample left out during the LOOCV procedure. This approximation yields an
$O(n)$ reduction in the running time complexity for the LOOCV procedure, which
results in a significant speedup for computing the LOOCV estimate. We
demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed approach on synthetic
high-dimensional data sampled from heavy-tailed elliptical distributions, as
well as on real high-dimensional datasets for object recognition, face
recognition, and handwritten digit's recognition. Our experiments show that the
proposed approach is efficient and consistently more accurate than other
methods in the literature for shrinkage coefficient estimation.

Result: SC在多个数据集和模型上表现优于基线方法，尤其在4-shot、8-shot和16-shot设置中。

Conclusion: SC不仅统一了现有校准方法，还通过更灵活的功能类显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to new
tasks with just a few examples, but their predictions often suffer from
systematic biases, leading to unstable performances in classification. While
calibration techniques are proposed to mitigate these biases, we show that, in
the logit space, many of these methods are equivalent to merely shifting the
LLM's decision boundary without having the ability to alter its orientation.
This proves inadequate when biases cause the LLM to be severely misdirected. To
address these limitations and provide a unifying framework, we propose
Supervised Calibration (SC), a loss-minimization based framework which learns
an optimal, per-class affine transformation of the LLM's predictive
probabilities in the logit space without requiring external data beyond the
context. By using a more expressive functional class, SC not only subsumes many
existing calibration methods in ICL as special cases, but also enables the
ability to alter and even completely reverse the orientation of the LLM's
decision boundary. Furthermore, SC's loss-based nature facilitates the seamless
integration of two purpose-built regularization techniques: context-invariance
and directional trust-region. The former is designed to tackle the instability
issue in ICL, while the latter controls the degree of calibration. Finally, SC
delivers state-of-the-art performance over calibration baselines in the 4-shot,
8-shot, and 16-shot settings across all nine datasets for
Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, LLaMA-2-7B-chat, and Qwen2-7B-Instruct.

Abstract: CAPTCHAs have been a critical bottleneck for deploying web agents in
real-world applications, often blocking them from completing end-to-end
automation tasks. While modern multimodal LLM agents have demonstrated
impressive performance in static perception tasks, their ability to handle
interactive, multi-step reasoning challenges like CAPTCHAs is largely untested.
To address this gap, we introduce Open CaptchaWorld, the first web-based
benchmark and platform specifically designed to evaluate the visual reasoning
and interaction capabilities of MLLM-powered agents through diverse and dynamic
CAPTCHA puzzles. Our benchmark spans 20 modern CAPTCHA types, totaling 225
CAPTCHAs, annotated with a new metric we propose: CAPTCHA Reasoning Depth,
which quantifies the number of cognitive and motor steps required to solve each
puzzle. Experimental results show that humans consistently achieve near-perfect
scores, state-of-the-art MLLM agents struggle significantly, with success rates
at most 40.0% by Browser-Use Openai-o3, far below human-level performance,
93.3%. This highlights Open CaptchaWorld as a vital benchmark for diagnosing
the limits of current multimodal agents and guiding the development of more

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with reasoning are trained to iteratively

design. This field studies diverse types of combinatorial designs, many of
which have lists of open instances for which existence has not yet been
determined. The Constructive Protocol CPro1 uses LLMs to generate search
heuristics that have the potential to construct solutions to small open
instances. Starting with a textual definition and a validity verifier for a
particular type of design, CPro1 guides LLMs to select and implement
strategies, while providing automated hyperparameter tuning and execution
feedback. CPro1 with reasoning LLMs successfully solves long-standing open
instances for 7 of 16 combinatorial design problems selected from the 2006
Handbook of Combinatorial Designs, including new solved instances for 3 of
these (Bhaskar Rao Designs, Symmetric Weighing Matrices, Balanced Ternary

their domain-specific nature. Current approaches face two critical
shortcomings: they require complete architectural redesign and full retraining
of all components when applied to new domains. We introduce Workforce, a
hierarchical multi-agent framework that decouples strategic planning from
specialized execution through a modular architecture comprising: (i) a
domain-agnostic Planner for task decomposition, (ii) a Coordinator for subtask
management, and (iii) specialized Workers with domain-specific tool-calling
capabilities. This decoupling enables cross-domain transferability during both
inference and training phases: During inference, Workforce seamlessly adapts to
new domains by adding or modifying worker agents; For training, we introduce
Optimized Workforce Learning (OWL), which improves generalization across
domains by optimizing a domain-agnostic planner with reinforcement learning
from real-world feedback. To validate our approach, we evaluate Workforce on
the GAIA benchmark, covering various realistic, multi-domain agentic tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate Workforce achieves open-source
state-of-the-art performance (69.70%), outperforming commercial systems like
OpenAI's Deep Research by 2.34%. More notably, our OWL-trained 32B model
achieves 52.73% accuracy (+16.37%) and demonstrates performance comparable to
GPT-4o on challenging tasks. To summarize, by enabling scalable generalization
and modular domain transfer, our work establishes a foundation for the next
generation of general-purpose AI assistants.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对人类-AI对话中引用文本的生成方法，通过引入跨度条件生成和轻量级训练方法QuAda，提升了模型对引用文本的利用能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型缺乏显式机制来定位和利用对话中的引用文本，限制了其在引用场景下的表现。

Method: 提出了跨度条件生成框架，并开发了QuAda方法，通过动态调整注意力机制来增强对引用文本的关注。

Result: 实验表明，QuAda在多种场景下表现优异，并能泛化到未见过的主题。

Conclusion: QuAda为引用感知对话提供了一种高效、即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Human-AI conversation frequently relies on quoting earlier text-"check it
with the formula I just highlighted"-yet today's large language models (LLMs)
lack an explicit mechanism for locating and exploiting such spans. We formalise
the challenge as span-conditioned generation, decomposing each turn into the
dialogue history, a set of token-offset quotation spans, and an intent
utterance. Building on this abstraction, we introduce a quotation-centric data
pipeline that automatically synthesises task-specific dialogues, verifies
answer correctness through multi-stage consistency checks, and yields both a
heterogeneous training corpus and the first benchmark covering five
representative scenarios. To meet the benchmark's zero-overhead and
parameter-efficiency requirements, we propose QuAda, a lightweight
training-based method that attaches two bottleneck projections to every
attention head, dynamically amplifying or suppressing attention to quoted spans
at inference time while leaving the prompt unchanged and updating < 2.8% of
backbone weights. Experiments across models show that QuAda is suitable for all
scenarios and generalises to unseen topics, offering an effective,
plug-and-play solution for quotation-aware dialogue.

Conclusion: 未来进展不仅需要架构创新，还需更清晰的优化和评估框架，以支持复杂模块化系统的发展。

Abstract: Integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) results
in complex systems with numerous hyperparameters that directly affect
performance. While such systems are increasingly common in retrieval-augmented
generation, the role of systematic hyperparameter optimization remains
underexplored. In this paper, we study this problem in the context of Cognee, a
modular framework for end-to-end KG construction and retrieval. Using three
multi-hop QA benchmarks (HotPotQA, TwoWikiMultiHop, and MuSiQue) we optimize
parameters related to chunking, graph construction, retrieval, and prompting.
Each configuration is scored using established metrics (exact match, F1, and
DeepEval's LLM-based correctness metric). Our results demonstrate that
meaningful gains can be achieved through targeted tuning. While the gains are
consistent, they are not uniform, with performance varying across datasets and
metrics. This variability highlights both the value of tuning and the
limitations of standard evaluation measures. While demonstrating the immediate
potential of hyperparameter tuning, we argue that future progress will depend
not only on architectural advances but also on clearer frameworks for
optimization and evaluation in complex, modular systems.

Abstract: The rapid spread of misinformation, further amplified by recent advances in
generative AI, poses significant threats to society, impacting public opinion,
democratic stability, and national security. Understanding and proactively
assessing these threats requires exploring methodologies that enable structured
and scalable misinformation generation. In this paper, we propose a novel
approach that leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) as structured semantic resources
to systematically generate fake triplets. By analyzing the structural
properties of KGs, such as the distance between entities and their predicates,
we identify plausibly false relationships. These triplets are then used to
guide large language models (LLMs) in generating misinformation statements with
varying degrees of credibility. By utilizing structured semantic relationships,
our deterministic approach produces misinformation inherently challenging for
humans to detect, drawing exclusively upon publicly available KGs (e.g.,
WikiGraphs).
  Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of LLMs in distinguishing
between genuine and artificially generated misinformation. Our analysis
highlights significant limitations in current LLM-based detection methods,
underscoring the necessity for enhanced detection strategies and a deeper
exploration of inherent biases in generative models.

TL;DR: MiCRo框架通过两阶段方法解决奖励建模中人类偏好多样性问题，提升个性化对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Bradley-Terry模型假设全局奖励函数，无法捕捉人类偏好的多样性，限制了LLMs的个性化和多元化对齐。

Method: MiCRo采用两阶段框架：第一阶段通过上下文感知混合建模捕捉多样性偏好；第二阶段通过动态路由策略调整权重。

Result: 实验表明，MiCRo能有效捕捉多样化偏好并显著提升下游个性化任务表现。

Conclusion: MiCRo为LLMs的个性化偏好学习提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward modeling is a key step in building safe foundation models when
applying reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align Large
Language Models (LLMs). However, reward modeling based on the Bradley-Terry
(BT) model assumes a global reward function, failing to capture the inherently
diverse and heterogeneous human preferences. Hence, such oversimplification
limits LLMs from supporting personalization and pluralistic alignment.
Theoretically, we show that when human preferences follow a mixture
distribution of diverse subgroups, a single BT model has an irreducible error.
While existing solutions, such as multi-objective learning with fine-grained
annotations, help address this issue, they are costly and constrained by
predefined attributes, failing to fully capture the richness of human values.
In this work, we introduce MiCRo, a two-stage framework that enhances
personalized preference learning by leveraging large-scale binary preference
datasets without requiring explicit fine-grained annotations. In the first
stage, MiCRo introduces context-aware mixture modeling approach to capture
diverse human preferences. In the second stage, MiCRo integrates an online
routing strategy that dynamically adapts mixture weights based on specific
context to resolve ambiguity, allowing for efficient and scalable preference
adaptation with minimal additional supervision. Experiments on multiple
preference datasets demonstrate that MiCRo effectively captures diverse human
preferences and significantly improves downstream personalization.

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: PatchDEMUX是一个针对多标签分类器的可证明鲁棒框架，通过将多标签任务分解为多个二分类问题，扩展了单标签分类的防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型易受对抗性补丁攻击，现有可证明防御方法主要针对单标签分类，多标签分类领域研究不足。

Method: 将多标签分类任务分解为多个独立的二分类问题，利用现有单标签防御方法（如PatchCleanser）扩展为多标签防御框架。

Result: 在MS-COCO和PASCAL VOC数据集上实现了非平凡的鲁棒性，同时保持高清洁性能。

Conclusion: PatchDEMUX为多标签分类提供了可证明的鲁棒防御方法，填补了研究空白。

Abstract: Deep learning techniques have enabled vast improvements in computer vision
technologies. Nevertheless, these models are vulnerable to adversarial patch
attacks which catastrophically impair performance. The physically realizable
nature of these attacks calls for certifiable defenses, which feature provable
guarantees on robustness. While certifiable defenses have been successfully
applied to single-label classification, limited work has been done for
multi-label classification. In this work, we present PatchDEMUX, a certifiably
robust framework for multi-label classifiers against adversarial patches. Our
approach is a generalizable method which can extend any existing certifiable
defense for single-label classification; this is done by considering the
multi-label classification task as a series of isolated binary classification
problems to provably guarantee robustness. Furthermore, in the scenario where
an attacker is limited to a single patch we propose an additional certification
procedure that can provide tighter robustness bounds. Using the current
state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-label certifiable defense PatchCleanser as a
backbone, we find that PatchDEMUX can achieve non-trivial robustness on the
MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets while maintaining high clean performance
