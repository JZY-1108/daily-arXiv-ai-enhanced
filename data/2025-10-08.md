### [1] [Collaborative and Proactive Management of Task-Oriented Conversations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05110)
*Arezoo Saedi,Afsaneh Fatemi,Mohammad Ali Nematbakhsh,Sophie Rosset,Anne Vilnat*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文基于信息状态方法构建了任务导向对话系统，通过引入建设性中间信息进行规划，利用LLMs实现上下文学习，在MultiWOZ数据集上取得了最优表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务导向对话系统大多忽视有效的目标感知规划，而主动规划对任务完成至关重要。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 创建基于信息状态方法的对话管理模型：1) 定义槽位和文本组件建模用户偏好；2) 识别关键情境并创建对应信息组件；3) 构建有限信息状态；4) 定义对话动作和更新策略；5) 利用LLMs实现上下文学习。

Result: 在MultiWOZ单领域对话测试中，实现了最大化的信息提供和成功率，相比之前方法有所提升。

Conclusion: 提出的基于信息状态和中间信息规划的方法有效提升了任务导向对话系统的性能，证明了目标感知规划的重要性。

Abstract: Task oriented dialogue systems (TOD) complete particular tasks based on user
preferences across natural language interactions. Considering the impressive
performance of large language models (LLMs) in natural language processing
(NLP) tasks, most of the latest TODs are centered on LLMs. While proactive
planning is crucial for task completion, many existing TODs overlook effective
goal-aware planning. This paper creates a model for managing task-oriented
conversations, conceptualized centered on the information state approach to
dialogue management. The created model incorporated constructive intermediate
information in planning. Initially, predefined slots and text part
informational components are created to model user preferences. Investigating
intermediate information, critical circumstances are identified. Informational
components corresponding to these circumstances are created. Possible
configurations for these informational components lead to limited information
states. Then, dialogue moves, which indicate movement between these information
states and the procedures that must be performed in the movements, are created.
Eventually, the update strategy is constructed. The created model is
implemented leveraging in-context learning of LLMs. In this model, database
queries are created centered on indicated predefined slots and the order of
retrieved entities is indicated centered on text part. This mechanism enables
passing the whole corresponding entities to the preferences in the order of
congruency. Evaluations exploiting the complete test conversations of MultiWOZ,
with no more than a domain in a conversation, illustrate maximal inform and
success, and improvement compared with previous methods.

### [2] [Trainable Reference-Based Evaluation Metric for Identifying Quality of English-Gujarati Machine Translation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05113)
*Nisheeth Joshi,Pragya Katyayan,Palak Arora*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文为古吉拉特语开发了一种基于监督学习的机器翻译评估指标，使用25个特征训练了两个神经网络模型（6层和10层隐藏层），在1000个MT系统输出上测试，相比现有指标获得了更好的人工相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器翻译评估方法对英语和欧洲语言有效，但不适用于印度语言，特别是古吉拉特语，因此需要开发专门针对该语言的评估指标。

Method: 采用基于监督学习的方法，使用25个特征训练了两个神经网络模型：一个6隐藏层模型和一个10隐藏层模型，均在500个epoch上训练。收集了7个MT系统的1000个输出与人工参考翻译进行比较。

Result: 开发的评估指标在测试中表现出比其他可用指标更好的人工相关性，表明该方法对古吉拉特语机器翻译评估是有效的。

Conclusion: 成功开发了专门针对古吉拉特语的机器翻译评估指标，该基于监督学习的方法能够有效评估古吉拉特语MT系统的性能，填补了现有评估方法在印度语言上的不足。

Abstract: Machine Translation (MT) Evaluation is an integral part of the MT development
life cycle. Without analyzing the outputs of MT engines, it is impossible to
evaluate the performance of an MT system. Through experiments, it has been
identified that what works for English and other European languages does not
work well with Indian languages. Thus, In this paper, we have introduced a
reference-based MT evaluation metric for Gujarati which is based on supervised
learning. We have trained two versions of the metric which uses 25 features for
training. Among the two models, one model is trained using 6 hidden layers with
500 epochs while the other model is trained using 10 hidden layers with 500
epochs. To test the performance of the metric, we collected 1000 MT outputs of
seven MT systems. These MT engine outputs were compared with 1 human reference
translation. While comparing the developed metrics with other available
metrics, it was found that the metrics produced better human correlations.

### [3] [Hallucination is Inevitable for LLMs with the Open World Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05116)
*Bowen Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文将LLM的幻觉问题重新定义为泛化问题，指出在封闭世界假设下幻觉可缓解，但在开放世界假设下幻觉不可避免，建议将其视为需要容忍的结构性特征而非工程缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究要么将幻觉视为需要最小化的工程缺陷，要么论证其理论必然性，但都未能充分考虑AGI所需的条件。本文旨在从泛化问题的角度重新审视幻觉现象。

Method: 通过区分封闭世界和开放世界假设来分析幻觉问题，并开发了幻觉分类法，区分可纠正和不可避免的幻觉类型。

Result: 在开放世界条件下，某些类型的幻觉是不可避免的，这挑战了将幻觉纯粹视为工程缺陷的传统观点。

Conclusion: 幻觉应被视为需要容忍的结构性特征，而非仅仅是要消除的缺陷，需要使其与人类智能相兼容。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive linguistic competence but
also produce inaccurate or fabricated outputs, often called ``hallucinations''.
Engineering approaches usually regard hallucination as a defect to be
minimized, while formal analyses have argued for its theoretical inevitability.
Yet both perspectives remain incomplete when considering the conditions
required for artificial general intelligence (AGI). This paper reframes
``hallucination'' as a manifestation of the generalization problem. Under the
Closed World assumption, where training and test distributions are consistent,
hallucinations may be mitigated. Under the Open World assumption, however,
where the environment is unbounded, hallucinations become inevitable. This
paper further develops a classification of hallucination, distinguishing cases
that may be corrected from those that appear unavoidable under open-world
conditions. On this basis, it suggests that ``hallucination'' should be
approached not merely as an engineering defect but as a structural feature to
be tolerated and made compatible with human intelligence.

### [4] [Towards Structured Knowledge: Advancing Triple Extraction from Regional Trade Agreements using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05121)
*Durgesh Nandini,Rebekka Koch,Mirco Schoenfeld*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究探讨大型语言模型在经济学领域提取结构化知识（主谓宾三元组）的有效性，使用Llama 3.1模型处理区域贸易协定文本，评估零样本、单样本和少样本提示技术的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在经济学应用中提取结构化知识的潜力，特别是从自然语言法律贸易协定文本创建经济贸易知识图谱。

Method: 使用Llama 3.1模型处理非结构化区域贸易协定文本，采用零样本、单样本和少样本提示技术（包含正负示例），基于定量和定性指标评估性能。

Result: 应用模型成功从区域贸易协定文本中提取贸易相关信息三元组，验证了语言模型在经济学应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: 语言模型在经济学应用中具有重要意义，研究揭示了关键见解、挑战和未来发展方向。

Abstract: This study investigates the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
the extraction of structured knowledge in the form of Subject-Predicate-Object
triples. We apply the setup for the domain of Economics application. The
findings can be applied to a wide range of scenarios, including the creation of
economic trade knowledge graphs from natural language legal trade agreement
texts. As a use case, we apply the model to regional trade agreement texts to
extract trade-related information triples. In particular, we explore the
zero-shot, one-shot and few-shot prompting techniques, incorporating positive
and negative examples, and evaluate their performance based on quantitative and
qualitative metrics. Specifically, we used Llama 3.1 model to process the
unstructured regional trade agreement texts and extract triples. We discuss key
insights, challenges, and potential future directions, emphasizing the
significance of language models in economic applications.

### [5] [CARE: Cognitive-reasoning Augmented Reinforcement for Emotional Support Conversation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05122)
*Jie Zhu,Yuanchen Zhou,Shuo Jiang,Junhui Li,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang,Fang Kong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CARE框架通过强化推理过程提升情感支持对话质量，不依赖大规模合成数据，在原有训练集基础上生成逻辑连贯的支持性回复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注数据增强和合成语料构建，但忽视了支撑有效情感支持的深层认知推理过程。

Method: 利用原始ESC训练集引导模型生成逻辑连贯的支持性回复，并采用强化学习进一步优化和强化推理过程。

Result: 实验结果表明CARE显著提升了回复的逻辑合理性和支持质量。

Conclusion: 该框架推动了具有同理心、认知鲁棒性和类人特征的情感支持系统的发展。

Abstract: Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) plays a vital role in alleviating
psychological stress and providing emotional value through dialogue. While
recent studies have largely focused on data augmentation and synthetic corpus
construction, they often overlook the deeper cognitive reasoning processes that
underpin effective emotional support. To address this gap, we propose
\textbf{CARE}, a novel framework that strengthens reasoning in ESC without
relying on large-scale synthetic data. CARE leverages the original ESC training
set to guide models in generating logically coherent and supportive responses,
thereby explicitly enhancing cognitive reasoning. Building on this foundation,
we further employ reinforcement learning to refine and reinforce the reasoning
process. Experimental results demonstrate that CARE significantly improves both
the logical soundness and supportive quality of responses, advancing the
development of empathetic, cognitively robust, and human-like emotional support
systems.

### [6] [MADS: Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation for Diverse Persuasion Data Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05124)
*Mingjin Li,Yu Liu,Huayi Liu,Xiang Ye,Chao Jiang,Hongguang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: MADS是一个通过智能体自我博弈生成说服性多轮对话的可扩展框架，包含用户代理、对话代理和优化代理，无需人工标注即可生成训练数据，在实际营销场景中显著提升了小模型的转化率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行业关键挑战：缺乏用户数据、冷启动评估困难和提示效率低下，通过低成本生成训练数据来提升说服能力。

Method: 采用三个协调代理：模拟多样化人物行为的用户代理、执行任务导向说服策略的对话代理、评估优化对话结果的优化代理，结合用户态度链建模和专用LLM评估。

Result: 在实际营销场景中，MADS显著提升了小LLM的说服能力，有机流量转化率从1.83%提升至2.24%，增长了22.4%。

Conclusion: MADS框架能够有效解决数据稀缺问题，通过智能体自我博弈生成高质量对话数据，在真实业务场景中展现出明确商业价值。

Abstract: We propose MADS (Multi-Agent Dialogue Simulation), a scalable framework for
generating persuasive multi-turn dialogues via agent self-play. MADS employs
three coordinated agents: User Agents simulating diverse persona-driven
behaviors, a Dialog Agent executing task-oriented persuasion strategies and an
Optimization Agent evaluating and refining dialogue outcomes. We further
validate its effectiveness through users' Chain-of-Attitude (CoA) modeling and
dedicated LLMs' persuasion assessment. This approach enables low-cost
generation of training data without human annotation, addressing key industry
challenges such as lack of user data, cold-start evaluation difficulties, and
prompt inefficiency. Applied to a real-world marketing scenario, MADS
significantly improved the persuasion capacity of small LLMs, increasing the
organic traffic conversion rate by 22.4\% (from 1.83\% to 2.24\%) ,
demonstrating clear business value.

### [7] [Catalog-Native LLM: Speaking Item-ID Dialect with Less Entanglement for Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05125)
*Reza Shirkavand,Xiaokai Wei,Chen Wang,Zheng Hui,Heng Huang,Michelle Gong*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: IDIOMoE模型将物品交互历史视为语言空间中的原生方言，通过混合专家架构在预训练LLM中分离文本专家和物品专家，实现协同过滤信号与自然语言的统一理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统需要结合协同过滤的预测准确性和LLM的表达推理能力，满足用户对自然语言查询和透明解释的期望，但协同信号语义不透明而LLM难以建模隐式用户偏好。

Method: 在预训练LLM的每个块中将前馈网络分离为文本专家和物品专家，通过token类型门控避免模态间干扰，将物品交互历史作为语言空间中的方言处理。

Result: 在公开和专有数据集上展现出强大的推荐性能，同时保持了预训练模型的文本理解能力。

Conclusion: IDIOMoE成功统一了协同过滤和LLM的优势，为现代推荐系统提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While collaborative filtering delivers predictive accuracy and efficiency,
and Large Language Models (LLMs) enable expressive and generalizable reasoning,
modern recommendation systems must bring these strengths together. Growing user
expectations, such as natural-language queries and transparent explanations,
further highlight the need for a unified approach. However, doing so is
nontrivial. Collaborative signals are often token-efficient but semantically
opaque, while LLMs are semantically rich but struggle to model implicit user
preferences when trained only on textual inputs. This paper introduces Item-ID
+ Oral-language Mixture-of-Experts Language Model (IDIOMoE), which treats item
interaction histories as a native dialect within the language space, enabling
collaborative signals to be understood in the same way as natural language. By
splitting the Feed Forward Network of each block of a pretrained LLM into a
separate text expert and an item expert with token-type gating, our method
avoids destructive interference between text and catalog modalities. IDIOMoE
demonstrates strong recommendation performance across both public and
proprietary datasets, while preserving the text understanding of the pretrained
model.

### [8] [Improving Metacognition and Uncertainty Communication in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05126)
*Mark Steyvers,Catarina Belem,Padhraic Smyth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 通过监督微调可以改善大型语言模型的不确定性表达能力，但不同元认知技能需要多任务训练才能共同提升，单一任务训练无法相互迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在决策场景中应用日益广泛，但缺乏有效的不确定性表达机制，用户可能在不自知的情况下依赖错误输出。

Method: 在通用知识、数学和开放式问答数据集上对LLMs进行微调，评估两种元认知任务：单问题置信度估计和成对置信度比较，并测试在医疗和法律推理等未见领域的泛化能力。

Result: 微调改善了校准（置信度与准确性的对齐）和区分能力（正确回答的置信度更高），同时保持准确性不变。多任务微调在跨域评估中产生更广泛的改进。

Conclusion: LLMs的不确定性表达能力是可训练和可泛化的，但不同元认知技能不会自然相互强化，必须通过多任务训练共同发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in decision-making
contexts, but when they present answers without signaling low confidence, users
may unknowingly act on erroneous outputs. While prior work shows that LLMs
maintain internal uncertainty signals, their explicit verbalized confidence is
typically miscalibrated and poorly discriminates between correct and incorrect
answers. Across two types of LLMs, we investigate whether supervised finetuning
can improve models' ability to communicate uncertainty and whether such
improvements generalize across tasks and domains. We finetune the LLMs on
datasets spanning general knowledge, mathematics, and open-ended trivia, and
evaluate two metacognitive tasks: (1) single-question confidence estimation,
where the model assigns a numeric certainty to its answer, and (2) pairwise
confidence comparison, where the model selects which of two answers it is more
likely to have correct. We assess generalization to unseen domains, including
medical and legal reasoning. Results show that finetuning improves calibration
(alignment between stated confidence and accuracy) and discrimination (higher
confidence for correct vs. incorrect responses) within and across domains,
while leaving accuracy unchanged. However, improvements are task-specific:
training on single-question calibration does not transfer to pairwise
comparison, and vice versa. In contrast, multitask finetuning on both forms of
metacognition yields broader gains, producing lower calibration error and
stronger discrimination in out-of-domain evaluations. These results show that
while uncertainty communication in LLMs is trainable and generalizable,
different metacognitive skills do not naturally reinforce one another and must
be developed together through multitask training.

*Si-Ioi Ng,Pranav S. Ambadi,Kimberly D. Mueller,Julie Liss,Visar Berisha*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于BERT的自动化管道，用于从Cookie Theft图片描述中提取和排序内容信息单元(CIUs)，以评估认知语言障碍。该方法在CIU检测上达到93%精确度和96%召回率，超越基于字典的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通过图片描述自动评估认知语言障碍的方法往往忽视视觉叙事路径，即说话者在图片中描述元素的顺序和位置。传统的手动标记或基于字典的映射方法劳动密集且效率低。

Method: 使用基于BERT的管道，通过二元交叉熵和成对排序损失进行微调，自动化提取和排序Cookie Theft图片描述中的CIUs。采用5折交叉验证进行评估。

Result: 在CIU检测方面达到93%中位数精确度和96%中位数召回率，序列错误率为24%。提取的特征与真实值具有强Pearson相关性，在外部验证中超越基于字典的基线方法。

Conclusion: 该管道能有效表征视觉叙事路径用于认知障碍评估，实现和模型已开源，为自动化认知语言评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Current methods for automated assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment
via picture description often neglect the visual narrative path - the sequence
and locations of elements a speaker described in the picture. Analyses of
spatio-semantic features capture this path using content information units
(CIUs), but manual tagging or dictionary-based mapping is labor-intensive. This
study proposes a BERT-based pipeline, fine tuned with binary cross-entropy and
pairwise ranking loss, for automated CIU extraction and ordering from the
Cookie Theft picture description. Evaluated by 5-fold cross-validation, it
achieves 93% median precision, 96% median recall in CIU detection, and 24%
sequence error rates. The proposed method extracts features that exhibit strong
Pearson correlations with ground truth, surpassing the dictionary-based
baseline in external validation. These features also perform comparably to
those derived from manual annotations in evaluating group differences via
ANCOVA. The pipeline is shown to effectively characterize visual narrative
paths for cognitive impairment assessment, with the implementation and models
open-sourced to public.

*Qingshu Xu,Hong Jiao,Tianyi Zhou,Ming Li,Nan Zhang,Sydney Peters,Yanbin Fu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了三种自动对齐项目与内容标准的方法：基于嵌入的经典机器学习、BERT模型微调以及集成学习。DeBERTa-v3-base在领域对齐中表现最佳，RoBERTa-large在技能对齐中表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模评估中，项目与内容标准的准确对齐对于分数解释的有效性至关重要。

Method: 1. 提取嵌入并训练经典监督机器学习模型，研究降维对性能的影响；2. 微调8个BERT模型及其变体进行领域和技能对齐；3. 探索多数投票和堆叠的集成学习方法。

Result: DeBERTa-v3-base在领域对齐中获得最高加权平均F1分数0.950，RoBERTa-large在技能对齐中获得最高F1分数0.869。集成模型未超过最佳语言模型，降维提升了基于嵌入的线性分类器但不如语言模型。

Conclusion: 本研究展示了自动项目对齐到内容标准的不同方法，证明了语言模型在此任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Accurate alignment of items to content standards is critical for valid score
interpretation in large-scale assessments. This study evaluates three automated
paradigms for aligning items with four domain and nineteen skill labels. First,
we extracted embeddings and trained multiple classical supervised machine
learning models, and further investigated the impact of dimensionality
reduction on model performance. Second, we fine-tuned eight BERT model and its
variants for both domain and skill alignment. Third, we explored ensemble
learning with majority voting and stacking with multiple meta-models. The
DeBERTa-v3-base achieved the highest weighted-average F1 score of 0.950 for
domain alignment while the RoBERTa-large yielded the highest F1 score of 0.869
for skill alignment. Ensemble models did not surpass the best-performing
language models. Dimension reduction enhanced linear classifiers based on
embeddings but did not perform better than language models. This study
demonstrated different methods in automated item alignment to content
standards.}

### [11] [Submodular Context Partitioning and Compression for In-Context Learning-short paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05130)
*Shaoyi Zheng,Canyu Zhang,Tianyi Zhou,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Sub-CP是一个基于子模优化的块感知上下文选择框架，通过控制块多样性来解决ICL中信息冗余和表示不足的问题，支持从全局多样性到局部一致性的灵活选择策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的高效ICL方法在处理长上下文时采用分块策略，但忽略了不同分块策略导致的信息冗余或表示不足问题，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出Sub-CP框架，利用子模目标函数控制块多样性，支持从全局多样性到局部一致性的连续谱选择策略，同时支持预计算。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Sub-CP在不同模型规模下都能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: Sub-CP通过精细控制语义结构，有效解决了ICL中的上下文选择问题，为高效few-shot学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables efficient few-shot learning in large
language models (LLMs) without training, but suffers from the quadratic input
complexity of transformers, limiting the maximum number of exemplars. While
various efficient ICL approaches partition the context into blocks to process
(e.g., ensembling, compression, cross-attention), they often ignore the
information redundancy or under-representation caused by different partition
strategies, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle this problem, we
propose Sub-CP, a block-aware context selection framework that leverages
submodular objectives to control block diversity. Sub-CP supports a flexible
spectrum of selection strategies, allowing each block to range from globally
diverse to locally coherent. This allows fine-grained control over semantic
structure while enabling precomputation. Extensive experiments across diverse
tasks on multiple datasets show that Sub-CP consistently improves performance
across model scales.

*Bowen Wei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出混合语义搜索系统解决Head Start项目中GoEngage平台的任务查找困难，结合词法检索、向量相似度和LLM重排序，确保可信度、可演进性和经济效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Head Start项目使用GoEngage平台时，新员工或轮岗员工难以在主页找到合适任务，原因包括领域特定术语、系统特定命名以及词法搜索在处理拼写错误和词序变化时的局限性。

Method: 采用混合语义搜索系统，结合轻量级容错词法检索、基于嵌入的向量相似度和受限大语言模型重排序，利用现有任务库和知识库基础设施，通过智能缓存、短列表生成和优雅降级机制确保经济效率。

Result: 提供了完整框架，包括所需资源、分阶段实施策略、离线评估协议（使用Hit@K、Precision@K、Recall@K、MRR等指标）和在线测量方法（查询成功率、零结果率、停留时间代理）。

Conclusion: 该混合搜索系统能有效解决任务查找问题，同时确保系统的可信度、可演进性和成本效益。

Abstract: Head Start programs utilizing GoEngage face significant challenges when new
or rotating staff attempt to locate appropriate Tasks (modules) on the platform
homepage. These difficulties arise from domain-specific jargon (e.g., IFPA,
DRDP), system-specific nomenclature (e.g., Application Pool), and the inherent
limitations of lexical search in handling typos and varied word ordering. We
propose a pragmatic hybrid semantic search system that synergistically combines
lightweight typo-tolerant lexical retrieval, embedding-based vector similarity,
and constrained large language model (LLM) re-ranking. Our approach leverages
the organization's existing Task Repository and Knowledge Base infrastructure
while ensuring trustworthiness through low false-positive rates, evolvability
to accommodate terminological changes, and economic efficiency via intelligent
caching, shortlist generation, and graceful degradation mechanisms. We provide
a comprehensive framework detailing required resources, a phased implementation
strategy with concrete milestones, an offline evaluation protocol utilizing
curated test cases (Hit@K, Precision@K, Recall@K, MRR), and an online
measurement methodology incorporating query success metrics, zero-result rates,
and dwell-time proxies.

### [13] [Training Large Language Models To Reason In Parallel With Global Forking Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05132)
*Sheng Jia,Xiao Wang,Shiva Prasad Kasiviswanathan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT)方法，通过将并行推理视为集合预测问题，在SFT中引入基于集合的全局损失，以解决多样化与准确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs通过扩展并行测试时计算提升性能，但需要生成既多样化又准确的推理路径。对于复杂问题，触发多样化正确推理模式的分叉标记通常位于采样树深处，传统方法如温度缩放面临多样化与准确性之间的权衡恶化。

Method: 将并行推理视为集合预测问题，在监督微调中引入基于集合的全局损失，使用自监督二分匹配将全局分叉标记与唯一推理轨迹对应。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，SSFT在Pass@1和Cons@k指标上始终优于标准SFT，能够保留独特推理模式并产生涌现的全局分叉标记。

Conclusion: SSFT方法有效解决了推理多样性与准确性之间的权衡问题，相比传统SFT具有更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Although LLMs have demonstrated improved performance by scaling parallel
test-time compute, doing so relies on generating reasoning paths that are both
diverse and accurate. For challenging problems, the forking tokens that trigger
diverse yet correct reasoning modes are typically deep in the sampling tree.
Consequently, common strategies to encourage diversity, such as temperature
scaling, encounter a worsened trade-off between diversity and accuracy.
Motivated by this challenge, we treat parallel reasoning as a
set-of-next-token-prediction problem, and incorporate a set-based global loss
into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using self-supervised bipartite matching
between our global forking tokens and unique reasoning traces. We observe that,
while naive fine-tuning with multiple reasoning traces collapses these unique
reasoning modes, our proposed method, Set Supervised Fine-Tuning (SSFT),
preserves these modes and produces emergent global forking tokens. Experiments
on multiple reasoning benchmarks show that our SSFT consistently outperforms
SFT under both Pass@1 and Cons@k metrics.

### [14] [Characterizing Model Behavior Under Synthetic Data Training: An Empirical Study Across Scales and Mixing Ratios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05133)
*Y. Du,G. Wu,G. Tang,W. Wang,Q. Fan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究了合成数据比例对模型性能的影响，发现在20%合成数据内模型表现稳定，超过30%会加速性能下降，大模型比小模型更稳健，校准退化先于准确率下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然合成数据在现代NLP训练中广泛应用，但系统性地理解合成数据比例如何影响不同规模模型的行为仍然有限。

Method: 使用Pythia模型套件（410M-12B参数）在五个不同任务上进行控制实验，评估模型在合成数据比例0-50%范围内经过1-3次训练迭代后的表现。

Result: 模型在20%合成数据内保持稳定性能，超过30%性能加速下降；大模型（6.9B-12B）比小模型（410M-1.4B）对合成数据更稳健；校准退化先于准确率损失；推理任务比检索任务在合成数据训练下退化更快。

Conclusion: 当前最佳实践（如STaR和Self-Instruct系统保持超过80%外部数据）处于安全范围内，为从业者提供了基于模型规模和任务需求的合成数据预算指导。

Abstract: Synthetic data generated by large language models has become integral to
modern NLP training pipelines, from bootstrapping reasoning capabilities to
augmenting instruction-following datasets. While recent work demonstrates
successful applications maintaining high external data ratios, systematic
understanding of how synthetic data proportion affects model behavior across
different scales remains limited. This paper presents a controlled empirical
study examining model performance, calibration, and output characteristics when
trained on varying synthetic-to-external data ratios. Using the Pythia model
suite (410M-12B parameters) across five diverse tasks, we evaluate models after
one to three training iterations with synthetic data proportions ranging from
0-50\%. Our key findings include: models maintain stable performance with up to
20\% synthetic data, but degradation accelerates beyond 30\%; larger models
(6.9B-12B) show greater robustness to synthetic data than smaller models
(410M-1.4B); calibration degradation precedes accuracy loss, providing an early
warning signal; and task characteristics matter, with reasoning tasks degrading
faster than retrieval tasks under synthetic data training. Importantly, we find
that current best practices, such as those employed in STaR and Self-Instruct
systems that maintain greater than 80\% external data, operate well within safe
regimes identified by our experiments. We provide practical guidance for
practitioners on synthetic data budgets based on model scale and task
requirements, alongside detailed comparison with concurrent work including
Shumailov et al.'s model collapse findings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于好奇心的LLM评估方法，用于个性化评估创意写作，在主观性强的创造力评估任务中表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大语言模型在客观任务上表现出色，但在评估创造力等主观任务时表现不佳，需要个性化评估方法。

Method: 使用好奇心驱动的LLM作为评估者，基于Torrance创造性思维测试基准，学习不同个体的创造性判断。

Result: 在不同模型规模上均优于监督微调基线方法，在皮尔逊相关性、Cohen's和F1值等指标上有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适用于标注者之间存在分歧的主观评估场景，能够有效学习个体的创造性判断偏好。

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) excel at objective tasks such as
evaluating mathematical reasoning and factual accuracy, yet they falter when
faced with the nuanced, subjective nature of assessing creativity. In this
work, we propose a novel curiosity-driven LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating
creative writing which is personlized to each individual's creative judgments.
We use the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking(TTCW) benchmark introduced in
Chakrabarty et al. (2024), which has stories annotated by expert humans across
various subjective dimensions like Originality, to test our hypothesis. We show
that our method enables models across various sizes, to learn the nuanced
creative judgments of different individuals, by showing improvements over
baseline supervised finetuning(SFT) method across various evaluation metrics
like Pearson correlation, Cohen's and F1 values. Our method is especially
useful in subjective evaluations where not all the annotators agree with each
other.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇综述论文系统梳理了AI生成文本的语言特征研究现状，发现AI文本通常更正式、非个人化，词汇多样性较低，但当前研究主要集中在英语和GPT模型上，需要更广泛的跨语言和跨模型研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在各领域的广泛应用，研究AI生成文本的语言特征对于语料库语言学、计算语言学和自然语言处理等领域具有重要意义，需要对现有发现进行系统性综合。

Method: 通过分类现有研究，包括语言描述层次、模型类型、文本体裁、语言种类和提示方法等维度，对现有研究成果进行系统性梳理。

Result: AI生成文本更可能包含更正式和非个人化的风格，表现为名词、限定词和介词使用增加，形容词和副词使用减少；词汇多样性较低，词汇量较小，文本重复性较高。

Conclusion: 当前研究主要集中在英语数据和GPT模型上，存在跨语言和跨模型研究的不足，且多数研究未充分考虑提示敏感性，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are solidifying their position in the modern
world as effective tools for the automatic generation of text. Their use is
quickly becoming commonplace in fields such as education, healthcare, and
scientific research. There is a growing need to study the linguistic features
present in AI-generated text, as the increasing presence of such texts has
profound implications in various disciplines such as corpus linguistics,
computational linguistics, and natural language processing. Many observations
have already been made, however a broader synthesis of the findings made so far
is required to provide a better understanding of the topic. The present survey
paper aims to provide such a synthesis of extant research. We categorize the
existing works along several dimensions, including the levels of linguistic
description, the models included, the genres analyzed, the languages analyzed,
and the approach to prompting. Additionally, the same scheme is used to present
the findings made so far and expose the current trends followed by researchers.
Among the most-often reported findings is the observation that AI-generated
text is more likely to contain a more formal and impersonal style, signaled by
the increased presence of nouns, determiners, and adpositions and the lower
reliance on adjectives and adverbs. AI-generated text is also more likely to
feature a lower lexical diversity, a smaller vocabulary size, and repetitive
text. Current research, however, remains heavily concentrated on English data
and mostly on text generated by the GPT model family, highlighting the need for
broader cross-linguistic and cross-model investigation. In most cases authors
also fail to address the issue of prompt sensitivity, leaving much room for
future studies that employ multiple prompt wordings in the text generation
phase.

*Maojia Song,Renhang Liu,Xinyu Wang,Yong Jiang,Pengjun Xie,Fei Huang,Soujanya Poria,Jingren Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: WebDetective是一个新的多跳深度搜索基准测试，解决了现有基准测试中推理路径泄露和单一通过率评估的问题，通过无提示问题和可控维基百科沙盒提供完整可追溯性，并采用分离搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为的评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG系统和网络代理在多跳深度搜索任务评估中存在两个主要问题：基准测试在问题文本中泄露推理路径，导致模型依赖表面线索而非自主发现推理链；评估通常简化为单一通过率，无法区分失败原因（搜索不足、知识利用差或不恰当拒绝）。

Method: 开发了WebDetective基准测试，包含无提示多跳问题、可控维基百科沙盒确保模型行为完全可追溯，以及分离搜索充分性、知识利用和拒绝行为的整体评估框架。评估了25个最先进模型，并开发了EvidenceLoop代理工作流程。

Result: 评估显示所有架构模型存在系统性弱点：尽管有足够证据，模型在知识利用方面仍表现不佳；当证据不足时，几乎不会适当拒绝。这表明当前系统擅长执行给定推理路径，但在需要自主发现推理路径时失败。

Conclusion: WebDetective的诊断框架能够指导具体的架构改进，EvidenceLoop基线证明该基准测试是开发真正自主推理系统而非模式跟随代理的关键工具。

Abstract: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems and web agents are increasingly
evaluated on multi-hop deep search tasks, yet current practice suffers from two
major limitations. First, most benchmarks leak the reasoning path in the
question text, allowing models to follow surface cues rather than discover
reasoning chains autonomously. Second, evaluation is typically reduced to a
single pass rate, which collapses diverse behaviours into one score and
obscures whether failures stem from inadequate search, poor knowledge use, or
inappropriate refusal. To address these issues, we present WebDetective, a
benchmark of hint-free multi-hop questions paired with a controlled Wikipedia
sandbox that ensures full traceability of model actions, and a holistic
evaluation framework that separates search sufficiency, knowledge utilisation,
and refusal behaviour. Our evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art models reveals
systematic weaknesses across all architectures: models struggle with knowledge
utilisation despite having sufficient evidence and demonstrate near-absent
appropriate refusal when evidence is lacking. These patterns expose a
fundamental gap: today's systems excel at executing given reasoning paths but
fail when required to discover them. We develop an agentic workflow,
EvidenceLoop, that explicitly targets the challenges our benchmark identifies,
incorporating verification loops and systematic evidence tracking that improve
both search and synthesis capabilities. This baseline demonstrates that
WebDetective's diagnostic framework can guide concrete architectural
improvements, establishing our benchmark as a critical tool for developing
genuinely autonomous reasoning systems rather than pattern-following agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献快速增长使得保持文献综述的全面性和时效性变得困难，现有工作主要关注检索和筛选自动化，而写作阶段特别是可读性和事实准确性方面研究不足。

Method: 采用多智能体协作工作流，包含内容规划、子章节写作、编辑和审阅等专门智能体，模拟人类文献综述过程。

Result: 在SciReviewGen和ScienceDirect数据集上评估，LiRA在写作和引用质量上优于AutoSurvey和MASS-Survey等基线方法，同时保持与人工撰写综述的竞争力。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，即使没有领域特定调优，智能体化LLM工作流也能提高自动化科学写作的可靠性和可用性。

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific publications has made it increasingly
difficult to keep literature reviews comprehensive and up-to-date. Though prior
work has focused on automating retrieval and screening, the writing phase of
systematic reviews remains largely under-explored, especially with regard to
readability and factual accuracy. To address this, we present LiRA (Literature
Review Agents), a multi-agent collaborative workflow which emulates the human
literature review process. LiRA utilizes specialized agents for content
outlining, subsection writing, editing, and reviewing, producing cohesive and
comprehensive review articles. Evaluated on SciReviewGen and a proprietary
ScienceDirect dataset, LiRA outperforms current baselines such as AutoSurvey
and MASS-Survey in writing and citation quality, while maintaining competitive
similarity to human-written reviews. We further evaluate LiRA in real-world
scenarios using document retrieval and assess its robustness to reviewer model
variation. Our findings highlight the potential of agentic LLM workflows, even
without domain-specific tuning, to improve the reliability and usability of
automated scientific writing.

TL;DR: 提出了NLD-LLM框架，用于评估语言模型生成源代码描述的能力，发现精心设计的提示工程能让较小模型表现接近大型模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要系统评估语言模型在自然语言描述任务中的表现，特别是生成准确简洁的源代码描述的能力。

Method: 构建包含多种transformer模型的评估框架，采用标准化提示设计策略和迭代优化过程，使用语义和结构指标进行分析。

Result: 提示工程显著影响模型效果，精心设计的提示能让较小模型（如Qwen、DeepSeek、Phi等）表现具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 提示工程在自然语言描述任务中至关重要，适当的设计可让较小模型达到与大型模型相当的性能。

Abstract: Natural Language Description (NLD) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP)
task that requires models to generate structured and meaningful outputs from
natural language inputs. In this work, we propose NLD-LLM, a systematic NLP
framework to evaluate the performance of language models to generate accurate
and concise source code descriptions. This framework incorporates a diverse set
of transformer models, including Qwen, DeepSeek, Phi, LLaMA, and Mistral,
spanning various sizes, architectures, and training approaches. Central to
NLD-LLM is a comprehensive prompt design strategy that includes standardized
formatting, clear task guidance, and NLD prompting, ensuring fair and
consistent evaluation. Additionally, we apply an iterative refinement process
to improve output's quality and assess the model's adaptability. Using semantic
and structural metrics, our analysis demonstrates that prompt engineering
significantly impacts the effectiveness of the model such that smaller models
often performing competitively when supported by well-crafted prompts.

*Byung-Doh Oh,Tal Linzen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大型语言模型在预测下一个词方面比人类更准确，导致它们低估了人类阅读时的处理难度，这种'超人类'能力主要源于更强的长期和短期记忆。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型作为人类语言预测认知模型的适用性，发现随着模型预测能力的提升，它们模拟人类阅读行为的能力反而下降。

Method: 分析LLMs与人类在语言预测方面的差异，识别导致'超人类'表现的两个主要因素：更强的长期事实记忆和短期文本记忆。

Result: 主流LLMs在语言理解方面表现出'超人类'特征，预测的处理难度低于实际人类实验观察值。

Conclusion: 需要开发具有人类水平长期和短期记忆的模型，并指出当前人类数据不足以衡量这一目标的进展，建议开展新的人类实验。

Abstract: When people listen to or read a sentence, they actively make predictions
about upcoming words: words that are less predictable are generally read more
slowly than predictable ones. The success of large language models (LLMs),
which, like humans, make predictions about upcoming words, has motivated
exploring the use of these models as cognitive models of human linguistic
prediction. Surprisingly, in the last few years, as language models have become
better at predicting the next word, their ability to predict human reading
behavior has declined. This is because LLMs are able to predict upcoming words
much better than people can, leading them to predict lower processing
difficulty in reading than observed in human experiments; in other words,
mainstream LLMs are 'superhuman' as models of language comprehension. In this
position paper, we argue that LLMs' superhumanness is primarily driven by two
factors: compared to humans, LLMs have much stronger long-term memory for facts
and training examples, and they have much better short-term memory for previous
words in the text. We advocate for creating models that have human-like
long-term and short-term memory, and outline some possible directions for
achieving this goal. Finally, we argue that currently available human data is
insufficient to measure progress towards this goal, and outline human
experiments that can address this gap.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出基于大语言模型的多阶段信息提取流程，从实验报告中捕获47个材料特征，涵盖成分、加工、微观结构和性能，实现高精度文献挖掘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决材料发现中大量信息被困在非结构化文献中的问题，现有提取方法特征有限且未整合成分-加工-微观结构-性能关系，阻碍构建综合数据库。

Method: 采用多阶段信息提取流程，集成迭代提取与来源追踪，使用大语言模型从实验报告材料中提取47个特征。

Result: 特征级和元组级F1分数约0.96，微观结构类别F1分数提升10.0-13.7%，漏检率从12.4%降至3.3%，实现高精度、低遗漏、零误报。

Conclusion: 该流程支持可扩展高效的文献挖掘，为机器学习和材料信息学提供可信数据输入，模块化设计适用于多种材料类别。

Abstract: Data-driven materials discovery requires large-scale experimental datasets,
yet most of the information remains trapped in unstructured literature.
Existing extraction efforts often focus on a limited set of features and have
not addressed the integrated composition-processing-microstructure-property
relationships essential for understanding materials behavior, thereby posing
challenges for building comprehensive databases. To address this gap, we
propose a multi-stage information extraction pipeline powered by large language
models, which captures 47 features spanning composition, processing,
microstructure, and properties exclusively from experimentally reported
materials. The pipeline integrates iterative extraction with source tracking to
enhance both accuracy and reliability. Evaluations at the feature level
(independent attributes) and tuple level (interdependent features) yielded F1
scores around 0.96. Compared with single-pass extraction without source
tracking, our approach improved F1 scores of microstructure category by 10.0%
(feature level) and 13.7% (tuple level), and reduced missed materials from 49
to 13 out of 396 materials in 100 articles on precipitate-containing
multi-principal element alloys (miss rate reduced from 12.4% to 3.3%). The
pipeline enables scalable and efficient literature mining, producing databases
with high precision, minimal omissions, and zero false positives. These
datasets provide trustworthy inputs for machine learning and materials
informatics, while the modular design generalizes to diverse material classes,
enabling comprehensive materials information extraction.

TL;DR: SynCED-EnDe是一个新的英德机器翻译关键错误检测数据集，包含1000个黄金标注和8000个白银标注句子对，平衡了错误和非错误案例，提供细粒度错误分析和基准性能提升。


<details>

Motivation: 解决WMT21英德CED数据集在规模、标签平衡、领域覆盖和时间新鲜度方面的局限性，推动机器翻译在信息检索和对话助手等应用中的安全部署。

Method: 构建包含2024-2025年多样化来源（StackExchange、GOV.UK）的数据集，引入显式错误子类、结构化触发标志和细粒度辅助判断（明显性、严重性、定位复杂性、上下文依赖性、充分性偏差）。

Result: 基准实验显示XLM-R及相关编码器相比WMT21有显著性能提升，主要得益于平衡标签和精细化标注。

Conclusion: SynCED-EnDe作为社区资源，将推动机器翻译在可穿戴AI设备等新兴场景中的安全部署，支持超越二元检测的系统性错误风险分析。

Abstract: Critical Error Detection (CED) in machine translation aims to determine
whether a translation is safe to use or contains unacceptable deviations in
meaning. While the WMT21 English-German CED dataset provided the first
benchmark, it is limited in scale, label balance, domain coverage, and temporal
freshness. We present SynCED-EnDe, a new resource consisting of 1,000
gold-labeled and 8,000 silver-labeled sentence pairs, balanced 50/50 between
error and non-error cases. SynCED-EnDe draws from diverse 2024-2025 sources
(StackExchange, GOV.UK) and introduces explicit error subclasses, structured
trigger flags, and fine-grained auxiliary judgments (obviousness, severity,
localization complexity, contextual dependency, adequacy deviation). These
enrichments enable systematic analyses of error risk and intricacy beyond
binary detection. The dataset is permanently hosted on GitHub and Hugging Face,
accompanied by documentation, annotation guidelines, and baseline scripts.
Benchmark experiments with XLM-R and related encoders show substantial
performance gains over WMT21 due to balanced labels and refined annotations. We
envision SynCED-EnDe as a community resource to advance safe deployment of MT
in information retrieval and conversational assistants, particularly in
emerging contexts such as wearable AI devices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于离散扩散大语言模型解码轨迹的模型归属方法，通过构建有向解码图和基于高斯分布的轨迹归属分析，有效解决了不同模型及同一模型不同检查点之间的归属识别问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散大语言模型(dLLMs)的解码机制不仅提升了模型性能，还能作为模型归属识别的有力工具。当前归属识别面临多种场景的挑战，包括区分不同模型以及同一模型的不同检查点。

Method: 提出有向解码图(DDM)来捕捉解码步骤间的结构关系，揭示模型特定行为；并设计高斯轨迹归属(GTA)方法，在每个解码位置为每个目标模型拟合单元高斯分布，通过轨迹的似然度作为归属得分。

Result: 在不同设置下的广泛实验验证了所提方法的有效性，能够准确识别模型归属。

Conclusion: 离散扩散大语言模型的解码轨迹可作为模型归属识别的有效特征，提出的DDM和GTA方法在不同归属场景下均表现出色。

Abstract: Discrete Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a
competitive paradigm for non-autoregressive language modeling. Their
distinctive decoding mechanism enables faster inference speed and strong
performance in code generation and mathematical tasks. In this work, we show
that the decoding mechanism of dLLMs not only enhances model utility but also
can be used as a powerful tool for model attribution. A key challenge in this
problem lies in the diversity of attribution scenarios, including
distinguishing between different models as well as between different
checkpoints or backups of the same model. To ensure broad applicability, we
identify two fundamental problems: what information to extract from the
decoding trajectory, and how to utilize it effectively. We first observe that
relying directly on per-step model confidence yields poor performance. This is
mainly due to the bidirectional decoding nature of dLLMs: each newly decoded
token influences the confidence of other decoded tokens, making model
confidence highly redundant and washing out structural signal regarding
decoding order or dependencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel
information extraction scheme called the Directed Decoding Map (DDM), which
captures structural relationships between decoding steps and better reveals
model-specific behaviors. Furthermore, to make full use of the extracted
structural information during attribution, we propose Gaussian-Trajectory
Attribution (GTA), where we fit a cell-wise Gaussian distribution at each
decoding position for each target model, and define the likelihood of a
trajectory as the attribution score: if a trajectory exhibits higher
log-likelihood under the distribution of a specific model, it is more likely to
have been generated by that model. Extensive experiments under different
settings validate the utility of our methods.

TL;DR: 提出了时序思考机制，一种用于全双工语音对话模型的实时思考方法，在倾听阶段进行轻量级推理，提高响应质量而不增加延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有全双工系统在倾听阶段只是重复预测静音标记，这与人类在对话中进行轻量思考的行为不符，需要更自然的交互方式。

Method: 时序思考机制：1）严格因果性：在倾听时增量推理，仅基于过去音频更新假设；2）无额外延迟：推理在倾听窗口内摊销，用户停止说话后立即响应。

Result: 实验通过客观指标和人工评估显示响应质量持续提升，同时能稳健处理对话动态变化，在全双工交互指标上达到竞争性表现。

Conclusion: 时序思考机制为全双工语音对话模型提供了更自然的思考范式，在不增加延迟的情况下显著提升了响应质量和交互体验。

Abstract: Recent advances in spoken dialogue language models (SDLMs) reflect growing
interest in shifting from turn-based to full-duplex systems, where the models
continuously perceive user speech streams while generating responses. This
simultaneous listening and speaking design enables real-time interaction and
the agent can handle dynamic conversational behaviors like user barge-in.
However, during the listening phase, existing systems keep the agent idle by
repeatedly predicting the silence token, which departs from human behavior: we
usually engage in lightweight thinking during conversation rather than
remaining absent-minded. Inspired by this, we propose Chronological Thinking, a
on-the-fly conversational thinking mechanism that aims to improve response
quality in full-duplex SDLMs. Specifically, chronological thinking presents a
paradigm shift from conventional LLM thinking approaches, such as
Chain-of-Thought, purpose-built for streaming acoustic input. (1) Strictly
causal: the agent reasons incrementally while listening, updating internal
hypotheses only from past audio with no lookahead. (2) No additional latency:
reasoning is amortized during the listening window; once the user stops
speaking, the agent halts thinking and begins speaking without further delay.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of chronological thinking through
both objective metrics and human evaluations show consistent improvements in
response quality. Furthermore, chronological thinking robustly handles
conversational dynamics and attains competitive performance on full-duplex
interaction metrics.

Motivation: 认识到金融应用对准确性、可靠性和领域适配的严格要求，需要专门评估金融LLMs的设计和性能。

Method: 通过PIXIU框架创建FinMA模型，使用金融指令调优数据集进行指令调优，并在FLARE基准下进行评估。

Result: FinMA在情感分析和分类任务中表现良好，但在数值推理、实体识别和摘要生成方面存在显著困难。

Conclusion: 这项工作旨在推进对金融LLMs如何有效设计和评估的理解，以辅助金融相关决策过程。

Abstract: This research explores the strengths and weaknesses of domain-adapted Large
Language Models (LLMs) in the context of financial natural language processing
(NLP). The analysis centers on FinMA, a model created within the PIXIU
framework, which is evaluated for its performance in specialized financial
tasks. Recognizing the critical demands of accuracy, reliability, and domain
adaptation in financial applications, this study examines FinMA's model
architecture, its instruction tuning process utilizing the Financial
Instruction Tuning (FIT) dataset, and its evaluation under the FLARE benchmark.
Findings indicate that FinMA performs well in sentiment analysis and
classification, but faces notable challenges in tasks involving numerical
reasoning, entity recognition, and summarization. This work aims to advance the
understanding of how financial LLMs can be effectively designed and evaluated
to assist in finance-related decision-making processes.

TL;DR: 研究发现，在大型语言模型评估中，示例之间的分隔符选择对模型性能有显著影响，不同分隔符可导致MMLU性能±23%的波动，甚至能操纵模型排名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注示例数量，但示例格式（特别是分隔符选择）的影响尚未充分研究，而用户在实际使用中需要面对各种分隔符选择。

Method: 通过测试不同分隔符（逗号、换行、分号等）对多个主流模型家族的影响，分析注意力机制，并探索提高稳健性的方法。

Result: 分隔符选择显著影响模型性能，MMLU得分波动可达±23%；好的分隔符能引导注意力到关键token；在提示中明确指定分隔符可提高稳健性。

Conclusion: 分隔符选择是影响LLM评估和实际使用的重要因素，建议在提示中明确指定分隔符并选择性能最佳的分隔符。

Abstract: Common Large Language model (LLM) evaluations rely on demonstration examples
to steer models' responses to the desired style. While the number of examples
used has been studied and standardized, the choice of how to format examples is
less investigated. In evaluation protocols and real world usage, users face the
choice how to separate in-context examples: use a comma? new line? semi-colon?
hashtag? etc.? Surprisingly, we find this seemingly minor choice can
dramatically alter model response quality. Across leading model families
(Llama, Qwen, Gemma), performance on MMLU for example can vary by $\pm 23\%$
depending on the choice of delimiter. In fact, one can manipulate model
rankings to put any model in the lead by only modifying the single character
separating examples. We find LLMs' brittleness pervades topics, model families,
and doesn't improve with scale. By probing attention head scores, we find that
good-performing delimiters steer attention towards key tokens in the input.
Finally, we explore methods to improve LLMs' robustness to the choice of
delimiter. We find specifying the selected delimiter in the prompt boosts
robustness and offer practical recommendations for the best-performing
delimiters to select.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模公共审议产生大量自由形式贡献，需要合成具有代表性和中立性的摘要供政策制定使用。LLM在生成审议摘要时存在代表性不足和偏见问题，而现有评估方法依赖LLM作为评判者，与人类判断一致性较弱。

Method: 构建DeliberationBank数据集，包含10个审议问题的3000名参与者意见数据，以及4500名参与者在四个维度上的摘要判断数据。基于此训练DeliberationJudge模型，使用微调的DeBERTa模型从个体视角评估审议摘要。

Result: DeliberationJudge比多种LLM评判者更高效且与人类判断更一致。评估18个LLM发现审议摘要存在持续弱点，特别是少数立场代表性不足。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估审议摘要提供了可扩展且可靠的方法，有助于确保AI系统在政策制定中更具代表性和公平性。

Abstract: Large-scale public deliberations generate thousands of free-form
contributions that must be synthesized into representative and neutral
summaries for policy use. While LLMs have been shown as a promising tool to
generate summaries for large-scale deliberations, they also risk
underrepresenting minority perspectives and exhibiting bias with respect to the
input order, raising fairness concerns in high-stakes contexts. Studying and
fixing these issues requires a comprehensive evaluation at a large scale, yet
current practice often relies on LLMs as judges, which show weak alignment with
human judgments. To address this, we present DeliberationBank, a large-scale
human-grounded dataset with (1) opinion data spanning ten deliberation
questions created by 3,000 participants and (2) summary judgment data annotated
by 4,500 participants across four dimensions (representativeness,
informativeness, neutrality, policy approval). Using these datasets, we train
DeliberationJudge, a fine-tuned DeBERTa model that can rate deliberation
summaries from individual perspectives. DeliberationJudge is more efficient and
more aligned with human judgements compared to a wide range of LLM judges. With
DeliberationJudge, we evaluate 18 LLMs and reveal persistent weaknesses in
deliberation summarization, especially underrepresentation of minority
positions. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable way to evaluate
deliberation summarization, helping ensure AI systems are more representative

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于系统分类和提示工程的LLM幻觉自动检测方法，通过无监督学习在向量空间中区分幻觉与真实响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型推理过程中产生的幻觉问题，提高模型可靠性。

Method: 通过系统分类和提示工程控制生成多样幻觉类型，使用嵌入模型将幻觉数据集映射到向量空间，采用无监督学习技术分析降维表示。

Result: 定量评估显示幻觉的信息失真程度与其与正确输出簇的空间偏离度存在一致相关性，简单分类算法即可可靠区分幻觉与准确响应。

Conclusion: 该方法为改善模型可靠性提供了一个轻量级但有效的框架，证明了在单个LLM内可靠检测幻觉的可能性。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology for the automatic detection of
hallucinations generated during large language model (LLM) inference. The
proposed approach is based on a systematic taxonomy and controlled reproduction
of diverse hallucination types through prompt engineering. A dedicated
hallucination dataset is subsequently mapped into a vector space using an
embedding model and analyzed with unsupervised learning techniques in a
reduced-dimensional representation of hallucinations with veridical responses.
Quantitative evaluation of inter-centroid distances reveals a consistent
correlation between the severity of informational distortion in hallucinations
and their spatial divergence from the cluster of correct outputs. These
findings provide theoretical and empirical evidence that even simple
classification algorithms can reliably distinguish hallucinations from accurate
responses within a single LLM, thereby offering a lightweight yet effective
framework for improving model reliability.

*Chenghao Yang,Lin Gui,Chenxiao Yang,Victor Veitch,Lizhu Zhang,Zhuokai Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Exploratory Annealed Decoding (EAD)方法，通过从高到低退火采样温度，实现"开头探索、结尾利用"的策略，提高强化学习验证奖励(RLVR)中的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准固定温度采样难以平衡样本质量和训练稳定性：高温会降低样本质量，低温会限制发现。需要一种能同时保持样本质量和训练稳定性的探索策略。

Method: EAD方法在生成过程中从高到低退火采样温度，早期使用高温鼓励语义方向的多样性，后期使用低温保持样本质量并接近目标策略分布。

Result: EAD作为轻量级即插即用方法，在各种RLVR算法和模型规模下都显著优于固定温度采样，提高了样本效率。

Conclusion: 将探索与序列生成的自然动态对齐，是改进LLM推理能力的有效途径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a powerful paradigm
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), yet
its success hinges on effective exploration. An ideal exploration strategy must
navigate two fundamental challenges: it must preserve sample quality while also
ensuring training stability. While standard fixed-temperature sampling is
simple, it struggles to balance these competing demands, as high temperatures
degrade sample quality and low temperatures limit discovery. In this work, we
propose a simpler and more effective strategy, Exploratory Annealed Decoding
(EAD), grounded in the insight that exploration is most impactful on early
tokens which define a sequence's semantic direction. EAD implements an
intuitive **explore-at-the-beginning, exploit-at-the-end** strategy by
annealing the sampling temperature from high to low during generation. This
dynamic schedule encourages meaningful, high-level diversity at the start, then
gradually lowers the temperature to preserve sample quality and keep the
sampling distribution close to the target policy, which is essential for stable
training. We demonstrate that EAD is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that
significantly improves sample efficiency, consistently outperforming
fixed-temperature sampling across various RLVR algorithms and model sizes. Our
work suggests that aligning exploration with the natural dynamics of sequential
generation offers a robust path to improving LLM reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Camellia是一个用于评估9种亚洲语言中实体中心文化偏见的基准，包含19,530个手动标注的实体和2,173个自然语境，揭示了LLM在亚洲语言中的文化适应困难、不同模型持有独特偏见以及在实体提取中的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏多语言基准，不清楚LLM在非西方语言中是否存在文化偏见。先前研究表明LLM在阿拉伯语中偏向西方实体，需要评估在亚洲语言中的文化公平性。

Method: 构建Camellia基准，包含9种亚洲语言的19,530个手动标注实体和2,173个自然语境。评估4个多语言LLM家族在文化语境适应、情感关联和实体提取QA等任务中的表现。

Result: LLM在所有亚洲语言中都存在文化适应困难，不同地区开发的模型性能差异明显。不同LLM家族持有独特偏见，在情感与文化关联上表现不同。LLM在亚洲语言中的语境理解困难，导致实体提取中的文化间性能差距。

Conclusion: LLM在亚洲语言中存在显著的文化偏见问题，需要更多文化相关数据和改进的语境理解能力来提升文化公平性。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain stronger multilingual capabilities,
their ability to handle culturally diverse entities becomes crucial. Prior work
has shown that LLMs often favor Western-associated entities in Arabic, raising
concerns about cultural fairness. Due to the lack of multilingual benchmarks,
it remains unclear if such biases also manifest in different non-Western
languages. In this paper, we introduce Camellia, a benchmark for measuring
entity-centric cultural biases in nine Asian languages spanning six distinct
Asian cultures. Camellia includes 19,530 entities manually annotated for
association with the specific Asian or Western culture, as well as 2,173
naturally occurring masked contexts for entities derived from social media
posts. Using Camellia, we evaluate cultural biases in four recent multilingual
LLM families across various tasks such as cultural context adaptation,
sentiment association, and entity extractive QA. Our analyses show a struggle
by LLMs at cultural adaptation in all Asian languages, with performance
differing across models developed in regions with varying access to
culturally-relevant data. We further observe that different LLM families hold
their distinct biases, differing in how they associate cultures with particular
sentiments. Lastly, we find that LLMs struggle with context understanding in
Asian languages, creating performance gaps between cultures in entity
extraction.

*Yining She,Daniel W. Peterson,Marianne Menglin Liu,Vikas Upadhyay,Mohammad Hossein Chaghazardi,Eunsuk Kang,Dan Roth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于LLM的安全护栏模型在检索增强生成(RAG)场景下的上下文鲁棒性，发现插入良性文档会改变约11%的输入护栏和8%的输出护栏判断，暴露了当前护栏模型的上下文鲁棒性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型(LLMs)的广泛采用，确保LLM系统的安全性成为迫切需求。基于LLM的外部护栏模型虽然流行，但它们本身容易受到数据分布变化的影响，特别是在RAG场景中额外信息嵌入上下文时。

Method: 以RAG为案例研究，系统评估了3个Llama Guard和2个GPT-oss模型，分析插入良性文档对护栏判断的影响，并分别考察了增强上下文中各组件（检索文档、用户查询、LLM生成响应）的作用。

Result: 插入良性文档会改变约11%的输入护栏和8%的输出护栏判断，使其变得不可靠。测试的两种缓解方法仅带来轻微改进。

Conclusion: 当前护栏模型存在上下文鲁棒性差距，需要开发对检索和查询组合具有鲁棒性的训练和评估协议。

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs), ensuring the
safety of LLM systems has become a pressing concern. External LLM-based
guardrail models have emerged as a popular solution to screen unsafe inputs and
outputs, but they are themselves fine-tuned or prompt-engineered LLMs that are
vulnerable to data distribution shifts. In this paper, taking Retrieval
Augmentation Generation (RAG) as a case study, we investigated how robust
LLM-based guardrails are against additional information embedded in the
context. Through a systematic evaluation of 3 Llama Guards and 2 GPT-oss
models, we confirmed that inserting benign documents into the guardrail context
alters the judgments of input and output guardrails in around 11% and 8% of
cases, making them unreliable. We separately analyzed the effect of each
component in the augmented context: retrieved documents, user query, and
LLM-generated response. The two mitigation methods we tested only bring minor
improvements. These results expose a context-robustness gap in current
guardrails and motivate training and evaluation protocols that are robust to
retrieval and query composition.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了WeatherArchive-Bench基准，用于评估历史天气档案的检索增强生成系统，包含检索和评估两个任务，揭示了当前方法在历史术语和社会指标理解上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史天气档案包含丰富的社会脆弱性和韧性信息，但规模庞大、数字化质量差和语言古老，难以转化为结构化知识用于气候研究。

Method: 构建WeatherArchive-Bench基准，包含WeatherArchive-Retrieval（从百万档案段落中检索相关段落）和WeatherArchive-Assessment（LLM分类社会脆弱性和韧性指标）两个任务。

Result: 实验表明密集检索器在历史术语上表现不佳，LLM经常误解脆弱性和韧性概念，揭示了在复杂社会指标推理方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究为设计更稳健的气候档案RAG系统提供了见解，构建的数据集和评估框架已公开可用。

Abstract: Historical archives on weather events are collections of enduring primary
source records that offer rich, untapped narratives of how societies have
experienced and responded to extreme weather events. These qualitative accounts
provide insights into societal vulnerability and resilience that are largely
absent from meteorological records, making them valuable for climate scientists
to understand societal responses. However, their vast scale, noisy digitized
quality, and archaic language make it difficult to transform them into
structured knowledge for climate research. To address this challenge, we
introduce WeatherArchive-Bench, the first benchmark for evaluating
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems on historical weather archives.
WeatherArchive-Bench comprises two tasks: WeatherArchive-Retrieval, which
measures a system's ability to locate historically relevant passages from over
one million archival news segments, and WeatherArchive-Assessment, which
evaluates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can classify societal
vulnerability and resilience indicators from extreme weather narratives.
Extensive experiments across sparse, dense, and re-ranking retrievers, as well
as a diverse set of LLMs, reveal that dense retrievers often fail on historical
terminology, while LLMs frequently misinterpret vulnerability and resilience
concepts. These findings highlight key limitations in reasoning about complex
societal indicators and provide insights for designing more robust
climate-focused RAG systems from archival contexts. The constructed dataset and
evaluation framework are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为残差相似度（RS）的新方法，通过神经网络补充可解释特征系统，在保持可解释性的同时提高性能。该方法使用神经网络预测可解释系统的相似度误差，在四个数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者身份验证系统需要高准确性和可解释性，特别是当决策具有现实后果时。神经网络方法虽然准确率高，但缺乏直接可解释性，且LLM预测无法忠实解释推理过程。

Method: 残差相似度（RS）方法：将作者身份验证视为相似性任务，使用神经网络预测可解释系统的相似度残差（误差），从而在保持可解释性的同时提升性能。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估表明，该方法不仅能够匹配最先进的作者身份验证模型性能，还能展示最终预测的忠实性和可解释性程度。

Conclusion: 残差相似度方法成功解决了作者身份验证系统中准确性与可解释性之间的权衡问题，为具有现实后果的决策提供了可靠且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Responsible use of Authorship Verification (AV) systems not only requires
high accuracy but also interpretable solutions. More importantly, for systems
to be used to make decisions with real-world consequences requires the model's
prediction to be explainable using interpretable features that can be traced to
the original texts. Neural methods achieve high accuracies, but their
representations lack direct interpretability. Furthermore, LLM predictions
cannot be explained faithfully -- if there is an explanation given for a
prediction, it doesn't represent the reasoning process behind the model's
prediction. In this paper, we introduce Residualized Similarity (RS), a novel
method that supplements systems using interpretable features with a neural
network to improve their performance while maintaining interpretability.
Authorship verification is fundamentally a similarity task, where the goal is
to measure how alike two documents are. The key idea is to use the neural
network to predict a similarity residual, i.e. the error in the similarity
predicted by the interpretable system. Our evaluation across four datasets
shows that not only can we match the performance of state-of-the-art authorship
verification models, but we can show how and to what degree the final
prediction is faithful and interpretable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力机制的二次复杂度随着上下文长度增加成为显著瓶颈，需要寻找更高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过系统综述和批判性分析，比较不同方法在计算和内存复杂度、基准测试结果以及基本限制方面的表现。

Result: 分析了多种替代架构的优缺点，包括亚二次注意力变体、RNN、状态空间模型和混合方法，评估它们挑战Transformer主导地位的潜力。

Conclusion: 虽然Transformer目前仍占主导地位，但各种新兴方法显示出挑战其地位的潜力，特别是在处理长序列时效率更高。

Abstract: Transformers have dominated sequence processing tasks for the past seven
years -- most notably language modeling. However, the inherent quadratic
complexity of their attention mechanism remains a significant bottleneck as
context length increases. This paper surveys recent efforts to overcome this
bottleneck, including advances in (sub-quadratic) attention variants, recurrent
neural networks, state space models, and hybrid architectures. We critically
analyze these approaches in terms of compute and memory complexity, benchmark
results, and fundamental limitations to assess whether the dominance of
pure-attention transformers may soon be challenged.

TL;DR: 研究发现即使大型语言模型能够完美检索相关信息，其性能仍会随着输入长度增加而显著下降，这揭示了输入长度本身对模型性能的负面影响，与检索质量无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么LLMs在长上下文任务中性能无法随支持上下文长度线性扩展，特别是当检索完美时性能仍下降的原因。

Method: 在数学、问答和编程任务上对5个开源和闭源LLMs进行系统实验，包括替换无关标记为空白、强制模型仅关注相关标记等控制条件。

Result: 即使完美检索所有相关信息，模型性能仍随输入长度增加而显著下降（13.9%-85%），即使无关标记被替换为空白或完全屏蔽。

Conclusion: 输入长度本身会损害LLM性能，与检索质量和干扰无关。提出简单的缓解策略：通过提示模型在解决问题前复述检索到的证据，将长上下文任务转换为短上下文任务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often fail to scale their performance on
long-context tasks performance in line with the context lengths they support.
This gap is commonly attributed to retrieval failures -- the models' inability
to identify relevant information in the long inputs. Accordingly, recent
efforts often focus on evaluating and improving LLMs' retrieval performance: if
retrieval is perfect, a model should, in principle, perform just as well on a
long input as it does on a short one -- or should it? This paper presents
findings that the answer to this question may be negative. Our systematic
experiments across 5 open- and closed-source LLMs on math, question answering,
and coding tasks reveal that, even when models can perfectly retrieve all
relevant information, their performance still degrades substantially
(13.9%--85%) as input length increases but remains well within the models'
claimed lengths. This failure occurs even when the irrelevant tokens are
replaced with minimally distracting whitespace, and, more surprisingly, when
they are all masked and the models are forced to attend only to the relevant
tokens. A similar performance drop is observed when all relevant evidence is
placed immediately before the question. Our findings reveal a
previously-unrealized limitation: the sheer length of the input alone can hurt
LLM performance, independent of retrieval quality and without any distraction.
They motivate our simple, model-agnostic mitigation strategy that transforms a
long-context task into a short-context one by prompting the model to recite the
retrieved evidence before attempting to solve the problem. On RULER, we observe
a consistent improvement of GPT-4o up to 4% on an already strong baseline.

Motivation: 印度心理健康沟通存在语言碎片化、文化多样性，且在当前临床NLP中代表性不足。现有健康本体和心理健康资源主要基于英语或西方文化诊断框架，无法充分代表印度语言中的患者痛苦表达。

Method: 采用基于图的方法构建跨语言心理健康本体，捕捉文化嵌入的痛苦表达，跨语言对齐，并与临床术语链接。

Result: 提出的CL-PDE框架能够解决医疗沟通中的关键差距，使AI系统基于文化有效的表征，为多语言环境下的心理健康护理提供更包容和以患者为中心的NLP工具。

Conclusion: 该研究为多语言心理健康护理开发了更包容的NLP工具，通过文化有效的表征改善了医疗沟通。

Abstract: Mental health communication in India is linguistically fragmented, culturally
diverse, and often underrepresented in clinical NLP. Current health ontologies
and mental health resources are dominated by diagnostic frameworks centered on
English or Western culture, leaving a gap in representing patient distress
expressions in Indian languages. We propose cross-linguistic graphs of patient
stress expressions (CL-PDE), a framework for building cross-lingual mental
health ontologies through graph-based methods that capture culturally embedded
expressions of distress, align them across languages, and link them with
clinical terminology. Our approach addresses critical gaps in healthcare
communication by grounding AI systems in culturally valid representations,
allowing more inclusive and patient-centric NLP tools for mental health care in
multilingual contexts.

Conclusion: DPO能够使轻量级临床语言模型符合专家标准，支持隐私保护的AI辅助文档记录，减轻行政负担并提高ICU患者安全。

Abstract: Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential
clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal
styles, and lack of standardization, challenges that are particularly critical
in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart
failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs
derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original
notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert
qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation
quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore
improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy
(+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1
points), readability (+11.1 points), and structural clarity (+6.0 points).
These results indicate that DPO can align lightweight clinical language models
with expert standards, supporting privacy-preserving, AI-assisted documentation
within electronic health record systems to reduce administrative burden and
improve ICU patient safety.

Conclusion: 该系统成功展示了LLM在自动化有限元建模方面的潜力，为结构工程领域提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been used to empower autonomous
agents in engineering, significantly improving automation and efficiency in
labor-intensive workflows. However, their potential remains underexplored in
structural engineering, particularly for finite element modeling tasks
requiring geometric modeling, complex reasoning, and domain knowledge. To
bridge this gap, this paper develops a LLM-based multi-agent system to automate
finite element modeling of 2D frames. The system decomposes structural analysis
into subtasks, each managed by a specialized agent powered by the lightweight
Llama-3.3 70B Instruct model. The workflow begins with a Problem Analysis
Agent, which extracts geometry, boundary, and material parameters from the user
input. Next, a Geometry Agent incrementally derives node coordinates and
element connectivity by applying expert-defined rules. These structured outputs
are converted into executable OpenSeesPy code by a Translation Agent and
refined by a Model Validation Agent through consistency checks. Then, a Load
Agent applies load conditions into the assembled structural model. Experimental
evaluations on 20 benchmark problems demonstrate that the system achieves
accuracy over 80% in most cases across 10 repeated trials, outperforming
Gemini-2.5 Pro and ChatGPT-4o models.

TL;DR: 提出Self-Filtered Distillation框架，通过三个无监督信任指标筛选LLM生成的专利分类理由，避免噪声传播，提高训练稳定性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的自然语言理由常包含逻辑错误、标签不匹配和领域特定偏差，直接用作监督会传播噪声并破坏训练稳定性。

Method: 使用三个无监督信任指标：自一致性、类别蕴含对齐和LLM一致性评分，构建统一信任分数来筛选训练样本。

Result: 在USPTO-2M数据集上，该方法在准确性、稳定性和可解释性方面优于基于标签的学习和传统蒸馏方法。

Conclusion: 为专利分析中利用推理感知信任指标建立了可靠范式，能有效提升LLM生成理由的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate natural language
rationales to enhance interpretability, but these often contain logical errors,
label mismatches, and domain-specific misalignments. Directly using such
rationales as supervision risks propagating noise and undermining training
stability. To address this challenge, we introduce Self-Filtered Distillation,
a framework specifically tailored for patent classification, which treats
LLM-generated rationales as trust signals rather than ground-truth supervision.
The framework employs selective distillation guided by three unsupervised trust
metrics: (1) Self-Consistency, which measures the stability of LLM-generated
rationales across multiple generations; (2) Class Entailment Alignment, which
assesses semantic coherence with patent-specific class definitions; and (3) LLM
Agreement Scoring, which validates rationale-label plausibility. These metrics
are integrated into a unified trust score that primarily weights training
samples while optionally filtering out extremely low-trust cases, enabling
reasoning-aware supervision. Experiments on the USPTO-2M dataset, a widely used
benchmark for patent classification, show that our method outperforms
label-based learning and conventional distillation in accuracy, stability, and
interpretability, establishing a reliable paradigm for leveraging
reasoning-aware trust indicators in patent analytics.

Motivation: 由于人工评估成本高、耗时长且难以复现，需要研究使用LLM模拟用户进行自动助手评估的可靠性，但目前缺乏系统性的基准研究。

Method: 引入SimulatorArena基准，在数学辅导和文档创建两个交互任务上，评估各种模拟器方法，特别是基于用户画像（背景和消息风格）的模拟器。

Result: 基于用户画像的模拟器与人类判断高度一致，在两个任务上的Spearman相关系数ρ均达到0.7，为人工评估提供了实用且可扩展的替代方案。

Conclusion: 条件化用户画像的模拟器能够可靠地替代真实用户进行LLM助手评估，使用最佳模拟器对18个助手（包括GPT-5、Claude 4.1 Opus等最新模型）进行了基准测试。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in interactive
applications, and human evaluation remains the gold standard for assessing
their performance in multi-turn conversations. Since human studies are costly,
time-consuming, and hard to reproduce, recent work explores using LLMs to
simulate users for automatic assistant evaluation. However, there is no
benchmark or systematic study to evaluate whether these simulated users are
reliable stand-ins for real users. To address this, we introduce
SimulatorArena, a benchmark of 909 annotated human-LLM conversations on two
interactive tasks -- math tutoring and document creation. SimulatorArena
evaluates simulators based on how closely their messages match human behavior
and how well their assistant ratings align with human judgments. Experiments on
various simulator methods show that simulators conditioned on user profiles,
capturing traits like background and message styles, align closely with human
judgments. They reach Spearman's $\rho$ of 0.7 on both tasks, providing a
practical, scalable alternative to human evaluation. Using the best simulator
for each task, we benchmark 18 assistants, including the latest LLMs such as
GPT-5, Claude 4.1 Opus, and Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and agent-based frameworks have advanced
rapidly, enabling diverse applications. Yet, with the proliferation of models
and agentic strategies, practitioners face substantial uncertainty in selecting
the best configuration for a downstream task. Prior studies show that different
agents and backbones exhibit complementary strengths, and that larger models
are not always superior, underscoring the need for adaptive routing mechanisms.
Existing approaches to agent routing, however, often emphasize cost efficiency
while overlooking the fine-grained contextual and relational structure inherent
in QA tasks. In this paper, we propose tAgentRouter, a framework that
formulates multi-agent QA as a knowledge-graph-guided routing problem
supervised by empirical performance signals. Specifically, we convert QA
instance into a knowledge graph that jointly encodes queries, contextual
entities, and agents, and then train a heterogeneous graph neural network (GNN)
to propagate information across node types and produce task-aware routing
distributions over agents. By leveraging soft supervision and weighted
aggregation of agent outputs, AgentRouter learns principled collaboration
schemes that capture the complementary strengths of diverse agents. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms
single-agent and ensemble baselines, while generalizing across benchmarks and
LLM backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness and robustness of
graph-supervised multi-agent routing for question answering.

Conclusion: SoNLI数据集为评估和改进模型在社交推理和心智理论方面的能力提供了基础，这对于开发熟练的AI助手至关重要。

Abstract: Making theory-of-mind inferences from human dialogue is a strong indicator of
a model's underlying social abilities, which are fundamental for adept AI
assistants. However, large language and reasoning models struggle to understand
sophisticated social phenomena in transcript data, such as sarcasm and irony.
To assess the weaknesses of current models and to identify their solutions, we
introduce SocialNLI (SoNLI) -- the first social dialogue inference dataset.
SoNLI consists of a collection of dialogue transcripts hand-picked to center
complex social nuances like irony and sarcasm, paired with inferences,
corresponding likelihood scores, and human-written explanations. We explore
social inference analysis as a facet of theory-of-mind, and evaluate LLM and
reasoning model theory-of-mind ability through multi-step counterfactual
reasoning.

TL;DR: TensorBLEU是一个专为GPU优化的BLEU指标实现，针对训练过程中的逐句评估需求，相比传统CPU实现提供13-40倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代NLP模型规模庞大，但评估工具往往成为计算瓶颈，特别是在训练过程中需要GPU上高效计算逐句奖励信号时。

Method: 完全向量化的GPU加速实现，使用torch.unique创建紧凑的n-gram字典，避免传统哈希方法的高内存成本。

Result: 在消费级GPU上实现13倍加速，数据中心级GPU上超过40倍加速，将显著瓶颈转化为训练循环中的可忽略部分。

Conclusion: TensorBLEU作为"Token-ID BLEU"为开发目的提供了强大工具，特别适用于基于强化学习的模型微调等研究领域。

Abstract: Modern natural language processing models have achieved unprecedented scale,
yet the tools for their evaluation often remain a computational bottleneck,
limiting the pace of research. This is particularly acute for in-training
evaluation metrics, such as per-sentence reward signals in Reinforcement
Learning, which must operate efficiently on batches of token IDs directly on
the GPU. In this paper, we introduce TensorBLEU, a novel implementation of the
BLEU metric designed from the ground up for this specific use case. Our
approach is fully vectorized for GPU-accelerated, per-sentence computation
within PyTorch and introduces a memory-efficient counting mechanism. By
creating a compact, batch-specific dictionary of n-grams using
\texttt{torch.unique}, our method avoids the prohibitive memory costs of
traditional hashing-based vectorization, making it practical for
large-vocabulary models. We benchmark TensorBLEU against NLTK, the standard
library for token-ID-based BLEU calculation on the CPU. Experiments show that
TensorBLEU provides speedups of over 13x on consumer-grade GPUs (NVIDIA T4) and
exceeding 40x on data-center-class hardware (NVIDIA A100). This performance
transforms a significant bottleneck into a negligible part of the training
loop. By clearly defining its role as a "Token-ID BLEU" for development
purposes and open-sourcing our implementation, we provide a powerful tool for
accelerating research in areas like RL-based model fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文通过为规划基准添加细粒度自然语言约束，揭示了LLMs在复杂约束规划中的性能显著下降和鲁棒性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准仅包含通用简化环境规范，可能高估LLMs的规划能力并带来下游任务安全风险。

Method: 为广泛使用的规划基准添加手动标注的细粒度自然语言约束，涵盖四个正式定义类别，在4个LLMs、3种形式语言、5种方法和4个数据集上进行评估。

Result: 引入约束后性能一致减半，且对问题复杂性和词汇变化的鲁棒性显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在复杂约束规划任务中存在严重局限性，需要改进以应对现实世界规划场景。

Abstract: LLMs have been widely used in planning, either as planners to generate action
sequences end-to-end, or as formalizers to represent the planning domain and
problem in a formal language that can derive plans deterministically. However,
both lines of work rely on standard benchmarks that only include generic and
simplistic environmental specifications, leading to potential overestimation of
the planning ability of LLMs and safety concerns in downstream tasks. We bridge
this gap by augmenting widely used planning benchmarks with manually annotated,
fine-grained, and rich natural language constraints spanning four formally
defined categories. Over 4 state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, 3 formal languages,
5 methods, and 4 datasets, we show that the introduction of constraints not
only consistently halves performance, but also significantly challenges
robustness to problem complexity and lexical shift.

Motivation: 直接应用开源或微调的LLM在LinkedIn职位匹配任务中无法产生高质量、可操作的反馈，且大模型推理延迟高、可扩展性差，不适合在线使用。

Method: LANTERN框架包含多个目标建模：编码器模型用于分类，解码器模型用于解释。采用多级知识蒸馏，整合数据和logit层面的洞察，并结合后训练技术和提示工程。

Result: 实验结果显示LANTERN显著提升了职位匹配和解释的任务特定指标。在线评估显示职位申请率提升0.24%，合格申请率提升0.28%。

Conclusion: LANTERN成功解决了LLM在领域特定任务中的部署挑战，通过知识蒸馏框架实现了高质量、低延迟的职位匹配服务。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, deploying LLMs at scale
for domain specific applications, such as job-person fit and explanation in job
seeking platforms, introduces distinct challenges. At LinkedIn, the job person
fit task requires analyzing a candidate's public profile against job
requirements to produce both a fit assessment and a detailed explanation.
Directly applying open source or finetuned LLMs to this task often fails to
yield high quality, actionable feedback due to the complexity of the domain and
the need for structured outputs. Moreover, the large size of these models leads
to high inference latency and limits scalability, making them unsuitable for
online use. To address these challenges, we introduce LANTERN, a novel LLM
knowledge distillation framework tailored specifically for job person fit
tasks. LANTERN involves modeling over multiple objectives, an encoder model for
classification purpose, and a decoder model for explanation purpose. To better
distill the knowledge from a strong black box teacher model to multiple
downstream models, LANTERN incorporates multi level knowledge distillation that
integrates both data and logit level insights. In addition to introducing the
knowledge distillation framework, we share our insights on post training
techniques and prompt engineering, both of which are crucial for successfully
adapting LLMs to domain specific downstream tasks. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that LANTERN significantly improves task specific metrics
for both job person fit and explanation. Online evaluations further confirm its
effectiveness, showing measurable gains in job seeker engagement, including a
0.24\% increase in apply rate and a 0.28\% increase in qualified applications.

TL;DR: PDS是一种无需指令的动态引导方法，通过聚类激活差异构建推理原型，在推理时根据输入生成实例特定的引导向量来增强LLM推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM依赖显式推理指令或静态引导方法，缺乏自适应、无需指令的推理增强方法。

Method: 通过聚类CoT提示和中性提示的激活差异构建推理原型，在推理时将输入的隐藏状态投影到这些原型上形成实例特定的引导向量。

Result: 在GSM8K、AQuA-RAT和BIG-Bench任务上持续提升准确率，即使显式抑制CoT时增益依然存在，表明该方法增强了潜在推理过程而非表面行为变化。

Conclusion: 基于原型的动态引导是增强LLM推理能力的轻量级替代方案，无需微调或提示工程。

Abstract: Despite impressive breadth, LLMs still rely on explicit reasoning
instructions or static, one-fits-all steering methods, leaving a gap for
adaptive, instruction-free reasoning amplification. We present Prototype-Based
Dynamic Steering (PDS), a test-time method that amplifies large language model
(LLM) reasoning without adding or altering instructions. We introduce
"reasoning prototypes" by clustering activation differences between
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and neutral prompts. At inference, an input's hidden
state is projected onto these prototypes to form an instance-specific steering
vector. Evaluated on GSM8K, AQuA-RAT, and BIG-Bench tasks, PDS consistently
improves accuracy without fine-tuning or prompt engineering. Notably, the gains
persist even when CoT is explicitly suppressed to improve cost-efficiency,
indicating that the intervention strengthens latent reasoning processes rather
than inducing a superficial behavioral shift. These results position dynamic,
prototype-guided steering as a lightweight alternative to training-time
approaches for enhancing LLM reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在处理长文档时面临信息过载问题，需要一种系统化的记忆模块设计来提升阅读理解能力。

Method: 开发CAM原型系统，采用增量重叠聚类算法构建结构化记忆，支持层次化摘要和在线批量集成，在推理时自适应激活查询相关信息。

Result: 在问答、查询摘要和声明验证等长文本阅读理解任务中，CAM在性能和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于建构主义理论设计的CAM记忆系统为LLM的长文档理解提供了更强大和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are confronted with overwhelming
information volume when comprehending long-form documents. This challenge
raises the imperative of a cohesive memory module, which can elevate vanilla
LLMs into autonomous reading agents. Despite the emergence of some heuristic
approaches, a systematic design principle remains absent. To fill this void, we
draw inspiration from Jean Piaget's Constructivist Theory, illuminating three
traits of the agentic memory -- structured schemata, flexible assimilation, and
dynamic accommodation. This blueprint forges a clear path toward a more robust
and efficient memory system for LLM-based reading comprehension. To this end,
we develop CAM, a prototype implementation of Constructivist Agentic Memory
that simultaneously embodies the structurality, flexibility, and dynamicity. At
its core, CAM is endowed with an incremental overlapping clustering algorithm
for structured memory development, supporting both coherent hierarchical
summarization and online batch integration. During inference, CAM adaptively
explores the memory structure to activate query-relevant information for
contextual response, akin to the human associative process. Compared to
existing approaches, our design demonstrates dual advantages in both
performance and efficiency across diverse long-text reading comprehension
tasks, including question answering, query-based summarization, and claim
verification.

TL;DR: KEO是一个针对安全关键领域的知识提取和推理框架，通过构建知识图谱并集成到RAG流程中，显著提升了全局意义理解和系统级洞察能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键环境中，传统文本分块RAG方法在全局推理和系统级理解方面存在局限，需要更结构化的知识表示来支持复杂的决策任务。

Method: 构建结构化知识图谱并集成到检索增强生成(RAG)流程中，使用本地可部署的LLM进行评估，并采用更强模型作为评判者。

Result: KEO在全局意义理解方面显著提升，能够揭示模式和系统级洞察，而文本分块RAG在需要局部检索的细粒度程序任务中仍然有效。

Conclusion: 知识图谱增强的LLM在安全、领域特定的问答系统中具有巨大潜力，特别适用于高风险推理场景。

Abstract: We present Knowledge Extraction on OMIn (KEO), a domain-specific knowledge
extraction and reasoning framework with large language models (LLMs) in
safety-critical contexts. Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence
(OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and
actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and
integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling
more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We
evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ
stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO
markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level
insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural
tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of
KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in
high-stakes reasoning.

*Harshil Vejendla*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: H1B-KV是一种混合1位KV缓存压缩方案，通过1位二进制草图表示键向量和4位量化值向量，将7B参数LLM的8k上下文缓存从4GB减少到60MB，实现70倍压缩，同时保持与全精度相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码中KV缓存的内存占用随上下文长度线性增长，成为长上下文推理的瓶颈。现有方法要么只压缩部分组件，要么丢弃上下文信息，无法提供完整的解决方案。

Method: 采用混合压缩方案：键向量用1位二进制草图表示，支持硬件友好的位运算注意力；值向量使用4位量化。通过轻量级微调保持模型性能。

Result: 在7B参数LLM上，H1B-KV将8k上下文缓存从4GB压缩到60MB（70倍减少），在困惑度基准和复杂下游任务（数学推理、多任务理解、代码生成）上匹配全精度性能，在质量-字节比上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: H1B-KV为内存受限环境中的LLM部署提供了稳健解决方案，通过全面的KV缓存压缩在不牺牲上下文信息的情况下大幅减少内存使用。

Abstract: Autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) requires caching a
growing list of past key-value (KV) pairs, making long-context inference a
memory-bound problem. While recent methods have explored quantizing the cache,
evicting tokens, or using binary sketches for keys (e.g., Loki), these
approaches often provide an incomplete solution by leaving one component (like
values) uncompressed or by discarding context information. This paper
introduces the Hybrid One-Bit KV Cache (H1B-KV), a comprehensive compression
scheme that radically reduces memory usage without sacrificing context. H1B-KV
represents each key vector using a 1-bit binary sketch, enabling
hardware-friendly bitwise attention, and further compresses value vectors using
4-bit quantization. This holistic, hybrid approach allows a 7-billion parameter
LLM to handle an 8k-token context with under 60 MB of cache memory - a 70x
reduction. We demonstrate that after a lightweight finetuning, H1B-KV matches
full-precision performance not only on perplexity benchmarks but also on
complex downstream tasks like mathematical reasoning (GSM8K), multi-task
understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). Our results show H1B-KV
significantly outperforms leading quantization (KIVI), token eviction
(SparseLLM), and key-only sketching (Loki) methods in quality-per-byte,
establishing it as a robust solution for deploying LLMs in memory-constrained
environments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自博弈偏好优化已成为对齐大语言模型的重要范式，但提示作为该流程的核心组件，其作用尚未得到充分探索。本文旨在研究不同难度提示如何影响自博弈偏好优化。

Method: 使用提示的N个采样响应平均奖励作为难度代理指标，分析不同难度提示对自博弈优化的影响，并探索缓解困难提示负面影响的策略。

Result: 困难提示的自博弈优化性能显著劣于简单提示；将困难提示纳入训练无法提升整体性能，反而会导致轻微性能下降；模型容量增加能缩小困难与简单提示的性能差距；选择性移除适当比例的困难提示可以提升整体性能。

Conclusion: 提示难度是自博弈偏好优化中的关键因素，困难提示会损害优化效果，但通过策略性选择提示可以缓解这一问题，且模型容量与提示难度存在交互作用。

Abstract: Self-play preference optimization has emerged as a prominent paradigm for
aligning large language models (LLMs). It typically involves a language model
to generate on-policy responses for prompts and a reward model (RM) to guide
the selection of chosen and rejected responses, which can be further trained
with direct preference optimization (DPO). However, the role of prompts remains
underexplored, despite being a core component in this pipeline. In this work,
we investigate how prompts of varying difficulty influence self-play preference
optimization. We first use the mean reward of $N$ sampled responses of a prompt
as a proxy for its difficulty. We find that difficult prompts exhibit
substantially inferior self-play optimization performance in comparison to easy
prompts for language models. Moreover, incorporating difficult prompts into
training fails to enhance overall performance and, in fact, leads to slight
degradation compared to training on easy prompts alone. We also observe that
the performance gap between difficult and easy prompts closes as the model
capacity increases, suggesting that difficulty interacts with the model
capacity. Building on these findings, we explore strategies to mitigate the
negative effect of difficult prompts on final performance. We demonstrate that
selectively removing an appropriate portion of challenging prompts enhances
overall self-play performance, while also reporting failed attempts and lessons
learned.

Result: 在相同压缩水平下，PGSVD相比其他方法在LLM和VLM上实现了更好的准确率和推理加速。

Conclusion: PGSVD框架为大型模型压缩提供了理论指导和实用解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著提升部署效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (VLM) have achieved
state-of-the-art performance, but they impose significant memory and computing
challenges in deployment. We present a novel low-rank compression framework to
address this challenge. First, we upper bound the change of network loss via
layer-wise activation-based compression errors, filling a theoretical gap in
the literature. We then formulate low-rank model compression as a bi-objective
optimization and prove that a single uniform tolerance yields surrogate
Pareto-optimal heterogeneous ranks. Based on our theoretical insights, we
propose Pareto-Guided Singular Value Decomposition (PGSVD), a zero-shot
pipeline that improves activation-aware compression via Pareto-guided rank
selection and alternating least-squares implementation. We apply PGSVD to both
LLM and VLM, showing better accuracy at the same compression levels and
inference speedup.

Motivation: 现有自动化方法在讲故事、美学质量和自我调整方面存在局限，难以实现高效且吸引人的传播。核心挑战在于无法评估就无法改进。

Method: 引入PresAesth多任务强化学习审美模型，提供可靠的美学评分、缺陷调整和比较反馈；建立EvoPresent基准，包含演示生成质量和审美意识两个评估维度。

Result: 发现高质量反馈对代理自我改进至关重要；自动化生成管道在视觉设计和内容构建之间存在权衡；多任务RL训练在审美意识任务中表现出更强的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EvoPresent框架通过统一的自我改进方法有效解决了学术论文演示中的关键挑战，强调了评估反馈在自动化系统中的重要性。

Abstract: The promotion of academic papers has become an important means of enhancing
research visibility. However, existing automated methods struggle limited
storytelling, insufficient aesthetic quality, and constrained self-adjustment,
making it difficult to achieve efficient and engaging dissemination. At the
heart of those challenges is a simple principle: \emph{there is no way to
improve it when you cannot evaluate it right}. To address this, we introduce
\textbf{EvoPresent}, a self-improvement agent framework that unifies coherent
narratives, aesthetic-aware designs, and realistic presentation delivery via
virtual characters. Central to EvoPresent is \textbf{PresAesth}, a multi-task
reinforcement learning (RL) aesthetic model that provides reliable aesthetic
scoring, defect adjustment, and comparative feedback, enabling iterative
self-improvement even under limited aesthetic training data. To systematically
evaluate the methods, we introduce \textbf{EvoPresent Benchmark}, a
comprehensive benchmark comprising: \textit{Presentation Generation Quality},
built on 650 top-tier AI conference papers with multimodal resources (slides,
videos and scripts) to assess both content and design; and \textit{Aesthetic
Awareness}, consisting of 2,000 slide pairs with varying aesthetic levels,
supporting joint training and evaluation on scoring, defect adjustment, and
comparison. Our findings highlight that (i) High-quality feedback is essential
for agent self-improvement, while initial capability alone does not guarantee
effective self-correction. (ii) Automated generation pipelines exhibit a
trade-off between visual design and content construction. (iii) Multi-task RL
training shows stronger generalization in aesthetic awareness tasks.

Abstract: Recent advancements in language agents have led to significant improvements
in multi-hop reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches often struggle with
handling open-domain problems, which require massive information retrieval due
to their reliance on a fixed sequence of actions. To address this, we propose
Feedback-Guided Dynamic Interactive Planning (FGDIP), a novel framework
tailored to enhance reasoning in LLMs by utilizing dynamic and adaptive
strategies for information exploration in open-domain multi-hop reasoning
tasks. Our approach begins by identifying key entities relevant to the problem,
which serve as the initial nodes in the reasoning process. From these initial
nodes, we then generate reasoning child nodes with the process being refined
through a combination of historical error analysis and real-time feedback,
which allows the framework to dynamically adjust and optimize its reasoning
strategies. By integrating depth-first search with an innovative node
generation technique, our framework adapts based on both prior error paths and
concurrently generated nodes at the same hierarchical level. This dynamic
strategy effectively expands the search space while ensuring the reasoning
process systematically converges toward accurate solutions. Experimental
results show that FGDIP achieved up to 54.47% F1 score on the HotpotQA dataset
and 70.05% on the StrategyQA dataset, surpassing the best baseline by 5.03% and
7.25% respectively, highlighting its versatility and potential to enhance
language agents in multi-hop reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: EAGLET提供了一种高效有效的解决方案，无需人工努力或额外训练数据，显著提升了代理在复杂任务中的规划能力

Abstract: Agents based on large language models (LLMs) struggle with brainless
trial-and-error and generating hallucinatory actions due to a lack of global
planning in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we introduce a plan-and-execute
framework and propose EAGLET, an efficient and effective planner training
method to enhance the executor agent's planning abilities without human effort.
Specifically, we train a plug-and-play global planner through a two-step
process: we first synthesize high-quality plans from an advanced LLM using our
proposed homologous consensus filtering strategy, and apply fine-tuning as a
cold start. Moreover, we further improve the planner with a rule-based
reinforcement learning stage using a novel executor capability gain reward,
ensuring it can handle task instructions of varying difficulty. Experiments on
three long-horizon agent tasks show that executor agents equipped with our
planner outperform existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance. Meanwhile, EAGLET reduces training costs by 8x compared to
RL-based baselines, and it does not require manual effort or extra training
data, offering an efficient and effective solution.

Abstract: Implicit Attribute Value Extraction (AVE) is essential for accurately
representing products in e-commerce, as it infers lantent attributes from
multimodal data. Despite advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs),
implicit AVE remains challenging due to the complexity of multidimensional data
and gaps in vision-text understanding. In this work, we introduce
\textsc{\modelname}, a multi-agent debate framework that employs multiple MLLM
agents to iteratively refine inferences. Through a series of debate rounds,
agents verify and update each other's responses, thereby improving inference
performance and robustness. Experiments on the ImplicitAVE dataset demonstrate
that even a few rounds of debate significantly boost accuracy, especially for
attributes with initially low performance. We systematically evaluate various
debate configurations, including identical or different MLLM agents, and
analyze how debate rounds affect convergence dynamics. Our findings highlight
the potential of multi-agent debate strategies to address the limitations of
single-agent approaches and offer a scalable solution for implicit AVE in
multimodal e-commerce.

*Haneul Yoo,Jiho Jin,Kyunghyun Cho,Alice Oh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出代码转换上下文学习(CSICL)，通过在演示和指令中从目标语言渐进过渡到英语，为LLMs搭建隐式语言桥梁，克服翻译障碍，提升多语言推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨语言上下文学习方法主要依赖单语演示，未能缓解LLMs依赖英语作为潜在表征的翻译障碍，反而强化了这种依赖，限制了LLM应用的多语言包容性。

Method: 使用代码转换上下文学习策略，在演示和指令中控制性地从目标语言逐步转换到英语，明确搭建推理过程的语言桥梁，增强跨语言对齐。

Result: 在4个LLM、6个数据集和10种语言的广泛实验中，CSICL始终优于X-ICL基线，在目标语言和未见语言上分别获得3.1%和1.9%的性能提升，在低资源环境下提升更显著(目标语言14.7%，未见语言5.3%)。

Conclusion: 代码转换是一种原则性和鲁棒的方法，可在推理过程中克服翻译障碍，推动LLMs向更公平有效的多语言系统发展。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong multilingual abilities,
their reliance on English as latent representations creates a translation
barrier, where reasoning implicitly depends on internal translation into
English. When this process fails, performance in non-English languages
deteriorates sharply, limiting the inclusiveness of LLM-based applications.
Existing cross-lingual in-context learning (X-ICL) methods primarily leverage
monolingual demonstrations, often failing to mitigate this barrier and instead
reinforcing it. In this work, we introduce code-switching in-context learning
(CSICL), a simple yet effective prompting strategy that progressively
transitions from a target language to English within demonstrations and
instruction to facilitate their latent reasoning in English. By explicitly
scaffolding the reasoning process through controlled code-switching, CSICL acts
as an implicit linguistic bridge that enhances cross-lingual alignment and
reduces reliance on the translation barrier. We conduct extensive experiments
across 4 LLMs, 6 datasets, and 10 languages, spanning both knowledge-intensive
and reasoning-oriented domains. Our results demonstrate that CSICL consistently
outperforms X-ICL baselines, achieving gains of 3.1%p and 1.9%p in both target
and unseen languages, respectively. The improvement is even more pronounced in
low-resource settings, with gains of 14.7% in target and 5.3% in unseen
languages. These findings establish code-switching as a principled and robust
approach for overcoming the translation barrier during inference, moving LLMs
toward more equitable and effective multilingual systems.

Motivation: 现有基于结果监督强化学习的Agentic RAG方法存在探索效率低、奖励信号稀疏和全局奖励反馈模糊等问题，需要改进。

Method: 将RAG建模为马尔可夫决策过程，结合决策与执行，引入高效剪枝策略优化数据扩展，进行全面的过程级策略优化。

Result: 在六个数据集上平均绝对性能提升6.2%，显著优于现有基线方法，剪枝策略使数据构建效率提升近6倍。

Conclusion: DecEx-RAG为过程监督的RAG训练提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了LLM在复杂任务中的处理能力。

Abstract: Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) enhances the processing
capability for complex tasks through dynamic retrieval and adaptive workflows.
Recent advances (e.g., Search-R1) have shown that outcome-supervised
reinforcement learning demonstrate strong performance. However, this approach
still suffers from inefficient exploration, sparse reward signals, and
ambiguous global reward feedback. To address these challenges, we propose
DecEx-RAG, which models RAG as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) incorporating
decision-making and execution, while introducing an efficient pruning strategy
to optimize data expansion. Through comprehensive process-level policy
optimization, DecEx-RAG significantly enhances the autonomous task
decomposition, dynamic retrieval, and high-quality answer generation
capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Experiments show that DecEx-RAG
achieves an average absolute performance improvement of $6.2\%$ across six
datasets, significantly outperforming existing baselines. Moreover, the pruning
strategy improves data construction efficiency by nearly $6 \times$, providing
an efficient solution for process-supervised RAG training. The code is
available at https://github.com/sdsxdxl/DecEx-RAG.

Result: 生成了多源同义词集，为每个实体提供标准化标签，这些映射将用于名称解析API和OntoPortal-Astro平台。

Conclusion: 该方法能够生成合理且符合FAIR原则的映射，有助于天文数据的标准化和互操作性。

Abstract: This ongoing work focuses on the development of a methodology for generating
a multi-source mapping of astronomical observation facilities. To compare two
entities, we compute scores with adaptable criteria and Natural Language
Processing (NLP) techniques (Bag-of-Words approaches, sequential approaches,
and surface approaches) to map entities extracted from eight semantic
artifacts, including Wikidata and astronomy-oriented resources. We utilize
every property available, such as labels, definitions, descriptions, external
identifiers, and more domain-specific properties, such as the observation
wavebands, spacecraft launch dates, funding agencies, etc. Finally, we use a
Large Language Model (LLM) to accept or reject a mapping suggestion and provide
a justification, ensuring the plausibility and FAIRness of the validated
synonym pairs. The resulting mapping is composed of multi-source synonym sets
providing only one standardized label per entity. Those mappings will be used
to feed our Name Resolver API and will be integrated into the International
Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) Vocabularies and the OntoPortal-Astro
platform.

TL;DR: 该论文推导了非渐近谱带，通过对齐度、温度和批次谱来界定InfoNCE梯度范数的平方，恢复了1/τ²定律，并在合成数据和ImageNet上紧密跟踪批次平均梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究InfoNCE损失函数的梯度特性，特别是其与温度、对齐度和批次谱的关系，以改进对比学习中的批次选择和优化策略。

Method: 使用有效秩R_eff作为各向异性代理，设计频谱感知的批次选择方法，包括快速贪婪构建器。在批次内进行白化处理以促进各向同性。

Result: 在ImageNet-100上，Greedy-64相比随机选择将达到67.5% top-1准确率的时间减少了15%（相比Pool-P3减少24%），在CIFAR-10上也有类似增益。批次内白化将50步梯度方差降低了1.37倍。

Conclusion: 频谱感知的批次选择和批次内白化能有效提升对比学习的训练效率和稳定性，理论分析与实验结果一致。

Abstract: We derive non-asymptotic spectral bands that bound the squared InfoNCE
gradient norm via alignment, temperature, and batch spectrum, recovering the
\(1/\tau^{2}\) law and closely tracking batch-mean gradients on synthetic data
and ImageNet. Using effective rank \(R_{\mathrm{eff}}\) as an anisotropy proxy,
we design spectrum-aware batch selection, including a fast greedy builder. On
ImageNet-100, Greedy-64 cuts time-to-67.5\% top-1 by 15\% vs.\ random (24\%
vs.\ Pool--P3) at equal accuracy; CIFAR-10 shows similar gains. In-batch
whitening promotes isotropy and reduces 50-step gradient variance by
\(1.37\times\), matching our theoretical upper bound.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的抽象文本摘要学习方法，通过优化传输信息注意力机制和累积联合熵减少命名实体来提升摘要的信息丰富度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，需要将海量文本转化为简洁、连贯且信息丰富的摘要。尽管已有显著进展，但在信息丰富度方面仍有改进空间。

Method: 采用两种方法：基于最优传输的信息注意力机制来学习参考摘要中的关键信息，以及基于命名实体的累积联合熵减少方法来增强信息显著性。

Result: 在CNN/Daily Mail数据集上取得了比先前工作更好的ROUGE分数，在XSum数据集上具有竞争力。人工评估也显示该方法在信息丰富度上优于强基线。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了抽象文本摘要的信息丰富度，进一步分析揭示了评估结果背后的合理原因。

Abstract: Abstractive text summarization is integral to the Big Data era, which demands
advanced methods to turn voluminous and often long text data into concise but
coherent and informative summaries for efficient human consumption. Despite
significant progress, there is still room for improvement in various aspects.
One such aspect is to improve informativeness. Hence, this paper proposes a
novel learning approach consisting of two methods: an optimal transport-based
informative attention method to improve learning focal information in reference
summaries and an accumulative joint entropy reduction method on named entities
to enhance informative salience. Experiment results show that our approach
achieves better ROUGE scores compared to prior work on CNN/Daily Mail while
having competitive results on XSum. Human evaluation of informativeness also
demonstrates the better performance of our approach over a strong baseline.
Further analysis gives insight into the plausible reasons underlying the
evaluation results.

TL;DR: 研究发现MoE模型在推理时激活的参数高度稀疏，提出MoNE方法通过神经元级专家选择，仅激活50%参数即可达到传统MoE性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MoE层在推理时激活的参数是否保持高度稀疏，以及如何利用这种稀疏性提高参数利用率和推理效率。

Method: 对MoE模型进行稀疏化研究，将专家分解为神经元级MoE，提出MoNE方法通过简单的top-k选择在每个专家内选择高激活神经元。

Result: MoNE仅激活50%MoE层参数即可匹配传统MoE性能，在同等激活参数数量下持续优于传统MoE。

Conclusion: MoNE是一种实用的方法，可提高MoE类模型的参数利用率和推理效率，无需额外路由参数或专家间通信。

Abstract: In this work, we first explore whether the parameters activated by the MoE
layer remain highly sparse at inference. We perform a sparsification study on
several representative MoE models. For each expert, we rank parameters by the
magnitude of their activations from the gate projection and progressively prune
the activated subset. Pruning up to 60% of parameters within that subset causes
only negligible task-performance degradation; substantial drops occur only
after more than 90% are removed. We further decompose experts into
neuron-granular MoE and visualize their activation values, finding that most
neuron activations are near zero. This observation motivates us to select only
high-activation neuron experts during pretraining. Based on this insight, we
propose Mixture of Neuron Experts (MoNE). MoNE achieves neuron-granular expert
selection by only applying a simple top-k selection within each expert, incurs
negligible latency, and requires no additional routing parameters or
inter-expert communication. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoNE matches
traditional MoE performance while activating only 50% of the MoE-layer
parameters, and it consistently outperforms traditional MoE when compared at
equal numbers of activated parameters. These results suggest that MoNE is a
practical approach to improving parameter utilization and inference efficiency
in MoE-like models.

Motivation: 现有TTS偏好优化方法需要成对的可取和不可取样本，但这类数据在TTS输出中有限，且语句级方法无法实现细粒度的token级优化。

Method: 提出TKTO方法，无需配对数据，直接针对token级单位进行优化，自动提供细粒度对齐信号而无需token级标注。

Result: TKTO将日语TTS准确率提升39%，字符错误率降低54%，自动为目标token分配12.8倍更强的奖励。

Conclusion: TKTO通过消除配对数据需求和token级优化，实现了更高效的数据训练范式，显著提升了TTS系统的准确性和自然度。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-speech (TTS) system outputs with human feedback through
preference optimization has been shown to effectively improve the robustness
and naturalness of language model-based TTS models. Current approaches
primarily require paired desirable and undesirable samples at the utterance
level. However, such pairs are often limited in TTS output data, and
utterance-level formulation prevents fine-grained token-level optimization
needed for accurate pronunciation alignment. In this study, we propose TKTO
that eliminates the need for paired data, enabling a more data-efficient
training paradigm, and directly targets token-level units, automatically
providing fine-grained alignment signals without token-level annotations. TKTO
improves the challenging Japanese TTS accuracy by 39% and reduces CER by 54%,
automatically assigning 12.8 times stronger reward to targeted tokens.

TL;DR: EEPO是一个增强探索的强化学习框架，通过两阶段生成和自适应遗忘机制来解决LLM强化学习中探索不足的问题，在多个推理基准上显著优于GRPO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法过于强调利用，导致熵崩溃、探索能力下降和性能提升有限。虽然增加策略随机性可以促进探索，但往往无法摆脱主导行为模式，形成自我强化的循环。

Method: EEPO采用两阶段生成和自适应遗忘：第一阶段模型生成一半轨迹，然后通过轻量级遗忘步骤暂时抑制这些已采样的响应，迫使第二阶段探索输出空间的不同区域。

Result: 在五个推理基准测试中，EEPO显著优于GRPO：Qwen2.5-3B相对提升24.3%，Llama3.2-3B-Instruct提升33.0%，Qwen3-8B-Base提升10.4%。

Conclusion: EEPO通过样本-遗忘机制有效打破自我强化循环，在强化学习与可验证奖励的框架中实现了更好的探索-利用平衡。

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation remains a central challenge in
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) for large language models
(LLMs). Current RLVR methods often overemphasize exploitation, leading to
entropy collapse, diminished exploratory capacity, and ultimately limited
performance gains. Although techniques that increase policy stochasticity can
promote exploration, they frequently fail to escape dominant behavioral modes.
This creates a self-reinforcing loop-repeatedly sampling and rewarding dominant
modes-that further erodes exploration. We introduce Exploration-Enhanced Policy
Optimization (EEPO), a framework that promotes exploration via two-stage
rollouts with adaptive unlearning. In the first stage, the model generates half
of the trajectories; it then undergoes a lightweight unlearning step to
temporarily suppress these sampled responses, forcing the second stage to
explore different regions of the output space. This sample-then-forget
mechanism disrupts the self-reinforcing loop and promotes wider exploration
during rollouts. Across five reasoning benchmarks, EEPO outperforms GRPO,
achieving average relative gains of 24.3% on Qwen2.5-3B, 33.0% on
Llama3.2-3B-Instruct, and 10.4% on Qwen3-8B-Base.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型主要以英语为中心，导致法语等主要语言在小型语言模型上存在显著性能差距，现有多语言模型在法语上的表现远低于英语，且针对法语的高效适应方法研究有限。

Method: 通过对精选高质量法语数据进行有针对性的后训练，并采用策略性模型融合技术来增强双语性能。

Conclusion: Luth为法语小型语言模型建立了新的技术标准，为未来法语语言研究提供了强大的基准模型。

Abstract: The landscape of Large Language Models (LLMs) remains predominantly
English-centric, resulting in a significant performance gap for other major
languages, such as French, especially in the context of Small Language Models
(SLMs). Existing multilingual models demonstrate considerably lower performance
in French compared to English, and research on efficient adaptation methods for
French remains limited. To address this, we introduce \textbf{Luth}, a family
of French-specialized SLMs: through targeted post-training on curated,
high-quality French data, our models outperform all open-source counterparts of
comparable size on multiple French benchmarks while retaining their original
English capabilities. We further show that strategic model merging enhances
performance in both languages, establishing Luth as a new state of the art for
French SLMs and a robust baseline for future French-language research.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in text
summarization, yet their performance often falls short when applied to
specialized domains %or conversational data that differ from their original
pre-training distribution. While fine-tuning can improve summarization quality,
it typically relies on costly and scarce high-quality labeled data. In this
work, we explore continual pre-training as a scalable, self-supervised approach
to adapt LLMs for downstream summarization tasks, particularly in the context
of noisy real-world conversation transcripts. We conduct extensive experiments
using large-scale, unlabeled business conversation data to investigate whether
continual pre-training enhances model capabilities in conversational
summarization. Our results demonstrate that continual pre-training yields
substantial gains in both in-domain and out-of-domain summarization benchmarks,
while maintaining strong generalization and robustness. We also analyze the
effects of data selection strategies, providing practical guidelines for
applying continual pre-training in summarization-focused industrial
applications.

Motivation: 企业面临日益复杂的数字法规合规挑战，特别是小型企业缺乏资源起草复杂法律文件。现有自动合同生成服务缺乏实证证据支持其普及度和输出质量。

Method: 创建多语言基准数据集，捕捉瑞士和欧盟隐私法的关键合规义务；使用基于GPT-5的新方法进行大规模合规评估；测量法律修订的影响。

Conclusion: 研究为三个议题做出贡献：LLM在跨语言法律分析中的潜力、欧盟法规的布鲁塞尔效应，以及自动化工具在提高合规性和合同质量方面的作用。

Abstract: It has become increasingly challenging for firms to comply with a plethora of
novel digital regulations. This is especially true for smaller businesses that
often lack both the resources and know-how to draft complex legal documents.
Instead of seeking costly legal advice from attorneys, firms may turn to
cheaper alternative legal service providers such as automated contract
generators. While these services have a long-standing presence, there is little
empirical evidence on their prevalence and output quality.
  We address this gap in the context of a 2023 Swiss privacy law revision. To
enable a systematic evaluation, we create and annotate a multilingual benchmark
dataset that captures key compliance obligations under Swiss and EU privacy
law. Using this dataset, we validate a novel GPT-5-based method for large-scale
compliance assessment of privacy policies, allowing us to measure the impact of
the revision. We observe compliance increases indicating an effect of the
revision. Generators, explicitly referenced by 18% of local websites, are
associated with substantially higher levels of compliance, with increases of up
to 15 percentage points compared to privacy policies without generator use.
These findings contribute to three debates: the potential of LLMs for
cross-lingual legal analysis, the Brussels Effect of EU regulations, and,
crucially, the role of automated tools in improving compliance and contractual
quality.

Motivation: 长上下文模型在处理长序列时容易受到无关标记（上下文噪声）的干扰，这会误导模型注意力并影响预测准确性。

Method: 提出集成梯度评分来检测和量化上下文噪声，并开发了上下文去噪训练策略，通过强化关键标记的注意力来提升模型性能。

Result: 实验表明，即使简单的噪声缓解也能显著提升模型对关键标记的注意力。使用CDT训练的8B开源模型在性能上（50.92）接近GPT-4o（51.00）。

Conclusion: 上下文去噪训练是一种简单有效的策略，能够显著提升长上下文模型的性能，使其在多种任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Long-context models (LCMs) have demonstrated great potential in processing
long sequences, facilitating many real-world applications. The success of LCMs
can be attributed to their ability to locate implicit critical information
within the context for further prediction. However, recent research reveals
that LCMs are often susceptible to contextual noise, i.e., irrelevant tokens,
that can mislead model attention. In this paper, we conduct a fine-grained
analysis of the context noise and propose an effective metric, the Integrated
Gradient (IG) score, to detect and quantify the noise information within the
context. Our findings reveal that even simple mitigation of detected context
noise can substantially boost the model's attention on critical tokens and
benefit subsequent predictions. Building on this insight, we propose Context
Denoising Training (CDT), a straightforward yet effective training strategy
that improves attention on critical tokens while reinforcing their influence on
model predictions. Extensive experiments across four tasks, under both context
window scaling and long-context alignment settings, demonstrate the superiority
of CDT. Notably, when trained with CDT, an open-source 8B model can achieve
performance (50.92) comparable to GPT-4o (51.00).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在依赖长上下文的应用程序中广泛应用，虽然其推理和检索能力已被充分研究，但在安全关键场景下的行为尚不清楚，需要系统评估LLMs对有害内容的敏感性。

Method: 评估LLaMA-3、Qwen-2.5和Mistral等模型在扩展上下文中的有害内容检测能力，变化参数包括有害内容类型（显性vs隐性）、位置（开头、中间、结尾）、比例（0.01-0.50）和上下文长度（600-6000词元）。

Result: 观察到相似模式：性能在中等有害内容比例（0.25）时达到峰值，当内容非常稀疏或占主导地位时下降；召回率随上下文长度增加而降低；开头的有害句子检测更可靠；显性内容比隐性内容识别更一致。

Conclusion: 这些发现首次系统揭示了LLMs在长上下文中如何优先处理和校准有害内容，既展示了其新兴优势，也凸显了安全关键应用中仍面临的挑战。

retrieval, little is known about their behavior in safety-critical scenarios.
We evaluate LLMs' sensitivity to harmful content under extended context,
varying type (explicit vs. implicit), position (beginning, middle, end),
prevalence (0.01-0.50 of the prompt), and context length (600-6000 tokens).
Across harmful content categories such as toxic, offensive, and hate speech,
with LLaMA-3, Qwen-2.5, and Mistral, we observe similar patterns: performance
peaks at moderate harmful prevalence (0.25) but declines when content is very
sparse or dominant; recall decreases with increasing context length; harmful
sentences at the beginning are generally detected more reliably; and explicit
content is more consistently recognized than implicit. These findings provide
the first systematic view of how LLMs prioritize and calibrate harmful content
in long contexts, highlighting both their emerging strengths and the challenges
that remain for safety-critical use.

### [70] [The fragility of "cultural tendencies" in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05869)
*Kun Sun,Rong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 对Lu等人(2025)关于LLMs在不同语言提示下显示文化特定倾向的研究进行批判性重评估，认为其报告的"文化倾向"是特定模型和任务设计的脆弱产物，而非稳定特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质疑LSZ研究中关于LLMs在不同语言提示下显示文化特定倾向的结论，认为其实验方法、理论框架和解释存在问题。

Method: 使用更广泛的LLMs和更多测试项目进行针对性复制实验，检验提示语言对输出的影响。

Result: 结果显示提示语言对输出影响极小，挑战了LSZ关于这些模型编码了根深蒂固文化信念的主张。

Conclusion: LLMs在不同语言提示下表现出的"文化倾向"并非稳定的文化特征，而是特定模型和任务设计的脆弱产物。

Abstract: In a recent study, Lu, Song, and Zhang (2025) (LSZ) propose that large
language models (LLMs), when prompted in different languages, display
culturally specific tendencies. They report that the two models (i.e., GPT and
ERNIE) respond in more interdependent and holistic ways when prompted in
Chinese, and more independent and analytic ways when prompted in English. LSZ
attribute these differences to deep-seated cultural patterns in the models,
claiming that prompt language alone can induce substantial cultural shifts.
While we acknowledge the empirical patterns they observed, we find their
experiments, methods, and interpretations problematic. In this paper, we
critically re-evaluate the methodology, theoretical framing, and conclusions of
LSZ. We argue that the reported "cultural tendencies" are not stable traits but
fragile artifacts of specific models and task design. To test this, we
conducted targeted replications using a broader set of LLMs and a larger number
of test items. Our results show that prompt language has minimal effect on
outputs, challenging LSZ's claim that these models encode grounded cultural
beliefs.

TL;DR: 提出基于强化学习启发的提示优化框架，通过修改LLM代理的任务指令提示来实现长期规划，显著提升多轮交互任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮交互中表现欠佳，常依赖错误早期假设且无法跟踪用户目标，而对话系统研究表明长期规划对交互任务至关重要。

Method: 基于强化学习的提示优化框架，通过生成逐轮反馈和利用经验回放进行提示重写，仅修改LLM代理的任务指令提示。

Result: 在文本到SQL和面向任务对话等多轮任务中显示显著改进，且能泛化到不同LLM代理并利用多样化LLM作为元提示代理。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了强化学习启发的无参数优化方法在未来研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in a wide range
of natural language processing tasks and can be adapted through prompting.
However, they remain suboptimal in multi-turn interactions, often relying on
incorrect early assumptions and failing to track user goals over time, which
makes such tasks particularly challenging. Prior works in dialogue systems have
shown that long-term planning is essential for handling interactive tasks. In
this work, we propose a prompt optimisation framework inspired by reinforcement
learning, which enables such planning to take place by only modifying the task
instruction prompt of the LLM-based agent. By generating turn-by-turn feedback
and leveraging experience replay for prompt rewriting, our proposed method
shows significant improvement in multi-turn tasks such as text-to-SQL and
task-oriented dialogue. Moreover, it generalises across different LLM-based
agents and can leverage diverse LLMs as meta-prompting agents. This warrants
future research in reinforcement learning-inspired parameter-free optimisation
methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个四部分框架来分析文化基准的局限性，指出当前基准将文化简化为静态事实，并提出基于人类学方法的改进建议，以更准确地评估大语言模型在复杂文化情境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的文化评估基准往往将文化简化为静态事实或同质化价值观，这与人类学强调文化是动态、历史情境化和实践中的观点相冲突，需要更准确的文化评估方法。

Method: 引入四部分框架（知识、偏好、表现、偏见）来分类基准如何构建文化，定性分析20个文化基准，识别出六个常见方法问题，并基于人类学方法提出具体改进建议。

Result: 识别出六个主要方法问题：将国家等同于文化、忽视文化内部多样性、依赖过度简化的调查格式等，并提出了包含真实世界叙事、社区参与和情境评估的改进方案。

Conclusion: 需要开发超越静态记忆任务的文化基准，通过整合人类学方法更准确地捕捉模型在复杂文化情境中的响应能力，推动文化评估向更动态、情境化的方向发展。

Abstract: Cultural evaluation of large language models has become increasingly
important, yet current benchmarks often reduce culture to static facts or
homogeneous values. This view conflicts with anthropological accounts that
emphasize culture as dynamic, historically situated, and enacted in practice.
To analyze this gap, we introduce a four-part framework that categorizes how
benchmarks frame culture, such as knowledge, preference, performance, or bias.
Using this lens, we qualitatively examine 20 cultural benchmarks and identify
six recurring methodological issues, including treating countries as cultures,
overlooking within-culture diversity, and relying on oversimplified survey
formats. Drawing on established anthropological methods, we propose concrete
improvements: incorporating real-world narratives and scenarios, involving
cultural communities in design and validation, and evaluating models in context
rather than isolation. Our aim is to guide the development of cultural
benchmarks that go beyond static recall tasks and more accurately capture the
responses of the models to complex cultural situations.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: EvalMORAAL是一个透明的思维链框架，使用两种评分方法（对数概率和直接评分）加上模型作为评判者的同行评审，评估20个大语言模型的道德对齐。研究发现模型在西方地区表现更好（r=0.82），非西方地区表现较差（r=0.61），存在明显的区域偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型在不同文化背景下的道德对齐表现，识别区域偏见，推动文化感知AI的发展。

Method: 使用世界价值观调查（55个国家，19个主题）和PEW全球态度调查（39个国家，8个主题）作为基准；采用两种评分方法（对数概率和直接评分）；实施结构化思维链协议和自一致性检查；引入模型作为评判者的同行评审机制。

Result: 顶级模型与调查响应高度对齐（WVS的Pearson's r约0.90）；发现明显的区域差异：西方地区平均r=0.82，非西方地区平均r=0.61（绝对差距0.21）；同行评审标记了348个冲突；同行协议与调查对齐相关（WVS r=0.74，PEW r=0.39）。

Conclusion: 在文化感知AI方面取得了实际进展，但跨区域使用仍面临挑战；EvalMORAAL框架为公平比较提供了标准化方法，并支持自动化质量检查。

Abstract: We present EvalMORAAL, a transparent chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that
uses two scoring methods (log-probabilities and direct ratings) plus a
model-as-judge peer review to evaluate moral alignment in 20 large language
models. We assess models on the World Values Survey (55 countries, 19 topics)
and the PEW Global Attitudes Survey (39 countries, 8 topics). With EvalMORAAL,
top models align closely with survey responses (Pearson's r approximately 0.90
on WVS). Yet we find a clear regional difference: Western regions average
r=0.82 while non-Western regions average r=0.61 (a 0.21 absolute gap),
indicating consistent regional bias. Our framework adds three parts: (1) two
scoring methods for all models to enable fair comparison, (2) a structured
chain-of-thought protocol with self-consistency checks, and (3) a
model-as-judge peer review that flags 348 conflicts using a data-driven
threshold. Peer agreement relates to survey alignment (WVS r=0.74, PEW r=0.39,
both p<.001), supporting automated quality checks. These results show real
progress toward culture-aware AI while highlighting open challenges for use
across regions.

TL;DR: 研究表明大型语言模型（LLMs）能够在内部表征中编码数学问题的难度信息，通过线性探针可建模难度级别，并定位到特定注意力头，为自动难度标注提供实用支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLMs是否能在内部表征中隐含地编码问题难度，这对于自适应推理和高效资源分配至关重要，但目前对此了解甚少。

Method: 使用线性探针对LLMs的最终token表征进行分析，定位最终Transformer层中具有相反激活模式的特定注意力头，并通过消融实验验证定位准确性。

Result: 发现数学问题的难度级别可以通过线性建模，特定注意力头对简单和困难问题具有相反的激活模式，且token级别的熵和难度感知存在显著差异。

Conclusion: LLMs中的难度感知不仅存在，而且是结构化的，为自动难度标注提供了理论基础和实践方向，可大幅减少人工标注成本。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed on complex reasoning
tasks, yet little is known about their ability to internally evaluate problem
difficulty, which is an essential capability for adaptive reasoning and
efficient resource allocation. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs
implicitly encode problem difficulty in their internal representations. Using a
linear probe on the final-token representations of LLMs, we demonstrate that
the difficulty level of math problems can be linearly modeled. We further
locate the specific attention heads of the final Transformer layer: these
attention heads have opposite activation patterns for simple and difficult
problems, thus achieving perception of difficulty. Our ablation experiments
prove the accuracy of the location. Crucially, our experiments provide
practical support for using LLMs as automatic difficulty annotators,
potentially substantially reducing reliance on costly human labeling in
benchmark construction and curriculum learning. We also uncover that there is a
significant difference in entropy and difficulty perception at the token level.
Our study reveals that difficulty perception in LLMs is not only present but
also structurally organized, offering new theoretical insights and practical
directions for future research.

*Periklis Mantenoglou,Rishi Hazra,Pedro Zuidberg Dos Martires,Luc De Raedt*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LexiCon是一个基于自然语言的约束规划基准，用于评估LLM在约束规划任务中的表现，特别是安全约束。实验表明，最先进的LLM（包括GPT-5、o3和R1）在约束程度增加时性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在无约束规划任务中表现出色，但在现实世界中需要遵守约束（特别是安全约束），因此需要评估它们在约束规划任务中的能力。

Method: LexiCon通过现有规划环境施加时间约束，然后将这些约束问题转化为自然语言交给LLM解决。关键特性是可扩展性，支持新环境生成器自动构建时间约束。

Result: 实验结果显示，随着规划任务约束程度的增加，最先进LLM（包括GPT-5、o3和R1）的性能显著下降。

Conclusion: LexiCon提供了一个系统评估LLM约束规划能力的方法，揭示了当前LLM在约束规划方面的局限性，为未来改进提供了基准。

Abstract: Owing to their reasoning capabilities, large language models (LLMs) have been
evaluated on planning tasks described in natural language. However, LLMs have
largely been tested on planning domains without constraints. In order to deploy
them in real-world settings where adherence to constraints, in particular
safety constraints, is critical, we need to evaluate their performance on
constrained planning tasks. We introduce LexiCon -- a natural language-based
(Lexi) constrained (Con) planning benchmark, consisting of a suite of
environments, that can be used to evaluate the planning capabilities of LLMs in
a principled fashion. The core idea behind LexiCon is to take existing planning
environments and impose temporal constraints on the states. These constrained
problems are then translated into natural language and given to an LLM to
solve. A key feature of LexiCon is its extensibility. That is, the set of
supported environments can be extended with new (unconstrained) environment
generators, for which temporal constraints are constructed automatically. This
renders LexiCon future-proof: the hardness of the generated planning problems
can be increased as the planning capabilities of LLMs improve. Our experiments
reveal that the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, including reasoning
models like GPT-5, o3, and R1, deteriorates as the degree of constrainedness of
the planning tasks increases.

TL;DR: 本文通过对比两种评估方法（直接最小对比较 vs 差异中的差异），证明GPT-2在寄生间隙测试中表现出色，表明评估指标选择对判断LLM句法能力至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究使用不同评估方法得出矛盾结论：Wilcox等人使用直接最小对比较显示模型成功泛化填充语-间隙依赖知识，而Lan等人使用DiD指标发现模型在寄生间隙上失败。本文旨在澄清哪种方法更具诊断透明度。

Method: 生成完整的8种排列组合的寄生间隙刺激范式，使用GPT-2模型进行系统性的Wilcox式wh效应分析，直接比较最小对。

Result: GPT-2在所有四种测试条件下均成功，表明即使在复杂寄生间隙环境中，模型也具备稳健的填充语-间隙许可原则知识。

Conclusion: 直接最小对比较方法比DiD式指标提供更清晰的诊断，评估指标的选择对准确评估LLM的句法能力至关重要。

Abstract: Recent studies probing the Argument from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS)
have applied Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the learnability of complex
syntax through surprisal-based metrics. However, divergent conclusions raise
questions concerning the insights these metrics offer. While Wilcox et al.
(2024) used direct minimal pair comparisons (the "wh-effect") to demonstrate
that models successfully generalise knowledge of filler-gap dependencies, Lan
et al. (2024) used a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) metric and found that
models largely fail on parasitic gaps (PGs). This paper argues that the direct
minimal pair approach offers greater diagnostic transparency. We demonstrate
this by generating a full 8-permutation paradigm of refined PG stimuli and
evaluating the GPT-2 model used in previous studies with a systematic
Wilcox-style wh-effect analysis. Our results show that GPT-2 succeeds across
all four tested conditions, indicating robust knowledge of filler-gap licensing
principles even in complex PG environments. This finding, which contrasts with
the more ambiguous results from DiD-style metrics, suggests that the choice of
evaluation metric is critical for assessing an LLM's syntactic competence.

TL;DR: MASA提出了一种多A单B的LoRA改进架构，通过多专家A矩阵捕获多样化特征，解决了标准LoRA中单一降维矩阵导致的表示瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准LoRA方法依赖单一降维矩阵A，这形成了表示瓶颈，无法捕捉复杂任务所需的多样化信号。需要丰富特征适应能力以提升下游任务适应性能。

Method: 采用多A单B结构，多个专家A矩阵不对称地跨层共享以确保参数效率，专门的专家捕获多样化特征，然后由层特定的单一B矩阵进行整合。

Result: 在MMLU基准测试中，MASA平均准确率达到59.62%，比标准LoRA提升1.08个百分点（相对提升1.84%），可学习参数仅为0.52%。

Conclusion: MASA通过多专家特征提取和不对称共享机制，有效提升了参数效率微调的性能，在多个任务领域都表现出优越性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant method in
Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for large language models, which
augments the transformer layer with one down-projection $A$ and one
up-projection $B$. However, LoRA's reliance on a single down-projection matrix
($A$) creates a representational bottleneck, as this solitary feature extractor
is inherently insufficient for capturing the diverse signals required by
complex tasks. This motivates our architectural shift to focus on enriching the
feature adaptation to improve the downstream task adaptation ability. We
propose MASA (Multi-$A$ Shared Adaptation), an architecture that implements a
multi-$A$, single-$B$ structure where the multi-$A$ expert ensemble is
asymmetrically shared across layers to ensure parameter efficiency. In MASA,
these specialized experts capture diverse features, which are then integrated
by a single, layer-specific $B$-matrix. The effectiveness and versatility of
our method are validated through a comprehensive suite of experiments spanning
multi-domain generalization, single-domain specialization, and multi-task
reasoning. For example, on the MMLU benchmark, MASA achieves an average
accuracy of 59.62%, outperforming the standard LoRA by 1.08 points (a relative
improvement of 1.84%) with comparable learnable parameters of 0.52%.

Method: 1) 在先前使用的刺激物上建立基线；2) 使用最先进的生成式LLM（Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview）基于语言学模板生成新的精炼数据集，以减轻已识别的混淆因素。

Result: 初步发现表明，GPT-2在精炼刺激物上的表现相比基线有显著提升。

Conclusion: 刺激物质量显著影响基于惊讶度的LLM句法能力评估结果，改进刺激物设计可以更准确地评估模型的句法能力。

Abstract: Recent studies employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to test the Argument
from the Poverty of the Stimulus (APS) have yielded contrasting results across
syntactic phenomena. This paper investigates the hypothesis that
characteristics of the stimuli used in recent studies, including lexical
ambiguities and structural complexities, may confound model performance. A
methodology is proposed for re-evaluating LLM competence on syntactic
prediction, focusing on GPT-2. This involves: 1) establishing a baseline on
previously used (both filtered and unfiltered) stimuli, and 2) generating a
new, refined dataset using a state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative LLM (Gemini 2.5
Pro Preview) guided by linguistically-informed templates designed to mitigate
identified confounds. Our preliminary findings indicate that GPT-2 demonstrates
notably improved performance on these refined PG stimuli compared to baselines,
suggesting that stimulus quality significantly influences outcomes in
surprisal-based evaluations of LLM syntactic competency.

Motivation: 当前MM-RAG评估存在碎片化问题，要么孤立关注文本或图像，要么在简化的多模态设置下进行，无法捕捉文档中心的多模态用例。

Method: 从8个领域的70k真实PDF页面提取并链接文本、表格和图表证据，生成1,600个多模态QA对，涵盖事实检索、比较、摘要和逻辑推理查询，20%经过多标注者验证和专家裁决。

Result: 实验表明多模态文本-图像融合RAG系统始终优于单模态和联合多模态嵌入检索，表明单独文本或图像都不足够，当前多模态嵌入仍不充分。

Conclusion: 该基准不仅用于评测，还揭示了视觉上下文何时以及如何补充文本证据，发现了系统性失败模式，并为开发更稳健的MM-RAG管道提供了可操作指导。

Abstract: Multimodal retrieval-augmented generation (MM-RAG) is a key approach for
applying large language models (LLMs) and agents to real-world knowledge bases,
yet current evaluations are fragmented, focusing on either text or images in
isolation or on simplified multimodal setups that fail to capture
document-centric multimodal use cases. In this paper, we introduce
UniDoc-Bench, the first large-scale, realistic benchmark for MM-RAG built from
70k real-world PDF pages across eight domains. Our pipeline extracts and links
evidence from text, tables, and figures, then generates 1,600 multimodal QA
pairs spanning factual retrieval, comparison, summarization, and logical
reasoning queries. To ensure reliability, 20% of QA pairs are validated by
multiple annotators and expert adjudication. UniDoc-Bench supports
apples-to-apples comparison across four paradigms: (1) text-only, (2)
image-only, (3) multimodal text-image fusion, and (4) multimodal joint
retrieval -- under a unified protocol with standardized candidate pools,
prompts, and evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that multimodal
text-image fusion RAG systems consistently outperform both unimodal and jointly
multimodal embedding-based retrieval, indicating that neither text nor images
alone are sufficient and that current multimodal embeddings remain inadequate.
Beyond benchmarking, our analysis reveals when and how visual context
complements textual evidence, uncovers systematic failure modes, and offers
actionable guidance for developing more robust MM-RAG pipelines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide
range of natural language processing tasks. However, Chinese LLMs face unique
challenges, primarily due to the dominance of unstructured free text and the
lack of structured representations in Chinese corpora. While existing
benchmarks for LLMs partially assess Chinese LLMs, they are still predominantly
English-centric and fail to address the unique linguistic characteristics of
Chinese, lacking structured datasets essential for robust evaluation. To
address these challenges, we present a Comprehensive Benchmark for Evaluating
Chinese Large Language Models (CB-ECLLM) based on the newly constructed Chinese
Data-Text Pair (CDTP) dataset. Specifically, CDTP comprises over 7 million
aligned text pairs, each consisting of unstructured text coupled with one or
more corresponding triples, alongside a total of 15 million triples spanning
four critical domains. The core contributions of CDTP are threefold: (i)
enriching Chinese corpora with high-quality structured information; (ii)
enabling fine-grained evaluation tailored to knowledge-driven tasks; and (iii)
supporting multi-task fine-tuning to assess generalization and robustness
across scenarios, including Knowledge Graph Completion, Triple-to-Text
generation, and Question Answering. Furthermore, we conduct rigorous
evaluations through extensive experiments and ablation studies to assess the
effectiveness, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and robustness of the benchmark.
To support reproducible research, we offer an open-source codebase and outline
potential directions for future investigations based on our insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现现有LLM后训练方法中基于结果监督的强化学习存在根本缺陷：正优势token的重要性采样比率不匹配，导致正负token权重不平衡，抑制低概率token更新而过度放大高概率token。

Method: 提出非对称重要性采样策略优化(ASPO)，翻转正优势token的IS比率使其与负token的学习动态对齐，并采用软双剪裁机制稳定极端更新同时保持梯度流动。

Result: 在编程和数学推理基准测试中，ASPO显著缓解了过早收敛问题，提高了训练稳定性，并在基于GRPO的强基线基础上提升了最终性能。

Conclusion: 分析揭示了token级加权在OSRL中的重要作用，强调了在LLM强化学习中修正IS的关键性，ASPO为LLM后训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Model (LLM) post-training methods rely on token-level
clipping mechanisms during Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this Outcome-Supervised RL (OSRL) paradigm: the Importance
Sampling (IS) ratios of positive-advantage tokens are mismatched, leading to
unbalanced token weighting for positive and negative tokens. This mismatch
suppresses the update of low-probability tokens while over-amplifying already
high-probability ones. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Importance
Sampling Policy Optimization (ASPO), which uses a simple yet effective strategy
that flips the IS ratios of positive-advantage tokens, aligning their update
direction with the learning dynamics of negative ones. AIS further incorporates
a soft dual-clipping mechanism to stabilize extreme updates while maintaining
gradient flow. Comprehensive experiments on coding and mathematical reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that ASPO significantly mitigates premature convergence,
improves training stability, and enhances final performance over strong
GRPO-based baselines. Our analysis provides new insights into the role of
token-level weighting in OSRL and highlights the critical importance of
correcting IS in LLM RL. The code and models of ASPO are available at

Motivation: 当前语言模型后训练在提升指令跟随能力的同时，往往忽视了多有效答案任务中的性能代价，特别是上下文可控性和分布对齐能力的下降。

Method: 提出了Spectrum Suite评估资源，包含40多个数据源和90多个任务，用于评估模型转向不同分布的能力。并提出了Spectrum Tuning后训练方法来改善上下文可控性和分布覆盖。

Conclusion: 语言模型后训练需要在提升指令跟随能力的同时，保持上下文可控性和分布对齐能力，Spectrum Tuning为此提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Language model post-training has enhanced instruction-following and
performance on many downstream tasks, but also comes with an often-overlooked
cost on tasks with many possible valid answers. We characterize three
desiderata for conditional distributional modeling: in-context steerability,
valid output space coverage, and distributional alignment, and document across
three model families how current post-training can reduce these properties. In
particular, we disambiguate between two kinds of in-context learning: ICL for
eliciting existing underlying knowledge or capabilities, and in-context
steerability, where a model must use in-context information to override its
priors and steer to a novel data generating distribution. To better evaluate
and improve these desiderata, we introduce Spectrum Suite, a large-scale
resource compiled from >40 data sources and spanning >90 tasks requiring models
to steer to and match diverse distributions ranging from varied human
preferences to numerical distributions and more. We find that while current
post-training techniques help elicit underlying capabilities and knowledge,
they hurt models' ability to flexibly steer in-context. To mitigate these
issues, we propose Spectrum Tuning, a post-training method using Spectrum Suite
to improve steerability and distributional coverage. We find that Spectrum
Tuning often improves over pretrained models and their instruction-tuned
counterparts, enhancing steerability, spanning more of the output space, and
improving distributional alignment on held-out datasets.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现代码推理蒸馏存在"代码推理谷"现象：随着蒸馏数据量增加，下游编程竞赛性能先下降后以超对数线性方式增长。小模型在低数据量时从简单编程题获益更多，且训练数据正确性不影响蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究缺乏对蒸馏数据量与模型性能缩放趋势的系统分析，特别是在代码推理任务上。本文旨在探索小模型在代码推理蒸馏中的性能随数据量变化的规律。

Method: 在两个小型非推理LLM上进行竞争性编程技能蒸馏实验，研究不同数据量下的性能变化趋势，并在不同蒸馏阶段对相同数据进行微调以验证学习阶段差异。

Result: 发现代码推理蒸馏存在"代码推理谷"现象，性能先降后升；小模型在低数据量时从简单题目获益更大；训练数据正确性对蒸馏结果无显著影响。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对代码推理蒸馏训练动态的理解，揭示了数据量、题目难度和正确性等因素对蒸馏效果的影响规律。

Abstract: Distilling the thinking traces of a Large Language Model (LLM) with reasoning
capabilities into a smaller model has been proven effective. Yet, there is a
scarcity of work done on how model performances scale with the quantity of
distillation data. In this work, we study the scaling trend of distilling
competitive coding skills on two small non-reasoning LLMs. We validate the
hypothesis that there is a $\textit{valley of code reasoning}$: downstream
performance on competitive coding first drops as data quantity increases, then
it steadily increases in a sharper-than-log-linear fashion. Having identified
the trend, we further fine-tune the models at two different distillation stages
on the same data to ground conclusions on their respective learning phases. We
learn that across stages in the low and medium-low data regimes, small models
benefit significantly from easier coding questions than from harder ones. We
also find that, surprisingly, the correctness of outputs in training data makes
no difference to distillation outcomes. Our work represents a step forward in
understanding the training dynamics of code reasoning distillation outside
intuition

TL;DR: 本文提出了分布语义追踪（DST）框架，通过分析Transformer架构内部机制揭示了LLM幻觉的成因，识别出幻觉不可避免的承诺层，并基于双过程理论解释了联想路径与上下文路径冲突导致的推理捷径劫持现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM产生幻觉（生成看似合理但事实错误的陈述）的内在架构根源，旨在理解这种失败模式何时、如何以及为何在Transformer架构中发生。

Method: 提出分布语义追踪（DST）统一框架，整合现有可解释性技术生成模型推理的因果图；识别幻觉不可避免的承诺层；基于双过程理论分析联想路径与上下文路径的冲突机制。

Result: 发现上下文路径的连贯性与幻觉率呈强负相关（ρ = -0.863），表明这些失败是内部语义弱点的可预测结果；识别出导致幻觉的特定计算路径冲突。

Conclusion: 提供了关于Transformer架构中幻觉发生机制、时机和原因的机械解释，表明幻觉是内部语义弱点的可预测后果，为理解和缓解LLM幻觉问题提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are prone to hallucination, the generation of
plausible yet factually incorrect statements. This work investigates the
intrinsic, architectural origins of this failure mode through three primary
contributions.First, to enable the reliable tracing of internal semantic
failures, we propose \textbf{Distributional Semantics Tracing (DST)}, a unified
framework that integrates established interpretability techniques to produce a
causal map of a model's reasoning, treating meaning as a function of context
(distributional semantics). Second, we pinpoint the model's layer at which a
hallucination becomes inevitable, identifying a specific \textbf{commitment
layer} where a model's internal representations irreversibly diverge from
factuality. Third, we identify the underlying mechanism for these failures. We
observe a conflict between distinct computational pathways, which we interpret
using the lens of dual-process theory: a fast, heuristic \textbf{associative
pathway} (akin to System 1) and a slow, deliberate \textbf{contextual pathway}
(akin to System 2), leading to predictable failure modes such as
\textit{Reasoning Shortcut Hijacks}. Our framework's ability to quantify the
coherence of the contextual pathway reveals a strong negative correlation
($\rho = -0.863$) with hallucination rates, implying that these failures are
predictable consequences of internal semantic weakness. The result is a
mechanistic account of how, when, and why hallucinations occur within the
Transformer architecture.

TL;DR: 提出平行分词器框架，通过词汇表对齐确保语义等价词在不同语言中具有一致的索引表示，从而改善多语言模型的跨语言迁移能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分词方法在多语言场景下存在语义等价词被映射到不同嵌入向量的问题，限制了跨语言泛化能力，特别是在低资源语言中。

Method: 训练单语分词器后，使用双语词典或词对词翻译对词汇表进行穷尽式对齐，确保语义等价词具有一致的索引。

Result: 在13种低资源语言上预训练的模型在情感分析、仇恨言论检测、情感分类和句子嵌入相似度等任务中均优于传统多语言基线。

Conclusion: 重新思考分词策略对于推进多语言表示学习至关重要，特别是在低资源设置下，平行分词器能有效提升跨语言性能。

Abstract: Tokenization defines the foundation of multilingual language models by
determining how words are represented and shared across languages. However,
existing methods often fail to support effective cross-lingual transfer because
semantically equivalent words are assigned distinct embeddings. For example, "I
eat rice" in English and "Ina cin shinkafa" in Hausa are typically mapped to
different vocabulary indices, preventing shared representations and limiting
cross-lingual generalization. We introduce parallel tokenizers. This new
framework trains tokenizers monolingually and then aligns their vocabularies
exhaustively using bilingual dictionaries or word-to-word translation, ensuring
consistent indices for semantically equivalent words. This alignment enforces a
shared semantic space across languages while naturally improving fertility
balance. To assess their effectiveness, we pretrain a transformer encoder from
scratch on thirteen low-resource languages and evaluate it on sentiment
analysis, hate speech detection, emotion classification, and sentence embedding
similarity. Across all tasks, models trained with parallel tokenizers
outperform conventional multilingual baselines, confirming that rethinking
tokenization is essential for advancing multilingual representation
learning--especially in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 提出了CreditDecoding算法，通过利用历史logits信息来加速扩散大语言模型的并行解码，减少冗余迭代，在保持性能的同时实现显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散大语言模型在并行解码时，由于初始置信度低，经常重复掩码token，导致冗余迭代，限制了整体加速效果。

Method: 引入Trace Credit概念量化token的收敛潜力，通过融合当前logits和历史Trace Credit来加速正确但置信度不足的token的收敛过程。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，相比LLaDA-8B-Instruct实现5.48倍加速和0.48性能提升，相比LLaDA-MoE-Instruct实现4.11倍加速和0.15性能提升。

Conclusion: CreditDecoding能有效扩展到长序列，且与主流推理优化正交，是一个易于集成且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) generate text through iterative
denoising steps, achieving parallel decoding by denoising only high-confidence
positions at each step. However, existing approaches often repetitively remask
tokens due to initially low confidence scores, leading to redundant iterations
and limiting overall acceleration. Through the analysis of dLLM decoding
traces, we observe that the model often determines the final prediction for a
token several steps before the decoding step. To leverage this historical
information and avoid redundant steps, we introduce the concept of Trace
Credit, which quantifies each token's convergence potential by accumulating
historical logits. Furthermore, we propose CreditDecoding, a training-free
parallel decoding algorithm that accelerates the confidence convergence of
correct but underconfident tokens by fusing current logits with Trace Credit.
This process significantly reduces redundant iterations and enhances decoding
robustness. On eight benchmarks, CreditDecoding achieves a 5.48 times speedup
and a 0.48 performance improvement over LLaDA-8B-Instruct, and a 4.11 times
speedup with a 0.15 performance improvement over LLaDA-MoE-Instruct.
Importantly, CreditDecoding scales effectively to long sequences and is
orthogonal to mainstream inference optimizations, making it a readily
integrable and versatile solution.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: RoSE是一种无需人工标注的代理指标，用于选择最佳LLM生成器来产生合成训练数据，在低资源语言场景下特别有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在低资源语言场景下，由于缺乏人工标注数据，难以通过外在评估选择最佳LLM生成器的问题，同时克服内在指标与下游性能相关性差的问题。

Method: 提出轮询合成数据评估方法：在候选生成器的输出上训练一个小模型，然后在所有其他候选生成器生成的合成示例上评估该模型，最终RoSE得分是该小模型的平均性能。

Result: 在6个LLM、11种语言和3个任务上的实验表明，RoSE比任何其他内在启发式方法更频繁地识别出最优生成器，与最优生成器基线的差距仅为0.76个百分点。

Conclusion: RoSE是唯一与人类测试数据性能呈正相关的指标，为低资源语言场景下选择最佳LLM生成器提供了有效的无监督解决方案。

Abstract: LLMs are powerful generators of synthetic data, which are used for training
smaller, specific models. This is especially valuable for low-resource
languages, where human-labelled data is scarce but LLMs can still produce
high-quality text. However, LLMs differ in how useful their outputs are for
training. Selecting the best LLM as a generator is challenging because
extrinsic evaluation requires costly human annotations (which are often
unavailable for low-resource languages), while intrinsic metrics correlate
poorly with downstream performance. We introduce Round robin Synthetic data
Evaluation (RoSE), a proxy metric for selecting the best LLM generator without
human test sets. RoSE trains a small model on the outputs of a candidate
generator (LLM) and then evaluates it on generated synthetic examples from all
other candidate LLMs. The final RoSE score is the mean performance of this
small model. Across six LLMs, eleven languages, and three tasks (sentiment,
topic, intent), RoSE identifies the optimal generator more often than any other
intrinsic heuristics. RoSE outperforms intrinsic heuristics and comes within
0.76 percentage points of the optimal generator baseline. This result is
measured in terms of downstream performance, obtained by training a small model
on the chosen generator's outputs (optimal vs. proxy metric selected) and
evaluating it on human-labelled test data. Additionally, RoSE is the only
metric to achieve a positive correlation with performance on human test data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: VecInfer是一种新颖的向量量化方法，通过平滑和Hadamard变换抑制键缓存中的异常值，实现KV缓存的激进压缩，在2位量化下性能接近全精度，同时显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型推理中KV缓存带来的巨大内存开销问题，特别是在超低位宽下现有向量量化方法因键缓存异常值导致性能严重下降的问题。

Method: 应用平滑和Hadamard变换抑制键缓存异常值，使码本能全面覆盖原始数据分布；设计优化的CUDA内核，将计算与反量化融合以减少内存访问开销。

Result: 在2位量化下性能与全精度相当，在Llama-3.1-8B模型上实现2.7倍的大批量自注意力计算加速和8.3倍的单批次端到端延迟降低。

Conclusion: VecInfer在长上下文理解和数学推理任务中始终优于现有量化基线，为LLM推理提供了高效的KV缓存压缩解决方案。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache introduces substantial memory overhead during large
language model (LLM) inference. Although existing vector quantization (VQ)
methods reduce KV cache usage and provide flexible representational capacity
across bit-widths, they suffer severe performance degradation at ultra-low
bit-widths due to key cache outliers that hinder effective codebook
utilization. To address this challenge, we propose VecInfer, a novel VQ method
for aggressive KV cache compression while enabling efficient inference. By
applying smooth and Hadamard transformations, VecInfer suppresses outliers in
the key cache, enabling the codebook to comprehensively cover the original data
distribution and thereby reducing quantization difficulty. To facilitate
efficient deployment, we design an optimized CUDA kernel that fuses computation
with dequantization to minimize memory access overhead. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that VecInfer consistently outperforms existing quantization
baselines across both long-context understanding and mathematical reasoning
tasks. With only 2-bit quantization, VecInfer achieves performance comparable
to full precision, while delivering up to $\mathbf{2.7\times}$ speedup in
large-batch self-attention computation and $\mathbf{8.3\times}$ reduction in
single-batch end-to-end latency on Llama-3.1-8B with a 196k sequence length.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 语言模型在上下文推理中通过位置、词汇和自反三种机制来绑定和检索实体，随着绑定实体数量增加，位置机制变得不可靠，模型会混合使用其他机制来补偿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型如何在复杂情境下绑定和检索实体，特别是当绑定实体数量增加时，原有的位置机制表现不佳，需要探索其他补偿机制。

Method: 在9个模型和10个绑定任务上进行广泛实验，分析语言模型混合使用位置、词汇和自反三种机制的模式，并开发结合这三种机制的因果模型。

Result: 发现语言模型确实混合使用三种机制来驱动行为，开发的因果模型能够以95%的准确率估计下一个token的分布，并且在更长的开放式文本中也能很好地泛化。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了语言模型在上下文中绑定和检索实体的更完整图景，揭示了模型在复杂情境下如何通过混合机制来维持推理能力。

Abstract: A key component of in-context reasoning is the ability of language models
(LMs) to bind entities for later retrieval. For example, an LM might represent
"Ann loves pie" by binding "Ann" to "pie", allowing it to later retrieve "Ann"
when asked "Who loves pie?" Prior research on short lists of bound entities
found strong evidence that LMs implement such retrieval via a positional
mechanism, where "Ann" is retrieved based on its position in context. In this
work, we find that this mechanism generalizes poorly to more complex settings;
as the number of bound entities in context increases, the positional mechanism
becomes noisy and unreliable in middle positions. To compensate for this, we
find that LMs supplement the positional mechanism with a lexical mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" using its bound counterpart "pie") and a reflexive mechanism
(retrieving "Ann" through a direct pointer). Through extensive experiments on
nine models and ten binding tasks, we uncover a consistent pattern in how LMs
mix these mechanisms to drive model behavior. We leverage these insights to
develop a causal model combining all three mechanisms that estimates next token
distributions with 95% agreement. Finally, we show that our model generalizes
to substantially longer inputs of open-ended text interleaved with entity
groups, further demonstrating the robustness of our findings in more natural
settings. Overall, our study establishes a more complete picture of how LMs
bind and retrieve entities in-context.

Motivation: 现有工作大多采用单次设置，忽略了科学研究开发中迭代和反馈驱动的真实工作流程，需要评估LLM在多轮交互中生成正确可执行代码的能力。

Method: 构建RECODE-H基准测试，包含结构化指令、单元测试和五级反馈层次；开发ReCodeAgent框架，将反馈整合到迭代代码生成过程中。

Result: 实验显示，使用更丰富的反馈可以显著提升GPT-5、Claude-Sonnet-4、DeepSeek-V3.1和Gemini 2.5等领先LLM的性能，但在生成复杂研究代码方面仍存在挑战。

Conclusion: RECODE-H为在科学研究实施中开发自适应、反馈驱动的LLM代理奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific
research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable
code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring
the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific
research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of
102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents
through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes
structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to
reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present
ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code
generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4,
DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer
feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of
complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉语作为低资源语言且方言多样性高，现有系统未针对实时使用优化且仅关注标准孟加拉语，需要开发支持地区方言的实时语音助手。

Method: 采用客户端-服务器架构和RTP协议确保低延迟通信；开发方言感知ASR系统BRDialect，通过在10种孟加拉地区方言上微调IndicWav2Vec模型来处理方言差异。

Result: BRDialect在RegSpeech12数据集上比基线ASR模型性能提升12.41-33.98%；系统可在24kbps低带宽下运行，平均端到端延迟为4.9秒。

Conclusion: 低带宽使用和最小端到端延迟使系统具有成本效益和交互性，为多样化的孟加拉语使用者群体提供包容和可访问的语音技术。

Abstract: Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring
improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language
with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in
developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use
and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the
first real-time speech assistance system for Bengali regional dialects.
BanglaTalk follows the client-server architecture and uses the Real-time
Transport Protocol (RTP) to ensure low-latency communication. To address
dialectal variation, we introduce a dialect-aware ASR system, BRDialect,
developed by fine-tuning the IndicWav2Vec model in ten Bengali regional
dialects. It outperforms the baseline ASR models by 12.41-33.98% on the
RegSpeech12 dataset. Furthermore, BanglaTalk can operate at a low bandwidth of
24 kbps while maintaining an average end-to-end delay of 4.9 seconds. Low
bandwidth usage and minimal end-to-end delay make the system both
cost-effective and interactive for real-time use cases, enabling inclusive and
accessible speech technology for the diverse community of Bengali speakers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归语音-文本模型存在语音标记序列远长于文本标记的问题，导致模态间计算不平衡、训练推理效率低，并阻碍语音与文本的有效对齐，影响模型扩展性。

Method: 引入LST模型，动态且低成本地将语音标记聚合为潜在语音片段，这些片段可作为与文本单元对齐的高级单元，或封装常见语音序列以提高计算效率。

Result: LST在语音-语音和文本-文本基准测试中优于传统方法，在计算控制和数据控制设置下均表现更好，HellaSwag故事完成任务中语音准确率分别提升6.5%和5.3%。

Conclusion: LST通过潜在语音片段机制有效提升了语音-文本模型的数据效率和性能，表明更有效的表示对齐和更陡峭的扩展规律，将促进相关研究发展。

Abstract: Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large
number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech
tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated
state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation
benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the
representational alignment between text and speech. Nevertheless, they suffer
from shortcomings, partly owing to the disproportionately longer sequences of
speech tokens in contrast to textual tokens. This results in a large compute
imbalance between modalities during pre-training as well as during inference,
and a potential hindrance to effectively aligning speech and text, ultimately
translating to several orders of magnitude slower scaling laws. We introduce
the Latent Speech-Text Transformer (LST), which makes pre-training speech-text
models more data-efficient by dynamically and inexpensively aggregating speech
tokens into latent speech patches. These patches serve as higher-level units
that can either align with corresponding textual units to aid capability
transfer or even encapsulate common speech sequences like silences to be more
compute-efficient. We show that LST outperforms vanilla approaches on
speech-to-speech as well as text-to-text benchmarks in both data- and
compute-controlled settings, the former indicating more effective
representational alignment and the latter indicating steeper scaling laws for
speech-text models. On HellaSwag story completion, LST achieves 6.5% absolute
gain in speech accuracy under compute-controlled training and 5.3% under
data-controlled training, while also improving text performance. We will
release our models, code, and the evaluation data to facilitate further
research.

Conclusion: CogRE框架有效解决了少样本关系抽取中的注意力聚焦不足和学习能力有限的问题，显著提升了任务性能和解释质量。

Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for relation extraction (RE) that enhances
both accuracy and explainability. The framework has two key components: (i) a
reasoning mechanism that formulates relation extraction as a series of
text-processing steps inspired by cognitive science, and (ii) an optimization
process driven by reinforcement learning (RL) with a novel reward function
designed to improve both task accuracy and explanation quality. We call our
approach CogRE. Our framework addresses the lack of supervision for
language-based explanations in traditional RE by promoting outputs that include
important relation keywords. These keywords are drawn from a high-quality
dictionary that is automatically constructed using an LLM. We evaluate our
approach for the task of one-shot RE using two LLMs and two RE datasets. Our
experiments show that CogRE improves explanation quality by addressing two
common failure patterns in one-shot RE: poor attention focus and limited
one-shot learning capability. For example, our cognitive-structured reasoning
with Qwen2.5-15B-Instruct on One-shot NYT29 achieves 24.65% F1, surpassing
prior reasoning-based designs. Optimizing this approach with RL using our
reward further improves performance by +23.46% (absolute). Finally, human
evaluation shows that our best model generates relational keywords closely
aligned with gold labels, increasing human explanation quality ratings by 54%
(relative).

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical

Conclusion: 该技术在不同肤色范围内表现出高精度检测能力，使其成为现实世界应用的有前景选择。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出DeepAf自动对焦框架，将传统显微镜改造为低成本数字病理扫描仪，通过单次拍摄预测最佳焦距，减少80%对焦时间，在4倍放大倍率下实现0.90 AUC的癌症分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全玻片成像扫描仪成本高、传统自动显微镜对焦不稳定、现有深度学习方法需要多张输入图像或缺乏泛化能力的问题，为资源受限的医疗环境提供可负担的数字病理解决方案。

Method: 开发DeepAf自动对焦框架，通过混合架构结合空间和光谱特征进行单次对焦预测，自动回归到最佳焦距点的距离并调整控制参数。

Result: 对焦时间比堆栈方法减少80%，对焦精度达0.18μm，跨实验室泛化能力强，仅0.72%错误对焦预测，90%预测在景深范围内。在536个脑组织样本临床研究中，4倍放大倍率下癌症分类AUC达0.90。

Conclusion: 该系统提供全面的硬件-软件设计，能够在资源受限环境中实现可访问的实时数字病理，同时保持诊断准确性。

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型经常产生结构不一致的幻觉样本，这些样本超出了真实数据分布的支持范围。虽然语义插值有助于生成多样性，但需要更精细的解决方案。

Method: 提出Dynamic Guidance方法，仅在已知导致伪影的方向上选择性锐化分数函数，同时保留有效的语义变化。

Result: Dynamic Guidance在受控和自然图像数据集上显著减少了幻觉，明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在生成时而非通过后处理过滤来解决幻觉问题的方法，有效平衡了生成质量和多样性。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理过程中潜在变量的冗余性为加速提供了切入点，但现有的基于缓存的加速方法往往导致去噪和解码阶段内存使用激增。

Method: 1) 异步缓存交换；2) 特征分块；3) 切片潜在变量解码。这三种策略针对不同推理阶段特点设计，确保引入的时间开销低于加速收益。

Result: 与基线相比，该方法实现了更快的推理速度和更低的内存使用，同时质量下降保持在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: 提出的阶段特定优化策略有效解决了缓存加速方法中的内存激增问题，在保持视频生成质量的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is

Conclusion: 该方法展示了从热残留痕迹中恢复过去场景状态的潜力，为时间反演成像技术开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

Motivation: 解决使用复合查询检索图像的问题，即结合图像中的对象实例信息和自然语言描述（如对象在做什么或在哪里）来检索特定图像。

Method: 设计了一个映射网络，将局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，然后与自然语言查询结合，用于CLIP风格的文本编码和图像检索。每个对象实例只需训练一次映射网络。

Result: 该方法在两个个性化检索基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的pi-map方法与冻结的CLIP文本和图像编码器结合，在个性化图像检索任务上表现优异。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

TL;DR: ArchitectHead是首个支持连续控制细节层次的3D高斯头像框架，通过UV特征场和动态重采样实现渲染效率与视觉质量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS头像使用固定数量的高斯点，无法根据实际需求调整细节层次，限制了在需要平衡渲染效率和视觉质量的应用中的实用性。

Method: 在2D UV特征空间中参数化高斯点，构建多级可学习特征图组成的UV特征场，通过轻量级神经网络解码器将潜在特征转换为3D高斯属性，通过动态重采样特征图控制高斯点数量。

Result: 在最高细节层次下实现最先进的自我和跨身份重演质量，在最低细节层次仅使用6.2%的高斯点，质量适度下降（L1损失+7.9%，PSNR -0.97%，SSIM -0.6%，LPIPS损失+24.1%），渲染速度几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: ArchitectHead无需重新训练即可实现细节层次的连续控制，在保持高质量的同时显著提升渲染效率，为3D头像应用提供了实用的细节层次调节能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

Conclusion: 提出的黎曼度量方法能够有效利用扩散模型学习的数据流形，实现更自然的插值效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

Conclusion: Teamwork提供了一种高效灵活的方法来扩展扩散模型的输入输出能力，同时保持预训练模型的完整性，适用于广泛的图形学应用。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法主要专注于获取识别或运动的丰富表示，而非两者兼顾。潜在动态建模在决策制定中用于学习观测的潜在表示及其随时间的变化，但尚未应用于视觉表示学习。

Method: Midway Network利用中间自顶向下路径推断视频帧之间的运动潜在变量，采用密集前向预测目标和层次结构处理自然视频的复杂多对象场景。

Conclusion: Midway Network能够同时学习物体识别和运动理解的视觉表示，其学习的动态可以通过前向特征扰动的新分析方法捕捉高级对应关系。

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based
refinement. The resulting digital twins exhibit complete and precise geometry,
physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

Method: 在视觉空间提出对比视觉增强器，将视觉特征解耦为目标区域和低信息区域，识别主导令牌并动态抑制其表示；在文本空间引入判别概念校准器，区分文本查询中的通用概念和判别概念，改善判别概念的表示。

Result: 在涵盖三个图像检索任务的七个基准测试中均取得了持续改进，验证了CalibCLIP的有效性。

Conclusion: CalibCLIP通过校准主导令牌的抑制效应，有效解决了视觉语言模型中的语义主导问题，在图像检索任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ShortCoTI是一个轻量级优化框架，通过强化学习减少图像生成中的Chain-of-Thought推理长度，在保持图像质量的同时提高计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型使用Chain-of-Thought推理来增强图像生成的对齐性和细节，但这种方法引入了不必要的冗余（视觉过度思考），增加了计算成本并可能产生与原始提示矛盾的细节。

Method: 提出ShortCoTI框架，使用自适应奖励函数鼓励更简洁的CoT序列，通过强化学习范式减少提示推理长度。

Result: 在多个基准测试（T2I-CompBench、GenEval）上，提示推理长度减少了54%，同时保持或略微提高了质量指标。定性分析显示消除了冗余解释和重复优化。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI在不影响生成图像保真度或视觉吸引力的前提下，显著提高了计算效率，产生既简洁又语义丰富的推理提示。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

TL;DR: HOI-R1首次探索了纯文本方法在HOI检测任务中的潜力，无需额外检测模块，通过HOI推理过程和奖励函数实现，在HICO-DET数据集上达到基线准确率的2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOI检测方法依赖VLM先验知识，训练策略和模型架构复杂，且MLLM在HOI检测中的推理能力未被充分探索。

Method: 提出HOI-R1，采用强化学习方法训练MLLM，引入HOI推理过程和HOID奖励函数，通过纯文本解决HOI检测任务。

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，HOI-R1达到基线准确率的2倍，具有优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 证明了语言模型在HOI检测任务中的潜力，无需复杂检测模块即可实现高性能。

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

Conclusion: ECM框架有效解决了自回归模型在空间条件生成中的效率问题，为复杂图像生成任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: PointNSP提出了一种从粗到细的自回归点云生成框架，通过多尺度分解解决了传统自回归方法在无序点集上强加人工排序的问题，首次在自回归范式中实现了SOTA生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自回归点云生成方法因对无序点集强加人工排序而导致性能落后于扩散方法，这种顺序偏差削弱了模型捕捉长程依赖关系的能力，难以保持全局结构属性如对称性和几何规律性。

Method: 基于形状建模中的细节层次原理，提出PointNSP框架：在低分辨率下保持全局形状结构，通过下一尺度预测范式逐步在高尺度上细化几何细节，实现多尺度分解。

Result: 在ShapeNet上的实验表明，PointNSP首次在自回归范式中达到SOTA生成质量，在参数、训练和推理效率上超越强扩散基线，在8192点密集生成中优势更加明显。

Conclusion: PointNSP通过多尺度分解使自回归目标与点集的置换不变性对齐，实现了丰富的尺度内交互，避免了脆弱的固定排序，展现了良好的可扩展性潜力。

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

TL;DR: InstaGeo是一个开源端到端框架，解决地理空间基础模型部署的两大限制：缺乏自动化地理空间数据管道和大型微调模型。通过集成自动数据整理、任务特定模型蒸馏和无缝部署，将研究级模型转化为实用的低碳工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地理空间基础模型缺乏处理原始卫星图像的工作流程，下游适配通常保留原始编码器的全部复杂性，限制了实际部署。需要解决自动化数据处理和模型压缩问题。

Method: 集成三个核心组件：(1) 自动数据整理将原始图像转换为模型就绪数据集；(2) 任务特定模型蒸馏获得紧凑的计算高效模型；(3) 作为交互式网络地图应用无缝部署。

Result: 在三个已发表研究中复现数据集，模型性能差异微小：洪水映射-0.73pp，作物分割-0.20pp，沙漠蝗虫预测+1.79pp。蒸馏模型比标准微调模型小8倍，减少FLOPs和CO2排放。

Conclusion: InstaGeo通过统一数据准备、模型压缩和部署，将研究级地理空间基础模型转化为实用的低碳工具，推动地理空间AI向数据质量和应用驱动创新转变。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model

Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的伪造检测器通常被视为黑盒，不清楚它们是否真正依赖频谱域中的周期性峰值，这限制了检测器的可解释性和可信度。

Method: 提出了一种去除图像频谱峰值的方法，并分析了该操作对多种检测器的影响；同时引入了一个仅依赖频率峰值的简单线性检测器作为完全可解释的基准。

Result: 研究发现大多数检测器并不从根本上依赖频谱峰值，挑战了该领域的普遍假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作为开发更透明可靠的取证工具铺平了道路，强调了检测器可解释性的重要性。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

Conclusion: CHEST损失通过结合双曲和欧几里得空间的代理损失以及双曲层次聚类正则化，在深度度量学习中取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 眼源性异常头位姿势的早期诊断可减少并发症，但当前临床评估主要依赖主观判断且受不完整医疗记录影响。

Method: AHP-CADNet采用多级注意力融合框架，整合眼部标志点、头部姿势特征和结构化临床属性；同时设计了课程学习插补框架，逐步利用结构化和非结构化临床数据。

Result: 在PoseGaze-AHP数据集上，AHP-CADNet分类准确率达96.9-99.0%，连续变量预测MAE为0.103-0.199，R²超过0.93；插补框架准确率达93.46-99.78%，临床依赖建模显著改善(p<0.001)。

Conclusion: 两个框架在临床环境中对自动诊断和数据缺失恢复具有有效性。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

Conclusion: ARGUS通过有效捕获肿瘤微环境中的宏观-中观-微观层次信息，显著提升了肝癌组织学分型的性能，为临床诊断提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise

*Jialu Gao,K J Joseph,Fernando De La Torre*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的流程，利用预训练扩散模型将人物从参考图像无缝插入到背景场景中，实现真实的人物场景合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将人物放置和个性化处理视为独立问题，忽略了它们之间的相互联系，且依赖特定任务训练。本文旨在开发一个统一的无需训练框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 结合反转技术和无分类器引导实现全局编辑，并提出掩码引导的自注意力机制来保持人物身份特征。

Result: 在多样化合成场景图像中实现了最先进的结果，在背景和人物身份保持方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 扩散模型本身具备在复杂场景中放置人物的知识，无需特定任务训练即可实现高质量的人物插入。

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种多模态架构用于古典音乐会的自动视频编辑，将问题分解为"何时剪辑"和"如何剪辑"两个子任务，在剪辑点检测和视觉镜头选择方面优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化视频编辑在计算机视觉和多媒体领域仍未被充分探索，特别是与视频生成和场景理解相比。本文专注于多摄像机古典音乐会的编辑挑战。

Method: 使用轻量级卷积-Transformer管道集成音频log-mel频谱图、可选图像嵌入和标量时间特征进行时间分割；使用CLIP编码器改进空间选择，并将干扰项选择限制在同一音乐会片段内。

Result: 模型在检测剪辑点方面优于先前基线方法，并提供具有竞争力的视觉镜头选择，推动了多模态自动视频编辑的技术发展。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分解编辑任务和采用多模态架构，在自动视频编辑方面取得了先进成果，为音乐会视频编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于低成本图像监测系统的新型图像分析流程，用于评估立枯丝核菌对莴苣种子萌发和早期发育的影响。该方法通过形态学和空间特征结合时间整合，在复杂条件下实现了高精度的幼苗计数和活力评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像分析方法在幼苗重叠和交织的复杂条件下难以准确识别和计数，需要开发更稳健的方法来评估病原菌对种子萌发和早期发育的影响。

Method: 部署多个摄像头连续捕捉感染组和对照组的萌发过程图像，开发了结合形态学和空间特征的新型图像分析流程，并采用时间整合策略，考虑当前状态和先前时间点的发展轨迹。

Result: R. solani感染显著降低了萌发率和早期幼苗活力。该方法在计数和活力评估方面表现出高准确性，即使在密集交织的生长场景中也能准确工作，决定系数达0.98，均方根误差为1.12。

Conclusion: 验证了将低成本成像硬件与先进计算工具结合以非破坏性和可扩展方式获取表型数据的可行性，时间整合方法在传统分割技术失效的后期阶段特别有效。

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于对象级掩码的图像建模方法，通过将视觉对象视为视觉等价于语言中的单词，来提升视觉模型的语义理解和推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型在推理和上下文学习能力方面落后于语言模型，这可能源于视觉Transformer训练方案中缺乏语义和上下文指导。

Method: 采用掩码图像建模框架，但将掩码应用于视觉对象而非随机图像块，直接建模对象作为视觉等价于单词的语义单元。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明，对象级表示有助于学习真实世界分布，而像素平均捷径在没有这种表示时经常被学习。在VQA、GQA、ScienceQA等任务上，多模态大语言模型展现出更强的推理和上下文理解能力。

Conclusion: 对象级编码是开发更强视觉编码器和分词器的有效方向，能够显著提升视觉模型的语义理解和推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在从参考照片生成身份一致图像时难以准确控制年龄，且微调通常需要昂贵的跨年龄配对图像。

Method: 利用衰老的线性特性，引入年龄条件提示混合和基于SVDMix矩阵融合技术的年龄特定LoRA融合策略，实现中间年龄肖像的高质量生成。

Result: AgeBooth能从单张参考图像生成不同年龄段的真实且身份一致的人脸图像，在年龄控制和视觉质量方面优于先前最先进的基于编辑的方法。

Conclusion: AgeBooth提供了一种无需大量年龄标注数据的有效年龄控制解决方案，在保持身份一致性的同时实现了高质量的年龄变换。

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Result: 在PASCAL-5i和COCO-20i数据集上表现出色，超越了同期工作的小样本语义分割性能。

Conclusion: 该方法无需手动标注，能有效提升下游任务性能，为数据增强提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了OmniGen基准测试和FusionDetect方法，用于解决合成图像检测中的跨生成器和跨视觉域泛化问题。FusionDetect结合CLIP和Dinov2模型，在现有基准和新的OmniGen基准上都取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成图像检测工作主要关注跨生成器泛化，但忽略了同等重要的跨视觉域泛化挑战。为了更真实地评估检测器性能，需要构建包含多种生成器和视觉域的综合基准。

Method: 提出FusionDetect方法，利用两个冻结的基础模型CLIP和Dinov2提取特征，构建统一的特征空间来适应生成器内容和设计的变化。

Result: FusionDetect在现有基准上比最接近的竞争对手准确率提高3.87%，平均精度提高6.13%；在OmniGen基准上准确率提高4.48%，并对常见图像扰动具有出色的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 本文不仅提出了性能最佳的检测器，还引入了新的基准和框架，为通用AI图像检测的进一步发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

Motivation: 解决LiDAR点云手动标注成本高、耗时的问题，完全消除对人类标注的依赖。

Method: 使用视觉基础模型生成初始伪标签，通过时空投票模块结合2D和3D语义进行优化，引入2D先验损失和原型对比损失进行语义监督。

Result: 在无监督3D实例分割中达到新SOTA，性能超越使用2D边界框监督的MWSIS方法2.53%（50.95% vs 48.42% mAP）。

Conclusion: ALISE证明了完全无监督的LiDAR实例分割的可行性，为降低标注成本提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉搜索采用多阶段级联架构，查询图像和商品在不同阶段的表示存在差异，导致难以在用户体验和转化率之间达到帕累托最优。

Method: 基于VRQ（视觉对齐残差量化编码）构建OneVision框架，采用多阶段语义对齐方案，在保持强视觉相似性先验的同时有效融入用户特定信息。

Result: 离线评估与在线MCA性能相当，推理效率提升21%；A/B测试显示：商品点击率+2.15%，转化率+2.27%，订单量+3.12%。

Conclusion: 以语义ID为中心的生成式架构能够统一检索和个性化，同时简化服务路径。

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

Motivation: 深度学习在遥感图像场景分类中表现优异，但需要大量训练样本且对标签错误敏感。遥感领域获取高可靠性标签成本高、数量有限，但存在许多可靠性较低的标签数据源（如过时数字地图）。

Method: 结合单个或多个弱标签数据源与少量可靠数据集生成多源标签数据集，并利用描述每个源错误统计的转移矩阵，在训练过程中根据相关源对每个标签进行加权，实现梯度层面的权重调整。

Result: 在不同数据集上的实验验证了该方法的有效性，证明了该方法在利用不可靠标签源方面的鲁棒性和能力。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效利用不可靠标签数据源，通过考虑不同数据源的可靠性进行加权训练，显著提升了遥感图像场景分类的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Motivation: 大多数OOD检测方法将大型预训练模型视为单一编码器，仅依赖最终层表示进行检测，忽略了中间层可能包含的丰富分布偏移信号。

Method: 引入基于熵的准则来自动识别提供最互补信息的中间层，在无需OOD数据的训练自由设置下，选择性地整合这些中间层表示。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了中间层在OOD检测中的重要作用，为OOD检测研究开辟了新途径，并揭示了不同训练目标和模型架构对基于置信度的OOD检测方法的影响。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

Motivation: Steered Mixture of Experts回归框架在图像重建、压缩、去噪和超分辨率方面表现出色，但高计算成本限制了实际应用。

Method: 采用栅格化优化策略，用栅格化公式替代全局迭代优化，实现更快的参数更新和更内存高效的模型表示，同时支持原生超分辨率和图像去噪。

Result: 实现了显著加速的二维图像回归，保持了模型稀疏性和重建质量，支持更多应用场景。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和重建保真度之间提供了新的平衡，为二维图像处理任务提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

Motivation: 传统方法仅从左心室容积曲线推导舒张末期和收缩末期帧，无法深入洞察心肌运动模式，且个体心脏周期差异使自动时间比较和亚相位分析复杂化。

Method: 使用自监督深度学习，首先从图像中推导密集可变形配准场，计算一维运动描述符，然后基于特征曲线使用简单规则集确定关键帧。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现独立于周期或相位长度的心脏动态时间对齐分析，为患者间和患者内比较提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED

volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and

*Ruyang Liu,Shangkun Sun,Haoran Tang,Ge Li,Wei Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Flow4Agent是一个新颖的框架，首次将光流运动先验融入LLM长视频理解，通过时间粒度优化和运动令牌剪枝来减少长视频的时空冗余。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解面临时空内容冗余和MLLM上下文长度有限的挑战，现有方法主要依赖CLIP模型的语义先验提取关键信息。

Method: 包含两个核心模块：TGO利用粗粒度光流先验分组相似视觉内容，再用语义先验过滤无关场景；MTP使用细粒度光流信息剪枝高冗余视频令牌。

Result: 在多个视频MLLM基准测试中表现优异，特别是在小时级视频理解任务上：Video-MME 64.7%、MLVU 71.4%、LongVideoBench 60.4%。

Conclusion: Flow4Agent通过引入运动先验有效解决了长视频理解中的冗余问题，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal
characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical
for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to
bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

Motivation: 昆虫分类对农业管理和生态研究至关重要，但由于昆虫特征复杂、类别不平衡和大规模数据集等问题，该任务仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出BioAutoML-NAS模型，使用图像和元数据等多模态数据，应用神经架构搜索自动学习每个细胞内的最佳操作，通过多模态融合模块结合图像嵌入和元数据，采用交替双层优化训练策略。

Result: 在BIOSCAN-5M数据集上获得96.81%准确率、97.46%精确率、96.81%召回率和97.05% F1分数；在Insects-1M数据集上获得93.25%准确率、93.71%精确率、92.74%召回率和93.22% F1分数。

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS提供了准确、可靠的昆虫分类，支持现代可持续农业，显著优于现有的迁移学习、transformer、AutoML和NAS方法。

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出D3QE方法，利用自回归生成图像中离散分布差异和量化误差进行伪造图像检测，在7种主流视觉AR模型上表现出优越的检测精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归(AR)模型的出现带来了图像生成革命，但也为伪造图像检测带来新挑战。AR模型通过离散token预测生成图像，与之前的GAN或扩散方法不同，在图像合成质量和向量量化表示方面具有独特特征。

Method: 提出离散分布差异感知量化误差(D3QE)方法，利用真实和伪造图像中存在的码本频率分布偏差和独特模式。引入离散分布差异感知transformer，将动态码本频率统计集成到注意力机制中，融合语义特征和量化误差潜在表示。

Result: 构建了ARForensics数据集，涵盖7种主流视觉AR模型。实验表明D3QE在不同AR模型上具有优越的检测精度和强泛化能力，对现实世界扰动具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: D3QE方法有效解决了自回归生成图像的检测问题，通过利用离散分布差异和量化误差特征，在多种AR模型上实现了高性能的伪造图像检测。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

*Jiesi Hu,Yanwu Yang,Zhiyu Ye,Jinyan Zhou,Jianfeng Cao,Hanyang Peng,Ting Ma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出WS-ICL（弱监督上下文学习）方法，使用弱提示（如边界框或点）替代密集标签，显著减少医学图像分割的标注成本，同时保持与常规ICL模型相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用医学图像分割模型（交互式和上下文学习模型）虽然泛化能力强，但需要大量标注。交互式模型需要为每张图像重复用户提示，而ICL依赖密集的像素级标签，标注成本高。

Method: 提出WS-ICL范式，利用弱提示（边界框或点）作为上下文，替代密集标签，无需为所有图像重复用户提示或精细掩码。

Result: 在三个基准测试上验证，WS-ICL在显著降低标注成本的同时，性能与常规ICL模型相当，在交互范式下也极具竞争力。

Conclusion: WS-ICL是实现更高效、统一医学图像分割通用模型的有希望方向。

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

Motivation: 现有工业异常检测数据集主要关注制造场景，物体姿态受控且类别有限，而零售物流场景面临物体姿态和外观多样性的新挑战，现有方法在此类场景下表现不佳。

Method: 构建了一个大规模数据集，包含超过23万张图像和29,000个缺陷实例，涵盖48,000多个不同物体，并对多种最先进的异常检测方法进行了广泛评估。

Result: 现有最先进的异常检测方法在该数据集上表现不佳，AUROC得分不超过56.96%，远低于在制造场景数据集上的表现（可达99.9%）。

Conclusion: 该数据集为零售物流异常检测设立了新的基准，展示了现有方法在物体姿态和外观变化剧烈场景下的局限性，鼓励未来研究解决这一挑战性问题。

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次对医学影像中的token mixer进行了全面研究，在MetaFormer架构下系统分析了池化、卷积和注意力三种token mixer在图像分类和语义分割任务中的表现，覆盖8个医学影像数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MetaFormer架构通过用简单token mixer替换自注意力机制，为视觉任务提供了强大基线，但在医学影像领域应用稀少，且缺乏不同token mixer的对比研究，可能忽视了更适合的设计选择。

Method: 在MetaFormer架构中系统分析池化、卷积和注意力三种token mixer，评估图像分类和语义分割任务，涵盖8个医学影像数据集，并研究从自然图像预训练权重迁移到新token mixer的效果。

Result: 对于分类任务，低复杂度token mixer（如分组卷积或池化）已足够；预训练权重尽管存在领域差异但仍有效。对于分割任务，卷积token mixer的局部归纳偏置至关重要，分组卷积成为首选，能减少运行时间和参数数量。

Conclusion: 医学影像中，分类任务适合使用低复杂度token mixer，分割任务需要卷积token mixer的局部归纳偏置，分组卷积是最佳选择，MetaFormer的通道MLP已提供必要的跨通道交互。

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

Motivation: 传统形态成分分析(MCA)使用预定义的不相干字典，但无法适应视频内容动态变化的特点。需要开发能够根据场景内容变化自适应调整表示的方法。

Method: 扩展MCA算法，引入动态模态分解特征值聚类技术，获得数据驱动的MCA字典。通过eigenspace聚类构建自适应字典，实现动态形态成分分析。

Result: 在Adobe 240fps数据集上的去噪应用显示DMCA有效；能够增强微弱目标与海况叠加的信噪比；在逆合成孔径雷达图像中成功分离自行车与风杂波。

Conclusion: DMCA通过数据驱动的方式构建自适应字典，能够有效处理视频和图像中不同形态成分的分离问题，在多种应用场景中表现出色。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Result: 在多个最先进的水印方案（包括StegaStamp、TrustMark和VINE）上评估，攻击后水印恢复率接近零，同时再生图像保持高视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 当前鲁棒水印技术在面对基于生成模型的攻击时存在根本性漏洞，在生成AI时代需要新的水印策略。

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

Method: 使用474张奥地利2022-2024年冰雹事件的众包图像，比较四种模型，采用单阶段和两阶段提示策略，后者利用图像中参考物体（如人手）提供尺寸线索。

Result: 预训练模型无需微调即可从图像中测量冰雹直径，最佳模型平均绝对误差为1.12cm，两阶段提示提高了大多数模型的可靠性。

Conclusion: 现成模型能够从社交媒体图像中提取有意义且空间密集的信息，补充传统冰雹传感器，但自动化实时图像采集仍是待解决的问题。

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

Result: 结合两种方法可将人员重识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能，但发现这些缓解措施存在关键漏洞，如可能通过部分人物图像绕过防护。

Conclusion: 研究结果凸显了AI治理与数据保护交叉领域的紧迫监管问题：如何分类和监管具有涌现识别能力的系统？以及应要求哪些技术标准来防止看似良性应用中出现识别能力？

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

TL;DR: VideoMiner通过迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构，结合T-GRPO强化学习方法精确定位关键帧，解决了长视频理解中冗余信息干扰和复杂层次结构适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频理解中面临两个关键挑战：1) 如何减轻大量冗余信息的干扰；2) 如何动态适应复杂层次结构并准确识别关键帧。

Method: 提出VideoMiner系统，迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频形成层次树结构，从长视频到事件再到帧保持时间连贯性。引入T-GRPO（树基组相对策略优化）强化学习方法，专门为树结构设计，整合事件级的时空信息并在问题指导下探索。

Conclusion: VideoMiner通过层次树结构和T-GRPO强化学习方法有效解决了长视频理解中的关键挑战，在准确性和效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人脸建模方法依赖3D可变形模型，限制了表示能力；基于优化的方法质量高但计算昂贵。需要一种既能保持高质量又能提高效率的方法。

Method: 扩展学习顶点下降(LVD)方法，集成逐顶点神经场优化与动态预测3D关键点的全局结构指导，通过相对空间编码迭代优化网格顶点，无需密集3D监督。

Result: 在单视图设置下达到最先进性能，在多视图场景中保持高度竞争力，同时显著减少推理时间。

Conclusion: GLVD实现了表达性强且适应性好的几何重建，同时保持了计算效率，在3D人脸重建任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,
which inherently constrain the representation capacity to fixed shape priors.
Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference
time.

TL;DR: 将医学领域专用视觉语言模型MedFlamingo与PPO结合，在腹腔镜手术任务中显著提升了性能，相比标准视觉PPO和OpenFlamingo PPO基线，任务成功率超过70%，收敛速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于视觉的PPO在机器人腹腔镜手术任务中面临挑战，包括视觉输入的高维性、手术环境中奖励稀疏性以及从原始视觉数据中提取任务相关特征的困难。

Method: 将MedFlamingo医学领域专用视觉语言模型与PPO集成，每个episode处理一次任务观察和指令以生成高级规划令牌，有效结合医学专业知识与实时视觉反馈。

Result: 在LapGym的五个不同腹腔镜手术任务环境中，MedFlamingo PPO表现优于基线方法，任务成功率超过70%，相比基线改进幅度从66.67%到1114.29%不等。

Conclusion: 研究结果突显了专业知识在机器人手术规划和决策中的价值，证明了医学领域专用模型在手术任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAPTCHA已成为评估视觉语言模型空间推理能力的基准，但现有商业模型在解决这类高难度空间推理任务时表现不佳，需要研究推理能力的重要性。

Method: 提出CAPTCHA-X基准，涵盖7类CAPTCHA，包含逐步动作解决方案和基础标注；定义5个推理导向指标；提出基于代理的视觉语言模型框架，利用模型固有推理能力。

Result: 方法在5种高难度CAPTCHA类型上达到最先进性能，平均解决准确率达83.9%，显著超越现有基线（约21.9%）。

Conclusion: 当前模型存在局限性，推理能力对于推进视觉空间挑战至关重要，逐步推理能显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合注意力图和统计过滤的方法，为Vision Transformers生成更忠实和可解释的解释，通过消除噪声模式产生更清晰的解释图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型Transformer模型的兴起，可解释AI变得越来越重要，但许多为CNN设计的解释方法在Vision Transformers上效果不佳。现有的ViT解释方法依赖注意力权重，但会产生噪声图，因为它们捕获了每层内的token间交互。

Method: 提出将注意力图与统计过滤相结合的方法，去除噪声或无信息模式，生成更忠实的解释。还扩展了类特定变体以产生区分性解释。

Result: 评估表明，该方法相比流行的最先进方法产生更清晰和可解释的图。除了基于扰动的忠实度指标外，还结合人类注视数据评估与人类感知的一致性。在多个数据集上，该方法始终优于或与SOTA方法相当，同时保持高效和人类可理解性。

Conclusion: 注意力在适当过滤后仍然是宝贵且可解释的信号，该方法为Vision Transformers提供了更忠实和人类可理解的可解释AI解决方案。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了CoT在视频推理中的局限性，提出了视觉证据奖励(VER)框架来提升视频推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT机制在文本任务中表现良好，但在视频理解中往往导致性能下降，产生误导性内部独白和幻觉视觉细节，作者称之为"视觉思维漂移"现象。

Method: 引入视觉证据奖励(VER)强化学习框架，明确奖励生成可验证基于视觉证据的推理轨迹。

Result: 在10个不同的视频理解基准测试中，Video-VER始终达到最佳性能。

Conclusion: 揭示了视频中心推理的独特挑战，鼓励开发能够将推理牢固建立在视觉证据上的AI模型。

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Motivation: 尽管有TotalSegmentator等先进分割框架，但左心耳、冠状动脉和肺静脉的准确分割在医学影像中仍是重大挑战，需要高质量数据集来推动相关研究。

Method: 使用专门为高分辨率左心耳分割开发的最先进分割框架，在带有医学专家手动标注的大型私有数据集上训练网络，然后迁移到ImageCAS数据；冠状动脉标签从原始标注改进，肺静脉分割从TS输出精炼。

Conclusion: 该开源数据集为左心耳形态分析等研究提供了高质量的基础数据，填补了相关领域的数据空白。

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

Motivation: 现有基于张量的高光谱图像融合方法只能有效利用一个或两个级别的先验，同时整合多级先验会增加模型复杂度，带来权重平衡和多块结构优化的挑战。

Method: 使用块项分解将潜在高空间-光谱分辨率图像分解为光谱子空间和空间映射；将空间映射堆叠为空间张量，通过非凸模式混洗张量相关总变分共同建模高阶空间低秩性和平滑性先验；基于线性化交替方向乘子法设计高效优化算法。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验证明了所提出算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的模型能够紧凑地表征高光谱图像的多级先验，并通过理论证明在温和条件下具有KKT收敛性。

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
The code implementation will be available from https://github.com/WongYinJ.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床使用的生存分析模型难以解释，降低了其在临床环境中的实用性。传统原型学习方法关注局部相似性和静态匹配，忽视了更广泛的肿瘤背景，并且缺乏与基因组数据的强语义对齐。

Method: 1) 融合关键图像块与全局背景的稳健表型表示，与基因组数据协调以减少局部偏差；2) 指数原型更新策略(EMA ProtoUp)，维持稳定的跨模态关联并采用游走机制灵活适应肿瘤异质性；3) 分层原型匹配方案，捕获全局中心性、局部典型性和队列级趋势。

Conclusion: FeatProto为关键医疗应用中的原型学习提供了新的视角，显著提升了癌症生存预测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/FeatProto.

Motivation: 医学影像深度学习常受限于稀缺且不平衡的标注数据，需要有效的数据增强方法来缓解标注瓶颈并提高模型鲁棒性。

Method: SSGNet通过StyleGAN3生成图像来扩展训练数据，并结合迭代半监督伪标签来精炼标签，作为现有基线的增强方法而非独立模型。

Conclusion: SSGNet是缓解医学图像分析中标注瓶颈、提高鲁棒性的实用策略。

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced
annotated data. We present SSGNet, a unified framework that combines class
specific generative modeling with iterative semisupervised pseudo labeling to
enhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a
standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data
with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo
labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.
These results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation
bottlenecks and improve robustness in medical image analysis.

Conclusion: MeDiM支持连贯且临床基础的多模态输出，展示了跨模态医学生成的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

Motivation: 传统RVOS方法采用'定位-分割'级联设计，存在信息瓶颈（将语义简化为粗略几何提示）和时间一致性不足的问题。

Method: 将RVOS重构为条件连续流问题，利用预训练T2V模型的优势，学习从视频整体表示到目标掩码的语言引导直接变形。

Conclusion: 将视频理解任务建模为连续变形过程具有显著潜力，FlowRVS的单阶段生成方法克服了传统级联设计的根本限制。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

Abstract: We tackle the problem of forecasting bimanual 3D hand motion & articulation
from a single image in everyday settings. To address the lack of 3D hand
annotations in diverse settings, we design an annotation pipeline consisting of
a diffusion model to lift 2D hand keypoint sequences to 4D hand motion. For the
forecasting model, we adopt a diffusion loss to account for the multimodality
in hand motion distribution. Extensive experiments across 6 datasets show the
benefits of training on diverse data with imputed labels (14% improvement) and
effectiveness of our lifting (42% better) & forecasting (16.4% gain) models,
over the best baselines, especially in zero-shot generalization to everyday

Motivation: 视频条件的4D形状生成旨在直接从输入视频恢复随时间变化的3D几何和视角一致的外观，但现有方法存在鲁棒性和时间一致性问题。

Method: 基于大规模预训练3D模型，引入三个关键组件：时间注意力机制、时间感知点采样和4D潜在锚定、跨帧噪声共享，实现端到端的动态3D表示生成。

Result: 该方法能够准确捕捉非刚性运动、体积变化甚至拓扑转换，无需逐帧优化，在多样真实视频中提高了鲁棒性和感知保真度，减少了失败模式。

Conclusion: 提出的原生视频到4D形状生成框架通过创新的时间一致性机制，成功实现了从视频直接生成高质量动态3D表示的目标。

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

Method: 模拟物理成像过程：首先生成全焦图像，估计单目深度，使用新型焦点距离变换器预测焦点距离，然后通过可微分镜头模糊模型形成散焦图像

Result: 实验结果表明该模型能够在不改变场景内容的情况下实现优越的精细控制

Conclusion: 该方法在推理时实现了对散焦效果的精确交互控制，这是现有扩散模型无法达到的

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

TL;DR: DropD-SLAM是一个实时单目SLAM系统，无需深度传感器即可达到RGB-D级别的精度，通过三个预训练视觉模块替代主动深度输入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在开发无需依赖深度传感器的SLAM系统，利用现代预训练视觉模型提供度量尺度信息，实现更简单、成本更低的SLAM解决方案。

Method: 使用三个预训练模块：单目度量深度估计器、学习关键点检测器和实例分割网络；通过扩张实例掩码抑制动态对象，将静态关键点赋予预测深度值并反投影到3D空间，形成度量尺度特征；使用未修改的RGB-D SLAM后端进行跟踪和建图。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D基准测试中，静态序列平均ATE为7.4厘米，动态序列为1.8厘米，达到或超过最先进的RGB-D方法，在单GPU上以22 FPS运行。

Conclusion: 现代预训练视觉模型可以替代主动深度传感器作为可靠、实时的度量尺度来源，标志着向更简单、成本更低的SLAM系统迈出了一步。

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

TL;DR: 提出了EgoNight，首个夜间自我中心视觉基准，核心任务是视觉问答(VQA)，包含昼夜对齐视频以揭示光照条件间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我中心视觉基准主要关注白天场景，忽略了现实应用中不可避免的低光照条件，需要研究这一空白。

Method: 收集Blender渲染的合成视频和真实世界录制视频，确保场景和动作在视觉和时间上对齐，构建EgoNight-VQA数据集，采用日增强夜自动标注引擎和人工验证。

Result: EgoNight-VQA包含90个视频的3658个QA对，涵盖12种QA类型，评估显示最先进的多模态大语言模型从白天到夜晚的性能显著下降。

Conclusion: EgoNight-VQA为推进应用驱动的自我中心视觉研究提供了坚实基础，有助于开发跨光照域泛化的模型。

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖多阶段流程、迭代优化和繁重预处理（如人体检测、深度估计、SLAM）的问题，实现更高效的一体化重建。

Method: 基于CUT3R模型，采用参数高效的视觉提示调优，在保持丰富时空先验的同时直接输出多个SMPL-X身体，无需迭代优化。

Result: 在BEDLAM数据集上训练一天后，实现实时重建（15 FPS），内存占用低（8 GB），在多个任务上达到最先进或竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Human3R作为一个简单而强大的基线模型，易于扩展到下游应用，为4D人体场景重建提供了高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in

Motivation: LIF神经元虽然计算效率高但表达能力有限，而QIF等复杂模型具有更丰富的非线性动力学特性但训练不稳定，需要开发稳定高效的QIF神经元实现

Method: 提出QIF神经元的离散化方法，从离散化参数集推导代理梯度窗口的解析公式以减少梯度不匹配，确保训练稳定性

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS数据集上评估，性能优于最先进的LIF方法

Conclusion: QIF神经元离散化为深度SNN提供了比LIF神经元更丰富的动力学特性和实际可扩展性的有吸引力的替代方案

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对抗训练中广泛使用的MSE正则化在优化过程中强制两个输出分布过于均匀，限制了对抗训练的鲁棒性。

Method: 1. 加权对抗互正则化：构建分解的对抗互KL散度损失，允许通过为主目标和辅助目标分配不等权重来灵活控制优化过程；2. 对抗泛化正则化：在对抗训练目标中引入额外的干净目标分布。

Result: 大量实验表明，所提出的方法相比现有的基于正则化的方法显著提高了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 通过重新审视互学习思想并设计专门针对对抗训练的正则化策略，可以有效提升模型的对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

TL;DR: NEO是一种超参数免费、计算成本低的测试时自适应方法，通过重新中心化目标数据嵌入来改善源域与分布偏移样本的对齐，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法通常计算昂贵、需要大量数据或对超参数敏感，因此需要一种更高效、稳健的TTA方法。

Method: 基于潜在空间几何理论，通过将目标数据嵌入重新中心化到原点来改善源域与分布偏移样本的对齐，无需额外计算成本。

Result: 在ImageNet-C上，仅用64个样本就能将ViT-Base准确率从55.6%提升到59.2%；在多个数据集上超越7种对比方法，计算成本最低；在边缘设备上减少63%推理时间和9%内存使用。

Conclusion: NEO是一种高效有效的测试时自适应方法，适用于多种ViT架构和数据集，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive,
require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

Result: 在多个不同场景的数据集上进行对比评估，证明了该模型相比最先进方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: NGLGE模型通过自适应图学习和模式挖掘，能够有效揭示数据内在相关性，在不同场景下表现出色。

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Result: 在五个临床数据集上超越现有压缩方法，产生能够支持有效临床模型开发的压缩数据集。

Conclusion: 贝塞尔模式连接作为SGD路径的有效替代，稳定梯度、加速收敛、消除密集轨迹存储需求，在临床数据压缩中表现优异。

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

Motivation: 虽然解码器专用模型在自然语言处理中表现出色且扩展性好，但大多数跨模态适应方法都专注于编码器专用模型，因此需要研究模型架构对跨模态适应方法的影响。

Method: 进行了一系列消融研究，系统比较编码器专用和解码器专用模型在基于偏微分方程的时间相关模拟任务中的跨模态适应表现，并提出了两种新方法：并行翻转和序列加倍，试图在自回归模型中模拟双向性。

Result: 发现当现有方法未经修改时，解码器专用模型的表现远不如编码器专用模型，且扩展解码器专用模型也无济于事。提出的两种新方法在所有任务和所有跨模态适应方法中都能提升解码器专用模型的整体性能，缩小了与编码器专用模型性能的差距。

Conclusion: 研究结果有助于拓宽用于跨模态适应任务的模型范围，进一步推动科学机器学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

Conclusion: JEPA架构天然具备密度估计能力，为数据分析和模型解释提供了新的工具，且计算效率高、适用范围广。

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able
to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two
objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a
slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

TL;DR: ARLAS框架使用对抗性强化学习来增强LLM代理的安全性，通过训练攻击者生成多样化的提示注入，同时训练代理防御这些攻击，从而提高代理的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御方法依赖手动构建的攻击数据集，多样性有限，难以应对新型提示注入攻击。需要一种能自动生成多样化攻击的方法来增强代理安全性。

Method: 采用对抗性强化学习框架，将问题建模为双人零和博弈。同时训练两个LLM：攻击者学习自主生成多样化提示注入，代理学习在完成任务的同时防御攻击。使用基于种群的学习框架防止循环学习。

Result: 在BrowserGym和AgentDojo上的评估显示，ARLAS微调的代理攻击成功率显著降低，同时任务成功率提高。对抗过程生成了多样化且具有挑战性的攻击集。

Conclusion: ARLAS框架能有效增强LLM代理的安全性，通过对抗训练生成多样化攻击，使代理在面对新型提示注入时更加鲁棒。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了自适应混合位激活量化(AMAQ)方法，通过渐进式压缩激活和梯度来减少大语言模型分布式训练的通信开销，在相同比特预算下比固定精度方法表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型规模快速增长，给分布式训练带来通信效率和计算开销的挑战，需要在低资源设备上实现高效协作训练。

Method: 采用参数高效分割学习，引入AMAQ策略，基于特征和层重要性通过比特正则化在通道间分配比特预算，将激活和梯度从高精度(6-8位)渐进压缩到低精度(3-4位)。

Result: 在相同比特预算下，AMAQ比固定精度方法在LLaMA3 8B和Qwen2.5 7B模型上生成准确率提高约2.5%，分类准确率提高约1.3%，显著提升训练稳定性并减少超低位表示崩溃。

Conclusion: AMAQ能有效集成到实际多机协作训练中，在训练期间仅需适度通信开销就能提供优越的推理准确率，是通信成本最小化的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

*Zichong Li,Liming Liu,Chen Liang,Weizhu Chen,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NorMuon是一种结合正交化和神经元级自适应学习率的优化器，通过神经元级归一化解决Muon优化器中神经元更新不均衡问题，在保持Muon条件数优势的同时实现更平衡的参数利用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器通过正交化参数更新改善了优化几何，但导致神经元更新规范高度不均匀，某些神经元主导优化过程。需要结合正交化和自适应学习率的优势。

Method: 提出NorMuon优化器，维护每个神经元的二阶动量统计，在正交化后应用行级归一化，并在FSDP2框架下开发高效的分布式实现。

Result: 在多个模型规模上，NorMuon始终优于Adam和Muon，在1.1B预训练设置中比Adam提高21.74%训练效率，比Muon提高11.31%，同时保持与Muon相当的内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交化和自适应学习率是互补而非竞争的方法，为大尺度深度学习中的优化器设计开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种学习型调度器来替代掩码扩散模型中的启发式调度策略，通过将去噪过程建模为KL正则化的马尔可夫决策过程，优化了掩码位置的生成顺序选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散模型在语言建模中性能高度依赖于选择哪个位置进行去掩码的顺序，传统基于规则的调度方法（如最大置信度、最大边界）效果有限且缺乏理论保证。

Method: 将去噪过程建模为KL正则化的马尔可夫决策过程，使用显式参考策略，优化具有策略改进和收敛保证的正则化目标函数。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，学习型策略始终优于最大置信度方法，在SUDOKU任务上相比随机策略提升20.1%，相比最大置信度策略提升11.2%。

Conclusion: 学习型调度器能够生成更接近数据分布的样本，在掩码扩散模型中显著优于传统启发式调度方法。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

TL;DR: 提出了Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF)方法，通过Entropic Annealing和Look-ahead Modulation技术解决粒子滤波在推理时缩放中的粒子贫化问题，显著提升数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统粒子滤波方法在引导推理过程中容易受到过程奖励模型的过度自信评分影响，导致过早利用局部最优解、剪枝潜在正确假设，最终收敛到次优解，特别是在计算预算受限时问题更加严重。

Method: ePF整合了两种新技术：1) Entropic Annealing通过监控搜索多样性，在多样性下降时动态退火重采样分布来保持探索；2) Look-ahead Modulation添加预测性指导，基于后继状态评估状态的潜力。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的数学基准测试中，ePF显著优于强基线方法，任务奖励相对提升了高达50%。

Conclusion: ePF通过平衡多样化解空间的探索和高奖励区域的利用，提高了粒子滤波的鲁棒性，最终获得更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的二次计算复杂度限制了可扩展性，而现有线性注意力混合方法在评估时存在缺陷，线性组件被无意绕过，导致性能归因失真。

Method: 提出三种方法：(1)推理时混合线性转换与滑动窗口softmax；(2)HedgeCATs结合注意力权重转移与定向LoRA微调；(3)调度滑动窗口dropout(SSD)在训练中随机抑制softmax分支。

Result: 方法在保持计算效率的同时恢复了大部分基础模型性能，确保真正的线性注意力采用，恢复了性能归因的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案成功解决了混合线性注意力中的组件不平衡问题，为高效线性注意力模型的实际应用提供了可靠方法。

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于正确性而非置信度的解码策略，通过校准采样过程来解决LLM在复杂推理任务中探索多样性与保证准确性之间的矛盾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在LLM复杂推理中存在矛盾：一方面需要增加随机性来探索多种推理路径，另一方面又要确保每条路径的质量。传统方法将低置信度与低质量等同，但作者认为应该基于正确性而非置信度来校准解码过程。

Method: 提出了三种简单策略：Greedy-Threshold在极低置信度步骤采用贪婪采样；Calibrated-TopK和Calibrated-epsilon基于估计的按排名正确性设置截断阈值。

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中取得了性能提升，挑战了现有关于不确定性下解码的启发式方法。

Conclusion: 解码规则应该基于正确性而非置信度进行校准，在估计正确性高的token上采样，在预期正确性低的地方减少采样。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于失败感知的逆向强化学习算法，专注于从RLHF训练中被错误分类或难以判断的示例中提取潜在奖励信号，从而更准确地恢复定义模型行为的真实奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逆向强化学习方法将所有偏好对同等对待，忽略了最具信息量的信号——那些被提取的奖励模型错误分类或评分相近的示例（称为"失败"），这限制了奖励信号的可解释性和安全性。

Method: 提出失败感知的IRL算法，重点关注被错误分类或难以判断的示例，通过这些失败案例来学习更准确地反映RLHF背后真实目标的奖励函数。

Result: 在LLM去毒化任务中，失败感知IRL在多个指标上优于现有IRL基线方法，无需外部分类器或监督。提取的奖励函数能更好地捕捉RLHF期间学习的真实激励，实现比标准IRL更有效的重新RLHF训练。

Conclusion: 失败感知IRL是一种稳健、可扩展的方法，可用于审计模型对齐并减少IRL过程中的模糊性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型隐式优化的目标非常不透明，使得可信对齐和审计成为重大挑战。现有逆强化学习方法要么产生单一、过度自信的奖励估计，要么无法处理任务的根本模糊性。

Method: 采用贝叶斯逆强化学习方法，不仅恢复目标分布，还实现三个关键审计能力：量化并系统减少非可识别性、提供不确定性感知诊断、验证策略级效用。

Result: 该框架成功审计了一个去毒化LLM，产生了一个校准良好且可解释的目标，增强了对齐保证。

Conclusion: 这项工作为审计者、安全团队和监管机构提供了一个实用工具包，用于验证LLM的真正目标，推动AI向更可信和可问责的方向发展。

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

Motivation: LLM代理在解决复杂多步问题时依赖外部工具，但搜索代理的轨迹结构异质性导致标准策略梯度方法存在跨层偏差问题，扭曲了信用分配并阻碍了复杂搜索策略的探索。

Method: 提出Stratified GRPO方法，核心是分层优势归一化(SAN)，根据轨迹的结构特性将其划分为同质层，在每层内局部计算优势值，确保轨迹只与同类轨迹比较。

Result: 在多样化的单跳和多跳问答基准测试中，Stratified GRPO比GRPO性能提升高达11.3分，实现了更高的训练奖励、更好的训练稳定性和更有效的搜索策略。

Conclusion: 分层方法为LLM搜索代理中的结构异质性提供了原则性解决方案，证明了分层优势归一化能够有效消除跨层偏差，提升强化学习效果。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

Motivation: 现有的单信号模型奖励方法存在置信度校准不足、无法捕捉人类偏好多样性、需要大量数据标注和奖励模型训练等问题。

Method: 混合奖励建模框架：结合模型奖励（从合成和人类反馈中预测分数）和规则奖励（领域特定启发式提供置信信号），并引入多维度奖励和广义长度惩罚奖励。

Result: 在3B模型家族中，通用和数学推理任务平均提升约9.5%，数学基准测试平均提升约16%。

Conclusion: 该框架为通过强化学习策略优化对齐MLLMs提供了灵活有效的方法，在多模态基准测试中表现一致改进。

Abstract: Aligning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with human preferences
often relies on single-signal, model-based reward methods. Such monolithic
rewards often lack confidence calibration across domain-specific tasks, fail to
capture diverse aspects of human preferences, and require extensive data
annotation and reward model training. In this work, we propose a hybrid reward
modeling framework that integrates complementary reward paradigms: (i)
model-based rewards, where a learned reward model predicts scalar or vector
scores from synthetic and human feedback, and (ii) rule-based rewards, where
domain-specific heuristics provide explicit correctness signals with
confidence. Beyond accuracy, we further incorporate multi-aspect rewards to
enforce instruction adherence and introduce a generalized length-penalty reward
to stabilize training and improve performance. The proposed framework provides
a flexible and effective approach to aligning MLLMs through reinforcement
learning policy optimization. Our experiments show consistent improvements
across different multimodal benchmarks when applying hybrid and multi-aspect
reward modeling. Our best performing model in the 3B family achieves an overall
average improvement of ~9.5% across general and math reasoning tasks. Focusing
specifically on mathematical benchmarks, the model achieves a significant
average improvement of ~16%, highlighting its effectiveness in mathematical
reasoning and problem solving.

TL;DR: D2E框架利用桌面游戏环境作为机器人具身AI的预训练平台，通过标准化桌面交互数据、通用事件预测模型和迁移学习方法，成功将桌面预训练知识转移到物理机器人任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具身AI因物理轨迹采集成本高昂而受限的问题，利用桌面游戏环境提供的大规模丰富传感器运动交互数据作为替代方案。

Method: 1) OWA工具包统一桌面交互格式并实现152倍压缩；2) Generalist-IDM通过时间戳事件预测实现零样本泛化；3) VAPT将桌面预训练表示迁移到物理操作和导航任务。

Result: 使用1300+小时数据，在LIBERO操作任务上达到96.6%成功率，在CANVAS导航基准上达到83.3%成功率。

Conclusion: 数字交互中的传感器运动基元具有足够的恒定性，能够有效迁移到物理具身任务，确立了桌面预训练作为机器人学的实用范式。

Abstract: Large language models leverage internet-scale text data, yet embodied AI
remains constrained by the prohibitive costs of physical trajectory collection.
Desktop environments -- particularly gaming -- offer a compelling alternative:
they provide rich sensorimotor interactions at scale while maintaining the
structured observation-action coupling essential for embodied learning. We
present D2E (Desktop to Embodied AI), a framework that demonstrates desktop
interactions can serve as an effective pretraining substrate for robotics
embodied AI tasks. Unlike prior work that remained domain-specific (e.g., VPT
for Minecraft) or kept data proprietary (e.g., SIMA), D2E establishes a
complete pipeline from scalable desktop data collection to verified transfer in
embodied domains. Our framework comprises three components: (1) the OWA Toolkit
that unifies diverse desktop interactions into a standardized format with 152x
compression, (2) the Generalist-IDM that achieves strong zero-shot
generalization across unseen games through timestamp-based event prediction,
enabling internet-scale pseudo-labeling, and (3) VAPT that transfers
desktop-pretrained representations to physical manipulation and navigation.
Using 1.3K+ hours of data (259 hours of human demonstrations, and 1K+ hours of
pseudo-labeled gameplay), we achieve a total of 96.6% success rate on LIBERO
manipulation and 83.3% on CANVAS navigation benchmarks. This validates that
sensorimotor primitives in digital interactions exhibit sufficient invariance
to transfer meaningfully to physical embodied tasks, establishing desktop
pretraining as a practical paradigm for robotics. We will make all our work
public, including the OWA toolkit, datasets of human-collected and
pseudo-labeled, and VAPT-trained models available at

TL;DR: SAC-Opt是一个基于语义锚点的后向引导修正框架，通过将原始语义锚点与生成代码重构的锚点对齐，选择性修正不匹配组件，提高LLM生成优化模型的语义准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成优化模型的方法主要依赖求解器驱动，存在语义错误未被检测的问题，导致生成语法正确但逻辑有缺陷的模型。需要一种基于问题语义而非求解器反馈的修正方法。

Method: 提出SAC-Opt框架，通过语义锚点对齐和选择性修正机制，在每一步将原始语义锚点与代码重构锚点对齐，仅修正不匹配组件，实现细粒度的约束和目标逻辑优化。

Result: 在7个公共数据集上的实验表明，SAC-Opt将平均建模准确率提高了7.8%，在ComplexLP数据集上最高提升21.9%。

Conclusion: 语义锚点修正在LLM驱动的优化工作流中至关重要，能够确保从问题意图到求解器可执行代码的忠实转换。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have opened new paradigms in optimization
modeling by enabling the generation of executable solver code from natural
language descriptions. Despite this promise, existing approaches typically
remain solver-driven: they rely on single-pass forward generation and apply
limited post-hoc fixes based on solver error messages, leaving undetected
semantic errors that silently produce syntactically correct but logically
flawed models. To address this challenge, we propose SAC-Opt, a backward-guided
correction framework that grounds optimization modeling in problem semantics
rather than solver feedback. At each step, SAC-Opt aligns the original semantic
anchors with those reconstructed from the generated code and selectively
corrects only the mismatched components, driving convergence toward a
semantically faithful model. This anchor-driven correction enables fine-grained
refinement of constraint and objective logic, enhancing both fidelity and
robustness without requiring additional training or supervision. Empirical
results on seven public datasets demonstrate that SAC-Opt improves average
modeling accuracy by 7.8\%, with gains of up to 21.9\% on the ComplexLP
dataset. These findings highlight the importance of semantic-anchored
correction in LLM-based optimization workflows to ensure faithful translation
from problem intent to solver-executable code.

TL;DR: 本文对自动驾驶和机器人领域的World Models进行了文献综述和实证分析，特别关注场景和控制生成任务的安全影响，识别了常见故障类型并提供了定量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着具身人工智能的快速发展，需要更先进的集成模型来感知、解释和预测环境动态。World Models为具身智能体提供了预测未来环境状态和填补知识空白的能力，但需要确保预测对智能体和环境都是安全的。

Method: 采用文献综述方法分析自动驾驶和机器人领域的World Models，结合实证分析收集和检查最先进模型的预测结果，识别和分类常见故障（病理），并提供定量评估。

Result: 通过实证分析识别了World Models在场景和控制生成任务中的常见故障类型，并对结果进行了定量评估，揭示了这些模型在安全方面存在的潜在问题。

Conclusion: World Models在提升具身智能体规划能力方面具有重要作用，但在实际应用中需要特别关注其预测的安全性，以确保对智能体和环境都不会造成危害。

Abstract: The rapid progress in embodied artificial intelligence has highlighted the
necessity for more advanced and integrated models that can perceive, interpret,
and predict environmental dynamics. In this context, World Models (WMs) have
been introduced to provide embodied agents with the abilities to anticipate
future environmental states and fill in knowledge gaps, thereby enhancing
agents' ability to plan and execute actions. However, when dealing with
embodied agents it is fundamental to ensure that predictions are safe for both
the agent and the environment. In this article, we conduct a comprehensive
literature review of World Models in the domains of autonomous driving and
robotics, with a specific focus on the safety implications of scene and control
generation tasks. Our review is complemented by an empirical analysis, wherein
we collect and examine predictions from state-of-the-art models, identify and
categorize common faults (herein referred to as pathologies), and provide a
quantitative evaluation of the results.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究发现先进LLM在编程任务中表现出类似人类的邓宁-克鲁格效应，能力较低的模型和在稀有编程语言中工作的模型更容易过度自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在创意和技术领域与人类合作增多，需要了解认知边界和偏见如何影响共享智能。

Method: 通过分析模型在不同编程语言中的置信度和表现，评估模型能力与自信度的关系。

Result: 实验显示能力较弱的模型和在稀有编程语言中工作的模型表现出更强的DKE偏见，偏见强度与模型能力成反比。

Conclusion: AI模型确实会表现出类似人类的认知偏见，特别是在不熟悉或资源匮乏的领域中。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems increasingly collaborate with humans in
creative and technical domains, questions arise about the cognitive boundaries
and biases that shape our shared agency. This paper investigates the
Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE), the tendency for those with limited competence to
overestimate their abilities in state-of-the-art LLMs in coding tasks. By
analyzing model confidence and performance across a diverse set of programming
languages, we reveal that AI models mirror human patterns of overconfidence,
especially in unfamiliar or low-resource domains. Our experiments demonstrate
that less competent models and those operating in rare programming languages
exhibit stronger DKE-like bias, suggesting that the strength of the bias is
proportionate to the competence of the models.

*Aman Gupta,Denny O'Shea,Fazl Barez*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VAL-Bench是一个评估大语言模型价值对齐的基准测试，通过对比模型在争议性话题正反两面提示下的回答一致性来衡量价值稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注拒绝回答或安全违规检测，但无法评估模型在面对现实争议问题时是否保持连贯的价值体系。

Method: 使用维基百科争议章节构建11.5万对正反提示，通过LLM作为评判者来评估模型回答的一致性。

Result: 测试发现不同模型在价值对齐方面存在显著差异，安全策略（如拒绝回答）与表达性价值系统之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: VAL-Bench提供了一个可扩展、可复现的基准，能够系统比较LLMs体现人类价值观的可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for tasks where outputs
shape human decisions, so it is critical to test whether their responses
reflect consistent human values. Existing benchmarks mostly track refusals or
predefined safety violations, but these only check rule compliance and do not
reveal whether a model upholds a coherent value system when facing
controversial real-world issues. We introduce the \textbf{V}alue
\textbf{AL}ignment \textbf{Bench}mark (\textbf{VAL-Bench}), which evaluates
whether models maintain a stable value stance across paired prompts that frame
opposing sides of public debates. VAL-Bench consists of 115K such pairs from
Wikipedia's controversial sections. A well-aligned model should express similar
underlying views regardless of framing, which we measure using an LLM-as-judge
to score agreement or divergence between paired responses. Applied across
leading open- and closed-source models, the benchmark reveals large variation
in alignment and highlights trade-offs between safety strategies (e.g.,
refusals) and more expressive value systems. By providing a scalable,
reproducible benchmark, VAL-Bench enables systematic comparison of how reliably
LLMs embody human values.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AgentFlow是一个可训练的在线智能体框架，通过四个模块（规划器、执行器、验证器、生成器）和演进记忆来协调工作，使用Flow-GRPO算法在多轮交互中直接优化规划器，显著提升了长视野、稀疏奖励任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具增强方法训练单一策略，在长视野和多样化工具场景下扩展性差，泛化能力弱；智能体系统虽然通过模块分解工作，但大多不训练或离线训练，无法适应多轮交互的动态特性。

Method: 提出AgentFlow框架，包含四个协调模块和演进记忆，使用Flow-GRPO算法将多轮优化转化为可处理的单轮策略更新，通过广播轨迹级结果对齐局部决策与全局成功。

Result: 在十个基准测试中，7B规模的AgentFlow在搜索任务上平均提升14.9%，智能体任务14.0%，数学任务14.5%，科学任务4.1%，甚至超越GPT-4o等更大专有模型。

Conclusion: 在线优化带来显著优势，包括改进的规划能力、增强的工具调用可靠性，以及随模型规模和推理轮数增加的正向扩展性。

Abstract: Outcome-driven reinforcement learning has advanced reasoning in large
language models (LLMs), but prevailing tool-augmented approaches train a
single, monolithic policy that interleaves thoughts and tool calls under full
context; this scales poorly with long horizons and diverse tools and
generalizes weakly to new scenarios. Agentic systems offer a promising
alternative by decomposing work across specialized modules, yet most remain
training-free or rely on offline training decoupled from the live dynamics of
multi-turn interaction. We introduce AgentFlow, a trainable, in-the-flow
agentic framework that coordinates four modules (planner, executor, verifier,
generator) through an evolving memory and directly optimizes its planner inside
the multi-turn loop. To train on-policy in live environments, we propose
Flow-based Group Refined Policy Optimization (Flow-GRPO), which tackles
long-horizon, sparse-reward credit assignment by converting multi-turn
optimization into a sequence of tractable single-turn policy updates. It
broadcasts a single, verifiable trajectory-level outcome to every turn to align
local planner decisions with global success and stabilizes learning with
group-normalized advantages. Across ten benchmarks, AgentFlow with a 7B-scale
backbone outperforms top-performing baselines with average accuracy gains of
14.9% on search, 14.0% on agentic, 14.5% on mathematical, and 4.1% on
scientific tasks, even surpassing larger proprietary models like GPT-4o.
Further analyses confirm the benefits of in-the-flow optimization, showing
improved planning, enhanced tool-calling reliability, and positive scaling with
model size and reasoning turns.

*Bohan Yao,Shiva Krishna Reddy Malay,Vikas Yadav*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的自动多智能体系统设计范式ARM，通过优化思维链推理来提升性能，相比现有方法具有更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动多智能体系统设计方法性能不佳，需要为每个新任务重新发现架构，且依赖昂贵的标注数据。研究发现简单思维链推理与复杂系统性能相当，表明需要深入研究推理单元。

Method: 提出ARM模块，将思维链泛化为由专门推理模块执行的细粒度推理步骤。通过代码空间的树搜索发现模块，从简单思维链开始，利用执行轨迹反思进行突变演化。

Result: ARM方法显著优于手动设计的多智能体系统和最先进的自动设计方法，在不同基础模型和任务领域都保持高性能，无需进一步优化。

Conclusion: ARM作为通用的推理构建块，可以递归使用或作为元编排器的子程序，在多智能体系统设计中展现出卓越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-powered Multi-agent systems (MAS) have achieved
state-of-the-art results on various complex reasoning tasks. Recent works have
proposed techniques to automate the design of MASes, eliminating the need for
manual engineering. However, these techniques perform poorly, often achieving
similar or inferior performance to simple baselines. Furthermore, they require
computationally expensive re-discovery of architectures for each new task
domain and expensive data annotation on domains without existing labeled
validation sets. A critical insight is that simple Chain of Thought (CoT)
reasoning often performs competitively with these complex systems, suggesting
that the fundamental reasoning unit of MASes, CoT, warrants further
investigation. To this end, we present a new paradigm for automatic MAS design
that pivots the focus to optimizing CoT reasoning. We introduce the Agentic
Reasoning Module (ARM), an agentic generalization of CoT where each granular
reasoning step is executed by a specialized reasoning module. This module is
discovered through a tree search over the code space, starting from a simple
CoT module and evolved using mutations informed by reflection on execution
traces. The resulting ARM acts as a versatile reasoning building block which
can be utilized as a direct recursive loop or as a subroutine in a learned
meta-orchestrator. Our approach significantly outperforms both manually
designed MASes and state-of-the-art automatic MAS design methods. Crucially,
MASes built with ARM exhibit superb generalization, maintaining high
performance across different foundation models and task domains without further
optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于混合参与度分数的早期迷因病毒性预测方法，使用多语言Reddit数据集，在30分钟内就能达到PR-AUC > 0.52的预测效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线内容病毒性预测具有挑战性，特别是对于文化复杂、快速演变的迷因。研究旨在探索早期预测迷因病毒性的可行性，在完整传播级联数据不可用的情况下建立稳健的预测基准。

Method: 使用来自25个多样化Reddit社区的大规模跨语言数据集，提出基于混合参与度分数的数据驱动方法定义病毒性。评估了逻辑回归、XGBoost和MLP等模型，采用包含静态内容和时间动态的综合多模态特征集，在30-420分钟的时间窗口内进行预测。

Result: XGBoost表现最佳，在仅30分钟内就达到PR-AUC > 0.52。分析揭示了"证据转换"现象：随着迷因获得关注，特征重要性从静态上下文动态转向时间动态。

Conclusion: 该研究为早期病毒性预测建立了稳健、可解释且实用的基准，贡献了新颖的跨语言数据集和方法论上合理的病毒性定义，首次将时间序列数据与静态内容和网络特征相结合来预测早期迷因病毒性。

Abstract: Predicting the virality of online content remains challenging, especially for
culturally complex, fast-evolving memes. This study investigates the
feasibility of early prediction of meme virality using a large-scale,
cross-lingual dataset from 25 diverse Reddit communities. We propose a robust,
data-driven method to define virality based on a hybrid engagement score,
learning a percentile-based threshold from a chronologically held-out training
set to prevent data leakage. We evaluated a suite of models, including Logistic
Regression, XGBoost, and a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), with a comprehensive,
multimodal feature set across increasing time windows (30-420 min). Crucially,
useful signals emerge quickly: our best-performing model, XGBoost, achieves a
PR-AUC $>$ 0.52 in just 30 minutes. Our analysis reveals a clear "evidentiary
transition," in which the importance of the feature dynamically shifts from the
static context to the temporal dynamics as a meme gains traction. This work
establishes a robust, interpretable, and practical benchmark for early virality
prediction in scenarios where full diffusion cascade data is unavailable,
contributing a novel cross-lingual dataset and a methodologically sound
definition of virality. To our knowledge, this study is the first to combine
time series data with static content and network features to predict early meme
virality.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MatheMagic方法，通过改变数字和运算符的解释生成动态数学测试基准，用于检测模型过拟合并衡量真实推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数学基准存在两个问题：模型会记忆公开测试集；当前数学基准由于符号和规则多样性有限且答案封闭，容易导致过拟合。

Method: 使用MatheMagic生成数学测试实例，改变数字和运算符的解释但保持答案可自动验证，在测试时随机构建实例来评估模型的归纳或演绎能力。

Result: 实验发现模型更容易解决演绎问题而非归纳问题，但会回归到标准数学；数学适应模型未能展现通用的推理"技能"，归纳任务的微调泛化效果差。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了稳定、可扩展、可比较且对过拟合鲁棒的评估框架，揭示了当前模型在数学推理能力上的局限性。

Abstract: Conducting contamination-free evaluation of mathematical capabilities can be
difficult for two reasons: models may memorize a test set once it is made
public, and current mathematical benchmarks are prone to overfitting due to
having limited diversity of symbols and rules, coupled with closed-ended
answers. This paper proposes a method to leverage these shortcomings as useful
features to a construct dynamic, counterfactual benchmark, which can be used to
both reveal overfitting and measure true reasoning. We demonstrate this via
MatheMagic, which generates math test instances with the interpretations of
numbers and operators altered, yet has automatically verifiable answers. Test
instances are randomly seeded and constructed at test time to evaluate a
model's induction or deduction capability, offering stability, extensibility,
comparability, and robustness to overfitting. Our experiments find that models
solve deduction more easily than induction, but they revert to standard math.
Further analysis reveals that math-adapted models fail to exhibit a general
"skill" of reasoning, and fine-tuning on induction tasks generalizes poorly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决标准检索增强生成在法律领域的核心限制，特别是如何可靠查询结构化知识而不牺牲其确定性属性。

Method: 引入基于规范动作的查询执行层，这些动作是原子化、可组合和可审计的原语，支持规划器引导的代理将复杂查询分解为有向无环图。

Result: 实现了高精度混合搜索、鲁棒的引用解析、时间点版本检索和可审计的因果追踪。

Conclusion: 两层架构将检索从不透明的黑盒转变为透明可审计的过程，直接满足高风险领域可解释AI的需求。

Abstract: The Structure-Aware Temporal Graph RAG (SAT-Graph RAG) addresses core
limitations of standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation in the legal domain by
providing a verifiable knowledge graph that models hierarchical structure,
temporal evolution, and causal events of legal norms. However, a critical gap
remains: how to reliably query this structured knowledge without sacrificing
its deterministic properties. This paper introduces the SAT-Graph API, a formal
query execution layer centered on canonical actions-atomic, composable, and
auditable primitives that isolate probabilistic discovery from deterministic
retrieval. These actions enable: (i) high-precision hybrid search; (ii) robust
reference resolution; (iii) point-in-time version retrieval; and (iv) auditable
causal tracing. We demonstrate how planner-guided agents can decompose complex
queries into Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) of these actions. This two-layer
architecture transforms retrieval from an opaque black box to a transparent,
auditable process, directly addressing Explainable AI (XAI) requirements for
high-stakes domains.

TL;DR: MixReasoning框架通过动态调整推理深度，在困难步骤进行详细推理，在简单步骤进行简洁推理，从而缩短推理长度并提高效率而不影响准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理模型对所有步骤采用相同的详细推理方式，但实际子问题难度差异很大，导致大量冗余计算。只有少数关键步骤真正需要深入推理。

Method: 提出MixReasoning框架，在单个响应中动态调整推理深度，形成混合推理链：对困难步骤进行详细推理，对简单步骤进行简洁推理。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH-500和AIME数据集上的实验表明，MixReasoning显著缩短了推理长度，大幅提高了效率，同时保持了准确性。

Conclusion: MixReasoning通过自适应调整推理深度，有效解决了推理冗余问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Reasoning models enhance performance by tackling problems in a step-by-step
manner, decomposing them into sub-problems and exploring long chains of thought
before producing an answer. However, applying extended reasoning to every step
introduces substantial redundancy, as sub-problems vary widely in difficulty
and complexity: a small number of pivotal steps are genuinely challenging and
decisive for the final answer, while many others only involve straightforward
revisions or simple computations. Therefore, a natural idea is to endow
reasoning models with the ability to adaptively respond to this variation,
rather than treating all steps with the same level of elaboration. To this end,
we propose MixReasoning, a framework that dynamically adjusts the depth of
reasoning within a single response. The resulting chain of thought then becomes
a mixture of detailed reasoning on difficult steps and concise inference on
simpler ones. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME show that MixReasoning
shortens reasoning length and substantially improves efficiency without
compromising accuracy.

TL;DR: TaTToo是一个针对表格推理的PRM框架，通过显式推理表格操作步骤和集成工具验证来提升大型推理模型在表格推理任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM在处理表格特定操作（如子表检索和模式交互）时存在困难，导致性能瓶颈，需要专门针对表格推理的监督方法。

Method: 设计可扩展的数据标注流程构建6万+步骤级注释，采用双阶段训练：冷启动监督微调学习工具使用模式，然后通过强化学习和工具基础奖励塑形进行对齐。

Result: 在5个具有挑战性的表格推理基准测试中，TaTToo将下游策略LRM在推理时性能提升30.9%，仅用8B参数就超越了72B参数的强基线模型。

Conclusion: TaTToo证明了针对表格推理专门设计的PRM框架的有效性，在多种TTS策略下都展现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large reasoning models (LRMs),
particularly in the context of test-time scaling (TTS). However, their
potential for supervising LRMs on tabular reasoning domains remains
underexplored. Through detailed empirical analyses, we identify that existing
PRMs, though widely adopted for supervising text-only reasoning steps, struggle
with table-specific operations such as sub-table retrieval and schema
interaction, leading to critical performance bottlenecks. To address this
limitation, we propose TaTToo, a novel table-grounded PRM framework that (i)
reasons explicitly over tabular reasoning steps and (ii) integrates tool-based
verification to provide precise reward supervision. Concretely, we first design
a scalable data curation pipeline that constructs over 60k high-quality
step-level annotations by integrating table verification rationales with
tool-based executions. Building on the collected data, we train TaTToo with a
dual-stage paradigm: cold-start supervised fine-tuning to capture tool-use
reasoning patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with tool-grounded
reward shaping to align our model with table-based verification. We provide a
comprehensive evaluation of the policy improvement induced by our newly
designed PRM. Across 5 challenging tabular reasoning benchmarks covering
numerical reasoning, fact-checking, and data analysis, TaTToo improves
downstream policy LRMs by 30.9% at inference, surpasses strong PRM baselines
such as Qwen-2.5-Math-PRM-72B with only 8B parameters, and demonstrates strong
generalizability across diverse TTS strategies.

Motivation: 现有语音深度伪造检测方法基于完整微调大型预训练模型，参数效率低且对真实场景数据的泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出了融合提示调优和信号处理变换的参数高效前端，包括傅里叶变换和两种小波变换变体，以及结合部分WSPT-XLSR前端和双向Mamba后端的WaveSP-Net架构。

Result: WaveSP-Net在Deepfake-Eval-2024和SpoofCeleb两个新基准测试中优于多个最先进模型，参数量低且性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 该方法通过多分辨率特征注入提示嵌入，有效定位细微合成伪影，同时保持冻结的XLSR参数不变，实现了参数效率和性能的平衡。

Abstract: Modern front-end design for speech deepfake detection relies on full
fine-tuning of large pre-trained models like XLSR. However, this approach is
not parameter-efficient and may lead to suboptimal generalization to realistic,
in-the-wild data types. To address these limitations, we introduce a new family
of parameter-efficient front-ends that fuse prompt-tuning with classical signal
processing transforms. These include FourierPT-XLSR, which uses the Fourier
Transform, and two variants based on the Wavelet Transform: WSPT-XLSR and
Partial-WSPT-XLSR. We further propose WaveSP-Net, a novel architecture
combining a Partial-WSPT-XLSR front-end and a bidirectional Mamba-based
back-end. This design injects multi-resolution features into the prompt
embeddings, which enhances the localization of subtle synthetic artifacts
without altering the frozen XLSR parameters. Experimental results demonstrate
that WaveSP-Net outperforms several state-of-the-art models on two new and
challenging benchmarks, Deepfake-Eval-2024 and SpoofCeleb, with low trainable
parameters and notable performance gains. The code and models are available at

Method: 提出TokenChain：1）语义标记ASR与两阶段TTS耦合；2）自回归文本到语义模型与ASR共同训练；3）掩码生成语义到声学模型仅用于合成；4）通过straight-through argmax/Gumbel-Softmax实现端到端反馈；5）通过动态权重平均与监督ASR平衡。

Result: 在LibriSpeech上，TokenChain比基线提前2-6个epoch达到更高准确率，同等epoch下错误率降低5-13%，T2S稳定；在TED-LIUM上，ASR相对WER降低56%，T2S WER降低31%，且遗忘最小。

Conclusion: 链式学习在标记接口和模型下仍然有效，TokenChain证明了离散语音链在ASR和TTS联合优化中的优越性能。

Abstract: Machine Speech Chain, simulating the human perception-production loop, proves
effective in jointly improving ASR and TTS. We propose TokenChain, a fully
discrete speech chain coupling semantic-token ASR with a two-stage TTS: an
autoregressive text-to-semantic model co-trained with ASR and a
masked-generative semantic-to-acoustic model for synthesis only. End-to-end
feedback across the text interface is enabled with straight-through
argmax/Gumbel-Softmax and balanced with supervised ASR via dynamic weight
averaging. Ablations examine optimal temperature schedules for in- and
cross-domain transfer. Evaluation reveals TokenChain surpasses baseline
accuracy 2-6 epochs earlier and yields 5-13% lower equal-epoch error with
stable T2S on LibriSpeech, and reduces relative ASR WER by 56% and T2S WER by
31% on TED-LIUM with minimal forgetting, showing that chain learning remains
effective with token interfaces and models.

*Christian Marinoni,Riccardo Fosco Gramaccioni,Kazuki Shimada,Takashi Shibuya,Yuki Mitsufuji,Danilo Comminiello*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: StereoSync是一个新颖高效的视频对齐音频生成模型，能够生成与参考视频时间同步且空间对齐的音频，通过利用预训练基础模型实现高效高质量合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前音频生成研究广泛，但视频对齐音频生成仍相对未被探索，现有方法主要关注时间同步而缺乏空间感知能力。

Method: 使用扩散模型，从深度图和边界框提取空间线索作为交叉注意力条件，实现时空对齐的立体音频生成。

Result: 在Walking The Maps数据集上的实验表明，StereoSync能够实现时间和空间对齐，显著提升了视频到音频生成的技术水平。

Conclusion: StereoSync通过引入空间感知能力，超越了简单的时间同步，为视频对齐音频生成提供了更沉浸和真实的音频体验。

Abstract: Although audio generation has been widely studied over recent years,
video-aligned audio generation still remains a relatively unexplored frontier.
To address this gap, we introduce StereoSync, a novel and efficient model
designed to generate audio that is both temporally synchronized with a
reference video and spatially aligned with its visual context. Moreover,
StereoSync also achieves efficiency by leveraging pretrained foundation models,
reducing the need for extensive training while maintaining high-quality
synthesis. Unlike existing methods that primarily focus on temporal
synchronization, StereoSync introduces a significant advancement by
incorporating spatial awareness into video-aligned audio generation. Indeed,
given an input video, our approach extracts spatial cues from depth maps and
bounding boxes, using them as cross-attention conditioning in a diffusion-based
audio generation model. Such an approach allows StereoSync to go beyond simple
synchronization, producing stereo audio that dynamically adapts to the spatial
structure and movement of a video scene. We evaluate StereoSync on Walking The
Maps, a curated dataset comprising videos from video games that feature
animated characters walking through diverse environments. Experimental results
demonstrate the ability of StereoSync to achieve both temporal and spatial
alignment, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio generation and
resulting in a significantly more immersive and realistic audio experience.

TL;DR: FoleyGRAM是一种基于语义条件的视频到音频生成方法，通过多模态编码器对齐实现精确的语义控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频到音频生成方法缺乏精确的语义控制能力，需要改进多模态表示的对齐来提升生成音频与视频内容的语义一致性。

Method: 使用Gramian表示对齐度量(GRAM)对齐视频、文本和音频模态的嵌入表示，结合基于扩散的音频合成模型，并以GRAM对齐嵌入和波形包络作为条件。

Result: 在Greatest Hits数据集上的实验表明，使用GRAM对齐多模态编码器能够显著提升生成音频与视频内容的语义对齐能力。

Conclusion: FoleyGRAM通过多模态编码器对齐技术，在视频到音频合成领域取得了最先进的性能，证明了语义条件控制的重要性。

Abstract: In this work, we present FoleyGRAM, a novel approach to video-to-audio
generation that emphasizes semantic conditioning through the use of aligned
multimodal encoders. Building on prior advancements in video-to-audio
generation, FoleyGRAM leverages the Gramian Representation Alignment Measure
(GRAM) to align embeddings across video, text, and audio modalities, enabling
precise semantic control over the audio generation process. The core of
FoleyGRAM is a diffusion-based audio synthesis model conditioned on
GRAM-aligned embeddings and waveform envelopes, ensuring both semantic richness
and temporal alignment with the corresponding input video. We evaluate
FoleyGRAM on the Greatest Hits dataset, a standard benchmark for video-to-audio
models. Our experiments demonstrate that aligning multimodal encoders using
GRAM enhances the system's ability to semantically align generated audio with
video content, advancing the state of the art in video-to-audio synthesis.

TL;DR: Sci-Phi是一个空间音频大语言模型，通过双空间和频谱编码器估计所有声源和环境的完整参数集，能够完整描述空间音频场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统音频语言模型在声音识别方面表现出色，但单通道输入从根本上限制了空间理解能力，需要开发能够全面理解空间音频场景的模型。

Method: 使用双空间和频谱编码器，从超过4000小时的一阶Ambisonics合成录音中学习，能够一次性枚举和描述最多四个定向声源，以及非定向背景声音和房间特性。

Result: 模型在15个指标上进行了评估，涵盖内容、位置、时序、响度和混响，并在不同声源数量、信噪比、混响水平和挑战性混合场景下表现出鲁棒性，能够泛化到真实房间脉冲响应。

Conclusion: 这是首个能够完整描述空间场景的音频大语言模型，具有强大的实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Acoustic scene perception involves describing the type of sounds, their
timing, their direction and distance, as well as their loudness and
reverberation. While audio language models excel in sound recognition,
single-channel input fundamentally limits spatial understanding. This work
presents Sci-Phi, a spatial audio large language model with dual spatial and
spectral encoders that estimates a complete parameter set for all sound sources
and the surrounding environment. Learning from over 4,000 hours of synthetic
first-order Ambisonics recordings including metadata, Sci-Phi enumerates and
describes up to four directional sound sources in one pass, alongside
non-directional background sounds and room characteristics. We evaluate the
model with a permutation-invariant protocol and 15 metrics covering content,
location, timing, loudness, and reverberation, and analyze its robustness
across source counts, signal-to-noise ratios, reverberation levels, and
challenging mixtures of acoustically, spatially, or temporally similar sources.
Notably, Sci-Phi generalizes to real room impulse responses with only minor
performance degradation. Overall, this work establishes the first audio LLM
capable of full spatial-scene description, with strong potential for real-world
deployment. Demo: https://sci-phi-audio.github.io/demo

TL;DR: 提出了TUNA用户需求与行动分类法，这是一个基于1193个人机对话实证研究的三层层次框架，用于系统描述用户在对话AI中的行为模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话行为分类法要么过于笼统，要么局限于特定领域，无法全面捕捉用户在实际对话中的适应性、社会性和情境性实践。

Method: 通过1193个人机对话的迭代定性分析，结合理论回顾和跨情境验证，开发出经验基础的用户行为分类框架。

Result: TUNA将用户行为组织为三层层次结构，涵盖信息寻求、综合、程序指导、内容创建、社交互动和元对话等六大类行为。

Conclusion: TUNA为描述AI使用提供了系统词汇，支持多尺度评估和跨产品政策协调，有助于设计更安全、响应性更强和更负责任的对话系统。

Abstract: The growing ubiquity of conversational AI highlights the need for frameworks
that capture not only users' instrumental goals but also the situated,
adaptive, and social practices through which they achieve them. Existing
taxonomies of conversational behavior either overgeneralize, remain
domain-specific, or reduce interactions to narrow dialogue functions. To
address this gap, we introduce the Taxonomy of User Needs and Actions (TUNA),
an empirically grounded framework developed through iterative qualitative
analysis of 1193 human-AI conversations, supplemented by theoretical review and
validation across diverse contexts. TUNA organizes user actions into a
three-level hierarchy encompassing behaviors associated with information
seeking, synthesis, procedural guidance, content creation, social interaction,
and meta-conversation. By centering user agency and appropriation practices,
TUNA enables multi-scale evaluation, supports policy harmonization across
products, and provides a backbone for layering domain-specific taxonomies. This
work contributes a systematic vocabulary for describing AI use, advancing both
scholarly understanding and practical design of safer, more responsive, and
more accountable conversational systems.

Abstract: The rapid development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has
catalyzed a transformative technological revolution across all walks of life.
As the backbone of wideband communication, optical networks are expecting
high-level autonomous operation and zero-touch management to accommodate their
expanding network scales and escalating transmission bandwidth. The integration
of GenAI is deemed as the pivotal solution for realizing zero-touch optical
networks. However, the lifecycle management of optical networks involves a
multitude of tasks and necessitates seamless collaboration across multiple
layers, which poses significant challenges to the existing single-agent GenAI
systems. In this paper, we propose a GenAI-driven hierarchical multi-agent
framework designed to streamline multi-task autonomous execution for zero-touch
optical networks. We present the architecture, implementation, and applications
of this framework. A field-deployed mesh network is utilized to demonstrate
three typical scenarios throughout the lifecycle of optical network: quality of
transmission estimation in the planning stage, dynamic channel adding/dropping
in the operation stage, and system capacity increase in the upgrade stage. The
case studies, illustrate the capabilities of multi-agent framework in
multi-task allocation, coordination, execution, evaluation, and summarization.
This work provides a promising approach for the future development of
intelligent, efficient, and collaborative network management solutions, paving
the way for more specialized and adaptive zero-touch optical networks.

TL;DR: OASIS是一个新的分割回归框架，通过加权损失函数在训练中优先处理物体重叠区域，能够从严重遮挡的物体中提取像素强度和拓扑特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决科学成像中重叠物体分离的挑战，特别是在重叠区域归因最模糊的情况下，现有深度学习方法通常平等对待所有区域而非优先处理重叠区域。

Method: 提出OASIS分割回归框架，采用加权损失函数在训练过程中优先处理物体重叠区域，专注于从严重遮挡的物体中提取像素强度和拓扑特征。

Result: 相比未加权训练，OASIS将低能电子轨迹（4-5 keV）的中位强度重建误差从-32%改善到-14%，拓扑交并比得分从0.828提升到0.855。

Conclusion: OASIS能够有效恢复重叠主导区域中被遮挡的信号，为科学成像提供了一种通用方法，其中像素代表物理量且重叠会遮挡感兴趣的特征。

Abstract: The separation of overlapping objects presents a significant challenge in
scientific imaging. While deep learning segmentation-regression algorithms can
predict pixel-wise intensities, they typically treat all regions equally rather
than prioritizing overlap regions where attribution is most ambiguous. Recent
advances in instance segmentation show that weighting regions of pixel overlap
in training can improve segmentation boundary predictions in regions of
overlap, but this idea has not yet been extended to segmentation regression. We
address this with Overlap-Aware Segmentation of ImageS (OASIS): a new
segmentation-regression framework with a weighted loss function designed to
prioritize regions of object-overlap during training, enabling extraction of
pixel intensities and topological features from heavily obscured objects. We
demonstrate OASIS in the context of the MIGDAL experiment, which aims to
directly image the Migdal effect--a rare process where electron emission is
induced by nuclear scattering--in a low-pressure optical time projection
chamber. This setting poses an extreme test case, as the target for
reconstruction is a faint electron recoil track which is often heavily-buried
within the orders-of-magnitude brighter nuclear recoil track. Compared to
unweighted training, OASIS improves median intensity reconstruction errors from
-32% to -14% for low-energy electron tracks (4-5 keV) and improves topological
intersection-over-union scores from 0.828 to 0.855. These performance gains
demonstrate OASIS's ability to recover obscured signals in overlap-dominated
regions. The framework provides a generalizable methodology for scientific
imaging where pixels represent physical quantities and overlap obscures
features of interest. All code is openly available to facilitate cross-domain
adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医学图像分割方法需要大量标注数据，而nnsam2旨在解决少样本分割问题，仅需每个数据集一个标注切片即可实现高性能分割，提高标注效率。

Method: 使用单个切片的SAM2提示生成伪标签，通过三个连续的独立nnU-Net模型进行伪标签池化和精炼，在6个数据集（1,219个扫描，19,439个切片）上进行验证。

Result: nnsam2在MR图像上DSC达到0.94-0.96，CT图像上达到0.92-0.93，优于其他方法。自动测量与专家测量在肌肉体积、CT衰减值和脂肪比率上统计等效，ICC达到0.86-1.00。

Conclusion: nnsam2是多模态LPM分割的最先进少样本框架，具有高标注效率、强泛化能力和可重复性，已开源代码和数据。

Abstract: Purpose: To develop and validate No-New SAM2 (nnsam2) for few-shot
segmentation of lumbar paraspinal muscles using only a single annotated slice
per dataset, and to assess its statistical comparability with expert
measurements across multi-sequence MRI and multi-protocol CT.
  Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 1,219 scans (19,439 slices) from 762
participants across six datasets. Six slices (one per dataset) served as
labeled examples, while the remaining 19,433 slices were used for testing. In
this minimal-supervision setting, nnsam2 used single-slice SAM2 prompts to
generate pseudo-labels, which were pooled across datasets and refined through
three sequential, independent nnU-Net models. Segmentation performance was
evaluated using the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), and automated
measurements-including muscle volume, fat ratio, and CT attenuation-were
assessed with two one-sided tests (TOST) and intraclass correlation
coefficients (ICC).
  Results: nnsam2 outperformed vanilla SAM2, its medical variants,
TotalSegmentator, and the leading few-shot method, achieving DSCs of 0.94-0.96
on MR images and 0.92-0.93 on CT. Automated and expert measurements were
statistically equivalent for muscle volume (MRI/CT), CT attenuation, and Dixon
fat ratio (TOST, P < 0.05), with consistently high ICCs (0.86-1.00).
  Conclusion: We developed nnsam2, a state-of-the-art few-shot framework for
multi-modality LPM segmentation, producing muscle volume (MRI/CT), attenuation
(CT), and fat ratio (Dixon MRI) measurements that were statistically comparable
to expert references. Validated across multimodal, multicenter, and
multinational cohorts, and released with open code and data, nnsam2
demonstrated high annotation efficiency, robust generalizability, and
reproducibility.

Motivation: 解决智能手机可见光谱虹膜识别面临的挑战，包括光照变化、色素差异和缺乏标准化采集控制。

Method: 开发了定制Android应用进行实时取帧和清晰度评估，构建CUVIRIS数据集，设计了轻量级MobileNetV3多任务分割网络LightIrisNet和适配可见光谱的transformer匹配器IrisFormer。

Result: OSIRIS在FAR=0.01时TAR达到97.9%(EER=0.76%)，IrisFormer在CUVIRIS上EER为0.057%。

Conclusion: 标准化采集和可见光谱适配的轻量模型能够在智能手机上实现准确实用的虹膜识别。

Abstract: Smartphone-based iris recognition in the visible spectrum (VIS) remains
difficult due to illumination variability, pigmentation differences, and the
absence of standardized capture controls. This work presents a compact
end-to-end pipeline that enforces ISO/IEC 29794-6 quality compliance at
acquisition and demonstrates that accurate VIS iris recognition is feasible on
commodity devices. Using a custom Android application performing real-time
framing, sharpness evaluation, and feedback, we introduce the CUVIRIS dataset
of 752 compliant images from 47 subjects. A lightweight MobileNetV3-based
multi-task segmentation network (LightIrisNet) is developed for efficient
on-device processing, and a transformer matcher (IrisFormer) is adapted to the
VIS domain. Under a standardized protocol and comparative benchmarking against
prior CNN baselines, OSIRIS attains a TAR of 97.9% at FAR=0.01 (EER=0.76%),
while IrisFormer, trained only on UBIRIS.v2, achieves an EER of 0.057% on
CUVIRIS. The acquisition app, trained models, and a public subset of the
dataset are released to support reproducibility. These results confirm that
standardized capture and VIS-adapted lightweight models enable accurate and
practical iris recognition on smartphones.

TL;DR: SafeGuider是一个针对文本到图像模型的安全防护框架，通过分析[EOS]令牌的语义聚合特性，结合嵌入级识别模型和安全感知特征擦除波束搜索算法，在保持良性提示生成质量的同时有效防御对抗性攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型容易受到对抗性提示攻击，绕过安全措施生成有害内容。现有防御策略在保持实用性和鲁棒性方面存在挑战，需要一种既能防御攻击又不影响正常生成质量的解决方案。

Method: 首先对Stable Diffusion模型的文本编码器进行实证研究，发现[EOS]令牌在良性提示和对抗性提示的嵌入空间中具有不同的分布模式。基于此构建SafeGuider框架，包含嵌入级识别模型和安全感知特征擦除波束搜索算法。

Result: SafeGuider在各种攻击场景下的最大攻击成功率仅为5.48%，能有效防御领域内和领域外攻击。对于不安全提示，不会拒绝生成或产生黑图，而是生成安全有意义的图像，增强了实用性。该框架还可应用于其他文本到图像模型如Flux。

Conclusion: SafeGuider为安全文本到图像系统的实际部署提供了有效解决方案，在保持生成质量的同时实现了鲁棒的安全控制，具有很好的通用性和适应性。

Abstract: Text-to-image models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality images from natural language descriptions. However, these models
are highly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which can bypass safety measures
and produce harmful content. Despite various defensive strategies, achieving
robustness against attacks while maintaining practical utility in real-world
applications remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we first
conduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD)
model, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our
findings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting
distinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its
embedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{SafeGuider}, a
two-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising
generation quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model
with a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration
enables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign
prompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain
attacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack
success rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\% across various attack
scenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images
for unsafe prompts, \textbf{SafeGuider} generates safe and meaningful images,
enhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the
SD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as
the Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across different
architectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical
deployment of secure text-to-image systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM脆弱性评估方法不可靠，存在不公平的模型比较、启发式输入和无法捕捉不确定性的度量标准等问题。

Method: 提出端到端评估框架：1) 针对训练和部署两种场景的公平实验设计；2) 贝叶斯层次模型结合嵌入空间聚类，改进不确定性量化。

Result: 模型在多个提示注入攻击场景中显示出改进的推断能力，考虑输出变异性可得出更谨慎的结论，但某些攻击下Transformer和Mamba架构确实存在显著脆弱性。

Conclusion: 该框架为LLM脆弱性评估提供了更可靠的方法，揭示了架构选择对安全性的重要影响，特别是在相同训练数据或数学能力条件下。

Abstract: Before adopting a new large language model (LLM) architecture, it is critical
to understand vulnerabilities accurately. Existing evaluations can be difficult
to trust, often drawing conclusions from LLMs that are not meaningfully
comparable, relying on heuristic inputs or employing metrics that fail to
capture the inherent uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a principled and
practical end-to-end framework for evaluating LLM vulnerabilities to prompt
injection attacks. First, we propose practical approaches to experimental
design, tackling unfair LLM comparisons by considering two practitioner
scenarios: when training an LLM and when deploying a pre-trained LLM. Second,
we address the analysis of experiments and propose a Bayesian hierarchical
model with embedding-space clustering. This model is designed to improve
uncertainty quantification in the common scenario that LLM outputs are not
deterministic, test prompts are designed imperfectly, and practitioners only
have a limited amount of compute to evaluate vulnerabilities. We show the
improved inferential capabilities of the model in several prompt injection
attack settings. Finally, we demonstrate the pipeline to evaluate the security
of Transformer versus Mamba architectures. Our findings show that consideration
of output variability can suggest less definitive findings. However, for some
attacks, we find notably increased Transformer and Mamba-variant
vulnerabilities across LLMs with the same training data or mathematical
ability.

Conclusion: DeLTa框架成功解决了透明物体长时程精确操作的挑战，展示了出色的泛化能力和操作精度。

Abstract: Despite the prevalence of transparent object interactions in human everyday
life, transparent robotic manipulation research remains limited to
short-horizon tasks and basic grasping capabilities.Although some methods have
partially addressed these issues, most of them have limitations in
generalizability to novel objects and are insufficient for precise long-horizon
robot manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose DeLTa (Demonstration
and Language-Guided Novel Transparent Object Manipulation), a novel framework
that integrates depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language
planning for precise long-horizon manipulation of transparent objects guided by
natural task instructions. A key advantage of our method is its
single-demonstration approach, which generalizes 6D trajectories to novel
transparent objects without requiring category-level priors or additional
training. Additionally, we present a task planner that refines the
VLM-generated plan to account for the constraints of a single-arm, eye-in-hand
robot for long-horizon object manipulation tasks. Through comprehensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
transparent object manipulation approaches, particularly in long-horizon
scenarios requiring precise manipulation capabilities. Project page:

to which we refer as Quantum Concept Music (QCM). This new music formalism is
based on Categorical Quantum Mechanics (CQM), and more specifically, its
diagrammatic incarnation Quantum Picturalism (QPict), which is heavily based on
ZX-calculus. In fact, it is naturally inherited from CQM/QPict. At its heart is
the explicit notational representation of relations that exist within and
between the key concepts of music composition, performance, and automation. QCM
also enables one to directly translate quantum phenomena into music
compositions in a both intuitively obvious, rigorous and mechanical manner.
  Following this pattern, we propose a score for musicians interacting like a
Bell-pair under measurement, and outline examples of how it could be live
performed. While most of the Western classical music notation has heavily
relied on linear representation of music - which does not always adequately
capture the nature of music - our approach is distinct by highlighting the
fundamental relational dimension of music. In addition, this quantum-based
technique not only influences the music at the profound level of composition,
but also has a direct impact on a live performance, and also provides a new
template for automating music, e.g.~in the context of AI-generation.
  All together, we initiate the creation of new music formalism that is
powerful and efficient in capturing the interactive nature of music, both in
terms of internal and external interactions, and goes beyond the boundaries of
Western classical music notation, which allows to use it in many different
genres and directions.

TL;DR: NANOMIND是一个软硬件协同设计的大模型推理框架，通过将大型多模态模型分解为模块化组件并映射到合适的加速器上，实现在资源受限设备上的高效运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型通常以整体方式执行，无法充分利用现代SoC中异构加速器的优势，导致高延迟和低效率。

Method: 将大模型分解为视觉、语言、音频等模块化"砖块"，通过模块级动态卸载技术将各组件调度到最合适的计算单元，结合定制硬件设计、系统级调度和优化的低位计算内核。

Result: 系统在资源效率上优于现有实现，能耗降低42.3%，GPU内存使用减少11.2%，电池供电设备可运行LLaVA-OneVision近半天，LLaMA-3-8B语音交互达20.8小时。

Conclusion: NANOMIND框架通过模块化分解和智能调度，在资源受限设备上实现了高效的大模型推理，为边缘智能设备提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision
and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost
always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous
accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end
latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design
inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models
into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its
ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into
modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units.
It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on
unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level
scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our
framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs
entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent
assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher
throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The
design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage
through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system
outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy
consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a
battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly half a
day and LLaMA-3-8B for voice interactions up to almost 20.8 hours.

### [214] [Towards Robust and Realible Multimodal Fake News Detection with Incomplete Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05839)

TL;DR: 提出MMLNet多模态假新闻检测方法，通过多专家协作推理、不完整模态适配器和模态缺失学习来处理传播过程中的模态不完整问题，在真实数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMLNet通过确保在信息传播导致的模态不完整场景下的检测准确性，有效遏制恶意虚假信息的传播。

Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection (MFND) has become an urgent task with the
emergence of huge multimodal fake content on social media platforms. Previous
studies mainly focus on complex feature extraction and fusion to learn
discriminative information from multimodal content. However, in real-world
applications, multimedia news may naturally lose some information during
dissemination, resulting in modality incompleteness, which is detrimental to
the generalization and robustness of existing models. To this end, we propose a
novel generic and robust multimodal fusion strategy, termed Multi-expert
Modality-incomplete Learning Network (MMLNet), which is simple yet effective.
It consists of three key steps: (1) Multi-Expert Collaborative Reasoning to
compensate for missing modalities by dynamically leveraging complementary
information through multiple experts. (2) Incomplete Modality Adapters
compensates for the missing information by leveraging the new feature
distribution. (3) Modality Missing Learning leveraging an label-aware adaptive
weighting strategy to learn a robust representation with contrastive learning.
We evaluate MMLNet on three real-world benchmarks across two languages,
demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining relative simplicity. By ensuring the accuracy of fake news
detection in incomplete modality scenarios caused by information propagation,
MMLNet effectively curbs the spread of malicious misinformation. Code is
publicly available at https://github.com/zhyhome/MMLNet.

Main category: cs.MM

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个可控音频-视频生成框架，通过全景显著性图、边界框感知距离图和场景描述等控制信号，从360度环境中生成视角特定的音视频内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法缺乏从大型沉浸式360度环境中生成视角特定内容的细粒度控制，限制了创建能够感知镜头外事件的音视频体验。

Method: 提出扩散模型，引入全景显著性图识别兴趣区域、边界框感知有符号距离图定义目标视角、以及场景描述作为控制信号。

Result: 模型生成具有空间感知的视角视频和音频，这些内容与更广泛的未看见环境上下文一致，为逼真沉浸式音视频生成提供了强可控性。

Conclusion: 这是首个解决可控音视频生成未探索空白的工作，通过集成多种控制信号实现了对360度环境的细粒度音视频生成控制。

Abstract: The generation of sounding videos has seen significant advancements with the
advent of diffusion models. However, existing methods often lack the
fine-grained control needed to generate viewpoint-specific content from larger,
immersive 360-degree environments. This limitation restricts the creation of
audio-visual experiences that are aware of off-camera events. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce a framework for controllable
audio-visual generation, addressing this unexplored gap. Specifically, we
propose a diffusion model by introducing a set of powerful conditioning signals
derived from the full 360-degree space: a panoramic saliency map to identify
regions of interest, a bounding-box-aware signed distance map to define the
target viewpoint, and a descriptive caption of the entire scene. By integrating
these controls, our model generates spatially-aware viewpoint videos and audios
that are coherently influenced by the broader, unseen environmental context,
introducing a strong controllability that is essential for realistic and
immersive audio-visual generation. We show audiovisual examples proving the
effectiveness of our framework.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的温暖基迭代投影方法（WB-IPM），将学习方法和迭代方案相结合，显著提高了荧光分子层析成像的深度重建精度，同时减少了训练工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 荧光分子层析成像在深度重建中面临精度挑战，传统迭代方法z分辨率差，监督学习方法需要大量高质量配对训练数据，在实际中难以获取。需要将学习方法与迭代方案有效结合以获得更准确稳定的算法。

Method: 提出了温暖基迭代投影方法（WB-IPM），该方法结合了学习方法和迭代方案，使用仅依赖于地面真实值与神经网络输出之间方向分量的较弱损失函数。

Result: 该方法比基于学习和基于迭代的方法实现了显著更准确的重建，同时大幅减少了训练工作量。

Conclusion: WB-IPM方法在理论和实验上均证明了其有效性，能够提供更准确稳定的荧光分子层析成像重建结果。

Abstract: Fluorescence Molecular Tomography (FMT) is a widely used non-invasive optical
imaging technology in biomedical research. It usually faces significant
accuracy challenges in depth reconstruction, and conventional iterative methods
struggle with poor $z$-resolution even with advanced regularization. Supervised
learning approaches can improve recovery accuracy but rely on large,
high-quality paired training dataset that is often impractical to acquire in
practice. This naturally raises the question of how learning-based approaches
can be effectively combined with iterative schemes to yield more accurate and
stable algorithms. In this work, we present a novel warm-basis iterative
projection method (WB-IPM) and establish its theoretical underpinnings. The
method is able to achieve significantly more accurate reconstructions than the
learning-based and iterative-based methods. In addition, it allows a weaker
loss function depending solely on the directional component of the difference
between ground truth and neural network output, thereby substantially reducing
the training effort. These features are justified by our error analysis as well
as simulated and real-data experiments.

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了生物储层计算在机器学习中的可行性，为整合生物原理到人工智能系统提供了新的方向，推动了人类启发视觉计算的发展。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a biologically grounded approach to reservoir
computing (RC), in which a network of cultured biological neurons serves as the
reservoir substrate. This system, referred to as biological reservoir computing
(BRC), replaces artificial recurrent units with the spontaneous and evoked
activity of living neurons. A multi-electrode array (MEA) enables simultaneous
stimulation and readout across multiple sites: inputs are delivered through a
subset of electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting neural
responses, mapping input patterns into a high-dimensional biological feature
space. We evaluate the system through a case study on digit classification
using a custom dataset. Input images are encoded and delivered to the
biological reservoir via electrical stimulation, and the corresponding neural
activity is used to train a simple linear classifier. To contextualize the
performance of the biological system, we also include a comparison with a
standard artificial reservoir trained on the same task. The results indicate
that the biological reservoir can effectively support classification,
highlighting its potential as a viable and interpretable computational
substrate. We believe this work contributes to the broader effort of
integrating biological principles into machine learning and aligns with the
goals of human-inspired vision by exploring how living neural systems can
inform the design of efficient and biologically plausible models.

Main category: eess.SP

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的Vision Transformer架构，结合CNN和SE模块，用于从心电图图像中识别情绪状态，在YAAD和DREAMER数据集上取得了优于现有方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生物医学信号分析方法在情绪识别方面存在局限，而先进的transformer架构在图像分类中表现出色，因此探索其在心电图情绪识别中的应用潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 使用连续小波变换和功率谱密度分析将ECG信号转换为图像；2) 提出结合CNN和SE模块的增强版Vision Transformer架构。

Result: 在YAAD数据集上，该方法在七种情绪状态分类以及效价和唤醒度分类中超越了现有最优方法；在DREAMER数据集上，在效价、唤醒度和支配度分类中同样表现出色。

Conclusion: 结合CNN和SE模块的增强版Vision Transformer架构在ECG情绪识别任务中具有显著优势，为生物医学信号的情绪分析提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Biomedical signals provide insights into various conditions affecting the
human body. Beyond diagnostic capabilities, these signals offer a deeper
understanding of how specific organs respond to an individual's emotions and
feelings. For instance, ECG data can reveal changes in heart rate variability
linked to emotional arousal, stress levels, and autonomic nervous system
activity. This data offers a window into the physiological basis of our
emotional states. Recent advancements in the field diverge from conventional
approaches by leveraging the power of advanced transformer architectures, which
surpass traditional machine learning and deep learning methods. We begin by
assessing the effectiveness of the Vision Transformer (ViT), a forefront model
in image classification, for identifying emotions in imaged ECGs. Following
this, we present and evaluate an improved version of ViT, integrating both CNN
and SE blocks, aiming to bolster performance on imaged ECGs associated with
emotion detection. Our method unfolds in two critical phases: first, we apply
advanced preprocessing techniques for signal purification and converting
signals into interpretable images using continuous wavelet transform and power
spectral density analysis; second, we unveil a performance-boosted vision
transformer architecture, cleverly enhanced with convolutional neural network
components, to adeptly tackle the challenges of emotion recognition. Our
methodology's robustness and innovation were thoroughly tested using ECG data
from the YAAD and DREAMER datasets, leading to remarkable outcomes. For the
YAAD dataset, our approach outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods in
classifying seven unique emotional states, as well as in valence and arousal
classification. Similarly, in the DREAMER dataset, our method excelled in
distinguishing between valence, arousal and dominance, surpassing current
leading techniques.

Result: 在MMLU基准上的实验表明，该方法在显著分布偏移下比标准共形预测提供更可靠的覆盖，同时保持效率。

Conclusion: 为LLM在现实世界部署中提供可信的不确定性量化的实用步骤。

Abstract: Large language models have achieved impressive performance across diverse
tasks. However, their tendency to produce overconfident and factually incorrect
outputs, known as hallucinations, poses risks in real world applications.
Conformal prediction provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage
guarantees, but standard conformal prediction breaks down under domain shift,
often leading to under-coverage and unreliable prediction sets. We propose a
new framework called Domain-Shift-Aware Conformal Prediction (DS-CP). Our
framework adapts conformal prediction to large language models under domain
shift, by systematically reweighting calibration samples based on their
proximity to the test prompt, thereby preserving validity while enhancing
adaptivity. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on the MMLU benchmark
demonstrate that the proposed method delivers more reliable coverage than
standard conformal prediction, especially under substantial distribution
shifts, while maintaining efficiency. This provides a practical step toward
trustworthy uncertainty quantification for large language models in real-world
deployment.
