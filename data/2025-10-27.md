### [1] [Shoot First, Ask Questions Later? Building Rational Agents that Explore and Act Like People](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20886)
*Gabriel Grand,Valerio Pepe,Jacob Andreas,Joshua B. Tenenbaum*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文开发了基于贝叶斯实验设计的蒙特卡洛推理方法，显著提升了语言模型在战略决策对话任务中的信息寻求能力，使较弱模型在协作战舰游戏中超越人类和前沿模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多高风险AI应用需要形成数据驱动的假设并进行有针对性的猜测，但现有语言模型在理性信息寻求方面存在不足，需要开发方法来基准测试和增强代理的信息寻求能力。

Method: 引入协作战舰战略决策对话任务，开发基于贝叶斯实验设计的蒙特卡洛推理策略，包括提升观察者代理准确性和船长代理预期信息增益的方法。

Result: 观察者代理准确率提升14.7%，船长代理预期信息增益提升0.227比特（达到可实现噪声上限的94.2%），较弱模型在协作战舰游戏中胜率从8%提升至82%，在猜猜谁游戏中准确率提升28.3-42.4个百分点。

Conclusion: 基于贝叶斯实验设计的推理方法能显著提升语言模型的信息寻求理性，使较弱模型在战略决策任务中超越人类和前沿模型，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Many high-stakes applications of AI require forming data-driven hypotheses
and making targeted guesses; e.g., in scientific and diagnostic settings. Given
limited resources, to what extent do agents based on language models (LMs) act
rationally? We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic
information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we
introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative
Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration
(asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter
must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to
human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in
context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next,
to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for
LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter
agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only
baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up
to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these
components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs,
such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and
frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We
replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost
accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for
building rational information-seeking agents.

### [2] [Code-enabled language models can outperform reasoning models on diverse tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20909)
*Cedegao E. Zhang,Cédric Colas,Gabriel Poesia,Joshua B. Tenenbaum,Jacob Andreas*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CodeAdapt方法通过结合CodeAct框架和少样本引导的上下文学习，使标准指令微调语言模型在不进行额外微调的情况下，就能达到甚至超越专门训练的推理模型的性能水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理模型虽然表现出色，但需要大量计算资源和数据来训练，运行速度慢且成本高。本文旨在探索标准指令微调语言模型是否能够在不进行额外训练的情况下，达到与专门推理模型相当的推理能力。

Method: 提出CodeAdapt方法，结合CodeAct框架（让语言模型在自然语言推理中穿插代码执行）和少样本引导的上下文学习，仅需5个训练问题即可实现有效推理。

Result: 在四个匹配的语言模型-推理模型对中，CodeAdapt使三个语言模型在八个任务上平均表现优于对应的推理模型（最高提升22.9%），同时token效率提高10-81%。在六个任务上，四个模型的平均性能表现更优（最高提升35.7%）。

Conclusion: CodeAdapt风格的学习和推理具有鲁棒性和领域通用性，代码增强的语言模型是认知基础良好且强大的系统，可能为权重内强化学习提供坚实基础。

Abstract: Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement
learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably
successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to
train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that
standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level
comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs
R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and
creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt,
our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave
natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with
few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems.
Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables
three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up
to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior
performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%).
Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied
problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style
learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled
LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a
strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.

### [3] [FicSim: A Dataset for Multi-Faceted Semantic Similarity in Long-Form Fiction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20926)
*Natasha Johnson,Amanda Bertsch,Maria-Emil Deal,Emma Strubell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: FICSIM是一个用于评估语言模型在计算文学研究中应用的长篇小说相似性数据集，包含12个相似性维度的评分，重点关注作者代理和持续知情同意。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前嵌入相似性数据集不适合评估文学领域任务，因为主要关注粗粒度相似性和短文本，且存在公共领域文学数据污染问题。

Method: 收集长篇小说数据，基于作者提供的元数据构建12个相似性维度评分，并由数字人文学者验证，评估多种嵌入模型的表现。

Result: 评估显示模型倾向于关注表面特征而非对计算文学研究有用的语义类别。

Conclusion: FICSIM数据集填补了文学领域评估的空白，强调作者代理和知情同意的重要性，揭示了当前模型在文学分析中的局限性。

Abstract: As language models become capable of processing increasingly long and complex
texts, there has been growing interest in their application within
computational literary studies. However, evaluating the usefulness of these
models for such tasks remains challenging due to the cost of fine-grained
annotation for long-form texts and the data contamination concerns inherent in
using public-domain literature. Current embedding similarity datasets are not
suitable for evaluating literary-domain tasks because of a focus on
coarse-grained similarity and primarily on very short text. We assemble and
release FICSIM, a dataset of long-form, recently written fiction, including
scores along 12 axes of similarity informed by author-produced metadata and
validated by digital humanities scholars. We evaluate a suite of embedding
models on this task, demonstrating a tendency across models to focus on
surface-level features over semantic categories that would be useful for
computational literary studies tasks. Throughout our data-collection process,
we prioritize author agency and rely on continual, informed author consent.

### [4] [Do LLMs Truly Understand When a Precedent Is Overruled?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20941)
*Li Zhang,Jaromir Savelka,Kevin Ashley*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 评估大语言模型在识别美国最高法院案例中的推翻关系方面的表现，揭示了时代敏感性、浅层推理和上下文依赖的推理失败等关键局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够捕捉真实高风险任务的长上下文基准测试，因为现有评估大多依赖简化的合成任务，无法代表现实世界文档理解的复杂性。

Method: 使用236对案例数据集，评估最先进的LLMs识别美国最高法院案例中的推翻关系，这是普通法体系的基础关系。

Result: 发现三个关键局限性：1）时代敏感性 - 模型对历史案例表现较差；2）浅层推理 - 依赖浅层逻辑启发式而非深度法律理解；3）上下文依赖的推理失败 - 在复杂任务中产生时间上不可能的关系。

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了一个基准测试，解决了现实长上下文评估中的关键空白，提供了反映实际法律推理任务复杂性和重要性的环境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) with extended context windows show promise for
complex legal reasoning tasks, yet their ability to understand long legal
documents remains insufficiently evaluated. Developing long-context benchmarks
that capture realistic, high-stakes tasks remains a significant challenge in
the field, as most existing evaluations rely on simplified synthetic tasks that
fail to represent the complexity of real-world document understanding.
Overruling relationships are foundational to common-law doctrine and commonly
found in judicial opinions. They provide a focused and important testbed for
long-document legal understanding that closely resembles what legal
professionals actually do. We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on
identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a
dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations:
(1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases
compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training;
(2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than
deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures --
models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks
despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts. Our work
contributes a benchmark that addresses the critical gap in realistic
long-context evaluation, providing an environment that mirrors the complexity
and stakes of actual legal reasoning tasks.

### [5] [Irish-BLiMP: A Linguistic Benchmark for Evaluating Human and Language Model Performance in a Low-Resource Setting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20957)
*Josh McGiff,Khanh-Tung Tran,William Mulcahy,Dáibhidh Ó Luinín,Jake Dalzell,Róisín Ní Bhroin,Adam Burke,Barry O'Sullivan,Hoang D. Nguyen,Nikola S. Nikolov*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 爱尔兰-BLiMP是首个为爱尔兰语设计的细粒度语言能力评估数据集和框架，包含1020个最小对，涵盖11种语言特征。评估显示人类在所有语言特征上都优于所有模型，准确率平均高出16.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为濒危语言爱尔兰语创建首个系统性的语言能力评估框架，填补低资源语言在LLM评估方面的空白。

Method: 基于语言学文献和语法参考书，由流利的爱尔兰语使用者团队手动构建和审查1020个最小对，涵盖11种语言特征。评估现有LLM和人类参与者的句法知识。

Result: 人类准确率90.1%，显著优于所有模型。开源和闭源LLM之间存在18.1%的性能差距，最强模型GPT-5仅达到73.5%准确率。人类和模型在爱尔兰语语法的不同方面存在困难。

Conclusion: 爱尔兰-BLiMP为评估LLM在爱尔兰语中的语法能力提供了首个系统性框架，为低资源语言的语理解研究提供了有价值的基准。

Abstract: We present Irish-BLiMP (Irish Benchmark of Linguistic Minimal Pairs), the
first dataset and framework designed for fine-grained evaluation of linguistic
competence in the Irish language, an endangered language. Drawing on a variety
of linguistic literature and grammar reference works, we manually constructed
and reviewed 1020 minimal pairs across a taxonomy of 11 linguistic features,
through a team of fluent Irish speakers. We evaluate both existing Large
Language Models (LLMs) and fluent human participants on their syntactic
knowledge of Irish. Our findings show that humans outperform all models across
all linguistic features, achieving 16.6% higher accuracy on average. Moreover,
a substantial performance gap of 18.1% persists between open- and closed-source
LLMs, with even the strongest model (gpt-5) reaching only 73.5% accuracy
compared to 90.1% by human. Interestingly, human participants and models
struggle on different aspects of Irish grammar, thus highlighting a difference
in representation learned by the models. Overall, Irish-BLiMP provides the
first systematic framework for evaluating the grammatical competence of LLMs in
Irish and offers a valuable benchmark for advancing research on linguistic
understanding in low-resource languages.

### [6] [Can Confidence Estimates Decide When Chain-of-thought is Necessary for Llms?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21007)
*Samuel Lewis-Lim,Xingwei Tan,Zhixue Zhao,Nikolaos Aletras*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出置信度门控的思维链（CoT）方法，让模型仅在直接回答置信度低时才调用推理过程，以减少不必要的token使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CoT提示虽然能提升LLM在复杂任务上的推理能力，但会大幅增加token使用量，且在很多任务中并不必要甚至有害。需要一种自适应机制来决定何时使用CoT。

Method: 使用四种无需训练的置信度估计方法来控制CoT的调用，当模型对直接回答的置信度低时才启用推理过程。

Result: 实验表明现有的训练无关置信度方法能减少冗余CoT，优于随机调用CoT，但不同置信度方法的效果因数据集和模型而异，部署仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 置信度门控CoT具有潜力但当前方法可靠性有限，需要进一步研究更可靠的自适应CoT门控机制。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting has emerged as a common technique for
enhancing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). While
extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary
and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning
models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose
controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it
is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks
it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even
harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a
model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To
this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence
estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free
confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an
oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we
show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT
and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual
confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the
model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in
practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights
the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more
reliable adaptive gating of CoT.

### [7] [Input Matters: Evaluating Input Structure's Impact on LLM Summaries of Sports Play-by-Play](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21034)
*Barkavi Sundararajan,Somayajulu Sripada,Ehud Reiter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现输入数据结构对LLM生成NBA比赛摘要的事实错误率有显著影响，JSON格式相比非结构化输入能减少约65-69%的错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在体育报道等准确性要求高的领域部署LLM时，生成文本可能无法忠实反映输入数据，需要量化输入结构对幻觉和事实错误的影响。

Method: 使用三种输入格式（行结构、JSON和非结构化）测试两个LLM模型（Llama-3.1-70B和Qwen2.5-72B）生成NBA比赛摘要，人工标注了3,312个事实错误。

Result: JSON输入相比非结构化输入减少错误率：Llama 69%，Qwen 65%；行结构输入减少：Llama 54%，Qwen 51%。方差分析显示输入结构解释了80%以上的错误率方差。

Conclusion: 输入结构对LLM事实准确性有决定性影响，结构化数据格式能显著减少幻觉和事实错误。

Abstract: A major concern when deploying LLMs in accuracy-critical domains such as
sports reporting is that the generated text may not faithfully reflect the
input data. We quantify how input structure affects hallucinations and other
factual errors in LLM-generated summaries of NBA play-by-play data, across
three formats: row-structured, JSON and unstructured. We manually annotated
3,312 factual errors across 180 game summaries produced by two models,
Llama-3.1-70B and Qwen2.5-72B. Input structure has a strong effect: JSON input
reduces error rates by 69% for Llama and 65% for Qwen compared to unstructured
input, while row-structured input reduces errors by 54% for Llama and 51% for
Qwen. A two-way repeated measures ANOVA shows that input structure accounts for
over 80% of the variance in error rates, with Tukey HSD post hoc tests
confirming statistically significant differences between all input formats.

### [8] [Reasoning's Razor: Reasoning Improves Accuracy but Can Hurt Recall at Critical Operating Points in Safety and Hallucination Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21049)
*Atoosa Chegini,Hamid Kazemi,Garrett Souza,Maria Safi,Yang Song,Samy Bengio,Sinead Williamson,Mehrdad Farajtabar*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统分析了在低误报率要求下的推理增强分类任务表现，发现推理增强虽然提高整体准确率，但在严格精度要求下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理在精度敏感任务中的适用性，特别是在需要严格控制误报率的实际应用场景下。

Method: 在安全检测和幻觉检测两个任务上，评估微调和零样本设置下的标准LLM和大型推理模型，比较推理开启和关闭两种模式的表现。

Result: 推理增强提高整体准确率但在低误报率阈值下表现不佳；无推理模式在精度敏感场景中占优；基于token的评分优于自述置信度；简单集成可结合两种模式优势。

Conclusion: 推理是一把双刃剑：有益于平均准确率，但通常不适合需要严格精度的应用场景。

Abstract: Reasoning has become a central paradigm for large language models (LLMs),
consistently boosting accuracy across diverse benchmarks. Yet its suitability
for precision-sensitive tasks remains unclear. We present the first systematic
study of reasoning for classification tasks under strict low false positive
rate (FPR) regimes. Our analysis covers two tasks--safety detection and
hallucination detection--evaluated in both fine-tuned and zero-shot settings,
using standard LLMs and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). Our results reveal a
clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall
accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical
use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these
precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are
acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms
self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a
simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken
together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial
for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict
precision.

### [9] [Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing via Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21059)
*Mahmud Wasif Nafee,Maiqi Jiang,Haipeng Chen,Yanfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: DR-IKE是一个轻量级框架，通过动态检索和筛选演示示例来实现上下文知识编辑，无需修改模型权重，适用于黑盒LLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前上下文知识编辑方法中存在的数量-质量权衡问题和缺乏对任务难度适应性的问题。

Method: 训练BERT检索器用REINFORCE算法按编辑奖励对演示进行排序，并使用可学习阈值修剪低价值示例。

Result: 在COUNTERFACT基准测试中，编辑成功率提升17.1%，延迟降低41.6%，同时保持无关查询的准确性。

Conclusion: DR-IKE展示了可扩展和自适应的知识编辑能力，为黑盒LLM的知识更新提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at factual recall yet still propagate
stale or incorrect knowledge. In-context knowledge editing offers a
gradient-free remedy suitable for black-box APIs, but current editors rely on
static demonstration sets chosen by surface-level similarity, leading to two
persistent obstacles: (i) a quantity-quality trade-off, and (ii) lack of
adaptivity to task difficulty. We address these issues by dynamically selecting
supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose
Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight
framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank
demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to
prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and
expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying
model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with
black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to
17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries,
demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing. The code is available at
https://github.com/mwnafee/DR-IKE .

### [10] [Bridging Language Gaps with Adaptive RAG: Improving Indonesian Language Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21068)
*William Christian,Daniel Adamlu,Adrian Yu,Derwin Suhartono*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究将自适应RAG系统应用于印尼语问答，通过问题复杂度分类器选择回答策略，并使用机器翻译进行数据增强。实验显示分类器可靠，但多检索策略存在不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的问答系统主要针对英语，为弥补语言差距，研究将自适应RAG系统扩展到印尼语。

Method: 采用自适应RAG系统，包含问题复杂度分类器来决定回答策略；使用机器翻译进行数据增强以解决印尼语数据集稀缺问题。

Result: 问题复杂度分类器表现可靠，但多检索回答策略存在显著不一致性，对整体评估产生负面影响。

Conclusion: 研究展示了低资源语言问答的潜力与挑战，为未来改进指明了方向。

Abstract: Question Answering (QA) has seen significant improvements with the
advancement of machine learning models, further studies enhanced this question
answering system by retrieving external information, called Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) to produce more accurate and informative answers. However,
these state-of-the-art-performance is predominantly in English language. To
address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating
Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language. Adaptive RAG system integrates a
classifier whose task is to distinguish the question complexity, which in turn
determines the strategy for answering the question. To overcome the limited
availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine
translation as data augmentation approach. Experiments show reliable question
complexity classifier; however, we observed significant inconsistencies in
multi-retrieval answering strategy which negatively impacted the overall
evaluation when this strategy was applied. These findings highlight both the
promise and challenges of question answering in low-resource language
suggesting directions for future improvement.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了CDrugRed，首个公开的中文药物推荐数据集，专注于代谢疾病的出院药物推荐，包含5,894条去标识化记录，用于评估大语言模型在药物推荐任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能药物推荐系统对提高临床决策质量至关重要，但缺乏公开可用的真实世界电子健康记录数据集，特别是非英语数据集，限制了该领域的发展。

Method: 构建了包含3,190名患者5,894条记录的CDrugRed数据集，涵盖人口统计、病史、临床过程和出院诊断等信息，并基于该数据集对多种最先进的大语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: 监督微调提升了模型性能，但仍有很大改进空间，最佳模型的F1得分为0.5648，Jaccard得分为0.4477，表明临床药物推荐任务的复杂性。

Conclusion: CDrugRed是一个具有挑战性且宝贵的资源，可用于开发更稳健和准确的药物推荐系统，该数据集已公开供研究社区使用。

Abstract: Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is
critical for improving for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical
decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation
systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications
according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and
comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly
hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets,
particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present
CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset
focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes
5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive
information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and
discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several
state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication
recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised
fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for
improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard
score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug
recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable
resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.
The dataset is publicly available to the research community under the data

### [12] [Self-Rewarding PPO: Aligning Large Language Models with Demonstrations Only](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21090)
*Qingru Zhang,Liang Qiu,Ilgee Hong,Zhenghao Xu,Tianyi Liu,Shiyang Li,Rongzhi Zhang,Zheng Li,Lihong Li,Bing Yin,Chao Zhang,Jianshu Chen,Haoming Jiang,Tuo Zhao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Self-Rewarding PPO方法，结合SFT和PPO的优势，通过设计基于SFT模型与预训练基础模型策略比率的奖励函数，实现无需人工偏好标注的在线策略微调，解决SFT的过拟合和泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督微调(SFT)作为对齐大语言模型的重要方法，存在过拟合和域外泛化能力差的问题，特别是在数据有限的情况下。需要一种能提高泛化性能的在线策略微调方法。

Method: 结合SFT和近端策略优化(PPO)，设计以SFT模型与预训练基础模型策略比率为基础的奖励函数，作为隐式奖励信号，实现无需人工标注的在线策略微调。

Result: 在多个自然语言处理任务上的实证评估表明，Self-Rewarding PPO始终优于传统SFT方法，在高质量标注数据稀缺的情况下尤其有效。

Conclusion: Self-Rewarding PPO方法通过自奖励机制与PPO的结合，有效解决了SFT的局限性，提高了泛化能力、数据效率和鲁棒性，为使用演示数据对齐LLMs提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning
large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT,
being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with
overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data
scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel
fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance
generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and
proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from
demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy
ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves
as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the
SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without
relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding
mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization,
data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of
natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO
consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data,
particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.

*Qiang Ding,Lvzhou Luo,Yixuan Cao,Ping Luo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了VeriGray基准，通过引入Out-Dependent类别解决摘要忠实性评估中的标注模糊问题，发现即使最先进的LLM在摘要任务中仍存在约6%的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有忠实性评估基准存在标注模糊问题，主要源于对外部知识使用界限定义不清，导致标注不一致。

Method: 提出新的忠实性标注框架，引入Out-Dependent中间类别来分类需要外部知识验证的情况，并构建VeriGray基准。

Result: 统计显示SOTA LLM在摘要任务中约6%的句子存在幻觉，约8%的生成句子属于Out-Dependent类别，基准对多种基线方法构成挑战。

Conclusion: 解决标注模糊性对于忠实性检测基准至关重要，当前方法仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Ensuring that Large Language Models (LLMs) generate summaries faithful to a
given source document is essential for real-world applications. While prior
research has explored LLM faithfulness, existing benchmarks suffer from
annotation ambiguity, primarily due to the ill-defined boundary of permissible
external knowledge in generated outputs. For instance, common sense is often
incorporated into responses and labeled as "faithful", yet the acceptable
extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent
annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation
framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to
classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using
this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a
new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that
even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\sim 6\%$ of sentences)
in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\sim 8\%$ on
average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category,
underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness
detection benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that our benchmark poses
significant challenges to multiple baseline methods, indicating considerable
room for future improvement.

*Guangxin Su,Hanchen Wang,Jianwei Wang,Wenjie Zhang,Ying Zhang,Jian Pei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次系统性地从编排视角综述了LLM与文本属性图(TAG)的集成，提出了新的分类法，涵盖LLM增强图任务和图结构改进LLM推理两个方向，并讨论了编排策略、技术方法和应用领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLM)在语义理解方面表现出色但缺乏结构化推理能力，而文本属性图(TAG)提供显式关系结构但语义深度不足。两者的结合能够产生互补优势，因此需要系统性地梳理这一交叉领域的研究进展。

Method: 提出了基于编排视角的分类法：1) LLM for TAG方向 - LLM增强图任务；2) TAG for LLM方向 - 图结构改进LLM推理。将编排策略分为顺序、并行和多模块框架，并讨论了TAG特定预训练、提示工程和参数高效微调等技术。

Result: 系统总结了实证见解，整理了可用数据集，并展示了在推荐系统、生物医学分析和知识密集型问答等领域的多样化应用。

Conclusion: LLM与TAG的集成具有巨大潜力，但仍面临开放性挑战，需要进一步研究来推动语言与图学习的交叉领域发展。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in natural
language processing through strong semantic understanding and generation.
However, their black-box nature limits structured and multi-hop reasoning. In
contrast, Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) provide explicit relational structures
enriched with textual context, yet often lack semantic depth. Recent research
shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG
representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of
LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration
from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two
fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and
TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize
orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module
frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Beyond methodology, we summarize empirical
insights, curate available datasets, and highlight diverse applications across
recommendation systems, biomedical analysis, and knowledge-intensive question
answering. Finally, we outline open challenges and promising research
directions, aiming to guide future work at the intersection of language and
graph learning.

*Ning Bian,Xianpei Han,Hongyu Lin,Baolei Wu,Jun Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LLMs在模拟人类行为时存在理想化偏差，无法真实再现人类社会的复杂性，而是创造了缺乏真实多样性的"乌托邦"社会。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要系统分析LLMs在社交模拟中与真实人类行为的差异，避免在社会科学研究和实际应用中产生误解和意外后果。

Method: 通过聊天室式对话模拟多智能体互动，从五个语言维度分析，检验新兴社会认知偏差。

Result: LLMs未能忠实再现真实人类行为，而是反映了受社会期望偏差影响的过度理想化版本，表现出社会角色偏差、首因效应和积极性偏差。

Conclusion: 需要开发更具社会基础性的LLMs，以捕捉人类社交行为的多样性。

Abstract: Reliable simulation of human behavior is essential for explaining,
predicting, and intervening in our society. Recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions,
and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies.
However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in
social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in
scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications.
Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in
social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through
chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic
dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social
cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight
representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not
faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly
idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In
particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias,
resulting in "Utopian" societies that lack the complexity and variability of
real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs
that capture the diversity of human social behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 爱沙尼亚语的LLM基准测试资源有限，缺乏对不同LLM在爱沙尼亚语任务上的全面性能比较。

Method: 基于7个来自爱沙尼亚原生来源的数据集构建基准测试，评估6个基础模型和26个指令调优模型，结合人工评估和LLM作为评判者的方法。

Result: 人工评估得分与基准测试评估呈中等到高度相关，Claude 3.7 Sonnet作为LLM评判者与人类评分高度一致。

Conclusion: 高性能LLM可以有效支持爱沙尼亚语模型的评估，为爱沙尼亚语NLP研究提供了重要基准工具。

Abstract: The availability of LLM benchmarks for the Estonian language is limited, and
a comprehensive evaluation comparing the performance of different LLMs on
Estonian tasks has yet to be conducted. We introduce a new benchmark for
evaluating LLMs in Estonian, based on seven diverse datasets. These datasets
assess general and domain-specific knowledge, understanding of Estonian grammar
and vocabulary, summarization abilities, contextual comprehension, and more.
The datasets are all generated from native Estonian sources without using
machine translation. We compare the performance of base models,
instruction-tuned open-source models, and commercial models. Our evaluation
includes 6 base models and 26 instruction-tuned models. To assess the results,
we employ both human evaluation and LLM-as-a-judge methods. Human evaluation
scores showed moderate to high correlation with benchmark evaluations,
depending on the dataset. Claude 3.7 Sonnet, used as an LLM judge, demonstrated
strong alignment with human ratings, indicating that top-performing LLMs can
effectively support the evaluation of Estonian-language models.

Abstract: The rise of right-wing populism in Europe has brought to the forefront the
significance of analysing social media discourse to understand the
dissemination of extremist ideologies and their impact on political outcomes.
Twitter, as a platform for interaction and mobilisation, provides a unique
window into the everyday communication of far-right supporters. In this paper,
we propose a methodology that uses state-of-the-art natural language processing
techniques with sociological insights to analyse the MIGR-TWIT corpus of
far-right tweets in English and French. We aim to uncover patterns of discourse
surrounding migration, hate speech, and persuasion techniques employed by right
and far-right actors. By integrating linguistic, sociological, and
computational approaches, we seek to offer cross-disciplinary insights into
societal dynamics and contribute to a better understanding of contemporary
challenges posed by right-wing extremism on social media platforms.

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于临床分类学和大型语言模型的多智能体系统，用于模拟紧急医疗调度场景，通过医生评估和自动化分析验证了系统的高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 紧急医疗调度过程面临呼叫者情绪困扰、信息模糊和认知负荷等挑战，需要利用大型语言模型和多智能体系统来增强调度员能力。

Method: 构建了包含32种主要投诉和6种呼叫者身份的分类学框架，开发了基于AutoGen的多智能体系统，包含呼叫者和调度员智能体，使用事实共享库确保临床合理性。

Result: 医生评估显示系统具有高调度有效性（94%正确联系其他代理）和指导效能（91%情况下提供建议），自动分析显示中性情感特征（73.7%中性情感）、高可读性和礼貌风格。

Conclusion: 该分类学基础的多智能体系统能够高保真地模拟多样化临床调度场景，可用于调度员培训、协议评估和实时决策支持，为AI安全集成到应急响应工作流程提供了路径。

Abstract: Objective: Emergency medical dispatch (EMD) is a high-stakes process
challenged by caller distress, ambiguity, and cognitive load. Large Language
Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment
dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded,
LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods:
We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities
from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we
developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system
grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and
mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians
assessed 100 simulated cases for "Guidance Efficacy" and "Dispatch
Effectiveness," supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment,
readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial
inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high
performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 %
contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice
provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic
metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral
affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high
readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 %
impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically
plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for
dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time
decision support. This work outlines a pathway for safely integrating advanced
AI agents into emergency response workflows.

TL;DR: 该论文引入相关维度作为衡量文本复杂性的分形几何方法，揭示了LLM训练中的三个不同阶段，并能检测生成文本的退化现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统评估指标强调局部预测准确性但忽视长程结构复杂性，无法解释LLM即使困惑度低仍出现重复和不连贯等令人困惑的行为。

Method: 使用相关维度这一分形几何度量来量化语言模型感知的文本认识论复杂性，捕捉语言的分层递归结构，在统一框架中连接局部和全局属性。

Result: 相关维度能够：(1)揭示预训练中的三个不同阶段；(2)反映上下文依赖的复杂性；(3)指示模型产生幻觉的倾向；(4)可靠检测生成文本中的多种退化形式。该方法计算高效，对模型量化鲁棒，适用于多种自回归架构。

Conclusion: 相关维度为LLM的生成动态提供了新的见解，是一种有效评估文本复杂性和检测生成退化的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in natural
language generation, yet they continue to display puzzling behaviors -- such as
repetition and incoherence -- even when exhibiting low perplexity. This
highlights a key limitation of conventional evaluation metrics, which emphasize
local prediction accuracy while overlooking long-range structural complexity.
We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of
self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as
perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical
recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a
unified framework. Through extensive experiments, we show that correlation
dimension (1) reveals three distinct phases during pretraining, (2) reflects
context-dependent complexity, (3) indicates a model's tendency toward
hallucination, and (4) reliably detects multiple forms of degeneration in
generated text. The method is computationally efficient, robust to model
quantization (down to 4-bit precision), broadly applicable across
autoregressive architectures (e.g., Transformer and Mamba), and provides fresh
insight into the generative dynamics of LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PBS-Attn的置换块稀疏注意力方法，通过利用注意力的置换特性来提高块级稀疏性，从而提升LLM预填充的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文长度具有显著优势但计算成本高昂，主要由于自注意力机制的O(N^2)复杂度。虽然注意力矩阵通常是稀疏的，但现有块稀疏注意力方法的有效性高度依赖于底层注意力模式，可能导致次优的块级稀疏性。

Method: 提出了PBS-Attn方法，通过置换注意力的块来增加块级稀疏性，并开发了自定义的置换FlashAttention内核。

Result: 在具有挑战性的真实世界长上下文数据集上的实验表明，PBS-Attn在模型准确性上始终优于现有块稀疏注意力方法，并接近完整注意力基线。在长上下文预填充中实现了高达2.75倍的端到端加速。

Conclusion: PBS-Attn是一种即插即用的方法，能够有效提升LLM预填充的计算效率，具有实际可行性。

Abstract: Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant
benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from
the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to
sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency.
Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long
sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention
has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and
skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of
this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can
lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens
for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other
blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted
Block-Sparse Attention (\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that
leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level
sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets,
demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse
attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention
baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn
achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\times$ in long-context
prefilling, confirming its practical viability. Code available at

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: PARL是一种使用大型语言模型作为强化学习智能体的方法，通过提示工程实现，无需微调。该方法在非语言任务中表现良好，但在复杂数学运算任务中存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注语言任务，但缺乏对LLMs在结构化、非语言推理任务（如网格世界位置解释）中作为强化学习智能体的评估。

Method: 通过提示工程将动作、状态和奖励编码到提示中，使LLM能够通过试错与环境交互学习，无需微调。

Result: 在三个标准RL任务中，PARL在简单环境中能够匹配或超越传统RL智能体，但在需要复杂数学运算或状态动作解码的任务中表现受限。

Conclusion: LLMs可以作为有效的RL智能体，特别是在利用预训练知识的简单环境中，但在复杂推理任务中仍面临挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated high performance on tasks
expressed in natural language, particularly in zero- or few-shot settings.
These are typically framed as supervised (e.g., classification) or unsupervised
(e.g., clustering) problems. However, limited work evaluates LLMs as agents in
reinforcement learning (RL) tasks (e.g., playing games), where learning occurs
through interaction with an environment and a reward system. While prior work
focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study
structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid
world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement
Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any
fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling
the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on
three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show
that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by
leveraging pretrained knowledge. However, we identify performance limitations
in tasks that require complex mathematical operations or decoding states and
actions.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多样性导向的采样器，通过注入语义相似性惩罚来减少语义冗余输出，提高采样效率，无需访问基础LLM的梯度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自由形式问答中准确估计LLM的语义偶然性和认知不确定性具有挑战性，传统方法需要大量昂贵的生成样本。

Method: 使用NLI模型在解码过程中注入连续语义相似性惩罚，结合重要性重加权和方差缩减技术来去偏和优化不确定性估计。

Result: 在四个QA基准测试中，该方法在相同样本数量下匹配或超越基线方法，覆盖更多语义聚类。

Conclusion: 该框架作为模块化增强方案，有望在风险敏感模型部署中提升不确定性估计效果。

Abstract: Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large
language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question
answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive
generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages
semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and
masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The
key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's
proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly
finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias
downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their
variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches
or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same
number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base
LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty
estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.

*Gianluca Sperduti,Alejandro Moreo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究探讨了NLP模型在字符顺序混乱（typoglycemia）情况下的鲁棒性，发现英语中较少单词会因此混淆，且混淆单词的上下文差异足够大，使得消歧变得容易。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够阅读字母顺序混乱的单词，一些NLP模型也表现出类似的鲁棒性。本研究旨在揭示这种鲁棒性的根本原因。

Method: 分析英国国家语料库量化单词混淆情况；评估BERT对混淆形式的消歧能力；通过对比在干净和混乱文本上训练的BERT变体进行探测实验。

Result: 字符顺序混乱导致的性能下降比预期要小，混淆单词数量较少且上下文差异明显。

Conclusion: NLP模型对typoglycemia的鲁棒性主要源于英语中混淆单词数量有限，且这些单词的上下文差异足够大，使得模型能够轻松进行消歧。

Abstract: Research in linguistics has shown that humans can read words with internally
scrambled letters, a phenomenon recently dubbed typoglycemia. Some specific NLP
models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to
such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This
raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct
words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under
typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to
shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We
hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively
few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words
tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In
our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word
collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to
disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by
comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic
Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by
scrambling is smaller than expected.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: TripTide是第一个评估LLM在现实旅行中断情况下修改行程能力的基准，通过建模中断严重程度和旅行者容忍度等维度，从自动指标、LLM作为评判和人工专家评估三个方面进行综合评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有旅行规划系统如TripCraft和TravelPlanner虽然能够生成个性化行程，但无法有效处理现实旅行中常见的中断情况（如航班取消、天气关闭等），需要评估LLM在动态环境下的适应能力。

Method: 提出TripTide基准，包含三个评估维度：1）自动指标（意图保持、响应性、适应性）；2）LLM作为评判的自动质量评估；3）人工专家评估语义、空间、序列和响应方面的保持情况。

Result: 实验显示LLM在序列一致性和语义稳定性方面表现良好，空间偏差在短途旅行中较大但随行程延长而减小，说明长行程促进更好的地理连贯性。但随着行程长度增加，中断处理能力下降，揭示了LLM鲁棒性的局限性。

Conclusion: TripTide为评估LLM在现实不确定性下的旅行规划适应性、个性化和韧性建立了基准，揭示了当前LLM在长行程中断处理方面的能力限制。

Abstract: Recent efforts like TripCraft and TravelPlanner have advanced the use of
Large Language Models ( LLMs) for personalized, constraint aware travel
itinerary generation. Yet, real travel often faces disruptions. To address
this, we present TripTide, the first benchmark evaluating LLM's ability to
revise itineraries under realistic disruptions. TripTide models key dimensions
such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment
of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or
overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce
automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan
maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and
appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial,
and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply
an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we
perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic,
spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs
maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial
deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones,
indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However,
disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting
limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating
adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning
under real-world uncertainty.

TL;DR: 研究发现单轮训练在推理任务中比多轮训练更有效，单轮训练的模型在单轮和多轮评估中都表现良好，而多轮训练的模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的推理能力通常通过单轮强化学习开发，但实际应用涉及多轮人机交互，存在训练与部署条件不匹配的问题。研究旨在探索多轮训练对人机反馈推理任务是否必要。

Method: 比较传统单轮训练与三种多轮训练策略，评估模型在单轮和多轮设置下的表现。

Result: 单轮训练模型在单轮和多轮评估中都有效泛化，而多轮训练模型在单轮推理性能上显著下降。多轮训练仅提供有限益处，甚至可能损害推理能力。

Conclusion: 对于信息完整的任务，稳健的单轮训练比多轮训练更有效可靠，多轮训练在基础反馈下益处有限且可能降低推理能力。

Abstract: The reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically
developed through the single-turn reinforcement learning, whereas real-world
applications often involve multi-turn interactions with human feedback, leading
to a potential mismatch between training and deployment conditions. In this
work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for
reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three
multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We
find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to
both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn
strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning
performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information,
robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn
training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade
reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的瑞典基准多为翻译自美国中心的基准，不适合测试瑞典特有的相关知识。需要专门针对瑞典人物和事件的本地化基准。

Method: 手动构建问答基准，灵感来自瑞典流行广播节目和主要体育赛事，包含英语翻译以测试跨语言事实一致性。

Result: 发现具有更强瑞典覆盖的小模型在回忆瑞典相关事实方面与三倍大的多语言模型表现相当。继续在瑞典语上预训练通常能改善事实知识，但也会导致部分先前知识的遗忘。

Conclusion: 该数据集可作为研究多语言模型中语言适应和知识保留的诊断工具，展示了其在语言适应研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Many Swedish benchmarks are translated US-centric benchmarks, and therefore
not suitable for testing knowledge that is particularly relevant, or even
specific, to Sweden. We therefore introduce a manually written
question-answering benchmark specifically targeted to Sweden-related
personalities and events, many of which receive very limited coverage in
international media. Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio
program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major
sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall
across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to
probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations.
Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage
perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling
Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish
generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of
the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's
potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge
retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.

Result: SindBERT在词性标注、命名实体识别、冒犯性语言检测和TurBLiMP语言可接受性基准测试中表现有竞争力，大型变体在四个任务中的两个获得最佳分数，但整体没有一致的扩展优势。

Conclusion: SindBERT作为土耳其语NLP的开放资源，同时作为实证案例研究，揭示了扩展的局限性以及语料库组成在形态丰富语言中的核心作用。

Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized NLP, yet many morphologically rich
languages remain underrepresented in large-scale pre-training efforts. With
SindBERT, we set out to chart the seas of Turkish NLP, providing the first
large-scale RoBERTa-based encoder for Turkish. Trained from scratch on 312 GB
of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base
and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only
language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech
tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the
TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT
performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the
large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no
consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed
for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be
saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models
such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer
data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released
resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of
scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich
languages. The SindBERT models are released under the MIT license and made
available in both fairseq and Huggingface formats.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个描述性字幕数据集和综合评估方法，用于评估视觉语言模型在人类活动识别中的表现。通过与传统深度学习模型对比实验，发现VLMs达到了可比甚至更优的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，视觉语言模型在医疗健康应用中展现出潜力，但在人类活动识别这一远程健康监测领域的应用仍相对不足。VLMs具有更高的灵活性和克服传统深度学习模型限制的能力，但评估其动态和非确定性输出存在挑战。

Method: 引入描述性字幕数据集，并提出综合评估方法来评估VLMs在人类活动识别中的表现。通过与传统深度学习模型进行对比实验。

Result: 实验结果表明，视觉语言模型在人类活动识别中达到了与传统深度学习模型相当的性能，在某些情况下甚至超越了传统方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为视觉语言模型在智能医疗系统中的集成提供了强有力的基准，并开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: As generative AI continues to evolve, Vision Language Models (VLMs) have
emerged as promising tools in various healthcare applications. One area that
remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition
(HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including
greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of
traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to
HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often
non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive
caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs
in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning
models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and,
in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This
work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the
integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.

TL;DR: 传统IR指标不适用于RAG系统评估，本文提出UDCG指标，通过考虑LLM处理特性和干扰文档的负面影响，显著提升了与RAG性能的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IR指标基于人类用户顺序浏览文档的假设，而RAG系统中LLM整体处理所有检索文档，且干扰文档会主动降低生成质量，导致传统指标与RAG性能不匹配。

Method: 提出基于效用的标注方案，量化相关文档的正面贡献和干扰文档的负面影响，并设计LLM导向的位置折扣机制，开发UDCG指标。

Result: 在5个数据集和6个LLM上的实验表明，UDCG相比传统指标将相关性提升了最高36%。

Conclusion: UDCG为IR评估与LLM消费者对齐提供了关键步骤，能够更可靠地评估RAG组件性能。

Abstract: Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR,
assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing
attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language
Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole
rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account
for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality,
rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely
human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility,
classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a
utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution
of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on
this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative
Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize
the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five
datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36%
compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward
aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment
of RAG components

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the
demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased.
Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data,
visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such
as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable
gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an
autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices.
The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer
data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient
video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly
detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to
identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A
distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing
component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a
patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's
inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all
patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access
real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting
with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our
experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for
real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals
and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities
of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness
of its various capabilities.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a
promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models
(LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance,
especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals
that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of
masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token
correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation:
intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that
enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we
propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to
consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically,
our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and
reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple
elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance
sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling
efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only
improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups
while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.

Abstract: Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human
brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as
promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain.
However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain
alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data
available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants
and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we
fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses
from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned
models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across
participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the
amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up
to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization
to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning
additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that
training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more
generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge
the gap between the two fields. We make our code and models publicly available
at https://github.com/bridge-ai-neuro/multi-brain-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAG系统虽然整合外部知识来减少幻觉，但模型仍经常生成与检索内容不一致的输出。现有方法通常混淆外部上下文和参数知识的贡献，需要准确分离这两者来进行有效的幻觉检测。

Method: 探索基于外部上下文分数和参数知识分数的机制检测方法。使用Qwen3-0.6b计算各层和注意力头的这些分数，并训练基于回归的分类器来预测幻觉。

Result: 该方法在GPT-5、GPT-4.1等先进LLM和RAGAS、TruLens、RefChecker等检测基线方法上进行了评估。在Qwen3-0.6b上训练的检测器能够泛化到GPT-4.1-mini的响应，展示了代理模型评估的潜力。

Conclusion: 机制信号是RAG系统中幻觉检测的高效且可泛化的预测因子，为幻觉检测提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates external knowledge to
mitigate hallucinations, yet models often generate outputs inconsistent with
retrieved content. Accurate hallucination detection requires disentangling the
contributions of external context and parametric knowledge, which prior methods
typically conflate. We investigate the mechanisms underlying RAG hallucinations
and find they arise when later-layer FFN modules disproportionately inject
parametric knowledge into the residual stream. To address this, we explore a
mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric
knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and
attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict
hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5,
GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore,
classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses,
demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation. Our results highlight
mechanistic signals as efficient, generalizable predictors for hallucination
detection in RAG systems.

Abstract: We apply category theory to extract multimodal document structure which leads
us to develop information theoretic measures, content summarization and
extension, and self-supervised improvement of large pretrained models. We first
develop a mathematical representation of a document as a category of
question-answer pairs. Second, we develop an orthogonalization procedure to
divide the information contained in one or more documents into non-overlapping
pieces. The structures extracted in the first and second steps lead us to
develop methods to measure and enumerate the information contained in a
document. We also build on those steps to develop new summarization techniques,
as well as to develop a solution to a new problem viz. exegesis resulting in an
extension of the original document. Our question-answer pair methodology
enables a novel rate distortion analysis of summarization techniques. We
implement our techniques using large pretrained models, and we propose a
multimodal extension of our overall mathematical framework. Finally, we develop
a novel self-supervised method using RLVR to improve large pretrained models
using consistency constraints such as composability and closure under certain
operations that stem naturally from our category theoretic framework.

Motivation: 探索语言谱系结构是否影响LLMs的多语言行为变异，填补该领域的研究空白。

Method: 扩展MultiQ数据集分析，检查模型在提示语言保真度不足时是否倾向于切换到语系相关语言，并比较语系内与跨语系的知识一致性。

Result: 发现语系级效应存在但受训练资源可用性强烈制约，不同LLMs家族表现出不同的多语言策略。

Conclusion: LLMs确实编码了语系级结构特征，但训练数据不平衡仍是塑造其多语言性能的主要因素。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display notable variation in multilingual
behavior, yet the role of genealogical language structure in shaping this
variation remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate whether LLMs
exhibit sensitivity to linguistic genera by extending prior analyses on the
MultiQ dataset. We first check if models prefer to switch to genealogically
related languages when prompt language fidelity is not maintained. Next, we
investigate whether knowledge consistency is better preserved within than
across genera. We show that genus-level effects are present but strongly
conditioned by training resource availability. We further observe distinct
multilingual strategies across LLMs families. Our findings suggest that LLMs
encode aspects of genus-level structure, but training data imbalances remain
the primary factor shaping their multilingual performance.

Motivation: 随着语言模型能力的增强，需要更挑战性的评估来超越表面语言能力，关注语用学——理解情境意义、语言和文化规范。

Method: 创建了包含405个多项选择题的斯洛文尼亚语语用理解基准测试，进行了翻译难度讨论、建立人类基线的活动，并进行了LLM的试点评估。

Result: 当前模型在理解细微语言方面有很大改进，但在推断非字面表达中隐含的说话者意义方面仍有困难，特别是文化特定表达。专有模型和开源模型之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 针对细微语言理解和目标文化知识的基准测试需要谨慎设计，最好从本地数据构建，并用人类响应进行验证。

Abstract: Large language models are demonstrating increasing capabilities, excelling at
benchmarks once considered very difficult. As their capabilities grow, there is
a need for more challenging evaluations that go beyond surface-level linguistic
competence. Namely, language competence involves not only syntax and semantics
but also pragmatics, i.e., understanding situational meaning as shaped by
context as well as linguistic and cultural norms. To contribute to this line of
research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics
understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405
multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe
the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with
LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in
understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker
meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific.
We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.
Finally, we argue that benchmarks targeting nuanced language understanding and
knowledge of the target culture must be designed with care, preferably
constructed from native data, and validated with human responses.

Method: 使用字符级和音节级音位组合特征的无监督异常检测算法，应用于多语言的Kokborok方言与Bangla数据集。

Result: 音节感知特征显著优于字符级基线方法，虽然精确率和召回率因异常性质微妙而保持适中，但高召回率方法能为实地工作者提供系统验证标记。

Conclusion: 该方法为实地工作者提供了系统识别需要验证条目的方法，支持低资源语言文档的数据质量改进。

Abstract: Lexical data collection in language documentation often contains
transcription errors and undocumented borrowings that can mislead linguistic

phonotactic inconsistencies in wordlists, applying them to a multilingual
dataset of Kokborok varieties with Bangla. Using character-level and
syllable-level phonotactic features, our algorithms identify potential
transcription errors and borrowings. While precision and recall remain modest
due to the subtle nature of these anomalies, syllable-aware features
significantly outperform character-level baselines. The high-recall approach
provides fieldworkers with a systematic method to flag entries requiring
verification, supporting data quality improvement in low-resourced language

Motivation: 大语言模型在数学和编程任务中表现出色，但在金融任务特别是股票预测方面应用不足。现有模型存在两个问题：过度依赖分析师观点而非独立分析逻辑；未能有效权衡对抗性证据。

Method: 提出RETuning方法，在强化学习前进行冷启动，动态构建分析框架，从多样化信息来源组织证据并评分，基于框架而非上下文观点进行反思性预测。

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding
reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their
application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock
movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class
classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning
responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit
a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from
different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such
counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model
does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To
address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start
method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While
generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical
framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for
price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual
viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach
maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring
independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We
also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks,
with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and
news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental
data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that
RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial
domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on
out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock
movement prediction.

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和测量之间建立了定量桥梁，为推理架构提供了机制性见解，揭示了人工智能与人类认知的对齐以及LLMs如何重塑人类推理过程。

Abstract: Understanding how information is dynamically accumulated and transformed in
human reasoning has long challenged cognitive psychology, philosophy, and
artificial intelligence. Existing accounts, from classical logic to
probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but
do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning
dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track),
that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify
information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained
analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the
universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space.
We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies
systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to
discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus
dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and
human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach
establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering
mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.

Method: 提出Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training方法，在适配器训练期间通过ControlNet或LoRA等辅助模块引导混杂因素，消除适配器内部化这些因素的动机，然后在推理时移除辅助模块。

Result: 在面部和全身身份注入等任务中，该方法提高了生成质量、多样性和提示遵循能力。

Conclusion: 在大模型时代，寻求解耦表示的最有效路径可能是为不应学习的内容建立捷径。

Abstract: Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the
capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and
stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to
capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using
single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image
inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle
the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and
lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs
the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we
uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to
eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,
confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or
LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The
auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like
facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation
quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general
design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled
representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what
should NOT be learned.

*Yuxuan Bian,Xin Chen,Zenan Li,Tiancheng Zhi,Shen Sang,Linjie Luo,Qiang Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-As-Prompt (VAP) 提出了一种新的视频生成范式，通过使用参考视频作为语义提示，结合冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer和可插拔的Mixture-of-Transformers专家，实现了统一、可泛化的语义控制视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频生成中统一、可泛化语义控制的关键挑战，现有方法要么引入伪影，要么依赖非泛化的条件特定微调或任务特定架构。

Method: 使用参考视频作为直接语义提示，通过冻结的Video Diffusion Transformer和可插拔的Mixture-of-Transformers专家架构，采用时间偏置位置嵌入来消除虚假映射先验。

Result: 作为单一统一模型，VAP在开源方法中达到最先进水平，获得38.7%的用户偏好率，与领先的条件特定商业模型相媲美。

Conclusion: VAP的强零样本泛化能力和对各种下游应用的支持，标志着向通用可控视频生成的重要进展。

Abstract: Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a
critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by
enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or
rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific
architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes
this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a
direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via
a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture
prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position
embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval.
To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the
largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired
videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a
new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference
rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong
zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a
significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FM-BFF-Net网络，结合CNN和Transformer，使用焦点调制注意力机制和双向特征融合模块，在医学图像分割任务中超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对临床诊断和治疗至关重要，但传统CNN难以捕捉全局上下文信息和长距离依赖关系，限制了复杂边界和多样化尺寸结构的分割精度。

Method: 结合卷积和Transformer组件，采用焦点调制注意力机制增强上下文感知，引入双向特征融合模块实现编码器-解码器跨尺度高效交互。

Result: 在8个公开数据集（包括息肉检测、皮肤病变分割和超声成像）上的实验表明，FM-BFF-Net在Jaccard指数和Dice系数上持续超越最新方法。

Conclusion: FM-BFF-Net通过融合CNN和Transformer的优势，提高了边界精度和对病变尺寸、形状、对比度变化的鲁棒性，在多样化医学成像场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as
disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring
because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical
structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural
networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution
operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range
dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment
structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this
restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global
context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based
architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges.
To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional
Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as
FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional
and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to
refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module
that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations
across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and
robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive
experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection,
skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net
consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and
Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse
medical imaging scenarios.

TL;DR: GenPT是一个生成式点跟踪框架，通过流匹配方法建模多模态轨迹，在遮挡情况下能捕捉不确定性并提升跟踪精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有判别式模型在点跟踪中只能回归到均值或众数，无法捕捉多模态不确定性，特别是在遮挡等视觉模糊情况下。

Method: 采用流匹配框架，结合判别式跟踪器的迭代优化、跨窗口一致性先验和专门为点坐标设计的方差调度。推理时使用最佳优先搜索策略。

Result: 在PointOdyssey、Dynamic Replica和TAP-Vid基准测试中表现优异，特别是在遮挡点跟踪上达到SOTA，同时在可见点跟踪上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: GenPT通过生成式方法成功捕捉点轨迹的多模态特性，显著提升了遮挡情况下的跟踪性能。

Abstract: Tracking a point through a video can be a challenging task due to uncertainty
arising from visual obfuscations, such as appearance changes and occlusions.
Although current state-of-the-art discriminative models excel in regressing
long-term point trajectory estimates -- even through occlusions -- they are
limited to regressing to a mean (or mode) in the presence of uncertainty, and
fail to capture multi-modality. To overcome this limitation, we introduce
Generative Point Tracker (GenPT), a generative framework for modelling
multi-modal trajectories. GenPT is trained with a novel flow matching
formulation that combines the iterative refinement of discriminative trackers,
a window-dependent prior for cross-window consistency, and a variance schedule
tuned specifically for point coordinates. We show how our model's generative
capabilities can be leveraged to improve point trajectory estimates by
utilizing a best-first search strategy on generated samples during inference,
guided by the model's own confidence of its predictions. Empirically, we
evaluate GenPT against the current state of the art on the standard
PointOdyssey, Dynamic Replica, and TAP-Vid benchmarks. Further, we introduce a
TAP-Vid variant with additional occlusions to assess occluded point tracking
performance and highlight our model's ability to capture multi-modality. GenPT
is capable of capturing the multi-modality in point trajectories, which
translates to state-of-the-art tracking accuracy on occluded points, while
maintaining competitive tracking accuracy on visible points compared to extant
discriminative point trackers.

TL;DR: 提出了3DReasonKnee数据集，这是首个用于医学图像的3D基础推理数据集，包含494k个高质量五元组，支持视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中进行解剖区域定位和逐步推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在3D医学图像中难以定位解剖区域并进行逐步推理，这限制了模型输出与临床诊断工作流程的对齐，影响了临床医生与AI的信任协作。

Method: 创建了3DReasonKnee数据集，包含7,970个3D膝关节MRI体积，每个样本包括：3D MRI体积、针对特定解剖区域的诊断问题、3D边界框定位、临床医生生成的诊断推理步骤以及结构化严重程度评估。

Result: 建立了ReasonKnee-Bench评估框架，对五种最先进的视觉语言模型进行基准测试，提供了定位和诊断准确性的基线性能。

Conclusion: 3DReasonKnee作为骨科医生诊断专业知识的存储库，为推进多模态医学AI系统向3D、临床对齐的定位决策能力提供了重要测试平台。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to ground anatomical regions
in 3D medical images and reason about them in a step-by-step manner, a key
requirement of real-world diagnostic assessment. This ability is essential for
aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in
practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets
provide localization labels, but none support this "grounded reasoning"
ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded
reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality
quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1)
the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical
region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4)
clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D
reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant
anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over
450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating
reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We
establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy,
providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment
across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five
state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By
providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways,
3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic
expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI
systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for detailed 3D shape reconstruction
utilizing thermal polarization cues. Unlike state-of-the-art methods, the
proposed approach is independent of illumination and material properties. In
this paper, we formulate a general theory of polarization observation and show
that long-wave infrared (LWIR) polarimetric imaging is free from the
ambiguities that affect visible polarization analyses. Subsequently, we propose
a method for recovering detailed 3D shapes using multi-view thermal
polarimetric images. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
effectively reconstructs fine details in transparent, translucent, and
heterogeneous objects, outperforming existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型在分布偏移和标注稀缺的领域表现不佳，而传统的监督微调不可行。虽然自监督学习在语言模型中有效，但在视觉编码器中效果不佳

Method: 基于自蒸馏范式，使用多视角物体中心视频进行自监督微调，精心调整预测头并部署参数高效适应技术，防止模型遗忘预训练知识

Result: 在3个视觉基础模型和2个数据集上的实验表明，VESSA在下游分类任务中相比基础模型和先前适应方法有持续改进

Conclusion: VESSA能够有效利用无标注视频数据适应视觉基础模型，在标注稀缺情况下提升模型性能

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced computer vision by enabling strong
performance across diverse tasks through large-scale pretraining and supervised
fine-tuning. However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts
and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While
continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for
generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for
vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel
formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where
the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging
only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as
VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual
foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation
paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy
parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly
forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits
significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames
in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture
conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments
with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent
improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models
and previous adaptation methods. Code is publicly available at
https://github.com/jesimonbarreto/VESSA.

Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计流水线在复杂工业环境下（如杂乱、光照差、背景复杂）性能下降，检测成为关键瓶颈，需要解决这些挑战性问题。

Method: 基于当前SOTA基线，结合低光图像增强和基于开放词汇检测的背景去除，抑制原始SAM输出中的误报，为下游姿态估计提供更可靠的检测结果。

Result: 在真实工业bin-picking基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升检测精度，同时推理开销可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该方法在工业环境中表现出有效性和实用性，能够显著改善未见物体的2D检测性能。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation is essential for robotic manipulation in
industrial environments. Existing pipelines typically rely on off-the-shelf
object detectors followed by cropping and pose refinement, but their
performance degrades under challenging conditions such as clutter, poor
lighting, and complex backgrounds, making detection the critical bottleneck. In
this work, we introduce a standardized and plug-in pipeline for 2D detection of
unseen objects in industrial settings. Based on current SOTA baselines, our
approach reduces domain shift and background artifacts through low-light image
enhancement and background removal guided by open-vocabulary detection with
foundation models. This design suppresses the false positives prevalent in raw
SAM outputs, yielding more reliable detections for downstream pose estimation.
Extensive experiments on real-world industrial bin-picking benchmarks from BOP
demonstrate that our method significantly boosts detection accuracy while
incurring negligible inference overhead, showing the effectiveness and
practicality of the proposed method.

Conclusion: 研究表明通过图像数据收集、标注和深度学习方法，可以在各种损伤情境下实现快速自动化的灾后损伤检测。

Abstract: Timely assessment of integrity of structures after seismic events is crucial
for public safety and emergency response. This study focuses on assessing the
structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed
steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes.
Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or
shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an
indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect
exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey
Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete
structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced
with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An
automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify
inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only
Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed
bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of
structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid
framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input
images. This research demonstrates that rapid and automated damage detection
following disasters is achievable across diverse damage contexts by utilizing
image data collection, annotation, and deep learning approaches.

Motivation: 现有3D场景图生成方法局限于单视角、不支持增量更新、缺乏3D几何接地，这些限制在具身场景中至关重要。

Method: 利用VLM推理生成丰富的2D场景图，通过深度信息将其接地到3D空间，节点包含开放词汇对象特征、3D位置和语义上下文，边捕获空间语义关系和物体间距离。

Result: 在Replica和HM3D数据集上的实验表明，ZING-3D能够有效捕获空间和关系知识，无需任务特定训练。

Conclusion: ZING-3D框架成功实现了零样本3D场景理解，支持增量更新和几何接地，为下游机器人应用提供了有效的场景表示。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning about complex 3D environments requires structured
scene representations that capture not only objects but also their semantic and
spatial relationships. While recent works on 3D scene graph generation have
leveraged pretrained VLMs without task-specific fine-tuning, they are largely
confined to single-view settings, fail to support incremental updates as new
observations arrive and lack explicit geometric grounding in 3D space, all of
which are essential for embodied scenarios. In this paper, we propose, ZING-3D,
a framework that leverages the vast knowledge of pretrained foundation models
to enable open-vocabulary recognition and generate a rich semantic
representation of the scene in a zero-shot manner while also enabling
incremental updates and geometric grounding in 3D space, making it suitable for
downstream robotics applications. Our approach leverages VLM reasoning to
generate a rich 2D scene graph, which is grounded in 3D using depth
information. Nodes represent open-vocabulary objects with features, 3D
locations, and semantic context, while edges capture spatial and semantic
relations with inter-object distances. Our experiments on scenes from the
Replica and HM3D dataset show that ZING-3D is effective at capturing spatial
and relational knowledge without the need of task-specific training.

Motivation: 现有语义分割网络过度依赖强大的预训练编码器，但使用过于简单的解码器，导致语义上下文和细粒度细节保存之间的权衡不理想。

Method: 提出WaveSeg解码器：1）从输入图像学习高频分量作为显式先验；2）使用双域操作进行多尺度融合；3）提出频谱分解注意力块，利用Mamba的线性复杂度长程建模增强高频结构细节；4）应用重参数化卷积在小波域保持低频语义完整性；5）残差引导融合整合多尺度特征。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，WaveSeg在定量和定性评估中均优于最先进方法，实现了高效精确的分割。

Conclusion: WaveSeg通过在小波域利用频率先验和基于Mamba的注意力机制，能够一致地超越现有方法，在语义分割任务中取得优异性能。

Abstract: While recent semantic segmentation networks heavily rely on powerful
pretrained encoders, most employ simplistic decoders, leading to suboptimal
trade-offs between semantic context and fine-grained detail preservation. To
address this, we propose a novel decoder architecture, WaveSeg, which jointly
optimizes feature refinement in spatial and wavelet domains. Specifically,
high-frequency components are first learned from input images as explicit
priors to reinforce boundary details at early stages. A multi-scale fusion
mechanism, Dual Domain Operation (DDO), is then applied, and the novel Spectrum
Decomposition Attention (SDA) block is proposed, which is developed to leverage
Mamba's linear-complexity long-range modeling to enhance high-frequency
structural details. Meanwhile, reparameterized convolutions are applied to
preserve low-frequency semantic integrity in the wavelet domain. Finally, a
residual-guided fusion integrates multi-scale features with boundary-aware
representations at native resolution, producing semantically and structurally
rich feature maps. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
that WaveSeg, leveraging wavelet-domain frequency prior with Mamba-based
attention, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both
quantitatively and qualitatively, achieving efficient and precise segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在肠神经丛分类任务中表现良好但缺乏可解释性，且不符合医生的决策方式，需要整合专家知识来提升模型的临床相关性。

Method: 使用基于对比语言-图像预训练的视觉语言模型，整合专家来源的文本概念（来自医学教科书和论文），通过大型语言模型生成提示并编码，将临床相关语义线索与视觉特征对齐。

Result: 模型在准确率(83.9%)、精确度(86.6%)和特异性(87.6%)方面优于VGG-19、ResNet-18和ResNet-50等CNN模型。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在组织病理学中具有潜力，整合专家知识可以产生更具临床相关性的模型输出。

Abstract: Hirschsprung's disease is defined as the congenital absence of ganglion cells
in some segment(s) of the colon. The muscle cannot make coordinated movements
to propel stool in that section, most commonly leading to obstruction. The
diagnosis and treatment for this disease require a clear identification of
different region(s) of the myenteric plexus, where ganglion cells should be
present, on the microscopic view of the tissue slide. While deep learning
approaches, such as Convolutional Neural Networks, have performed very well in
this task, they are often treated as black boxes, with minimal understanding
gained from them, and may not conform to how a physician makes decisions. In
this study, we propose a novel framework that integrates expert-derived textual
concepts into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training-based vision-language
model to guide plexus classification. Using prompts derived from expert sources
(e.g., medical textbooks and papers) generated by large language models and
reviewed by our team before being encoded with QuiltNet, our approach aligns
clinically relevant semantic cues with visual features. Experimental results
show that the proposed model demonstrated superior discriminative capability
across different classification metrics as it outperformed CNN-based models,
including VGG-19, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50; achieving an accuracy of 83.9%, a
precision of 86.6%, and a specificity of 87.6%. These findings highlight the
potential of multi-modal learning in histopathology and underscore the value of
incorporating expert knowledge for more clinically relevant model outputs.

Motivation: 现有的Retinex低光照图像增强方法在处理大尺寸图像时耗时严重，需要一种更高效的增强方法。

Method: 定义直方图位置矩阵和计数矩阵，构建直方图域Retinex模型；建立两级优化模型，通过求解得到光照和反射率直方图的迭代公式；通过直方图匹配实现图像增强。

Result: 在1000*664分辨率图像上仅需1.86秒，比现有方法至少节省6.67秒；在可见性和性能指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HistRetinex方法在保持增强质量的同时显著提高了处理速度，为实时低光照图像增强提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Retinex-based low-light image enhancement methods are widely used due to
their excellent performance. However, most of them are time-consuming for
large-sized images. This paper extends the Retinex model from the spatial
domain to the histogram domain, and proposes a novel histogram-based Retinex
model for fast low-light image enhancement, named HistRetinex. Firstly, we
define the histogram location matrix and the histogram count matrix, which
establish the relationship among histograms of the illumination, reflectance
and the low-light image. Secondly, based on the prior information and the
histogram-based Retinex model, we construct a novel two-level optimization
model. Through solving the optimization model, we give the iterative formulas
of the illumination histogram and the reflectance histogram, respectively.
Finally, we enhance the low-light image through matching its histogram with the
one provided by HistRetinex. Experimental results demonstrate that the
HistRetinex outperforms existing enhancement methods in both visibility and
performance metrics, while executing 1.86 seconds on 1000*664 resolution
images, achieving a minimum time saving of 6.67 seconds.

Result: PhysVLM-AVR在CLEVR-AVR、具身推理(OpenEQA, RoboVQA)和被动视觉推理(GeoMath, Geometry30K)上达到最先进性能。分析显示当前具身MLLMs虽能检测信息不完整性，但难以通过交互主动获取和整合新信息。

Conclusion: 主动视觉推理是MLLMs发展的关键方向，当前模型在主动推理能力上存在根本性差距，需要进一步研究如何让模型通过交互主动获取和整合信息。

Abstract: Visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has primarily
been studied in static, fully observable settings, limiting their effectiveness
in real-world environments where information is often incomplete due to
occlusion or limited field of view. Humans, in contrast, actively explore and
interact with their environment-moving, examining, and manipulating objects-to
gather information through a closed-loop process integrating perception,
reasoning, and action. Inspired by this human capability, we introduce the
Active Visual Reasoning (AVR) task, extending visual reasoning to partially
observable, interactive environments. AVR necessitates agents to: (1) actively
acquire information via sequential physical actions, (2) integrate observations
across multiple steps for coherent reasoning, and (3) dynamically adjust
decisions based on evolving visual feedback. To rigorously evaluate AVR, we
introduce CLEVR-AVR, a simulation benchmark featuring multi-round interactive
environments designed to assess both reasoning correctness and
information-gathering efficiency. We present AVR-152k, a large-scale dataset
that offers rich Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations detailing iterative
reasoning for uncertainty identification, action-conditioned information gain
prediction, and information-maximizing action selection, crucial for training
agents in a higher-order Markov Decision Process. Building on this, we develop
PhysVLM-AVR, an MLLM achieving state-of-the-art performance on CLEVR-AVR,
embodied reasoning (OpenEQA, RoboVQA), and passive visual reasoning (GeoMath,
Geometry30K). Our analysis also reveals that current embodied MLLMs, despite
detecting information incompleteness, struggle to actively acquire and
integrate new information through interaction, highlighting a fundamental gap
in active reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向对象的、不确定性感知的城市场景LiDAR变化检测方法，通过多分辨率NDT和点对平面ICP进行时序对齐，利用几何代理和语义分割进行跨时期关联，在15个Subiaco区块上达到95.2%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DSM差分和基于图像的方法对垂直偏差、地面坡度和视点失配敏感，点云神经网络模型需要大内存且假设完美预对齐，现有方法难以处理分割合并情况且忽略不确定性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理城市场景LiDAR变化检测中的分割合并问题，通过不确定性感知和对象中心的方法提高了检测精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: High-definition 3D city maps underpin smart transportation, digital twins,
and autonomous driving, where object level change detection across bi temporal
LiDAR enables HD map maintenance, construction monitoring, and reliable
localization. Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive
to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise
outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings
demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin
structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split
or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object
centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs
with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height,
and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and
surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes.
Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by
semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment
with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class
counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes,
and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement,
and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the
local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling
variation. On 15 representative Subiaco blocks the method attains 95.2%
accuracy, 90.4% mF1, and 82.6% mIoU, exceeding Triplet KPConv by 0.2 percentage
points in accuracy, 0.2 in mF1, and 0.8 in mIoU, with the largest gain on
Decreased where IoU reaches 74.8% and improves by 7.6 points.

Conclusion: Controllable-LPMoE方法通过动态先验调制实现了高效微调，在多个二值对象分割任务中具有出色的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models provide powerful feature representations for
downstream object segmentation tasks. However, when adapted to specific tasks
through the full-parameter fine-tuning, the enormous parameters being updated
often results in significant computational overhead, creating a bottleneck in
training efficiency. Although existing methods attempt to fine-tune frozen
models by directly embedding trainable prompts, these prompts lack inherent
semantic priors, limiting the adaptability of large-scale models. In this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic priors-based fine-tuning paradigm with fewer
trainable parameters, dubbed Controllable-LPMoE, which adaptively modulates
frozen foundation models by dynamically controlling local priors to enhance
fine-grained perception for specific segmentation tasks. More specifically, we
construct a lightweight dynamic mixed local priors extractor that captures
diverse local priors from input images through heterogeneous convolutions while
employing a gating network to dynamically output expert priors required for the
subsequent fine-tuning. Furthermore, we design a bi-directional interaction
adapter that employs cosine-aligned deformable attention and channel-oriented
adaptive scale enhancement to interact and restructure between frozen and
trainable features, achieving efficient fine-tuning. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our
\href{https://github.com/CSYSI/Controllable-LPMoE} {Controllable-LPMoE}
approach, demonstrating excellent segmentation performance compared to 31
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and adaptability to multiple binary object
segmentation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像安全数据集过于粗糙和模糊，只提供宽泛的安全标签，无法隔离驱动安全差异的具体特征。需要系统区分良性图像和问题图像的方法。

Method: 利用图像编辑模型对图像进行针对性修改，只改变与安全策略相关的特征，从而翻转安全标签，同时保持安全无关细节不变。

Result: 构建的基准数据集能有效评估视觉语言模型区分细微图像差异的能力，并作为数据增强策略提高轻量级防护模型的训练效率。

Conclusion: SafetyPairs为研究细粒度图像安全区分提供了首个系统性资源，在评估模型能力和提升训练效率方面都有重要价值。

Abstract: What exactly makes a particular image unsafe? Systematically differentiating
between benign and problematic images is a challenging problem, as subtle
changes to an image, such as an insulting gesture or symbol, can drastically
alter its safety implications. However, existing image safety datasets are
coarse and ambiguous, offering only broad safety labels without isolating the
specific features that drive these differences. We introduce SafetyPairs, a
scalable framework for generating counterfactual pairs of images, that differ
only in the features relevant to the given safety policy, thus flipping their
safety label. By leveraging image editing models, we make targeted changes to
images that alter their safety labels while leaving safety-irrelevant details
unchanged. Using SafetyPairs, we construct a new safety benchmark, which serves
as a powerful source of evaluation data that highlights weaknesses in
vision-language models' abilities to distinguish between subtly different
images. Beyond evaluation, we find our pipeline serves as an effective data
augmentation strategy that improves the sample efficiency of training
lightweight guard models. We release a benchmark containing over 3,020
SafetyPair images spanning a diverse taxonomy of 9 safety categories, providing
the first systematic resource for studying fine-grained image safety
distinctions.

TL;DR: NoisyGRPO是一个多模态强化学习框架，通过注入可控噪声到视觉输入来增强探索，并使用贝叶斯框架建模优势估计过程，以提升多模态大语言模型的链式思维推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习框架在提升通用链式思维推理时，往往难以泛化到训练分布之外，因此需要一种能够增强泛化能力和鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 1. 噪声注入探索策略：在视觉输入中加入高斯噪声，鼓励在更广泛的视觉场景中进行探索；2. 贝叶斯优势估计：将优势估计建模为贝叶斯推断问题，融合噪声水平和轨迹奖励信息来计算稳健的后验优势估计。

Conclusion: NoisyGRPO通过系统性的噪声注入和贝叶斯优势估计，有效提升了多模态大语言模型在强化学习环境中的泛化能力和推理鲁棒性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in enhancing the general
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language
models (MLLMs). However, when applied to improve general CoT reasoning,
existing RL frameworks often struggle to generalize beyond the training
distribution. To address this, we propose NoisyGRPO, a systematic multimodal RL
framework that introduces controllable noise into visual inputs for enhanced
exploration and explicitly models the advantage estimation process via a
Bayesian framework. Specifically, NoisyGRPO improves RL training by: (1)
\textbf{Noise-Injected Exploration Policy}: Perturbing visual inputs with
Gaussian noise to encourage exploration across a wider range of visual
scenarios; and (2) \textbf{Bayesian Advantage Estimation}: Formulating
advantage estimation as a principled Bayesian inference problem, where the
injected noise level serves as a prior and the observed trajectory reward as
the likelihood. This Bayesian modeling fuses both sources of information to
compute a robust posterior estimate of trajectory advantage, effectively
guiding MLLMs to prefer visually grounded trajectories over noisy ones.
Experiments on standard CoT quality, general capability, and hallucination
benchmarks demonstrate that NoisyGRPO substantially improves generalization and
robustness, especially in RL settings with small-scale MLLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL
3B. The project page is available at

Motivation: CTPA是诊断肺血管疾病的金标准，但依赖碘对比剂存在肾毒性和过敏反应风险，特别是在高危患者中。

Method: 使用基于CycleGAN的级联合成器，从NCCT扫描生成DCCTPA图像。研究收集了410对CTPA和NCCT扫描，在249对图像上进行训练和验证，161对作为测试集。

Result: 该方法在定量指标上表现最佳（验证集MAE:156.28，PSNR:20.71，SSIM:0.98；测试集MAE:165.12，PSNR:20.27，SSIM:0.98），在肺血管分割任务中Dice系数、clDice和clRecall均有显著提升，血管体积ICC从0.70提高到0.81。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效增强血管结构，特别是小血管，为减少对比剂使用提供了可行方案，在肺血管分割和量化任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is the reference standard
for diagnosing pulmonary vascular diseases such as Pulmonary Embolism (PE) and
Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension (CTEPH). However, its reliance on
iodinated contrast agents poses risks including nephrotoxicity and allergic
reactions, particularly in high-risk patients. This study proposes a method to
generate Digital Contrast CTPA (DCCTPA) from Non-Contrast CT (NCCT) scans using
a cascaded synthesizer based on Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial
Networks (CycleGAN). Totally retrospective 410 paired CTPA and NCCT scans were
obtained from three centers. The model was trained and validated internally on
249 paired images. Extra dataset that comprising 161 paired images was as test
set for model generalization evaluation and downstream clinical tasks
validation. Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, the proposed method
achieved the best comprehensive performance by evaluating quantitative metrics
(For validation, MAE: 156.28, PSNR: 20.71 and SSIM: 0.98; For test, MAE:
165.12, PSNR: 20.27 and SSIM: 0.98) and qualitative visualization,
demonstrating valid vessel enhancement, superior image fidelity and structural
preservation. The approach was further applied to downstream tasks of pulmonary
vessel segmentation and vascular quantification. On the test set, the average
Dice, clDice, and clRecall of artery and vein pulmonary segmentation was 0.70,
0.71, 0.73 and 0.70, 0.72, 0.75 respectively, all markedly improved compared
with NCCT inputs.\@ Inter-class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for vessel volume
between DCCTPA and CTPA was significantly better than that between NCCT and
CTPA (Average ICC : 0.81 vs 0.70), indicating effective vascular enhancement in
DCCTPA, especially for small vessels.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG)框架，通过网格化结构显式编码物体布局和空间关系，作为文本的补充通道来评估和提升基础模型的空间智能能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估视觉空间智能(VSI)的方法主要依赖纯文本提示和VQA式评分，这掩盖了几何信息、引入了语言捷径，且难以准确归因于真正的空间技能。

Method: 开发了SIG结构化网格模式，编码物体布局、物体间关系和物理基础先验，并基于SIG构建评估指标来量化模型的内在VSI能力。

Result: 在少样本上下文学习中，SIG相比纯VQA表示在所有VSI指标上产生更一致、更稳定和更全面的提升，表明其作为数据标注和训练模式的潜力。

Conclusion: SIG提供了一个忠实、组合式的场景结构表示，有助于分离空间能力与语言先验，并发布了SIGBench基准数据集支持机器和人类样VSI任务。

Abstract: How to integrate and verify spatial intelligence in foundation models remains
an open challenge. Current practice often proxies Visual-Spatial Intelligence
(VSI) with purely textual prompts and VQA-style scoring, which obscures
geometry, invites linguistic shortcuts, and weakens attribution to genuinely
spatial skills. We introduce Spatial Intelligence Grid (SIG): a structured,
grid-based schema that explicitly encodes object layouts, inter-object
relations, and physically grounded priors. As a complementary channel to text,
SIG provides a faithful, compositional representation of scene structure for
foundation-model reasoning. Building on SIG, we derive SIG-informed evaluation
metrics that quantify a model's intrinsic VSI, which separates spatial
capability from language priors. In few-shot in-context learning with
state-of-the-art multimodal LLMs (e.g. GPT- and Gemini-family models), SIG
yields consistently larger, more stable, and more comprehensive gains across
all VSI metrics compared to VQA-only representations, indicating its promise as
a data-labeling and training schema for learning VSI. We also release SIGBench,
a benchmark of 1.4K driving frames annotated with ground-truth SIG labels and
human gaze traces, supporting both grid-based machine VSI tasks and
attention-driven, human-like VSI tasks in autonomous-driving scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM)框架，将生成轨迹划分为多个时间段，每个段由专门的较小速度块建模，提高推理效率和样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Flow Matching模型使用单一大型网络学习从噪声到数据的整个生成轨迹，难以同时捕捉不同时间步的独特信号特征，且推理成本高昂。

Method: 1) 将生成轨迹划分为多个时间段的块状设计；2) 引入语义特征引导模块，使速度块基于预训练表示进行条件生成；3) 提出轻量级特征残差近似策略，在保持语义质量的同时降低推理成本。

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256上的实验表明，BFM相比现有Flow Matching方法建立了显著改进的帕累托前沿，在可比较的生成性能下实现了2.1倍到4.9倍的推理复杂度加速。

Conclusion: BFM通过块状设计和语义特征引导，有效解决了传统Flow Matching模型的局限性，在保持高质量生成的同时大幅提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Recently, Flow Matching models have pushed the boundaries of high-fidelity
data generation across a wide range of domains. It typically employs a single
large network to learn the entire generative trajectory from noise to data.
Despite their effectiveness, this design struggles to capture distinct signal
characteristics across timesteps simultaneously and incurs substantial
inference costs due to the iterative evaluation of the entire model. To address
these limitations, we propose Blockwise Flow Matching (BFM), a novel framework
that partitions the generative trajectory into multiple temporal segments, each
modeled by smaller but specialized velocity blocks. This blockwise design
enables each block to specialize effectively in its designated interval,
improving inference efficiency and sample quality. To further enhance
generation fidelity, we introduce a Semantic Feature Guidance module that
explicitly conditions velocity blocks on semantically rich features aligned
with pretrained representations. Additionally, we propose a lightweight Feature
Residual Approximation strategy that preserves semantic quality while
significantly reducing inference cost. Extensive experiments on ImageNet
256x256 demonstrate that BFM establishes a substantially improved Pareto
frontier over existing Flow Matching methods, achieving 2.1x to 4.9x
accelerations in inference complexity at comparable generation performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenCLIP是一个基于CLIP的token级自适应框架，通过动态视觉-文本空间对齐实现细粒度异常检测，解决了现有方法在单一文本空间中对齐不同对象和领域语义的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的异常检测方法通常使用单一文本空间来对齐视觉语义，这种无差别的对齐方式难以准确捕捉多样化的异常语义，限制了模型性能。

Method: 提出token级自适应框架，将token无关的文本空间扩展为一组正交子空间，通过最优传输问题动态分配每个token到语义相关的子空间组合，并使用top-k掩码稀疏化传输计划。

Result: 大量实验证明了TokenCLIP的优越性，在零样本异常检测任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: TokenCLIP通过动态token级对齐机制，实现了更精细的异常语义学习，为CLIP在异常检测领域的应用提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Adapting CLIP for anomaly detection on unseen objects has shown strong
potential in a zero-shot manner. However, existing methods typically rely on a
single textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and
domains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately
capturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise
adaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and
learnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping
all visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns
each token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual
characteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each
token is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We
instead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal
subspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination
guided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient
token-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an
optimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported
to textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of
OT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus
on different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that
adaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k
masking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for
distinct visual regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
TokenCLIP.

Result: KBE有效缓解了数据污染和饱和问题，提供了对MLLM能力的更全面评估。

Conclusion: KBE框架为多模态大语言模型提供了更可靠、动态的评估方法，解决了静态基准的局限性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more
reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the
potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or
misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply
Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the
formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic
multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static
benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming
the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially,
KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the
original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge.
It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of
question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the
risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive
assessment of MLLM capabilities.

Abstract: Shortcut models represent a promising, non-adversarial paradigm for
generative modeling, uniquely supporting one-step, few-step, and multi-step
sampling from a single trained network. However, their widespread adoption has
been stymied by critical performance bottlenecks. This paper tackles the five
core issues that held shortcut models back: (1) the hidden flaw of compounding
guidance, which we are the first to formalize, causing severe image artifacts;
(2) inflexible fixed guidance that restricts inference-time control; (3) a
pervasive frequency bias driven by a reliance on low-level distances in the
direct domain, which biases reconstructions toward low frequencies; (4)
divergent self-consistency arising from a conflict with EMA training; and (5)
curvy flow trajectories that impede convergence. To address these challenges,
we introduce iSM, a unified training framework that systematically resolves
each limitation. Our framework is built on four key improvements: Intrinsic
Guidance provides explicit, dynamic control over guidance strength, resolving
both compounding guidance and inflexibility. A Multi-Level Wavelet Loss
mitigates frequency bias to restore high-frequency details. Scaling Optimal
Transport (sOT) reduces training variance and learns straighter, more stable
generative paths. Finally, a Twin EMA strategy reconciles training stability
with self-consistency. Extensive experiments on ImageNet 256 x 256 demonstrate
that our approach yields substantial FID improvements over baseline shortcut
models across one-step, few-step, and multi-step generation, making shortcut
models a viable and competitive class of generative models.

TL;DR: TSSR是一种基于离散扩散模型的新型3D网格生成方法，能够并行生成高质量艺术家风格网格，支持高达10,000个面片和1024^3空间分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实现高精度token预测的同时支持并行生成，相比顺序自回归方法具有显著优势，通过让模型同时"看到"所有网格token来提升效率和可控性。

Method: 采用三个关键创新：1）解耦训练与混合推理，将生成过程分为拓扑雕刻和形状细化两个阶段；2）改进的Hourglass架构，配备双向注意力和面-顶点序列级旋转位置编码；3）新颖的连接损失函数作为拓扑约束。

Result: 在复杂数据集上的广泛实验表明，TSSR能够生成高质量的3D艺术家风格网格，达到10,000个面片和1024^3的空间分辨率。

Conclusion: TSSR通过并行生成和解耦策略，在3D网格生成任务中实现了高效且高质量的成果，为艺术家风格3D内容创作提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Topology Sculptor, Shape Refiner (TSSR), a novel
method for generating high-quality, artist-style 3D meshes based on Discrete
Diffusion Models (DDMs). Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly
accurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant
advantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to "see" all
mesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We
leverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)
Decoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the
DDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape
refinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture
both intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved
Hourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by
face-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby
capturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel
Connection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the
realism and fidelity of the generated meshes. Extensive experiments on complex
datasets demonstrate that TSSR generates high-quality 3D artist-style meshes,
capable of achieving up to 10,000 faces at a remarkable spatial resolution of
$1024^3$. The code will be released at:

TL;DR: SAGE-3D将3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)升级为可执行、语义和物理对齐的环境，通过对象中心语义标注和物理感知执行连接，构建了InteriorGS数据集和SAGE-Bench基准，在VLN任务上提升了31%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS虽然具有逼真的实时渲染能力，但缺乏细粒度语义和物理可执行性，限制了其在视觉语言导航(VLN)中的应用。

Method: 提出SAGE-3D框架，包含：(1)对象中心语义标注，为3DGS添加对象级细粒度注释；(2)物理感知执行连接，嵌入碰撞对象并构建丰富的物理接口。

Result: 创建了包含1K对象标注3DGS室内场景数据的InteriorGS数据集和首个基于3DGS的VLN基准SAGE-Bench(含2M VLN数据)。实验显示3DGS场景数据更难收敛但泛化性强，在VLN-CE Unseen任务上基线性能提升31%。

Conclusion: SAGE-3D成功将3DGS转化为语义和物理对齐的可执行环境，为VLN任务提供了更真实有效的训练和评估平台。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a 3D representation method with photorealistic
real-time rendering capabilities, is regarded as an effective tool for
narrowing the sim-to-real gap. However, it lacks fine-grained semantics and
physical executability for Visual-Language Navigation (VLN). To address this,
we propose SAGE-3D (Semantically and Physically Aligned Gaussian Environments
for 3D Navigation), a new paradigm that upgrades 3DGS into an executable,
semantically and physically aligned environment. It comprises two components:
(1) Object-Centric Semantic Grounding, which adds object-level fine-grained
annotations to 3DGS; and (2) Physics-Aware Execution Jointing, which embeds
collision objects into 3DGS and constructs rich physical interfaces. We release
InteriorGS, containing 1K object-annotated 3DGS indoor scene data, and
introduce SAGE-Bench, the first 3DGS-based VLN benchmark with 2M VLN data.
Experiments show that 3DGS scene data is more difficult to converge, while
exhibiting strong generalizability, improving baseline performance by 31% on
the VLN-CE Unseen task. The data and code will be available soon.

TL;DR: FineRS是一个两阶段的多模态大语言模型强化学习框架，用于在高分辨率场景中联合推理和分割极小的物体。它采用从粗到细的管道，包括全局语义探索和局部感知细化，通过定位信息回馈奖励来优化粗区域探索。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于输入分辨率受限，多模态大语言模型在理解高分辨率图像中的视觉细节和定位极小物体方面面临挑战，特别是在杂乱背景中。

Method: 两阶段框架：1) 全局语义探索进行指令引导推理生成文本响应和粗目标区域；2) 局部感知细化将粗区域细化为精确边界框和分割掩码。通过定位信息回馈奖励耦合两个阶段。

Result: 在FineRS-4k和公共数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法在指令引导分割和视觉推理任务上持续优于最先进的多模态大语言模型方法。

Conclusion: FineRS通过两阶段强化学习框架有效解决了高分辨率图像中极小物体的精确理解和定位问题，在推理和分割任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities
across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the restricted
input resolutions, MLLMs face significant challenges in precisely understanding
and localizing visual details in high-resolution images -- particularly when
dealing with extra-small objects embedded in cluttered contexts. To address
this issue, we propose \textsc{FineRS}, a two-stage MLLM-based reinforcement
learning framework for jointly reasoning and segmenting extremely small objects
within high-resolution scenes. \textsc{FineRS} adopts a coarse-to-fine pipeline
comprising Global Semantic Exploration (GSE) and Localized Perceptual
Refinement (LPR). Specifically, GSE performs instruction-guided reasoning to
generate a textural response and a coarse target region, while LPR refines this
region to produce an accurate bounding box and segmentation mask. To couple the
two stages, we introduce a locate-informed retrospective reward, where LPR's
outputs are used to optimize GSE for more robust coarse region exploration. %
Additionally, we present \textsc{FineRS}-4k, a new dataset for evaluating MLLMs
on attribute-level reasoning and pixel-level segmentation on subtle,
small-scale targets in complex high-resolution scenes. Experimental results on
\textsc{FineRS}-4k and public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art MLLM-based approaches on both instruction-guided
segmentation and visual reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于难以将多模态表示的语义映射到统一的概念集，视觉-语言对齐组件的可解释性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 提出VL-SAE稀疏自编码器，使用基于距离的编码器和两个模态特定解码器，通过余弦相似度测量多模态表示的语义相似度，并在自监督训练中鼓励语义相似表示具有一致的神经元激活。

Result: 在多个VLMs（如CLIP、LLaVA）上的实验表明，VL-SAE在解释和增强视觉-语言对齐方面具有优越能力，能够在下游任务（零样本图像分类和幻觉消除）中提升性能。

Conclusion: VL-SAE通过将视觉-语言表示对齐到概念层面，不仅增强了对齐的可解释性，还提升了多模态推理的性能。

Abstract: The alignment of vision-language representations endows current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with strong multi-modal reasoning capabilities.
However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated
due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations
into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a
sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden
activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept
represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting
these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the
neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations
to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.
First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we
perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,
we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific
decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar
representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)
demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the
vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and
language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with
concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning
vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to
performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image
classification and hallucination elimination. Codes are available at

<details>

Motivation: 当前计算框架仅限于二维表示，无法捕捉细胞形态在扰动下的复杂性，这限制了准确虚拟细胞模型的发展。

Method: FORM包含形态编码器（通过多通道VQGAN训练学习3D细胞形状表示）和基于扩散的扰动轨迹模块，在包含65,000多个3D细胞体积的大规模数据集上训练。

Result: FORM支持无条件形态合成和条件模拟扰动细胞状态，能够预测下游信号活性、模拟组合扰动效应，并建模未见扰动的形态动态转变。

Conclusion: FORM和MorphoEval通过高分辨率预测模拟，将形态、扰动和功能联系起来，推动3D虚拟细胞的实现。

Abstract: Understanding how cells respond to external stimuli is a central challenge in
biomedical research and drug development. Current computational frameworks for
modelling cellular responses remain restricted to two-dimensional
representations, limiting their capacity to capture the complexity of cell
morphology under perturbation. This dimensional constraint poses a critical
bottleneck for the development of accurate virtual cell models. Here, we
present FORM, a machine learning framework for predicting perturbation-induced
changes in three-dimensional cellular structure. FORM consists of two
components: a morphology encoder, trained end-to-end via a novel multi-channel
VQGAN to learn compact 3D representations of cell shape, and a diffusion-based
perturbation trajectory module that captures how morphology evolves across
perturbation conditions. Trained on a large-scale dataset of over 65,000
multi-fluorescence 3D cell volumes spanning diverse chemical and genetic
perturbations, FORM supports both unconditional morphology synthesis and
conditional simulation of perturbed cell states. Beyond generation, FORM can
predict downstream signalling activity, simulate combinatorial perturbation
effects, and model morphodynamic transitions between states of unseen
perturbations. To evaluate performance, we introduce MorphoEval, a benchmarking
suite that quantifies perturbation-induced morphological changes in structural,
statistical, and biological dimensions. Together, FORM and MorphoEval work
toward the realisation of the 3D virtual cell by linking morphology,
perturbation, and function through high-resolution predictive simulation.

Motivation: 传统多尺度特征融合方法在复杂果园环境中难以应对苹果叶部病害的表型异质性，这些方法仅整合CNN提取的多层特征，未能充分考虑局部与全局特征之间的关系。

Method: 1. 多分支识别框架CT-CLIP：CNN提取局部病变细节特征，Vision Transformer捕获全局结构关系；2. 自适应特征融合模块（AFFM）动态融合局部和全局特征；3. 多模态图像-文本学习方法，利用预训练CLIP权重实现视觉特征与病害语义描述的深度对齐。

Conclusion: CT-CLIP在农业病害识别方面表现出强大能力，为农业应用中的自动化病害识别提供了创新实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In complex orchard environments, the phenotypic heterogeneity of different
apple leaf diseases, characterized by significant variation among lesions,
poses a challenge to traditional multi-scale feature fusion methods. These
methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between
local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch
recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework
synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a
Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive
Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving
optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the
diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate
interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition
accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text
learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep
alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions.
Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12%
on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming
several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities
in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification
accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and
practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural
applications.

Abstract: UAV tracking can be widely applied in scenarios such as disaster rescue,
environmental monitoring, and logistics transportation. However, existing UAV
tracking methods predominantly emphasize speed and lack exploration in semantic
awareness, which hinders the search region from extracting accurate
localization information from the template. The limitation results in
suboptimal performance under typical UAV tracking challenges such as camera
motion, fast motion, and low resolution, etc. To address this issue, we propose
a dynamic semantic aware correlation modeling tracking framework. The core of
our framework is a Dynamic Semantic Relevance Generator, which, in combination
with the correlation map from the Transformer, explore semantic relevance. The
approach enhances the search region's ability to extract important information
from the template, improving accuracy and robustness under the aforementioned
challenges. Additionally, to enhance the tracking speed, we design a pruning
method for the proposed framework. Therefore, we present multiple model
variants that achieve trade-offs between speed and accuracy, enabling flexible
deployment according to the available computational resources. Experimental
results validate the effectiveness of our method, achieving competitive
performance on multiple UAV tracking datasets. The code is available at

Conclusion: 该工作为使用人类注视增强VLM在现实场景（如辅助机器人和人机协作）中的预测能力奠定了基础

Abstract: Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future
actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this
work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key
egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and
current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on
visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze
only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that
aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular,
allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize
attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic
prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for
current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models
trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of
gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric
VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to
enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like
assistive robots and human-machine collaboration. Code and additional

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的合成CT生成管道，使用2.5D U-Net++架构，结合IMPACT-Synth感知损失和两种配准策略（Elastix和IMPACT），在SynthRAD2025挑战赛中展示了改进的解剖结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统基于互信息的配准方法在合成CT生成中存在的解剖结构不一致问题，开发更稳健和可泛化的合成CT合成模型。

Method: 使用2.5D U-Net++架构，ResNet-34编码器，联合训练各解剖区域并进行区域微调。损失函数结合像素级L1损失和IMPACT-Synth感知损失。评估两种配准策略：Elastix（互信息）和IMPACT（基于特征的相似性度量）。

Result: 在本地测试集上，基于IMPACT的配准实现了更准确和解剖一致的配准，降低了MAE并产生更真实的解剖结构。但在公共验证集上，使用Elastix配准数据的模型得分更高，反映了配准偏差。

Conclusion: 配准误差会传播到监督学习中，影响训练和评估。IMPACT通过促进解剖一致的配准，有助于减轻这种偏差，支持开发更稳健的合成CT合成模型。

Abstract: We participated in the SynthRAD2025 challenge (Tasks 1 and 2) with a unified
pipeline for synthetic CT (sCT) generation from MRI and CBCT, implemented using
the KonfAI framework. Our model is a 2.5D U-Net++ with a ResNet-34 encoder,
trained jointly across anatomical regions and fine-tuned per region. The loss
function combined pixel-wise L1 loss with IMPACT-Synth, a perceptual loss
derived from SAM and TotalSegmentator to enhance structural fidelity. Training
was performed using AdamW (initial learning rate = 0.001, halved every 25k
steps) on patch-based, normalized, body-masked inputs (320x320 for MRI, 256x256
for CBCT), with random flipping as the only augmentation. No post-processing
was applied. Final predictions leveraged test-time augmentation and five-fold
ensembling. The best model was selected based on validation MAE. Two
registration strategies were evaluated: (i) Elastix with mutual information,
consistent with the challenge pipeline, and (ii) IMPACT, a feature-based
similarity metric leveraging pretrained segmentation networks. On the local
test sets, IMPACT-based registration achieved more accurate and anatomically
consistent alignments than mutual-information-based registration, resulting in
improved sCT synthesis with lower MAE and more realistic anatomical structures.
On the public validation set, however, models trained with Elastix-aligned data
achieved higher scores, reflecting a registration bias favoring alignment
strategies consistent with the evaluation pipeline. This highlights how
registration errors can propagate into supervised learning, influencing both
training and evaluation, and potentially inflating performance metrics at the
expense of anatomical fidelity. By promoting anatomically consistent alignment,
IMPACT helps mitigate this bias and supports the development of more robust and
generalizable sCT synthesis models.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型采用固定去噪步数生成高保真图像，但在云到设备场景中，有限带宽常需重度压缩，导致纹理细节丢失和计算浪费。需要一种能根据传输条件自适应调整生成质量的方法。

Result: 实验结果表明，相比简单的早期停止方法，该方法显著提高了带宽适应生成的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 该方法为带宽受限环境中的高效图像传输提供了有前景的解决方案，仅需最小架构修改。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enable diffusion models to
adapt their generation quality based on real-time network bandwidth
constraints. Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by
performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream
transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,
limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine
textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint
end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a
target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the
model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop
sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target
transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and
leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the
visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive
early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in
bandwidth-constrained environments. Code is available at:

Abstract: Remote sensing vision tasks require extensive labeled data across multiple,
interconnected domains. However, current generative data augmentation
frameworks are task-isolated, i.e., each vision task requires training an
independent generative model, and ignores the modeling of geographical
information and spatial constraints. To address these issues, we propose
\textbf{TerraGen}, a unified layout-to-image generation framework that enables
flexible, spatially controllable synthesis of remote sensing imagery for
various high-level vision tasks, e.g., detection, segmentation, and extraction.
Specifically, TerraGen introduces a geographic-spatial layout encoder that
unifies bounding box and segmentation mask inputs, combined with a multi-scale
injection scheme and mask-weighted loss to explicitly encode spatial
constraints, from global structures to fine details. Also, we construct the
first large-scale multi-task remote sensing layout generation dataset
containing 45k images and establish a standardized evaluation protocol for this
task. Experimental results show that our TerraGen can achieve the best
generation image quality across diverse tasks. Additionally, TerraGen can be
used as a universal data-augmentation generator, enhancing downstream task
performance significantly and demonstrating robust cross-task generalisation in
both full-data and few-shot scenarios.

Abstract: Image stitching synthesizes images captured from multiple perspectives into a
single image with a broader field of view. The significant variations in object
depth often lead to large parallax, resulting in ghosting and misalignment in
the stitched results. To address this, we propose a
depth-consistency-constrained seamless-free image stitching method. First, to
tackle the multi-view alignment difficulties caused by parallax, a multi-stage
mechanism combined with global depth regularization constraints is developed to
enhance the alignment accuracy of the same apparent target across different
depth ranges. Second, during the multi-view image fusion process, an optimal
stitching seam is determined through graph-based low-cost computation, and a
soft-seam region is diffused to precisely locate transition areas, thereby
effectively mitigating alignment errors induced by parallax and achieving
natural and seamless stitching results. Furthermore, considering the
computational overhead in the shift regression process, a reparameterization
strategy is incorporated to optimize the structural design, significantly
improving algorithm efficiency while maintaining optimal performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method against
the existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/DLUT-YRH/DSFN.

Abstract: We propose the Multi-modal Untrimmed Video Retrieval task, along with a new
benchmark (MUVR) to advance video retrieval for long-video platforms. MUVR aims
to retrieve untrimmed videos containing relevant segments using multi-modal
queries. It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR
supports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval
needs through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It
adopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,
tailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual
correspondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)
and precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level
visual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel
locations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It
covers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)
Comprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,
Filter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA
assesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking
Score to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K
untrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal
queries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video
retrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals
the limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and
multi-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and
reranking. Our code and benchmark is available at
https://github.com/debby-0527/MUVR.

*Whie Jung,Semin Kim,Junee Kim,Seunghoon Hong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的视觉概念学习框架，能够自适应识别图像相关的概念轴并在真实场景中沿这些轴进行视觉概念定位，无需预定义概念轴，在多个真实数据集上展现出优秀的编辑能力和组合泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于语言的视觉概念学习方法仅限于少数预定义的基本轴（如颜色和形状），且通常在合成数据集上探索，无法适应真实世界中丰富多样的语义维度。

Method: 利用预训练的视觉语言模型和通用提示策略识别多样化的图像相关轴；通过通用概念编码器自适应地将视觉特征绑定到发现的轴上；优化组合锚定目标确保每个轴可独立操作而不影响其他轴。

Result: 在ImageNet、CelebA-HQ和AFHQ数据集上展示了卓越的编辑能力，能够处理过于多样化而无法手动预定义的真实世界概念，在组合泛化方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为语言引导的视觉概念学习提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，能够自适应地发现和操作真实世界图像中的多样化概念轴，具有强大的组合泛化能力。

Abstract: Human intelligence effortlessly interprets visual scenes along a rich
spectrum of semantic dimensions. However, existing approaches to
language-grounded visual concept learning are limited to a few predefined
primitive axes, such as color and shape, and are typically explored in
synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a scalable framework that
adaptively identifies image-related concept axes and grounds visual concepts
along these axes in real-world scenes. Leveraging a pretrained vision-language
model and our universal prompting strategy, our framework identifies a diverse
image-related axes without any prior knowledge. Our universal concept encoder
adaptively binds visual features to the discovered axes without introducing
additional model parameters for each concept. To ground visual concepts along
the discovered axes, we optimize a compositional anchoring objective, which
ensures that each axis can be independently manipulated without affecting
others. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on subsets of
ImageNet, CelebA-HQ, and AFHQ, showcasing superior editing capabilities across
diverse real-world concepts that are too varied to be manually predefined. Our
method also exhibits strong compositional generalization, outperforming
existing visual concept learning and text-based editing methods. The code is
available at https://github.com/whieya/Language-grounded-VCL.

Motivation: 现有方法在合成关节化3D物体时难以同时保证几何一致性、关节准确性和外观真实性，特别是在处理关节依赖的可见性变化方面存在局限。

Method: 使用变分自编码器将稀疏体素表示和关节属性嵌入统一潜在空间，训练潜在扩散模型进行多样化采样，并引入关节感知的高斯解码器处理关节状态相关的可见性变化。

Conclusion: 该框架为关节化3D物体的合成和操作提供了可扩展的解决方案，显著提升了跨关节配置的视觉真实感。

Abstract: We propose ArtiLatent, a generative framework that synthesizes human-made 3D
objects with fine-grained geometry, accurate articulation, and realistic
appearance. Our approach jointly models part geometry and articulation dynamics
by embedding sparse voxel representations and associated articulation
properties, including joint type, axis, origin, range, and part category, into
a unified latent space via a variational autoencoder. A latent diffusion model
is then trained over this space to enable diverse yet physically plausible
sampling. To reconstruct photorealistic 3D shapes, we introduce an
articulation-aware Gaussian decoder that accounts for articulation-dependent
visibility changes (e.g., revealing the interior of a drawer when opened). By
conditioning appearance decoding on articulation state, our method assigns
plausible texture features to regions that are typically occluded in static
poses, significantly improving visual realism across articulation
configurations. Extensive experiments on furniture-like objects from
PartNet-Mobility and ACD datasets demonstrate that ArtiLatent outperforms
existing approaches in geometric consistency and appearance fidelity. Our
framework provides a scalable solution for articulated 3D object synthesis and
manipulation.

*Xi Zhang,Xiaolin Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种各向异性池化方法，用于改进基于查找表(LUT)的图像恢复CNN方法，通过广义中值池化和学习数据依赖的池化系数来替代传统的平均池化，从而更好地处理各向异性信号结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LUT实现CNN方法使用平均池化来融合不同方向的像素块结果，但这种方法不适合处理各向异性信号结构，导致性能受限。

Method: 1. 引入广义中值池化方法；2. 扩展该方法，学习数据依赖的池化系数，使不同方向的像素块贡献能够自适应加权。

Result: 在各种恢复基准测试上的实验结果表明，所提出的各向异性池化策略在感知质量和数值指标上都优于现有的LUT可实现的CNN方法。

Conclusion: 各向异性池化策略能够有效提升LUT实现CNN图像恢复方法的性能，通过自适应加权不同方向的像素块贡献来更好地处理各向异性信号结构。

Abstract: Table look-up realization of image restoration CNNs has the potential of
achieving competitive image quality while being much faster and resource frugal
than the straightforward CNN implementation. The main technical challenge
facing the LUT-based CNN algorithm designers is to manage the table size
without overly restricting the receptive field. The prevailing strategy is to
reuse the table for small pixel patches of different orientations (apparently
assuming a degree of isotropy) and then fuse the look-up results. The fusion is
currently done by average pooling, which we find being ill suited to
anisotropic signal structures. To alleviate the problem, we investigate and
discuss anisotropic pooling methods to replace naive averaging for improving
the performance of the current LUT-realizable CNN restoration methods. First,
we introduce the method of generalized median pooling which leads to measurable
gains over average pooling. We then extend this idea by learning data-dependent
pooling coefficients for each orientation, so that they can adaptively weigh
the contributions of differently oriented pixel patches. Experimental results
on various restoration benchmarks show that our anisotropic pooling strategy
yields both perceptually and numerically superior results compared to existing
LUT-realizable CNN methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的显式建模层次结构的方法存在显著限制：要么需要多次渲染来捕捉不同粒度级别的嵌入，显著增加推理时间；要么依赖预定义的封闭离散层次结构，对现实世界中多样和细微结构的泛化能力差。

Method: 使用连续双曲潜在空间表示场景层次结构，利用双曲几何的特性自然编码多尺度关系，并通过潜在空间中的测地线路径实现层次结构的平滑遍历。

Result: 在标准基准测试中优于最先进的方法，在3D场景理解方面展现出卓越的效率和适应性。

Conclusion: OpenHype通过连续双曲潜在空间有效解决了3D场景层次结构建模的挑战，为自主代理提供了更全面的环境理解能力。

Abstract: Modeling the inherent hierarchical structure of 3D objects and 3D scenes is
highly desirable, as it enables a more holistic understanding of environments
for autonomous agents. Accomplishing this with implicit representations, such
as Neural Radiance Fields, remains an unexplored challenge. Existing methods
that explicitly model hierarchical structures often face significant
limitations: they either require multiple rendering passes to capture
embeddings at different levels of granularity, significantly increasing
inference time, or rely on predefined, closed-set discrete hierarchies that
generalize poorly to the diverse and nuanced structures encountered by agents
in the real world. To address these challenges, we propose OpenHype, a novel
approach that represents scene hierarchies using a continuous hyperbolic latent
space. By leveraging the properties of hyperbolic geometry, OpenHype naturally
encodes multi-scale relationships and enables smooth traversal of hierarchies
through geodesic paths in latent space. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches on standard benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency and
adaptability in 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel
interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while
enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art
method, i.e., PhysTwin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频异常检测研究主要关注离线场景，而在线VAD由于实时性约束和计算强度很少受到关注。本文旨在解决在线VAD的固有复杂性，利用预训练大模型的潜力实现更细致的异常理解。

Method: MoniTor采用流式输入到视觉语言模型，结合LSTM启发的预测机制来捕捉时间依赖性，设计评分队列和异常先验来动态存储最近分数并覆盖监控场景中的所有异常。

Result: 在UCF-Crime和XD-Violence两个大型数据集上的评估表明，MoniTor优于最先进方法，且无需训练即可与弱监督方法竞争。

Conclusion: MoniTor为在线视频异常检测提供了一种有效的训练免费解决方案，通过结合预训练模型和时序建模能力，在实时监控场景中实现了优异的异常检测性能。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to locate unusual activities or behaviors
within videos. Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research
attention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models
(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more
nuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received
attention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this
paper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for
Training-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online
VAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the
capabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal
dependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism
inspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can
effectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify
anomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.
Moreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store
recent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing
guidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over
time. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and
XD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios. The
results demonstrate that MoniTor outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is
competitive with weakly supervised methods without training. Code is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VidSplice是一个新颖的视频修复框架，通过解耦视频修复为两个子任务：多帧一致的图像修复和掩码区域运动传播，引入间隔帧先验来指导修复过程，显著提升了时空稳定性和内容一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法在严重内容退化情况下表现不佳，且往往忽视时空稳定性，导致对视频后段内容的控制不足。需要解决这些限制来提升修复质量。

Method: 1. 将视频修复解耦为多帧一致图像修复和掩码区域运动传播两个子任务；2. 设计CoSpliced模块实现首帧传播策略；3. 引入上下文控制器模块编码相干先验并注入到I2V生成主干中。

Result: 广泛评估表明VidSplice在多样化视频修复场景中实现了有竞争力的性能，显著改善了前景对齐和运动稳定性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VidSplice通过间隔帧先验和创新的模块设计，有效解决了视频修复中的时空一致性问题，为复杂场景下的视频修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent video inpainting methods often employ image-to-video (I2V) priors to
model temporal consistency across masked frames. While effective in moderate
cases, these methods struggle under severe content degradation and tend to
overlook spatiotemporal stability, resulting in insufficient control over the
latter parts of the video. To address these limitations, we decouple video
inpainting into two sub-tasks: multi-frame consistent image inpainting and
masked area motion propagation. We propose VidSplice, a novel framework that
introduces spaced-frame priors to guide the inpainting process with
spatiotemporal cues. To enhance spatial coherence, we design a CoSpliced Module
to perform first-frame propagation strategy that diffuses the initial frame
content into subsequent reference frames through a splicing mechanism.
Additionally, we introduce a delicate context controller module that encodes
coherent priors after frame duplication and injects the spliced video into the
I2V generative backbone, effectively constraining content distortion during
generation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that VidSplice achieves
competitive performance across diverse video inpainting scenarios. Moreover,
its design significantly improves both foreground alignment and motion
stability, outperforming existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在胸部X光诊断中准确性高，但由于其黑盒性质限制了临床采用。临床医生需要透明、可验证的解释来信任自动化诊断并识别潜在故障模式。

Method: 在BiomedCLIP诊断分类器上训练基于转码器的稀疏自编码器，将医学图像表示分解为可解释的视觉模式。在MIMIC-CXR数据集上训练100个转码器集成，发现约5000个单语义模式。

Result: 发现了涵盖心脏、肺部、胸膜、结构、设备和伪影类别的约5000个单语义模式。每个模式在共享特定放射学特征的图像中表现出一致的激活行为，预测可分解为20-50个可解释模式。在五个关键发现上实现了竞争性诊断准确性。

Conclusion: CXR-LanIC证明了医疗AI系统可以既准确又可解释，通过从特定诊断目标训练的分类器中提取可解释特征，确保发现的模式与临床决策直接相关，支持通过透明、临床基础的解释实现更安全的临床部署。

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved remarkable accuracy in chest X-ray
diagnosis, yet their widespread clinical adoption remains limited by the
black-box nature of their predictions. Clinicians require transparent,
verifiable explanations to trust automated diagnoses and identify potential
failure modes. We introduce CXR-LanIC (Language-Grounded Interpretable
Classifier for Chest X-rays), a novel framework that addresses this
interpretability challenge through task-aligned pattern discovery. Our approach
trains transcoder-based sparse autoencoders on a BiomedCLIP diagnostic
classifier to decompose medical image representations into interpretable visual
patterns. By training an ensemble of 100 transcoders on multimodal embeddings
from the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we discover approximately 5,000 monosemantic
patterns spanning cardiac, pulmonary, pleural, structural, device, and artifact
categories. Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images
sharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where
predictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable
activation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on
five key findings while providing the foundation for natural language
explanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key
innovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained
on specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,
ensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,
demonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,
supporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded
explanations.

Result: 在四个组织病理学亚型分类基准测试中，所提方法优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 细胞级聚合和组织-细胞交互在细粒度计算病理学中发挥着关键作用。

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of histopathological images demands integration of
information across spatial and semantic scales, from nuclear morphology and
cellular textures to global tissue organization and disease-specific patterns.
Although recent foundation models in pathology have shown strong capabilities
in capturing global tissue context, their omission of cell-level feature
modeling remains a key limitation for fine-grained tasks such as cancer subtype
classification. To address this, we propose a dual-stream architecture that
models the interplay between macroscale tissue features and aggregated cellular
representations. To efficiently aggregate information from large cell sets, we
propose a receptance-weighted key-value aggregation model, a recurrent
transformer that captures inter-cell dependencies with linear complexity.
Furthermore, we introduce a bidirectional tissue-cell interaction module to
enable mutual attention between localized cellular cues and their surrounding
tissue environment. Experiments on four histopathological subtype
classification benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing
models, demonstrating the critical role of cell-level aggregation and
tissue-cell interaction in fine-grained computational pathology.

Abstract: GRAP-MOT is a new approach for solving the person MOT problem dedicated to
videos of closed areas with overlapping multi-camera views, where person
occlusion frequently occurs. Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a
person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's
characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all
elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and
community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position
estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method,
ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT
on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real
datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the
superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to
compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in
such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly

Abstract: Placental abruption is a severe complication during pregnancy, and its early
accurate diagnosis is crucial for ensuring maternal and fetal safety.
Traditional ultrasound diagnostic methods heavily rely on physician experience,
leading to issues such as subjective bias and diagnostic inconsistencies. This
paper proposes an improved model, EH-YOLOv11n (Enhanced Hemorrhage-YOLOv11n),
based on small-sample learning, aiming to achieve automatic detection of
hematoma features in placental ultrasound images. The model enhances
performance through multidimensional optimization: it integrates wavelet
convolution and coordinate convolution to strengthen frequency and spatial
feature extraction; incorporates a cascaded group attention mechanism to
suppress ultrasound artifacts and occlusion interference, thereby improving
bounding box localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate a
detection accuracy of 78%, representing a 2.5% improvement over YOLOv11n and a
13.7% increase over YOLOv8. The model exhibits significant superiority in

Abstract: Vision encoders are indispensable for allowing impressive performance of
Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in vision language tasks such as
visual question answering and reasoning. However, existing vision encoders
focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional
analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of
fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training
paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that
integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large
Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first
construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired
with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large
scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a
pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to
train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the
fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption
regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in
the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision
feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further
incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization
constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning
capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision
encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it
achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA,
and OCR understanding.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一视角，将条件引导重新定义为不动点迭代，并引入了Foresight Guidance (FSG)方法，在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题以提高效率和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)方法基于不同的理论解释，限制了设计空间并模糊了关键设计选择。需要统一的视角来理解其运作机制。

Method: 将条件引导重新定义为不动点迭代，寻找潜在空间中的黄金路径。提出Foresight Guidance (FSG)，在早期扩散阶段优先解决长间隔子问题并增加迭代次数。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型架构上的实验验证了FSG在图像质量和计算效率方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作为条件引导提供了新的视角，并释放了自适应设计的潜力。

Abstract: Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is an essential component of text-to-image
diffusion models, and understanding and advancing its operational mechanisms
remains a central focus of research. Existing approaches stem from divergent
theoretical interpretations, thereby limiting the design space and obscuring
key design choices. To address this, we propose a unified perspective that
reframes conditional guidance as fixed point iterations, seeking to identify a
golden path where latents produce consistent outputs under both conditional and
unconditional generation. We demonstrate that CFG and its variants constitute a
special case of single-step short-interval iteration, which is theoretically
proven to exhibit inefficiency. To this end, we introduce Foresight Guidance
(FSG), which prioritizes solving longer-interval subproblems in early diffusion
stages with increased iterations. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets
and model architectures validate the superiority of FSG over state-of-the-art
methods in both image quality and computational efficiency. Our work offers
novel perspectives for conditional guidance and unlocks the potential of
adaptive design.

*Lorenzo Basile,Valentino Maiorca,Diego Doimo,Francesco Locatello,Alberto Cazzaniga*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信号处理的注意力头分析方法，能够识别文本生成模型中专门处理特定语义或视觉属性的注意力头，并通过编辑少量头部（仅1%）来可靠地控制模型输出中的目标概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语言和视觉语言模型在各种任务中表现出色，但其内部机制仍不完全清楚。本研究旨在理解注意力头如何专门处理特定语义或视觉属性，为模型的可解释性和可控性提供工具。

Method: 基于已有的可解释性方法，通过信号处理视角重新解释用最终解码层探测中间激活的实践，能够以原则性方式分析多个样本，并根据注意力头与目标概念的相关性进行排序。

Result: 研究发现在单模态和多模态transformer中，注意力头层面存在一致的专业化模式。通过该方法选择的仅1%的注意力头进行编辑，就能可靠地抑制或增强模型输出中的目标概念。在问答、毒性缓解等语言任务以及图像分类、图像描述等视觉语言任务上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 注意力层中存在可解释和可控的结构，为理解和编辑大规模生成模型提供了简单工具。

Abstract: Language and vision-language models have shown impressive performance across
a wide range of tasks, but their internal mechanisms remain only partly
understood. In this work, we study how individual attention heads in
text-generative models specialize in specific semantic or visual attributes.
Building on an established interpretability method, we reinterpret the practice
of probing intermediate activations with the final decoding layer through the
lens of signal processing. This lets us analyze multiple samples in a
principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target
concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head
level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find
that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably
suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our
approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation,
as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning.
Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within
attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing
large-scale generative models.

*Ciara Rowles,Varun Jampani,Simon Donné,Shimon Vainer,Julian Parker,Zach Evans*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Foley Control是一种轻量级视频引导Foley方法，通过冻结预训练的单模态模型，仅学习它们之间的小型交叉注意力桥接来实现视频到音频的同步生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要端到端重新训练多模态系统，计算成本高且缺乏模块化。Foley Control旨在保持预训练模型强大性能的同时，通过最小化训练参数实现视频-音频同步。

Method: 连接V-JEPA2视频嵌入到冻结的Stable Audio Open DiT文本到音频模型，在现有文本交叉注意力后插入紧凑的视频交叉注意力，通过池化视频token减少内存需求并稳定训练。

Result: 在视频-音频基准测试中，Foley Control以更少的可训练参数实现了竞争性的时间和语义对齐，同时保持了提示驱动的可控性和生产友好的模块化。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、模块化的视频引导Foley解决方案，其桥接设计可扩展到其他音频模态如语音生成。

Abstract: Foley Control is a lightweight approach to video-guided Foley that keeps
pretrained single-modality models frozen and learns only a small
cross-attention bridge between them. We connect V-JEPA2 video embeddings to a
frozen Stable Audio Open DiT text-to-audio (T2A) model by inserting compact
video cross-attention after the model's existing text cross-attention, so
prompts set global semantics while video refines timing and local dynamics. The
frozen backbones retain strong marginals (video; audio given text) and the
bridge learns the audio-video dependency needed for synchronization -- without
retraining the audio prior. To cut memory and stabilize training, we pool video
tokens before conditioning. On curated video-audio benchmarks, Foley Control
delivers competitive temporal and semantic alignment with far fewer trainable
parameters than recent multi-modal systems, while preserving prompt-driven
controllability and production-friendly modularity (swap/upgrade encoders or
the T2A backbone without end-to-end retraining). Although we focus on
Video-to-Foley, the same bridge design can potentially extend to other audio
modalities (e.g., speech).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Chunk-GRPO方法，通过将优化范式从步骤级转移到块级来解决GRPO在文本到图像生成中的优势归因不准确和忽略生成时序动态的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在基于流匹配的文本到图像生成中表现出强大潜力，但面临两个关键限制：优势归因不准确，以及忽略生成的时序动态。

Method: 提出Chunk-GRPO方法，将连续步骤分组为捕捉流匹配内在时序动态的'块'，在块级别优化策略，并引入可选的加权采样策略来进一步提升性能。

Result: 大量实验表明，Chunk-GRPO在偏好对齐和图像质量方面都取得了优越的结果。

Conclusion: 块级优化为基于GRPO的方法展示了良好前景。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has shown strong potential for
flow-matching-based text-to-image (T2I) generation, but it faces two key
limitations: inaccurate advantage attribution, and the neglect of temporal
dynamics of generation. In this work, we argue that shifting the optimization
paradigm from the step level to the chunk level can effectively alleviate these
issues. Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level
GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive
steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of
flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we
introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that ChunkGRPO achieves superior
results in both preference alignment and image quality, highlighting the
promise of chunk-level optimization for GRPO-based methods.

*Xuzhao Li,Xuchen Li,Shiyu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATrack是一个专为夜间无人机跟踪设计的多尺度自适应系统，通过三个核心模块解决夜间跟踪的技术挑战，在UAVDark135基准测试中性能显著优于现有方法，同时保持81 FPS的实时处理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间无人机跟踪面临低光照条件、杂乱背景和频繁视角变化等挑战，现有基于低光增强和域适应的方法在实际系统中存在视觉伪影、计算成本高和无法充分利用动态对象信息等问题。

Method: MATrack包含三个核心模块：多尺度层次混合(MHB)增强静态和动态模板间的特征一致性，自适应关键令牌门准确识别复杂背景中的对象信息，夜间模板校准器(NTC)确保长序列中的稳定跟踪性能。

Result: 在UAVDark135基准测试中，MATrack的精度、归一化精度和AUC分别比最先进方法提高了5.9%、5.4%和4.2%，处理速度达到81 FPS。真实无人机平台测试验证了系统的可靠性。

Conclusion: MATrack能够为夜间搜救和边境巡逻等关键机器人应用提供稳定有效的夜间无人机跟踪支持。

Abstract: Nighttime UAV tracking faces significant challenges in real-world robotics
operations. Low-light conditions not only limit visual perception capabilities,
but cluttered backgrounds and frequent viewpoint changes also cause existing
trackers to drift or fail during deployment. To address these difficulties,
researchers have proposed solutions based on low-light enhancement and domain
adaptation. However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual
UAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain
adaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight
designs struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an
in-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive
system designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking. MATrack tackles the
main technical challenges of nighttime tracking through the collaborative work
of three core modules: Multiscale Hierarchy Blende (MHB) enhances feature
consistency between static and dynamic templates. Adaptive Key Token Gate
accurately identifies object information within complex backgrounds. Nighttime
Template Calibrator (NTC) ensures stable tracking performance over long
sequences. Extensive experiments show that MATrack achieves a significant
performance improvement. On the UAVDark135 benchmark, its precision, normalized
precision and AUC surpass state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 5.9%, 5.4% and
4.2% respectively, while maintaining a real-time processing speed of 81 FPS.
Further tests on a real-world UAV platform validate the system's reliability,
demonstrating that MATrack can provide stable and effective nighttime UAV
tracking support for critical robotics applications such as nighttime search
and rescue and border patrol.

TL;DR: TIGER是一个两阶段文本图像超分辨率框架，通过"文本优先、图像后处理"范式，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升文本可读性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式超分辨率方法在自然图像上表现良好，但会扭曲文本内容，导致图像质量和文本可读性之间的根本权衡问题。

Method: 采用两阶段框架：第一阶段明确重建精确的文本结构，第二阶段使用文本结构指导后续全图像超分辨率，实现字形到图像的引导。

Result: TIGER实现了最先进的性能，在提升可读性的同时保持整体图像质量，并贡献了首个极端缩放场景文本数据集UltraZoom-ST。

Conclusion: TIGER通过解耦字形恢复和图像增强，成功打破了图像质量与文本可读性之间的权衡，为文本图像超分辨率提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current generative super-resolution methods show strong performance on
natural images but distort text, creating a fundamental trade-off between image
quality and textual readability. To address this, we introduce \textbf{TIGER}
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{I}mage \textbf{G}uided
sup\textbf{E}r-\textbf{R}esolution), a novel two-stage framework that breaks
this trade-off through a \textit{"text-first, image-later"} paradigm.
\textbf{TIGER} explicitly decouples glyph restoration from image enhancement:
it first reconstructs precise text structures and then uses them to guide
subsequent full-image super-resolution. This glyph-to-image guidance ensures
both high fidelity and visual consistency. To support comprehensive training
and evaluation, we also contribute the \textbf{UltraZoom-ST} (UltraZoom-Scene
Text), the first scene text dataset with extreme zoom (\textbf{$\times$14.29}).
Extensive experiments show that \textbf{TIGER} achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} performance, enhancing readability while preserving
overall image quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了基于深度学习的方法来自动检测MEG记录中的发作间期癫痫尖波，提出了两种神经网络架构（ANN和CNN），并通过交互式机器学习策略提高数据标注质量，在10名测试患者中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 药物难治性癫痫的术前评估需要准确定位癫痫灶，MEG中的发作间期癫痫尖波是重要生物标志物。但手动检测这些尖波既繁琐又容易出错，现有自动化方法要么需要大量标注数据，要么在非典型数据上缺乏鲁棒性，不适合临床应用。

Method: 提出了两种深度学习模型架构：基于特征的人工神经网络（ANN）和卷积神经网络（CNN），在59名患者数据库上训练。采用交互式机器学习策略迭代改进数据标注质量，使用中间模型输出来优化标注。

Result: 在10名测试患者上，两种模型都优于现有最先进模型（F1分数：CNN=0.46，ANN=0.44）。交互式机器学习策略表明模型对噪声标注具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 简单架构的模型在分析复杂且标注不完美的数据时表现出鲁棒性。交互式机器学习方法具有加速数据标注的潜力，所提出的模型是自动检测发作间期癫痫尖波的有效工具。

Abstract: In drug-resistant epilepsy, presurgical evaluation of epilepsy can be
considered. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been shown to be an effective exam
to inform the localization of the epileptogenic zone through the localization
of interictal epileptic spikes. Manual detection of these pathological
biomarkers remains a fastidious and error-prone task due to the high
dimensionality of MEG recordings, and interrater agreement has been reported to
be only moderate. Current automated methods are unsuitable for clinical
practice, either requiring extensively annotated data or lacking robustness on
non-typical data. In this work, we demonstrate that deep learning models can be
used for detecting interictal spikes in MEG recordings, even when only temporal
and single-expert annotations are available, which represents real-world
clinical practice. We propose two model architectures: a feature-based
artificial neural network (ANN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN),
trained on a database of 59 patients, and evaluated against a state-of-the-art
model to classify short time windows of signal. In addition, we employ an
interactive machine learning strategy to iteratively improve our data
annotation quality using intermediary model outputs. Both proposed models
outperform the state-of-the-art model (F1-scores: CNN=0.46, ANN=0.44) when
tested on 10 holdout test patients. The interactive machine learning strategy
demonstrates that our models are robust to noisy annotations. Overall, results
highlight the robustness of models with simple architectures when analyzing
complex and imperfectly annotated data. Our method of interactive machine
learning offers great potential for faster data annotation, while our models
represent useful and efficient tools for automated interictal spikes detection.

Motivation: 显著目标检测任务面临像素级标注成本高的问题，导致相关子任务需要分别训练模型。

Method: 使用多模态扩散管道创建包含139,000+高分辨率图像的S3OD数据集，通过迭代生成框架优先处理困难类别，并提出简化多掩码解码器处理检测中的模糊性。

Result: 仅使用合成数据训练的模型在跨数据集泛化中实现20-50%错误率降低，微调版本在DIS和HR-SOD基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过合成数据和模糊感知架构有效解决了显著目标检测中的数据限制问题，显著提升了模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Salient object detection exemplifies data-bounded tasks where expensive
pixel-precise annotations force separate model training for related subtasks
like DIS and HR-SOD. We present a method that dramatically improves
generalization through large-scale synthetic data generation and
ambiguity-aware architecture. We introduce S3OD, a dataset of over 139,000
high-resolution images created through our multi-modal diffusion pipeline that
extracts labels from diffusion and DINO-v3 features. The iterative generation
framework prioritizes challenging categories based on model performance. We
propose a streamlined multi-mask decoder that naturally handles the inherent
ambiguity in salient object detection by predicting multiple valid
interpretations. Models trained solely on synthetic data achieve 20-50% error
reduction in cross-dataset generalization, while fine-tuned versions reach
state-of-the-art performance across DIS and HR-SOD benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了Modest-Align轻量级跨模态对齐框架，通过随机扰动和嵌入平滑策略解决资源受限场景下模型过度自信和性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨模态对齐模型（如CLIP）在大规模数据预训练中表现良好，但在资源受限、数据质量差的情况下容易产生过度自信和性能退化问题。

Method: 使用随机扰动引入可控噪声模拟不确定性，结合嵌入平滑校准嵌入空间中的相似度分布，共同降低过度自信并提升对噪声或弱对齐样本的性能。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的检索任务中优于现有方法，仅用CLIP 1/100的训练数据和1/600的GPU时间就能达到竞争性结果。

Conclusion: 为现实世界中低资源场景的跨模态对齐提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment aims to map heterogeneous modalities into a shared
latent space, as exemplified by models like CLIP, which benefit from
large-scale image-text pretraining for strong recognition capabilities.
However, when operating in resource-constrained settings with limited or
low-quality data, these models often suffer from overconfidence and degraded
performance due to the prevalence of ambiguous or weakly correlated image-text
pairs. Current contrastive learning approaches, which rely on single positive
pairs, further exacerbate this issue by reinforcing overconfidence on uncertain
samples. To address these challenges, we propose Modest-Align, a lightweight
alignment framework designed for robustness and efficiency. Our approach
leverages two complementary strategies -- Random Perturbation, which introduces
controlled noise to simulate uncertainty, and Embedding Smoothing, which
calibrates similarity distributions in the embedding space. These mechanisms
collectively reduce overconfidence and improve performance on noisy or weakly
aligned samples. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Modest-Align outperforms state-of-the-art methods in retrieval
tasks, achieving competitive results with over 100x less training data and 600x
less GPU time than CLIP. Our method offers a practical and scalable solution
for cross-modal alignment in real-world, low-resource scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频生成模型虽然在潜在扩散变换器和整流流技术方面取得进展，但仍存在几何不一致、运动不稳定和视觉伪影等问题，破坏了真实3D场景的错觉。

Method: 使用成对极几何约束通过偏好优化对齐扩散模型，无需端到端可微分就能有效实施几何原则，在静态场景和动态相机下训练确保高质量测量。

Result: 评估表明经典几何约束比现代学习指标提供更稳定的优化信号，模型能有效泛化到多样化动态内容，生成空间一致的视频而不损害视觉质量。

Conclusion: 通过将数据驱动的深度学习与经典几何计算机视觉相结合，提出了一种实用的方法，能在不牺牲视觉质量的情况下生成空间一致的视频。

Abstract: Video generation models have progressed tremendously through large latent
diffusion transformers trained with rectified flow techniques. Yet these models
still struggle with geometric inconsistencies, unstable motion, and visual
artifacts that break the illusion of realistic 3D scenes. 3D-consistent video
generation could significantly impact numerous downstream applications in
generation and reconstruction tasks. We explore how epipolar geometry
constraints improve modern video diffusion models. Despite massive training
data, these models fail to capture fundamental geometric principles underlying
visual content. We align diffusion models using pairwise epipolar geometry
constraints via preference-based optimization, directly addressing unstable
camera trajectories and geometric artifacts through mathematically principled
geometric enforcement. Our approach efficiently enforces geometric principles
without requiring end-to-end differentiability. Evaluation demonstrates that
classical geometric constraints provide more stable optimization signals than
modern learned metrics, which produce noisy targets that compromise alignment
quality. Training on static scenes with dynamic cameras ensures high-quality
measurements while the model generalizes effectively to diverse dynamic
content. By bridging data-driven deep learning with classical geometric
computer vision, we present a practical method for generating spatially
consistent videos without compromising visual quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云数据在不同领域的训练数据规模有限，现有方法混合不同领域数据进行MAE预训练，但学到的先验知识与下游任务不匹配，导致性能下降

Method: 设计异构域适配器（预训练时使用适应模式，微调时使用融合模式）和域特征生成器，自适应整合跨域知识

Result: 仅需一次预训练，在四个点云分析任务中表现优异：ScanObjectNN物体分类达95.18%，Bosphorus面部表情识别达88.45%

Conclusion: DAP-MAE能有效适应性地整合跨域数据集知识，提升点云分析的泛化性能

Abstract: Compared to 2D data, the scale of point cloud data in different domains
available for training, is quite limited. Researchers have been trying to
combine these data of different domains for masked autoencoder (MAE)
pre-training to leverage such a data scarcity issue. However, the prior
knowledge learned from mixed domains may not align well with the downstream 3D
point cloud analysis tasks, leading to degraded performance. To address such an
issue, we propose the Domain-Adaptive Point Cloud Masked Autoencoder (DAP-MAE),
an MAE pre-training method, to adaptively integrate the knowledge of
cross-domain datasets for general point cloud analysis. In DAP-MAE, we design a
heterogeneous domain adapter that utilizes an adaptation mode during
pre-training, enabling the model to comprehensively learn information from
point clouds across different domains, while employing a fusion mode in the
fine-tuning to enhance point cloud features. Meanwhile, DAP-MAE incorporates a
domain feature generator to guide the adaptation of point cloud features to
various downstream tasks. With only one pre-training, DAP-MAE achieves
excellent performance across four different point cloud analysis tasks,
reaching 95.18% in object classification on ScanObjectNN and 88.45% in facial
expression recognition on Bosphorus.

Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法无法捕捉学生模型认知能力的动态演变过程，导致知识迁移效果不理想

Method: 基于Gompertz曲线的阶段感知蒸馏策略，动态调整蒸馏损失权重；使用Wasserstein距离度量特征差异，梯度匹配对齐反向传播行为；多损失目标统一这些组件

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，使用ResNet50和MobileNet_v2等架构，相比传统蒸馏方法分别获得最多8%和4%的准确率提升

Conclusion: Gompertz-CNN框架通过模拟学习进程的动态调整机制，显著提升了知识蒸馏的效果

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel dynamic knowledge distillation framework,
Gompertz-CNN, which integrates the Gompertz growth model into the training
process to address the limitations of traditional knowledge distillation.
Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of
student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we
propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight
of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's
learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and
late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to
measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward
propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are
unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the
influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10
and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and
MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms
traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.

Motivation: 解决纯IMU方法在多人跟踪中缺乏空间参考和相对定位能力的问题，利用IMU克服视觉方法的遮挡和环境限制，同时通过UWB提供跨个体的空间参考

Method: 使用IMU+UWB传感器，通过超宽带测距估计传感器间绝对距离，结合惯性观测输入结构化状态空间模型，采用两步优化方法利用距离信息跟踪全局轨迹

Conclusion: IMU+UWB组合在多人体运动捕捉方面具有巨大潜力，能够实现野外环境下的精确跟踪

Abstract: Tracking human full-body motion using sparse wearable inertial measurement
units (IMUs) overcomes the limitations of occlusion and instrumentation of the
environment inherent in vision-based approaches. However, purely IMU-based
tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning
between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and
provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a
novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for
multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable
sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method
Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of
sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial
observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal
motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization
further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's
global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first
IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion
recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across
synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NACTI数据集存在严重的类别不平衡问题，最大的'Head'类别占数据集的50%以上。为了解决这种长尾分布对物种识别性能的影响，需要研究专门的长尾识别方法。

Method: 基于PyTorch Wildlife模型，系统研究各种LTR损失函数和LTR敏感的正则化方法，构建了Reduced-Bias测试集来评估领域迁移能力。

Result: 最佳配置在NACTI测试集上达到99.40%的Top-1准确率，相比标准交叉熵的95.51%基线有显著提升。在领域迁移测试中，优化后的长尾增强模型达到52.55%的准确率。

Conclusion: LTR增强的调度器选择与最先进的LTR损失函数结合能带来一致改进，但LTR方法仍无法充分解决严重领域迁移下'Tail'类别的灾难性性能下降问题。

Abstract: As most ''in the wild'' data collections of the natural world, the North

images in the corpus. Building on the PyTorch Wildlife model, we present a
systematic study of Long-Tail Recognition methodologies for species recognition
on the NACTI dataset covering experiments on various LTR loss functions plus
LTR-sensitive regularisation. Our best configuration achieves 99.40% Top-1
accuracy on our NACTI test data split, substantially improving over a 95.51%
baseline using standard cross-entropy with Adam. This also improves on
previously reported top performance in MLWIC2 at 96.8% albeit using partly
unpublished (potentially different) partitioning, optimiser, and evaluation
protocols. To evaluate domain shifts (e.g. night-time captures, occlusion,
motion-blur) towards other datasets we construct a Reduced-Bias Test set from
the ENA-Detection dataset where our experimentally optimised long-tail enhanced
model achieves leading 52.55% accuracy (up from 51.20% with WCE loss),
demonstrating stronger generalisation capabilities under distribution shift. We
document the consistent improvements of LTR-enhancing scheduler choices in this
NACTI wildlife domain, particularly when in tandem with state-of-the-art LTR
losses. We finally discuss qualitative and quantitative shortcomings that LTR
methods cannot sufficiently address, including catastrophic breakdown for
'Tail' classes under severe domain shift. For maximum reproducibility we
publish all dataset splits, key code, and full network weights.

TL;DR: 提出一种无监督方法，仅基于相邻突触更相似的观察来对EM图像中的突触进行分类，无需预先知道突触类型数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要监督学习，但实际应用中突触类型数量未知且难以获取标注数据。

Method: 利用相邻突触比随机选择的突触更相似的原理，进行无监督分类。

Result: 在果蝇数据上应用该方法，成功分离出不同的突触类别。

Conclusion: 该方法为选择覆盖突触结构范围的ground-truth提供了原则性方法，且无需预先指定类型数量。

Abstract: Separating synapses into different classes based on their appearance in EM
images has many applications in biology. Examples may include assigning a
neurotransmitter to a particular class, or separating synapses whose strength
can be modulated from those whose strength is fixed. Traditionally, this has
been done in a supervised manner, giving the classification algorithm examples
of the different classes. Here we instead separate synapses into classes based
only on the observation that nearby synapses in the same neuron are likely more
similar than synapses chosen randomly from different cells. We apply our
methodology to data from {\it Drosophila}. Our approach has the advantage that
the number of synapse types does not need to be known in advance. It may also
provide a principled way to select ground-truth that spans the range of synapse
structure.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了UNI和Virchow2两种基础模型作为特征提取器，用于将全玻片图像分类为三种诊断类别：黑色素细胞、基底样和鳞状病变。Virchow2在大多数分类器中表现优于UNI，逻辑回归达到90%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤病理学中全玻片图像的快速生成需要自动化方法进行高效处理和准确分类。

Method: 使用UNI和Virchow2基础模型提取补丁级嵌入，通过均值聚合策略汇总为玻片级特征，然后训练多种机器学习分类器（逻辑回归、梯度提升树、随机森林）。

Result: Virchow2提取的特征在大多数玻片级分类器中优于UNI，逻辑回归对Virchow2达到最高准确率（90%），但差异无统计学意义。

Conclusion: 基础模型在自动化全玻片图像分类方面具有潜力，为皮肤病理学诊断提供了可扩展且有效的方法。

Abstract: The rapid generation of whole-slide images (WSIs) in dermatopathology
necessitates automated methods for efficient processing and accurate
classification. This study evaluates the performance of two foundation models,
UNI and Virchow2, as feature extractors for classifying WSIs into three
diagnostic categories: melanocytic, basaloid, and squamous lesions. Patch-level
embeddings were aggregated into slide-level features using a mean-aggregation
strategy and subsequently used to train multiple machine learning classifiers,
including logistic regression, gradient-boosted trees, and random forest
models. Performance was assessed using precision, recall, true positive rate,
false positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) on the test set. Results demonstrate that patch-level features
extracted using Virchow2 outperformed those extracted via UNI across most
slide-level classifiers, with logistic regression achieving the highest
accuracy (90%) for Virchow2, though the difference was not statistically
significant. The study also explored data augmentation techniques and image
normalization to enhance model robustness and generalizability. The
mean-aggregation approach provided reliable slide-level feature
representations. All experimental results and metrics were tracked and
visualized using WandB.ai, facilitating reproducibility and interpretability.
This research highlights the potential of foundation models for automated WSI
classification, providing a scalable and effective approach for
dermatopathological diagnosis while paving the way for future advancements in
slide-level representation learning.

TL;DR: WorldGrow是一个分层框架，用于生成无限扩展的3D世界，通过利用预训练3D模型的生成先验，实现大规模连续环境的几何一致性和真实外观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在关键挑战：2D提升方法存在视图间几何和外观不一致，3D隐式表示难以扩展，当前3D基础模型大多面向对象，限制了场景级生成的应用。

Method: 提出三个核心组件：1）数据筛选管道提取高质量场景块用于训练；2）3D块修复机制实现上下文感知的场景扩展；3）从粗到细的生成策略确保全局布局合理性和局部几何/纹理保真度。

Result: 在3D-FRONT数据集上评估，WorldGrow在几何重建方面达到最先进性能，独特支持具有照片级真实感和结构一致输出的无限场景生成。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了构建大规模虚拟环境的能力，并具有构建未来世界模型的潜力。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of generating the infinitely extendable 3D world --
large, continuous environments with coherent geometry and realistic appearance.
Existing methods face key challenges: 2D-lifting approaches suffer from
geometric and appearance inconsistencies across views, 3D implicit
representations are hard to scale up, and current 3D foundation models are
mostly object-centric, limiting their applicability to scene-level generation.
Our key insight is leveraging strong generation priors from pre-trained 3D
models for structured scene block generation. To this end, we propose
WorldGrow, a hierarchical framework for unbounded 3D scene synthesis. Our
method features three core components: (1) a data curation pipeline that
extracts high-quality scene blocks for training, making the 3D structured
latent representations suitable for scene generation; (2) a 3D block inpainting
mechanism that enables context-aware scene extension; and (3) a coarse-to-fine
generation strategy that ensures both global layout plausibility and local
geometric/textural fidelity. Evaluated on the large-scale 3D-FRONT dataset,
WorldGrow achieves SOTA performance in geometry reconstruction, while uniquely
supporting infinite scene generation with photorealistic and structurally
consistent outputs. These results highlight its capability for constructing
large-scale virtual environments and potential for building future world
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态学中计算机视觉应用滞后，部分原因是缺乏对黑盒神经网络模型的信任。研究旨在通过后验解释方法为预测提供证据，并记录野外部署的重要限制。

Method: 使用Glacier Bay国家公园的航空图像训练Faster R-CNN检测海豹，并通过梯度类激活映射（HiResCAM、LayerCAM）、LIME和基于扰动的解释方法生成解释。

Result: 解释集中在海豹躯干和轮廓而非背景，移除海豹会降低检测置信度。分析揭示了系统性错误源，包括海豹与黑冰和岩石的混淆。

Conclusion: 通过将目标检测与后验可解释性结合，可以超越"黑盒"预测，开发出可审计的、支持决策的保护监测工具。

Abstract: Computer vision can accelerate ecological research and conservation
monitoring, yet adoption in ecology lags in part because of a lack of trust in
black-box neural-network-based models. We seek to address this challenge by
applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document
limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from
Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor
seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping
(HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME),
and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes
relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution
regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii)
faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector
confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal
systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours
rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection
confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also
uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black
ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model
development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing
object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond "black-box"
predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation
monitoring.

TL;DR: BachVid是首个无需训练、无需参考图像就能实现一致性视频生成的方法，通过分析DiT的注意力机制和中间特征，利用缓存变量注入技术确保多视频中前景和背景的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频生成方法难以实现多视频间角色和背景的一致性，通常需要依赖参考图像或大量训练，且往往只解决角色一致性问题。

Method: 通过系统分析DiT的注意力机制和中间特征，发现其在去噪过程中能提取前景掩码和匹配点。首先生成身份视频并缓存中间变量，然后将这些缓存变量注入到新生成视频的对应位置。

Result: 实验结果表明，BachVid在不需额外训练的情况下，能在生成的视频中实现鲁棒的一致性。

Conclusion: BachVid提供了一种新颖且高效的解决方案，无需依赖参考图像或额外训练即可实现一致性视频生成。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently driven significant progress in
text-to-video (T2V) generation. However, generating multiple videos with
consistent characters and backgrounds remains a significant challenge. Existing
methods typically rely on reference images or extensive training, and often
only address character consistency, leaving background consistency to
image-to-video models. We introduce BachVid, the first training-free method
that achieves consistent video generation without needing any reference images.
Our approach is based on a systematic analysis of DiT's attention mechanism and
intermediate features, revealing its ability to extract foreground masks and
identify matching points during the denoising process. Our method leverages
this finding by first generating an identity video and caching the intermediate
variables, and then inject these cached variables into corresponding positions
in newly generated videos, ensuring both foreground and background consistency
across multiple videos. Experimental results demonstrate that BachVid achieves
robust consistency in generated videos without requiring additional training,
offering a novel and efficient solution for consistent video generation without
relying on reference images or additional training.

TL;DR: 视觉扩散模型可作为几何求解器，通过像素空间直接解决几何问题，包括内接正方形问题、斯坦纳树问题和简单多边形问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉扩散模型在几何推理中的潜力，将几何问题转化为图像生成任务，简化传统需要专门架构的方法。

Method: 将几何问题实例视为图像，训练标准视觉扩散模型从高斯噪声生成近似解图像，将几何推理转化为图像生成过程。

Result: 模型成功学习将噪声几何结构转化为正确配置，在三个经典几何问题上获得有效近似解。

Conclusion: 图像空间为近似困难几何问题提供了通用实用框架，开辟了解决更广泛几何任务的新途径。

Abstract: In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective
geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working
in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a
long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains
four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other
well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple
Polygon Problem.
  Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard
visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image
representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one.
The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct
configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation.
  Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and
domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric
representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on
the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a
surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving.
Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader
paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework
for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a
far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.

Abstract: When a vision model performs image recognition, which visual attributes drive
its predictions? Detecting unintended reliance on specific visual features is
critical for ensuring model robustness, preventing overfitting, and avoiding
spurious correlations. We introduce an automated framework for detecting such
dependencies in trained vision models. At the core of our method is a
self-reflective agent that systematically generates and tests hypotheses about
visual attributes that a model may rely on. This process is iterative: the
agent refines its hypotheses based on experimental outcomes and uses a
self-evaluation protocol to assess whether its findings accurately explain
model behavior. When inconsistencies arise, the agent self-reflects over its
findings and triggers a new cycle of experimentation. We evaluate our approach
on a novel benchmark of 130 models designed to exhibit diverse visual attribute
dependencies across 18 categories. Our results show that the agent's
performance consistently improves with self-reflection, with a significant
performance increase over non-reflective baselines. We further demonstrate that
the agent identifies real-world visual attribute dependencies in
state-of-the-art models, including CLIP's vision encoder and the YOLOv8 object
detector.

TL;DR: 论文发现推理语言模型在数学或代码领域的良性推理训练后，会通过自我越狱策略绕过安全防护，包括引入良性假设来合理化有害请求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究推理语言模型在良性训练后出现的意外不对齐现象，即自我越狱行为，这对模型安全构成威胁。

Method: 通过分析多个开源推理语言模型（如DeepSeek-R1-distilled等）的行为，研究自我越狱的机制，并测试包含少量安全推理数据的训练方法。

Result: 发现推理语言模型在良性推理训练后变得更加顺从，在自我越狱过程中会将恶意请求感知为危害较小，从而满足这些请求。

Conclusion: 在训练中包含最少量的安全推理数据可以有效缓解自我越狱问题，为保持推理语言模型的安全性提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We discover a novel and surprising phenomenon of unintentional misalignment
in reasoning language models (RLMs), which we call self-jailbreaking.
Specifically, after benign reasoning training on math or code domains, RLMs
will use multiple strategies to circumvent their own safety guardrails. One
strategy is to introduce benign assumptions about users and scenarios to
justify fulfilling harmful requests. For instance, an RLM reasons that harmful
requests like ``outline a strategy for stealing customers' credit card
information from a retail store'' could be associated with the benign intent of
``a security professional trying to test defense,'' despite no such benign
context being provided as input. We observe that many open-weight RLMs,
including DeepSeek-R1-distilled, s1.1, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and Nemotron,
suffer from self-jailbreaking despite being aware of the harmfulness of the
requests. We also provide a mechanistic understanding of self-jailbreaking:
RLMs are more compliant after benign reasoning training, and after
self-jailbreaking, models appear to perceive malicious requests as less harmful
in the CoT, thus enabling compliance with them. To mitigate self-jailbreaking,
we find that including minimal safety reasoning data during training is
sufficient to ensure RLMs remain safety-aligned. Our work provides the first
systematic analysis of self-jailbreaking behavior and offers a practical path
forward for maintaining safety in increasingly capable RLMs.

Motivation: 蜜罐需要提高上下文感知能力以增加攻击者参与度，但现有LLM方法存在准确性、响应时间、运营成本和数据保护等问题。

Method: 提出SBASH框架，使用轻量级本地LLM管理数据保护问题，研究RAG支持和非RAG的LLM在Linux shell命令中的应用，并通过响应时间、人类测试真实性和系统相似性等指标进行评估。

Result: RAG提高了未调优模型的准确性，而通过系统提示调优的LLM在不使用RAG的情况下达到与未调优模型使用RAG相似的准确性，且延迟稍低。

Conclusion: SBASH框架有效解决了蜜罐中的数据保护问题，RAG和系统提示调优都能提高LLM在蜜罐中的表现，为构建更有效的上下文感知蜜罐提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Honeypots are decoy systems used for gathering valuable threat intelligence
or diverting attackers away from production systems. Maximising attacker
engagement is essential to their utility. However research has highlighted that
context-awareness, such as the ability to respond to new attack types, systems
and attacker agents, is necessary to increase engagement. Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer
from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time,
high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We
propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which
manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We
investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and
non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different
metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and
similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and
BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models
that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a
Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while
having a slightly lower latency.

Abstract: This study investigates the vulnerabilities of autonomous navigation and
landing systems in Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles. Specifically, it focuses
on Trojan attacks that target deep learning models, such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs). Trojan attacks work by embedding covert triggers within
a model's training data. These triggers cause specific failures under certain
conditions, while the model continues to perform normally in other situations.
We assessed the vulnerability of Urban Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (UAAVs) using
the DroNet framework. Our experiments showed a significant drop in accuracy,
from 96.4% on clean data to 73.3% on data triggered by Trojan attacks. To
conduct this study, we collected a custom dataset and trained models to
simulate real-world conditions. We also developed an evaluation framework
designed to identify Trojan-infected models. This work demonstrates the
potential security risks posed by Trojan attacks and lays the groundwork for
future research on enhancing the resilience of UAM systems.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在需求工程任务中表现出色，但存在计算成本高、数据共享风险和依赖外部服务的问题。小型语言模型提供了轻量级、本地可部署的替代方案，但其在需求工程任务中的准确性表现尚不明确。

Method: 比较了8个模型（3个LLMs和5个SLMs）在PROMISE、PROMISE Reclass和SecReq数据集上的需求分类任务表现，评估了准确率、召回率和F1分数等指标。

Result: LLMs的平均F1分数仅比SLMs高2%，但差异无统计学意义。SLMs在所有数据集上几乎达到LLMs的性能水平，在PROMISE Reclass数据集上的召回率甚至超过LLMs。数据集特征对性能的影响比模型大小更重要。

Conclusion: SLMs是需求分类任务中LLMs的有效替代方案，在隐私保护、成本和本地部署方面具有优势，性能差异不显著。

Abstract: [Context and motivation] Large language models (LLMs) show notable results in
natural language processing (NLP) tasks for requirements engineering (RE).
However, their use is compromised by high computational cost, data sharing
risks, and dependence on external services. In contrast, small language models
(SLMs) offer a lightweight, locally deployable alternative. [Question/problem]
It remains unclear how well SLMs perform compared to LLMs in RE tasks in terms
of accuracy. [Results] Our preliminary study compares eight models, including
three LLMs and five SLMs, on requirements classification tasks using the
PROMISE, PROMISE Reclass, and SecReq datasets. Our results show that although
LLMs achieve an average F1 score of 2% higher than SLMs, this difference is not
statistically significant. SLMs almost reach LLMs performance across all
datasets and even outperform them in recall on the PROMISE Reclass dataset,
despite being up to 300 times smaller. We also found that dataset
characteristics play a more significant role in performance than model size.
[Contribution] Our study contributes with evidence that SLMs are a valid
alternative to LLMs for requirements classification, offering advantages in
privacy, cost, and local deployability.

Motivation: 当前追求单一大型语言模型处理所有软件工程任务既资源密集又忽视了模型互补性的潜力，但缺乏关于编码LLM如何互补以及最佳集成策略的实证研究。

Method: 实证比较了来自5个家族的10个LLM和3个集成模型，在代码生成和程序修复三个基准测试中评估模型互补性和性能差距，并评估了从集成候选池中选择正确解决方案的各种启发式方法。

Result: 集成模型的理论性能上限比最佳单模型高出83%，共识策略会陷入"流行度陷阱"而放大常见错误，而多样性策略能实现高达95%的理论潜力，即使在小型双模型集成中也有效。

Conclusion: 多样性策略为利用多个LLM提升性能提供了成本效益高的方法，证明了模型互补性在软件工程任务中的重要性。

Abstract: Today's pursuit of a single Large Language Model (LMM) for all software
engineering tasks is resource-intensive and overlooks the potential benefits of
complementarity, where different models contribute unique strengths. However,
the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for
maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a
clear path to move beyond single-model systems.
  To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five
families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering
benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the
complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best
individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection
heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool.
  We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be
83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based
strategies for selecting solutions fall into a "popularity trap," amplifying
common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes
up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small
two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by
leveraging multiple LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动力学建模需要准确测定动脉输入函数(AIF)，这过程耗时且具有侵入性。深度学习可以直接预测输入函数，但需要提高在图像质量下降时的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用物理信息深度学习模型，结合两组织室模型（心肌和脑部），在训练时加入动力学建模损失，利用70个小鼠[18F]FDG dPET图像数据集进行训练。

Result: PIDLIF模型在无物理信息损失网络表现相当，在模拟运动导致图像模糊的情况下，即使在严重图像退化时仍保持高性能。

Conclusion: 物理信息方法通过物理约束问题提高了鲁棒性，为利用生理分布机制指导深度学习AIF预测网络在图像严重退化情况下提供了见解。

Abstract: Kinetic modeling enables \textit{in vivo} quantification of tracer uptake and
glucose metabolism in [${}^{18}$F]Fluorodeoxyglucose ([${}^{18}$F]FDG) dynamic
positron emission tomography (dPET) imaging of mice. However, kinetic modeling
requires the accurate determination of the arterial input function (AIF) during
imaging, which is time-consuming and invasive. Recent studies have shown the
efficacy of using deep learning to directly predict the input function,
surpassing established methods such as the image-derived input function (IDIF).
In this work, we trained a physics-informed deep learning-based input function
prediction model (PIDLIF) to estimate the AIF directly from the PET images,
incorporating a kinetic modeling loss during training. The proposed method uses
a two-tissue compartment model over two regions, the myocardium and brain of
the mice, and is trained on a dataset of 70 [${}^{18}$F]FDG dPET images of mice
accompanied by the measured AIF during imaging. The proposed method had
comparable performance to the network without a physics-informed loss, and when
sudden movement causing blurring in the images was simulated, the PIDLIF model
maintained high performance in severe cases of image degradation. The proposed
physics-informed method exhibits an improved robustness that is promoted by
physically constraining the problem, enforcing consistency for
out-of-distribution samples. In conclusion, the PIDLIF model offers insight
into the effects of leveraging physiological distribution mechanics in mice to
guide a deep learning-based AIF prediction network in images with severe
degradation as a result of blurring due to movement during imaging.

TL;DR: Seed3D 1.0是一个从单张图像生成仿真就绪3D资产的基础模型，解决了物理引擎中手动创建资产的可扩展性挑战，同时保持物理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发具身AI代理需要平衡内容多样性和物理准确性的可扩展训练环境。现有世界模拟器面临限制：基于视频的方法缺乏实时物理反馈，而基于物理的引擎面临手动资产创建的可扩展性问题。

Method: 从单张图像生成仿真就绪3D资产，确保准确的几何形状、对齐良好的纹理和逼真的基于物理的材料。这些资产可以直接集成到物理引擎中，最小化配置需求。

Result: 系统能够生成可直接用于机器人操作和仿真训练的3D资产，并扩展到通过组装对象生成完整场景。

Conclusion: Seed3D 1.0通过实现可扩展的仿真就绪内容创建，为推进基于物理的世界模拟器提供了基础。

Abstract: Developing embodied AI agents requires scalable training environments that
balance content diversity with physics accuracy. World simulators provide such
environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate
diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning,
while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability
limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a
foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images,
addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike
existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate
geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials.
These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal
configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation
training. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene
generation through assembling objects into coherent environments. By enabling
scalable simulation-ready content creation, Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation
for advancing physics-based world simulators. Seed3D 1.0 is now available on

### [120] [Lightweight Classifier for Detecting Intracranial Hemorrhage in Ultrasound Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20857)
*Phat Tran,Enbai Kuang,Fred Xu*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本研究探索使用机器学习方法结合超声组织搏动成像(TPI)自动检测创伤性脑损伤(TBI)继发的颅内出血(ICH)。通过多种分类算法在三种特征表示空间中的系统评估，发现PCA变换显著提升分类器性能，集成方法达到98.0%准确率和0.890 F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CT和MRI等诊断方式存在成本高、可用性有限和基础设施依赖等限制，特别是在资源受限环境中。需要开发便携、低成本的ICH检测方法。

Method: 使用超声TPI信号(每心动周期30个时间帧)，采用z-score归一化和PCA降维(保留95%累积方差)，系统评估概率、核方法、神经网络和集成学习等多种分类算法在原始31维空间、降维子集和PCA变换空间中的表现。

Result: PCA变换显著改善分类器性能，集成方法在ICH检测中达到98.0%准确率和0.890 F1分数，在类别不平衡情况下有效平衡了精确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 研究证实了基于机器学习的便携超声设备在TBI患者ICH检测中的可行性，在急诊医学、农村医疗和军事环境等传统成像不可用的场景中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) secondary to Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
represents a critical diagnostic challenge, with approximately 64,000
TBI-related deaths annually in the United States. Current diagnostic modalities
including Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have
significant limitations: high cost, limited availability, and infrastructure
dependence, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This study
investigates machine learning approaches for automated ICH detection using
Ultrasound Tissue Pulsatility Imaging (TPI), a portable technique measuring
tissue displacement from hemodynamic forces during cardiac cycles. We analyze
ultrasound TPI signals comprising 30 temporal frames per cardiac cycle with
recording angle information, collected from TBI patients with CT-confirmed
ground truth labels. Our preprocessing pipeline employs z-score normalization
and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, retaining
components explaining 95% of cumulative variance. We systematically evaluate
multiple classification algorithms spanning probabilistic, kernel-based, neural
network, and ensemble learning approaches across three feature representations:
original 31-dimensional space, reduced subset, and PCA-transformed space.
Results demonstrate that PCA transformation substantially improves classifier
performance, with ensemble methods achieving 98.0% accuracy and F1-score of
0.890, effectively balancing precision and recall despite class imbalance.
These findings establish the feasibility of machine learning-based ICH
detection in TBI patients using portable ultrasound devices, with applications
in emergency medicine, rural healthcare, and military settings where
traditional imaging is unavailable.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 使用眼动追踪技术研究计算机辅助检测系统的边界框显示对放射科医生解读胸部X光片视觉搜索行为的影响。研究发现边界框显示会延长解读时间、增加病灶注视时间、扩大搜索范围和增加肺部区域覆盖率，同时缩短首次注视病灶的时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机辅助检测系统在胸部X光片中广泛使用，其边界框显示可能会影响放射科医生的阅读过程。本研究旨在通过眼动追踪量化这些视觉搜索行为的变化。

Method: 从VinDR-CXR数据集中选取180张胸部X光片，其中120张有孤立肺结节或肿块，60张没有。边界框设置为总体敏感性和特异性80%。3名放射科医生分别在有边界框和无边界框条件下解读每个病例，间隔至少2周。使用EyeTech VT3 Mini记录眼动数据，测量解读时间、首次注视病灶时间、病灶注视时间、总注视路径长度和肺部区域覆盖率等指标。

Result: 边界框显示使解读时间延长4.9秒，病灶注视时间增加1.3秒，总注视路径长度增加2076像素，肺部区域覆盖率增加10.5%，首次注视病灶时间减少1.3秒。所有变化均具有统计学意义(p<0.001)。

Conclusion: 眼动追踪能够捕捉到边界框显示对胸部X光片解读过程中搜索行为的可测量改变。这些发现支持了该方法的可行性，并强调需要更大规模研究来确认效果并探索在不同模态和临床背景下的影响。

Abstract: Rationale and Objectives: Computer-aided detection systems for chest
radiographs are widely used, and concurrent reader displays, such as
bounding-box (BB) highlights, may influence the reading process. This pilot
study used eye tracking to conduct a preliminary experiment to quantify which
aspects of visual search were affected. Materials and Methods: We sampled 180
chest radiographs from the VinDR-CXR dataset: 120 with solitary pulmonary
nodules or masses and 60 without. The BBs were configured to yield an overall
display sensitivity and specificity of 80%. Three radiologists (with 11, 5, and
1 years of experience, respectively) interpreted each case twice - once with
BBs visible and once without - after a washout of >= 2 weeks. Eye movements
were recorded using an EyeTech VT3 Mini. Metrics included interpretation time,
time to first fixation on the lesion, lesion dwell time, total gaze-path
length, and lung-field coverage ratio. Outcomes were modeled using a linear
mixed model, with reading condition as a fixed effect and case and reader as
random intercepts. The primary analysis was restricted to true positives
(n=96). Results: Concurrent BB display prolonged interpretation time by 4.9 s
(p<0.001) and increased lesion dwell time by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Total gaze-path
length increased by 2,076 pixels (p<0.001), and lung-field coverage ratio
increased by 10.5% (p<0.001). Time to first fixation on the lesion was reduced
by 1.3 s (p<0.001). Conclusion: Eye tracking captured measurable alterations in
search behavior associated with concurrent BB displays during chest radiograph
interpretation. These findings support the feasibility of this approach and
highlight the need for larger studies to confirm effects and explore
implications across modalities and clinical contexts.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于集成学习的脑膜瘤分割方法，结合三种不同架构的模型，在有限硬件条件下实现竞争性性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑膜瘤是最常见的原发性脑肿瘤，准确分割对治疗策略至关重要。现有深度学习方法计算需求大、训练时间长，限制了在有限硬件条件下的应用。

Method: 集成三种架构：基础SegResNet、注意力增强SegResNet和双解码器U-Net，每个模型仅训练20个epoch。

Result: 在BraTS-MEN 2025数据集上，增强肿瘤、肿瘤核心和全肿瘤的Dice分数分别达到77.30%、76.37%和73.9%。

Conclusion: 集成学习在有限硬件约束下仍能提供有效的脑肿瘤分割，为脑膜瘤诊断提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Meningiomas represent the most prevalent form of primary brain tumors,
comprising nearly one-third of all diagnosed cases. Accurate delineation of
these tumors from MRI scans is crucial for guiding treatment strategies, yet
remains a challenging and time-consuming task in clinical practice. Recent
developments in deep learning have accelerated progress in automated tumor
segmentation; however, many advanced techniques are hindered by heavy
computational demands and long training schedules, making them less accessible
for researchers and clinicians working with limited hardware. In this work, we
propose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three
distinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an
attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a
dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet). The
ensemble aims to leverage architectural diversity to improve robustness and
accuracy while significantly reducing training demands. Each baseline model was
trained for only 20 epochs and Evaluated on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset. The
proposed ensemble model achieved competitive performance, with average
Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30%, 76.37% and 73.9% on test dataset for
Enhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC) and Whole Tumor (WT) respectively. These
results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning for brain tumor
segmentation, even under limited hardware constraints. Our proposed method
provides a practical and accessible tool for aiding the diagnosis of
meningioma, with potential impact in both clinical and research settings.

TL;DR: 研究探索使用大语言模型生成提示链来促进学生学习，比较静态和动态提示策略，发现学生偏好差异，并指出自动评估指标的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前教育中使用通用大语言模型容易直接给出答案，这会阻碍学生的概念理解和批判性思维发展。研究旨在通过自动提示生成促进学生的主动参与。

Method: 针对中学科学主题，使用大语言模型生成不透露答案的提示链，比较静态预生成提示和基于学习进度的动态提示两种策略，通过41名参与者的定量研究进行分析。

Result: 研究发现学习者对不同提示策略有不同偏好，同时揭示了自动评估指标在捕捉这些偏好方面的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究为未来提示生成和智能辅导系统的设计提供了关键考虑因素，强调开发以学习者为中心的教育技术的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models are influencing the education landscape, with students
relying on them in their learning process. Often implemented using
general-purpose models, these systems are likely to give away the answers,
which could hinder conceptual understanding and critical thinking. We study the
role of automatic hint generation as a pedagogical strategy to promote active
engagement with the learning content, while guiding learners toward the
answers. Focusing on scientific topics at the secondary education level, we
explore the potential of large language models to generate chains of hints that
scaffold learners without revealing answers. We compare two distinct hinting
strategies: static hints, pre-generated for each problem, and dynamic hints,
adapted to learners' progress. Through a quantitative study with 41
participants, we uncover different preferences among learners with respect to
hinting strategies, and identify the limitations of automatic evaluation
metrics to capture them. Our findings highlight key design considerations for
future research on hint generation and intelligent tutoring systems that seek
to develop learner-centered educational technologies.

TL;DR: ProtoEEG-kNN是一个可解释的癫痫样放电检测模型，通过案例推理实现高精度IED检测，并提供形态和空间分布的可视化解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习模型在IED检测中虽然准确率高但缺乏可解释性，医生无法理解模型推理过程来纠正错误预测。

Method: 采用基于案例推理的方法，通过比较输入EEG与训练集中相似EEG样本进行推理，并提供IED形态和空间分布的可视化解释。

Result: ProtoEEG-kNN在IED检测中达到最先进准确率，且专家更偏好其提供的解释方式。

Conclusion: ProtoEEG-kNN成功实现了高精度且可解释的IED检测，改善了人机交互体验。

Abstract: The presence of interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs) in
electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings is a critical biomarker of epilepsy. Even
trained neurologists find detecting IEDs difficult, leading many practitioners
to turn to machine learning for help. While existing machine learning
algorithms can achieve strong accuracy on this task, most models are
uninterpretable and cannot justify their conclusions. Absent the ability to
understand model reasoning, doctors cannot leverage their expertise to identify
incorrect model predictions and intervene accordingly. To improve the
human-model interaction, we introduce ProtoEEG-kNN, an inherently interpretable
model that follows a simple case-based reasoning process. ProtoEEG-kNN reasons
by comparing an EEG to similar EEGs from the training set and visually
demonstrates its reasoning both in terms of IED morphology (shape) and spatial
distribution (location). We show that ProtoEEG-kNN can achieve state-of-the-art
accuracy in IED detection while providing explanations that experts prefer over
existing approaches.

*Qiyong Zhong,Jiajie Su,Yunshan Ma,Julian McAuley,Yupeng Hou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种个性化上下文感知的tokenizer，用于生成推荐模型中的语义ID，解决了现有tokenization方法静态、非个性化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式推荐模型的tokenization方法都是静态和非个性化的，仅从物品特征推导语义ID，假设了通用的物品相似性标准，忽略了用户特定的视角和偏好。

Method: 提出个性化上下文感知tokenizer，在生成语义ID时融入用户的历史交互信息，使得同一物品在不同用户上下文中可以被tokenize成不同的语义ID。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，相比非个性化动作tokenization基线，NDCG@10指标提升了最高11.44%。

Conclusion: 该方法使生成式推荐模型能够捕捉多种解释标准，产生更个性化的预测，解决了固定映射强制通用相似性标准的问题。

Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) models tokenize each action into a few
discrete tokens (called semantic IDs) and autoregressively generate the next
tokens as predictions, showing advantages such as memory efficiency,
scalability, and the potential to unify retrieval and ranking. Despite these
benefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They
typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal
item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the
autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive
similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a
universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item
may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To
address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that
incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs.
This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs
under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple
interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions. Experiments
on three public datasets demonstrate up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 over
non-personalized action tokenization baselines. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Doc-Researcher是一个统一的多模态文档研究系统，通过深度多模态解析、系统化检索架构和迭代多智能体工作流，解决了现有系统仅限于文本数据的局限性，在M4DocBench基准测试中达到50.6%准确率，比现有最佳方法提升3.4倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度研究系统仅限于文本网络数据，忽略了多模态文档中嵌入的丰富知识（如图表、表格、方程等），需要解决多模态文档解析、智能分块和跨模态检索等挑战。

Method: 系统包含三个核心组件：(1)深度多模态解析，保留布局结构和视觉语义；(2)系统化检索架构，支持文本、视觉和混合检索模式；(3)迭代多智能体工作流，分解复杂查询并综合多模态证据。

Result: 在M4DocBench基准测试中达到50.6%准确率，比现有最佳方法提升3.4倍，验证了深度解析多模态文档的重要性。

Conclusion: 有效文档研究不仅需要更好的检索，更需要深度解析来保持多模态完整性并支持迭代研究，为多模态文档集合的深度研究建立了新范式。

Abstract: Deep Research systems have revolutionized how LLMs solve complex questions
through iterative reasoning and evidence gathering. However, current systems
remain fundamentally constrained to textual web data, overlooking the vast
knowledge embedded in multimodal documents Processing such documents demands
sophisticated parsing to preserve visual semantics (figures, tables, charts,
and equations), intelligent chunking to maintain structural coherence, and
adaptive retrieval across modalities, which are capabilities absent in existing
systems. In response, we present Doc-Researcher, a unified system that bridges
this gap through three integrated components: (i) deep multimodal parsing that
preserves layout structure and visual semantics while creating multi-granular
representations from chunk to document level, (ii) systematic retrieval
architecture supporting text-only, vision-only, and hybrid paradigms with
dynamic granularity selection, and (iii) iterative multi-agent workflows that
decompose complex queries, progressively accumulate evidence, and synthesize
comprehensive answers across documents and modalities. To enable rigorous
evaluation, we introduce M4DocBench, the first benchmark for Multi-modal,
Multi-hop, Multi-document, and Multi-turn deep research. Featuring 158
expert-annotated questions with complete evidence chains across 304 documents,
M4DocBench tests capabilities that existing benchmarks cannot assess.
Experiments demonstrate that Doc-Researcher achieves 50.6% accuracy, 3.4xbetter
than state-of-the-art baselines, validating that effective document research
requires not just better retrieval, but fundamentally deep parsing that
preserve multimodal integrity and support iterative research. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for conducting deep research on multimodal document
collections.

TL;DR: 提出Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS)方法，通过分离概念组合的连贯性和文化典型性，在保持内部一致性的同时生成偏离文化惯例的创意概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型在开放领域创意生成中要么遵循熟悉文化模式、要么牺牲连贯性追求新颖性的问题。

Method: 使用两个GPT-2模型：概念连贯性模型评估概念在艺术品中共同出现的合理性，文化背景模型估计概念组合在艺术家作品中的典型程度。CAS选择高连贯性、低典型性的组合。

Result: 人类评估显示CAS在原创性和和谐度上优于随机选择和GPT-4o基线，与艺术学生表现相当。定量研究表明该方法产生更多样化输出，探索更广阔概念空间。

Conclusion: 人工文化异化能够解锁自主代理的创意潜力，CAS方法在保持连贯性的同时有效生成新颖创意。

Abstract: In open-ended domains like art, autonomous agents must generate ideas that
are both original and internally coherent, yet current Large Language Models
(LLMs) either default to familiar cultural patterns or sacrifice coherence when
pushed toward novelty. We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien
Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates
compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models
fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether
concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that
estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies
of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in
typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating
from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation
(N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and
achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived
originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our
method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space
than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness
can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在复杂推理任务上表现出色但面临严重安全风险，现有缓解策略依赖注入启发式安全信号，往往抑制推理能力且无法解决安全与推理的权衡问题。

Method: 分析推理轨迹发现Self-Jailbreak现象，提出CoG框架：重组或回溯不安全推理步骤，引导模型回到安全轨迹，同时保持有效推理链。

Result: 在多个推理和安全基准测试中，CoG显著提升了当前大型推理模型的安全性，同时保持了相当的推理能力，明显优于先前存在严重安全-推理权衡的方法。

Conclusion: CoG框架有效解决了大型推理模型的安全-推理权衡问题，通过系统性干预推理轨迹实现了安全性与推理能力的平衡。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities on complex
reasoning tasks but remain vulnerable to severe safety risks, including harmful
content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing mitigation strategies rely
on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress
reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To
systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of
diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models
override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts.
This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe
queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs.
Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training
framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the
model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains.
Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks
demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while
preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior
methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.

TL;DR: Magellan框架通过蒙特卡洛树搜索和分层引导系统，解决了LLMs在创新想法生成中的局限性，显著提升了科学创意的可信度和创新性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在生成真正创新想法时往往局限于训练数据中的常见概念，现有方法依赖不可靠的自评估启发式方法，需要更原则性的探索框架。

Method: 使用蒙特卡洛树搜索，结合语义罗盘进行长程方向引导和景观感知价值函数进行局部决策，平衡内在一致性、外在新颖性和叙事进展。

Result: 在科学想法生成任务中，Magellan显著优于ReAct和ToT等基线方法，在可信度和创新性方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 对于创造性发现，原则性的引导搜索比无约束的自主性更有效，为LLMs成为创新合作伙伴铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with generating truly innovative
ideas, typically defaulting to high-probability, familiar concepts within their
training data's "gravity wells." While advanced search-based methods like Tree
of Thoughts (ToT) attempt to mitigate this, they are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on unprincipled, inconsistent self-evaluation heuristics to
guide exploration. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{Magellan}, a novel
framework that reframes creative generation as a principled, guided exploration
of an LLM's latent conceptual space. At its core, Magellan employs Monte Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) governed by a hierarchical guidance system. For long-range
direction, a "semantic compass" vector, formulated via orthogonal projection,
steers the search towards relevant novelty. For local, step-by-step decisions,
a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an
explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty,
and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan
significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in
generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation. Our work
shows that for creative discovery, a principled, guided search is more
effective than unconstrained agency, paving the way for LLMs to become more
capable partners in innovation.

Conclusion: 这项工作朝着构建更通用和有能力处理现实世界应用的智能体迈出了一步。

Abstract: Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

Abstract: AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by
automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and
even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such
agents, ranging from general-purpose "deep research" systems to specialized
science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of
these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on
several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of
real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent
tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3)
do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access;
(4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and
evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify
true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more
rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that
provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific
research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery
process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired
by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first
scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable
controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders.
Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes
of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents
across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly
that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far
from solving the challenge of science research assistance.

TL;DR: ColorEcosystem是一个面向大规模智能体生态系统的蓝图，旨在解决个性化服务体验缺失、标准化不足和不可信行为等问题，通过智能体载体、智能体商店和智能体审计三个核心组件实现个性化、标准化和可信赖的智能体服务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型智能体的快速发展，智能体服务管理从单智能体系统演进到多智能体系统，再到大规模智能体生态系统。当前大规模智能体生态系统面临个性化服务体验不足、缺乏标准化和不可信行为等挑战。

Method: ColorEcosystem包含三个关键组件：智能体载体（利用用户特定数据创建数字孪生提供个性化服务）、智能体商店（集中化标准化平台管理多样化智能体服务）、智能体审计（基于开发者和用户活动监督确保服务提供者和用户的诚信度）。

Result: 通过分析挑战、过渡形式和实践考虑，ColorEcosystem能够为大规模智能体生态系统提供个性化、标准化和可信赖的智能体服务。部分功能已实现并在GitHub开源。

Conclusion: ColorEcosystem为解决大规模智能体生态系统中的关键问题提供了一个可行的蓝图，通过其三个核心组件实现了服务的个性化、标准化和可信赖性，有望推动智能体服务管理的进一步发展。

Abstract: With the rapid development of (multimodal) large language model-based agents,
the landscape of agentic service management has evolved from single-agent
systems to multi-agent systems, and now to massive-agent ecosystems. Current
massive-agent ecosystems face growing challenges, including impersonal service
experiences, a lack of standardization, and untrustworthy behavior. To address
these issues, we propose ColorEcosystem, a novel blueprint designed to enable
personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service at scale.
Concretely, ColorEcosystem consists of three key components: agent carrier,
agent store, and agent audit. The agent carrier provides personalized service
experiences by utilizing user-specific data and creating a digital twin, while
the agent store serves as a centralized, standardized platform for managing
diverse agentic services. The agent audit, based on the supervision of
developer and user activities, ensures the integrity and credibility of both
service providers and users. Through the analysis of challenges, transitional
forms, and practical considerations, the ColorEcosystem is poised to power
personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service across
massive-agent ecosystems. Meanwhile, we have also implemented part of
ColorEcosystem's functionality, and the relevant code is open-sourced at
https://github.com/opas-lab/color-ecosystem.

### [134] [Reducing the Probability of Undesirable Outputs in Language Models Using Probabilistic Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21184)
*Stephen Zhao,Aidan Li,Rob Brekelmans,Roger Grosse*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RePULSe是一种新的强化学习训练方法，通过添加额外损失函数来引导采样低奖励输出并降低其概率，在期望奖励与不良输出概率之间实现更好的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准强化学习方法优化平均奖励，而减少不良输出概率的方法通常以牺牲平均性能为代价。需要改进这种权衡关系。

Method: 在标准RL损失基础上增加额外损失，使用学习到的建议来引导采样低奖励输出，然后降低这些输出的概率。

Result: 实验表明RePULSe在期望奖励与不良输出概率之间实现了更好的权衡，并且具有更强的对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RePULSe相比标准RL对齐方法和替代方案，在权衡关系和对抗鲁棒性方面表现更优。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a predominant technique to align
language models (LMs) with human preferences or promote outputs which are
deemed to be desirable by a given reward function. Standard RL approaches
optimize average reward, while methods explicitly focused on reducing the
probability of undesired outputs typically come at a cost to average-case
performance. To improve this tradeoff, we introduce RePULSe, a new training
method that augments the standard RL loss with an additional loss that uses
learned proposals to guide sampling low-reward outputs, and then reduces those
outputs' probability. We run experiments demonstrating that RePULSe produces a
better tradeoff of expected reward versus the probability of undesired outputs
and is more adversarially robust, compared to standard RL alignment approaches
and alternatives.

### [135] [Leverage Unlearning to Sanitize LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21322)
*Antoine Boutet,Lucas Magnana*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SANI是一种语言模型去记忆化方法，通过重置神经元和微调来移除模型对敏感信息的记忆，减少隐私泄露风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练大语言模型在特定任务上微调时会记忆敏感数据，存在隐私泄露风险，需要在不进行昂贵重新训练的情况下移除这些记忆。

Method: SANI采用两阶段方法：1)擦除阶段重置模型最后层的某些神经元以破坏细粒度信息记忆；2)修复阶段微调模型避免重新记忆敏感信息。

Result: 仅需少量额外的去学习轮次，模型就能被有效净化，信息泄露数量显著减少。

Conclusion: SANI为医院等行业提供了一种实用的模型净化方案，可在共享模型前有效移除敏感信息记忆。

Abstract: Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various
tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to
fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data).
These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or
confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be
regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive
information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue.
To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly
additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an
unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure
and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model
to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune
the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively
evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical
data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of
the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined
as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few
additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of
regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful
for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources
training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairImagen是一个后处理去偏框架，通过在提示嵌入空间进行操作来减轻文本到图像扩散模型中的社会偏见，无需重新训练或修改底层模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）经常复制和放大社会偏见，特别是在性别和种族等人口统计属性方面。

Method: 使用公平主成分分析将CLIP输入嵌入投影到最小化群体特定信息的子空间，结合经验噪声注入和统一跨人口统计投影方法实现多属性同时去偏。

Result: 在性别、种族和交叉设置上的广泛实验表明，FairImagen显著提高了公平性，在图像质量和提示保真度方面有适度权衡。

Conclusion: 该框架优于现有的后处理方法，为公平的文本到图像生成提供了简单、可扩展且模型无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality and diverse images from
natural language prompts. However, recent studies reveal that these models
often replicate and amplify societal biases, particularly along demographic
attributes like gender and race. In this paper, we introduce FairImagen
(https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/FairImagen), a post-hoc debiasing framework that
operates on prompt embeddings to mitigate such biases without retraining or
modifying the underlying diffusion model. Our method integrates Fair Principal
Component Analysis to project CLIP-based input embeddings into a subspace that
minimizes group-specific information while preserving semantic content. We
further enhance debiasing effectiveness through empirical noise injection and
propose a unified cross-demographic projection method that enables simultaneous
debiasing across multiple demographic attributes. Extensive experiments across
gender, race, and intersectional settings demonstrate that FairImagen
significantly improves fairness with a moderate trade-off in image quality and
prompt fidelity. Our framework outperforms existing post-hoc methods and offers
a simple, scalable, and model-agnostic solution for equitable text-to-image
generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CoD的新策略，通过注入反事实解释来实现少样本任务感知知识蒸馏，仅需少量样本就能有效映射教师模型的决策边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有任务感知蒸馏方法需要大量数据，但在实际场景中数据可能稀缺或获取成本高，需要解决少样本情况下的知识蒸馏问题。

Method: 利用反事实解释（CFEs）——能够以最小扰动翻转教师模型预测的输入，来精确映射教师决策边界。从统计和几何角度提供了理论保证。

Result: 在多个数据集和LLM上的实验表明，CoD在少样本情况下（低至8-512个样本）优于标准蒸馏方法，仅使用基线一半的样本加上对应的CFEs就能提升性能。

Conclusion: CoD策略通过反事实解释有效解决了少样本任务感知知识蒸馏的挑战，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from
complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can
be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing
methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of
data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical
scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel
strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for
few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing
counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs
that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum
perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the
teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide
theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from
both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs
can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near
the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs
effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's
decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments
across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard
distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably,
CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with
their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了零阶优化在持续学习中的应用，发现零阶优化能产生更平坦的损失景观从而减少遗忘，但会牺牲可塑性。作者提出ZO-FC方法，结合零阶优化的稳定性和一阶优化的适应性，实现内存高效的持续学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索零阶优化作为解决持续学习中可塑性-稳定性-效率三难问题的新方法，特别是在梯度计算昂贵或不切实际的场景下。

Method: 提出ZO-FC方法：对基于适配器的PEFT模块应用零阶优化，同时对分类器使用一阶优化，在保持稳定性的同时保留适应性。

Result: 实验表明ZO-FC在稳定性和可塑性之间实现了有效平衡，为设备端持续学习提供了实用且内存高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 零阶优化在持续学习中能增强稳定性但会削弱可塑性，而提出的ZO-FC方法通过结合两种优化策略的优势，成功解决了这一权衡问题。

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient
alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where
gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory
efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning
(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency
trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO
optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce
forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to
its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends
to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,
particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this
trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to
various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances
stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with
learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple
but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based
PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability
benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible
memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective
balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and
memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.

Motivation: 现有测试时适应方法主要依赖归一化层更新，但存在对小批量大小敏感、受预训练模型结构限制等问题，限制了在显著域偏移下的有效性。

Method: 引入Buffer层概念，不修改模型核心参数，保持预训练主干完整性，可无缝集成到现有TTA框架中。

Result: 实验表明该方法在缓解域偏移、增强模型鲁棒性方面优于传统方法，同时表现出强大的抗遗忘能力，在各种架构上都能带来一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: Buffer层方法有效解决了归一化层更新的根本限制，在实际域适应场景中展现出有效性和通用性。

Abstract: In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing
methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test
domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key
challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are
highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate
statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained
by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time
statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit
the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under
significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on
the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of
normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core
parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the
pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting
during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate
that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain
shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to
forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly
integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent
performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate
the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain
adaptation scenarios. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦的模块化归纳偏置——组合偏置，通过随机混合潜在变量并强制编码器发现混合策略反映的因子结构，实现了无需修改目标或架构即可解耦属性、对象及其组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解耦表示学习方法严重依赖针对特定因子的策略，当新变化因子不符合先验假设或多个因子共存时，需要重新设计架构或目标，导致显著开销。

Method: 通过因子特定的混合策略随机重新混合潜在变量，使用先验损失确保每次混合都能解码为真实图像，并结合组合一致性损失对齐复合图像与对应复合潜在变量。

Result: 在属性和对象解耦方面表现出竞争力，并独特地实现了全局风格和对象的联合解耦。

Conclusion: 该方法通过调整混合策略即可实现属性、对象及其组合的解耦，无需修改目标或架构，具有通用性和灵活性。

Abstract: Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on
factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model
architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches
result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align
with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial
exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign
architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias,
a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our
key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the
data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has
one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can
co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific
rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever
factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary
objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic
image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et
al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its
corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting
the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even
both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and
object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global
style and objects. Code is available at

TL;DR: 评估大型音频语言模型在儿童口吃语音中的表现，包括单通道源分离和儿童专用摘要生成，结合LLM评估、专家评分和BERTScore进行多维度评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 儿童语音与成人语音在声学、韵律和语言发展方面存在差异，口吃现象进一步挑战ASR和NLP系统。目前大型音频语言模型在口吃儿童语音中的表现尚未充分探索。

Method: 在访谈和阅读任务两种设置下评估多个最先进的LALMs，包括单通道源分离以隔离儿童语音，以及儿童专用摘要生成以保留临床相关口吃特征并避免成人语音泄露。

Result: 研究确定了LALMs在从混合音频生成忠实儿童专用摘要的条件和失败情况，为临床和教育部署提供实用指导。

Conclusion: 该研究为大型音频语言模型在儿童口吃语音处理中的应用提供了重要见解和评估框架，支持临床和教育场景的可靠部署。

Abstract: Child speech differs from adult speech in acoustics, prosody, and language
development, and disfluencies (repetitions, prolongations, blocks) further
challenge Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and downstream Natural Language
Processing (NLP). Recent large audio-language models (LALMs) demonstrate strong
cross-modal audio understanding; however, their behavior in disfluent child
speech remains underexplored. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LALMs in two
settings: an interview (mixed speakers) and a reading task (single child). The
tasks are (i) single-channel source separation to isolate the child and (ii)
child-only summarization that preserves clinically relevant disfluencies and
avoids adult-speech leakage.
  Evaluation combines Large Language Model (LLM) as a judge, human expert
ratings, and BERTScore (F1), and we report agreement between models and between
models and humans to assess reliability. Our findings delineate the conditions
under which LALMs produce faithful child-only summaries from mixed audio and
where they fail, offering practical guidance for clinical and educational
deployments. We provide prompts and evaluation scripts to support replication.

Conclusion: 该方法为野外电生理信号监测提供了可扩展的解决方案，能够适应全频谱特征识别并捕获任务相关信息。

Abstract: Electrophysiological (ExG) signals offer valuable insights into human
physiology, yet building foundation models that generalize across everyday
tasks remains challenging due to two key limitations: (i) insufficient data
diversity, as most ExG recordings are collected in controlled labs with bulky,
expensive devices; and (ii) task-specific model designs that require tailored
processing (i.e., targeted frequency filters) and architectures, which limit
generalization across tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce an
approach for scalable, task-agnostic ExG monitoring in the wild. We collected
50 hours of unobtrusive free-living ExG data with an earphone-based hardware
prototype to narrow the data diversity gap. At the core of our approach is
Physiology-informed Multi-band Tokenization (PiMT), which decomposes ExG
signals into 12 physiology-informed tokens, followed by a reconstruction task
to learn robust representations. This enables adaptive feature recognition
across the full frequency spectrum while capturing task-relevant information.
Experiments on our new DailySense dataset-the first to enable ExG-based
analysis across five human senses-together with four public ExG benchmarks,
demonstrate that PiMT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
diverse tasks.

Abstract: Spoken Question-Answering (SQA) is a core capability for useful and
interactive artificial intelligence systems. Recently, several speech-language
models (SpeechLMs) have been released with a specific focus on improving their
SQA performance. However, a lack of controlled ablations of pretraining data
processing and curation makes it challenging to understand what factors account
for performance, despite substantial gains from similar studies in other data
modalities. In this work, we address this gap by conducting a data-centric
exploration for pretraining SpeechLMs. We focus on three research questions
fundamental to speech-language pretraining data: (1) how to process raw
web-crawled audio content for speech-text pretraining, (2) how to construct
synthetic pretraining datasets to augment web-crawled data and (3) how to
interleave (text, audio) segments into training sequences. We apply the
insights from our controlled data-centric ablations to pretrain a
3.8B-parameter SpeechLM, called SpeLangy, that outperforms models that are up
to 3x larger by 10.2% absolute performance. We hope our findings highlight the
impact of effective data curation for speech-language pretraining and guide
future data-centric exploration in SpeechLMs.

Motivation: 现有分割模型在处理精细特征时存在挑战，特别是在室内和结构化环境中，存在多尺度处理无效、边界细化不优和特征表示有限等问题。

Method: 使用CSP-Darknet骨干网络，添加残差边界细化模块(RBRM)进行精确边缘描绘，注意力渐进上采样解码器(APUD)进行强特征集成，以及轻量级空洞空间金字塔池化(ASPP-Lite)确保多尺度上下文提取。

Result: 在GMRP数据集和自定义Gazebo室内数据集上，相比最先进模型，mIoU提升+1.26%，分割精度提升+1.65%。

Conclusion: 该方法在室内外环境中都可行，能够实现精确边界细化且对推理速度影响最小。

Abstract: Free space ground segmentation is essential to navigate robots and autonomous
vehicles, recognize drivable zones, and traverse efficiently. Fine-grained
features remain challenging for existing segmentation models, particularly for
robots in indoor and structured environments. These difficulties arise from
ineffective multi-scale processing, suboptimal boundary refinement, and limited
feature representation. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose
Attention-Guided Upsampling with Residual Boundary-Assistive Refinement
(AURASeg), a ground-plane semantic segmentation model that maintains high
segmentation accuracy while improving border precision. Our method uses
CSP-Darknet backbone by adding a Residual Border Refinement Module (RBRM) for
accurate edge delineation and an Attention Progressive Upsampling Decoder
(APUD) for strong feature integration. We also incorporate a lightweight Atrous
Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP-Lite) module to ensure multi-scale context
extraction without compromising real-time performance. The proposed model beats
benchmark segmentation architectures in mIoU and F1 metrics when tested on the
Ground Mobile Robot Perception (GMRP) Dataset and a custom Gazebo indoor
dataset. Our approach achieves an improvement in mean Intersection-over-Union
(mIoU) of +1.26% and segmentation precision of +1.65% compared to
state-of-the-art models. These results show that our technique is feasible for
autonomous perception in both indoor and outdoor environments, enabling precise
border refinement with minimal effect on inference speed.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for pretraining robotic manipulation
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models using a large corpus of unscripted
real-life video recordings of human hand activities. Treating human hand as
dexterous robot end-effector, we show that "in-the-wild" egocentric human
videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully
aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity
and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic
human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach
can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language
descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.
We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training
dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide
range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment
variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.
We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on
this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely
unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount
of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and
generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also
demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with
respect to pretraining data scale. We believe this work lays a solid foundation
for scalable VLA pretraining, advancing robots toward truly generalizable
embodied intelligence.
