### [1] [A Novel Differential Feature Learning for Effective Hallucination Detection and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21357)
*Wenkai Wang,Vincent Lee,Yizhen Zheng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出双模型架构检测大语言模型幻觉，发现幻觉信号集中在稀疏特征子集中，仅需1%特征维度即可保持检测性能，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型幻觉是重要挑战，现有研究虽发现特定隐藏层存在幻觉与事实内容差异，但幻觉信号在层间的精确定位仍不明确，限制了高效检测方法的发展。

Method: 采用双模型架构，包含投影融合块进行自适应层间特征加权，以及差异特征学习机制通过计算并行编码器间的差异来识别判别性特征。

Result: 在HaluEval数据集上实验显示，幻觉信号集中在高度稀疏的特征子集中，在问答和对话任务上取得显著准确率提升，发现浅层特征多样性高而深层特征使用集中的漏斗模式。

Conclusion: 幻觉信号比先前假设更集中，为开发计算高效的检测系统提供了途径，可在保持准确性的同时显著降低推理成本。

Abstract: Large language model hallucination represents a critical challenge where
outputs deviate from factual accuracy due to distributional biases in training
data. While recent investigations establish that specific hidden layers exhibit
differences between hallucinatory and factual content, the precise localization
of hallucination signals within layers remains unclear, limiting the
development of efficient detection methods. We propose a dual-model
architecture integrating a Projected Fusion (PF) block for adaptive inter-layer
feature weighting and a Differential Feature Learning (DFL) mechanism that
identifies discriminative features by computing differences between parallel
encoders learning complementary representations from identical inputs. Through
systematic experiments across HaluEval's question answering, dialogue, and
summarization datasets, we demonstrate that hallucination signals concentrate
in highly sparse feature subsets, achieving significant accuracy improvements
on question answering and dialogue tasks. Notably, our analysis reveals a
hierarchical "funnel pattern" where shallow layers exhibit high feature
diversity while deep layers demonstrate concentrated usage, enabling detection
performance to be maintained with minimal degradation using only 1\% of feature
dimensions. These findings suggest that hallucination signals are more
concentrated than previously assumed, offering a pathway toward computationally
efficient detection systems that could reduce inference costs while maintaining
accuracy.

### [2] [Influence Guided Context Selection for Effective Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21359)
*Jiale Deng,Yanyan Shen,Ziyuan Pei,Youmin Chen,Linpeng Huang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文影响力值（CI值）的RAG上下文选择方法，通过量化移除每个上下文对性能的影响来评估上下文质量，无需复杂超参数调优，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统因检索到的上下文质量差（包含无关或噪声信息）而效果受限，现有基于预定义质量评估指标的方法未能充分利用查询、上下文列表和生成器的综合信息。

Method: 将上下文质量评估重新定义为推理时数据估值问题，引入CI值度量上下文质量，开发参数化代理模型进行CI值预测，采用分层架构捕捉局部查询-上下文相关性和全局上下文间交互。

Result: 在8个NLP任务和多个LLM上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有最先进基线，能有效过滤低质量上下文同时保留关键信息。

Conclusion: CI值方法通过综合考量查询相关性、列表独特性和生成器对齐性，为RAG系统提供了更有效的上下文选择机制，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses large language model (LLM)
hallucinations by grounding responses in external knowledge, but its
effectiveness is compromised by poor-quality retrieved contexts containing
irrelevant or noisy information. While existing approaches attempt to improve
performance through context selection based on predefined context quality
assessment metrics, they show limited gains over standard RAG. We attribute
this limitation to their failure in holistically utilizing available
information (query, context list, and generator) for comprehensive quality
assessment. Inspired by recent advances in data selection, we reconceptualize
context quality assessment as an inference-time data valuation problem and
introduce the Contextual Influence Value (CI value). This novel metric
quantifies context quality by measuring the performance degradation when
removing each context from the list, effectively integrating query-aware
relevance, list-aware uniqueness, and generator-aware alignment. Moreover, CI
value eliminates complex selection hyperparameter tuning by simply retaining
contexts with positive CI values. To address practical challenges of label
dependency and computational overhead, we develop a parameterized surrogate
model for CI value prediction during inference. The model employs a
hierarchical architecture that captures both local query-context relevance and
global inter-context interactions, trained through oracle CI value supervision
and end-to-end generator feedback. Extensive experiments across 8 NLP tasks and
multiple LLMs demonstrate that our context selection method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, effectively filtering poor-quality
contexts while preserving critical information. Code is available at
https://github.com/SJTU-DMTai/RAG-CSM.

### [3] [Context Is What You Need: The Maximum Effective Context Window for Real World Limits of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21361)
*Norman Paulsen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究发现LLM的实际有效上下文窗口远小于宣传的最大上下文窗口，差距可达99%。不同问题类型下有效窗口大小会变化，大多数模型在1000个token内准确率就严重下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试LLM提供商宣传的最大上下文窗口在实际使用中的真实有效性，揭示宣传规格与实际性能之间的差距。

Method: 定义了最大有效上下文窗口概念，制定了测试方法评估不同大小和问题类型下的窗口有效性，创建了标准化比较模型效能的方法来找到失效点。

Result: 收集了数十万个数据点，发现MCW与MECW存在显著差异。顶级模型在仅有100个token时就可能失败，大多数模型在1000个token内准确率严重下降。所有模型都远未达到其宣传的最大上下文窗口。

Conclusion: 最大有效上下文窗口随问题类型变化，这为提高模型准确率和减少幻觉率提供了明确可行的见解。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) providers boast big numbers for maximum context
window sizes. To test the real world use of context windows, we 1) define a
concept of maximum effective context window, 2) formulate a testing method of a
context window's effectiveness over various sizes and problem types, and 3)
create a standardized way to compare model efficacy for increasingly larger
context window sizes to find the point of failure. We collected hundreds of
thousands of data points across several models and found significant
differences between reported Maximum Context Window (MCW) size and Maximum
Effective Context Window (MECW) size. Our findings show that the MECW is, not
only, drastically different from the MCW but also shifts based on the problem
type. A few top of the line models in our test group failed with as little as
100 tokens in context; most had severe degradation in accuracy by 1000 tokens
in context. All models fell far short of their Maximum Context Window by as
much as 99 percent. Our data reveals the Maximum Effective Context Window
shifts based on the type of problem provided, offering clear and actionable
insights into how to improve model accuracy and decrease model hallucination
rates.

### [4] [How Large Language Models Need Symbolism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21404)
*Xiaotie Deng,Hanyu Li*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AI未来发展需要超越简单规模扩展，需要人类符号作为指南针来引导大语言模型的直觉能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展过度依赖规模扩展，缺乏真正的发现能力，需要引入人类符号来引导模型

Method: 提出使用人类精心设计的符号作为指南针，引导大语言模型的直觉能力

Result: 通过引入人类符号指导，可以解锁真正的发现能力

Conclusion: AI的未来发展需要人类符号作为指南针，而不仅仅是规模扩展

Abstract: We argue that AI's future requires more than scaling. To unlock genuine
discovery, large language models need a compass: human-crafted symbols to guide
their powerful but blind intuition.

### [5] [One Model, Many Morals: Uncovering Cross-Linguistic Misalignments in Computational Moral Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21443)
*Sualeha Farid,Jayden Lin,Zean Chen,Shivani Kumar,David Jurgens*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文系统研究语言如何影响LLM的道德决策，发现跨语言道德判断存在显著不一致性，反映了文化错位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM主要基于英语数据训练，但在多语言多文化环境中部署时，其道德推理能力存在泛化问题，需要研究语言对道德决策的调节作用。

Method: 将两个成熟的道德推理基准翻译成五种文化和类型多样的语言，进行多语言零样本评估，通过精心设计的研究问题分析差异驱动因素。

Result: 发现LLM在不同语言中的道德判断存在显著不一致，往往反映文化错位，并识别出从分歧到推理策略的多种差异驱动因素。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了预训练数据在塑造LLM道德指南针中的作用，提出了结构化道德推理错误类型学，呼吁开发更具文化意识的AI系统。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in multilingual and
multicultural environments where moral reasoning is essential for generating
ethically appropriate responses. Yet, the dominant pretraining of LLMs on
English-language data raises critical concerns about their ability to
generalize judgments across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. In this
work, we systematically investigate how language mediates moral decision-making
in LLMs. We translate two established moral reasoning benchmarks into five
culturally and typologically diverse languages, enabling multilingual zero-shot
evaluation. Our analysis reveals significant inconsistencies in LLMs' moral
judgments across languages, often reflecting cultural misalignment. Through a
combination of carefully constructed research questions, we uncover the
underlying drivers of these disparities, ranging from disagreements to
reasoning strategies employed by LLMs. Finally, through a case study, we link
the role of pretraining data in shaping an LLM's moral compass. Through this
work, we distill our insights into a structured typology of moral reasoning
errors that calls for more culturally-aware AI.

### [6] [LLM-Based Support for Diabetes Diagnosis: Opportunities, Scenarios, and Challenges with GPT-5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21450)
*Gaurav Kumar Gupta,Nirajan Acharya,Pranal Pande*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究评估GPT-5在糖尿病诊断和管理中的表现，使用基于ADA标准的合成病例框架，结果显示GPT-5与临床标准高度一致，可作为医患双重用途工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病是全球重大健康挑战，早期识别困难，症状模糊且需要长期监测。大型语言模型的发展为提供结构化、可解释的决策支持提供了机会。

Method: 使用完全基于合成病例的模拟框架，这些病例符合ADA 2025护理标准，并参考NHANES、Pima Indians等公共数据集。测试了五个代表性场景：症状识别、实验室解读、妊娠糖尿病筛查、远程监测和多模态并发症检测。

Result: GPT-5在病例分类、临床推理生成、患者解释和结构化JSON输出方面表现出与ADA定义标准的高度一致性。

Conclusion: GPT-5可能作为临床医生和患者的双重用途工具，同时强调了可重复评估框架在负责任评估医疗领域LLM的重要性。

Abstract: Diabetes mellitus is a major global health challenge, affecting over half a
billion adults worldwide with prevalence projected to rise. Although the
American Diabetes Association (ADA) provides clear diagnostic thresholds, early
recognition remains difficult due to vague symptoms, borderline laboratory
values, gestational complexity, and the demands of long-term monitoring.
Advances in large language models (LLMs) offer opportunities to enhance
decision support through structured, interpretable, and patient-friendly
outputs. This study evaluates GPT-5, the latest generative pre-trained
transformer, using a simulation framework built entirely on synthetic cases
aligned with ADA Standards of Care 2025 and inspired by public datasets
including NHANES, Pima Indians, EyePACS, and MIMIC-IV. Five representative
scenarios were tested: symptom recognition, laboratory interpretation,
gestational diabetes screening, remote monitoring, and multimodal complication
detection. For each, GPT-5 classified cases, generated clinical rationales,
produced patient explanations, and output structured JSON summaries. Results
showed strong alignment with ADA-defined criteria, suggesting GPT-5 may
function as a dual-purpose tool for clinicians and patients, while underscoring
the importance of reproducible evaluation frameworks for responsibly assessing
LLMs in healthcare.

### [7] [Diagnosing the Performance Trade-off in Moral Alignment: A Case Study on Gender Stereotypes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21456)
*Guangliang Liu,Bocheng Chen,Xitong Zhang,Kristen Marie Johnson*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过遗忘和公平性目标的视角，分析了在减轻性别刻板印象背景下性能权衡的机制，揭示了当前公平性目标在实现权衡方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道德对齐已成为调节预训练语言模型行为的广泛采用方法，但这一过程通常以降低下游任务性能为代价。先前研究旨在通过精心设计的公平性目标实现性能权衡，鼓励模型选择性遗忘刻板印象知识，同时保持其有用性。

Method: 通过遗忘和公平性目标的视角，分析减轻性别刻板印象背景下性能权衡的底层机制，研究选择性遗忘刻板印象如何影响整体遗忘水平。

Result: 分析表明：(1) 下游任务性能主要由整体遗忘水平驱动；(2) 选择性遗忘刻板印象倾向于增加整体遗忘；(3) 减轻遗忘的通用解决方案对减少整体遗忘无效，且无法改善下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 当前公平性目标在实现性能权衡方面存在局限性，选择性遗忘刻板印象会增加整体遗忘，而现有减轻遗忘的方法对此无效。

Abstract: Moral alignment has emerged as a widely adopted approach for regulating the
behavior of pretrained language models (PLMs), typically through fine-tuning or
model editing on curated datasets. However, this process often comes at the
cost of degraded downstream task performance. Prior studies commonly aim to
achieve a performance trade-off by encouraging PLMs to selectively forget
stereotypical knowledge through carefully designed fairness objectives, while
preserving their helpfulness. In this short paper, we investigate the
underlying mechanisms of the performance trade-off in the context of mitigating
gender stereotypes, through the lens of forgetting and the fairness objective.
Our analysis reveals the limitations of current fairness objective in achieving
trade-off by demonstrating that: (1) downstream task performance is primarily
driven by the overall forgetting level; (2) selective forgetting of stereotypes
tends to increase overall forgetting; and (3) general solutions for mitigating
forgetting are ineffective at reducing overall forgetting and fail to improve
downstream task performance.

### [8] [A State-of-the-Art SQL Reasoning Model using RLVR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21459)
*Alnur Ali,Ashutosh Baheti,Jonathan Chang,Ta-Chung Chi,Brandon Cui,Andrew Drozdov,Jonathan Frankle,Abhay Gupta,Pallavi Koppol,Sean Kulinski,Jonathan Li,Dipendra Misra,Krista Opsahl-Ong,Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz,Matei Zaharia,Yue Zhang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的自定义推理模型训练方法，应用于BIRD数据库查询转换任务，在无需额外训练数据和专有模型的情况下达到了最先进的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发能够整合组织特定知识的自定义推理模型，解决企业客户面临的问题，特别是在奖励函数可验证的RLVR设置下。

Method: 采用简单通用的训练方法：精心设计的提示和模型选择，使用离线RL方法TAO进行预热，然后进行严格的在线RLVR训练。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试中，首次提交就达到私有测试集上的最先进准确率：不使用自一致性时为73.56%，使用自一致性时为75.68%，且需要更少的生成次数。

Conclusion: 虽然BIRD只是一个代理任务，但该框架的简洁性使其广泛适用于企业领域，如商业智能、数据科学和编程。

Abstract: Developing custom reasoning models via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that can
incorporate organization-specific knowledge has great potential to address
problems faced by enterprise customers. In many of these problems, the reward
function is verifiable, a setting termed RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). We
apply RLVR to a popular data science benchmark called BIRD that measures the
ability of an AI agent to convert a natural language query for a database to
SQL executions. We apply a simple and general-purpose training recipe involving
careful prompt and model selection, a warm-up stage using our offline RL
approach called TAO, followed by rigorous online RLVR training. With no
additional training data beyond the BIRD training set and no use of proprietary
models, our very first submission to the BIRD leaderboard reached
state-of-the-art accuracy on the private test set: 73.56% without
self-consistency and 75.68% with self-consistency. In the latter case, our
model also required fewer generations than the second-best approach. While BIRD
is only a proxy task, the simplicity of our framework makes it broadly
applicable to enterprise domains such as business intelligence, data science,
and coding.

### [9] [Learning to Reason with Mixture of Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21482)
*Adit Jain,Brendan Rappazzo*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出在强化学习与可验证奖励（RLVR）中使用混合token生成（MoT-G）方法，通过保留模型在候选token上的概率分布信息，显著提升了推理能力和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法在推理步骤中采样离散token，丢弃了模型概率分布中的丰富信息，这限制了推理搜索空间。本文旨在利用这些分布信息来改进推理能力。

Method: 提出了统一的MoT-G框架，将RLVR扩展到连续混合空间中生成思维链，包括构建混合嵌入作为token嵌入的加权和等方法。

Result: 在Reasoning-Gym推理任务套件上，MoT-G方法相比标准解码实现了显著改进（7/10任务提升5-35%），且仅用一半轨迹数就能达到相当精度。

Conclusion: MoT-G通过保持更高的隐藏状态熵和促进token空间探索，有效提升了推理能力和训练效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a leading
approach for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning capabilities. Most
current methods follow variants of Group Relative Policy Optimization, which
samples multiple reasoning completions, scores them relative to each other, and
adjusts the policy accordingly. However, these approaches invariably sample
discrete tokens at each reasoning step, discarding the rich distributional
information in the model's probability distribution over candidate tokens.
While preserving and utilizing this distributional information has proven
beneficial in non-RL settings, current RLVR methods seem to be unnecessarily
constraining the reasoning search space by not using this information. To
address this limitation, we investigate mixture-of-token generation (MoT-G) in
RLVR. We present a unified framework that generalizes existing MoT-G
approaches, including existing training-free methods that construct mixture
embeddings as weighted sums over token embeddings, and extend RLVR to operate
directly in this continuous mixture space for generating chain-of-thought.
Evaluating two MoT-G variants on Reasoning-Gym, a suite of reasoning-intensive
language tasks, we find that MoT--G methods achieve substantial improvements
(5--35 \% gains on 7 out of 10 tasks) compared to standard decoding with the
Qwen2.5-1.5B model, while reaching comparable accuracy with half the number of
trajectories, suggesting improved training efficiency. Through comprehensive
hidden-state and token-level analyses, we provide evidence that MoT--G's
benefits may stem from its ability to maintain higher hidden-state entropy
throughout the reasoning process and promote exploration in token space.

### [10] [Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation: Improving Classifier Accuracy with Train-Time-Only Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21487)
*Jillian Xu,Dylan Zhou,Vinay Shukla,Yang Yang,Junrui Ruan,Shuhuai Lin,Wenfei Zou,Yinxiao Liu,Karthik Lakshmanan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD)方法，通过添加分类头和推理头，在训练时利用教师模型的推理过程，测试时只使用分类头，实现推理速度与CoT相当但准确率更高的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Chain-of-Thought (CoT)提示在提高分类准确率的同时带来的推理速度显著下降的问题。

Method: 为解码器语言模型添加两个头：(1)池化分类头，用于训练和推理；(2)推理头，仅在训练时使用教师模型的推理过程进行监督。使用标签交叉熵和token级语言模型损失的加权和作为损失函数。

Result: 在七个SuperGLUE任务上，相比池化基线获得0.65-5.47%的相对提升，在蕴含/因果任务上提升更明显。推理吞吐量与池化分类器相当，比相同骨干网络的CoT解码快96-142倍。

Conclusion: DHRD方法成功解决了CoT的推理速度瓶颈，在保持高准确率的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting often improves classification accuracy, but
it introduces a significant throughput penalty with rationale generation (Wei
et al., 2022; Cheng and Van Durme, 2024). To resolve this trade-off, we
introduce Dual-Head Reasoning Distillation (DHRD), a simple training method for
decoder-only language models (LMs) that adds (i) a pooled classification head
used during training and inference and (ii) a reasoning head supervised by
teacher rationales used only in training. We train with a loss function that is
a weighted sum of label cross-entropy and token-level LM loss over
input-plus-rationale sequences. On seven SuperGLUE tasks, DHRD yields relative
gains of 0.65-5.47% over pooled baselines, with notably larger gains on
entailment/causal tasks. Since we disable the reasoning head at test time,
inference throughput matches pooled classifiers and exceeds CoT decoding on the
same backbones by 96-142 times in QPS.

### [11] [On Code-Induced Reasoning in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21499)
*Abdul Waheed,Zhen Wu,Carolyn Rosé,Daphne Ippolito*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文通过系统实验发现，代码的结构特性比语义特性对提升LLM推理能力更重要，适当的抽象（如伪代码）可以保持甚至提升性能，而不同编程语言的语法风格会影响特定任务的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究代码数据中哪些特性对提升大语言模型推理能力最为关键，为设计训练数据提供指导。

Method: 构建10种编程语言的并行指令数据集，应用受控扰动选择性破坏代码的结构或语义特性，在5个模型家族8个规模上进行了3,331次实验。

Result: LLM对结构扰动比语义扰动更敏感；伪代码和流程图等抽象与代码效果相当但token更少；即使有误导信号的损坏代码在保持表面规律时仍具竞争力；不同编程语言语法风格影响任务表现。

Conclusion: 代码的结构特性是提升LLM推理能力的关键因素，适当抽象可以优化训练效率，不同编程语言对特定任务有不同优势，为训练数据设计提供重要启示。

Abstract: Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most
responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric
framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming
languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt
structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five
model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance
on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our
results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than
semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions
like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the
same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can
often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with
misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist.
Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring
natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust
favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into
how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of
training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 印度是农业经济国家，农民需要便捷获取农业实践信息以优化农业增长和产出，传统呼叫中心资源有限。

Method: 使用句子嵌入模型构建聊天机器人系统，通过消除同义词和实体提取技术提升性能。

Result: 系统准确率从基础模型的56%提升到86%，可24/7通过电子设备访问，提供易于理解的信息。

Conclusion: 该系统能帮助农民更便捷获取农业信息，提高农业产出，同时减轻呼叫中心工作负担，让工作人员专注于更有价值的工作。

Abstract: India is an agro-based economy and proper information about agricultural
practices is the key to optimal agricultural growth and output. In order to
answer the queries of the farmer, we have build an agricultural chatbot based
on the dataset from Kisan Call Center. This system is robust enough to answer
queries related to weather, market rates, plant protection and government
schemes. This system is available 24* 7, can be accessed through any electronic
device and the information is delivered with the ease of understanding. The
system is based on a sentence embedding model which gives an accuracy of 56%.
After eliminating synonyms and incorporating entity extraction, the accuracy
jumps to 86%. With such a system, farmers can progress towards easier
information about farming related practices and hence a better agricultural
output. The job of the Call Center workforce would be made easier and the hard
work of various such workers can be redirected to a better goal.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了非洲口音英语的说话人日志在不同领域（通用对话与临床对话）的表现，发现临床语音存在显著的领域惩罚，并通过轻量级领域适应方法部分减少了错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索说话人日志系统在非洲口音英语的临床对话与通用对话之间的性能差异，特别是在存在重叠语音的情况下。

Method: 方法包括评估多个生产和开源系统，使用严格的DER协议评分重叠语音；进行错误分析；通过微调分割模块进行轻量级领域适应。

Result: 结果显示临床语音存在一致的领域惩罚，主要归因于误报和漏检错误；领域适应减少了错误但未能完全消除性能差距。

Conclusion: 结论指出需要重叠感知的分割方法和平衡的临床资源作为下一步实践方向，并提供了易于复现的领域适应方案。

Abstract: This study examines domain effects in speaker diarization for
African-accented English. We evaluate multiple production and open systems on
general and clinical dialogues under a strict DER protocol that scores overlap.
A consistent domain penalty appears for clinical speech and remains significant
across models. Error analysis attributes much of this penalty to false alarms
and missed detections, aligning with short turns and frequent overlap. We test
lightweight domain adaptation by fine-tuning a segmentation module on
accent-matched data; it reduces error but does not eliminate the gap. Our
contributions include a controlled benchmark across domains, a concise approach
to error decomposition and conversation-level profiling, and an adaptation
recipe that is easy to reproduce. Results point to overlap-aware segmentation
and balanced clinical resources as practical next steps.

*Yash Saxena,Raviteja Bommireddy,Ankur Padia,Manas Gaur*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文比较了两种大语言模型引用范式：生成时引用(G-Cite)和后处理引用(P-Cite)，发现在高风险应用中推荐采用检索中心、P-Cite优先的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域如医疗、法律等，可信赖的大语言模型必须引用可验证来源，但实践中面临在解码时生成引用还是先起草答案再添加引用的选择。

Method: 引入两种引用范式：G-Cite在一次生成中产生答案和引用，P-Cite在起草后添加或验证引用。在四个归因数据集上从零样本到高级检索增强方法进行全面评估。

Result: 结果显示覆盖率和引用正确性之间存在持续权衡，检索是两种范式中归因质量的主要驱动因素。P-Cite方法实现高覆盖率且具有竞争力的正确性和中等延迟，而G-Cite方法以覆盖率和速度为代价优先考虑精确度。

Conclusion: 推荐高风险应用采用检索中心、P-Cite优先的方法，仅在严格声明验证等精度关键场景中保留G-Cite。

Abstract: Trustworthy Large Language Models (LLMs) must cite human-verifiable sources
in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, law, academia, and finance, where
even small errors can have severe consequences. Practitioners and researchers
face a choice: let models generate citations during decoding, or let models
draft answers first and then attach appropriate citations. To clarify this
choice, we introduce two paradigms: Generation-Time Citation (G-Cite), which
produces the answer and citations in one pass, and Post-hoc Citation (P-Cite),
which adds or verifies citations after drafting. We conduct a comprehensive
evaluation from zero-shot to advanced retrieval-augmented methods across four
popular attribution datasets and provide evidence-based recommendations that
weigh trade-offs across use cases. Our results show a consistent trade-off
between coverage and citation correctness, with retrieval as the main driver of
attribution quality in both paradigms. P-Cite methods achieve high coverage
with competitive correctness and moderate latency, whereas G-Cite methods
prioritize precision at the cost of coverage and speed. We recommend a
retrieval-centric, P-Cite-first approach for high-stakes applications,
reserving G-Cite for precision-critical settings such as strict claim
verification. Our codes and human evaluation results are available at

TL;DR: ComPSum是一个个性化多文档摘要框架，通过比较用户偏好与其他用户偏好的细粒度差异来生成个性化摘要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化多文档摘要需要满足用户对写作风格和内容重点的个性化偏好，通过识别用户偏好的细粒度差异来实现有效个性化。

Method: 首先通过比较给定用户偏好与其他用户偏好生成结构化分析，然后使用该分析指导个性化摘要生成。

Result: 在PerMSum数据集上使用AuthorMap评估框架进行评估，ComPSum优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过比较用户偏好的细粒度差异可以有效实现个性化多文档摘要，ComPSum框架在个性化摘要生成方面表现出色。

Abstract: Personalized multi-document summarization (MDS) is essential for meeting
individual user preferences of writing style and content focus for summaries.
In this paper, we propose that for effective personalization, it is important
to identify fine-grained differences between users' preferences by comparing
the given user's preferences with other users' preferences.Motivated by this,
we propose ComPSum, a personalized MDS framework. It first generates a
structured analysis of a user by comparing their preferences with other users'
preferences. The generated structured analysis is then used to guide the
generation of personalized summaries. To evaluate the performance of ComPSum,
we propose AuthorMap, a fine-grained reference-free evaluation framework for
personalized MDS. It evaluates the personalization of a system based on the
authorship attribution between two personalized summaries generated for
different users. For robust evaluation of personalized MDS, we construct
PerMSum, a personalized MDS dataset in the review and news domain. We evaluate
the performance of ComPSum on PerMSum using AuthorMap, showing that it
outperforms strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的视觉语言模型作为形式化器的方法，将多模态规划任务转化为PDDL形式化语言，相比端到端规划生成有显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在简单多模态规划任务中表现良好，但在需要长序列动作的长视野规划任务中表现不佳。文本领域已证明将规划问题形式化为PDDL语言能显著提升性能，但在多模态环境中相关研究仍很缺乏。

Method: 提出了五种VLM作为形式化器的流水线，处理一次性、开放词汇和多模态PDDL形式化。在现有基准上评估，并引入两个新基准，首次考虑真实、多视角和低质量图像的规划问题。

Result: VLM作为形式化器方法大幅优于端到端规划生成。瓶颈在于视觉而非语言能力，因为VLMs经常无法捕捉到必要的完整对象关系集合。生成中间文本表示（如标题或场景图）能部分弥补性能，但效果不一致。

Conclusion: VLM作为形式化器是多模态规划的有效方法，但视觉能力限制仍是主要瓶颈。中间文本表示提供了部分解决方案，但仍有改进空间，为未来多模态规划形式化研究指明了方向。

Abstract: The advancement of vision language models (VLMs) has empowered embodied
agents to accomplish simple multimodal planning tasks, but not long-horizon
ones requiring long sequences of actions. In text-only simulations,
long-horizon planning has seen significant improvement brought by repositioning
the role of LLMs. Instead of directly generating action sequences, LLMs
translate the planning domain and problem into a formal planning language like
the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which can call a formal solver
to derive the plan in a verifiable manner. In multimodal environments, research
on VLM-as-formalizer remains scarce, usually involving gross simplifications
such as predefined object vocabulary or overly similar few-shot examples. In
this work, we present a suite of five VLM-as-formalizer pipelines that tackle
one-shot, open-vocabulary, and multimodal PDDL formalization. We evaluate those
on an existing benchmark while presenting another two that for the first time
account for planning with authentic, multi-view, and low-quality images. We
conclude that VLM-as-formalizer greatly outperforms end-to-end plan generation.
We reveal the bottleneck to be vision rather than language, as VLMs often fail
to capture an exhaustive set of necessary object relations. While generating
intermediate, textual representations such as captions or scene graphs
partially compensate for the performance, their inconsistent gain leaves
headroom for future research directions on multimodal planning formalization.

*Madison Van Doren,Cory Holland*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多语言AI模型在翻译比喻性语言时的本地化能力，发现尽管模型能生成语法正确的翻译，但在文化适应性方面仍有明显不足，特别是对习语和双关语的翻译。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM翻译研究和行业基准主要关注语法准确性和词汇正确性，而忽略了文化适应性和整体本地化质量，这对营销和电子商务等实际应用至关重要。

Method: 评估了87个LLM生成的电子商务营销邮件翻译，涵盖20种语言的24种方言变体，由母语评审员提供定量评分和定性反馈。

Result: 研究发现，即使是资源丰富的主流语言，也经常错误翻译比喻性表达和文字游戏，需要大量人工修正。

Conclusion: 数据量不是机器翻译质量的最可靠预测指标，文化适应性应作为多语言LLM性能的关键决定因素，当前学术和行业基准对此关注不足。

Abstract: This pilot study explores the localisation capabilities of state-of-the-art
multilingual AI models when translating figurative language, such as idioms and
puns, from English into a diverse range of global languages. It expands on
existing LLM translation research and industry benchmarks, which emphasise
grammatical accuracy and token-level correctness, by focusing on cultural
appropriateness and overall localisation quality - critical factors for
real-world applications like marketing and e-commerce.
  To investigate these challenges, this project evaluated a sample of 87
LLM-generated translations of e-commerce marketing emails across 24 regional
dialects of 20 languages. Human reviewers fluent in each target language
provided quantitative ratings and qualitative feedback on faithfulness to the
original's tone, meaning, and intended audience. Findings suggest that, while
leading models generally produce grammatically correct translations, culturally
nuanced language remains a clear area for improvement, often requiring
substantial human refinement. Notably, even high-resource global languages,
despite topping industry benchmark leaderboards, frequently mistranslated
figurative expressions and wordplay.
  This work challenges the assumption that data volume is the most reliable
predictor of machine translation quality and introduces cultural
appropriateness as a key determinant of multilingual LLM performance - an area
currently underexplored in existing academic and industry benchmarks. As a
proof of concept, this pilot highlights limitations of current multilingual AI
systems for real-world localisation use cases. Results of this pilot support
the opportunity for expanded research at greater scale to deliver generalisable
insights and inform deployment of reliable machine translation workflows in
culturally diverse contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: OjaKV是一种KV缓存压缩框架，通过混合存储策略和在线子空间适应来减少长上下文推理的内存瓶颈，无需模型微调即可保持或提高零样本准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型长上下文推理中的内存瓶颈问题，特别是KV缓存占用内存过大的问题，同时克服现有静态压缩方法在数据分布变化时性能下降的局限性。

Method: 采用混合存储策略：完整保留关键的首尾token作为注意力锚点，对中间大部分token使用低秩压缩，并通过Oja算法在线适应投影基，在预填充阶段全面更新，解码阶段轻量级定期更新。

Result: 在高压缩比下保持甚至提高了零样本准确率，在需要复杂推理的极长上下文基准测试中表现最强，证明了在线子空间适应在动态跟踪上下文变化中的重要性。

Conclusion: OjaKV是一个实用、即插即用的解决方案，可在不进行模型微调的情况下实现内存高效的长上下文推理。

Abstract: The expanding long-context capabilities of large language models are
constrained by a significant memory bottleneck: the key-value (KV) cache
required for autoregressive generation. This bottleneck is substantial; for
instance, a Llama-3.1-8B model processing a 32K-token prompt at a batch size of
4 requires approximately 16GB for its KV cache, a size exceeding the model's
weights. While KV-cache compression via low-rank projection is a promising
direction, existing methods rely on a static, offline-learned subspace that
performs poorly under data distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce OjaKV, a novel framework that integrates a strategic hybrid
storage policy with online subspace adaptation. First, OjaKV recognizes that
not all tokens are equally important for compression; it preserves the crucial
first and most recent tokens in full-rank, maintaining high-fidelity anchors
for attention. Second, for the vast majority of intermediate tokens, it applies
low-rank compression by incrementally adapting the projection basis using Oja's
algorithm for online principal component analysis. This adaptation involves a
comprehensive update during prompt prefilling and lightweight periodic updates
during decoding, ensuring the subspace remains aligned with the evolving
context. Crucially, our framework is fully compatible with modern attention
modules like FlashAttention. Experiments demonstrate that OjaKV maintains or
even improves zero-shot accuracy at high compression ratios. In particular,
OjaKV achieves its strongest gains on very long-context benchmarks that require
complex reasoning, highlighting the importance of online subspace adaptation in
dynamically tracking context shifts. These results establish our hybrid
framework as a practical, plug-and-play solution for memory-efficient
long-context inference without requiring model fine-tuning.

Motivation: 语言模型的黑盒特性在高风险领域应用中存在透明度问题，现有XAI方法在应用于语言模型时面临诸多限制，且现有综述未能充分捕捉语言模型架构多样性和能力演进带来的独特挑战。

Method: 根据Transformer架构类型（仅编码器、仅解码器、编码器-解码器）对XAI技术进行系统性分类，分析每种架构下方法的适应性，并通过合理性和忠实性双重标准评估这些技术的有效性。

Result: 提供了针对不同Transformer架构的XAI技术全面综述，建立了基于架构分类和评估标准的系统性分析框架。

Conclusion: 识别了开放研究挑战，并指出了未来研究方向，旨在指导开发更稳健、透明和可解释的语言模型XAI方法。

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) have significantly advanced natural language processing
and enabled remarkable progress across diverse domains, yet their black-box
nature raises critical concerns about the interpretability of their internal
mechanisms and decision-making processes. This lack of transparency is
particularly problematic for adoption in high-stakes domains, where
stakeholders need to understand the rationale behind model outputs to ensure
accountability. On the other hand, while explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) methods have been well studied for non-LMs, they face many limitations
when applied to LMs due to their complex architectures, considerable training
corpora, and broad generalization abilities. Although various surveys have
examined XAI in the context of LMs, they often fail to capture the distinct
challenges arising from the architectural diversity and evolving capabilities
of these models. To bridge this gap, this survey presents a comprehensive
review of XAI techniques with a particular emphasis on LMs, organizing them
according to their underlying transformer architectures: encoder-only,
decoder-only, and encoder-decoder, and analyzing how methods are adapted to
each while assessing their respective strengths and limitations. Furthermore,
we evaluate these techniques through the dual lenses of plausibility and
faithfulness, offering a structured perspective on their effectiveness.
Finally, we identify open research challenges and outline promising future
directions, aiming to guide ongoing efforts toward the development of robust,
transparent, and interpretable XAI methods for LMs.

Motivation: 随着AI会议投稿量激增，同行评审质量下降，需要可靠方法检测低质量评审中的错误信息。

Method: 定义错误信息评审点，构建专家标注数据集，提出自动化引擎重构弱点中的前提，使用8个SOTA LLMs评估ReviewScore。

Result: 15.2%的弱点和26.4%的问题存在错误信息，LLMs在ReviewScore评估上达到中等一致性，前提级事实性评估比弱点级评估一致性更高。

Conclusion: 自动化ReviewScore评估具有潜力，前提级事实性评估是更可靠的方法。

Abstract: Peer review serves as a backbone of academic research, but in most AI
conferences, the review quality is degrading as the number of submissions
explodes. To reliably detect low-quality reviews, we define misinformed review
points as either "weaknesses" in a review that contain incorrect premises, or
"questions" in a review that can be already answered by the paper. We verify
that 15.2% of weaknesses and 26.4% of questions are misinformed and introduce
ReviewScore indicating if a review point is misinformed. To evaluate the
factuality of each premise of weaknesses, we propose an automated engine that
reconstructs every explicit and implicit premise from a weakness. We build a
human expert-annotated ReviewScore dataset to check the ability of LLMs to
automate ReviewScore evaluation. Then, we measure human-model agreements on
ReviewScore using eight current state-of-the-art LLMs and verify moderate
agreements. We also prove that evaluating premise-level factuality shows
significantly higher agreements than evaluating weakness-level factuality. A
thorough disagreement analysis further supports a potential of fully automated
ReviewScore evaluation.

Motivation: 现有图增强检索生成方法面临根本性权衡：图方法依赖高质量图结构，但人工构建成本高昂，自动提取受限于LLM提取器性能。传统方法构建静态图索引，无法适应实际查询需求。

Method: 采用多代理系统（Constructor、Retriever、Reflector、Responser），通过查询演化和子图演化的双重演化机制，在推理过程中自适应构建目标图索引。

Conclusion: ToG-3通过动态图构建和双重演化机制，克服了传统图增强检索生成方法的静态构建限制，即使使用轻量级LLM也能实现深度精确推理。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Graph-based RAG has become the
important paradigm for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with external
knowledge. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. While
graph-based methods are inherently dependent on high-quality graph structures,
they face significant practical constraints: manually constructed knowledge
graphs are prohibitively expensive to scale, while automatically extracted
graphs from corpora are limited by the performance of the underlying LLM
extractors, especially when using smaller, local-deployed models. This paper
presents Think-on-Graph 3.0 (ToG-3), a novel framework that introduces
Multi-Agent Context Evolution and Retrieval (MACER) mechanism to overcome these
limitations. Our core innovation is the dynamic construction and refinement of
a Chunk-Triplets-Community heterogeneous graph index, which pioneeringly
incorporates a dual-evolution mechanism of Evolving Query and Evolving
Sub-Graph for precise evidence retrieval. This approach addresses a critical
limitation of prior Graph-based RAG methods, which typically construct a static
graph index in a single pass without adapting to the actual query. A
multi-agent system, comprising Constructor, Retriever, Reflector, and Responser
agents, collaboratively engages in an iterative process of evidence retrieval,
answer generation, sufficiency reflection, and, crucially, evolving query and
subgraph. This dual-evolving multi-agent system allows ToG-3 to adaptively
build a targeted graph index during reasoning, mitigating the inherent
drawbacks of static, one-time graph construction and enabling deep, precise
reasoning even with lightweight LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ToG-3 outperforms compared baselines on both deep and broad reasoning
benchmarks, and ablation studies confirm the efficacy of the components of
MACER framework.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into daily
life, there is growing demand for AI assistants that are not only reactive but
also proactive and personalized. While recent advances have pushed forward
proactivity and personalization individually, their combination remains
underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProPerSim, a new task and
simulation framework for developing assistants capable of making timely,
personalized recommendations in realistic home scenarios. In our simulation
environment, a user agent with a rich persona interacts with the assistant,
providing ratings on how well each suggestion aligns with its preferences and
context. The assistant's goal is to use these ratings to learn and adapt to
achieve higher scores over time. Built on ProPerSim, we propose
ProPerAssistant, a retrieval-augmented, preference-aligned assistant that
continually learns and adapts through user feedback. Experiments across 32
diverse personas show that ProPerAssistant adapts its strategy and steadily
improves user satisfaction, highlighting the promise of uniting proactivity and
personalization.

Abstract: Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) for question answering (QA) over
lengthy contexts is a significant challenge. In industrial settings, this
process is often hindered by high computational costs and latency, especially
when multiple questions must be answered based on the same context. In this
work, we explore the capabilities of LLMs to answer multiple questions based on
the same conversational context. We conduct extensive experiments and benchmark
a range of both proprietary and public models on this challenging task. Our
findings highlight that while strong proprietary LLMs like GPT-4o achieve the
best overall performance, fine-tuned public LLMs with up to 8 billion
parameters can surpass GPT-4o in accuracy, which demonstrates their potential
for transparent and cost-effective deployment in real-world applications.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在流式应用（如实时翻译）中的挑战，需要持续更新输出同时保持合理计算成本以满足延迟要求。

Method: 使用最近输出作为增长输入上下文的草稿，在验证阶段偏向草稿token以提高接受率，避免重复从头生成输出。

Result: 在同时文本重翻译任务中实现1.7倍加速，质量不下降，结合display-only mask-k技术显著减少80%闪烁。

Conclusion: 该方法无需草稿计算，是模型无关的即插即用解决方案，适用于加速延迟敏感的流式应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),
where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while
still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency
requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous
translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference
paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a
consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a
draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the
output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance
rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but
also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the
point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end
condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the
need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play
solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.
Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate
that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional
auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it
significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only
mask-k technique.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型音频语言模型在复杂声学场景中表现不佳，缺乏噪声抑制、声源分离等音频工具的支持，限制了其在挑战性音频推理任务中的应用。

Method: 提出Thinking-with-Sound框架，将语言推理与实时音频域分析相结合，使模型能够主动对音频信号进行数值分析和数字处理。

Result: 在MELD-Hard1k基准测试中，TwS显著提升了模型鲁棒性：小型模型准确率提升24.73%，大型模型提升36.61%，而现有模型在扰动音频上准确率下降超过50%。

Conclusion: 音频思维链能够在不重新训练的情况下显著增强模型鲁棒性，为开发更强大的音频理解系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Recent Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have shown strong performance on
various audio understanding tasks such as speech translation and Audio Q\&A.
However, they exhibit significant limitations on challenging audio reasoning
tasks in complex acoustic scenarios. These situations would greatly benefit
from the use of acoustic tools like noise suppression, source separation, and
precise temporal alignment, but current LALMs lack access to such tools. To
address this limitation, we introduce Thinking-with-Sound (TwS), a framework
that equips LALMs with Audio CoT by combining linguistic reasoning with
on-the-fly audio-domain analysis. Unlike existing approaches that treat audio
as static input, TwS enables models to actively think with audio signals,
performing numerical analysis and digital manipulation through multimodal
reasoning. To evaluate this approach, we construct MELD-Hard1k, a new
robustness benchmark created by introducing various acoustic perturbations.
Experiments reveal that state-of-the-art LALMs suffer dramatic performance
degradation on MELD-Hard1k, with accuracy dropping by more than $50\%$ compared
to clean audio. TwS achieves substantial improvements in robustness,
demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability: small models gain $24.73\%$
absolute accuracy, with improvements scaling consistently up to $36.61\%$ for
larger models. Our findings demonstrate that Audio CoT can significantly
enhance robustness without retraining, opening new directions for developing
more robust audio understanding systems.

TL;DR: SynerGen是一个统一的生成式推荐模型，通过单一生成骨干网络同时处理个性化搜索和推荐任务，在检索和排序任务上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索-排序管道存在校准问题和工程开销，现有生成模型在统一搜索和推荐时存在性能权衡。

Method: 使用仅解码器的Transformer，结合InfoNCE检索损失和混合点对-配对排序损失，提出时间感知旋转位置嵌入。

Result: 在广泛采用的推荐和搜索基准测试中相比强基线模型取得显著改进。

Conclusion: 证明了单一生成基础模型在工业级统一信息访问中的可行性。

Abstract: The dominant retrieve-then-rank pipeline in large-scale recommender systems
suffers from mis-calibration and engineering overhead due to its architectural
split and differing optimization objectives. While recent generative sequence
models have shown promise in unifying retrieval and ranking by
auto-regressively generating ranked items, existing solutions typically address
either personalized search or query-free recommendation, often exhibiting
performance trade-offs when attempting to unify both. We introduce
\textit{SynerGen}, a novel generative recommender model that bridges this
critical gap by providing a single generative backbone for both personalized
search and recommendation, while simultaneously excelling at retrieval and
ranking tasks. Trained on behavioral sequences, our decoder-only Transformer
leverages joint optimization with InfoNCE for retrieval and a hybrid
pointwise-pairwise loss for ranking, allowing semantic signals from search to
improve recommendation and vice versa. We also propose a novel time-aware
rotary positional embedding to effectively incorporate time information into
the attention mechanism. \textit{SynerGen} achieves significant improvements on
widely adopted recommendation and search benchmarks compared to strong
generative recommender and joint search and recommendation baselines. This work
demonstrates the viability of a single generative foundation model for
industrial-scale unified information access.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究使用因果推断方法分析结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响，发现粗粒度指标显示正负或中性影响，但因果分析显示在48个场景中43个无因果影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究对结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响存在矛盾结论，且评估方法存在测试场景受限、比较设置控制不足、依赖粗粒度指标等局限性。

Method: 基于一个假设和两个保证约束，推导出五种潜在因果结构，在七个公共和一个自建推理任务上进行因果推断分析。

Result: 粗粒度指标显示结构化输出对GPT-4o生成有正、负或中性影响，但因果推断显示48个场景中43个无因果影响，剩余5个中3个受具体指令影响。

Conclusion: 结构化输出对LLM生成质量的影响比先前研究认为的更复杂，因果推断方法提供了更精确的分析框架。

Abstract: Structured output from large language models (LLMs) has enhanced efficiency
in processing generated information and is increasingly adopted in industrial
applications. Prior studies have investigated the impact of structured output
on LLMs' generation quality, often presenting one-way findings. Some suggest
that structured format enhances completeness and factual accuracy, while others
argue that it restricts the reasoning capacity of LLMs and leads to reductions
in standard evaluation metrics. Potential limitations of these assessments
include restricted testing scenarios, weakly controlled comparative settings,
and reliance on coarse metrics. In this work, we present a refined analysis
using causal inference. Based on one assumed and two guaranteed constraints, we
derive five potential causal structures characterizing the influence of
structured output on LLMs' generation: (1) collider without m-bias, (2)
collider with m-bias, (3) single cause from instruction, (4) single cause from
output format, and (5) independence. Across seven public and one developed
reasoning tasks, we find that coarse metrics report positive, negative, or
neutral effects of structured output on GPT-4o's generation. However, causal
inference reveals no causal impact in 43 out of 48 scenarios. In the remaining
5, 3 involve multifaceted causal structures influenced by concrete
instructions.

TL;DR: CARB基准用于评估奖励模型的文化意识，发现现有模型存在缺陷，并提出Think-as-Locals方法通过强化学习改进文化意识建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型评估缺乏文化意识评估数据集，需要填补这一空白以推进LLM的全球对齐。

Method: 提出CARB基准覆盖10种文化和4个文化领域，并开发Think-as-Locals方法通过RLVR进行文化基础推理。

Result: 评估显示现有RM在文化意识建模上存在不足，CARB表现与下游多语言文化对齐任务正相关，Think-as-Locals能有效缓解虚假特征干扰。

Conclusion: CARB基准和Think-as-Locals方法能有效评估和改进奖励模型的文化意识，促进LLM的全球文化对齐。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs)
with diverse cultures. Consequently, evaluating their cultural awareness is
essential for further advancing global alignment of LLMs. However, existing RM
evaluations fall short in assessing cultural awareness due to the scarcity of
culturally relevant evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we propose Cultural
Awareness Reward modeling Benchmark (CARB), covering 10 distinct cultures
across 4 cultural domains. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art RMs
reveals their deficiencies in modeling cultural awareness and demonstrates a
positive correlation between performance on CARB and downstream multilingual
cultural alignment tasks. Further analysis identifies the spurious correlations
within culture-aware reward modeling, wherein RM's scoring relies predominantly
on surface-level features rather than authentic cultural nuance understanding.
To address these, we propose Think-as-Locals to elicit deeper culturally
grounded reasoning from generative RMs via reinforcement learning from
verifiable rewards (RLVR) and employ well-designed rewards to ensure accurate
preference judgments and high-quality structured evaluation criteria
generation. Experimental results validate its efficacy in mitigating spurious
features interference and advancing culture-aware reward modeling.

*Qianen Zhang,Satoshi Nakamura*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种扩展动作空间的同步机器翻译方法，通过引入四种自适应动作（句子截断、丢弃、部分摘要和代词化）来改善实时翻译的延迟和语义保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统编码器-解码器策略的READ/WRITE动作无法充分应对同步机器翻译的严格实时约束，需要更丰富的动作空间来处理实时重构、省略和简化。

Method: 在仅解码器的大型语言模型框架中实现四种自适应动作，通过动作感知提示构建训练参考，并开发延迟感知的TTS流水线来评估质量和延迟。

Result: 在ACL60/60英中和英德基准测试中，该框架持续改善语义指标（如COMET-KIWI）并实现更低的延迟（通过平均滞后测量），DROP和SENTENCE_CUT组合在流畅性和延迟之间达到最佳平衡。

Conclusion: 丰富基于LLM的同步机器翻译的动作空间为弥合人机口译差距提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) requires high-quality translations
under strict real-time constraints, which traditional encoder-decoder policies
with only READ/WRITE actions cannot fully address. We extend the action space
of SiMT with four adaptive actions: SENTENCE_CUT, DROP, PARTIAL_SUMMARIZATION
and PRONOMINALIZATION, which enable real-time restructuring, omission, and
simplification while preserving semantic fidelity. We implement these actions
in a decoder-only large language model (LLM) framework and construct training
references through action-aware prompting. To evaluate both quality and
latency, we further develop a latency-aware TTS pipeline that maps textual
outputs to speech with realistic timing. Experiments on the ACL60/60
English-Chinese and English-German benchmarks show that our framework
consistently improves semantic metrics (e.g., COMET-KIWI) and achieves lower
delay (measured by Average Lagging) compared to reference translations and
salami-based baselines. Notably, combining DROP and SENTENCE_CUT yields the
best overall balance between fluency and latency. These results demonstrate
that enriching the action space of LLM-based SiMT provides a promising
direction for bridging the gap between human and machine interpretation.

TL;DR: 提出了CaMIB模型，通过因果多模态信息瓶颈解决传统多模态学习中因数据集偏差导致的OOD泛化问题，利用因果原理而非传统似然方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于"学习注意力"的多模态学习方法容易受到数据集偏差影响，将统计捷径与真实因果特征混淆，导致OOD泛化性能下降。

Method: 1. 应用信息瓶颈过滤单模态输入中的任务无关噪声；2. 使用参数化掩码生成器将融合多模态表示解耦为因果和捷径子表示；3. 引入工具变量约束确保因果特征全局一致性；4. 采用后门调整通过随机重组因果和捷径特征来稳定因果估计。

Result: 在多模态情感分析、幽默检测和讽刺检测任务上进行了广泛实验，包括OOD测试集，证明了CaMIB的有效性。理论和实证分析进一步突出了其可解释性和合理性。

Conclusion: CaMIB模型通过因果多模态信息瓶颈方法有效提升了多模态语言理解的OOD泛化能力，同时具有良好的可解释性。

Abstract: Human Multimodal Language Understanding (MLU) aims to infer human intentions
by integrating related cues from heterogeneous modalities. Existing works
predominantly follow a ``learning to attend" paradigm, which maximizes mutual
information between data and labels to enhance predictive performance. However,
such methods are vulnerable to unintended dataset biases, causing models to
conflate statistical shortcuts with genuine causal features and resulting in
degraded out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. To alleviate this issue, we
introduce a Causal Multimodal Information Bottleneck (CaMIB) model that
leverages causal principles rather than traditional likelihood. Concretely, we
first applies the information bottleneck to filter unimodal inputs, removing
task-irrelevant noise. A parameterized mask generator then disentangles the
fused multimodal representation into causal and shortcut subrepresentations. To
ensure global consistency of causal features, we incorporate an instrumental
variable constraint, and further adopt backdoor adjustment by randomly
recombining causal and shortcut features to stabilize causal estimation.
Extensive experiments on multimodal sentiment analysis, humor detection, and
sarcasm detection, along with OOD test sets, demonstrate the effectiveness of
CaMIB. Theoretical and empirical analyses further highlight its
interpretability and soundness.

Conclusion: 语言谜题生成作为一个研究任务具有重要意义，不仅能促进语言学发展，还能支持关于稀有和未被充分研究的语言知识的传播。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a combination of novel and exciting tasks: the
solution and generation of linguistic puzzles. We focus on puzzles used in
Linguistic Olympiads for high school students. We first extend the existing
benchmark for the task of solving linguistic puzzles. We explore the use of
Large Language Models (LLMs), including recent state-of-the-art models such as
OpenAI's o1, for solving linguistic puzzles, analyzing their performance across
various linguistic topics. We demonstrate that LLMs outperform humans on most
puzzles types, except for those centered on writing systems, and for the
understudied languages. We use the insights from puzzle-solving experiments to
direct the novel task of puzzle generation. We believe that automating puzzle
generation, even for relatively simple puzzles, holds promise for expanding
interest in linguistics and introducing the field to a broader audience. This
finding highlights the importance of linguistic puzzle generation as a research
task: such puzzles can not only promote linguistics but also support the
dissemination of knowledge about rare and understudied languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出ResT方法，通过基于熵的token重加权来重塑策略梯度，优化大语言模型的工具使用策略训练，在单轮和多轮任务中均取得SOTA效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习框架仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，未考虑工具使用任务的特殊性，导致策略梯度方差大、训练效率低。

Method: ResT通过熵感知的token重加权重塑策略梯度，在训练过程中逐步增加推理token的权重，实现从结构正确性到语义推理的平滑过渡。

Result: 在BFCL和API-Bank评估中，ResT比现有方法提升8.76%，在4B基础LLM上微调后，单轮任务超越GPT-4o 4.11%，多轮任务超越1.50%。

Conclusion: ResT通过熵感知的token级策略梯度重塑，有效稳定了工具使用任务的训练收敛，显著提升了性能表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) transcend passive generation and act as
goal-directed agents by invoking external tools. Reinforcement learning (RL)
offers a principled framework for optimizing these emergent tool-use policies,
yet the prevailing paradigm relies exclusively on sparse outcome rewards and
lacks consideration of the particularity of tool-use tasks, inflating
policy-gradient variance and resulting in inefficient training. To better
understand and address these challenges, we first establish a theoretical link
between policy entropy and training stability of tool-use tasks, which reveals
that structured, low-entropy tokens are primary determinants of rewards.
Motivated by this insight, we propose \textbf{Res}haped \textbf{T}oken-level
policy gradients (\textbf{ResT}) for tool-use tasks. ResT reshapes the policy
gradient through entropy-informed token reweighting, progressively upweighting
reasoning tokens as training proceeds. This entropy-aware scheme enables a
smooth shift from structural correctness to semantic reasoning and stabilizes
convergence in multi-turn tool-use tasks. Evaluation on BFCL and API-Bank shows
that ResT achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming prior methods by up
to $8.76\%$. When fine-tuned on a 4B base LLM, ResT further surpasses GPT-4o by
$4.11\%$ on single-turn tasks and $1.50\%$ on multi-turn base tasks.

TL;DR: 提出基于语义一致性的级联系统，通过模型输出的语义共识作为可靠性信号，在保持质量的同时显著降低成本和延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 级联系统面临在开放文本生成中判断输出可靠性的挑战，因为生成质量是连续的且存在多个有效响应。

Method: 使用语义一致性作为训练免费的可靠性信号，通过模型输出的语义共识来判断是否需要向更大模型请求。

Result: 在500M到70B参数模型上验证，语义级联以40%的成本达到或超过目标模型质量，延迟降低60%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需模型内部信息，适用于黑盒API，对模型更新具有鲁棒性，为实际LLM部署提供了实用基线。

Abstract: Cascade systems route computational requests to smaller models when possible
and defer to larger models only when necessary, offering a promising approach
to balance cost and quality in LLM deployment. However, they face a fundamental
challenge in open-ended text generation: determining output reliability when
generation quality lies on a continuous spectrum, often with multiple valid
responses. To address this, we propose semantic agreement -- meaning-level
consensus between ensemble outputs -- as a training-free signal for reliable
deferral. We show that when diverse model outputs agree semantically, their
consensus is a stronger reliability signal than token-level confidence.
Evaluated from 500M to 70B-parameter models, we find that semantic cascades
match or surpass target-model quality at 40% of the cost and reduce latency by
up to 60%. Our method requires no model internals, works across black-box APIs,
and remains robust to model updates, making it a practical baseline for
real-world LLM deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在专业模型的深度分析和大型语言模型的生成流畅性之间存在权衡，需要一种能同时兼顾两者的共情响应生成框架。

Method: TRACE框架将共情任务分解为分析和合成的管道，通过结构化认知过程建立全面理解后再进行生成。

Result: 实验结果显示，TRACE在自动评估和LLM评估中均显著优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 结构化任务分解是创建更强大且可解释的共情代理的有前景范式。

Abstract: Empathetic response generation is a crucial task for creating more human-like
and supportive conversational agents. However, existing methods face a core
trade-off between the analytical depth of specialized models and the generative
fluency of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address this, we propose TRACE,
Task-decomposed Reasoning for Affective Communication and Empathy, a novel
framework that models empathy as a structured cognitive process by decomposing
the task into a pipeline for analysis and synthesis. By building a
comprehensive understanding before generation, TRACE unites deep analysis with
expressive generation. Experimental results show that our framework
significantly outperforms strong baselines in both automatic and LLM-based
evaluations, confirming that our structured decomposition is a promising
paradigm for creating more capable and interpretable empathetic agents. Our
code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TRACE-18EF/README.md.

TL;DR: 提出了KnowMT-Bench，这是首个专门评估多轮长形式问答（MT-LFQA）的基准测试，涵盖医学、金融和法律等知识密集型领域，采用动态评估设置来真实反映模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注单轮对话，而多轮对话基准通常评估其他能力而非知识密集型事实性，需要填补这一关键空白。

Method: 使用动态评估设置，让模型根据逻辑递进的问题序列生成自己的多轮对话历史，然后通过人工验证的自动化流程评估最终轮答案的事实能力和信息传递效率。

Result: 实验显示多轮上下文会降低性能：事实能力因自生成历史的上下文噪声而下降，信息效率随对话长度增加而降低。检索增强生成（RAG）可以有效缓解甚至逆转这种事实退化。

Conclusion: 该基准测试对于评估和增强LLMs在真实世界知识密集型应用中的对话事实能力具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multi-Turn Long-Form Question Answering (MT-LFQA) is a key application
paradigm of Large Language Models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains.
However, existing benchmarks are limited to single-turn dialogue, while
multi-turn dialogue benchmarks typically assess other orthogonal capabilities
rather than knowledge-intensive factuality. To bridge this critical gap, we
introduce \textbf{KnowMT-Bench}, the \textit{first-ever} benchmark designed to
systematically evaluate MT-LFQA for LLMs across knowledge-intensive fields,
including medicine, finance, and law. To faithfully assess the model's
real-world performance, KnowMT-Bench employs a dynamic evaluation setting where
models generate their own multi-turn dialogue histories given logically
progressive question sequences. The factual capability and information delivery
efficiency of the \textit{final-turn} answer are then evaluated using a
human-validated automated pipeline. Our experiments reveal that multi-turn
contexts degrade performance: factual capability declines due to the contextual
noise from self-generated histories, while information efficiency drops as
models become more verbose with increasing dialogue length. We then investigate
mitigation strategies, demonstrating that retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
can effectively alleviate and even reverse this factual degradation. These
findings underscore the importance of our benchmark in evaluating and enhancing
the conversational factual capabilities of LLMs in real-world
knowledge-intensive applications. Code is available at

Motivation: LoRA的线性特性限制了其表达能力，需要非线性扩展来提升性能。

Method: 提出LoRAN方法，对低秩更新应用轻量级非线性变换，并引入Sinter正弦激活函数来增加结构化扰动而不增加参数数量。

Result: 在摘要和分类任务上的实验显示LoRAN持续优于QLoRA，消融研究表明Sinter激活函数优于Sigmoid、ReLU和Tanh等标准激活函数。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计在低秩调优中至关重要，LoRAN通过非线性扩展有效提升了LoRA的性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a widely adopted parameter-efficient
fine-tuning method for large language models. However, its linear nature limits
expressiveness. We propose LoRAN, a non-linear extension of LoRA that applies
lightweight transformations to the low-rank updates. We further introduce
Sinter, a sine-based activation that adds structured perturbations without
increasing parameter count. Experiments across summarization and classification
tasks show that LoRAN consistently improves over QLoRA. Ablation studies reveal
that Sinter outperforms standard activations such as Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh,
highlighting the importance of activation design in lowrank tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG系统即使提供了正确和充分的上下文，LLM仍然会产生幻觉。现有方法需要大量超参数调优，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 通过分布距离量化外部上下文利用，通过跟踪transformer层中预测token的演变来测量内部知识利用，并引入统计验证框架。

Result: 在常见RAG幻觉基准测试和四个开源LLM上，LUMINA实现了持续高的AUROC和AUPRC分数，在HalluRAG上比先前方法提升高达+13% AUROC。

Conclusion: LUMINA在检索质量和模型匹配的宽松假设下保持稳健，提供了有效性和实用性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) aims to mitigate hallucinations in large
language models (LLMs) by grounding responses in retrieved documents. Yet,
RAG-based LLMs still hallucinate even when provided with correct and sufficient
context. A growing line of work suggests that this stems from an imbalance
between how models use external context and their internal knowledge, and
several approaches have attempted to quantify these signals for hallucination
detection. However, existing methods require extensive hyperparameter tuning,
limiting their generalizability. We propose LUMINA, a novel framework that
detects hallucinations in RAG systems through context-knowledge signals:
external context utilization is quantified via distributional distance, while
internal knowledge utilization is measured by tracking how predicted tokens
evolve across transformer layers. We further introduce a framework for
statistically validating these measurements. Experiments on common RAG
hallucination benchmarks and four open-source LLMs show that LUMINA achieves
consistently high AUROC and AUPRC scores, outperforming prior utilization-based
methods by up to +13% AUROC on HalluRAG. Moreover, LUMINA remains robust under
relaxed assumptions about retrieval quality and model matching, offering both
effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: RL-ZVP是一种新的强化学习算法，能够从零方差提示中提取学习信号，在数学推理基准上显著优于GRPO和其他基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法如GRPO只关注模型响应正确性不同的情况，忽略了所有响应获得相同奖励的零方差提示。作者认为这些提示并非无用，反而可以为策略优化提供有意义的反馈。

Method: RL-ZVP直接从零方差提示中提取学习信号，即使没有对比响应也能奖励正确性和惩罚错误，并通过标记级特征调节反馈以保留信息丰富、细致的信号。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准上，RL-ZVP相比GRPO在准确率上提升高达8.61分，通过率提升7.77分，并且一致优于过滤掉零方差提示的其他基线方法。

Conclusion: 这些结果突显了在RLVR中从零方差提示学习的未开发潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a powerful framework
for improving the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
current methods such as GRPO rely only on problems where the model responses to
the same input differ in correctness, while ignoring those where all responses
receive the same reward - so-called zero-variance prompts. In this work, we
argue that such prompts are not useless but can, in fact, provide meaningful
feedback for policy optimization. To this end, we introduce RL with
Zero-Variance Prompts (RL-ZVP), a novel algorithm that extract learning signals
from zero-variance prompts. RL-ZVP directly rewards correctness and penalizes
errors even without contrasting responses, modulating feedback with token-level
characteristics to preserve informative, nuanced signals. Across six math
reasoning benchmarks, RL-ZVP achieves significant improvements of up to 8.61
points in accuracy and 7.77 points in pass rate over GRPO, while consistently
outperforming other baselines that filter out zero-variance prompts. These
results highlight the untapped potential of learning from zero-variance prompts
in RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法只关注输出正确性，忽略了用户交互体验的重要性，无法捕捉用户满意度的真正机制。

Method: 识别影响用户体验的因素，在受控实验中收集不同配置下的人类评分，构建QoE导向数据库并训练预测模型。

Result: QoNext能够实现主动和细粒度的评估，并为产品化服务提供优化基础模型的可操作指导。

Conclusion: QoNext框架成功将QoE原则引入基础模型评估，填补了现有方法在用户体验评估方面的空白。

Abstract: Existing evaluations of foundation models, including recent human-centric
approaches, fail to capture what truly matters: user's experience during
interaction. Current methods treat evaluation as a matter of output correctness
alone, overlooking that user satisfaction emerges from the interplay between
response quality and interaction, which limits their ability to account for the
mechanisms underlying user experience. To address this gap, we introduce
QoNext, the first framework that adapts Quality of Experience (QoE) principles
from networking and multimedia to the assessment of foundation models. QoNext
identifies experiential factors that shape user experience and incorporates
them into controlled experiments, where human ratings are collected under
varied configurations. From these studies we construct a QoE-oriented database
and train predictive models that estimate perceived user experience from
measurable system parameters. Our results demonstrate that QoNext not only
enables proactive and fine-grained evaluation but also provides actionable
guidance for productized services of optimizing foundation models in practice.

TL;DR: EMoE训练框架解决MoE模型在推理时激活更多专家导致性能下降的问题，通过训练专家在不同组合中的协作能力，显著扩展了性能可扩展范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MoE模型在推理时增加激活专家数量反而会导致性能下降，这是因为专家之间缺乏有效的协作学习。

Method: 提出Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE)训练框架，同时训练专家在多样化组合中的协作能力，并优化路由器选择质量。

Result: EMoE将有效性能扩展范围扩展到训练时k值的2-3倍，同时将模型峰值性能提升到更高水平。

Conclusion: EMoE框架成功解决了MoE模型推理时扩展性问题，实现了在更大计算预算下的稳健性能表现。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models typically fix the number of activated experts
$k$ at both training and inference. Intuitively, activating more experts at
inference $k'$ (where $k'> k$) means engaging a larger set of model parameters
for the computation and thus is expected to improve performance. However,
contrary to this intuition, we find the scaling range to be so narrow that
performance begins to degrade rapidly after only a slight increase in the
number of experts. Further investigation reveals that this degradation stems
from a lack of learned collaboration among experts. To address this, we
introduce Elastic Mixture-of-Experts (EMoE), a novel training framework that
enables MoE models to scale the number of activated experts at inference
without incurring additional training overhead. By simultaneously training
experts to collaborate in diverse combinations and encouraging the router for
high-quality selections, EMoE ensures robust performance across computational
budgets at inference. We conduct extensive experiments on various MoE settings.
Our results show that EMoE significantly expands the effective
performance-scaling range, extending it to as much as 2-3$\times$ the
training-time $k$, while also pushing the model's peak performance to a higher
level.

TL;DR: 该论文针对土耳其语等黏着性语言的引文意图分类问题，提出了系统性解决方案，包括创建首个土耳其语引文意图数据集、采用DSPy框架自动优化提示，以及使用堆叠泛化集成方法，最终达到91.3%的最新准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解引文的定性意图对学术研究评估至关重要，但土耳其语等黏着性语言在此任务上存在独特挑战，需要专门的数据集和方法来解决。

Method: 1) 创建新的公开土耳其语引文意图数据集；2) 使用DSPy框架构建可编程分类管道，自动优化提示；3) 采用堆叠泛化集成方法，结合XGBoost元模型聚合多个优化模型的输出。

Result: 提出的集成方法达到了91.3%的最新准确率，显著优于标准上下文学习方法，解决了手动设计提示导致的不一致性问题。

Conclusion: 本研究为土耳其NLP社区和更广泛的学术界提供了基础数据集和鲁棒的分类框架，为未来定性引文研究铺平了道路。

Abstract: Understanding the qualitative intent of citations is essential for a
comprehensive assessment of academic research, a task that poses unique
challenges for agglutinative languages like Turkish. This paper introduces a
systematic methodology and a foundational dataset to address this problem. We
first present a new, publicly available dataset of Turkish citation intents,
created with a purpose-built annotation tool. We then evaluate the performance
of standard In-Context Learning (ICL) with Large Language Models (LLMs),
demonstrating that its effectiveness is limited by inconsistent results caused
by manually designed prompts. To address this core limitation, we introduce a
programmable classification pipeline built on the DSPy framework, which
automates prompt optimization systematically. For final classification, we
employ a stacked generalization ensemble to aggregate outputs from multiple
optimized models, ensuring stable and reliable predictions. This ensemble, with
an XGBoost meta-model, achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 91.3\%.
Ultimately, this study provides the Turkish NLP community and the broader
academic circles with a foundational dataset and a robust classification
framework paving the way for future qualitative citation studies.

*Yun Wang,Zhaojun Ding,Xuansheng Wu,Siyue Sun,Ninghao Liu,Xiaoming Zhai*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AutoSCORE是一个多智能体LLM框架，通过评分标准对齐的结构化组件识别来增强自动评分，解决了传统LLM评分中的准确性低、提示敏感性、可解释性差和评分标准不对齐等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM作为端到端评分器时面临的准确性低、提示敏感性、可解释性差和评分标准不对齐等挑战，这些限制了LLM在自动评分实践中的应用。

Method: 提出AutoSCORE多智能体框架，包含两个智能体：评分标准组件提取智能体从学生回答中提取相关组件并编码为结构化表示，评分智能体使用该表示分配最终分数，确保模型推理遵循类似人类的评分过程。

Result: 在ASAP基准的四个数据集上评估，使用GPT-4o、LLaMA-3.1-8B和LLaMA-3.1-70B，AutoSCORE相比单智能体基线持续提高了评分准确性、人机一致性（QWK、相关性）和误差指标（MAE、RMSE），特别是在复杂多维评分标准上表现优异。

Conclusion: 结构化组件识别与多智能体设计相结合，为自动评分提供了可扩展、可靠且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated scoring plays a crucial role in education by reducing the reliance
on human raters, offering scalable and immediate evaluation of student work.
While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong potential in this task,
their use as end-to-end raters faces challenges such as low accuracy, prompt
sensitivity, limited interpretability, and rubric misalignment. These issues
hinder the implementation of LLM-based automated scoring in assessment
practice. To address the limitations, we propose AutoSCORE, a multi-agent LLM
framework enhancing automated scoring via rubric-aligned Structured COmponent
REcognition. With two agents, AutoSCORE first extracts rubric-relevant
components from student responses and encodes them into a structured
representation (i.e., Scoring Rubric Component Extraction Agent), which is then
used to assign final scores (i.e., Scoring Agent). This design ensures that
model reasoning follows a human-like grading process, enhancing
interpretability and robustness. We evaluate AutoSCORE on four benchmark
datasets from the ASAP benchmark, using both proprietary and open-source LLMs
(GPT-4o, LLaMA-3.1-8B, and LLaMA-3.1-70B). Across diverse tasks and rubrics,
AutoSCORE consistently improves scoring accuracy, human-machine agreement (QWK,
correlations), and error metrics (MAE, RMSE) compared to single-agent
baselines, with particularly strong benefits on complex, multi-dimensional
rubrics, and especially large relative gains on smaller LLMs. These results
demonstrate that structured component recognition combined with multi-agent
design offers a scalable, reliable, and interpretable solution for automated
scoring.

TL;DR: 提出SimulSense框架，通过模拟人类口译员感知意义单元的方式，实现同时语音翻译中的读写决策，在质量和延迟权衡上优于现有方法，决策速度提升9.6倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有同时语音翻译系统需要专门的交错训练数据和计算昂贵的大语言模型推理，难以实现人类口译员般的自然读写决策。

Method: SimulSense框架通过持续读取输入语音并在感知到新意义单元时触发写决策来生成翻译，模拟人类口译员的工作方式。

Result: 实验表明该方法在质量-延迟权衡上优于两种最先进的基线系统，决策速度比基线快9.6倍，实时效率显著提升。

Conclusion: SimulSense提供了一种更高效、更接近人类口译员行为的同时语音翻译决策框架，无需专门训练数据或昂贵LLM推理。

Abstract: How to make human-interpreter-like read/write decisions for simultaneous
speech translation (SimulST) systems? Current state-of-the-art systems
formulate SimulST as a multi-turn dialogue task, requiring specialized
interleaved training data and relying on computationally expensive large
language model (LLM) inference for decision-making. In this paper, we propose
SimulSense, a novel framework for SimulST that mimics human interpreters by
continuously reading input speech and triggering write decisions to produce
translation when a new sense unit is perceived. Experiments against two
state-of-the-art baseline systems demonstrate that our proposed method achieves
a superior quality-latency tradeoff and substantially improved real-time
efficiency, where its decision-making is up to 9.6x faster than the baselines.

*Jiageng Wu,Kevin Xie,Bowen Gu,Nils Krüger,Kueiyu Joshua Lin,Jie Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统评估了思维链提示在临床文本理解中的效果，发现86.3%的LLMs在CoT设置下性能下降，揭示了临床领域CoT增强可解释性但可能损害可靠性的悖论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在临床护理中的应用日益增多，但思维链提示在临床文本理解中的有效性尚未得到充分探索，特别是针对电子健康记录这种冗长、碎片化且嘈杂的数据。

Method: 对95个先进LLMs在87个真实世界临床文本任务上进行评估，涵盖9种语言和8种任务类型，通过细粒度分析推理长度、医学术语对齐和错误模式，结合LLM评估和临床专家评估。

Result: 与其它领域相反，86.3%的模型在CoT设置下性能持续下降，能力更强的模型相对稳健，而较弱的模型性能大幅下降。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CoT在临床文本任务中增强可解释性但可能损害可靠性的关键悖论，为LLMs的临床推理策略提供了实证基础，强调了透明可信方法的需求。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care,
a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe
and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits
step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and
interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in
clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of
electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation,
which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the
first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We
assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9
languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we
observe that 86.3\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the
CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones
suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform
fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error
profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert
evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails
in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances
interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This
work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs,
highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches.

TL;DR: ThaiFACTUAL是一个轻量级、模型无关的校准框架，用于减轻泰语政治立场检测中的偏见，无需微调即可改善公平性和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在泰语政治环境中，由于间接语言、极化人物以及情感与立场纠缠等特点，大语言模型存在系统性偏见，如情感泄漏和实体偏袒，影响了公平性和可靠性。

Method: 使用反事实数据增强和基于理由的监督来分离情感与立场，减少偏见。发布了首个高质量的泰语政治立场数据集，包含立场、情感、理由和偏见标记。

Result: 实验结果显示，ThaiFACTUAL显著减少了虚假相关性，增强了零样本泛化能力，并在多个大语言模型中提高了公平性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了针对代表性不足语言的文化基础去偏技术的重要性。

Abstract: Political stance detection in low-resource and culturally complex settings
poses a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs). In the Thai
political landscape - marked by indirect language, polarized figures, and
entangled sentiment and stance - LLMs often display systematic biases such as
sentiment leakage and favoritism toward entities. These biases undermine
fairness and reliability. We present ThaiFACTUAL, a lightweight, model-agnostic
calibration framework that mitigates political bias without requiring
fine-tuning. ThaiFACTUAL uses counterfactual data augmentation and
rationale-based supervision to disentangle sentiment from stance and reduce
bias. We also release the first high-quality Thai political stance dataset,
annotated with stance, sentiment, rationales, and bias markers across diverse
entities and events. Experimental results show that ThaiFACTUAL significantly
reduces spurious correlations, enhances zero-shot generalization, and improves
fairness across multiple LLMs. This work highlights the importance of
culturally grounded debiasing techniques for underrepresented languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出MotivGraph-SoIQ框架，通过整合动机知识图谱和苏格拉底对话来解决LLM在学术构思中的基础性问题和确认偏误，显著提升构思质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在加速学术构思方面潜力巨大，但面临构思基础性不足和确认偏误的关键挑战，需要改进构思的进一步精炼过程。

Method: 整合动机知识图谱（MotivGraph）和Q驱动的苏格拉底构思器（Ideator）。MotivGraph结构化存储问题、挑战和解决方案三种节点类型，为LLM构思提供动机基础；Ideator是双代理系统，利用苏格拉底提问促进严格精炼过程。

Result: 在ICLR25论文主题数据集上，MotivGraph-SoIQ在基于LLM的评分、ELO排名和人工评估指标上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过动机知识图谱和苏格拉底对话有效解决了LLM构思中的基础性问题和确认偏误，显著提升了构思的新颖性、实验严谨性和动机合理性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold substantial potential for accelerating
academic ideation but face critical challenges in grounding ideas and
mitigating confirmation bias for further refinement. We propose integrating
motivational knowledge graphs and socratic dialogue to address these
limitations in enhanced LLM ideation (MotivGraph-SoIQ). This novel framework
provides essential grounding and practical idea improvement steps for LLM
ideation by integrating a Motivational Knowledge Graph (MotivGraph) with a
Q-Driven Socratic Ideator. The MotivGraph structurally stores three key node
types(problem, challenge and solution) to offer motivation grounding for the
LLM ideation process. The Ideator is a dual-agent system utilizing Socratic
questioning, which facilitates a rigorous refinement process that mitigates
confirmation bias and improves idea quality across novelty, experimental rigor,
and motivational rationality dimensions. On the ICLR25 paper topics dataset,
MotivGraph-SoIQ exhibits clear advantages over existing state-of-the-art
approaches across LLM-based scoring, ELO ranking, and human evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种简单的黑盒幻觉检测方法，通过分析LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为模式来检测事实性错误。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有幻觉检测方法需要外部资源或LLMs内部状态，但在黑盒场景下这些信息不可用，迫切需要有效的黑盒检测方法。

Method: 通过研究LLMs在不确定性表达下的行为，发现LLMs在给出事实性回答时生成一致响应，而非事实性回答时生成不一致响应，基于此设计黑盒检测指标。

Result: 实验表明，该指标比使用LLMs内部知识的基线方法更能预测模型响应的真实性。

Conclusion: 提出的黑盒幻觉检测方法有效解决了在黑盒设置下检测LLMs幻觉的问题，无需外部资源或模型内部状态。

Abstract: Despite the great advancement of Language modeling in recent days, Large
Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT3 are notorious for generating non-factual
responses, so-called "hallucination" problems. Existing methods for detecting
and alleviating this hallucination problem require external resources or the
internal state of LLMs, such as the output probability of each token. Given the
LLM's restricted external API availability and the limited scope of external
resources, there is an urgent demand to establish the Black-Box approach as the
cornerstone for effective hallucination detection. In this work, we propose a
simple black-box hallucination detection metric after the investigation of the
behavior of LLMs under expression of uncertainty. Our comprehensive analysis
reveals that LLMs generate consistent responses when they present factual
responses while non-consistent responses vice versa. Based on the analysis, we
propose an efficient black-box hallucination detection metric with the
expression of uncertainty. The experiment demonstrates that our metric is more
predictive of the factuality in model responses than baselines that use
internal knowledge of LLMs.

TL;DR: GraphSearch是一种新颖的代理深度搜索工作流，通过双通道检索策略解决传统GraphRAG方法在浅层检索和结构图数据利用方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GraphRAG方法存在两个核心限制：浅层检索无法获取所有关键证据，以及预构建结构图数据的低效利用，这阻碍了从复杂查询中进行有效推理。

Method: GraphSearch采用模块化框架包含六个模块，支持多轮交互和迭代推理，并采用双通道检索策略：对基于块文本数据的语义查询和对结构图数据的关系查询。

Result: 在六个多跳RAG基准测试上的实验结果表明，GraphSearch在答案准确性和生成质量方面持续优于传统策略。

Conclusion: GraphSearch是推进图检索增强生成的一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) enhances factual reasoning in
LLMs by structurally modeling knowledge through graph-based representations.
However, existing GraphRAG approaches face two core limitations: shallow
retrieval that fails to surface all critical evidence, and inefficient
utilization of pre-constructed structural graph data, which hinders effective
reasoning from complex queries. To address these challenges, we propose
\textsc{GraphSearch}, a novel agentic deep searching workflow with dual-channel
retrieval for GraphRAG. \textsc{GraphSearch} organizes the retrieval process
into a modular framework comprising six modules, enabling multi-turn
interactions and iterative reasoning. Furthermore, \textsc{GraphSearch} adopts
a dual-channel retrieval strategy that issues semantic queries over chunk-based
text data and relational queries over structural graph data, enabling
comprehensive utilization of both modalities and their complementary strengths.
Experimental results across six multi-hop RAG benchmarks demonstrate that
\textsc{GraphSearch} consistently improves answer accuracy and generation
quality over the traditional strategy, confirming \textsc{GraphSearch} as a
promising direction for advancing graph retrieval-augmented generation.

Motivation: 传统主题建模通常将异常值视为噪声而忽略，但本研究旨在探索这些异常值是否可能预示着新兴主题的出现。

Method: 使用最先进语言模型的向量嵌入和累积聚类方法，在法语和英语新闻数据集上追踪异常值随时间的演化。

Result: 结果显示异常值倾向于随时间发展成连贯的主题，这一模式在两种模型和语言中均保持一致。

Conclusion: 异常值不应被简单地视为噪声，而是新兴主题的早期信号，对动态主题建模具有重要意义。

Abstract: This paper examines how outliers, often dismissed as noise in topic modeling,
can act as weak signals of emerging topics in dynamic news corpora. Using
vector embeddings from state-of-the-art language models and a cumulative

news datasets focused on corporate social responsibility and climate change.
The results reveal a consistent pattern: outliers tend to evolve into coherent

Conclusion: TACOS分类法为临床聊天机器人提供了一种更全面、细粒度的安全框架，能够更好地处理临床和非临床查询的安全需求。

Abstract: Safety is a paramount concern in clinical chatbot applications, where
inaccurate or harmful responses can lead to serious consequences. Existing
methods--such as guardrails and tool calling--often fall short in addressing
the nuanced demands of the clinical domain. In this paper, we introduce TACOS
(TAxonomy of COmprehensive Safety for Clinical Agents), a fine-grained,
21-class taxonomy that integrates safety filtering and tool selection into a
single user intent classification step. TACOS is a taxonomy that can cover a
wide spectrum of clinical and non-clinical queries, explicitly modeling varying
safety thresholds and external tool dependencies. To validate our framework, we
curate a TACOS-annotated dataset and perform extensive experiments. Our results
demonstrate the value of a new taxonomy specialized for clinical agent
settings, and reveal useful insights about train data distribution and
pretrained knowledge of base models.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在自然语言处理方面取得了显著进展，但在处理具有模糊性、多义性或不确定性的文本时仍面临重大挑战。

Method: 引入模糊推理链（FRC）框架，整合LLM语义先验与连续模糊隶属度，在概率推理和模糊隶属度推理之间建立显式交互。

Result: 在情感分析任务上的验证表明，FRC确保了稳定的推理，并促进了不同模型规模间的知识迁移。

Conclusion: FRC为管理微妙和模糊表达提供了一种通用机制，具有改进的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), natural language
processing (NLP) has achieved remarkable progress. Nonetheless, significant
challenges remain in handling texts with ambiguity, polysemy, or uncertainty.
We introduce the Fuzzy Reasoning Chain (FRC) framework, which integrates LLM
semantic priors with continuous fuzzy membership degrees, creating an explicit
interaction between probability-based reasoning and fuzzy membership reasoning.
This transition allows ambiguous inputs to be gradually transformed into clear
and interpretable decisions while capturing conflicting or uncertain signals
that traditional probability-based methods cannot. We validate FRC on sentiment
analysis tasks, where both theoretical analysis and empirical results show that
it ensures stable reasoning and facilitates knowledge transfer across different
model scales. These findings indicate that FRC provides a general mechanism for
managing subtle and ambiguous expressions with improved interpretability and
robustness.

Motivation: 现有数据集主要关注静态AIGT检测，而社交媒体内容受用户参与驱动且随时间演变，需要研究AIGT的时间动态和用户交互模式。

Method: 构建了从LLM前时期到2025年7月的5年纵向数据集RedNote-Vibe，并提出基于心理语言学特征的PLAD检测框架。

Result: PLAD实现了优越的检测性能，揭示了人类与AI生成内容的区别特征，以及这些语言特征与社交媒体参与度的复杂关系。

Conclusion: RedNote-Vibe数据集和PLAD框架为社交媒体AIGT的时空动态分析和检测提供了重要工具和见解。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to widespread
AI-Generated Text (AIGT) on social media platforms, creating unique challenges
where content dynamics are driven by user engagement and evolve over time.
However, existing datasets mainly depict static AIGT detection. In this work,
we introduce RedNote-Vibe, the first longitudinal (5-years) dataset for social
media AIGT analysis. This dataset is sourced from Xiaohongshu platform,
containing user engagement metrics (e.g., likes, comments) and timestamps
spanning from the pre-LLM period to July 2025, which enables research into the
temporal dynamics and user interaction patterns of AIGT. Furthermore, to detect
AIGT in the context of social media, we propose PsychoLinguistic AIGT Detection
Framework (PLAD), an interpretable approach that leverages psycholinguistic
features. Our experiments show that PLAD achieves superior detection
performance and provides insights into the signatures distinguishing human and
AI-generated content. More importantly, it reveals the complex relationship
between these linguistic features and social media engagement. The dataset is

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了QCET评估质量标准分类法，旨在解决NLP领域评估标准名称不一致的问题，通过建立标准化的质量准则名称和定义体系来确保不同评估实验的可比性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP领域中，即使使用相同质量准则名称（如流畅度）的评估实验也可能评估不同的质量方面，这种名称隐含的可比性具有误导性。缺乏评估可比性判断能力阻碍了基于多个独立评估得出可靠系统质量结论的能力，限制了整个领域的科学进展。

Method: 采用严格描述性方法，从三个NLP评估调查中推导出标准化的质量准则名称和定义，并将其构建为层次结构，其中每个父节点捕捉其子节点的共同方面。

Result: 开发了QCET分类法及其相关资源，该分类法包含标准化的质量准则名称和定义体系。

Conclusion: QCET分类法有三个主要用途：(i) 建立现有评估的可比性，(ii) 指导新评估的设计，(iii) 评估监管合规性，有助于解决NLP领域长期存在的评估标准不一致问题。

Abstract: Prior work has shown that two NLP evaluation experiments that report results
for the same quality criterion name (e.g. Fluency) do not necessarily evaluate
the same aspect of quality, and the comparability implied by the name can be
misleading. Not knowing when two evaluations are comparable in this sense means
we currently lack the ability to draw reliable conclusions about system quality
on the basis of multiple, independently conducted evaluations. This in turn
hampers the ability of the field to progress scientifically as a whole, a
pervasive issue in NLP since its beginning (Sparck Jones, 1981). It is hard to
see how the issue of unclear comparability can be fully addressed other than by
the creation of a standard set of quality criterion names and definitions that
the several hundred quality criterion names actually in use in the field can be
mapped to, and grounded in. Taking a strictly descriptive approach, the QCET
Quality Criteria for Evaluation Taxonomy derives a standard set of quality
criterion names and definitions from three surveys of evaluations reported in
NLP, and structures them into a hierarchy where each parent node captures
common aspects of its child nodes. We present QCET and the resources it
consists of, and discuss its three main uses in (i) establishing comparability
of existing evaluations, (ii) guiding the design of new evaluations, and (iii)
assessing regulatory compliance.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了关于微调在模型编辑中无效的传统观点，提出通过恢复标准的广度优先训练流程和局部化调优策略，微调可以成为有效的模型编辑方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认为微调在模型编辑中效果不佳，但作者认为这种失败源于采用了不合适的深度优先训练流程，而非微调本身的问题。

Method: 提出LocFT-BF方法：1）恢复标准的广度优先（epoch-based）训练流程和mini-batch优化；2）系统分析调优位置，采用局部化编辑策略。

Result: LocFT-BF在多个LLM和数据集上大幅超越现有最先进方法，首次实现了10万次编辑和720亿参数模型的编辑，且不损害模型的通用能力。

Conclusion: 通过澄清长期误解并引入原则性的局部化调优策略，作者将微调从被低估的基线方法提升为模型编辑的领先方法，为未来研究奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: Fine-tuning, a foundational method for adapting large language models, has
long been considered ineffective for model editing. Here, we challenge this
belief, arguing that the reported failure arises not from the inherent
limitation of fine-tuning itself, but from adapting it to the sequential nature
of the editing task, a single-pass depth-first pipeline that optimizes each
sample to convergence before moving on. While intuitive, this depth-first
pipeline coupled with sample-wise updating over-optimizes each edit and induces
interference across edits. Our controlled experiments reveal that simply
restoring fine-tuning to the standard breadth-first (i.e., epoch-based)
pipeline with mini-batch optimization substantially improves its effectiveness
for model editing. Moreover, fine-tuning in editing also suffers from
suboptimal tuning parameter locations inherited from prior methods. Through
systematic analysis of tuning locations, we derive LocFT-BF, a simple and
effective localized editing method built on the restored fine-tuning framework.
Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs and datasets demonstrate that
LocFT-BF outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Notably, to our
knowledge, it is the first to sustain 100K edits and 72B-parameter models,10 x
beyond prior practice, without sacrificing general capabilities. By clarifying
a long-standing misconception and introducing a principled localized tuning
strategy, we advance fine-tuning from an underestimated baseline to a leading
method for model editing, establishing a solid foundation for future research.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: CoSpaDi是一种无需训练的大语言模型压缩框架，使用结构化稀疏字典学习替代传统的低秩分解，通过数据感知的稀疏因子化实现更灵活的权重矩阵表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩权重近似方法结构约束过于刚性，导致模型精度显著下降。需要更灵活的压缩策略来平衡计算效率和模型保真度。

Method: 使用稠密字典和列稀疏系数矩阵的结构化稀疏因子化，实现多子空间表示。利用小规模校准数据集优化因子化，最小化功能重建误差而非权重近似误差。

Result: 在20-50%压缩比下，CoSpaDi在Llama和Qwen模型上持续优于最先进的数据感知低秩方法，在准确性和困惑度方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 结构化稀疏字典学习是传统低秩方法的强大替代方案，为高效LLM部署提供了新途径。

Abstract: Post-training compression of large language models (LLMs) largely relies on
low-rank weight approximation, which represents each column of a weight matrix
in a shared low-dimensional subspace. While this is a computationally efficient
strategy, the imposed structural constraint is rigid and can lead to a
noticeable model accuracy drop. In this work, we propose CoSpaDi (Compression
via Sparse Dictionary Learning), a novel training-free compression framework
that replaces low-rank decomposition with a more flexible structured sparse
factorization in which each weight matrix is represented with a dense
dictionary and a column-sparse coefficient matrix. This formulation enables a
union-of-subspaces representation: different columns of the original weight
matrix are approximated in distinct subspaces spanned by adaptively selected
dictionary atoms, offering greater expressiveness than a single invariant
basis. Crucially, CoSpaDi leverages a small calibration dataset to optimize the
factorization such that the output activations of compressed projection layers
closely match those of the original ones, thereby minimizing functional
reconstruction error rather than mere weight approximation. This data-aware
strategy preserves better model fidelity without any fine-tuning under
reasonable compression ratios. Moreover, the resulting structured sparsity
allows efficient sparse-dense matrix multiplication and is compatible with
post-training quantization for further memory and latency gains. We evaluate
CoSpaDi across multiple Llama and Qwen models under per-layer and per-group
settings at 20-50\% compression ratios, demonstrating consistent superiority
over state-of-the-art data-aware low-rank methods both in accuracy and
perplexity. Our results establish structured sparse dictionary learning as a
powerful alternative to conventional low-rank approaches for efficient LLM
deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了对话行为脚本（DAS）框架，通过结构化对话行为表示生成多语言对话，避免直接翻译带来的文化不自然问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非英语对话数据集稀缺，现有方法多依赖英语对话翻译，这会引入人工痕迹，降低自然度和文化适宜性。

Method: 使用结构化对话行为表示来编码、本地化和生成多语言对话，而非直接翻译对话语句。

Result: 在意大利语、德语和中文上的人类评估显示，DAS生成的对话在文化相关性、连贯性和情境适宜性方面均优于机器和人工翻译。

Conclusion: DAS框架能有效生成更自然、文化适宜的多语言对话，缓解翻译腔问题。

Abstract: Non-English dialogue datasets are scarce, and models are often trained or
evaluated on translations of English-language dialogues, an approach which can
introduce artifacts that reduce their naturalness and cultural appropriateness.
This work proposes Dialogue Act Script (DAS), a structured framework for
encoding, localizing, and generating multilingual dialogues from abstract
intent representations. Rather than translating dialogue utterances directly,
DAS enables the generation of new dialogues in the target language that are
culturally and contextually appropriate. By using structured dialogue act
representations, DAS supports flexible localization across languages,
mitigating translationese and enabling more fluent, naturalistic conversations.
Human evaluations across Italian, German, and Chinese show that DAS-generated
dialogues consistently outperform those produced by both machine and human
translators on measures of cultural relevance, coherence, and situational
appropriateness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Solve-to-Judge（S2J）方法来解决生成奖励模型（GRMs）中存在的解决-判断差距问题，通过同时利用模型的解决和判断能力进行监督，在减少训练数据量的情况下实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究发现尽管GRMs具备解决问题的强大能力，但在单个查询上存在显著的解决-判断差距（14%-37%），即模型能够解决问题却无法做出正确判断，这限制了GRMs的评估性能。

Method: 提出S2J方法，在单个GRM的输出上同时利用其解决和判断能力进行监督，在模型优化过程中明确连接问题解决和评估能力，从而缩小解决-判断差距。

Result: S2J有效减少了16.2%的解决-判断差距，将模型的判断性能提升了5.8%，在使用更少训练数据的情况下实现了基于相同基础模型的GRMs中最先进的性能。

Conclusion: S2J方法通过自我进化而不依赖更强大的外部模型进行蒸馏，成功缩小了GRMs的解决-判断差距，显著提升了模型的判断性能。

Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), generative reward
models (GRMs) have been widely adopted for reward modeling and evaluation.
Previous studies have primarily focused on training specialized GRMs by
optimizing them on preference datasets with the judgment correctness as
supervision. While it's widely accepted that GRMs with stronger problem-solving
capabilities typically exhibit superior judgment abilities, we first identify a
significant solve-to-judge gap when examining individual queries. Specifically,
the solve-to-judge gap refers to the phenomenon where GRMs struggle to make
correct judgments on some queries (14%-37%), despite being fully capable of
solving them. In this paper, we propose the Solve-to-Judge (S2J) approach to
address this problem. Specifically, S2J simultaneously leverages both the
solving and judging capabilities on a single GRM's output for supervision,
explicitly linking the GRM's problem-solving and evaluation abilities during
model optimization, thereby narrowing the gap. Our comprehensive experiments
demonstrate that S2J effectively reduces the solve-to-judge gap by 16.2%,
thereby enhancing the model's judgment performance by 5.8%. Notably, S2J
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among GRMs built on the same base
model while utilizing a significantly smaller training dataset. Moreover, S2J
accomplishes this through self-evolution without relying on more powerful
external models for distillation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于测试时计算扩展(TTS)的方法来验证复杂数值声明，通过生成多个推理路径并使用验证器模型选择最佳路径，显著提升了事实核查性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在验证需要组合推理和数值推理的真实世界数值声明时存在不足，无法理解数值细微差别且容易发生推理漂移问题。

Method: 使用测试时计算扩展(TTS)从LLM中引出多个推理路径，训练验证器模型(VERIFIERFC)选择最佳推理路径，并引入自适应机制根据声明复杂度选择性应用TTS。

Result: TTS有效缓解了推理漂移问题，在数值声明事实核查上带来显著性能提升。自适应TTS实现了1.8倍的计算效率提升，相比单次声明验证方法性能提高了18.8%。

Conclusion: 测试时计算扩展结合验证器模型是解决复杂数值声明事实核查问题的有效方法，自适应机制进一步提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Fact-checking real-world claims, particularly numerical claims, is inherently
complex that require multistep reasoning and numerical reasoning for verifying
diverse aspects of the claim. Although large language models (LLMs) including
reasoning models have made tremendous advances, they still fall short on
fact-checking real-world claims that require a combination of compositional and
numerical reasoning. They are unable to understand nuance of numerical aspects,
and are also susceptible to the reasoning drift issue, where the model is
unable to contextualize diverse information resulting in misinterpretation and
backtracking of reasoning process. In this work, we systematically explore
scaling test-time compute (TTS) for LLMs on the task of fact-checking complex
numerical claims, which entails eliciting multiple reasoning paths from an LLM.
We train a verifier model (VERIFIERFC) to navigate this space of possible
reasoning paths and select one that could lead to the correct verdict. We
observe that TTS helps mitigate the reasoning drift issue, leading to
significant performance gains for fact-checking numerical claims. To improve
compute efficiency in TTS, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that performs TTS
selectively based on the perceived complexity of the claim. This approach
achieves 1.8x higher efficiency than standard TTS, while delivering a notable
18.8% performance improvement over single-shot claim verification methods. Our

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了Uni-LAP框架，通过整合监督分类模型和大型语言模型的优势来解决法律条文预测任务中的挑战，在多司法管辖区数据集上表现优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有法律条文预测方法面临显著挑战：监督分类模型难以捕捉复杂事实模式，大型语言模型在预测性任务中表现欠佳，且不同司法管辖区的法律系统多样性导致方法缺乏通用性。

Method: Uni-LAP框架通过紧密协作整合SCM和LLM的优势：SCM采用新颖的Top-K损失函数生成候选条文，LLM运用三段论推理来精炼最终预测。

Result: 在多司法管辖区数据集上的实证结果表明，Uni-LAP方法持续优于现有基线，证明了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Uni-LAP框架成功解决了法律条文预测中的关键挑战，通过整合不同模型的优势实现了更好的性能和跨司法管辖区的通用性。

Abstract: Legal Article Prediction (LAP) is a critical task in legal text
classification, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques to
automatically predict relevant legal articles based on the fact descriptions of
cases. As a foundational step in legal decision-making, LAP plays a pivotal
role in determining subsequent judgments, such as charges and penalties.
Despite its importance, existing methods face significant challenges in
addressing the complexities of LAP. Supervised classification models (SCMs),
such as CNN and BERT, struggle to fully capture intricate fact patterns due to
their inherent limitations. Conversely, large language models (LLMs), while
excelling in generative tasks, perform suboptimally in predictive scenarios due
to the abstract and ID-based nature of legal articles. Furthermore, the
diversity of legal systems across jurisdictions exacerbates the issue, as most
approaches are tailored to specific countries and lack broader applicability.
To address these limitations, we propose Uni-LAP, a universal framework for
legal article prediction that integrates the strengths of SCMs and LLMs through
tight collaboration. Specifically, in Uni-LAP, the SCM is enhanced with a novel
Top-K loss function to generate accurate candidate articles, while the LLM
employs syllogism-inspired reasoning to refine the final predictions. We
evaluated Uni-LAP on datasets from multiple jurisdictions, and empirical
results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing
baselines, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.

Method: 系统回顾了31个模型和21个基准测试，涵盖编码器专用和生成式架构，分析训练方法和评估方法。

Result: 发现当前训练方法通过对比学习偏向语言中立性，而文化意识依赖于多样化数据；三分之二的评估基准使用基于翻译的方法，存在跨语言能力差异和训练目标与评估目标之间的差距。

Conclusion: 多语言视觉语言模型需要在语言中立性和文化意识之间取得更好平衡，当前评估方法需要更多文化基础内容，训练目标与评估目标需要更好对齐。

Abstract: This survey examines multilingual vision-language models that process text
and images across languages. We review 31 models and 21 benchmarks, spanning
encoder-only and generative architectures, and identify a key tension between
language neutrality (consistent cross-lingual representations) and cultural
awareness (adaptation to cultural contexts). Current training methods favor
neutrality through contrastive learning, while cultural awareness depends on
diverse data. Two-thirds of evaluation benchmarks use translation-based
approaches prioritizing semantic consistency, though recent work incorporates
culturally grounded content. We find discrepancies in cross-lingual
capabilities and gaps between training objectives and evaluation goals.

Motivation: 现有的通用大语言模型和定制领域特定模型无法准确解决食品命名实体链接任务，需要专门针对食品领域开发的模型。

Method: 通过指令-响应场景，将文本中提到的食品相关实体链接到FoodOn、SNOMED-CT和Hansard分类法等本体，并对LLM进行微调。

Result: FoodSEM在相关模型/系统中实现了最先进的性能，与零样本、单样本和少样本LLM提示基线相比表现出色，性能优于未微调版本。

Conclusion: 主要贡献包括发布适合LLM微调/评估的食品标注语料库、发布用于推进食品领域语义理解的鲁棒模型，以及为未来基准测试提供食品NEL的强基线。

Abstract: This paper introduces FoodSEM, a state-of-the-art fine-tuned open-source
large language model (LLM) for named-entity linking (NEL) to food-related
ontologies. To the best of our knowledge, food NEL is a task that cannot be
accurately solved by state-of-the-art general-purpose (large) language models
or custom domain-specific models/systems. Through an instruction-response (IR)
scenario, FoodSEM links food-related entities mentioned in a text to several
ontologies, including FoodOn, SNOMED-CT, and the Hansard taxonomy. The FoodSEM
model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related models/systems,
with F1 scores even reaching 98% on some ontologies and datasets. The presented
comparative analyses against zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot LLM prompting
baselines further highlight FoodSEM's superior performance over its
non-fine-tuned version. By making FoodSEM and its related resources publicly
available, the main contributions of this article include (1) publishing a
food-annotated corpora into an IR format suitable for LLM
fine-tuning/evaluation, (2) publishing a robust model to advance the semantic
understanding of text in the food domain, and (3) providing a strong baseline
on food NEL for future benchmarking.

TL;DR: 提出了Reasoning Capsule框架，通过将推理计划压缩为少量潜在标记，在保持显式推理透明性的同时提高效率，平衡了效率、准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought提示虽然能帮助大语言模型进行复杂推理，但其冗长的特性增加了延迟和内存使用，且可能传播早期错误。需要一种既能保持推理透明度又能提高效率的方法。

Method: 基于信息瓶颈原则，将高层推理计划压缩为少量学习的潜在标记（推理胶囊），同时保持执行步骤轻量或显式。通过低容量瓶颈鼓励最小化，通过主任务损失和辅助计划重构损失确保充分性。

Result: 在保持或提高复杂基准测试准确性的同时，显著减少了推理过程的可见标记占用，实现了效率、准确性和可解释性的平衡。

Conclusion: Reasoning Capsule框架成功地将显式推理的透明度与潜在推理的效率相结合，为复杂推理任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs) tackle
complex reasoning by eliciting explicit step-by-step rationales. However, CoT's
verbosity increases latency and memory usage and may propagate early errors
across long chains. We propose the Reasoning Capsule (R-Capsule), a framework
that aims to combine the efficiency of latent reasoning with the transparency
of explicit CoT. The core idea is to compress the high-level plan into a small
set of learned latent tokens (a Reasoning Capsule) while keeping execution
steps lightweight or explicit. This hybrid approach is inspired by the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, where we encourage the capsule to be
approximately minimal yet sufficient for the task. Minimality is encouraged via
a low-capacity bottleneck, which helps improve efficiency. Sufficiency is
encouraged via a dual objective: a primary task loss for answer accuracy and an
auxiliary plan-reconstruction loss that encourages the capsule to faithfully
represent the original textual plan. The reconstruction objective helps ground
the latent space, thereby improving interpretability and reducing the use of
uninformative shortcuts. Our framework strikes a balance between efficiency,
accuracy, and interpretability, thereby reducing the visible token footprint of
reasoning while maintaining or improving accuracy on complex benchmarks. Our
codes are available at:

TL;DR: GTO通过树策略对齐训练解决推测解码中的草稿策略不匹配问题，提升LLM推理速度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练目标只优化单一路径，而解码时使用树策略验证多个分支，这种草稿策略不匹配限制了速度提升

Method: 提出组树优化(GTO)：1)草稿树奖励-采样自由目标，衡量草稿树在目标模型下的期望接受长度；2)基于组的草稿策略训练-稳定优化方案，对比当前和冻结参考草稿模型的树，形成去偏组标准化优势，沿最长接受序列应用PPO风格代理

Result: 在对话、代码和数学任务中，GTO将接受长度提高7.4%，相比EAGLE-3额外带来7.7%的速度提升

Conclusion: 通过弥合草稿策略不匹配，GTO为高效LLM推理提供了实用通用解决方案

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by
letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model
verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single
greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and
verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable
speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training
with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree
Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of
the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;
(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that
contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming
debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along
the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that
increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and
speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and
multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and
yields an additional 7.7% speedup over prior state-of-the-art EAGLE-3. By
bridging draft policy misalignment, GTO offers a practical, general solution
for efficient LLM inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Chain-of-Thought推理虽然能提升复杂任务性能，但因其冗长性导致推理延迟显著增加，需要一种有效的压缩方法来平衡精度和效率。

Method: 基于token弹性现象（过小的token预算反而会增加输出长度），采用多轮自适应压缩策略，为每个输入确定最优压缩深度。

Result: 相比最先进基线方法，平均精度提升5.6%，CoT长度平均减少47个token，显著降低延迟，且测试时性能可通过可解释特征可靠预测。

Conclusion: CoT压缩既有效又可预测，能够实现高效模型选择和预测，无需重复微调，为推理效率优化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves performance on complex tasks but
introduces significant inference latency due to verbosity. We propose
Multiround Adaptive Chain-of-Thought Compression (MACC), a framework that
leverages the token elasticity phenomenon--where overly small token budgets can
paradoxically increase output length--to progressively compress CoTs via
multiround refinement. This adaptive strategy allows MACC to determine the
optimal compression depth for each input. Our method achieves an average
accuracy improvement of 5.6 percent over state-of-the-art baselines, while also
reducing CoT length by an average of 47 tokens and significantly lowering
latency. Furthermore, we show that test-time performance--accuracy and token
length--can be reliably predicted using interpretable features like perplexity
and compression rate on the training set. Evaluated across different models,
our method enables efficient model selection and forecasting without repeated
fine-tuning, demonstrating that CoT compression is both effective and
predictable. Our code will be released in https://github.com/Leon221220/MACC.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gearing up to surpass human creativity. The
veracity of the statement needs careful consideration. In recent developments,
critical questions arise regarding the authenticity of human work and the
preservation of their creativity and innovative abilities. This paper
investigates such issues. This paper addresses machine-generated text detection
across several scenarios, including document-level binary and multiclass
classification or generator attribution, sentence-level segmentation to
differentiate between human-AI collaborative text, and adversarial attacks
aimed at reducing the detectability of machine-generated text. We introduce a
new work called BMAS English: an English language dataset for binary
classification of human and machine text, for multiclass classification, which
not only identifies machine-generated text but can also try to determine its
generator, and Adversarial attack addressing where it is a common act for the
mitigation of detection, and Sentence-level segmentation, for predicting the
boundaries between human and machine-generated text. We believe that this paper
will address previous work in Machine-Generated Text Detection (MGTD) in a more
meaningful way.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：ICL处理大量演示时效率低下，SFT有训练开销且缺乏灵活性。需要一种能够整合多个信息块的解决方案。

Method: 引入CompAs框架，将上下文映射为适配器参数，这些适配器可以代数合并，无需重新处理长提示。采用可逆编码方式，可通过解码器恢复输入上下文。

Result: 在多种选择题和抽取式问答任务上，CompAs优于ICL和先前基于生成器的方法，特别是在扩展到更多输入时表现更佳。

Conclusion: 可组合的适配器生成为扩展LLM部署提供了一种实用且高效的替代方案，具有推理成本低、对长上下文稳定性好等优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often seamlessly adapt to new tasks through
in-context learning (ICL) or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). However, both of
these approaches face key limitations: ICL is inefficient when handling many
demonstrations, and SFT incurs training overhead while sacrificing flexibility.
Mapping instructions or demonstrations from context directly into adapter
parameters offers an appealing alternative. While prior work explored
generating adapters based on a single input context, it has overlooked the need
to integrate multiple chunks of information. To address this gap, we introduce
CompAs, a meta-learning framework that translates context into adapter
parameters with a compositional structure. Adapters generated this way can be
merged algebraically, enabling instructions, demonstrations, or retrieved
passages to be seamlessly combined without reprocessing long prompts.
Critically, this approach yields three benefits: lower inference cost,
robustness to long-context instability, and establishes a principled solution
when input exceeds the model's context window. Furthermore, CompAs encodes
information into adapter parameters in a reversible manner, enabling recovery
of input context through a decoder, facilitating safety and security. Empirical
results on diverse multiple-choice and extractive question answering tasks show
that CompAs outperforms ICL and prior generator-based methods, especially when
scaling to more inputs. Our work establishes composable adapter generation as a
practical and efficient alternative for scaling LLM deployment.

success, the tasks and model scales at which reasoning becomes effective, as
well as its training and inference costs, remain underexplored. In this work,
we rely on a synthetic data distillation framework to conduct a large-scale
supervised study. We compare Instruction Fine-Tuning (IFT) and reasoning models
of varying sizes, on a wide range of math-centric and general-purpose tasks,
evaluating both multiple-choice and open-ended formats. Our analysis reveals
that reasoning consistently improves model performance, often matching or
surpassing significantly larger IFT systems. Notably, while IFT remains
Pareto-optimal in training and inference costs, reasoning models become
increasingly valuable as model size scales, overcoming IFT performance limits
on reasoning-intensive and open-ended tasks.

### [71] [The Outputs of Large Language Models are Meaningless](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22206)
*Anandi Hattiangadi,Anders J. Schoubye*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出一个简单论证，认为大型语言模型的输出是无意义的，基于两个前提：(a)需要特定意图才能使LLM输出具有字面意义，(b)LLM不可能拥有正确的意图类型


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型输出的语义地位问题，质疑其是否真正具有意义，而非仅仅看似有意义

Method: 采用哲学论证方法，基于意图理论和语义理论，分析LLM输出的语义条件，并回应各种反对观点

Result: 论证了LLM输出缺乏真正意义，但承认这些输出在表面上显得有意义，并能用于获取真实信念和知识

Conclusion: 虽然LLM输出在严格意义上无意义，但其表面意义和实用价值仍然重要，这揭示了意义与实用功能之间的区别

Abstract: In this paper, we offer a simple argument for the conclusion that the outputs
of large language models (LLMs) are meaningless. Our argument is based on two
key premises: (a) that certain kinds of intentions are needed in order for
LLMs' outputs to have literal meanings, and (b) that LLMs cannot plausibly have
the right kinds of intentions. We defend this argument from various types of
responses, for example, the semantic externalist argument that deference can be
assumed to take the place of intentions and the semantic internalist argument
that meanings can be defined purely in terms of intrinsic relations between
concepts, such as conceptual roles. We conclude the paper by discussing why,
even if our argument is sound, the outputs of LLMs nevertheless seem meaningful
and can be used to acquire true beliefs and even knowledge.

*Tiago Fernandes Tavares*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了递归主题划分(RTP)框架，利用大语言模型构建二叉树，通过自然语言问题对文本语料进行语义划分，生成完全可解释的主题分类体系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统主题模型在数据稀缺领域表现不佳的问题，传统模型使用关键词列表描述聚类，需要大量人工解释且缺乏语义连贯性。

Method: 使用大语言模型交互式构建二叉树，每个节点都是自然语言问题，对数据进行语义划分，形成可解释的分类体系。

Result: RTP的问题驱动层次结构比BERTopic等基线模型的关键词主题更具可解释性，这些聚类在下游分类任务中作为强大特征，特别是当数据主题与任务标签相关时。

Conclusion: RTP引入了数据探索的新范式，从统计模式发现转向知识驱动的主题分析，主题路径可作为生成模型的结构化可控提示，实现源语料库特定特征的一致模仿。

Abstract: Unsupervised analysis of text corpora is challenging, especially in
data-scarce domains where traditional topic models struggle. While these models
offer a solution, they typically describe clusters with lists of keywords that
require significant manual effort to interpret and often lack semantic
coherence. To address this critical interpretability gap, we introduce
Recursive Thematic Partitioning (RTP), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) to interactively build a binary tree. Each node in the
tree is a natural language question that semantically partitions the data,
resulting in a fully interpretable taxonomy where the logic of each cluster is
explicit. Our experiments demonstrate that RTP's question-driven hierarchy is
more interpretable than the keyword-based topics from a strong baseline like
BERTopic. Furthermore, we establish the quantitative utility of these clusters
by showing they serve as powerful features in downstream classification tasks,
particularly when the data's underlying themes correlate with the task labels.
RTP introduces a new paradigm for data exploration, shifting the focus from
statistical pattern discovery to knowledge-driven thematic analysis.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that the thematic paths from the RTP tree can serve
as structured, controllable prompts for generative models. This transforms our
analytical framework into a powerful tool for synthesis, enabling the
consistent imitation of specific characteristics discovered in the source
corpus.

*Yuhan Song,Linhao Zhang,Chuhan Wu,Aiwei Liu,Wei Jia,Houfeng Wang,Xiao Zhou*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 现有语义语音分词器对不相关声学扰动非常脆弱，导致下游LLM学习负担增加。作者提出StableToken，通过多分支架构和位级投票机制实现稳定分词，显著提升在各种噪声条件下的稳定性，并改善SpeechLLM的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语义语音分词器在捕捉语言内容时，对不相关的声学扰动异常脆弱，即使在高信噪比下语音可懂度完好，分词序列也会剧烈变化，增加了下游LLM的学习负担。

Method: 提出StableToken分词器，采用多分支并行处理音频，通过强大的位级投票机制合并表示，形成单一稳定的分词序列。

Result: StableToken在分词稳定性方面达到新SOTA，在各种噪声条件下显著降低单元编辑距离（UED）。这种基础稳定性直接转化为下游效益，显著提升SpeechLLM在各种任务上的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: StableToken通过共识驱动机制解决了语义语音分词器的脆弱性问题，为下游语音语言模型提供了更稳定的基础，提升了整体系统的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic speech tokenizers, designed to capture linguistic content,
are surprisingly fragile. We find they are not robust to meaning-irrelevant
acoustic perturbations; even at high Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs) where speech
is perfectly intelligible, their output token sequences can change drastically,
increasing the learning burden for downstream LLMs. This instability stems from
two flaws: a brittle single-path quantization architecture and a distant
training signal indifferent to intermediate token stability. To address this,
we introduce StableToken, a tokenizer that achieves stability through a
consensus-driven mechanism. Its multi-branch architecture processes audio in
parallel, and these representations are merged via a powerful bit-wise voting
mechanism to form a single, stable token sequence. StableToken sets a new
state-of-the-art in token stability, drastically reducing Unit Edit Distance
(UED) under diverse noise conditions. This foundational stability translates
directly to downstream benefits, significantly improving the robustness of
SpeechLLMs on a variety of tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出Composite Reasoning(CR)方法，让大语言模型动态组合多种推理风格（演绎、归纳、溯因等），在科学和医学问答任务中优于现有方法，展现出更好的样本效率和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型依赖单一的推理范式，限制了其在需要多样化认知策略的复杂问题上的表现。

Method: 引入Composite Reasoning方法，使LLMs能够动态探索和组合多种推理风格，如演绎、归纳和溯因推理。

Result: 在科学和医学问答基准测试中，CR方法优于Chain-of-Thought和DeepSeek-R1等现有基线，表现出更好的样本效率和适当的token使用。

Conclusion: 通过培养内部推理风格的多样性，大语言模型获得了更强大、自适应和高效的问题解决能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their remarkable capabilities, rely on
singular, pre-dominant reasoning paradigms, hindering their performance on
intricate problems that demand diverse cognitive strategies. To address this,
we introduce Composite Reasoning (CR), a novel reasoning approach empowering
LLMs to dynamically explore and combine multiple reasoning styles like
deductive, inductive, and abductive for more nuanced problem-solving. Evaluated
on scientific and medical question-answering benchmarks, our approach
outperforms existing baselines like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and also surpasses
the accuracy of DeepSeek-R1 style reasoning (SR) capabilities, while
demonstrating superior sample efficiency and adequate token usage. Notably, CR
adaptively emphasizes domain-appropriate reasoning styles. It prioritizes
abductive and deductive reasoning for medical question answering, but shifts to
causal, deductive, and inductive methods for scientific reasoning. Our findings
highlight that by cultivating internal reasoning style diversity, LLMs acquire
more robust, adaptive, and efficient problem-solving abilities.

*Jaehoon Kim,Kwangwook Seo,Dongha Lee*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出反向推测解码(RSD)方法，通过让学生模型基于自身概率分布过滤教师模型生成的低概率token，解决大模型向小模型迁移推理能力时的分布不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督微调方法在将大语言模型的推理能力迁移到小模型时常常失败，因为教师模型的推理轨迹中包含小模型分布下低概率的token，超出了小模型的内部表示能力。

Method: 提出反向推测解码(RSD)：教师模型提出候选token，但由学生模型根据自身概率分布决定是否接受，过滤掉低概率token，生成学生友好的推理轨迹。

Result: 在Qwen3-0.6B上的实验表明，直接蒸馏s1K-1.1推理轨迹数据使性能下降20.5%，而使用RSD生成的推理轨迹训练则提升4.9%。跨模型实验显示RSD轨迹具有模型特异性。

Conclusion: 低概率token是推理能力迁移的关键瓶颈，分布对齐需要针对每个学生架构的独特内部表示进行定制。

Abstract: Transferring reasoning capabilities from larger language models to smaller
ones through supervised fine-tuning often fails counterintuitively, with
performance degrading despite access to high-quality teacher demonstrations. We
identify that this failure stems from distributional misalignment: reasoning
traces from larger models contain tokens that are low probability under the
student's distribution, exceeding the internal representation capacity of
smaller architectures and creating learning barriers rather than helpful
guidance. We propose Reverse Speculative Decoding (RSD), a mechanism for
generating student-friendly reasoning traces in which the teacher model
proposes candidate tokens but the student model determines acceptance based on
its own probability distributions, filtering low probability tokens. When
applied to Qwen3-0.6B, direct distillation of s1K-1.1 reasoning trace data
degrades average performance across major reasoning benchmarks by 20.5\%, while
the same model trained on RSD-generated reasoning traces achieves meaningful
improvements of 4.9\%. Our analysis reveals that low probability tokens
constitute the critical bottleneck in reasoning ability transfer. However,
cross-model experiments demonstrate that RSD traces are model-specific rather
than universally applicable, indicating that distributional alignment must be
tailored for each student architecture's unique internal representation.

TL;DR: 提出了FeatBench基准测试，专门评估大语言模型在"氛围编程"范式下的功能实现能力，弥补现有基准测试的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码生成基准测试无法充分评估智能体在氛围编程范式下的能力，它们要么需要代码级规范，要么过于关注问题解决，忽略了功能实现这一关键场景。

Method: 构建FeatBench基准测试，具有纯自然语言提示、严格的数据收集流程、全面的测试用例和多样化的应用领域等特征。

Result: 评估显示氛围编程范式下的功能实现具有显著挑战性，最高成功率仅为29.94%，并发现了"激进实现"的策略倾向。

Conclusion: FeatBench基准测试为社区研究提供了重要工具，揭示了氛围编程中功能实现的挑战性和独特特征。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has given rise to a
novel software development paradigm known as "vibe coding," where users
interact with coding agents through high-level natural language. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks for code generation inadequately assess an
agent's vibe coding capabilities. Existing benchmarks are misaligned, as they
either require code-level specifications or focus narrowly on issue-solving,
neglecting the critical scenario of feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradiam. To address this gap, we propose FeatBench, a novel benchmark
for vibe coding that focuses on feature implementation. Our benchmark is
distinguished by several key features: 1. Pure Natural Language Prompts. Task
inputs consist solely of abstract natural language descriptions, devoid of any
code or structural hints. 2. A Rigorous & Evolving Data Collection Process.
FeatBench is built on a multi-level filtering pipeline to ensure quality and a
fully automated pipeline to evolve the benchmark, mitigating data
contamination. 3. Comprehensive Test Cases. Each task includes Fail-to-Pass
(F2P) and Pass-to-Pass (P2P) tests to verify correctness and prevent
regressions. 4. Diverse Application Domains. The benchmark includes
repositories from diverse domains to ensure it reflects real-world scenarios.
We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on
FeatBench. Our evaluation reveals that feature implementation within the vibe
coding paradigm is a significant challenge, with the highest success rate of
only 29.94%. Our analysis also reveals a tendency for "aggressive
implementation," a strategy that paradoxically leads to both critical failures
and superior software design. We release FeatBench, our automated collection
pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community
research.

Motivation: 全双工语音对话LLM是实现自然人机交互的基础，但目前缺乏专门的基准测试来评估这些模型，特别是在紧急中断场景下的表现。

Method: 开发FLEXI基准测试，包含6种不同的人-LLM交互场景，系统评估实时对话的延迟、质量和对话效果，重点关注模型在紧急情况下的中断能力。

Result: 开源模型和商业模型在紧急意识、轮次终止和交互延迟方面存在显著差距，揭示了当前全双工语音对话系统的局限性。

Conclusion: 下一对令牌预测为实现真正无缝、类人的全双工交互提供了有前景的技术路径。

Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech-to-Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) are foundational to
natural human-computer interaction, enabling real-time spoken dialogue systems.
However, benchmarking and modeling these models remains a fundamental
challenge. We introduce FLEXI, the first benchmark for full-duplex LLM-human
spoken interaction that explicitly incorporates model interruption in emergency
scenarios. FLEXI systematically evaluates the latency, quality, and
conversational effectiveness of real-time dialogue through six diverse
human-LLM interaction scenarios, revealing significant gaps between open source
and commercial models in emergency awareness, turn terminating, and interaction
latency. Finally, we suggest that next token-pair prediction offers a promising
path toward achieving truly seamless and human-like full-duplex interaction.

TL;DR: 本文从法律合规角度解决LLM安全问题，提出安全合规概念，基于欧盟AI法案和GDPR构建新基准，并通过GRPO方法训练Compliance Reasoner模型，在基准测试中分别获得10.45%和11.85%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全方法依赖临时分类法，缺乏系统化保护，无法应对现代LLM系统的复杂行为。需要从法律合规角度建立更严谨的安全标准。

Method: 1. 基于欧盟AI法案和GDPR构建安全合规基准；2. 使用GRPO方法对齐Qwen3-8B模型，构建Compliance Reasoner安全推理器。

Result: Compliance Reasoner在新基准上表现优异，欧盟AI法案平均提升10.45%，GDPR平均提升11.85%。

Conclusion: 法律合规框架为LLM安全提供了系统化标准，Compliance Reasoner能有效对齐LLM与法律标准，降低安全风险。

Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated remarkable
capabilities, elevating the critical importance of LLM safety. However,
existing safety methods rely on ad-hoc taxonomy and lack a rigorous, systematic
protection, failing to ensure safety for the nuanced and complex behaviors of
modern LLM systems. To address this problem, we solve LLM safety from legal
compliance perspectives, named safety compliance. In this work, we posit
relevant established legal frameworks as safety standards for defining and
measuring safety compliance, including the EU AI Act and GDPR, which serve as
core legal frameworks for AI safety and data security in Europe. To bridge the
gap between LLM safety and legal compliance, we first develop a new benchmark
for safety compliance by generating realistic LLM safety scenarios seeded with
legal statutes. Subsequently, we align Qwen3-8B using Group Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to construct a safety reasoner, Compliance Reasoner, which effectively
aligns LLMs with legal standards to mitigate safety risks. Our comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the Compliance Reasoner achieves superior
performance on the new benchmark, with average improvements of +10.45% for the
EU AI Act and +11.85% for GDPR.

TL;DR: SSKG-LLM是一个创新的模型架构，旨在将知识图谱的结构和语义信息有效整合到大型语言模型的推理过程中，解决幻觉问题和嵌入空间差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs处理幻觉问题主要通过知识图谱，但通常只提取语义信息而忽略结构信息，且KG编码器与LLMs文本嵌入空间存在差距，阻碍了结构化知识的有效整合。

Method: 提出SSKG-LLM架构，包含知识图谱检索(KGR)模块、知识图谱编码(KGE)模块来保持语义并利用结构，以及知识图谱适应(KGA)模块使LLMs能够理解KG嵌入。

Result: 通过广泛实验和详细分析，探索了整合KG结构信息如何增强LLMs的事实推理能力。

Conclusion: SSKG-LLM能够有效整合知识图谱的结构和语义信息，提升大型语言模型的事实推理能力，解决幻觉问题。

Abstract: Currently, the main approach for Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle the
hallucination issue is incorporating Knowledge Graphs(KGs).However, LLMs
typically treat KGs as plain text, extracting only semantic information and
limiting their use of the crucial structural aspects of KGs. Another challenge
is the gap between the embedding spaces of KGs encoders and LLMs text
embeddings, which hinders the effective integration of structured knowledge. To
overcome these obstacles, we put forward the SSKG-LLM, an innovative model
architecture that is designed to efficiently integrate both the Structural and
Semantic information of KGs into the reasoning processes of LLMs. SSKG-LLM
incorporates the Knowledge Graph Retrieval (KGR) module and the Knowledge Graph
Encoding (KGE) module to preserve semantics while utilizing structure. Then,
the Knowledge Graph Adaptation (KGA) module is incorporated to enable LLMs to
understand KGs embeddings. We conduct extensive experiments and provide a
detailed analysis to explore how incorporating the structural information of
KGs can enhance the factual reasoning abilities of LLMs. Our code are available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NLP模型经常从训练数据中复制或放大社会偏见，而其黑盒特性使得用户难以识别偏见预测，开发者难以有效缓解偏见。现有关于公平NLP可解释性的研究主要是定性的，缺乏大规模定量分析。

Method: 在仇恨言论检测中，对编码器和仅解码器模型进行系统研究，考察三个关键维度：(1)识别偏见预测，(2)选择公平模型，(3)在模型训练中缓解偏见。

Result: 基于输入的解释能有效检测偏见预测，并可作为减少训练中偏见的有用监督，但在候选模型中选择公平模型方面不可靠。

Conclusion: 可解释性工具在识别和缓解偏见方面具有实用价值，但在模型选择方面需要谨慎使用。

Abstract: Natural language processing (NLP) models often replicate or amplify social
bias from training data, raising concerns about fairness. At the same time,
their black-box nature makes it difficult for users to recognize biased
predictions and for developers to effectively mitigate them. While some studies
suggest that input-based explanations can help detect and mitigate bias, others
question their reliability in ensuring fairness. Existing research on
explainability in fair NLP has been predominantly qualitative, with limited
large-scale quantitative analysis. In this work, we conduct the first
systematic study of the relationship between explainability and fairness in
hate speech detection, focusing on both encoder- and decoder-only models. We
examine three key dimensions: (1) identifying biased predictions, (2) selecting
fair models, and (3) mitigating bias during model training. Our findings show
that input-based explanations can effectively detect biased predictions and
serve as useful supervision for reducing bias during training, but they are
unreliable for selecting fair models among candidates.

Method: 使用MALLS和Willow数据集，比较编码器-解码器与仅解码器架构，探索词汇扩展、谓词条件化和多语言训练等技术，引入精确匹配、逻辑等价和谓词对齐等指标。

Result: 微调Flan-T5-XXL在提供谓词列表时达到70%准确率；谓词可用性提升性能15-20%；T5模型优于更大的仅解码器LLM；模型能泛化到未见过的逻辑论证（FOLIO数据集）。

Conclusion: 结构逻辑翻译被证明是鲁棒的，但谓词提取成为主要瓶颈。

Abstract: Automating the translation of natural language to first-order logic (FOL) is
crucial for knowledge representation and formal methods, yet remains
challenging. We present a systematic evaluation of fine-tuned LLMs for this
task, comparing architectures (encoder-decoder vs. decoder-only) and training
strategies. Using the MALLS and Willow datasets, we explore techniques like
vocabulary extension, predicate conditioning, and multilingual training,
introducing metrics for exact match, logical equivalence, and predicate
alignment. Our fine-tuned Flan-T5-XXL achieves 70% accuracy with predicate
lists, outperforming GPT-4o and even the DeepSeek-R1-0528 model with CoT
reasoning ability as well as symbolic systems like ccg2lambda. Key findings
show: (1) predicate availability boosts performance by 15-20%, (2) T5 models
surpass larger decoder-only LLMs, and (3) models generalize to unseen logical
arguments (FOLIO dataset) without specific training. While structural logic
translation proves robust, predicate extraction emerges as the main bottleneck.

Motivation: 研究Transformer模型从训练样本中学习传递关系推理的能力，以及规模扩展对此能力的影响。传递关系推理在因果推断等场景中至关重要，相当于有向图中的连通性判断任务。

Method: 生成有向图来训练不同规模的Transformer模型，评估它们在不同图大小下推断传递关系的能力。特别关注网格状图结构对学习效果的影响。

Result: Transformer能够学习低维网格状有向图的连通性，节点嵌入维度是预测学习能力的重要指标。模型规模扩大能提升泛化能力，但对于多不连通分量的非网格图学习困难。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够学习传递关系推理，但性能受图结构特征影响。网格图的维度是重要影响因素，模型规模扩展有助于提升泛化能力，但复杂图结构仍具挑战。

Abstract: Reasoning capability is essential to ensure the factual correctness of the
responses of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs), and robust
reasoning about transitive relations is instrumental in many settings, such as
causal inference. Hence, it is essential to investigate the capability of
transformers in the task of inferring transitive relations (e.g., knowing A
causes B and B causes C, then A causes C). The task of inferring transitive
relations is equivalent to the task of connectivity in directed graphs (e.g.,
knowing there is a path from A to B, and there is a path from B to C, then
there is a path from A to C). Past research focused on whether transformers can
learn to infer transitivity from in-context examples provided in the input
prompt. However, transformers' capability to infer transitive relations from
training examples and how scaling affects the ability is unexplored. In this
study, we seek to answer this question by generating directed graphs to train
transformer models of varying sizes and evaluate their ability to infer
transitive relations for various graph sizes. Our findings suggest that
transformers are capable of learning connectivity on "grid-like'' directed
graphs where each node can be embedded in a low-dimensional subspace, and
connectivity is easily inferable from the embeddings of the nodes. We find that
the dimensionality of the underlying grid graph is a strong predictor of
transformers' ability to learn the connectivity task, where higher-dimensional
grid graphs pose a greater challenge than low-dimensional grid graphs. In
addition, we observe that increasing the model scale leads to increasingly
better generalization to infer connectivity over grid graphs. However, if the
graph is not a grid graph and contains many disconnected components,
transformers struggle to learn the connectivity task, especially when the
number of components is large.

invective language throughout 16th-century England. Subsequently, we assess and
compare the performance of fine-tuned BERT-based models and zero-shot prompted

Abstract: Recent advances in Bayesian probability theory and its application to
cognitive science in combination with the development of a new generation of
computational tools and methods for probabilistic computation have led to a
'probabilistic turn' in pragmatics and semantics. In particular, the framework
of Rational Speech Act theory has been developed to model broadly Gricean
accounts of pragmatic phenomena in Bayesian terms, starting with fairly simple
reference games and covering ever more complex communicative exchanges such as

TL;DR: CHRONOBERG是一个跨越250年的英语书籍语料库，用于研究语言的时间演变，支持时间感知的LLM训练和评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语料库缺乏长期时间结构，限制了LLM理解语言语义和规范演变的能力。

Method: 从Project Gutenberg整理英语书籍文本，添加时间注释，进行时间敏感的VAD分析，构建历史校准的情感词典。

Result: 展示了现代LLM工具在检测歧视性语言和跨时间情感分析方面的局限性，以及顺序训练模型难以编码历时意义变化。

Conclusion: 需要时间感知的训练和评估流程，CHRONOBERG为语言变化和时间泛化研究提供了可扩展资源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at operating at scale by leveraging social
media and various data crawled from the web. Whereas existing corpora are
diverse, their frequent lack of long-term temporal structure may however limit
an LLM's ability to contextualize semantic and normative evolution of language
and to capture diachronic variation. To support analysis and training for the
latter, we introduce CHRONOBERG, a temporally structured corpus of English book
texts spanning 250 years, curated from Project Gutenberg and enriched with a
variety of temporal annotations. First, the edited nature of books enables us
to quantify lexical semantic change through time-sensitive
Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) analysis and to construct historically
calibrated affective lexicons to support temporally grounded interpretation.
With the lexicons at hand, we demonstrate a need for modern LLM-based tools to
better situate their detection of discriminatory language and contextualization
of sentiment across various time-periods. In fact, we show how language models
trained sequentially on CHRONOBERG struggle to encode diachronic shifts in
meaning, emphasizing the need for temporally aware training and evaluation
pipelines, and positioning CHRONOBERG as a scalable resource for the study of
linguistic change and temporal generalization. Disclaimer: This paper includes
language and display of samples that could be offensive to readers. Open

*Max Malyi,Jonathan Shek,Andre Biscaya*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个使用大语言模型（LLMs）对风力涡轮机维护日志进行深度语义分析的框架，超越了传统的文本分类方法，实现了故障模式识别、因果链推断等复杂推理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机维护日志中包含大量非结构化文本信息，传统定量可靠性分析难以利用这些数据。现有机器学习方法通常只停留在文本分类层面，无法进行更复杂的推理分析。

Method: 引入探索性框架，利用大语言模型执行四个分析工作流：故障模式识别、因果链推断、比较站点分析和数据质量审计。

Result: 结果表明，大语言模型可以作为强大的"可靠性协同工具"，不仅能够标记文本，还能综合文本信息并生成可操作的专业级假设。

Conclusion: 这项工作为大语言模型作为推理工具的使用提供了新颖且可复现的方法论，为风能行业解锁非结构化数据中的洞察提供了新途径。

Abstract: A wealth of operational intelligence is locked within the unstructured
free-text of wind turbine maintenance logs, a resource largely inaccessible to
traditional quantitative reliability analysis. While machine learning has been
applied to this data, existing approaches typically stop at classification,
categorising text into predefined labels. This paper addresses the gap in
leveraging modern large language models (LLMs) for more complex reasoning
tasks. We introduce an exploratory framework that uses LLMs to move beyond
classification and perform deep semantic analysis. We apply this framework to a
large industrial dataset to execute four analytical workflows: failure mode
identification, causal chain inference, comparative site analysis, and data
quality auditing. The results demonstrate that LLMs can function as powerful
"reliability co-pilots," moving beyond labelling to synthesise textual
information and generate actionable, expert-level hypotheses. This work
contributes a novel and reproducible methodology for using LLMs as a reasoning
tool, offering a new pathway to enhance operational intelligence in the wind
energy sector by unlocking insights previously obscured in unstructured data.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 分析OLMO2开源模型的训练数据政治偏见，发现左倾文档在训练数据中占主导地位，且训练数据中的主要政治立场与模型在政策问题上的偏见高度相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）已知会产生政治偏见文本，但偏见如何产生尚不清楚。当前LLM研究中对训练数据政治内容的分析仍不足，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 分析OLMO2模型的预训练和后训练语料库，随机抽取大样本，自动标注文档政治倾向，分析来源领域和内容，评估训练数据政治内容与模型政策立场的关系。

Result: 左倾文档在所有数据集中占主导；预训练语料比后训练数据包含更多政治参与内容；左右倾向文档通过不同价值观和合法性来源构建相似话题；训练数据中的主要立场与模型政治偏见高度相关。

Conclusion: 需要在未来数据管理流程中整合政治内容分析，并对过滤策略进行深入记录以确保透明度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are known to generate politically biased text,
yet how such biases arise remains unclear. A crucial step toward answering this
question is the analysis of training data, whose political content remains
largely underexplored in current LLM research. To address this gap, we present
in this paper an analysis of the pre- and post-training corpora of OLMO2, the
largest fully open-source model released together with its complete dataset.
From these corpora, we draw large random samples, automatically annotate
documents for political orientation, and analyze their source domains and
content. We then assess how political content in the training data correlates
with models' stance on specific policy issues. Our analysis shows that
left-leaning documents predominate across datasets, with pre-training corpora
containing significantly more politically engaged content than post-training
data. We also find that left- and right-leaning documents frame similar topics
through distinct values and sources of legitimacy. Finally, the predominant
stance in the training data strongly correlates with models' political biases
when evaluated on policy issues. These findings underscore the need to
integrate political content analysis into future data curation pipelines as
well as in-depth documentation of filtering strategies for transparency.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Chimera是一个包含7,500个高质量维基百科图表的测试套件，用于评估视觉语言模型对图表的真实理解能力，发现当前模型主要依赖知识回忆和Clever-Hans等捷径而非真正理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在图表相关基准测试中表现良好，但可能依赖知识、推理或模态捷径，而非真正理解和推理图表内容，需要更严格的评估方法。

Method: 构建Chimera测试套件，包含7,500个维基百科图表，每个图表标注语义三元组和多层次问题，评估实体识别、关系理解、知识基础和视觉推理四个维度，检测三种捷径行为。

Result: 评估15个开源VLM发现，其看似强大的性能主要来自捷径行为：视觉记忆捷径影响较小，知识回忆捷径作用中等，Clever-Hans捷径贡献显著。

Conclusion: 当前VLM在图表理解方面存在严重局限性，需要更鲁棒的评估协议来基准化对复杂视觉输入的真实理解，而非问答捷径。

Abstract: Diagrams convey symbolic information in a visual format rather than a linear
stream of words, making them especially challenging for AI models to process.
While recent evaluations suggest that vision-language models (VLMs) perform
well on diagram-related benchmarks, their reliance on knowledge, reasoning, or
modality shortcuts raises concerns about whether they genuinely understand and
reason over diagrams. To address this gap, we introduce Chimera, a
comprehensive test suite comprising 7,500 high-quality diagrams sourced from
Wikipedia; each diagram is annotated with its symbolic content represented by
semantic triples along with multi-level questions designed to assess four
fundamental aspects of diagram comprehension: entity recognition, relation
understanding, knowledge grounding, and visual reasoning. We use Chimera to
measure the presence of three types of shortcuts in visual question answering:
(1) the visual-memorization shortcut, where VLMs rely on memorized visual
patterns; (2) the knowledge-recall shortcut, where models leverage memorized
factual knowledge instead of interpreting the diagram; and (3) the Clever-Hans
shortcut, where models exploit superficial language patterns or priors without
true comprehension. We evaluate 15 open-source VLMs from 7 model families on
Chimera and find that their seemingly strong performance largely stems from
shortcut behaviors: visual-memorization shortcuts have slight impact,
knowledge-recall shortcuts play a moderate role, and Clever-Hans shortcuts
contribute significantly. These findings expose critical limitations in current
VLMs and underscore the need for more robust evaluation protocols that
benchmark genuine comprehension of complex visual inputs (e.g., diagrams)
rather than question-answering shortcuts.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过激活空间方向检测LLM不可回答性的方法，在抽取式QA任务中有效识别无答案问题，并具有良好的跨数据集泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在缺乏足够信息时仍自信回答导致的幻觉问题，专注于抽取式QA中的不可回答性检测。

Method: 通过在推理过程中应用激活加法，识别模型激活空间中捕捉不可回答性的方向，并将隐藏激活投影到该方向进行分类。

Result: 在两个开源LLM和四个抽取式QA基准测试中，该方法有效检测不可回答问题，在跨数据集泛化方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能检测抽取式QA中的不可回答性，还能扩展到其他因素导致的不可回答情况，通过因果干预可有效控制模型的弃权行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often respond confidently to questions even when
they lack the necessary information, leading to hallucinated answers. In this
work, we study the problem of (un)answerability detection, focusing on
extractive question answering (QA) where the model should determine if a
passage contains sufficient information to answer a given question. We propose
a simple approach for identifying a direction in the model's activation space
that captures unanswerability and uses it for classification. This direction is
selected by applying activation additions during inference and measuring their
impact on the model's abstention behavior. We show that projecting hidden
activations onto this direction yields a reliable score for (un)answerability
classification. Experiments on two open-weight LLMs and four extractive QA
benchmarks show that our method effectively detects unanswerable questions and
generalizes better across datasets than existing prompt-based and
classifier-based approaches. Moreover, the obtained directions extend beyond
extractive QA to unanswerability that stems from factors, such as lack of
scientific consensus and subjectivity. Last, causal interventions show that
adding or ablating the directions effectively controls the abstention behavior
of the model.

TL;DR: 评估LLaMA和Gemini在多语言法律任务中的表现，发现法律任务对LLM构成显著挑战，准确率通常低于50%，而通用任务可达70%以上。Gemini平均比LLaMA表现好24个百分点，但所有模型在法律应用中仍存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大语言模型时代，理解其在法律等高风险领域的性能和局限性至关重要。目前对LLM在多语言、多司法管辖区和对抗性环境中的表现研究不足。

Method: 使用LLM-as-a-Judge方法进行人类对齐评估，构建开源模块化评估管道，支持多语言、多样化任务的基准测试，重点评估法律分类、摘要、开放问题和一般推理任务。

Result: 法律推理基准LEXam上准确率通常低于50%，而通用任务XNLI可达70%以上。英语结果更稳定但不总是更准确。提示敏感性和对抗脆弱性在所有语言中持续存在。语言性能与其与英语的句法相似性相关。

Conclusion: 尽管新LLM有所改进，但在关键多语言法律应用中可靠部署仍面临挑战。法律任务对LLM构成显著障碍，需要进一步研究提升其法律推理能力。

Abstract: In an era dominated by Large Language Models (LLMs), understanding their
capabilities and limitations, especially in high-stakes fields like law, is
crucial. While LLMs such as Meta's LLaMA, OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini,
DeepSeek, and other emerging models are increasingly integrated into legal
workflows, their performance in multilingual, jurisdictionally diverse, and
adversarial contexts remains insufficiently explored. This work evaluates LLaMA
and Gemini on multilingual legal and non-legal benchmarks, and assesses their
adversarial robustness in legal tasks through character and word-level
perturbations. We use an LLM-as-a-Judge approach for human-aligned evaluation.
We moreover present an open-source, modular evaluation pipeline designed to
support multilingual, task-diverse benchmarking of any combination of LLMs and
datasets, with a particular focus on legal tasks, including classification,
summarization, open questions, and general reasoning. Our findings confirm that
legal tasks pose significant challenges for LLMs with accuracies often below
50% on legal reasoning benchmarks such as LEXam, compared to over 70% on
general-purpose tasks like XNLI. In addition, while English generally yields
more stable results, it does not always lead to higher accuracy. Prompt
sensitivity and adversarial vulnerability is also shown to persist across
languages. Finally, a correlation is found between the performance of a
language and its syntactic similarity to English. We also observe that LLaMA is
weaker than Gemini, with the latter showing an average advantage of about 24
percentage points across the same task. Despite improvements in newer LLMs,
challenges remain in deploying them reliably for critical, multilingual legal
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观察方法无法揭示语义变化的因果机制，而人类实验难以应用于历时语义变化过程，因此需要新的模拟框架来研究语义变化机制。

Method: 使用神经代理框架，首先将代理置于真实词汇系统中，然后系统性地操纵其交际需求，采用监督学习和强化学习管道训练代理。

Result: 实验显示，经过训练的神经代理能够显著程度地复现人类颜色命名模式，支持NeLLCom-Lex框架在阐明语义变化机制方面的进一步应用。

Conclusion: NeLLCom-Lex框架为研究语义变化提供了有效工具，证明了神经代理能够模拟人类词汇系统的演化过程。

Abstract: Lexical semantic change has primarily been investigated with observational
and experimental methods; however, observational methods (corpus analysis,
distributional semantic modeling) cannot get at causal mechanisms, and
experimental paradigms with humans are hard to apply to semantic change due to
the extended diachronic processes involved. This work introduces NeLLCom-Lex, a
neural-agent framework designed to simulate semantic change by first grounding
agents in a real lexical system (e.g. English) and then systematically
manipulating their communicative needs. Using a well-established color naming
task, we simulate the evolution of a lexical system within a single generation,
and study which factors lead agents to: (i) develop human-like naming behavior
and lexicons, and (ii) change their behavior and lexicons according to their
communicative needs. Our experiments with different supervised and
reinforcement learning pipelines show that neural agents trained to 'speak' an
existing language can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a
remarkable extent, supporting the further use of NeLLCom-Lex to elucidate the
mechanisms of semantic change.

Method: 提出解决方案多样性作为新指标，在三个代表性问题领域进行测试，将该指标应用于SFT和RL训练策略中。

Result: 实验表明，使用解决方案多样性指标能够持续提高成功率，解决方案多样性与问题解决能力呈正相关。

Conclusion: 解决方案多样性是一个简单但有效的工具，可用于推进LLM的训练和评估。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely used for problem-solving tasks.
Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In
this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated
by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is
positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models.
Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that
can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three
representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence
consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution
divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and
evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种高效、可解释且可扩展的LLM表示方案，能够实时适应动态扩展的模型库。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive results over various tasks,
and ever-expanding public repositories contain an abundance of pre-trained
models. Therefore, identifying the best-performing LLM for a given task is a
significant challenge. Previous works have suggested learning LLM
representations to address this. However, these approaches present limited
scalability and require costly retraining to encompass additional models and
datasets. Moreover, the produced representation utilizes distinct spaces that
cannot be easily interpreted. This work presents an efficient, training-free
approach to representing LLMs as linear operators within the prompts' semantic
task space, thus providing a highly interpretable representation of the models'
application. Our method utilizes closed-form computation of geometrical
properties and ensures exceptional scalability and real-time adaptability to
dynamically expanding repositories. We demonstrate our approach on success
prediction and model selection tasks, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art
results with notable performance in out-of-sample scenarios.

Motivation: 现有方法在优化单个对齐目标时会覆盖其他目标的表示（灾难性遗忘），而简单的多分支设计会导致跨目标输出不一致（推理碎片化）

Method: 两阶段1-to-N框架：阶段I计算共享表示，阶段II通过策略参考机制在并行分支中进行目标特定控制

Result: 在多个7B LLM上验证，AMBS显著提升HHH对齐分数（DeepSeek-7B上平均提升32.4%），减少不安全输出11.0%

Conclusion: AMBS能够有效解决多目标对齐中的关键挑战，在保持跨目标一致性的同时实现高效对齐

Abstract: Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) along multiple
objectives-helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty (HHH)-is critical for safe
and reliable deployment. Prior work has used steering vector-small control
signals injected into hidden states-to guide LLM outputs, typically via
one-to-one (1-to-1) Transformer decoders. In this setting, optimizing a single
alignment objective can inadvertently overwrite representations learned for
other objectives, leading to catastrophic forgetting. More recent approaches
extend steering vectors via one-to-many (1-to-N) Transformer decoders. While
this alleviates catastrophic forgetting, naive multi-branch designs optimize
each objective independently, which can cause inference fragmentation-outputs
across HHH objectives may become inconsistent. We propose Adaptive Multi-Branch
Steering (AMBS), a two-stage 1-to-N framework for unified and efficient
multi-objective alignment. In Stage I, post-attention hidden states of the
Transformer layer are computed once to form a shared representation. In Stage
II, this representation is cloned into parallel branches and steered via a
policy-reference mechanism, enabling objective-specific control while
maintaining cross-objective consistency. Empirical evaluations on Alpaca,
BeaverTails, and TruthfulQA show that AMBS consistently improves HHH alignment
across multiple 7B LLM backbones. For example, on DeepSeek-7B, AMBS improves
average alignment scores by +32.4% and reduces unsafe outputs by 11.0% compared
to a naive 1-to-N baseline, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 大型语言模型训练的巨大计算成本阻碍了创新，FP8训练虽有理论效率优势但缺乏开源训练方案，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 采用端到端的FP8训练方案，结合持续预训练和监督微调，使用细粒度混合精度量化策略来平衡数值保真度和计算效率。

Result: 在160B token语料上的持续预训练实验表明，该方法稳定且几乎无损，在推理基准测试中与BF16基线性能相当，同时训练时间减少22%，峰值内存使用降低14%，吞吐量提升19%。

Conclusion: FP8是BF16的实用且鲁棒的替代方案，将发布相关代码以促进大规模模型训练的民主化。

Abstract: The immense computational cost of training Large Language Models (LLMs)
presents a major barrier to innovation. While FP8 training offers a promising
solution with significant theoretical efficiency gains, its widespread adoption
has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive, open-source training recipe.
To bridge this gap, we introduce an end-to-end FP8 training recipe that
seamlessly integrates continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. Our
methodology employs a fine-grained, hybrid-granularity quantization strategy to
maintain numerical fidelity while maximizing computational efficiency. Through
extensive experiments, including the continue pre-training of models on a
160B-token corpus, we demonstrate that our recipe is not only remarkably stable
but also essentially lossless, achieving performance on par with the BF16
baseline across a suite of reasoning benchmarks. Crucially, this is achieved
with substantial efficiency improvements, including up to a 22% reduction in
training time, a 14% decrease in peak memory usage, and a 19% increase in
throughput. Our results establish FP8 as a practical and robust alternative to
BF16, and we will release the accompanying code to further democratize
large-scale model training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLMs的逻辑推理范式不适合处理社会情境，因为社会情境涉及分析模糊线索的解释性过程，很少产生确定结果。需要模拟人类社会认知的新范式。

Method: 1. 提出认知推理范式，将解释过程结构化；2. 开发CogFlow框架：通过树状规划模拟人类思维创建认知流数据集，先进行监督微调，再用强化学习优化；3. 使用多目标奖励机制同时优化认知流和响应质量。

Result: 实验表明CogFlow有效增强了LLMs的社会认知能力，甚至对人类也有帮助，导致更有效的社会决策制定。

Conclusion: 认知推理范式成功弥补了LLMs在社会情境处理方面的不足，CogFlow框架为增强AI的社会认知能力提供了有效途径。

Abstract: LLMs trained for logical reasoning excel at step-by-step deduction to reach
verifiable answers. However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social
situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues
that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce
Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It
formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of
interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which
combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then
propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs.
CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the
associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured
planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via
supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the
model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward
that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments
show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of
LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.

inaccuracies, omissions, or tone mismatches, making robust evaluation
essential. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we introduce a clinically
grounded error ontology comprising 5 domains and 59 granular error codes,
developed through inductive coding and expert adjudication; (2) we develop a
retrieval-augmented evaluation pipeline (RAEC) that leverages semantically
similar historical message-response pairs to improve judgment quality; and (3)
we provide a two-stage prompting architecture using DSPy to enable scalable,
interpretable, and hierarchical error detection. Our approach assesses the
quality of drafts both in isolation and with reference to similar past
message-response pairs retrieved from institutional archives. Using a two-stage
DSPy pipeline, we compared baseline and reference-enhanced evaluations on over
1,500 patient messages. Retrieval context improved error identification in
domains such as clinical completeness and workflow appropriateness. Human
validation on 100 messages demonstrated superior agreement (concordance = 50%
vs. 33%) and performance (F1 = 0.500 vs. 0.256) of context-enhanced labels vs.
baseline, supporting the use of our RAEC pipeline as AI guardrails for patient
messaging.

*Yehonatan Pesiakhovsky,Zorik Gekhman,Yosi Mass,Liat Ein-Dor,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了使用LLMs定位上下文基础幻觉（模型输出中无法通过源文本验证的信息）的可行性，构建了专门的基准测试，并评估了四种大型LLMs的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估幻觉定位的方法过于复杂，需要更实用的替代方案。缺乏专门针对LLMs的幻觉定位元评估基准。

Method: 构建了包含1000多个示例的挑战性人工标注基准，提出基于自由形式文本描述的新表示方法，评估四种大型LLMs，分析最佳提示策略。

Result: 最佳模型仅达到0.67的F1分数，基准具有挑战性。LLMs倾向于错误地将缺失细节标记为不一致，且难以处理包含模型参数知识但源文本中不存在的事实信息。

Conclusion: LLMs在幻觉定位任务中表现有限，主要挑战在于错误标记缺失细节和难以处理与模型参数知识一致但无法验证的信息。

Abstract: Context-grounded hallucinations are cases where model outputs contain
information not verifiable against the source text. We study the applicability
of LLMs for localizing such hallucinations, as a more practical alternative to
existing complex evaluation pipelines. In the absence of established benchmarks
for meta-evaluation of hallucinations localization, we construct one tailored
to LLMs, involving a challenging human annotation of over 1,000 examples. We
complement the benchmark with an LLM-based evaluation protocol, verifying its
quality in a human evaluation. Since existing representations of hallucinations
limit the types of errors that can be expressed, we propose a new
representation based on free-form textual descriptions, capturing the full
range of possible errors. We conduct a comprehensive study, evaluating four
large-scale LLMs, which highlights the benchmark's difficulty, as the best
model achieves an F1 score of only 0.67. Through careful analysis, we offer
insights into optimal prompting strategies for the task and identify the main
factors that make it challenging for LLMs: (1) a tendency to incorrectly flag
missing details as inconsistent, despite being instructed to check only facts
in the output; and (2) difficulty with outputs containing factually correct
information absent from the source - and thus not verifiable - due to alignment
with the model's parametric knowledge.

Motivation: 为自然语言结构建模提供一个严格且可解释的基础，验证子正则层次结构在语言学习中的适用性。

Method: 通过理论证明标准子正则语言类的线性可分性，并在合成实验和英语形态学的真实数据实验中进行验证。

Result: 合成实验在无噪声条件下确认了完美可分性，真实数据实验显示学习到的特征与已知语言约束一致。

Conclusion: 子正则层次结构为自然语言结构建模提供了严格且可解释的基础，证明了其在语言学习中的有效性。

Abstract: We prove that all standard subregular language classes are linearly separable
when represented by their deciding predicates. This establishes finite
observability and guarantees learnability with simple linear models. Synthetic
experiments confirm perfect separability under noise-free conditions, while
real-data experiments on English morphology show that learned features align
with well-known linguistic constraints. These results demonstrate that the
subregular hierarchy provides a rigorous and interpretable foundation for
modeling natural language structure. Our code used in real-data experiments is

Abstract: Deliberation plays a crucial role in shaping outcomes by weighing diverse
perspectives before reaching decisions. With recent advancements in Natural
Language Processing, it has become possible to computationally model
deliberation by analyzing opinion shifts and predicting potential outcomes
under varying scenarios. In this study, we present a comparative analysis of
multiple NLP techniques to evaluate how effectively models interpret
deliberative discourse and produce meaningful insights. Opinions from
individuals of varied backgrounds were collected to construct a self-sourced
dataset that reflects diverse viewpoints. Deliberation was simulated using
product presentations enriched with striking facts, which often prompted
measurable shifts in audience opinions. We have given comparative analysis
between two models namely Frequency-Based Discourse Modulation and
Quantum-Deliberation Framework which outperform the existing state of art
models. The findings highlight practical applications in public policy-making,
debate evaluation, decision-support frameworks, and large-scale social media

Motivation: 实验性能分数的变化来自模型相关和数据相关的来源，需要同时考虑两者以避免显著低估假设重复实验的总体变异性。

Method: 使用重采样方法来量化评估指标的不确定性，并考虑模型和数据两个变异性来源。

Result: 在多语言问答、机器翻译和命名实体识别等任务中，重采样方法可用于计算排行榜中各种统计量的抽样分布，如平均值/中位数、模型间成对差异和排名。

Conclusion: 重采样方法是量化NLP基准测试中评估指标不确定性的有效工具，能够更准确地反映性能评估的统计精度。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a set of resampling-based methods for quantifying
uncertainty and statistical precision of evaluation metrics in multilingual
and/or multitask NLP benchmarks. We show how experimental variation in
performance scores arises from both model- and data-related sources, and that
accounting for both of them is necessary to avoid substantially underestimating
the overall variability over hypothetical replications. Using multilingual
question answering, machine translation, and named entity recognition as
example tasks, we also demonstrate how resampling methods are useful for
computing sampling distributions for various quantities used in leaderboards
such as the average/median, pairwise differences between models, and rankings.

*Xingyu Shen,Yingfa Chen,Zhen Leng Thai,Xu Han,Zhiyuan Liu,Maosong Sun*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: StateX是一种训练流程，通过后训练高效扩展预训练RNN的状态大小，提升长上下文回忆能力而不显著增加参数或训练成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型处理长上下文成本高，而RNN虽然复杂度低但状态大小固定，难以准确回忆长上下文信息。直接训练大状态RNN成本高昂

Method: 为线性注意力和状态空间模型设计后训练架构修改，扩展状态大小而不增加参数。通过专门的训练流程实现高效状态扩展

Result: 在1.3B参数模型上实验证明，StateX能有效提升RNN的回忆能力和上下文学习能力，且后训练成本低，不影响其他能力

Conclusion: StateX提供了一种高效扩展RNN状态大小的方法，解决了RNN在长上下文回忆方面的局限性，同时保持了低复杂度优势

Abstract: While Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable language modeling
performance, their high complexities result in high costs when processing long
contexts. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) such as linear
attention and state space models have gained popularity due to their constant
per-token complexities. However, these recurrent models struggle with tasks
that require accurate recall of contextual information from long contexts,
because all contextual information is compressed into a constant-size recurrent
state. Previous works have shown that recall ability is positively correlated
with the recurrent state size, yet directly training RNNs with larger recurrent
states results in high training costs. In this paper, we introduce StateX, a
training pipeline for efficiently expanding the states of pre-trained RNNs
through post-training. For two popular classes of RNNs, linear attention and
state space models, we design post-training architectural modifications to
scale up the state size with no or negligible increase in model parameters.
Experiments on models up to 1.3B parameters demonstrate that StateX efficiently
enhances the recall and in-context learning ability of RNNs without incurring
high post-training costs or compromising other capabilities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种将思维轨迹作为隐变量的变分推理框架，通过变分推断优化语言模型的推理能力，统一了变分推理与强化学习方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为语言模型提供原则性的概率视角，将思维轨迹视为隐变量，通过变分推理来改进模型的推理能力，并统一变分推理与强化学习方法。

Method: 从证据下界(ELBO)出发，扩展到多轨迹目标以获得更紧的边界，提出前向KL公式来稳定变分后验的训练，将拒绝采样微调和二元奖励强化学习解释为局部前向KL目标。

Result: 在Qwen 2.5和Qwen 3模型系列上进行了广泛的推理任务验证，证明方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作为改进语言模型推理能力提供了稳定的目标函数，建立了变分推理与强化学习方法的统一理论框架。

Abstract: We introduce a variational reasoning framework for language models that
treats thinking traces as latent variables and optimizes them through
variational inference. Starting from the evidence lower bound (ELBO), we extend
it to a multi-trace objective for tighter bounds and propose a forward-KL
formulation that stabilizes the training of the variational posterior. We
further show that rejection sampling finetuning and binary-reward RL, including
GRPO, can be interpreted as local forward-KL objectives, where an implicit
weighting by model accuracy naturally arises from the derivation and reveals a
previously unnoticed bias toward easier questions. We empirically validate our
method on the Qwen 2.5 and Qwen 3 model families across a wide range of
reasoning tasks. Overall, our work provides a principled probabilistic
perspective that unifies variational inference with RL-style methods and yields
stable objectives for improving the reasoning ability of language models. Our
code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/variational-reasoning.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出反馈条件策略(FCP)，将语言反馈作为条件信号而非标量奖励，通过最大似然训练学习反馈条件后验分布，并引入在线自举阶段进行策略优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL方法将丰富的语言反馈压缩为标量奖励，导致信息损失和尺度不平衡问题。

Method: 1. 反馈条件策略(FCP)直接从响应-反馈对中学习；2. 通过最大似然训练近似反馈条件后验；3. 在线自举阶段在正向条件下生成并接收新反馈进行优化。

Result: 将反馈驱动学习重新定义为条件生成而非奖励优化，为LLMs提供了更丰富的从语言反馈中学习的方式。

Conclusion: FCP方法能够更有效地利用语言反馈的丰富信息，避免标量奖励的信息损失问题。

Abstract: LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods
typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of
their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal
feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image
generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the
feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback
pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum
likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping
stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh
feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as
conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more
expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is
available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.

*Arkadiy Saakyan,Najoung Kim,Smaranda Muresan,Tuhin Chakrabarty*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文研究发现n-gram新颖性作为创造力衡量指标存在不足，需要同时考虑新颖性和适当性。通过7542个专家标注发现，91%高n-gram新颖性表达不被认为是创造性的，且开源LLM的高新颖性伴随低实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨n-gram新颖性作为语言模型创造力和文本生成能力评估指标的局限性，因为创造力理论要求同时考虑新颖性和适当性。

Method: 通过7542个专家标注（26位专家）对人工和AI生成文本进行细致阅读评估，分析新颖性、实用性和合理性之间的关系，并测试不同LLM识别创造性表达的能力。

Result: n-gram新颖性与专家评判的创造力正相关，但91%高新颖性表达不被认为是创造性的；开源LLM的高新颖性伴随低实用性；前沿闭源模型比人类更少产生创造性表达；LLM识别非实用性表达存在困难。

Conclusion: 不应单独依赖n-gram新颖性评估创造力，需要综合考虑新颖性和适当性；LLM在识别创造性表达方面有潜力但需改进，特别是识别非实用性表达。

Abstract: N-gram novelty is widely used to evaluate language models' ability to
generate text outside of their training data. More recently, it has also been
adopted as a metric for measuring textual creativity. However, theoretical work
on creativity suggests that this approach may be inadequate, as it does not
account for creativity's dual nature: novelty (how original the text is) and
appropriateness (how sensical and pragmatic it is). We investigate the
relationship between this notion of creativity and n-gram novelty through 7542
expert writer annotations (n=26) of novelty, pragmaticality, and sensicality
via close reading of human and AI-generated text. We find that while n-gram
novelty is positively associated with expert writer-judged creativity, ~91% of
top-quartile expressions by n-gram novelty are not judged as creative,
cautioning against relying on n-gram novelty alone. Furthermore, unlike
human-written text, higher n-gram novelty in open-source LLMs correlates with
lower pragmaticality. In an exploratory study with frontier close-source
models, we additionally confirm that they are less likely to produce creative
expressions than humans. Using our dataset, we test whether zero-shot,
few-shot, and finetuned models are able to identify creative expressions (a
positive aspect of writing) and non-pragmatic ones (a negative aspect).
Overall, frontier LLMs exhibit performance much higher than random but leave
room for improvement, especially struggling to identify non-pragmatic
expressions. We further find that LLM-as-a-Judge novelty scores from the
best-performing model were predictive of expert writer preferences.

TL;DR: WebGen-Agent是一个新颖的网站生成代理系统，通过多级视觉反馈和GUI代理测试来迭代生成和优化网站代码库，显著提升了网站生成的质量和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代码生成代理在处理网站代码库生成任务时，仅依赖简单的代码执行反馈，无法准确评估生成代码的实际质量，特别是在视觉效果和用户交互方面。

Method: 提出WebGen-Agent系统，利用视觉语言模型(VLM)分析网站截图和GUI代理测试结果，生成详细的文本描述、建议和质量评分；结合回溯和选择最佳机制；并引入Step-GRPO训练方法，使用截图和GUI代理评分作为过程监督信号。

Result: 在WebGen-Bench数据集上，WebGen-Agent将Claude-3.5-Sonnet的准确率从26.4%提升到51.9%，外观评分从3.0提升到3.9；Step-GRPO训练使Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct的准确率从38.9%提升到45.4%，外观评分从3.4提升到3.7。

Conclusion: WebGen-Agent通过综合视觉反馈机制显著提升了网站生成的质量，证明了视觉反馈在代码生成任务中的重要性，为基于LLM的代理系统提供了新的优化方向。

Abstract: Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for
tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual
effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple
code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture
the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose
WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and
multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website
codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding
the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual
language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The
screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and
select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the
accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further
introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve
the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using
the screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we
provide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively
improves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset,
WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9%
and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous
state-of-the-art agent system. Additionally, our Step-GRPO training approach
increases the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from 38.9% to 45.4% and
raises the appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.

Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估语音优先AI助手的全面能力，需要开发更全面的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含10,497个示例的基准，涵盖自然声音、音乐、对话等听力任务，多轮对话、角色扮演等说话任务，以及多样化图像的视觉任务。评估了21个开源模型和GPT-4o-Audio。

Result: 发现三个关键结果：专有模型并非全面优于开源模型；大多数模型擅长说话任务但音频理解能力较弱；设计良好的小模型可以媲美大模型。Step-Audio-2-mini(7B)的听力准确率是LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual的两倍多。

Conclusion: 当前模型在多模态输入和角色扮演语音模仿任务上仍有困难，在鲁棒性和安全对齐方面存在显著差距。VoiceAssistant-Eval为下一代AI助手的评估和发展提供了严格框架。

Abstract: The growing capabilities of large language models and multimodal systems have
spurred interest in voice-first AI assistants, yet existing benchmarks are
inadequate for evaluating the full range of these systems' capabilities. We
introduce VoiceAssistant-Eval, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess AI
assistants across listening, speaking, and viewing. VoiceAssistant-Eval
comprises 10,497 curated examples spanning 13 task categories. These tasks
include natural sounds, music, and spoken dialogue for listening; multi-turn
dialogue, role-play imitation, and various scenarios for speaking; and highly
heterogeneous images for viewing. To demonstrate its utility, we evaluate 21
open-source models and GPT-4o-Audio, measuring the quality of the response
content and speech, as well as their consistency. The results reveal three key
findings: (1) proprietary models do not universally outperform open-source
models; (2) most models excel at speaking tasks but lag in audio understanding;
and (3) well-designed smaller models can rival much larger ones. Notably, the
mid-sized Step-Audio-2-mini (7B) achieves more than double the listening
accuracy of LLaMA-Omni2-32B-Bilingual. However, challenges remain: multimodal
(audio plus visual) input and role-play voice imitation tasks are difficult for
current models, and significant gaps persist in robustness and safety
alignment. VoiceAssistant-Eval identifies these gaps and establishes a rigorous
framework for evaluating and guiding the development of next-generation AI
assistants. Code and data will be released at

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了放射学报告生成的准确性，为临床部署提供了可行方案

Abstract: Radiography Report Generation (RRG) has gained significant attention in
medical image analysis as a promising tool for alleviating the growing workload
of radiologists. However, despite numerous advancements, existing methods have
yet to achieve the quality required for deployment in real-world clinical
settings. Meanwhile, large Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable progress in the general domain by adopting training strategies
originally designed for Large Language Models (LLMs), such as alignment
techniques. In this paper, we introduce a model-agnostic framework to enhance
RRG accuracy using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Our approach leverages
random contrastive sampling to construct training pairs, eliminating the need
for reward models or human preference annotations. Experiments on supplementing
three state-of-the-art models with our Random DPO show that our method improves
clinical performance metrics by up to 5%, without requiring any additional
training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于自闭症谱系障碍诊断的复杂性和资源密集性，现有计算机辅助诊断方法在凝视特征性能不佳和缺乏现实世界泛化能力方面存在局限性。

Method: 使用包含168名ASC参与者和157名非自闭症参与者的标准化视频数据集，进行多模态分析（面部表情、声音韵律、头部运动、心率变异性、凝视行为），并引入新的统计描述符来量化凝视角度变异性，最后采用后期融合方法整合各模态信息。

Result: 基于凝视的分类准确率从64%提升到69%，通过后期融合实现的整体分类准确率达到74%，这是目前最大且最平衡的数据集上的最佳结果。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，基于视频的多模态行为标记分析具有开发可扩展的自闭症筛查工具的潜力，能够支持自闭症评估工作。

Abstract: Due to the complex and resource-intensive nature of diagnosing Autism
Spectrum Condition (ASC), several computer-aided diagnostic support methods
have been proposed to detect autism by analyzing behavioral cues in patient
video data. While these models show promising results on some datasets, they
struggle with poor gaze feature performance and lack of real-world
generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we analyze a standardized video
dataset comprising 168 participants with ASC (46% female) and 157 non-autistic
participants (46% female), making it, to our knowledge, the largest and most
balanced dataset available. We conduct a multimodal analysis of facial
expressions, voice prosody, head motion, heart rate variability (HRV), and gaze
behavior. To address the limitations of prior gaze models, we introduce novel
statistical descriptors that quantify variability in eye gaze angles, improving
gaze-based classification accuracy from 64% to 69% and aligning computational
findings with clinical research on gaze aversion in ASC. Using late fusion, we
achieve a classification accuracy of 74%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
integrating behavioral markers across multiple modalities. Our findings
highlight the potential for scalable, video-based screening tools to support
autism assessment.

TL;DR: KV-Efficient VLA是一个模型无关的内存压缩框架，通过选择性保留高价值上下文来解决VLA模型在长序列推理时的KV内存增长和注意力计算成本问题。


<details>

Motivation: VLA模型在机器人感知和控制方面具有潜力，但其可扩展性受到注意力计算二次成本和长序列推理时KV内存无限增长的限制。现有方法虽然通过扩展骨干架构改善泛化能力，但忽视了实时部署所需的关键推理效率。

Method: 提出轻量级、训练友好的机制，将KV缓存划分为固定大小的块，使用循环门控模块根据学习的效用分数来总结和过滤历史上下文。该设计在保持因果性的同时，保留近期细粒度细节并积极修剪过时、低相关性的内存。

Result: 理论上，KV-Efficient VLA可实现高达1.21倍的推理加速和36%的KV内存减少，对任务成功率影响极小。

Conclusion: 该方法可无缝集成到现有的自回归和混合VLA堆栈中，无需修改训练流程或下游控制逻辑即可实现可扩展的推理。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models promise unified robotic perception and
control, yet their scalability is constrained by the quadratic cost of
attention and the unbounded growth of key-value (KV) memory during long-horizon
inference. While recent methods improve generalization through scaling backbone
architectures, they often neglect the inference inefficiencies critical to
real-time deployment. In this work, we present KV-Efficient VLA, a
model-agnostic memory compression framework that addresses these limitations by
introducing a lightweight, training-friendly mechanism to selectively retain
high-utility context. Our method partitions the KV cache into fixed size chunks
and employs a recurrent gating module to summarize and filter historical
context according to learned utility scores. This design preserves recent
fine-grained detail while aggressively pruning stale, low-relevance memory, all
while maintaining causality. Theoretically, KV-Efficient VLA yields up to 1.21x
inference speedup and 36% KV memory reduction, with minimal impact on task
success. Our method integrates seamlessly into existing autoregressive and
hybrid VLA stacks, enabling scalable inference without modifying training
pipelines or downstream control logic.

Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale vision language models (VLM), it is now
possible to produce realistic-looking radiology reports for chest X-ray images.
However, their clinical translation has been hampered by the factual errors and
hallucinations in the produced descriptions during inference. In this paper, we
present a novel phrase-grounded fact-checking model (FC model) that detects
errors in findings and their indicated locations in automatically generated
chest radiology reports.
  Specifically, we simulate the errors in reports through a large synthetic
dataset derived by perturbing findings and their locations in ground truth
reports to form real and fake findings-location pairs with images. A new
multi-label cross-modal contrastive regression network is then trained on this
dataset. We present results demonstrating the robustness of our method in terms
of accuracy of finding veracity prediction and localization on multiple X-ray
datasets. We also show its effectiveness for error detection in reports of SOTA
report generators on multiple datasets achieving a concordance correlation
coefficient of 0.997 with ground truth-based verification, thus pointing to its
utility during clinical inference in radiology workflows.

*Jason Jordan,Mohammadreza Akbari Lor,Peter Koulen,Mei-Ling Shyu,Shu-Ching Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态深度学习架构MDF-MLLM，通过融合视网膜图像的多层次特征和全局文本上下文，显著提升了视网膜疾病分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在捕捉视网膜疾病诊断所需的关键空间细节方面存在不足，特别是对于青光眼、糖尿病视网膜病变和视网膜色素变性等疾病。

Method: MDF-MLLM将U-Net编码器的四层跳跃特征集成到LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM的交叉注意力块中，采用补丁级投影、缩放交叉注意力和基于FiLM的U-Net调制进行特征融合。

Result: 在1305个眼底图像-文本对上的评估显示，MDF-MLLM达到94%的准确率，比基线MLLM提高了56%，召回率和F1分数分别提升67%和35%。

Conclusion: MDF-MLLM提供了一个可泛化、可解释和模块化的眼底图像分类框架，通过多尺度特征融合显著优于传统MLLM基线，具有临床决策支持系统的应用潜力。

Abstract: This study aimed to enhance disease classification accuracy from retinal
fundus images by integrating fine-grained image features and global textual
context using a novel multimodal deep learning architecture. Existing
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to capture low-level
spatial details critical for diagnosing retinal diseases such as glaucoma,
diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa. This model development and
validation study was conducted on 1,305 fundus image-text pairs compiled from
three public datasets (FIVES, HRF, and StoneRounds), covering acquired and
inherited retinal diseases, and evaluated using classification accuracy and
F1-score. The MDF-MLLM integrates skip features from four U-Net encoder layers
into cross-attention blocks within a LLaMA 3.2 11B MLLM. Vision features are
patch-wise projected and fused using scaled cross-attention and FiLM-based
U-Net modulation. Baseline MLLM achieved 60% accuracy on the dual-type disease
classification task. MDF-MLLM, with both U-Net and MLLM components fully
fine-tuned during training, achieved a significantly higher accuracy of 94%,
representing a 56% improvement. Recall and F1-scores improved by as much as 67%
and 35% over baseline, respectively. Ablation studies confirmed that the
multi-depth fusion approach contributed to substantial gains in spatial
reasoning and classification, particularly for inherited diseases with rich
clinical text. MDF-MLLM presents a generalizable, interpretable, and modular
framework for fundus image classification, outperforming traditional MLLM
baselines through multi-scale feature fusion. The architecture holds promise
for real-world deployment in clinical decision support systems. Future work
will explore synchronized training techniques, a larger pool of diseases for
more generalizability, and extending the model for segmentation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多模态提示解耦攻击(MPDA)，通过图像模态分离原始不安全提示的有害语义组件，绕过文本到图像模型的安全过滤器生成NSFW内容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有越狱方法主要操纵文本提示，对基于图像的输入漏洞探索不足，且文本方法难以绕过模型安全过滤器。

Method: 使用LLM将不安全提示解耦为伪安全提示和有害提示，然后将有害提示重写为自然对抗提示，通过视觉语言模型生成图像描述来迭代优化生成内容。

Result: MPDA能够有效绕过T2I模型的安全过滤器，生成与原始不安全提示语义一致的NSFW图像。

Conclusion: 该方法揭示了多模态输入在安全攻击中的潜力，为T2I模型的安全防护提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models have been widely applied in generating
high-fidelity images across various domains. However, these models may also be
abused to produce Not-Safe-for-Work (NSFW) content via jailbreak attacks.
Existing jailbreak methods primarily manipulate the textual prompt, leaving
potential vulnerabilities in image-based inputs largely unexplored. Moreover,
text-based methods face challenges in bypassing the model's safety filters. In
response to these limitations, we propose the Multimodal Prompt Decoupling
Attack (MPDA), which utilizes image modality to separate the harmful semantic
components of the original unsafe prompt. MPDA follows three core steps:
firstly, a large language model (LLM) decouples unsafe prompts into pseudo-safe
prompts and harmful prompts. The former are seemingly harmless sub-prompts that
can bypass filters, while the latter are sub-prompts with unsafe semantics that
trigger filters. Subsequently, the LLM rewrites the harmful prompts into
natural adversarial prompts to bypass safety filters, which guide the T2I model
to modify the base image into an NSFW output. Finally, to ensure semantic
consistency between the generated NSFW images and the original unsafe prompts,
the visual language model generates image captions, providing a new pathway to
guide the LLM in iterative rewriting and refining the generated content.

TL;DR: 提出一种多任务学习方法，通过联合训练显著目标检测、前景轮廓检测和边缘检测任务，解决显著目标检测中预测不完整和边界不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法在显著目标检测中仍存在预测不完整（由于目标内部复杂性）和边界不准确（由于卷积和池化操作的步幅）的问题。

Method: 1. 交织使用显著目标检测和前景轮廓检测任务生成均匀高亮的显著图；2. 前景轮廓和边缘检测任务相互指导，提高轮廓预测精度并减少边缘预测噪声；3. 开发新型互学习模块（MLM），通过多分支网络进行互学习训练。

Result: 在七个具有挑战性的数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在显著目标检测和边缘检测方面都取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 通过多任务学习和互学习机制，有效解决了显著目标检测中的预测完整性和边界精度问题，在多个数据集上达到最优性能。

Abstract: Though deep learning techniques have made great progress in salient object
detection recently, the predicted saliency maps still suffer from incomplete
predictions due to the internal complexity of objects and inaccurate boundaries
caused by strides in convolution and pooling operations. To alleviate these
issues, we propose to train saliency detection networks by exploiting the
supervision from not only salient object detection, but also foreground contour
detection and edge detection. First, we leverage salient object detection and
foreground contour detection tasks in an intertwined manner to generate
saliency maps with uniform highlight. Second, the foreground contour and edge
detection tasks guide each other simultaneously, thereby leading to precise
foreground contour prediction and reducing the local noises for edge
prediction. In addition, we develop a novel mutual learning module (MLM) which
serves as the building block of our method. Each MLM consists of multiple
network branches trained in a mutual learning manner, which improves the
performance by a large margin. Extensive experiments on seven challenging
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method has delivered state-of-the-art
results in both salient object detection and edge detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MAJORScore，一种新的多模态相关性评估指标，适用于三个或更多模态，通过多模态联合表示实现公平的相关性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态相关性评估指标通常只适用于两种模态，这极大地限制了多模态相似性的评估。需要一种能够评估三个或更多模态相关性的新方法。

Method: 通过多模态联合表示将多个模态整合到相同的潜在空间中，从而在一个尺度上准确表示不同模态，为公平的相关性评分提供支持。

Result: 实验表明，MAJORScore在一致性模态上提高了26.03%-64.29%，在不一致性模态上降低了13.28%-20.54%，相比现有方法表现更优。

Conclusion: MAJORScore作为更可靠的指标，适用于大规模多模态数据集的相似性评估和多模态模型性能评估。

Abstract: The multimodal relevance metric is usually borrowed from the embedding
ability of pretrained contrastive learning models for bimodal data, which is
used to evaluate the correlation between cross-modal data (e.g., CLIP).
However, the commonly used evaluation metrics are only suitable for the
associated analysis between two modalities, which greatly limits the evaluation
of multimodal similarity. Herein, we propose MAJORScore, a brand-new evaluation
metric for the relevance of multiple modalities ($N$ modalities, $N\ge3$) via
multimodal joint representation for the first time. The ability of multimodal
joint representation to integrate multiple modalities into the same latent
space can accurately represent different modalities at one scale, providing
support for fair relevance scoring. Extensive experiments have shown that
MAJORScore increases by 26.03%-64.29% for consistent modality and decreases by
13.28%-20.54% for inconsistence compared to existing methods. MAJORScore serves
as a more reliable metric for evaluating similarity on large-scale multimodal
datasets and multimodal model performance evaluation.

Abstract: In the construction industry, safety assessment is vital to ensure both the
reliability of assets and the safety of workers. Scaffolding, a key structural
support asset requires regular inspection to detect and identify alterations
from the design rules that may compromise the integrity and stability. At
present, inspections are primarily visual and are conducted by site manager or
accredited personnel to identify deviations. However, visual inspection is
time-intensive and can be susceptible to human errors, which can lead to unsafe
conditions. This paper explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
digitization to enhance the accuracy of scaffolding inspection and contribute
to the safety improvement. A cloud-based AI platform is developed to process
and analyse the point cloud data of scaffolding structure. The proposed system
detects structural modifications through comparison and evaluation of certified
reference data with the recent point cloud data. This approach may enable
automated monitoring of scaffolding, reducing the time and effort required for
manual inspections while enhancing the safety on a construction site.

Result: 图像评估器性能提升114%，方法在反事实尺寸控制上优于现有基线方法和ChatGPT-4o。

Conclusion: 该方法为反事实可控性研究奠定了基础，展示了在创意图像生成中的有效性。

Abstract: Text-to-image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale multimodal
training, yet fine-grained controllability remains a critical challenge.
Counterfactual controllability, defined as the capacity to deliberately
generate images that contradict common-sense patterns, remains a major
challenge but plays a crucial role in enabling creativity and exploratory
applications. In this work, we address this gap with a focus on counterfactual
size (e.g., generating a tiny walrus beside a giant button) and propose an
automatic prompt engineering framework that adapts base prompts into revised
prompts for counterfactual images. The framework comprises three components: an
image evaluator that guides dataset construction by identifying successful
image generations, a supervised prompt rewriter that produces revised prompts,
and a DPO-trained ranker that selects the optimal revised prompt. We construct
the first counterfactual size text-image dataset and enhance the image
evaluator by extending Grounded SAM with refinements, achieving a 114 percent
improvement over its backbone. Experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and ChatGPT-4o, establishing a
foundation for future research on counterfactual controllability.

Motivation: 解决传统光学显微镜约200nm横向分辨率限制的问题，避免使用昂贵的外部模块或专业荧光超分辨率技术，为普通显微镜用户提供经济可行的超分辨率解决方案。

Method: 使用两种自研的深度神经网络架构（O-Net和Theta-Net），在Zernike相位对比和微分干涉对比显微镜模式下，对原子力显微镜校准的纳米级特征测试目标进行超分辨率重建。

Result: 两种网络在超分辨率重建中表现良好但具有互补性：高信噪比图像适合使用O-Net模型，低信噪比图像则更适合Theta-Net模型。

Conclusion: 模型架构和源图像信噪比对深度神经网络在非荧光光学纳米显微镜中的性能至关重要，即使在相同训练数据集和训练周期下也会产生显著差异。

Abstract: The field of optical microscopy spans across numerous industries and research
domains, ranging from education to healthcare, quality inspection and analysis.
Nonetheless, a key limitation often cited by optical microscopists refers to
the limit of its lateral resolution (typically defined as ~200nm), with
potential circumventions involving either costly external modules (e.g.
confocal scan heads, etc) and/or specialized techniques [e.g. super-resolution
(SR) fluorescent microscopy]. Addressing these challenges in a normal
(non-specialist) context thus remains an aspect outside the scope of most
microscope users & facilities. This study thus seeks to evaluate an alternative
& economical approach to achieving SR optical microscopy, involving
non-fluorescent phase-modulated microscopical modalities such as Zernike phase
contrast (PCM) and differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy. Two in
silico deep neural network (DNN) architectures which we developed previously
(termed O-Net and Theta-Net) are assessed on their abilities to resolve a
custom-fabricated test target containing nanoscale features calibrated via
atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of our study demonstrate that
although both O-Net and Theta-Net seemingly performed well when super-resolving
these images, they were complementary (rather than competing) approaches to be
considered for image SR, particularly under different image signal-to-noise
ratios (SNRs). High image SNRs favoured the application of O-Net models, while
low SNRs inclined preferentially towards Theta-Net models. These findings
demonstrate the importance of model architectures (in conjunction with the
source image SNR) on model performance and the SR quality of the generated
images where DNN models are utilized for non-fluorescent optical nanoscopy,
even where the same training dataset & number of epochs are being used.

Motivation: 现有视听导航方法仅进行基础的多模态融合，忽略了更深层次的感知上下文信息，需要更有效的跨模态信息融合策略。

Method: 使用多目标架构配合精炼的Transformer机制，对跨模态信息进行过滤和选择性融合。

Result: 在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上实现了最先进性能，在成功率(SR)、路径效率(SPL)和场景适应性(SNA)方面优于现有方法，并展现出强大的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人导航中的高级多模态融合策略开辟了新途径，代码和视频已开源。

Abstract: Audiovisual embodied navigation enables robots to locate audio sources by
dynamically integrating visual observations from onboard sensors with the
auditory signals emitted by the target. The core challenge lies in effectively
leveraging multimodal cues to guide navigation. While prior works have explored
basic fusion of visual and audio data, they often overlook deeper perceptual
context. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Multi-Target Fusion for
Efficient Audio-Visual Navigation (DMTF-AVN). Our approach uses a multi-target
architecture coupled with a refined Transformer mechanism to filter and
selectively fuse cross-modal information. Extensive experiments on the Replica
and Matterport3D datasets demonstrate that DMTF-AVN achieves state-of-the-art
performance, outperforming existing methods in success rate (SR), path
efficiency (SPL), and scene adaptation (SNA). Furthermore, the model exhibits
strong scalability and generalizability, paving the way for advanced multimodal
fusion strategies in robotic navigation. The code and videos are available at

TL;DR: SAEmnesia是一种监督式稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统化概念标注实现概念-神经元的一对一映射，显著提升文本到图像扩散模型中的概念遗忘效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器虽然减少了神经元的多义性，但单个概念表示仍分布在多个潜在特征中，需要大量搜索过程来进行概念遗忘。

Method: 引入监督式稀疏自编码器训练方法，通过系统化概念标注缓解特征分裂并促进特征集中化，学习具有更强概念关联的专用神经元。

Result: 在推理时，这种可解释表示将超参数搜索减少了96.67%；在UnlearnCanvas基准测试中，比现有最佳方法提升9.22%；在顺序遗忘任务中，9对象移除的遗忘准确率提升28.4%。

Conclusion: SAEmnesia通过促进一对一概念-神经元映射，显著提高了概念遗忘的效率和准确性，在计算开销极小的情况下实现了卓越的性能。

Abstract: Effective concept unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models requires
precise localization of concept representations within the model's latent
space. While sparse autoencoders successfully reduce neuron polysemanticity
(i.e., multiple concepts per neuron) compared to the original network,
individual concept representations can still be distributed across multiple
latent features, requiring extensive search procedures for concept unlearning.
We introduce SAEmnesia, a supervised sparse autoencoder training method that
promotes one-to-one concept-neuron mappings through systematic concept
labeling, mitigating feature splitting and promoting feature centralization.
Our approach learns specialized neurons with significantly stronger concept
associations compared to unsupervised baselines. The only computational
overhead introduced by SAEmnesia is limited to cross-entropy computation during
training. At inference time, this interpretable representation reduces
hyperparameter search by 96.67% with respect to current approaches. On the
UnlearnCanvas benchmark, SAEmnesia achieves a 9.22% improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In sequential unlearning tasks, we demonstrate superior
scalability with a 28.4% improvement in unlearning accuracy for 9-object
removal.

Abstract: Deep Learning models have transformed various domains, including the
healthcare sector, particularly biomedical image classification by learning
intricate features and enabling accurate diagnostics pertaining to complex
diseases. Recent studies have adopted two different approaches to train DL
models: training from scratch and transfer learning. Both approaches demand
substantial computational time and resources due to the involvement of massive
datasets in model training. These computational demands are further increased
due to the design-space exploration required for selecting optimal
hyperparameters, which typically necessitates several training rounds. With the
growing sizes of datasets, exploring solutions to this problem has recently
gained the research community's attention. A plausible solution is to select a
subset of the dataset for training and hyperparameter search. This subset,
referred to as the corset, must be a representative set of the original
dataset. A straightforward approach to selecting the coreset could be employing
random sampling, albeit at the cost of compromising the representativeness of
the original dataset. A critical limitation of random sampling is the bias
towards the dominant classes in an imbalanced dataset. Even if the dataset has
inter-class balance, this random sampling will not capture intra-class
diversity. This study addresses this issue by introducing an intelligent,
lightweight mechanism for coreset selection. Specifically, it proposes a method
to extract intra-class diversity, forming per-class clusters that are utilized
for the final sampling. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology
by conducting extensive classification experiments on a well-known biomedical
imaging dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the
random sampling approach on several performance metrics for uniform conditions.

TL;DR: LongiMam是一个端到端的深度学习模型，通过整合当前和最多四个既往乳腺X光片，结合卷积神经网络和循环神经网络来捕捉预测乳腺癌的空间和时间模式，在真实世界不平衡数据中显著提升乳腺癌预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数深度学习模型仅使用单次或有限次数的既往乳腺X光片，且缺乏对真实世界不平衡结果分布和异质性随访的适应性。需要开发能够充分利用纵向成像数据的稳健模型来支持风险适应性乳腺癌筛查。

Method: 开发LongiMam模型，结合卷积神经网络捕捉空间模式，循环神经网络捕捉时间模式，整合当前和最多四个既往乳腺X光片。使用具有典型临床筛查不平衡病例-对照比例的大型人群筛查数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 在多个不同既往检查数量和组成的场景中，LongiMam在包含既往乳腺X光片时持续改善预测性能。既往和当前检查组合优于单次检查模型，而仅使用既往检查效果较差，强调了结合历史和近期信息的重要性。在关键风险亚组中均显示有效性，特别是在乳腺密度随时间变化的女性中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 纵向建模增强了乳腺癌预测能力，支持在筛查项目中使用重复乳腺X光片来优化风险分层。LongiMam已作为开源软件公开发布。

Abstract: Risk-adapted breast cancer screening requires robust models that leverage
longitudinal imaging data. Most current deep learning models use single or
limited prior mammograms and lack adaptation for real-world settings marked by
imbalanced outcome distribution and heterogeneous follow-up. We developed
LongiMam, an end-to-end deep learning model that integrates both current and up
to four prior mammograms. LongiMam combines a convolutional and a recurrent
neural network to capture spatial and temporal patterns predictive of breast
cancer. The model was trained and evaluated using a large, population-based
screening dataset with disproportionate case-to-control ratio typical of
clinical screening. Across several scenarios that varied in the number and
composition of prior exams, LongiMam consistently improved prediction when
prior mammograms were included. The addition of prior and current visits
outperformed single-visit models, while priors alone performed less well,
highlighting the importance of combining historical and recent information.
Subgroup analyses confirmed the model's efficacy across key risk groups,
including women with dense breasts and those aged 55 years or older. Moreover,
the model performed best in women with observed changes in mammographic density
over time. These findings demonstrate that longitudinal modeling enhances
breast cancer prediction and support the use of repeated mammograms to refine
risk stratification in screening programs. LongiMam is publicly available as
open-source software.

visual perception. In contrast, this paper explores to what extent this
correspondence also holds for a more complex brain process, namely social
cognition. To this end, we assess the alignment between popular CNN
architectures and both human behavioral and fMRI data for image valence
appraisal through a correlation analysis. We show that for this task CNNs
struggle to go beyond simple visual processing, and do not seem to reflect
higher-order brain processing. Furthermore, we present Object2Brain, a novel
framework that combines GradCAM and object detection at the CNN-filter level
with the aforementioned correlation analysis to study the influence of
different object classes on the CNN-to-human correlations. Despite similar
correlation trends, different CNN architectures are shown to display different
object class sensitivities.

### [126] [Debugging Concept Bottleneck Models through Removal and Retraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21385)
*Eric Enouen,Sainyam Galhotra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个可解释的调试框架CBDebug，用于解决概念瓶颈模型中的系统性偏差问题，通过移除和重训练两个步骤来减少模型对不良概念的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型虽然允许专家干预错误概念，但无法解决模型从有偏数据中学习捷径等系统性偏差问题。

Method: 采用两步法：1）移除步骤 - 专家识别并移除不良概念；2）重训练步骤 - 使用CBDebug方法将概念级用户反馈转化为样本级辅助标签，应用监督式偏差缓解和针对性增强。

Result: CBDebug在多个CBM架构（PIP-Net、Post-hoc CBM）和已知虚假相关基准测试中显著优于先前的重训练方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了概念瓶颈模型的系统性偏差问题，通过可解释的调试过程提高了模型的可靠性和与专家推理的一致性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) use a set of human-interpretable concepts to
predict the final task label, enabling domain experts to not only validate the
CBM's predictions, but also intervene on incorrect concepts at test time.
However, these interventions fail to address systemic misalignment between the
CBM and the expert's reasoning, such as when the model learns shortcuts from
biased data. To address this, we present a general interpretable debugging
framework for CBMs that follows a two-step process of Removal and Retraining.
In the Removal step, experts use concept explanations to identify and remove
any undesired concepts. In the Retraining step, we introduce CBDebug, a novel
method that leverages the interpretability of CBMs as a bridge for converting
concept-level user feedback into sample-level auxiliary labels. These labels
are then used to apply supervised bias mitigation and targeted augmentation,
reducing the model's reliance on undesired concepts. We evaluate our framework
with both real and automated expert feedback, and find that CBDebug
significantly outperforms prior retraining methods across multiple CBM
architectures (PIP-Net, Post-hoc CBM) and benchmarks with known spurious
correlations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ShipwreckFinder是一个开源的QGIS插件，使用深度学习从多波束声纳数据中自动检测沉船，通过数据预处理、模型推理和阈值处理生成沉船分割掩码或边界框。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉船是海洋历史的重要标记，但通过人工检查测深数据发现沉船耗时且需要专家分析，因此需要自动化工具来提高效率。

Method: 开发基于深度学习的开源工具，使用来自五大湖和爱尔兰海岸的沉船数据进行训练，并采用合成数据生成技术增加数据集规模和多样性。

Result: 与基于深度学习的ArcGIS工具包和传统的逆向洼地检测方法相比，该工具在分割性能上表现更优。

Conclusion: ShipwreckFinder提供了一个有效的开源解决方案，能够自动检测沉船，显著提高了沉船发现的效率。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce ShipwreckFinder, an open-source QGIS plugin that
detects shipwrecks from multibeam sonar data. Shipwrecks are an important
historical marker of maritime history, and can be discovered through manual
inspection of bathymetric data. However, this is a time-consuming process and
often requires expert analysis. Our proposed tool allows users to automatically
preprocess bathymetry data, perform deep learning inference, threshold model
outputs, and produce either pixel-wise segmentation masks or bounding boxes of
predicted shipwrecks. The backbone of this open-source tool is a deep learning
model, which is trained on a variety of shipwreck data from the Great Lakes and
the coasts of Ireland. Additionally, we employ synthetic data generation in
order to increase the size and diversity of our dataset. We demonstrate
superior segmentation performance with our open-source tool and training
pipeline as compared to a deep learning-based ArcGIS toolkit and a more
classical inverse sinkhole detection method. The open-source tool can be found

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了基于幅度的剪枝对神经网络可解释性的影响，发现轻中度剪枝能改善显著性图的聚焦性和忠实度，而过度剪枝会降低可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明神经网络可以在保持性能的同时大幅剪枝，但剪枝对模型可解释性的影响尚不清楚。

Method: 使用ResNet-18在ImageNette上训练，比较不同剪枝水平下Vanilla Gradients和Integrated Gradients的后验解释，评估稀疏性和忠实度，并应用CRAFT概念提取跟踪学习概念语义一致性的变化。

Result: 轻中度剪枝改善了显著性图的聚焦性和忠实度，同时保留了清晰、语义有意义的概念；而过度剪枝合并了异质特征，降低了显著性图稀疏性和概念一致性，尽管保持了准确性。

Conclusion: 剪枝可以使内部表示更符合人类注意力模式，但过度剪枝会损害可解释性。

Abstract: Prior works have shown that neural networks can be heavily pruned while
preserving performance, but the impact of pruning on model interpretability
remains unclear. In this work, we investigate how magnitude-based pruning
followed by fine-tuning affects both low-level saliency maps and high-level
concept representations. Using a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNette, we compare
post-hoc explanations from Vanilla Gradients (VG) and Integrated Gradients (IG)
across pruning levels, evaluating sparsity and faithfulness. We further apply
CRAFT-based concept extraction to track changes in semantic coherence of
learned concepts. Our results show that light-to-moderate pruning improves
saliency-map focus and faithfulness while retaining distinct, semantically
meaningful concepts. In contrast, aggressive pruning merges heterogeneous
features, reducing saliency map sparsity and concept coherence despite
maintaining accuracy. These findings suggest that while pruning can shape
internal representations toward more human-aligned attention patterns,
excessive pruning undermines interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TUN3D是首个仅使用多视角图像输入，无需真实相机位姿或深度监督，就能联合进行室内布局估计和3D物体检测的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖点云输入的局限性，因为大多数消费级相机缺乏深度传感器，而纯视觉数据更为常见。

Method: 基于轻量级稀疏卷积骨干网络，使用两个专用头部：一个用于3D物体检测，一个用于布局估计，采用新颖有效的参数化墙壁表示。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的场景理解基准测试中实现最先进性能：(i)使用真实点云，(ii)使用带位姿图像，(iii)使用无位姿图像。

Conclusion: TUN3D在3D物体检测方面与专用方法相当，同时在布局估计方面显著推进，为整体室内场景理解设定了新基准。

Abstract: Layout estimation and 3D object detection are two fundamental tasks in indoor
scene understanding. When combined, they enable the creation of a compact yet
semantically rich spatial representation of a scene. Existing approaches
typically rely on point cloud input, which poses a major limitation since most
consumer cameras lack depth sensors and visual-only data remains far more
common. We address this issue with TUN3D, the first method that tackles joint
layout estimation and 3D object detection in real scans, given multi-view
images as input, and does not require ground-truth camera poses or depth
supervision. Our approach builds on a lightweight sparse-convolutional backbone
and employs two dedicated heads: one for 3D object detection and one for layout
estimation, leveraging a novel and effective parametric wall representation.
Extensive experiments show that TUN3D achieves state-of-the-art performance
across three challenging scene understanding benchmarks: (i) using ground-truth
point clouds, (ii) using posed images, and (iii) using unposed images. While
performing on par with specialized 3D object detection methods, TUN3D
significantly advances layout estimation, setting a new benchmark in holistic
indoor scene understanding. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种创新的生成语义通信系统，通过将图像分割为关键和非关键区域来优化语义粒度，关键区域使用图像导向语义编码器处理，非关键区域采用图像到文本建模方法压缩，并采用轻量级部署策略提升资源利用率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法往往忽视图像不同区域的重要性差异，可能损害视觉关键内容的重建质量，需要更精细的语义粒度处理。

Method: 图像分割为关键和非关键区域，关键区域使用图像导向语义编码器，非关键区域采用图像到文本建模压缩，结合模型量化和低秩适应微调实现轻量级部署。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该系统在语义保真度和视觉质量方面均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的系统在图像传输任务中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has
introduced significant opportunities for enhancing the efficiency and accuracy
of image transmission within semantic communication systems. Despite these
advancements, existing methodologies often neglect the difference in importance
of different regions of the image, potentially compromising the reconstruction
quality of visually critical content. To address this issue, we introduce an
innovative generative semantic communication system that refines semantic
granularity by segmenting images into key and non-key regions. Key regions,
which contain essential visual information, are processed using an image
oriented semantic encoder, while non-key regions are efficiently compressed
through an image-to-text modeling approach. Additionally, to mitigate the
substantial storage and computational demands posed by large AI models, the
proposed system employs a lightweight deployment strategy incorporating model
quantization and low-rank adaptation fine-tuning techniques, significantly
boosting resource utilization without sacrificing performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms traditional methods in
terms of both semantic fidelity and visual quality, thereby affirming its
effectiveness for image transmission tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了骨架化尺度空间框架，通过稀疏化中轴实现形状的层次简化，克服传统骨架对噪声敏感的问题，满足尺度空间关键特性并支持从粗到细的逆过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中轴（Hamilton-Jacobi骨架）作为形状描述符对边界噪声敏感，传统修剪方法需要系统性地移除多余骨架分支，需要结合稀疏化尺度空间原理实现更好的层次简化。

Method: 引入骨架化尺度空间框架，利用中轴的稀疏化实现形状的层次简化，提供连续和离散的理论基础，并扩展了致密化概念支持从粗到细的逆过程。

Result: 通过概念验证实验，证明该框架在鲁棒骨架化、形状压缩和增材制造刚度增强等实际任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 骨架化尺度空间框架提供了满足尺度空间特性的层次形状简化方法，支持双向尺度变换，在多个实际应用中展现出良好效果。

Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi skeleton, also known as the medial axis, is a powerful
shape descriptor that represents binary objects in terms of the centres of
maximal inscribed discs. Despite its broad applicability, the medial axis
suffers from sensitivity to noise: minor boundary variations can lead to
disproportionately large and undesirable expansions of the skeleton. Classical
pruning methods mitigate this shortcoming by systematically removing extraneous
skeletal branches. This sequential simplification of skeletons resembles the
principle of sparsification scale-spaces that embed images into a family of
reconstructions from increasingly sparse pixel representations.
  We combine both worlds by introducing skeletonisation scale-spaces: They
leverage sparsification of the medial axis to achieve hierarchical
simplification of shapes. Unlike conventional pruning, our framework inherently
satisfies key scale-space properties such as hierarchical architecture,
controllable simplification, and equivariance to geometric transformations. We
provide a rigorous theoretical foundation in both continuous and discrete
formulations and extend the concept further with densification. This allows
inverse progression from coarse to fine scales and can even reach beyond the
original skeleton to produce overcomplete shape representations with relevancy
for practical applications.
  Through proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework for practical tasks including robust skeletonisation, shape
compression, and stiffness enhancement for additive manufacturing.

TL;DR: 使用单图像超分辨率模型将气候预测从12.5公里分辨率降尺度到1公里分辨率，通过气候指标评估方法验证降尺度效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气候预测空间分辨率低（12.5公里），限制了其在地方决策中的可用性，需要更高分辨率的气候预测数据。

Method: 在观测网格数据集上训练单图像超分辨率模型，然后应用于低分辨率气候预测；提出基于气候指标的评估方法，使用气象站观测数据计算气候指数来评估降尺度结果。

Result: 在日平均温度上的实验表明，单图像超分辨率模型可以降尺度气候预测，且不会增加气候指标的误差。

Conclusion: 单图像超分辨率模型能够有效提高气候预测的空间分辨率，为地方决策提供更精细的气候数据支持。

Abstract: High-resolution climate projections are essential for local decision-making.
However, available climate projections have low spatial resolution (e.g. 12.5
km), which limits their usability. We address this limitation by leveraging
single-image super-resolution models to statistically downscale climate
projections to 1-km resolution. Since high-resolution climate projections are
unavailable for training, we train models on a high-resolution observational
gridded data set and apply them to low-resolution climate projections. We
propose a climate indicator-based assessment using observed climate indices
computed at weather station locations to evaluate the downscaled climate
projections without ground-truth high-resolution climate projections.
Experiments on daily mean temperature demonstrate that single-image
super-resolution models can downscale climate projections without increasing
the error of climate indicators compared to low-resolution climate projections.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型存在被滥用的安全隐患，特别是基于图像的扰动攻击能有效生成有害输出，现有方法性能不稳定且扰动明显。

Method: 提出JaiLIP攻击方法，在图像空间中最小化清洁图像与对抗图像之间的均方误差损失与模型有害输出损失的联合目标函数。

Conclusion: 研究强调了基于图像的越狱攻击的实际挑战，以及为视觉语言模型开发高效防御机制的必要性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have remarkable abilities in generating
multimodal reasoning tasks. However, potential misuse or safety alignment
concerns of VLMs have increased significantly due to different categories of
attack vectors. Among various attack vectors, recent studies have demonstrated
that image-based perturbations are particularly effective in generating harmful
outputs. In the literature, many existing techniques have been proposed to
jailbreak VLMs, leading to unstable performance and visible perturbations. In
this study, we propose Jailbreaking with Loss-guided Image Perturbation
(JaiLIP), a jailbreaking attack in the image space that minimizes a joint
objective combining the mean squared error (MSE) loss between clean and
adversarial image with the models harmful-output loss. We evaluate our proposed
method on VLMs using standard toxicity metrics from Perspective API and
Detoxify. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates highly
effective and imperceptible adversarial images, outperforming existing methods
in producing toxicity. Moreover, we have evaluated our method in the
transportation domain to demonstrate the attacks practicality beyond toxic text
generation in specific domain. Our findings emphasize the practical challenges
of image-based jailbreak attacks and the need for efficient defense mechanisms
for VLMs.

Method: 设计了ExpertCLEF挑战赛，让4个研究团队的19个深度学习系统与9位法国植物学专家进行植物识别性能对比评估。

Result: 最先进的深度学习模型在植物识别任务上的性能已经接近最先进的人类专家水平。

Conclusion: 深度学习在生物自动识别领域取得了显著进展，其性能已逼近人类专家，但仍需考虑图像信息不完整带来的识别不确定性。

Abstract: Automated identification of plants and animals has improved considerably in
the last few years, in particular thanks to the recent advances in deep
learning. The next big question is how far such automated systems are from the
human expertise. Indeed, even the best experts are sometimes confused and/or
disagree between each others when validating visual or audio observations of
living organism. A picture actually contains only a partial information that is
usually not sufficient to determine the right species with certainty.
Quantifying this uncertainty and comparing it to the performance of automated
systems is of high interest for both computer scientists and expert
naturalists. The LifeCLEF 2018 ExpertCLEF challenge presented in this paper was
designed to allow this comparison between human experts and automated systems.
In total, 19 deep-learning systems implemented by 4 different research teams
were evaluated with regard to 9 expert botanists of the French flora. The main
outcome of this work is that the performance of state-of-the-art deep learning
models is now close to the most advanced human expertise. This paper presents
more precisely the resources and assessments of the challenge, summarizes the
approaches and systems employed by the participating research groups, and
provides an analysis of the main outcomes.

Conclusion: 这项工作为原生四边形网格生成建立了新基准，展示了将大规模自回归模型与拓扑感知的强化学习细化相结合在创建结构化3D资产方面的强大能力。

Abstract: The generation of quadrilateral-dominant meshes is a cornerstone of
professional 3D content creation. However, existing generative models generate
quad meshes by first generating triangle meshes and then merging triangles into
quadrilaterals with some specific rules, which typically produces quad meshes
with poor topology. In this paper, we introduce QuadGPT, the first
autoregressive framework for generating quadrilateral meshes in an end-to-end
manner. QuadGPT formulates this as a sequence prediction paradigm,
distinguished by two key innovations: a unified tokenization method to handle
mixed topologies of triangles and quadrilaterals, and a specialized
Reinforcement Learning fine-tuning method tDPO for better generation quality.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuadGPT significantly surpasses previous
triangle-to-quad conversion pipelines in both geometric accuracy and
topological quality. Our work establishes a new benchmark for native quad-mesh
generation and showcases the power of combining large-scale autoregressive
models with topology-aware RL refinement for creating structured 3D assets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DyME提出了一种动态多概念擦除框架，通过训练轻量级LoRA适配器并在推理时动态组合，解决了现有静态擦除方法在多概念擦除中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在生成过程中会无意中复制受版权保护的风格和视觉概念，引发法律和伦理问题。现有擦除方法无法扩展到需要同时擦除多个可能冲突概念的实用场景。

Method: DyME训练概念特定的LoRA适配器，在推理时动态组合所需适配器。引入双层正交性约束（特征级和参数级）来解耦表示偏移并强制正交适配器子空间，避免适配器间的干扰。

Result: 在ErasureBench-H和标准数据集上的实验表明，DyME持续优于现有最先进基线，在多概念擦除保真度方面表现更好，同时最小化附带退化。

Conclusion: DyME提供了一个灵活的多概念擦除框架，通过动态适配器组合和正交性约束，有效解决了多概念擦除中的干扰问题，在保持非目标内容质量的同时实现高效擦除。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) inadvertently reproduce copyrighted
styles and protected visual concepts, raising legal and ethical concerns.
Concept erasure has emerged as a safeguard, aiming to selectively suppress such
concepts through fine-tuning. However, existing methods do not scale to
practical settings where providers must erase multiple and possibly conflicting
concepts. The core bottleneck is their reliance on static erasure: a single
checkpoint is fine-tuned to remove all target concepts, regardless of the
actual erasure needs at inference. This rigid design mismatches real-world
usage, where requests vary per generation, leading to degraded erasure success
and reduced fidelity for non-target content. We propose DyME, an on-demand
erasure framework that trains lightweight, concept-specific LoRA adapters and
dynamically composes only those needed at inference. This modular design
enables flexible multi-concept erasure, but naive composition causes
interference among adapters, especially when many or semantically related
concepts are suppressed. To overcome this, we introduce bi-level orthogonality
constraints at both the feature and parameter levels, disentangling
representation shifts and enforcing orthogonal adapter subspaces. We further
develop ErasureBench-H, a new hierarchical benchmark with
brand-series-character structure, enabling principled evaluation across
semantic granularities and erasure set sizes. Experiments on ErasureBench-H and
standard datasets (e.g., CIFAR-100, Imagenette) demonstrate that DyME
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher
multi-concept erasure fidelity with minimal collateral degradation.

TL;DR: VideoJudge是一个专门用于评估视频理解模型输出的3B和7B规模多模态大语言模型，通过生成器-评估器交互训练，在多个基准测试中超越更大规模的基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标（如BLEU、ROUGE、BERTScore）无法捕捉人类判断的细微差别，而人工评估成本高昂，需要开发专门针对视频理解任务的自动评估方法。

Method: 采用生成器-评估器交互训练方法：生成器根据目标评分生成响应，评估器筛选不匹配评分的响应，从而训练专门的视频评估模型。

Result: 在四个元评估基准中的三个上，VideoJudge-7B超越了更大规模的基线模型（如Qwen2.5-VL 32B和72B），证明视频输入对视频理解任务评估至关重要。

Conclusion: 视频输入对于视频理解任务的评估至关重要，MLLM评估器优于纯LLM评估器，长链思维推理并不能改善性能，VideoJudge展示了专门化训练的有效性。

Abstract: Precisely evaluating video understanding models remains challenging: commonly
used metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore fail to capture the fineness of
human judgment, while obtaining such judgments through manual evaluation is
costly. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) or
multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) as evaluators, but their extension to video
understanding remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we introduce
VideoJudge, a 3B and 7B-sized MLLM judge specialized to evaluate outputs from
video understanding models (\textit{i.e.}, text responses conditioned on
videos). To train VideoJudge, our recipe builds on the interplay between a
generator and an evaluator: the generator is prompted to produce responses
conditioned on a target rating, and responses not matching the evaluator's
rating are discarded. Across three out of four meta-evaluation benchmarks,
VideoJudge-7B outperforms larger MLLM judge baselines such as Qwen2.5-VL (32B
and 72B). Notably, we find that LLM judges (Qwen3) models perform worse than
MLLM judges (Qwen2.5-VL) and long chain-of-thought reasoning does not improve
performance, indicating that providing video inputs is crucial for evaluation
of video understanding tasks.

TL;DR: ReVQom是一种用于多智能体协同感知的端到端特征压缩方法，通过瓶颈网络和多阶段残差向量量化将特征从8192 bpp压缩到6-30 bpp，在保持精度的同时大幅降低通信带宽需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体协同感知通过共享信息提升场景理解能力，但通信带宽限制了系统的可扩展性，需要高效的压缩方法来减少传输数据量。

Method: 使用端到端方法，先通过简单的瓶颈网络压缩特征维度，然后采用多阶段残差向量量化，仅传输每个像素的码本索引。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X数据集上实现273倍到1365倍的压缩比，在18 bpp时性能匹配或优于原始特征协同感知，在6-12 bpp时仍能保持可接受的性能。

Conclusion: ReVQom实现了高效准确的多智能体协同感知，为实际V2X部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Multi-agent collaborative perception (CP) improves scene understanding by
sharing information across connected agents such as autonomous vehicles,
unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots. Communication bandwidth, however,
constrains scalability. We present ReVQom, a learned feature codec that
preserves spatial identity while compressing intermediate features. ReVQom is
an end-to-end method that compresses feature dimensions via a simple bottleneck
network followed by multi-stage residual vector quantization (RVQ). This allows
only per-pixel code indices to be transmitted, reducing payloads from 8192 bits

*Khaloud S. AlKhalifah,Malak Mashaabi,Hend Al-Khalifa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究调查了当代文本到图像AI模型在生成沙特阿拉伯职业形象时，如何延续性别刻板印象和文化不准确性。研究发现三个主流模型都存在严重的性别失衡和文化不准确问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估AI图像生成模型在描绘沙特职业时是否反映真实的社会多样性，还是延续了训练数据中的性别和文化偏见。

Method: 使用中性提示词生成1,006张沙特56种职业的图像，由两名沙特标注员从五个维度评估：性别、服装外貌、背景环境、活动互动、年龄，并由资深研究员仲裁分歧。

Result: 三个模型都显示严重性别失衡：ImageFX 85%男性、Grok 86.6%男性、DALL-E V3 96%男性，其中DALL-E V3性别刻板印象最严重。领导和技术职位性别失衡最明显，且普遍存在服装、环境和活动方面的文化不准确性。

Conclusion: 当前AI模型反映了训练数据中的人类社会偏见，对沙特劳动力市场的性别动态和文化细微差别呈现有限。需要更多样化的训练数据、更公平的算法和更具文化敏感性的评估框架。

Abstract: This study investigates the extent to which contemporary Text-to-Image
artificial intelligence (AI) models perpetuate gender stereotypes and cultural
inaccuracies when generating depictions of professionals in Saudi Arabia. We
analyzed 1,006 images produced by ImageFX, DALL-E V3, and Grok for 56 diverse
Saudi professions using neutral prompts. Two trained Saudi annotators evaluated
each image on five dimensions: perceived gender, clothing and appearance,
background and setting, activities and interactions, and age. A third senior
researcher adjudicated whenever the two primary raters disagreed, yielding
10,100 individual judgements. The results reveal a strong gender imbalance,
with ImageFX outputs being 85\% male, Grok 86.6\% male, and DALL-E V3 96\%
male, indicating that DALL-E V3 exhibited the strongest overall gender
stereotyping. This imbalance was most evident in leadership and technical
roles. Moreover, cultural inaccuracies in clothing, settings, and depicted
activities were frequently observed across all three models.
Counter-stereotypical images often arise from cultural misinterpretations
rather than genuinely progressive portrayals. We conclude that current models
mirror societal biases embedded in their training data, generated by humans,
offering only a limited reflection of the Saudi labour market's gender dynamics
and cultural nuances. These findings underscore the urgent need for more
diverse training data, fairer algorithms, and culturally sensitive evaluation
frameworks to ensure equitable and authentic visual outputs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理增强多模态大语言模型的预训练范式，用于统一的不当内容检测，通过三个针对性预训练任务解决短视频内容与原始预训练数据之间的分布差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常为每种问题类型训练单独的小型分类模型，需要大量人工标注数据且缺乏跨问题泛化能力。

Method: 引入三个预训练任务：Caption（增强视频细节感知）、VQA（加深问题定义理解）、CoT（增强推理能力）。

Result: 实验结果表明该预训练方法显著提升了MLLM在零样本和监督微调设置下的性能，并展现出对未见问题的强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该预训练范式有效解决了短视频不当内容检测中的分布差距和复杂问题定义挑战，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Short video platforms are evolving rapidly, making the identification of
inappropriate content increasingly critical. Existing approaches typically
train separate and small classification models for each type of issue, which
requires extensive human-labeled data and lacks cross-issue generalization. We
propose a reasoning-enhanced multimodal large language model (MLLM) pretraining
paradigm for unified inappropriate content detection. To address the
distribution gap between short video content and the original pretraining data
of MLLMs, as well as the complex issue definitions, we introduce three targeted
pretraining tasks: (1) \textit{Caption}, to enhance the MLLM's perception of
video details; (2) \textit{Visual Question Answering (VQA)}, to deepen the
MLLM's understanding of issue definitions and annotation guidelines; (3)
\textit{Chain-of-Thought (CoT)}, to enhance the MLLM's reasoning capability.
Experimental results show that our pretraining approach significantly improves
the MLLM's performance in both zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
settings. In addition, our pretrained model demonstrates strong generalization
capabilities to emergent, previously unseen issues.

TL;DR: 将GUI定位重新定义为交互式搜索任务，通过光标移动来定位UI元素，解决了传统坐标预测方法在高分辨率GUI图像中的精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于坐标预测的GUI定位方法在处理高分辨率复杂布局GUI时精度不足，需要更可靠的方法来准确定位UI元素。

Method: 提出GUI-Cursor模型，将GUI定位重构为交互式搜索任务，模型通过多步骤移动光标，基于空间关系和移动历史逐步接近目标元素，使用强化学习和密集轨迹奖励函数进行训练。

Result: 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B的GUI-Cursor在ScreenSpot-v2上从88.8%提升到93.9%，在ScreenSpot-Pro上从26.8%提升到56.5%，95%的实例可在两步内解决问题。

Conclusion: 交互式搜索方法比传统坐标预测更有效，GUI-Cursor能自适应调整搜索步骤，在复杂GUI定位任务中实现最先进性能。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) grounding is commonly framed as a coordinate
prediction task -- given a natural language instruction, generate on-screen
coordinates for actions such as clicks and keystrokes. However, recent Vision
Language Models (VLMs) often fail to predict accurate numeric coordinates when
processing high-resolution GUI images with complex layouts. To address this
issue, we reframe GUI grounding as an \emph{interactive search task}, where the
VLM generates actions to move a cursor in the GUI to locate UI elements. At
each step, the model determines the target object, evaluates the spatial
relations between the cursor and the target, and moves the cursor closer to the
target conditioned on the movement history. In this interactive process, the
rendered cursor provides visual feedback to help the model align its
predictions with the corresponding on-screen locations. We train our GUI
grounding model, GUI-Cursor, using multi-step online reinforcement learning
with a dense trajectory-based reward function. Our experimental results show
that GUI-Cursor, based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, improves the GUI grounding accuracy
and achieves state-of-the-art results on ScreenSpot-v2 ($88.8\% \rightarrow
93.9\%$) and ScreenSpot-Pro ($26.8\% \rightarrow 56.5\%$). Moreover, we observe
that GUI-Cursor learns to solve the problem within two steps for 95\% of
instances and can adaptively conduct more steps on more difficult examples.

TL;DR: X-CoT是一个可解释的文本-视频检索框架，使用LLM的思维链推理替代传统的嵌入模型相似度排序，以解决数据质量问题和提升检索结果的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索系统存在两个主要问题：低质量文本-视频数据对会影响检索效果但难以识别；余弦相似度排序缺乏可解释性，限制了模型和数据的分析能力。

Method: 1. 扩展现有基准数据集，增加视频标注以支持语义理解和减少数据偏差；2. 设计检索思维链，通过成对比较步骤生成详细推理和完整排序。

Result: X-CoT在实证中提升了检索性能，并产生了详细的推理依据，同时促进了模型行为和数据质量分析。

Conclusion: X-CoT框架通过可解释的检索方法有效解决了传统嵌入模型在数据质量和可解释性方面的局限性，为文本-视频检索提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Prevalent text-to-video retrieval systems mainly adopt embedding models for
feature extraction and compute cosine similarities for ranking. However, this
design presents two limitations. Low-quality text-video data pairs could
compromise the retrieval, yet are hard to identify and examine. Cosine
similarity alone provides no explanation for the ranking results, limiting the
interpretability. We ask that can we interpret the ranking results, so as to
assess the retrieval models and examine the text-video data? This work proposes
X-CoT, an explainable retrieval framework upon LLM CoT reasoning in place of
the embedding model-based similarity ranking. We first expand the existing
benchmarks with additional video annotations to support semantic understanding
and reduce data bias. We also devise a retrieval CoT consisting of pairwise
comparison steps, yielding detailed reasoning and complete ranking. X-CoT
empirically improves the retrieval performance and produces detailed
rationales. It also facilitates the model behavior and data quality analysis.

Motivation: 手术器械的安全性需要可靠的视觉缺陷检测，但人工检查容易出错，现有的基于自然/工业图像的自动检测方法无法有效迁移到手术领域，存在误报、对小缺陷不敏感和领域偏移等问题。

Method: 整合背景掩码、基于补丁的分析策略和高效的领域自适应技术，专门针对手术器械调整无监督缺陷检测方法。

Result: 该方法能够可靠地检测手术器械图像中的细粒度缺陷，克服了现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过专门针对手术器械的适应性改进，实现了在手术器械图像中可靠检测细粒度缺陷的目标。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of surgical instruments requires reliable detection of
visual defects. However, manual inspection is prone to error, and existing
automated defect detection methods, typically trained on natural/industrial
images, fail to transfer effectively to the surgical domain. We demonstrate
that simply applying or fine-tuning these approaches leads to issues: false
positive detections arising from textured backgrounds, poor sensitivity to
small, subtle defects, and inadequate capture of instrument-specific features
due to domain shift. To address these challenges, we propose a versatile method
that adapts unsupervised defect detection methods specifically for surgical
instruments. By integrating background masking, a patch-based analysis
strategy, and efficient domain adaptation, our method overcomes these
limitations, enabling the reliable detection of fine-grained defects in
surgical instrument imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于表示对齐的方法依赖计算昂贵的大型预训练编码器，需要寻找更高效的训练策略来改进扩散模型的判别特征表示。

Method: 提出LSEP正则化，直接在网络学习动态中融入线性可分性，无需辅助编码器和表示对齐操作。

Result: 在基于流的Transformer架构（如SiT）上，训练效率和生成质量显著提升，在256×256 ImageNet数据集上FID达到1.46。

Conclusion: LSEP方法有效替代了基于对齐的方法，将线性探测直接整合到学习过程中，实现了更高效的扩散模型训练。

Abstract: Efficient training strategies for large-scale diffusion models have recently
emphasized the importance of improving discriminative feature representations
in these models. A central line of work in this direction is representation
alignment with features obtained from powerful external encoders, which
improves the representation quality as assessed through linear probing.
Alignment-based approaches show promise but depend on large pretrained
encoders, which are computationally expensive to obtain. In this work, we
propose an alternative regularization for training, based on promoting the
Linear SEParability (LSEP) of intermediate layer representations. LSEP
eliminates the need for an auxiliary encoder and representation alignment,
while incorporating linear probing directly into the network's learning
dynamics rather than treating it as a simple post-hoc evaluation tool. Our
results demonstrate substantial improvements in both training efficiency and
generation quality on flow-based transformer architectures such as SiTs,
achieving an FID of 1.46 on $256 \times 256$ ImageNet dataset.

TL;DR: 提出了一种空间正则化对比学习策略，通过整合半变异函数来建模空间相关性，解决图像地理定位中的假阴性和难负样本问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习方法忽略了地理空间中的空间依赖性，导致无法有效处理假阴性（视觉和地理相似但被标记为负样本）和难负样本（视觉相似但地理距离远）的问题。

Method: 使用半变异函数这一地理统计工具，将特征空间中的图像距离与地理距离关联起来，捕捉空间相关性中的预期视觉内容。通过拟合的半变异函数定义给定空间距离下的预期视觉差异，用于识别难负样本和假阴性。

Result: 在OSV5M数据集上的评估表明，该方法在GeoCLIP框架中有效提升了图像地理定位性能，特别是在更细粒度上的表现更好。

Conclusion: 显式建模空间先验能够显著改善基于图像的地理定位性能，证明了空间相关性在视觉地理定位中的重要性。

Abstract: Accurate and robust image-based geo-localization at a global scale is
challenging due to diverse environments, visually ambiguous scenes, and the
lack of distinctive landmarks in many regions. While contrastive learning
methods show promising performance by aligning features between street-view
images and corresponding locations, they neglect the underlying spatial
dependency in the geographic space. As a result, they fail to address the issue
of false negatives -- image pairs that are both visually and geographically
similar but labeled as negatives, and struggle to effectively distinguish hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically distant. To address
this issue, we propose a novel spatially regularized contrastive learning
strategy that integrates a semivariogram, which is a geostatistical tool for
modeling how spatial correlation changes with distance. We fit the
semivariogram by relating the distance of images in feature space to their
geographical distance, capturing the expected visual content in a spatial
correlation. With the fitted semivariogram, we define the expected visual
dissimilarity at a given spatial distance as reference to identify hard
negatives and false negatives. We integrate this strategy into GeoCLIP and
evaluate it on the OSV5M dataset, demonstrating that explicitly modeling
spatial priors improves image-based geo-localization performance, particularly
at finer granularity.

Motivation: 构建能够在单一统一架构中实现文本、语音和视频无限交互的数字人类代理，将静态肖像转化为持久智能的视听交互。

Method: 采用Thinker-Actor双变换器架构：Thinker模块使用预训练的大语言-语音模型进行感知和推理；Actor模块使用基于块的自动回归扩散模型，通过交叉注意力机制生成时间对齐的多模态响应。

Result: X-Streamer在两张A100 GPU上实时运行，能够从任意肖像维持数小时一致的视频聊天体验。

Conclusion: 该框架为交互式数字人类的统一世界建模开辟了道路，实现了实时、开放式的视频通话体验。

Abstract: We introduce X-Streamer, an end-to-end multimodal human world modeling
framework for building digital human agents capable of infinite interactions
across text, speech, and video within a single unified architecture. Starting
from a single portrait, X-Streamer enables real-time, open-ended video calls
driven by streaming multimodal inputs. At its core is a Thinker-Actor
dual-transformer architecture that unifies multimodal understanding and
generation, turning a static portrait into persistent and intelligent
audiovisual interactions. The Thinker module perceives and reasons over
streaming user inputs, while its hidden states are translated by the Actor into
synchronized multimodal streams in real time. Concretely, the Thinker leverages
a pretrained large language-speech model, while the Actor employs a chunk-wise
autoregressive diffusion model that cross-attends to the Thinker's hidden
states to produce time-aligned multimodal responses with interleaved discrete
text and audio tokens and continuous video latents. To ensure long-horizon
stability, we design inter- and intra-chunk attentions with time-aligned
multimodal positional embeddings for fine-grained cross-modality alignment and
context retention, further reinforced by chunk-wise diffusion forcing and
global identity referencing. X-Streamer runs in real time on two A100 GPUs,
sustaining hours-long consistent video chat experiences from arbitrary
portraits and paving the way toward unified world modeling of interactive
digital humans.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单张图像预测物体运动的问题，特别是在无法观察物体速度或作用力等参数的情况下。现有视频生成器虽然被视为世界模型，但在简单物理场景中的运动预测表现不佳。

Method: 采用条件生成密集轨迹网格的方法，模型架构类似于现代视频生成器，但输出运动轨迹而非像素，直接建模运动而非生成像素。

Result: 在模拟数据上表现优异，在机器人等下游应用中有效，在真实世界直觉物理数据集上显示出有前景的准确性。相比微调后的视频生成器，在简单物理场景中表现更好。

Conclusion: 直接建模运动轨迹比生成像素更有效地解决单图像运动预测问题，视频生成器因像素生成的开销而在此任务上表现受限。

Abstract: We consider the problem of forecasting motion from a single image, i.e.,
predicting how objects in the world are likely to move, without the ability to
observe other parameters such as the object velocities or the forces applied to
them. We formulate this task as conditional generation of dense trajectory
grids with a model that closely follows the architecture of modern video
generators but outputs motion trajectories instead of pixels. This approach
captures scene-wide dynamics and uncertainty, yielding more accurate and
diverse predictions than prior regressors and generators. We extensively
evaluate our method on simulated data, demonstrate its effectiveness on
downstream applications such as robotics, and show promising accuracy on
real-world intuitive physics datasets. Although recent state-of-the-art video
generators are often regarded as world models, we show that they struggle with
forecasting motion from a single image, even in simple physical scenarios such
as falling blocks or mechanical object interactions, despite fine-tuning on
such data. We show that this limitation arises from the overhead of generating
pixels rather than directly modeling motion.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解不同自监督学习架构在视频动作识别中的优势和局限性，为选择合适的特征提取方法提供实证指导。

Method: 在UCF Sports数据集上评估两种架构，通过分类准确率、聚类性能、类内一致性和类间区分度等多个维度分析特征质量。

Result: DINOv3在聚类性能（Silhouette分数0.31 vs 0.21）和姿态识别动作的区分能力（6.16倍分离比）方面表现更优，但V-JEPA2在所有动作类型上表现更稳定（方差0.094 vs 0.288）。

Conclusion: DINOv3的空间处理架构擅长静态姿态识别，但在运动依赖动作上表现下降；V-JEPA2的时间建模在不同动作类别间提供更平衡的表示质量。应根据任务需求和可靠性约束选择合适的架构。

Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of two prominent
self-supervised learning architectures for video action recognition: DINOv3,
which processes frames independently through spatial feature extraction, and
V-JEPA2, which employs joint temporal modeling across video sequences. We
evaluate both approaches on the UCF Sports dataset, examining feature quality
through multiple dimensions including classification accuracy, clustering
performance, intra-class consistency, and inter-class discrimination. Our
analysis reveals fundamental architectural trade-offs: DINOv3 achieves superior
clustering performance (Silhouette score: 0.31 vs 0.21) and demonstrates
exceptional discrimination capability (6.16x separation ratio) particularly for
pose-identifiable actions, while V-JEPA2 exhibits consistent reliability across
all action types with significantly lower performance variance (0.094 vs
0.288). Through action-specific evaluation, we identify that DINOv3's spatial
processing architecture excels at static pose recognition but shows degraded
performance on motion-dependent actions, whereas V-JEPA2's temporal modeling
provides balanced representation quality across diverse action categories.
These findings contribute to the understanding of architectural design choices
in video analysis systems and provide empirical guidance for selecting
appropriate feature extraction methods based on task requirements and
reliability constraints.

Motivation: 传统手工评估方法在自然灾害后缓慢且危险，现有计算机视觉方法仅能提供分类标签或分割掩码，无法提供全面的情境理解。

Method: 采用双架构方法：CNN-LSTM模型（基于ResNet50在EuroSat卫星图像上预训练）用于xBD数据集，Vision Transformer模型（在无人机图像上预训练）用于RescueNet数据集，结合ConceptNet和WordNet的外部语义知识扩展词汇覆盖范围。

Result: VLCE在InfoMetIC指标上达到最高95.33%，显著优于LLaVA和QwenVL等基线模型，同时保持竞争力的语义对齐性能。

Conclusion: 双架构系统通过自动化生成信息密集的描述，在改善灾难损害评估方面展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: Immediate damage assessment is essential after natural catastrophes; yet,
conventional hand evaluation techniques are sluggish and perilous. Although
satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photos offer extensive perspectives
of impacted regions, current computer vision methodologies generally yield just
classification labels or segmentation masks, so constraining their capacity to
deliver a thorough situational comprehension. We introduce the Vision Language
Caption Enhancer (VLCE), a multimodal system designed to produce comprehensive,
contextually-informed explanations of disaster imagery. VLCE employs a
dual-architecture approach: a CNN-LSTM model with a ResNet50 backbone
pretrained on EuroSat satellite imagery for the xBD dataset, and a Vision
Transformer (ViT) model pretrained on UAV pictures for the RescueNet dataset.
Both systems utilize external semantic knowledge from ConceptNet and WordNet to
expand vocabulary coverage and improve description accuracy. We assess VLCE in
comparison to leading vision-language models (LLaVA and QwenVL) utilizing
CLIPScore for semantic alignment and InfoMetIC for caption informativeness.
Experimental findings indicate that VLCE markedly surpasses baseline models,
attaining a maximum of 95.33% on InfoMetIC while preserving competitive
semantic alignment. Our dual-architecture system demonstrates significant
potential for improving disaster damage assessment by automating the production
of actionable, information-dense descriptions from satellite and drone photos.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉模型在架构和训练范式上差异很大，但缺乏系统方法来识别哪些表征特征是跨家族共享的，哪些反映了独特的计算策略。

Method: 使用一套表征相似性度量（RSA、Soft Matching、Linear Predictivity等），并采用多组学整合方法Similarity Network Fusion（SNF）来融合不同维度的相似性信息。

Result: 几何和调谐相关的度量能有效区分模型家族，而线性可解码信息更广泛共享。SNF融合后实现了比任何单一度量更强的家族分离，聚类分析揭示了监督ResNets和ViTs形成不同簇，而所有自监督模型跨架构边界聚集在一起。

Conclusion: 该生物学启发框架为视觉模型提供了原则性分类学，表明由架构和训练目标共同塑造的新兴计算策略定义了超越表面设计类别的表征结构。

Abstract: Large vision models differ widely in architecture and training paradigm, yet
we lack principled methods to determine which aspects of their representations
are shared across families and which reflect distinctive computational
strategies. We leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics, each
capturing a different facet-geometry, unit tuning, or linear decodability-and
assess family separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics
preserving geometry or tuning (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield strong family
discrimination, whereas flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show
weaker separation. These findings indicate that geometry and tuning carry
family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information is more
broadly shared. To integrate these complementary facets, we adapt Similarity
Network Fusion (SNF), a method inspired by multi-omics integration. SNF
achieves substantially sharper family separation than any individual metric and
produces robust composite signatures. Clustering of the fused similarity matrix
recovers both expected and surprising patterns: supervised ResNets and ViTs
form distinct clusters, yet all self-supervised models group together across
architectural boundaries. Hybrid architectures (ConvNeXt, Swin) cluster with
masked autoencoders, suggesting convergence between architectural modernization
and reconstruction-based training. This biology-inspired framework provides a
principled typology of vision models, showing that emergent computational
strategies-shaped jointly by architecture and training objective-define
representational structure beyond surface design categories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频基础模型缺乏明确的3D基础能力，限制了空间一致性和下游3D推理任务的实用性。需要将强大的想象先验与3D感知能力相结合。

Method: 引入交叉分支监督机制，几何线索指导视频生成，视频先验正则化3D预测，在单次前向传播中联合建模视频潜在空间和隐式3D场。

Result: 实验表明FantasyWorld有效桥接了视频想象和3D感知，在多视角一致性和风格一致性方面优于现有几何一致基线。几何分支的潜在表示可作为下游3D任务的通用表示。

Conclusion: 通过统一主干和交叉分支信息交换，FantasyWorld实现了3D感知视频生成，无需逐场景优化或微调即可支持新颖视图合成和导航等下游任务。

Abstract: High-quality 3D world models are pivotal for embodied intelligence and
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), underpinning applications such as AR/VR
content creation and robotic navigation. Despite the established strong
imaginative priors, current video foundation models lack explicit 3D grounding
capabilities, thus being limited in both spatial consistency and their utility
for downstream 3D reasoning tasks. In this work, we present FantasyWorld, a
geometry-enhanced framework that augments frozen video foundation models with a
trainable geometric branch, enabling joint modeling of video latents and an
implicit 3D field in a single forward pass. Our approach introduces
cross-branch supervision, where geometry cues guide video generation and video
priors regularize 3D prediction, thus yielding consistent and generalizable
3D-aware video representations. Notably, the resulting latents from the
geometric branch can potentially serve as versatile representations for
downstream 3D tasks such as novel view synthesis and navigation, without
requiring per-scene optimization or fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show
that FantasyWorld effectively bridges video imagination and 3D perception,
outperforming recent geometry-consistent baselines in multi-view coherence and
style consistency. Ablation studies further confirm that these gains stem from

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MORPH是一个形状无关的自回归基础模型，用于处理偏微分方程，能够处理不同维度、分辨率和物理场的异构时空数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决科学机器学习中处理异构、多模态科学观测数据的挑战，需要开发能够灵活处理不同数据维度、分辨率和物理场的统一模型。

Method: 基于卷积视觉Transformer架构，结合组件卷积处理标量和矢量通道，跨场交叉注意力建模不同物理场间信息传播，轴向注意力降低计算负担。

Result: 在多种PDE数据集上预训练后，MORPH在零样本和全样本泛化中均优于从头训练的模型，达到或超过现有最佳模型性能。

Conclusion: MORPH为学习异构多模态科学观测数据提供了灵活强大的基础架构，为可扩展和数据高效的科学机器学习开辟了道路。

Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a shape-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for
partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision
transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal
datasets of varying data dimensionality (1D--3D) at different resolutions,
multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture
combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and
vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field
cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between
different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorizes full
spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to
reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple
model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and
evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both
full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters (LoRA), MORPH
outperforms models trained from scratch in both zero-shot and full-shot
generalization. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong
baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities
present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from heterogeneous and
multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable
and data-efficient scientific machine learning.

TL;DR: 提出MS-YOLO模型，结合MobileNetV4和SlideLoss损失函数，在红外图像目标检测中实现高精度和低计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外成像在低光和恶劣天气条件下具有优势，但类别不平衡、热噪声和计算限制等问题影响模型性能

Method: 基于YOLOv8，用MobileNetV4替换CSPDarknet主干网络降低计算量，并引入SlideLoss损失函数动态强调欠代表和遮挡样本

Result: 在FLIR ADAS V2数据集上，MS-YOLO仅需6.7 GFLOPs计算量，达到竞争性mAP和优越精度

Conclusion: MS-YOLO有效平衡检测质量和计算成本，适合城市环境中的实时边缘部署

Abstract: Infrared imaging has emerged as a robust solution for urban object detection
under low-light and adverse weather conditions, offering significant advantages
over traditional visible-light cameras. However, challenges such as class
imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly
hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we
evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately
selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency.
Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4
and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet
backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead
by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce
\emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes
under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing
recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only
\textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO}
effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality
while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge
deployment in urban environments.

*Xu Yang,Gady Agam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR)，通过显式预测物体运动来更新跟踪查询，减少查询冲突，提升多目标跟踪性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based多目标跟踪框架将检测和跟踪查询在同一Transformer解码层中联合处理，导致冲突和关联精度下降

Method: 引入运动感知Transformer，显式预测跨帧物体运动来提前更新跟踪查询，减少查询碰撞

Result: 在DanceTrack上HOTA提升超过9分，达到71.3的SOTA；SportsMOT上72.2 HOTA，BDD100k上54.7 mTETA和41.6 mHOTA，均为SOTA结果

Conclusion: 在端到端Transformer中显式建模运动是实现多目标跟踪进展的简单而高效的方法

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex
object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer
end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries
jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and
degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer
(MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update
track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more
consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive
experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers
significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by
more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new
state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves
state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6
mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that
explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet
highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLiVR是一种高效的视频去雨方法，通过将时空李群微分偏置直接注入网络注意力分数中，解决了雨纹、模糊和噪声问题，同时保持时空一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决野外拍摄视频中的雨纹、模糊和噪声问题，以及相机姿态微小变化导致的跨帧不匹配和时间伪影。现有方法依赖光流或启发式对齐，计算成本高且鲁棒性差。

Method: 提出DeLiVR方法，包含两个互补组件：1) 旋转有界李相对偏置，通过紧凑预测模块预测每帧的平面内角度，实现几何一致对齐；2) 微分群位移，计算相邻帧之间的角度差异来估计速度，结合时间衰减和注意力掩码关注帧间关系。

Result: 在公开基准测试上的广泛实验结果表明该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DeLiVR通过李群表示连续几何变换，为视频建模中的空间和时间一致性提供了原则性方法，在视频去雨任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Videos captured in the wild often suffer from rain streaks, blur, and noise.
In addition, even slight changes in camera pose can amplify cross-frame
mismatches and temporal artifacts. Existing methods rely on optical flow or
heuristic alignment, which are computationally expensive and less robust. To
address these challenges, Lie groups provide a principled way to represent
continuous geometric transformations, making them well-suited for enforcing
spatial and temporal consistency in video modeling. Building on this insight,
we propose DeLiVR, an efficient video deraining method that injects
spatiotemporal Lie-group differential biases directly into attention scores of
the network. Specifically, the method introduces two complementary components.
First, a rotation-bounded Lie relative bias predicts the in-plane angle of each
frame using a compact prediction module, where normalized coordinates are
rotated and compared with base coordinates to achieve geometry-consistent
alignment before feature aggregation. Second, a differential group displacement
computes angular differences between adjacent frames to estimate a velocity.
This bias computation combines temporal decay and attention masks to focus on
inter-frame relationships while precisely matching the direction of rain
streaks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on publicly available benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了基础AI/ML模型在合成孔径雷达(SAR)目标识别任务中的可行性，通过自监督学习微调公开可用的SSL模型，开发了多个AFRL-DINOv2模型，显著超越了当前最佳SAR领域模型SARATR-X。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受到自然图像领域基础模型巨大进展的启发，这些模型通过自监督学习在web规模数据集上训练，具有下游任务适应性强、对分布偏移更鲁棒、特征可迁移性好等优势，因此希望将这项技术应用到SAR领域。

Method: 首先测试了当前最强大的视觉基础模型(DINOv2、DINOv3、PE-Core)在SAR目标识别任务中的表现，然后通过自监督微调公开可用的SSL模型，训练了多个AFRL-DINOv2模型，并分析了不同骨干网络和下游任务适应方法的性能权衡。

Result: 自监督微调SAR数据的SSL模型是可行的路径，AFRL-DINOv2模型在SAR基础模型方面达到了新的最先进水平，显著优于当前最佳SAR领域模型SARATR-X。

Conclusion: 尽管取得了积极成果，但SAR基础模型的开发仍有很长的路要走，希望这项工作能为未来的SAR基础模型建设者提供信息和启发。

Abstract: In this work we investigate the viability of foundational AI/ML models for
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object recognition tasks. We are inspired by the
tremendous progress being made in the wider community, particularly in the
natural image domain where frontier labs are training huge models on web-scale
datasets with unprecedented computing budgets. It has become clear that these
models, often trained with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), will transform how
we develop AI/ML solutions for object recognition tasks - they can be adapted
downstream with very limited labeled data, they are more robust to many forms
of distribution shift, and their features are highly transferable
out-of-the-box. For these reasons and more, we are motivated to apply this
technology to the SAR domain. In our experiments we first run tests with
today's most powerful visual foundational models, including DINOv2, DINOv3 and
PE-Core and observe their shortcomings at extracting semantically-interesting
discriminative SAR target features when used off-the-shelf. We then show that
Self-Supervised finetuning of publicly available SSL models with SAR data is a
viable path forward by training several AFRL-DINOv2s and setting a new
state-of-the-art for SAR foundation models, significantly outperforming today's
best SAR-domain model SARATR-X. Our experiments further analyze the performance
trade-off of using different backbones with different downstream
task-adaptation recipes, and we monitor each model's ability to overcome
challenges within the downstream environments (e.g., extended operating
conditions and low amounts of labeled data). We hope this work will inform and
inspire future SAR foundation model builders, because despite our positive
results, we still have a long way to go.

TL;DR: UISim是一个基于图像的UI模拟器，通过两阶段方法从屏幕图像预测和合成新的UI状态，实现动态交互式移动环境模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UI测试和AI代理训练方法依赖物理设备或静态截图分析，难以应对真实移动环境的动态多样性，阻碍了可扩展测试和智能UI代理的发展。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：给定初始手机屏幕图像和用户操作，首先预测下一个UI状态的抽象布局，然后基于预测布局合成视觉一致的新图像。

Result: 实验结果显示UISim在生成真实连贯的后续UI状态方面优于端到端UI生成基线方法。

Conclusion: UISim为UI测试、快速原型设计和合成数据生成提供实用价值，其交互能力为AI代理的UI导航任务规划等高级应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.

Conclusion: LFA-Net在资源受限环境中实现了高性能的视网膜血管分割，特别适合临床部署。

Abstract: Lightweight retinal vessel segmentation is important for the early diagnosis
of vision-threatening and systemic diseases, especially in a real-world
clinical environment with limited computational resources. Although
segmentation methods based on deep learning are improving, existing models are
still facing challenges of small vessel segmentation and high computational
costs. To address these challenges, we proposed a new vascular segmentation
network, LFA-Net, which incorporates a newly designed attention module,
LiteFusion-Attention. This attention module incorporates residual learning
connections, Vision Mamba-inspired dynamics, and modulation-based attention,
enabling the model to capture local and global context efficiently and in a
lightweight manner. LFA-Net offers high performance with 0.11 million
parameters, 0.42 MB memory size, and 4.46 GFLOPs, which make it ideal for
resource-constrained environments. We validated our proposed model on DRIVE,
STARE, and CHASE_DB with outstanding performance in terms of dice scores of
83.28, 87.44, and 84.50% and Jaccard indices of 72.85, 79.31, and 74.70%,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息的新框架，用于改进群体级情感识别（GER）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法低估了视觉场景上下文信息在建模个体关系中的重要性，同时忽视了情感标签语义信息对完整理解情感的关键作用。

Method: 包含视觉上下文编码模块（利用多尺度场景信息编码个体关系）和情感语义编码模块（使用群体级情感标签通过大语言模型生成细腻情感词汇，并通过结构化情感树精炼为全面语义表示），最后通过相似性感知交互对齐和整合视觉与语义信息。

Result: 在三个广泛采用的GER数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架通过有效整合视觉场景上下文和标签引导语义信息，显著提升了群体级情感识别的性能。

Abstract: Group-level emotion recognition (GER) aims to identify holistic emotions
within a scene involving multiple individuals. Current existed methods
underestimate the importance of visual scene contextual information in modeling
individual relationships. Furthermore, they overlook the crucial role of
semantic information from emotional labels for complete understanding of
emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that
incorporates visual scene context and label-guided semantic information to
improve GER performance. It involves the visual context encoding module that
leverages multi-scale scene information to diversely encode individual
relationships. Complementarily, the emotion semantic encoding module utilizes
group-level emotion labels to prompt a large language model to generate nuanced
emotion lexicons. These lexicons, in conjunction with the emotion labels, are
then subsequently refined into comprehensive semantic representations through
the utilization of a structured emotion tree. Finally, similarity-aware
interaction is proposed to align and integrate visual and semantic information,
thereby generating enhanced group-level emotion representations and
subsequently improving the performance of GER. Experiments on three widely
adopted GER datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: KG-SAM是一个知识引导的医学图像分割框架，通过整合解剖学先验知识、边界优化和不确定性估计，解决了SAM模型在医学图像分割中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用SAM模型到医学图像分割面临三个主要挑战：边界模糊、解剖关系建模不足以及缺乏不确定性量化。这些限制了模型在临床高风险场景中的可靠性。

Method: KG-SAM包含三个核心组件：(1)医学知识图谱编码细粒度解剖关系；(2)基于能量的条件随机场确保解剖一致性预测；(3)不确定性感知融合模块增强临床可靠性。

Result: 在多中心医学数据集上的实验表明，KG-SAM在前列腺分割中达到82.69%的平均Dice分数，在腹部分割中分别达到MRI 78.05%和CT 79.68%的显著提升。

Conclusion: KG-SAM被证明是一个鲁棒且可推广的框架，能够有效推进医学图像分割技术的发展。

Abstract: While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has achieved remarkable success in
image segmentation, its direct application to medical imaging remains hindered
by fundamental challenges, including ambiguous boundaries, insufficient
modeling of anatomical relationships, and the absence of uncertainty
quantification. To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a
knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors
with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM
incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical
relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce
anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion
module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive
experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate
segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching
78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and
generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: UniVid框架通过微调预训练的视频扩散变换器，将各种视觉任务统一表示为视觉句子，无需任务特定修改即可处理多模态任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大语言模型统一处理多种任务的启发，研究者希望将这种范式扩展到视觉领域，但现有方法需要跨模态和源的任务特定预训练，成本高且可扩展性差。

Method: 提出UniVid框架，将任务表示为视觉句子，其中上下文序列定义任务和输出模态，通过微调预训练视频扩散变换器来处理各种视觉任务。

Result: 尽管仅使用自然视频数据训练，UniVid在跨模态推理（图像和视频组合）和跨源任务（自然到标注数据）上都表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 预训练视频生成模型有潜力作为视觉建模的可扩展统一基础，理解和生成任务可以通过简单反转视觉句子顺序来切换。

Abstract: Large language models, trained on extensive corpora, successfully unify
diverse linguistic tasks within a single generative framework. Inspired by
this, recent works like Large Vision Model (LVM) extend this paradigm to vision
by organizing tasks into sequential visual sentences, where visual prompts
serve as the context to guide outputs. However, such modeling requires
task-specific pre-training across modalities and sources, which is costly and
limits scalability to unseen tasks. Given that pre-trained video generation
models inherently capture temporal sequence dependencies, we explore a more
unified and scalable alternative: can a pre-trained video generation model
adapt to diverse image and video tasks? To answer this, we propose UniVid, a
framework that fine-tunes a video diffusion transformer to handle various
vision tasks without task-specific modifications. Tasks are represented as
visual sentences, where the context sequence defines both the task and the
expected output modality. We evaluate the generalization of UniVid from two
perspectives: (1) cross-modal inference with contexts composed of both images
and videos, extending beyond LVM's uni-modal setting; (2) cross-source tasks
from natural to annotated data, without multi-source pre-training. Despite
being trained solely on natural video data, UniVid generalizes well in both
settings. Notably, understanding and generation tasks can easily switch by
simply reversing the visual sentence order in this paradigm. These findings
highlight the potential of pre-trained video generation models to serve as a
scalable and unified foundation for vision modeling. Our code will be released
at https://github.com/CUC-MIPG/UniVid.

TL;DR: 提出了一种保持空间完整性的token合并方法，解决了现代ViT架构中空间设计对token缩减的挑战，实现了与空间架构的无缝兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代ViT骨干网络采用窗口注意力、分解相对位置编码等空间架构设计，这些架构对token缩减提出了新挑战，因为现有方法无法保持这些架构所依赖的空间结构。

Method: 采用2D缩减策略强制执行结构化token布局、空间感知合并算法保持相对token位置、新颖的最大幅度维度token表示保留显著特征。

Result: 在空间和非空间架构上均取得最先进结果：在SAM-H上实现1.25倍加速且COCO上mIOU仅下降0.7%；在DeiT-B上实现1.15倍加速且ImageNet上top-1准确率无下降。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，既能利用空间布局中不均匀的信息分布，又能保持合并后的空间结构，在开箱即用和微调场景下均表现优异。

Abstract: Many modern ViT backbones adopt spatial architectural designs, such as window
attention, decomposed relative positional embeddings in SAM, and RoPE in
DINOv3. Such architectures impose new challenges on token reduction, as the
vast majority of existing methods fail to preserve the spatial structure these
architectures depend on. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective
token merging method that maintains spatial integrity, enabling seamless
compatibility with spatial architectures. We reconcile two seemingly
conflicting requirements: (i)exploiting the uneven information distribution
across the spatial layout while (ii)preserving the spatial structure
post-merging. Our approach employs (i)a 2D reduction strategy to enforce
structured token layouts, (ii)a spatial-aware merging algorithm that maintains
relative token positions, and (iii)a novel max-magnitude-per-dimension token
representation that preserves salient features. Our method demonstrates strong
performance both off-the-shelf and with fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art
results on spatial and non-spatial architectures across various vision tasks.
Specifically, we achieve 1.25x speedup on SAM-H with only 0.7% mIOU drop
evaluated on COCO off-the-shelf, and 1.15x speedup on DeiT-B with no top-1
accuracy drop on ImageNet within just one epoch of fine-tuning.

Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型在多模态深度伪造检测中存在局限性，难以捕捉细微伪造线索、解决跨模态不一致性以及执行任务对齐检索。

Method: 采用GASP-ICL框架，包括MDD适配的特征提取器检索对齐的图像-文本对，设计图结构泰勒自适应评分器捕获跨样本关系并传播查询对齐信号。

Result: 在四种伪造类型上的实验表明，GASP-ICL超越了强基线方法，在不进行LVLM微调的情况下实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: GASP-ICL通过语义对齐的任务相关演示选择，有效增强了LVLMs在多模态深度伪造检测中的鲁棒性，提供了一种无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal deepfake detection (MDD) aims to uncover manipulations across
visual, textual, and auditory modalities, thereby reinforcing the reliability
of modern information systems. Although large vision-language models (LVLMs)
exhibit strong multimodal reasoning, their effectiveness in MDD is limited by
challenges in capturing subtle forgery cues, resolving cross-modal
inconsistencies, and performing task-aligned retrieval. To this end, we propose
Guided Adaptive Scorer and Propagation In-Context Learning (GASP-ICL), a
training-free framework for MDD. GASP-ICL employs a pipeline to preserve
semantic relevance while injecting task-aware knowledge into LVLMs. We leverage
an MDD-adapted feature extractor to retrieve aligned image-text pairs and build
a candidate set. We further design the Graph-Structured Taylor Adaptive Scorer
(GSTAS) to capture cross-sample relations and propagate query-aligned signals,
producing discriminative exemplars. This enables precise selection of
semantically aligned, task-relevant demonstrations, enhancing LVLMs for robust
MDD. Experiments on four forgery types show that GASP-ICL surpasses strong
baselines, delivering gains without LVLM fine-tuning.

Result: 在视频动作识别实验中，与最先进方法相比证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: ProDA框架能够有效从复杂场景中解耦指定动作，提升多动作场景下的识别性能

Abstract: Action recognition is a fundamental task in video understanding. Existing
methods typically extract unified features to process all actions in one video,
which makes it challenging to model the interactions between different objects
in multi-action scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we explore disentangling
any specified actions from complex scenes as an effective solution. In this
paper, we propose Prompt-guided Disentangled Representation for Action
Recognition (ProDA), a novel framework that disentangles any specified actions
from a multi-action scene. ProDA leverages Spatio-temporal Scene Graphs (SSGs)
and introduces Dynamic Prompt Module (DPM) to guide a Graph Parsing Neural
Network (GPNN) in generating action-specific representations. Furthermore, we
design a video-adapted GPNN that aggregates information using dynamic weights.
Experiments in video action recognition demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach when compared with the state-of-the-art methods. Our code can be found

Abstract: The rise in harmful online content not only distorts public discourse but
also poses significant challenges to maintaining a healthy digital environment.
In response to this, we introduce a multimodal dataset uniquely crafted for
identifying hate in digital content. Central to our methodology is the
innovative application of watermarked, stability-enhanced, stable diffusion
techniques combined with the Digital Attention Analysis Module (DAAM). This
combination is instrumental in pinpointing the hateful elements within images,
thereby generating detailed hate attention maps, which are used to blur these
regions from the image, thereby removing the hateful sections of the image. We
release this data set as a part of the dehate shared task. This paper also
describes the details of the shared task. Furthermore, we present DeHater, a
vision-language model designed for multimodal dehatification tasks. Our
approach sets a new standard in AI-driven image hate detection given textual
prompts, contributing to the development of more ethical AI applications in
social media.

Conclusion: MIRG-RL框架有效解决了跨图像歧义问题，显著提升了多图像推理和定位能力，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Multi-image reasoning and grounding require understanding complex cross-image
relationships at both object levels and image levels. Current Large Visual
Language Models (LVLMs) face two critical challenges: the lack of cross-image
reasoning capabilities and insufficient cross-image reference reward modeling.
To address these issues, we propose a unified framework - Multi-Image Reasoning
and Grounding with Reinforcement Learning (MIRG-RL). Specifically, our
two-stage training paradigm combines supervised fine-tuning with annotated
trajectories and image-aware reinforcement learning optimization, progressively
developing multi-image reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we innovatively
propose a method for constructing the trajectory data, which integrates
object-level and image-level annotation information, and use this method to
generate a lightweight reasoning-enhanced dataset. To effectively resolve
cross-image ambiguities, we design an image-aware RL policy with dual reward
functions for objects and images. Experiments demonstrate that MIRG-RL achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in multi-image grounding benchmarks,
attaining 64.82% on cross-image reasoning tasks - exceeding the previous best
method by 1%. The code and dataset have been released at

Conclusion: LongScape通过创新的分块和专家混合机制，有效解决了长序列视频生成的挑战，为高质量的具身操作数据生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Video-based world models hold significant potential for generating
high-quality embodied manipulation data. However, current video generation
methods struggle to achieve stable long-horizon generation: classical
diffusion-based approaches often suffer from temporal inconsistency and visual
drift over multiple rollouts, while autoregressive methods tend to compromise
on visual detail. To solve this, we introduce LongScape, a hybrid framework
that adaptively combines intra-chunk diffusion denoising with inter-chunk
autoregressive causal generation. Our core innovation is an action-guided,
variable-length chunking mechanism that partitions video based on the semantic
context of robotic actions. This ensures each chunk represents a complete,
coherent action, enabling the model to flexibly generate diverse dynamics. We
further introduce a Context-aware Mixture-of-Experts (CMoE) framework that
adaptively activates specialized experts for each chunk during generation,
guaranteeing high visual quality and seamless chunk transitions. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves stable and consistent
long-horizon generation over extended rollouts. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 现有视频生成世界模型依赖像素级重建，存在视觉冗余问题，而潜在世界模型虽然紧凑但忽略了精细细节。需要一种能同时利用运动感知表示和精细视觉特征的方法。

Method: MoWM框架使用潜在模型的运动感知表示作为高级先验，指导从像素空间模型中提取精细视觉特征，从而突出对动作解码有用的视觉细节。

Result: 在CALVIN基准上的广泛评估表明，该方法实现了最先进的任务成功率，并具有优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MoWM通过混合世界模型融合有效解决了具身动作规划问题，为未来研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Embodied action planning is a core challenge in robotics, requiring models to
generate precise actions from visual observations and language instructions.
While video generation world models are promising, their reliance on
pixel-level reconstruction often introduces visual redundancies that hinder
action decoding and generalization. Latent world models offer a compact,
motion-aware representation, but overlook the fine-grained details critical for
precise manipulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoWM, a
mixture-of-world-model framework that fuses representations from hybrid world
models for embodied action planning. Our approach uses motion-aware
representations from a latent model as a high-level prior, which guides the
extraction of fine-grained visual features from the pixel space model. This
design allows MoWM to highlight the informative visual details needed for
action decoding. Extensive evaluations on the CALVIN benchmark demonstrate that
our method achieves state-of-the-art task success rates and superior
generalization. We also provide a comprehensive analysis of the strengths of
each feature space, offering valuable insights for future research in embodied
planning. The code is available at: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/MoWM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹控制方法要么需要大量训练资源，要么专为U-Net设计，未能充分利用DiT的优越性能。

Method: 使用LLM分离前景背景提示词，提出STD-RoPE通过修改前景token的位置嵌入消除跨帧空间差异，增强轨迹控制。

Result: 实验表明该方法在视频质量和轨迹可控性方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DiTraj为DiT-based视频生成提供了有效的训练免费轨迹控制方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiT)-based video generation models with 3D full
attention exhibit strong generative capabilities. Trajectory control represents
a user-friendly task in the field of controllable video generation. However,
existing methods either require substantial training resources or are
specifically designed for U-Net, do not take advantage of the superior
performance of DiT. To address these issues, we propose DiTraj, a simple but
effective training-free framework for trajectory control in text-to-video
generation, tailored for DiT. Specifically, first, to inject the object's
trajectory, we propose foreground-background separation guidance: we use the
Large Language Model (LLM) to convert user-provided prompts into foreground and
background prompts, which respectively guide the generation of foreground and
background regions in the video. Then, we analyze 3D full attention and explore
the tight correlation between inter-token attention scores and position
embedding. Based on this, we propose inter-frame Spatial-Temporal Decoupled
3D-RoPE (STD-RoPE). By modifying only foreground tokens' position embedding,
STD-RoPE eliminates their cross-frame spatial discrepancies, strengthening
cross-frame attention among them and thus enhancing trajectory control.
Additionally, we achieve 3D-aware trajectory control by regulating the density
of position embedding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
outperforms previous methods in both video quality and trajectory
controllability.

Motivation: Transformer模型在问答任务中表现优异，但多跳推理（需要结合多个段落证据）仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 在检索增强生成框架下比较余弦相似度、最大边际相关性和混合方法（结合稠密嵌入、词汇重叠和重排序），并采用EfficientRAG管道进行查询优化。

Conclusion: 混合检索增强生成为多跳问答提供了实用的零样本解决方案，在准确性、效率和可解释性之间取得了平衡。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have advanced the field of question answering, but
multi-hop reasoning, where answers require combining evidence across multiple
passages, remains difficult. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of
retrieval strategies for multi-hop question answering within a
retrieval-augmented generation framework. We compare cosine similarity, maximal
marginal relevance, and a hybrid method that integrates dense embeddings with
lexical overlap and re-ranking. To further improve retrieval, we adapt the
EfficientRAG pipeline for query optimization, introducing token labeling and
iterative refinement while maintaining efficiency. Experiments on the HotpotQA
dataset show that the hybrid approach substantially outperforms baseline
methods, achieving a relative improvement of 50 percent in exact match and 47
percent in F1 score compared to cosine similarity. Error analysis reveals that
hybrid retrieval improves entity recall and evidence complementarity, while
remaining limited in handling distractors and temporal reasoning. Overall, the
results suggest that hybrid retrieval-augmented generation provides a practical
zero-shot solution for multi-hop question answering, balancing accuracy,
efficiency, and interpretability.

TL;DR: 提出HDR-4DGS方法解决HDR动态新视角合成问题，通过动态色调映射模块连接HDR和LDR域，实现时空辐射一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR新视角合成方法主要关注静态场景，但现实场景常包含动态元素和时变光照，需要同时建模时间辐射变化和3D转换。

Method: 基于高斯泼溅的架构，引入动态色调映射模块，根据时间维度上辐射分布变化动态调整色调映射函数。

Result: 在定量性能和视觉保真度上均超越现有最先进方法，实现任意视角和时间点的真实感HDR渲染。

Conclusion: HDR-4DGS成功解决了动态场景下的HDR新视角合成挑战，为更真实的3D建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range Novel View Synthesis (HDR NVS) seeks to learn an HDR 3D
model from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) training images captured under conventional
imaging conditions. Current methods primarily focus on static scenes,
implicitly assuming all scene elements remain stationary and non-living.
However, real-world scenarios frequently feature dynamic elements, such as
moving objects, varying lighting conditions, and other temporal events, thereby
presenting a significantly more challenging scenario. To address this gap, we
propose a more realistic problem named HDR Dynamic Novel View Synthesis (HDR
DNVS), where the additional dimension ``Dynamic'' emphasizes the necessity of
jointly modeling temporal radiance variations alongside sophisticated 3D
translation between LDR and HDR. To tackle this complex, intertwined challenge,
we introduce HDR-4DGS, a Gaussian Splatting-based architecture featured with an
innovative dynamic tone-mapping module that explicitly connects HDR and LDR
domains, maintaining temporal radiance coherence by dynamically adapting
tone-mapping functions according to the evolving radiance distributions across
the temporal dimension. As a result, HDR-4DGS achieves both temporal radiance
consistency and spatially accurate color translation, enabling photorealistic
HDR renderings from arbitrary viewpoints and time instances. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that HDR-4DGS surpasses existing state-of-the-art
methods in both quantitative performance and visual fidelity. Source code will
be released.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖高分辨率多视角图像，难以在低分辨率图像上泛化。多视角超分辨率方法仅限于静态物体，不适用于可变形的手部。

Method: 提出几何感知隐式图像函数(GIIF)，通过联合优化隐式图像函数和显式3D手部形状，利用手部先验知识对粗输入图像进行上采样。

Result: 在InterHand2.6M和Goliath数据集上，SRHand在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有图像上采样和3D手部重建方法。

Conclusion: SRHand能够从低分辨率图像重建出包含皱纹、指甲等精细细节的3D手部几何和纹理图像，保持多视角和姿态一致性。

Abstract: Reconstructing detailed hand avatars plays a crucial role in various
applications. While prior works have focused on capturing high-fidelity hand
geometry, they heavily rely on high-resolution multi-view image inputs and
struggle to generalize on low-resolution images. Multi-view image
super-resolution methods have been proposed to enforce 3D view consistency.
These methods, however, are limited to static objects/scenes with fixed
resolutions and are not applicable to articulated deformable hands. In this
paper, we propose SRHand (Super-Resolution Hand), the method for reconstructing
detailed 3D geometry as well as textured images of hands from low-resolution
images. SRHand leverages the advantages of implicit image representation with
explicit hand meshes. Specifically, we introduce a geometric-aware implicit
image function (GIIF) that learns detailed hand prior by upsampling the coarse
input images. By jointly optimizing the implicit image function and explicit 3D
hand shapes, our method preserves multi-view and pose consistency among
upsampled hand images, and achieves fine-detailed 3D reconstruction (wrinkles,
nails). In experiments using the InterHand2.6M and Goliath datasets, our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art image upsampling methods adapted to
hand datasets, and 3D hand reconstruction methods, quantitatively and
qualitatively. Project page: https://yunminjin2.github.io/projects/srhand

TL;DR: 本文质疑当前AI生成图像检测研究过于关注"假"图像而忽视了对"真实"图像的明确定义和数据收集，指出现代智能手机拍摄的图像实际上也经过神经网络处理，与生成图像有相似之处，呼吁重新思考"真实"图像的概念。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像生成技术的普及引发了对其滥用的担忧，但现有检测方法主要依赖过时的低分辨率真实图像数据集，忽视了现代摄影技术中神经网络处理图像的实际情况。

Method: 通过分析当前图像检测研究现状，指出其依赖ImageNet等老旧数据集的问题，并论证现代智能手机图像形成算法与生成式AI的相似性。

Result: 发现当前"假"图像检测方法存在根本性缺陷，因为"真实"图像的定义已变得模糊，现代摄影技术本身就包含神经网络处理过程。

Conclusion: 需要重新定义"真实"图像的概念，建立新的基准数据集，并质疑检测"假"图像这一目标本身是否合理。

Abstract: The wide availability and low usability barrier of modern image generation
models has triggered the reasonable fear of criminal misconduct and negative
social implications. The machine learning community has been engaging this
problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic
solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially
manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical
solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too
much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear
definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what
is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis
shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current
"fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution
datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the
acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over
the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones
which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over
time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation
algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related
to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to
re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to
raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of
research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake"
images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear
technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: Aes-R1是一个基于强化学习的多模态美学评估框架，通过构建高质量的美学推理数据和使用新颖的RAPO算法，提升多模态大语言模型在美学评分和推理方面的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像美学评估方面具有潜力，但由于缺乏多模态美学推理数据和美学判断的主观性，难以生成准确的美学判断和可解释的推理过程。

Method: 提出Aes-R1框架：1）使用AesCoT流程构建和筛选高质量的美学推理数据用于冷启动；2）训练模型在评分前生成结构化解释；3）采用RAPO强化学习算法联合优化绝对分数回归和相对排序，提升单图像准确性和跨图像偏好判断。

Result: 实验表明Aes-R1将骨干模型的平均PLCC/SRCC分别提升了47.9%/34.8%，超越了同类规模的最先进基线模型。消融研究验证了在有限监督和分布外场景下的鲁棒泛化能力。

Conclusion: Aes-R1使多模态大语言模型能够生成有依据的解释和可信的分数，在一个统一框架中增强了美学评分和推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are well suited to image aesthetic
assessment, as they can capture high-level aesthetic features leveraging their
cross-modal understanding capacity. However, the scarcity of multimodal
aesthetic reasoning data and the inherently subjective nature of aesthetic
judgment make it difficult for MLLMs to generate accurate aesthetic judgments
with interpretable rationales. To this end, we propose Aes-R1, a comprehensive
aesthetic reasoning framework with reinforcement learning (RL). Concretely,
Aes-R1 integrates a pipeline, AesCoT, to construct and filter high-quality
chain-of-thought aesthetic reasoning data used for cold-start. After teaching
the model to generate structured explanations prior to scoring, we then employ
the Relative-Absolute Policy Optimization (RAPO), a novel RL algorithm that
jointly optimizes absolute score regression and relative ranking order,
improving both per-image accuracy and cross-image preference judgments. Aes-R1
enables MLLMs to generate grounded explanations alongside faithful scores,
thereby enhancing aesthetic scoring and reasoning in a unified framework.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Aes-R1 improves the backbone's average
PLCC/SRCC by 47.9%/34.8%, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines of similar
size. More ablation studies validate Aes-R1's robust generalization under
limited supervision and in out-of-distribution scenarios.

Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with
the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years.
However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1)
Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits,
which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2)
Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts
when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical
deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework
integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis.
Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a
lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual
synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible
lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the
occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects
to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model
eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby
exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive
diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the
perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer
architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource
research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub
achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion
robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video
quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual
dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at

Motivation: 现有的3D生成方法缺乏对物体运动的精确控制能力，用户难以在生成的3D场景中定义和实现物体的特定运动轨迹。

Method: 三阶段流程：1) 使用2D高斯泼溅和全景图像增强文本到3D背景生成；2) 通过图像到3D模型提取物体网格，物理感知定位到场景中；3) 基于部件增强的运动条件视频扩散模型实现时序动画。

Conclusion: Drag4D提供了一个统一的架构，成功实现了3D场景中物体运动的精确控制，为交互式3D内容创作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Drag4D, an interactive framework that integrates object motion
control within text-driven 3D scene generation. This framework enables users to
define 3D trajectories for the 3D objects generated from a single image,
seamlessly integrating them into a high-quality 3D background. Our Drag4D
pipeline consists of three stages. First, we enhance text-to-3D background
generation by applying 2D Gaussian Splatting with panoramic images and
inpainted novel views, resulting in dense and visually complete 3D
reconstructions. In the second stage, given a reference image of the target
object, we introduce a 3D copy-and-paste approach: the target instance is
extracted in a full 3D mesh using an off-the-shelf image-to-3D model and
seamlessly composited into the generated 3D scene. The object mesh is then
positioned within the 3D scene via our physics-aware object position learning,
ensuring precise spatial alignment. Lastly, the spatially aligned object is
temporally animated along a user-defined 3D trajectory. To mitigate motion
hallucination and ensure view-consistent temporal alignment, we develop a
part-augmented, motion-conditioned video diffusion model that processes
multiview image pairs together with their projected 2D trajectories. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our unified architecture through evaluations
at each stage and in the final results, showcasing the harmonized alignment of
user-controlled object motion within a high-quality 3D background.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频和图像到视频生成方法在控制运动时序方面存在局限，而音频提供了与视频运动对齐的时间线索，是时序控制视频生成的有前景条件。

Method: 基于预训练视频骨干网络，引入两个关键组件：1) 运动感知损失，强调在高运动区域的学习；2) 音频同步引导，使用视觉对齐的无音频层模型来引导完整模型，在推理时更好地利用音频线索。

Result: 在AVSync15和The Greatest Hits数据集上的实验表明，Syncphony在同步精度和视觉质量方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Syncphony通过创新的运动感知损失和音频同步引导机制，成功实现了音频到视频的高质量同步生成，为解决视频生成的时序控制问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Text-to-video and image-to-video generation have made rapid progress in
visual quality, but they remain limited in controlling the precise timing of
motion. In contrast, audio provides temporal cues aligned with video motion,
making it a promising condition for temporally controlled video generation.
However, existing audio-to-video (A2V) models struggle with fine-grained
synchronization due to indirect conditioning mechanisms or limited temporal
modeling capacity. We present Syncphony, which generates 380x640 resolution,
24fps videos synchronized with diverse audio inputs. Our approach builds upon a
pre-trained video backbone and incorporates two key components to improve
synchronization: (1) Motion-aware Loss, which emphasizes learning at
high-motion regions; (2) Audio Sync Guidance, which guides the full model using
a visually aligned off-sync model without audio layers to better exploit audio
cues at inference while maintaining visual quality. To evaluate
synchronization, we propose CycleSync, a video-to-audio-based metric that
measures the amount of motion cues in the generated video to reconstruct the
original audio. Experiments on AVSync15 and The Greatest Hits datasets
demonstrate that Syncphony outperforms existing methods in both synchronization
accuracy and visual quality. Project page is available at:

Result: 在LEVIR-CD、WHU-CD和SYSU-CD三个数据集上的实验表明，LG-CD模型持续优于最先进的变化检测方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用多模态信息为实现广义变化检测提供了新思路，证明了语言引导在遥感变化检测中的有效性。

Abstract: Remote Sensing Change Detection (RSCD) typically identifies changes in land
cover or surface conditions by analyzing multi-temporal images. Currently, most
deep learning-based methods primarily focus on learning unimodal visual
information, while neglecting the rich semantic information provided by
multimodal data such as text. To address this limitation, we propose a novel
Language-Guided Change Detection model (LG-CD). This model leverages natural
language prompts to direct the network's attention to regions of interest,
significantly improving the accuracy and robustness of change detection.
Specifically, LG-CD utilizes a visual foundational model (SAM2) as a feature
extractor to capture multi-scale pyramid features from high-resolution to
low-resolution across bi-temporal remote sensing images. Subsequently,
multi-layer adapters are employed to fine-tune the model for downstream tasks,
ensuring its effectiveness in remote sensing change detection. Additionally, we
design a Text Fusion Attention Module (TFAM) to align visual and textual
information, enabling the model to focus on target change regions using text
prompts. Finally, a Vision-Semantic Fusion Decoder (V-SFD) is implemented,
which deeply integrates visual and semantic information through a
cross-attention mechanism to produce highly accurate change detection masks.
Our experiments on three datasets (LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD) demonstrate
that LG-CD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art change detection methods.
Furthermore, our approach provides new insights into achieving generalized
change detection by leveraging multimodal information.

Motivation: 现有文本驱动方法擅长纹理操作但缺乏精确空间控制，拖拽驱动方法主要修改形状结构但缺乏细粒度纹理指导，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 提出点云确定性拖拽增强潜在空间布局控制，以及拖拽-文本引导去噪在去噪过程中动态平衡两种条件的影响。

Result: 方法在联合编辑中实现高保真度，在单独文本或拖拽设置下也达到或超越专门方法的性能。

Conclusion: 建立了一个多功能且可泛化的可控图像操作解决方案，支持灵活编辑模式。

Abstract: This paper explores image editing under the joint control of text and drag
interactions. While recent advances in text-driven and drag-driven editing have
achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from complementary limitations:
text-driven methods excel in texture manipulation but lack precise spatial
control, whereas drag-driven approaches primarily modify shape and structure
without fine-grained texture guidance. To address these limitations, we propose
a unified diffusion-based framework for joint drag-text image editing,
integrating the strengths of both paradigms. Our framework introduces two key
innovations: (1) Point-Cloud Deterministic Drag, which enhances latent-space
layout control through 3D feature mapping, and (2) Drag-Text Guided Denoising,
dynamically balancing the influence of drag and text conditions during
denoising. Notably, our model supports flexible editing modes - operating with
text-only, drag-only, or combined conditions - while maintaining strong
performance in each setting. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method not only achieves high-fidelity joint editing but
also matches or surpasses the performance of specialized text-only or drag-only
approaches, establishing a versatile and generalizable solution for
controllable image manipulation. Code will be made publicly available to
reproduce all results presented in this work.

Motivation: 北欧地区无人机图像中的车辆检测面临强可见性挑战和雪覆盖引起的域偏移问题，虽然标注数据昂贵，但无标注数据通过无人机飞行即可廉价获取。

Method: 提出sideload-CL-adaptation框架：预训练阶段通过对比学习在无标注数据上训练CNN表示提取器，微调阶段将其侧载到冻结的YOLO11n骨干网络中，并比较不同融合方法和粒度。

Result: 在NVD数据集上，提出的sideload-CL-adaptation模型在mAP50指标上提升了3.8%到9.5%的检测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用廉价无标注数据解决了北欧雪覆盖环境下的车辆检测挑战，为轻量级模型在复杂环境下的性能提升提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Aside from common challenges in remote sensing like small, sparse targets and
computation cost limitations, detecting vehicles from UAV images in the Nordic
regions faces strong visibility challenges and domain shifts caused by diverse
levels of snow coverage. Although annotated data are expensive, unannotated
data is cheaper to obtain by simply flying the drones. In this work, we
proposed a sideload-CL-adaptation framework that enables the use of unannotated
data to improve vehicle detection using lightweight models. Specifically, we
propose to train a CNN-based representation extractor through contrastive
learning on the unannotated data in the pretraining stage, and then sideload it
to a frozen YOLO11n backbone in the fine-tuning stage. To find a robust
sideload-CL-adaptation, we conducted extensive experiments to compare various
fusion methods and granularity. Our proposed sideload-CL-adaptation model
improves the detection performance by 3.8% to 9.5% in terms of mAP50 on the NVD
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法要么需要特定模型的反转设计，要么需要大量优化，难以利用最新的图像到视频模型将图像编辑能力迁移到视频领域。

Method: 使用向量场校正与样本偏差将源视频信息融入去噪过程，通过结构运动保持初始化生成运动感知的时间相关噪声，并采用偏差缓存机制减少计算开销。

Result: 评估显示该方法在编辑质量和一致性方面优于现有方法，提供了轻量级的即插即用解决方案。

Conclusion: IF-V2V方法成功实现了无需反转的视频编辑，能够有效利用现有图像到视频模型，在保持计算效率的同时提供高质量的编辑效果。

Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing,
which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging
challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require
inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting
their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to
transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To
this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt
off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without
significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector
Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the
source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into
the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video
in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving
Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with
structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism
to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector
rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency
over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to
realize visual creativity.

Motivation: 传统多视角计数方法主要依赖全监督学习，需要大量标注数据。本文旨在通过自监督学习减轻对标注数据的依赖。

Method: 使用神经体积渲染学习场景的隐式表示，通过可微分神经渲染重建连续几何形状和复杂视角相关的外观。该方法可无缝集成到现有框架中。

Result: 在多个多视角计数基准测试中，SSLCounter不仅达到最先进性能，而且在仅使用70%训练数据时仍能保持竞争性表现，展示了优越的数据效率。

Conclusion: SSLCounter通过自监督学习和神经体积渲染，有效解决了多视角计数中对大规模标注数据的依赖问题，具有出色的数据效率和性能表现。

Abstract: Multi-view counting (MVC) methods have attracted significant research
attention and stimulated remarkable progress in recent years. Despite their
success, most MVC methods have focused on improving performance by following
the fully supervised learning (FSL) paradigm, which often requires large
amounts of annotated data. In this work, we propose SSLCounter, a novel
self-supervised learning (SSL) framework for MVC that leverages neural
volumetric rendering to alleviate the reliance on large-scale annotated
datasets. SSLCounter learns an implicit representation w.r.t. the scene,
enabling the reconstruction of continuous geometry shape and the complex,
view-dependent appearance of their 2D projections via differential neural
rendering. Owing to its inherent flexibility, the key idea of our method can be
seamlessly integrated into exsiting frameworks. Notably, extensive experiments
demonstrate that SSLCounter not only demonstrates state-of-the-art performances
but also delivers competitive performance with only using 70% proportion of
training data, showcasing its superior data efficiency across multiple MVC
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个针对基础模型的对象中心空间推理基准，使用合成数据集评估了视觉模型和视觉语言模型在空间定位、空间推理和下游检索任务中的表现，发现检测器和VLM之间存在稳定的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数基准测试强调定位精度，但忽视了模型是否真正理解场景中物体的排列和关系。有效的场景理解不仅需要识别物体，还需要推理它们的相对位置、分组和深度关系。

Method: 使用受控合成数据集，评估了最先进的视觉模型（如GroundingDINO、Florence-2、OWLv2）和大型视觉语言模型（如InternVL、LLaVA、GPT-4o）在三个任务上的表现：空间定位、空间推理和下游检索任务。

Result: 发现检测器（如GroundingDINO和OWLv2）提供精确的边界框但关系推理能力有限，而VLM（如SmolVLM和GPT-4o）提供粗略的布局线索和流畅的描述但在细粒度空间上下文方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 研究强调了定位精度与真正空间理解之间的差距，指出社区需要开发具有空间感知能力的基础模型。

Abstract: Spatial understanding is a critical capability for vision foundation models.
While recent advances in large vision models or vision-language models (VLMs)
have expanded recognition capabilities, most benchmarks emphasize localization
accuracy rather than whether models capture how objects are arranged and
related within a scene. This gap is consequential; effective scene
understanding requires not only identifying objects, but reasoning about their
relative positions, groupings, and depth. In this paper, we present a
systematic benchmark for object-centric spatial reasoning in foundation models.
Using a controlled synthetic dataset, we evaluate state-of-the-art vision
models (e.g., GroundingDINO, Florence-2, OWLv2) and large VLMs (e.g., InternVL,
LLaVA, GPT-4o) across three tasks: spatial localization, spatial reasoning, and
downstream retrieval tasks. We find a stable trade-off: detectors such as
GroundingDINO and OWLv2 deliver precise boxes with limited relational
reasoning, while VLMs like SmolVLM and GPT-4o provide coarse layout cues and
fluent captions but struggle with fine-grained spatial context. Our study
highlights the gap between localization and true spatial understanding, and
pointing toward the need for spatially-aware foundation models in the
community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANICL是一个无需训练的可视化上下文学习框架，通过利用多个上下文图像对来减少对单个示例的过度依赖，从而提高预测的稳定性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可视化上下文学习(VICL)方法过度依赖单个上下文图像对，导致预测结果存在偏差且不稳定。

Method: 提出基于补丁的k近邻视觉上下文学习(PANICL)，通过平滑多个上下文对的分配分数来减少偏差，无需额外训练。

Result: 在多种视觉任务上实验表明，PANICL相比强基线方法有持续改进，并对领域偏移表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PANICL是一个通用且多功能的框架，能够很好地泛化到其他VICL模型，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to
as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide
models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from
over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and
unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual
In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates
this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment
scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training.
Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation,
single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint
detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover,
PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level
shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and
generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM,
highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SingRef6D是一个轻量级的6D姿态估计方法，仅需单张RGB参考图像，无需深度传感器、多视图采集或复杂训练。通过改进深度预测和深度感知匹配，在挑战性场景下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D姿态估计方法存在局限性：依赖深度传感器在透明/反光表面失效，RGB方法在低光/无纹理场景匹配性能不足。需要一种不依赖深度传感器且能在挑战性条件下稳健工作的解决方案。

Method: 1. 基于Depth-Anything v2提出token-scaler微调机制和新优化损失，提升挑战性表面的深度预测精度；2. 引入深度感知匹配过程，在LoFTR中整合空间关系，处理挑战性材质和光照条件的匹配。

Result: 1. 在REAL275深度预测上相比Depth-Anything v2提升14.41%；2. 在REAL275、ClearPose和Toyota-Light数据集上的姿态估计评估中，平均召回率比现有最优方法提升6.1%。

Conclusion: SingRef6D提供了一种轻量级且稳健的6D姿态估计解决方案，在资源受限和挑战性条件下表现优异，无需深度传感器或复杂训练过程。

Abstract: Recent 6D pose estimation methods demonstrate notable performance but still
face some practical limitations. For instance, many of them rely heavily on
sensor depth, which may fail with challenging surface conditions, such as
transparent or highly reflective materials. In the meantime, RGB-based
solutions provide less robust matching performance in low-light and
texture-less scenes due to the lack of geometry information. Motivated by
these, we propose SingRef6D, a lightweight pipeline requiring only a single RGB
image as a reference, eliminating the need for costly depth sensors, multi-view
image acquisition, or training view synthesis models and neural fields. This
enables SingRef6D to remain robust and capable even under resource-limited
settings where depth or dense templates are unavailable. Our framework
incorporates two key innovations. First, we propose a token-scaler-based
fine-tuning mechanism with a novel optimization loss on top of Depth-Anything
v2 to enhance its ability to predict accurate depth, even for challenging
surfaces. Our results show a 14.41% improvement (in $\delta_{1.05}$) on REAL275
depth prediction compared to Depth-Anything v2 (with fine-tuned head). Second,
benefiting from depth availability, we introduce a depth-aware matching process
that effectively integrates spatial relationships within LoFTR, enabling our
system to handle matching for challenging materials and lighting conditions.
Evaluations of pose estimation on the REAL275, ClearPose, and Toyota-Light
datasets show that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving a
6.1% improvement in average recall.

Motivation: 现有基础模型（特别是transformer解码器）存在高计算开销和缺乏可解释性的问题，限制了在资源受限场景中的部署。

Method: 采用可训练的硬特征选择器进行稀疏操作，并将特征选择集成到早期退出机制中，使用贝叶斯优化确定最优退出阈值。

Result: 相比ViNT，DynaNav实现了FLOPs减少2.26倍，推理时间降低42.3%，内存使用降低32.8%，同时在四个公共数据集上提高了导航性能。

Conclusion: DynaNav在保持导航性能的同时显著降低了计算成本，为资源受限环境中的视觉导航提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Visual navigation is essential for robotics and embodied AI. However,
existing foundation models, particularly those with transformer decoders,
suffer from high computational overhead and lack interpretability, limiting
their deployment in resource-tight scenarios. To address this, we propose
DynaNav, a Dynamic Visual Navigation framework that adapts feature and layer
selection based on scene complexity. It employs a trainable hard feature
selector for sparse operations, enhancing efficiency and interpretability.
Additionally, we integrate feature selection into an early-exit mechanism, with
Bayesian Optimization determining optimal exit thresholds to reduce
computational cost. Extensive experiments in real-world-based datasets and
simulated environments demonstrate the effectiveness of DynaNav. Compared to
ViNT, DynaNav achieves a 2.26x reduction in FLOPs, 42.3% lower inference time,
and 32.8% lower memory usage, while improving navigation performance across

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SemanticControl方法，解决ControlNet在视觉条件与文本提示不匹配时的生成问题，通过自适应抑制冲突区域的视觉条件影响，增强文本引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ControlNet依赖与生成目标精确对齐的视觉条件，但在实际应用中，特别是对于不常见或想象场景，往往缺乏合适的视觉条件。现有方法难以利用语义相关但不完全对齐的视觉条件。

Method: 提出训练无关的SemanticControl方法：首先使用与视觉条件对齐的替代提示进行辅助去噪，提取注意力掩码；然后在目标提示去噪过程中利用这些掩码自适应调节视觉条件的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在深度图、边缘图和人体骨架等各种松散对齐条件下都能提升性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SemanticControl能够有效利用语义相关但不完全对齐的视觉条件，在保持文本忠实度的同时减少视觉伪影，扩展了ControlNet的应用范围。

Abstract: ControlNet has enabled detailed spatial control in text-to-image diffusion
models by incorporating additional visual conditions such as depth or edge
maps. However, its effectiveness heavily depends on the availability of visual
conditions that are precisely aligned with the generation goal specified by
text prompt-a requirement that often fails in practice, especially for uncommon
or imaginative scenes. For example, generating an image of a cat cooking in a
specific pose may be infeasible due to the lack of suitable visual conditions.
In contrast, structurally similar cues can often be found in more common
settings-for instance, poses of humans cooking are widely available and can
serve as rough visual guides. Unfortunately, existing ControlNet models
struggle to use such loosely aligned visual conditions, often resulting in low
text fidelity or visual artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose
SemanticControl, a training-free method for effectively leveraging misaligned
but semantically relevant visual conditions. Our approach adaptively suppresses
the influence of the visual condition where it conflicts with the prompt, while
strengthening guidance from the text. The key idea is to first run an auxiliary
denoising process using a surrogate prompt aligned with the visual condition
(e.g., "a human playing guitar" for a human pose condition) to extract
informative attention masks, and then utilize these masks during the denoising
of the actual target prompt (e.g., cat playing guitar). Experimental results
demonstrate that our method improves performance under loosely aligned
conditions across various conditions, including depth maps, edge maps, and
human skeletons, outperforming existing baselines. Our code is available at

Method: 设计了情感陈述判断任务，并开发了一个自动化流水线来高效构建情感相关陈述，最小化人工干预。

Result: 评估显示MLLMs在情感解释和基于上下文的情感判断方面表现较强，但在理解感知主观性方面相对有限。与人类相比，即使是GPT4o等顶级模型也存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: 该研究为MLLMs的情感智能评估提供了基础框架，揭示了未来改进的关键方向，有助于推动MLLMs情感智能的发展。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved exceptional
performance across diverse tasks, continually surpassing previous expectations
regarding their capabilities. Nevertheless, their proficiency in perceiving
emotions from images remains debated, with studies yielding divergent results
in zero-shot scenarios. We argue that this inconsistency stems partly from
constraints in existing evaluation methods, including the oversight of
plausible responses, limited emotional taxonomies, neglect of contextual
factors, and labor-intensive annotations. To facilitate customized visual
emotion evaluation for MLLMs, we propose an Emotion Statement Judgment task
that overcomes these constraints. Complementing this task, we devise an
automated pipeline that efficiently constructs emotion-centric statements with
minimal human effort. Through systematically evaluating prevailing MLLMs, our
study showcases their stronger performance in emotion interpretation and
context-based emotion judgment, while revealing relative limitations in
comprehending perception subjectivity. When compared to humans, even
top-performing MLLMs like GPT4o demonstrate remarkable performance gaps,
underscoring key areas for future improvement. By developing a fundamental
evaluation framework and conducting a comprehensive MLLM assessment, we hope
this work contributes to advancing emotional intelligence in MLLMs. Project

Result: 实验验证该框架显著提高了主体保真度，并更好地对齐了人类偏好。

Conclusion: MultiCrafter通过位置监督、MoE架构和强化学习有效解决了多主体图像生成中的属性泄漏和偏好对齐问题。

Abstract: Multi-subject image generation aims to synthesize user-provided subjects in a
single image while preserving subject fidelity, ensuring prompt consistency,
and aligning with human aesthetic preferences. However, existing methods,
particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by
their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both
severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align
with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a
framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we
find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of
attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore,
we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention
regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable
the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in
diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the
model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios.
Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the
model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately
assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for
the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly
improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放世界部件分割方法通常从2D基础模型（如SAM）迁移监督，通过多视角掩码提升到3D，但这种间接范式无法捕捉内在几何特征，导致表面理解、不可控分解和有限泛化能力。

Method: 采用类似SAM的编码器-解码器架构，使用基于三平面的双分支编码器生成空间结构化token，实现可扩展的部件感知表示学习；引入模型辅助标注流程从在线资源中整理大规模3D形状-部件对数据。

Result: PartSAM在单一提示下实现高精度部件识别，在Segment-Every-Part模式下自动将形状分解为表面和内部结构；在多个基准测试中大幅超越最先进方法。

Conclusion: PartSAM标志着向3D部件理解基础模型的决定性一步，结合可扩展架构和多样化3D数据，实现了新兴的开放世界能力。

Abstract: Segmenting 3D objects into parts is a long-standing challenge in computer
vision. To overcome taxonomy constraints and generalize to unseen 3D objects,
recent works turn to open-world part segmentation. These approaches typically
transfer supervision from 2D foundation models, such as SAM, by lifting
multi-view masks into 3D. However, this indirect paradigm fails to capture
intrinsic geometry, leading to surface-only understanding, uncontrolled
decomposition, and limited generalization. We present PartSAM, the first
promptable part segmentation model trained natively on large-scale 3D data.
Following the design philosophy of SAM, PartSAM employs an encoder-decoder
architecture in which a triplane-based dual-branch encoder produces spatially
structured tokens for scalable part-aware representation learning. To enable
large-scale supervision, we further introduce a model-in-the-loop annotation
pipeline that curates over five million 3D shape-part pairs from online assets,
providing diverse and fine-grained labels. This combination of scalable
architecture and diverse 3D data yields emergent open-world capabilities: with
a single prompt, PartSAM achieves highly accurate part identification, and in a
Segment-Every-Part mode, it automatically decomposes shapes into both surface
and internal structures. Extensive experiments show that PartSAM outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins across multiple benchmarks, marking a
decisive step toward foundation models for 3D part understanding. Our code and
model will be released soon.

Result: 定制化的EfficientNet B0模型在CCID2014上达到PLCC=0.9286和SRCC=0.9178，在CID2013上达到PLCC=0.9581和SRCC=0.9369，超越了传统方法和其他深度基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了对比度感知的轻量级预训练网络适配可以提供高性能、可扩展的无参考对比度质量评估解决方案，适用于实时和资源受限的应用。

Abstract: Image contrast was a fundamental factor in visual perception and played a
vital role in overall image quality. However, most no reference image quality
assessment NR IQA models struggled to accurately evaluate contrast distortions
under diverse real world conditions. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
based framework for blind contrast quality assessment by customizing and
fine-tuning three pre trained architectures, EfficientNet B0, ResNet18, and
MobileNetV2, for perceptual Mean Opinion Score, along with an additional model
built on a Siamese network, which indicated a limited ability to capture
perceptual contrast distortions. Each model is modified with a contrast-aware
regression head and trained end to end using targeted data augmentations on two
benchmark datasets, CID2013 and CCID2014, containing synthetic and authentic
contrast distortions. Performance is evaluated using Pearson Linear Correlation
Coefficient and Spearman Rank Order Correlation Coefficient, which assess the
alignment between predicted and human rated scores. Among these three models,
our customized EfficientNet B0 model achieved state-of-the-art performance with
PLCC = 0.9286 and SRCC = 0.9178 on CCID2014 and PLCC = 0.9581 and SRCC = 0.9369
on CID2013, surpassing traditional methods and outperforming other deep
baselines. These results highlighted the models robustness and effectiveness in
capturing perceptual contrast distortion. Overall, the proposed method
demonstrated that contrast aware adaptation of lightweight pre trained networks
can yield a high performing, scalable solution for no reference contrast
quality assessment suitable for real time and resource constrained
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像中少样本场景下指代表达理解的泛化能力不足问题，传统监督微调方法在数据稀缺时表现不佳。

Method: 采用推理中心强化微调(RFT)范式，强制模型先生成显式推理链分解指代表达，再利用推理结果定位目标，实现"先推理后行动"的过程。

Result: 在三个精心设计的少样本地理空间指代表达基准测试中，Geo-R1模型持续显著优于监督微调基线，并表现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Geo-R1通过推理链生成有效提升了少样本场景下的模型泛化能力，同时提供了可解释性，在遥感指代表达理解任务中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Referring expression understanding in remote sensing poses unique challenges,
as it requires reasoning over complex object-context relationships. While
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on multimodal large language models achieves
strong performance with massive labeled datasets, they struggle in data-scarce
scenarios, leading to poor generalization. To address this limitation, we
propose Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) paradigm
for few-shot geospatial referring. Geo-R1 enforces the model to first generate
explicit, interpretable reasoning chains that decompose referring expressions,
and then leverage these rationales to localize target objects. This "reason
first, then act" process enables the model to make more effective use of
limited annotations, enhances generalization, and provides interpretability. We
validate Geo-R1 on three carefully designed few-shot geospatial referring
benchmarks, where our model consistently and substantially outperforms SFT
baselines. It also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
highlighting its robustness. Code and data will be released at

TL;DR: 该研究评估了视觉语言模型在医疗视觉问答中的临床谄媚行为，提出了一个医疗谄媚基准数据集和名为VIPER的轻量级缓解策略，通过过滤非证据内容来减少谄媚行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型越来越多地集成到临床工作流程中，但它们经常表现出谄媚行为，优先考虑与用户措辞、社交线索或感知权威的一致性，而不是基于证据的推理。

Method: 从PathVQA、SLAKE和VQA-RAD构建医疗谄媚数据集，使用心理学动机的压力模板进行对抗性实验，并提出了VIPER框架来过滤非证据内容并生成基于证据的回答。

Result: 发现各种视觉语言模型普遍易受攻击，表现出显著的对抗性响应变化，与模型准确性或大小的相关性较弱。模仿和专家提供的纠正是最有效的触发因素。VIPER框架平均减少了谄媚行为，优于基线方法，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: 该研究的基准分析和缓解框架为在真实世界临床医生交互中稳健部署医疗视觉语言模型奠定了基础，强调了基于证据的防御的必要性。

Abstract: Vision language models(VLMs) are increasingly integrated into clinical
workflows, but they often exhibit sycophantic behavior prioritizing alignment
with user phrasing social cues or perceived authority over evidence based
reasoning. This study evaluate clinical sycophancy in medical visual question
answering through a novel clinically grounded benchmark. We propose a medical
sycophancy dataset construct from PathVQA, SLAKE, and VQA-RAD stratified by
different type organ system and modality. Using psychologically motivated
pressure templates including various sycophancy. In our adversarial experiments
on various VLMs, we found that these models are generally vulnerable,
exhibiting significant variations in the occurrence of adversarial responses,
with weak correlations to the model accuracy or size. Imitation and expert
provided corrections were found to be the most effective triggers, suggesting
that the models possess a bias mechanism independent of visual evidence. To
address this, we propose Visual Information Purification for Evidence based
Response (VIPER) a lightweight mitigation strategy that filters non evidentiary
content for example social pressures and then generates constrained evidence
first answers. This framework reduces sycophancy by an average amount
outperforming baselines while maintaining interpretability. Our benchmark
analysis and mitigation framework lay the groundwork for robust deployment of
medical VLMs in real world clinician interactions emphasizing the need for
evidence anchored defenses.

TL;DR: GLARIFY是一种利用时空注视信息增强视觉语言模型在现实应用中效果的新方法，通过处理模糊的注视模式和复杂时空关系来改进智能眼镜中的多模态查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能眼镜的普及，用户注视数据被整合到视觉语言模型中，但注视数据存在模糊性挑战：用户口头问题使用代词或省略上下文变得模糊，人类注视模式嘈杂且与口语问题呈现复杂时空关系。

Method: 首先分析注视模态的查询样本，展示用户注视模式的嘈杂性；然后使用GPT-4o设计自动数据合成管道生成GLARIFY-Ambi数据集，包含专门的思维链过程处理嘈杂注视模式；最后设计热图模块将注视信息整合到前沿VLMs中，同时保留预训练知识。

Result: 在保留测试集上的实验表明，GLARIFY显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过稳健地将视觉语言模型与人类注意力对齐，GLARIFY为与视觉助手的可用和直观交互范式铺平了道路。

Abstract: With the rise in popularity of smart glasses, users' attention has been
integrated into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to streamline multi-modal
querying in daily scenarios. However, leveraging gaze data to model users'
attention may introduce ambiguity challenges: (1) users' verbal questions
become ambiguous by using pronouns or skipping context, (2) humans' gaze
patterns can be noisy and exhibit complex spatiotemporal relationships with
their spoken questions. Previous works only consider single image as visual
modality input, failing to capture the dynamic nature of the user's attention.
In this work, we introduce GLARIFY, a novel method to leverage spatiotemporal
gaze information to enhance the model's effectiveness in real-world
applications. Initially, we analyzed hundreds of querying samples with the gaze
modality to demonstrate the noisy nature of users' gaze patterns. We then
utilized GPT-4o to design an automatic data synthesis pipeline to generate the
GLARIFY-Ambi dataset, which includes a dedicated chain-of-thought (CoT) process
to handle noisy gaze patterns. Finally, we designed a heatmap module to
incorporate gaze information into cutting-edge VLMs while preserving their
pretrained knowledge. We evaluated GLARIFY using a hold-out test set.
Experiments demonstrate that GLARIFY significantly outperforms baselines. By
robustly aligning VLMs with human attention, GLARIFY paves the way for a usable
and intuitive interaction paradigm with a visual assistant.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型视觉语言模型存在空间偏差问题，当相同视觉信息出现在图像不同位置时会产生不一致输出。问题源于语言模型中位置嵌入的不平衡设计，作者提出平衡位置分配方法来解决此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务上表现优异，但其对空间变化的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。作者旨在系统性地探究LVLMs的空间偏差问题。

Method: 通过精心设计的探测数据集分析模型空间偏差，发现视觉编码器本身没有此问题，问题源于语言模型中的位置嵌入策略。提出平衡位置分配方法，为所有图像标记分配相同位置嵌入。

Result: 实验表明BaPA方法无需重新训练即可增强LVLMs的空间鲁棒性，结合轻量级微调还能进一步提升在多种多模态基准测试上的性能。信息流分析显示BaPA能产生更平衡的注意力机制。

Conclusion: LVLMs存在显著的空间偏差问题，主要源于位置嵌入的不平衡设计。BaPA方法能有效缓解此问题，促进更平衡的视觉信息整合和更全面的视觉理解。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable success across
a wide range of multimodal tasks, yet their robustness to spatial variations
remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a systematic study
of the spatial bias of LVLMs, focusing on how models respond when identical key
visual information is placed at different locations within an image. Through a
carefully designed probing dataset, we demonstrate that current LVLMs often
produce inconsistent outputs under such spatial shifts, revealing a fundamental
limitation in their spatial-semantic understanding. Further analysis shows that
this phenomenon originates not from the vision encoder, which reliably
perceives and interprets visual content across positions, but from the
unbalanced design of position embeddings in the language model component. In
particular, the widely adopted position embedding strategies, such as RoPE,
introduce imbalance during cross-modal interaction, leading image tokens at
different positions to exert unequal influence on semantic understanding. To
mitigate this issue, we introduce Balanced Position Assignment (BaPA), a simple
yet effective mechanism that assigns identical position embeddings to all image
tokens, promoting a more balanced integration of visual information. Extensive
experiments show that BaPA enhances the spatial robustness of LVLMs without
retraining and further boosts their performance across diverse multimodal
benchmarks when combined with lightweight fine-tuning. Further analysis of
information flow reveals that BaPA yields balanced attention, enabling more
holistic visual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型主干网络包含丰富的语义特征，但也必须包含支持图像合成能力的视觉特征。然而由于缺乏标注数据集，分离这些视觉特征具有挑战性。

Method: 引入自动化流程构建具有标注语义和视觉对应的图像对，设计对比架构分离两种特征类型，利用解耦表示提出VSM指标。

Result: 实证结果显示该方法在量化视觉不一致性方面优于CLIP、DINO等全局特征指标，同时支持不一致区域的空间定位。

Conclusion: 这是首个同时支持主题驱动生成中不一致性量化和定位的方法，为该任务的进展提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features
from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual
correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic
correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode
semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support
their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is
challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we
introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated
semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image
generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two
feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new
metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies
in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach
outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and
vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also
enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this
is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of
inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for
advancing this task. Project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型的嵌入在动态模态（如音频和视频）上的应用仍未被充分探索，需要创建统一的多模态表示空间。

Method: 采用分层特征融合策略和联合多模态、多任务训练方法，支持任意到任意的跨模态检索和提示感知嵌入生成。

Result: 在MMEB-v2视频基准测试中达到新SOTA，音频和视频到音频检索表现优异，多模态问答性能显著优于现有嵌入模型。

Conclusion: WAVE为跨模态任意到任意应用开辟了广阔可能性，验证了联合训练策略的有效性。

Abstract: While embeddings from multimodal large language models (LLMs) excel as
general-purpose representations, their application to dynamic modalities like
audio and video remains underexplored. We introduce WAVE (\textbf{u}nified \&
\textbf{v}ersatile \textbf{a}udio-\textbf{v}isual \textbf{e}mbeddings), the
first LLM-based embedding that creates a unified representation space for text,
audio, and video modalities. WAVE employs a novel hierarchical feature fusion
strategy and a joint multi-modal, multi-task training approach to enable two
key capabilities: any-to-any cross-modal retrieval and the generation of
prompt-aware embeddings tailored to user instructions. Experimentally, WAVE
sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB-v2 video benchmark and achieves
superior results in audio and video-to-audio retrieval. Its prompt-aware nature
also yields remarkable performance in multimodal question answering,
significantly outperforming existing embedding models. Ablation studies
validate our joint training strategy, demonstrating improved performance across
all modalities. With a newly introduced benchmark for versatile audio-visual
learning, WAVE opens up broad possibilities for cross-modal, any-to-any
applications. Our code, checkpoints, and data will be released.

TL;DR: ERGO提出了一种从粗到细的视觉推理方法，通过先分析下采样图像识别任务相关区域，然后仅对相关区域进行全分辨率处理，在保持准确性的同时大幅减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时会产生大量视觉标记，导致计算开销过大。随着"图像思维"模型的出现，推理能力扩展到视觉领域，这启发了从粗到细的推理流程设计。

Method: 采用两阶段推理流程：第一阶段分析下采样图像识别任务相关区域；第二阶段仅对相关区域进行全分辨率处理。使用强化学习框架开发奖励组件，实现推理驱动的感知，能够考虑感知不确定性并扩展裁剪区域覆盖视觉模糊区域。

Result: 在多个数据集上，ERGO比原始模型和竞争方法获得更高准确率，同时效率更高。例如在V*基准测试中超越Qwen2.5-VL-7B 4.7分，仅使用23%的视觉标记，实现3倍推理加速。

Conclusion: ERGO通过推理驱动的感知方法，在保持视觉细节的同时显著降低计算成本，为高效处理高分辨率图像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient processing of high-resolution images is crucial for real-world
vision-language applications. However, existing Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) incur substantial computational overhead due to the large number of
vision tokens. With the advent of "thinking with images" models, reasoning now
extends beyond text to the visual domain. This capability motivates our
two-stage "coarse-to-fine" reasoning pipeline: first, a downsampled image is
analyzed to identify task-relevant regions; then, only these regions are
cropped at full resolution and processed in a subsequent reasoning stage. This
approach reduces computational cost while preserving fine-grained visual
details where necessary. A major challenge lies in inferring which regions are
truly relevant to a given query. Recent related methods often fail in the first
stage after input-image downsampling, due to perception-driven reasoning, where
clear visual information is required for effective reasoning. To address this
issue, we propose ERGO (Efficient Reasoning & Guided Observation) that performs
reasoning-driven perception-leveraging multimodal context to determine where to
focus. Our model can account for perceptual uncertainty, expanding the cropped
region to cover visually ambiguous areas for answering questions. To this end,
we develop simple yet effective reward components in a reinforcement learning
framework for coarse-to-fine perception. Across multiple datasets, our approach
delivers higher accuracy than the original model and competitive methods, with
greater efficiency. For instance, ERGO surpasses Qwen2.5-VL-7B on the V*
benchmark by 4.7 points while using only 23% of the vision tokens, achieving a
3x inference speedup. The code and models can be found at:

TL;DR: DualFocus是一个新颖的深度聚焦框架，通过联合建模空间和焦距维度的焦点变化，利用焦点堆栈中的梯度模式来提高深度估计的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于学习的深度聚焦方法在复杂场景中表现不佳，特别是在具有精细纹理或深度突变的情况下，焦点线索可能变得模糊或误导。

Method: 引入变分公式，包含针对深度聚焦的双重约束：空间约束利用不同焦距级别的梯度模式变化来区分真实深度边缘和纹理伪影，焦距约束强制执行与物理焦点行为一致的单峰单调焦点概率。

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的综合实验表明，DualFocus在深度准确性和感知质量方面始终优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: DualFocus通过结合空间和焦距约束的归纳偏置，在具有挑战性的区域提高了深度估计的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Depth-from-Focus (DFF) enables precise depth estimation by analyzing focus
cues across a stack of images captured at varying focal lengths. While recent
learning-based approaches have advanced this field, they often struggle in
complex scenes with fine textures or abrupt depth changes, where focus cues may
become ambiguous or misleading. We present DualFocus, a novel DFF framework
that leverages the focal stack's unique gradient patterns induced by focus
variation, jointly modeling focus changes over spatial and focal dimensions.
Our approach introduces a variational formulation with dual constraints
tailored to DFF: spatial constraints exploit gradient pattern changes across
focus levels to distinguish true depth edges from texture artifacts, while
focal constraints enforce unimodal, monotonic focus probabilities aligned with
physical focus behavior. These inductive biases improve robustness and accuracy
in challenging regions. Comprehensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that DualFocus consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both depth accuracy and perceptual quality.

Method: 1）提出多智能体协作的实用率失真理论；2）任务熵离散编码：根据任务相关性分配码字长度；3）互信息驱动消息选择：使用互信息神经估计实现无冗余传输。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和OPV2V数据集上，RDcomm在3D目标检测和BEV分割任务中达到最先进精度，同时通信量减少高达108倍。

Conclusion: 基于信息论的实用率失真理论为协作感知提供了理论指导，RDcomm框架验证了提供实用相关信息和传输无冗余消息是实现高效通信的关键条件。

Abstract: Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by
enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth
resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task
performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the
theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and
introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration,
specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in
goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions
for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically
relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these
two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative
perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy
discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to
maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii)
mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information
neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition.
Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing
communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.

Motivation: 静态基准测试在诊断文本到图像模型的系统性失败方面能力有限，需要一种主动探索范式来全面映射失败景观并定位根本原因。

Method: 将错误发现构建为对最小失败诱导概念的结构化搜索问题，采用新颖的加速技术解决计算爆炸问题，实现大规模失败模式探索。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion模型中发现超过247,000个先前未知的错误切片，首次提供大规模证据表明这些失败与训练数据稀缺相关。

Conclusion: FailureAtlas建立了一种诊断优先的新方法论，为开发更鲁棒的生成式AI提供了原则性和可扩展的深度模型审计引擎。

Abstract: Static benchmarks have provided a valuable foundation for comparing
Text-to-Image (T2I) models. However, their passive design offers limited
diagnostic power, struggling to uncover the full landscape of systematic
failures or isolate their root causes. We argue for a complementary paradigm:
active exploration. We introduce FailureAtlas, the first framework designed to
autonomously explore and map the vast failure landscape of T2I models at scale.
FailureAtlas frames error discovery as a structured search for minimal,
failure-inducing concepts. While it is a computationally explosive problem, we
make it tractable with novel acceleration techniques. When applied to Stable
Diffusion models, our method uncovers hundreds of thousands of previously
unknown error slices (over 247,000 in SD1.5 alone) and provides the first
large-scale evidence linking these failures to data scarcity in the training
set. By providing a principled and scalable engine for deep model auditing,
FailureAtlas establishes a new, diagnostic-first methodology to guide the
development of more robust generative AI. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的自监督幻觉缓解方法，通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间来放大幻觉信号，使用正负锚点编辑解码器隐藏状态，有效减少多模态大语言模型中的幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但对幻觉高度敏感，即使更大模型也存在对象、属性和关系层面的幻觉。现有方法通常需要额外微调、手工先验，或在有效性和可扩展性之间权衡。

Method: 引入幻觉放大机制：通过文本到图像模型将描述投影到视觉空间作为负锚点，原始图像作为正锚点。利用这两个锚点，通过拉近忠实语义表示和推离幻觉方向来编辑解码器隐藏状态。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著减少了对象、属性和关系层面的幻觉，同时保持召回率和描述丰富度。例如，在CHAIR上使用LLaVA-v1.5-7B实现超过5%的幻觉减少。在LLaVA-NEXT-7B、Cambrian-8B和InstructBLIP-7B等不同架构上验证了强跨架构泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工先验或额外训练成本，对无幻觉描述几乎不产生副作用，具有鲁棒性和即插即用的实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet they remain highly susceptible to
hallucinations, producing content that is fluent but inconsistent with visual
evidence. Such hallucinations, spanning objects, attributes, and relations,
persist even in larger models, while existing mitigation approaches often
require additional finetuning, handcrafted priors, or trade-offs that
compromise informativeness and scalability. To address this limitation, we
propose a training-free, self-supervised method for hallucination mitigation.
Our approach introduces a novel hallucination amplification mechanism: a
caption is projected into the visual space via a text-to-image model to reveal
implicit hallucination signals, serving as a negative anchor, while the
original image provides a positive anchor. Leveraging these dual anchors, we
edit decoder hidden states by pulling representations toward faithful semantics
and pushing them away from hallucination directions. This correction requires
no human priors or additional training costs, ensuring both effectiveness and
efficiency. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that our
method significantly reduces hallucinations at the object, attribute, and
relation levels while largely preserving recall and caption richness, e.g.,
achieving a hallucination reduction by over 5% using LLaVA-v1.5-7B on CHAIR.
Furthermore, results on diverse architectures, including LLaVA-NEXT-7B,
Cambrian-8B, and InstructBLIP-7B, validate strong cross-architecture
generalization. More importantly, when applied to hallucination-free captions,
our method introduces almost no side effects, underscoring its robustness and
practical plug-and-play applicability. The implementation will be publicly
available.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在处理复杂冗余的视觉输入时容易受到干扰，产生无关推理过程甚至幻觉，主要原因是无法在推理过程中精确发现和处理所需区域。

Method: 提出Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT)方法，包含三个迭代阶段：1) 多样样本生成：探索潜在推理路径；2) 双重前瞻解码：基于视觉焦点和推理进展评估样本；3) 视觉焦点调整：精确调整视觉焦点到对未来推理最有益的区域。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL、InternVL-2.5和Llava-Next等多个模型上的实验结果显示，CoFFT方法带来了3.1-5.8%的稳定性能提升，且计算开销可控增加。

Conclusion: CoFFT通过模拟人类视觉认知的迭代推理过程，有效提升了视觉语言模型的视觉推理能力，解决了复杂视觉输入下的干扰问题。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs), they remain
constrained by the complexity and redundancy of visual input. When images
contain large amounts of irrelevant information, VLMs are susceptible to
interference, thus generating excessive task-irrelevant reasoning processes or
even hallucinations. This limitation stems from their inability to discover and
process the required regions during reasoning precisely. To address this
limitation, we present the Chain of Foresight-Focus Thought (CoFFT), a novel
training-free approach that enhances VLMs' visual reasoning by emulating human
visual cognition. Each Foresight-Focus Thought consists of three stages: (1)
Diverse Sample Generation: generates diverse reasoning samples to explore
potential reasoning paths, where each sample contains several reasoning steps;
(2) Dual Foresight Decoding: rigorously evaluates these samples based on both
visual focus and reasoning progression, adding the first step of optimal sample
to the reasoning process; (3) Visual Focus Adjustment: precisely adjust visual
focus toward regions most beneficial for future reasoning, before returning to
stage (1) to generate subsequent reasoning samples until reaching the final
answer. These stages function iteratively, creating an interdependent cycle
where reasoning guides visual focus and visual focus informs subsequent
reasoning. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks using Qwen2.5-VL,
InternVL-2.5, and Llava-Next demonstrate consistent performance improvements of
3.1-5.8\% with controllable increasing computational overhead.

Abstract: Healthcare robotics requires robust multimodal perception and reasoning to
ensure safety in dynamic clinical environments. Current Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) demonstrate strong general-purpose capabilities but remain limited in
temporal reasoning, uncertainty estimation, and structured outputs needed for
robotic planning. We present a lightweight agentic multimodal framework for
video-based scene understanding. Combining the Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct model
with a SmolAgent-based orchestration layer, it supports chain-of-thought
reasoning, speech-vision fusion, and dynamic tool invocation. The framework
generates structured scene graphs and leverages a hybrid retrieval module for
interpretable and adaptive reasoning. Evaluations on the Video-MME benchmark
and a custom clinical dataset show competitive accuracy and improved robustness
compared to state-of-the-art VLMs, demonstrating its potential for applications
in robot-assisted surgery, patient monitoring, and decision support.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对面教学场景在计算机视觉领域尚未得到系统研究，主要原因是缺乏合适的数据集和有限的分析技术。

Method: 构建了新的第一人称视角面对面教学视频数据集，提供程序步骤分割和对话状态分类的标注，并对比了多模态大语言模型与传统任务特定模型的性能。

Result: 实验表明，多模态大语言模型即使未经任务特定微调，也能超越专门的基线模型，显示出其在理解教学互动方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型有望实现对教学互动的整体理解，为教育支持和技能转移提供新的分析工具。

Abstract: Analyzing instructional interactions between an instructor and a learner who
are co-present in the same physical space is a critical problem for educational
support and skill transfer. Yet such face-to-face instructional scenes have not
been systematically studied in computer vision. We identify two key reasons: i)
the lack of suitable datasets and ii) limited analytical techniques. To address
this gap, we present a new egocentric video dataset of face-to-face instruction
and provide ground-truth annotations for two fundamental tasks that serve as a
first step toward a comprehensive understanding of instructional interactions:
procedural step segmentation and conversation-state classification. Using this
dataset, we benchmark multimodal large language models (MLLMs) against
conventional task-specific models. Since face-to-face instruction involves
multiple modalities (speech content and prosody, gaze and body motion, and
visual context), effective understanding requires methods that handle verbal
and nonverbal communication in an integrated manner. Accordingly, we evaluate
recently introduced MLLMs that jointly process images, audio, and text. This
evaluation quantifies the extent to which current machine learning models
understand face-to-face instructional scenes. In experiments, MLLMs outperform
specialized baselines even without task-specific fine-tuning, suggesting their
promise for holistic understanding of instructional interactions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAVIS是一个基于扩散模型的音频-视觉分离框架，通过生成式学习解决音视频源分离任务，使用DDPM和Flow Matching方法直接合成分离后的声音频谱图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将声音分离视为基于掩码的回归问题，但在捕捉复杂数据分布以高质量分离不同类别声音方面存在局限。

Method: 利用DDPM和Flow Matching生成建模范式，在专门的Separation U-Net架构中，从噪声分布直接合成目标分离声音频谱图，同时以混合音频输入和相关视觉信息为条件。

Result: 在AVE和MUSIC数据集上的评估表明，DAVIS的两个变体在分离质量上都超过了现有方法。

Conclusion: 生成式框架在解决音频-视觉源分离任务方面具有高效性，能够为不同声音类别产生高质量的分离结果。

Abstract: We propose DAVIS, a Diffusion-based Audio-VIsual Separation framework that
solves the audio-visual sound source separation task through generative
learning. Existing methods typically frame sound separation as a mask-based
regression problem, achieving significant progress. However, they face
limitations in capturing the complex data distribution required for
high-quality separation of sounds from diverse categories. In contrast, DAVIS
circumvents these issues by leveraging potent generative modeling paradigms,
specifically Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) and the more
recent Flow Matching (FM), integrated within a specialized Separation U-Net
architecture. Our framework operates by synthesizing the desired separated
sound spectrograms directly from a noise distribution, conditioned concurrently
on the mixed audio input and associated visual information. The inherent nature
of its generative objective makes DAVIS particularly adept at producing
high-quality sound separations for diverse sound categories. We present
comparative evaluations of DAVIS, encompassing both its DDPM and Flow Matching
variants, against leading methods on the standard AVE and MUSIC datasets. The
results affirm that both variants surpass existing approaches in separation
quality, highlighting the efficacy of our generative framework for tackling the
audio-visual source separation task.

TL;DR: 提出SpecXNet双域架构，通过空间和频域特征融合实现鲁棒的深度伪造检测，在跨数据集和未知篡改场景下达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN和扩散模型生成的内容越来越逼真，现有方法仅关注空间或频域特征，限制了其对未见篡改的泛化能力。

Method: 使用双域特征耦合器(DDFC)分解特征为局部空间分支和全局频谱分支，引入双傅里叶注意力(DFA)模块动态融合空间和频谱特征，基于改进的XceptionNet骨干网络构建。

Result: 在多个深度伪造基准测试中达到最先进准确率，特别是在跨数据集和未知篡改场景下表现优异，同时保持实时可行性。

Conclusion: 统一的空间-频谱学习方法对鲁棒和可泛化的深度伪造检测非常有效。

Abstract: The increasing realism of content generated by GANs and diffusion models has
made deepfake detection significantly more challenging. Existing approaches
often focus solely on spatial or frequency-domain features, limiting their
generalization to unseen manipulations. We propose the Spectral
Cross-Attentional Network (SpecXNet), a dual-domain architecture for robust
deepfake detection. The core \textbf{Dual-Domain Feature Coupler (DDFC)}
decomposes features into a local spatial branch for capturing texture-level
anomalies and a global spectral branch that employs Fast Fourier Transform to
model periodic inconsistencies. This dual-domain formulation allows SpecXNet to
jointly exploit localized detail and global structural coherence, which are
critical for distinguishing authentic from manipulated images. We also
introduce the \textbf{Dual Fourier Attention (DFA)} module, which dynamically
fuses spatial and spectral features in a content-aware manner. Built atop a
modified XceptionNet backbone, we embed the DDFC and DFA modules within a
separable convolution block. Extensive experiments on multiple deepfake
benchmarks show that SpecXNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, particularly
under cross-dataset and unseen manipulation scenarios, while maintaining
real-time feasibility. Our results highlight the effectiveness of unified
spatial-spectral learning for robust and generalizable deepfake detection. To
ensure reproducibility, we released the full code on

TL;DR: 提出了Large Material Gaussian Model (MGM)，一个能够生成带有PBR材质属性的高质量3D内容的新框架，解决了现有模型无法生成材质属性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模重建模型虽然能够实现高质量的3D渲染，但无法生成资产的材质属性，这在多样光照环境下的真实渲染中至关重要。

Method: 首先微调一个新的多视角材质扩散模型，基于输入的深度和法线图生成多视角PBR图像；然后探索一种高斯材质表示，不仅与2D高斯泼溅对齐，还建模PBR材质的每个通道；最后通过渲染重建的点云获取PBR属性。

Conclusion: MGM框架成功生成了带有PBR材质的高质量3D内容，支持动态重光照，为3D内容创建提供了更完整的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing demand for 3D assets across various industries necessitates
efficient and automated methods for 3D content creation. Leveraging 3D Gaussian
Splatting, recent large reconstruction models (LRMs) have demonstrated the
ability to efficiently achieve high-quality 3D rendering by integrating
multiview diffusion for generation and scalable transformers for
reconstruction. However, existing models fail to produce the material
properties of assets, which is crucial for realistic rendering in diverse
lighting environments. In this paper, we introduce the Large Material Gaussian
Model (MGM), a novel framework designed to generate high-quality 3D content
with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials, ie, albedo, roughness, and
metallic properties, rather than merely producing RGB textures with
uncontrolled light baking. Specifically, we first fine-tune a new multiview
material diffusion model conditioned on input depth and normal maps. Utilizing
the generated multiview PBR images, we explore a Gaussian material
representation that not only aligns with 2D Gaussian Splatting but also models
each channel of the PBR materials. The reconstructed point clouds can then be
rendered to acquire PBR attributes, enabling dynamic relighting by applying
various ambient light maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
materials produced by our method not only exhibit greater visual appeal
compared to baseline methods but also enhance material modeling, thereby
enabling practical downstream rendering applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：监督方法依赖真实标注，泛化能力受限；无监督方法需要完整点云；弱监督方法需要多视角观测；现有自监督方法因自监督信号能力有限而预测效果不佳。

Method: 基于单点云的多视图增强设计新型自监督信号，首次将Mamba架构引入自监督点云补全任务以增强模型学习能力。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督点云补全方法克服了现有方法的局限性，通过多视图增强和Mamba架构实现了更好的补全效果。

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to reconstruct complete shapes from partial
observations. Although current methods have achieved remarkable performance,
they still have some limitations: Supervised methods heavily rely on ground
truth, which limits their generalization to real-world datasets due to the
synthetic-to-real domain gap. Unsupervised methods require complete point
clouds to compose unpaired training data, and weakly-supervised methods need
multi-view observations of the object. Existing self-supervised methods
frequently produce unsatisfactory predictions due to the limited capabilities
of their self-supervised signals. To overcome these challenges, we propose a
novel self-supervised point cloud completion method. We design a set of novel
self-supervised signals based on multi-view augmentations of the single partial
point cloud. Additionally, to enhance the model's learning ability, we first
incorporate Mamba into self-supervised point cloud completion task, encouraging
the model to generate point clouds with better quality. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Result: 实验显示Refine-Control显著降低计算成本和延迟，同时保持高保真生成能力和可控性

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了边缘设备部署条件图像生成模型的资源约束和数据稀缺问题

Abstract: Conditional image generation models have achieved remarkable results by
leveraging text-based control to generate customized images. However, the high
resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have
hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and
privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised
distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student
model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different
levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity,
we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and
unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant
reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity
generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative
metrics.

Conclusion: MultiMat通过多模态方法成功解决了程序化材质图合成的挑战，显著提升了生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural
materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and
reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in
computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects
parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed
acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive
understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such
graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training.
While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this
process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture
the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible
to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program
synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both
visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural
material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality
procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference
algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the
program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program
synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph
synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines,
establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 提升GAN生成图像的潜在空间效率和可控性，使图像编辑更加直观和可解释。

Method: 结合StyleGAN的结构化潜在空间、DragGAN的直观图像操作和PCA的降维能力，在AFHQ数据集上进行实验，将PCA引入DragGAN的W+潜在层。

Result: 在浅层潜在空间（W+层=3）中，PCA能显著减少优化时间，同时保持良好视觉质量并提升SSIM指标，还能实现不同模型（AFHQ-Dog和AFHQ-Cat）的潜在空间对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法为广泛的图像合成和编辑应用提供了高效且可解释的潜在空间控制可能性。

Abstract: This work integrates StyleGAN, DragGAN and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
to enhance the latent space efficiency and controllability of GAN-generated
images. Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive
image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model
alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces.
We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and
find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with
the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while
improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+
layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while
maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity
Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent
spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images
generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains
(AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these
aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable
manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable
latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing
applications.

Abstract: We introduce MinerU2.5, a 1.2B-parameter document parsing vision-language
model that achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy while maintaining
exceptional computational efficiency. Our approach employs a coarse-to-fine,
two-stage parsing strategy that decouples global layout analysis from local
content recognition. In the first stage, the model performs efficient layout
analysis on downsampled images to identify structural elements, circumventing
the computational overhead of processing high-resolution inputs. In the second
stage, guided by the global layout, it performs targeted content recognition on
native-resolution crops extracted from the original image, preserving
fine-grained details in dense text, complex formulas, and tables. To support
this strategy, we developed a comprehensive data engine that generates diverse,
large-scale training corpora for both pretraining and fine-tuning. Ultimately,
MinerU2.5 demonstrates strong document parsing ability, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing both
general-purpose and domain-specific models across various recognition tasks,
while maintaining significantly lower computational overhead.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing often fail at complex
analytical tasks, a limitation stemming from their end-to-end training paradigm
that bypasses crucial reasoning steps and leads to unverifiable outputs. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Perceptually-Grounded Geospatial
Chain-of-Thought (Geo-CoT), a framework that models remote sensing analysis as
a verifiable, multi-step process. We instill this analytical process through a
two-stage alignment strategy, leveraging Geo-CoT380k, the first large-scale
dataset of structured Geo-CoT rationales. This strategy first employs
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to instill the foundational cognitive
architecture, then leverages Group Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO) to refine
the model's reasoning policy towards factual correctness. The resulting model,
RSThinker, outputs both a final answer and its justifying, verifiable
analytical trace. This capability yields dominant performance, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art models across a comprehensive range of tasks.
The public release of our Geo-CoT380k dataset and RSThinker model upon
publication serves as a concrete pathway from opaque perception towards
structured, verifiable reasoning for Earth Observation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MUSplat是一个无需训练的开源框架，将2D开放词汇理解提升到3D高斯泼溅场景，解决了现有方法依赖逐场景训练、单语义设计和跨视图语义不一致的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主流方法存在三个关键缺陷：(i)依赖昂贵的逐场景重新训练，无法即插即用；(ii)限制性的单语义设计无法表示复杂的多概念语义；(iii)易受跨视图语义不一致影响，破坏最终语义表示。

Method: 利用预训练的2D分割模型生成多粒度2D掩码并提升到3D，为每个高斯点估计前景概率形成初始对象组，使用语义熵和几何不透明度优化模糊边界，通过视觉语言模型从最具代表性的视角解释对象外观，提取稳健的文本特征。

Result: MUSplat将场景适应时间从数小时减少到几分钟，在开放词汇3D对象选择和语义分割基准任务中优于已建立的基于训练的框架，同时解决了它们的单语义限制。

Conclusion: 通过完全放弃特征优化，MUSplat提供了一种无需训练的高效解决方案，成功解决了现有3D语义表示方法的关键限制，实现了更好的性能和更快的处理速度。

Abstract: Lifting 2D open-vocabulary understanding into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
scenes is a critical challenge. However, mainstream methods suffer from three
key flaws: (i) their reliance on costly per-scene retraining prevents
plug-and-play application; (ii) their restrictive monosemous design fails to
represent complex, multi-concept semantics; and (iii) their vulnerability to
cross-view semantic inconsistencies corrupts the final semantic representation.
To overcome these limitations, we introduce MUSplat, a training-free framework
that abandons feature optimization entirely. Leveraging a pre-trained 2D
segmentation model, our pipeline generates and lifts multi-granularity 2D masks
into 3D, where we estimate a foreground probability for each Gaussian point to
form initial object groups. We then optimize the ambiguous boundaries of these
initial groups using semantic entropy and geometric opacity. Subsequently, by
interpreting the object's appearance across its most representative viewpoints,
a Vision-Language Model (VLM) distills robust textual features that reconciles
visual inconsistencies, enabling open-vocabulary querying via semantic
matching. By eliminating the costly per-scene training process, MUSplat reduces
scene adaptation time from hours to mere minutes. On benchmark tasks for
open-vocabulary 3D object selection and semantic segmentation, MUSplat
outperforms established training-based frameworks while simultaneously
addressing their monosemous limitations.

TL;DR: UrbanFeel是一个评估多模态大语言模型在城市发展理解和主观环境感知方面性能的综合性基准，包含14.3K个视觉问题，涵盖静态场景感知、时间变化理解和主观环境感知三个维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市发展影响全球一半以上人口，需要从人类中心视角理解其结构和感知变化。现有基准在探索MLLMs在城市环境中的表现方面有限，缺乏对时间演化和与人类感知一致的主观城市环境的系统探索。

Method: 收集全球11个代表性城市的多时间单视角和全景街景图像，通过空间聚类、基于规则的生成、模型辅助提示和人工标注的混合流程生成高质量问答对。

Result: 评估20个最先进MLLMs发现，Gemini-2.5 Pro表现最佳，准确率接近人类专家水平，平均差距仅1.5%。多数模型在基于场景理解的任务上表现良好，某些模型在像素级变化检测上甚至超越人类标注者，但在需要时间推理的任务上表现下降。

Conclusion: MLLMs在城市环境感知方面展现出巨大潜力，特别是在场景理解和某些主观感知维度上能达到或超越人类水平，但在时间推理方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Urban development impacts over half of the global population, making
human-centered understanding of its structural and perceptual changes essential
for sustainable development. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities across various domains, existing benchmarks
that explore their performance in urban environments remain limited, lacking
systematic exploration of temporal evolution and subjective perception of urban
environment that aligns with human perception. To address these limitations, we
propose UrbanFeel, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the
performance of MLLMs in urban development understanding and subjective
environmental perception. UrbanFeel comprises 14.3K carefully constructed
visual questions spanning three cognitively progressive dimensions: Static
Scene Perception, Temporal Change Understanding, and Subjective Environmental
Perception. We collect multi-temporal single-view and panoramic street-view
images from 11 representative cities worldwide, and generate high-quality
question-answer pairs through a hybrid pipeline of spatial clustering,
rule-based generation, model-assisted prompting, and manual annotation. Through
extensive evaluation of 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, we observe that Gemini-2.5
Pro achieves the best overall performance, with its accuracy approaching human
expert levels and narrowing the average gap to just 1.5\%. Most models perform
well on tasks grounded in scene understanding. In particular, some models even
surpass human annotators in pixel-level change detection. However, performance
drops notably in tasks requiring temporal reasoning over urban development.
Additionally, in the subjective perception dimension, several models reach
human-level or even higher consistency in evaluating dimension such as
beautiful and safety.

*Jiaping Yu,Muli Yang,Jiapeng Ji,Jiexi Yan,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EXCL方法解决无源无监督域自适应问题，通过双专家框架和检索增强交互优化管道，在无需源数据的情况下实现目标域适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFUDA方法要么仅利用源模型预测，要么微调大型多模态模型，但都忽略了互补见解和目标数据的潜在结构。

Method: EXCL包含双专家框架（冻结源域模型+视觉语言模型）和检索增强交互优化管道（三阶段：协作检索、分别微调、学习一致性）。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: EXCL方法有效解决了SFUDA问题，通过双专家协作学习实现了无需源数据的域自适应。

Abstract: Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA) addresses the realistic
challenge of adapting a source-trained model to a target domain without access
to the source data, driven by concerns over privacy and cost. Existing SFUDA
methods either exploit only the source model's predictions or fine-tune large
multimodal models, yet both neglect complementary insights and the latent
structure of target data. In this paper, we propose the Experts Cooperative
Learning (EXCL). EXCL contains the Dual Experts framework and
Retrieval-Augmentation-Interaction optimization pipeline. The Dual Experts
framework places a frozen source-domain model (augmented with Conv-Adapter) and
a pretrained vision-language model (with a trainable text prompt) on equal
footing to mine consensus knowledge from unlabeled target samples. To
effectively train these plug-in modules under purely unsupervised conditions,
we introduce Retrieval-Augmented-Interaction(RAIN), a three-stage pipeline that
(1) collaboratively retrieves pseudo-source and complex target samples, (2)
separately fine-tunes each expert on its respective sample set, and (3)
enforces learning object consistency via a shared learning result. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach matches
state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: FlashEdit是一个实时图像编辑框架，通过三步创新实现150倍加速：一步式反转编辑、背景屏蔽技术和稀疏空间交叉注意力机制，在0.2秒内完成高质量编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的文本引导图像编辑方法虽然质量出色，但计算延迟过高，阻碍了实际应用，需要开发实时高效的编辑框架。

Method: 1. 一步式反转编辑(OSIE)管道，避免昂贵的迭代过程；2. 背景屏蔽(BG-Shield)技术，选择性修改编辑区域特征；3. 稀疏空间交叉注意力(SSCA)机制，抑制语义泄漏。

Result: FlashEdit在保持优异背景一致性和结构完整性的同时，编辑时间低于0.2秒，相比之前的多步方法实现了150倍以上的加速。

Conclusion: FlashEdit通过创新的高效设计实现了实时高质量的图像编辑，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-guided image editing with diffusion models has achieved remarkable
quality but suffers from prohibitive latency, hindering real-world
applications. We introduce FlashEdit, a novel framework designed to enable
high-fidelity, real-time image editing. Its efficiency stems from three key
innovations: (1) a One-Step Inversion-and-Editing (OSIE) pipeline that bypasses
costly iterative processes; (2) a Background Shield (BG-Shield) technique that
guarantees background preservation by selectively modifying features only
within the edit region; and (3) a Sparsified Spatial Cross-Attention (SSCA)
mechanism that ensures precise, localized edits by suppressing semantic leakage
to the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashEdit maintains
superior background consistency and structural integrity, while performing
edits in under 0.2 seconds, which is an over 150$\times$ speedup compared to
prior multi-step methods. Our code will be made publicly available at

TL;DR: Neural-MedBench是一个专门针对神经学领域设计的紧凑型多模态临床推理基准测试，整合MRI扫描、电子健康记录和临床笔记，用于评估视觉语言模型在真实临床诊断推理中的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学基准测试主要关注分类准确性，导致模型看似表现良好但在高风险诊断推理中仍会失败，需要专门评估临床推理能力的基准。

Method: 开发了包含多序列MRI扫描、结构化电子健康记录和临床笔记的基准数据集，涵盖鉴别诊断、病变识别和推理生成三个核心任务，并采用结合LLM评分、临床医生验证和语义相似度度量的混合评分流程。

Result: 对GPT-4o、Claude-4和MedGemma等先进VLM的系统评估显示，相比传统数据集性能显著下降，错误分析表明推理失败而非感知错误是模型的主要短板。

Conclusion: 提出双轴评估框架：广度导向的大数据集用于统计泛化，深度导向的紧凑基准（如Neural-MedBench）用于推理保真度，为临床可信AI提供严格且成本效益高的评估方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at
https://neuromedbench.github.io/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed,
which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet
cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniMapGen是一个用于大规模地图构建的生成式框架，通过将车道线表示为离散序列，支持多模态输入，并采用状态更新策略，解决了卫星数据固有缺陷和传统感知方法向量化效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大规模地图构建方法依赖昂贵的专用数据采集车辆和劳动密集型标注过程，而现有的基于卫星的方法存在数据遮挡、过时等固有缺陷，以及感知方法向量化效率低导致道路不连续粗糙的问题。

Method: 1) 将车道线表示为离散序列并建立迭代策略生成更完整平滑的地图向量；2) 提出支持BEV、PV和文本提示多模态输入的灵活架构；3) 开发状态更新策略确保构建地图的全局连续性和一致性。

Result: 在OpenSatMap数据集上达到最先进性能，能够推断被遮挡道路并预测数据集中缺失的道路标注。

Conclusion: UniMapGen通过创新的生成式框架有效解决了大规模地图构建中的关键挑战，为自动驾驶和导航系统提供了更高效可靠的地图构建方案。

Abstract: Large-scale map construction is foundational for critical applications such
as autonomous driving and navigation systems. Traditional large-scale map
construction approaches mainly rely on costly and inefficient special data
collection vehicles and labor-intensive annotation processes. While existing
satellite-based methods have demonstrated promising potential in enhancing the
efficiency and coverage of map construction, they exhibit two major
limitations: (1) inherent drawbacks of satellite data (e.g., occlusions,
outdatedness) and (2) inefficient vectorization from perception-based methods,
resulting in discontinuous and rough roads that require extensive
post-processing. This paper presents a novel generative framework, UniMapGen,
for large-scale map construction, offering three key innovations: (1)
representing lane lines as \textbf{discrete sequence} and establishing an
iterative strategy to generate more complete and smooth map vectors than
traditional perception-based methods. (2) proposing a flexible architecture
that supports \textbf{multi-modal} inputs, enabling dynamic selection among
BEV, PV, and text prompt, to overcome the drawbacks of satellite data. (3)
developing a \textbf{state update} strategy for global continuity and
consistency of the constructed large-scale map. UniMapGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the OpenSatMap dataset. Furthermore, UniMapGen
can infer occluded roads and predict roads missing from dataset annotations.
Our code will be released.

TL;DR: GS-2M：基于3D高斯泼溅的统一网格重建和材质分解方法，能有效处理高反光表面，无需外部模型先验


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法分别处理网格重建和材质分解任务，难以重建高反光表面，且依赖外部模型先验来提升分解效果

Method: 联合优化与渲染深度和法线质量相关的属性，提出基于多视角光度变化的新型粗糙度监督策略，结合精心设计的损失函数和优化过程

Result: 重建结果与最先进方法相当，为下游任务提供三角形网格及其关联的材质组件

Conclusion: 该统一框架在广泛使用的数据集上验证有效，与最先进的表面重建方法进行定性比较

Abstract: We propose a unified solution for mesh reconstruction and material
decomposition from multi-view images based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, referred
to as GS-2M. Previous works handle these tasks separately and struggle to
reconstruct highly reflective surfaces, often relying on priors from external
models to enhance the decomposition results. Conversely, our method addresses
these two problems by jointly optimizing attributes relevant to the quality of
rendered depth and normals, maintaining geometric details while being resilient
to reflective surfaces. Although contemporary works effectively solve these
tasks together, they often employ sophisticated neural components to learn
scene properties, which hinders their performance at scale. To further
eliminate these neural components, we propose a novel roughness supervision
strategy based on multi-view photometric variation. When combined with a
carefully designed loss and optimization process, our unified framework
produces reconstruction results comparable to state-of-the-art methods,
delivering triangle meshes and their associated material components for
downstream tasks. We validate the effectiveness of our approach with widely
used datasets from previous works and qualitative comparisons with
state-of-the-art surface reconstruction methods.

Motivation: 传统方法创建机器人训练所需的桌面场景依赖耗时的手动布局设计或纯随机布局，在合理性和任务对齐方面存在局限。

Method: 提出空间推理链，将生成过程分解为物体推断、空间相互关系推理和场景图构建；开发基于LLM的MesaTask框架，并采用DPO算法进行增强。

Result: 构建了包含约10,700个合成桌面场景的大规模数据集MesaTask-10K；实验表明MesaTask在生成符合任务描述且布局真实的桌面场景方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MesaTask框架能够有效弥合高级任务指令与桌面场景之间的差距，生成物理合理且与任务对齐的桌面场景。

Abstract: The ability of robots to interpret human instructions and execute
manipulation tasks necessitates the availability of task-relevant tabletop
scenes for training. However, traditional methods for creating these scenes
rely on time-consuming manual layout design or purely randomized layouts, which
are limited in terms of plausibility or alignment with the tasks. In this
paper, we formulate a novel task, namely task-oriented tabletop scene
generation, which poses significant challenges due to the substantial gap
between high-level task instructions and the tabletop scenes. To support
research on such a challenging task, we introduce MesaTask-10K, a large-scale
dataset comprising approximately 10,700 synthetic tabletop scenes with manually
crafted layouts that ensure realistic layouts and intricate inter-object
relations. To bridge the gap between tasks and scenes, we propose a Spatial
Reasoning Chain that decomposes the generation process into object inference,
spatial interrelation reasoning, and scene graph construction for the final 3D
layout. We present MesaTask, an LLM-based framework that utilizes this
reasoning chain and is further enhanced with DPO algorithms to generate
physically plausible tabletop scenes that align well with given task
descriptions. Exhaustive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of
MesaTask compared to baselines in generating task-conforming tabletop scenes
with realistic layouts. Project page is at https://mesatask.github.io/

Motivation: 尽管DeepSeek-R1已证明基于规则的强化学习的成功，但在文档分析领域强化学习应用较少。许多下游任务可能受益于强化学习的新兴特性，特别是增强的推理能力。

Method: 使用基于规则的强化学习方法，在文档图像分类任务上进行研究，考察了三种不同的分布外场景：分布外图像、未见过的类别和不同模态。

Result: 研究发现强化学习在分布外数据上表现出更好的泛化能力，特别是在三种测试场景中都显示出优势。

Conclusion: 基于规则的强化学习在文档分析任务中具有潜力，特别是在处理分布外数据时表现出更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Rule-based reinforcement learning has been gaining popularity ever since
DeepSeek-R1 has demonstrated its success through simple verifiable rewards. In
the domain of document analysis, reinforcement learning is not as prevalent,
even though many downstream tasks may benefit from the emerging properties of
reinforcement learning, particularly the enhanced reason capabilities. We study
the effects of rule-based reinforcement learning with the task of Document
Image Classification which is one of the most commonly studied downstream tasks
in document analysis. We find that reinforcement learning tends to have better
generalisation capabilities to out-of-distritbution data, which we examine in
three different scenarios, namely out-of-distribution images, unseen classes
and different modalities. Our code is available at

*Wonjun Lee,Haon Park,Doehyeon Lee,Bumsub Ham,Suhyun Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneSplit是一种针对文本到视频(T2V)模型的黑盒越狱攻击方法，通过将有害叙述分割成多个看似良性的场景，利用场景组合约束生成空间，从而绕过安全机制生成有害视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着T2V模型的快速发展，其安全风险日益受到关注。虽然已有研究探索了LLMs、VLMs和T2I模型的越狱攻击，但T2V模型的安全漏洞尚未得到充分研究，存在显著的安全空白。

Method: 提出SceneSplit方法：1）将有害叙述分解为多个单独良性的场景；2）利用场景组合约束生成空间，引导模型输出有害视频；3）通过迭代场景操作绕过安全过滤器；4）使用策略库重用成功攻击模式提高效果。

Result: 在11个安全类别上评估T2V模型，SceneSplit在Luma Ray2上达到77.2%的平均攻击成功率，在Hailuo上达到84.1%，在Veo2上达到78.2%，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 当前T2V安全机制容易受到利用叙事结构的攻击，这项工作为理解和改进T2V模型安全性提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Along with the rapid advancement of numerous Text-to-Video (T2V) models,
growing concerns have emerged regarding their safety risks. While recent
studies have explored vulnerabilities in models like LLMs, VLMs, and
Text-to-Image (T2I) models through jailbreak attacks, T2V models remain largely
unexplored, leaving a significant safety gap. To address this gap, we introduce
SceneSplit, a novel black-box jailbreak method that works by fragmenting a
harmful narrative into multiple scenes, each individually benign. This approach
manipulates the generative output space, the abstract set of all potential
video outputs for a given prompt, using the combination of scenes as a powerful
constraint to guide the final outcome. While each scene individually
corresponds to a wide and safe space where most outcomes are benign, their
sequential combination collectively restricts this space, narrowing it to an
unsafe region and significantly increasing the likelihood of generating a
harmful video. This core mechanism is further enhanced through iterative scene
manipulation, which bypasses the safety filter within this constrained unsafe
region. Additionally, a strategy library that reuses successful attack patterns
further improves the attack's overall effectiveness and robustness. To validate
our method, we evaluate SceneSplit across 11 safety categories on T2V models.
Our results show that it achieves a high average Attack Success Rate (ASR) of
77.2% on Luma Ray2, 84.1% on Hailuo, and 78.2% on Veo2, significantly
outperforming the existing baseline. Through this work, we demonstrate that
current T2V safety mechanisms are vulnerable to attacks that exploit narrative
structure, providing new insights for understanding and improving the safety of
T2V models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动量的采样技术HiGS，通过整合最近模型预测来提升扩散模型采样质量和效率，无需额外训练或计算开销


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得显著进展，但其输出在较少神经函数评估或较低引导尺度下仍显得不真实且缺乏细节

Method: HiGS利用当前预测与过去预测加权平均值之间的差异来引导采样过程，从而获得更真实、细节更丰富的输出

Result: HiGS在多样化模型和架构下均能提升图像质量，使用预训练SiT模型在仅30步采样下达到ImageNet 256×256无引导生成的新SOTA FID 1.61

Conclusion: HiGS是一种即插即用的标准扩散采样增强方法，能够实现更快生成和更高保真度

Abstract: While diffusion models have made remarkable progress in image generation,
their outputs can still appear unrealistic and lack fine details, especially
when using fewer number of neural function evaluations (NFEs) or lower guidance
scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling
technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and
efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into
each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the
current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the
sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and
structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and
integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither
extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS
consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and
under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a
pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for
unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps
(instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play
enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with
higher fidelity.

Motivation: 轻量级3D医学图像分割面临效率与鲁棒性的根本冲突，特别是在处理复杂解剖结构和异质模态时。

Method: 采用双流CNN-Transformer架构，包含配对窗口注意力(PWA)和Johnson-Lindenstrauss引理指导的卷积(JLC)，实现"扫视-聚焦"原则，并通过空间解耦知识转移(SDKT)注入纹理先验。

Result: 在多模态基准测试中，VeloxSeg实现了26%的Dice系数提升，GPU吞吐量提高11倍，CPU吞吐量提高48倍。

Conclusion: VeloxSeg通过创新的架构设计和知识转移策略，在保持轻量化的同时显著提升了3D医学图像分割的性能和效率。

Abstract: Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a
fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing
complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we
study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of
high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile
representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a
deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of
Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided
convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle,
where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust
local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the
model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an
extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction
into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models
heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer
(SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a
self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger
representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results
on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement,
alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x. Codes are available
at https://github.com/JinPLu/VeloxSeg.

TL;DR: RAPID3是一个无需训练的三级强化加速框架，通过步骤跳过、缓存重用和稀疏注意力三个轻量级策略头，在保持生成器冻结的情况下实现DiT模型的3倍加速采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DiT加速方法要么使用统一启发式策略牺牲质量，要么需要高昂的微调成本，需要一种零更新基础生成器的图像自适应加速方案。

Method: 使用三个独立策略头观察去噪状态并决策加速策略，通过GRPO在线训练策略参数，同时使用对抗性判别器增强奖励信号防止奖励黑客攻击。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3和FLUX等DiT骨干网络上，RAPID3实现了近3倍的采样加速，同时保持竞争力的生成质量。

Conclusion: RAPID3证明了零更新基础生成器的自适应加速可行性，为DiT模型提供了高效实用的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) excel at visual generation yet remain hampered
by slow sampling. Existing training-free accelerators - step reduction, feature
caching, and sparse attention - enhance inference speed but typically rely on a
uniform heuristic or a manually designed adaptive strategy for all images,
leaving quality on the table. Alternatively, dynamic neural networks offer
per-image adaptive acceleration, but their high fine-tuning costs limit broader
applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce RAPID3: Tri-Level
Reinforced Acceleration Policies for Diffusion Transformers, a framework that
delivers image-wise acceleration with zero updates to the base generator.
Specifically, three lightweight policy heads - Step-Skip, Cache-Reuse, and
Sparse-Attention - observe the current denoising state and independently decide
their corresponding speed-up at each timestep. All policy parameters are
trained online via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) while the
generator remains frozen. Meanwhile, an adversarially learned discriminator
augments the reward signal, discouraging reward hacking by boosting returns
only when generated samples stay close to the original model's distribution.
Across state-of-the-art DiT backbones, including Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX,
RAPID3 achieves nearly 3x faster sampling with competitive generation quality.

mapping visual features to semantic labels or attempt to enhance learning by
fusing visual and attribute information. However, these methods fail to fully
exploit attribute knowledge and contextual information for more accurate
recognition. Although recent works have started to consider using attribute
text as additional input to enhance the association between visual and semantic
information, these methods are still in their infancy. To address the above
challenges, this paper proposes the construction of a multi-modal knowledge
graph, which is utilized to mine the relationships between local visual
features and text, as well as the relationships between attributes and
extensive visual context samples. Specifically, we propose an effective
multi-modal knowledge graph construction method that fully considers the
relationships among attributes and the relationships between attributes and
vision tokens. To effectively model these relationships, this paper introduces
a knowledge graph-guided cross-modal hypergraph learning framework to enhance
the standard pedestrian attribute recognition framework. Comprehensive
experiments on multiple PAR benchmark datasets have thoroughly demonstrated the
effectiveness of our proposed knowledge graph for the PAR task, establishing a
strong foundation for knowledge-guided pedestrian attribute recognition. The

Method: 使用分层合成生成管道，包括基于网格的原理图生成器和带自动推导符号方程标签的框图生成器，评估6个最先进的MLLMs。

Result: 闭源模型在感知任务上准确率超过85%，但在符号推导和分析推理上低于19%，显示视觉解析与符号推理之间存在关键差距。

Conclusion: 符号推理能力是工程能力的关键指标，具有更强符号推理能力的模型在设计任务上表现更好。

Abstract: Engineering design operates through hierarchical abstraction from system
specifications to component implementations, requiring visual understanding
coupled with mathematical reasoning at each level. While Multi-modal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) excel at natural image tasks, their ability to extract
mathematical models from technical diagrams remains unexplored. We present
\textbf{CircuitSense}, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating circuit
understanding across this hierarchy through 8,006+ problems spanning
component-level schematics to system-level block diagrams. Our benchmark
uniquely examines the complete engineering workflow: Perception, Analysis, and
Design, with a particular emphasis on the critical but underexplored capability
of deriving symbolic equations from visual inputs. We introduce a hierarchical
synthetic generation pipeline consisting of a grid-based schematic generator
and a block diagram generator with auto-derived symbolic equation labels.
Comprehensive evaluation of six state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
closed-source and open-source models, reveals fundamental limitations in
visual-to-mathematical reasoning. Closed-source models achieve over 85\%
accuracy on perception tasks involving component recognition and topology
identification, yet their performance on symbolic derivation and analytical
reasoning falls below 19\%, exposing a critical gap between visual parsing and
symbolic reasoning. Models with stronger symbolic reasoning capabilities
consistently achieve higher design task accuracy, confirming the fundamental
role of mathematical understanding in circuit synthesis and establishing
symbolic reasoning as the key metric for engineering competence.

Abstract: The real-time detection of small objects in complex scenes, such as the
unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photography captured by drones, has dual
challenges of detecting small targets (<32 pixels) and maintaining real-time
efficiency on resource-constrained platforms. While YOLO-series detectors have
achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer
from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where
small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes
HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that
enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8
architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network
(HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level
connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO
includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise
Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which
significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity
without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is
designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the
tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies
on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of
HierLight-YOLO.

Motivation: 当前视觉模型在处理复杂密集的真实世界图像时，遮挡问题仍然是一个重大挑战，需要准确预测物体间的遮挡顺序关系。

Method: 使用预训练的GPT-4模型，通过专门设计的提示来分析输入图像，生成遮挡顺序预测，然后解析响应构建遮挡矩阵。

Result: 在COCOA和InstaOrder数据集上的评估结果显示，该模型能够利用语义上下文、视觉模式和常识知识产生更准确的顺序预测。

Conclusion: 该方法能够以零样本方式推理遮挡关系，无需标注训练数据，可以轻松集成到遮挡处理框架中。

Abstract: Occlusion remains a significant challenge for current vision models to
robustly interpret complex and dense real-world images and scenes. To address
this limitation and to enable accurate prediction of the occlusion order
relationship between objects, we propose leveraging the advanced capability of
a pre-trained GPT-4 model to deduce the order. By providing a specifically
designed prompt along with the input image, GPT-4 can analyze the image and
generate order predictions. The response can then be parsed to construct an
occlusion matrix which can be utilized in assisting with other occlusion
handling tasks and image understanding. We report the results of evaluating the
model on COCOA and InstaOrder datasets. The results show that by using semantic
context, visual patterns, and commonsense knowledge, the model can produce more
accurate order predictions. Unlike baseline methods, the model can reason about
occlusion relationships in a zero-shot fashion, which requires no annotated
training data and can easily be integrated into occlusion handling frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多焦点图像融合方法难以保持清晰的焦点-散焦边界，导致模糊过渡和焦点细节丢失，需要改进边界质量。

Method: 使用梯度域模型获得完整边界的初始融合结果，结合Tenengrad梯度检测提取显著特征，开发基于梯度和互补信息的焦点度量来精炼边界。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在主观和客观评估中均优于12种最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的显著边界增强方法能够生成高质量融合边界，有效提升多焦点图像融合性能。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) aims to yield an all-focused image from
multiple partially focused inputs, which is crucial in applications cover
sur-veillance, microscopy, and computational photography. However, existing
methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in
blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose
a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates
high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation.
Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial
fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary
details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract
salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image,
generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop
a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the
salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize
focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive
experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective
evaluations. We have realized codes in https://github.com/Lihyua/GICI

TL;DR: 本文提出TDOA方法，针对文本动态输出场景进行对抗攻击，通过聚类训练将动态输出转为静态单输出问题，采用最远标签目标攻击策略，在有限查询下有效攻击大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本对抗攻击方法主要针对静态场景，无法处理动态输出标签空间的问题，需要更有效的攻击方法来应对实际应用中的动态输出场景。

Method: 使用基于聚类的替代模型训练方法将动态输出场景转换为静态单输出场景，并提出最远标签目标攻击策略选择偏离模型粗粒度标签的对抗向量。

Result: 在4个数据集和8个受害者模型上验证，单次查询最大攻击成功率50.81%，在静态场景中达到82.68%的ASR，在生成式设置中超越先前结果0.64 RDBLEU和0.62 RDchrF。

Conclusion: TDOA方法能有效处理动态输出场景的对抗攻击，在有限访问条件下具有破坏大语言模型的强大潜力，同时在传统静态场景中也达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Text adversarial attack methods are typically designed for static scenarios
with fixed numbers of output labels and a predefined label space, relying on
extensive querying of the victim model (query-based attacks) or the surrogate
model (transfer-based attacks). To address this gap, we introduce the Textual
Dynamic Outputs Attack (TDOA) method, which employs a clustering-based
surrogate model training approach to convert the dynamic-output scenario into a
static single-output scenario. To improve attack effectiveness, we propose the
farthest-label targeted attack strategy, which selects adversarial vectors that
deviate most from the model's coarse-grained labels, thereby maximizing
disruption. We extensively evaluate TDOA on four datasets and eight victim
models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o, ChatGPT-4.1), showing its effectiveness in crafting
adversarial examples and its strong potential to compromise large language
models with limited access. With a single query per text, TDOA achieves a
maximum attack success rate of 50.81\%. Additionally, we find that TDOA also
achieves state-of-the-art performance in conventional static output scenarios,
reaching a maximum ASR of 82.68\%. Meanwhile, by conceptualizing translation
tasks as classification problems with unbounded output spaces, we extend the
TDOA framework to generative settings, surpassing prior results by up to 0.64
RDBLEU and 0.62 RDchrF.

Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的医学图像语义分割系统尚未完善，性能有待提升。作者认为通过将常见的医学知识融入分割模型的损失函数中，可以改善分割效果。

Method: 引入逻辑张量网络（LTNs）使用一阶逻辑（FOL）规则编码医学背景知识，包括分割形状约束和不同分割区域间的关系。采用SwinUNETR作为语义分割主干网络，构建端到端框架。

Result: 在脑部MRI扫描中分割海马体的任务上，实验表明LTNs能够提升基线分割性能，特别是在训练数据稀缺的情况下效果更为明显。

Conclusion: 尽管仍处于初步阶段，但神经符号方法具有足够的通用性，可以适应并应用于其他医学语义分割任务。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis, aiding
medical decision-making by helping radiologists distinguish objects in an
image. Research in this field has been driven by deep learning applications,
which have the potential to scale these systems even in the presence of noise
and artifacts. However, these systems are not yet perfected. We argue that
performance can be improved by incorporating common medical knowledge into the
segmentation model's loss function. To this end, we introduce Logic Tensor
Networks (LTNs) to encode medical background knowledge using first-order logic
(FOL) rules. The encoded rules span from constraints on the shape of the
produced segmentation, to relationships between different segmented areas. We
apply LTNs in an end-to-end framework with a SwinUNETR for semantic
segmentation. We evaluate our method on the task of segmenting the hippocampus
in brain MRI scans. Our experiments show that LTNs improve the baseline
segmentation performance, especially when training data is scarce. Despite
being in its preliminary stages, we argue that neurosymbolic methods are
general enough to be adapted and applied to other medical semantic segmentation
tasks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new
opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety
concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion
models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction
paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE
that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary
visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce
S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which
incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally
adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain
semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced
diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation
quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image
generation by earlier methods.

Motivation: 医学图像解剖理解对于自动报告生成、术中导航和器官定位至关重要，但受限于专家标注数据的稀缺。需要开发能够利用参考图像指导未标注目标图像理解的方法。

Method: 首先训练VLM通过参考图像与目标图像之间的相对空间推理来识别解剖区域，然后将其空间线索与SAM2的精细分割能力相结合，实现小解剖区域(如血管段)的定位和像素级分割。

Result: 在两个分布内和两个分布外数据集上，RAU始终优于使用相同内存设置的SAM2微调基线，产生更准确的分割和更可靠的定位，并展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RAU是首个探索VLM在医学图像中基于参考的解剖结构识别、定位和分割能力的研究，其优异性能突显了VLM驱动方法在自动化临床工作流程中解剖理解的潜力。

Abstract: Anatomical understanding through deep learning is critical for automatic
report generation, intra-operative navigation, and organ localization in
medical imaging; however, its progress is constrained by the scarcity of
expert-labeled data. A promising remedy is to leverage an annotated reference
image to guide the interpretation of an unlabeled target. Although recent
vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit non-trivial visual reasoning, their
reference-based understanding and fine-grained localization remain limited. We
introduce RAU, a framework for reference-based anatomical understanding with
VLMs. We first show that a VLM learns to identify anatomical regions through
relative spatial reasoning between reference and target images, trained on a
moderately sized dataset. We validate this capability through visual question
answering (VQA) and bounding box prediction. Next, we demonstrate that the
VLM-derived spatial cues can be seamlessly integrated with the fine-grained
segmentation capability of SAM2, enabling localization and pixel-level
segmentation of small anatomical regions, such as vessel segments. Across two
in-distribution and two out-of-distribution datasets, RAU consistently
outperforms a SAM2 fine-tuning baseline using the same memory setup, yielding
more accurate segmentations and more reliable localization. More importantly,
its strong generalization ability makes it scalable to out-of-distribution
datasets, a property crucial for medical image applications. To the best of our
knowledge, RAU is the first to explore the capability of VLMs for
reference-based identification, localization, and segmentation of anatomical
structures in medical images. Its promising performance highlights the
potential of VLM-driven approaches for anatomical understanding in automated
clinical workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测器由于从有限训练数据中学习到的偏差，难以泛化到新的伪造类型。本文识别了频率域中的频谱偏差问题，即检测器过度依赖特定频带。

Method: 提出FreqDebias框架：1) Fo-Mixup增强动态多样化训练样本的频率特征；2) 双重一致性正则化，包括基于CAM的局部一致性和基于vMF分布的全局一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，FreqDebias显著增强了跨域泛化能力，在跨域和域内设置下均优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: FreqDebias通过缓解频谱偏差有效提升了深度伪造检测器的泛化性能，为应对新型伪造攻击提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deepfake detectors often struggle to generalize to novel forgery types due to
biases learned from limited training data. In this paper, we identify a new
type of model bias in the frequency domain, termed spectral bias, where
detectors overly rely on specific frequency bands, restricting their ability to
generalize across unseen forgeries. To address this, we propose FreqDebias, a
frequency debiasing framework that mitigates spectral bias through two
complementary strategies. First, we introduce a novel Forgery Mixup (Fo-Mixup)
augmentation, which dynamically diversifies frequency characteristics of
training samples. Second, we incorporate a dual consistency regularization
(CR), which enforces both local consistency using class activation maps (CAMs)
and global consistency through a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a
hyperspherical embedding space. This dual CR mitigates over-reliance on certain
frequency components by promoting consistent representation learning under both
local and global supervision. Extensive experiments show that FreqDebias
significantly enhances cross-domain generalization and outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain and in-domain settings.

Motivation: 解决现有判别式修复器和UNet扩散先验在未知混合退化条件下容易产生过度平滑、幻觉或语义漂移的问题，实现无需图像描述的通用图像修复。

Method: 1. 轻量级双分支调节器：分别从退化输入和轻度修复代理注入信号以锚定几何结构和抑制伪影
2. 时间步和层自适应调制调度：在骨干网络层次结构中路由这些线索
3. 基于SigLIP特征的语义对齐：避免文本提示或MLLM描述带来的延迟和不稳定性

Conclusion: 对于大型DiTs，何时、何地以及如何调节——而不是增加参数或依赖文本提示——是实现稳健且无需描述的通用图像修复的关键因素。

Abstract: Universal image restoration (UIR) aims to recover images degraded by unknown
mixtures while preserving semantics -- conditions under which discriminative
restorers and UNet-based diffusion priors often oversmooth, hallucinate, or
drift. We present LucidFlux, a caption-free UIR framework that adapts a large
diffusion transformer (Flux.1) without image captions. LucidFlux introduces a
lightweight dual-branch conditioner that injects signals from the degraded
input and a lightly restored proxy to respectively anchor geometry and suppress
artifacts. Then, a timestep- and layer-adaptive modulation schedule is designed
to route these cues across the backbone's hierarchy, in order to yield
coarse-to-fine and context-aware updates that protect the global structure
while recovering texture. After that, to avoid the latency and instability of
text prompts or MLLM captions, we enforce caption-free semantic alignment via
SigLIP features extracted from the proxy. A scalable curation pipeline further
filters large-scale data for structure-rich supervision. Across synthetic and
in-the-wild benchmarks, LucidFlux consistently outperforms strong open-source
and commercial baselines, and ablation studies verify the necessity of each
component. LucidFlux shows that, for large DiTs, when, where, and what to
condition on -- rather than adding parameters or relying on text prompts -- is
the governing lever for robust and caption-free universal image restoration in
the wild.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种增强多模态大语言模型可解释性的方法，通过利用模态内交互来改进视觉和文本分支的解释质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释性研究主要关注跨模态归因，忽略了模态内依赖关系。视觉模态中孤立图像块归因忽略了空间上下文，文本模态中依赖前文标记引入了虚假激活，这些干扰降低了归因保真度。

Method: 视觉分支提出多尺度解释聚合(MSEA)，通过多尺度输入聚合归因来动态调整感受野；文本分支提出激活排名相关(ARC)，通过top-k预测排名对齐来测量上下文标记相关性，抑制无关上下文的虚假激活。

Result: 在多个先进MLLMs和基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法一致优于现有可解释性方法，产生了更忠实和细粒度的模型行为解释。

Conclusion: 通过有效利用模态内交互，提出的方法显著提升了多模态大语言模型的可解释性，为理解模型内部决策机制提供了更可靠的解释。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success
across diverse vision-language tasks, yet their internal decision-making
mechanisms remain insufficiently understood. Existing interpretability research
has primarily focused on cross-modal attribution, identifying which image
regions the model attends to during output generation. However, these
approaches often overlook intra-modal dependencies. In the visual modality,
attributing importance to isolated image patches ignores spatial context due to
limited receptive fields, resulting in fragmented and noisy explanations. In
the textual modality, reliance on preceding tokens introduces spurious
activations. Failing to effectively mitigate these interference compromises
attribution fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose enhancing
interpretability by leveraging intra-modal interaction. For the visual branch,
we introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Explanation Aggregation} (MSEA), which
aggregates attributions over multi-scale inputs to dynamically adjust receptive
fields, producing more holistic and spatially coherent visual explanations. For
the textual branch, we propose \textit{Activation Ranking Correlation} (ARC),
which measures the relevance of contextual tokens to the current token via
alignment of their top-$k$ prediction rankings. ARC leverages this relevance to
suppress spurious activations from irrelevant contexts while preserving
semantically coherent ones. Extensive experiments across state-of-the-art MLLMs
and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
existing interpretability methods, yielding more faithful and fine-grained
explanations of model behavior.

key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip
connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features,
and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep
layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale
Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive
Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN).
Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse
features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to
adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to
segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI,
GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.

Motivation: 传统模式识别模型使用预处理数据，但许多现代视觉任务无需人类参与，预处理可能不是最优选择；人体活动识别中传统方法数据传输效率低，严重影响可穿戴设备电池寿命

Method: 提出γ-Quant方法，学习任务特定的非线性量化，在原始图像目标检测和可穿戴数据人体活动识别中应用

Conclusion: 在低比特深度捕获场景下，任务特定的非线性量化方法能显著减少数据传输需求，同时保持模型性能

Abstract: Most pattern recognition models are developed on pre-proce\-ssed data. In
computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal
processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most
frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks
operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such
pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity
recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized
floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC)
as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data
transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In
this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where
sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant,
i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern
recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as
HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable
quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw
12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于分割导向可见光-红外图像融合的自监督训练框架SSVIF，通过跨分割一致性任务，无需分割标签即可学习高级语义特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VIF方法只关注融合图像质量，应用导向VIF方法需要下游任务标注数据，数据获取成本高。为解决这一问题，提出自监督训练框架。

Method: 利用特征级融合分割与像素级融合分割之间的一致性，设计跨分割一致性自监督任务，采用两阶段训练策略和动态权重调整方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，SSVIF仅使用未标注的可见光-红外图像对训练，性能优于传统VIF方法，与有监督的分割导向方法相当。

Conclusion: 提出的自监督框架SSVIF有效解决了应用导向VIF方法对标注数据的依赖问题，在无需分割标签的情况下实现了优异的性能。

Abstract: Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in
recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation
and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional
VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus
solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF
methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused
images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However,
compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require
datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object
detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To
address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for
segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between
feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based
segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation
consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features
without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a
two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for
effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive
experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image
pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised
segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中不同模态间域差距大的问题，现有GAN方法在高度可变区域难以捕捉跨域映射。

Result: 在公开数据集上实验表明，该方法能生成逼真的标注图像，显著增强目标域数据并提升分割性能。

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架有效解决了跨域医学图像生成问题，通过风格迁移和扩散模型的结合，实现了高质量的域适应。

Abstract: Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging
modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the
source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep
models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these
methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high
variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets
Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a
B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the
domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images
enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains.
Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the
target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize
high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy
pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method
that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images,
significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation
performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出PSTTS（渐进式时空令牌选择）模块，利用事件数据的时空分布特性识别和丢弃冗余令牌，在保持精度的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件帧的方法忽视了事件帧序列的高空间稀疏性和帧间运动冗余，导致大量计算开销。现有的RGB视频令牌稀疏化方法不适用于事件数据。

Method: PSTTS包含两个阶段：空间令牌净化（通过评估事件帧内事件的时空一致性来丢弃噪声和非事件区域）和时间令牌选择（通过评估相邻事件帧间的运动模式相似性来移除冗余时间信息）。

Result: 在HARDVS、DailyDVS-200和SeACT数据集上的实验表明，PSTTS显著提升效率：在DailyDVS-200数据集上减少FLOPs 29-43.6%，提升FPS 21.6-41.3%，同时保持任务精度。

Conclusion: PSTTS是一个无需额外参数的即插即用模块，能够有效处理事件数据的时空冗余，实现精度与效率的最佳平衡。

Abstract: Mainstream event-based spatio-temporal representation learning methods
typically process event streams by converting them into sequences of event
frames, achieving remarkable performance. However, they neglect the high
spatial sparsity and inter-frame motion redundancy inherent in event frame
sequences, leading to significant computational overhead. Existing token
sparsification methods for RGB videos rely on unreliable intermediate token
representations and neglect the influence of event noise, making them
ineffective for direct application to event data. In this paper, we propose
Progressive Spatio-Temporal Token Selection (PSTTS), a Plug-and-Play module for
event data without introducing any additional parameters. PSTTS exploits the
spatio-temporal distribution characteristics embedded in raw event data to
effectively identify and discard spatio-temporal redundant tokens, achieving an
optimal trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, PSTTS consists
of two stages, Spatial Token Purification and Temporal Token Selection. Spatial
Token Purification discards noise and non-event regions by assessing the
spatio-temporal consistency of events within each event frame to prevent
interference with subsequent temporal redundancy evaluation. Temporal Token
Selection evaluates the motion pattern similarity between adjacent event
frames, precisely identifying and removing redundant temporal information. We
apply PSTTS to four representative backbones UniformerV2, VideoSwin, EVMamba,
and ExACT on the HARDVS, DailyDVS-200, and SeACT datasets. Experimental results
demonstrate that PSTTS achieves significant efficiency improvements.
Specifically, PSTTS reduces FLOPs by 29-43.6% and increases FPS by 21.6-41.3%
on the DailyDVS-200 dataset, while maintaining task accuracy. Our code will be
available.

TL;DR: GCPO是一种针对自回归视觉生成的强化学习方法，通过识别关键图像标记并实施有效的标记级优化，仅使用30%的图像标记就能达到比全标记方法更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常对所有图像标记进行统一优化，但不同标记对RLVR训练的贡献程度不同，如何识别关键标记并实施有效的标记级优化是主要挑战。

Method: 从三个角度识别关键标记：因果依赖、熵诱导的空间结构、RLVR聚焦的标记多样性。对关键标记引入动态标记级优势权重来鼓励探索。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，GCPO仅使用30%的图像标记就能达到比全标记GRPO方法更好的性能。

Conclusion: GCPO通过有效识别和优化关键标记，为自回归视觉生成提供了一种高效的强化学习方法。

Abstract: Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising
progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across
all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for
RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to
identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement
effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we
propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy
$\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy
optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based
AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal
dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final
image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced
spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image
structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused
token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled
images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified
critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to
encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model
and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves
better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal
models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉输入与自然语言输出对齐方面表现出色，但生成的token对视觉模态的依赖程度尚不清楚，限制了模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Method: EAGLE通过将选定token归因到紧凑的感知区域，引入统一充分性（洞察分数）和必要性（必要性分数）的目标函数，通过稀疏化图像区域的贪心搜索进行优化，实现忠实高效的归因。

Result: 在开源多模态大语言模型上的广泛实验表明，EAGLE在忠实性、定位性和幻觉诊断方面始终优于现有方法，同时显著减少GPU内存需求。

Conclusion: EAGLE在提升多模态大语言模型可解释性方面具有有效性和实用性，为模型决策提供细粒度解释。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in aligning visual inputs with natural language outputs. Yet, the
extent to which generated tokens depend on visual modalities remains poorly
understood, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this work, we present
EAGLE, a lightweight black-box framework for explaining autoregressive token
generation in MLLMs. EAGLE attributes any selected tokens to compact perceptual
regions while quantifying the relative influence of language priors and
perceptual evidence. The framework introduces an objective function that
unifies sufficiency (insight score) and indispensability (necessity score),
optimized via greedy search over sparsified image regions for faithful and
efficient attribution. Beyond spatial attribution, EAGLE performs
modality-aware analysis that disentangles what tokens rely on, providing
fine-grained interpretability of model decisions. Extensive experiments across
open-source MLLMs show that EAGLE consistently outperforms existing methods in
faithfulness, localization, and hallucination diagnosis, while requiring
substantially less GPU memory. These results highlight its effectiveness and
practicality for advancing the interpretability of MLLMs. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颜色是人类视觉感知的基本维度，随着视觉语言模型的普及，了解它们是否像人类一样命名颜色对于有效的人机交互至关重要。

Method: 使用957个颜色样本，在五个代表性模型上复制经典颜色命名方法，进行跨语言分析和消融研究。

Result: 模型在典型颜色上准确率高，但在扩展的非典型颜色集上性能显著下降；识别出21个常见颜色术语；发现英语和中文的训练数据占主导地位；语言模型架构独立影响颜色命名能力。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型在颜色命名方面存在局限性，特别是在非典型颜色和跨语言场景中，语言模型架构对颜色命名有显著影响。

Abstract: Color serves as a fundamental dimension of human visual perception and a
primary means of communicating about objects and scenes. As vision-language
models (VLMs) become increasingly prevalent, understanding whether they name
colors like humans is crucial for effective human-AI interaction. We present
the first systematic evaluation of color naming capabilities across VLMs,
replicating classic color naming methodologies using 957 color samples across
five representative models. Our results show that while VLMs achieve high
accuracy on prototypical colors from classical studies, performance drops
significantly on expanded, non-prototypical color sets. We identify 21 common
color terms that consistently emerge across all models, revealing two distinct
approaches: constrained models using predominantly basic terms versus expansive
models employing systematic lightness modifiers. Cross-linguistic analysis
across nine languages demonstrates severe training imbalances favoring English
and Chinese, with hue serving as the primary driver of color naming decisions.
Finally, ablation studies reveal that language model architecture significantly
influences color naming independent of visual processing capabilities.

Result: EfficientDepth在性能上达到或超越现有最先进模型，同时显著减少计算资源消耗。

Conclusion: EfficientDepth系统有效解决了单目深度估计中的关键挑战，在保持高性能的同时实现了计算效率的显著提升。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE) plays a pivotal role in various computer
vision applications, such as robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous
driving. Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key
requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric
consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective
surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a
transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a
bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps.
We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as
well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE
method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve
training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and
fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a
loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth
maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance
comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with
significantly reduced computational resources.

Abstract: Category discovery (CD) is an emerging open-world learning task, which aims
at automatically categorizing unlabelled data containing instances from unseen
classes, given some labelled data from seen classes. This task has attracted
significant attention over the years and leads to a rich body of literature
trying to address the problem from different perspectives. In this survey, we
provide a comprehensive review of the literature, and offer detailed analysis
and in-depth discussion on different methods. Firstly, we introduce a taxonomy
for the literature by considering two base settings, namely novel category
discovery (NCD) and generalized category discovery (GCD), and several derived
settings that are designed to address the extra challenges in different
real-world application scenarios, including continual category discovery,
skewed data distribution, federated category discovery, etc. Secondly, for each
setting, we offer a detailed analysis of the methods encompassing three
fundamental components, representation learning, label assignment, and
estimation of class number. Thirdly, we benchmark all the methods and distill
key insights showing that large-scale pretrained backbones, hierarchical and
auxiliary cues, and curriculum-style training are all beneficial for category
discovery, while challenges remain in the design of label assignment, the
estimation of class numbers, and scaling to complex multi-object
scenarios.Finally, we discuss the key insights from the literature so far and
point out promising future research directions. We compile a living survey of

TL;DR: HyCoVAD是一个混合SSL-LLM模型，结合自监督学习和大型语言模型来检测复杂视频异常，在ComplexVAD数据集上达到72.5%的帧级AUC，比现有基线提升12.5%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂视频异常检测的挑战，这些异常由多个实体间的复杂关系和时序依赖定义，而非孤立动作。自监督学习方法难以理解语义交互，而LLM虽具强大推理能力但计算成本高且缺乏细粒度空间定位

Method: HyCoVAD结合多任务SSL时序分析器和LLM验证器。SSL模块基于nnFormer骨干网络，通过多个代理任务从视频帧中识别可疑异常帧，然后将选定的帧送入LLM进行语义上下文分析和基于规则推理的异常验证

Result: 在ComplexVAD数据集上达到72.5%的帧级AUC，比现有基线提升12.5%，同时减少了LLM计算量

Conclusion: HyCoVAD通过SSL-LLM混合方法有效解决了复杂视频异常检测问题，结合了自监督学习的时空模式建模和LLM的语义推理能力，在性能和计算效率上均取得显著提升

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is crucial for intelligent surveillance, but a
significant challenge lies in identifying complex anomalies, which are events
defined by intricate relationships and temporal dependencies among multiple
entities rather than by isolated actions. While self-supervised learning (SSL)
methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often
struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large
language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are
computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained
spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly
Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal
analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone
which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with
multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of
anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the
analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to
validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD
dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming
existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our
interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to
facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.

TL;DR: JanusVLN提出了一种新的视觉语言导航框架，采用双隐式神经记忆来分别建模空间几何和视觉语义记忆，解决了传统方法中空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VLN方法依赖显式语义记忆（如文本认知地图或历史视觉帧），导致空间信息丢失、计算冗余和内存膨胀，阻碍高效导航。受人类导航中隐式场景表示的启发，提出双隐式神经记忆。

Method: 1. 扩展MLLM以融入空间几何编码器的3D先验知识，增强仅基于RGB输入的空间推理能力；2. 构建空间几何和视觉语义编码器的历史键值缓存作为双隐式记忆；3. 仅保留初始和滑动窗口中token的KVs，避免冗余计算，实现高效增量更新。

Result: JanusVLN在实验中优于20多种最新方法，达到SOTA性能：相比使用多种数据类型输入的方法，成功率提升10.5-35.5；相比使用更多RGB训练数据的方法，成功率提升3.6-10.8。

Conclusion: 双隐式神经记忆作为一种新范式，为未来VLN研究探索了有前景的新方向。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation requires an embodied agent to navigate through
unseen environments, guided by natural language instructions and a continuous
video stream. Recent advances in VLN have been driven by the powerful semantic
understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models. However, these methods
typically rely on explicit semantic memory, such as building textual cognitive
maps or storing historical visual frames. This type of method suffers from
spatial information loss, computational redundancy, and memory bloat, which
impede efficient navigation. Inspired by the implicit scene representation in
human navigation, analogous to the left brain's semantic understanding and the
right brain's spatial cognition, we propose JanusVLN, a novel VLN framework
featuring a dual implicit neural memory that models spatial-geometric and
visual-semantic memory as separate, compact, and fixed-size neural
representations. This framework first extends the MLLM to incorporate 3D prior
knowledge from the spatial-geometric encoder, thereby enhancing the spatial
reasoning capabilities of models based solely on RGB input. Then, the
historical key-value caches from the spatial-geometric and visual-semantic
encoders are constructed into a dual implicit memory. By retaining only the KVs
of tokens in the initial and sliding window, redundant computation is avoided,
enabling efficient incremental updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
JanusVLN outperforms over 20 recent methods to achieve SOTA performance. For
example, the success rate improves by 10.5-35.5 compared to methods using
multiple data types as input and by 3.6-10.8 compared to methods using more RGB
training data. This indicates that the proposed dual implicit neural memory, as
a novel paradigm, explores promising new directions for future VLN research.

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently been attracting significant
attention for their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, but
semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods for SNN-based models remain
underexplored compared to those for artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this
paper, we introduce SpikeMatch, the first SSL framework for SNNs that leverages
the temporal dynamics through the leakage factor of SNNs for diverse
pseudo-labeling within a co-training framework. By utilizing agreement among
multiple predictions from a single SNN, SpikeMatch generates reliable
pseudo-labels from weakly-augmented unlabeled samples to train on
strongly-augmented ones, effectively mitigating confirmation bias by capturing
discriminative features with limited labels. Experiments show that SpikeMatch
outperforms existing SSL methods adapted to SNN backbones across various
standard benchmarks.

Result: 在DataComp子集上，GS编码器实现了有意义的零样本ImageNet-1K性能，同时将输入相对于像素压缩3-20倍；虽然准确性目前落后于RGB编码器，但证明了2DGS作为可行多模态基质的潜力。

Conclusion: 2DGS被确立为可行的多模态基质，识别了架构瓶颈，为开发既语义强大又传输高效的边缘云学习表示开辟了道路。

Abstract: Modern vision language pipelines are driven by RGB vision encoders trained on
massive image text corpora. While these pipelines have enabled impressive zero
shot capabilities and strong transfer across tasks, they still inherit two
structural inefficiencies from the pixel domain: (i) transmitting dense RGB
images from edge devices to the cloud is energy intensive and costly, and (ii)
patch based tokenization explodes sequence length, stressing attention budgets
and context limits. We explore 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) as an alternative
visual substrate for alignment: a compact, spatially adaptive representation
that parameterizes images by a set of colored anisotropic Gaussians. We develop
a scalable 2DGS pipeline with structured initialization, luminance aware
pruning, and batched CUDA kernels, achieving over 90x faster fitting and about
97% GPU utilization compared to prior implementations. We further adapt
contrastive language image pretraining (CLIP) to 2DGS by reusing a frozen
RGB-based transformer backbone with a lightweight splat aware input stem and a
perceiver resampler, training only about 7% of the total parameters. On large
DataComp subsets, GS encoders yield meaningful zero shot ImageNet-1K
performance while compressing inputs 3 to 20x relative to pixels. While
accuracy currently trails RGB encoders, our results establish 2DGS as a viable
multimodal substrate, pinpoint architectural bottlenecks, and open a path
toward representations that are both semantically powerful and transmission
efficient for edge cloud learning.

TL;DR: LongLive是一个用于实时交互式长视频生成的帧级自回归框架，通过KV重缓存机制、流式长调优和帧级注意力汇聚等关键技术，在保持高质量的同时实现了高效的长视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频生成在效率和质量上的挑战：扩散模型效率低，因果注意力AR模型在长视频上质量下降，以及交互式生成中视觉一致性和语义连贯性的需求。

Method: 采用因果帧级自回归设计，集成KV重缓存机制处理提示词切换，流式长调优实现长视频训练，短窗口注意力配合帧级注意力汇聚保持长程一致性。

Result: 仅用32GPU天将13亿参数短片段模型微调至分钟级生成，在单H100 GPU上达到20.7FPS，支持240秒视频生成，INT8量化推理质量损失极小。

Conclusion: LongLive框架成功解决了长视频生成在效率、质量和交互性方面的核心挑战，为实时动态内容创作提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present LongLive, a frame-level autoregressive (AR) framework for
real-time and interactive long video generation. Long video generation presents
challenges in both efficiency and quality. Diffusion and Diffusion-Forcing
models can produce high-quality videos but suffer from low efficiency due to
bidirectional attention. Causal attention AR models support KV caching for
faster inference, but often degrade in quality on long videos due to memory
challenges during long-video training. In addition, beyond static prompt-based
generation, interactive capabilities, such as streaming prompt inputs, are
critical for dynamic content creation, enabling users to guide narratives in
real time. This interactive requirement significantly increases complexity,
especially in ensuring visual consistency and semantic coherence during prompt
transitions. To address these challenges, LongLive adopts a causal, frame-level
AR design that integrates a KV-recache mechanism that refreshes cached states
with new prompts for smooth, adherent switches; streaming long tuning to enable
long video training and to align training and inference (train-long-test-long);
and short window attention paired with a frame-level attention sink, shorten as
frame sink, preserving long-range consistency while enabling faster generation.
With these key designs, LongLive fine-tunes a 1.3B-parameter short-clip model
to minute-long generation in just 32 GPU-days. At inference, LongLive sustains
20.7 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100, achieves strong performance on VBench in both
short and long videos. LongLive supports up to 240-second videos on a single
H100 GPU. LongLive further supports INT8-quantized inference with only marginal
quality loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPARK是一个高效的协同进化框架，通过回收RLVR中的rollouts和正确性数据来同时训练模型作为生成式奖励模型，消除对独立奖励模型和人类偏好数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLHF成本高和奖励-策略不匹配问题，以及RLVR浪费监督信息的问题，通过协同进化框架实现更高效的强化学习。

Method: 基于RLVR构建，回收rollouts和正确性数据，使用点式奖励评分、成对比较和反思条件评估等混合目标训练模型作为生成式奖励模型。

Result: SPARK在多个LLM和LVLM模型上取得显著性能提升，如SPARK-VL-7B在7个推理基准上平均提升9.7%，在2个奖励基准上提升12.1%，在8个通用基准上提升1.5%。

Conclusion: SPARK创建了正向协同进化循环，支持无需外部奖励模型的自反思测试时扩展，展示了鲁棒性和广泛泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL
with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback
(RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential
reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still
wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each
update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And
Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable
method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness
data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the
model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix
of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and
evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to
evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a
separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a
positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better
policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further
refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via
self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We
show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM
models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For
example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks,
12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the
baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.

*Alexandre Lopes,Roberto Souza,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CCNeXt的新型自监督卷积深度估计方法，在保持计算效率的同时超越了现有CNN和ViT模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度估计在机器人、自动驾驶和增强现实中至关重要，但这些场景通常受计算能力限制。立体图像对提供了一种有效的深度估计解决方案，但获取可靠的真实深度数据困难，因此需要自监督技术。

Method: CCNeXt架构采用现代CNN特征提取器，在编码器中引入新颖的窗口化极线交叉注意力模块，并全面重新设计了深度估计解码器。

Result: 在KITTI Eigen Split测试数据上达到竞争性指标，比当前最佳模型快10.18倍，在KITTI Eigen Split改进真实数据和Driving Stereo数据集的所有指标上均达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: CCNeXt在深度估计任务中实现了性能与计算效率的良好平衡，为实际应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Depth Estimation plays a crucial role in recent applications in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality. These scenarios commonly operate
under constraints imposed by computational power. Stereo image pairs offer an
effective solution for depth estimation since it only needs to estimate the
disparity of pixels in image pairs to determine the depth in a known rectified
system. Due to the difficulty in acquiring reliable ground-truth depth data
across diverse scenarios, self-supervised techniques emerge as a solution,
particularly when large unlabeled datasets are available. We propose a novel
self-supervised convolutional approach that outperforms existing
state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers
(ViTs) while balancing computational cost. The proposed CCNeXt architecture
employs a modern CNN feature extractor with a novel windowed epipolar
cross-attention module in the encoder, complemented by a comprehensive redesign
of the depth estimation decoder. Our experiments demonstrate that CCNeXt
achieves competitive metrics on the KITTI Eigen Split test data while being
10.18$\times$ faster than the current best model and achieves state-of-the-art
results in all metrics in the KITTI Eigen Split Improved Ground Truth and
Driving Stereo datasets when compared to recently proposed techniques. To

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT是一个基于统一建模语言的结构化推理和规划框架，通过UML类图和活动图生成符号化的思维链和可执行动作计划，在杂乱房间清洁任务中优于非结构化CoT。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链提示依赖非结构化文本，在具身任务中可解释性和可执行性受限；现有结构化CoT方法仅建模低阶关系，缺乏继承、行为抽象等构造，也没有标准化语义用于顺序或条件规划。

Method: 使用UML类图捕捉组合对象语义，活动图建模过程控制流；采用三阶段训练管道，结合监督微调和GRPO策略优化，包括从仅答案数据中学习奖励。

Result: 在MRoom-30k基准测试中，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划连贯性和执行成功率方面优于非结构化CoT方法。

Conclusion: UML作为一种更具表达力和可操作性的结构化推理形式化方法，能够有效提升推理和规划性能。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

TL;DR: Labeling Copilot是首个用于计算机视觉的数据策展深度研究代理，通过三个核心能力解决高质量领域特定数据集构建的瓶颈问题：校准发现、可控合成和共识标注。


<details>

Motivation: 构建高质量、领域特定的数据集是部署稳健视觉系统的主要瓶颈，需要在数据质量、多样性和成本之间进行复杂权衡。

Method: 使用大型多模态语言模型作为中央编排代理，通过多步推理执行三个核心能力：校准发现从大型存储库中获取相关数据；可控合成生成罕见场景的新数据；共识标注通过非极大值抑制和投票机制协调多个基础模型产生准确标签。

Result: 在COCO数据集上平均每张图像产生14.2个候选提案，最终标注mAP达到37.1%；在Open Images数据集上发现903个新边界框类别；校准发现在1000万样本规模上比替代方案计算效率高40倍。

Conclusion: 具有优化、可扩展工具的代理工作流程为构建工业规模数据集提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Curating high-quality, domain-specific datasets is a major bottleneck for
deploying robust vision systems, requiring complex trade-offs between data
quality, diversity, and cost when researching vast, unlabeled data lakes. We
introduce Labeling Copilot, the first data curation deep research agent for
computer vision. A central orchestrator agent, powered by a large multimodal
language model, uses multi-step reasoning to execute specialized tools across
three core capabilities: (1) Calibrated Discovery sources relevant,
in-distribution data from large repositories; (2) Controllable Synthesis
generates novel data for rare scenarios with robust filtering; and (3)
Consensus Annotation produces accurate labels by orchestrating multiple
foundation models via a novel consensus mechanism incorporating non-maximum
suppression and voting. Our large-scale validation proves the effectiveness of
Labeling Copilot's components. The Consensus Annotation module excels at object
discovery: on the dense COCO dataset, it averages 14.2 candidate proposals per
image-nearly double the 7.4 ground-truth objects-achieving a final annotation
mAP of 37.1%. On the web-scale Open Images dataset, it navigated extreme class
imbalance to discover 903 new bounding box categories, expanding its capability
to over 1500 total. Concurrently, our Calibrated Discovery tool, tested at a
10-million sample scale, features an active learning strategy that is up to 40x
more computationally efficient than alternatives with equivalent sample
efficiency. These experiments validate that an agentic workflow with optimized,
scalable tools provides a robust foundation for curating industrial-scale
datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本图像分类中标记样本有限的问题，避免现有方法需要模型微调或外部信息源的复杂性。

Method: 使用IP-Adapter进行图像到图像转换，引入扩展的无分类器引导方案、基于类别相似性的采样策略，以及无需微调的简单流程。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上达到最先进或可比性能，特别在细粒度分类任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过正负引导的双重图像提示生成类别判别特征的方法有效，无需生成模型适配或外部工具依赖。

Abstract: Few-shot image classification remains challenging due to the limited
availability of labeled examples. Recent approaches have explored generating
synthetic training data using text-to-image diffusion models, but often require
extensive model fine-tuning or external information sources. We present a novel
training-free approach, called DIPSY, that leverages IP-Adapter for
image-to-image translation to generate highly discriminative synthetic images
using only the available few-shot examples. DIPSY introduces three key
innovations: (1) an extended classifier-free guidance scheme that enables
independent control over positive and negative image conditioning; (2) a class
similarity-based sampling strategy that identifies effective contrastive
examples; and (3) a simple yet effective pipeline that requires no model
fine-tuning or external captioning and filtering. Experiments across ten
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art or
comparable performance, while eliminating the need for generative model
adaptation or reliance on external tools for caption generation and image
filtering. Our results highlight the effectiveness of leveraging dual image
prompting with positive-negative guidance for generating class-discriminative
features, particularly for fine-grained classification tasks.

Motivation: 自回归变换器在视觉生成中表现出色，但存在架构效率问题。本文旨在通过建立VAR与扩散模型的理论联系，将扩散模型的迭代精炼等优势引入VAR。

Method: 提出SRDD框架，证明VAR在马尔可夫注意力掩码下等价于离散扩散模型，并基于此将扩散模型的迭代精炼等特性整合到VAR架构中。

Result: 在多个数据集上，该方法实现了更快的收敛速度、更低的推理成本、改进的零样本重建能力，并在效率和生成质量上获得一致提升。

Conclusion: 通过建立VAR与扩散模型的数学等价性，成功将扩散模型的优势引入自回归变换器，为视觉生成提供了更高效和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) transformers have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
visual generation, largely due to their scalability, computational efficiency
and unified architecture with language and vision. Among them, next scale
prediction Visual Autoregressive Generation (VAR) has recently demonstrated
remarkable performance, even surpassing diffusion-based models. In this work,
we revisit VAR and uncover a theoretical insight: when equipped with a
Markovian attention mask, VAR is mathematically equivalent to a discrete
diffusion. We term this reinterpretation as Scalable Visual Refinement with
Discrete Diffusion (SRDD), establishing a principled bridge between AR
transformers and diffusion models. Leveraging this new perspective, we show how
one can directly import the advantages of diffusion such as iterative
refinement and reduce architectural inefficiencies into VAR, yielding faster
convergence, lower inference cost, and improved zero-shot reconstruction.
Across multiple datasets, we show that the diffusion based perspective of VAR
leads to consistent gains in efficiency and generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERMAN方法通过利用LLM生成层次化文本描述符，增强CLIP在类增量学习中的语义空间表示，解决了现有方法忽视视觉概念层次性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP类增量学习方法使用简单模板（如"a photo of a [CLASS]"）忽略了视觉概念的层次性，且仅使用最后一层特征表示，忽视了早期层的层次信息。

Method: 利用LLM递归生成判别性文本描述符，将这些描述符匹配到语义层次的不同层级，并根据任务需求自适应路由，实现精确区分并减轻灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法持续实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: HERMAN方法通过层次化表示匹配有效提升了CLIP在类增量学习中的性能，解决了层次性表示不足的问题。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
"a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: DeeptraceReward是首个细粒度、时空感知的基准数据集，用于标注人类感知的AI生成视频伪影痕迹，包含4.3K详细标注，训练的多模态奖励模型在伪影识别、定位和解释方面优于GPT-5 34.7%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了人类是否能检测AI生成视频中的深度伪造痕迹这一关键维度，即揭示视频为机器生成的时空基础视觉伪影。

Method: 构建包含4.3K详细标注的数据集，每个标注提供自然语言解释、边界框区域定位和精确时间戳，训练多模态语言模型作为奖励模型来模仿人类判断和定位。

Result: 7B奖励模型在DeeptraceReward上平均表现优于GPT-5 34.7%，发现一致的难度梯度：二元真假分类比细粒度伪影检测容易，后者从自然语言解释到空间定位再到时间标注性能逐渐下降。

Conclusion: 通过突出人类感知的深度伪造痕迹，DeeptraceReward为社会意识和可信视频生成提供了严格的测试平台和训练信号。

Abstract: Can humans identify AI-generated (fake) videos and provide grounded reasons?
While video generation models have advanced rapidly, a critical dimension --
whether humans can detect deepfake traces within a generated video, i.e.,
spatiotemporal grounded visual artifacts that reveal a video as machine
generated -- has been largely overlooked. We introduce DeeptraceReward, the
first fine-grained, spatially- and temporally- aware benchmark that annotates
human-perceived fake traces for video generation reward. The dataset comprises
4.3K detailed annotations across 3.3K high-quality generated videos. Each
annotation provides a natural-language explanation, pinpoints a bounding-box
region containing the perceived trace, and marks precise onset and offset
timestamps. We consolidate these annotations into 9 major categories of
deepfake traces that lead humans to identify a video as AI-generated, and train
multimodal language models (LMs) as reward models to mimic human judgments and
localizations. On DeeptraceReward, our 7B reward model outperforms GPT-5 by
34.7% on average across fake clue identification, grounding, and explanation.
Interestingly, we observe a consistent difficulty gradient: binary fake v.s.
real classification is substantially easier than fine-grained deepfake trace
detection; within the latter, performance degrades from natural language
explanations (easiest), to spatial grounding, to temporal labeling (hardest).
By foregrounding human-perceived deepfake traces, DeeptraceReward provides a
rigorous testbed and training signal for socially aware and trustworthy video
generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前图像描述模型依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，容易过拟合特定答案，缺乏泛化性和多样性。需要克服监督微调的局限性

Method: 采用两阶段解耦管道：LVLM生成描述，无视觉LLM基于描述回答多选题，用答案准确率作为强化学习的奖励信号

Result: 在12个基准测试中取得显著提升，在Prism评估框架中性能接近Qwen2.5-VL-72B，平均超出基线8.4%

Conclusion: CapRL是首个将RLVR应用于主观图像描述任务的研究，证明该方法能有效提升描述质量，为图像描述训练提供了新范式

Abstract: Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic
domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable
data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to
models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality
and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the
limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning.
A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the
inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce
Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that
redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should
enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the
corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM
generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a
separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on
that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image
captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple
settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B
results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism
Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable
to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

Result: 在零样本参考图像和视频分割基准测试中，始终优于先前方法，无需微调或额外组件

Conclusion: 扩散变换器的注意力特征可直接用于下游任务，通过适当的注意力处理策略可实现强大的零样本性能

Abstract: Most existing approaches to referring segmentation achieve strong performance
only through fine-tuning or by composing multiple pre-trained models, often at
the cost of additional training and architectural modifications. Meanwhile,
large-scale generative diffusion models encode rich semantic information,
making them attractive as general-purpose feature extractors. In this work, we
introduce a new method that directly exploits features, attention scores, from
diffusion transformers for downstream tasks, requiring neither architectural
modifications nor additional training. To systematically evaluate these
features, we extend benchmarks with vision-language grounding tasks spanning
both images and videos. Our key insight is that stop words act as attention
magnets: they accumulate surplus attention and can be filtered to reduce noise.
Moreover, we identify global attention sinks (GAS) emerging in deeper layers
and show that they can be safely suppressed or redirected onto auxiliary
tokens, leading to sharper and more accurate grounding maps. We further propose
an attention redistribution strategy, where appended stop words partition
background activations into smaller clusters, yielding sharper and more
localized heatmaps. Building on these findings, we develop RefAM, a simple
training-free grounding framework that combines cross-attention maps, GAS
handling, and redistribution. Across zero-shot referring image and video
segmentation benchmarks, our approach consistently outperforms prior methods,
establishing a new state of the art without fine-tuning or additional
components.

Abstract: The benefit claims of a product is a critical driver of consumers' purchase
behavior. Creating product claims is an intense task that requires substantial
time and funding. We have developed the $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ web
application to accelerate claim creations using in-context learning and
fine-tuning of large language models (LLM). $\textbf{Claim Advisor}$ was
designed to disrupt the speed and economics of claim search, generation,
optimization, and simulation. It has three functions: (1) semantically
searching and identifying existing claims and/or visuals that resonate with the
voice of consumers; (2) generating and/or optimizing claims based on a product

created claims using simulations via synthetic consumers. Applications in a
consumer packaged goods (CPG) company have shown very promising results. We
believe that this capability is broadly useful and applicable across product
categories and industries. We share our learning to encourage the research and
application of generative AI in different industries.

### [270] [Towards mitigating information leakage when evaluating safety monitors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21344)
*Gerard Boxo,Aman Neelappa,Shivam Raval*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个系统框架来评估白盒监控器检测真实模型行为的能力，而非表面上的诱导伪影。通过欺骗检测案例研究，识别了两种导致监控器性能虚高的泄漏类型，并提出了三种缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 训练和评估白盒监控器需要展示目标行为的响应样本，但用于诱导行为的信息会泄漏到监控器数据中，虚增其有效性。需要区分监控器检测真实行为还是仅仅识别诱导伪影。

Method: 提出三种评估策略：内容过滤（从输入中移除欺骗相关文本）、分数过滤（仅聚合任务相关token）、提示蒸馏微调模型有机体（训练模型无需显式提示即可展示欺骗行为）。

Result: 实验发现：内容过滤可平滑移除诱导信号，使探针AUROC降低30%；分数过滤使AUROC降低15%；微调模型有机体改善了监控器评估但使其性能降低达40%，即使重新训练也是如此。

Conclusion: 识别了诱导泄漏和推理泄漏两种导致监控器性能虚高的泄漏形式，提出的缓解策略能更准确地评估监控器检测真实模型行为的能力。

Abstract: White box monitors that analyze model internals offer promising advantages
for detecting potentially harmful behaviors in large language models, including
lower computational costs and integration into layered defense systems.However,
training and evaluating these monitors requires response exemplars that exhibit
the target behaviors, typically elicited through prompting or fine-tuning. This
presents a challenge when the information used to elicit behaviors inevitably
leaks into the data that monitors ingest, inflating their effectiveness. We
present a systematic framework for evaluating a monitor's performance in terms
of its ability to detect genuine model behavior rather than superficial
elicitation artifacts. Furthermore, we propose three novel strategies to
evaluate the monitor: content filtering (removing deception-related text from
inputs), score filtering (aggregating only over task-relevant tokens), and
prompt distilled fine-tuned model organisms (models trained to exhibit
deceptive behavior without explicit prompting). Using deception detection as a
representative case study, we identify two forms of leakage that inflate
monitor performance: elicitation leakage from prompts that explicitly request
harmful behavior, and reasoning leakage from models that verbalize their
deceptive actions. Through experiments on multiple deception benchmarks, we
apply our proposed mitigation strategies and measure performance retention. Our
evaluation of the monitors reveal three crucial findings: (1) Content filtering
is a good mitigation strategy that allows for a smooth removal of elicitation
signal and can decrease probe AUROC by 30\% (2) Score filtering was found to
reduce AUROC by 15\% but is not as straightforward to attribute to (3) A
finetuned model organism improves monitor evaluations but reduces their
performance by upto 40\%, even when re-trained.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了UltraHorizon基准测试，用于评估自主智能体在长视野、部分可观测场景下的持续推理、规划、记忆管理和工具使用能力，发现LLM智能体在这些复杂任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注短视野、完全可观测任务，而现实世界中的关键任务（如软件开发、投资、科学发现）往往需要长视野和部分可观测环境下的持续能力，现有基准测试很少捕捉这些挑战。

Method: 通过探索作为统一任务，在三个不同环境中验证核心能力，智能体需要在长视野发现任务中通过持续推理、规划、记忆和工具管理来迭代发现隐藏规则。

Result: 在最重规模设置下，轨迹平均超过20万token和400+工具调用，标准配置下也超过3.5万token和60+工具调用。LLM智能体在这些设置中持续表现不佳，而人类参与者得分更高。

Conclusion: 发现了智能体在长视野能力上的持续差距，简单扩展方法在任务中失败，识别了八种错误类型，归因于上下文锁定和功能基础能力差距两个主要原因。

Abstract: Autonomous agents have recently achieved remarkable progress across diverse
domains, yet most evaluations focus on short-horizon, fully observable tasks.
In contrast, many critical real-world tasks, such as large-scale software
development, commercial investment, and scientific discovery, unfold in
long-horizon and partially observable scenarios where success hinges on
sustained reasoning, planning, memory management, and tool use. Existing
benchmarks rarely capture these long-horizon challenges, leaving a gap in
systematic evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{UltraHorizon} a
novel benchmark that measures the foundational capabilities essential for
complex real-world challenges. We use exploration as a unifying task across
three distinct environments to validate these core competencies. Agents are
designed in long-horizon discovery tasks where they must iteratively uncover
hidden rules through sustained reasoning, planning, memory and tools
management, and interaction with environments. Under the heaviest scale
setting, trajectories average \textbf{200k+} tokens and \textbf{400+} tool
calls, whereas in standard configurations they still exceed \textbf{35k} tokens
and involve more than \textbf{60} tool calls on average. Our extensive
experiments reveal that LLM-agents consistently underperform in these settings,
whereas human participants achieve higher scores, underscoring a persistent gap
in agents' long-horizon abilities. We also observe that simple scaling fails in
our task. To better illustrate the failure of agents, we conduct an in-depth
analysis of collected trajectories. We identify eight types of errors and
attribute them to two primary causes: in-context locking and functional
fundamental capability gaps.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RISK是一个用于电子商务风险管理的新型GUI代理框架，包含数据集、基准测试和强化微调框架，在复杂多步网页交互任务中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统网页抓取方法和现有GUI代理无法处理电子商务风险管理所需的多样化、深度嵌入的网页数据，这些代理通常仅限于单步任务，缺乏管理动态交互内容的能力。

Method: RISK框架包含三个组件：RISK-Data数据集（8,492个单步和2,386个多步交互轨迹）、RISK-Bench基准测试（802个单步和320个多步轨迹）、RISK-R1强化微调框架（考虑输出格式、单步级、多步级和任务级四个方面的奖励机制）。

Result: 实验显示RISK-R1在离线单步任务中提升6.8%，离线多步任务中提升8.8%，在线评估中达到70.5%的最高任务成功率。

Conclusion: RISK为自动化复杂网页交互提供了一个可扩展的领域特定解决方案，推进了电子商务风险管理的技术水平。

Abstract: E-commerce risk management requires aggregating diverse, deeply embedded web
data through multi-step, stateful interactions, which traditional scraping
methods and most existing Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents cannot handle.
These agents are typically limited to single-step tasks and lack the ability to
manage dynamic, interactive content critical for effective risk assessment. To
address this challenge, we introduce RISK, a novel framework designed to build
and deploy GUI agents for this domain. RISK integrates three components: (1)
RISK-Data, a dataset of 8,492 single-step and 2,386 multi-step interaction
trajectories, collected through a high-fidelity browser framework and a
meticulous data curation process; (2) RISK-Bench, a benchmark with 802
single-step and 320 multi-step trajectories across three difficulty levels for
standardized evaluation; and (3) RISK-R1, a R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning
framework considering four aspects: (i) Output Format: Updated format reward to
enhance output syntactic correctness and task comprehension, (ii) Single-step
Level: Stepwise accuracy reward to provide granular feedback during early
training stages, (iii) Multi-step Level: Process reweight to emphasize critical
later steps in interaction sequences, and (iv) Task Level: Level reweight to
focus on tasks of varying difficulty. Experiments show that RISK-R1 outperforms
existing baselines, achieving a 6.8% improvement in offline single-step and an
8.8% improvement in offline multi-step. Moreover, it attains a top task success
rate of 70.5% in online evaluation. RISK provides a scalable, domain-specific
solution for automating complex web interactions, advancing the state of the
art in e-commerce risk management.

TL;DR: 本文通过大规模实证研究评估了多种模型融合技术，发现模型融合能够有效调节推理精度与计算成本的权衡，甚至在某些情况下实现帕累托改进，为创建具有特定推理能力的大语言模型提供了实用指南。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中对可调节推理能力的大语言模型需求日益增长，需要能够高效产生平衡推理深度和计算成本的模型谱系的方法。

Method: 进行大规模实证研究，评估多种模型融合技术，系统性地改变融合强度来构建精度-效率曲线，分析可调节性能空间。

Result: 发现模型融合提供了有效且可控的方法来校准推理精度与token效率之间的权衡，即使父模型具有高度不同的权重空间。识别出帕累托改进的实例，其中融合模型比其父模型之一具有更高的精度和更低的token消耗。

Conclusion: 模型融合是创建具有特定推理配置文件的LLM的有效方法，为满足多样化应用需求提供了实用指南。

Abstract: The growing demand for large language models (LLMs) with tunable reasoning
capabilities in many real-world applications highlights a critical need for
methods that can efficiently produce a spectrum of models balancing reasoning
depth and computational cost. Model merging has emerged as a promising,
training-free technique to address this challenge by arithmetically combining
the weights of a general-purpose model with a specialized reasoning model.
While various merging techniques exist, their potential to create a spectrum of
models with fine-grained control over reasoning abilities remains largely
unexplored. This work presents a large-scale empirical study evaluating a range
of model merging techniques across multiple reasoning benchmarks. We
systematically vary merging strengths to construct accuracy-efficiency curves,
providing the first comprehensive view of the tunable performance landscape.
Our findings reveal that model merging offers an effective and controllable
method for calibrating the trade-off between reasoning accuracy and token
efficiency, even when parent models have highly divergent weight spaces.
Crucially, we identify instances of Pareto Improvement, where a merged model
achieves both higher accuracy and lower token consumption than one of its
parents. Our study provides the first comprehensive analysis of this tunable
space, offering practical guidelines for creating LLMs with specific reasoning
profiles to meet diverse application demands.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: A2R是一个非对称两阶段推理框架，通过"探索器"并行生成多个解决方案，再由"合成器"整合优化，显著提升大语言模型在复杂任务中的表现，同时降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在单次推理中的表现与其潜在能力存在显著差距，需要通过多路径推理来充分挖掘模型潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段推理：探索器模型并行生成多个候选解决方案，合成器模型整合这些参考进行精细化推理。

Result: Qwen3-8B-distill模型性能提升75%；A2R-Efficient变体（4B探索器+8B合成器）超越32B单体模型性能，成本降低30%。

Conclusion: A2R不仅是性能提升框架，更是实际应用中高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models have achieved significant improvements in
complex task-solving capabilities by allocating more computation at the
inference stage with a "thinking longer" paradigm. Even as the foundational
reasoning capabilities of models advance rapidly, the persistent gap between a
model's performance in a single attempt and its latent potential, often
revealed only across multiple solution paths, starkly highlights the disparity
between its realized and inherent capabilities. To address this, we present
A2R, an Asymmetric Two-Stage Reasoning framework designed to explicitly bridge
the gap between a model's potential and its actual performance. In this
framework, an "explorer" model first generates potential solutions in parallel
through repeated sampling. Subsequently,a "synthesizer" model integrates these
references for a more refined, second stage of reasoning. This two-stage
process allows computation to be scaled orthogonally to existing sequential
methods. Our work makes two key innovations: First, we present A2R as a
plug-and-play parallel reasoning framework that explicitly enhances a model's
capabilities on complex questions. For example, using our framework, the
Qwen3-8B-distill model achieves a 75% performance improvement compared to its
self-consistency baseline. Second, through a systematic analysis of the
explorer and synthesizer roles, we identify an effective asymmetric scaling
paradigm. This insight leads to A2R-Efficient, a "small-to-big" variant that
combines a Qwen3-4B explorer with a Qwen3-8B synthesizer. This configuration
surpasses the average performance of a monolithic Qwen3-32B model at a nearly
30% lower cost. Collectively, these results show that A2R is not only a
performance-boosting framework but also an efficient and practical solution for
real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用多模态大模型缺乏医疗专业知识，容易产生不确定或幻觉回答；知识蒸馏难以捕捉放射学和药理学等领域的专业知识；大规模医疗数据的持续预训练计算成本高。

Method: 结合高质量通用和医疗多模态数据，提出五维质量评估框架筛选数据集；采用低到高图像分辨率和多模态序列打包提高训练效率；使用三阶段监督微调过程提取复杂医疗任务知识。

Result: 在MedEvalKit框架评估中，InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B优于Qwen2.5VL-3B，InfiMed-Foundation-4B超越HuatuoGPT-V-7B和MedGemma-27B-IT，在医疗视觉问答和诊断任务中表现卓越。

Conclusion: 通过解决数据质量、训练效率和领域专业知识提取等关键挑战，为医疗领域提供更可靠有效的AI驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical
tasks. Evaluated on the MedEvalKit framework, InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B
outperforms Qwen2.5VL-3B, while InfiMed-Foundation-4B surpasses HuatuoGPT-V-7B
and MedGemma-27B-IT, demonstrating superior performance in medical visual
question answering and diagnostic tasks. By addressing key challenges in data
quality, training efficiency, and domain-specific knowledge extraction, our
work paves the way for more reliable and effective AI-driven solutions in
healthcare. InfiMed-Foundation-4B model is available at

Motivation: 受人类认知的双过程理论启发，旨在模拟人类快速直觉思维和慢速审慎思维的动态整合，提高LLM在复杂知识密集型推理任务中的效率和准确性。

Method: 采用多智能体设计：首先使用快速思维智能体（系统1）生成初步答案，如果检测到不确定性，则触发包含规划、假设生成、检索、信息整合和决策等专门智能体的系统2推理管道。

Result: 使用LLaMA 3模型的实验表明，PRIME使开源LLM在多跳和知识基础推理基准测试中能够与GPT-4、GPT-4o等最先进闭源模型竞争。

Conclusion: PRIME为改进LLM在需要复杂知识密集型推理的领域提供了一个可扩展的解决方案，成功模拟了人类认知过程并提升了推理性能。

Abstract: Inspired by the dual-process theory of human cognition from \textit{Thinking,
Fast and Slow}, we introduce \textbf{PRIME} (Planning and Retrieval-Integrated
Memory for Enhanced Reasoning), a multi-agent reasoning framework that
dynamically integrates \textbf{System 1} (fast, intuitive thinking) and
\textbf{System 2} (slow, deliberate thinking). PRIME first employs a Quick
Thinking Agent (System 1) to generate a rapid answer; if uncertainty is
detected, it then triggers a structured System 2 reasoning pipeline composed of
specialized agents for \textit{planning}, \textit{hypothesis generation},
\textit{retrieval}, \textit{information integration}, and
\textit{decision-making}. This multi-agent design faithfully mimics human
cognitive processes and enhances both efficiency and accuracy. Experimental
results with LLaMA 3 models demonstrate that PRIME enables open-source LLMs to
perform competitively with state-of-the-art closed-source models like GPT-4 and
GPT-4o on benchmarks requiring multi-hop and knowledge-grounded reasoning. This
research establishes PRIME as a scalable solution for improving LLMs in domains
requiring complex, knowledge-intensive reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时缩放方法主要依赖输出级采样，忽视了模型架构的作用。在MoE模型中，发现改变激活专家数量能产生互补的解决方案集

Method: DES包含两个核心组件：Dynamic MoE（在推理时直接控制专家数量）和Expert Configuration Inheritance（在推理路径内保持专家数量一致，在路径间变化）

Result: 在多个MoE架构、验证器和推理基准测试中，DES可靠地优于TTS基线方法，提高了准确性和稳定性且无需额外成本

Conclusion: DES是一种实用且可扩展的架构感知TTS方法，展示了现代LLMs结构灵活性如何推进推理能力

Abstract: Test-Time Scaling (TTS) enhances the reasoning ability of large language
models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation during inference. However,
existing approaches primarily rely on output-level sampling while overlooking
the role of model architecture. In mainstream Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) LLMs, we
observe that varying the number of activated experts yields complementary
solution sets with stable accuracy, revealing a new and underexplored source of
diversity. Motivated by this observation, we propose Dynamic Experts Search
(DES), a TTS strategy that elevates expert activation into a controllable
dimension of the search space. DES integrates two key components: (1) Dynamic
MoE, which enables direct control of expert counts during inference to generate
diverse reasoning trajectories without additional cost; and (2) Expert
Configuration Inheritance, which preserves consistent expert counts within a
reasoning path while varying them across runs, thereby balancing stability and
diversity throughout the search. Extensive experiments across MoE
architectures, verifiers and reasoning benchmarks (i.e., math, code and
knowledge) demonstrate that DES reliably outperforms TTS baselines, enhancing
accuracy and stability without additional cost. These results highlight DES as
a practical and scalable form of architecture-aware TTS, illustrating how
structural flexibility in modern LLMs can advance reasoning.

TL;DR: 本文主张在机器学习评估中应考虑标注不确定性，使用概率指标直接处理分布，而不是简单的多数投票聚合，以更好地反映临床数据的真实情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床数据集标注存在不确定性（标注者分歧、置信度不均），而传统的聚合方法（如多数投票）掩盖了这种变异性，影响了模型评估的准确性。

Method: 提出使用概率指标来明确处理标注不确定性，这些指标可直接操作于分布，适用于各种标注生成过程（简单计数、主观置信度评级、概率响应模型），计算轻量且实现高效。

Result: 在医学影像基准测试的简单实验中，考虑二元标签的置信度显著影响了模型排名，表明标注不确定性对评估结果有重要影响。

Conclusion: 呼吁社区发布原始标注数据并采用不确定性感知的评估方法，使性能估计能更好地反映临床数据的真实特性。

Abstract: Clinical dataset labels are rarely certain as annotators disagree and
confidence is not uniform across cases. Typical aggregation procedures, such as
majority voting, obscure this variability. In simple experiments on medical
imaging benchmarks, accounting for the confidence in binary labels
significantly impacts model rankings. We therefore argue that machine-learning
evaluations should explicitly account for annotation uncertainty using
probabilistic metrics that directly operate on distributions. These metrics can
be applied independently of the annotations' generating process, whether
modeled by simple counting, subjective confidence ratings, or probabilistic
response models. They are also computationally lightweight, as closed-form
expressions have linear-time implementations once examples are sorted by model
score. We thus urge the community to release raw annotations for datasets and
to adopt uncertainty-aware evaluation so that performance estimates may better
reflect clinical data.

Conclusion: 利用软件工程AI代理产生的公开数据训练未来的代码编辑模型具有巨大潜力，AgentPack数据集为代码编辑模型的训练提供了更高质量的数据源。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models for code editing has typically relied on
mining commits and pull requests. The working hypothesis has been that commit
messages describe human intent in natural language, and patches to code
describe the changes that implement that intent. However, much of the
previously collected data is noisy: commit messages are terse, human-written
commits commingle several unrelated edits, and many commits come from simple,
rule-based bots.
  The recent adoption of software engineering agents changes this landscape.
Code changes co-authored by humans and agents tend to be more narrowly scoped
and focused on clearer goals. Their commit messages, generated by LLMs,
articulate intent and rationale in much greater detail. Moreover, when these
changes land in public repositories, they are implicitly filtered by humans:
maintainers discard low-quality commits to their projects.
  We present AgentPack, a corpus of 1.3M code edits co-authored by Claude Code,
OpenAI Codex, and Cursor Agent across public GitHub projects up to mid-August
2025. We describe the identification and curation pipeline, quantify adoption
trends of these agents, and analyze the structural properties of the edits.
Finally, we show that models fine-tuned on AgentPack can outperform models
trained on prior human-only commit corpora, highlighting the potential of using
public data from software engineering agents to train future code-editing
models.

Motivation: 现有基准测试在评估LLM驱动的代码代理时存在不足：忽视了漏洞引入的真实上下文，或采用狭窄的评估协议无法捕获功能正确性或新引入的漏洞。

Method: 设计了包含105个编码任务的SecureAgentBench基准，每个任务包含：现实任务设置（需要多文件编辑）、基于真实开源漏洞的对齐上下文、结合功能测试、漏洞检查和静态分析的综合评估。评估了三种代表性代理和三种最先进LLM。

Result: 结果显示：(1)当前代理难以生成安全代码，最佳组合仅15.2%正确且安全；(2)某些代理生成功能正确代码但仍引入漏洞；(3)添加明确安全指令未能显著改善安全编码。

Conclusion: SecureAgentBench为安全代码生成建立了严格基准，是迈向更可靠LLM软件开发的重要一步，表明需要进一步研究来提升代码代理的安全性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) powered code agents are rapidly transforming
software engineering by automating tasks such as testing, debugging, and
repairing, yet the security risks of their generated code have become a
critical concern. Existing benchmarks have offered valuable insights but remain
insufficient: they often overlook the genuine context in which vulnerabilities
were introduced or adopt narrow evaluation protocols that fail to capture
either functional correctness or newly introduced vulnerabilities. We therefore
introduce SecureAgentBench, a benchmark of 105 coding tasks designed to
rigorously evaluate code agents' capabilities in secure code generation. Each
task includes (i) realistic task settings that require multi-file edits in
large repositories, (ii) aligned contexts based on real-world open-source
vulnerabilities with precisely identified introduction points, and (iii)
comprehensive evaluation that combines functionality testing, vulnerability
checking through proof-of-concept exploits, and detection of newly introduced
vulnerabilities using static analysis. We evaluate three representative agents
(SWE-agent, OpenHands, and Aider) with three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude 3.7
Sonnet, GPT-4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1). Results show that (i) current agents
struggle to produce secure code, as even the best-performing one, SWE-agent
supported by DeepSeek-V3.1, achieves merely 15.2% correct-and-secure solutions,
(ii) some agents produce functionally correct code but still introduce
vulnerabilities, including new ones not previously recorded, and (iii) adding
explicit security instructions for agents does not significantly improve secure
coding, underscoring the need for further research. These findings establish
SecureAgentBench as a rigorous benchmark for secure code generation and a step
toward more reliable software development with LLMs.

### [282] [Library Hallucinations in LLMs: Risk Analysis Grounded in Developer Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22202)
*Lukas Twist,Jie M. Zhang,Mark Harman,Helen Yannakoudakis*

Main category: cs.SE

TL;DR: 本研究首次系统性地分析了用户提示变化对LLM生成代码中库幻觉的影响，发现即使单字符拼写错误也会在26%的任务中触发幻觉，虚假库名被接受率高达99%，时间相关提示导致84%的幻觉率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在生成代码时经常产生库幻觉（发明不存在的库），这些幻觉不仅仅是良性错误，还可能误导开发者、破坏构建过程，并暴露系统于供应链威胁。然而，人们对真实世界提示变化如何影响幻觉率知之甚少。

Method: 评估了6种不同的LLM，研究两种幻觉类型：库名幻觉（无效导入）和库成员幻觉（有效库中的无效调用）。分析了从开发者论坛提取的真实用户语言以及不同程度用户错误（单字符/多字符拼写错误和完全虚假名称/成员）对LLM幻觉率的影响。

Result: 发现系统性漏洞：库名单字符拼写错误在26%的任务中触发幻觉，虚假库名被接受率高达99%，时间相关提示导致84%的幻觉率。提示工程显示出缓解幻觉的潜力，但效果不一致且依赖具体LLM。

Conclusion: LLM对自然提示变化的脆弱性凸显了迫切需要针对库相关幻觉及其潜在利用的安全保障措施。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate code, yet they
continue to hallucinate, often inventing non-existent libraries. Such library
hallucinations are not just benign errors: they can mislead developers, break
builds, and expose systems to supply chain threats such as slopsquatting.
Despite increasing awareness of these risks, little is known about how
real-world prompt variations affect hallucination rates. Therefore, we present
the first systematic study of how user-level prompt variations impact library
hallucinations in LLM-generated code. We evaluate six diverse LLMs across two
hallucination types: library name hallucinations (invalid imports) and library
member hallucinations (invalid calls from valid libraries). We investigate how
realistic user language extracted from developer forums and how user errors of
varying degrees (one- or multi-character misspellings and completely fake
names/members) affect LLM hallucination rates. Our findings reveal systemic
vulnerabilities: one-character misspellings in library names trigger
hallucinations in up to 26% of tasks, fake library names are accepted in up to
99% of tasks, and time-related prompts lead to hallucinations in up to 84% of
tasks. Prompt engineering shows promise for mitigating hallucinations, but
remains inconsistent and LLM-dependent. Our results underscore the fragility of
LLMs to natural prompt variation and highlight the urgent need for safeguards
against library-related hallucinations and their potential exploitation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出ViF方法，通过视觉流传递和注意力重分配来缓解多智能体系统中的视觉幻觉雪球效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统在视觉语言模型驱动下存在视觉幻觉雪球效应问题，即单个智能体的幻觉会通过文本流在后续智能体中被放大。

Method: 提出ViF方法：选择具有单峰注意力峰值的视觉中继令牌，通过视觉流传递智能体间信息，并应用注意力重分配来增强视觉模式。

Result: 实验结果显示ViF方法显著减少了幻觉雪球效应，在8个基准测试中基于4种常见MAS结构和10个基础模型一致提升了性能。

Conclusion: ViF是一个轻量级即插即用的缓解范式，能有效解决多智能体系统中的视觉幻觉雪球问题。

Abstract: Multi-Agent System (MAS) powered by Visual Language Models (VLMs) enables
challenging tasks but suffers from a novel failure term, multi-agent visual
hallucination snowballing, where hallucinations are seeded in a single agent
and amplified by following ones due to the over-reliance on textual flow to
relay visual information. Through turn-, layer-, and token-wise attention
analyses, we provide detailed insights into the essence of hallucination
snowballing regarding the reduction of visual attention allocation. It leads us
to identify a subset of vision tokens with a unimodal attention peak in middle
layers that best preserve visual evidence but gradually diminish in deeper
agent turns, resulting in the visual hallucination snowballing in MAS. Thus, we
propose ViF, a lightweight, plug-and-play mitigation paradigm that relays
inter-agent messages with Visual Flow powered by the selected visual relay
tokens and applies attention reallocation to amplify this pattern. The
experiment results demonstrate that our method markedly reduces hallucination
snowballing, consistently improving the performance across eight benchmarks
based on four common MAS structures and ten base models. The source code will
be available at: https://github.com/YU-deep/ViF.git.

### [284] [SBFA: Single Sneaky Bit Flip Attack to Break Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21843)
*Jingkai Guo,Chaitali Chakrabarti,Deliang Fan*

Main category: cs.CR

TL;DR: SBFA是一种新型位翻转攻击方法，仅需翻转单个比特位就能使大语言模型性能崩溃，同时保持扰动值在良性层权重分布范围内。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位翻转攻击方法通常分别针对整数或浮点模型，缺乏灵活性。在浮点模型中，随机位翻转常导致参数变为极端值，不够隐蔽且易引发数值运行时错误。

Method: 通过定义的参数敏感度指标ImpactScore进行迭代搜索和排序，该指标结合了梯度敏感度和受良性层权重分布约束的扰动范围。还提出了轻量级SKIP搜索算法来大幅降低搜索复杂度。

Result: 在Qwen、LLaMA和Gemma模型上，仅翻转单个比特位就能在BF16和INT8数据格式下成功将MMLU和SST-2的准确率降至随机水平以下。

Conclusion: 在数十亿参数中翻转单个比特位就能实现攻击，揭示了SOTA LLM模型存在严重的安全隐患。

Abstract: Model integrity of Large language models (LLMs) has become a pressing
security concern with their massive online deployment. Prior Bit-Flip Attacks
(BFAs) -- a class of popular AI weight memory fault-injection techniques -- can
severely compromise Deep Neural Networks (DNNs): as few as tens of bit flips
can degrade accuracy toward random guessing. Recent studies extend BFAs to LLMs
and reveal that, despite the intuition of better robustness from modularity and
redundancy, only a handful of adversarial bit flips can also cause LLMs'
catastrophic accuracy degradation. However, existing BFA methods typically
focus on either integer or floating-point models separately, limiting attack
flexibility. Moreover, in floating-point models, random bit flips often cause
perturbed parameters to extreme values (e.g., flipping in exponent bit), making
it not stealthy and leading to numerical runtime error (e.g., invalid tensor
values (NaN/Inf)). In this work, for the first time, we propose SBFA (Sneaky
Bit-Flip Attack), which collapses LLM performance with only one single bit flip
while keeping perturbed values within benign layer-wise weight distribution. It
is achieved through iterative searching and ranking through our defined
parameter sensitivity metric, ImpactScore, which combines gradient sensitivity
and perturbation range constrained by the benign layer-wise weight
distribution. A novel lightweight SKIP searching algorithm is also proposed to
greatly reduce searching complexity, which leads to successful SBFA searching
taking only tens of minutes for SOTA LLMs. Across Qwen, LLaMA, and Gemma
models, with only one single bit flip, SBFA successfully degrades accuracy to
below random levels on MMLU and SST-2 in both BF16 and INT8 data formats.
Remarkably, flipping a single bit out of billions of parameters reveals a
severe security concern of SOTA LLM models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs面临系统提示词泄露风险，现有防御策略主要基于禁用模型重复上下文，但无法应对新型攻击技术。

Method: 提出SysVec方法，将系统提示词编码为内部表示向量而非原始文本，从根本上避免泄露风险。

Result: 实验证明SysVec能有效缓解提示词泄露攻击，保持LLM功能完整性，并改善长上下文场景下的遗忘问题。

Conclusion: SysVec不仅增强了安全性，还提升了模型的通用指令遵循能力，为系统提示词保护提供了根本解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted across various
applications, leveraging customized system prompts for diverse tasks. Facing
potential system prompt leakage risks, model developers have implemented
strategies to prevent leakage, primarily by disabling LLMs from repeating their
context when encountering known attack patterns. However, it remains vulnerable
to new and unforeseen prompt-leaking techniques. In this paper, we first
introduce a simple yet effective prompt leaking attack to reveal such risks.
Our attack is capable of extracting system prompts from various LLM-based
application, even from SOTA LLM models such as GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Our
findings further inspire us to search for a fundamental solution to the
problems by having no system prompt in the context. To this end, we propose
SysVec, a novel method that encodes system prompts as internal representation
vectors rather than raw text. By doing so, SysVec minimizes the risk of
unauthorized disclosure while preserving the LLM's core language capabilities.
Remarkably, this approach not only enhances security but also improves the
model's general instruction-following abilities. Experimental results
demonstrate that SysVec effectively mitigates prompt leakage attacks, preserves
the LLM's functional integrity, and helps alleviate the forgetting issue in
long-context scenarios.

Motivation: 将后处理水印方案集成到扩散生成过程中，提高水印的鲁棒性，同时保持生成图像的质量和多样性。

Method: 使用现成水印解码器的梯度来引导扩散过程，梯度计算包含多种图像增强，增强对未训练攻击的鲁棒性。

Result: 在不同扩散模型和检测器上验证有效，水印引导不会显著改变给定种子和提示生成的图像，保持生成质量和多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法与变分自编码器修改技术互补，为扩散模型提供了一种有效的水印嵌入方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel watermarking method for diffusion models. It is
based on guiding the diffusion process using the gradient computed from any
off-the-shelf watermark decoder. The gradient computation encompasses different
image augmentations, increasing robustness to attacks against which the decoder
was not originally robust, without retraining or fine-tuning. Our method
effectively convert any \textit{post-hoc} watermarking scheme into an
in-generation embedding along the diffusion process. We show that this approach
is complementary to watermarking techniques modifying the variational
autoencoder at the end of the diffusion process. We validate the methods on
different diffusion models and detectors. The watermarking guidance does not
significantly alter the generated image for a given seed and prompt, preserving
both the diversity and quality of generation.

TL;DR: 本研究通过比较人类参与者与基于LLM的数字孪生在Amazon Rufus购物任务中的表现，首次量化评估了数字孪生在多轮交互中模拟人类行为的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着Agentic AI系统（如Amazon Rufus）的快速发展，传统人工评估方法难以跟上其迭代速度。需要验证LLM代理作为数字孪生能否有效代表特定用户在复杂交互中的行为。

Method: 招募40名人类参与者使用Amazon Rufus购物，收集其个人特征、交互轨迹和用户体验反馈。然后创建对应的数字孪生重复相同任务，进行成对比较分析。

Result: 数字孪生通常探索更多样化的选择，但其行为模式与人类一致，并能产生相似的设计反馈。这表明LLM代理在模拟人类多轮交互方面具有潜力。

Conclusion: LLM代理作为数字孪生能够较好地模拟人类与Agentic AI系统的多轮交互，为可扩展评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Agentic AI is emerging, capable of executing tasks through natural language,
such as Copilot for coding or Amazon Rufus for shopping. Evaluating these
systems is challenging, as their rapid evolution outpaces traditional human
evaluation. Researchers have proposed LLM Agents to simulate participants as
digital twins, but it remains unclear to what extent a digital twin can
represent a specific customer in multi-turn interaction with an agentic AI
system. In this paper, we recruited 40 human participants to shop with Amazon
Rufus, collected their personas, interaction traces, and UX feedback, and then
created digital twins to repeat the task. Pairwise comparison of human and
digital-twin traces shows that while agents often explored more diverse
choices, their action patterns aligned with humans and yielded similar design
feedback. This study is the first to quantify how closely LLM agents can mirror
human multi-turn interaction with an agentic AI system, highlighting their
potential for scalable evaluation.

Motivation: 虽然使用大语言模型代理进行社会模拟以支持政策制定的兴趣日益增长，但实际应用仍然有限。论文旨在解决如何使这些模拟对政策真正有用的问题。

Method: 采用为期一年的迭代设计方法，与大学应急准备团队合作，开发了包含13,000个代理的模拟系统，模拟大规模聚集活动中的群体移动和通信行为。

Result: 模拟结果成功影响了实际政策实施，包括志愿者培训、疏散协议和基础设施规划。识别出三个关键设计启示：从可验证场景开始逐步建立信任、使用初步模拟获取隐性知识、将模拟与政策发展视为共同演进过程。

Conclusion: 论文提出了使大语言模型代理模拟对政策制定真正有用的可行路径，强调信任建立、知识获取和共同演进的重要性。

Abstract: There is growing interest in using Large Language Models as agents (LLM
agents) for social simulations to inform policy, yet real-world adoption
remains limited. This paper addresses the question: How can LLM agent
simulations be made genuinely useful for policy? We report on a year-long
iterative design engagement with a university emergency preparedness team.
Across multiple design iterations, we iteratively developed a system of 13,000
LLM agents that simulate crowd movement and communication during a large-scale
gathering under various emergency scenarios. These simulations informed actual
policy implementation, shaping volunteer training, evacuation protocols, and
infrastructure planning. Analyzing this process, we identify three design
implications: start with verifiable scenarios and build trust gradually, use
preliminary simulations to elicit tacit knowledge, and treat simulation and
policy development as evolving together. These implications highlight
actionable pathways to making LLM agent simulations that are genuinely useful
for policy.

Motivation: AI伴侣聊天机器人日益流行，但其心理社会影响尚不明确，需要系统研究这些技术如何影响用户福祉和人际关系。

Method: 采用混合方法：1）大规模准实验研究，使用分层倾向得分匹配和双重差分回归分析Reddit纵向数据；2）15个半结构化访谈，基于Knapp关系发展模型进行主题分析。

Result: 研究发现混合效应：积极方面包括情感和悲伤表达增强、可读性提高、人际关注增加；消极方面包括孤独感和自杀意念语言增加。访谈揭示了关系发展的三个阶段：启动、升级和联结。

Conclusion: AI伴侣应设计为支持健康边界、促进正念参与、支持披露但不产生依赖、明确关系阶段，以最大化心理社会效益同时降低风险。

Abstract: AI-powered companion chatbots (AICCs) such as Replika are increasingly
popular, offering empathetic interactions, yet their psychosocial impacts
remain unclear. We examined how engaging with AICCs shaped wellbeing and how
users perceived these experiences. First, we conducted a large-scale
quasi-experimental study of longitudinal Reddit data, applying stratified
propensity score matching and Difference-in-Differences regression. Findings
revealed mixed effects -- greater affective and grief expression, readability,
and interpersonal focus, alongside increases in language about loneliness and
suicidal ideation. Second, we complemented these results with 15
semi-structured interviews, which we thematically analyzed and contextualized
using Knapp's relationship development model. We identified trajectories of
initiation, escalation, and bonding, wherein AICCs provided emotional
validation and social rehearsal but also carried risks of over-reliance and
withdrawal. Triangulating across methods, we offer design implications for AI
companions that scaffold healthy boundaries, support mindful engagement,
support disclosure without dependency, and surface relationship stages --
maximizing psychosocial benefits while mitigating risks.

Motivation: 工作场所谈判存在心理障碍，AI虽然提供个性化教练服务，但其在谈判准备方面的有效性尚不明确，需要与传统方法进行比较研究。

Method: 构建基于Brett谈判模型的AI教练Trucey，进行267人的组间实验，比较Trucey、ChatGPT和传统手册的效果，并进行15人的深度访谈。

Result: Trucey在减少恐惧方面表现最佳，但手册在可用性和心理赋权方面优于两个AI系统。访谈显示手册的全面可复习内容对参与者信心和准备度至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了AI优越性的假设，建议设计混合系统，整合结构化理论内容与针对性演练、清晰边界和自适应支架，以解决心理障碍并支持谈判准备。

Abstract: Workplace negotiations are undermined by psychological barriers, which can
even derail well-prepared tactics. AI offers personalized and always --
available negotiation coaching, yet its effectiveness for negotiation
preparedness remains unclear. We built Trucey, a prototype AI coach grounded in
Brett's negotiation model. We conducted a between-subjects experiment (N=267),
comparing Trucey, ChatGPT, and a traditional negotiation Handbook, followed by
in-depth interviews (N=15). While Trucey showed the strongest reductions in
fear relative to both comparison conditions, the Handbook outperformed both AIs
in usability and psychological empowerment. Interviews revealed that the
Handbook's comprehensive, reviewable content was crucial for participants'
confidence and preparedness. In contrast, although participants valued AI's
rehearsal capability, its guidance often felt verbose and fragmented --
delivered in bits and pieces that required additional effort -- leaving them
uncertain or overwhelmed. These findings challenge assumptions of AI
superiority and motivate hybrid designs that integrate structured,
theory-driven content with targeted rehearsal, clear boundaries, and adaptive
scaffolds to address psychological barriers and support negotiation
preparedness.

Method: 使用开源和闭源指令调优的LLM进行遗传扰动和分子属性发现任务评估，并与线性bandits、高斯过程优化等传统方法对比，提出LLMNN混合方法。

Result: LLM代理对实验反馈不敏感，替换真实结果为随机标签不影响性能；传统方法在所有基准测试中始终优于LLM代理；LLMNN方法在多个领域实现竞争性或更优性能。

Conclusion: 当前开源和闭源LLM在实践中无法执行上下文实验设计，需要将基于先验的推理与更新后验的批量获取解耦的混合框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently been proposed as general-purpose
agents for experimental design, with claims that they can perform in-context
experimental design. We evaluate this hypothesis using both open- and
closed-source instruction-tuned LLMs applied to genetic perturbation and
molecular property discovery tasks. We find that LLM-based agents show no
sensitivity to experimental feedback: replacing true outcomes with randomly
permuted labels has no impact on performance. Across benchmarks, classical
methods such as linear bandits and Gaussian process optimization consistently
outperform LLM agents. We further propose a simple hybrid method, LLM-guided
Nearest Neighbour (LLMNN) sampling, that combines LLM prior knowledge with
nearest-neighbor sampling to guide the design of experiments. LLMNN achieves
competitive or superior performance across domains without requiring
significant in-context adaptation. These results suggest that current open- and
closed-source LLMs do not perform in-context experimental design in practice
and highlight the need for hybrid frameworks that decouple prior-based
reasoning from batch acquisition with updated posteriors.

Motivation: 重新解释生成模型中的幻觉现象，将其定义为估计值与任何合理原因之间的连接失败，挑战传统认为幻觉仅源于模型不完美的观点。

Method: 通过理论分析建立幻觉的形式化定义，推导出最优估计器仍会产生幻觉的概率下界，并在硬币聚合、开放问答和文本到图像生成任务中进行实验验证。

Result: 理论分析表明即使损失最小化的最优估计器也会产生幻觉，实验在多个任务中验证了理论预测。

Conclusion: 幻觉是损失最小化与人类可接受输出之间的结构性错配问题，本质上是估计误差由校准不当引起的。

Abstract: We formalize hallucinations in generative models as failures to link an
estimate to any plausible cause. Under this interpretation, we show that even
loss-minimizing optimal estimators still hallucinate. We confirm this with a
general high probability lower bound on hallucinate rate for generic data
distributions. This reframes hallucination as structural misalignment between
loss minimization and human-acceptable outputs, and hence estimation errors
induced by miscalibration. Experiments on coin aggregation, open-ended QA, and
text-to-image support our theory.

Abstract: In this digital era, online shopping is common practice in our daily lives.
Product reviews significantly influence consumer buying behavior and help

study illustrates the utility of various machine learning classifiers in
detecting spam reviews, with Logistic Regression achieving an accuracy of
90.35%, thus contributing to a more trustworthy and transparent online shopping

Motivation: 最小描述长度原则在神经网络（如Transformer）中的应用面临挑战，因为缺乏对模型复杂度的原则性、通用度量方法。本文旨在为Transformer建立具有理论保证的描述长度目标框架。

Method: 基于柯尔莫哥洛夫复杂度理论建立渐近最优描述长度目标的理论框架，证明Transformer存在此类目标，并构建基于自适应高斯混合先验的可微分变分目标。

Result: 理论证明渐近最优目标存在且能实现最优压缩，实验表明变分目标能在算法任务中选择低复杂度解并实现强泛化，但标准优化器难以从随机初始化找到此类解。

Conclusion: 通过提供具有强渐近保证的描述长度目标理论框架，为训练实现更好压缩和泛化的神经网络指明了潜在路径。

Abstract: The Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle offers a formal framework for
applying Occam's razor in machine learning. However, its application to neural
networks such as Transformers is challenging due to the lack of a principled,
universal measure for model complexity. This paper introduces the theoretical
notion of asymptotically optimal description length objectives, grounded in the
theory of Kolmogorov complexity. We establish that a minimizer of such an
objective achieves optimal compression, for any dataset, up to an additive
constant, in the limit as model resource bounds increase. We prove that
asymptotically optimal objectives exist for Transformers, building on a new
demonstration of their computational universality. We further show that such
objectives can be tractable and differentiable by constructing and analyzing a
variational objective based on an adaptive Gaussian mixture prior. Our
empirical analysis shows that this variational objective selects for a
low-complexity solution with strong generalization on an algorithmic task, but
standard optimizers fail to find such solutions from a random initialization,
highlighting key optimization challenges. More broadly, by providing a
theoretical framework for identifying description length objectives with strong
asymptotic guarantees, we outline a potential path towards training neural
networks that achieve greater compression and generalization.

TL;DR: 提出IIET（迭代隐式欧拉Transformer）和IIAD蒸馏方法，解决高阶数值方法在Transformer中的性能-效率权衡问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的高阶数值方法虽然能提升Transformer在NLP和CV任务中的性能，但带来了计算开销增加的性能-效率权衡问题，且传统蒸馏方法可能损害这些模型的性能。

Method: 1. 提出IIET，使用迭代隐式欧拉方法简化高阶方法；2. 提出IIAD蒸馏方法，通过灵活阈值平衡性能-效率权衡。

Result: 在lm-evaluation-harness上，IIET比普通Transformer平均准确率提升2.65%，比PCformer提升0.8%；高效变体E-IIET减少55%推理开销，保持99.4%原始任务准确率；最高效变体在可比速度下比普通Transformer性能提升超1.6%。

Conclusion: IIET和IIAD方法有效解决了高阶Transformer模型的性能-效率权衡问题，实现了性能提升与推理效率的平衡。

Abstract: High-order numerical methods enhance Transformer performance in tasks like
NLP and CV, but introduce a performance-efficiency trade-off due to increased
computational overhead. Our analysis reveals that conventional efficiency
techniques, such as distillation, can be detrimental to the performance of
these models, exemplified by PCformer. To explore more optimizable ODE-based
Transformer architectures, we propose the \textbf{I}terative \textbf{I}mplicit
\textbf{E}uler \textbf{T}ransformer \textbf{(IIET)}, which simplifies
high-order methods using an iterative implicit Euler approach. This
simplification not only leads to superior performance but also facilitates
model compression compared to PCformer. To enhance inference efficiency, we
introduce \textbf{I}teration \textbf{I}nfluence-\textbf{A}ware
\textbf{D}istillation \textbf{(IIAD)}. Through a flexible threshold, IIAD
allows users to effectively balance the performance-efficiency trade-off. On
lm-evaluation-harness, IIET boosts average accuracy by 2.65\% over vanilla
Transformers and 0.8\% over PCformer. Its efficient variant, E-IIET,
significantly cuts inference overhead by 55\% while retaining 99.4\% of the
original task accuracy. Moreover, the most efficient IIET variant achieves an
average performance gain exceeding 1.6\% over vanilla Transformer with
comparable speed.

TL;DR: 论文提出了EPO框架，通过熵正则化、熵平滑正则器和自适应相位加权机制，解决多轮稀疏奖励环境中LLM智能体的探索-利用级联失败问题，在ScienceWorld和ALFWorld上分别实现了152%和19.8%的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多轮稀疏奖励环境中训练LLM智能体面临根本性挑战，作者发现了一个独特的失败模式：探索-利用级联失败，包括早期策略过早收敛和晚期策略崩溃，传统熵正则化方法在此设置下适得其反。

Method: 提出Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization (EPO)框架，包含三个协同机制：(1) 多轮设置中的熵正则化增强探索；(2) 熵平滑正则器限制策略熵在历史平均值范围内；(3) 自适应相位加权平衡训练过程中的探索与利用。

Result: EPO在ScienceWorld上实现高达152%的性能提升，在ALFWorld上实现19.8%的性能提升。分析证明EPO能保证熵方差的单调递减，同时保持收敛性。

Conclusion: 多轮稀疏奖励环境需要与传统RL根本不同的熵控制方法，EPO框架为LLM智能体训练提供了有效的解决方案，具有广泛的应用意义。

Abstract: Training LLM agents in multi-turn environments with sparse rewards, where
completing a single task requires 30+ turns of interaction within an episode,
presents a fundamental challenge for reinforcement learning. We identify a
critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation
cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature
convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed,
low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse,
where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting
chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized
Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle
through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in
multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing
regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent
abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances
exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO
guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining
convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld
and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn
sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than
traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.

Motivation: 解决强化学习在长视野稀疏奖励任务中面临的探索-利用权衡问题，现有基于策略熵的方法容易因多轮分布偏移导致训练不稳定。

Method: 扩展自模仿学习框架，引入课程管理探索过程：早期使用工具调用奖励积累技能，后期加强自模仿利用成功模式，并重新校准经验优势值防止策略漂移。

Result: SPEAR能够在训练过程中保持熵值在平衡范围内，实现渐进式探索-利用平衡，提高训练稳定性。

Conclusion: SPEAR通过课程式自模仿学习有效解决了强化学习中的探索-利用困境，为训练智能体LLMs提供了稳定有效的方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic
tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks,
yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off.
Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but
such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to
the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive
exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own
experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway
divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL)
recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a
replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy
update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range
of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum
to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster
skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL.
At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the
accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar
distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As
training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing
successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level
exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth.
To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in
the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such
as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and
advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb
over-confidence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL的内部计算能否用于改进SFT的质量，因为ICL在数据稀缺情况下比SFT具有更好的泛化性和校准响应。

Method: 引入ICL激活对齐(IA2)自蒸馏技术，让SFT模型复制ICL的激活模式，激励ICL式的内部推理。

Result: 在12个流行基准测试和2个模型家族上的广泛实证结果显示，SFT前进行IA2预处理显著提高了模型输出的准确性和校准性。

Conclusion: IA2不仅具有实用价值，还为理解模型适应的内部机制提供了概念窗口。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is used to specialize model behavior by training
weights to produce intended target responses for queries. In contrast,
In-Context Learning (ICL) adapts models during inference with instructions or
demonstrations in the prompt. ICL can offer better generalizability and more
calibrated responses compared to SFT in data scarce settings, at the cost of
more inference compute. In this work, we ask the question: Can ICL's internal
computations be used to improve the qualities of SFT? We first show that ICL
and SFT produce distinct activation patterns, indicating that the two methods
achieve adaptation through different functional mechanisms. Motivated by this
observation and to use ICL's rich functionality, we introduce ICL Activation
Alignment (IA2), a self-distillation technique which aims to replicate ICL's
activation patterns in SFT models and incentivizes ICL-like internal reasoning.
Performing IA2 as a priming step before SFT significantly improves the accuracy
and calibration of model outputs, as shown by our extensive empirical results
on 12 popular benchmarks and 2 model families. This finding is not only
practically useful, but also offers a conceptual window into the inner
mechanics of model adaptation.

Motivation: 解决从不完全海面观测重建海洋内部动力学（如垂直速度场）的挑战，该领域长期缺乏标准化基准，阻碍了系统研究。

Method: 构建KD48基准数据集，提出VISION重建范式，采用动态提示技术从可用观测数据生成视觉提示，通过状态条件提示模块注入通用骨干网络，实现自适应计算策略调整。

Result: 在KD48基准上的广泛实验表明，VISION显著优于最先进模型，在极端数据缺失场景下表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 通过提供高质量基准和鲁棒模型，为数据不确定性下的海洋科学研究建立了坚实基础基础设施。

Abstract: Reconstructing subsurface ocean dynamics, such as vertical velocity fields,
from incomplete surface observations poses a critical challenge in Earth
science, a field long hampered by the lack of standardized, analysis-ready
benchmarks. To systematically address this issue and catalyze research, we
first build and release KD48, a high-resolution ocean dynamics benchmark
derived from petascale simulations and curated with expert-driven denoising.
Building on this benchmark, we introduce VISION, a novel reconstruction
paradigm based on Dynamic Prompting designed to tackle the core problem of
missing data in real-world observations. The essence of VISION lies in its
ability to generate a visual prompt on-the-fly from any available subset of
observations, which encodes both data availability and the ocean's physical
state. More importantly, we design a State-conditioned Prompting module that
efficiently injects this prompt into a universal backbone, endowed with
geometry- and scale-aware operators, to guide its adaptive adjustment of
computational strategies. This mechanism enables VISION to precisely handle the
challenges posed by varying input combinations. Extensive experiments on the
KD48 benchmark demonstrate that VISION not only substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art models but also exhibits strong generalization under extreme
data missing scenarios. By providing a high-quality benchmark and a robust
model, our work establishes a solid infrastructure for ocean science research
under data uncertainty. Our codes are available at:

TL;DR: SlimDiff是一个无需梯度的扩散模型结构压缩框架，通过激活信息指导的谱近似方法，在保持生成质量的同时减少参数和加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然生成性能优秀，但计算成本高昂，现有效率技术需要微调或重新训练来恢复性能，存在瓶颈。

Method: 将扩散模型压缩重构为谱近似任务，利用激活协方差定义低秩子空间，在固定压缩预算下指导动态剪枝，采用模块化分解而非孤立矩阵分解。

Result: 相比基线方法实现35%加速和约1亿参数减少，生成质量与未压缩模型相当，仅需约500个校准样本，比先前方法少70倍以上。

Conclusion: 这是第一个无需训练、基于闭式解的激活指导扩散模型结构压缩方法，兼具理论清晰度和实际效率。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs), lauded for their generative performance, are
computationally prohibitive due to their billion-scale parameters and iterative
denoising dynamics. Existing efficiency techniques, such as quantization,
timestep reduction, or pruning, offer savings in compute, memory, or runtime
but are strictly bottlenecked by reliance on fine-tuning or retraining to
recover performance. In this work, we introduce SlimDiff, an automated
activation-informed structural compression framework that reduces both
attention and feedforward dimensionalities in DMs, while being entirely
gradient-free. SlimDiff reframes DM compression as a spectral approximation
task, where activation covariances across denoising timesteps define low-rank
subspaces that guide dynamic pruning under a fixed compression budget. This
activation-aware formulation mitigates error accumulation across timesteps by
applying module-wise decompositions over functional weight groups: query--key
interactions, value--output couplings, and feedforward projections, rather than
isolated matrix factorizations, while adaptively allocating sparsity across
modules to respect the non-uniform geometry of diffusion trajectories. SlimDiff
achieves up to 35\% acceleration and $\sim$100M parameter reduction over
baselines, with generation quality on par with uncompressed models without any
backpropagation. Crucially, our approach requires only about 500 calibration
samples, over 70$\times$ fewer than prior methods. To our knowledge, this is
the first closed-form, activation-guided structural compression of DMs that is
entirely training-free, providing both theoretical clarity and practical
efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型存在反向时间速度可能变得僵硬且隐含允许无限传播速度的问题，需要开发具有有限速度传输和全局有界动能的更稳定生成模型。

Method: 使用阻尼波动方程和随机Kac表示，在速度空间引入无分类器引导，提出端点蒸馏方法训练学生模型匹配教师模型在长区间内的行为。

Result: 实验表明DistillKac能够在极少的函数评估次数下生成高质量样本，同时保持有限速度概率流的数值稳定性优势。

Conclusion: DistillKac通过有限速度概率流和端点蒸馏策略，实现了高效稳定的图像生成，为生成模型提供了新的设计思路。

Abstract: We present DistillKac, a fast image generator that uses the damped wave
equation and its stochastic Kac representation to move probability mass at
finite speed. In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can
become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics
enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy.
Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity
space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then
propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen
teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes
supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments
demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function
evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed
probability flows.

Motivation: 解决现有半监督学习框架的关键限制，包括静态视图交互、不可靠的伪标签以及缺乏困难样本建模，提供一个原则性和可泛化的解决方案。

Method: 采用三元交互结构：两个在互补表示上训练的学生分类器、通过验证反馈自适应调节伪标签选择和损失平衡的元学习教师、以及扰动嵌入以揭示决策边界弱点的非参数生成器。使用互信息而非置信度选择伪标签，并将三元交互形式化为Stackelberg博弈。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、SVHN、STL-10和ImageNet上的广泛实验表明，TRiCo在低标签场景下持续实现最先进的性能，同时保持架构无关性并与冻结视觉主干兼容。

Conclusion: TRiCo通过重新思考半监督学习的结构，提供了一个原则性的三元博弈论协同训练框架，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在各种基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: We introduce TRiCo, a novel triadic game-theoretic co-training framework that
rethinks the structure of semi-supervised learning by incorporating a teacher,
two students, and an adversarial generator into a unified training paradigm.
Unlike existing co-training or teacher-student approaches, TRiCo formulates SSL
as a structured interaction among three roles: (i) two student classifiers
trained on frozen, complementary representations, (ii) a meta-learned teacher
that adaptively regulates pseudo-label selection and loss balancing via
validation-based feedback, and (iii) a non-parametric generator that perturbs
embeddings to uncover decision boundary weaknesses. Pseudo-labels are selected
based on mutual information rather than confidence, providing a more robust
measure of epistemic uncertainty. This triadic interaction is formalized as a
Stackelberg game, where the teacher leads strategy optimization and students
follow under adversarial perturbations. By addressing key limitations in
existing SSL frameworks, such as static view interactions, unreliable
pseudo-labels, and lack of hard sample modeling, TRiCo provides a principled
and generalizable solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, STL-10,
and ImageNet demonstrate that TRiCo consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance in low-label regimes, while remaining architecture-agnostic and
compatible with frozen vision backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受线性模式连通性（LMC）的启发，作者发现oracle解通常与先前任务的最优解保持低损失的线性连接，这为解决灾难性遗忘提供了新思路。

Method: IVT周期性地将模型参数转移到保持与先前任务最优解线性连通性的变换解上，使用对角Fisher信息矩阵高效近似变换，适用于无示例和基于示例的场景。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，IVT显著提升了强基线方法的性能，如在CIFAR-100上将PASS基线的最终准确率提升+5.12%，在FGVCAircraft上将CLIP预训练的SLCA基线的平均准确率提升+14.93%。

Conclusion: IVT通过保持线性连通性有效缓解了灾难性遗忘，是一种通用且高效的类增量学习增强方法。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to sequentially acquire knowledge of
new classes without forgetting previously learned ones. Despite recent
progress, current CIL methods still exhibit significant performance gaps
compared to their oracle counterparts-models trained with full access to
historical data. Inspired by recent insights on Linear Mode Connectivity (LMC),
we revisit the geometric properties of oracle solutions in CIL and uncover a
fundamental observation: these oracle solutions typically maintain low-loss
linear connections to the optimum of previous tasks. Motivated by this finding,
we propose Increment Vector Transformation (IVT), a novel plug-and-play
framework designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting during training. Rather
than directly following CIL updates, IVT periodically teleports the model
parameters to transformed solutions that preserve linear connectivity to
previous task optimum. By maintaining low-loss along these connecting paths,
IVT effectively ensures stable performance on previously learned tasks. The
transformation is efficiently approximated using diagonal Fisher Information
Matrices, making IVT suitable for both exemplar-free and exemplar-based
scenarios, and compatible with various initialization strategies. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-100, FGVCAircraft, ImageNet-Subset, and ImageNet-Full
demonstrate that IVT consistently enhances the performance of strong CIL
baselines. Specifically, on CIFAR-100, IVT improves the last accuracy of the
PASS baseline by +5.12% and reduces forgetting by 2.54%. For the
CLIP-pre-trained SLCA baseline on FGVCAircraft, IVT yields gains of +14.93% in
average accuracy and +21.95% in last accuracy. The code will be released.

Result: 理论分析证明类内对比损失能够丰富类内多样性，实验结果表明所提方法有效。

Conclusion: 通过类内对比损失和边界损失的结合，能够有效提升知识蒸馏中软标签的质量和教师模型的训练效果。

Abstract: Since the advent of knowledge distillation, much research has focused on how
the soft labels generated by the teacher model can be utilized effectively.
Existing studies points out that the implicit knowledge within soft labels
originates from the multi-view structure present in the data. Feature
variations within samples of the same class allow the student model to
generalize better by learning diverse representations. However, in existing
distillation methods, teacher models predominantly adhere to ground-truth
labels as targets, without considering the diverse representations within the
same class. Therefore, we propose incorporating an intra-class contrastive loss
during teacher training to enrich the intra-class information contained in soft
labels. In practice, we find that intra-class loss causes instability in
training and slows convergence. To mitigate these issues, margin loss is
integrated into intra-class contrastive learning to improve the training
stability and convergence speed. Simultaneously, we theoretically analyze the
impact of this loss on the intra-class distances and inter-class distances. It
has been proved that the intra-class contrastive loss can enrich the
intra-class diversity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method.

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了联邦学习中的统计异构性和模型异构性问题，同时通过激励机制促进了客户端参与，在保持通信效率的同时显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized learning
(DL) approach that enables the use of distributed data without compromising
user privacy. However, FL poses several key challenges. First, it is frequently
assumed that every client can train the same machine learning models, however,
not all clients are able to meet this assumption because of differences in
their business needs and computational resources. Second, statistical
heterogeneity (a.k.a. non-IID data) poses a major challenge in FL, which can
lead to lower global model performance. Third, while addressing these
challenges, there is a need for a cost-effective incentive mechanism to
encourage clients to participate in FL training. In response to these
challenges, we propose several methodologies: DL-SH, which facilitates
efficient, privacy-preserving, and communication-efficient learning in the
context of statistical heterogeneity; DL-MH, designed to manage fully
heterogeneous models while tackling statistical disparities; and I-DL-MH, an
incentive-based extension of DL-MH that promotes client engagement in federated
learning training by providing incentives within this complex federated
learning framework. Comprehensive experiments were carried out to assess the
performance and scalability of the proposed approaches across a range of
complex experimental settings. This involved utilizing various model
architectures, in diverse data distributions, including IID and several non-IID
scenarios, as well as multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approaches significantly enhance accuracy and decrease
communication costs while effectively addressing statistical heterogeneity and
model heterogeneity in comparison to existing state-of-the-art approaches and
baselines, with DL-SH improving global model accuracy by 153%, and I-DL-MH
achieving a 225% improvement under non-IID conditions.

Conclusion: 联合建模对于构建真实且可控的交互系统生成模型至关重要。

Abstract: Generative models often treat continuous data and discrete events as separate
processes, creating a gap in modeling complex systems where they interact
synchronously. To bridge this gap, we introduce JointDiff, a novel diffusion
framework designed to unify these two processes by simultaneously generating
continuous spatio-temporal data and synchronous discrete events. We demonstrate
its efficacy in the sports domain by simultaneously modeling multi-agent
trajectories and key possession events. This joint modeling is validated with
non-controllable generation and two novel controllable generation scenarios:
weak-possessor-guidance, which offers flexible semantic control over game
dynamics through a simple list of intended ball possessors, and text-guidance,
which enables fine-grained, language-driven generation. To enable the
conditioning with these guidance signals, we introduce CrossGuid, an effective
conditioning operation for multi-agent domains. We also share a new unified
sports benchmark enhanced with textual descriptions for soccer and football
datasets. JointDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that
joint modeling is crucial for building realistic and controllable generative
models for interactive systems.

*Lute Lillo,Nick Cheney*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在持续学习中，激活函数的选择是缓解塑性损失的关键因素，作者提出了两种新的非线性激活函数（Smooth-Leaky和Randomized Smooth-Leaky）来维持模型的适应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在持续学习场景中，模型不仅面临灾难性遗忘问题，还会逐渐丧失适应能力（塑性损失），而激活函数在这种失效模式中的作用尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 基于对负分支形状和饱和行为的属性分析，引入了两种即插即用的非线性激活函数，并在监督类增量基准测试和非平稳强化学习环境中进行评估。

Result: 研究表明，精心设计的激活函数能够在不增加额外容量或任务特定调优的情况下，持续维持持续学习中的塑性。

Conclusion: 激活函数设计提供了一种轻量级、领域通用的方法来维持持续学习中的塑性，是架构无关的关键杠杆。

Abstract: In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation
functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink
once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the
picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively
lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of
the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that
activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating
plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape
and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky
and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings:
(i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning
with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled
distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and
diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under
change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a
lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning
without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.

### [309] [MDAR: A Multi-scene Dynamic Audio Reasoning Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22461)
*Hui Li,Changhao Jiang,Hongyu Wang,Ming Zhang,Jiajun Sun,Zhixiong Yang,Yifei Cao,Shihan Dou,Xiaoran Fan,Baoyu Fan,Tao Ji,Tao Gui,Qi Zhang,Xuanjing Huang*

Main category: cs.SD

TL;DR: MDAR是一个评估复杂多场景动态音频推理能力的基准测试，包含3000个精心策划的问答对，涵盖5类复杂推理和3种问题类型。对26个最先进音频语言模型的测试显示，所有模型在复杂推理任务上都有局限性，没有模型达到80%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注静态或单场景设置，无法充分捕捉多说话者、展开事件和异构音频源交互的场景。需要评估AI代理在现实世界场景中有效交互所需的音频推理能力。

Method: 引入MDAR基准测试，包含3000个与多样化音频片段链接的问答对，涵盖5个复杂推理类别和3种问题类型（单选、多选、开放式）。对26个最先进的音频语言模型进行基准测试。

Result: Qwen2.5-Omni在单选题上达到76.67%准确率，GPT-4o Audio为68.47%；但在更具挑战性的多选题和开放式任务中，GPT-4o Audio显著优于Qwen2.5-Omni。所有三种问题类型中，没有模型达到80%性能。

Conclusion: MDAR提出了独特的挑战，作为推进音频推理研究的基准测试具有重要价值，凸显了当前模型在复杂音频推理任务上的局限性。

Abstract: The ability to reason from audio, including speech, paralinguistic cues,
environmental sounds, and music, is essential for AI agents to interact
effectively in real-world scenarios. Existing benchmarks mainly focus on static
or single-scene settings and do not fully capture scenarios where multiple
speakers, unfolding events, and heterogeneous audio sources interact. To
address these challenges, we introduce MDAR, a benchmark for evaluating models
on complex, multi-scene, and dynamically evolving audio reasoning tasks. MDAR
comprises 3,000 carefully curated question-answer pairs linked to diverse audio
clips, covering five categories of complex reasoning and spanning three
question types. We benchmark 26 state-of-the-art audio language models on MDAR
and observe that they exhibit limitations in complex reasoning tasks. On
single-choice questions, Qwen2.5-Omni (open-source) achieves 76.67% accuracy,
whereas GPT-4o Audio (closed-source) reaches 68.47%; however, GPT-4o Audio
substantially outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni on the more challenging multiple-choice
and open-ended tasks. Across all three question types, no model achieves 80%
performance. These findings underscore the unique challenges posed by MDAR and
its value as a benchmark for advancing audio reasoning research.Code and
benchmark can be found at https://github.com/luckyerr/MDAR.

### [310] [HetaRAG: Hybrid Deep Retrieval-Augmented Generation across Heterogeneous Data Stores](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21336)
*Guohang Yan,Yue Zhang,Pinlong Cai,Ding Wang,Song Mao,Hongwei Zhang,Yaoze Zhang,Hairong Zhang,Xinyu Cai,Botian Shi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: HetaRAG是一个混合深度检索增强生成框架，通过协调异构数据存储中的跨模态证据，将向量索引、知识图谱、全文引擎和结构化数据库统一到单一检索平面，动态路由和融合证据以最大化召回率、精确度和上下文保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统通常是文本单一存储后端，存在不可避免的权衡：向量搜索捕获语义相似性但丢失全局上下文；知识图谱擅长关系精度但召回率差；全文索引快速精确但语义盲；关系引擎提供强事务保证但无语义理解。这些异构检索范式是互补的。

Method: 提出原则性融合方案，协调异构检索范式协同工作，减轻单一模态的弱点。构建混合深度检索增强生成框架，统一向量索引、知识图谱、全文引擎和结构化数据库，动态路由和融合证据。

Result: 进行了初步探索并构建了初始RAG流水线，部分代码已在GitHub上开源。

Conclusion: 异构检索范式具有互补性，通过协同编排可以克服单一存储后端的局限性，实现更优的检索增强生成效果。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become a dominant paradigm for
mitigating knowledge hallucination and staleness in large language models
(LLMs) while preserving data security. By retrieving relevant evidence from
private, domain-specific corpora and injecting it into carefully engineered
prompts, RAG delivers trustworthy responses without the prohibitive cost of
fine-tuning. Traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems are
text-only and often rely on a single storage backend, most commonly a vector
database. In practice, this monolithic design suffers from unavoidable
trade-offs: vector search captures semantic similarity yet loses global
context; knowledge graphs excel at relational precision but struggle with
recall; full-text indexes are fast and exact yet semantically blind; and
relational engines such as MySQL provide strong transactional guarantees but no
semantic understanding. We argue that these heterogeneous retrieval paradigms
are complementary, and propose a principled fusion scheme to orchestrate them
synergistically, mitigating the weaknesses of any single modality. In this work
we introduce HetaRAG, a hybrid, deep-retrieval augmented generation framework
that orchestrates cross-modal evidence from heterogeneous data stores. We plan
to design a system that unifies vector indices, knowledge graphs, full-text
engines, and structured databases into a single retrieval plane, dynamically
routing and fusing evidence to maximize recall, precision, and contextual
fidelity. To achieve this design goal, we carried out preliminary explorations
and constructed an initial RAG pipeline; this technical report provides a brief
overview. The partial code is available at
https://github.com/KnowledgeXLab/HetaRAG.

*Dayu Yang,Hui Fang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ReGeS是一个检索-生成协同框架，通过生成增强检索来提炼用户意图，检索增强生成来区分物品特征，在多个对话推荐系统基准上实现了最先进的推荐准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有解决方案要么需要领域特定工程（限制灵活性），要么仅依赖大语言模型（增加幻觉风险），而朴素RAG在对话推荐系统中受限于嘈杂对话削弱检索效果和忽视相似物品细微差异的问题。

Method: 提出ReGeS框架，统一生成增强检索（从对话中提炼信息性用户意图）和检索增强生成（区分细微物品特征），无需额外标注，减少幻觉，简化持续更新。

Result: 在多个对话推荐系统基准上的实验表明，ReGeS在推荐准确性方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 检索-生成协同对于知识密集型对话推荐系统任务是有效的，能够提高推荐准确性同时减少幻觉风险。

Abstract: Connecting conversation with external domain knowledge is vital for
conversational recommender systems (CRS) to correctly understand user
preferences. However, existing solutions either require domain-specific
engineering, which limits flexibility, or rely solely on large language models,
which increases the risk of hallucination. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(RAG) holds promise, its naive use in CRS is hindered by noisy dialogues that
weaken retrieval and by overlooked nuances among similar items. We propose
ReGeS, a reciprocal Retrieval-Generation Synergy framework that unifies
generation-augmented retrieval to distill informative user intent from
conversations and retrieval-augmented generation to differentiate subtle item
features. This synergy obviates the need for extra annotations, reduces
hallucinations, and simplifies continuous updates. Experiments on multiple CRS
benchmarks show that ReGeS achieves state-of-the-art performance in
recommendation accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of reciprocal synergy
for knowledge-intensive CRS tasks.

### [312] [Can Synthetic Query Rewrites Capture User Intent Better than Humans in Retrieval-Augmented Generation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22325)
*JiaYing Zheng,HaiNan Zhang,Liang Pang,YongXin Tong,ZhiMing Zheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出SynRewrite模型，使用合成数据训练查询重写模型，在多轮RAG系统中解决口语化省略和模糊指代问题，在检索和生成任务上优于人工重写。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多轮RAG系统面临口语化省略和模糊指代的查询挑战，传统人工重写因标注者表达能力限制导致与真实系统需求存在差距，而高质量合成查询能更好弥合这一差距。

Method: 使用GPT-4o基于对话历史、当前查询、正例文档和答案合成高质量重写数据，在Flan-T5模型上微调，并通过DPO算法利用生成器反馈进一步优化重写器。

Result: 在TopiOCQA和QRECC数据集上的实验表明，SynRewrite在检索和生成任务上持续优于人工重写。

Conclusion: 合成重写可以作为人工标注的可扩展且有效的替代方案，更好地捕捉用户意图。

Abstract: Multi-turn RAG systems often face queries with colloquial omissions and
ambiguous references, posing significant challenges for effective retrieval and
generation. Traditional query rewriting relies on human annotators to clarify
queries, but due to limitations in annotators' expressive ability and depth of
understanding, manually rewritten queries often diverge from those needed in
real-world RAG systems, resulting in a gap between user intent and system
response. We observe that high-quality synthetic queries can better bridge this
gap, achieving superior performance in both retrieval and generation compared
to human rewrites. This raises an interesting question: Can rewriting models
trained on synthetic queries better capture user intent than human annotators?
In this paper, we propose SynRewrite, a synthetic data-driven query rewriting
model to generate high-quality synthetic rewrites more aligned with user
intent. To construct training data, we prompt GPT-4o with dialogue history,
current queries, positive documents, and answers to synthesize high-quality
rewrites. A Flan-T5 model is then finetuned on this dataset to map dialogue
history and queries to synthetic rewrites. Finally, we further enhance the
rewriter using the generator's feedback through the DPO algorithm to boost
end-task performance. Experiments on TopiOCQA and QRECC datasets show that
SynRewrite consistently outperforms human rewrites in both retrieval and
generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that synthetic rewrites can serve as
a scalable and effective alternative to human annotations.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Cauchy-Schwarz散度的跨模态检索方法，通过引入广义CS散度实现了多模态直接对齐，无需成对比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跨模态检索方法主要关注双模态任务，依赖KL散度、MMD等分布对齐技术，但这些方法存在数值不稳定、超参数敏感、无法捕捉完整分布结构等问题。

Method: 引入Cauchy-Schwarz散度作为超参数无关的度量，并提出基于Hölder不等式的广义CS散度，通过双向循环比较方案实现三个或更多模态的直接对齐。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在双模态和三模态检索任务中均表现出色。

Conclusion: CS/GCS散度方法提高了训练稳定性和检索性能，为多模态对齐提供了统一的数学框架。

Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval requires robust alignment of heterogeneous
data types. Most existing methods focus on bi-modal retrieval tasks and rely on
distributional alignment techniques such as Kullback-Leibler divergence,
Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and correlation alignment. However, these methods
often suffer from critical limitations, including numerical instability,
sensitivity to hyperparameters, and their inability to capture the full
structure of the underlying distributions. In this paper, we introduce the
Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence, a hyperparameter-free measure that improves
both training stability and retrieval performance. We further propose a novel
Generalized CS (GCS) divergence inspired by H\"older's inequality. This
extension enables direct alignment of three or more modalities within a unified
mathematical framework through a bidirectional circular comparison scheme,
eliminating the need for exhaustive pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments
on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both
bi-modal and tri-modal retrieval tasks. The code of our CS/GCS divergence is
publicly available at https://github.com/JiahaoZhang666/CSD.

Main category: cs.GR

TL;DR: SGAligner++是一个跨模态、语言辅助的3D场景图对齐框架，通过统一联合嵌入空间解决部分重叠场景观测的对齐问题，在噪声现实重建中比现有方法提升40%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D场景图对齐方法依赖单模态点云数据，难以处理不完整或噪声输入，需要解决异构模态下部分重叠场景观测的对齐挑战。

Method: 使用轻量级单模态编码器和基于注意力的融合，学习统一的联合嵌入空间，实现跨模态场景图对齐。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的广泛评估显示，SGAligner++在噪声现实重建中比最先进方法性能提升高达40%，并实现跨模态泛化。

Conclusion: SGAligner++通过跨模态语言辅助框架有效解决了3D场景图对齐问题，为视觉定位、3D重建和导航等任务提供了增强的场景理解能力。

Abstract: Aligning 3D scene graphs is a crucial initial step for several applications
in robot navigation and embodied perception. Current methods in 3D scene graph
alignment often rely on single-modality point cloud data and struggle with
incomplete or noisy input. We introduce SGAligner++, a cross-modal,
language-aided framework for 3D scene graph alignment. Our method addresses the
challenge of aligning partially overlapping scene observations across
heterogeneous modalities by learning a unified joint embedding space, enabling
accurate alignment even under low-overlap conditions and sensor noise. By
employing lightweight unimodal encoders and attention-based fusion, SGAligner++
enhances scene understanding for tasks such as visual localization, 3D
reconstruction, and navigation, while ensuring scalability and minimal
computational overhead. Extensive evaluations on real-world datasets
demonstrate that SGAligner++ outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 40%
on noisy real-world reconstructions, while enabling cross-modal generalization.

TL;DR: ControlHair是一个混合框架，结合物理模拟器和条件视频扩散模型，实现可控的动态头发渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频扩散模型缺乏对头发动态的精细控制，而头发模拟和渲染面临复杂的动力学、材料属性和光发交互挑战。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 将物理参数编码为逐帧几何；2) 提取逐帧控制信号；3) 将控制信号输入视频扩散模型生成视频。这种级联设计将物理推理与视频生成解耦。

Result: 在10K视频数据集上训练，ControlHair优于基于文本和姿态的基线方法，能精确控制头发动态。

Conclusion: ControlHair是首个基于物理信息的视频扩散框架，支持动态发型试戴、子弹时间效果和电影图形等应用。

Abstract: Hair simulation and rendering are challenging due to complex strand dynamics,
diverse material properties, and intricate light-hair interactions. Recent
video diffusion models can generate high-quality videos, but they lack
fine-grained control over hair dynamics. We present ControlHair, a hybrid
framework that integrates a physics simulator with conditional video diffusion
to enable controllable dynamic hair rendering. ControlHair adopts a three-stage
pipeline: it first encodes physics parameters (e.g., hair stiffness, wind) into
per-frame geometry using a simulator, then extracts per-frame control signals,
and finally feeds control signals into a video diffusion model to generate
videos with desired hair dynamics. This cascaded design decouples physics
reasoning from video generation, supports diverse physics, and makes training
the video diffusion model easy. Trained on a curated 10K video dataset,
ControlHair outperforms text- and pose-conditioned baselines, delivering
precisely controlled hair dynamics. We further demonstrate three use cases of
ControlHair: dynamic hairstyle try-on, bullet-time effects, and cinemagraphic.
ControlHair introduces the first physics-informed video diffusion framework for
controllable dynamics. We provide a teaser video and experimental results on
our website.

TL;DR: DeformSplat是一个从单张图像重建物体变形的新框架，通过3D高斯变形引导和刚性区域分割技术，解决了现有方法依赖多视角视频的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖多视角视频来恢复变形，这在受限场景下适用性有限。本文旨在从单张图像重建物体变形，扩展变形重建的应用范围。

Method: 提出两个关键技术：1) 高斯到像素匹配，弥合3D高斯表示与2D像素观测之间的领域差距；2) 刚性部分分割，包括初始化和细化，明确识别刚性区域以保持几何一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法，并能自然扩展到帧插值和交互式物体操作等应用。

Conclusion: DeformSplat框架能够仅从单张图像重建一致的变形，为变形重建提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing object deformation from a single image remains a significant
challenge in computer vision and graphics. Existing methods typically rely on
multi-view video to recover deformation, limiting their applicability under
constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose DeformSplat, a novel
framework that effectively guides 3D Gaussian deformation from only a single
image. Our method introduces two main technical contributions. First, we
present Gaussian-to-Pixel Matching which bridges the domain gap between 3D
Gaussian representations and 2D pixel observations. This enables robust
deformation guidance from sparse visual cues. Second, we propose Rigid Part
Segmentation consisting of initialization and refinement. This segmentation
explicitly identifies rigid regions, crucial for maintaining geometric
coherence during deformation. By combining these two techniques, our approach
can reconstruct consistent deformations from a single image. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
methods and naturally extends to various applications,such as frame
interpolation and interactive object manipulation.

Motivation: 当前城市场景重建技术往往忽视纹理质量，导致纹理模型出现明显视觉伪影。需要解决在有限先验知识下同时捕获几何和纹理的问题。

Method: 生成高质量的垂直俯视和水平平面视图，提出多目标优化策略联合最大化纹理保真度、提高几何精度并最小化航拍成本，开发考虑纹理一致性的序列路径规划算法。

Result: 在大规模合成和真实城市数据集上的实验表明，该方法能有效生成适用于同时几何和纹理重建的图像集，以低运营成本创建逼真的纹理场景代理。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了城市几何和纹理协同捕获问题，能够在有限先验信息下实现高质量的城市场景重建。

Abstract: Recent advances in image acquisition and scene reconstruction have enabled
the generation of high-quality structural urban scene geometry, given
sufficient site information. However, current capture techniques often overlook
the crucial importance of texture quality, resulting in noticeable visual
artifacts in the textured models. In this work, we introduce the urban geometry
and texture co-capture problem under limited prior knowledge before a site
visit. The only inputs are a 2D building contour map of the target area and a
safe flying altitude above the buildings. We propose an innovative aerial path
planning framework designed to co-capture images for reconstructing both
structured geometry and high-fidelity textures. To evaluate and guide view
planning, we introduce a comprehensive texture quality assessment system,
including two novel metrics tailored for building facades. Firstly, our method
generates high-quality vertical dipping views and horizontal planar views to
effectively capture both geometric and textural details. A multi-objective
optimization strategy is then proposed to jointly maximize texture fidelity,
improve geometric accuracy, and minimize the cost associated with aerial views.
Furthermore, we present a sequential path planning algorithm that accounts for
texture consistency during image capture. Extensive experiments on large-scale
synthetic and real-world urban datasets demonstrate that our approach
effectively produces image sets suitable for concurrent geometric and texture
reconstruction, enabling the creation of realistic, textured scene proxies at
low operational cost.

Method: 开发了一个从非结构化听证会转录本中提取问答对的流程，构建了第108-117届国会委员会听证会的新数据集

Result: 分析显示不同政党间存在系统性提问策略差异，仅从问题本身就能预测提问者的政党归属

Conclusion: 该数据集和方法不仅推进了国会政治研究，还为分析类似访谈场景中的问答提供了通用框架

Abstract: Questions in political interviews and hearings serve strategic purposes
beyond information gathering including advancing partisan narratives and
shaping public perceptions. However, these strategic aspects remain
understudied due to the lack of large-scale datasets for studying such
discourse. Congressional hearings provide an especially rich and tractable site
for studying political questioning: Interactions are structured by formal
rules, witnesses are obliged to respond, and members with different political
affiliations are guaranteed opportunities to ask questions, enabling
comparisons of behaviors across the political spectrum.
  We develop a pipeline to extract question-answer pairs from unstructured
hearing transcripts and construct a novel dataset of committee hearings from
the 108th--117th Congress. Our analysis reveals systematic differences in
questioning strategies across parties, by showing the party affiliation of
questioners can be predicted from their questions alone. Our dataset and
methods not only advance the study of congressional politics, but also provide
a general framework for analyzing question-answering across interview-like

Motivation: 现有基于VLM的方法将动作预测视为文本生成任务，而SPF认为空中视觉语言导航的动作预测应该作为2D空间定位任务来处理。

Method: 利用VLM将模糊语言指令分解为输入图像上的迭代2D航点标注，结合预测的飞行距离，将2D航点转换为3D位移向量作为无人机动作命令。

Result: 在DRL仿真基准测试中创下新记录，比之前最佳方法绝对提升63%。在真实世界评估中大幅超越强基线方法。

Conclusion: SPF展示了在无需训练的情况下实现高效空中导航的能力，并具有出色的泛化性，可适应不同的VLM模型。

Abstract: We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language
navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is
capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions
in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that
treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to
consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF
harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative
annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted
traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement
vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the
traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF
performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow
dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL
simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute
margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong
baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to
highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable
generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev

Motivation: 传统人工检查运河涵洞存在诸多挑战，包括涵洞老化、几何形状复杂、照明差、天气影响和难以接近等问题。

Method: 使用网络级视觉语言模型生成开放词汇的感兴趣区域提议，融合立体深度恢复尺度，通过规划器在涵洞约束下重新定位以捕获目标特写图像。

Result: 在伊利运河涵洞部署中，初始感兴趣区域提议与专家达成61.4%一致率，重新成像后评估达到80%一致率。

Conclusion: VISION系统能够将初步假设转化为基于事实的专家级发现，为涵洞检查提供有效的自主解决方案。

Abstract: Culverts on canals such as the Erie Canal, built originally in 1825, require
frequent inspections to ensure safe operation. Human inspection of culverts is
challenging due to age, geometry, poor illumination, weather, and lack of easy
access. We introduce VISION, an end-to-end, language-in-the-loop autonomy
system that couples a web-scale vision-language model (VLM) with constrained
viewpoint planning for autonomous inspection of culverts. Brief prompts to the
VLM solicit open-vocabulary ROI proposals with rationales and confidences,
stereo depth is fused to recover scale, and a planner -- aware of culvert
constraints -- commands repositioning moves to capture targeted close-ups.
Deployed on a quadruped in a culvert under the Erie Canal, VISION closes the
see, decide, move, re-image loop on-board and produces high-resolution images
for detailed reporting without domain-specific fine-tuning. In an external
evaluation by New York Canal Corporation personnel, initial ROI proposals
achieved 61.4\% agreement with subject-matter experts, and final
post-re-imaging assessments reached 80\%, indicating that VISION converts
tentative hypotheses into grounded, expert-aligned findings.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注泛化性和扰动下的鲁棒性，缺乏对视觉偏见的系统量化，限制了理解感知如何影响决策稳定性。

Method: 使用结构化变体生成框架和感知公平验证协议，创建2127个任务实例，评估三种代表性具身代理在两种主流范式下的表现。

Result: 发现所有代理都存在显著视觉偏见，摄像机视角是最关键因素；代理在高度饱和颜色上成功率最高；视觉偏见存在强不对称耦合。

Conclusion: 系统分析视觉偏见是开发安全可靠通用具身代理的前提条件，提出的缓解策略能有效减少视觉偏见。

Abstract: The safety and reliability of embodied agents rely on accurate and unbiased
visual perception. However, existing benchmarks mainly emphasize generalization
and robustness under perturbations, while systematic quantification of visual
bias remains scarce. This gap limits a deeper understanding of how perception
influences decision-making stability. To address this issue, we propose
RoboView-Bias, the first benchmark specifically designed to systematically
quantify visual bias in robotic manipulation, following a principle of factor
isolation. Leveraging a structured variant-generation framework and a
perceptual-fairness validation protocol, we create 2,127 task instances that
enable robust measurement of biases induced by individual visual factors and
their interactions. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate three
representative embodied agents across two prevailing paradigms and report three
key findings: (i) all agents exhibit significant visual biases, with camera
viewpoint being the most critical factor; (ii) agents achieve their highest
success rates on highly saturated colors, indicating inherited visual
preferences from underlying VLMs; and (iii) visual biases show strong,
asymmetric coupling, with viewpoint strongly amplifying color-related bias.
Finally, we demonstrate that a mitigation strategy based on a semantic
grounding layer substantially reduces visual bias by approximately 54.5\% on
MOKA. Our results highlight that systematic analysis of visual bias is a
prerequisite for developing safe and reliable general-purpose embodied agents.

Abstract: Efficiently detecting human intent to interact with ubiquitous robots is
crucial for effective human-robot interaction (HRI) and collaboration. Over the
past decade, deep learning has gained traction in this field, with most
existing approaches relying on multimodal inputs, such as RGB combined with
depth (RGB-D), to classify time-sequence windows of sensory data as interactive
or non-interactive. In contrast, we propose a novel RGB-only pipeline for
predicting human interaction intent with frame-level precision, enabling faster
robot responses and improved service quality. A key challenge in intent
prediction is the class imbalance inherent in real-world HRI datasets, which
can hinder the model's training and generalization. To address this, we
introduce MINT-RVAE, a synthetic sequence generation method, along with new
loss functions and training strategies that enhance generalization on
out-of-sample data. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUROC:
0.95) outperforming prior works (AUROC: 0.90-0.912), while requiring only RGB
input and supporting precise frame onset prediction. Finally, to support future
research, we openly release our new dataset with frame-level labeling of human
interaction intent.

TL;DR: WoW是一个140亿参数的世界模型，通过在200万机器人交互轨迹上训练，证明大规模真实世界交互是发展AI物理直觉的关键。该模型能生成物理一致的视频，并通过SOPHIA系统约束物理真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频模型（如Sora）仅通过被动观察学习，难以理解物理因果关系。作者假设真实的物理直觉必须基于与真实世界的大量因果丰富交互。

Method: 开发WoW模型，使用200万机器人交互轨迹训练。通过SOPHIA系统（视觉语言模型代理）评估DiT生成输出，并通过迭代演化语言指令来引导精炼。同时训练逆动力学模型将精炼计划转化为可执行机器人动作。

Result: WoW在WoWBench基准测试中取得最先进性能，在物理因果关系、碰撞动力学和物体恒存性方面表现优异。模型理解物理的方式是可能结果的概率分布，会出现随机不稳定性和物理幻觉。

Conclusion: 大规模真实世界交互是发展AI物理直觉的基石。通过主动交互训练的世界模型在物理一致性方面优于仅通过被动观察训练的模型。

Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active
interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video
models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle
with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central
hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in
extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this
hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model
trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that
the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of
plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical
hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can
be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where
vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its
refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a
co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into
executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We
establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal
reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical
causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides
systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone
for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be
open-sourced.

Abstract: We present DAWN (Diffusion is All We Need for robot control), a unified
diffusion-based framework for language-conditioned robotic manipulation that
bridges high-level motion intent and low-level robot action via structured
pixel motion representation. In DAWN, both the high-level and low-level
controllers are modeled as diffusion processes, yielding a fully trainable,
end-to-end system with interpretable intermediate motion abstractions. DAWN
achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging CALVIN benchmark,
demonstrating strong multi-task performance, and further validates its
effectiveness on MetaWorld. Despite the substantial domain gap between
simulation and reality and limited real-world data, we demonstrate reliable
real-world transfer with only minimal finetuning, illustrating the practical
viability of diffusion-based motion abstractions for robotic control. Our
results show the effectiveness of combining diffusion modeling with
motion-centric representations as a strong baseline for scalable and robust
robot learning. Project page: https://nero1342.github.io/DAWN/

Abstract: We propose ARTI-6, a compact six-dimensional articulatory speech encoding
framework derived from real-time MRI data that captures crucial vocal tract
regions including the velum, tongue root, and larynx. ARTI-6 consists of three
components: (1) a six-dimensional articulatory feature set representing key
regions of the vocal tract; (2) an articulatory inversion model, which predicts
articulatory features from speech acoustics leveraging speech foundation
models, achieving a prediction correlation of 0.87; and (3) an articulatory
synthesis model, which reconstructs intelligible speech directly from
articulatory features, showing that even a low-dimensional representation can
generate natural-sounding speech. Together, ARTI-6 provides an interpretable,
computationally efficient, and physiologically grounded framework for advancing
articulatory inversion, synthesis, and broader speech technology applications.

Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测模型大多在有限数据集上评估，其在实际场景中的泛化能力存在不确定性。

Method: 开发AUDDT开源工具包，自动化评估预训练检测器在28个数据集上的性能，分析不同伪造子组的检测效果。

Result: 使用广泛采用的预训练检测器展示了域内和域外检测结果，揭示了不同条件和音频操作类型之间的显著差异。

Conclusion: 分析了现有数据集的局限性及其与实际部署场景之间的差距。

Abstract: With the prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI)-generated content, such
as audio deepfakes, a large body of recent work has focused on developing
deepfake detection techniques. However, most models are evaluated on a narrow
set of datasets, leaving their generalization to real-world conditions
uncertain. In this paper, we systematically review 28 existing audio deepfake
datasets and present an open-source benchmarking toolkit called AUDDT
(https://github.com/MuSAELab/AUDDT). The goal of this toolkit is to automate
the evaluation of pretrained detectors across these 28 datasets, giving users
direct feedback on the advantages and shortcomings of their deepfake detectors.
We start by showcasing the usage of the developed toolkit, the composition of
our benchmark, and the breakdown of different deepfake subgroups. Next, using a
widely adopted pretrained deepfake detector, we present in- and out-of-domain
detection results, revealing notable differences across conditions and audio
manipulation types. Lastly, we also analyze the limitations of these existing
datasets and their gap relative to practical deployment scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估语音延续任务中的偏见，研究性别和发声类型对模型延续行为的影响，发现语音基础模型存在性别相关的文本偏见和发声质量偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语音延续任务比对话更能直接探测语音基础模型中的偏见，因为其约束在单一音频流中，提供了更可控的评估设置。

Method: 评估三个最新模型（SpiritLM、VAE-GSLM、SpeechGPT），使用说话人相似性、声音质量保持和基于文本的偏见指标，分析性别和发声类型的影响。

Result: 结果显示：说话人相似性和连贯性仍是挑战；当连贯性足够高时（VAE-GSLM），性别效应在文本指标上显现；女性提示的发声类型更强烈地向模态发声回归，揭示系统性声音质量偏见。

Conclusion: 语音延续可作为探测语音基础模型中社会相关表征偏见的受控工具，随着延续质量提升，它将提供越来越有信息量的诊断价值。

Abstract: Speech Continuation (SC) is the task of generating a coherent extension of a
spoken prompt while preserving both semantic context and speaker identity.
Because SC is constrained to a single audio stream, it offers a more direct
setting for probing biases in speech foundation models than dialogue does. In
this work we present the first systematic evaluation of bias in SC,
investigating how gender and phonation type (breathy, creaky, end-creak) affect
continuation behaviour. We evaluate three recent models: SpiritLM (base and
expressive), VAE-GSLM, and SpeechGPT across speaker similarity, voice quality
preservation, and text-based bias metrics. Results show that while both speaker
similarity and coherence remain a challenge, textual evaluations reveal
significant model and gender interactions: once coherence is sufficiently high
(for VAE-GSLM), gender effects emerge on text-metrics such as agency and
sentence polarity. In addition, continuations revert toward modal phonation
more strongly for female prompts than for male ones, revealing a systematic
voice-quality bias. These findings highlight SC as a controlled probe of
socially relevant representational biases in speech foundation models, and
suggest that it will become an increasingly informative diagnostic as
continuation quality improves.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 将基于补丁的扩散模型（PaDIS）扩展到多线圈MRI重建，在小数据集上训练即可超越传统方法，在图像质量、不确定性和诊断价值方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MRI采集时间长导致成本高、可及性差且易受运动伪影影响。传统扩散模型需要大数据集训练，这在临床环境中难以实现。

Method: 扩展PaDIS到复数多线圈MRI重建，在小数据集（最少25张k空间图像）上训练，并与FastMRI-EDM等基线方法对比。

Result: PaDIS-MRI在图像质量指标（PSNR、SSIM、NRMSE）、像素级不确定性、跨对比度泛化性和对严重k空间欠采样的鲁棒性方面均优于基线方法。在盲法研究中，91.7%的病例被放射科医生评为诊断价值更高。

Conclusion: 基于补丁的扩散先验在数据稀缺的临床环境中具有高保真MRI重建的潜力，特别是在诊断置信度至关重要的场景下。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) requires long acquisition times, raising
costs, reducing accessibility, and making scans more susceptible to motion
artifacts. Diffusion probabilistic models that learn data-driven priors can
potentially assist in reducing acquisition time. However, they typically
require large training datasets that can be prohibitively expensive to collect.
Patch-based diffusion models have shown promise in learning effective
data-driven priors over small real-valued datasets, but have not yet
demonstrated clinical value in MRI. We extend the Patch-based Diffusion Inverse
Solver (PaDIS) to complex-valued, multi-coil MRI reconstruction, and compare it
against a state-of-the-art whole-image diffusion baseline (FastMRI-EDM) for 7x
undersampled MRI reconstruction on the FastMRI brain dataset. We show that
PaDIS-MRI models trained on small datasets of as few as 25 k-space images
outperform FastMRI-EDM on image quality metrics (PSNR, SSIM, NRMSE),
pixel-level uncertainty, cross-contrast generalization, and robustness to
severe k-space undersampling. In a blinded study with three radiologists,
PaDIS-MRI reconstructions were chosen as diagnostically superior in 91.7% of
cases, compared to baselines (i) FastMRI-EDM and (ii) classical convex
reconstruction with wavelet sparsity. These findings highlight the potential of
patch-based diffusion priors for high-fidelity MRI reconstruction in
data-scarce clinical settings where diagnostic confidence matters.

TL;DR: 比较两种MRI到CT图像转换方法：条件生成对抗网络(cGAN)和条件去噪扩散概率模型(cDDPM)，发现cDDPM在生成合成CT图像方面表现更优，且多通道条件输入能提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CT图像在治疗和诊断中至关重要，但在无法获取CT时，需要从MRI生成合成CT图像的方法。需要确定最有效的MRI到CT转换策略。

Method: 使用Pix2Pix代表cGAN架构，Palette代表cDDPM架构。将3D转换问题分解为2D横向平面转换序列以降低计算成本。研究单切片和多切片条件输入的影响。

Result: cDDPM在MRI到CT转换中表现优于cGAN，多通道条件输入能提高生成质量。提出了新的切片相似度指标SIMOS来评估3D重建的连续性。

Conclusion: MRI到CT生成模型受益于多通道条件输入和cDDPM架构，这为医学图像合成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is essential for treatment and diagnostics; In case
CT are missing or otherwise difficult to obtain, methods for generating
synthetic CT (sCT) images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are
sought after. Therefore, it is valuable to establish a reference for what
strategies are most effective for MRI-to-CT translation. In this paper, we
compare the performance of two frequently used architectures for MRI-to-CT
translation: a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) and a
conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (cDDPM). We chose
well-established implementations to represent each architecture: Pix2Pix for
cGAN, and Palette for cDDPM. We separate the classical 3D translation problem
into a sequence of 2D translations on the transverse plane, to investigate the
viability of a strategy that reduces the computational cost. We also
investigate the impact of conditioning the generative process on a single MRI
image/slice and on multiple MRI slices. The performance is assessed using a
thorough evaluation protocol, including a novel slice-wise metric Similarity Of
Slices (SIMOS), which measures the continuity between transverse slices when
compiling the sCTs into 3D format. Our comparative analysis revealed that
MRI-to-CT generative models benefit from multi-channel conditional input and
using cDDPM as an architecture.

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个用于医学图像分割的度量不确定性量化框架，通过在模型表示空间中进行扰动来生成高效的置信区间，相比传统方法产生更紧密的区间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床应用中，分割模型的实际效用通常基于下游度量（如器官大小）的准确性，而非像素级分割精度。因此对这些度量进行不确定性量化对决策至关重要。

Method: COMPASS框架通过在模型表示空间中扰动中间特征，沿着对目标度量最敏感的低维子空间进行校准，避免了将复杂的分割-度量管道视为黑盒的低效做法。

Result: 在四个医学图像分割任务上的实验表明，COMPASS产生的区间比传统CP基线显著更紧密，并且在协变量偏移下也能恢复目标覆盖率。

Conclusion: COMPASS为医学图像分割提供了实用的基于度量的不确定性量化方法，通过利用深度神经网络的内在偏置实现了高效的不确定性估计。

Abstract: In clinical applications, the utility of segmentation models is often based
on the accuracy of derived downstream metrics such as organ size, rather than
by the pixel-level accuracy of the segmentation masks themselves. Thus,
uncertainty quantification for such metrics is crucial for decision-making.
Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular framework to derive such principled
uncertainty guarantees, but applying CP naively to the final scalar metric is
inefficient because it treats the complex, non-linear segmentation-to-metric
pipeline as a black box. We introduce COMPASS, a practical framework that
generates efficient, metric-based CP intervals for image segmentation models by
leveraging the inductive biases of their underlying deep neural networks.
COMPASS performs calibration directly in the model's representation space by
perturbing intermediate features along low-dimensional subspaces maximally
sensitive to the target metric. We prove that COMPASS achieves valid marginal
coverage under exchangeability and nestedness assumptions. Empirically, we
demonstrate that COMPASS produces significantly tighter intervals than
traditional CP baselines on four medical image segmentation tasks for area
estimation of skin lesions and anatomical structures. Furthermore, we show that
leveraging learned internal features to estimate importance weights allows
COMPASS to also recover target coverage under covariate shifts. COMPASS paves
the way for practical, metric-based uncertainty quantification for medical
image segmentation.

TL;DR: 本文提出基于nnUNet的3D图像翻译方法，用于MR到CT和CBCT到CT的转换，通过残差UNet和特征优先损失提升解剖结构重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像跨模态合成中解剖结构保真度不足的问题，特别是在头颈、胸部和腹部区域，需要更精确的临床相关结构重建。

Method: 采用nnUNet框架的两种网络配置（标准UNet和残差UNet），引入解剖特征优先损失（AFP），使用3D补丁训练，并进行1000-1500轮训练和500轮AFP微调。

Result: 残差网络结合AFP损失能产生更清晰的图像重建和更好的解剖保真度，特别是在MR到CT的骨骼结构和CBCT到CT的病灶区域，而仅使用L1损失的网络在强度指标上略优。

Conclusion: 该方法为跨模态医学图像合成提供了稳定解决方案，证明了nnUNet自动管道与残差学习和解剖引导特征损失结合的有效性。

Abstract: We present a patch-based 3D nnUNet adaptation for MR to CT and CBCT to CT
image translation using the multicenter SynthRAD2025 dataset, covering head and
neck (HN), thorax (TH), and abdomen (AB) regions. Our approach leverages two
main network configurations: a standard UNet and a residual UNet, both adapted
from nnUNet for image synthesis. The Anatomical Feature-Prioritized (AFP) loss
was introduced, which compares multilayer features extracted from a compact
segmentation network trained on TotalSegmentator labels, enhancing
reconstruction of clinically relevant structures. Input volumes were normalized
per-case using zscore normalization for MRIs, and clipping plus dataset level
zscore normalization for CBCT and CT. Training used 3D patches tailored to each
anatomical region without additional data augmentation. Models were trained for
1000 and 1500 epochs, with AFP fine-tuning performed for 500 epochs using a
combined L1+AFP objective. During inference, overlapping patches were
aggregated via mean averaging with step size of 0.3, and postprocessing
included reverse zscore normalization. Both network configurations were applied
across all regions, allowing consistent model design while capturing local
adaptations through residual learning and AFP loss. Qualitative and
quantitative evaluation revealed that residual networks combined with AFP
yielded sharper reconstructions and improved anatomical fidelity, particularly
for bone structures in MR to CT and lesions in CBCT to CT, while L1only
networks achieved slightly better intensity-based metrics. This methodology
provides a stable solution for cross modality medical image synthesis,
demonstrating the effectiveness of combining the automatic nnUNet pipeline with
residual learning and anatomically guided feature losses.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型存在感知诱导错误在推理链中传播的严重漏洞，现有RL微调方法未能有效解决视觉基础与后续推理过程之间的错位问题。

Method: 提出Caption-Regularized Policy Optimization (CapPO)，包含两个关键机制：(1) 基于描述的一致性正则化，最小化原始图像和描述条件下响应的差异；(2) KL加权优势估计方案，自适应缩放强化信号。

Result: 在5个数学推理和5个通用推理基准测试中，CapPO相比基础模型Qwen2.5-VL-7B，数学任务准确率提升+6.0%，通用推理任务提升+2.4%，显著减少了感知相关错误。

Conclusion: CapPO提供了一个简单而有效的框架来改进多模态推理，通过强制感知一致性来增强模型的推理能力。

Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at tasks that integrate visual
perception with symbolic reasoning, their performance is often undermined by a
critical vulnerability: perception-induced errors that propagate through the
reasoning chain. Current reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, while
enhancing reasoning abilities, largely fail to address the underlying
misalignment between visual grounding and the subsequent reasoning process. To
address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Caption-Regularized Policy
Optimization (CapPO)}, a novel RL framework that explicitly enforces perceptual
consistency during policy optimization. CapPO integrates two key mechanisms:
(1) a caption-based consistency regularization, which minimizes the divergence
between responses conditioned on raw images and those conditioned on captions,
thereby anchoring reasoning to semantically faithful visual content; and (2) a
KL-weighted advantage estimation scheme, which adaptively scales reinforcement
signals to strengthen perceptually consistent trajectories while suppressing
spurious correlations. Extensive experiments on five math-focused and five
general reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CapPO achieves competitive
performance, yielding gains of +6.0% accuracy on math-related tasks and +2.4%
on general reasoning tasks over the base Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Moreover,
ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while
error analysis reveals that CapPO significantly reduces perception-related
mistakes compared with baselines. Overall, CapPO provides a simple yet
effective framework for improving multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward
model from human preference data and then optimizes a policy to favor preferred
responses, has emerged as a central paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate exploration
principles for online RLHF, where one seeks to adaptively collect new
preference data to refine both the reward model and the policy in a
data-efficient manner. By examining existing optimism-based exploration
algorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to
gather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in
reward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can
incur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this
insight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries
toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy
improvement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regret
bounds of order $T^{(\beta+1)/(\beta+2)}$, where $\beta>0$ is a hyperparameter
that balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift. To our
knowledge, this is the first online RLHF algorithm with regret scaling
polynomially in all model parameters.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个评估LLM在循环不变量合成中性能的框架，通过验证器决策程序评估正确性和验证速度提升，发现当前LLM验证器相比传统求解器UAutomizer尚无显著优势，但监督微调和Best-of-N采样能有效提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序验证依赖循环不变量，但自动发现强不变量仍是一个长期挑战。需要建立原则性框架来评估LLM在不变量合成中的能力。

Method: 使用基于验证器的决策程序，具有形式化正确性保证，评估不变量正确性及其在验证中提供的速度提升。评估了7个最先进的LLM和现有基于LLM的验证器，并与传统求解器UAutomizer对比。

Result: 基于LLM的验证器尚未显示出对UAutomizer的显著优势。模型能力至关重要，不同模型在速度提升方面差异明显。监督微调（在3589个实例上）将Qwen3-Coder-480B的速度提升案例比例从8%提高到29.2%；Best-of-N采样（N=16）将Claude-sonnet-4从8.8%提升到22.1%。

Conclusion: 当前LLM在循环不变量合成基准测试中仍面临挑战，但监督微调和采样策略能显著提升性能，表明LLM验证器是一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Program verification relies on loop invariants, yet automatically discovering
strong invariants remains a long-standing challenge. We introduce a principled
framework for evaluating LLMs on invariant synthesis. Our approach uses a
verifier-based decision procedure with a formal soundness guarantee and
assesses not only correctness but also the speedup that invariants provide in
verification. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, and existing LLM-based
verifiers against the traditional solver UAutomizer. While LLM-based verifiers
represent a promising direction, they do not yet offer a significant advantage
over UAutomizer. Model capability also proves critical, as shown by sharp
differences in speedups across models, and our benchmark remains an open
challenge for current LLMs. Finally, we show that supervised fine-tuning and
Best-of-N sampling can improve performance: fine-tuning on 3589 instances
raises the percentage of speedup cases for Qwen3-Coder-480B from 8% to 29.2%,
and Best-of-N sampling with N=16 improves Claude-sonnet-4 from 8.8% to 22.1%.

Motivation: 验证证明包含了完整的程序行为信息，但在检查正确性后就被丢弃，这些证明具有转化为优化执行规则的潜力。

Method: 通过符号执行构建全路径可达性证明，编译证明的图结构，将多个语义重写合并为单一规则，并在K框架中实现语言无关的扩展。

Result: 评估显示在不同编译范围内都实现了性能改进：操作码级优化显示一致的加速效果，而全程序编译实现了数量级的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过证明编译是一种有效的优化方法，能够利用验证证明中的信息生成高效的执行规则，在保持正确性的同时显著提升性能。

Abstract: Verification proofs encode complete program behavior, yet we discard them
after checking correctness. We present compiling by proving, a paradigm that
transforms these proofs into optimized execution rules. By constructing
All-Path Reachability Proofs through symbolic execution and compiling their
graph structure, we consolidate many semantic rewrites into single rules while
preserving correctness by construction. We implement this as a
language-agnostic extension to the K framework. Evaluation demonstrates
performance improvements across different compilation scopes: opcode-level
optimizations show consistent speedups, while whole-program compilation
achieves orders of magnitude greater performance gains.
